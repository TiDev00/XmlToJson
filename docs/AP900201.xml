   The Associated Press reported erroneously in a
story on growing numbers of youths taking the Scholastic Aptitude
Test that the average college-bound senior male, the highest
scoring group, scored 430 on the verbal portion of the test. The
figure actually is 434.
   The same story also misidentified the test as the Standardized
Achievement Test and a spokesman of the testing firm as Roy Nicosia
instead of Ray Nicosia.

   Buried in a mountain meadow on the
edge of Yellowstone National Park is a complex of 150-foot-long
steel cylinders outfitted with beds, food, kitchens and water
systems for 756 people.
   The 30 cylinders are the guts of a giant fallout shelter being
built by the Church Universal and Triumphant, a New Age religious
group that moved its international headquarters to this
southwestern Montana ranch in 1986.
   Church members say the six-acre complex isn't provocative or
extraordinary, merely a precaution against nuclear war or accident.
Others see it as a symbol of church chicanery and disregard for the
area's rural environment.
   ``We believe if you live in a nuclear world, you have to come to
grips with the reality of our time,'' said Murray Steinman, a
church staffer. ``We feel it's the responsible thing to do. We feel
that more people should do it.''
   ``They've never been willing to discuss plans prior to
construction on anything,'' said Richard Parks, owner of an
outdoor-equipment shop at Gardiner and a frequent critic of church
developments. ``Any responsible developer is going to do the
planning first and then go to the community for approval.''
   Church officials didn't divulge its construction until last
summer _ five months after the state completed an extensive
environmental review of other church developments at the Corwin
Springs ranch.
   ``I think I was had, basically,'' said Steve Pilcher, chief of
the Water Quality Bureau, which oversaw the review that was
completed last February.
   Church spokeswoman Erin Prophet said that construction began in
May and that a decision on the site wasn't made until after the
state review.
   ``I personally think that's a little bit of a crock,'' Pilcher
said. ``You don't decide overnight on a project of this magnitude.''
   The church has been scrutinized by the media and its neighbors
since buying the 12,500-acre Royal Teton Ranch bordering
Yellowstone in 1981 from publisher Malcolm Forbes. It has since
expanded its holdings in Park County to 30,000 acres, built two
food-processing plants, opened a printing plant in Livingston and
sponsored two housing developments for church members near
Emigrant, 25 miles north. It plans another housing development at
the ranch.
   Local officials estimate 2,000 church members live in the area,
or 15 percent of the county population.
   Persistent rumors that the church was stockpiling weapons
against some Armageddon were fueled last year when two members
pleaded guilty to charges of illegally obtaining a dozen military
assault-style weapons; federal agents said they seized a shopping
list for more firearms. Church officials have denied the rumors,
and say the two who bought the guns _ including church Vice
President Edward Francis _ were acting without the knowledge or
approval of the church.
   The shelter complex isn't the only church-related underground
construction. Adherents are building private shelters at Emigrant.
County officials counted at least 16 under construction there _ one
with a capacity of 170 people. A magazine published by church
members carries advertisements selling space in the shelters, with
prices ranging from $1,250 to $6,270 a person.
   Church leader Elizabeth Clare Prophet has preached civil defense
since the 1970s and warns of economic and nuclear calamity in the
'90s. In 1987, she said she received a divine message that the
nation should develop civil defense and missile-defense systems in
anticipation of a nuclear confrontation.
   The confrontation didn't occur by the predicted date of Oct. 2,
1989, but followers say her messages are warnings rather than
predictions.
   ``She has said that it may happen ... because there's always
free will,'' says Erin Prophet, Mrs. Prophet's daughter. ``The
Americans have free will, the Soviets have free will. ... But as
long as the Soviets have nuclear weapons and ICBMs, then we think
we need to have shelters.''
   The large shelter complex is in a valley where the church holds
an annual conclave attended by thousands of followers. Non-members
are not allowed in the area, which is considered sacred. Church
engineers designed the structure, with advice from private firms
and the federal Oak Ridge National Laboratories. Most of the work
has been done by church staff members.
   The complex consists of six H-shaped configurations, each with
five 150-foot-long steel cylinders about 13 feet in diameter. A
large central structure lies between two of the H-shaped shelters.
   Church officials say the shelter's water and sewage systems are
exempt from state review because it won't be occupied by more than
25 people for more than 60 days a year _ the legal description of a
``public water system.''
   ``The government says you would only need to be in the fallout
shelter for a few weeks'' in the event of a nuclear catastrophe,
Steinman said. ``We don't want to live down there any longer than
necessary.''
   Critics, including Yellowstone National Park Superintendent
Robert Barbee, scoff at such reasoning and have asked the state to
reopen its review. ``What does it take to have (state officials)
say, `You can't build an underground city for 750 people without
the proper permits?''' Parks fumed.
   Pilcher said his office is looking for evidence of deception,
but without it the state can't reopen the case. ``The only thing I
could do is say to the church, `I think you're a liar,' but I don't
have anything to prove that.''
   Parks and other critics say the construction is indicative of
the church's pre-emptive methods of development in areas ill-suited
for it.
   Prophet replies that the church has followed the law and doesn't
need to disclose its plans unless legally required to do so. ``They
don't really care about the environment,'' she said. ``They care
about stopping us. Basically what they want to do is shut us down.''

<TEXT>
   In 1924, The Times of London tut-tutted about a
peculiar new craze sweeping America, ``making devastating inroads
on the working hours of every rank of society.''
   Within six years, The Times itself had fallen victim to the new
addiction, and the crossword puzzle was on its way to becoming as
much a part of the British way of life as Buckingham Palace and
kippers for breakfast.
   The Times daily crossword is 60 years old today and is
celebrating the event by offering devotees a monster that fills
half of page 11, with nearly 200 clues spread over five days.
   Like all British crossword puzzles, it's a maze of puns,
anagrams and misleading punctuation.
   Take 3 down from The Times diamond jubilee puzzle: ``Faulty
memory _ first daughter put in Joan's place'' (7 letters).
   ``Amnesia''? ``Dynasty''? No. Reshuffle the letters of
``memory,'' add the first letter of ``daughter,'' and up comes
``Domremy,'' Joan (of Arc)'s birthplace.
   A practical person might ask why the clue isn't simply: ``Joan
of Arc's birthplace.''
   But that would be too literal for the puzzle-loving British
mind. The object isn't to crack the whole thing over coffee and
cereal but to pore over it on the train, discuss it with colleagues
at work, go back to it after dinner, and wake up in the middle of
the night screaming ``Mousetrap, by Jove! Twelve across is
mousetrap!''
   According to Michelle Arnot's sprightly ``History of the
Crossword Puzzle,'' the first crosswords appeared in the United
States in 1913, and within a few years began turning up across the
Atlantic.
   Arnot says the ground rules for the British puzzle were laid
down by Edward Powys Mather, a literary critic with a fondness for
semantic contortions who published crosswords under the apt
pen-name Torquemada, after the torturer of the Spanish Inquisition.
   The Times soon found itself having to swallow its contempt for
such frivolities. Reader demand and competition from other papers
forced it to begin running a weekly puzzle, and on Feb. 1, 1930,
the first daily puzzle appeared.
   Adrian Bell, a bookish farmer who became the Times' first
compiler, produced more than 5,000 puzzles until his death in 1978.
It was, he once remarked, ``the ideal job for a chap with a vacant
mind sitting on a tractor harrowing clods, or bicycling.''
   John Grant, 66, who has been The Times' crossword editor for
seven years, works at a desk at home, but often finds inspiration
between holes on the golf course. He has 10 compilers around the
country.
   Solving a British crossword requires familiarity with
Shakespeare, Cockney slang, basic French, cricket and a code of
tricky euphemisms.
   For instance, if the clue mentions ``hesitation,'' it means the
answer has ``er'' in it. ``Record'' usually signifies the word
components ``list,'' ``log,'' or ``LP.'' ``A French'' points the
solver to ``un'' or ``une.'' ``Back'' suggests reversing the word,
so that ``Run back'' means the syllable ``nur.'' ``Within'' hints
at one word inside another, as in ``un(bear)able.''
   The Times crossword is by no means the hardest. All the leading
British papers publish a daily puzzle, while the Spectator,
Listener and Observer magazines run weekly puzzles of even more
fiendish complexity.
   The Spectator puzzle not only contains unclued answers that call
for intuition, but also requires a dictionary that will reveal to
solvers such words as Guebres (a branch of Zoroastrianism).
   Grant does not go for puzzles that require dictionaries.
   ``I think it's much more worthwhile and difficult to outwit
readers with words they are familiar with,'' he said in an
interview.
   Since 1970, The Times has offered ``Jumbo crosswords'' to tide
solvers over holiday periods, and an annual crossword tournament.
Every week about 3,000 solvers send in completed puzzles from the
Saturday edition. The first five winners drawn by lottery win a
gold-nibbed fountain pen.
   For solvers of the diamond jubilee mega-puzzle, first prize is a
vacation in India and second prize a set of the Encyclopaedia
Britannica.
   But for most, the prize is simply that sense of accomplishment
at figuring out such mysteries as ``man older than most _ than an
elder, possibly (11 letters).''
   An anagram of ``than an elder,'' possibly.

   Text of President Bush's State of the Union
address Wednesday night.
   Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the United States
Congress: I return as a former President of the Senate, and former
member of this great House. Now, as President, it is my privilege
to report to you on the State of the Union.
   Tonight, I come not to speak about the ``state of the
government'' _ not to detail every new initiative we plan for the
coming year, nor to describe every line item in the budget. I'm
here to speak to you and to the American people about the State of
the Union _ about our world _ the changes we've seen, the
challenges we face. And what that means for America. There are
singular moments in history: dates that divide all that goes before
from all that comes after. Many of us in this chamber have lived
much of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were
defined in 1945. The events of that year decreed the shape of
nations. The pace of progress. Freedom or oppression for millions
of people around the world.
   Nineteen forty-five provided the common frame of reference _ the
compass points of the post-war era we've relied upon to understand
ourselves. That was our world. Until now. The events of the year
just ended _ the revolution of '89 _ have been a chain reaction _
change so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in the
world's affairs.
   Think back _ just twelve short months ago _ to the world we knew
_ as 1989 began.
   One year ago, the people of Panama lived in fear, under the
thumb of a dictator. Today, democracy is restored _ Panama is free.
   Operation ``JUST CAUSE'' has achieved its objective. The number
of military personnel in Panama is now close to what it was before
the operation began. And tonight, I am announcing that _ well
before the end of February _ the additional numbers of American
troops _ the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who made this
mission a success _ will be back home.
   A year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa declared that he was ready to
open a dialogue with the communist rulers of that country. Today,
with the future of a free Poland in their own hands, members of
Solidarity lead the Polish government.
   A year ago, freedom's playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a
prisoner in Prague. Today, it's Vaclav Havel _ President of
Czechoslovakia.
   And one year ago, Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history
as his guide. He predicted the Berlin Wall would last another
hundred years. Today _ less than one year later _ it's the Wall
that's history.

   Remarkable events _ events that fulfill the long-held hopes of
the American people. Events that validate the long-standing goals
of American policy _ a policy based on a single, shining principle:
the cause of freedom.
   America _ not just the nation _ but an idea, alive in the minds
of people everywhere. As this new world takes shape, America stands
at the center of a widening circle of freedom _ today, tomorrow and
into the next century.
   Our nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set
foot on these shores _ and the millions still struggling to be
free. This nation _ this idea called America _ was and always will
be _ a new world. Our new world.
   At a workers' really _ in a place called Branik on the outskirts
of Prague _ the idea called America is alive. A worker, dressed in
grimy overalls, rises to speak at the factory gates. He begins his
speech to his fellow citizens with these words _ words of a distant
revolution:
   ``We hold these truths to be self-evident. That all men are
created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable rights. (And) that among these are life, liberty and
the pursuit of happiness.''
   It's no secret that, here at home, freedom's door opened long
ago. The cornerstones of this free society have already been set in
place: Democracy. Competition. Opportunity. Private investment.
Stewardship. And of course, leadership.
   Our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours _
a system second to none _ and make it better.
   A better America, where there's a job for everyone who wants one.
   Where women working outside the home can be confident their
children are in safe and loving care _ and where government works
to expand child care alternatives for parents.
   Where we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong
economy.
   Whre ``Made in the U.S.A.'' is recognized around the world as
the symbol of quality and progress.
   Where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to
work, and to contribute to society. And where, for the first time,
the American mainstream includes all of our disabled citizens.
   Where everyone has a roof over his head _ and where the homeless
get the help they need to live in dignity.
   Where our schools challenge and support our kids and our
teachers _ and where all of them make the grade.
   Where every street, every city, every school and every child is
drug-free.
   And finally, where no American is forgotten. Our hearts go out
to our hostages _ our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds and
in our efforts.
   That's part of the future we want to see _ the future we can
make for ourselves. But dreams alone won't get us there. We need to
extend our horizon _ commit to the long-view. Our plans for the
future start today.

<TEXT>
   In the tough competitive markets around, America faces great
challenges and great opportunities. We know that we can succeed in
the global economic arena of the 90's, but to meet that challenge
we must make some fundamental changes _ some crucial investments in
ourselves.
   Yes _ we are going to invest in America. This administration is
determined to encourage the creation of capital _ capital of all
kinds. Physical capital: Everything from our farms and factories to
our workshops and production lines, all that is needed to produce
and deliver quality goods and quality services. Intellectual
capital: The source of ideas that spark tomorrow's products. And of
course, our human capital: The talented workforce we'll need to
compete in the global market.
   And let me tell you: If we ignore human capital _ we lose the
spirit of American ingenuity _ the spirit that is the hallmark of
the American worker. And the American worker is the most productive
worker in the world.
   We need to save more _ expand the pool of capital for the new
investments that mean more jobs, more growth. That's the idea
behind a new initiative I call the Family Savings Plan, which I
will send to the Congress tomorrow.
   We need to cut the tax on capital gains _ encourage risk-takers
_ especially those in our small businesses _ to take those steps
that translate into economic reward, jobs, and a better life for
all of us.
   We'll do what it takes to invest in America's future. The budget
commitment is there. The money is there. It's there for Research
and Development, R&amp;D _ a record high. It's there for our housing
initiative _ HOPE, to help everyone from first-time home buyers to
the homeless. The money's there to keep our kids drug-free: 70
percent more than when I took office in 1989. It's there for space
exploration _ and it's there for education: another record high.
   And one more thing: Last fall at the Education Summit, the
governors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure kids are
ready to learn _ the very first day they walk into that classroom.
I've made good on that commitment _ by proposing a record increase
in funds _ an extra half a billion dollars _ for something near and
dear to all of us: Head Start.
   Education is the one investment that means more for our future
because it means the most for our children. Real improvement in our
schools is not simply a matter of spending more. It is a matter of
asking more _ expecting more _ of our schools, our teachers, of our
kids, and our parents and ourselves. That's why tonight I am
announcing America's education goals _ goals developed with the
nation's governors.
   And if I might, I'd like to say I'm very pleased that Gov.
Gardner, Gov. Clinton, Gov. Branstead, Gov. Campbell, all of whom
are very key in these discussions, these deliberations, are with us
here tonight.
   _By the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn.
   _The United States must increase the high school graduation rate
to no less than 90 percent.
   _And we're going to make sure our schools' diplomas mean
something: In critical subjects _ at the fourth, eighth and 12th
grades _ we must assess our students' performance.
   _By the year 2000, U.S. students must be first in the world in
math and science achievement.
   _Every American adult must be a literate worker and citizen.

   _Every school must offer the kind of disciplined environment
that makes it possible for our kids to learn _ every school in
America must be drug-free.
   Ambitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the
future's at stake. This nation will not accept anything less than
excellence in education.
   These investments will keep America competitive. And I know this
about the American people: We welcome competition. We'll match our
ingenuity and energy _ our experience and technology _ our spirit
and enterprise _ against anyone. Let the competition be free _ but
let it be fair. America is ready.
   Since we really mean it _ and since we are serious about being
ready to meet that challenge _ we're getting our own house in
order. We've made real progress. Seven years ago, the federal
deficit was 6 percent of our Gross National Product. In the new
budget I sent up two days ago the deficit is down to 1 percent of
the GNP.
   That budget brings federal spending under control. It meets the
Gramm-Rudman target, brings that deficit down further, and balances
the budget by 1993 _ with no new taxes.
   And let me tell you, there's still more than enough federal
spending. For most of us, $1.2 trillion is a lot of money.
   And once the budget is balanced, we can operate the way every
family must when it has bills to pay. We won't leave it to ur
children and grandchildren. We will start paying off the national
debt.
   And there's something more we owe the generations of the future:
stewardship _ the safekeeping of America's precious environmental
inheritance.
   As just one sign of how serious we are, we will elevate the
Environmental Protection Agency to cabinet rank. Not more
bureaucracy, not more red tape _ but the certainty that here at
home, and in our dealings with other nations, environmental issues
have the status they deserve.
   This year's budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to
protect our environment, with over $1 billion for global change
research. And a new initiative I will call ``America the
Beautiful'' _ to expand our national parks and wildlife preserves
and improve recreational facilities on public lands.
   And something else: something that will help keep this country
clean, from our forest land to our inner cities, and keep America
beautiful for generations to come _ the money to plant a billion
trees a year.
   And tonight, let me say again to all the members of Congress:
The American people did not send us here to bicker. There's work to
do _ and they sent us here to get it done. And once again, I offer
my hand to all of you. Let's work together to do the will of the
people. Clean air. Child care. The Educational Excellence Act.
Crime and drugs. It's time to act. The farm bill. Transportation
policy. Product liability reform. Enterprise zones. It's time to
act together.
   And there's one thing I hope we'll all be able to agree on. It's
about our commitments. I'm talking about Social Security.

<TEXT>
   To every American out there on Social Security, to every
American supporting that system today, and to everyone counting on
it when they retire: We made a promise to you _ and we are going to
keep it.
   We rescued the system in 1983 _ and it's sound again. Our budget
fully funds today's benefits _ and it assures that future benefits
will be funded as well. The last thing we need to do is mess around
with Social Security.
   There's one more problem we need to address. We must give
careful consideration to the recommendations of the health care
studies now underway. That's why tonight, I am instructing Dr.
Louis Sullivan _ secretary of health and human services _ to lead a
Domestic Policy Council review of recommendations on the quality,
accessibility and cost of our nation's health care system. I am
committed to bring the staggering costs of health care under
control.
   The ``state of the government'' does indeed depend on many of us
in this very chamber. But the State of the Union depends on all
Americans. We must maintain the democratic decency that makes a
nation out of millions of individuals. I have been appalled at the
recent mail bombings across this country. Every one of us must
confront and condemn racism, anti-Semitism, bigotry and hate. Not
next week, not tomorrow, but right now.
   The State of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor _
claim the problems of our community as our own. We've got to step
forward when there's trouble _ lend a hand, be what I call a point
of light to a stranger in need. We've got to take the time after a
busy day to sit down and read with our kids, help them with their
homework, and pass along the values we learned as children. That's
how we sustain the State of the Union.
   Every effort is important. It all adds up _ it's doing the
things that give democracy meaning. It all adds up to who we are _
and who we will be.
   And let me say, that so long as we remember the American idea _
so long as we live up to the American ideal _ the State of the
Union will remain sound and strong.
   And to those who worry we have lost our way _ well, I want you
to listen to parts of a letter written by James Markwell _ PFC
James Markwell, a 20-year-old Army medic of the 1st Battalion, 75th
Rangers. It's dated December 18th _ the night before our armed
forces went into action in Panama. It's a letter servicemen write _
and hope will never be sent. Sadly, Private Markwell's mother did
receive this letter. And she passed it on to me.
   Here is some of what he wrote: ``I have never been afraid of
death, but now he is waiting at the corner ... I have been trained
to kill and to save, so has everyone else. I am frightened of what
lays beyond the fog, yet ... Do not mourn for me, revel in the life
that I have died to give you ... But most of all, don't forget that
the Army was my choice. Something that I wanted to do.''
   ``Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and ensure that
you are free to do what you want and live your lives freely.''
   Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in Panama,
and one of the first to fall.
   He knew what he believed in. He carried the idea we call America
in his heart.

<TEXT>
   I began tonight speaking about the changes we've seen this past
year. There is a new world of challenges and opportunities before
us. And there is a need for leadership that only America can
provide.
   Nearly 40 years ago, in his last address to the Congress,
President Harry Truman predicted such a time would come. He said:
``As our world grows stronger, more united, more attractive to men
on both sides of the iron curtain, then inevitably there will come
a time of change within the communist world.''
   Today, that change is taking place.
   For more than 40 years, America and its allies held communism in
check, and ensured that democracy would continue to exist. Today,
with communism crumbling, our aim must be to ensure democracy's
advance. To take the lead in forging peace and freedom's best hope
_ a great and growing commonwealth of free nations.
   To the Congress and to all Americans, I say it is time to
acclaim a new consensus at home and abroad _ a common vision of the
peaceful world we want to see.
   Here in our own hemisphere, it's time for all the people of the
Americas _ North and South _ to live in freedom.
   In the Far East and Africa, it is time for the full flowering of
free governments and free markets that have served as the engine of
progress.
   It is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of
Eastern Europe. So that continent _ for too long a continent
divided _ can see a future whole and free.
   And it's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet
Union _ to endorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal
change toward democracy and economic opportunity.
   We are in a period of great transition, great hope, yet great
uncertainty. We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe
is diminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic
modernization. Therefore, we must sustain our own strategic offense
modernization and the Strategic Defense Initiative.
   But the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms
control agreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military
forces in Europe _ a coherent defense program that ensures the U.S.
will continue to be a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe. I've
consulted with leaders of NATO _ and in fact, I spoke by phone with
President Gorbachev, just today.
   I agree with our European allies that an American military
presence in Europe is essential _ and that it should not be tied
solely for the Soviet military presence in Eastern Europe.
   But troop levels can still be lower. So tonight, I am announcing
a major new step _ for a further reduction in U.S. and Soviet
manpower in Central and Eastern Europe to 195,000 on each side.
   This number reflects the advice of our senior military advisers.
It is designed to protect American and European interests _ and
sustain NATO's defense strategy. A swift conclusion to our arms
control talks _ conventional, chemical and strategic _ must now be
our goal. That time has come.

   Still, we must recognize an unfortunate fact: In many regions of
the world tonight, the reality is conflict _ not peace. Enduring
animosities and opposing interests remain. Thus the cause of peace
must be served by an America strong enough _ and sure enough _ to
defend our interests and ideals. It's this American idea that for
the past four decades helped inspire the Revolution of '89.
   Here at home _ and in the world _ there is history in the making
_ and history to be made. Six months ago, early in this season of
change, I stood at the gates of the Gdansk Shipyard in Poland at
the monument to the fallen workers of Solidarity. It's a monument
of simple majesty. Three tall crosses rise up from the stones. Atop
each cross, an anchor _ an ancient symbol of hope.
   The anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady in
times of change _ a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom is
at the very heart of the idea that is America.
   Giving life to the idea depends on every one of us. Our anchor
has always been faith and family.
   In the last few days of this past momentous year, our family was
blessed once more _ celebrating the joy of life when a little boy
became our 12th grandchild.
   When I held the little guy for the first time, the troubles at
home and abroad seemed manageable _ in perspective.
   Now, I know what you're thinking: That's a grandfather talking.
   Well, maybe you're right. But I've met a lot of children this
past year _ across this country, and everywhere from the Far East
to Eastern Europe. All kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike.
The budding young environmentalists I met this month, who joined me
exploring the Florida Everglades. The little leaguers I played
catch with in Poland _ ready to go from Warsaw to the World Series.
Even the kids who are ill or alone _ God bless those boarder
babies, born addicted to drugs _ coping with problems no child
should have to face. But, you know, when it comes to hope and the
future: Every kid is the same. Full of dreams. Ready to take on the
world. All special because they are the very future of freedom. To
them belongs this new world I've been speaking about.
   So tonight I'm going to ask something of every one of you. Let
me start with my generation _ the grandparents out there. You are
our living link to the past. Tell your grandchildren the story of
struggles waged, at home and abroad. Of sacrifices freely made for
freedom's sake. And tell them your own story as well _ because
every American has a story to tell.
   Parents: Your children look to you for direction and guidance.
Tell them of faith and family. Tell them we are one nation under
God. Teach them that of all the many gifts they can receive,
liberty is their most precious legacy. And of all the gifts then
can give, the greatest is helping others.
   And to the children and young people out there tonight: With you
rests our hope _ all that America will mean in the years and
decades ahead. Fix your vision on a new century _ your century. On
dreams we cannot see. On the destiny that is yours _ and yours
alone.
   And finally, let all Americans _ all of us together here in this
chamber, the symbolic center of democracy _ affirm our allegiance
to this idea we call America. And let us all remember that the
State of the Union depends on each and every one of us.

   Text of the Democratic response to President
Bush's State of the Union address by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley
of Washington State.
   Good evening.
   I'm Tom Foley, the Speaker of the House. Earlier tonight, you
may have seen me sitting behind President Bush as he delivered his
address.
   The first time I was present for a State of the Union message, I
was a young staff member working here in the Capitol for one of the
giants of the United States Senate, Scoop Jackson of Washington
State. It was the cold winter of 1962 _ a few months after the
Berlin Crisis _ and President Kennedy spoke eloquently, to the
Congress and the country, of the ``burden and the glory of
freedom.''
   Today, as we begin a new decade, we join together to celebrate
the glory of a new era of freedom. This new era is not a
coincidence or an accident. Its coming is due in large measure to
those who carried the burden for nearly half a century _ presidents
and people alike; defenders and dissenters; Congresses and
administrations from Harry Truman to George Bush.
   In a special way, the credit goes to successive generations of
young Americans, the 25 million who have served in the Armed Forces
since World War II and the 350,000 who have been wounded or lost
their lives.
   In the end, the credit goes to all the American people, who have
paid the costs and stayed the course of a Cold War that was the
longest conflict in American history _ and perhaps the most fateful
conflict of modern history.
   Some doubted that it could ever be ended except in defeat or in
flames. But we as a nation met John Kennedy's challenge to
``persevere, (to) look beyond our own shores and ambitions'' _ and
so we have helped, in Ronald Reagan's words, ``to turn the tide of
history away from the totalitarian darkness and into the warm
sunlight of human freedom.''
   The events are still unfolding, and the old world's new
revolution of hope is still unfinished. But this is a time of honor
and pride for America _ and for free men and women everywhere.

<TEXT>
   We have a continuing obligation to fulfill _ an obligation to
those who struggle on, from South Africa to China. Who could ever
forget the bravery of one Chinese student who stood all alone in
front of a tank near Tiananmen Square and stopped it?
   We Democrats believe that it was wrong for the Bush
administration to yield to pressure from a communist dictatorship
in Beijing; it was wrong for the President to veto a bill that
would have safeguarded Chinese students in America from being sent
back to their homeland's reign of repression. One lesson of the
past forty-five years is that no Congress and no president should
be timid in the defense of freedom.
   There's another, underlying truth in the ferment sweeping the
globe. We are perhaps near the end of a great struggle, but we are
certainly not at the end of history.
   The 1990s will be a period of profound and continuing change.
This new decade marks more than a division of time _ and it will
lead to more than a new century. For there are new realities to be
grasped, new challenges to be met, and very different battles to be
won.
   In the 1990s, and well into the next century, the central
challenge for America will be economic, not military. The greatest
test of our strength will be in our classrooms, not our missile
silos. The gravest threat will come not from any nation's attempt
at world domination, but from every nation's complicity in the
worldwide destruction of the environment.
   This period of vast change will be a period of fundamental
choice. Much of what the president said tonight I agree with. Some
of what he said, I disagree with.
   But my purpose here is not to debate point by point. I'm here to
tell you where we as Democrats stand, the values we hold _ the
vision we have _ the choice we believe in.
   First, we believe that we must renew our economic capacity and
regain control of our economic destiny.
   Today, the America that invented the computer chip and the VCR
has seen its market share shrink or vanish in both products.
   We are falling dramatically behind in new technologies such as
high definition television.
   As Democrats, we're not satisfied with a trend that has seen
this nation drop from first to sixth in standard of living. We're
not satisfied to be told that within 10 years, the average West
German worker may earn 150 percent as much as the average American
worker. We're not satisfied to have American students rank near the
bottom of the industrial nations in math and science.

   We will set a national goal of making our schools once again the
best in the world by the year 2000. On this issue, the President's
words seem to agree with us, but his actions say something else.
You can't become the education president, with all the problems we
face in this area, by proposing a meager 2 percent increase in the
education budget. That's a fact. And for all the talk, that's
exactly what the president proposes to do.
   We also believe that American corporations have a responsibility
and should have the opportunity to reinvest in America. We believe
that the wave of corporate mergers and leveraged buy-outs is a
waste of resources. It leaves Wall Street raiders with large sums
of money in their pockets _ and it leaves our companies
overburdened with debt and weakened in competing for world markets.
   This issue represents another real difference between us and the
Republicans. For too many years, their policies have encouraged
debt and quick profit instead of investment and long-term growth.
The result: the amount of private resources put into research and
development has fallen in real dollars.
   It's imperative to reverse the trend _ and to secure America's
place on the frontiers of enterprise and invention.
   At the same time, we must demand that nations trading with us
give our products an equal chance in their markets _ products
ranging from innovations in the service sector of the abundant
harvests of American agriculture.
   Make no mistake about it. We favor expanded trade, but we reject
the idea of one-way free trade. We believe this nation should be in
the business of exporting the goods our workers make, not the jobs
our workers need.
   We also believe in encouraging a rise in savings, which have
collapsed to a record low during the 1980s. The Republicans say
they want to do this by cutting the capital gains tax, a cut which
would give 80 percent of the benefits to the richest 1 percent of
Americans. Instead, we are fighting to restore IRAs _ so
middle-income families can save as much as $2,000 a year tax-free _
and then use the money for their own retirement, or as a down
payment on a first home.
   We took on the struggle against the capital gains proposal when
the odds were against us. We won last year _ and this year we will
do all we can to make sure that the greatest part of any tax cut,
of any kind, goes to those of you who live on a paycheck _ not just
the few who have the highest incomes, the largest stock portfolios,
and, by the way, the potential for the biggest tax shelters.
   This issue goes to the heart of the reason we are Democrats:
Above all else, we stand with you, the people who go to work and
pay the taxes. It is your cause to which we are committed, and your
side on which we fight.

   So we will also fight for the most effective Clean Air Bill _
even though that may offend entrenched and powerful interests.
   We will fight for child care _ so that working parents don't
have to choose between their family's standard of living and their
children's standard of care.
   We will fight for campaign finance reform. We disagree with the
administration's opposition to limits on campaign spending. Let's
be blunt about it. Don't we all know there is simply too much money
being raised and being spent in American politics?
   And there is another issue on which we have only just begun to
fight: this administration's practice of misusing the Social
Security trust fund to hide the size of the federal budget deficit.
   Social Security involves more than a trust fund; it involves the
basic bond of trust between our people and our government. From the
beginning, Social Security has been the Democratic party's proudest
achievement. We reject the suggestion of some Republicans to
privatize the system. They say that's a new idea. We think it's the
same old bad idea, another version of the repeated Republican
attempt to undermine Social Security.
   Finally, as Democrats, we believe that there are areas where the
government simply does not belong. We will continue to defend a
woman's right to choose _ for we are convinced that politicians
cannot and should not attempt to make the choice.
   But we also believe government can have a positive role _ not to
dominate, but to help people improve their own lives.
   The reason we have so many homeless in America today is not
because government has cared too much, but because government has
cared too little. We have to do better than that _ on a whole range
of issues.
   We will seek to secure the right of all our children to learn in
better schools and to earn a better life.
   We will seek to secure the civil rights of all our people. We
can't celebrate freedom abroad and then deny freedom at home.
   We are also committed to the strongest possible attack on the
drugs that are attacking our society and our families. On this we
are all united. Narcotics destroy the children of Democrats and
Republicans alike.
   One of my first jobs was as a deputy prosecutor in my hometown
of Spokane, Washington. I believe then and I believe now in
enforcing the law _ not in legalizing drugs. We won't win this
struggle overnight, or in a few months, or even over a year or two.
But together we can begin to reclaim our streets and our schools
and our neighborhoods.

   Let me say it again. We will work with the president wherever
and whenever we can. On some issues, we will have differences
because we care deeply about certain principles _ and about the
people who have been the abiding concern of the Democratic Party.
Today, we Democrats stand, as we have before, for working families.
We stand for both economic justice and economic opportunity. For
protecting the environment. For senior citizens and the soundness
of Social Security.
   And where we must, we will disagree with the administration. We
will stand our ground when that is the only way to stand for you.
   Above all else, we have high ambitions for America in the 1990s.
We cannot be content to be bystanders, riders on the storm of
history. For we are living in one of those rare seasons of change
that come to few generations. We are being challenged by countries
who say America is in decline _ that we can never again be the best
in the world marketplace. We do not accept that. We reject those
who assume that Americans aren't smart enough, or disciplined
enough, or tough enough to rise to the moment.
   We were in the 1940s _ and we saved the post-war world. Now we
must strengthen our own country. The time has come for America to
help herself, to rebuild, to re-energize, to reinvigorate our
hopes, to gather together our talents and to reclaim our place in
the world.
   In the short span of this decade, we have a long way to move as
a nation. Let us resolve that on that day when America enters the
twenty-first century, we shall be first _ first economically, first
in education and science, first in human decency and human rights.
   Thank you, God bless you, God bless our country.
   Goodnight.

   Maoist guerrillas shot to death the vice
mayors of two Andean villages who belonged to the opposition
coalition of presidential candidate Mario Vargas Llosa, police said.
   The Shining Path rebels left notes on both bodies that said:
``This is how the new starvers of the people die,'' police said.
   They said a group of 15 guerrillas entered the town of San Juan
de Iscos, 140 miles east of Lima, before dawn Wednesday, dragged
the vice mayor from his home and shot him in the town square.
   The same guerrillas gunned down the vice mayor of Ahuac on
Monday night, police said, and set fire to the library in the
village 130 miles east of Lima.
   Both vice mayors were members of the Democratic Front, the
coalition of center-right parties supporting Vargas Llosa in the
presidential elections scheduled for April 8.
   The Shining Path took up arms against Peru's elected center-left
government in 1980. The government says more than 17,500 people
have died in the violence, including police, soldiers, rebels,
government officials and civilians.

   In the drug trade, they're known as swallowers
or mules _ drug carriers who ingest condoms packed with cocaine or
heroin. Federal authorities weren't surprised that two turned up
among the survivors of Avianca Flight 52.
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if more turned up,'' said Tony
Contorno, supervisory U.S. Customs inspector at John F. Kennedy
International Airport. ``My first thought was how many internals
would turn up on the flight.''
   Authorities say the use of mules is on the increase, mostly
among Colombians bringing in cocaine and West Africans transporting
heroin.
   In the past four months, 59 swallowers carrying 95 pounds of
drugs have been arrested at Kennedy, Contorno said. During the 12
months before that, there were 110 arrests with 155 pounds seized.
Most of them carry drugs more than 90 percent pure, officials said
Wednesday.
   ``We've seen a definite increase,'' said Drug Enforcement
Administration spokeswoman Mary Cooper, who estimated every
Colombian flight included three or four swallowers. ``It's a pretty
common practice. We've seen it for years.''
   Some of the stories are mind-boggling. Several years ago, a man
was found with 445 condoms in his system; last year, a man loaded
with 4.6 pounds of cocaine was arrested. Customs agents spent 23
days at the hospital with one suspect until he passed all the drugs
he carried.
   The carriers are likely able to swallow such large amounts by
anesthetizing their throats and sliding the condoms down, said Dr.
Faroque Khan, chairman of the department of medicine at the Nassau
County Medical Center.
   ``This is the hardest method for us to detect. And the people
involved are becoming a little more sophisticated,'' said Contorno,
one of 60 customs agents checking out an average 100 international
flights each day. Many of the mules make multiple trips carrying
drugs, officials said.
   Potential swallowers are identified by customs agents through
questioning, said Contorno. They are then taken to hospitals for
X-rays. Contorno said the agents' success rate is 65 percent to 70
percent.
   The use of mules was splashed across newspapers and television
after last week's Avianca crash on Long Island, when two of the
surviving passengers attracted police attention.
   The two _ Jose Orlando Figeroa, 31, and Antonio Zaluaga, 46 _
remained under police guard Wednesday at two hospitals. Both will
be arrested on drug charges upon their release from the hospital,
said Nassau County police spokesman Officer James Higgins.
   Zaluaga passed 19 condoms filled with white powder at the Nassau
County Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ed Smith. Figeroa's
case was more dramatic _ doctors at North Shore University
Hospital, trying to stop internal bleeding after the crash, removed
four allegedly drug-filled condoms from his bowel. The man has
since passed 10 more.
   The mules _ who make about $3,000 or receive a U.S. visa for
transporting up to $1 million in drugs _ don't run as much of a
risk as they did in the early 1980s when the practice started, said
Contorno. Better wrapping materials make it unlikely the condoms
will give way.
   But if they do burst, the result is fast and final _ ``instant
death,'' said Khan. ``A doctor can't get in fast enough to get it
out.''

   A High Court judge awarded $422,000 in damages to
a stuntman who claimed his career was ended by injuries caused in a
fall during the filming of the movie ``Superman IV.''
   London Cannon Films Ltd. admitted liability.
   But John Lees, 47, said the award doesn't make up for the
injuries he suffered when harness wires snapped and he fell 25 feet.
   ``My career as a stuntman is over,'' said Lees, whose heels and
left ankle were broken. He was unable under British law to specify
to the court how much he wanted in damages.
   His lawyer told the court Lees has undergone surgery and
physiotherapy but is permanently disabled and cannot sit or stand
for long without discomfort.
   When the 1986 accident happened, Lees was simulating flying as
the double for Nuclear Man, a villain ready to wipe the world.
   ``Superman IV'' was filmed in Hertfordshire, 14 miles north of
London.
   Lees previously worked as a stunt double in ``Flash Gordon'' and
the James Bond film ``For Your Eyes Only.''

   A man arrested for deserting from the Army
nearly 30 years ago knew he might be picked up at the airport when
he returned to the United States from East Germany. But 30
relatives who came to greet him were stunned.
   ``I think this must be what it was like in East Germany before
the wall came down,'' said Arnold Kephart's sister, Alice Smith.
``We do live in a free country, or so we thought.''
   Kephart, 53, was being held at the Fort Riley, Kan., Army base
Wednesday on a warrant charging him with desertion.
   He was arrested Tuesday night at Eppley Airfield by military and
civilian police as relatives looked on. Kephart was allowed to talk
to his 86-year-old father and sister before being taken away.
   Some family members came from as far away as Arkansas to greet
Kephart, who was accompanied by his son, Frankie, and who,
according to his attorney, had tried to escape from East Germany
several times.
   Kephart believed he might be arrested at the airport, said Mrs.
Smith's husband, Roy.
   ``We thought it was a possibility, but we didn't think it would
be handled in this manner,'' Smith said. ``... They just took him
off the plane.''
   Kephart's attorney, James Martin Davis, said military police
didn't show him an arrest warrant and wouldn't allow him to speak
to his client until civilian police intervened.
   ``It was an absolute worst-case scenario for the image of the
United States military,'' Davis said. Kephart and his son ``thought
they'd left a totalitarian country,'' he said.
   An Army spokesman said he wasn't aware of all the circumstances
surrounding the arrest, but defended the Army's action.
   ``How many ways can you arrest somebody?'' Lt. Col. Dick Bridges
said in a telephone interview from Washington.
   Kephart was scheduled to be transferred today to Fort Sill,
Okla., said Capt. Ed Garven, a Fort Riley spokesman.
   If convicted of desertion by a court-martial, Kephart could
receive up to three years in prison, Lt. Col. John Dobbs said from
Fort Sill. He also could receive a less-than-honorable discharge
without undergoing a court-martial.
   As of Dec. 31, 1989, the Army had 2,595 names on its list of
so-called ``active deserters,'' according to Lt. Col. Jack Horn of
Army Personnel Command in Washington.
   Kephart, originally from Langdon, Mo., was declared absent
without leave in November 1960 while a private stationed in
Heidelberg, West Germany, Army officials said. There is no statute
of limitations on the charge, Davis said.
   He apparently deserted after an Army truck he was driving
crashed, Davis said.
   A staff sergeant told Kephart he would be prosecuted, do time in
the stockade and have to pay for the truck on his $69-a-month
salary, the attorney said. The sergeant lied, but Kephart believed
him and fled with a girlfriend to East Germany, Davis said.
   Kephart panicked because he was 24, in a strange country and
away from home, said Smith.
   After leaving the Army, Kephart worked for 30 years as a truck
driver in the small southern city of Smalkalden. He tried to escape
three or four times but was caught at the border, Davis said.
   His family thought he was dead because the Army would not give
details of his whereabouts or disappearance, but learned he was
alive about a year after he vanished when they received a letter.
   Only three or four censored letters reached his family over the
years, Davis said.
   While in East Germany, Kephart was married and divorced twice.
His second wife gave birth to Frankie on Oct. 27, 1977. Kephart
received custody of Frankie after the divorce.
   Kephart decided to return to the United States with his son
after hearing about the opening of East Germany's borders late last
year, Davis said.
   He arrived in Hamburg, West Germany on Dec. 15 and worked in a
hotel with Frankie for a few weeks until he contacted his family.
   Kephart's son, who doesn't speak a word of English, is staying
with relative in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Smith said.
   ``He's taking it well to tell you the truth,'' he said. ``I'm
surprised. He's a very brave boy.''

<HEAD>Fluoride Safe Despite Study Suggesting Cancer Link, Dental Experts
Say</HEAD>

   A study has found a possible link between
fluoride and cancer in rats, but dental experts said previous
research gives strong evidence that fluoridated water is safe.
   ``You have to sort of consider that one study in relation to
many others that have been carried out,'' said Colin Dawes, editor
of the Journal of Dental Research.
   ``There's no material that's been added to the diet or water
that's been more thoroughly tested than fluoride, in terms of its
potential toxicological effects,'' he said.
   The evidence against its causing cancer is overwhelming, said
Dawes, professor of oral biology at the University of Manitoba. His
journal is an official publication of the International Association
for Dental Research.
   Dawes and other experts interviewed Wednesday were reacting to
news that federal researchers had found cases of osteosarcoma, a
form of bone cancer, in some rats fed high doses of fluoridated
water.
   One rat in a group of 50 developed the cancer after drinking
water with 45 parts per million of fluoride over two years, while
four rats in another group developed it after drinking 79 parts per
million during the period.
   Those concentrations are much higher than the average 1 part per
million many communities put in their water to protect against
cavities. High doses of potential cancer-causing substances are
routinely used in rodent experiments to expose any effects.
   Osteosarcoma is uncommon in humans, with about 700 new cases a
year.
   An estimated 132 million Americans, about 53 percent of the
population, drink water with enough flouride to fight cavities,
according to the National Institute of Dental Research.
   Dental experts interviewed by The Associated Press said they
could not comment on the new study itself because they had not seen
the work, which is still preliminary and has not yet been released
by the government.
   But Gary Whitford of the Medical College of Georgia, who studies
side effects of fluoride, said previous research gives no evidence
of a link to cancer.
   He participated in a study that found no harm when rats were fed
high fluoride doses in the form of toothpaste daily for 18 months,
he said.
   Asked if the federal study made him worry about the possibility
of the substance causing cancer, he replied, ``I have no reason to
think that that's a realistic possibility.''
   He said he was concerned that the news might make some
communities remove fluoride from their water supplies, boosting
risk of cavities.
   Benefits of fluoridated water have been questioned in recent
years. Australian researcher Mark Diesendorf wrote in the science
journal Nature in 1986 that non-fluoridated communities in Europe
and elsewhere have shown reductions in cavities that are comparable
to declines in fluoridated communities.
   He suggested that fluoridation may have had only a minor effect
at best in reducing cavities, and that greater impact may have come
from other factors such as changes in diet patterns and, in some
cases, use of fluoridated toothpaste.
   Dawes said that at a recent international conference of fluoride
experts, ``the general feeling was that fluoride in water is still
beneficial, (although) not as beneficial as it used to be when
there was no fluoridated toothpaste.''
   Ken Burrell, secretary of the American Dental Association's
Council on Dental Therapeutics, said fluoridated water especially
helps young children whose teeth are forming. They appear to get a
long-lasting benefit, he said.

   President F.W. de Klerk
reversed himself Wednesday and ordered a judicial inquiry into
allegations that police carried out authorized killings of
anti-apartheid activists.
   He called for a separate investigation of the death of a
20-year-old black man found hanged in his prison cell. The man,
Clayton Sithole, was closely associated with the family of
imprisoned black leader Nelson Mandela.
   Newspapers said de Klerk would meet with Mandela on Thursday,
the day before delivering a major address to Parliament.
   A luxury car was seen arriving at the Victor Verster prison farm
where Mandela lives at 4:30 a.m. Thursday (9:30 p.m. EST
Wednesday), then driving away at high speed across the countryside
after meeting up with another car and minibus on the road outside
the prison.
   Journalists following the cars were chased away by the
authorities. No other details were immediately available.
   Their meeting wouldn't be the first between the black leader and
the South African president. Mandela and De Klerk met last Dec. 13
at the president's office in Cape Town.
   The Cape Times and Business Day, citing government sources they
did not identify, said the meeting probably would influence de
Klerk's speech, which is expected to outline his plans for reform.
   De Klerk is expected to release Mandela within weeks. The
nation's best-known black leader, now 71, has spent more than 27
years in prison for his role in planning the guerrilla campaign of
the African National Congress, the main black group fighting white
domination.
   Mandela's release is seen as necessary before black leaders will
negotiate with the government. There has been an increase in
political unrest recently, however, and the government fears
releasing him could lead to violence among the disenfranchised
black majority.
   De Klerk's decision to investigate the alleged police hit squads
comes less than two months after he refused to appoint such a
commission. The controversy began late last year when three former
policemen said they participated in killings of government
opponents under authorization of their superiors.
   Police have denied the existence of any hit squads.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said de Klerk appointed Supreme
Court Judge L.T.C. Harms to investigate ``the alleged incidence of
murders ... in order to achieve, effect or promote constitutional
or political aims.''
   ``In a number of cases attorneys-general are considering the
reopening of inquests,'' Coetsee's statement said.
   He said details on how the inquiry is to be carried out would be
published soon in the official government gazette.
   An anti-apartheid group that has demanded an inquiry into the
alleged death squads welcomed the move and called off a Thursday
protest planned for Cape Town.
   ``The minister's announcement shows that ordinary concerned
South Africans can have influence on government decisions if they
display the courage of their convictions,'' said the Campaign for a
Judicial Inquiry into Hit Squads.
   Activists have alleged for years that government security forces
were involved in the unsolved killings of more than 60
anti-apartheid figures.
   On Oct. 19, the night before he was scheduled to be hanged,
former policeman Butana Almond Nofomela gave an affidavit saying he
was part of a police death squad.
   Nofomela, a black who was on death row for a killing with no
apparent political overtones, identified two former policemen he
said also participated in the killings.
   The men, Dirk Coetzee, a white former captain, and David
Tshikalanga, who is black, have fled South Africa and confessed to
participation in at least 10 killings.
   Coetzee was scheduled to give a press conference Thursday in
Harare, Zimbabwe, and was expected to make additional allegations
about police involvement in the deaths of activists.
   Nofomela has pleaded guilty to the 1981 stabbing death of an
black anti-apartheid attorney and arrest warrants have been issued
for Coetzee and Tshikalanga in the same case.
   Police said Sithole was found hanging from a shower pipe Tuesday
at John Vorster Square, Johannesburg's central police station.
   Sithole was arrested Friday along with four others accused in
the slayings of 10 people in guerrilla attacks over the past two
years.
   Shortly after his death was announced, de Klerk ordered a
judicial inquiry, a step not taken after scores of previous
incidents in which black activists died while in police custody.
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok expressed condolences to
Sithole's family.
   According to local newspapers, Sithole was a former lover of
Zindzi Mandela and fathered one of her three children. There was no
immediate comment from the Mandelas, but associates of the family
said they believed the report was accurate.
   A family friend of the Mandelas, who requested anonymity, said
Sithole belonged to a controversial group of young men who served
as Winnie Mandela's bodyguards. Nine people associated with the
group have been in custody for months awaiting trial for the death
of a young black activist.
   Neither Vlok nor de Klerk indicated whether the decision to
launch an investigation was related to Sithole's reported
connection to the Mandela family.
   Denis Worrall, co-leader of the anti-apartheid Democratic Party,
welcomed de Klerk's swift response.
   ``It is surprising that President de Klerk would do this,''
Worrall said. ``I'm quite sure that a judicial commission of
inquiry would be justified.''
   Audrey Coleman, a prominent human rights activist, said
Sithole's family suspected the young man had been mistreated and
would obtain its own pathologist to conduct an independent post
mortem.
   Police said Sithole confessed to a magistrate before his death,
implicating himself in several killings. Police reportedly were
investigating whether Sithole and the other suspects were ANC
guerrillas.
   About 100 ANC guerrillas and anti-apartheid activists have died
in police custody the past 25 years.
   According to police, suicide by hanging has been the most common
cause of these deaths, but human rights groups have insisted
interrogators mistreated many of these prisoners.

<HEAD>Panel Delays Vote on Controversial Energy Nominee</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush's nominee to head the nation's
troubled atomic weapons complex is faltering amid a newly disclosed
investigation of an allegation that he lied to Congress.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee delayed indefinitely
Wednesday's scheduled vote on the nomination of Victor Stello Jr.,
a former top nuclear power regulator, to become assistant secretary
of energy for defense programs.
   Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and ranking Republican John
Warner of Virginia recommended the delay after the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission's inspector general told them his office is
investigating Stello.
   ``We did not know how serious the allegations were regarding Mr.
Stello,'' Nunn told reporters after a closed committee meeting
Wednesday. ``The committee voted not to come to a conclusion or
vote ... until such time that we have at least an oral report from
the IG (inspector general).''
   Rep. Peter Kostmayer, D-Pa., has accused Stello, the NRC's
former executive director, of making ``willful misstatements'' last
fall to the House Interior Committee's investigations subcommittee
that Kostmayer chairs.
   Nunn said NRC Inspector General David C. Williams has said the
investigation should be completed by April. Stello, the NRC's
former executive staff director, is now hospitalized as the result
of a skiing accident Jan. 10.
   In the meantime, Nunn said he is not leaning for or against the
nomination. ``I'm going to wait until all the information is in,''
he said.
   Not since Bush's ill-fated choice a year ago of former Sen. John
Tower, R-Texas, to become secretary of defense has the armed
services panel been so divided on a presidential nomination.
   Environmentalists and anti-nuclear activists and their allies on
the committee, led by Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., accuse Stello of
being too close to the nuclear industry to effectively supervise
operation of the weapons complex.
   The administration is showing no inclination to withdraw the
nomination of Stello, who was picked for the job by White House
chief of staff John Sununu, a vehement supporter of nuclear power.
   In a letter to the committee Tuesday, Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins said he continues to have ``full confidence'' in Stello,
who, in the absence of confirmation, is acting as Watkins'
principal deputy in charge of the weapons program.
   ``No facts have been brought to my attention at this time which
are not already part of the record before your committee,'' Watkins
said.
   Kostmayer's allegation centers on Stello's approval in 1988 of
$6,000 to a technician at the Nine Mile Point nuclear power plant
in New York state. The technician had alleged that NRC investigator
Roger Fortuna was leaking confidential information to anti-nuclear
activists.
   They and some NRC officials have maintained that the payment to
the technician, as an informant, was part of a vindictive campaign
Stello waged against Fortuna, who was later fired, rehired and
demoted.
   ``One issue which will be addressed ... concerns Mr. Victor
Stello's involvement in the Fortuna matter and statements made by
him to Congress concerning that involvement,'' the NRC's Williams
wrote Nunn on Tuesday.
   The technician, Douglas Ellison, had claimed that Fortuna
mishandled an investigation into alleged drug use, reported fires
and falsified documents at the Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. plant.
   Stello has defended the payment to Ellison, saying his
``overriding concern was to assure public health and safety''
before the plant was allowed by the commission to restart following
a lengthy shutdown.

   Here, at a glance, are the highlights of
President Bush's State of the Union address:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EAST-WEST RELATIONS: Bush saluted changes in Eastern Europe as
``the revolution of '89'' and said the crumbling of hardline
communist governments should open the way for more U.S. and Soviet
troop cuts in the region.
   He proposed cutting forces in the ``Central Front'' area to
195,000 per side _ down from 265,000 U.S. troops and 565,000 Soviet
troops there now.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PANAMA: Some 4,000 remaining additional U.S. troops will be
brought home from Panama ``well before the end of February,''
leaving the U.S. presence at the pre-invasion level of about 13,000
troops.
   At the peak of the U.S. intervention last month, 27,000 U.S.
troops were there. The United States already has brought 10,000
home.
   ``Democracy is restored, Panama is free,'' Bush declared to a
standing ovation.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EDUCATION: Goals include an attempt to make U.S. students
``first in the world in math and science'' by the year 2000 and
increase the high school graduation rate to ``no less than 90
percent.'' Now only about 70 percent graduate on time.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SOCIAL SECURITY: Bush brushed off a proposal by Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan to reduce Social Security taxes, saying ``the last
thing we need to do is mess around with Social Security.'' He
mentioned in passing his proposal to use surplus Social Security
funds to help pay off the national debt _ but only after the budget
is balanced, supposedly in 1993.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   RACISM: Bush said the nation ``must confront and condemn racism,
anti-Semitism, bigotry and hate.'' He said he had been ``appalled
at the recent mail bombings across our country.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   UNFINISHED AGENDA: Bush prodded the Democratic-controlled
Congress to act on measures he proposed last year that are still
languishing, asserting ``it's time to act together.'' He mentioned
his battle for a lower capital gains tax rate and child care,
anti-crime, housing and environmental proposals.

   HEALTH CARE: He said Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan would lead a Cabinet-level review of ``the quality,

<HEAD>Second Generic High Blood Pressure Drug Recalled</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a House investigations
subcommittee wants the government to ensure that a lower-priced
medicine for high blood pressure is available, now that both
generic versions are off the market.
   The second of two generic versions of SmithKline Beecham's
Dyazide was recalled Wednesday by its maker, Bolar Pharmaceutical
Co. Inc., which is under fire for allegedly giving false test data
to the Food and Drug Administration.
   Bolar also said it was recalling its 100 milligram
extended-release phenytoin sodium capsules, a generic version of
the epilepsy drug Dilantin made by Parke-Davis.
   The company said ``the products' bioequivalence (to the
brand-name drugs) cannot be assured in light of serious questions
concerning the accuracy and reliability of the documentation''
supporting FDA approval of Bolar's drugs.
   The FDA said patients taking the two generic drugs being
recalled ``should consult with their physicians and are urged not
to stop taking either medication abruptly.''
   The agency advised patients taking Bolar's generic Dyazide to
continue taking the drug until their prescription runs out and to
arrange with their physicians to take another medication. Patients
on Bolar's phenytoin should consult with their physician ``in the
next few days'' about changing drugs, it said.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce investigations subcommittee, said in a letter to FDA
Acting Commissioner James Benson, ``unfortunately, the consumer
stands to be the principal victim.''
   Dingell said he asked SmithKline Beecham, maker of Dyazide, to
cut the price of its product when allegations against the makers of
its generic competitors surfaced. The company raised the price of
Dyazide after Bolar's generic version came on the market in 1987.
   In the absence of a price cut, Dingell said, the FDA should
consider several options, including requiring SmithKline to
reformulate the drug so that it is easier to copy in a generic form.
   Jeremy Heymsfeld, a spokesman for SmithKline Beecham, said
Bolar's recall ``represents a significant change in the
marketplace. We have not seen Congressman Dingell's statement. We
take seriously our responsibilities to all our publics: our
shareholders, our customers and the patients who use our products.
We plan to respond accordingly.''
   Dingell said, ``For the millions of Americans without health
insurance or those with minimal prescription drug reimbursement
plans, the cost of a drug which is the most common treatment for
high blood pressure is critical.''
   Dingell worried that ``price considerations may cause many to
discontinue the treatment without consulting their physician.''
   Last spring, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of Springfield Gardens,
N.Y., took its version of Dyazide off the market after it admitted
cheating on FDA tests.
   The FDA had been trying to remove Bolar's generic Dyazide, a
combination of triamterene and hydrochlorothiazide, from the market
because of questions about its therapeutic equivalence to the
brand-name drug.
   Last week, lawyers representing Bolar told the FDA the company
appeared to have used false documents to challenge FDA action
against the company's generic Dyazide.
   Two days after the lawyers' concerns were made public, the
Securities and Exchange Commission temporarily suspended trading of
Bolar securities, citing a ``lack of adequate current
information.'' The suspension in trading began last Thursday and
was to continue through this week through Saturday.
   Bolar's version of Dyazide was the company's largest selling
product and accounted for about half of its pre-tax income. The
absence of sales of this product ``will have a material adverse
effect on earnings,'' Bolar said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Christmas freeze that hit major vegetable
areas of the South is responsible for a sharp increase in the
Agriculture Department's price index for raw farm products,
according to preliminary figures.
   Department officials said Wednesday the overall index received
by farmers rose 2.7 percent from December to January, leaving the
monthly average also 2.7 percent above the year-ago level.
   Higher prices for tomatoes, lettuce and broilers mostly were
responsible for the increase from December, the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report.
   ``Tomato prices more than doubled due to short supplies brought
on by the freeze in Florida in December,'' the report said.
``Lettuce prices were nearly double for the same reason.''
   Commercial vegetables as a group were up 68 percent from
December and 32 percent from a year ago.
   Lower prices were reported for soybeans, strawberries and
oranges.
   Milk prices at the farm, which had risen to record levels late
last year, were unchanged in January. Department dairy economists
have forecast milk prices would level off this year.
   Prices paid by farmers to meet expenses, meanwhile, were up 1.1
percent from October, the previous reading, and averaged 2.9
percent above a year ago, the report said. The ``prices paid''
index is revised every three months.
   The report said prices for feeder cattle and calves, feeder
pigs, diesel fuel and LP gas were up from October.
   Department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990
may be in the range of $52 billion to $57 billion, compared with
about $53 billion in 1989.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
1990 net farm income may be in the range of $44 billion to $49
billion, compared with $48 billion last year.
   Consumer food prices are estimated by department economists to
have risen about 5.7 percent this year, the sharpest rise since
1981. They project food prices may rise 3 percent to 5 percent in
1990.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the January price index for
livestock and poultry was unchanged from December but averaged 7.6
percent more than a year ago.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 6.3 percent from December but
averaged 4.3 percent below a year ago. The sharp rise in the price
of commercial vegetables caused most of the increase from December,
the report said.
   The fruit index dropped 9.3 percent from December and was 9.8
percent below a year earlier.
   ``All fruit prices used in the index were down from last month
except for apples and lemons which were up slightly,'' the report
said. ``Oranges and strawberries had the largest downward influence
on the index.''

   A new oilseed lobbying group has urged
legislation to guarantee farmers a larger choice in what they
produce under federal crop programs.
   The Oilseed Council of America said Wednesday that ``genuine
planting flexibility'' would help solve a decline in the
competitiveness of the U.S. oilseed industry. Oilseeds are led by
soybeans, but also include cottonseed, sunflowers and canola.
   Lowell Wilson of Primghar, Iowa, co-chairman of the council,
said current commodity programs have ``dramatically reduced acreage
planted to oilseeds by requiring producers to plant commodities
supported by target prices'' to protect crop program base acreages
used to compute benefits.
   Wilson said there is genuine planting flexibility when federal
programs are neutral in their effect on farmers' planting decisions.
   According to a study released in Washington by the council,
demand for protein meal and oil produced when oilseeds are crushed
is growing at the rate of 4 percent a year. World trade in oilseeds
and their products, the report said, has increased twice as fast as
trade in wheat and feed grains.
   Despite the growth, the study reported the U.S. share of global
oilseed production has dropped to 24 percent from 39 percent six
years ago, and that the U.S. share of oilseed trade has declined to
45 percent from 75 percent.
   Floyd Anderson of Bismarck, N.D., president of the National
Sunflowerseed Association and co-chairman of the council, said
planting flexibility would let farmers take advantage of the world
demand for oilseeds by basing planting decisions on market
situations as well as natural factors.
   The formation of the group coincides with moves in Congress to
write new farm legislation to replace the 1985 law, which expires
at the end of the 1990 crop season.
   But Anderson said in a statement the council does not advocate
any specific programs and that there are a number of policy
approaches that will give producers ``genuine planting
flexibility'' and continue farm income protection.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says
rice farmers will have to idle only 20 percent of their acreage
base to qualify for this year's price support program instead of
the 22.5 percent announced on Jan. 3.
   Yeutter said Wednesday the lower set-aside, which means farmers
can plant more for the 1990 harvest, was decided after reviewing
recent projected rice supply and demand figures.
   The figures showed the U.S. rice inventory will be drawn down to
19 million hundredweight by Aug. 1, the lowest reserve at the start
of a new rice marketing year since the 1980 crop. The inventory
last Aug. 1 was 26.7 million.

<HEAD>Coalition Opposes Capital Gains Tax Cut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of labor and social organizations
called on taxpayers today to stage their own Boston Tea Party and
mail Congress envelopes of crumbs to protest President Bush's
proposed capital gains tax cut.
   The theme of the campaign would be, ``A capital gains tax cut is
a crummy idea,'' according to Citizens for Tax Justice.
   The nonprofit coalition of labor, citizen and social groups
played a major role in passage of the 1986 tax overhaul and
includes organizations claiming 20 million members.
   ``Restoring the capital gains loophole would be cake for the
rich but crumbs for the rest of us,'' Robert S. McIntyre, director
of Citizens for Tax Justice, said in launching the campaign.
   If the campaign catches on, members of Congress could expect to
be swamped with cookie remnants and letters declaring: ``While
you're giving the wealthy the whole pie, you're leaving most
Americans with nothing but crumbs. So you can have my crumbs back,
because I'm tired of paying higher taxes to give tax cuts to the
rich.''
   Bush has proposed that capital gains _ profits from the sale of
real estate, stock and other investments _ be given preferential
tax treatment compared with wages and other incomes.
   The plan the president outlined Monday would, when fully
effective in 1993, tax only 70 percent of the profits from the sale
of assets owned three years or more; 80 percent of assets owned
more than two years, and 90 percent of profits from the sale of
property held at least one year. Present law taxes 100 percent of
gains.
   Bush said a tax break for capital gains would encourage
investment that would create jobs and make U.S. businesses more
competitive abroad.
   The House passed a capital gains tax cut last year, but
Democratic leaders were able to kill it in the Senate even though
most senators favored it.
   Opponents say 80 percent of the benefits from a capital gains
cut would go to people with incomes over $100,000 a year. They
contend it would worsen the budget deficit and lead to the undoing
of the 1986 tax overhaul.
   The coalition expects to distribute more than 10 million
brochures and addressed envelopes in February and March in an
attempt to defeat the capital gains reduction.
   In contending that only the truly rich would profit from a
capital gains cut, the campaign letter cites Bush and hotel owner
Leona Helmsley, who was convicted of tax evasion, as examples.
   Mrs. Helmsley and her husband, Harry, saved $38 million in taxes
in 1983 through 1985 because of an earlier capital gains break, the
letter says. In 1986, Bush saved $129,000 in taxes because of his
capital gains.
   The 58 organizations sponsoring the protest include the AFL-CIO,
Children's Defense Fund, Consumer Federation of America and an arm
of the United Church of Christ.

<HEAD>Pension Investigators Ill-Equipped for Their Job, Watchdog Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Department officers who police the
nation's pension system are ``poorly equipped'' for their job, says
the department's inspector general in questioning plans to add 100
agents to the unit.
   The officers don't ``have the mentality and the learning curve
to know how to look and where to look'' for racketeers, Acting
Inspector General Raymond Maria said Wednesday before a House panel
studying the nation's $1.7 trillion private pension system.
   ``These types of complex cases generally require tips,
informants and the execution of search warrants,'' Maria said,
adding the department's officers are ``poorly equipped for these
tasks.''
   But David Ball, who heads the department's Pension Benefits and
Welfare Administration, said those agents have closed 8,268 pension
investigations in the past five years and recovered $480 million.
   The House Education and Labor subcommittee on labor-management
relations is studying enforcement of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act, passed in 1974 to protect retirees from abuses in
their pensions plans.
   Maria and the Labor Department have been feuding over the
department's handling of pension investigations.
   Maria, who will not be permanently named to the inspector
general's post, has insisted the department improperly relies on
civil instead of criminal remedies and that problems with the
pension system rival those blamed for the savings and loan crisis.
   Ball called the comparison to the S&amp;L crisis ``inflammatory
rhetoric ... It's like shouting fire in a crowded theater.''
   Ball said the pension system, with assets that have grown from
$290 billion to $1.7 trillion over the past 15 years, has ``never
been healthier.'' He said there has been no evidence of widespread
fraud in benefit plans.
   After the hearing, Maria said he was skeptical of department
plans to add 100 enforcement officers without a change in the way
investigations are pursued.
   ``If you don't have a sound game plan, why add more players?''
Maria said.
   The Labor Department's budget request for fiscal 1991 calls for
increasing from 200 to 300 the number of pension enforcement.
   Ball said the addition of 100 enforcement officers would let the
agency conduct an additional 1,000 investigations. He defended the
department's pursuit of civil remedies and said criminal
investigations are turned over to the Justice Department, where he
said they belong.
   Using what will be one of his last appearances before Congress
as acting inspector general _ President Bush is expected to
nominate a replacement within a week or so _ Maria said department
enforcement officers have not been trained to investigate
``professional racketeers.''
   Maria also renewed his criticism of a Justice Department ruling
that curtailed the investigative powers of inspectors general.
   The ruling prohibited the inspectors general from launching
their own investigations of alleged violations of agency
regulations. In essence, the ruling said the departments themselves
were responsible for such enforcement and that the role of
inspectors general was to investigate and analyze the departments'
efforts.
   Maria wants Congress to pass legislation giving inspectors
general broader powers and jurisdictions.

<HEAD>Eased Voter Registration Bill Moving in House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill to ease voter registration procedures
across the country is moving forward in the House despite
Republican warnings that it could generate fraud and complaints
about the price tag.
   ``Let's look before we leap and we're leaping here today,'' Rep.
Gerald B.H. Solomon, R-N.Y., said Wednesday as the House moved a
step closer to floor action on the so-called motor-voter
legislation.
   The bill calls for automatic registration of all eligible
Americans applying for drivers' licenses. It also would mean
registration by post card and at various government offices.
   The House, in a key procedural vote on Wednesday, upheld by
254-166 a rule requiring critics led by GOP Leader Bob Michel of
Illinois to tie together all of their proposed amendments to the
measure in one batch.
   The rule then provides for a single vote on the entire bundle of
proposed amendments on Tuesday when the House is scheduled to take
up the bill.
   Mainly Republican critics chafed at the rule, urging the House
instead to junk all restrictions on how amendments may be offered.
Their way would give individual amendments a better chance of
acceptance by the House and also slow action on the bill.
   The bill emerged from the House Government Operations Committee
last year with support from a number of Republicans, including Whip
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif. Sponsors
hailed a new era of harmony on an issue that once spawned feuding
between the parties.
   But feuding was in full swing on the House floor Wednesday with
Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., a chief sponsor, accusing Michel of
violating bipartisan harmony.
   ``On Monday, the minority leader swooped into town and trashed
the entire agreement,'' Swift said.
   Swift blamed Michel for the collapse of what he called a
bipartisan agreement fashioned in the Government Operations
Committee. A number of Republicans had backed the measure.
   Michel replied that he ``may have to share some of the blame for
missed communication on my side ... I'm sorry the gentleman should
have this feeling because, boy, there was nothing intended on my
part to gut the gentleman and turn things on their head here.''
   Rep. James Quillen, R-Tenn., publicly read a letter from the
Bush administration on Tuesday, saying it shares the goal of eased
voter registration but has qualms about the bill's specifics,
including whether it could cause fraud.
   Proponents say voter registration remains an obstacle course in
some states and thus dampens turnout.
   Republicans trooped to the microphones to complain about the
rule regarding amendments, saying they needed more maneuvering room
to combat burdensome procedures and high costs. And Rep. Lynn
Martin, R-Ill., made clear she had no quarrel with the Bush
administration's warning against a potential surge in fraud.
   ``I'm sure there are people in the United States where, if you
tell them they can have motor voter registration, they'll be
registering people in hearses before they get to the cemetery
even,'' she said.

   The husband of a woman who committed
suicide waited to see the Super Bowl in his mother-in-law's home
before reporting the death, authorities said.
   Gary L. Holloway told police his wife, Mary Helen Holloway, shot
herself in the head after an argument, authorities said.
   The Clayton County medical examiner on Wednesday ruled the
shooting a suicide.
   ``I can't explain this wild story. That game was so boring,''
said Jim Mabe, a medical examiner investigator.
   ``He was possibly a little intoxicated at the time, and maybe
shocked,'' Detective Chris Butler said.
   Holloway's attorney, Charles Wrinkle, said Holloway was too
upset to bring himself to tell his mother-in-law about the shooting.
   ``He just wasn't able to do it. He just didn't know what to do.
It's not something you plan for,'' Wrinkle said.

   Actor Gary Coleman defeated his mother's
effort to take control of his $7 million fortune, despite her claim
that she only wanted the best for the diminutive 21-year-old.
   Edmonia Sue Coleman had asked a court conservator to take over
Coleman's finances, saying the former ``Diff'rent Strokes'' star
was unable to make decisions rationally because of the effects of a
kidney disease and what she viewed as the bad influence of a close
friend.
   But on Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Martha Goldin disagreed.
   ``The very things you claim he doesn't have, he's got,'' Goldin
told an attorney for Coleman's mother.
   Coleman's attorney, Charles Wake, said the actor was pleased.
   ``It was an emotional experience for him,'' said Wake.
   Coleman, who played the precocious Arnold Jackson on the hit TV
show, has filed a separate lawsuit alleging his parents and former
business manager mishandled his money and funneled away more than
$1 million for themselves. The lawsuit has yet to come to trial.
   Coleman's mother said she is worried that her son is getting
poor advice from his friend and former chauffeur, Dion Mial, with
whom he lives in Denver.
   ``Gary is my son and I love him very much, regardless of what
Mr. Wake says,'' said Mrs. Coleman. ``And what I have done has been
in Gary's best interest.''
   Coleman was born with an atrophied right kidney and lost the
other one when he was 5. He took immunosuppressive drugs for his
condition and they stunted his growth at 4 feet, 8 inches.

   Lily Tomlin, who gained national fame in the early
1970s on the TV show ``Laugh-In,'' says her career became more
interesting when she began her ``Search for Signs of Intelligent
Life in the Universe.''
   Tomlin, who also has appeared in several movies, starred in the
play on Broadway from 1986 to 1988, winning the Tony Award for best
actress. She decided to take the show back on the road, including a
two-week run in Denver.
   Tomlin portrays a variety of characters in the play, each of
whom searches for meaning in their lives and the lives of those
around them. Their collective search, handled deftly with humor and
honesty in Jane Wagner's script, emulates real life, Tomlin said
Wednesday.
   ``The play is so human, so funny ... it's moving, satiric,
sharp, insightful, compassionate. Everybody sees someone they know
in the characters,'' she said. ``It's challenging and so tough to
do. But I love this play. It shows me the best of anything so far.''

   Jazz guitarist George Benson gave a pep talk
to a would-be musician suffering a rare form of cancer. Then he
backed up the kind words with a valuable gift.
   When 22-year-old David Romito talked with Benson after a show
here last fall, it gave him hope.
   ``Benson talked with me a long time,'' Romito said this week.
``He knew I was sick, of course, and said he knew somebody who once
was given only six weeks to live _ and the person is still living
10 years later.''
   Romito admired Benson's guitar, a six-string Ibanez, and the
singer offered to send him an identical one. The instrument arrived
at Romito's home last month, he said.
   Romito plays guitar, sings and writes music. He was diagnosed in
1985 with rhabdomyosarcoma, a muscular cancer, but says he's
continuing to focus on his musical career.

   A composer who claims Julio Iglesias defrauded her
out of royalties for a song they co-wrote more than a decade ago
sued the Spanish singer for more than $50,000.
   In the lawsuit, Grecia ``Mimi'' Korman says Iglesias asked her
in 1978 to write a Spanish adaptation of a French song, and she
incorporated some lyrics Iglesias had written into her version of
``Me Olvide de Vivir,'' or ``I've Forgotten to Live.''
   ``Me Olvide de Vivir'' has appeared on at least seven of
Iglesias' albums, with Ms. Korman and Iglesias listed as the song's
writers, the lawsuit says.
   But Iglesias entered into a contract with the French publishers
of the song, presenting himself as the sole author and securing all
royalties for himself, according to the lawsuit.
   Iglesias' manager, Joaquin Martorell, did not return a message
late Wednesday seeking comment on the federal lawsuit. Iglesias is
a part-time resident of Dade County.

   The prosecutor in the nation's longest
criminal trial says it will be an uphill fight to convict McMartin
Pre-school molestation defendant Raymond Buckey at a new trial, but
the case must be resolved.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner insisted that neither politics nor
public pressure influenced his decision Wednesday to pursue charges
in the 6-year-old case.
   ``This is not a political matter and it is not going to be
treated as such,'' said Reiner, a candidate for California Attorney
General in June's election.
   Buckey and his mother were acquitted Jan. 18 of 52 molestation
counts after a 33-month trial. The jury deadlocked on 12
molestation charges and one conspiracy count against Buckey.
Buckey, 31, will be retried on those charges.
   ``This case has gone on for many years,'' Reiner said. ``It must
be resolved.''
   Prosecutors said at least one child who did not testify at the
first trial might testify at the second, but conceded they might
lose as witnesses one or two of the five children named in the 13
counts. The judge has suggested dropping some of the counts to
speed the March 9 retrial.
   If convicted on all 13 charges, Buckey could draw no more than
36 years in prison, Reiner said. But most defendants serve about
half of their sentences, and Buckey already has been jailed with
bail for five years, the equivalent of a 10-year sentence.
   Buckey said he was surprised by Reiner's decision, but expected
acquittal.
   ``I believe the D.A.'s decision was based on political pressure
from a few vocal parents of children not involved in this trial,
rather than jurors' leaning toward acquittal,'' he said.
   In the two weeks since the acquittals, parents whose children
attended the now-defunct McMartin nursery school mounted a strident
campaign for a new trial. They appeared on TV talk shows, called
news conferences and recruited politicians who vowed to take the
case out of Reiner's hands if he failed to follow through.
   Reiner said his prime consideration was the feelings of parents
and alleged victims, who now range from age 11 to 14{.
   ``This is a positive step for us,'' said Marymae Cioffi, a
McMartin parent who led the campaign to retry Buckey. ``I'm going
to run home and tell my kids we get another chance.''
   Reiner said there remain ``serious evidentiary problems,'' which
he blamed on his predecessor, Robert Philibosian.
   ``This is an uphill battle. There's no question about that,''
Reiner said.
   The former district attorney has said he takes no responsibility
for the case, which he initially filed in 1984, with seven
defendants under investigation.
   Five had charges dismissed after an 18-month preliminary
hearing. Only Buckey, and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, 63,
stood trial.
   The trial was the longest and costliest in U.S. history.
Taxpayers have spent over $13 million on the case so far.
   Superior Court Judge William Pounders said the facts in the
remaining 13 counts ``mitigate in favor of a long second trial.''
He said he hoped the charges could be ``scoped down'' to shorten
the proceedings.
   Pounder urged a swift start because ``the range of emotions is
very high. ... There are a lot of people still sitting in agony. We
should seek an end to this as soon as possible.''
   Buckey's attorney, Danny Davis, filed a motion denouncing the
judge and seeking his removal for bias against him and Buckey.
Another judge will have to rule on that motion, which could cause
delays.

<HEAD>New National Geographic Map of Soviet Union More Political</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new National Geographic map of the Soviet
Union is a more political document that gives a primer of Russian
annexation over the centuries as well as clues to possible future
troubles, the chief cartographer says.
   ``There are still 15 republics and they are still part of the
U.S.S.R.,'' said John B. Garver Jr., chief cartographer of the
National Geographic Society.
   ``But we are very excited at being able to put out a map when
there is a possibility of change,'' he said, referring to unrest
and secessionist movements in several Soviet republics.
   The new map doesn't show the latest protests and battles
involving Soviet nationalities, but its charts, graphs, text and
historical inserts can help readers follow and even predict trouble
for the Kremlin.
   Next to the Soviet Baltic republics, mapmakers added a note in
red ink: ``The United States does not recognize the 1940
incorporation of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.''
   Popular fronts in those republics are agitating to leave the
Soviet Union, against the wishes of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev.
   Adjacent to the Kuril Islands in the Pacific, the map says:
``Formerly part of and still claimed by Japan, the disputed islands
Kunashir, Iturup, Shikotan and the Habomais have been held by the
Soviet Union since 1945.''
   Tokyo has balked at improving relations with Moscow until the
two settle the issue of the islands, which are occupied by Soviet
troops.
   Such disputes are grist in the mill of Garver, a former Army
colonel and West Point professor who is helping shift the focus of
National Geographic magazine to current events.
   The flip side of the new map tells an even more graphic
political tale.
   ``We did away with the pictures and replaced them with a map of
Russian historical annexation over the centuries. It's sort of a
primer,'' said Garver. ``If you read the text and examine the map,
you see that the Soviet Union has expanded, mostly by conquest''
since the 14th century.
   The map shows that over the centuries the princes and czars of
ancient Moscow gobbled up adjoining territories in Europe, Siberia
and Central Asia, and that, at the close of World War II, the
Soviets occupied Eastern Europe and annexed parts of Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Romania.
   A demographic map shows that ethnic Russian colonists spread
East from Moscow, and bar graphs depict some trends from the 1989
Soviet census that are unsettling for the Kremlin.
   The entry under Soviet Tadzhikistan says that ``if current
trends continue ... the U.S.S.R. could be a predominantly Muslim
country within a century,'' trouble for a government that is
officially atheist.
   The bar graphs, Garver said, show ``that the Turkish, Central
Asian and Islamic populations are increasing. The Russian and other
European populations are increasing at a much slower pace.''
   The map took a year to complete, in part because of the need to
reconfirm the location of the 5,000 cities, lakes, rivers and
mountains that dot the 8.6 million square miles of the Soviet
Union. That's more than twice the area of the United States, with
3.6 million square miles.
   Among the most striking changes in the new map is the shrinking
of the Aral Sea, down 40 percent since the last National Geographic
map of the Soviet Union was produced in 1977.
   The Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers that once fed the Aral no
longer flow into it because their waters have been diverted to
irrigate cotton fields.
   The falling water level of the Aral moved it from fourth to
sixth place among the largest lakes of the world, according to the
February edition of National Geographic magazine, which described
it as one of the globe's worst ecological disasters.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court turns 200 today, marking the
bicentennial of what by all accounts was ``indeed a slow start.''
   It took the justices two years to announce their first decision,
and by that time Chief Justice John Jay was moved to call life in
the backwater of Washington ``intolerable.''
   Indeed, the high court couldn't even get a quorum on Feb. 1,
1790. Jay had to put off the court's first meeting until the next
day.
   But it didn't really matter. No case had arrived.
   The 15th man to succeed Jay, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist,
recently acknowledged the court had gotten off to what was ``indeed
a slow start.'' But he said the court ``eventually picked up the
necessary speed to evolve into a truly coequal branch of the
federal government.''
   The Constitution, written in 1787 and ratified by the requisite
number of states the next year, called for ``one supreme court''
but President Washington did not nominate justices to the bench
until late 1789.
   The next February, only three of the six showed up at the Royal
Exchange Building in New York, then the nation's capital.
   One, Justice William Cushing of Massachusetts, appeared in a
powdered wig _ a British judicial custom that failed to catch on in
the new nation.
   The next day, Justice John Blair of Virginia arrived and they
had a quorum. The court appointed a clerk, admitted some lawyers to
practice before it and, after some other administrative chores,
adjourned its first term Feb. 10.
   The second term lasted two days later that year. They were still
waiting for a case.
   These days, a court term lasts nine months or so and presents
some 5,000 new cases.
   The court now announces about 150 decisions each term. Noting
fewer than 70 decisions were issued in the court's first decade,
retired Chief Justice Warren E. Burger said recently, ``I suspect
that members of the court would like the docket to move in that
direction.''
   By the time the court announced its first decision in 1792,
Chief Justice Jay found life in the capital ``intolerable.'' Two
years later, he took a leave of absence from the court to become a
special ambassador to England. In 1795 he quit the court to take
what he considered a more prestigious job, to which he had been
elected during his absence _ governor of New York.
   Much has changed besides the court's caseload in the last two
centuries.
   Since 1869, there have been nine justices. Since 1935, the court
has had its own building. Since 1981, members of the court have not
addressed each other as ``Mr. Justice.'' That ended shortly before
Sandra Day O'Connor joined the bench.
   Other things are as they were when the nation was young.
   The chant that ends with ``God save the United States and this
honorable court'' still opens each session. The brass spittoons are
still hidden behind the bench. Quill pens are still given to each
lawyer appearing before the justices.
   And absent justices can still be a problem. The Supreme Court
held its 200th birthday celebration Jan. 16 because eral members
said they'd be out of town Thursday.

   Most grandfathers are content with describing
the new baby, showing a few pictures, bragging a little. Not George
Bush. He worked little Charles Walker Bush into the script.
   ``When I held the little guy for the first time, the troubles at
home and abroad seemed manageable _ in perspective,'' said the
president, giving a personal touch to his State of the Union speech
Wednesday night.
   In the gallery, proud parents Margaret and Marvin Bush beamed.
And so did Barbara Bush, who became a grandmother for the 12th time
when that son and daughter-in-law adopted the boy late last year.
   ``Now, I know you're thinking that's a grandfather talking,''
said Bush. ``Well, maybe you're right.'' That may have sounded
spontaneous, but it too was in the script.
   In his first State of the Union speech, Bush appeared a little
nervous and hurried. He raced past some of the best lines in the
speech, depriving his Republican supporters of rising in noisy
approval. Not until he was halfway through did that opportunity
come.
   It happened when Bush declared that his budget proposal, sent to
Capitol Hill on Monday, will bring the deficit down and balance the
budget by 1993 ``with no new taxes.''
   The Republicans rose as one. And when there was no response from
the Democrats on the other side of the aisle, they motioned ``get
up, get up.'' A few did, but most stayed put.
   A few minutes later, Bush touched on a sensitive issue, the
attempt by Sen. Daniel Moynihan, a New York Democrat, to cut Social
Security taxes.
   ``The last thing we need to do is mess around with Social
Security,'' said Bush. Republicans shouted, ``Hear, hear,'' and
stood.
   There was a confused silence among the Democrats until some
realized how bad their restraint might look on national television.
Finally, they joined their Republican colleagues in the standing
ovation. Even Moynihan applauded.
   All the senators and congressmen, it seemed, had the speech text
in hand and pages turned in unison. There were no texts for the
hundred members of the diplomatic corps, who left their cars at the
White House and were bused to the Capitol.
   But Soviet Ambassador Yuriy V. Dubinin got a copy from a
reporter he recognized in the White House press pool.
   ``It's much more important to have 100 friends than 100
rubles,'' said the delighted ambassador. ``Now I have the text,
like nearly every lawmaker.''

<HEAD>Military Ruler Says Exiles Can Come Home, Take Part In Free
Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Lt. Gen Prosper Avril says the
political leaders he exiled last month in a crackdown on the
democratic opposition are now free to return and take part in free
elections he's promised for October.
   ``I hope they have learned their lesson,'' Haiti's military
ruler told a news conference Wednesday at the National Palace. Two
days earlier, he had lifted a 10-day state of siege.
   When the emergency was declared on Jan. 20, police rounded up 50
opposition activists. Seven leading government critics were exiled.
Most of the others later were released but said they were beaten,
as did the exiles.
   France, the United States, Canada and the European Community
condemned the crackdown. France, a former colonial ruler and
Haiti's major donor, suspended foreign aid and negotiations for
$500 million more in assistance over the next two years.
   Avril said Wednesday that the crackdown was necessary ``to work
rapidly to disarm'' subversive elements and ``block the escalation
of murder.''
   ``We recognize that things got out of hand'' and police
committed some abuses, Avril said. ``But it is not only in Haiti
that such things occur.''
   The state of siege was declared a day after gunmen killed army
Col. Andre Neptune. Critics accused Avril of orchestrating the
killing to blame it on the opposition and renege on his promises to
hold the fall presidential vote.
   Avril said the exiled opposition leaders can return and ``will
have all necessary guarantees to participate in elections.''
   They include Louis Roy, the principle author of Haiti's
constitution; conservative politician Hubert de Ronceray; prominent
businessman Antoine Izmery; Communist Party deputy leader Max
Bourjolly and three leftist militants.
   Roy, 74, said in a telephone interview from Washington that he
preferred to ``die in exile if necessary. I will never return to
compromise with those whose law is the violation of the
constitution and whose morality is contempt for human dignity.''
   Roy, de Ronceray and Izmery issued a statement in Washington
Tuesday that denounced Avril's ``regime of terror'' and said free
elections were not possible as long as he remained in power in this
impoverished Caribbean nation.
   In an interview with Radio France Internationale monitored in
Puerto Rico, Bourjolly said from Paris earlier this week that he
would return if allowed but would not take part in elections.
   Louis Dejoie, a prominent centrist who traveled to Puerto Rico
the day before the crackdown, said he would not take part in
elections or return to Haiti until Avril steps down.
   ``A singed cat fears the fire. We don't trust Avril or the army
high command. Avril has zero credibility,'' he said.
   Avril said he would not oppose international supervision of
elections. ``We are not hanging on to power,'' he said.
   Several opposition leaders have charged that Avril will rig the
elections.
   The crackdown included a weeklong censorship of radio news. The
censorship was lifted Monday, but by Wednesday only two of eight
private stations in the capital were broadcasting news.
   Avril rose to power in a September 1988 coup led by
noncommissioned officers who professed disgust with the state
terrorism under the military man they ousted, Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy.
   He had led the military junta that assumed power when
President-for-Life Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in
February 1986 during a popular uprising, ending the harsh 27-year
Duvalier dynasty.
   Presidential elections were held on Nov. 29, 1987, but aborted
after thugs, protected by soldiers, massacred at least 34 voters at
polling stations.
   Civilian Leslie Manigat won army-run elections in January 1988
and was overthrown by Namphy that June.

<HEAD>Bush Sets Deadline to Reduce US Troops in Panama to Pre-Invasion
Level</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-State of Union Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush is promising to reduce the U.S.
military presence in Panama to its pre-invasion level of about
13,000 troops ``well before the end of February,'' but without
giving an exact timetable.
   Bush won a standing ovation from a combined House and Senate
audience when he declared in his State of the Union address: ``One
year ago, the people of Panama lived in fear, under the thumb of a
dictator. Today, democracy is restored _ Panama is free.''
   In the nationally televised address Wednesday night, Bush
declared that ``Operation Just Cause,'' the code name for the Dec.
20 invasion that toppled the government of Manuel Antonio Noriega,
``has achieved its objective.''
   Noriega, whom Bush did not mention by name, is in a Florida jail
awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges.
   Bush's comments suggested that about 3,000 additional troops
would soon be brought home.
   At the peak of the U.S. intervention last month, 27,000 U.S.
troops were there. The United States already has brought 11,000
home. Twenty-three American servicemen were killed in Panama and
more than 300 were wounded.
   Before the Dec. 20 invasion, about 13,000 U.S. troops were
stationed in Panama _ the number that will remain after the
withdrawal is completed.
   With Noriega's surrender, the military operation achieved all
its objectives, Bush said.
   ``The number of military personnel is now close to what it was
before the operation began,'' Bush said. ``And tonight, I am
announcing that, well before the end of February, the additional
numbers of American troops, the brave men and women of our armed
forces who made this mission a success, will be back home.''
   Bush's remarks underscored comments in Panama over the weekend
by Vice President Dan Quayle that the remaining U.S. troops would
be brought home in ``weeks rather than months.''
   However, it still was not clear whether the additional U.S.
troops would be out of Panama by Feb. 15, the date of the drug
summit in Colombia.
   The president of Peru, Alan Garcia, and other Latin American
leaders have protested the U.S. invasion. Garcia called on Bush to
remove the forces before the drug summit and at one point suggested
boycotting the Colombia meeting in pst.
   Bush also read a touching letter written by PFC James Markwell,
a 20-year-old Army Ranger medic who died during the first hours of
the invasion.
   Markwell, and others in his company, all had wrsuch letters a
few days before they were sent into action _ letters only to beiled
if they were killed in acti
   ``Sadly, Private Markwell's mother did receive this letter. And
she passed it on to me,'' said.
   Bush met with Markwell's family during a Jan. 12 tripetown of
Cincinnati.
   ``Here is some of what he wrote,'' Bush said and quoted from the
letter:
   ``I have never been afraid of death, but now he is waiting at
the corneen trained to kill and to save, so has everyone else.
   ``I am frightened of what lays beyond the fog, yet ... do not
mourn for me, revel in the life that I have died to give you. ...
But most of all, don't forget the Army was my choice. Something
that I wanted to do.
   ``Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and ensure that
you are free to do what you want and live your lives freely.''
   Bush then added: ``He knew what he believed in. He carried the
idea we call America in his heart.''

   For seven hours after Avianca Flight 52
crashed, Aleta Heidt didn't know whether her husband and two newly
adopted children from Colombia had survived.
   When she finally found her husband in a hospital, he couldn't
speak. But he picked up a pencil, and scrawled, ``2 kids?''
   Yes, she told him. They survived. And he cried.
   Mrs. Heidt said in an interview at her husband William's bedside
in the intensive care unit at Nassau County Medical Center that she
thanked God all three were alive.
   ``He saved three people for me,'' she said.
   One week ago today, Mrs. Heidt was holding two new ski jackets
for the children at Kennedy International Airport, waiting to meet
them for the first time. Instead, her meeting was in a hospital,
where they were treated for injuries and trauma.
   Seventy-three people died and 85 others were injured when the
Boeing 707, en route from Bogota, Colombia, apparently ran out of
fuel and crashed in Cove Neck, northeast of the airport.
   After being informed of the crash, the tall, slender piano and
voice teacher recalled reaching for a crucifix in her pocketbook
and clutching it tightly.
   ``I just kept saying The Lord's Prayer over and over,'' Mrs.
Heidt said Wednesday as she looked down at her husband's broken and
bruised body. ``I thank God for this miracle.''
   Eleven-year-old Pedro, whom the couple renamed Peter, injured an
eye and broke an arm; he has been having nightmares, she said.
Blanca, a 13-year-old now called Bianca, has two broken hips and is
``psychologically very bad,'' Mrs. Heidt said.
   ``She fades in and out and still thinks she's in Colombia with
her friends in the orphanage.'' Both of her legs are in traction
and one leg may end up shorter than the other, Mrs. Heidt said.
   The siblings were placed in a home several years ago after their
mother died in an accident. Mrs. Heidt said they were the youngest
of seven children and their father could not care for them.
   Of the three, Heidt's injuries were the most serious.
   His body is rigged with wires and tubes. Metal spikes hold his
fractured neck in place. His body is black and blue from head to
toe. Dried blood remains under his fingernails.
   But he is alive, in fair condition with multiple fractures at
Hackensack Medical Center, where he was transferred late Wednesday.
Both children also were scheduled to be transferred to the New
Jersey hospital.
   Heidt _ burly, with a thick mustache and black hair peppered
with gray _ spoke haltingly and with difficulty about the ordeal.
   ``I was lying there. There was screaming all around me but the
children weren't near me. I couldn't find them. There were pieces
of metal all over me. I hadn't the strength to pull it off. I was
pinned,'' he said.
   ``I knew we were going to crash,'' he whispered. ``It happened
so fast, there wasn't time even to grab the kids. The plane just
lost power.''
   Heidt, 51, carrying pictures of his wife and home, flew to
Colombia on Jan. 21 to bring the children back to the couple's
Wyckoff, N.J., home.
   During the four days he spent with them in Colombia, Heidt
became papa Willy and his wife, mamalita.
   Heidt, a machinist supervisor, and his wife, who is in her 40s,
married five years ago after meeting at an opera. Both are amateur
opera singers.
   Two years ago they learned they could not have children and
began trying to adopt. They found Peter and Bianca through an
agency.
   Mrs. Heidt, who had taped her crucifix above her husband's
hospital bed, said she has doesn't feel any bitterness about the
crash. She believes the tragedy will ``bond us closer together as a
family.''
   Heidt faces a long road to recovery, which he said would take
patience. But he said there was a lot worth waiting for.
   ``I want us to get on with the rest of our lives as a family,''
he said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Tokyo, Stocks Rise Marginally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Thursday, while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
rose marginally.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 17.47 points, or 0.05
percent, ending the day's trading at 37,206.42. On Wednesday, it
dipped 26.72 points.
   The dollar closed at 144.50 yen, up 0.10 yen from Wednesday's
144.40-yen finish. It opened at 144.45 yen and ranged between
144.35 and 144.63 yen.
   ``Following the dollar's surge yesterday, trading was very quiet
here today, and the dollar-yen rate hardly moved,'' said Junko
Namba, a trader with Daiwa Bank.
   However, participants actively bought the West German mark
against the yen, she said.
   Ms. Namba said trading was light because dealers were waiting
for the release of U.S. unemployment figures on Friday.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei rebounded quickly in response
to a big gain of 47 points in the Dow Jones industrial average on
Wall Street overnight and the yen's stability against the dollar.
   ``Prices were higher almost across the board as soon as the
market opened, but the trend didn't last long, because market
players soon stepped off to the sidelines and stopped buying,''
said Kazuyuki Suzuki, a trader with Daiwa Securities Co.
   ``The majority of market players were still not in a mood to
buy,'' he added.

<HEAD>Bush Troop Cut Proposal Disarms Democrats, May Ease Pressure on
Gorbachev</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's show-stealing proposal for
deeper troop reductions in Europe disarms Democratic critics at
home and may help ease pressures in Moscow on Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev has been hit with blow after blow, from the demise of
the Soviet empire in Eastern Europe to the bloody uprising in
Azerbaijan.
   His economy is sick and his reform program of perestroika has
not eased consumer shortages or improved standards of living.
   Next week, Gorbachev's authority is expected to be challenged at
what promises to be a fiery meeting of the Communist Party's
Central Committee, the one body with the official power to remove
him as party leader.
   Against that landscape, Bush made a point in Wednesday night's
State of the Union address to say, ``It's time to build on our new
relationship with the Soviet Union, to endorse and encourage a
peaceful process of internal change toward democracy and economic
opportunity.''
   Bush, responding to the political upheaval in the once-solid
Soviet empire, announced a proposal to cut U.S. and Soviet combat
forces in Central Europe to 195,000 on each side.
   It was a followup to a U.S. offer last year to reduce troops
throughout Europe to 275,000 for each superpower.
   ``We are in a period of great transition, great hope, yet great
uncertainty,'' Bush said, adding that the Soviet military threat in
Europe was diminishing.
   The troop-cutting proposal is likely to win favor from
Gorbachev, eager to save money from military spending.
   After all, it was Gorbachev who spurred conventional arms cuts
beginning with his surprise announcement in 1988 that he was
reducing global Soviet troop strength by 10 percent and withdrawing
six tank divisions from Europe.
   When Bush proosed the cutback last year to 275,000, Gorbachev
said ``fine'' and readily agreed to cut back the number of Soviet
tanks that could be used for a surprise attack.
   Pressures continue to build for Gorbachev to do more.
   Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have announced troop cuts of
their own and asked the Kremlin to withdraw all its forces from
their territory. And the leader of East Germany has said that all
superpower troops could be out of Europe by the year 2000.
   A senior administration official, explaining Bush's new offer,
said it was a response to ``this sort of rapidly falling deck of
cards'' of hardline communist regimes.
   ``It appeared that in the area of arms control, specifically
conventional arms control in Europe, that events were running ahead
of the negotiations,'' said the official, who commented only on
condition of not being identified by name.
   In recent days, Bush has offered a number of extraordinary
political endorsements of Gorbachev and has refused to criticize
his military crackdown in Azerbaijan.
   At one point, Bush said of Gorbachev, ``I hope that he not only
survives but stays strong.'' A day later, he said Gorbachev was
``really the best hope for what our interests are.''
   Bush is counting on Gorbachev to help him seal a treaty to slash
conventional forces in Europe and to cut strategic weapons and
chemical weapons. Before he announced his plan to the nation, Bush
called Gorbachev in Moscow with a preview of the proposal.
   Asked how Gorbachev responded, Bush said, ``I can't characterize
it, but I can just simply say that he was receptive, but I don't
know whether he's supportive or not.''
   It was clear, however, how Congress felt.
   It was all cheers and standing ovations from Republicans and
Democrats alike when Bush announced his plan in a packed House
chamber.
   ``A good idea,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee. ``Very positive,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``Just when you thought you had a Cold War budget _ boom,''
exclaimed Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a frequent Pentagon
critic and advocate of reduced U.S. forces in Europe. ``I'm really
delighted. There's hope.''
   However, the cheery reaction surely will fade if the
administration tells Congress that a yet-to-be-negotiated proposal
to scale down troops will not provide a desired ``peace dividend''
of reduced defense spending.
   Moreover, from tax cuts on capital gains to bills dealing with
crime, child care and clean air, there are plenty of areas of
disagreement to ensure an abundance of election-year battles
between the White House and the Democrats who control Capitol Hill.

<HEAD>Freighter Fired on by Coast Guard Held in Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Mexican government promised an
``exhaustive inspection'' of a Cuban-owned freighter that drew
machine-gun and cannon fire from a Coast Guard cutter after
refusing to stop for a drug inspection.
   The 250-foot Panama-registered freighter, the Hermann, took
several hits from the cutter Chincoteague as the vessels steamed
across the open Gulf of Mexico, Coast Guard spokesman Joe Gibson
said. The ship was hit 50 times by Coast Guard fire, but there were
no injuries, a Mexican official said.
   The vessel escaped into Mexican waters, but two Mexican navy
ships seized the Hermann and escorted it to Tampico, about 300
miles south of the U.S. border.
   ``The situation is not over. There's action still being taken,''
Coast Guard Lt. Steve Koska said late Wednesday. ``I can't go into
it, but there are things we can do. We can go through diplomatic
channels.''
   Mexico's Foreign Ministry said in a statement that authorities
began the ``exhaustive search'' of the vessel in Tampico.
   The inspection, expected to take at least 24 hours, was to
include a search for drugs and an examination of the ship's
navigation diary, said Javier Trevino, a spokesman with Mexico's
embassy in Washington, D.C.
   The Cuban government, which had demanded that the United States
not attempt to board the ship, has made a formal complaint to the
State Department over the incident, said a Cuban diplomatic
representative in Washington.
   The official called the incident a provocation.
   ``This deed demonstrates once more that the United States
intends to behave as owner of the world and with its proverbial
barbarism appears willing to obstruct normal commerce between Cuba
and Mexico,'' said an official quoted by Cuba's official news
agency, Prensa Latina.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III disagreed.
   ``It was not an attack and a provocation,'' Baker said. ``We
were engaged in a legal law enforcement activity.''
   State, Defense Department and National Security Council
officials held three meetings before giving permission to use
disabling fire against the Hermann, said Jack O'Dell, a Coast Guard
spokesman in Washington.
   The Coast Guard obtained permission from Panama to fire on the
ship, Gibson said. He said it is protocol to request permission to
stop a vessel from its country of registry.
   The Hermann has a Cuban crew, is owned by a Cuban company and
originated from a Cuban port, Coast Guard officials said.
   Koska said the decision to board the ship was made because the
vessel fit the profile of a narcotics-smuggling ship, but he
declined to elaborate.
   ``The profile of a vessel that is engaged in illegal activity is
when you ask them to stop and they don't stop,'' he said.
``Wouldn't you say that's a pretty good indication?''
   Cuba's news agency, monitored in Mexico City, said the ship had
a 12-man crew, a cargo of 10 tons of chromium and was operated by
the Guamar Shipping Co. of Cuba.
   The incident lasted from early Tuesday, when the Chincoteague
spotted the freighter, until 5 a.m. Wednesday, when the shots were
fired about 45 miles east of Tampico.
   The Coast Guard cutter, a 110-foot patrol boat with a crew of
16, is based in Mobile, Ala. It has two M-60 machine guns and one
20mm cannon.

   Snow blanketed much of Japan and South Korea today,
the latest assault in a week of storms that have snarled
transportation and claimed more than two dozen lives, officials
said.
   Tokyo, a city unused to anything more than a dusting of snow,
woke up to find nearly 3 inches on the ground and more falling. By
dawn, more than 3 inches had fallen in adjacent Yokohama and 7.5
inches in Mito, 60 miles northeast of Tokyo, the Meteorological
Agency said.
   In South Korea, about 10 inches of snow had fallen by early
today in Seoul, the capital city of 10 million people.
   Police reported hundreds of casualties in snow-related traffic
accidents, including 27 deaths Tuesday when snow first began piling
up. Damage was estimated at $6 million nationwide.
   Villages along the east coast and nearby mountains were hit
hardest with up to 5 feet of snow since Tuesday afternoon.
   About 40,000 government officials and police were ordered out
today to clear Korean streets of snow and open traffic to isolated
villages after forecasters said the worst was over, officials said.
   In Japan, Tokyo's international airport at Narita was closed for
an hour today for snow removal and other airports in the country
experienced dozens of flight cancellations.
   ``Bullet'' trains were running at a reduced speed of 106 mph due
to the snow, railway officials said. The intercity trains usually
run at 130 mph.

   Inside the first-class package was a letter from the president
and a cap that says ``White House Tennis'' on the front.
   Known around his neighborhood as ``the cat with the hats,''
Mundy wrote Bush after his collection of 1,027 baseball caps was
featured in the Daytona Beach News-Journal. His hats are tacked to
the wall of his garage in four neat rows.
   Mundy, 61, claimed he wouldn't stop stockpiling the brimmed
bonnets until he topped off his exhibit with Bush's fishing cap.
   The president explained in the letter that arrived Monday that
he couldn't part with his fishing hat: ``I was reluctant to send
you one of my favorite fishing caps _ you know how we fisherman are
about luck, and I need all the help I can get. While the enclosed
is not one of my `best' fishing caps, I hope you'll enjoy it in
your collection.''
   But Mundy's wife Dottie doesn't think the collecting is over.
   ``The man can't turn down a hat,'' she said.

   The Denver Broncos have been swamped in
three of the last four Super Bowls, but Theresa Collurafici has had
better luck, twice delivering Super Bowl babies on days the Broncos
lost the big one.
   While the New York Giants defeated Denver 39-20 on Jan. 25,
1987, Mrs. Collurafici gave birth to Amanda Lauren.
   On Sunday, when the San Francisco 49ers whomped the Broncos
55-10, she delivered 7-pound, 5-ounce Marissa Erin.
   Amanda is fine and her parents are happy, but befuddled.
   ``I don't know what's going on here,'' said husband Anthony
Collurafici, 30. ``It just seems kind of strange, you know?''
   Collurafici said he wasn't too worried because he knew there
were televisions at Christiana Hospital in Stanton _ even one in
the labor room.
   ``In between contractions, we watched some of the game,'' said
Mrs. Collurafici, 30, who said she was not too concerned about who
won.
   Her husband said he had a small wager on the game, and won the
bet.
   ``I came up a winner in more ways than one, I guess,'' he said.
   The Broncos lost Super Bowl XXII to the Washington Redskins in
1988.

   Pawtucket won't haul residents into court
if their lawn gets a little shaggy _ not just yet, anyway.
   City officials, looking for a way to force property owners to
keep their yards in better shape, had proposed a maximum grass
height of 5{ inches.
   Anyone allowing their lawn to reach an unsightly half-foot faced
a city mowing crew _ and a city bill _ to keep their grass at
regulation length.
   But a City Council committee told the zealous bureaucrats to
holster their tape measures until the ordinance had a chance to be
reviewed.
   Planning Director Roger Giraud admitted Wednesday that the
proposal has been the subject of ridicule but it is intended to
deal with a potentially serious problem: overgrown, rat-infested
yards that pose a risk to public health.
   Giraud said he wanted to deal with nuisance properties before
they became health hazards. He said he had no interest in becoming
a lawn cop.

   Kenya's President Daniel arap Moi is calling
on American Jewish leaders to help get increased U.S. aid for his
country.
   Moi, speaking to representatives of 50 major Jewish
organizations on Wednesday, also said Jewish leaders should
influence the U.S. government to provide funding to projects for
developing semi-arid areas in Kenya with expertise from Israel.
   Kenya last year resumed diplomatic relations with Israel, which
had been severed in 1973 under heavy pressure from the Arab world.
   Moi is in Washington on a private visit to attend the National

   Moi said relations between his country and the United States had
improved greatly under the Bush administration, but that Kenya
still needs help in improving contacts with Congress. U.S. aid to
Kenya has declined in recent years.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO Backs Moynihan's Social Security Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO is lining up behind a plan by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan to return Social Security to a
pay-as-you-go basis and take its surplus off the federal budget.
   ``This plan would reduce the tax burden on working men and
women, whose tax share has become disproportionate to that of the
wealthy,'' the federation of 14.1 million union members said
Wednesday in a statement. ``As it is, the growing Social Security
surplus is being used to mask budget deficits that have been
exacerbated by unbalanced and unwise spending and revenue policies.
The Moynihan proposal has exposed this scam for all to see.''
   Moynihan said he was heartened by the federation's support,
which came after a meeting Wednesday with 20 member union leaders.
   Last week, Moynihan introduced a bill to cut the Social Security
tax from the current 6.2 percent to 5.1 percent by next year. This
would cost the Social Security trust fund $55 billion but would
save a working couple up to $600 a year.
   The measure would stop building up a huge trust fund surplus
which Moynihan says is wrongly being used to mask the true size of
the federal deficit.
   The AFL-CIO differed with Moynihan over how much the trust fund
surplus should be allowed to grow before repealing the Social
Security tax increase. The federation believes the surplus should
reach 125 percent to 150 percent of one year's benefits while
Moynihan's legislation would make the cuts when the fund reaches
100 percent.

<HEAD>Dance Theater of Harlem Cancels N.Y. Season; Lays Off Crew</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOLORES BARCLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Arts Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A financial crisis has forced the Dance Theater
of Harlem, the first American ballet company to tour the Soviet
Union, to cancel its New York City season and lay off its 51
dancers.
   The layoffs, which include 15 technical workers and some of the
staff, will take effect after the company's engagement at
Washington's Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in March, said
artistic director Arthur Mitchell.
   For two decades, the company has performed on stages around the
world, winning rave reviews in dozens of languages.
   Mitchell said Wednesday that sponsors at the last minute
canceled two major tours _ a five-week run in England and a week in
San Diego _ contributing to a projected deficit of $1.7 million in
the fiscal year.
   The vibrant and youthful troupe was in San Diego as part of a
West Coast tour when Mitchell told them the bad news.
   ``Naturally they were stunned,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Pasadena. ``But what was so pleasing was the
solidarity. Yes, we must stick together. They have a vested
interest in what we are about _ not just as performers but as human
beings. ... They put in the extra hours, the extra time; they do
lectures and community outreach projects for which they're not
paid.''
   Mitchell said the company has had previous layoffs but never to
this extent. ``We've always been very fiscally responsible. Our
accumulated deficit for 20 years is about $400,000.''
   The group's dance school in New York will remain open, but the
New York season, which was scheduled to begin in May, and the
summer course will be canceled.
   Corporations underwrite master classes, lecture demonstrations
and other educational projects that do not generate a profit, but
the company receives little corporate support for performances.
   The group's problems are shared by most in the arts community.
For the past decade, many of the nation's leading orchestras have
cut back, some theater groups have disappeared and a few dance
companies have gone out of business.
   ``In general, what you're seeing is true throughout the arts: a
decline in funding due to the economy, the mergers and acquisitions
phenomenon and to a change in priority in some companies who now
have an emphasis in the environment, education and social causes at
the expense of the arts,'' said Betsy Hopkins, executive director
of the fund-raising organization Corporate Fund for Dance.
   Hopkins said that in general, the nation's 400 or so dance
companies were healthy and not any worse off than other art forms.
   ``There's a heightened interest in dance in this country,'' she
said. ``But dance companies just don't tend to have big
endowments.''
   Two decades ago, Mitchell, a talented and brash principal dancer
from the New York City Ballet, sliced through the barriers that had
kept blacks from succeeding in classical ballet and founded the
vibrant and youthful company.
   Mitchell, who retired from the City Ballet in 1970, has led the
troupe to international renown.
   The company prides itself on preserving American dance
repertory. It also demonstrates a variety of styles and moods, from
the classical ``Swan Lake'' to Balanchine's neoclassical ``Allegro
Brillante'' to the Mitchell's modern work, ``Holberg Suite,'' to
the folk ballet ``John Henry.''
   In 1988, the troupe captivated audiences in the Soviet Union
with its magical retelling of John Taras' stunning ``Firebird,''
set to the original Igor Stravinsky score.
   After engagements in Berkeley, Calif., and Portland, Ore., the
Dance Theater of Harlem returns to New York on Feb. 24, and will
launch a major fund-raising campaign in the spring.

   A judge ordered the eviction of a
72-year-old woman who has lived in a squalid homestead for 19 years
after the state demolished her house to make way for a seaside park
that has yet to be built.
   Superior Court Judge Karen Sequino said Wednesday that Doris
Gagnon had no right to remain on the land along Long Island Sound
while the state converts it into a park, which officials said could
take two to three years. The state's plans to build the park are
about 20 years old.
   The eviction order carried an automatic 20-day stay, and the
judge said it was likely that Gagnon could qualify for a stay of up
to nine months, if she pursued her resettlement in public housing.
   Gagnon showed no emotion as Sequino ordered her eviction.
   But the plucky, 4-foot-10 woman let the chairman of the Milford
Housing Authority, Keith Rubinstein, have an earful when he
approached her after the hearing. Gagnon scolded him for testifying
that he could get her moved ahead of other people on the waiting
list for public housing. She said that would not be fair, and
called it an example of the government corruption she has been
fighting.
   ``I am sorry our system is this way and our average citizen
cannot get justice,'' she said, adding: ``I don't want people to
feel sorry for me. I want people to respect me.''
   Gagnon, whose only income is $4,000 annually in Social Security,
had testified she was not interested in public housing because she
needs room for a garden and her pets, which now include three cats,
three dogs, two geese, 12 ducks and about 50 chickens.
   Gagnon's homestead consists of a collection of shacks and aging
trailers with no electricity, no telephone and no running water.
   Assistant Attorney General Grace Dodier said that any hardships
Gagnon was suffering were self-imposed.
   Her attorney, Karen Torre, said the state's treatment of Gagnon
had been ``shameful and disgustful,'' and represented ``government
at its worst, when it doesn't care.''
   Torre asked that Gagnon, who has been battling cancer but
appeared quite energetic at the hearing, be allowed to remain in
her homestead until the bulldozers are ready to begin preparing the
parkland for recreational use.
   The state moved to evict Gagnon last year after Milford health
inspectors found bags of human sewage piled up behind her living
quarters.

   The indictment in the 1985 torture-slaying of
a U.S. drug agent expanded to include two of the highest police
officers in the previous Mexican administration and two powerful
drug dealers.
   They were among six new names in a 19-person indictment
Wednesday that updates charges related to the slaying of Enrique
Camarena Salazar and his Mexican pilot, and the killings of two
U.S. citizens in Guadalajara, Mexico.
   Manuel Ibarra Herrera, former head of Mexico's Federal Judicial
Police, roughly equivalent to the FBI; and Miguel Aldana Ibarra,
who headed the Mexican branch of Interpol, the international police
agency, were charged with participating in a cover-up to protect
drug smugglers in Mexico.
   Both were officials in the administration of President Miguel de
la Madrid, who completed his term in office in 1988. They were
among 15 people named in the indictment who are not in U.S. custody.
   Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were killed after
the Drug Enforcement Administration agent led raids on marijuana
plantations allegedly operated by Guadalajara drug cartel chief
Rafael Caro Quintero.
   His body was found March 5, 1985, on a ranch 65 miles southeast
of Guadalajara.
   As head of Interpol in Mexico City, Aldana had access to foreign
police intelligence on drug and arms trafficking.
   He also led Operation Pacifico, a drug task force. Camarena had
investigated reports that Aldana leaked information about
forthcoming police raids to drug traffickers, according to the book
``Desperados,'' an account of Camarena's slaying by Elaine Shannon.
   In Mexico, Aldana said Wednesday he would sue U.S. authorities
for indicting him, the government news agency Notimex reported.
   Aldana, who now heads a lawyers' association, led attempts to
discredit Camarena after NBC-TV's ``Drug War'' miniseries broadcast
last month. He reiterated his claim that Camarena was in the
marijuana trade and may not really be dead.
   Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo were sentenced by a
Mexican court in December to 40 years in prison without parole for
their role in Camarena's slaying, and 10 other men also were
sentenced by Mexican courts.
   But U.S. officials have said for some time they believed
high-level Mexican authorities were involved in covering-up
Camarena's slaying.
   ``We want the message to be clear that anyone who kills one of
our agents will be hunted down and brought to justice by the DEA,''
said Ralph Lochridge, agency spokesman in Los Angeles.
   Other new names on Wednesday's indictment included a Dr.
Humberto Alvarez Machain; Mexican drug lord Miguel Angel Felix
Gallardo; and Honduran drug kingpin Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros,
both of whom are already in prison.
   Matta was sentenced last month to life in prison without
possibility of parole by a federal judge in Los Angeles. His
extradition to the United States from Honduras in 1988 sparked
riots in which five people died and an annex of the U.S. Embassy
was burned.
   Gallardo's arrest by Mexico in April was applauded by U.S.
officials as a sign President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was serious
about the drug war.
   In a sixth new indictment, Antonio Vasquez Ochoa faces two
counts of committing violent crimes in aid of racketeering for the
slayings of John Walker and Alberto Radelat on Jan. 30, 1985, in
Guadalajara.
   The indictment alleges Vasquez Ochoa and others participated in
the slayings of the two Americans ``to maintain and further the
purposes'' of the Guadalajara cartel.
   Among those named earlier in the indictment was Ruben Zuno Arce,
a millionaire Mexican businessman and brother-in-law of Luis
Echeverria, Mexican president from 1970-76. Arce was arrested in
Los Angeles on Dec. 9 and charged with committing violent crimes in
aid of racketeering and conspiracy to kidnap a federal agent.

   After the veteran pilot of Avianca
Flight 52 was eulogized at a simple funeral Mass, officials drove
his body to where he had tried to land a week before: Kennedy
International Airport.
   The remains of Capt. Laureano Caviedes Hoyos, mourned Wednesday
at a service at St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, were to be flown
today to Colombia for burial.
   The mourners, who took up only three pews, listened intently as
Associate Pastor Rev. Jeffrey Johnston offered them comfort.
   ``One who spent so much of his time in his life among the stars,
now rests beyond them,'' he said.
   Caviedes, 56, was an Avianca pilot for 28 years. He was survived
by his wife and two sons, ages 13 and 14, who live in Bogota,
Colombia.
   The Mass was arranged by Caviedes' sister-in-law, Yolanda Munoz
Todd, who lives in nearby Great Neck with her husband and son,
Johnston said.
   The captain was one of 73 people killed Jan. 25 when the Boeing
707 he was flying apparently ran out of fuel and crashed in the
small enclave of Cove Neck on Long Island. Another 85 people were
injured.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators have not said
who or what was to blame for the crash.
   They wrapped up their on-site probe Tuesday and gave Avianca
permission to haul away the wreckage.
   Caviedes, who was flying into Kennedy under heavy fog and rain,
radioed controllers that he needed ``priority'' landing because he
was low on fuel, but never used the word emergency, investigators
said.
   As a result, Flight 52 was switched from a holding pattern to an
approach pattern, but was placed behind several other incoming
planes.
   ``The pilot apparently thought when he came out of the holding
pattern that he had enough fuel and that's why he appears (on taped
conversations) to be calm and cool,'' said NTSB investigator Barry
Trotter, who is handling the crash probe.
   Trotter left New York for Washington on Wednesday, accompanied
by aides who carried fuel gauges taken from the cockpit.
   ``We have gathered much of the facts, now we've got to sit down
and analyze to determine exactly what happened that night,''
Trotter said. ``There's no simple answer.''
   NTSB investigators will fly to Bogota next week to review the
plane's maintenance records and gather information about the
employment records and personal habits of Flight 52's crew,
including what each Avianca employee did the night before the fatal
crash, Trotter said.
   In coming months, investigators will try to recreate Flight 52
down to the most minute detail. A full report is expected in nine
to 12 months.

<BYLINE>Study Predicts Wide Screening for Carriers of Cystic Fibrosis Gene
^By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study today raises the possibility of
population-wide screening for carriers of cystic fibrosis, but some
worry about what will happen to parents who ignore the knowledge
that they can pass on the disease.
   Making the test mandatory ``has the potential for grave
danger,'' warned Dr. Harvey R. Colten of Washington University.
``Even voluntary screening programs carry considerable economic and
social risk.''
   Cystic fibrosis is the most common fatal genetic disease of
young Americans. It occurs most frequently among whites, striking
about one of every 2,500 white newborns in the United States.
   For the first time, scientists can delve into grownups' genes
and spot those likely to bear children with the inherited illness.
While the test is still too crude for routine use, doctors believe
that within a year it will be able to detect 95 percent of all
carriers of cystic fibrosis.
   ``People for years have realized that if we had a good carrier
test for cystic fibrosis, there would be the potential to test
everyone before reproduction to see if they were a carrier or
not,'' said Dr. Arthur L. Beaudet, of Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston. ``The evidence is at hand that such a carrier test will
soon be available.''
   Beaudet described the results of the currently available
screening test in a report in the New England Journal of Medicine.
His team found that it can identify 76 percent of all carriers.
   One in 25 white Americans carries one copy of the cystic
fibrosis gene. They are healthy, but if they marry another carrier,
there is a 1-in-4 chance that their children will have cystic
fibrosis.
   Last summer, Drs. Lap-Chee Tsui of the Hospital for Sick
Children in Toronto and Francis S. Collins of the University of
Michigan pinpointed the genetic error responsible for most cases of
cystic fibrosis. The latest study looked at what happened when
doctors screened people for this single defect.
   Scientists at about 40 labs around the world are cooperating to
track down the half dozen or so other mutations within the gene
that also can cause the disease. Collins predicted that the
mutations will be identified within the next year. Then, doctors
should be able to offer highly accurate screening tests.
   Specialists hope that adults will use the test results for
family planning. If couples learn that both are carriers, some
might decide to adopt rather than run the risk of having a child
with cystic fibrosis. Others might opt to have artificial
insemination with sperm from an anonymous donor who is not a
carrier.
   If they decide to have a pregnancy, the test can be performed on
the fetus. If the fetus turns out to have the disease, parents can
then decide whether to have the baby or to get an abortion.
   The disease causes a variety of symptoms, including abnormal
mucous secretion that results in lung infections. While doctors can
ease many of the symptoms and extend lives, there is no treatment
for the underlying disease. Collins noted that if everyone in the
United States gets the screening test, it will turn up 8 million
Americans who carry the cystic fibrosis gene.
   ``If this program is successful, every one of them deserves to
sit down with someone and find out what that means,'' he said. ``We
don't by a long shot have the means to do that. Physicians are
uncomfortable with that role, and there aren't enough genetic
counselors to do the job.''
   In an editorial in the journal, Colten raised the possibility
that insurance companies might refuse to pay the bills of children
with cystic fibrosis if their parents knew before the pregnancy
that they were carriers.
   Dr. Henry Dorkin of New England Medical Center in Boston said
that while he supports widespread screening, carriers should be
allowed to make their own decisions about whether to have children.
   ``We have to give people as much information as possible about
the risks and pitfalls that lie ahead of them,'' he said, ``and
after informing them, we should support their decision, whatever it
is.''
   Other questions involve at what age people should be screened
and whether the tests should be routinely offered to non-whites,
who have a much lower risk of cystic fibrosis.

<TEXT>
   CNN chief Ted Turner says a report by his network
that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was considering resigning
as leader of the Communist party was a rumor, not a scoop.
   ``How can you scoop a rumor?'' Turner said Wednesday at an
Atlanta Press Club luncheon. ``If rumors become scoops, then every
media will have one.''
   But another network executive said Cable News Network stood by
the reporter, Steve Hurst. Hurst, who has been assigned to Moscow
for 12 years, said the story he filed Tuesday was culled from ``a
well-informed and usually reliable Communist party source.''
   CNN continued to broadcast the report Wednesday after Gorbachev
denied it, although it added what Hurst said he initially heard
``could be a trial balloon ... or just a rumor by people opposed to
Gorbachev rule.''
   ``We believed in Hurst's source because I have great confidence
and faith in him,'' said Ed Turner, executive vice president of
news gathering for CNN. ``He knows when he thinks he has a solid
story. All you can do is trust your people.''
   Other news organizations carried the report but did not confirm
it. Instead they attributed it to CNN.
   Ted Turner, meanwhile, belittled the report's importance and
rapped other news organizations for their reaction.
   ``You shouldn't credit someone for breaking a rumor,'' he said.
``Anyone can break a rumor.''

low doses, but other researchers said its potential for therapy is
not yet known.
   The new substances appear to be the most potent yet studied for
stopping the virus from reproducing, scientists said in the British
journal Nature.
   Human tests for effectiveness were still being planned, but six
healthy men tolerated one of the substances without major side
effects, according to researchers from the Rega Institute for
Medical Research in Leuven, Belgium; the Janssen Research
Foundation in Beerse, Belgium, and in Spring House, Penn.
   They conducted laboratory studies of compounds called TIBO
derivatives. In their tests, the compounds inhibited reproduction
of the AIDS virus at concentrations that were 10,000 to 100,000
times lower than what is needed to kill cells.
   That compares to concentrations of 100 times to 10,000 times
lower than a cell-killing dose required for AZT, the only approved
drug for treating acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and for the
experimental drugs dideoxycytidine and dideoxyinosine, the
researchers said.
   This test-tube potency of the new compounds may bode well for
avoiding side effects, but nobody knows what would happen in
humans, cautioned AIDS researcher Jay Levy of the University of
California at San Francisco.
   Many drugs that look promising in the test tube turn out to have
unpredicted side effects, he said in a telephone interview. And
higher potentency in the test tube does not necessarily mean
greater effectiveness in people, he said.
   Jeffrey Laurence of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center
said he was concerned that the compound highlighted in the study
did not work against close relatives of the AIDS virus, including
HIV-2 and a monkey-carried version of the AIDS virus.
   That suggests the AIDS virus might become resistant to it by
mutating only slightly, he said.

<HEAD>Union Carbide Announces First Full-Scale Plastics Recycling</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   One of the largest plastics producers in
the United States unveiled plans to open the nation's first
multi-material, comprehensive plastic recycling plant.
   Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics Inc. said Wednesday the
facility would be the first in the nation to recycle the ubiquitous
plastic bags. The plant also will recycle plastic beverage
containers.
   The recycling center is expected to open next year in converted
space at the company's central New Jersey manufacturing plant at
Piscataway.
   The effort was praised by state officials and legislators but
environmental groups were skeptical, saying the recycling plans
might be little more than a bid to keep plastic-banning lawmakers
at bay.
   Union Carbide officials said the project was aimed at making
money as well as easing a nationwide garbage problem that is
particularly acute in densely populated New Jersey.
   ``These cost a lot of money,'' company vice president Gordon
Mounts told a Statehouse news conference as he gestured toward a
display of plastic bags and containers. ``We really don't believe
we can use them just once.''
   Only about 1 percent of the 60 billion pounds of plastic
produced in the United States is being recycled now. Union Carbide
officials said the new plant will demonstrate that plastic can be
re-used on a far wider scale.
   Environmentalists said readily recyclable glass and naturally
degrading paper are better for the environment than plastic.
   ``I don't doubt Union Carbide does want recycling, but ... they
are doing it as much for the public relations as for the
profitability of the venture,'' said Lisa Collaton, a solid waste
specialist for the Washington-based group Environmental Action.
   But Assemblyman Robert Smith, chairman of the lower house's
environment committee, said the effort appeared genuine and will
``dramatically change the approach government takes to the plastics
problem.''
   He said ``there's now a real alternative'' to several state
bills that propose restricting or banning plastic packaging, though
none have passed.
   Plastics industry officials say more than 350 legislative
initiatives have been introduced at the federal, state and local
levels around the country to curb the use of non-recyclable
plastics.
   The plant's breakthrough, Union Carbide officials said, was its
ability to accept plastic bags. The so-called plastic ``films'' now
are recycled in Europe but not in the United States, said Keith
Atkins, director of new business for the company's polyolefins
division.
   About 20 percent of the soft-drink containers used in the
country also are being recycled, but the percentage is nowhere near
as high with other types of plastic.
   Union Carbide officials said the new plant would melt the bags
down like other types of plastic. The material will be fashioned
into pellets to be sold to plastic packaging manufacturers.
   The new plant will be able to handle 40 million pounds, out of
more than 1 billion pounds of plastic garbage generated in New
Jersey each year. But company officials said their project at least
would demonstrate that comprehensive and profitable plastic
recycling is possible.

   An 8-year-old boy recounted how a man raped
him and cut off his penis in an attack that has pushed legislators
to draft tough new laws on sex predators.
   Embarrassed but determined, the boy, who was 7 at the time of
the attack, identified in court Wednesday the man accused of the
crime.
   The boy did not look at the defendant, Earl Kenneth Shriner, but
pointed toward Shriner at the defense table and said, ``Yes ...
over there.''
   Shriner, 40, has pleaded innocent to first-degree attempted
murder, first-degree assault and two counts of first-degree rape.
   During 30 minutes on the witness stand in Pierce County Superior
Court, the boy told of the May 20 attack.
   Judge Thomas R. Sauriol limited attendance in the courtroom
during the testimony to about 15 friends and relatives of
principals in the case and 10 reporters. The boy's testimony was
not announced in advance ``to avoid hoopla as much as possible,''
Deputy Prosecutor James Roche said.
   Deputy Prosecutor Barbara Corey-Boulet had the boy identify the
small red bicycle that he rode into a wooded area near his home the
day of the attack.
   ``Did something happen to you the last time you rode this
bike?'' she asked.
   ``Yeah,'' the boy answered.
   She asked if he met anyone in the woods.
   ``A guy,'' said the boy, who nodded when Corey-Boulet asked if
the man did something to him.
   ``Did the guy do some things that you are embarrassed about?''
Corey-Boulet asked.
   ``Uh huh,'' he said.
   He then described the attack.
   The boy said the man was wearing ``a fishing coat ... green and
white.''
   Under cross examination from defense lawyer Lloyde Alton, the
boy repeated his description of the jacket. The jacket introduced
into evidence and described by detectives as the one Shriner likely
wore is gray with a maroon lining.
   The savageness of the case has sparked proposals in the
Legislature for dealing with predatory sex offenders that range
from civil commitment to castration.
   The trial, which began Monday, is expected to last about three
weeks.
   Prosecutors have said they would seek a life sentence for
Shriner, who has a history of sexual attacks and completed a
10-year prison term shortly before the boy was attacked. He was
imprisoned for the kidnap and assault of two teen-age girls.

<TEXT>
   The federal government plans an attempt to gain
control of several locals of the International Longshoremen's
Association allegedly controlled by corrupt leaders, a Justice
Department source said.
   A lawsuit is expected to be filed next week in federal court in
New York, the source said on condition of anonymity. It would be
filed under the Federal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations
Act.
   ABC News reported Tuesday that the department would seek to have
a trustee run the union because of accusations it is controlled by
organized crime.
   The government has sought trusteeships in other cases where mob
influence was alleged, including against the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters.
   Labor investigators said the New York and Newark, N.J.,
longshoremen locals are considered to be among the most influenced
by organized crime.
   Spokesmen for the Department of Labor and the New York harbor
commission each reported their organizations were investigating the
union in the New York area.
   New York prosecutors have been investigating the union for
several months, said Thomas W. Gleason Jr., counsel for the union.
   ``We have fully cooperated,'' said Gleason, son of the union's
former leader. He said he knew of no plans to bring the union into
court.
   Deborah Corley, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier,
said she could not confirm or deny reports the office was preparing
a lawsuit against the union.
   The union, with 90,000 members nationwide, was expelled from the
American Federation of Labor for corruption in 1953, and has been
the subject of many investigations over the years.
   A spokesman for the Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor,
created in 1953 to probe mob connections on the docks, said his
organization had been conducting an investigation into the union
for several years.
   The spokesman, Jerome J. Klied, would not confirm the nature of
the investigation.
   The Labor Department also is conducting an investigation into
the ILA, said New York spokesman Randy Wilson. He said further
information would be forthcoming next week when the Justice
Department takes action. He declined to elaborate.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Navaho Chairman Tried With Co-Defendants</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Suspended Navajo Chairman Peter
MacDonald said he was disappointed by a tribal judge's decision to
try MacDonald with his co-defendants.
   ``Everybody likes to be tried on their own,'' MacDonald said
Wednesday after Judge Robert Yazzie of Window Rock District Court
made his ruling.
   Yazzie consolidated trials for MacDonald and his son, Peter
``Rocky'' MacDonald, and suspended Vice Chairman Johnny R. Thompson.
   He ordered three separate trials for the defendants on fraud and
other charges related to the tribe's purchase of a ranch; for
election-code violations; and for bribery and kickback _ but each
trial will involve two of the defendants.
   Also Wednesday, Yazzie refused to order MacDonald to surrender
his U.S. passport; told MacDonald's attorney he would have to
remain on the case despite the uncertainty of compensation; and
refused a motion that he step aside for another judge.
   Meanwhile, a judge in Phoenix on Wednesday allowed the tribe to
go ahead with its $24 million civil racketeering suit against
MacDonald and about 70 other defendants.
   Judge John Foreman of Maricopa County Superior Court rejected a
defense contention that his court had no jurisdiction because
tribal sovereignty prevents the tribe from suing a Navajo in a
state court.
   The civil suit in Phoenix and some of the 107 criminal counts
facing MacDonald allege that he swayed the Tribal Council to spend
$33.4 million on the Big Boquillas Ranch near Seligman in July
1987. The non-Indian company which sold the ranch had paid $27.2
million for it less than a day before.
   Phoenix land broker Byron ``Bud'' Brown, another defendant in
the civil case, testified before a U.S. Senate committee last
February that MacDonald was to receive one-third of the $7.2
million profit and actually got $50,000 in cash; a $25,000 wire
transfer; the lease of a luxury automobile, and vacation trips
before the scheme was discovered.
   The Tribal Council suspended MacDonald a few days later and
Thompson on March 10.
   Yazzie set a May 1 trial date on the election-code violations
alleged against MacDonald and Thompson. The trial on bribery and
kickbacks, with MacDonald and Rocky MacDonald as defendants, is
scheduled for May 23; and the two are defendants in the Big
Boquillas ranch trial scheduled to begin June 20.
   In denying the prosecutors' request that MacDonald surrender his
passport, Yazzie said MacDonald had attended all previous hearings
and that he saw no reason to limit his travel.
   In a separate matter, MacDonald wanted the judge to disqualify
himself, contending that Yazzie would be biased against him because
he once tried to deny Yazzie a permanent judgeship. Yazzie said
there was no evidence to support the contention.
   Val Jolley of Farmington, N.M., an attorney for Peter MacDonald,
had filed a motion for a ``limited appearance'' based on a January
start of trial. But Yazzie ruled that a limited appearance was
unethical and a ``restriction on the court.'' Jolley has said he
was concerned about MacDonald's ability to pay him for services in
a lengthy case.

<HEAD>Assembly Sets March 21 as Independence Day; Arrest Procedure
Debated</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers have voted unanimously to
declare Namibia independent in mid-March, ending the territory's
status as the continent's last colony after 75 years of South
African rule.
   Leaders of the South-West Africa People's Organization, dominant
in the Constituent Assembly, said Wednesday that March 21 was
chosen unaninimously in part because the United Nations recognizes
it as the ``International Day for the Elimination of Apartheid.''
   For many years, South Africa's apartheid policies of racial
segregation were imposed on Namibia's blacks.
   South Africa agreed to grant independence to Namibia, also known
as South-West Africa, under a regional peace treaty. More than
6,000 United Nations military and civilian personnel have been
supervising the process since April 1989.
   The 72-member assembly this week has been debating each article
of a democratic, Western-style constitution and has agreed on all
the major principles. It is likely to formally approve the document
on Friday or Monday.
   The assembly on Wednesday eliminated a provision that would have
allowed for detention without trial under some circumstances. SWAPO
favored keeping the provision, but agreed to drop the measure when
the opposition parties objected.
   Also, a proposal that guarantees fundamental rights even during
times of war and states of emergency was approved.
   All decisions on the constitution require a two-thirds' majority.
   The document has declaration of fundamental rights, including
freedom of movement, speech, and a free press. It also envisions a
multiparty democracy, regular elections, an independent judiciary
and an executive president limited to two five-year terms.
   Leftist-oriented SWAPO, which waged a 23-year bush war against
South African rule, captured 41 seats in the assembly and will form
the first government. SWAPO's leader, Sam Nujoma is expected to be
the countary's first president.
   The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multiracial coalition that
favors a free enterprise economy, has 21 seats. The 10 remaining
seats are divided among five parties.
   South Africa captured Namibia from the Germans in 1915. In
December 1988, it agreed to grant independence as part of a
regional treaty that also calls for phased withdrawal of Cuban
troops from Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor. More than 6,000
U.N. military and civilian personnel have been supervising the
transition process since last April.

   A Moslem prayer leader who was found dead
at his mosque had been warned of death threats recently by the
police, an associate of the slain man said.
   Rashad Khalifa, 54, died early Wednesday after a shooting was
reported at the mosque he founded near the University of Arizona,
authorities said.
   ``There is a possibility that motives may include political and
religious problems,'' said Tucson police homicide Sgt. Charles
Armijo, who declined to confirm whether Khalifa was shot or to
specify the cause of death.
   The FBI was called in to investigate the death.
   Khalifa founded a group in 1978 called the ``Right'' or ``True''
Moslems, said Edip Yuksel, an assistant to Khalifa.
   Yuksel said Khalifa had received death threats because of his
beliefs that most of the Islamic world was a version of the Koran
that contained satanic verses. He said police had warned Khalifa of
the threats.
   He said Khalifa had published views which contended most Moslems
were idol-worshippers of Mohammed, who according to Islamic belief
had the holy book revealed to him by Allah.
   Yuksel said Khalifa was prominent in Moslem circles worldwide
and estimated that he had at least 10,000 followers.
   Khalifa came to the United States from Egypt in 1959. One of his
followers was onetime National Football League star receiver Bobby
Joe Moore, who adopted Khalifa's first name in becoming Ahmad
Rashad.

<HEAD>President Roh's Governing Party Dissolved</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo's governing
party was formally dissolved today to form a new broad-based
coalition with two moderate opposition parties.
   At a hurriedly called national convention, more than 6,000 party
delegates endorsed the merger and disbanded the Democratic Justice
Party by clapping hands. No vote was taken.
   In an address read by party chairman Park Tae-joon, Roh hailed
the dissolution as ``a historic turning point'' and urged his
followers to continue to support him to lift South Korea to the
ranks of industrialized nations before the end of the century.
   ``We should turn ourselves into a huge furnace which burns out
all past remnants of conflicts and confrontation,'' he said.
   Roh announced last week that his governing party would merge
with the country's No. 2 and 3 opposition groups to form a huge new
conservative party.
   Kim Young-sam's second-largest opposition group, the
Reunification Democratic Party, resolved Monday to disband in favor
of the new party, tentatively called the ``Democratic Liberal
Party.''
   The third largest opposition group, the New Democratic
Republican Party led by former premier Kim Jong-pil, is scheduled
to hold a national convention next Monday to dissolve and endorse
the merger.
   The merger, expected to formally take effect around Feb. 15,
will restructure South Korea's faction-ridden four-party system
into a bipartisan one.
   The new expanded ruling group will control 221 seats in the
297-member National Assembly and will dwarf Kim Dae-jung's
opposition group, the country's largest and most radical, the Party
for Peace and Democracy.
   Kim Dae-jung's party has 71 seats.
   The merger was not without friction but is expected to be
carried through as scheduled. Several lawmakers of Kim Young-sam's
party, including parliamentary floor leader Lee Ki-taek, seceded to
form a new opposition party.

<HEAD>Continental Jet Nearly Hits Second Jet on Runway</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One Continental Airlines jet missed colliding
with another Continental plane by ``20 or 30 feet'' after it broke
through low clouds for a landing only to see the plane on the
runway, one of the pilots said.
   ``It was really a miracle that he didn't hit us. He went right
over the top of us, and all we saw was his tailpipe through the
windshield,'' said Capt. Jim Lowry, pilot of the plane that was on
the runway at Houston Intercontinental Airport.
   The Houston Chronicle reported Wednesday that the Continental
plane had to abort its landing Jan. 3, when it spotted the other
plane on the runway.
   Jack Sinon, manager of the Federal Aviation Administration's air
traffic control facility at the Houston airport, said Wednesday the
matter is under FAA review. He declined to provide further details.
   Continental spokesman Ned Walker confirmed details of the
incident, but he would not identify the pilot of the second plane,
which was flying in from Albuquerque, N.M.
   ``We've been told by the FAA that they're investigating this as
a possible air traffic control operational error and that the
Continental actions and aircraft positions were as they had been
instructed,'' Walker said.
   The close call was the scariest incident in his career, said
Lowry, a 25-year pilot with Houston-based Continental.
   Lowry said he warned the tower controller that his plane was
still on the runway about 20 seconds before the other plane roared
over.
   The foggy and overcast day was turning dark as Lowry and his
crew sat in the plane awaiting air traffic control instructions for
a takeoff to Phoenix, Ariz.
   ``We sat on the runway for a good while. Then we heard an
airplane being cleared to land on the runway that we were on,'' he
said. ``We called the tower and advised the controller that we were
still in position on the runway.''
   The tower, he said, acknowledged the call. But the crew soon
heard the roar of the other plane.
   ``As he came over us, he was bringing the nose back up and we
saw him through the windshield. He probably missed us by 20 or 30
feet,'' Lowry said. ``... It was terrifying.''

<HEAD>Cardinal Says Bishop Never Condemned Governor to Hell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor defended a bishop who
was quoted as saying Gov. Mario M. Cuomo was ``in danger of going
to hell'' because of his abortion beliefs.
   ``What the bishop told me he actually said was that the governor
is `quite possibly contributing to the loss of his soul.' To me
that sounds significantly different from `cursing' or `condemning'
the governor to hell,'' O'Connor said.
   Auxiliary Bishop Austin Vaughan, 62, had talked to a newspaper
reporter from jail, where he served 10 days for blocking the
entrance to an Albany Planned Parenthood clinic last March. Vaughan
was released on Jan. 24.
   The New York Post had quoted Vaughan Jan. 23 as saying Cuomo was
``in danger of going to hell if he dies tonight.''
   ``I think for a believing, educated Catholic to take the
position he's taken, he takes a very serious risk of going straight
to hell,'' the Post reported Vaughan had said.
   O'Connor had refused comment until he could speak to Vaughan. On
Wednesday, he said in a column published in Catholic New York that
Vaughan assured him he was misunderstood.
   The governor responded to O'Connor's column with a two-sentence
statement: ``The cardinal says the bishop was misquoted. I'm glad.''
   The Post's state editor, Fred Dicker, said, ``I read the
cardinal's comments to be much more an objection to the governor's
characterization than to what we had reported the bishop actually
said.''
   Cuomo has said that he and his wife accept the church's teaching
on abortion in their private life, but that as governor he
recognized the constitutional right of choice and a legal
obligation to make the choice available to the poor.
   Cuomo originally had responded to the published comments by
saying: ``Does any bishop, any rabbi, any citizen have the right to
curse a politician, curse them even to hell? In this wonderful
country the answer is yes.''
   O'Connor said Vaughan, by issuing a warning to the governor from
jail, had followed in the footsteps of St. John the Baptist, St.
Thomas More and other religious leaders who had issued warnings to
public officials from prison.
   ``Among other differences, of course, is that Bishop Vaughan
will get to keep his head,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   For the man with the biggest roof in
Valdez, this year's snows come with a steep price: He's paid $5,000
to have it cleared.
   Dennis Holtz, owner of the FoodMart supermarket, said Wednesday
it took two men with snowblowers a couple of weeks to finally get
all the snow off.
   ``My roof is 21,000 square feet,'' Holtz said. ``We had 400 tons
of snow up there. It's built to hold 140 pounds per square foot and
we had 100 pounds per square foot.
   ``It took over $5,000 to get the nine feet of snow on the roof
blown off,'' he said. ``I guess that's just one of the costs of
doing business.''
   Holtz said Valdez is pretty much back to normal after getting
almost 4 feet of snow on Jan. 16, when a single-day-record of 47{
inches was set.
   More than 13 feet of snow fell in January, leaving just the
rooftops visible on one-story dwellings.
   A city storage building collapsed last week from the weight of
snow.
   Jeff Bailey of the National Weather Service said Valdez is 8
inches away from passing the season record for snowfall
accumulation of 384.7 inches, set in 1986-87.
   At the airport, which has been shut down twice this winter
because of snow buildup, maintenance crews are bulldozing snow off
taxiways and parking ramps.
   ``We had so much precipitation down here we work 32 hours a day
to keep ahead of it,'' said Elmer McCain. ``We can't keep it (ice)
off, so we just scar it for better traction.''
   Harry Rogers, superintendent of schools, said children no longer
play ``king of the hill'' but ``man on the mountain'' at the
elementary school, where snow is piling up on a corner of the
playground.
   ``The biggest pile we've got is approaching 50 feet,'' he said.
``The most serious problem we've got is keeping the kids off.
That's a high pile of snow out there.''

<HEAD>Sets Sights on Soviet Union in Final Season With Chicago Symphony</HEAD>

   Sir Georg Solti hopes his last year as director
of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra includes the group's first tour
of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   ``America has here a messenger, in this orchestra, that is
unparalleled by any politician, unparalleled by any ambassador,''
Solti said Wednesday when he unveiled plans for his 22nd and
farewell season.
   ``(It) is essential that we show them what we can produce _ not
in armaments, and not in missiles _ but in Beethoven and
Shostakovich,'' the 77-year-old Solti told reporters.
   The Chicago Symphony performances in the Soviet Union would be
part of an exchange that would bring the Leningrad Philharmonic to
the United States.
   The hoped-for tour would include a performance either in Moscow
or Leningrad and stops at Vienna, Austria, and at Solti's
birthplace of Budapest, Hungary.
   Logistical problems, including uncertainties over lodging and
food, have made the plans tentative, but the orchestra hopes to
reach a decision within two weeks.
   If all three stops cannot be arranged, the tour will not take
place, officials said. The trip would come during the ensemble's
centennial season, which will run from September through April 1991.
   ``Something is quite wonderful, to be part of an orchestra which
will be 100 years old,'' said Solti, who selected about two-thirds
of the musicians currently playing.
   ``One-fifth of the existence of this orchestra, I have been
honored to be its music director,'' he said. ``It's remarkable, and
I feel very, very rich.''
   Crowning the program for the season will be Verdi's opera
``Otello,'' with Luciano Pavarotti in the title role for the first
time, Solti said.
   The maestro, who has won a record 29 Grammy Awards and built the
Chicago Symphony into one of the world's best, also promised to
return to Chicago as a guest conductor.
   Solti also said the orchestra this spring will make its third
trip to the Orient.
   Six conductors, including Solti, and Daniel Barenboim, his
successor-designate in Chicao beginning in the 1991-92 season, will
lead 12 concerts in Japan during April.
   The trip will be funded largely through a $750,000 gift _ the
single largest corporate donation the orchestra has ever received _
from Motorola Inc., said Richard L. Thomas, chairman of the
Orchestral Association.
   Japanese audiences received the orchestra enthusiastically
during its previous trips there, the last in 1986, and Solti said
he loves the opportunity to showcase U.S. orchestral excellence.
   ``In many fields, to my great sadness, America is going down,''
he said. ``Here is where neither the Japanese nor the Germans can
compete with us, and this is one point when we should feel very
proud.''

   Some journalists may have been tipped to
top-secret military plans of the invasion of Panama hours before
the action began Dec. 20, but no one reported it before troops
began landing, an Army general says.
   ``I had strong indications, based on people I talked to, that
the press had a pretty strong indication about Tuesday (Dec. 19) as
to what was going to happen, and they didn't run it,'' Army Lt.
Gen. Thomas W. Kelly told an audience Wednesday at the University
of Notre Dame.
   ``So I think they earned a big plus for being good Americans and
not breaking the story.''
   Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, did
not specify who may have known of the top-secret plans or how word
might have leaked. He refused to accept reporters' questions and
confined his remarks to an informal talk before an audience of
about 1,000, mostly university ROTC cadets.
   Broadcast news reports the evening of Dec. 19 reported American
planes landing every 10 minutes at the U.S. base in Panama. Reports
also indicated troops had left Fort Bragg, N.C., but did not
indicate where they were going.
   Since the invasion, there have been reports that strongman
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was deposed after the U.S. troops
arrived, had been tipped to an imminent invasion but refused to
believe it.
   During his wide-ranging talk, Kelly defended the invasion,
castigated Noriega's leadership of the Panamanian Defense Forces
and discussed tactics.
   ``We wanted to go in at 1 o'clock in the morning because we own
the night,'' said Kelly. ``Our forces train at night, and just
about no one else's do. `We have night vision devices that no one
else has.''
   The Pentagon reported scattered resistance from Noriega
loyalists up to a week after the invasion.
   About 14,000 soldiers joined 12,000 troops already stationed in
Panama in the invasion ordered by President Bush, who said the
operation was undertaken to protect American lives, safeguard the
Panama Canal and hunt down Noriega.
   Kelly said the invasion, announced under the code name Operation
Just Cause, was planned under a more innocuous name _ Blue Spoon.
   ``Blue Spoon was a sort of covering,'' he said. ``If you had
come across it on a piece of paper, you wouldn't think anything of
something called Blue Spoon.''

   The clock ran out as some 300 contracts between
companies and oil workers expired just after midnight today, with
union leaders threatening to strike individual companies if
negotiations snag.
   ``It is our intention not to call a national strike,'' said
Robert E. Wages, vice president and bargaining coordinator for the
40,000-member Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers International Union.
   ``We may give strike notices to certain companies,'' he said,
referring to the contracts that expired at 12:01 a.m.
   The union rejected the oil industry's two-year contract offer
Wednesday and continued talks with all companies, but said it could
call a strike at any one wwith 24 hours' notice.
   Calls to OCAW's Lakewood-based headquarters and officers' homes
late Wednesday night for comment were not answered.
   Major companies that could be struck include Amoco, Texaco,
Chevron, Mobil, Shell, Atlantic Richfield and Unocal.
   In San Francisco, two OCAW locals agreed to a rolling contract
extension, with talks to continue until one party or the other
gives 24-hour notice. The agreement was confirmed by Jim Payne,
secretary-treasurer of OCAW Local 1-5, representing workers at
Chevron, Tosco and Shell, and by Rick DeLege, president pro tem of
OCAW Local 1-326, which represents Unocal workers.
   Earlier in the day, the union's national bargaining committee
decided not to call an industrywide strike but to strike individual
major companies should impasses develop.
   Wages said the union would extend the negotiations because
``there is at least some reason to believe all of the majors are
interested in talking about the issues.''
   OCAW officials said the contract offered by Amoco Corp., the
pattern contract for the industry, fell short of union demands on
pay, health benefits and environmental concerns. Telephone calls to
Amoco headquarters in Chicago were not returned.
   The average refinery worker's wage now is $15.18 an hour.
   The union seeks $1.25 hourly wage increases in each year of the
two-year pact, about twice what the union says Amoco is offering;
establishment of an independent environmental monitor at each
plant; and increases in the company share of medical insurance
costs.
   Talks began Jan. 1.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, winning bipartisan acclaim in
Congress, is proposing further deep cuts in U.S. and Soviet troop
strength in Europe and declaring ``that time has come'' to swiftly
conclude agreements limiting conventional, strategic and chemical
weapons.
   ``Today, with communism crumbling, our aim must be to ensure
democracy's advance,'' the president said Wednesday night in a
State of the Union speech that blended his new troop withdrawal
proposal with a pledge to withdraw the remainder of the U.S.
invasion force from Panama by the end of the month.
   In a surprise overture, Bush proposed cutting military manpower
in Europe to 195,000 troops on each side, down from the 275,000
figure that was the U.S. bargaining position at conventional force
negotiations in Vienna.
   The president said he called Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
earlier in the day to inform him of the offer, which already had
been endorsed by NATO allies. The move, Bush said, was a response
to ``the revolution of '89'' in which he said the United States
``stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom.''
   Bush said Gorbachev seemed ``receptive'' to the idea and was
studying it.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said on
ABC-TV this morning that the Kremlin was ``satisfied'' with Bush's
troop cut proposal ``as a beginning.'' But he said the Soviets want
all foreign troops out of Europe and, ``if that's Bush's bottom
line, it is unfortunate.''
   In Brussels, Belgium, NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner
said the allies offered their ``broad support in principle'' for
Bush's proposals. ``These new steps take account of new political
developments in the East, while remaining consistent with the needs
of the alliance's strategy of deterrence.''
   The surprise overture was the centerpiece of an address that
also promised to ``invest in America'' through savings incentives,
research and improved education, and called on citizens to
``confront and condemn'' racism and hate.
   Bush also renewed his call for a capital gains tax cut, slapped
down by Democrats last year, and called on lawmakers to pass clean
air, child care, crime and drug legislation.
   But while Congress applauded the troop cuts _ and the savings
they eventually would produce _ Democrats said Bush's rhetoric on
domestic issues did not match the budget he sent to Capitol Hill
just two days earlier.
   On education, ``the president's words seem to agree with us, but
his actions say something else,'' said House Speaker Thomas Foley,
D-Wash., delivering his party's formal response to Bush's
prime-time televised speech.
   Foley ignored the troop proposal in his formal remarks, instead
focusing on the domestic issues congressional Democrats have
decided to make their theme for this election year. ``In the 1990s,
and well into the next century, the central challenge for America
will be economic, not military,'' he said.
   Foley raised the troop cut proposal this morning on NBC's
``Today'' show, saying Democrats are ``in agreement that we ought
to reduce our troops in Europe. I think everyone see3s there is a
change in need there,'' Foley said.
   Lawmakers in both parties saw the troop cut as a welcome
development, with many characterizing the move as an attempt to
catch up with events that outpaced the arms talks.
   ``It was a very good move on his part, because we were falling
behind the curve of popular will,'' said Sen. William Cohen,
R-Maine. ``He had to get way out front. If we didn't make these
kinds of proposals, we'd be seen as being irrelevant to the
process.''
   ``He is rushing to catch the reality of Eastern Europe,'' said
Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont. ``Events in Eastern Europe are pulling
the Pentagon and the president toward decisions they wouldn't
otherwise make.''
   The cuts would place a heavier burden on the Soviet Union, which
has 565,000 troops in Central Europe compared with the U.S. level
of 305,000. But the offer could come as a welcome relief for
Gorbachev, who is under heavy popular pressure to unilaterally
remove Soviet troops from Warsaw Pact countries which are shedding
their ties to Moscow.
   The proposal reflects advice of top military strategists, would
sustain NATO's needs and would help push peaceful change forward,
Bush said.
   ``A swift conclusion to our arms control talks _ conventional,
chemical and strategic _ must now be our goal. That time has
come,'' he said.
   However, Bush's budget provides continued buildups for most
nuclear weapons systems and the Star Wars missile defense, a
reflection of what the president called Moscow's continued
modernization effort in that area.
   In the only other concrete announcement in his speech, Bush said
he would pull back the remaining U.S. troops sent to Panama for the
December invasion by the end of February. The Pentagon said
Wednesday that troop levels now are about 16,000, or about 3,000
more than the pre-invasion number.
   Amid the agreement, there also were signs that a tough year lies
ahead. When Bush repeated his ``no new taxes'' pledge and again
when he vowed to seek a cut in tax rates for capital gains,
Republicans in the House chamber erupted into applause, while
Democrats sat silent.
   And Foley's only mention of foreign policy came in two areas
where Democrats take issue with the administration: South Africa
and China. Condemning Bush's earlier veto of a bill to protect
Chinese students in the United States from deportation, Foley said,
``No Congress and no president should be timid in the defense of
freedom.''
   In his speech, the president condemned racially motivated mail
bombings, saying the nation ``must confront and condemn racism,
anti-Semitism, bigotry and hate.'' And he said, ``Our hearts go out
to our hostages _ our hostages who are ceaselessly on our minds and
in our efforts.''
   Bush also expressed concern over the nation's health care, and
directed Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan to
review recommendations on the quality, cost and accessibility of
the health care system.

   Protests by ethnic Albanians in the
province of Kosovo have caused a backlash in other parts of the
country, including demands by thousands of Slavs to be given
weapons so they can go fight the Albanians.
   State-run television said the province was on ``the verge of
civil war.'' Travelers today reported seeing large columns of army
tanks heading toward Kosovo from the direction of Serbia.
   Tanks also were deployed in February and March 1989, when
trouble last flared in the region.
   Three ethnic Albanians were reported killed Wednesday in Kosovo,
bringing to 18 the death toll in rioting that began eight days ago
in the poor southern province governed by the Serbian republic.
   Fifty-four demonstrators and 44 policemen have been injured,
said Jorgovanka Milojevic, a spokeswoman for the provincial
government. A previous report that a policeman was killed was
erroneous, the government said.
   Authorities warned that traveling through Kosovo was dangerous,
and there were reports of young ethnic Albanians armed with guns,
stopping cars and checking identities.
   The ethnic Albanians, who outnumber Slavs 9-1 among Kosovo's 1.9
million inhabitants, want to regain the autonomy lost when Serbia
took control of the republic's police, judiciary and education
system last year.
   The ethnic Albanians are demanding an end to political trials,
the release of political prisoners and the lifting of a year-old
state of emergency.
   Ethnic Albanian leaders of Kosovo's independent groups urged
federal authorities to avoid a full-scale uprising by holding
immediate talks with ethnic Albanians.
   ``Ethnic Albanians are not terrorists. They are subjected to
terror by the state,'' a statement by the groups said.
   The province's Slavic minority, mostly Serbs and Montenegrins,
contends the Albanians are trying to force them from their
homeland, which borders Albania.
   Yugoslavia is a loose, multi-ethnic Balkan federation of six
republics and two semi-autonomous provinces.
   In addition to its ethnic and considerable economic troubles,
the non-aligned Communist country is in the throes of a political
crisis that principally pits Serbia, the largest republic, against
liberal and Westward-looking Slovenia to the north.
   Serbia is controlled by hard-line Communists who are resisting
the democratic reforms the more prosperous Slovenia is already
implementing. The dispute has led to a serious rift in the ruling
Communist Party.
   In the Montenegrin republic's capital of Titograd on Wednesday,
up to 100,000 Slavs rallied and some fired guns into the air. Some
demanded they be given weapons and volunteered to go to Kosovo to
fight the ``Albanian nationalists.''
   The state news agency Tanjug said three people were killed
Wednesday and five wounded in Glogovac, a village 12 miles south of
Pristina, Kosovo's capital. It said police there used a helicopter
to disperse ``several thousand aggressive'' protesters.
   Belgrade television showed the huge rally of Slavs in Titograd.
Gunfire could be heard and speakers implored demonstrators to stop
firing handguns.
   One speaker said Montenegrin volunteers were signing up to fight
in Kosovo and would travel there unless the authorities ``use all
available methods, including repression,'' to end ``the Albanian
uprising.''
   In Ivangrad, a Montenegrin town, 10,000 people also demonstrated
against ``Albanian separatists and Slovenian and Croatian leaders
supporting them,'' Tanjug said.
   Slovenia, and to a lesser extent Croatia, have sided with the
ethnic Albanians and the rally in Titograd had anti-Slovene
overtones. Slovenian police units have reportedly refused to serve
in Kosovo.
   In Belgrade, the federal and Serbian capital, crowds estimated
in the thousands held rallies. The demonstrations were purportedly
anti-Albanian, but protesters also chanted ``Down with Communism!''
and ``Down with Tito,'' the late Yugoslav president held
responsible by the Serbs for originally giving wide autonomy to
Kosovo.
   Ethnic Albanians began protesting a year ago when Serbia made
constitutional changes to take firmer control of the province. At
least 28 people died in violence in Kosovo over the issue last year.

<HEAD>Thatcher Says Civil Servants Misled Her Over Dirty Tricks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government-sponsored dirty tricks campaign in
Northern Ireland began against the Irish Republican Army in the
1970s but later extended to smearing top British politicians, a
former army press officer said today.
   Colin Wallace has long maintained he was dismissed in 1975, four
years before Mrs. Thatcher became prime minister, for threatening
to expose the program. His dismissal is now under review.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday admitted she had
wrongly denied the existence of the campaign in the past, but she
blamed it on information she received from civil servants.
   On Tuesday, her government confirmed the existence of a covert
program codenamed ``Clockwork Orange'' to feed lies to journalists
reporting from Northern Ireland, where the IRA is fighting to end
British rule.
   Defense Secretary Tom King planned to make a statement to
Parliament today about the dirty-tricks campaign.
   The government has confirmed that a covert disinformation
campaign was waged against the IRA, but it has always insisted
there is no evidence to support Wallace's broader allegations: that
the campaign extended to smearing liberal politicians as Soviet
stooges and sympathizers, and that Wallace was framed on a
manslaughter charge to silence him.
   Wallace says smear targets included the prime minister at the
time, Harold Wilson and his predecessor, Edward Heath.
   The former army press officer says that in addition to his
regular army duties, he led a secret psychological warfare unit in
Northern Ireland in the 1970s. His claim was backed up by his
superior officer.
   Wallace says ``Clockwork Orange'' began as an attempt to
discredit the IRA through false stories, such as the claim the
guerrillas had Soviet rockets armed with unstable explosives.
   He says he also was supposed to spread disinformation designed
to create the suspicion inside extremist groups that they were
being infiltrated.
   The smear campaign ``gradually drew in Northern Ireland
politicians and eventually some of those at Westminster (London),''
Wallace said.
   Merlyn Rees, Labor's Northern Ireland Secretary at the time,
displayed a pro-IRA statement he said was doctored to include his
name. The intention was to paint Labor as sympathetic to terrorism,
he said on BBC-TV Wednesday night.
   Author Paul Foot _ in his book ``Who Framed Colin Wallace?'' _
says Wallace was given detailed briefings by the MI5
counterintelligence agency. He said the aim of the campaign was to
prevent Labor from being re-elected in 1974 and to depose Heath and
former Northern Ireland Minister William Whitelaw from top
positions in the Conservative Party.
   Foot says the MI5 briefings enabled Wallace to make allegations
about homosexuality, bogus bank accounts, corrupt earnings and
Communist sympathies.
   Tony Benn, a former Labor Cabinet minister, told the House of
Commons that former Prime Minister James Callaghan also was
targeted. Foot's book includes the Rev. Ian Paisley, the militant
Protestant leader in Northern Ireland, and former Cabinet ministers.
   Mrs. Thatcher said Wednesday, in a letter to a Conservative
legislator, that a re-examination of government papers ``has
brought to light information which shows that there were a number
of statements in my letters, and in other ministerial statements
and official correspondence, which were incorrect or require
clarification.''
   She said the government was already investigating how the errors
in the handling of the papers occurred.
   ``But of course the matters with which they deal originated
under previous administrations, and present ministers can only deal
with them on the basis of information made available to us,'' she
said.

   The bank tellers of Christmas past are
haunting Charles Dickens.
   Dickens _ a namesake but not a descendant of the author who
wrote of Christmas ghosts in ``A Christmas Carol'' _ was indicted
Tuesday by a federal grand jury on charges of robbing three banks
and trying to hold up a fourth during the holidays.
   Dickens, 36, is accused of taking $1,776 from a PSFS bank on
Dec. 21; $2,316 from a Germantown Savings branch Dec. 26 and $950
from the same branch on Jan. 2; and $1,305 from a Home Unity
Savings and Loan branch Jan. 6.
   He also is charged with unsuccessfully trying to rob the United
Valley Bank on Jan. 2.
   Dickens has been jailed without bail after a teller from an
earlier holdup saw him three weeks ago in front of a bank. Court
records show that other tellers have identified Dickens as the man
who robbed their banks.

   Rival Christian forces fought from house
to house under raining shells today in a showdown for control of
Lebanon's Christian enclave. Police said at least 62 people had
been killed and 216 wounded.
   Hundreds of thousands of civilians huddled in basements and bomb
shelters with dwindling water supplies as troops loyal to renegade
Gen. Michel Aoun fought for a third day with militiamen of the
Lebanese Forces.
   Christian radio stations said a new cease-fire, the third in 24
hours, was called for 9 a.m. in response to renewed Vatican appeals.
   But shellfire and bursts of gunfire persisted in Beirut's
burning Christian sector well after the truce deadline, although
police reported a slight decrease in hostilities that allowed some
casualties to be evacuated.
   Conflicting victory claims made it difficult to determine who
held the upper hand in the fighting, which left fires raging out of
control and morgues packed with bodies.
   Lebanese Forces commander Samir Geagea blamed the confrontation
on Aoun's ``power lust,'' and Aoun blamed the United States.
   ``America has engineered this collision, but we shall surmount
it soon,'' Aoun said in a statement on his television station. He
did not elaborate.
   The U.S. State Department on Wednesday said Aoun should step
down.
   ``Gen. Aoun must realize that his bellicose behavior does not
advance the interests of the Christians or any other community but
only benefits those who want to see Lebanon continue in anarchy and
turmoil,'' the State Department said. ``We reiterate our call for
Gen. Aoun to step aside and to do it now.''
   The fighting in the Christian zone was the worst since February
1989, when Aoun's 20,000 troops last moved against the 6,000-strong
Lebanese Forces. More than 80 people were killed and 200 wounded in
that four-day conflict.
   The battle could break the stalemate over an Arab League peace
plan aimed at ending a 15-year-old civil war that has cost 150,000
Lebanese their lives.
   Aoun opposes the accord, worked out in October, because it does
not guarantee withdrawal from Lebanon of Syria's 40,000 troops,
which he calls an occupation force. Aoun also refuses to recognize
President Elias Hrawi, who was elected as part of the accord.
   Geagea has neither accepted nor rejected the peace accord, but
has recognized Hrawi as president. He and other right-wing
Christians oppose Aoun's rebellion.
   Aoun, increasingly isolated and facing the prospect of a
Syrian-backed assault by the 22,000 soldiers loyal to the Hrawi
government, apparently felt he had to secure control of the
Christian sector.
   The casualty count includes victims felled by stray morder
rounds that exploded in Moslem west and south Beirut, which have
not been involved in the inter-Christian clashes. It also includes
15 people, mainly children, wounded when a shell fired by Aoun's
gunners blasted a government-owned secondary school in Jemmayzeh
district, a stronghold of the Lebanese Forces.
   The school has been used as a shelter by several Christian
families who sought refuge in it to avoid shelling.
   The three daily newspapers operating in Christian east Beirut
failed to publish due to the clashes.
   Shiite Moslem militias, meanwhile, fought Wednesday in southern
Lebanon, continuing the latest round of their intermittent struggle
for supremacy among the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest sect in
the country of 3.5 million people.
   Four people were reported wounded, raising the toll to 98 killed
and 280 wounded in the battle that began Dec. 23 between the
fundamentalist Hezbollah, which is loyal to Iran, and Amal, a
mainstream militia backed by Syria.
   Police said Aoun's mainly Christian troops, spearheaded by the
U.S.-trained 8th Brigade, scored initial successes Wednesday when
they overran four Lebanese Forces barracks on the coastal highway
linking Beirut and north Lebanon.
   But the militia outflanked Aoun's army with tank-led assaults,
seizing his naval base in Kasslik, the armor base of Sarba in
Jounieh and the main air base in Halat, said a police spokesman.
   That reasserted the Lebanese Forces' control of the enclave's
30-mile-long Mediterranean coast and restored their supply lines,
said the spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules.
   The police spokesman said the focal point of ground fighting
early today was a cluster of government buildings housing the
ministries of finance and justice close to Beirut's dividing Green
Line.
   ``There is house-to-house combat there. Buildings are frequently
changing hands in attacks and counterattacks,'' the spokesman said.
   Hrawi called on Aoun's troops to ``disobey and rebel'' against
the general, whom he fired as army commander a few hours after
being elected by Parliament and sworn in Nov. 24.
   ``The army's mission is to protect the citizens, not to kill
them,'' Hrawi said in an interview broadcast by Moslem and
Christian radio stations, indicating he has thrown the weight of
his internationally recognized government behind Geagea in a bid to
oust Aoun from the presidential palace.
   The telephone operator at St. George Greek Orthodox Hospital in
Ashrafiyeh said the facility, one of the two main hospitals in east
Beirut, was ``packed with casualties.''
   ``The morgue is full of bodies. The wounded are on stretchers in
the corridors. The upper floors have been evacuated due to the
fierce shelling duels.''
   ``There are not enough surgeons to operate on the wounded,'' he
said. He would not give his name.

<HEAD>Pope Ends Trip With Appeal for Solidarity with Africa</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Leads with 4 grafs to UPDATE with pope leaving for Rome.

<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II ended an eight-day
African tour today with a plea for regional and international
cooperation to eliminate war, discrimination and human rights
abuses on the continent.
   ``Solidarity between peoples has no borders,'' the pope said.
``The great changes under way in Eastern Europe should not divert
attention from the south, especially from the African continent.''
   John Paul made the appeal in a speech to diplomats at the end of
his trip to five countries of the impoverished Sahel region.
President Hissene Habre and the pontiff spoke at the airport for 10
minutes before the papal aircraft departed for Rome at 1:55 p.m.
   Before leaving, the pontiff celebrated Mass at a soccer stadium
and met with Moslem leaders and other N'Djamena residents at a
hippodrome.
   In the address to the diplomatic corps, the pope noted that Chad
is now enjoying relative peace after years of civil war but said
various conflicts afflicting Africa continue to cause ``sufferings
which seem to have no end.''
   ``I think of Ethiopia, Sudan, of other countries exposed to
racial discrimination, of others where ethnic rivalries sometimes
lead to violence,'' he said.
   The pontiff called on all parties to examine the root causes of
the conflicts, including the oppression of minorities.
   ``One must also have the courage to shed light on the role
exercised by all parties, starting with the most powerful who have
control of the economy, military aid and alliances.''
   ``We must manage to recognize the errors, the abuses of power,
the injustices, the exploitation ... We should always have as the
first objective the respect of the rights and the dignity of man.''
   John Paul praised Africa's charter of human rights, but urged
leaders to ``reduce the distance between words and action'' in
strictly applying the terms of the document.
   He singled out the plight of African refugees forced to flee
their countries because of violence or hunger.
   ``The problem goes beyond the field of action of specialized
organizations...It involves men who should meet their brothers in
humanity.''
   The pope reiterated his appeal for rich countries to provide
economic aid that doesn't enslave Third World recipients. He said
the developed world should also share its scientific and technical
know-how and help poor countries protect the environment and
improve health services.
   John Paul also challenged African nations to collaborate more
closely among themselves in fields such as energy production,
transport, agriculture and industry.
   African organizations should be more active as ``true
instruments of promotion of peace and development to the benefit of
all their members,'' he said.
   In his homily during the Mass, the pope urged married couples to
observe fidelity and respect ``the woman's vocation to be a
mother.''
   In the ceremony at the hippodrome, he encouraged Chadians in
their effort to build up the country after the long years of civil
war and fighting with neighboring Libya.
   Without mentioning Libya, he invited Chad to offer ``gestures of
solidarity with the African countries which surround you.''
   Aside from Chad, the pope's sixth voyage to Africa took him to
Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mali and Burkina Faso.

<HEAD>Declaration of Independence Brings $1.6 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An auction record was set for a single printed
piece of Americana when a copy of the first printing of the
Declaration of Independence was sold for $1.6 million, Sotheby's
announced.
   A Chicago rare book and manuscript dealer, Ralph G. Newman,
bought the document Wednesday. He now holds one of only two copies
remaining in private hands, said Laura Stewart, a spokeswoman for
the auction house. Twenty-three copies are known to exist.
   Its pre-sale estimate was $400,000 to $600,000.
   Also Wednesday, George Washington's own copy of the Federalist
Papers sold for $1.4 million to a private American collector, who
bid by telephone and did not want to be identified, Stewart said.
   The papers are a set of 85 articles written by Alexander
Hamilton, James Madison and John Jay, published in 1787 and 1788
analyzing the Constitution and urging its passage.
   The price was more than triple the pre-sale estimate and set a
record for an association copy _ something whose value is enhanced
by having belonged to someone famous, Stewart said.
   The items were part of a two-day sale of Americana and American
and children's literature from the library of H. Bradley Martin, a
noted book collector who died in 1988 at age 82.
   All prices quoted include the 10 percent fee paid by the buyer
to the auction house on top of what he or she bid.

<HEAD>Feb. 22 Launch on Target Despite Engine Repair, NASA Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA decided to replace a fuel
turbopump in space shuttle Atlantis but said the repairs probably
will not delay the shuttle's launch, now set for Feb. 22.
   Technicians began the week-long job of replacing the turbopump,
located in one of the spaceship's three engines, late Wednesday,
according to Conrad Nagel, who leads a NASA team readying Atlantis
for launch.
   Nagel said the repair work was not expected to interrupt flight
preparations although the schedule is ``a little soft. If things go
well, there shouldn't be any impact to the launch date,'' Nagel
said.
   Atlantis is scheduled to carry a secret cargo into space for the
Department of Defense. The National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has not set an official launch date, but the liftoff
is targeted for Feb. 22.
   The turbopump became a concern after the failure of an unrelated
fuel pump duct during a routine pressure test at the engine's
manufacturer, the Rocketdyne Division of Rockwell International in
Canoga Park, Calif.
   The failure was in a titanium weld done outside the factory,
according to Nagel. An in-flight failure could hinder the flow of
fuel to the engine.
   ``That lead us to inspect other such welds, and this turbopump
is suspect,'' Nagel said. ``We don't think we have a problem with
it, but safety first.''
   NASA's concern for safety also lead engineers to order the
replacement of a seal in an ignition controller on one of Atlantis
two solid-fuel booster rockets.
   That work, announced several days ago and planned for Sunday,
was not expected to cause a launch delay either, according to Nagel.
   Post-flight inspections of the reusable rockets used to boost
Columbia into space Jan. 9 showed a tiny void in an identical seal.
   The void is located in a backup seal on a gasket attached to a
device on the cone-shaped portion of the rocket. It was missed
during tests at the booster's manufacturer, Thiokol Corp. in Utah,
according to Nagel.
   ``You would be hard pressed to see it with the naked eye,'' he
said, but technicians will replace the Atlantis seal to be
``ultra-conservative.''

<HEAD>Woman Accused Of Bigamy Pleads to Lesser Charge _ `Unlawful
Imprisonment'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman charged with bigamy for marrying
two men in eight months pleaded to the lesser charge of unlawful
imprisonment and was put on six months' probation.
   When asked how he selected the lesser charge, Assistant District
Attorney Thomas Lenkiewicz replied, ``Obviously you've never been
married,'' drawing a chuckle from spectators in the courtroom
Wednesday.
   ``If bigamy is unlawful imprisonment, is a legal marriage lawful
imprisonment?'' mused James Resti, who represented Debra Sprague,
23, of Syracuse.
   City Judge Jeffrey Merrill said if Ms. Sprague remains on good
behavior for six months, he will dismiss the charge.
   Ms. Sprague declined to comment, other than to say that she is
estranged from both husbands. She left the court with a boyfriend.
   Ms. Sprague was charged with bigamy in September 1988 for her
marriage to Renzie T. Jay in July 1988. She had married William C.
Sprague in December 1987.
   Sprague told Syracuse police he and his wife lived together off
and on for about three weeks after their wedding before she began
leaving home for weeks at a time.
   In August 1988, he found out from her mother that his wife had
married again and contacted police.
   Neither husband was present in court Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   A sophisticated radio receiver soon to
be installed in Argentina will help scientists scan the whole
universe as they expand their search for signals from intelligent
aliens in space.
   ``One of the fundamental questions that has faced the human
species throughout history is, `Are we alone? ... What is our place
in the cosmos?''' said Louis Friedman, executive director of the
non-profit Planetary Society.
   Tim Lynch, the group's program director, called the search for
extraterrestrials ``almost spiritual because if we find there is
another civilization somewhere else, it's evidence this planet can
survive as well.''
   The Planetary Society _ a Pasadena-based group that advocates
space exploration _ raised $150,000 from its 125,000 members in 70
countries to pay for the high-tech radio signal analyzer, named
Megachannel Extraterrestrial Assay II.
   META II, the size of two large refrigerators, will be flown to
Argentina's Institute of Radioastronomy in two to three weeks, said
Thomas McDonough, who coordinates the Planetary Society's part of
the worldwide Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence program,
known as SETI.
   Two Argentine engineers have been building the device at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Oak Ridge Observatory in Harvard, Mass., west
of Boston.
   Since 1985, the society's identical META receiver at the
observatory has scanned the space visible from the Northern
Hemisphere seeking a radio signal from an alien civilization.
   Steven Spielberg, director of the film ``E.T., the
Extra-Terrestrial,'' donated $100,000 for the first META project.
   Since 1960, astronomers have conducted more than 50 separate but
mostly limited searches for any radio waves that may have been
intentionally beamed into space by extraterrestrials.
   Almost all previous searches listened to space visible from the
Northern Hemisphere, with only brief, partial scans of Southern
Hemisphere skies from Australia and the Argentine institute,
located in a park 30 miles southeast of Buenos Aires.
   META II tests will start in June after the 8.4 million-channel
receiver is hooked to one of the institute's two dish-shaped,
98-foot-wide radiotelescope antennas.
   By its dedication on Oct. 12 _ the holiday commemorating
Christopher Columbus' discovery of the New World in 1492 _ the
device will spend at least 12 hours daily for three or more years
listening for signs that humanity is not alone.
   With both META receivers working, the Planetary Society will be
conducting ``the first systematic search of the universe as a whole
for signals from another civilization,'' McDonough said. ``This
could be the system that makes the first contact with another
civilization.''
   ``There are so many stars like the sun that it's impossible to
think the sun is the only one that has life on an orbiting
planet,'' said Raul Colomb, director of the Argentine institute.
   Colomb discussed the META II project during visits to the
Planetary Society on Tuesday and to NASA and the SETI Institute in
Mountain View on Wednesday. Speaking in somewhat broken English,
Colomb joked: ``I hope if we make contact, they (extraterrestrials)
can understand Spanish, too.''
   Scientists would know they discovered an alien civilization if
they found an ultranarrow frequency signal that laws of physics say
couldn't come from any natural phenomenon or Earthly source,
McDonough said
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists plan a
more sophisticated SETI effort. They plan to start listening to the
Northern Hemisphere in 1992 and the Southern Hemisphere no earlier
than 1995, said Nick Renzetti, who heads the radioastronomy effort
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   But the 10-year, $100 million effort may lag because NASA budget
increases are smaller than proposed, he added.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cosmonaut Alexander A. Serebrov cruised through
space today on a special motorcycle designed to rescue spacemen in
distress. It was the cycle's maiden voyage, and Soviet officials
said it performed well.
   Soviet television interrupted its regular programs several times
during the day for special coverage of the space ride, which took
Serebrov as far as 33 yards from the orbiting Mir space station.
   Live pictures showed Serebrov attached to a tether anchored on
Mir as he prepared to ride the cycle, which looks more like a
floating armchair than a motorcycle.
   The device, formally known as the Cosmonaut Movement System, is
similar to the Manned Maneuvering Unit that U.S. space shuttle
astronauts have used, Soviet space officials say.
   It weighs 484 pounds, has 32 motors, and is designed to repair
satellites and rescue spacemen. It can move to a maximum distance
of 50 yards from Mir.
   The cycle was delivered to Mir on Dec. 6.
   Mission commander Alexander S. Viktorenko, 42, stayed at Mir's
exit hatch and monitored the cycle's operations. He and Serebrov,
the flight engineer, have been aboard Mir since September.
   The 20-ton Mir was launched in February 1988 and was designed to
be permanently manned, but it was mothballed in April for four
months because a module and another add-on were not ready, and
because it would have cost too much money to keep a crew aboard.
   Mir already is joined with Kvant, an astrophysics laboratory.

<HEAD>China's Communist Party Expels Leading Intellectual</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party has expelled a leading
intellectual for joining in the spring pro-democracy movement,
according to an official report that reached Beijing today.
   Wen Yuankai, a professor at the Chinese University of Science
and Technology in the central city of Hefei, was expelled late last
year, according to a local radio broadcast of Jan. 20.
   The broadcast was reported today by the British Broadcasting
Corp.'s monitoring service.
   Wen made a speech in Beijing's Tiananmen Square in May
supporting the students camped there to demand democratic change.
He and other intellectuals urged the government to talk with the
students.
   After the government imposed martial law in Beijing on May 20,
he and other professors at his university appealed for it to be
lifted.
   ``Wen Yuankai has obstinately adhered to the stand of bourgeois
liberalization,'' the radio said. Bourgeois liberalism is the
official term for Western democratic ideas.
   ``He went all out to advocate the need to increase openness and
promote political restructuring,'' it said. ``He also vigorously
plotted and egged on riots in the Hefei area. Both the nature and
consequences of his mistakes are extremely serious.''
   The radio said he had been expelled from the party in order to
purify it.
   The Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao reported recently that Wen was
not under arrest but had to obtain permission to leave campus, and
was writing a self-criticism, an essay that sets out one's thoughts
and actions and expresses contrition.
   So far, the 48 million-member ruling party has publicly
announced the expulsions of only about half a dozen prominent
members due to their roles in the protests that were crushed in
June. However, in many places party members are being required to
re-register, giving party officials a chance to review their rolls
and drop any members considered unacceptable.
   Top party leaders have stressed repeatedly since June the need
to strengthen party discipline and expel any members who do not
adhere to the party line.
   Party membership can be essential to professional advancement.
   Others who have been expelled from the party include Wan Runnan
and Yan Jiaqi, who fled abroad and have helped form an exile
organization to promote democratic reform in China.

   Scores of Tibetans held a demonstration
in the capital today, demanding the withdrawal of Chinese troops
from their homeland and the release of political prisoners.
   Carrying placards saying ``Tibet for Tibetans'' and ``Lift
Martial Law in Tibet,'' the demonstrators gathered near Parliament
House and burned the Chinese flag. The demonstrators later
presented memorandums to Prime Minister V.P. Singh's office and the
Chinese Embassy in New Delhi.
   China invaded Tibet in 1949 and annexed it a year later. The
spiritual leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama, fled to India after an
abortive uprising against Chinese rule in 1959 and set up a
government-in-exile.
   The Dalai Lama, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989,
lives in Dharamsala, a northern Indian town on the foothills of the
Himalayas, along with about 100,000 followers.
   Martial law was imposed in Tibet on March 8, 1989, in an attempt
to put down an uprising by pro-independence demonstrators. At least
20 people are believed to have been killed in the rioting and
hundreds arrested.

<HEAD>Construction Spending Shows Lowest Increase in Seven Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Construction spending, held back by severe
weather, fell 0.6 percent in December, reversing a November gain
and ending 1989 with the lowest increase in seven years, the
government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction spending totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $414.6 billion in December, the lowest rate since
last June's 1 percent decline.
   For the year, spending totaled $414.7 billion, up 1.2 percent
from 1988. The increase was the lowest since a 5.1 percent decline
in the 1982 recession year. Spending increased 3 percent in 1988.
   Residential spending was pushed down 0.7 percent in December by
a 2.8 percent decline in multi-family construction. Single-family
spending was up 0.4 percent. Residential spending represents about
50 percent of the total.
   Non-residential spending was off 4.3 percent while government
spending, which represents about 20 percent of the total, was up
2.9 percent, boosted by a 9.3 percent increase in highway and
street expenditures.
   The decrease in December spending offset a 0.7 percent advance
in November, which followed a 0.4 percent decline in October. The
Novemer increase was revised downward from the 1.5 percent gain
originally reported.
   For the year, residential spending declined 1.1 percent,
non-residential gained 2.4 percent and government spending was up
3.8 percent.
   In addition to the effects of the unusually cold weather in
December, construction was constrained throughout much of the year
by high interest rates and fell to a yearly low of an annual rate
of $410.3 billion last July.
   But as the Fed appeared to succeed in driving down inflation, it
permitted rates to fall gradually in recent months and analysts
have been saying the lower rates should result in increased
construction.
   Residential spending in December totaled a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $191 billion, including $134.9 billion on
single-family housing and $20.6 billion on multi-family
construction.
   Non-residential construction totaled $96.7 billion and
government spending, $91.1 billion.

<HEAD>Judge Rules Clinic Blockades Don't Violate Women's Civil Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-abortion protesters who blockade
entrances to women's clinics are not violating the civil rights of
all prospective patients trying to get inside, a federal judge
ruled.
   U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima on Wednesday said clinics
and pro-choice activists failed to prove in their lawsuit that the
anti-abortion blockades were aimed at all women.
   ``The allegations ... clearly show that the (intent) is directed
at women seeking abortions and not at pregnant women generally or
at women as a class,'' Tashima said in an eight-page ruling.
   Tashima ruled in September that civil rights law did not protect
women seeking abortions. Carol Sobel, an attorney with the American
Civil Liberties Union, then amended the complaint to allege that
the blockades violate the civil rights of all women, who would be
discouraged from entering medical clinics offering services besides
abortions.
   ``Plaintiffs confuse effect with motive,'' Tashima said. ``The
class must be based on (intent), not effect.''
   Ms. Sobel said she would appeal the ruling to the 9th Circuit
Court of Appeals this week. She also vowed to request an emergency
stay of Tashima's ruling, which lifted an order issued in March
barring the blockades.
   ``I think the judge is wrong,'' Ms. Sobel said. ``You're talking
about a conspiracy to deprive women of medical care that relates
only to women.''
   Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group that staged clinic
blockades nationwide, applauded the ruling, saying it affirmed the
group's argument that its actions are aimed at abortion, not all
women, said Victor Smith, an attorney for the group.

   President Bush's proposal for deeper troop cuts in
Central Europe was a step in the right direction, but it failed to
go far enough, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said
today.
   In a surprise overture, Bush proposed in his State of the Union
message Wednesday a cut in military manpower in Europe to 195,000
troops on each side. The previous U.S. bargaining position at
conventional force negotiations in Vienna was 275,000 on each side.
   ``It's a good sign that things are changing for the better,''
Gerasimov said in a news briefing. ``Some observers note that the
events in Europe run ahead of the slow diplomatic negotiations.''
   Gerasimov criticized the proposal for not going far enough.
``You can note in his speech that he needs American troops in
Europe from here to eternity _ 125,000 or about this figure. This
is not a good sign.''
   ``We together with Les Aspin (chairman of the U.S. House Armed
Services Committee) feel it must be the ceiling, not the floor.''
   Bush said in his speech that he and the United States' European
allies agree ``that an American military presence in Europe is
essential _ and that it should not be tied solely for the Soviet
military presence in Eastern Europe.''
   Gerasimov also complained that the proposal applies only to
troops in Central Europe and would leave the United States with
30,000 or more troops in Britain, Greece and other countries in
Europe.
   ``So it comes out that the U.S. is to have 235,000 troops,''
Gerasimov said. This will have to be considered at the conventional
arms talks in Vienna, he said.
   Gerasimov also complained that Bush seemed to take credit for
the ``revolution of 1989,'' as the American president called it.
   He said attempts to show these events as a triumph of U.S.
ideals and a failure of communism ``are a relic of the Cold War.''
He added that the U.S. invasion of Panama was further evidence of
this attitude.
   In his speech, Bush said that the remarkable events of 1989
``validate the long-standing goals of American policy _ a policy
based on a single, shining principle: the cause of freedom. America
_ not just the nation _ but an idea, alive in the minds of people
everywhere.''
   Overall, however, Gerasimov repeated that, ``We want to see in
Bush's address a signal to use to the maximum the unique chance of
1990 to improve Soviet-American cooperation.''

   West European leaders today generally welcomed
President Bush's proposals for troop withdrawals from Europe.
   But the West Europeans stressed that they wanted a continued
U.S. military presence, and Britain said it hoped no further cuts
were planned.
   In Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, Gennady
Gerasimov, today called the proposal a step in the right direction,
but he criticized it for failing to go far enough.
   ``You can note in his speech that he needs American troops in
Europe from here to eternity _ 125,000 or about this figure. This
is not a good sign,'' Gerasimov said.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said in a statement
that she attached ``great importance to President Bush's assurance
that the new figure will be a floor and that no more reductions are
envisaged.''
   ``This will ensure a continued strong American presence in
Europe,'' the statement added.
   Thatcher aides said Bush telephoned her on Saturday to discuss
the proposal. ``We indicated our support,'' the Downing Street
statement said.
   Bush, in his State of the Union message Wednesday, proposed that
Washington and Moscow cut troops levels in Central Europe to
195,000 on each side _ below the 275,000 figure being negotiated at
talks in Vienna.
   The United States has 305,000 troops in Central Europe, and the
Soviet Union has 565,000. Another 30,000 U.S. troops in Britain and
southern Europe are excluded from the Bush proposal.
   A U.S. official has said Bush sent Lawrence Eagleburger, his
deputy secretary of state, and Robert Gates, the deputy national
security adviser, to present his plan to the leaders of Britain,
France, West Germany and Italy.
   Having secured endorsement from these major West European
nations, Bush then called Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
inform him of the proposal.
   In West Germany, where most of the U.S. troops are deployed,
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher called Bush's proposal ``an
important step forward.'' West German Defense Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg called it ``a balanced combination of disarmament
policy and unequivocal recognition of the West's defense readiness
and alliance solidarity.''
   The enthusiasm reflected the eagerness with which West Germany
is seeking reunification with East Germany.
   The caution in Britain and some of the other NATO allies in
Europe underlined anxieties about the prospect of the American
troops leaving, and about German reunification. There are 380,000
Soviet troops in East Germany.
   Manfred Woerner, secretary general of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, said in Brussels that the European
allies offered their ``broad support in principle.''
   Woerner said the Bush plan was consistent with U.S. promises
``to maintain significant military forces in Europe as necessary to
alliance security.''
   In Paris, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas called the
proposal ``an important step on the road to disarmament... Bush set
an objective that takes into account at the same time Europeans'
desire for disaramament and their security concerns.''
   Some smaller West European nations followed Mrs. Thatcher's
basically cautious line.
   ``There have to be talks on the withdrawal of troops, and I
oppose a unilateral initiative,'' said Belgian Foreign Affairs
Minister Mark Eyskens.
   Last week Belgium said it is considering pulling its troops out
of West Germany because of the demise of hard-line Communist
leaderships in countries across Eastern Europe.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek considered a cutback
to 195,000 troops would be the ``minimum level'' needed, Dutch
television reported.
   A Dutch Foreign ministry statement said the proposed reductions
were ``feasible'' because of the developments in Eastern Europe,
but stressed the Soviets must match the American withdrawals.
   Norway's Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik said in a radio
interview that ``the presence of U.S. troops in Europe is still
needed. We don't see it as a problem if their presence would be at
a lower level than now.''

   Roy Lee Snelling Sr. was
watching the television program ``Rescue 911'' when a stray bullet
crashed through a window, an interior wall and his chair and struck
him in the back.
   Moments later, his wife was calling 911.
   ``I was standing right beside him doing some ironing, when we
heard a shot. My husband grabbed his chest and said, `I've been
shot.' I though he was kidding at first, then I saw the blood,''
said his wife, Rosa Lee Snelling.
   The bullet narrowly missed Snelling's spine and lodged in his
lower right lung, said Capt. Tim Martin of the Clay County
sheriff's office.
   ``On television, they show them (medics) telling people to calm
down and talk slowly. Well, they had to tell me to slow down,
too,'' Mrs. Snelling said.
   Snelling was in stable condition today at Humana Hospital in
nearby Orange Park.
   The gunshot apparently was fired from behind the Snelling's
rural home and police theorize that someone may have been shooting
at a road sign.

   Cold Canadian air crept eastward today from the Northern Plains,
where high temperatures were below zero in Montana and northwestern
North Dakota, and heavy rain caused flooding in Texas.
   The rain, which also extended into Arkansas, triggered street
flooding today in northern Texas with the Johnson County town of
Alvarado reporting water more than a foot deep in some areas.
   Police in the Dallas-Fort Worth area rescued several motorists
who drove into deep water covering roads and streets. No injuries
were reported.
   Farther west, a storm system spread rain and snow along the
Pacific Coast with winds gusting to 60 mph.
   The National Weather Service in San Francisco called a flood
advisory after automated buoys showed offshore waves as high as 29
feet.
   Rain soaked much of the northern and central Pacific Coast, with
snow falling in mountains as far east as Wyoming and northern
Colorado.
   Wind of 30 to 40 mph, gusting near 60 mph ,was forecast for the
Washington coast.
   Snoqualmie Pass in Washington picked up an additional 8 inches
of snow Wednesday, giving ski areas that had bare slopes in the
early season nearly 6 feet in the past week.
   Highway crews in northwestern Montana on Wednesday rescued
several motorists trapped behind an avalanche measuring 100 feet
wide and 5 feet deep on U.S. 2 near the Continental Divide. Part of
the highway remained closed today because of blowing snow.
   Up to 19 inches of new snow had fallen in the Columbia Falls,
Mont., area by Wednesday afternoon, whipped by northeasterly winds
up to 40 mph. An additional 6 to 12 inches of snow was possible
today, with wind chills expected as low as 70 below.
   At 7 a.m. MST today, Cut Bank, Mont., had a wind chill factor of
49 degrees below zero.
   Along the Great Lakes, 10 inches of snow had fallen on
Michigan's Upper Peninsula around Sault Ste. Marie, but streets and
side roads remained unplowed today because 65 employees of the
Chippewa County road commission went on strike at midnight in a
contract dispute. State crews plowed highways. Most schools in the
area were closed.
   A cold front that crossed the Southwest dumped snow on parts of
Arizona and Utah on Wednesday. Flagstaff, Ariz., received 8 inches
Tuesday night and Wednesday.
   A few showers and thunderstorms developed along a cold front
over southern Florida.
   The nation's high of 85 degrees Wednesday was set in McAllen,
Texas, and in the Florida cities of Fort Myers, Miami, Naples and
Vero Beach.
   The coldest reading in the Lower 48 on Wednesday was 22 below at
International Falls, Minn.
   Circle City, Alaska, though, was much colder: minus 61.
   In Valdez, Alaska, more than 13 feet of snow fell in January.
The community on Prince William Sound weathered a record one-day
snow of 47{ inches on Jan. 16 and, as of Wednesday, was 8 inches
away from breaking the snowfall accumulation record of 384.7 inches
set in 1986-87.

<HEAD>Dukakis Blasts Bush on Boston Harbor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President George Bush's concern for the pollution
in Boston Harbor ended when he moved into the White House,
complains Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   Bush made headlines in the presidential race when he chartered a
boat for a tour of the historic harbor and blamed Dukakis for its
pollution, but his new budget, unveiled Monday, leaves out $20
million that Congress had authorized for cleaning up the waterway.
   The campaign talk was a ``fraud,'' Dukakis, the unsuccessful
1988 Democratic nominee, said Wednesday.
   ``It was just a lot of political talk,'' Dukakis said. ``When
push comes to shove, no money for Boston Harbor. Isn't that sad.''
   The state is under a court order to clean the harbor, where the
city of Boston and surrounding towns have dumped sewage for
hundreds of years. It has repeatedly been rated among the nation's
most-polluted waterways.
   In September 1988 Bush hired a ferry, filled it with reporters
and supporters and cruised the harbor, accusing Dukakis of dallying
while it got ``dirtier and dirtier.''
   ``Two hundred years ago, tea was spilled in the Boston Harbor in
the name of liberty,'' Bush had said. ``If tea were spilled in the
Boston Harbor today, it would dissolve in the residue of my
opponent's neglect and delay.''
   Michael Deland, chairman of the president's Council on
Environmental Quality, blamed the omission of funds on the tight
federal budget. ``If there were surpluses of money around, that
would be one thing,'' Deland said. ``But there are not.''
   Back in 1988, Bush brushed aside the fact that the Environmental
Protection Agency had taken three years to act on the state's
requests for help with the harbor, saying he was more interested in
directing attention to what he would do if president.
   The $20 million Bush left out of his budget would pay for a
tunnel that would carry sewage to a new treatment plant.
   Paul Levy, who heads the agency responsible for the $6 billion
harbor cleanup, said the state will have to try to persuade
Congress to put the $20 million back in the budget.
   If Congress doesn't approve the money again, the bill will go to
Boston-area residents, who already face escalating water and sewer
costs, because the court order requires the state to build the
tunnel, with or without the federal money.
   Dukakis said he isn't bitter.
   ``That's water over the dam, if you'll pardon the pun,'' Dukakis
said.

<TEXT>
   A 68-year-old man has been
sentenced to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to
operating a prostitution ring involving dozens of prostitutes in at
least 12 Florida cities.
   Roy Spears pleaded guilty Wednesday to one count of racketeering
and six counts of deriving support from prostitution in the
operation of the ring that prosecutors said he ran from 1985 to
1988.
   In exchange for his guilty plea, prosecutors agreed to dismiss
64 other charges.
   Circuit Judge Giles P. Lewis sentenced Spears to seven years in
prison on the racketeering charge and five years on each of the six
other charges. The sentences will run concurrently. With the 15
months Spears spent in jail while awaiting trial, Spears could
serve as little as six to eight more months, said John Matthews,
his attorney.
   Authorities said Spears earned about $1 million in a 16-month
period from the ring, which operated as the A-Able Escort Service.
   Spears' girlfriend and co-defendant, Michelle Marie de Laurie,
was sentenced in 1988 to four five-year terms in prison, all to run
concurrently, and 10 years' probation.
   During a six-month investigation, authorities arrested 60 people
who police said worked for the escort service.

   West Germany would be dealt the hardest
economic blow by the large-scale U.S. troop cuts in Europe that
President Bush proposed in his State of the Union speech.
   Bush proposed that U.S. and Soviet troops be reduced to 225,000
in Europe _ down to 195,000 in Central Europe _ because of the
dizzying collapse of East bloc Communist regimes.
   About 250,000 U.S. servicemen are based in West Germany alone,
with another 55,000 in Britain, Italy, Turkey and Greece.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher called
Bush's proposal ``an important step forward.'' West German Defense
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it ``a balanced combination of
disarmament policy and unequivocal recognition of the West's
defense readiness and alliance solidarity.''
   The Cologne-based German Economics Institute reported in a July
study that West Germany earns $5 billion a year from U.S. military
expenditures. It warned that a troop pullout would mean ``economic
collapse'' for regions that are heavily dependent on the American
presence.
   An extensive analysis of the U.S. bases was undertaken because
of the growing public tendency to see American troops as a burden,
institute director for economic and scientific affairs Otto Vogel
said at the time.
   There has been increasing support in recent months for troop
cuts as a way to reduce tensions in Europe and move the German
states closer to reunification now that the Communists in East
Germany no longer have a monopoly on power.
   East Germany is the Kremlin's most critical military ally, and
about 400,000 of the 565,000 Soviet troops in Europe are stationed
in the country.
   The Kremlin does not want to lose its front-line bases in East
Germany, but it has indicated it could accept a neutral state.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow was in Moscow meeting with Kremlin
leaders this week but there was no word on whether they discussed
the extremely sensitive topic of reducing Soviet troops in East
Germany.
   As they move away from four decades of Kremlin domination,
Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia are pushing for the complete
withdrawal of Soviet troops from their territory. None of the three
are considered nearly as crucial to Soviet security as East Germany.
   West Germany is under pressure to remain in NATO and keep troops
as part of its commitment to the Western defense alliance. The
troops, however, are an obstacle to reunification.
   Last May, Bush proposed a 275,000 ceiling on U.S. and on Soviet
forces in Central Europe and said negotiations to reach that goal
should be wrapped up within a year.
   Before now, Bush has said he would not support further cuts
until the current talks were wrapped up. But, a senior
administration official said, ``Events were running ahead of the
negotiations.''

   The four blacks who were denied service
at an all-white Woolworth lunch counter 30 years ago were greeted
today by a black Woolworth vice president before sitting down to a
breakfast of eggs, grits, bacon and coffee.
   David Richmond, Franklin McCain, Jibreel Khazan and Joseph
McNeil entered the store at 7:30 a.m. and, surrounded by dozens of
reporters and onlookers, ordered from two women who had been
working there on Feb. 1, 1960. Three of the men wore business
suits. Khazan, formerly Ezell Blair Jr., wore a white robe with a
headband around his dreadlocks.
   They were greeted by Woolworth Vice President Aubrey Lewis, who
noted that 30 years ago he, too, would have been denied service.
   ``I'm proud you had the courage to open the doors for a
movement,'' Lewis said.
   While the four waited for their meals, some onlookers began
singing ``We Shall Overcome.'' Outside the store there was more
singing directed by the NAACP and some bystanders carried placards
saying, ``Feb. 1, 1960. It seems like only yesterday but it could
be tomorrow'' and ``The only thing that's worthwhile is change _
Remembering Feb. 1, 1960.''
   Back in 1960, public buildings in Greensboro had separate water
fountains for whites and blacks. Theaters had separate entrances
for blacks, who were forced to sit in balconies, away from whites.
Blacks had to step to the rear on city buses.
   When the four, all freshmen at North Carolina A&amp;T State
University, refused to leave the counter 30 years ago, their sit-in
touched off protests in nine states and helped ignite the civil
rights movement.
   ``We were scared,'' McCain recalled. ``I just wanted a Coke and
a doughnut. That's all I wanted.''
   ``We did get some encouragement on the first day and we got it
from quarters you wouldn't ordinarily expect it to come from,'' he
said. ``There was a little old white lady of oh, 75 years of age,
who came over and placed hands on our shoulders and said to us,
`Boys, I'm so proud of you. The only thing I regret is that it
didn't happen 20 years earlier.'
   ``That was really a source of inspiration to us.''
   Geneva Tisdale, a black working at Woolworth that day, said she
never envisioned the scope of the events.
   ``I never thought they were serious,'' she said.
   The other counter worker, Ima Edwards, agreed, saying, ``I just
thought they came in to try something. I didn't see it blossoming
into this.''
   Ms. Edwards, who is white, said that, in retrospect, the
demonstrations were worthwhile.
   ``This is something that should be,'' she said. ``No race should
be discriminated against where they can't come in somewhere to
eat.''
   In his book, ``Civilities and Civil Rights,'' Duke University
historian William Chafe said the Woolworth sit-ins helped ignite
the civil rights movement.
   ``The long road that would lead from Greensboro to Selma to
Black Power and beyond had found its starting point,'' he wrote.
Selma was the site of an important 1965 march for black voting
rights.
   Chafe's 1980 book was the subject of a panel discussion at the
University of North Carolina-Greensboro on Wednesday night, the
start of a five-day commemoration.
   ``People are coming in from everywhere,'' said Hal Sieber, a
member of the organizing committee. ``Everybody's all charged up
and ready to go.''
   Following today's re-enactment, about 400 people marched from
North Carolina A&amp;T State University to the Woolworth store, where a
plaque and footprints were dedicated and the name of that section
of street was changed from Sycamore to February One Place.
   Later in the day, organizers planned to unveil a sculpture
marking the event at the university.
   An awards banquet and a jazz concert featuring trumpeter Dizzy
Gillespie also were scheduled.
   Before going to Woolworths in 1960, the four agreed they would
be courteous and would not miss any classes. They also agreed it
would be a non-violent demonstration.
   They targeted Woolworths because it was a national chain that
allowed its lunch counters to be segregated only in the South.
   The four were prepared to go to jail, but police allowed them to
go back to school. That night, news about the sit-in spread quickly
across the campus.
   The next day, more than two dozen male and female students
showed up at the lunch counter. They, too, were denied service.
   On the third day, the demonstrations spread to the Kress
five-and-dime down the street.
   The sit-ins quickly became national news. Gov. Luther Hodges was
not sympathetic, calling the sit-ins ``counterproductive'' and a
threat to law and order.
   Crowds began gathering outside the store to watch the students.
Hecklers _ including some members of the Ku Klux Klan _ taunted
them.
   For several months, the owners of downtown Greensboro
restaurants refused to change their whites-only policy, fearing
integration would drive away white customers.
   On July 25, 1960, Woolworth agreed to allow blacks at the lunch
counter. Later accounts reported the chain lost about $200,000 in
business during the sit-ins.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today that after nine years close to Washington's power center, he
has found ``power doesn't really bring the fulfillment that many
think it does.''
   Baker told a roomful of politicians and diplomats at the annual
National Prayer Breakfast that ``inner security and true, real
fulfillment comes by faith. It doesn't come by wielding power in a
town where power is king.''
   President Bush, in brief remarks at the breakfast where Baker
was keynote speaker, said, ``I am convinced that the 1990s will be
the decade of the rebirth ... of faith and hope.'' The rapid
opening of communist nations in Eastern Europe helped lead to that
conviction, he said.
   Bush also said, ``A truly religious nation is a tolerant nation.
We cherish dissent. We cherish the fact that we have many, many
faiths. And we protect even the rights of disbelief.''
   Baker said he used to think that being a success meant never
admitting hurt or problems, but that changed several years ago. He
said at that time he was having a particularly difficult problem
and his wife, Susan, helped him pray and see that ``I really needed
to stop trying to play God and turn the matter over to faith.''
   Baker, a former Treasury secretary and chief of staff under
President Reagan, described his own religious feelings, revealing a
seldom-seen side of a man with a smooth demeanor who usually seems
to keep his feelings tightly controlled.
   Baker said he gains strength from prayer and from regular
meetings ``for fellowship'' with a small group of ``very normal
guys who just happen to hold positions of power and influence in
Washington.''
   The group supports one another in ``trying to live a life of
faith,'' he said.
   Baker characterized himself as ``just one person genuinely
struggling to put faith into practice in my life.''
   Living in a city of power and politics, he said he has learned
that ``Power, of course, can be intoxicating, it can be addictive
and few doubt that .. power tends to corrupt and absolute power
corrupts absolutely.''
   ``Over these last nine years, I have had opportunities to
participate in the exercise of more power than I ever would have
imagined. I have felt the weight of responsibility that that brings
and I have to admit to you as well that I have felt the temptations
that are attendant to it,'' Baker siad.
   ``I found early on that having a position of power really
doesn't bring the fulfillment that many people think it does,'' he
said. ``Of course it does bring excitment. It brings a sense of
satisfaction when things go well, disappointment when they don't,
and it brings invitations to some of the most exclusive gatherings
in the world.''
   However, he said, ``For someone who likes to go to bed at 9:30
at night, that is not necessarily a plus.''

<HEAD>Front Proposes Giving Interim Parliament Veto Power Over Its

   The revolutionary government today
proposed the creation of an interim ``mini-parliament'' with veto
power over the ruling council until Romania's first free postwar
elections May 20.
   The 11-member ruling council is the executive arm of the
National Salvation Front, which took power in the vacuum after the
December revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   The front and 28 opposition parties clamoring for a share of
power participated in talks which the leading body said were aimed
at giving the opposition a role in the government.
   The National Salvation Front said it is ``to be open for
participation by all parties.'' It also said the method of
expanding it will be ``given the finishing touches'' during
continuing talks with opposition groups.
   The front leaders said the ``mini-parliament'' would be composed
of three members from each party and would have a majority-vote
veto power over the decisions of the 11-member ruling council.
   In the communique, however, the front did not give any time
frame for the establishment of the interim parliament body.
   Also today, testimony continued against four of Ceausescu's top
aides during the fourth day of their trial before a military
tribunal on charges of complicity to commit genocide.
   The four are former Communist Party Secretary Emil Bobu, third
in the Ceausescu hierarchy after the dictator and his wife, former
Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu and former Politburo members
Manea Manesacu and Ion Dinca.
   The charge stems from the shooting of demonstrators in Timisoara
and other Romanian cities, causing the revolution that ousted and
then executed Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, in December.
   The defendants face a maximum penalty of life in prison.

<HEAD>$1.3 Million in Stolen Goods Recovered in Utah Police Sting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURIE SULLIVAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST VALLEY CITY, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The office that appeared to be a
fencing operation for buying stolen goods and drugs was really an
18-month-long police sting that drew 135 suspects, officials say.
   About $1.3 million in stolen goods was purchased for $70,000
during the undercover operation run by several law agencies,
officials said.
   Goods netted included 130 vehicles; more than $20,000 worth of
jewelry; power tools; a pickup truck full of sportswear;
appliances; about 100 firearms _including sawed-off shotguns,
assault rifles and a hand grenade _ and a human eye.
   In all, 135 suspects were sought on state and federal charges,
Tommy Wittman, agent in charge of the Salt Lake office of the
federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said at a news
conference where many of the confiscated items were displayed.
   West Valley City Police Department spokeswoman Marsha Campbell
said today that at least 62 people had been served warrants since
officers began issuing them early Wednesday. Half of the suspects
were already in custody on other charges.
   The sting was run by the West Valley City and Salt Lake City
police departments and the federal ATF bureau, with assistance from
other agencies. It operated out of two phony businesses _
Industrial Motor Repair in South Salt Lake and Damaged Freight
Haulers in West Valley.
   A stolen Christmas tree was fenced during the holiday season,
and undercover officers buying morphine from a nursing student also
bought a human eye that had been taken from the University of Utah
Medical Center.
   The agents bought $16,445 in heroin, morphine, cocaine,
methamphetamine, valium and marijuana and learned the locations of
six methamphetamine laboratories in the area, Wittman said.
   Sgt. Charles Illsley of the Major Felony Unit said 95 percent of
the suspects were trading in stolen goods to obtain money for drugs.
   ``Three had `priors' for homicide. ... The worst one had 11
felony convictions,'' he said.
   U.S. Attorney Dee Benson said the probe's 26 federal indictments
all involved narcotics and firearms charges.
   The sting was the third in the county since 1985. In August
1986, a similar operation resulted in the arrest of 24 people and
the recovery of more than $500,000 in stolen goods. The second
sting ended in January 1988 with the arrests of 50 people and the
recovery of more than $400,000.
   West Valley Assistant Police Chief Terry Keefe said undercover
officers became friendly with many suspects, sometimes were
introduced to their families and in one case helped them move in
the middle of the night. A female officer portraying a receptionist
got a marriage proposal from one suspect.
   Wittman said the suspects were not entrapped.
   ``Enticement yes, probably. But not entrapment,'' Wittman said.
``These people had already stolen the property when they came to
us. We did not provide shopping lists.''

   A federal judge today placed Iran-Contra
figure Albert Hakim on two years' probation and fined him $5,000.
The businessman who controlled the money in the scandal agreed to
hand over to the U.S. government $7.3 million from the secret arms
sales to Iran frozen in Swiss bank accounts.
   U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell imposed probation
following Hakim's Nov. 21 guilty plea to a misdemeanor charge of
helping to supplement Oliver North's government salary by arranging
to pay for a $13,800 security system at North's home.
   ``The American public has had enough of this soap opera,'' Hakim
said after his court appearance.
   Hakim is another in a string of Iran-Contra defendants who have
escaped prison time.
   ``Very substantial funds _ measured in the millions of dollars _
which have been frozen'' in Swiss bank accounts ``have now been
released to the United States by you,'' Gesell announced.
   The amount to be turned over to the government is $7.3 million,
said Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh. She said Hakim will retain $1.7 million,
which he will split with Swiss-based lawyers Willard Zucker and
Philippe Neyroud.
   Gesell also said the Iranian-born Hakim had secured the release
of David Jacobsen, a U.S. hostage held in Lebanon, and is
cooperating with Iran-Contra prosecutors in a new criminal
investigative matter.
   Gesell noted that Jacobsen, the former hostage, had written the
judge on behalf of Hakim. The judge said that while others ``have
taken credit for'' freeing the hostage, it was Hakim's conduct that
actually achieved it.
   At the request of the Justice Department, the Swiss government
froze some $7.8 million held in accounts of the ``Enterprise,'' the
maze of offshore companies and bank accounts Hakim and his business
partner, retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, set up to
handle money in the Iran-Contra affair. The money has accrued some
$1.2 million in interest.
   Gesell placed one of Hakim's companies, Panamanian-based Lake
Resources Inc., on probation and ordered that the corporation be
dissolved.
   Lake Resources had pleaded guilty to a charge of theft of
government property in the diversion of Iran arms sales profits to
the Contras.
   Outside the courthouse, Hakim said, ``I have been abused by two
presidents'' and criticized Iran-Contra prosecutors.
   ``I'm talking about President Reagan and President Walsh,'' he
said, referring to the former president and Walsh, who directed
Hakim's prosecution.
   ``Our judicial system has been used as a tool by the politicians
for their own gain,'' said Hakim. ``On top of this list of the
politicians is President Walsh and his Cabinet known as IC
(independent counsel) and his staff.''
   ``They accused me of being an arms dealer. I am not,'' said the
businessman.
   Hakim's lawyer, Richard Janis said the prosecution of Hakim was
``an abuse. After 22 months of indictment and expenditure of $100
million they brought an indictment that no other prosecutor would
have taken to court.''
   Iran-Contra prosecutors filed a sentencing memo Monday saying
Hakim has agreed to provide them with testimony in ``an anticipated
future case'' being investigated by a grand jury outside
Washington. The prosecutors did not elaborate, but called his
cooperation ``of significant value.''
   Gesell called Hakim's assistance to Iran-Contra prosecutors
``exceptional'' and ``in sharp contrast to any other of the
defendants who have been at one time or another before me in ...
the Iran-Contra ... case.''
   The judge was referring to North, Secord and former National
Security Adviser John Poindexter, who is scheduled to go on trial
Feb. 20.
   ``You are the only one who ... was not an officer or former
officer of the U.S. government,'' said the judge. ``Indeed, you
were brought in ... by the U.S. government.''
   The judge said Hakim's business interests have been hurt and
that ``you have suffered substantially.''
   The question of who owns the proceeds from the Iran-Contra
affair has lingered since the scandal erupted in November 1986.
   In the secret Iran arms sales, the U.S. government was paid the
cost of the weapons it sold to the Iranians. But the ``Enterprise''
charged Iran exorbitant prices for the arms, with the difference
being kept in the accounts controlled by Hakim.
   Several million dollars were diverted to the Contras fighting
the leftist government of Nicaragua. Other money was set aside for
profits for Hakim, Secord and arms dealer Thomas Clines,
congressional investigators found. Some of the money also was
supposed to be funneled to other covert programs, according to
testimony from North, the former White House aide convicted in the
affair.

<HEAD>Baker Offers Soviet Reformers Full Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, bound
for high-level talks next week in Moscow, today offered Soviet
reformers the full support of the Bush administration in revamping
their political and economic system.
   Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the
democratic revolution sweeping eastern Europe could be stalled or
even reversed ``if we fail to support the principles that brought
us this far.''
   Baker, who will hold talks next week in Moscow with Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and possibly with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, outlined U.S. foreign policy objectives to
the committee.
   The principal items on Baker's Moscow agenda are accelerating
arms control agreements, seeking a solution to the war in
Afghanistan between the Soviet-backed Marxist government and
U.S.-armed Moslem Fundamentalist rebels, and human rights.
   ``We seek a more democratic Soviet Union where human rights
gains are made permanent,'' Baker said.
   He told the committee the administration would offer technical
cooperation to assist the Soviet perestroika program of
restructuring the country's sluggish economy.
   ``In short,'' Baker said, ``we seek to probe for points of
mutual advantage with the Soviet Union, turning areas of conflict
into areas of cooperation wherever possible. In this way we will
benefit ourselves as well as the reformers in Moscow.''
   His testimony followed an announcement by President Bush
Wednesday night in his State of the Union address that the United
States is proposing to reduce U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe to
225,000 each with a sub-ceiling of 195,000 in central Europe.
   That could mean bringing about 80,000 American troops home.
   A differing view was voiced by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who
said Gorbachev was a ``colorful and adroit public relations man''
whose concept of reform excludes freedom. Helms said Gorbachev had
delivered MiG fighter jets to Cuba and missiles to Nicaragua and,
at home, had undertaken 15 strategic weapons programs as part of
``a massive military buildup.''
   Baker sounded a note of caution, saying ``the old world of
dogmatic dictatorships is on its way out. But the new world of
secure, prosperous and just democracies is not yet here. It will
not arrive automatically.''
   ``If we fail to support the principles that brought us this far,
we could end up living in a future that resembles the past _ the
past of Cold War and the conflicts that preceded it,'' he said.
   In the text of his prepared statement, Baker criticized ``the
tragic case of China'' as a place where democratic values were
suppressed. However, when he read the statement to the committee,
he skipped a reference to China in speaking of ``governments that
try to shut out democratic values.''
   On specific issues elsewhere in the world, Baker:
   _ Said he aimed in trying to set up Middle East negotiations to
fulfill ``the legitimate political rights of the Palestinian
people.''
   Here, Baker gave no clues what the administration sought to
accomplish for Palestinians or if he will be able to get the
negotiations started.
   _ Said there would be no cut in U.S. aid to Israel and Egypt.
Together, Baker said, they are due to receive $5.1 billion for the
fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. That represents about 61 percent of
the U.S. foreign aid budget.

<TEXT>
   Premier Georgi Atanassov and his Cabinet
resigned today, an official source said, in a development could
lead to creation of a new government including opposition figures
for the first time in more than 40 years.
   Atanassov was a holdover from the era of disgraced leader Todor
Zhivkov and had come under increased pressure to resolve Bulgaria's
labor strife.
   The resignation of Atanassov and his 22-member Cabinet was not
announced publicly, and the source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Also today, a spokesman for a reform-minded alliance in the
Communist Party announced that his faction had given up trying to
change the party from within and would break away to create a
socialist party. The Alternative Socialist Alliance will formally
create the Bulgarian Socialist Party at a special congress in Sofia
on Feb. 11, said spokesman Nikolai Vassilev.
   Atanassov's resignation had been widely expected because of
several personal attacks on him during an emergency Communist Party
conference under way. It was not immediately known when a new
government would be named.
   The president and Communist Party chief, Petar Mladenov, has
held out the possibility of creating an interim government to share
power with opposition groups before elections.
   However, the proposed government has not been made clear.
   The opposition Union of Democratic Forces has said the terms and
power of such an interim Cabinet must be clarified before they
would agree to participate.
   Opposition spokesman Petar Beron reiterated that today, but his
comments were made before the report of the Cabinet's resignation.
   Until a new government is formed, the country will apparently be
run by Mladenov and a rubber-stamp Parliament.
   Atanassov, a member of the Communist Party policy-making
Politburo, became premier in March 1986. He survived the Nov. 10
ouster of Zhivkov, apparently because he sided with the Politburo
colleagues who engineered the end of the authoritarian leader's 35
years in power.
   But Atanassov was not able to come up with an effective solution
for Bulgaria's economic problems or escape the shadow of Zhivkov,
now under arrest on criminal charges.
   Bulgaria has been hit during the last two weeks with
uprecedented labor stoppages by workers demanding better pay.
Demonstrators on Sunday demanded Atanassov's resignation and a
government of ``national accord.''
   Teachers walked out as the congress opened Tuesday. Miners who
struck last week resumed work Wednesday but continued negotiations
with the government.
   Doctors struck for one hour Tuesday, two hours Wednesday, and
announced plans to quit working for three hours today.
   Official media carried a report quoting agricultural workers as
saying they would strike Feb. 5 unless the state paid adequate
prices for their crops.
   Despite Zhivkov's ouster, Bulgaria's Communists have given up
relatively little power, compared with their comrades elsewhere in
Eastern Europe. The party is bolstered by its roots in the nation's
politics and by a relatively weak, although growing, opposition.
   But the emergency congress of the Communist Party, which resumed
today, demonstrated the deepening gulf between the hard-line and
reform camps who favor more drastic action to break with the past.
   ``Even before the congress it was clear to us because this is a
lost congress,'' said Vassilev, a Sofia University philosophy and
anthropology professor.
   ``We knew who the delegates were and how they were elected,'' he
added. ``It was quite clear for us that a radical change to the
left would be impossible.''
   Poland's Communist Party suffered a similar division when the
most radical reformers split from the mainstream at a congress that
concluded Monday.
   Vassilev predicted that within three months, about 150,000 of
the 980,000 Communist Party members in Bulgaria would rally around
the new party.
   ``But the Communist Party will not only lose these people, it
will also lose people who do not want to stay in any party,'' he
said.
   The new party will have a socialist orientation, Vassilev said,
adding, ``We seek our roots in the social practice and achievements
of the socialist movement.''

   A judge refused today to dismiss charges
against a pregnant woman accused of abusing her unborn child by
consuming alcohol in spite of an earlier court order.
   At issue in the case is whether the legal system should protect
fetuses from the actions of their mothers.
   Judge Robert Denhardt's refusal to dismiss the charge against
Diane Pfannenstiel, 29, was at the start of a preliminary hearing
that could last two days.
   The defense had argued that the child abuse statutes under which
Pfannenstiel was charged do not apply to fetuses.
   Albany County Attorney Cal Rerucha alleged in the charge filed
in early January that Pfannenstiel, who is four to five months
pregnant, consumed alcohol ``in an excessive amount which she knows
will cause serious physical injury upon her unborn child.''
   But Mary Beth Galvan, attorney for Pfannenstiel, believes
Wyoming's child abuse laws don't apply to fetuses and that the
charges are unconstitutional.
   ``Whether or not a fetus is defined as a child is a question for
the Legislature to decide, not for us,'' Galvan said in an
interview this week.
   Galvan had asked Denhardt to dismiss the case on grounds of
vagueness.
   But she said she was so intrigued with what prompted Rerucha to
charge Pfannenstiel that she has subpoenaed him to testify about
how he reached his decision.
   According to court records, the charge against Pfannenstiel was
filed two months after another judge ordered her to remain
alcohol-free.
   That judge's unusual intervention followed a previous pregnancy
that produced a baby suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome, a
leading cause of mental retardation and other developmental
problems, according to court records.
   Robert Horowitz, associate director of the American Bar
Association's Center for Children and the Law in Washington, said
he was unaware of any similar cases that have led to convictions
that have withstood appeal.
   Drug use, particularly cocaine, has led to arrests of pregnant
women or new mothers in some states. Crack cocaine use by pregnant
women has led to several arrests in Florida on charges of
delivering cocaine to newborn babies since the first successful
conviction in August. But that case is still on appeal.
   Some of those watching the case believe the woman should not be
prosecuted because of an addiction, if one exists.
   Patricia Schene, director of the American Association for
Protecting Children in Denver, said that rather than prosecuting
Pfannenstiel, Rerucha should try to help her.
   ``She's as much a victim as the child,'' she said.
   Pfannenstiel was charged after going to police to have her
husband charged with battery. While she was being treated at a
hospital, a blood test revealed she had a blood alcohol level of
0.1 percent, Galvan said. That is level considered at which a
person is considered intoxicated under state law.
   Asked if Pfannenstiel is an alcoholic, Galvan replied: ``There
is no diagnosis in the record that I am aware of.''
   Galvan wondered what would happen if Pfannenstiel is convicted
and sentenced to five years in prison _ and five months from now
gives birth to a healthy baby?
   She said Rerucha will be hard-pressed to prove his case.
   ``It requires that an actual injury be shown. Harm has to have
resulted,'' she said.
   Rerucha maintained that prosecutors shouldn't have to wait until
a child is born with defects.
   ``The damage is done by that time,'' he said in an interview.

   A judge refused today to delay a death
penalty hearing for a woman convicted of the murder of her
6-week-old daughter after her attorney said she had lost the will
to live.
   Madison County Circuit Judge Andy Matoesian said he believed
Paula Marie Sims was capable of proceeding.
   ``The defendant wants to be sentenced to death and is therefore
unable to assist in her defense,'' argued Mrs. Sims' attorney,
Donald Groshong. ``She is substantially different since her
conviction.''
   Mrs. Sims, 30, was convicted Tuesday in the death of 6-week-old
Heather Lee Sims.
   Jurors were to hear further arguments today before deciding
whether to impose the death penalty or a lesser sentence. They
deliberated about two hours Wednesday before finding Mrs. Sims
eligible for the death penalty.
   Under Illinois law, prosecutors may seek the death penalty under
certain circumstances, including cases in which the victim is under
the age of 12, the killing is particularly brutal, or when there
are multiple victims.
   Groshong asked today that the sentencing hearing be delayed
until psychiatric evaluations of Mrs. Sims can be made.
   ``She still maintains her innocence, but says, `I don't have any
reason to go on, I don't have any reason to live. Whether I'm
innocent doesn't matter _ they can go ahead and execute me,'''
Groshong said.
   But Matoesian said he has ``no bona fide doubt as to her
sanity'' and denied the request. He also denied a defense request
that a new jury be named for the death penalty hearing.
   Mrs. Sims, of Alton, contends a masked gunman abducted Heather
Lee last year, just as her 13-day-old firstborn daughter, Loralei,
was abducted three years earlier. No murder charges have been filed
in Loralei's death.
   Assistant Madison County State's Attorney Donald Weber argued
Wednesday that the death penalty was warranted in the April 29
suffocation of Heather because the slaying was planned and the
crime was ``cruel, brutal, grossly ruthless and devoid of mercy and
compassion.''
   ``We cannot say the death of this child was premeditated,
prolonged or torturous,'' Groshong told the jury. ``In the pecking
order of evil ... smothering is usually considered more merciful
than other forms of killing.''
   The jury found Mrs. Sims guilty Tuesday of first-degree murder,
obstructing justice and concealing a homicide in Heather's death.
She also faces charges of obstruction of justice and concealment of
a homicide in the death of Loralei.
   Weber said he thought the jury was strongly influenced by
evidence Mrs. Sims and her husband, Robert, only wanted male
babies. Their son, Randy, who turns 2 today, remains in the custody
of Sims, 37, who has not been charged in either case.
   The Simses reported Heather was abducted April 29 from their
home in Alton. Her body was found May 3 in a trash barrel across
the Mississippi River in nearby West Alton, Mo. An autopsy
indicated she had been suffocated and her body subsequently frozen.
   Loralei was reported abducted June 17, 1986, from the Simses'
former home in Brighton. A badly decomposed body believed to be
Loralei's was found a week later 150 yards from the house.

closely inspect their children's report cards after a youngster
strolled into city offices and persuaded a clerk to hand over a
stack of blank report cards.
   School officials say the hoax started when someone identifying
herself as a high school teacher called the city's general
accounting office and said she needed 65 blank report cards. A
teen-age girl then showed up at the office, announcing to an
unsuspecting clerk, ``I'm here to pick up the report cards.''
   The clerk handed over a stack of blank report cards.
   ``We're afraid report card security was breached,'' said school
superintendent Guy DiBiasio. ``We want to be sure that parents
aren't being fooled by a pirated copy.''
   School officials were not sure if the stunt was part of a
student's attempt to deceive her parents at report card time.
   In any event, DiBiasio advised parents that all official report
cards bear the names of Mayor Joseph Santopietro, City Clerk
Patricia Carrah and Comptroller Donald Reilly.
   ``We have reason to belive that is was a little `report
card-gate,''' DiBiasio said.

   President Bush's call for faster troop cuts in
Europe drew praise in Congress and abroad today, but House Speaker
Thomas S. Foley said Democrats want a greater commitment at home to
allow the United States ``to reclaim our place in the world.''
   Democrats are ``in agreement that we ought to reduce our troops
in Europe. I think everyone sees there is a change in need there,''
Foley said today on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   ``The question is, how are we going to fight the new battles of
the new decade?'' Foley said. ``The challenges of the next decade,
into the next century, are much more here at home.''
   ``As Democrats, we're not satisfied with a trend that has seen
this nation drop from first to sixth in standard of living,'' Foley
said Wednesday night in the party's official response to Bush's
first State of the Union message.
   ``I am heartened'' by the proposed troop cut, Senate Majority
Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, said today. He added that
several Democrats had been calling for such reductions for months
only to be rebuffed by the administration.
   On domestic issues, Mitchell said Bush has consistently employed
good-sounding rhetoric in addressing education ``and just as
consistently failed to match those words with deeds. It will be up
to Congress to supply the deeds to match the president's rhetoric
on education.''
   Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman, said
Bush's proposal for deeper troop cuts in Central Europe was a move
in the right direction, but did not go far enough.
   ``It's a good sign that things are changing for the better,''
Gerasimov said in a briefing in Moscow. But, he said, ``you can
note in his speech that he needs American troops in Europe from
here to eternity _ 125,000 or about this figure. This is not a good
sign.''
   In Brussels, Belgium, Manfred Woerner, secretary-general of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, said Bush's plan underscore the
American commitment ``to maintain significant military forces in
Europe as necessary to alliance security.''
   ``These new steps take account of new political developments in
the East while remaininig consistent with the needs of the
alliance's strategy of deterrence,'' Woerner said in a statement.
   ``The allies are on board,'' White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   In his speech Wednesday night, Foley promised that Democrats,
who control both houses of Congress, will work with Bush ``wherever
and whenever we can'' but will fight the president when necessary
to protect ``the people who go to work and pay the taxes.''
   He scoffed at Bush's call for a ``meager'' 2 percent rise in
education spending, and said Democrats will battle the
administration this year on legislation dealing with capital gains
taxes, child care and clean air.
   Sununu this morning criticized Foley's comments on proposed
education spending, calling it ``a perfect example of the quality
of the criticism that's come forward. You had Speaker Foley on
there talking about a 2 percent increase,'' Sununu said,
maintaining that proposed spending for new programs is up 6 percent
to 7 percent.
   ``The time has come for America to help herself, to rebuild, to
re-energize, to reinvigorate our hopes, to gather together our
talents and to reclaim our place in the world,'' Foley said
Wednesday night.
   But Bush's 11th-hour addition of the U.S.-Soviet troop-cut
proposal was widely lauded by lawmakers who had been deriding his
new budget just two days earlier.
   ``Just when you thought you had a Cold War budget _ boom,'' said
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo. ``I'm really delighted. There's
hope.''
   ``Very positive,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the
Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Rep. Les Aspin, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee, said ``the president should be congratulated''
for the plan. ``Trying to negotiate lower limits on forces deployed
in Europe is clearly a good idea,'' said the Wisconsin Democrat.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said troop cuts would lessen tensions and
``pave the way for an eventual peace dividend.''
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said that after hearing the speech
``I felt better than I have in years.''
   ``This was the real George Bush, talking about the real issues
that concern the American people,'' said Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev.
``I hope the people around the president don't try to interfere
with what he's trying to do.''
   Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., said Bush's speech was full of
``bold new initiatives'' on military forces, education and the
environment.
   But many Democrats found plenty to criticize about Bush's
domestic agenda.
   The capital gains cut ``is the clearest sign of the president's
misplaced pririties,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
``Trickle-down economics is not the way to rebuild America's
strength; investing in America does not mean tax cuts for the
wealthy.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said Bush's agenda contains ``no
bold initiatives, just tinkering,'' and little ``to reverse the
drastic trend to leave behind a vast portion of America.''
   On Social Security, ``the president's position is going to be
clearly the only acceptable political position _ saying that
nothing affecting benefits can be considered,'' said House
Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
   There was applause for Bush's statement that ``the last thing we
need to do is mess around with Social Security,'' but lawmakers
wondered about such specifics as the budget deficit.
   ``You're for motherhood and apple pie when you oppose cutting
Social Security benefits,'' said Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va. But on
the budget deficit Bush's ``credibility may take a beating,'' Robb
aid.
   Bush's announcement of six national goals for improving
education was praised, but Rep. Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., said
it wasn't backed up with the ``genuine commitment'' of money.
   Hawkins, chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee,
said education took ``one step forward, two steps back'' in the
Bush message.
   And Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said, ``We aren't going to do all
these things without additional sources of revenue.''

   Gunmen killed three employees of the
Saudi Arabian Embassy today, shooting one in an apartment near the
embassy and the other two in a car they were driving nearby,
officials said.
   Police said all three victims were male Saudi nationals who
worked in the embassy's visa section. They apparently had
diplomatic status.
   One or more gunmen entered the apartment near the embassy
compound in central Bangkok and killed one of the employees, police
sources said.
   At about the same time, gunmen shot and killed the other two
employees as they were driving an embassy car about half a mile
away, near a residence of the Iranian Embassy, said the sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The interior minister, Banharn Sipla-archa, said an undetermined
number of gunmen worked in two teams and coordinated the attacks.
   Police said the diplomat shot in the apartment was a consular
official named named Abdullah A. Al Desri. They identified the
other two victims as Fahad Az Al Bahli, a second secretary at the
embassy, and Ahmed A. Al-Saif, a telex operator.
   Early last year gunmen killed a third secretary of the Saudi
Arabian Embassy near the compound. The victim also processed visa
applications from the tens of thousands of Thais who travel to work
in Saudi Arabia each year.
   The crime went unsolved, but police said some job placement
agents were unhappy about the diplomat's strict application of
regulations when processing visas for Thai workers. Workers going
to the Middle East pay agents a fee for securing jobs and the
necessary paperwork.

   Milton A. Gordon, an early producer of
television features and series, has died of a heart attack. He was
82.
   Gordon died Wednesday at New York Hospital.
   In 1945, Gordon joined Walter E. Heller and Co. in Chicago,
where he devised new ways of raising capital for film production.
   In 1953, he and Edward Small, a Hollywood producer, formed
Television Programs of America to produce and distribute new films
for the market. The company developed ``Lassie,'' an instant smash.
It sold the series for $3 million, but kept distribution rights.
   The firm also produced ``The New Adventures of Charlie Chan,''
``Tugboat Annie'' and ``Private Secretary.''
   Gordon bought Small's share of the firm in 1958 for $2 million,
and sold the company the next year for $13 million to British
interests.
   In 1969, Gordon bought the majority interest in Halle and
Steiglitz, the Wall Street brokerage firm. In 1970 he became
president and changed the firm's direction to corporate finance.
   His wife, Elinor, died in 1974. He is survived by a daughter, a
son, a brother and four grandchildren.

   For the fourth consecutive week, NBC's ``Today
Show'' was second last week to ABC's ``Good Morning America'' in
ratings, with ``CBS This Morning'' still a distant third, estimates
showed Thursday.
   However, the 4.3 average for ABC's show was down slightly, by
one-tenth of a ratings point. The 4.0 average for NBC's show was up
by the same slight margin. CBS' broadcast averaged a 2.6 rating.
   Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes, according to the

   The longest previous winning stretch of `Good Morning America''
over once-dominant ``Today'' occurred in October and November 1987,
when ABC's show won its morning time period for six weeks, an ABC

   An umpire's decision in a cricket match
started a riot that killed one person and injured about 100 as
police fired rifles and rival fans hurled firebombs and stones,
police said Thursday.
   The rioters looted four shops and burned a dozen houses during
the two-hour outburst Wednesday in Madanganj, 10 miles southeast of
Dhaka, police said.
   The riot began after an umpire's decision during a match between
two cricket teams, the Madanganj Welfare Association and the
Farazikanda Eleven, according to the police, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   The police said they did not know what the decision was, but
fans poured away from the cricket grounds and into the town.
   Police opened fire with rifles as the rioters rampaged through
houses and shops. One bicycle rickshaw driver was killed by police
fire, they said.
   Most of the injuries were caused by the rocks and firebombs,
they said, adding that seven police were among the injured.
   Seven people were arrested.

   Five men were arrested after trying to
destroy evidence linking them to an alleged attempt to assassinate
Flight Lt. Jerry Rawlings, the Ghananian leader, the Ministry of
Defense said Thursday.
   The five, including three military officers, had been under
surveillance since the arrest of seven officers in November on
charges of planning to kill Rawlings, the Defense Ministry said in
a statement released to the Ghanianian News Agency.
   One of the seven arrested last year hanged himself in jail,
newspapers reported.
   A summary of evidence against the original seven said Maj.
Courage E.K. Quashigah, once a close friend of Rawlings, organized
the plot. Quarshigah was credited with intervening to block a coup
attempt against Rawlings in 1983.

   The Supreme Court on Thursday ruled against a
lawyer who wanted to keep two Spanish-made sabers as works of art,
a court official said.
   Japanese law bans ownership of swords and handguns, although
some can be kept if registered as valuable artwork. The court ruled
the registration provision applies only to Japanese swords, said
the court official.
   Lawyer Fumihiro Nishioka had argued that two sabers he brought
from Spain in 1981 should be treated the same as Japanese swords,
claiming the weapons, used in the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War, are
valuable as art.
   A lower court had rejected that argument.
   A law adopted after World War II provides for up to 15 years in
prison for illegal possession of swords and firearms.
   But a sword and gun registration law was adopted in 1950 to
protect culturally valuable objects, which must be registered with
the Education Ministry. A ministry official said 2.1 million guns
and swords have been registered for private ownership.
   The swords must be Japanese and made in traditional ways. The
guns must have been produced in Japan before 1867.

   Disaster assistance applications from
Hurricane Hugo victims continue to pour into the Federal Emergency
Management Agency at the rate of 100 a day.
   ``What is so amazing is how long it is taking for the public to
come in for help,'' FEMA spokesman Frank Mosco said. ``Normally
following a hurricane, we are in and out of a site in four weeks _
five weeks tops.
   ``Just Monday, our Sumter office received first applications for
three ... destroyed homes, and they were all uninsured.''
   It has been four months since Hugo slammed into South Carolina,
killing 29 people and causing an estimated $5.9 billion in damage.
The agency has distributed $450 million in relief funds to 61,000
applicants.
   Mosco attributes the delay in filing for aid to the widespread
destruction in rural areas, illiteracy and victims' unfounded fears
that their social service benefits would be cut if they received
disaster relief.
   Despite the continued requests for aid, FEMA is scheduled to
close its two field offices in Sumter and Charleston within a week.
It also will stop taking applications over its telephone hot line
in a month, but the hot line will remain in operation to answer
questions, Mosco said.
   Mosco said 13,000 aid requests are pending and will take a month
more to process.

<TEXT>
   A Hungarian pastor who recently
risked his life on a mission to Romania says the work he's doing
during a brief stay in the United States is even more important.
   The Rev. Bertalan Tamas arrived Jan. 6 for a five-week visit
sponsored by the Memorial Presbyterian Church of Grosse Pointe, a
Detroit suburb. He is a pastor of the Reformed Church of Hungary
and an Executive Committee member of the World Alliance of Reformed
Churches.
   Tamas, in an interview Monday, said his message to Americans is
this: Although the dictators in Eastern Europe may be gone, the
struggle to build democracy in the East bloc is just beginning.
   ``Americans can sometimes forget. I must use this chance to
describe what happened in Eastern Europe in the past, so it won't
happen again,'' he said, referring to the more than 40 years of
one-party rule that devastated the economies of Hungary, Poland,
East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Romania.
   The church _ whether Roman Catholic, Reformed or Orthodox _ is
one of few stable institutions remaining in the East bloc after the
demise of the region's Communist parties, Tamas said. Thus the
church will play a pivotal role in the transition from
totalitarianism to democracy.
   He cited the Roman Catholic church in Poland, which was a major
force along with the Solidarity trade union movement in ending
Communist rule in that country.
   Another responsibility the church faces is that people expect it
to provide material assistance as well as spiritual guidance, said
Tamas, 49, who learned English in Great Britain.
   ``We need help from our friends in the United States,'' he said.
``Churches in Hungary, for example, are once again being allowed to
run schools and hospitals, but they cannot do it properly because
they no longer have the means to do so.''
   In late December, the Synod, or governing body of the Hungarian
Reformed Church, dispatched Tamas to Romania, which then was in the
early stages of a violent revolution that ousted dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   Tamas was seeking information about the Rev. Lazlo Tokes, an
ethnic Hungarian Reformed pastor whose arrest in the western city
of Timisora was believed to have sparked the Romanian revolt.
Rumors that Tokes had been executed proved false, and Tamas found
him alive and well.
   Tamas already had been threatened with retribution by the
Ceausescu regime for his role in helping 40,000 Romanian refugees
settle in Hungary.
   ``Because we knew the situation was horrible in Romania, we took
the risk,'' Tamas said. ``I also felt I had to express solidarity
with the Rev. Tokes.''
   Tamas plans to travel to New York, Louisville, Ky., Princeton,
N.J., and Decatur, Ga., before returning to Hungary on Feb. 12.

<HEAD>Pope Says Eastern European Events Should Not Overshadow Africa</HEAD>

<DATELINE>N'DJAMENA, Chad (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governments must not let the dramatic
events in Eastern Europe dim their concern for Africa and other
poor regions of the world, Pope John Paul II said Thursday.
   ``There should be no barrier to solidarity among nations,'' he
told diplomats after an eight-day tour of the Sahel region. ``The
monumental changes in Eastern Europe should not turn attention away
from the Third World, and the African continent in particular.''
   That was a recurring theme on his trip to five countries of the
impoverished zone just south of the Sahara Desert.
   John Paul said in Guinea-Bissau that grinding poverty
compromises freedom in Africa.
   Of an audience in Burkina Faso, the pope asked: ``How would
history judge a generation that, having all the means to feed the
Earth's population, refused to do so in fratricidal indifference?''
   He spoke not only to the consciences of rich nations, but also
of the need for cooperation within Africa.
   ``When it comes to movement of people and goods, of investment
in training and research and rational planning of agriculture and
industry, understanding among men can no longer be thwarted by
borders that didn't even exist in the time of their ancestors,''
John Paul declared in N'Djamena, capital of Chad.
   In a thinly veiled reference to the autocratic behavior of some
African leaders, John Paul said those in power should be humble
enough to acknowledge their own errors and the abuse and injustice
that often result.
   ``It is more important to work for peace and the well-being of
all people than to bolster personal prestige,'' he said.
   John Paul urged urged African organizations to coordinate their
efforts for the good of all member nations.
   ``The preparation together of concrete projects will enable them
to form a common front in the bargaining'' with donor and lender
nations and institutions, he said.
   Sustained development in Africa requires peace, he said,
alluding once again to the role of political leaders in the
often-fratricidal conflicts within nations.
   ``I have in mind Ethiopia, Sudan, people who are the subject of
racial discrimination in their own lands and others who suffer from
endemic ethnic rivalries that sometimes lead to violent
confrontations,'' the pope said.
   In Chad, John Paul returned again and again to the theme of
reconciliation in the nation of 5.5 million, where more than a
decade of civil conflict destroyed the economy and produced a young
generation deprived of regular education.
   Meeting with Moslem leaders at a dusty racetrack under a blazing
midday sun, he said: ``After the trials of the past, Chadians must
now concentrate on their own development.''
   The pope put in a word for human rights, which often is at the
bottom of a poor nation's priority list.
   ``It is well to remember that development is measured not only
in economic terms, but in respect for the person in his whole human
condition,'' he said.
   John Paul's sixth pilgrimage to Africa also included stops in
Cape Verde and Mali.

<HEAD>Will De Klerk Speech Signal End of Apartheid?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa, Bjt</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk is to
outline his plans for reform Friday in a speech that many South
Africans hope will finally signal the end of apartheid and set
their country on the road to peace.
   Expectation has ballooned around the world that de Klerk's
speech will at least announce the release of Nelson Mandela, South
Africa's most famous black leader, clearing the way for
negotiations on solving the nation's problems.
   De Klerk, who already has dented the edifice of apartheid, has
pledged to create a ``new dispensation'' in South Africa. Whites
and blacks must solve their differences peacefully, and avoid what
he says could be a race war that would last for 80 years.
   But political observers are warning that de Klerk's speech in
Cape Town at the start of Parliament on Friday won't be the end of
white rule. There are no signs de Klerk intends to surrender power
or accept the democracy that is the goal of all groups fighting
apartheid.
   White rule in South Africa is not going to collapse like the
Berlin Wall and the Communist regimes of Eastern Europe, observers
say; the quest for a solution to South Africa's problems is more
likely to resemble the tortured search for peace in the Middle East
and Northern Ireland.
   The government is in full control of the country, unrest is
minimal and the African National Congress, the main black
opposition group, admits its military campaign against white rule
has been largely ineffective.
   While de Klerk does want to ease tensions, some critics say the
president lacks a definite plan and is feeling his way, playing for
time with moderate reforms to blunt domestic and international
opposition and postpone any major confrontation.
   ``It has not been shown that Mr. de Klerk has either the vision
or the courage to make this moment (on Friday) a moment for
historic importance,'' said Rev. Allan Boesak, an anti-apartheid
leader.
   The government rejects any suggestion of black majority rule and
says the interests of the white minority must be ensured. De Klerk
has given no sign of what he wants for the future beyond stressing
that whites must have veto power in any future state.
   Black leaders say de Klerk must meet a number of basic
expectations to clear the way for talks with the ANC, including
lifting the state of emergency used to suppress dissent; release
Mandela; legalize the ANC and other outlawed opposition groups and
allow exiled black leaders to return.
   Critics say that de Klerk as leader of South Africa's Afrikaners
cannot surrender white minority rule and accept black majority
rule. The Afrikaners, whites of Dutch descent, have been ingrained
with a sense of racial superiority for 350 years that makes it
impossible for them to share power with non-whites, they say.
   Helen Suzman, who opposed the National Party throughout her 36
years in Parliament, said de Klerk was elected by the Afrikaners
and his mandate is to protect the whites' interests above all other
considerations.
   ``He would not interpret his mandate for reform as a mandate to
jeopardize the political position of the white minority or to
threaten its survival,'' she said in a recent lecture.
   Ms. Suzman said she believes de Klerk will end the worst aspects
of the apartheid laws that deprive blacks of rights and ``excise
much of the overt brutality inherent in the apartheid system.''
   De Klerk, who took office in August, has freed several elderly
black political prisoners and eased restrictions on anti-government
protests after years of repression. He also has called for repeal
of the law that allows segregation of municipal facilities.
   But the government has said it will not desegregate schools,
hospitals and other public facilities and there are few signs that
many white South Africans are ready to share power or amenities
with non-whites.
   Nontheless, the government apparently hopes a moderate stance
would ease political tension and encourage some black groups to
take a softer line that could lead to a compromise in which white
interests will be safeguarded.
   The government also is eager to end or weaken the economic
boycotts imposed by many Western nations to protest apartheid. The
boycotts, along with domestic economic problems, have sent the
economy into a tailspin and created hard times for many whites.
   De Klerk hopes to ease the economic crunch by offering reforms
to ease international sanctions and restore confidence in the
economy by attracting new foreign investment.

   President Bush's exacting education goals for
America's schools came under fire today from educators and
Democrats in Congress demanding to know where the money would come
from to make U.S. children the world's best in math and science.
   ``You can't become the education president ... by proposing a
meager 2 percent increase in the education budget,'' said House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley after Bush unveiled his goals in the State
of the Union Address Wednesday night.
   Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, said, ``There is a yawning gap between the rhetoric of
President Bush's education speeches and the funding levels he
offers in his budget.''
   But Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos, in a spirited defense
of Bush's approach, said adding ``another billion and another
billion ... is not going to solve the education deficit.''
   ``It's not a matter of dollars,'' Cavazos said at a White House
briefing.
   Nevertheless, he said his department's proposed $24.6 billion
budget for fiscal 1991 ``is the largest education budget that this
nation has had,'' and includes ``a very healthy 6.2 percent
increase in discretionary programs.''
   Asked why the overall growth was less than the 3 percent that
the whole federal budget rose, Cavazos said his department was
paying lower interest rates on student loans.
   ``The way that you really become the education president ... is
to change the educational system so it's a positive system, it's an
effective system,'' said Cavazos, who said real spending on the
schools surged 26 percent after inflation in the 1980s.
   Bush, in his address, unveiled six goals hammered out in concert
with the nation's governors. They include slashing the dropout rate
and making U.S. children the best in the world in math and science
by the turn of the century.
   ``Real improvement in our schools is not simply a matter of
spending more. It is a matter of asking more _ expecting more _ of
our schools, our teachers, of our kids, and our parents and
ourselves,'' Bush said.
   Some education leaders and Democrats were not impressed.
   Richard Miller, executive director of the American Association
of School Administrators, said he was ``encouraged'' by the first
draft of the goals, but ``we want to get beyond rhetoric. ... His
budget proposal for education is at odds with the goals.''
   ``Nobody could be against education or providing a home for the
homeless. But there was nothing there except generalities,'' Rep.
Robert Matsui, D-Calif., said after Bush's speech.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said, ``American parents and
students need to have explained to them: how is a 2 percent
increase for the Pentagon a major cut while a 2 percent increase in
education is a major increase?''
   But Sen. John Warner, R-Va., praised the president's math and
science goals, saying they could give the nation a ``technological
edge and an economic edge to compete worldwide.''
   Here are what Bush called ``America's education goals:''
   1. ``By the year 2000, every child must start school ready to
learn.''
   2. ``The United States must increase the high school graduation
rate to no less than 90 percent.''
   3. ``In critical subjects _ at the 4th, 8th and 12th grades _ we
must assess our students' performance.''
   4. ``By the year 2000, U.S. students must be first in the world
in math and science achievement.''
   5. ``Every American adult must be a literate worker and
citizen.''
   6. ``Every school must offer the kind of disciplined environment
that makes it possible for our kids to learn _ and every school in
America must be drug-free.''
   He unveiled them four months after agreeing with the governors
at an education summit in Charlottesville, Va., to draft the first
performance goals for the nation's schools.
   He saluted four of the governors who spearheaded the joint
effort and who were on hand to watch the speech from the House
gallery _ Terry Branstad of Iowa, Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Carroll
Campbell of South Carolina and Booth Gardner of Washington.
   Cavazos has said American pupils' achievement levels are
intolerably low.
   He and other experts cite studies showing:
   _South Korean 13-year-olds finished first and Americans last in
a math test given to pupils in six countries last year.
   _Fewer than 1 percent of U.S. students take physics and
chemistry, while up to 25 percent of 18-year-olds in Canada and
Norway take the two subjects for two years each.
   Nearly 30 percent of American teen-gers now drop out of high
school, although some return to get their diploma or equivalency
degree. Minnesota traditionally has been the only state with a 90
percent graduation rate.

<HEAD>Exponent of Roman School of Painting Dies at 82</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alberto Ziveri, a leading exponent of the Roman
school of painting, died Thursday after suffering a stroke. He was
82.
   As an apprentice painter, Ziveri tried his hand at impressionism
but later turned to realism together with others in the Roman art
world that flourished between 1930 and 1945.
   He spiced his realist works with a touch of satire and was known
for his use of deep reds and greens and other ``hot colors.''
   The late Italian artist Renato Guttuso had once written Ziveri
to praise the ``rigor and poetry'' of his works and described his
paintings as ``heavenly.''
   Last year, Ziveri was awarded the Viareggio Prize in recognition
of his life's work.

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal Jozef Glemp, the leader of
Poland's powerful Roman Catholic church, remained hospitalized in
serious condition Thursday, and a newspaper said he had suffered
cardiac shock after massive bleeding brought on by a perforated
ulcer.
   The cardiac shock caused a collapse of blood circulation that
cardiologists had to struggle to get under control Wednesday, said
the newspaper Zycie Warszawy, citing ``unofficial sources.''
   Glemp, 61, remained in serious condition, according to a
spokesman at the primate's household.
   Glemp underwent one operation Tuesday and a second early
Wednesday.
   He was taken to a Warsaw hospital Tuesday after complaining of
feeling faint. During surgery, it was discovered he had suffered a
massive hemorrhage of the digestive system.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski visited Glemp in the hospital
Tuesday night.
   Glemp, primate since 1981 and a cardinal since 1983, is
spiritual leader to the more than 90 percent of Poland's 38 million
people who regard themselves as Roman Catholic.

<HEAD>Administration Fails to Get Aoun's Man Out of Lebanese Embassy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration stepped up its verbal
attack on Lebanese Gen. Michel Aoun on Thursday, demanding he
relinquish his remaining hold on power in Lebanon and appealing to
the Supreme Court to evict his envoy in Washington.
   However, Justice William J. Brennan rejected an emergency
request in which government lawyers said Ambassador Abdallah
Bouhabib's continued occupation of Lebanon's Embassy ``is causing
increasingly serious adverse consequences for the nation's foreign
relations.''
   The State Department is seeking Bouhabib's eviction at the
request of Lebanon's new government led by President Elias Hrawi,
who was elected in November with the backing of the 22-nation Arab
League. The United States recognized the Hrawi government last
November and has been conducting its business with a
Hrawi-appointed ambassador rather than with Bouhabib.
   Aoun, who controls Lebanon's Christian sector with about 1
million residents, refuses to recognize the Hrawi government and
continues to hold out with 20,000 troops at the presidential palace
in Beirut.
   Over the past three days, his forces have been engaged in fierce
battles with a small, rival Christian militia for control of the
sector. Dozens have been killed and wounded.
   In Beirut, Aoun blamed the United States for the fighting.
``America has engineered this collision, but we shall surmount it
soon,'' he said in a statement on his television station. He did
not elaborate.
   As for the legal struggle over the embassy in Washington, Aoun
and Bouhabib last week obtained a temporary restraining order from
U.S. District Judge Harold H. Greene blocking the eviction.
   A federal appeals court Tuesday refused to set aside Greene's
order, and on Thursday Brennan also refused.
   Judge Greene is expected to make his final ruling in the dispute
this week.
   In the emergency request denied by Brennan, Bush administration
lawyers said Greene's restraining order ``is utterly without legal
support and intrudes into the core powers of the president to
receive ambassadors, recognize foreign governments and conduct
foreign relations.''
   Noting that the Hrawi government has asked that Bouhabib be
removed, the request submitted to Brennan said, ``The United States
considers itself obligated to render that assistance immediately.''
   In a strong statement regarding the fighting in Lebanon, the
State Department called on Aoun to step aside immediately.
   ``This latest outburst must be laid at the seat of Gen. Aoun,''
the statement said. ``It follows his earlier outrageous decision to
cut the water to West Beirut and to clamp down on the press.''
   ``Gen. Aoun must realize that his bellicose behavior does not
advance the interests of the Christians or any other community but
only benefits those who want to see Lebanon continue in anarchy and
turmoil,'' the State Department said. ``We reiterate our call for
Gen. Aoun to step aside and to do it now.''

   Rosa Parks, whose refusal to move to the back
of the bus 35 years ago was a key moment in the civil rights
struggle, was honored Thursday by House Democratic leaders, who
said she had changed the nation.
   ``Rosa, let me thank you personally for sitting down so long ago
so I could stand here today,'' said Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., the
House Democratic whip, who credited her with triggering changes
that have allowed blacks such as himself to attain high office.
   Mrs. Parks' 77th birthday on Sunday will be marked by a
black-tie national tribute at the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington.
   In anticipation of that event, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and
other House Democrats appeared with Mrs. Parks at a news conference.
   ``Sometimes it takes one person to say no, and a whole series of
events follow,'' said Foley.
   ``There are few people that can say they changed the nation.
Rosa Parks changed the nation,'' Foley said.
   Mrs. Parks' refusal to surrender her seat to a white passenger
on a Montgomery, Ala., city bus on Dec. 1, 1955, led to a city-wide
bus boycott that last 381 days.
   The boycott triggered other protests and propelled Martin Luther
King Jr., a preacher who was a spokesman and leader of the boycott,
to national attention and to the leadership of the civil rights
movement.
   Since 1965, Mrs. Parks has lived in Detroit and worked in the
office of Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich.. For the last three years she
has run the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development,
whose aim is to help young people.
   ``I'm very, very grateful to be here and happy to be able to
stand before you and say how great it is I am being honored,'' Mrs.
Parks said in her brief remarks at the news conference. ``It is an
extension of the dream that I have to help motivate and train and
encourage youth to reach their highest potential in life.''

<HEAD>Couple Suspected in String Of Robberies Arrested In Connecticut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A middle-aged couple suspected of carrying
out more than two dozen holdups throughout New England were
arrested today after a robbery at a shoe store in which a clerk was
stabbed, police said.
   Edward M. Aranjo, 46, and Ellen M. Marks, 50, were stopped in
Milford about 11:15 a.m. after a description of their vehicle was
broadcast by police in neighboring Orange, where the robbery
occurred, said Officer Edward Kelly, a Milford police spokesman.
   Kelly said Aranjo had blood on him when he was arrested, and
that a blood-stained knife was also found in the couple's car.
   The couple, who had been dubbed the ``Bonnie and Clyde'' robbers
though far older than the notorious Depression-era robbers, did not
offer any resistance when they were stopped, Kelly said.
   The stabbing victim, identified as an owner of the shoe store in
Orange, suffered lacerations to both hands and was taken to
Yale-New Haven Hospital for treatment. The victim's identity was
not immediately released.
   Orange police said the stabbing took place during a struggle
after the male robber held a knife to the clerk's throat.
   The couple were being held early this afternoon in the Milford
lockup while charges were being drawn up, Kelly said.
   Police in Old Saybrook, a shoreline community about 40 miles
east of here, had sought warrants Wednesday for the arrest of the
couple in connection with an armed robbery two weeks ago of a gift
shop.
   Aranjo and Marks are suspected of at least 28 armed robberies
since Dec. 26 in Connecticut, New York, Rhode Island, Massachusetts
and New Hampshire, police said.
   The robbery in Orange was believed to be the third time they
struck in Connecticut since Jan. 8.
   Nearly all of the robberies took place at small towns at small
stores where only one clerk was working. In most cases, the male
robber brandished a knife and tied up the clerk, then grabbed the
money while the woman started up the getaway car.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney predicted today
that the Soviets will likely withdraw from Eastern Europe by the
middle of the decade, but warned against any drastic changes in
U.S. strategy.
   ``I do believe caution is still in order until we have these
agreements signed, sealed and delivered,'' Cheney told a
congressional panel in his first appearance since President Bush's
surprise announcement of deeper cuts in the levels of U.S. and
Soviet combat troops in Central Europe.
   The president's proposal for the ongoing conventional arms
control talks in Vienna calls for 195,000 troops for each
superpower _ a reaction to the tumultuous changes in Eastern Europe
and the apparently diminishing Soviet threat.
   ``The likelihood of a Warsaw Pact attack into NATO these days is
fairly remote,'' Cheney told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The defense secretary said the United States can begin to plan
for ``the possibility that the Soviets will be out of Eastern
Europe or virtually out of Eastern Europe five years hence, that
the governments of Eastern Europe will be democratically-elected,
non-Communist regimes.''
   ``I think that's a very real possibility,'' Cheney said.
   At the White House, Chief of Staff John Sununu rejected any
suggestion that the troop-cut plan was intended to prop up a
politically weakened Gorbachev as he faces a critical meeting next
week of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   ``If the cutting of troops would have been an advantage for Mr.
Gorbachev, then Mr. Gorbachev would probably have announced them
earlier himself, thereby getting both the advantage, the pressuring
of the United States to do it and whatever international political
benefits that come in that direction,'' Sununu said. ``So that was
not part of the consideration.''
   Although Bush is calling for a drastic troop reduction,
uncertainty still exists over the final number of U.S. troops and
equipment that will remain in Europe, the defense secretary said.
   ``We have not finalized the work within the NATO alliance about
how we will allocate the cuts within the alliance,'' he said.
``There are significant questions as yet unanswered about what NATO
strategy will be like in a post (conventional forces agreement)
environment.''
   The troop reduction plan drew praise from the ranking members of
the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   ``I applaud the president for his new proposal,'' said Sen. Sam
Nunn, D-Ga., the panel's chairman. ``It is much more relevant to
the changes in Eastern Europe and the budget at home.''
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the committee's ranking
Republican, called Bush's initiative ``a bold, new move.''
   Cheney reiterated his warning against the United States
abandoning its plans to modernize its strategic forces, noting that
the Soviet Union is continuing to upgrade its class of high-tech
weapons.
   The defense secretary still faces complaints from lawmakers over
his $292.1 billion military budget.
   Cries of political foul play surround the proposed list of base
closures and realignments, with many lawmakers arguing that
significant reductions in big-ticket strategic weapons are the
proper response to a lessening Soviet threat.
   The budget calls for five B-2 stealth bombers at a cost of $5.5
billion and an increase of nearly $1 billion in spending on the
Strategic Defense Initiative to $4.5 billion.
   Those totals have raised red flags on Capitol Hill, where the
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., predicted that it was highly unlikely that the
administration would get what it is seeking.
   The budget would continue financing of two land-based nuclear
missiles, with $2.8 billion to fund rail-basing for the
multiple-warhead MX missile and $202 million for the truck-based
Midgetman missile.
   The plan also calls for canceling some 20 small weapons systems,
such as the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey and the Army's M-1 tank, in
an attempt to save $2.9 billion.

<DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Bill Stirling wants to buy foxes from
a Wyoming fox ranch in order to set the animals free.
   But the fur farm's owner calls the scheme crazy.
   ``They wouldn't last three days in the wild. These foxes were
born and raised in a cage for generations. They couldn't find
food,'' said Jack Hendrickson, owner of Arrow Fur Ranch outside
Buffalo, Wyo.
   Stirling has sponsored a city ballot question to ban the
commercial sale of wild-animal furs in Aspen. Residents vote on the
measure Feb. 13.
   Stirling's crusade, which has fueled a recall campaign against
him, drew the attention last month of Dexter Butterfield, who lives
next door to the fur ranch in Wyoming.
   Stirling and his wife, Katharine Thalberg, founder of the Aspen
Society for Animal Rights, visited Wyoming at the invitation of
Butterfield, who has complained about foul odors and screams and
yelps from the ranch.
   ``The reality of that fox farm was useful in educating our
electorate here about the realities of life for a wild animal on a
fur ranch,'' Stirling said this week. ``They're in these miserable
little cages all their lives.
   ``Then we thought, `What about freeing the ... animals?'''
   Since then, Stirling has sent offers to Hendrickson, seeking to
buy out his inventory of 68 silver foxes at $50 to $100 per animal.
Thalberg's group aims to help defray the cost by selling $100 ``fox
futures.''
   A Rocky Mountain Humane Society veterinarian is working with
wildlife biologists on a release plan, Stirling said.
   ``I'd talk to him for $100 (per animal), but I don't expect to
hear from him again,'' said Hendrickson. ``And he wants me to agree
not to raise (more foxes) for a year ... but I wouldn't even deal
with that.''

   The Walt Disney Co., which fought Mickey
Mouse's appearance on a day-care wall and Snow White's performance
at the Academy Awards, wants an anti-pornography group to quit
quoting its founder.
   ``Our greatest natural resource is the minds of our children,''
Walt Disney once said.
   The Greater Orlando Coalition Against Pornography used that
quotation in a pamphlet outlining the group's purpose. Last week,
the group received a letter from Anne Nielsen, a Disney attorney,
asking them to delete any reference to Disney from the brochure.
   She said the quotation ``conveys to the public the impression
that there is an association or connection with the Walt Disney
Co.''
   But the coalition's executive director, Don Pinkston, says it's
all a misunderstanding and he hopes to settle the issue with Disney.
   The group's lawyer, Darryl Bloodworth, defended the use of the
quote.
   ``Mr. Disney was a public figure, and that simply was a quote of
a public figure, much as the newspaper quotes public figures all
the time,'' he said.
   But Disney spokesman Charles Ridgway disagreed, saying the group
was not a newspaper and the company owns the rights to the name of
Walt Disney.
   In recent years, Disney has threatened legal action when it
believed its property rights over Disney names and charaters were
being violated.
   Last year, a south Florida day-care center had to remove wall
paintings of Disney characters, the Academy Awards producers were
rebuked for using the Snow White character without permission and a
Kissimmee gift shop using the name ``Mickie's'' was challenged.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communist premier today urged
talks with West Germany toward an eventual ``united fatherland''
that would be independent of military blocs and governed by a joint
parliament in Berlin.
   The two Germanys must work out a common approach to
reunification to calm the unease of their European neighbors,
Premier Hans Modrow said at a news conference in which he unveiled
his plan for unification.
   The Communists, beset by a crumbling economy and a damaging
Westward exodus of thousands of East Germans, until recently had
opposed talk of reunification.
   This week for the first time they endorsed the concept, and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev softened his view, calling a
united Germany inevitable.
   Modrow said he could give no time frame for reunification
because it depends on the pace of European unity and the attitudes
of Germans in both states.
   He said he would push for a slower tempo in inter-German
relations to avoid instability, and called for an interim
confederation with West Germany that could work out a measured and
logical program for ``growing together.''
   ``Germany should once again become a united fatherland of all
citizens of the German nation,'' Modrow said. ``Responsibility,
caution and understanding are demanded in order to ensure that
there is never any danger to the lives and well-being of
neighbors.''
   Modrow called for negotiations with Bonn soon to devise a joint
plan on reunification, but made clear that he had not previously
discussed his views with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Reacting to Modrow's proposal, Kohl said he was ready to discuss
reunification steps immediately after a new government takes over
in East Germany following March elections, but he rejected the idea
of military neutrality.
   ``Such a proposal contradicts the logic of the pan-European
process of unification,'' Kohl said at a news conference in Bonn.
He said a single German state in the heart of Europe could not
afford to be isolated.
   American and West European allies have indicated that they would
accept reunification as long as Germany stays within the NATO
alliance.
   But East Germany is host to about two-thirds of the Soviet
Union's 600,000 troops in Central Europe, making the state shaken
by democratic upheaval the Kremlin's most crucial defense partner
in the seven-nation Warsaw Pact.
   The Kremlin has said German reunification must occur within the
European framework, meaning that divisions would have to be erased
between the two rival military blocs, NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   Modrow said elections in both Germanys would be necessary to
seat a joint parliament in Berlin. And he indicated that in his
view ``joint executive bodies ``could also function in certain
areas.''
   Modrow said both states must ``step by step'' proceed toward
neutrality.
   His plan appeared to reject a unity plan offered Wednesday by
West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, who envisioned
West Germany remaining loyal to NATO alliance while making what is
currently East Germany neutral.
   Reflecting Bonn's optimism about eventual reunification,
Genscher today praised as ``an important step forward'' President
Bush's proposal for sharp reductions in U.S. and Soviet forces in
Central Europe.
   Bush's proposal Wednesday night in his first State of the Union
address to limit each superpower to 195,000 troops in the region
also was welcomed by West Germany's defense minister, Gerhard
Stoltenberg.
   He called it ``a balanced combination of disarmament policy and
unequivocal recognition of the West's defense readiness and
alliance solidarity.''
   In a speech to the Evangelical Institute in Tutzing, near
Munich, Genscher outlined what he sees as a security guarantee for
Moscow and a compromise that could appease Washington as well.
   Genscher suggested that the territory now constituting West
Germany could remain in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
while the area east of the Elbe River, East Germany, would not host
any military facilities.
   Gorbachev acknowledged in talks with Modrow on Tuesday that a
single Germany likely is inevitable, but cautioned that a headlong
plunge toward reunification could destabilize Europe.
   
   Gorbachev's top adviser on German affairs told West German
television late Wednesday that the Soviet Union considers
neutrality the best path to a united Germany.
   Nikolai Portugalov told the WDR network that weapons reductions
already under way in both German states are tantamount to an
acceptance of military neutrality.
   Bush's troops reduction proposal would most directly affect West
Germany, as about 250,000 of the United States' 305,000
European-based troops are deployed in West Germany.
   Support for union with prosperous West Germany has surged among
East Germans in recent weeks as the country's political and
economic crisis have deepened. Weekly pro-democracy rallies in
Leipzig and other major cities have taken on a clear
pro-reunification atmosphere recently.

   Actress-singer Bette Midler won't let her
3-year-old daughter, Sophie, watch television, eat junk food or
stay up late because she doesn't want her to ``be jaded at 8.''
   ``I've got to say we're on the pompous side,'' she said of

   ``At first, I thought, `Well, gee, everyone's going to think I'm

her to have a foundation in things the world considers good and
artful,'' she said.
   Midler said she nixed television because the programming is too

   ``We just do stuff together. We do a lot of construction paper,
a lot of drawing, a lot of chatting, a lot of dancing around and
making up stories and games and stuff,'' she said.

   ``I've had enough of these trendy clothes. These are years when

<HEAD>Communist Premier Calls For Reunification Talks</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's Communist premier on Thursday
appealed for negotiations with West Germany to forge a ``united
fatherland'' that eventually would be neutral and governed from
Berlin.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl welcomed the call to discuss
reunification, but rejected the call for military neutrality.
   ``Such a proposal contradicts the logic of the pan-European
process of unification,'' Kohl said. He added that a single German
state in the heart of Europe could not afford to be isolated.
   East German Premier Hans Modrow called for ``a reasonable time
horizon'' for reunification to be mutually determined, apparently
hoping to gain control over the galloping pace of events drawing
the two Germanys together.
   His announcement marked a turnaround in the Communist-dominated
government's position on the German question. The East Berlin
leadership had previously resisted reunification efforts as
premature and destabilizing.
   But mounting economic woes and an accelerating exodus of
thousands of skilled workers to the West are forcing the nation's
interim leaders to address public pressure for a merger with
prosperous West Germany.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev also has softened his view
on the issue; earlier this week he said reunification was
inevitable.
   At a news conference to announce his plan, Modrow rejected
suggestions that he was angling to win votes for the Communist
Party, which is threatened by opposition groups in East Germany's
first free elections set for March 18.
   Kohl flew to West Berlin to meet with East German opposition
leaders to discuss possible campaign assistance for their challenge
of the Communists. He said he would discuss reunification with the
new government elected in March.
   Modrow cautioned that German reunification must be carried out
carefully to avoid stirring up fears among neighboring nations that
a powerful German state would rise and threaten them.
   ``Nothing can occur that runs counter to the process of
overcoming the division of Europe or that would create new
dangers,'' he said.
   He titled his proposal ``For Germany, a United Fatherland,'' a
slogan touted repeatedly by reunification advocates at weekly
rallies in Leipzig and other major cities.
   ``Germany should once again become a united fatherland of all
citizens of the German nation,'' he said. ``Responsibility, caution
and understanding are demanded in order to ensure that there is
never any danger to the lives and well-being of neighbors.''
   Modrow's plan calls for an initial ``treaty community'' to draw
the two German states closer together, then a confederation status
that would create some joint executive and parliamentary committees.
   The final step, to be endorsed in a national referendum, would
seat a joint parliament and government in Berlin and draft a joint
constitution.
   Modrow did not make say what would happen to Bonn, the West
German capital that has endured a provisional status through 40
years of hope for an eventual return to Berlin.
   Modrow made clear that the unified German state he envisions
must be free of ties to both military blocs.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher on Wednesday
proposed a compromise that he suggested would provide a security
guarantee for the Kremlin, which depends heavily on East Germany as
its front line against the West's NATO alliance.
   Genscher proposed that the territory now constituting West
Germany remain loyal to NATO, while the area east of the Elbe
River, East Germany, be militarily neutral.
   U.S. ambassador to West Germany, Vernon Walters, said loyalty to
NATO was one of the conditions for German reunification, but he
left unclear whether it would also include the military integration
into the alliance of what is now East Germany. Walters made the
remarks in a speech in Stuttgart.
   About two-thirds of the 565,000 Soviet troops deployed in
Eastern Europe are based in East Germany.
   Likewise, West Germany is host to most of the 305,000 U.S.
troops stationed in central Europe to defend against a possible
attack by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   President Bush's proposal Wednesday for deep cuts in those
forces _ down to 195,000 for each superpower _ drew praise in both
Germanys.
   Kohl heralded the White House initiative as ``the right signal
at the right time,'' and said he considered the call for sharp
reductions ``a pathmark to a new European security structure.''
   East Germany also welcomed the proposal and expects it to help
lead to an agreement at Vienna arms talks to reduce conventional
forces in Europe, government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer said.

   Attorneys for fired Exxon skipper
Joseph Hazelwood are seeking transcripts of conversations after his
tanker ran aground and other documents that the Coast Guard doesn't
want to release.
   The attorneys want records of alcohol tests administered to
Hazelwood and members of the tanker crew the day of the crash;
background information about crew members and two Coast Guard
officials; records of ice conditions and communications between
Hazelwood and the Coast Guard.
   Anchorage Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone heard arguments
this morning on the requests but said he would not rule until
Friday at the earliest. Jury selection resumed after the hearing on
the complex arguments.
   The Coast Guard, claiming sovereign immunity as a federal
organization, has said it cannot be forced to provide information
for a state court proceeding.
   But Hazelwood's attorneys said they need the information for his
defense, and that it has been given to state prosecutors. Johnstone
said that before ruling on Hazelwood's arguments, he would attempt
to sort out exactly what information had been provided to
prosecutors.
   A companion defense request argued before Johnstone today asks
that information about the sobriety test Hazelwood failed after the
crash be prohibited as evidence if the Coast Guard is not required
to provide the details.
   Potential jurors questioned on Wednesday said they read and
heard little about the March 24 accident that spilled about 11
million gallons of crude oil into the Prince William Sound.
   Many of the 15 people questioned also said they didn't
necessarily believe the scant publicity to which they were exposed
after the accident.
   Hazelwood is charged with criminal mischief, a felony; and with
operating a vessel while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and
negligent discharge of oil, all misdemeanors. He could face seven
years in prison if convicted of all the charges.
   Jury selection began Tuesday. Johnstone expects to assemble a
jury of 12 plus several alternates in time for attorneys to present
opening arguments in the case on Monday. Fourteen of the 25 people
questioned in the first two days of the selection process were
excluded.
   The court summoned 91 people as potential jurors in the trial,
expected to last at least six weeks.
   Those examined Wednesday and still in the running include a
former oil spill worker, an airline pilot and a grocery manager.
   Johnstone dismissed several people, including a church business
manager he said had ``too much contact and too many opinions'' to
remain under consideration.
   Attorneys for Hazelwood and the state can exclude up to 20
candidates through peremptory challenges. They used six challenges
Wednesday.
   Those rejected in that manner include a former Exxon employee
who called the company arrogant.

<HEAD>HUD Suspends California Company, Among Largest Public Housing
Landlords</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development said today it has suspended a California company and
more than 40 affiliates because of evidence of ``irregular
activities.''
   The companies, which together control some 50,000 federally
assisted housing units and are among the largest subsidized housing
landlords in the country, denied any wrongdoing and accused HUD of
acting vindictively.
   HUD suspended the companies last Friday, notifying them in a
letter that department officials made available today. It was
addressed to the Santa Monica-based Housing Resources Management
Inc. but also applies to nearly four dozen related development
companies.
   Among the related companies is the parent enterprise, Associated
Financial Corp., also of Santa Monica. Housing Resources Management
is one of the companies that manages properties controlled by AFC
and its affiliates.
   The action came as HUD, at the direction of Secretary Jack Kemp,
continues a department-wide review prompted by disclosures last
year of mismanagement and influence-peddling during the tenure of
former Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.
   ``The Department of Housing and Urban Development has
information indicating irregularities of a serious nature
concerning Housing Resources Management Inc.'s dealings with the
government,'' HUD Assistant Secretary C. Austin Fitts said in a
letter addressed to Deane Earl Ross, HRM president. ``The
department has been informed that HRM and its affiliates are under
investigation by the government.''
   An investigation alone is grounds for HUD to place a company on
suspension, department officials said. The letter said HUD also had
``adequate evidence'' that HRM had been involved in ``irregular
activities'' at properties it manages in Oklahoma, the District of
Columbia, and New Orleans.
   HUD alleged the company had made or caused to be made requests
for subsidies for vacant apartments, that it misused reserve funds
and security deposits and that it caused a false repair invoice to
be submitted to the government.
   Kemp visited the Washington property, Tyler House, shortly after
taking over HUD and pronounced conditions at the development
``scandalous.'' Fitts' letter said HRM had misused reserve funds at
Tyler House.
   HUD previously had suspended AFC and its affiliates from
HUD-related business in just the Washington and Oklahoma areas.
   AFC is controlled by A. Bruce Rozet, a prominent Democratic
Party fund-raiser who is often relied on by Congress for advice on
housing policy. AFC has specialized in taking over deteriorating
housing developments and those with major drug infestation.
   It has had several disputes with HUD over the past decade, and
in late 1987 a HUD committee voted to prevent AFC and its
affiliates from buying additional HUD-assisted properties. But the
committee reversed itself after Fitts' predecessor, former
Assistant Secretary Thomas Demery, told the committee he did not
favor the sanctions.

   Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill, said today the House
ethics committee has dismissed a complaint that he sexually
assaulted a Peace Corps worker in Zaire.
   Savage, a black Chicago Democrat, blamed allegations against him
on a ``racist attack'' by white government officials and
white-owned news media.
   The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct said
Wednesday that it had finished its preliminary investigation
against Savage, but did not immediately issue its findings and
refused to reveal its conclusions.
   Committee spokesman Mark Davis would not comment on Savage's
remarks, made in a House floor speech.
   Savage denied a report in The Chicago Tribune that the committee
issued a ``letter of reproval'' against him _ the mildest sanction
available to the panel. A House source with knowledge of the
investigation also said no letter of reproval was being issued.
   The newspaper quoted Rep. John Myers of Indiana, the ranking
committee Republican, as saying the panel ``clearly disapproves''
of Savage's actions and believes he ``used bad judgment.''
   When the ethics committee finishes a preliminary inquiry, it can
charge a member of Congress with specific violations or it can
simply end the case without proceeding further. In ending an
investigation without charges _ for example, because of lack of
evidence _ it can criticize a lawmaker's behavior.
   In another ethics case, the committee said it is dismissing a
complaint filed against Rep. Roy Dyson, D-Md., more than a year ago
by Republicans in his Maryland district. The panel wrote him a
two-paragraph letter Wednesday saying the complaint had been
``considered and dismissed.''
   Republicans in Dyson's district asked the committee on Sept. 26,
1988, to investigate allegations that he violated House rules. The
complaint, filed a few weeks before Dyson was narrowly re-elected
in 1988, cited the lawmaker's fund-raising activities and the
operation of his office.
   ``I particularly urge my black colleagues to publicly stand up
to this racist attack, in order that our white colleagues who
choose to can stand with us,'' Savage said. He said that
``sensational exaggerations'' of the incident ``exploded on white
television and in white newspapers'' and contended he and other
black leaders have experienced ``racist viciousness'' at the
``hands of the white American mass media, Justice Department and
the FBI.''
   The committee considered allegations that Savage assaulted the
female Peace Corps volunteer while on an official trip to Zaire
last March.
   The worker contended Savage fondled her for more than two hours
in the back of a chauffeur-driven embassy car in Kinshasa, the
capital of Zaire, according to several government officials who
confirmed an account originally published in The Washington Post.
   Three of Savage's Democratic colleagues _ Reps. Patricia
Schroeder of Colorado, Matthew McHugh of New York and Barney Frank
of Massachusetts _ formally requested the ethics investigation.
   ``Believe it or not, among these self-appointed guardians of
personal morality was one who since has admitted keeping and
prostituting a homosexual,'' Savage said. ``As for the other two,
so-called white liberals, their sensitivity to racism and their
respect for fairness must be questioned.''
   Frank, D-Mass, has said he is homosexual. The ethics committee
is conducting a preliminary inquiry into allegations by a male
prostitute that Frank allowed a prostitution ring to operate from
his home and that the lawmaker had sex with the prostitute in the
House gym.
   Frank has admitted a sexual relationship with the prostitute,
but denied allowing a prostitution ring to operate in his home and
having sex in the House gym.
   Dan Buck, an aide to Ms. Schroeder, said he had no comment.
Spokesmen for the other two lawmakers were not immediately
available for comment.
   Savage said the ethics committee ``after a preliminary
examination of witnesses, apparently decided that the evidence was
insufficient even to warrant further investigation. Not even a slap
on the wrist.''
   Savage said that if ``anyone was honestly offended'' during the
trip to Zaire, ``it was the American State Department because I
have persuasively opposed our neo-colonialist foreign policy all
over Africa and in many other Third World nations.''

<TEXT>
   Doubters beware. Like other weather
lore, Punxsutawney Phil, America's best-known and best-kept
woodchuck, isn't entirely hogwash, according to folklorists.
   ``A great many folk beliefs have a certain logic behind them. It
may not be scientifically verifiable, but they're often not
completely random and I think this is one of them,'' said Erika
Brady, assistant professor in programs in folk studies at Western
Kentucky University.
   ``We're always kind of taking a look at folk wisdom to see if
there is some basis in fact for it,'' agreed Tim Clark, executive
editor of The Old Farmer's Almanac. ``The lasting lesson is not to
underestimate our ancestors. They were not dumb people.''
   Barring calamity, at sunrise Friday, fat, furry Punxsutawney
Phil will be pulled from a manmade burrow atop Gobbler's Knob,
about a mile outside town.
   If the critter sees his shadow, tradition has it there will be
six more weeks of winter. If he doesn't, spring is supposedly
around the corner.
   ``If you're a groundhog or a person and you come out of your
warm, snug haven that you've made for the winter and get fooled by
the sunlight into thinking it's spring, you're going to be in
trouble,'' Clark said. ``So it says the groundhog is not fooled.
   ``I think it's no coincidence the spring equinox comes about six
weeks after Groundhog Day.''
   The legend actually has roots in Christianity. Groundhog Day
falls on Feb. 2, also the Christian holiday of Candlemas, when the
infant Jesus first was taken to the temple. An old Scottish couplet
claims: ``If Candlemas be fair, there'll be two winters in the
year.''
   Punxsutawney's German-born farmers borrowed the legend and on
Feb. 2, 1887, began turning to local woodchucks for a clue to the
upcoming weather.
   Groundhogs, part of the rodent family, usually hibernate by
December and stay underground until April or so, but sometimes
venture out early if the weather is mild.
   The Punxsutawney Groundhog Club heralds Phil as the seer of
seers, sage of sages, weather prophet extraordinare. Phil has
predicted an early spring a scant nine times over the past century.
The last time was in 1988.
   ``Phil's never been wrong,'' boasted Jim Means, 66, the club's
president and member of the group's exclusive Inner Circle.
   Actually, the 14 local businessmen in the Inner Circle decide
the forecast well in advance. The group even holds rehearsals
before Groundhog Day, when members don top hats and tails and join
about 1,500 people gathered in the dark atop Gobbler's Knob.
   And every day except Groundhog Day, Phil lives in town in a
heated, air-conditioned hutch at the library with two other
groundhogs, known to some as Philomena and Barney.

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III proposed
Thursday that world leaders build relations ``rooted in trust and
in love and in understanding'' and said his own life had improved
when he stopped ``trying to play God.''
   Baker said he had to learn that God ``loves me even as I fail to
become the man that he wants me to be.''
   Uncharacteristically personal, Baker gave the keynote remarks to
the National Prayer Breakfast sponsored by Congress. He was given a
standing ovation.
   President Bush also spoke briefly, and Vice President Dan Quayle
read a New Testament passage. Bush proclaimed his conviction that
the 1990s ``will be the decade of the rebirth ... of faith and
hope.''
   Baker, one of President Bush's closest friends and advisers,
usually maintains a genial but reserved demeanor.
   He said that during nine years in high-level administration
posts he has found that power does not bring fulfullment.
   ``I found early on that having a position of power really
doesn't bring the fulfillment that many people think it does,'' he
said. ``Inner security and true, real fulfilment come by faith. It
doesn't come by wielding power in a town where power is king.''
   He told the audience of legislators and ambassadors that
``spiritual values are important in the pursuit of world peace.''
   ``The Bible tells us that where the spirit of the lord is there
is liberty. So, my friends, I believe that as leaders we can build
relationships around the world that are rooted in trust and love
and understanding, And I believe that we can go beyond rhetoric to
discover concrete ways to express this reality.''
   Baker characterized himself as ``just one person genuinely
struggling to put faith into practice in my life.''
   He recounted an instance several years ago ``when I was really
struggling with a particular problem.'' He said he found strength
in praying about it with his wife, Susan, and realizing that he had
to turn the problem over to God.
   ``Susan helped me to see that I really needed to stop trying to
play god and turn the matter over to faith.''
   The 59-year-old secretary also said he meets regularly ``for
fellowship'' with a group of men he described as ``very normal guys
who just happen to hold positions of power and influence in
Washington.''
   ``Power, of course, can be intoxicating; it can be addictive.
And few doubt that .. power tends to corrupt, and absolute power
corrupts absolutely.''
   ``Over these last nine years, I have had opportunities to
participate in the exercise of more power than I ever would have
imagined. I have felt the weight of responsibility that that brings
and I have to admit to you as well that I have felt the temptations
that are attendant to it,'' he said.
   But power is fleeting, he said, noting how quickly eminent
people lose the trappings of prestige when they lose their
positions.
   ``Having a position of power does not bring inner security or
fulfillment. That comes only, I think, by developing a personal
relationship with God, which for me is personified by Jesus
Christ.''
   Baker said his ``journey of faith'' began when he started
reading the Bible.
   He also talked of the importance of friendship and told how Bush
and his wife, Barbara, had helped him through the painful period
before and after the death of his first wife, Mary, who died of
cancer in 1969.

   The Soviet military commandant expressed
hope Thursday that by mid-February troops could begin returning
home and authorities could lift a curfew imposed after violent
ethnic clashes in Azerbaijan.
   Representatives of Armenia and Azerbaijan prepared to open peace
talks Friday across the Soviet Union in Riga, capital of the Baltic
republic of Latvia.
   A spokesman for the Azerbaijani People's Front accused President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev of caving in to Communist hard-liners by
sending troops to occupy Baku, and added: ``Gorbachev's hands are
now bloody.''
   Lt. Gen. Vladimir S. Dubinyak told the first foreign journalists
permitted to visit Baku since the military seized control of the
city Jan. 20 there are ``many positively inclined forces trying to
noralize the situation and end the curfew.''
   He said the 11 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew might be lifted within two
weeks. He said tensions would have to ease further, including an
end to leaflets appealing to Baku workers to strike to protest the
military presence.
   At night, during the curfew, military trucks and armored
personnel carriers stand at most intersections between Baku airport
and the center of the city. Soldiers guarding the intersections
wear helmets and carry automatic weapons.
   Red flowers mark where Azerbaijanis died fighting the military
intervention.
   On Jan. 13, Azerbaijanis attacked ethnic Armenians and drove
them from their homes in Baku, an oil center and the capital of the
republic of Azerbaijan in the southern Soviet Union. Soviet troops
stormed Baku a week later.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass reported the death toll in
Baku alone since the troops moved in at 139. That includes 106
civilians, 28 soldiers and five policemen. As many as 498 people
were wounded, Tass said.
   Iran on Thursday offered to send doctors, nurses and medicine to
neighboring Soviet Azerbaijan, whose residents are primarily Shiite
Moslem, like most Iranians. The offer was reported by Tehran
television, monitored in Cyprus. Iran has condemned the use of
force in Azerbaijan.
   Dubinyak said regular army soldiers, making up 5,000 of the
17,000 troops now committed to Baku, could be sent home, military
equipment could be removed from the streets, and the remaining
Interior Ministry soldiers could patrol the streets without weapons.
   Dubinyak said he would welcome talks with the Azerbaijan
People's Front, a group that Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov has
said the military is trying to crush as a nationalist movement.
   Dubinyak said the people's front has not proposed talks, but a
spokesman for the group interrupted to say such discussions could
begin any time.
   The People's Front spokesman, Nadchov Nadzhavov, editor of the
group's banned newspaper, charged that soldiers were sent into Baku
in part to prevent the front from making a strong showing in local
elections.
   The date for the elections is to be set this month, and they
must take place within three months.
   ``I can make the prognosis that they won't leave before the
elections,'' Nadzhavov told reporters. He also criticized
Gorbachev's handling of the crisis in Azerbaijan, saying the
Kremlin leader had given in to reformers by not cracking down on an
independence movement in Lithuania and then had given in to
Communist hard-liners by sending troops into Azerbaijan.
   ``Gorbachev's hands are now bloody,'' he said.
   Lt. Gen. Mikhail P. Kolesnikov, a representative of the Soviet
army serving under the commandant, told reporters that the military
had been affected by the ``Tblisi syndrome.''
   He said criticism that followed the crushing of a nationalist
demonstration in the Georgian capital on April 9, 1989, had
demoralized the military and hindered decision making.
   ``We saw outrages,'' he said. ``We saw instances of
blood-letting, but we couldn't do anything.''
   Azerbaijani representatives arrived in Riga for peace talks with
a three-man delegation of the Armenian All-National Movement.
   ``Maybe the first steps toward dialogue with the Armenians will
take place. We are counting on that,'' the chief Azerbaijani
delegate, Khikmet Khazhizade of his republic's People's Front
group, told The Associated Press.
   The talks are sponsored by the Baltic Council, a grouping of the
three people's front organizations in Latvia, Estonia and
Lithuania. Organizers said they hoped the talks could start Friday
morning.
   The Baltic activists cautioned against expecting quick results.
   ``Such talks could help, but we need two or three months, as the
problems are very deep,'' said Edvin Inken, a Latvian People's
Front leader who recently visited Baku.

   Thousands of Iranians gathered at the
late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's tomb Thursday, the 11th
anniversary of his return from exile, and his son preached
continued hostility to America, Tehran radio said.
   On the first anniversary since the revolutionary patriarch's
death June 3, Ahmad Khomeini said his father, known as the Imam,
constantly defied ``global arrogance,'' an Iranian phrase for
United States and its allies.
   ``We must always remain on the Imam's path,'' he said at a
ceremony beginning a 10-day celebration of the Islamic revolution.
   Ahmad Khomeini said his father warned that, ``if we show the
slightest bit of complacency, America will deliver its final blow
against us. You, the people, must prepare for struggle against
America.''
   The radio the younger Khomeini, a leading radical, praised his
father's successor as spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, for
``treading the same path as the Imam.''
   His exhortation for no compromise with the United States was
seen as a warning to President Hashemi Rafsanjani, leader of the
so-called pragmatist faction in Iran.
   Rafsanjani, who attended the ceremony Khomeini's golden-domed
tomb in the Behesht Zahra cemetery, seeks better relations with the
West in order to obtain help in recovering from eight years of war
with Iraq.
   The first part of Rafsanjani's 5-year development plan, calling
for up to $20 billion in foreign investment, got Parliament's
approval Wednesday over opposition from radicals who want state
control and no foreign involvement.
   Tehran television showed throngs at the cemetery chanting
``Death to America!'' and ``Death to Israel!''
   Iranian officials paid their respects at the tomb and promised
to safeguard Khomeini's ideological legacy, the radio said.
   ``At a time when the government was in the hands of the enemy,
the Imam's coming from a safe place to the center of the danger was
an act rooted in the immense power of the Lord,'' Rafsanjani said
at the graveside, the radio reported.
   Khomeini returned from 14 years of exile Feb. 1, 1979, after
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced to flee. Ten days later, the
government he left behind collapsed and Khomeini proclaimed the
Islamic republic,
   Rafsanjani said: ``The Iranian people have proved that if a
nation is resolute in its stand, and if it has courage and spirit,
it cannot be defeated.''
   He said recent changes in Eastern Europe and elsewhere were ``a
small example of what the people of Iran achieved 11 years ago, and
these popular rebellions are the legacy of the people of Iran.''
   Khamenei, the nation's spiritual leader, told another gathering
in Tehran: ``The future belongs to Islam, the Moslems and the
freedom-loving nations of the world,'' the television reported.
   ``In the confrontation with the organizations of the satanic
powers (the West), it will be Islam which triumphs.''
   Despite the fiery rhetoric, this year's anniversary of the
revolution differs from past observances. It reflects the more more
relaxed character of Rafsanjani's government, formed in August, and
an easing of Islamic rigidity.
   While Khomeini was alive, the anniversary was a time of rallies
to show support for him, and of reruns on state television of
bloody clashes between revolutionary zealots and the shah's forces.
   On Thursday, television showed film of Khomeini arriving in
Tehran in 1979 on a chartered Air France jet, but comedy and
children's shows dominated the morning programming.
   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said music would be
part of the celebrations this year for the first time. Khomeini
felt good Moslems should shun music.

   The State Department announced today a
proposed $55 million increase in economic assistance for El
Salvador as Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani headed into
high-level meetings here.
   Before the formal announcement, an administration official had
confirmed a published report that an aid cut was planned, but the
official figures showed $284 million proposed for El Salvador for
fiscal 1991 compared with $229 million for the current year. The
official was unavailable afterward to explain the discrepancy.
   Other Central American countries, however, were cut back as part
of a general reordering of priorities the administration is
undertaking in light of additional claims on the aid program in
Panama and Eastern Europe.
   Military aid to El Salvador would undergo a slight increase in
fiscal 1991, to $91.4 million from the current level of $84.6
million.
   The administration has been concerned that Congress may impose
sharp cutbacks on El Salvador in response to continuing human
rights abuses in that country.
   Bush reiterated his strong support for Cristiani during a photo
session at the White House.
   In the face of congressional criticism over alleged military
involvement in the slaying of six Jesuit priests, Bush praised
Cristiani for arresting four officers and four soldiers in the case.
   ``I know of his commitment to democracy,'' Bush said. ``I have
been very impressed with the courage he has shown in going after
those who have broken the law in his country,'' he said.
   Cristiani earlier went to Capitol Hill for a meeting with key
House Democrats including Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash, Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Rep. Moakley, D-Mass., head of
a House task force looking into El Salvador.
   Moakley described the meeting as ``friendly,'' but said the
congressmen ``let him know what our people are thinking'' about the
human rights situation, particularly the murder of the priests in
November.
   While none of the congressmen threatened directly to cut off
aid, some members told Cristiani ``votes for El Salvador aid have
been diminishing over the years,'' Moakley said.
   But administration officials believe Cristiani may have defused
a potential rebellion in Congress with the arrests a month ago of
eight Army personnel, including a colonel, who were wanted in the
killings.
   Some members of Congress are skeptical about the ability of El
Salvador's criminal justice system to punish those responsible,
noting that tens of thousands of politically motivated killings in
El Salvador remain unsolved.
   But administration officias said Wednesday that any
congressional attempt to link U.S. aid to a successful prosecution
of the Jesuit priests' case probably would not take effect for at
least a year.
   This would give Cristiani time to move ahead on that issue, on
negotiating peace with leftist rebels and on restoring vigor to a
declining economy.
   On Friday, Cristiani is to meet with members of the U.S.
Catholic community in an attempt to reassure them his efforts to
solve the killings of the Jesuits are serious.
   Some of the exasperation of members of Congress, particularly
Democratic liberals, is based on what they perceive to be the
meager rewards of more than $4 billion in U.S. economic and
military outlays for El Salvador over the past decade.
   El Salvador has held a number of multi-party elections since
then, but the country seems no closer to a peace settlement with
the rebels and still has been unable to overcome its reputation as
one of the most lawless nations in the hemisphere.
   On the other hand, Cristiani, with strong administration
support, is convinced that his country continues to be victimized
by Nicaraguan and Cuban attempts to support the leftist rebel
movement.
   Cristiani discussed that issue on Wednesday when he met with
U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar in New York.

   The entire White House press corps will fly
into Colombia when President Bush attends a drug summit there Feb.
15, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday.
   The administration had considered taking most of the press corps
to a different site outside Colombia for security reasons. But that
has been ruled out, and the press corps will fly into Barranquilla,
a Caribbean coastal town about 60 miles northeast of the Cartagena
summit site, Fitzwater said.
   ``We're going in,'' Fitzwater said.
   As usual, a small pool of reporters will fly with Bush aboard
Air Force One and accompany him to Cartagena. Upwards of 100 or
more reporters, photographers and television crew members fly on a
separate press charter wherever the president goes.
   He provided no other immediate details and did not say how Bush
himself would get to Cartagena. The White House has said it will
keep open several options on Bush's itinerary and make a final
decision as the event draws near.
   Bush will meet with Colombian President Virgilio Barco and
officials from Bolivia and Peru.

<TEXT>
   Western European leaders on Thursday supported the
U.S. proposal for significant new troop withdrawals from Europe
but, amid hints of anxiety, stressed they want a continued American
presence.
   Britain said it hoped this was the last reduction planned by
Washington.
   The Soviet Union welcomed as a sign that ``things are changing
for the better'' the proposal by President Bush to cut troop levels
in central Europe to 195,000 for each superpower _ below the
275,000 being negotiated at talks in Vienna.
   But Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
complained the plan did not go far enough, adding, ``We must
continue to have as our goal no foreign troops on foreign soil.''
   ``It must be the ceiling, not the floor,'' said Gerasimov. ``You
can note in his (Bush's) speech he needs American troops in Europe
for here to eternity. ... This is not a good sign.''
   Some analysts said the Bush plan signaled the beginning of the
final withdrawal of American troops from Western Europe _ dreaded
by many of the U.S. allies in NATO _ as well as the departure of
all the Soviets.
   ``I personally would be suprised if the Soviets have anything
like 195,000 soldiers left in East Germany within the next two to
three years,'' said Francois Heisbourg, director of the
London-based Institute of Strategic Studies.
   ``I think the Soviets will be lucky if there is a symbolic
contingent left; a Soviet Guantanamo,'' he said, referring the U.S.
base in Cuba.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Britain
attached ``great importance to President Bush's assurance that the
new figure will be a floor and that no more reductions are
envisaged.''
   ``This will ensure a continued strong American presence in
Europe,'' added the statement from her No. 10 Downing St. office.
   Thatcher aides said Bush telephoned her Saturday to discuss the
proposal, and ``we indicated our support.''
   Bush sent two senior aides to put this plan to the leaders of
the four major Western European powers, Britain, France, West
Germany and Italy.
   The United States has 305,000 troops in central Europe, and the
Soviet Union has 565,000. Another 30,000 U.S. troops in Britain and
southern Europe are excluded from the Bush proposal.
   West Germany, where most of the U.S. troops are deployed, hailed
the proposal. Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it ``a
balanced combination of disarmament policy and unequivocal
recognition of the West's defense readiness and alliance
solidarity.''
   West German enthusiasm for troop pullouts by both sides
reflected eagerness for unification with East Germany, where
380,000 of the Soviet troops on foreign soil are stationed.
   Two other East bloc nations, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, have
demanded that the Soviet forces leave their soil.
   Other European NATO allies are concerned about being dominated
by a powerful, single German state. The fears are heightened on a
continent that was overrun by Nazi Germany in World War II.
   They are also worried about the United States detaching itself
from Europe as the Soviet military threat diminishes with the
collapse of a string of Communist governments in 1989.
   Belgium and the Netherlands followed Mrs. Thatcher's cautious
line.
   ``There have to be talks on the withdrawal of troops, and I
oppose a unilateral initiative,'' said Belgian Foreign Affairs
Minister Mark Eyskens.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said 195,000 U.S.
troops would be the ``minimum level'' needed, Dutch TV reported.
   Both Belgium and the Netherlands, however, have said they are
studying the possibility of withdrawing their forces from West
Germany because of the diminished Soviet threat.
   ``Some of the smaller NATO countries weren't all that firm in
their commitment anyway,'' said Mark Fielder, an analyst at the
Royal United Services Institute in London. ``Now with the Bush
proposal they'll have the best excuse in the world to say, `Let's
have a race to see who can get out first.'''
   Manfred Woerner, secretary-general of the 16-nation North
Atlantic Treaty Organization, said in Brussels the Bush plan was
consistent with U.S. promises ``to maintain significant military
forces in Europe.''
   French President Francois Mitterrand's spokesman, Hubert
Vedrine, said the Bush proposal came ``at an opportune moment'' _
accelerating the Vienna conventional arms talks.
   Italy, Portugal and Norway all said the Bush proposal was
welcome as another initiative toward disarmament.
   The Italian Communist Party, the biggest in the West, called for
an immediate 4 percent cut in Italian defense expenditure and said
Italy need not accept a wing of U.S. F-16 fighters due to be
redeployed from a Spanish base.

   The United States is prepared to normalize
relations with Nicaragua if this month's elections are certified
free and fair and if the Sandinista government halts its support
for leftist guerrillas in neighboring El Salvador, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said Thursday.
   ``If we determine that it is free and fair ... and we determine
that they have indeed stopped their support of subversion in
neighboring countries or in other places in Latin America, then
we'd be prepared to normalize our relations with that government,''
Baker told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Baker said, however, that it was important that the Sandinista
government relent and admit members of President Bush's
congressional observer team to watch election preparations and the
Feb. 25 balloting.
   So far, the 20-member team has been denied visas because the
Managua government contends the United States cannot be an
impartial observer.
   Without the observer group there, ``it's going to be hard for us
to make the judgments required,'' Baker said.
   He added that there also must ``be some period of time during
which we can satisfy ourselves, if the suggestion is made to us,
that they have indeed stopped shipping SA-7 (Soviet-made
antiaircraft) missiles and other miliary equipment to the FMLN
(Salvadoran guerrillas). We're going to have to know that's a fact
before we can begin to normalize.''
   During a two-hour session with the Senate committee, Baker
outlined budget initiatives the administration is seeking in fiscal
1991 and reiterated U.S. support for reforms being pressed by
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Baker leaves Monday on a trip that will take him to Moscow for
meetings with Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and perhaps
Gorbachev.
   ``We seek to probe for points of mutual advantage with the
Soviet Union, turning areas of conflict into areas of cooperation
wherever possible,'' he told the committee. ``In this way we will
benefit ourselves as well as the reformers in Moscow.''
   Primary items on Baker's Moscow agenda are accelerating arms
control agreements, seeking a solution to the war in Afghanistan
between the Soviet-backed Marxist government and U.S.-armed Moslem
fundamentalist rebels, and human rights.
   Baker's testimony followed President Bush's announcement
Wednesday of a new troop-cut proposal in Central Europe, and the
secretary said it was hoped the troop-reduction plan could be
incorporated into a new conventional forces agreement to be
concluded this year.
   He sounded a note of caution, saying ``the old world of dogmatic
dictatorships is on its way out. But the new world of secure,
prosperous and just democracies is not yet here. It will not arrive
automatically.''
   Members of the Senate panel barely mentioned the most recent
point of foreign-policy conflict with the administration, China.
And Baker, as he read from his prepared text, skipped over a
sentence referring to ``the tragic case of China,'' mentioning only
Cuba as an example of ``governments that try to shut out democratic
values.''
   Baker also used his appearance to renew an appeal to Congress to
curb its practice of earmarking foreign aid money for specific
countries, saying the practice has led to an 86 percent cut in aid
to African nations for the current year and sharp reductions in
help to countries like Jamaica that are cooperating with the U.S.
war on drugs and should be able to expect larger rewards.
   And he complained again that ``we have no flexibility'' to meet
unforeseen needs like the $500 million rebuilding program proposed
for Panama.
   There, Baker said, ``what we need to do is throw a little money
at the problem'' because ``we're the ones that did a lot of the
damage.''

   The Bush administration is proposing that more
than half of next year's $14.8 billion foreign aid request be spent
on strategically-placed allies at the expense of the world's
poorest countries.
   The emphasis on catering to key allies is consistent with the
longstanding U.S. view that security concerns must be given
priority over humanitarian concerns in the distribution of aid.
   If Congress approves the administration's fiscal 1991 foreign
aid request, the largest individual recipients of economic and
military support would continue to be Israel, with $3 billion, and
Egypt, with $2.2 billion.
   Those grants, accounting for more than a third of U.S. foreign
aid, reflect U.S. interest in maintaining stability in its two
closest Mideast allies.
   Almost half of the $1.5 billion proposed for Latin America and
the Caribbean would be allocated for three small Central American
countries _ El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras _ where the United
States has been trying to help consolidate stable democratic rule
in the face of leftist opposition.
   These countries, accounting for perhaps 2 per cent of the
population of the region, would receive about $673 million in
economic and military aid.
   This equals more than 80 per cent of the total for the 44
countries of sub-Saharan Africa.
   Writing in Thursday's editions of The Washington Post, the
president of the African Development Foundation, Leonard H.
Robinson, expressed amazement at the quick congressional approval
given in 1989 to a large-scale three-year aid program for Poland
and Hungary.
   ``Where did the $900 million come from?'' he asked. ``Why did it
take only days to secure? As an Africanist, I want to know. So do
the people of Africa.''
   Citing the various environmental and economic calamaties which
have befallen Africa in recent years, Robinson said, ``You have to
wonder why Western nations have not rushed to Africa's aid with the
same degree of alacrity witnessed in Poland and Hungary.''
   Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., said Thursday that African
countries often are cut back by an administration when funds are
needed to help out new claimants on the U.S. aid program.
   ``We raid the accounts of the poorest countries,'' Kassebaum
said during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. In one
key assistance category, she said, Africa was cut back from $99
million in 1989 to $14 million currently.
   The broad outlines of the overall program were released Monday
when the administration's 1991 budget proposal was made public. The
details were disclosed Thursday.
   Among countries with which the United States has military base
agreements, the Philippines would receive $649 million in economic
and military aid compared with $540 million for the current year
while Portugal would get $172 million, compared with $127 million.
   Turkey would receive $598 million in economic and military aid
compared with the current $515 million. Greece would get $345
million in military aid, down $4 million from this year. Greece
gets no economic aid.
   The administration asked Congress for $532 million to combat
drug smuggling, with about 80 percent of that going to Bolivia,
Colombia and Peru. The total for anti-smuggling efforts this year
is slightly under $300 million.
   President Bush will be traveling to Colombia in two weeks to
confer with leaders from those three countries.

   Monkey love may be blossoming at long
last, more than 18 months after Colossus _ billed as the largest
gorilla in captivity _ met a female of the species for the first
time.
   When they were introduced in June 1988, Muke (pronouced Moo-key)
was the first gorilla of any kind that Collosus had seen since he
was captured as an infant in the jungles of Africa 21 years earlier.
   He led a solitary existence at a New Hampshire attraction until
he was purchased by The Zoo in this Florida Panhandle city three
months before Muke's arrival on breeding loan from the St. Louis
Zoo.
   Since then the 23-year-olds have shared the outdoor gorilla
compound during the day but did little more than stare across the
courtyard at one another and tangle in an occasional spat.
   They slept in separate cages at night until last week, said Zoo
Director Pat Quinn at a news conference Wednesday.
   Love did not fill the air during their first night together.
Muke emerged covered with dung.
   ``I guess he just spent the night flinging dung at her,'' Quinn
said.
   But Quinn is encouraged that Colossus, who weighs more than 550
pounds, and Muke, a dainty 300-pounder, may mate.
   The week of sleeping together has awakened ``primeval desires''
in Colossus, Quinn said. Colossus is paying more attention to Muke
and she is menstruating regularly, something she wasn't doing
before, said Jean Benchimol, general curator at the The Zoo.
   ``I think we need to give them some time,'' Quinn said. ``Once
they find they can live together ... there's a good possibility
they will breed.''

<HEAD>Washoe County Jail Inmates Go Cold Turkey Under No-Smoking Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some inmates of the Washoe County Regional
Jail went cold turkey Thursday and sheriff's department workers
were forced to cut down on cigarettes under a new strict no-smoking
policy.
   The policy, banning smoking in jail facilities and desginating
only a few smoking areas for employees, was intended ``to provide a
smoke-free and healthy environment'' in the department's four main
buildings.
   Undersheriff Dan Coppa said a few inmates and workers don't like
the new rules, but crowded working conditions and an overcrowded
jail have been making it more difficult for non-smokers to breathe.
   ``What we have found is there is a handsome body of inmates and
employees that don't smoke and things were getting complicated by
crowded conditions,'' Coppa said. ``We were getting ventilation
problems and complaints.''
   The federal Centers for Disease Control reported last July that
Nevada had the second-highest lung cancer death rate in the nation,
based on 1986 figures. The CDC reported Nevada's rate was 68.3
deaths per 100,000, compared to the national average of 52.1.
   The jail, built for 458 inmates, held 638 Thursday when the
no-smoking policy went into effect following a gradual decrease in
cigarette sales in the facility to encourage people to start
cutting back, Coppa said.
   Connie Brown, dispatch supervisor at the sheriff's Incline
Village substation, has endured restricted smoking areas for more
than a year ahead of the new department-wide, no-smoking policy.
   ``I have to go outside the dispatch area in the receiving room
to smoke,'' said Mrs. Brown, who has been lighting up for 37 years
and said she has no plans to quit.
   Mrs. Brown said she has gone from smoking about one and one half
packs of cigarettes a day to about one pack since tobacco use was
limited in her substation.
   Nevada prohibits cigarette use in most public access local and
state government buildings except in designated areas.
   The state's prison system doesn't have a no-smoking policy for
inmates, some of whom have sued in the past, seeking a court order
requiring their custodians to separate smokers from non-smokers.
   But the lawsuits have been dismissed and prison officials have
said it would be too much of a burden to separate smokers from
non-smokers when deciding which prisoners should bunk together.

   Honeywell Inc. has been ordered to pay a man
$500,000 for urging a rival company to fire him.
   An Allegheny County jury Wednesday awarded Joseph Collincini,
42, of Crafton $100,000 in compensatory damages and $400,000 in
punitive damages.
   Collincini, who worked for Minneapolis-based Honeywell for 12
years, claimed the company lobbied American Technical Systems to
fire him in a series of letters to the company. He was fired in
April 1987.
   Honeywell, which plans to appeal, said the letters notified ATS
that Collincini was using information he obtained while working at
Honeywell and asked him to stop. Honeywell said ATS fired
Collincini because of financial difficulties at ATS.
   Collincini lost his job as a salesman for industrial equipment
when Honeywell cut back on employees in the Pittsburgh area in
October 1986. He was hired by ATS in a similar position in December
1986.

   A 911 call recorded part of a
violent family argument in which a son allegedly slashed his
mother's throat, shot his father and said: ``That'll take care of
both of you.''
   Police released the 911 tapes, but have refused to give other
details about what led to the confrontation Tuesday, except to say
that it was apparently caused by a dispute over money.
   Joan Amos, 54, died about an hour after paramedics found her
bleeding in an upstairs bedroom.
   Charles Amos, who was in serious condition Thursday at Bayfront
Medical Center, had called 911 only seconds after he was shot in
the stomach.
   He stayed on the phone for about five minutes while an emergency
dispatcher tried to keep him calm.
   ``Oh God. My stomach is hurting like hell,'' said Amos, 49.
   ``OK. Relax, relax,'' the dispatcher responded.
   When police arrived, Amos, who is disabled, was unable to move
from a recliner to the door to let them in.
   ``Break down the door and come on in!'' Amos yelled. ``I can't
get there.''
   After paramedics arrived, Amos told police he had been shot by
his son, Jonathan, 26, who he said used a handgun wrapped in a
towel, according to arrest warrants.
   Jonathan Amos and a companion, 19-year-old John DeHate of Largo,
were arrested a few hours later in Sumter County following a chase
along Interstate 75.
   Both were charged with first-degree murder and attempted murder.
They remained in the Pinellas County Jail on Thursday without bond.

   A Soviet cosmonaut took a spin in space Thursday
on a special motorcycle designed for rescuing spacemen, and
officials said the vehicle's maiden journey outside the orbiting
station Mir was a success.
   Flight engineer Alexander A. Serebrov rode the cycle as far as
30 yards away from the giant station, while mission commander
Alexander S. Viktorenko stayed at Mir's exit hatch and monitored
the cycle's operations.
   Soviet TV interrupted its regular programs several times during
the day for special coverage of the five-hour spacewalk. Live
pictures showed Serebrov, 45, attached to a tether anchored on Mir
as he prepared to ride the cycle.
   A taped report showed the cosmonaut, with his left side in the
sun and right in shadow, slowly riding away from Mir, his image
growing smaller.
   A correspondent emphasized the drama of floating in space while
connected to Mir only by a rope. He told viewers in the nighttime
newscast ``Vremya'' it was ``risky and dangerous work.''
   But Tass said the results of the 30-yard test ride and three
five-yard trips were good. ``Its easy operation and good
maneuverability were confirmed,'' the news agency said. Further
tests are planned Monday.
   It's not much of a motorcycle by Earth standards; it actually
looks more like a floating armchair, weighing 485 pounds with 32
motors.
   The cycle is designed for repairing satellites and rescuing
spacemen in distress. It can rotate and move to a maximum distance
of 50 yards away from Mir.
   The device, formally known as the Cosmonaut Movement System, is
similar to the Manned Maneuvering Unit that U.S. space shuttle
astronauts have used, Soviet officials say.
   The cycle was delivered to Mir on Dec. 6, after two delays. It
originally was scheduled to blast off last April but it wasn't
ready, and a second launching planned for September was scrapped
because of problems with its electronic docking system.
   The 20-ton Mir was designed to be permanently manned, and was
host to a record yearlong flight by two cosmonauts in 1988. But it
was unexpectedly mothballed in April because the module and another
add-on were not ready and keeping a crew aboard would have cost
money when legislators and ordinary Soviets were demanding that
space rubles be spent on Earth.
   The four-month vacancy was only the second time since Mir was
launched in February 1986 that it was unmanned.
   Mir already is joined with Kvant, an astrophysics laboratory.
   Viktorenko and Serebrov have been aboard Mir since September and
are scheduled to be replaced later this month by another crew.

   Workers used chainsaws to hack through
the wings of Avianca Flight 52 on Thursday as crews began clearing
the wreckage from the crash that killed 73 people.
   ``This has been a terrible experience. We're anxious for them to
get rid of this plane,'' said Samuel Tissenbaum, whose Glen Cove
home narrowly avoided destruction in the Jan. 25 crash. The plane's
nose remains stuck in the deck of his home.
   Avianca hired Charlotte Aircraft Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., to
remove the wreckage, and a half-dozen workers were on hand Thursday
afternoon sawing the wings into 5-foot pieces and loading them into
a truck. National Transportation Safety Board officials wrapped up
their on-site investigation Wednesday.
   Seventy-three people died and 85 were injured when the plane,
heading to John F. Kennedy International Airport from Colombia,
slammed into a hillside after apparently running out of gas.
   Tissenbaum, who lives with his wife, said his house suffered
structural damage in the crash. The removal of the wreckage will go
a long way toward returning his life to normal, he said.
   ``We're constantly reminded of the disaster,'' he said.
   Before workers began cutting up the plane, the scene appeared
frozen in time since the night of the crash, with hunks of twisted
metal, seats and other debris scattered on the hillside.
   The cleanup could take up to three weeks because the wooded site
can only be reached by a single winding road, said police Sgt. John
Woodworth.
   Nassau County police were also at the scene collecting any
remaining luggage, property and other personal effects of the
passengers. New York Telephone and the Long Island Lighting Co.
workers removed downed wires and cut down trees.
   The body of the plane's captain, Laureano Caviedes Hoyos, was
returned Thursday to Colombia after a funeral service on Long
Island a day earlier.
   Caviedes, 56, was an Avianca pilot for 28 years. He was survived
by his wife and two sons, ages 13 and 14, who live in Bogota,
Colombia.
   NTSB investigators, who have not declared the cause of the
crash, will fly to Bogota next week to review the plane's
maintenance records and other information.

   Education leaders and Democrats in Congress
decried on Thursday a ``yawning gap'' between President Bush's
soaring goals for America's schools and the 2 percent increase in
his education budget.
   They asked where the money would come from to meet Bush's aims
of reducing the dropout rate drastically and making U.S. children
world-beaters in math and science by the turn of the century.
   ``There is a yawning gap between the rhetoric of President
Bush's education speeches and the funding levels he offers in his
budget,'' said Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation
of Teachers.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said that parents and students
``need to have explained to them: How is a 2 percent increase for
the Pentagon a major cut while a 2 percent increase in education is
a major increase?''
   Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos defended Bush's approach,
insisting, ``It's not a matter of dollars.''
   ``We could keep on adding ... another billion and another
billion. That is not going to solve the education deficit,''
Cavazos told reporters at a White House briefing on Bush's six
education goals.
   The way math and science are taught must be radically changed,
he said. Just putting more dollars into the current system ``is not
going to make good mathematicians'' of students, said Cavazos,
adding, ``They probably won't be able to add it.''
   Bush unveiled the goals four months after agreeing at the
education summit with the 50 governors in Charlottesville, Va., to
produce the first performance goals for the nation's schools.
   The National Governors Association will not vote on the end
product until their winter meeting at the end of this month, but
Cavazos said the goals have the backing of a governors' task force
on education. Those governors _ Terry Branstad of Iowa, Bill
Clinton of Arkansas, Carroll Campbell of South Carolina and Booth
Gardner of Washington _ attended the State of the Union and Bush
saluted them for their role.
   ``We still have a lot of work to do'' in drafting detailed
objectives on how to reach Bush's lofty goals, said Cavazos, but he
added that he expects no major changes.
   Despite his insistence that more money is not needed to meet
Bush's goals, Cavazos stressed that the Education Department's
proposed $24.6 billion budget for fiscal 1991 ``is the largest
education budget that this nation has had,'' and includes ``a very
healthy 6.2 percent increase in discretionary programs.''
   Overall, Bush sought $500 million, or 2 percent, more for the
Education Department. He also requested an extra $500 million for
Head Start, which is in the Department of Health and Human Services
budget.
   Asked why the education budget would rise at a slower pace than
the 3 percent rise in overall federal spending, Cavazos said his
department is paying lower interest rates on student loans than it
once was. He denied that aid to college students was being reduced.
   ``The way that you really become the education president ... is
to change the educational system so it's a positive system; it's an
effective system,'' said Cavazos, who said federal, state and local
spending on schools surged 26 percent after inflation in the 1980s.
   Bush, in his address, said, ``Real improvement in our schools is
not simply a matter of spending more. It is a matter of asking more
_ expecting more _ of our schools, our teachers, of our kids, and
our parents and ourselves.''
   Some education leaders and Democrats were not impressed.
   Richard Miller, executive director of the American Association
of School Administrators, said, ``We want to get beyond rhetoric.
... His budget proposal for education is at odds with the goals.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, commenting after Bush unveiled
the goals in Wednesday's State of the Union Address, said, ``You
can't become the education president ... by proposing a meager 2
percent increase in the education budget.''
   Cavazos said that ``when you compare our students against their
peers (in) the industrialized nations of the world, we come out at
the bottom in math and almost at the bottom in science.''
   ``We have an attitudinal problem that we have to face,'' he
added, citing surveys that show American students think they are
good in math when in fact they are mediocre. Students in countries
such as South Korea who shine in math take the opposite attitude,
underrating their ability.
   Nearly 30 percent of American teenagers now drop out of high
school, although some return to get their diploma or equivalency
degree. Minnesota traditionally has been the only state with a 90
percent graduation rate. the presiden's goal for the nation.

<HEAD>No Smear Campaign Against Politicians in 1970s, Thatcher Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newly discovered documents about covert attempts
to discredit the IRA in the 1970s contain no evidence of a smear
campaign against leading politicians, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher said Thursday.
   Lawmakers who claim they were targets pressed for a full inquiry
despite the denial, on grounds the allegations would not disappear
otherwise.
   ``The time has come for a full, open and honest uncovering of
these things so that people in Northern Ireland can know that this
has come to an end, the dirty tricks that were carried on,'' said
the Rev. Ian Paisley, a militant Protestant leader in the province.
   Paisley, who has been described as a target of smears, led
opposition to British government policy during the 1970s.
   For years, Mrs. Thatcher has denied allegations by Colin
Wallace, a former army press officer, of a ``dirty tricks''
campaign against the Irish Republican Army and some politicians.
   In a letter Wednesday to a lawmaker of her Conservative Party,
she acknowledged her statements were based on false information
from civil servants. British ministers are not allowed to examine
papers of former administrations and must rely on facts given them
by civil servants.
   Her letter was released one day after her government confirmed
the existence of a covert operation, codenamed ``Clockwork
Orange,'' that fed lies to journalists reporting from Northern
Ireland, where the Irish Republican Army is fighting to end British
rule.
   Mrs. Thatcher and her defense secretary, Tom King, repeated
Thursday that the documents unearthed in the bureaucracy provided
no evidence the campaign was extended to politicians.
   The prime minister told the House of Commons she stands by her
statement in May 1987 that there was ``no evidence of misuse of
information by any member of the security services.''
   In particular, she said, there was no evidence of a plot to
undermine the 1974-76 Labor Party government of Prime Minister
Harold Wilson, as alleged in ``Spycatcher,'' the memoirs of former
MI5 agent Peter Wright.
   ``My own statement of May 6, 1987, was not affected by the new
information, nor does the new information provide any evidence of
attempts to undermine or discredit ministers,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Wallace says he was dismissed in 1975, four years before Mrs.
Thatcher became prime minister, for threatening to expose the
campaign.
   In addition to his regular army duties, Wallace says, he led a
secret psychological warfare unit in Northern Ireland in the 1970s.
His superior officer backed up the statement.
   According to Wallace, ``Clockwork Orange'' began as an attempt
to discredit the IRA through false stories, such as a claim the
guerrillas had Soviet rockets armed with unstable explosives, and
was expanded later to smear politicians such as Wilson and his
predecessor, Edward Heath.
   Tony Benn, a former Labor minister, said former Prime Minister
James Callaghan also was a target.
   Sir David Steel, former leader of the Liberal Party, added his
own name to the list and said a Parliament committee should
investigate.
   Paul Foot said in his book ``Who Framed Colin Wallace?'' that
Wallace was given detailed information from the MI5
counterintelligence agency that enabled him to make allegations
about homosexuality, bogus bank accounts, corrupt earnings and
Communist sympathies.
   Foot, a journalist, said the campaign was intended to keep Labor
from being re-elected in 1974 and to remove Heath and former
Northern Ireland Minister William Whitelaw from top positions in
the Conservative Party.
   Heath and Whitelaw had made contact with the IRA as part of the
government effort to solve the problems of the troubled province.
   Wallace said the campaign also involved preparing forged
documents to smear the Labor Party. Merlyn Rees, Labor's Northern
Ireland secretary at the time, said a pro-IRA statement was
doctored to include his name and suggest he was sympathetic to
terrorism.
   Confirmation of ``Clockwork Orange'' came during an announcement
by Armed Forces Minister Archie Hamilton of an investigation of the
Defense Ministry decision to fire Wallace.
   The government accused Wallace of passing a restricted document
to a journalist. After appealing, he was allowed to resign.
   Wallace took a public relations job, but in 1981 was convicted
of the manslaughter of a friend and served five years in prison.
Foot's book focuses on that killing and suggests Wallace was framed.
   ``A Clockwork Orange'' is the title of a novel by Anthony
Burgess, published in 1962, about extreme forms of mind control in
a totalitarian state. A movie based on it was released in 1971.

   President Bush will invite both Nelson Mandela
and F.W. de Klerk to pay separate visits to the White House if and
when South African authorities free Mandela from prison, a
spokesman announced Thursday.
   Bush, through his press secretary, praised de Klerk's
``courageous and important steps'' to end apartheid and move toward
``a democratic and non-racial South Africa.''
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater revealed plans to proffer the
invitations amid news reports that Mandela's release after 27 years
in prison could come as early as Friday.
   But Fitzwater said, ``I have no independent information on his
release.''
   Mandela, 71, leader of the outlawed African National Congress,
has been imprisoned for more than 27 years for sedition for
planning the start of the ANC's guerrilla campaign.
   De Klerk is scheduled to deliver a major address to Parliament
on Friday. Aides have denied reports that he personally met with
Mandela earlier in the week to discuss terms of Mandela's release.
   They did meet last Dec. 13 and since then, both the white
minority-ruled government and Mandela's ANC movement have given
increasingly serious consideration to the possibility of
negotiations.
   Fitzwater said in a statement:
   ``The president has been closely following the situation in
South Africa. He believes that President de Klerk has taken a
number of courageous and important steps aimed at ending apartheid
and moving toward a democratic and non-racial South Africa.
   ``Should Mandela be released, the president would plan to invite
both Mandela and de Klerk separately to meet with him at the White
House so the president can determine how the U.S. can best help
South Africa move forward toward a non-racial government and
society.''
   Earlier, Fitzwater told reporters Bush would invite Mandela ``to
Washington for a visit as soon as it is convenient for him.''
   ``We will certainly support his release. We're hopeful he will
be,'' said Fitzwater.
   Mandela's release is seen as necessary before black leaders will
enter negotiations.
   South Africa's 5 million whites have maintained control through
apartheid laws that severely restricted the political and economic
rights of the country's 26 million blacks.
   But the apartheid system, buffeted by international condemnation
and protests from within, has begun to weaken in recent years.

   Pregnant women may eat for two, but
Ygnacio Haro found himself pacing for two at Fresno Community

   His wife and daughter gave birth within an hour Wednesday,
making Haro the father of a 6-pound, 3-ounce girl at 10:15 p.m. and
grandfather of a 6-pound, 15-ounce girl at 10:58 p.m.
   ``We didn't think they would both give birth the same day _ it
just turned out that way,'' Haro said. ``My daughter was married
last April and my wife and I talked about having another kid, and
it just came to pass.''
   The infant girl is the fourth child for Haro and his wife,

addition to their oldest daughter, Rennee Carrillo. The baby girl
is Carrillo's first.
   At 41, Haro said he's looking forward to having an infant in the
house again.
   ``Half the fun of having kids is taking care of them and seeing
them grow up and be on their own,'' Haro said.
   But he said, ``I think this will be our last one. My wife is 40
and I think we're getting a little old _ there's nothing wrong,
just a little old.
   ``But anything is possible,'' Haro added.

<HEAD>Kennedy Calls for Deeper Defense Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy proposed Thursday a
five-year, $139 billion cut in defense spending below the levels
President Bush wants. Kennedy said the savings should go to
reducing the deficit and financing domestic programs.
   The Massachusetts Democrat said improvements in East-West
relations justify a siphoning of defense dollars into education,
environment, anti-drug and other social initiatives.
   Kennedy, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee,
did not say where the defense cuts should be made. He said that,
``just as starters,'' he would favor cuts in the Strategic Defense
Initiative, the MX mobile missile and the B2 stealth bomber.
   ``What America needs now is bold leadership on defense, not cold
leftovers from the right wing's Cold War kitchen,'' Kennedy told
reporters. ``And if President Bush won't supply that leadership,
Congress should.''
   Kennedy proposed cutting defense spending in fiscal 1991 to $292
billion in outlays, $11 billion lower than Bush proposed in the
budget he released Monday.
   Kennedy said he wanted spending to decline gradually to $274
billion in fiscal 1995. Under Bush's plan, military spending would
be $319 billion in 1995.
   Kennedy said he hoped that his proposed defense cuts would
permit tax cuts, as well as shrink the federal deficit and better
finance domestic programs.

<HEAD>Darman, King Urge AARP to Fight Moynihan Tax-Cut Plan</HEAD>

   Budget director Richard G. Darman called on
the nation's largest senior citizen organization Thursday to help
fight a proposed Social Security tax cut that he said would
inescapably threaten benefits.
   ``I would urge you all to consider ever so seriously what really
is at stake here,'' Darman told leaders of the American Association
of Retired Persons. ``This is not something to play around with.''
   The administration is fighting a proposal by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., that would roll back the Social Security tax
increase that took effect Jan. 1 and further reduce the levy next
year.
   The tax was raised from 7.51 percent of the first $51,300 of
wages to 7.65 percent, with the employer paying an equal amount.
Moynihan wants it rolled back to 5.1 percent eventually.
   A principal aim of the proposal is to prevent the government
from using surplus Social Security taxes to make the overall
federal deficit appear smaller than it is.
   Darman told the AARP's 38-member legislative council that
Moynihan's plan would do nothing to solve the deficit problem yet
would be ``inescapably a threat to Social Security benefits.''
   He asked the group ``to draw upon the enormous respect that you
command, that we do not command,'' to lobby Congress against the
plan.
   Darman was followed to the lectern by Social Security
Commissioner Gwendolyn King, who made a promise when she was sworn
in six months ago to snarl ``like a junkyard dog'' if anyone
threatened Social Security.
   ``The junkyard dog is going to do a little bit of growling,''
Mrs. King told the group. ``I shouldn't have to remind this group
how important the trust fund is.''
   Mrs. King urged the AARP to speak out strongly against the
Moynihan proposal. The AARP's legislative council on Friday will
make policy recommendations to the organization's executive
committee.
   ``I'm not going to press you, but I do want you to know how
important it is that you not leave me out here by myself, that you
not cop out of this debate,'' she said.
   Mrs. King said that if the payroll tax were reduced, ``it's not
far down the road, I can assure you, that somebody's going to come
back and suggest benefit cuts.''
   The AARP council heard from Moynihan, who also sought its
support, earlier this week. He disputed administration claims that
his plan would threaten benefits.
   The arguments from both sides were politely received, but
council members divided on who is right.
   Dennis Crites, a council member from Norman, Okla., said
Moynihan's plan had helped draw attention to the budget problems,
but he said ``it develops a life of its own, it may be damaging.''
   Lou Schwartz of Teaneck, N.J., said he likes Moynihan's plan
because it would ``lower the taxes on those who can least afford to
pay it and open the door to have the people that can afford to pay
it pay it.''
   The administration lobbying effort came just one day after
President Bush urged Congress to keep hands off Social Security.
However, two Republican lawmakers introduced bills Thursday that
are variations of the Moynihan proposal.
   The two proposals:
   _By Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., to reduce Social Security taxes
in three steps to 6.75 percent in 1992. That would mean a
three-year tax cut totaling $519 for a high-earning worker. Social
Security surpluses would no longer be considered in calculating the
federal deficit; the 1993 target date for balancing the budget
would be extended to 1997.
   _By Rep. Hank Brown of Colorado, senior Republican on the House
Ways and Means subcommittee on Social Security, to repeal this
year's tax increase; take Social Security out of the deficit
calculations, and require the government to report annually on
whether the pension system is sound enough to provide benefits for
future retirees.
   Brown's bill also would increase to $15,000 a year the amount of
wages a person between the ages of 65 and 69 may earn without
losing any Social Security benefit. Present law takes away $1 of
pension for each $3 of wages above $9,360.
   Kasten said Congress is almost certain to at least repeal this
year's Social Security tax increase. He predicted lawmakers will
reject the ``politics of fear,'' which he described as allegations
that cuts in taxes would lead to reductions in benefits.

   Some homeless people are testing portable
cardboard shelters manufactured by an Illinois company for use by
those who live on the streets.
   Three of the prototype Porta-Sleeper Shelters were given to
homeless people by the Rev. Gerald Roseberry, who operates a
ministry for the homeless.
   The 14-pound tent-like cardboard shelters are about 3 feet high
and 3 feet wide and are coated to be water-resistant. The
one-person shelters fold up and can be carried with a built-in
handle.
   The shelters were proposed by Robert Silvert, a salesman for
Gaylord Container Corp. of Deerfield, Ill. The company hopes to
mass-produce them, but has yet to set the price, said a spokesman
at Gaylord's headquarters.
   One of those testing the shelters, Leah Wilson, 21, approved of
the sleeping box. ``So far it's all right. No problem,'' he said.

<HEAD>California County Gives Emergency Workers Anti-AIDS Drug</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LYNN ELBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Firefighters, police officers and health
workers exposed to the AIDS virus on the job can get free doses of
the drug AZT in a pioneering program in one California county,
officials said Thursday.
   Orange County officials said they believe it is the first
organized program nationwide to offer emergency workers access to
the AIDS-fighting drug.
   ``Health care workers are not the only people who get exposed
(to AIDS),'' said Dr. Tom Prendergast, chief epidemiologist for the
county south of Los Angeles. Paramedics, police and others who risk
exposure also should have use of AZT, he said Thursday.
   The program, implemented in September, was discussed by county
AIDS coordinator Penny Weismuller at an AIDS conference Wednesday.
   Under the program, five public safety workers took AZT
immediately after potential exposure to the virus, Ms. Weismuller
said. Animal studies indicate that infection may be prevented if
the drug is administered within 96 hours of exposure, she said.
   The therapy was suggested in August by researchers with the
National Institutes of Health and the University of California, San
Francisco, who have developed AZT programs for their health-care
workers.
   The program is intended for workers involved in incidents which
would put them at serious risk of exposure if the other person
turned out to be infected with AIDS, Ms. Weismuller said. Examples
would be cases where the worker is actually stabbed by a needle, or
directly exposed to blood.
   The first person to take AZT under the Orange County program was
a police officer who cut his arm while scuffling with a man, Ms.
Weismuller said. Blood from a cut in the man's scalp dripped
directly into a wound the officer sustained during the fight.
   ``The city called us right away, which was good, because we knew
this suspect and knew he was (AIDS virus) positive,'' Ms.
Weismuller said. The officer took the drug for the recommended four
weeks and continues to test negative for the virus, she added.
   The four other workers given AZT took it for less than four
days, she said. They stopped using the drug after the people they
were exposed to tested negative for the virus.
   Anaheim Fire Chief Jeff Bowman said Thursday the AZT program
must be viewed cautiously.
   ``I'm very much in favor of it, but it's not a cure-all,''
Bowman said. There are concerns about AZT side effects, which
include nausea and headaches, and about long-term consequences such
as cancer, he said.
   ``The best thing is prevention,'' Bowman said, noting that masks
and gloves intended to prevent exposure to the AIDS virus have
become standard gear for paramedics.
   The most common type of exposure occurs when workers handling
needles contaminated with blood from an AIDS patient accidentally
prick themselves, officials said.
   ``When you're working a car accident in the middle of a street
at night, needles are flying everywhere,'' Bowman said.
   Orange County pays for the AZT therapy, but asks reimbursement
from cities or worker-compensation plans, Ms. Weismuller said. The
drug costs about $200 for the month-long period.
   Only about 4 percent of those who are directly exposed to the
AIDS virus on the job develop the disease, said Julie Gerberding, a
UC researcher.
   Orange County, population about 2.2 million, had an AIDS rate
through November 1989 of 54.6 cases per 100,000 population,
Prendergast said. That compares to a national rate of 45.3 cases
per 100,000, he said.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government radio station Voice of
America informed employees Thursday that budget cuts will silence
six of its 43 language broadcasts on three continents.
   ``We are doing to ourselves what 30 years of Soviet jamming
couldn't do,'' VOA Director Richard W. Carlson told hundreds of
broadcasters, editors and engineers. ``This is the toughest and
saddest day of my professional life.''
   Going off the air by April 1 will be the Turkish, Greek,
Slovenian, Lao, Uzbek and Swahili services. The 57 employees of
those services will lose their jobs.
   Elimination of the six services will save VOA $2.9 million,
officials said.
   VOA, which has been providing news and entertainment to millions
of listeners since 1942, has been grappling with budget cuts for
several years. Since 1987 it has laid off more than 200 people,
shut down five bureaus in the United States and abroad, and
eliminated hundreds of radio hours in various languages.
   ``If we don't get budget relief, more cuts could be possible,''
said Carlson.
   Carlson said VOA and its parent, the U.S. Information Agency,
had decided that ``amputation'' of several services was preferable
to ``dismemberment'' of broadcast departments across the board.
   The selection of the services to be eliminated was made in
accordance with a list of priorities that takes into account the
geopolitical importance of the targeted countries and the
availability of other foreign media there.
   Radio Free Europe, the U.S.-funded, Munich-based radio network
that broadcasts only to Eastern Europe, has an Uzbek service. The
British Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts in Slovenian, as well
as in Greek and Turkish. Laos, a landlocked, impoverished communist
country, is the only one of the six which does not receive foreign
language broadcasts.
   ``This will cripple our efforts at a time of unprecedented
change and opportunity,'' Carlson said. He praised the employees
for helping fan the winds of revolution blowing throughout the
world.
   The elimination of the Slovenian service comes as residents of
Slovenia are leading the surge of reform in Yugoslavia. But most
Slovenians speak Serbo-Croatian, a VOA service which continues to
air, Carlson said.
   VOA's problems were compounded this week when the
administration's 1991 budget proposal released to Congress mandated
the addition of a Tibetan language service. VOA officials estimate
that if they air two hours a week of Tibetan programs, the new
service will cost $1.5 million.
   VOA's operating budget for 1990 was about $170 million, and the
budget for 1991 is expected to be $174 million. Carlson said this
includes a 3.5 percent wage increase and still leaves VOA $1.5
million short.
   After announcing the cuts to the employees, Carlson read the
names of each of the employees who will lose their jobs. Many of
them have worked for VOA more than 20 years.

<HEAD>Bush Calls Cristiani `Shining Example' of Democrat Commitment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday called El
Salvador's President Alfredo Cristiani ``a shining example to all
of us'' of democratic commitment, as the administration proposed a
$62 million boost in aid to the Central American nation.
   The State Department said the administration is proposing $284
million for El Salvador in economic aid for fiscal 1991 compared
with $229 million for the current year. Military aid would rise
slightly, to $91.4 million from the current $84.6 million, if
Congress approves.
   There is concern within the administration that congressional
skepticism about human rights abuses in El Salvador, and in
particular the slaying of six Jesuit priests last fall, might
prompt a scaling back of El Salvador's aid package. Officials hope
the arrest of eight military men in the case by Cristiani's
government will diffuse the criticism.
   Bush sought to make clear Thursday that he is squarely behind
Cristiani, praising him at a photo session for his diligence in the
Jesuits' case.
   ``I know of his commitment to democracy,'' Bush said. ``I have
been very impressed with the courage he has shown in going after
those who have broken the law in his country. And he's been a
shining example to all of us.
   ``I support him now. I will support him in the future. And the
success of democracy in El Salvador is a very important thing to
us, to this coutnry.
   While Bush and Cristiani met, a small group of protesters
marched in front of the White House against continued U.S. aid to
El Salvador.
   One carried a sign reading, ``kinder-gentler death squads,'' a
reference to the right-wing groups _ linked in the past both to the
military and to Cristiani's political party _ that have carried out
many killings and tortured leftists in El Salvador.
   Cristiani said his talks at the White House and on Capitol Hill
did not focus on the aid question as much as on efforts to restart
peace talks with the leftist guerrillas battling his government.
   However, he told reporters, any cut in aid by Congress would
send ``negative signals'' to the rebels that would impede efforts
for peace talks.
   On Capitol Hill , Cristiani met with key House Democrats
including Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.; Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., and Rep. Jospeh Moakley, D-Mass., head of a House
task force on El Salvador.
   Moakley said the congressmen ``let him know what our people are
thinking'' about the human rights situation, particularly the
Jesuit killings.
   While none of the congressmen threatened directly to try to cut
off aid, some did tell Cristiani that ``votes for El Salvador aid
have been diminishing over the years,'' Moakley said.

   The government further relaxed curfew
restrictions in violence-wracked Kashmir Thursday and claimed the
situation was improving, but a former chief minister said the
Moslem agitation for secession was far from over.
   ``Kashmir is sitting on a volcano,'' said Farooq Abdullah, who
resigned as chief minister, or the state's top elected official, on
Jan. 19. ``We do not know if it will simmer down or blow up.''
   Abdullah called on the government to initiate talks with
militants seeking independence for the strategic northern state,
which is claimed by both India and Pakistan.
   Since the government launched a crackdown on the secessionist
movement Jan. 20, at least 72 mostly Moslem protesters died in
confrontations with security forces.
   On Thursday, authorities lifted the curfew until evening and
there were no reports of violence. When the curfew was reimposed,
the last two reporters for foreign news media known to be in
Srinagar received letters from a local official ordering them to
leave the city.
   However, it remained to be seen whether the orders would be
implemented. With the curfew back in force overnight, as it had
been for the past 12 days, everyone in the city of 1 million was
ordered to stay indoors. There were no flights out of Srinagar,
virtually inaccessible by road, until Friday afternoon.
   The orders were issued to Dilip Ganguly of The Associated Press
and Anil Penna of Agence France-Presse, both Indian citizens. The
orders, issued in the name of the Srinagar district magistrate
Ghulam Abbas, said the reporters' presence was ``adjudged
prejudicial to the security of the state.''
   At least six foreign journalists were expelled from Srinagar
last weekend after receiving similar letters.
   The administration prepared for another possible showdown with
the militants on Friday, the Moslem sabbath. New road blocks were
erected in Srinagar on Thursday, and the deployment of troops
increased.
   In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, the Organization of Islamic Conference
condemned the intervention of Indian police in Kashmir. The
46-member group that is an official forum for the world's
predominantly Moslem nations, called on the Indian government to
end what it said were repressive acts against Moslems.
   The Moslem movement for independence of Kashmir dates to 1947
but flared in recent months, bolstered by charges that Abdullah was
incompetent and corrupt. Militants angered by his rule and what
they called subservience to New Delhi threatened to kill him.
   Abdullah resigned in protest a day after the federal government
appointed Jagmohan, a Hindu with only one name, as state governor.
Jagmohan then assumed the administrative powers that revert to the
governor in the absence of an elected state government and ordered
a crackdown on the militant movement.
   Meanwhile, the government said it will release 10,000 copies of
this week's edition of Newsweek magazine after taking ``corrective
action,'' United News of India reported.
   The news agency said a map of Kashmir that appears in the
current issue would be stamped ``Incorrect,'' because it depicts
large parts of the state in Pakistan.
   Indian-held Kashmir is now part of Jammu-Kashmir state, the only
Indian state with a Moslem majority. At least 64 percent of the
state's 5 million people are Moslems. Nationwide, Moslems form 12
percent of the country's 880 million people, and Hindus 80 percent.

   A former military communications officer
accepted a plea bargain with the government Thursday on charges he
passed secret information to the Soviet Union.
   Frank Nesbitt pled guilty to an espionage charge, reversing an
earlier plea that could have sent him to jail for life if
convicted. The new agreement means a maximum prison term of 10
years.
   ``Did you do it?'' U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis asked Nesbitt,
45.
   ``Yes, sir,'' Nesbitt said calmly.
   The judge set sentencing for March 16. The agreement does not
entitle Nesbitt to parole. He also could be fined up to $250,000.
   According to earlier testimony by the government, Nesbitt went
to the FBI last October to tell of an odyssey that led him through
Central and South America and on to the Soviet Union and back.
   His attorney claimed Nesbitt simply wanted ``some excitement in
his life.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Hulkower said Nesbitt passed on
information to the Soviets later determined by the National
Security Agency to be classified. He was indicted in November on
espionage charges.
   Nesbitt testified Thursday that he did not realize that the
material was classified.
   ``It was my true and honest effort not to do that,'' he
responded to the judge's questions.
   FBI Special Agent Lizzie Cassell testified in October that
Nesbitt left his wife and two children in Millington, Tenn., last
June. He left behind a note saying: ``Don't look for me. I'm gone.''
   Nesbitt said Thursday he decided to go to the Soviet Union
during his travels in Bolivia last year. In the Soviet Union he was
kept in a safe house for a few days until he failed a lie detector
test. The Soviet KGB agents broke off the contacts, he said.
   He said he had agreed to cooperate with the Soviets after they
showed him a picture of his two children taken outside his
Tennessee home.
   Nesbitt said two Soviet agents followed him back to the United
States. He later went to the FBI. Ms. Cassell said Nesbitt, who was
not charged at the time, ended the questioning. A few days later he
was arrested at a Virginia hotel.
   Nesbitt served from 1963 to 1966 in the Air Force's Electronic
Security Command in West Germany and from 1969 to 1979 in the
Marine Corps, where he dealt with classified communications
gathering. He also worked at the Los Alamos National Laboratories
from 1983 to 1984. In all his jobs he maintained a top secret code
word clearance.
   His attorney, David Hopkins, responded to a reporter's question
about why Nesbitt accepted the guilty plea by saying: ``A
recognition of the strength of the government's case. This is 10
years, the other is life. It's enough to give anyone pause.''

<HEAD>Treasury Secretary Hails Third World Debt Strategy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on Thursday
said he was satisfied with the achievements of the administration's
much-criticized Third World debt strategy and predicted more
success in the coming year.
   Brady said that the first agreement, with Mexico, would be
signed this Sunday and he predicted that another agreement would be
finalized by mid-month with the Philippines.
   He said that an agreement with Costa Rica was expected before
the end of March and that later in the year debt reduction packages
could be reached with two of the Third World's largest debtors,
Venezuela and Brazil.
   ``I am very pleased with the progress that we have made in the
attempts to alleviate Third World debt,'' Brady said in answer to a
question before the Senate Budget Committee. ``I think a pattern is
beginning to emerge whereby we can deal with these problems.''
   The administration's debt strategy, often referred to as the
Brady debt plan, was unveiled by the Treasury secretary in March
1989. It had an initial goal of cutting the commercial bank debt of
39 countries, chiefly in Latin America, by 20 percent.
   The plan envisioned using incentives supplied by the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to entice commercial
banks to voluntarily forgive a portion of their old debt in
exchange for guarantees that the reduced debt would be repaid.
   Critics, however, said the deal with Mexico, considered a test
case for the Brady plan, produced debt relief far below what had
been hoped and that other countries were even further from reaching
agreements with commercial banks.
   But Brady said the debt plan, while setting ``enormous goals,''
had been working well in producing a variety of debt reduction
packages that will soon be signed.
   ``Starting from scratch this past year, we now have some of the
machinery down, working rather smoothly so that we don't have to
re-invent the wheel every time we do one of these transactions,''
he said.
   On another topic, Brady acknowledged that the administration's
proposal to cut the tax on corporate profits envisoned that the
measure would be enacted by March 1, 1990, a goal that Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., called totally
unrealistic.
   If it does not go into effect until later in the year, it will
reduce by a significant amount the $4.9 billion in revenues the
administration is anticipating receiving from persons selling off
their assets to take advantage of the lower tax rate. The $4.9
billion represents the biggest revenue measure in the
administration's 1991 budget, which was unveiled on Monday.
   Sasser said that enactment of the capital gains cut would not
come before September or October at the earliest.
   Brady said that a delay in enacting the proposal would cut into
the revenues the administration is counting on to reduce the budget
deficit and ``we will have to figure out a way to make up the

   Brady refused to answer a reporter's question after the hearing
about where the administration might look to make up the lost

   Asked by reporters about repeated rumors that he is considering
resigning, Brady termed such reports ``absolutely untrue'' and
compared the rumors to recent resignation rumors involving Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   ``I am delighted to be included in the same category as General
Secretary Gorbachev,'' Brady said.

<HEAD>Police: Parents Killed Son for Insurance Money</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COCONUT CREEK, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents who allegedly plotted with
their son to kill his ex-wife for insurance money later turned on
their offspring, helping shoot and kill him for a $70,000 policy,
authorities said Thursday.
   The father taped the son's hands and drove him to his death, and
the mother followed behind in a getaway car, said Broward Sheriff's
Office spokesman George Crolius.
   The father, Theron Morris, 76; the mother, Leila Mary Morris,
62; and the victim's roommate, Martin Wayne Rector, 34, were all in
the Broward County Jail on Thursday charged with first-degree
murder.
   The body of Christopher Morris, 42, was discovered in his car
Jan. 9, Crolius said.
   ``Homicide detectives determined that the victim had developed a
plan to murder his ex-wife and 10-year-old daughter for $35,000 in
insurance,'' Crolius said. Rector was to do the killing, with the
proceeds divided among him and the Morris family, authorities said.
   ``But when it was learned that the insurance policy had lapsed,
the parents and Rector then devised a plan to murder Chris Morris
for a $70,000 policy on his life,'' the spokesman said.
   Rector was arrested Wednesday, and he implicated the parents,
the spokesman said.

<HEAD>Sudan Says It Takes Two Towns from Rebels; Mercy Flight Thwarted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Thursday its forces
recaptured two southern towns _ Yei and Lanya _ lost to rebels of
the Sudan People's Liberation Army in a recent, violent step-up of
the civil war.
   No word on the claim came from the rebels, who have reported
seizing 12 towns in the south the last few months.
   The armed forces general command also announced its troops
killed 95 rebels in an attack on a base in the Upper Nile region,
north of Equatoria. Its communique said seven soldiers died in the
``intensive and successful mop-up operation,'' but gave no date.
   In Nairobi, capital of adjacent Kenya, relief workers said
Sudanese air traffic controllers denied landing permission Thursday
to an plane ferrying emergency food to Juba, the beleaguered
capital of the Equatoria regional that is 750 miles south of
Khartoum.
   ``It seems the civil aviation people in Khartoum didn't get
details of the aircraft,'' said Bob Koepp of the Lutheran World
Federation. ``We got permission and everything.''
   Koepp said the Hercules C-130 returned to Nairobi in the morning
with its cargo of 15 tons of corn donated by the Italian government.
   ``We are at them and hope to fly tomorrow,'' said Koepp, whose
Nairobi office is responsible for the Lutheran group's activities
in southern Sudan.
   Koepp said that a Boeing 707 leased by the Lutherans from Sudan
Airways was permitted to deliver 30 tons of corn to Juba Thursday.
   The army command announced recovery of Yei, lost to the rebels
in December, in a statement published by the military's newspaper,
Al-Kuwat Al-Musallaha.
   It did not say when the army recaptured Yei, 80 miles southeast
of Juba. The report said the rebels suffered heavy casualties, but
gave no figures.
   Mop-up operations cleared the areas around Yei, it said.
   The official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) quoted military officials
as saying government troops on Wednesday recaptured Lanya after ``a
fierce battle.''
   Lanya, about 30 miles southwest of Juba on the road linking that
city with Yei, had fallen to the rebels last month.
   The officials were quoted as saying ``great numbers of rebels
were killed or wounded'' and that eight soldiers died.
   Large quantities of arms and equipment were seized, including a
Soviet-made T-55 tank and launchers for rocket-propelled grenades,
they said.
   SUNA quoted an official as saying seizure of the tank ``proves
the interference of a neighboring country alongside the rebels in
the fighting in both eastern and western Equatoria.''
   He did not identify the country but was believed referring to
Marxist-ruled Ethiopia, frequently accused by Sudan of aiding the
rebels.
   The Sudan People's Liberation Army has been fighting since early
1983 against the Moslem-dominated Khartoum government for
administrative and economic reforms in the south, inhabited mostly
by Christians and animists.
   Recent evacuees say that Juba's estimated 300,000 residents are
prevented by armed soldiers from leaving.
   Juba, on the west bank of the White Nile river, is ringed with
land mines planted by both soldiers and rebels.
   The rebels have subjected Juba to sporadic artillery bombardment
and have virtually cut all land routes to the city.
   Koepp said his organization has 2,500 tons of Italian-donated
corn awaiting delivery to Juba and expects to receive additional
food from other donors soon.
   Only the Lutherans have delivered non-Sudanese government food
supplies to Juba since Khartoum banned relief flights Nov. 3 after
an informal cease-fire with the rebels broke down.
   Lam Akol, a Liberation Army spokesman, said on Wednesday in
Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, that relief flights ``fly at their own
risk.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposal for deeper troop cuts in
Central Europe was a step in the right direction but did not go far
enough, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said Thursday.
   In a surprise overture, Bush proposed in his State of the Union
message Wednesday a cut in military manpower in Europe to 195,000
troops on each side. The previous U.S. bargaining position at
conventional force negotiations in Vienna was 275,000 on each side.
   ``It's a good sign that things are changing for the better,''
Gerasimov said in the regular news briefing. ``Some observers note
that the events in Europe run ahead of the slow diplomatic
negotiations.''
   Gerasimov also complained that Bush seemed to take credit for
the ``revolution of 1989,'' as the American president called the
democratic reforms that have occurred in much of Eastern Europe
since last summer.
   He said attempts to show these events as a triumph of U.S.
ideals and a failure of communism ``are a relic of the Cold War.''
He added that the U.S. invasion of Panama last December was also
proof of this attitude.
   Gerasimov criticized the Bush proposal for not going further.
``You can note in his speech that he needs American troops in
Europe from here to eternity _ 125,000 or about this figure. This
is not a good sign.''
   ``We, together with Les Aspin (chairman of the U.S. House Armed
Services Committee), feel it must be the ceiling, not the floor,''
Gerasimov said.
   Bush said in his speech that he and America's European allies
agree ``that an American military presence in Europe is essential
and that it should not be tied solely to the Soviet military
presence in Eastern Europe.''
   Gerasimov also complained that the proposal applies only to
troops in Central Europe and would leave the United States with
30,000 or more servicemen in England, Greece and other countries in
Europe.
   ``So it comes out that the U.S. is to have 235,000 troops,''
Gerasimov said. This will have to be considered at the conventional
arms talks in Vienna, Austria, he said.

   A former Agency for Internatiional Development
official pleaded guilty Thursday to illegally receiving $80,000
from a laboratory that received malaria research grants from the
agency.
   James M. Erickson, 42, who was head of AID's communicable
disease division and manager of the malaria research project, faces
a possible 10 years imprisonment on his guilty pleas to three
felony charges, the Justice Department said.
   Erickson pleaded guilty to one count of making a false
statement, a count of receiving illegal gratuities and a charge of
filing a false tax return, the department said.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton of Alexandria, Va.,
scheduled sentencing for April 6.
   Erickson, who agreed to cooperate with the continuing
investigation, admitted receiving $88,000 in payments from KT&amp;R
Laboratories of Stillwater, Minn., which received research grants
from the malaria program, the department said.
   Erickson also admitted accepting unlawful gratuities totaling
more than $20,000 from the sale of monkeys used in malaria research.
   The false statement conviction stemmed from Erickson's admission
that he failed to disclose his financial interest in a company
called IIR&amp;D-Guatamala, which was set up to receive the payments
from KT&amp;R, the department said.
   He also admitted failing to declare $68,000 in income on his
1986 income tax return.

<HEAD>Air Force Announces Civilian Drug Testing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has specified some 24,000
civilian workers holding sensitive jobs as eligible for random drug
testing and expects to begin the tests by the end of the month, the
Pentagon announced Thursday.
   ``We're looking at testing approximately 6,000 employees per
year,'' said an Air Force spokesman, Maj. Lou Figueroa.
   Employees who test positive will not be allowed to remain in
their jobs and will be referred to a substance-abuse counseling
program. They will also be subject to ``appropriate disciplinary
action,'' which could include a written reprimand, suspension or
firing, a Pentagon statement said.
   The program is designed ``to ensure employees refrain from using
illegal drugs on or off duty,'' and also will include applicants
for the posts deemed to be sensitive, the Pentagon statement said.
   All of the tests will screen for marijuana or cocaine use. Tests
for amphetamines, opiates and PCP can be ordered, the spokesman
said.
   The Air Force has some 566,000 military personnel and 260,000
civilian employees. All active-duty military personnel have been
subject to random drug tests since 1981.
   The Air Force has begun bargaining with the affected labor
unions on the matter, the statement said.
   The program is designed to affect those civlians occupying or
applying for positions that directly relate to ``the public health
and safety, the protection of life and property, law enforcement
and national security,'' the statement said.
   Example of those positions include firefighters, police, medical
personnel, criminal investigators, air traffic controllers,
aircraft mechanics, employees associated with nuclear weapons or
those with access to sensitive national security information, the
statement said.
   All other civilians could be subject to testing if there is a
``reasonable suspicion'' of illegal drug use, or following
accidents, safety mishaps or as a follow-up to a rehabilitation
program for illegal drug use.
   Figueroa said such a suspicion could be based upon such things
as the direct observation of drug use or possession by an employee,
abnormal conduct or erratic behavior, or arrest or conviction of a
drug-related offense.
   The Army has been testing its civilian workforce since 1986, but
the Navy isn't conducting random tests of its civilian employees
because of a lawsuit.
   Pentagon spokesman William Caldwell said civilians in the Office
of Secretary of Defense have been randomly tested for drugs since
April 1989.

<HEAD>Bush Withdraws Silverman Nomination After Critics Hit No-Job
Portfolio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has withdrawn the nomination of
GOP fund-raiser Joy Silverman as ambassador to Barbados in the face
of complaints from Capitol Hill that she lacked qualifications.
   Instead, Bush named Mrs. Silverman to the board of trustees of
the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
   Mrs. Silverman, a New Yorker, was one of several Bush
ambassadorial appointees who critics said were being rewarded for
her contribution to Bush's political campaign. She had no job
history.
   Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., last year produced a list of $300,000
worth of political contributions by Mrs. Silverman, her husband,
Jeffery Silverman and her husband's wood products company, Playgem,
to Republican campaigns.
   Federal Election Commission records show she gave $100,000 to
the Republican National Committee in 1988.
   Ambassadorial appointments require Senate confirmation. The
Kennedy Center post does not.
   Officially, the White House said that Mrs. Silverman asked that
her name be withdrawn ``for family reasons.''
   ``The president remains fully confident in Mrs. Silverman and
her capacity for pulic service, and is pleased she has agreed to
devote her considerble energy to the Kennedy Center,'' the White
House said in a statement.
   After the Senate sent Mrs. Silverman's nomination back to Bush
last year, the White House did not resubmit it for another fight
this year.
   She worked full time on Bush's campaign in New York, and was a
member of the Advisory Councl to the New York state Commission on
Bicentennial of the United States Constitution in 1987-88.
   She also was a member of the New York City Mayor's Commission
for Protocol.
   The Barbados ambassador is accredited also to Dominica, Saint
Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

<HEAD>Most VMI Cadets Seek To Remain A Breed Apart</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID REED</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LEXINGTON, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government wants Virginia
Military Institute to admit women, but some cadets said Thursday
that would destroy a proud 150-year tradition of discipline and
unity among the student body.
   ``I kind of felt all along it would be inevitable, hoping that
it wouldn't,'' said Tony Marro, 20, of Ilion, N.Y.
   The U.S. Justice Department announced Wednesday it would bring a
sex discrimination lawsuit against VMI if the college _ part of the
state university system _ doesn't agree by Feb. 20 to admit women.
   But state Attorney General Mary Sue Terry has said she would
defend the school if it continues to turn away women.
   ``There are viable defenses to VMI's admission policy,'' said
Bert Rohrer, a Terry spokesman. ``If they chose to continue the
policy, she would defend it.''
   The Justice Department said its investigation concluded the
policy violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 14th Amendment
to the Constitution, which guarantees every citizen equal
protection under the law.
   The investigation was prompted by a written complaint in March
from a female high school student who wanted to attend the college,
known for the military-style discipline of its uniformed
``cadets,'' though it isn't part of the military.
   Gov. L. Douglas Wilder refused to say whether he supports
admitting women to VMI.
   ``The ultimate responsibility as to what takes place rests with
the board of visitors,'' Wilder said, referring to the school's
appointed governing body.
   The VMI board of visitors' next scheduled meeting is March
29-31, well after the Justice Department deadline, said Tom Joynes,
the school's public affairs officer. No special meeting has been
scheduled, Joynes said.
   VMI officials said it would be inappropriate to comment about
the federal government's action and referred all questions to
Terry's office.
   The school reaffirmed its single-sex policy in 1986 and told the
Justice Department in April that coeducation would undermine its
mission. But most cadets oppose the admission of women, said
Benjamin Dorman, a 20-year-old cadet.
   ``The system functions better with men only. To allow women
would cause too many changes,'' he said. ``I don't think they could
cut it, physically.''
   But Dorman, like many of the other cadets, believe the campus
will soon be coeducational.
   ``I just got clobbered by my roommates for saying what I
think,'' said Jim Blankenship, a 19-year-old sophomore from
Roanoke. ``I think women should come.''
   But another cadet overheard the comment and yelled as he walked
away, ``Maybe I should buy you a skirt, Blankenship.''
   The 1,200-student college in Virginia's western mountains, which
offers bachelor's degrees and is known for its engineering program,
is one of just two state-supported all-male military schools left
in the country. The other is the Citadel in South Carolina.
   As at military prep schools, cadets wear military-style
uniforms, and many join the service after graduation. The schools,
supporters say, instill discipline, pride and self-reliance, and
forge bonds among the cadets.
   All of VMI's cadets live in a three-story dormitory in spartan
rooms with standard cots, shelves and desks. They wake to reveille
and the freshmen, called ``rats'' by upperclassmen, have to keep
their heads shaved and be ready at any time for inspections.
   Marro said the unity would suffer if women are admitted.
   ``The whole system takes place in the barracks,'' he said. ``The
thing with rats coming together as a class, I think that would be
affected. If they build a separate barracks for women it will be
hard to maintain unity.''
   Meantime, state Sen. Emilie F. Miller has introduced a bill in
the General Assembly that would force VMI to admit women.
   ``I would hope that the state would not go to court, that we
would do the right thing,'' she said.
   But Sen. Elmon T. Gray, D-Waverly and a VMI graduate, said the
state should fight the Justice Department. ``I've never felt VMI is
in violation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Oilseed Farmers Losing Market Share; Want In Farm Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration will give Congress
some guidelines for writing the 1990 farm bill, including ideas for
stimulating oilseed production, but won't introduce legislation of
its own, a Senate committee was told Thursday.
   Foreign competition and restrictions in the American farm
program that discourage crop rotation have caused declines in U.S.
production of soybeans and sunflowers, according to industry
experts and commodity groups.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter will spell out the
administration's proposals in an appearance before the Senate
Agriculture Committee next week, said Assistant Secretary Bruce
Gardner.
   Bush's proposed 1991 budget called for cutting spending on farm
commodity programs by $1.5 billion, but the administration didn't
suggest how the reductions would be made.
   Gardner refused to divulge any of the administration's ideas in
advance Thursday, despite complaints from Democratic members of an
Agriculture Committee subcommittee on production and price
stabilization who questioned the president's interest in farm
policy.
   ``You are going to have a lot to work off of,'' said Gardner,
who contended Bush ``is interested in farm policy as much as any
other president has been.''
   Most recent presidents have introduced their own farm bills,
said Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., who noted that Bush mentioned the
issue only in passing during Wednesday's State of the Union address.
   The administration believes the 1990 farm bill should give
farmers more flexibility to rotate crops from year to year, which
could encourage producers to plant more soybeans, sunflowers and
canola rather than program crops like corn, said Gardner.
   ``The key word there is flexibility, but the question is how to
achieve it,'' Gardner said.
   Restrictions in the 1985 farm bill discourage farmers from
planting non-program crops, while at the same time lower production
costs in South America and heavy European subsidies have combined
to cut into the U.S. share of the world oilseed market, industry
experts told the committee.
   ``World trade has leveled off since 1980 causing a 19 percent
decline in U.S. soybean acreage while soybean acreage inother areas
of the world, especially South America's acreage, has increased,''
said Purdue University economist J. William Uhrig.

   The recent surge in heating oil prices and
record cold makes this the wrong time for the Bush administration
to seek a 25 percent reduction in a program to help the poor pay
heating bills, state officials told Congress on Thursday.
   Even the current appropriation of $1.39 billion for the 1990
fiscal year is barely adequate to meet the needs of the Low Income
Home Energy Assistance Program, state regulators and community
activists told a House Education and Labor subcommittee hearing.
   President Bush proposed as part of his fiscal 1991 budget on
Monday that the Department of Health of Human Services make a $350
million cut in the aid plan, which served 5.9 million households
last year. Administration officials said the energy ``crisis'' that
spawned the program no longer existed.
   The aid program began in the wake of rapid increase in energy
costs in the late 1970s, and after reports of the deaths of an
elderly Syracuse, N.Y., couple who froze to death in an unheated
house.
   The program provides funds to states for heating and cooling
assistance, and weatherization.
   Lynda Crandall of the Michigan Department of Social Services
told the subcommittee on human resources that high energy costs
were largely a responsibility of the federal government. She said
new program cuts ``will increase homelessness and otherwise
threaten the health and safety of low income citizens.
   ``While Michigan stands ready to contribute its fair share, the
federal government must take the lead in solving the low income
energy assistance problem which results from national economic and
energy policy,'' she said.
   In Pennsylvania, community activist Janet Parrish said the
December cold snap and temporary jump in home heating oil prices _
as high as $1.62 per gallon _ worsened backlogs in processing aid
applications. Already, Pennsylvania and other states have struggled
to compensate for previous program cuts by using state oil
overcharge funds.
   ``Congress needs to take a stand on behalf of the needy,'' said
Dick Sievers, executive director of Mid-Sioux Opportunity Inc., a
community action group in Remsen, Iowa.
   Eunice Thomas, acting assistant secretary at the Family Support
Administration of HHS, said home energy costs did not fluctuate as
often in the 1980s as in the 1970s, and ``the national crisis has
long passed.''
   When temporary price increases occur as in December, she said
the problems were generally confined to a specific area or fuel and
could be dealt with at the state level.

   Trainloads of Serbs fled Kosovo
province as protests by ethnic Albanians resulted in three more
deaths Thursday, the official news agency Tanjug reported. The
nine-day toll now stands at 21.
   Soviet-made T-54 and T-72 tanks patrolled streets and air force
jets and helicopters filled the skies as demonstrators gathered at
noon in towns across Kosovo, an impoverished region adjacent to
Albania where 90 percent of the 1.9 million people are ethnic
Albanians.
   Two deaths occurred in Podujevo, 20 miles north of the
provincial capital of Pristina, during a five-hour demonstration,
Tanjug said.
   The protesters were killed as demonstrators attacked a column of
military and police vehicles, the Belgrade daily Borba reported in
Friday editions.
   The third death Thursday occurred in Magura, a village near
Lipljan, 11 miles south of Pristina, Tanjug said without giving
particulars.
   An Associated Press reporter saw columns of army tanks and
armored personnel carriers approaching from the direction of the
the Serbian republic, of which Kosovo is an autonomous province.
Military jets flew overhead.
   Tanjug said about 700 Serbs were evacuated Thursday, including
400 children.
   Tanks also were deployed in February and March 1989, during a
spasm of ethnic violence connected with constitutional changes made
by Serbia in an attempt to gain greater control over Kosovo.
Twenty-eight people were reported killed last year.
   Two shifts of miners refused to enter pits Thursday at the Stari
Trg mine at Trepca near Titova Mitrovica, 25 miles north of
Pristina, as a gesture of homage to dead protesters, Tanjug
reported. The agency said they also signed a human rights
declaration.
   Last year's ethnic strife began with a sit-in at the mine in
February.
   During the miners' protest, police fired tear gas to prevent
about 2,000 ethnic Albanians massed at the outskirts of Titova
Mitrovica from entering the city, the news agency reported.
   Before the latest deaths were announced, the provincial
government said 18 ethnic Albanians had been killed since the
violence began Jan. 24. It said 54 ethnic Albanians and 45
policemen had been injured.
   Ethnic Albanians want more autonomy, a halt to political trials,
release of political prisoners and an end to the year-old state of
emergency. Official media have described the region as verging on
civil war.
   Yugoslavia's central government said Thursday the situation is
``further deteriorating,'' and the official news agency Tanjug
called it ``dramatic.''
   The government also said a ``dialogue should be opened with
democratic forces in Kosovo.''
   Leaders of independent groups in Kosovo issued a statement
Thursday urging federal authorities to negotiate with ethnic
Albanians in order to avoid a full-scale uprising.
   ``Ethnic Albanians are not terrorists,'' the statement said.
``They are subjected to terror by the state.''
   Violence in Kosovo has caused a backlash in some other parts of
Yugoslavia, a loose federation of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, including demands by Slavs for weapons so they can fight
in Kosovo for the Slavic minority.
   Thousands of Serbs held anti-Albanian demonstrations in their
republic Thursday, including about 5,000 in Novi Sad, 30 miles
north of Belgrade, capital of both Yugoslavia and Serbia.
   As many as 100,000 Slavs, some firing guns into the air, rallied
on Wednesday in Titograd, capital of Montenegro. Some demanded
weapons and volunteered to fight ethnic ``Albanian nationalists''
in neighboring Kosovo.
   Thousands of Serbs demonstrated in Belgrade on Wednesday,
chanting ``We'll walk over Albanians!'' and ``We'll Burn Mosques!''
Islam is the predominant religion of ethnic Albanians and Kosovo is
a former heartland of Christian Serbia.
   Police moved in with truncheons when the crowd in Belgrade began
shouting ``Down With Communists!'' Several demonstrators were
injured and at least 20 arrests were reported.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with five grafs to UPDATE with first gov't to resign
since 1947, details. Picks up 4th, `Atanassov's departure...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Georgi Atanassov, a holdover from
the era of disgraced leader Todor Zhivkov, resigned along with his
22-member Communist-controlled Cabinet, Bulgarian state radio said
late Thursday.
   The resignation was the first by a government since 1947, when
the Communist Party consolidated power in postwar Bulgaria,
according to the state news agency BTA.
   The government has been under severe pressure to resolve
Bulgaria's labor strife and other economic ills. Their departure
clears the way for creation of an interim government to run
Bulgaria until elections this year. The Communists have proposed
such a government to share power with the opposition.
   The state news agency said the resignations became known
Thursday night during an emergency, closed-door Communist Party
congress. The government will continue to serve until parliament
accepts its resignation, the agency said. No date was given.
   ``The motive adduced for the resignation is the necessity to
form a cabinet on a broad national basis,'' BTA said.
   Atanassov's departure was earlier reported by an official
source, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Delegates to the party congress remained in session and were
expected to continue meeting into Friday.
   On Thursday, they approved moderate reforms before starting the
secret session to elect the party leadership.
   Also, a reform faction of the Communist Party decided it would
split off and form a new socialist party, a spokesman said.
   Atanassov, the No. 2 man in the government after President Petar
Mladenov, had come under fire for failing to curb unprecedented
labor unrest. His resignation was widely expected because of
several personal attacks on him during an emergency Communist Party
conference currently under way.
   At the congress Thursday, delegates adopted a new party platform
that confirmed the relinquishment of the Communists' monopoly on
power, as approved by Parliament last month.
   Delegates also accepted Mladenov's proposal to separate the
party leader's position from the presidency. Mladenov currently
holds both positions and is expected to retain the presidency.
   The changes were not enough to keep the party together. A
reform-minded faction announced Thursday it had given up trying to
change the conservative party from within and would form its own
socialist party.
   The creation of the Bulgarian Socialist Party will be formalized
at a special congress in Sofia on Feb. 11, said spokesman Nikolai
Vassilev.
   It was not clear when a new Cabinet would be created, but it
presumably will run the government at least until elections that
are expected as early as May.
   Mladenov and other Communists have spoken vaguely of creating a
government of ``national concord,'' but they have not been specific
on what powers they might be willing to give up.
   The opposition Union of Democratic Forces has said the
composition of such a government must be clarified before they
agree to participate.
   Opposition spokesman Petar Beron reiterated that Thursday, but
his comments were made before the report of the Cabinet's
resignation.
   Atanassov, a member of the Communist Party policy-making
Politburo, became premier in March 1986. He survived the Nov. 10
ouster of Communist Party head Tudor Zhivkov, apparently because he
sided with the Politburo colleagues who engineered the end of the
authoritarian leader's 35 years in power.
   Despite Zhivkov's ouster, Bulgaria's Communists have given up
relatively little power, compared with their comrades elsewhere in
Eastern Europe. The party is bolstered by roots in a century of the
nation's politics and relatively weak opposition.
   However, Atanassov was not able to escape the shadow of Zhivkov,
now under arrest on criminal charges, or effectively deal with
economic problems that have led to widespread strikes.
   In general, Bulgaria is suffering the same problems as other
East bloc countries with centrally planned economies. The foreign
debt is estimated at $11 billion, and there have been allegations
by the opposition of mismanagement of Western credits.
   Vassilev, the leader of the reform faction, said he had expected
a party split even before the congress began Tuesday.
   A similar split occurred this week in Poland, when reformers
broke away from the main Communist Party at a congress that
concluded Monday.
   Vassilev, a Sofia University philosophy and anthropology
professor, said his new party will be socially oriented. He
predicted that within three months, about 150,000 of the 980,000
Communist Party members in Bulgaria will join it.
   But the leader of another reform wing in the party, economist
Alexander Tomov of the Movement for Democratic Socialism, was not
optimistic about the prospects for a breakaway party.
   ``Even if the Atlernative Socialist Alliance splits away, I am
almost certain that they will not win, not only because they have
organizational problems but because their basis is a quick
political and not an economic reform,'' he said.

<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS 4th graf: ``The State,'' to explain difference
between Cheney's 225,000 figure and the 195,000 figure used by Bush</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is likely to pull all its
troops from Europe by 1995, but the Western allies must remain wary
of ``the only nation on Earth capable of destroying the United
States,'' Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told Congress on Thursday.
   Cheney said President Bush's new proposal that Moscow and
Washington seek agreement on deeper troop cuts in Europe than
previously contemplated would ``preserve ... a viable, useful''
American military presence on the continent.
   Bush in his State of the Union speech Wednesday proposed
reducing U.S. and Soviet combat forces in Europe to no more than
225,000 for each side _ a drop of 50,000 from the previous U.S.
proposal at East-West troop reduction talks now under way in Vienna.
   The State of the Union address spoke of a U.S. troop ceiling of
195,000, but that number would apply to NATO's ``central front,''
basically Germany. The 225,000 ceiling would be for all Europe,
including U.S. forces in Turkey, Greece, Italy, Spain and Britain.
   Bush said that with ``communism crumbling'' in Eastern Europe,
the time had come to swiftly conclude agreements limiting
conventional, strategic and chemical weapons.
   In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Cheney
said ``caution is still in order'' in considering relaxing U.S.
defenses, even though Moscow is reducing its military spending and
is unlikely to initiate an attack on NATO territory.
   ``The Soviet Union remains the only nation on Earth capable of
destroying the United States,'' Cheney said, adding that even if
all Soviet troops leave Eastern Europe, Moscow would retain its
geographic advantage in the event of a European crisis.
   He said it was important not to drop below a certain troop level
in Europe.
   Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on the
committee, sought and received an assurance from Cheney that the
adminstration would not consider going beyond Bush's latest
troop-cut proposal in the foreseeable future.
   ``This is the worst possible time to contemplate changes in
strategy,'' Warner said.
   Cheney estimated that the 225,000 U.S. troop level in Europe
could be achieved ``within a year or two certainly'' after an
agreement is ratified. But he said the troops would be sent
elsewhere and not removed from military service.
   However, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., pressed Cheney as to why the
Bush administration would wait for an arms control agreement before
reducing U.S. troops in light of moves by American allies to cut
their forces and pressures in the Eastern bloc for the Soviets to
leave.
   ``They're going to get out of Eastern Europe whether they like
it or not without any agreement with the United States,'' Dixon
said. ``They're going to kick them out. And we're waiting here to
do things until we have the agreement.
   ``I'm not saying strip until we're naked. I'm saying do sensible
things now here in our country even without agreements,'' Dixon
said.
   Cheney said the administration is not oblivious to the need to
reduce U.S. forces overseas, and has plans to end U.S. operations
at several foreign bases.
   But to ensure the NATO alliance and a peaceful process, ``we
should not unilaterally bring them home until we've got an
agreement,'' Cheney said.
   At the White House, Chief of Staff John Sununu said Bush's new
troop-cut proposal was not intended to prop up a politically
weakened Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev as he faces a critical
meeting next week of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   ``If the cutting of troops would have been an advantage for Mr.
Gorbachev, then Mr. Gorbachev would probably have announced them
earlier himself, thereby getting both the advantage, the pressuring
of the United States to do it and whatever international political
benefits that come in that direction,'' Sununu said. ``So that was
not part of the consideration.''
   While acknowledging dramatic changes in the political landscape
of Eastern Europe, Cheney said the Soviets are continuing to
modernize their strategic nuclear arsenal and will be more capable
in the 1990s to adapt new technolgies to weapons systems.
   Cheney said the Pentagon would present to Congress within a few
months a revamped five-year plan for troop levels, deployments,
weapons requirements and other strategic issues in light of the
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe.
   Among the assumptions used in this planning, he said, is that
``the Soviets will be out of Eastern Europe or virtually out of
Eastern Europe five years hence, that the governments of Eastern
Europe will be democratically elected, non-communist regimes.'' He
called this ``a very real possibility.''
   Remarks to the committee by Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared aimed largely at
heading off any political momentum toward an immediate, radical
reduction in U.S. military capabilities.
   ``We must not shatter the armed forces,'' Powell said. ``We must
not make them a shadow of strength.''
   Powell said the Pentagon's latest assessment of the overall
Soviet threat to U.S. security was based on acknowledgement of a
``a dramatic diminution'' in the possibility of East-West conflict
but also an unsettling uncertainty about the future.
   ``It is still too soon to make sweeping changes to strategy,
force structure and posture, and modernization,'' he said. ``There
is simply too much risk in such precipitous change.''
   Powell also said he would ``stand like a stone wall'' against
any pressure for a total pullout of U.S. combat forces from Europe,
even if all Soviet forces withdrew.
   ``While we will reduce the number of our forces in Europe, there
is nothing whatsoever on the horizon that indicates to me that we
can disengage from the continent entirely,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The House Interior Committee chairman, Rep.
Morris Udall, praised Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. on
Thursday for reversing several Reagan administration policies on
mining coal from federal lands. Critics have said the Reagan
policies favored private interests over the environment.
   ``It appears to me that in this area there is a much greater
concern and responsiveness to the public interest, a more open
attitude and a more balanced approach to environmental and
conservation issues than has been evident in the previous
Republican administration,'' Udall, an Arizona Democrat, said in a
letter to Lujan.
   Udall, a tenacious protector of public lands who is in his 13th
year as chairman of the Interior Committee, was consistently at
odds with interior secretaries James Watt and Donald Hodel, who
served under Reagan.
   Lujan served on the Interior Committee while in Congress and was
ranking Republican on the Interior committee for several years.
   ``We sat side by side for a good number of years,'' Udall
commented Thursday. ``We both know we'll disagree again along the
way, but when an old friend is doing a good job, I feel moved to
tell him.''
   ``We have been plugging along for 12 months trying to get people
to notice that things are different at Interior and there is an
environmental tilt,'' said Steve Goldstein, chief spokesman for
Lujan. ``This is beyond what we expected.''
   Goldstein said that when Lujan reviewed some of the Reagan
policies, he decided they did not fit into the ``new environmental
ethic'' he and Bush wanted for the department.
   ``Lujan is doing a pretty good job,'' agreed Skip Deegans,
coordinator of the surface mining project at the National Wildlife
Federation.
   But he said, ``You have to put it in perspective. Under Reagan
they had an agenda to decimate the surface mine regulations.''
   ``A lot of it is that they are waking up to the political
realities that the public is interested in having the environment
protected,'' said Deegans. ``The situation on coal issues was so
antagonistic during the Reagan administration that nothing was
getting done. We were constantly in litigation with the Office of
Surface Mining.''
   Udall, who sponsored the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation
Act, cited five areas for praise:
   _Improvements in the computerized system designed to prevent
violators of the act from obtaining additional mining permits. The
Reagan administration was put under court order to make
improvements, but never did, said Deegans.
   _Abolishing a Reagan administration proposal to reduce the
royalty rate paid the government on underground coal. It would have
saved the coal industry money but cost the taxpayers.
   _Reversal of a Reagan administration decision that eliminated
certain fees from the royalty base rate paid on coal. That had cost
taxpayers about $70 million, said Udall.
   _Disapproval of a proposed amendment to a Wyoming regulatory
program that would have relieved coal companies of having to return
surface-mined lands to their original contours.
   _Action to stop mining companies from abusing the law that
allows coal to be taken at a cheaper rate if it the company happens
to mine it when looking for another mineral in the vicinity.
Companies were pretending to be mining principally for cheaper
minerals in order to get coal, said Udall.

<TEXT>
   New York Stock Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan
Jr. announced his retirement Thursday, capping a tumultuous
seven-year tenure in which the nation's biggest securities market
grew explosively, suffered a devastating crash and struggled to
recover.
   Phelan announced the departure, effective at the end of this
year, at a news conference in the NYSE's Wall Street headquarters
after the close of the day's trading.
   He said he had considered retirement for about a year, but
hadn't felt he could leave amid the continuing debate over market
volatility and the uncertainty raised by an Oct. 13 mini-crash.
   ``I did it because I thought the exchange was in good shape,''
Phelan said of his decision.
   Phelan declined to specify what he might do next and no
replacement was named. The NYSE board of directors said it named a
special committee to oversee a transition and help pick a
successor, and said the panel expected to make its recommendations
in the fall.
   There had been rumors for days that Phelan might be tapped to
replace Nicholas Brady as Treasury Secretary. Phelan said he hadn't
been contacted about a government job and wasn't considering one.
Brady has denied that he plans to resign.
   Phelan is perhaps best known as one of the cool heads at the
helm Oct. 19, 1987, when the market plunged out of control in a
selloff that erased 508 points from the Dow Jones industrial
average.
   The 58-year-old chairman and chief executive officer, who has
spent more than half his life in the securities business and took
the Big Board's top job in 1984, presided over the most dramatic
expansion in the NYSE's history.
   Since then the value of all stocks listed on the Big Board, as
it is commonly known, as grown from $1.6 trillion to more than $2.4
trillion. The NYSE ended 1989 with 1,721 listed companies, making
it the world's second-largest exchange behind Tokyo.
   Since the 1987 plunge, the NYSE and the securities industry have
been fighting a slump, hurt by investors who fled the market and
have been afraid to return, despite a number of reforms Phelan and
other industry leaders devised to lure them back.
   Phelan had said previously he didn't expect to be chairman for
life, but he was expected to remain at least until 1992, the 200th
anniversary of the stock market, founded when two dozen traders
gathered under a buttonwood tree on Wall Street.
   The most contentious issue he has faced recently is the price
zigzags that have characterized some trading days, especially last
Oct. 13 when the Dow Jones industrial average lost 190 points and a
subsequent session that had an 80-point single-day rise.
   Many traders have blamed the volatility on computerized program
trading, a practice in which millions of dollars worth of stocks
are traded instantaneously.
   Phelan has been reluctant to restrict program trading, although
he supported limits on it during times of heavy price fluctuations.
He was one of the first to warn that some kinds of program trading
could lead to a market disaster.
   ``I'm convinced there is a cure for intra-day volatility or
intra-hour volatility,'' he said Thursday. ``I'm not sure what it
is, but I'm sure there is a cure for it.''
   Phelan said he considered his main achievement the installation
of modern trading technology in the exchange, where average daily
volume climbed from about 20 million shares in the mid-1970s to
more than 600 million shares during the Black Monday crash. He
credited that technology for helping the exchange handle the huge
volume that deluged the market during the crash.
   Before he was named chairman and chief executive officer, Phelan
served as NYSE president and chief operating officer for four years
and as vice chairman for five years before that.

   An attorney charged Thursday that new information
points to Contra military leader Enrique Bermudez as the official
who ordered the killing of a U.S. volunteer building a rural dam in
Nicaragua.
   Benjamin Linder, 27, of Portland, Ore., died April 28, 1987,
when the U.S.-backed rebels attacked the hydroelectric dam in
northern Nicaragua. His family contends the engineer was abducted,
tortured and executed, but the Contras said he was armed, and died
in a firefight between rebel and Sandinista government troops.
   The family has filed a $50 million wrongful death suit in
federal court in Miami against the Contras and their leadership,
including Bermudez. The Contras at one time had a headquarters in
Miami.
   ``This was not just an attack on a dam ... this was an attack to
assassinate a man,'' family attorney Michael Ratner told U.S.
District Judge Stanley Marcus. ``Linder was taken alive and
executed subsequently, and Enrique Bermudez gave the order.''
   The charge was based on a deposition from Fermin Cardenas,
former head of operations for the Contras, and later given amnesty
in Nicaragua. Cardenas, who died shortly after giving his
statement, said Bermudez had ordered Linder killed to sabotage the
dam project, and congratulated the patrol's commander afterward.
Bermudez continues to head the rebel military.
   Thursday's hearing came on the family's request to amend the
suit with the Cardenas deposition, thus making it more specific,
instead of basing it on general claims that the Contras routinely
conducted such raids against civilian workers.
   The Contras' Miami spokesman, Alejandro Acevedo, strongly denied
Thursday that Linder was targeted by Bermudez or the Contras.
   ``We emphatically reject that,'' Acevedo said. ``It isn't our
custom to attack civilians, much less foreign citizens.''
   He said Linder was wearing a military uniform and was with
Sandinista troops at the time of the battle.
   Bermudez could not be reached for comment. A woman who answered
the phone at his Miami residence said Bermudez was in Honduras and
unavailable.
   The Contras in the past have vehemently denied targeting Linder
or intentionally killing civilians, painting the lawsuit as an
effort by people opposed to U.S. policy in Central America to
embarrass the Nicaraguan rebels.
   But Thursday, their attorney John Kirkpatrick stuck to legal
arguments aimed at showing Marcus had no jurisdiction in a war
fought on foreign soil, and that there was no chance for the
Contras to get evidence to defend themselves.
   ``I find it difficult to believe that (Nicaraguan President)
Daniel Ortega is going to subject himself to a deposition'' by the
Contras, Kirkpatrick said.
   Marcus said he had been close to ruling on the jurisdiction
issue prior to the plaintiff's request to amend the suit with the
new evidence, and would take the case under advisement.
   ``I have struggled with this case for a long time,'' the judge
told the attorneys. ``There are some very difficult issues.''
   Marcus seemed skeptical of the Linder family's suit, questioning
whether there were adequate legal standards to define the crime,
whether the defense would have access to Nicaraguan witnesses, and
worrying that the broad-based suit intruded on the executive and
legislative branches.

   Rebel Gen. Michel Aoun failed to crush a
rival Christian force and struck a truce Thursday after a three-day
battle that killed at least 70 people, police reported.
   The two sides had pounded each other with tank and artillery
barrages and shells inevitably went astray, smashing homes,
schools, hospitals and churches.
   ``It's a death machine,'' a woman said. ``Victims are lying in
the streets everywhere, yelling for help, but no one dares approach
them.''
   Most of the fighting centered on a cluster of government
buildings in Christian east Beirut that house the Justice and
Finance ministries. Much of the combat was house-to-house and some
shell-pocked buildings changed hands several times.
   Police said at least 70 people were killed and 250 wounded since
fighting began Tuesday between Aoun's soldiers and Samir Geagea's
Lebanese Forces, the largest Christian militia. They said hospitals
were packed with casualties and short of doctors and blood.
   Aoun, who has been dismissed as army commander but clings to his
command of about 20,000 soldiers, attacked on Tuesday to try to
gain full control of the 310-square-mile enclave north and east of
Beirut where 1 million Christians live. Geagea has 6,000 militiamen
bolstered by several thousand reservists.
   Aoun was fired by Moslem President Elias Hrawi, elected in
November under terms of an Arab League-brokered peace plan aimed at
shifting political power to the Moslem majority and ending a
15-year-old Christian-Moslem civil war that has left 150,000 people
dead.
   Aoun says the plan, approved by Parliament in October, provides
no fixed withdrawal timetable for Syria's estimated 45,000 troops.
   Geagea has neither accepted or rejected the peace accord, but
has recognized Hrawi as president. About 22,000 soldiers are loyal
to Hrawi.
   Police said Aoun's soldiers tried to advance behind a fierce
howitzer barrage Thursday but could not breach militia defenses on
the southern edge of the Ashrafiyeh quarter. They said the apparent
aim was to seize the main Lebanese Forces ammunition depot in
Ashrafiyeh.
   Shortly before dusk Thursday, Christian radio stations said Aoun
and Geagea agreed to the truce after a ``telephone discussion'' to
begin a truce at 4:15 p.m.
   According to police, the Lebanese Forces kept control of the
Ashrafiyeh quarter and port area of east Beirut when the agreement
was reached, with secure supply lines to their main bases in the
Byblos region on the 30-mile coastal highway north of the capital.
   The Lebanese Broadcasting Corp., Geagea's television station,
showed Aoun's navy, armored and air bases north of Beirut that were
captured by the Lebanese Forces.
   Aoun's Channel 5 TV station conceded the loss of the three
bases, claiming militiamen took the families of the officers in
each base hostage to force them to surrender.
   Police said Aoun's forces controlled the eastern and
northeastern flanks of east Beirut and the wooded Metn mountains to
the northeast.
   It was not immediately clear who had come out ahead in the
fighting.
   Fighting ``noticeably decreased'' after the cease-fire
agreement, ``but we still have intermittent mortar and machine gun
exchanges in east Beirut and its northern suburbs,'' said a police
spokesman, who cannot be identified under standing regulations.
   It was the fourth call for a truce since the battle began, and
the first to have an effect.
   The United States blamed Aoun for the worst fighting in the
Christian zone for nearly a year, and said he should step aside.
   ``Gen. Aoun must realize that his bellicose behavior does not
advance the interests of the Christians or any other community, but
only benefits those who want to see Lebanon continue in anarchy and
turmoil,'' the State Department said.
   Thousands of families hid in bomb shelters and basements.
Thousands more streamed into Moslem west Beirut during a lull in
the fighting, figuring they would be safer there.
   Christian housewife Ilham Jiha crossed the dividing line from
Ashrafiyeh with her husband and two children.
   Mrs. Jiha, who compared the battle to ``a death machine,'' said
Aoun's men ``shelled almost every building in Ashrafiyeh. Several
people were killed at the entrances to buildings.''
   President Hrawi told all hospitals to treat casualties at
government expense.
   But an official of the Saint George Greek Orthodox hospital in
Ashrafiyeh said: ``The problem is not one of money. We don't have
enough surgeons. ... We don't have enough blood. We don't have
ambulances. We don't have enough space. The upper floors have been
shelled.''

<HEAD>Deputy Premier Denies Involvement in Influence-Peddling Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Alfonso Guerra, the deputy prime minister,
told Parliament on Thursday he had nothing to do with any
influence-peddling by his brother.
   ``I assume responsibility for each and every one of my actions,
but none of those that may have been committed in my name,'' he
said.
   After the session, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez told reporters
he also would resign if Guerra was forced to quit.
   Guerra accused the opposition and media during the debater of
exaggerating the scandal since it arose a month ago.
   The reports allege that Juan Guerra, a door-to-door book
salesman when the Socialists formed their first government in 1982,
traded on his brother's name to build a real estate fortune and
operated from a government office in Seville.
   Gonzalez told reporters the opposition could ``kill two birds
with one stone: the resignation of Alfonso Guerra and the
resignation of Felipe Gonzalez.''
   He said he planned to sue a Madrid daily that implied the
Cabinet, in 1986, knowingly favored Juan Guerra by approving a
government subsidy for a real estate company with which he was said
to be associated.
   The prime minister, who won a third four-year term Oct. 29,
condemned what he called unfounded press reports accusing political
figures or their family members of corruption. He said he favored
extending influence-peddling legislation, which now covers only
government employees, to private citizens.
   Provincial prosecutors in Seville and Cadiz are investigating
some of Juan Guerra's business activities.
   Socialist parliamentary spokesman Eduardo Martin Toval noted
that no party officials had been convicted of corruption despite
numerous opposition accusations the past seven years.
   Alfonso Guerra said he was not aware of Juan Guerra trading on
his brother's position during his seven years as the deputy prime
minister's aide in Seville, the family hometown.
   Reports of the scandal have damaged the Socialists, who have 166
deputies in the lower house, half the 332 allotted after the Oct.
29 elections. Another 18 are vacant pending court-ordered repeat
elections in three districts.
   The conservative Popular Party, the largest opposition group
with 99 seats, and the Communist-led United Left, with 17, joined
several smaller regional parties in demanding the deputy premier's
resignation.
   In a 20-minute speech, Alfonso Guerra acknowledged the party
employed his brother from July 1982 to May 1989, but denied knowing
of any misuse of the Seville office.
   ``The deputy prime minister does not have any knowledge that
that office was used for activities other than those that were
supposed to take place there,'' the deputy premier told Parliament.
   He said he never had used his influence to obtain money or
encouraged Juan Guerra or anyone else to do so.
   ``From the facts, we must conclude that there has been no injury
to the public interest,'' he said.
   Guerra denied that he, the government or the Socialist Party
bore any responsibility for any illegal acts his brother may have
committed.
   ``As far as the rest is concerned, the appropriate
administrative and judicial bodies must establish if the law was
infringed by the activities of the private citizen Juan Guerra,''
he said.

   Interior Minister Richard Sacher
on Thursday disbanded Czechoslovakia's secret police and said
commissions are being set up to decide the fate of former members,
the official CTK news agency said.
   Sacher ordered police records safeguarded against moves to
destroy them, began collecting officers' weapons and said state TV
could have a look at intelligence headquarters Monday, to show
citizens the changes under way since the democratic revolution here
last November.
   CTK quoted Sacher as saying, ``Having abolished the department
of internal intelligence earlier, I have abolished the remaining
components of the secret police today.''
   Last month, Sacher fired all leading officers of the secret
police and replaced them with members of the police force
considered reliable. He disbanded the internal intelligence
service, which spied on Czechoslovaks.
   ``As of 9 a.m. today the process of confiscating of private and
service weapons belonging to members of these departments is under
way ... ending tomorrow at 3 p.m.,'' Sacher was quoted as saying
Thursday.
   Sacher last week asked all citizens to hand in privately owned
weapons and declared gun permits invalid.
   He acted to secure police records, saying as of Friday, ``safes
with written materials will be sealed off as well as the rooms they
are in.''
   As of Monday, specially appointed staff members ``will secure
measures vital to the state's security. ... Other staffers will not
be allowed to enter their offices.''
   ``We shall say goodbye to those who broke the laws in various
areas of security work, who acted against the principles of
intelligence ethics,'' Sacher said.
   ``These matters will be consistently judged by commissions of
experts and citizens ...
   ``In no way do we want a witchhunt.''
   Rumors that a coup was being organized by secret police and
sympathetic Communists circulated during the week.
   Sacher decided on Monday to strengthen regular police patrols
with soldiers of the Interior Ministry wearing an insignia to show
loyalty to the new regime.
   The minister called the secret police ``a product and a tool of
the old totalitarian regime'' who were used against the people. It
is estimated that the service had up to 100,000 employes.
   ``As of today, there is a brand new structure of the security
forces controlled by the Ministry of Interior,'' Sacher said.
   ``It is the intelligence service, office for the protection of
the constitution and democracy, department for the protection of
constitutional officials, bureau of investigation, passport service
and foreigners' office, and the immediate deployment force.''

<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
on Thursday appointed a special representative to help settle a
dispute between Guyana and Venezuela over a region rich in natural
resources.
   The governments of Guyana and Venezuela have agreed to
participate in U.N.-sponsored mediation to settle the dispute over
the Essequibo region, known to have extensive mineral deposits and
possibly oil.
   Perez de Cuellar named Alister McIntyre to head the U.N. effort
to end the controversy that dates back to when Guyana was ruled by
Britain and Venezuela by Spain.
   McIntyre has been vice chancellor of the University of the West
Indies in Jamaica since September 1988. Prior to that he was
assistant U.N. secretary-general for development and international
economic coordination.
   Since the last century, Venezuela has claimed sovereignty over
the Essequibo region, 34,000 square miles located in what is now
west-central Guyana.
   The Venezuelan government bases its claim of sovereignty over
the region on colonial documents signed when Venezuela was part of
Spain's empire and before Britain took control of territory that is
now Guyana.
   In 1966 Venezuelan and Guyanese authorities agreed to settle the
conflict peacefully. No settlement had been reached by March 1983,
so the matter was taken to the U.N. secretary-general.

   Iran-Contra middleman Albert Hakim was placed
on two years probation and fined $5,000 Thursday after giving up
his claim on what prosecutors said was $7.3 million in arms-deal
profits now frozen in Swiss accounts.
   The Iranian-born businessman, who pleaded guilty Nov. 21 to
illegally helping supplement Oliver North's government income with
a $13,800 home security system, bitterly attacked the government
after his sentencing.
   ``I have been abused by two presidents,'' Hakim said after his
appearance before U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell. ``I'm
talking about President Reagan and President Walsh,'' he said, the
latter referring to independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, who directs
the Iran-Contra investigation.
   ``The American public has had enough of this soap opera,'' Hakim
said.
   Hakim, who could have been sentenced to up to a year in jail and
a $100,000 fine on the misdemeanor charge, is the sixth person
sentenced in the Iran-Contra affair. No one has been sent to jail.
   Richard Janis, Hakim's lawyer, said his case was ``a monument to
the hypocrisy of a system that permits individuals'' to face
criminal charges after they ``in good faith carried out the
requests of their government.'' He called Hakim ``a fall guy,'' a
term that former White House aide North has used to describe
himself in the affair.
   Former Reagan National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter still
faces trial, on Feb. 20.
   Shortly after the Iran-Contra affair erupted in November 1986,
Swiss authorities placed a hold on $7.8 million contained in
accounts of ``the Enterprise,'' a financial network of offshore
companies Hakim helped set up for use in the affair. With interest,
that amount has grown to $9 million.
   Hakim and two Swiss-based lawyers working with him are claiming
part of the money, said Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for the
Iran-Contra prosecutor's office.
   He agreed to let the U.S. government have $7.3 million, while he
will split $1.7 million with the two lawyers, Willard Zucker and
Philippe Neyroud. The Justice Department approved the deal Monday.
Zucker says he is owed $800,000 while Neyroud says he is owed
$120,000, said Belcher.
   The U.S. government now will try to persuade the Swiss to
unfreeze the accounts.
   Belcher said $7.3 million was all that could be identified as
Iran arms sale proceeds and that ``we are satisfied with the
agreement,'' despite the fact that Hakim and his lawyers stand to
collect the remainder.
   Gesell also placed one of Hakim's companies, Panamanian-based
Lake Resources Inc., on probation and ordered that the corporation
be dissolved. Lake Resources had pleaded guilty to a charge of
theft of government property in the diversion of Iran arms-sale
profits to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   According to Hakim, North and others in the affair, the arms
sales to Iran were aimed at winning the release of U.S. hostages in
Lebanon while aid was channeled to the Contras to help them against
the leftist government in Nicaragua.
   Hakim became involved in the Contra resupply operation in 1984
when North enlisted the help of Hakim's business partner, retired
Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord.
   North said he contacted Secord for the Contra operation at the
suggestion of CIA Director William Casey, whose agency was barred
by law from providing military aid to the rebel force. Reagan
authorized the idea of keeping the Contras in operation. Hakim and
Secord, who later were brought into the Iran arms operation as
well, set up ``the Enterprise,''
   ``Very substantial funds _ measured in the millions of dollars _
which have been frozen'' in Swiss bank accounts ``have now been
released to the United States by you,'' Gesell told Hakim.
   Hakim stated in court papers that other participants in the
affair have become wealthy, an apparent reference to North who has
benefited from fund-raising efforts and big-fee speaking
engagements.
   Gesell said Hakim's cooperation with Iran-Contra prosecutors was
``in sharp contrast to any other of the defendants who have been at
one time or another before me in ... the Iran-Contra ... case.''
   The judge was referring to North, Secord and Poindexter. North
was convicted of three felonies and was fined and ordered to
perform community service; Secord pleaded guilty to making a false
statement in connection with North's security system and was put on
two years probation.
   Former hostage David Jacobsen said in an interview with Cable
News Network that Hakim ``actually believed that he was operating
with the highest authority given, and for him to be put through
this turmoil, to be put into bankruptcy, to have his personal life
destroyed, I think that's a real shame.''
   Hakim asserts that only about $1.3 million from Enterprise money
was transferred to him for his Iran-Contra activities in 1985 and
1986, much of it for expenses.
   Although a private businessman who did not have a security
clearance, Hakim had access to an astonishing amount of sensitive
information, his lawyer disclosed in court papers this week.
   In connection with the Iran-Contra affair, Hakim received top
secret communications equipment from the National Security Agency
and was made privy to classified intelligence information. He also
was provided with account numbers of CIA bank accounts and was
referred to CIA proprietary companies overseas. One item of
classified information which Hakim listed in the document is so
sensitive that government security officers deleted it from the
court filing.

   A lawmaker who missed more sessions than
she attended last year demanded an apology Thursday after a
eight-year incumbent was introduced to her as a newly elected
legislator, and she fell for the prank.
   Rep. Ethel Terrell issued a news release saying she refused to
attend House sessions until she received an apology from Reps.
Jerry Bartnik and Philip Hoffman.
   The two promptly apologized publicly to her and anyone else they
may have offended, after expressing disbelief that she had issued
the statement.
   `We're not here for jokes,'' Terrell said later. ``I thought it
was in very bad taste.''
   Terrell said her fellow lawmakers were able to pull off the joke
only because impaired vision is among the medical problems that
keep her away from Lansing. She declined to further describe her
medical problems.
   The prank was pulled Jan. 24, a week after D. Roman Kulchitsky
won a special election to fill a vacant seat. House members had
juggled a few seats, and four-term Hoffman ended up sitting between
Terrell and Bartnik.
   Bartnik told Terrell he'd introduce her to the House's newest
lawmaker, but it was actually Hoffman who shook her hand. She
smiled, welcomed him, and asked him if he had a tough campaign.
   Not only have Hoffman and Terrell served together for eight
years in the 110-member House, but they've been on the seven-member
Corrections Committee together for four years. Also, Hoffman noted,
he's the only red-headed man in the Legislature. ``I'm not
unnoticeable. I thought she was joking.''
   Terrell, who lives in the Detroit suburb of Highland Park, said
later that she was awaiting a personal apology, but would resume
attending sessions.
   ``When my brother Democrat approached me I thought he was
telling the truth. I took for granted another legislator was making
an honest introduction,'' Terrell said.
   House Speaker Lewis Dodak said Terrell was satisfied with their
statements and would attend session again, perhaps next week.
Terrell, 63, was first elected to the House in 1978.
   Terrell attended 56 of 119 sessions during 1989, an attendance
rate of 47 percent. Average House attendance is more than 80
percent.
   Terrell said her office runs efficiently even when she's away,
and that she is constantly in touch.
   ``My voters are satisfied because they know I'm a conscientious
worker,'' she said. ``I know they were just as upset about this
joke as I was.''
   ``A little lightheartedness kind of breaks the ice in an
otherwise serious business. If she doesn't have a sense of humor,
I'm sorry,'' Hoffman said.
   ``We certainly didn't mean to offend anyone,'' Hoffman said. ``I
guess if she never comes to session I'll never be able to
apologize.''

   President Chadli Bendjedid told a
Cabinet meeting that all political exiles are free to return to
Algeria without fear of retribution from authorities, the official
news agency said Thursday.
   The president ``reaffirmed that the exercise of political
freedom will be respected in favor of all, without any exclusion,
notably concerning the freedom to come and go as they please,
including those who have exiled themselves,'' the agency said in a
report about Wednesday's meeting.
   It was assumed the statement was addressed to the founder of the
Movement for Democracy in Algeria (MDA), former President Ahmed Ben
Bella, in exile since 1981. Ben Bella was overthrown by the late
Houari Boumedienne in 1965 and spent more than 10 years in Algerian
prisons.
   MDA spokesman Hocine Guermouche expressed satisfaction at this
``good news.''
   MDA leaders said ``certain attitudes of the government''
prevented Ben Bella's earlier return, referring to a statement by
Bendjedid last year saying Ben Bella remained subject to police
prosecution because of violence alleged to have been committed by
MDA supporters in Algeria.

   The prosecution asked on the fourth
day of their trial Thursday that the charge against four associates
of ousted Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu be increased to
``co-authorship of genocide.''
   They have pleaded guilty to complicity to commit genocide, and
admitted supporting Ceausescu's orders to shoot demonstrators
during the revolution that overthrew the Romanian dictator.
   The prosecutor, Col. Aurel Cosma, told the military court
Thursday in requesting the more serious charge: ``It is not
complicity but co-authorship to genocide.''
   Col. Andrei Nitoiu, the court president, said the five-judge
panel would decide Friday whether to grant the request.
   Lawyers said both co-authorship and complicity are punishable by
a maximum of life in prison at hard labor but the minimum terms are
different.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, who was the second most powerful
person in Romania, were convicted in a secret trial of genocide and
destroying the economy. They were executed by firing squad Dec. 25.
   Those being tried in the military court are Emil Bobu, 62,
former secretary of the Communist Party Central Committee and third
in the government behind the Ceausescus; former Interior Minister
Tudor Postelnicu, 59; and former Politburo members Manea Manescu,
74, and Ion Dinca, 62.
   The trial, the first of ranking Ceausescu aides, has shed new
light on the last days of his 24 years in power.
   Paul Niculescu Mizil, the only member of Ceausescu's Politburo
not under arrest, testified Thursday that the dictator's offer to
the Politburo on Dec. 17 to resign as Communist Party chief was ``a
trap'' to discover ``foreign agents'' in the leadership.
   At the Dec. 17 meeting, Ceausescu demanded the resignations of
Postelnicu, Defense Minister Vasile Milea and Chief of Security
Iulian Vlad for not carrying out his orders to shoot demonstrators
in Timisoara.
   Milea told Ceausescu he had studied the military regulations and
found nothing to justify the shooting of civilians.
   Dinca testified earlier that he and four other Politburo members
protested the demand for resignations, and he then offered to
resign. It was the first time Ceausescu had faced opposition in the
Politburo.
   Niculescu Mizil said that, by offering to step down, Ceausescu
believed he could identify the ``agents'' by noting who did not
support him.
   ``The people who didn't stand up would be considered like
traitors,'' he said. ``They would have been killed.''
   He said the four defendants were among about 15 Politburo
members who stood up, some crying, and ``didn't allow Ceausescu to
give up'' his post. Cosma, the prosecutor, said 25 people attended
the meeting.
   Prosecutors claim the four defendants could have prevented the
killing or wounding of nearly 2,000 people by asking Ceausescu to
resign. Instead, they supported his order to shoot demonstrators.
   Niculescu Mizil confirmed a shorthand transcript of the meeting
that said Gen. Ion Coman, appointed by Ceausescu as commander in
Timisoara, ``gave an order to shoot'' demonstrators there. Coman is
said to be under arrest.
   A defense lawyer said Milea, the defense minister, was not
executed after the Dec. 17 meeting and was not forced out of the
army.
   Milea, who died Dec. 22, hours before Ceausescu tried to escape,
has become the hero of the revolution. There is controversy over
whether he committed suicide or was assassinated on Ceausescu's
orders for refusing to shoot demonstrators.
   Capt. Nicolae Matei of Ceausescu's feared Securitate secret
police testified that he heard Dinca say: ``For 3,000
demonstrators, we shouldn't give up the socialist society. We must
open fire.''
   Matei, who is under arrest, provided a surreal moment. He said
he was ordered to go from Primaverii Palace to Central Committee
headquarters the night of Dec. 21, while protests raged in
Bucharest, to take two of Ceausescu's dogs back to the palace.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh asked a
special court Thursday to appoint an independent counsel to
investigate allegations of criminal wrongdoing by former Housing
Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and other former federal housing
officials.
   The independent counsel, if appointed, would be asked to probe
allegations that Pierce and other Department of Housing and Urban
Development officials ``may have violated federal criminal law'' in
the administration of the HUD Moderate (income) Rehabilitation
Program.
   In a letter to the House Judiciary Committee, Thornburgh said
the special counsel was being sought to investigate allegations
that Pierce and other HUD officials ``may have committed the crime
of conspiracy to defraud the United States or any other crime'' in
administering that program between 1984 and 1988.
   Thornburgh's formal application to a special court cited reports
of a ``widespread perception among developers'' and local officials
that ``funds were being disbursed in a disproportionate amounts to
projects backed by prominent Republicans acting as consultants or
by former HUD officials.''
   But the attorney general said he ``found no reasonable grounds
to believe that further investigation is warranted'' of allegations
that Pierce lied during congressional testimony when questioned
last May about political favoritism in the awarding of HUD grants.
   Thornburgh signalled his reluctance to use the independent
counsel law, saying he had ``very little latitutde in making this
determination. I must apply to the court for an indepedent counsel
unless I can determine that there are no reasonable grounds to
believe that further investigation is warranted.''
   The attorney general's application to the Special Division of
the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was
released by the department after the three-judge panel approved
Thornburgh's motion to make it public.
   Pierce's successor at HUD, Jack Kemp, promised to cooperate with
the investigation, once the appointment is made by the special
court.
   ``This is a tragic situation for all involved,'' Kemp said in a
statement. ``However, the department will provide whatever
cooperation and assistance is required for full and fair
disposition of this matter.''
   Robert Plotkin, one of Pierce's lawyers, said, ``We continue to
believe that Mr. Pierce has not violated any federal laws and we
are confident that, at the conclusion of an independent counsel
investigation, that will be determined.''
   The attorney general's move came after the Justice Department's
criminal division conducted a preliminary inquiry into allegations
that Pierce lied to a House subcommittee when questioned last
spring about political favoritism in the awarding of grants during
his tenure in the Reagan administration.
   The preliminary investigation was triggered last fall by the 19
Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee, who requested
appointment of an independent counsel to investigate allegations of
political favoritism and perjury by Pierce.
   Thornburgh, an outspoken critic of the special prosecutor law,
said his decision to seek appointment of an independent counsel was
compelled by the severe restrictions on his ability to conduct an
investigation that were placed upon him by statute.
   ``A determination that no further investigation is warranted is
virtually forclosed'' despite a review of ``voluminous
information'' compiled by the HUD inspector general, the House
subcommittee and Justice Department interviews with HUD officials,
the attorney general said.
   ``Such a determination at this time is made especially difficult
here by the breadth of the allegations and the fact that a number
of figures central to the alleged conspiracy, including Secretary
Pierce, and his executive assistant, Deborah Dean, have declined to
be interviewed,'' the attorney general's application said.
   But Thornburgh disclosed that Pierce had provided written
answers to questions the department submitted to him during the
preliminary inquiry, which began in Dec. 4.
   Ms. Dean also invoked the Fifth Amendment protection against
self-incrimination in refusing to testify before the House
subcommittee. Pierce also took the Fifth when called back to
testify last fall.
   ``We will have no comment at this time until we have an
opportunity to see the letter, which, of course, we have not
seen,'' said Joseph diGenova, who represents Ms. Dean.
   The attorney general noted that under the law he was barred from
using the traditional prosecutorial tools, such as issuing grand
jury subpoenas or granting immunity to witnesses, to conduct the
preliminary inquiry.
   Nor was he able to base a decision to drop the investigation on
a person's state of mind ``unless I can determine by clear and
convincing evidence that the person lacked the requisite state of
mind for criminal liability.''
   Thornburgh said there was no reasonable basis to continue an
investigation of the perjury allegations because the questioning by
lawmakers and the answers Pierce gave were too ambiguous.
   The attorney general said Pierce's statement that he did not
have ``hands on'' involvement in the award of moderate
rehabilitation grants ``is fundamentally ambiguous, which makes a
perjury prosecution essentially impossible.''
   ``The terms is readily susceptible to countless
interpretations,'' Thornburgh said.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee that
investigated allegations of wrongdoing at HUD, said, ``I welcome
the attorney general's decision and believe that an independent
counsel is in the best position to fully investigate and resolve
questions of possible criminal wrongdoing.''
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., called Thornburgh's decision ``a
very important step'' for those involved in the HUD scandal ``to be
held accountable by the criminal justice system.''
   Morrison, one of two Judiciary Committee members who pushed the
drive for last fall's congressional request, said it was important
that the independent counsel be authorized to pursue other
officials too.
   Pierce was a New York lawyer before taking the secretary's post
in 1981. Plotkin declined to say what Pierce is doing now.

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Three Saudi Embassy Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen killed three employees of the
Saudi Arabian Embassy within minutes of each other Thursday
afternoon, attacking two in a car and one outside his apartment,
police said.
   Authorities could not immediately determine a motive in the
slayings of the three male Saudis, and descriptions of the
assailants were sketchy _ one was described as Arab-looking and the
other Thai.
   One gunman hiding in a parked car killed Abdullah A. Al-Desri,
32, a consular official, as he walked toward his apartment near the
embassy at about 3:30 p.m. He was shot four times, police said.
   Interior Minister Banharn Sipla-archa told reporters the killer
was ``Arab looking'' but had no further details as to his identity.
   A few minutes after the first shooting another assailant shot
dead Fahad Az Al-Bahli, 35, a second secretary at the embassy who
was traveling in an embassy car about a half-mile away, police said.
   Killed with him was the driver, Ahmed A. Al-Saif, 26, an embassy
telex operator, they said.
   The gunman had pulled open the door of the parked car and shot
Al-Saif twice and Al-Bahli three times, police said. Shell cases
from a 6.35mm weapon were found nearby, they said. A witness told
police the assailant appeared to be a Thai national.
   Early last year, gunmen fatally shot a third secretary of the
Saudi Arabian Embassy, Abdullah Al-Maliki. He was also shot near
the embassy on Sathorn Road, a busy thoroughfare in central Bangkok.
   Maliki was responsible for processing visa applications from the
tens of thousands of Thais who work in Saudi Arabia each year.
   The crime has not been solved, but police investigators said
some job placement agents were unhappy about the diplomat's strict
application of regulations when processing visas for Thai workers.
   Workers going to the Middle East pay agents a fee for securing
jobs and the necessary paperwork.

<TEXT>
   Talks began Thursday on withdrawing all
Soviet troops from Hungary by the end of the year, the state news
agency MTI said.
   The delegations, headed by Secretary of State Ferenc Somogyi
from the Hungarian Foreign Ministry and Soviet Deputy Foreign
Minister Ivan Aboymov, will meet for two days.
   ``The talks are aimed at setting a definite timetable (for the
withdrawal). We are thinking in terms of this year, or into next
year at the very latest,'' Somogyi said in an interview Thursday
night.
   Concerning a proposal Wednesday by President Bush to further
lower troop levels in Europe, Somogyi said his initial impressions
are that its ``significant lowering of the foreign-troop level
ceiling is a positive development from the aspect of the Vienna
talks.''
   The talks are the second of their kind in Eastern Europe since a
wave of democratization started loosening the Soviet grip over its
Warsaw Pact allies.
   The first such negotiations, held in Prague on withdrawing
troops from Czechoslovakia, ended inconclusively in early January.
A second round of Soviet-Czechoslovak negotiations is set for next
week.
   The estimated 50,000 Soviet troops in Hungary and 70,000 in
Czechoslovakia are stationed on the basis of ``temporary''
agreements the Kremlin reached with the countries after quashing
revolts in 1956 in Hungary and in 1968 in Czechoslovakia.
   The call for removing the Soviet troops has been echoed through
the new leaderships of the East bloc. In Poland, Solidarity leader
Lech Walesa made the appeal to the Soviet ambassador, although the
non-Communist-led government has not started negotiations.
   Moscow began reducing its troop presence in Hungary in April as
part of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's program of cutting 50,000
soldiers from the Red Army in Eastern Europe.
   While Moscow has signaled willingness to discuss the demands
from Prague and Budapest for withdrawal, it is not clear whether
the Soviets want the pullouts coordinated with cutbacks due for
agreement later this year at the Vienna talks on reducing
conventional forces in Europe.
   The Hungarian talks will be attended by senior military figures
from each side, MTI said.

<TEXT>
   A Michigan woman accused of smoking crack cocaine 13 hours
before giving birth was ordered Thursday to stand trial, but in
Wyoming a judge dismissed a child-abuse complaint brought against a
woman because she drank alcohol.
   In Michigan's Muskegon County Circuit Court, District Judge
Fredric Grimm ordered Kimberly Hardy, 22, to stand trial on charges
of second-degree child abuse and delivering cocaine to her newborn
baby after he was born, but before the umbilical cord was cut on
Aug. 20.
   In Laramie, Wyo., Albany County Judge Robert Denhardt dismissed
a child abuse complaint against Diane Pfannenstiel, saying the
state did not produce probable cause that her fetus had been
injured.
   Pfannenstiel, 29, was about four months pregnant when she was
arrested Jan. 4, two months after another judge ordered her to
remain alcohol-free. A blood test revealed she had a blood alcohol
level of 0.1 percent, the level at which a person is considered
intoxicated under state law.
   Drug use, particularly cocaine, has led to arrests of pregnant
women or new mothers in some states. Crack-cocaine use by pregnant
women has led to several arrests in Florida on charges of
delivering cocaine to newborn babies since the first successful
conviction in August. But that case is still on appeal.
   A grand jury in Rockford, Ill., refused late last May to indict
a young mother for involuntary manslaughter in the Feb. 4 death of
her 2-day-old daughter, who succumbed to oxygen deprivation
attributed to her mother's alleged use of cocaine during pregnancy.
   In a separate case in Rockford, an unidentified juvenile mother
was convicted last May of prenatal child abuse for allegedly using
cocaine a few hours before the birth of her daughter.
   About a dozen pregnant women who tested positive for drugs or
whose newborns had cocaine in their systems have been charged in
South Carolina with criminal child neglect. Prosecutors say they
will recommend probation and treatment _ not jail time _ for any
woman who is convicted.
   In the Michigan case, Hardy was charged in November after
voluntarily undergoing treatment for substance abuse. She admitted
smoking crack about 13 hours before giving birth, Sheriff's
Detective Al Van Hemert testified.
   ``I certainly wish you well, but I don't think the court can
turn its back on the situation and say we don't care. ... I think
that would be the biggest travesty of all,'' the judge told Hardy.
   Dr. Dan Mikesell testified that Hardy's son suffered from low
birthweight, poor gastrointestinal functions and frequent spitting
up in the hours and days after birth at Muskegon General Hospital.
   He said drug screening turned up cocaine in the baby's urine.
   Conviction of delivery of cocaine is punishable up by to 20
years in prison and $25,000 fine, while second-degree child abuse
carries a top penalty of four years in prison.
   The baby and Hardy's other two children, ages 4 and 1, have been
placed in foster care. Hardy is free on personal bond.
   In the Wyoming alcohol case, the judge noted that the state's
child abuse statutes require that an injury be demonstrated. ``The
key as I see it is that the child already has to have suffered,''
Denhardt said.
   Dr. Gary Lang, a pediatrician, testified that studies have shown
pregnant women who drink excessively are prone to give birth to
children suffering from fetal alcohol syndrome, which is exhibited
by physical and mental developmental defects. But Lang could not
say definitely that the defendant's fetus had been injured by its
mother's drinking.
   Another judge had ordered Pfannenstiel to remain alcohol-free
following a previous pregnancy that produced a baby suffering from
fetal alcohol syndrome, according to court records.

   A human rights group on
Thursday praised the government's decision to look into alleged
police death squads, but said the security forces appear
increasingly unhappy with President F.W. de Klerk's reforms.
   De Klerk refused to call for such an inquiry in December but
reversed himself Wednesday and named a Supreme Court judge to probe
the charges. He also asked for a separate inquiry into the death of
a 20-year-old black man, found hanged Tuesday in his police cell.
   Anti-apartheid groups long have alleged that the security forces
were involved in the more than 60 unsolved killings of activists
during the 1980s.
   The Human Rights Commission, a private group led by
anti-apartheid activists, said de Klerk's reversal ``illustrated
clearly that sustained pressure both internally and internationally
against the system of apartheid continues to have its effect.''
   It said de Klerk was ``bringing to heel the security
apparatus,'' but added, ``The erratic performance of the security
forces suggests that there is disagreement and even rebellion
against the government's new survival-motivated policy of
presenting a clean image to the world.''
   De Klerk has allowed peaceful protests since shortly after
assuming power last August.
   Police, however, recently have resorted to tear gas, rubber
bullets and baton charges to break up peaceful demonstrations
considered illegal.
   Police Gen. Herman Stadler on Tuesday blamed an upsurge in
unrest on the government's more relaxed attitude toward political
dissent.
   De Klerk told top 500 police officials recently that the force
would no longer fight the government's political battles and should
stick to fighting crime.
   According to reports, police morale has suffered since the
controversy over the purported death squads broke out late last
year. Three former policemen have said they took part in killing
government opponents under authorization of their superiors.
   Police have denied that assassination squads exist.
   But last Oct. 19, the night before he was due to be hanged,
black former policeman Butana Almond Nofomela swore in an affidavit
he was part of a police death squad.
   Armed with the affidavit, human rights activists obtained a stay
of execution so Nofomela could help in investigations of death
squad activity.
   Nofomela, on death row for a killing with no apparent political
overtones, named two former policemen he said also participated in
the killings.
   The men, Dirk Coetzee, a white former captain, and David
Tshikalanga, who is black, fled South Africa and admitting taking
part in at least 10 killings.
   Coetzee is in Zimbabwe, and reportedly has joined the African
National Congress, the main black group fighting South Africa's
white-dominated government.
   In an interview with the Star newspaper of Johannesburg, Coetzee
was quoted as saying he welcomed a full investigation _ ``I hope
the whole thing will come out into the open now.''
   Nofomela recently pleaded guilty to the 1981 stabbing death of
black anti-apartheid attorney Griffiths Mxenge. Arrest warrants
were issued for Coetzee and Tshikalanga in the same case.
   Police meanwhile said Thursday that Pieter van der Merwe, a
20-year-old white soldier, has been arrested in connection with the
murders of three blacks who were abducted in a minibus, shot dead
and left at intervals along a highway near Klerksdorp, a mining
town 100 miles west of Johannesburg.
   He was identified as a conscript serving in an army artillery
brigade.
   Police gave no indication of a possible motive.

<HEAD>Alaska Parish Administrators May Officiate at Weddings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT FURLOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Asssociated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Vatican has granted the far-flung Roman
Catholic archdiocese of Alaska permission for six female parish
administrators to officiate at weddings when priests or deacons are
not available, church officials said Thursday.
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops had asked for such
permission at its November meeting, responding to a request from
Archbishop Francis T. Hurley of Anchorage.
   The bishops, in announcing the approval from Rome, quoted Hurley
as saying, ``The church and canon law are not as rigid as some are
prone to think.''
   The Catholic Church ``has a history of adjusting to
extraordinary situations,'' Hurley was quoted as saying in Friday's
edition of his church newspaper.
   The extraordinary situation in Alaska, Hurley had said, was a
land area bigger than many nations and served by only a few priests.
   Hurley pilots his own airplane in order to travel the great
distances between Alaskan parishes. In presenting his request last
November, he told fellow bishops that bad weather can hold him up,
upsetting long-scheduled wedding plans.
   Officially, the Vatican Congregation for Divine Worship granted
permission for Hurley to delegate authority for weddings to nuns or
lay people otherwise qualified _ knowing how to perform the
ceremony, licensed by the state and so forth.
   Hurley's newspaper said the ruling in this case applies to five
nuns and one lay woman currently serving as parish administrators
in his archdiocese.
   The permission applies only to Alaska for now _ for a trial
period of five years _ but could be extended to other U.S. dioceses
in similar situations pending requests to the Vatican by other
bishops.
   Hurley said, ``There is no intention to take the priest or
deacon from the scene. Rather this permission will remove the
uncertainty that at times hovers over a planned wedding when fog,
rain or snow ... makes the arrival of a priest or deacon
questionable.''

<HEAD>ANC Cancels Appearance of Death Squad Defectors</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Death Squads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress on
Thursday canceled plans to produce in public a white defector who
says he was the leader of a South African death squad.
   Four hours after former police Capt. Dirk Coetzee was scheduled
to appear at a news conference in Harare, ANC information director
Pallo Jordan said the event was called off ``because of
circumstances beyond our control.''
   Asked if the guerrilla-backed organization had bowed to pressure
from the Zimbabwe government, Jordan said, ``It would be incorrect
to put it that way.''
   He did not elaborate and declined to give further comment.
   Earlier Thursday, ANC officials said the Zimbabwe government
expressed disquiet over the appearance in Harare of Coetzee and a
black former policeman, David Tshikalanga, said also to have been a
member of a police hit squad authorized to kill anti-apartheid
activists in South Africa.
   The officials said the two men were to reveal details of
killings they were involved in and had compiled a dossier alleging
the activities of death squads were sanctioned by former South
African law and order minister Louis Le Grange and his successor
Adrian Vlok.
   A senior ANC official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
colleagues met at the Zimbabwe Foreign Ministry late Wednesday and
again early Thursday.
   ``There are hurdles. We were waiting for a permit from the
authorities to go ahead,'' he said of the scheduled news conference.
   Coetzee was in a private suite at a Harare hotel and information
on his immediate plans was not known. He was expected to have
announced a wish to join the ANC if given the approval of the
organization's leaders.
   In a brief written notice canceling the news conference, the ANC
referred all further inquiries to its external headquarters in
Lusaka, Zambia.
   In the past, Zimbabwe has allowed the ANC to maintain offices in
Harare but denied the presence of armed guerrillas on its territory.
   Several ANC facilities in Zimbabwe have been the target of
bombings and sabotage attacks blamed on South African agents.
Coetzee, who fled South Africa in November, has been implicated in
more than 10 killings, including the 1981 death of black attorney
Griffiths Mxenge.
   The ANC says Coetzee and Tshikalanga allege the widespread
involvement of South African security officers in unsolved killings
over several years.

<HEAD>Palestinian Throws Bomb at Army Post; Lowest Fatality Toll in
January</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian hurled a homemade bomb at an army
outpost in the occupied Gaza City on Thursday and suffered serious
wounds in the explosion, military officials said. An Israeli
soldier was slightly injured in the blast.
   An army official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
soldier was only ``scratched'' in the attack and treated on the
spot. The assailant was taken to Barzilai Hospital in the southern
Israeli town of Ashkelon, he said.
   Officials at Gaza's Ahli Arab hospital said they treated
Mohammed El Batneij, 24, a Gaza City resident who suffered multiple
wounds and was later taken away by troops.
   Arab journalists said they believed El Batneij was the attacker
in the incident reported by the army, but the military had no
comment.
   In other violence, two Palestinians were reported shot and
wounded in a clash between soldiers and stone throwers in the West
Bank city of Nablus. A Palestinian suspected of collaborating with
Israel died of head wounds after reportedly being beaten by fellow
Arabs.
   Also Thursday, an Israeli human rights group said eleven Arabs
were killed by Israelis during January, matching the lowest monthly
fatality toll since the Palestinian uprising began nearly 26 months
ago.
   An Israeli army spokesman said, however, that the lower toll did
not necessarily mean the revolt against Israel's occupation in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip was over. ``There have been ups and downs
in the amount and the extent of violence,'' said the spokesman,
Maj. Moshe Fogel.
   During January, Israelis killed nine Palestinians in the West
Bank and two in the Gaza Strip, according to the Israeli
Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories.
   The organization, founded by liberal Israeli politicians and
academics, said that matched the lowest monthly death toll of
Palestinian victims in the uprising, 11 in November 1988.
   It noted 21 Palestinians were killed in December 1989 and the
highest monthly toll of the uprising was 44 killed in April 1988.
   In the West Bank, a Palestinian man suspected of collaborating
with Israel died Thursday of massive internal hemorrhaging after
being clubbed by masked Arab assailiants, hospital and Arab reports
said.
   Wahid Abdalla Rashid, 29, died at Ramallah hospital after he was
severely beaten in Jammala, a village 14 miles northwest of
Jerusalem. The army confirmed the death and said it was under
investigation.
   Rashid's death brought to 176 the number of Palestinians killed
by their fellow Arabs on suspicion of assisting Israel during the
revolt that began December 1987.
   At least 651 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians during the ``intefadeh,'' Arabic for uprising.
Forty-three Israelis have also died in the violence.

   A woman was sentenced to life in prison with
no chance of parole Thursday for murdering the second infant
daughter she reported abducted in less than three years.
   A Peoria County jury ruled out the death penalty for Paula Marie
Sims after three hours of deliberation.
   The same panel convicted Mrs. Sims on Tuesday of first-degree
murder, obstruction of justice and concealing a homicide in the
death of 6-week-old Heather Lee, whose suffocated body was found
May 3 in a Missouri trash barrel.
   Madison County Judge Andy Matoesian immediately sentenced her to
natural life in prison, meaning no chance for parole. Mrs. Sims sat
ashen but impassive.
   ``Justice was done,'' the prosecutor, Assistant Madison County
State's Attorney Donald Weber, told reporters outside the courtroom.
   Defense attorney Donald Groshong said he would appeal the
verdict. Earlier, he argued for a lesser sentence.
   ``Natural life does not take into consideration the possibility
of rehabilitation, the fact that all life has worth,'' he said.
   But Madison County State's Attorney William Haine said Mrs. Sims
should spend the rest of her life behind bars.
   Mrs. Sims, 30, of Alton, had told police Heather Lee was
abducted by a masked gunman from her home in the Madison County
city of Alton on April 29 _ a story nearly identical to the one she
told after the 1986 disappearance of her firstborn daughter,
Loralei.
   Heather's body was found across the Mississippi River in nearby
West Alton, Mo. An autopsy indicated she had been suffocated and
her body subsequently frozen.
   Thirteen-day-old Loralei was reported abducted June 17, 1986,
from the Simses' former home in the nearby rural Jersey County town
of Brighton. Police found a baby's body 150 yards from the Sims
home a week later, but no positive identification was ever made.
   No murder charges have been filed in Loralei's death, but Mrs.
Sims faces trial in Jersey County on charges of obstruction of
justice and concealment of a homicide.
   Prosecutors argued that Mrs. Sims and her husband, 37-year-old
Robert, had wanted only male babies.
   Sims, who has not been charged in either case, has custody of
the couple's 2-year-old son, Randy.
   After sentencing, Haine, the county's top prosecutor, said the
investigation into Heather Lee's death remains open.
   ``There will be some other charges filed,'' he said, without
elaborating.
   Juror John Joplin said the panel decided against the death
penalty in the hope that Mrs. Sims would lead authorities to others
involved in the crime.
   The jury foreman, Peoria engineer Harold William Ryan Jr., said
jurors didn't buy Mrs. Sims' description of the child's abduction.
   ``Her story was well-prepared on the witness stand but I guess
we just didn't believe it,'' Ryan said after the sentencing.
   The trial was moved to Peoria County because of pretrial
publicity in southern Illinois.
   Under Illinois law, death penalty hearings have two phases: the
first to determine whether the crime warrants the death penalty;
the second to determine whether the death penalty should be imposed.
   Jurors on Wednesday had found Mrs. Sims eligible for death by
lethal injection. Thursday's decision followed additional testimony
and arguments.
   Groshong fought unsuccessfully for a delay in Thursday's
proceedings, saying his client had lost the will to live and needed
psychiatric evaluation.
   ``She still maintains her innocence, but says, `I don't have any
reason to go on, I don't have any reason to live. Whether I'm
innocent doesn't matter _ they can go ahead and execute me,'''
Groshong said.
   Matoesian said he considered Mrs. Sims capable of proceeding.

<HEAD>Venezuelan Prostitutes Join Bar Owners to Protest Alcohol Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY CAPLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 hotel, bar and restaurant
workers and owners marched on the mayor's office Thursday to
protest the ban on alcohol sales after midnight he imposed last
month in the center of the capital.
   Joining them were dozens of prostitutes in tight jeans, who
complain their trade also is being hurt.
   Mayor Claudio Fermin decreed that alcohol sales be prohibited in
Caracas's federal district after midnight as an anti-crime measure.
The prohibition cuts across the center of Caracas, with the eastern
and southern sectors of the city not affected.
   ``It's ruined my business. How can I tell a client he has to
leave after he's just sat down with a beer?'' asked Joao Sosa
Abreu, owner of a restaurant-bar in downtown Caracas.
   Several bar owners insisted that the liquor curfew has done
little to fight crime.
   ``They're clamping down on my business, and all it does is it
makes people go drink up in the hills and shoot each other up
there,'' Sosa Abreu said.
   National guard and police units in charge of enforcing the
decree make life difficult for the prostitutes who abound in the
center of the city at night.
   Many of the women call themselves dancers and models.
   One bar worker, Carmen Guzman, complained, ``Why should they
stop me from making a living? I've got four kids.''
   Ms. Guzman said her minimum wage paid by the bar had been cut in
half, to about 25 cents a night.
   Most women who work in Caracas bars as entertainers or barmaids
can bring home from 70 cents to slightly over a dollar a night,
depending on tips, said Ms. Guzman.
   Bar owners estimate they are losing an average of about $1,200 a
month in business from the prohibition.
   The mayor did not meet with the marchers. A merchants'
association sent him a letter demanding that the liquor ban be
imposed at some later hour than midnight, but no response was
received, said owners in the march.
   During the protest march, a dozen metropolitan police in riot
gear stood guard in front of the municipal palace which contains
the mayor's office.
   Fermin is the first mayor of the federal district elected by
direct vote. About 70 percent of eligible voters didn't cast
ballots in the Dec. 3 election.

   Three men accused of supplying 75 percent
of the city's heroin were ordered to pay the costs of keeping them
in federal prison for terms ranging from two to 6{ years.
   The defendants will be charged $1,200 a month, in addition to
$91 a month for the cost of supervised probation once they're out
of prison.
   ``It's the just thing to do,'' said Chief U.S. District Court
Judge Francis J. Boyle. ``To the extent that a defendant is able to
pay for it the defendant should be required to.''
   The men pleaded guilty to a variety of drug charges and were
sentenced Friday by U.S. District Judge Ernest C. Torres, who ruled
after reading a presentencing report that found the men able to pay.
   The defendants are Oscar Tillett, 38, sentenced to 6{ years and
fined $60,000 on three counts of selling heroin; Luis Cepeda, 39,
sentenced to 27 months and fined $15,000 for selling heroin, and
Esteban Colon, 39, sentenced to 2 years and fined $40,000 for
selling herion and possessing the drug with intent to distribute.
   Federal prosecutors alleged the men were responsible for
distributing 75 percent of the city's heroin.
   Federal judges in Providence have ordered defendants to pay for
their own incarceration ``a couple of dozen times'' since the the
option was opened to them in November 1987, said Donald Wyatt, the
U.S. Marshal in Providence.
   An attempt to adopt a similar sentencing option at the state
level failed in the Rhode Island General Assembly in 1988.
Opponents, including the local chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, argued the practice would unfairly take money from
convicts' families.
   Florida had a similar law on the books from 1979 through 1981,
but it was repealed because annual administrative costs were
$89,673, compared to total collections of $7,636 over the three
years.

   The decision by Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh to seek an independent counsel investigation of former
HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. and other former department
officials is the latest development in nearly a year of disclosures
about Reagan-era problems at the agency. Here are highlights:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>PIERCE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Pierce, the only Cabinet member to serve for the entire eight
years of the Reagan administration, told Congress early in its
review of the agency's problems that he was not a ``hands on''
manager and that he took no direct role in contract awards. Later
testimony and HUD documents, however, showed Pierce intervened to
assist a North Carolina development supported by a former law
associate and that he personally lifted sanctions against a HUD
lender after being lobbied by former HUD Secretary Carla Hills.
Numerous other accounts have demonstrated that Pierce intervened in
numerous cases, suggesting a more active role than he indicated in
his initial congressional testimony. Pierce refused testify later,
citing his constitutional protection against self-incrimination.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MODERATE REHABILITATION</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It was an audit of this program by HUD's inspector general that
set off the investigations of Pierce's tenure. The audit said
former agency officials and developers who hired prominent
Republican consultants won the lion's share of subsidies under the
program. The audit also said that many participants had bloated
mortgages and because of that were receiving excessive subsidies,
costing HUD _ and taxpayers _ hundreds of millions of dollars.
Among the GOP consultants called before Congress was former
Interior Secretary James Watt, who made more than $300,000 lobbying
HUD, and Fred Bush, who is no relation to President Bush but was a
major fund-raiser for his election campaign. President Bush
withdrew an ambassadorial nomination of Fred Bush after GOP
senators told the White House it was doomed because of the HUD
hearings.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>CO-INSURANCE</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has canceled this program, blamed for
$900 million in just six years. A key Reagan housing program,
co-insurance allowed private lenders to commit the government to
insuring mortgage loans. HUD's inspector general said co-insurers
often issued mortgages well in excess of property values, earning
themselves higher fees but increasing the chances for default.
Defaults leave HUD liable for 80 percent of the loan.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>INFLUENCE-PEDDLING</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The moderate rehabilitation audit was the first of several
reports and investigations alleging widespread favoritism at HUD
during the Reagan years. Documents showed Deborah Dean, Pierce's
former top aide, on at least one occasion allowed a close friend
who was a former HUD official-turned housing lobbyist to see a
confidential document affecting a client. The report also
questioned the conduct of then Assistant Secretary Thomas Demery,
saying many of the recipients of the lucrative subsidies were
donors to a charity Demery helped found. But the Justice Department
declined to prosecute Demery. The Senate Ethics Committee also is
investigating whether New York Republican Alfonse D'Amato used his
influence to steer HUD contracts to campaign donors and other
associates.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>MISMANAGEMENT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Lax agency management left HUD unable to account for millions of
dollars. The most publicized example was HUD's relationships with
the private escrow agents hired to handle sales of HUD properties.
One, Marilyn Harrell of Maryland, was dubbed ``Robin HUD'' after
she admitted withholding more than $5 million owed HUD and said she
gave some of the money to the poor. She pleaded guilty to theft and
other charges this week. In all, a dozen such agents are being
investigated. The entire leadership of the Washington, D.C., field
office was fired and a dozen other managers have either resigned or
been transferred in a management shakeup.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>OTHER DISCLOSURES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the other embarrassing disclosures since the Mod Rehab
report was issued last April were the use of one HUD program to
build luxury developments such as a golf course-condominium
development and the use of money from a program designed to benefit
low- and moderate-income elderly for a pricey apartment development
near Palm Beach, Fla.

<HEAD>PLO to Send Delegation to Moscow on Israeli Jewish Emigration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior PLO official said Thursday his
organization will send a delegation to Moscow to ask that Jewish
emigration to Israeli-occupied territories be restricted.
   The plans were revealed after Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir suggested last month that Israel needed to keep the occupied
lands to settle the expected wave of immigrants, which Israel says
may total 300,000 in the next three years.
   Azzam al-Ahmed, the Palestinian ambassador in Baghdad, told The
Associated Press the delegation will include leaders of the
Palestine Liberation Organization's various factions and members of
the PLO executive committee.
   He said the PLO leadership, which discussed the problem in its
latest meeting in Tunis, decided to send the delegation to put the
request to the Soviet leadership. No date was mentioned.
   Israeli officials have said 4,700 Jews left the Soviet Union in
January, and 4,600 of them came to Israel. The PLO fears the influx
will eventually change the balance of population in the occupied
territories.
   Presently about 70,000 Jews live in more than 120 settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza. About 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs live in
the territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Al-Ahmed did not say exactly what the PLO wants the Kremlin to
do to stop the influx.
   Arab diplomats said the PLO wants Moscow to pressure Washington
to allow more Jews to settle in the United States, following recent
measures by Washington to restrict the influx of Soviet Jews.
   Al-Ahmed said Moscow can take political and administrative
measures to discourage its Jewish population from emigrating to
Israel. He did not elaborate.
   Palestinian officials also have been complaining that Soviet
news media do not give wide coverage to the 26-month-old
``intefadeh,'' or uprising, in the occupied territories.
   They say more coverage would highlight problems that would-be
Jewish emigrants could face if they chose to go to the occupied
territories, and discourage such emigration.
   In Tunis, a top Soviet diplomat told the PLO Wednesday that
Moscow shares ``the same concerns'' over possible settlement of
Soviet Jews in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gennadi Tarassov expressed his
views to the PLO's executive committee.

   Fidel Castro greeted the crew of a freighter
fired upon by the U.S. Coast Guard when they arrived Thursday in
Havana, praising their courage in the face of a ``Yankee attack,''
the official Cuban news agency said.
   Prensa Latina said the Cuban president met the crew of the
freighter Hermann at the stairs of the plane that brought them home
Thursday afternoon from the Mexican port of Tampico.
   The news agency said the crew was then taken to downtown Havana,
where ``hundreds of thousands of people had gathered'' in tribute
to them near the U.S. interest section, which handles U.S.
diplomatic affairs in Cuba.
   A U.S. Coast Guard cutter opened fire on the Hermann with a
machine gun and cannon after the freighter repeatedly refused to
stop and be searched for drugs. The Hermann was escorted to Tampico
Wednesday by the Mexican Navy and searched by Mexican officials,
who said they found no drugs.
   Cuba has filed a protest with the United States over the
incident, whcih took place as the freighter crossed the Gulf of
Mexico between Cuba and Mexico.
   ``This deed demonstrates once more that the United States
intends to behave as owner of the world and with its proverbial
barbarism appears willing to obstruct normal commerce between Cuba
and Mexico,'' a Cuban official in Washington said, according to
Prensa Latina.
   The Coast Guard ended its attempt to stop the Hermann when the
freighter entered Mexican waters.
   Mexican officials searched the 250-foot freighter, which is
registered in Panama, at the request of U.S. officials.
   Capt. Aristides Palma Palma, head of port operations in Tampico,
said the Hermann was hit 50 times bu gunfire but that none of the
crew was injured. A new crew arrived in Tampico Thursday and the
old crew was flown home.
   The Hermann, which Cuban officials said carried 10 tons of
chromium, was to undergo repairs in Tampico.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the incident
``was not an attack and a provocation. We were engaged in a legal
law enforcement activity.''
   But Cuba's ambassador in Mexico, Jose Fernandez de Cossio, said
in Tampico that Cuba will file a complaint about the incident with
the U.N. Human Rights Commission.
   The incident, Prensa Latina quoted Castro as saying, ``was a
demonstration of the courage of our people. It's what I would have
expected in the face of a Yankee attack.''
   Capt. Diego Sanchez Serrano filed a damage claim with Tampico
harbor authorities saying the Hermann, owned by the Cuban Guamar
Shipping Co., and its crew had been the victims of a terrorist act,
the Excelsior news service in Mexico City said.

   The dramatic lunch counter sit-in 30
years ago that helped ignite the 1960s civil rights movement
surprised everyone, even the four black participants who re-enacted
it Thursday at Woolworth's.
   ``We were scared,'' recalled Franklin McCain, one of the four
college students who staged the first lunch counter sit-in on Feb.
1, 1960. ``All I wanted was a Coke and a doughnut.''
   ``If someone had come up behind me and said boo, I probably
would have fallen off the stool,'' said another protester, David
Richmond.
   When McCain and his three college friends took their same seats
Thursday, they were treated like celebrities. A black Woolworth
executive greeted them before they sat down to a breakfast of eggs,
grits, bacon and coffee.
   McCain, Richmond, Joseph McNeil and Jibreel Khazan, formerly
Ezell Blair Jr., were surrounded by dozens of reporters and
spectators when they ordered food from two female employees who
worked there on Feb. 1, 1960.
   Woolworth Vice President Aubrey Lewis, noted that 30 years ago
he, too, would have been denied service. ``I'm proud you had the
courage to open the doors for a movement,'' Lewis said.
   While they waited for their meals, some spectators began singing
``We Shall Overcome.'' Outside there was more singing, directed by
the NAACP, and some bystanders carried placards saying ``Feb. 1,
1960. It seems like only yesterday but it could be tomorrow'' and
``The only thing that's worthwhile is change _ Remembering Feb. 1,
1960.''
   One thing that hasn't changed much is the lunch counter, which
looks about the same as it did in 30-year-old news photographs
about the sit-in. But now, black and white customers sit side by
side on the chrome and red vinyl seats, ordering food and
discussing sports and events of the day.
   When the four North Carolina A&amp;T State University freshmen
refused to leave the whites-only counter 30 years ago, their sit-in
touched off similar protests across the South.
   During their sit-in, which began about 4 p.m., a policeman stood
near them and slapped his billyclub in the palm of his hand a few
times, but they were not threatened with arrest. The store was
closed at 5 p.m., a half-hour early, and they left peacefully.
   ``We did get some encouragement on the first day and we got it
from quarters you wouldn't ordinarily expect it to come from,''
McCain said. ``There was a little old white lady of oh, 75 years of
age, who came over and placed hands on our shoulders and said to
us, `Boys, I'm so proud of you. The only thing I regret is that it
didn't happen 20 years earlier.''
   ``People took us for granted because we were poor youth,
freshmen in college,'' Khazan said. ``In America, people don't
really believe young people can do anything to make positive change
in society.
   ``We've achieved some rights, but there's many more rights that
haven't been achieved.''
   Elizabeth Koopman, an education professor at Guilford College,
recalled reading about the protests back in Michigan.
   ``It shook the world,'' she said. ``You knew it was coming, like
the Berlin Wall bursting open.''
   Geneva Tisdale, who is black, was one of those working at the
Woolworth's lunch counter on Feb. 1, 1960. She remembers the four
students coming in that day.
   ``I thought they were joking,'' she said Thursday. ``I never
thought they were serious.''
   Another counter worker, Ima Edwards, who is white, said she
didn't ``see it blossoming into this.''
   After Thursday's breakfast, the four went outside, where the
street in front of the store was renamed February One Place. A
plaque and their footprints were dedicated to commemorate the
anniversary.
   Other events are planned through Sunday to mark the occasion.
   Bill Bellow, who said he was seated at the counter when the
students took their seats back on Feb. 1, 1960, embraced Khazan
outside the store.
   ``I was right there in the middle, two on each side,'' he said.
``I wouldn't leave. I told the lady to serve them. These kids had a
right to sit down to a cup of coffee.''
   Bellow, 64, said his support for the students did not sit well
with many of his friends in Greensboro. ``They got on my side two
or three years later,'' he said.
   The four said they had targeted Woolworth because it was a
well-known national chain that allowed its lunch counters to be
segregated only in the South.
   The sit-ins quickly spread to more than 50 cities in nine states.
   ``All of us were surprised that it spread so rapidly to other
cities,'' said McNeil. `Six months later it began to wane, but we
hung in and persevered. We saw it to the end.''
   On July 25, 1960, Woolworth agreed to allow blacks at the lunch
counter. Later accounts reported the chain lost about $200,000 in
business during the sit-ins.

   Mexico said Thursday it will not charge five
Mexican citizens, including two former top-echelon lawmen here, who
were indicted in Los Angeles in the torture-slaying of U.S. drug
agent Enrique Camarena Salazar.
   ``We are not going to file any complaints at this time,'' a
spokeswoman for the Attorney General's office told The Associated
Press. ``They were members of the past administration.''
   Manuel Ibarra Herrera, former chief of Federal Judicial Police,
and Miguel Aldana Ibarra, who headed the Mexican branch of the
international policy agency Interpol, live in Mexico City and
served in the administration of former President Miguel de la
Madrid, who left office 13 months ago.
   They were indicted Wednesday by a federal grand jury in Los
Angeles that is continuing a five-year investigation into the
deaths of Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent,
and his Mexican pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Camarena and Zavala were killed after Camarena led raids on
marijuana plantations allegedly run by Guadalajara drug kingpin
Rafael Caro Quintero.
   Camarena's body was found March 5, 1985, on a ranch 65 miles
southeast of Guadalajara. The DEA pledged it will prosecute all
connected to the case.
   A Mexican judge in December sentenced Caro Quintero to 40 years
in prison for his role in the Camarena slaying. He is one of a
dozen people convicted in the case in Mexico.
   The Los Angeles indictment also named Juan Ramon Matta
Ballesteros, who was extradited from his native Honduras in 1988
and sentenced to a life term in prison by a Los Angeles federal
judge.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said authorities have no
information about any U.S. plans to request extradition of the
Mexican citizens indicted Wednesday.
   One, reputed druglord Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo, has been in
jail in Mexico on narcotics charges since April.
   The whereabouts of two, Humberto Alvarez Machain and Antonio
Vasquez Ochoa, are unknown.
   Vasquez is charged with violent crime in aid of racketeering in
the Guadalajara slayings of U.S. citizens John Walker and Alberto
Radelat in January 1985.
   Neither Aldana or Ibarra could be reached at their Mexico City
telephone numbers on Thursday.
   But Aldana, 44, was quoted by the independent Excelsior news
service in Mexico as saying he is considering ``a countersuit
through Foreign Ministry channels.''
   Aldana resigned from his Interpol post on Jan. 2, 1986, after 28
years as a law enforcement officer. He said he wanted to write
books and do criminology research.
   He resigned after the weekly newsmagazine Proceso said a drug
defendant had testified that a shipment of Colombian cocaine seized
at the Mexico City airport was for Aldana. The defendant later
recanted, claiming his testimony was made under duress.
   Aldana alleged in recent interviews that Camarena was corrupt.
   He told Excelsior his only involvement with the Camarena murder
were ``investigations ordered by the Attorney General's office in
1985.''
   The former Interpol chief in Mexico now is top man in one of
about a dozen lawyers associations in Mexico City and runs a
private consulting business called Desarollo Empresarial, S.A. de
C.V.
   Ibarra, 58, dropped out of public life in 1988 when he retired
from the judicial police, Mexico's equivalent of the FBI.
   Newsweek, the U.S. news magazine, said in a 1985 report that
when Ibarra led the force, the DEA gave him a tip that Matta
Ballesteros was in a Mexico City hotel. But the magazine said that
it took Ibarra's men 36 hours to reach the hotel and by the time
they arrived, Matta Ballesteros had fled, .
   The Attorney General's Office told Excelsior that both Aldana
and Ibarra have been called before federal magistrates since
retiring, but only to testify as investigators.

   Tommy Gioiosa, a friend of banned baseball
star Pete Rose, was sentenced Thursday to five years in federal
prison for transporting cocaine and for conspiring to hide Rose's
racetrack winnings from the IRS.
   Gioiosa's allegations about Rose's betting habits have been
widely reported, though he refused to give information to the
investigation that led baseball officials to ban the former
Cincinnati Reds player and manager from the game for life.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel didn't fine Gioiosa,
saying Gioiosa didn't have the money to pay one. Gioiosa, 31, had
faced a maximum 28 years in prison and $1.5 million in fines.
   Spiegel ordered Gioiosa to begin serving his sentence
immediately, rejecting defense requests that he remain free on bond
while he appeals.
   Gioiosa was convicted in September of claiming all of a $47,646
winning Pik Six bet at a Kentucky racetrack for tax purposes, when
Rose actually owned part of the ticket. Prosecutors argued during
the 13-week trial that Rose had Gioiosa claim the ticket because
the Rose was in a higher tax bracket.
   Gioiosa admitted during trial that he drove cocaine shipments
from Florida to Cincinnati for operators of a gymnasium where he
and Rose worked out. Rose has been cleared by the FBI of any
involvment in drugs.
   Gioiosa was sentenced to five months each on two tax-evasion
charges and to five years on the cocaine charge. The terms are to
be served concurrently, making the total term five years.
   Gioiosa had little to say before sentence was imposed, telling
the judge, ``I'm sorry for what I've put my family through.''
   In an interview broadcast Thursday, Gioiosa repeated earlier
allegations that Rose bet on baseball games, including Reds games.
   ``I've sat in his office and watched him bet on baseball games,
including the Reds and many other baseball teams,'' Gioiosa said in
an interview broadcast on WKRC-TV in Cincinnati.
   ``That's a closed issue as far as I'm concerned,'' Rose said in
response to Gioiosa's claim. He spoke at news conference before a
speech Thursday night to students at the University of Florida.
   ``I can't prove I didn't,'' Rose said. ``Obviously you can't
prove a negative.''
   Asked about Gioiosa's jail sentence, Rose said, ``I feel sorry
for him, but if you break the law, bad things are going to happen
to you.''
   Another former Rose associate, Paul Janszen, told baseball
investigators that he placed bets for Rose on Reds games when Rose
was manager of the team.
   Gioiosa, a bodybuilder, lived with Rose for about five years in
the late 1970s and early 1980s, and testified during the trial that
he regularly placed bets for Rose with bookmakers. He didn't
provide details of the bets.
   Rose, who holds the major league record for most lifetime hits
with 4,256, accepted a lifetime ban from baseball in August when
confronted with evidence of illegal gambling. A federal grand jury
in Cincinnati is has been trying to determine if Rose paid all the
taxes due on his racetrack earnings, memorabilia sales and
autograph appearances.
   One of Gioiosa's lawyers, Martin Weinberg, said Gioiosa
continued to decline to talk to those investigating Rose.
   ``He has not wanted to invade his private relationship with Pete
Rose,'' Weinberg said.
   Since his conviction in September, Gioiosa has been living with
his parents in New Bedford, Mass., and managing a gym.

<TEXT>
   Parliament passed a law Thursday extending
the May deadline for the United States to dismantle its military
installations in Greece.
   The deputies approved a bill limiting the bases to staying in
Greece until Nov. 21, unless a new defense agreement is reached
with the United States.
   Elections are scheduled for April 8, leaving the next government
to carry on negotiations.
   Under terms of an agreement that expired in December 1988, the
United States had until May 21 to remove personnel, property and
materiel from four major bases and several smaller installations.
   The conservative and socialist parties supported the bill
extending the deadline and want to continue negotiations with the
United States. Together they have 276 seats in the 300-member
Parliament.
   A Communist-led alliance voted against extending the deadline on
the bases' removal and called for an end to negotiations on their
future.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday proposed closing
two of the four major installations in Greece. They are the
Hellenikon Air Base and Nea Makri, a naval communications base.
Both are near Athens.
   The bases are among 14 U.S. foreign military installations and
more than 60 in the United States which Cheney announced he wants
to close or restructure to save money.

<HEAD>Service Cuts, Tax Hikes Proposed in $27.8 Billion City Budget</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins proposed a record $27.8
billion budget Thursday and said he had no choice but to seek $550
million in new taxes and to cut city services ``to the bone'' to
balance it.
   The city faces a budget shortfall of $445 million for the
current fiscal year, which ends June 30, and a gap of more than $1
billion in the 1991 budget, said Dinkins, who took office Jan. 1,
replacing Edward Koch.
   ``Let me be very plain,'' Dinkins said at a City Hall news
conference, ``service reductions are inevitable, higher taxes are
necessary, sacrifices will be required. On this, we have no
choice.''
   He said the $226 million in service cuts will include
eliminating one fire battalion for a savings of $425,000, cutting
$4.5 million in funds for libraries and cultural institutions and
scaling back training of new math, science and computer teachers.
   Worst of all, he said, would be a delay in hiring 2,708
additional police officers until sometime in fiscal 1991. The
department has 26,000 officers.
   The mayor blamed the city's budget squeeze on falling revenues,
a reduction in aid from Washington, and a variety of items the
state requires the city to fund.
   Under the Dinkins budget, $180 million in new property taxes
would be raised. Homeowners would pay an average $33 a year more
than they presently do and property taxes on midtown Manhattan
office space would be raised 19 cents per square foot.
   A three-year, 7.5 percent surcharge in the city's personal
income tax would raise $200 million and cost the average taxpayer
$70 annually.
   He also proposed raising city gasoline taxes and a variety of
other levies. Depending on the levy to be changed, the proposals
would require action by the state Legislature, the City Council or
both bodies.

<HEAD>U.S. Clashes with China and Cuba at Annual Meeting</HEAD>

   The United States on Thursday clashed with China
and Cuba at the annual session of the U.N. Human Rights Commission
after the two Communist countries criticized the U.S. invasion of
Panama.
   Morris Abram, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in
Geneva, called on the hard-line leaderships in Beijing and Havana
to test their ``totalitarian regimes'' by following the recent
examples of Chile and El Salvador and hold elections.
   Abram criticized China for saying it regretted civilian deaths
during the U.S. action last December in Panama while remaining
silent on the loss of hundreds of Chinese lives at the hands of the
army in Tiananmen Square last June.
   Diplomats expressed surprise at the strength of the criticism
against Beijing because of the Bush administration's recent
conciliatory moves and restoration of high-level contacts with
China after Washington's initial outrage at the violent suppression
of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   In a speech to the 43-nation commission, Chinese delegate Zhan
Daode said his country was ``shocked at the large-scale armed
invasion and military occupation of Panama by the United States.''
   ``The Chinese delegation strongly calls on the United States to
put an immediate end to its acts of aggression and to withdraw
unconditionally all its troops from Panama,'' Zhan told the meeting.
   The head of the Cuban delegation, Raul Roa, called on the U.N.
body to condemn the U.S. action, saying the meeting must respond to
the ``denial of fundamental rights and freedoms for the Panamanian
people.''
   ``This commission can not remain silent in the face of this
monstrous aggression or of the specious and cynical arguments
advanced to justify it,'' Roa said.
   Defending the U.S. intervention, Abram criticized Cuba and China
for saying nothing about the human rights abuses perpetrated by
deposed Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Noriega, now in Miami facing
drug trafficking charges.
   ``How do these representatives (of China and Cuba) explain the
enormous outpouring of support for the restoration of Panama's
rightful rulers,'' he said, citing an opinion poll that showed 95
percent support for the new government of Guillermo Endara.
   ``When did Cuba last have an opinion poll?'' he added.
   The United States has said Cuba should be placed on the U.N.
list of countries causing special concern because of their human
rights record. The delegation head at the six-week meeting in
Geneva is former Cuban political prisoner Armando Valladares.
   The human rights meeting, which started Monday, lasts until
March 9.
   In addition to the national representatives on the commission,
the meeting is attended by observers from most other U.N. member
states and about 150 private rights groups.

<HEAD>Suit Filed Over Derailment, Pipeline Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of a neighborhood that was
devastated by a train derailment and subsequent gas pipeline
explosion sued Southern Pacific railroad and the pipeline company
for negligence Thursday.
   The suit, filed in Superior Court on behalf of 349 plaintiffs in
San Bernadino, alleges ``negligence and conscious disregard of
safety'' by the railroad and Calnev Pipe Line Co. in the fatal
accidents, said attorney James H. Davis.
   The amount sought for general, compensatory and punitive damages
was not specified, Davis said.
   Others named in the suit include the city and county of San
Bernardino, the chairman of Southern Pacific and other individuals.
   Four people died and 30 were injured on May 12, 1989, when a
freight train roared out of control down a mountain pass and
derailed, throwing rail cars into the neighborhood.
   Brake failure and a flawed estimate of the load carried by the
train contributed to the derailment, according to testimony at
federal hearings held last summer.
   Thirteen days after the derailment, an underground fuel pipeline
near the accident site exploded, killing two people and injuring 31.
   Calnev had examined the pipeline _ which supplies 90 percent of
Las Vegas' gas _ after the derailment and declared it safe.
   Federal investigators have said they believe either the impact
of the train accident or heavy equipment used to clean up debris
from it weakened the buried pipeline, ultimately causing it to
explode.
   However, testimony during the hearings held by the National
Transportation Safety Board failed to establish a causal link
between the two disasters. An NTSB report on the hearings is
pending.
   Most of the 90 families represented by the lawsuit lived on
Duffy and McDonald streets, Davis said. A total of nearly 20 homes
were destroyed in the derailment and pipeline explosion, and the
area remains a ``total desert,'' he said.
   ``Twenty years of my life I've lived there, and it all went up
in smoke,'' Nancy Fricks, a former Duffy Street resident, told a
news conference Thursday. ``And they don't even want to compensate
us for anything.''
   She claimed that Calnev has offered her $43,000 for her lost
home, but she contends it was worth $87,000.
   Other plaintiffs in the lawsuit live on adjacent streets and
alleged that their property values have dropped and they have
suffered emotional distress, Davis alleged.
   ``We were aware there were numerous claimants damaged or injured
as a result of the derailment,'' responded Southern Pacific
spokesman Bob Taggart. He said 200 claims have been settled so far,
and that the railroad remains anxious to reach a ``mutually
satisfying settlement'' of others.
   ``If we're unable to do that, a jury will decide,'' he said.
   Calnev spokesman Richard Kline said the company hadn't seen the
lawsuit yet and couldn't comment on it. But he said the company has
worked to help residents recover from the accident by providing
financial and medical assistance and offering to pay market value
for homes destroyed in the blast.
   Davis also criticized Southern Pacific and Calnev for what he
said was their failure to take steps to ensure against similar
accidents in the future.
   Southern Pacific spokesman Robert Taggart called the allegation
``irresponsible and inaccurate'' and said procedures had been
changed.

   Congress has agreed to investigate
former Venezuela President Jaime Lusinchi over charges he spent
nearly $400,000 in secret funds earmarked for the state security to
buy 65 jeeps, congressional sources said Thursday.
   The investigation will be conducted by a special committee to be
appointed next week, said the sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The decision, made late Wednesday, was supported by opposition
representatives from the Social Christian and Movement Toward
Socialism (MAS) parties, the sources said.
   Observers view it as a step forward in an drive to impeach
Lusinchi.
   Lusinchi has been the target of a almost ceaseless campaign
charging some of his aides of alleged corruption crimes during his
1984-89 administration amounting to billions of dollars.
   Lusinchi, 67, is in the United States and recently announced he
was prepared to return to Venezuela to defend his administration.
   Lusinchi's former Interior Minister Jose Angel Ciliberto, who
ordered the purchase of the vehicles, claims he acted under
instructions of Lusinchi.
   Last week Ciliberto was stripped of his congressional immunity
to allow a public court to begin a legal inquiry on the case.
   The Interior Ministry's secret funds are traditionally assigned
to cover security matters and are discretionally spent by the
president and the Interior Minister.
   The jeeps were allegedly used during the 1988 election campaign
and most of them ended in the hands of state governors and members
of the Social Democratic Party, according to congressmen
investigating the case.

<HEAD>Minister Threatens to Expel Miners by Force from Indian Lands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of gold miners, some
smashing windows and beating passers-by, rampaged in a remote
northwestern city Thursday against a government order to stop
prospecting on Indian land, officials said.
   Justice Minister Saulo Ramos, who arrived under guard at an Air
Force base in Boa Vista, about 3,000 miles northwest of Rio, said
the government is prepared to drive the prospectors off the Indian
lands if necessary.
   ``We will carry out our objective, at any cost,'' said Ramos in
a televised interview from the city, which is the capital of
Roraima state bordering Venezuela and is the main supply point for
miners.
   The government Thursday ordered 40,000 miners to move off the
Yanomami Indian reservation they have illegally mined since 1987 in
exchange for a 247,000-acre chunk of virgin Amazon rain forest
bordering it.
   Environmentalists called that agreement a defeat for the
9,000-member Yanomami tribe, one of the world's most primitive, who
lost their claim to traditional lands and have no safeguards
against disease and pollution caused by miners.
   Early Thursday, thousands of chanting miners with stones and
clubs converged on the city's main square demanding a meeting with
Ramos and a new agreement allowing them to mine more Amazon
territory.
   The miners took over the business district, town hall and
airport, battering pedestrians and breaking windshields of passing
cars, said police Capt. Wellington Silva dos Santos.
   ``The miners are very agitated and the situation is a powder
keg,'' said Santos by phone from Boa Vista, a city of 43,000 people.
   Globo TV, the nation's largest network, showed riot police with
submachine guns and clubs pushing back stone-throwing crowds of
miners from airport landing strips.
   The miners contend the Santa Rosa cooperative, 12 miles
northeast of the mineral-rich Yanomami reservation, was far less
than what the government agreed to give them three weeks ago.
   Under the former agreement, the prospectors were to receive
three tracts of National Park land totaling 1.6 million acres.
   ``We were tricked by the government,'' said Elton Ronehlt, owner
of the Gold Amazon company and a miner representative. ``It
promised us one thing and gave us another.''
   Federal police still controlled some 100 clandestine jungle
airstrips and were supervising the withdrawal of the miners to the
new area, said Ovidio de Araujo, of the Justice Ministry's Human
Rights Defense Council, in Brasilia, the capital.
   But, he added, ``Force will be used against those miners who do
not leave the area immediately.''
   Environmentalists warn the miners will spill off into Indian
reservations in neighboring Amazon states and decimate other tribes.
   The showdown between the miners and the government over Indians
rights came to a boil in early January when international pressure
prompted the goverment to announce a $4 million campaign to expel
the prospectors, by force if needed.
   There are about 220,000 native Indians left in Brazil, down from
an estimated 5 million when the Portuguese first landed here in
1500.

   The prosecution rested in the assault trial of
John Gotti on Thursday after jurors heard members of a gang say on
tape that they had shot a union official as a favor to the reputed
mob boss.
   The secretly recorded tapes seemed to contradict an 11th hour
defense suggestion that John F. O'Connor, former business manager
of Carpenters Union Local 608, might have been shot in the buttocks
by rival union members May 7, 1986.
   Prosecutors allege that Gotti, reputed boss of the Gambino crime
family, commissioned the Irish-American gang, called the Westies,
to shoot O'Connor because the union official led the trashing of a
mob-affiliated restaurant being constructed with non-union labor.
   Gotti, 49, and Anthony Guerrieri, 60, an alleged Gambino
soldier, are on trial in state court on charges of assault and
conspiracy in the non-fatal shooting.
   The prosecution rested after the jury heard the tapes. Bruce
Cutler, Gotti's lawyer, said the defense would decide Thursday
night whether to call character witnesses and a tape recording
expert.
   The tapes were recorded at Rikers Island jail during a visit by
Westies member Kevin Kelly and his friend, Larry Palermo, to
Francis ``Mickey'' Featherstone, a former Westies leader.
   Transcripts of the tape, the accuracy of which are in dispute,
show that Featherstone was the first to mention O'Connor's
shooting. Kelly and Palermo were unaware Featherstone was an
informer and that a microphone was hidden behind a picture on the
wall near them.
   Featherstone says, ``I knew you guys did it.''
   Kelly refers to Westies member Joe Schlereth, identified as the
gunman in trial testimony by Westies informer James McElroy.
   ``I recommended Joe the Lather,'' Kelly tells Featherstone.
``Joe Schlereth. You know Joe.''
   At another point, Kelly says, ``The guy was there. And he popped
him.''
   When Featherstone asks who requested the shooting, Kelly replies
it was done ``for the greaseballs.'' He says the Westies
volunteered their services to Gotti at the funeral of Gambino
family underboss Frank DeCicco.
   A principal defense tactic has been to challenge the quality of
the tapes and the integrity of the transcripts.
   Gerald Shargel, Guerrieri's attorney, has introduced transcripts
used in a federal case and made from the same tapes as those heard
by the Gotti jury. The state and federal transcripts each contain
things that aren't found in the other.
   Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin told jurors that what they hear
on the tapes and how they interpret it is what counts. He said he
was unsure he would allow them to take the transcripts into the
jury room during deliberations.
   McLaughlin told the jurors they would hear closing arguments
Monday and begin deliberations Tuesday.

   A senior aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir
said Thursday he believes a meeting of U.S., Egyptian and Israeli
foreign ministers will take place this month to pave the way for
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
   Yossi Ban-Aharon, Shamir's office director, said Israel had not
received a U.S. invitation for such a meeting.
   He said it was not likely to take place before next Wednesday's
showdown in the right-wing Likud bloc between Shamir and hawkish
party rivals opposed to peace concessions.
   ``Personally, realistically, I think it will not happen before
that. I think it will take place shortly afterward, during this
month. The timing is not important,'' Ben-Aharon said on Israel
Television.
   Israeli newspapers earlier Thursday suggested that Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens rebuffed U.S. efforts to schedule a meeting
within the next week.
   Israeli sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
confirmed that U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III called
Arens Wednesday and raised the subject. But he proposed no date,
they said, only the possibilities of convening such a meeting, and
Arens did not reject the idea of a meeting in the near future.
   Baker, Arens and Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid
would attend.
   The Maariv daily said Baker said Baker made the call after the
Palestine Liberation Organization reportedly agreed to U.S.
compromise proposals concerning Palestinian negotiators.
   The liberal daily Haaretz quoted political sources in Jerusalem
as saying that Baker considers the meeting to be the ``moment of
truth'' and wants to come out of it with a date for the start of
Palestinian-Israeli talks in Cairo.
   He will reject any attempt by Arens to ask for additional U.S.
assurances concerning the Palestinian-Israeli talks, Haaretz quoted
the sources as saying.
   Israel has asked for iron-clad U.S. guarantees that the PLO be
kept out peace talks, but Washington only promised that the PLO
would not participate in negotiations ``at this stage.''
   Israel calls the PLO a terrorist organization and refuses to
negotiate with it.

   One of the nation's largest subsidized housing
landlords has been suspended from future government work because of
a fraud investigation, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development said Thursday.
   HUD, in a letter to one of the company's affiliates, said the
government ``has information indicating irregularities of a serious
nature'' and that the company and its affiliates were being
investigated.
   The more than 40 affiliated companies are led by Associated
Financial Corp. of California and together control nearly 50,000
units of federally assisted housing. AFC's president is A. Bruce
Rozet, a prominent Democratic fund-raiser who in 1988 was a Jesse
Jackson delegate to the Democratic National Convention.
   Rozet, in a statement and additional comments issued through a
spokesman, called HUD's action ``pure harassment for political
reasons'' that ultimately would harm the low-income families the
agency is supposed to serve.
   He denied any wrongdoing and vowed to fight the suspension and
accused HUD of taking the action to avoid a hearing scheduled for
next week on lesser sanctions against an AFC affiliate.
   Meanwhile, The Washington Post said in Friday editions that a
hotel partly owned by Rozet wrote off a $30,000 debt owed by
Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign. Under federal election law,
the campaign would have to report the sum either as an outstanding
debt or as a contribution.
   In this case such a contribution would be illegal because it
comes from a corporation. Individual contributions are limited by
law to $1,000 per election per candidate.
   Jackson's campaign reports to the Federal Election Commission
made no mention of the bill owed to the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel
in Los Angeles, and James Hewitt, a lawyer for the campaign, told
the newspaper that the debt should have been listed.
   The newspaper reported that the debt was written off after the
hotel was able to collect just $45,000 of an overall debt of
$75,000 and cited an internal memorandum saying the unpaid balance
was a ``gift'' from Rozet.
   HUD General Counsel Francis Keating said AFC and its affiliates
were being investigated by the department's inspector general. Law
enforcement sources also said the U.S. attorney's office in Los
Angeles was investigating the companies.
   Those sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
Charles Bazarian, a man Rozet used as a property scout who later
was convicted of skimming money a from HUD-assisted project, was
cooperating with investigators.
   But the sources declined to discuss the substance of the probe,
and the Los Angeles prosecutor handling it, Lee Weidman, declined
comment.
   Rozet and AFC have had a number of run-ins with HUD over the
past decade, including several in the last year, and Rozet has said
first-year HUD Secretary Jack Kemp has allowed bureaucrats with old
grudges against the company to dictate HUD policy toward AFC.
   Kemp visited one AFC property shortly after taking office last
year and termed conditions there ``scandalous.'' Kemp's top deputy
also has called Rozet and his companies ``slumlords.''
   But community leaders in several areas with AFC properties have
defended the company, and Rozet often is called on by Congress as
an expert on housing policy. One of Rozet's biggest defenders in
Congress is Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., for whom Rozet has been a
major fund-raiser.
   HUD announced the suspension in a letter to an AFC affiliate,
Housing Resources Management Inc., which is controlled by Rozet
partner Deane E. Ross.
   Also affected by the suspension are AFC and more that 40 related
development and investment companies involved in the purchase and
management of government-assisted housing and the syndication of
tax credits developers of such projects receive from the government.
   AFC, speaking on behalf of its affiliate, denied that Housing
Resources Management was involved in any improper activities. Even
if those allegations were true, AFC said a suspension was
unwarranted because the allegations involved about $35,000.
   AFC's properties generate $80 million a year in rents, the
company said.
   The suspension will have no impact on existing properties owned
and managed by AFC and its affiliates but will block the company
indefinitely from trying to buy or manage any additional
HUD-assisted properties or from seeking any new government work.
   HUD's letter was sent to Ross on Friday and released by HUD
officials Thursday.
   In addition to the investigation, HUD said it had ``adequate
evidence'' that Housing Resources Management was involved in
``irregularities'' involving alleged misuse of security deposits
and reserve funds at apartment complexes it managed in New Orleans,
Oklahoma and Washington, D.C.
   HUD also alleged that the company was involved in requesting
rental subsidies for vacant units and submitting false repair
invoices at two Oklahoma properties.
   Among the allegations HUD made in the letter was that HRM
misused security deposit accounts at Southgate Apartments in
Watonga, Okla. That is the same project involved in the HUD-related
case against Bazarian.
   Bazarian is serving a sentence on an unrelated bank fraud
conviction and as part of a plea agreement admitted skimming
government funds from Southgate. Bazarian is scheduled to be
sentenced in that case next week.

<TEXT>
   Hours before he was to leave the island to
begin a prison term, a former two-term governor of Guam chained
himself to a public statue, wrapped himself in Guam's flag and
fatally shot himself in the head.
   Found at the base of the statue were four handwritten placards,
one of which said, ``I regret I only have one life to give for my
island,'' according to police Lt. Phil Dennis.
   Former Gov. Ricardo ``Ricky'' Bordallo, 62, shot himself
Wednesday less than four hours before he was to fly to Los Angeles,
where he was to visit his daughter before reporting to the federal
correctional facility at Boron, Calif., to begin a four-year prison
term for witness tampering and obstruction.
   ``I choose death before dishonor,'' Bordallo wrote on another
placard. ``My loving wife ... has my message which she will impart
to the people of Guam in due time.''
   An aide to his wife, territorial Sen. Madeleine Bordallo, said
the senator had not found such a message.
   Reporters who attended a farewell party for Bordallo earlier in
the day said he had appeared to be in good spirits.
   ``I didn't think this would happen,'' Congressional Del. Ben
Blaz said from Washington. ``Ricky Bordallo always seemed to bounce
back from his many adversities.''
   At a busy downtown intersection, Bordallo shot himself with a
.38-caliber pistol while chained to the statue of Chief Quipuha,
the first chief in Guam to adopt Christianity, Dennis said.
   He died a short time later of massive brain damage, according to
a spokesman at the Guam Naval Hospital. Mrs. Bordallo was
reportedly with him when he died.
   Territorial flags were lowered to half-staff, and Gov. Joseph
Ada declared a state of mourning until after Bordallo's funeral,
which is yet to be scheduled.
   Bordallo told the Pacific Daily News in an interview last Friday
that he was facing his prison term with ``complete serenity.''
   ``When a man is innocent, his conscience is clear, and he is at
peace with himself,'' Bordallo said.
   But he also said: ``My own instincts make me believe that I will
not be coming back from Boron alive. I'm not dwelling on how it
will happen. I will be in the hands of people who are masters of
intrigue.''
   Bordallo was found guilty in February 1987 of getting engineer
Johnny Carpio to lie to federal officials about a $60,000 political
contribution from a group of Japanese businessmen.
   During his trial, Bordallo admitted accepting money from the
businessmen, but contended the money was a campaign contribution.
   Carpio was convicted of extortion and bribery and was placed on
five years' probation.
   Bordallo, a Democrat, served as governor from 1974 to 1978, and
again from 1982 to 1986, when he was defeated by Republican Ada.

   CNN stands by the newsman who reported Mikhail
Gorbachev was considering resigning as head of the Soviet Communist
Party, a network executive said Wednesday, but CNN chief Ted Turner
said the report was based on rumor.
   Other news organizations carried Tuesday's report, attributing
it to CNN, but Turner told an Atlanta Press Club luncheon Wednesday
it was no ``scoop.''
   ``How can you scoop a rumor?'' he said. ``If rumors become
scoops, then every media will have one.''
   CNN Moscow correspondent Steve Hurst quoted a ``a well-informed
and usually reliable Communist Party source'' as saying that
Gorbachev was thinking of stepping down as party general secretary,
but remaining president of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev on Wednesday denied the report.
   ``All this is groundless,'' he replied to a question about the
report from reporters covering his meeting with Brazilian
President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello. ``It is in someone's
interest to propagate such things.''
   CNN on Wednesday continued reporting that Gorbachev had thought
about resigning, but added that Hurst, a 12-year Moscow veteran,
said his initial information ``could be a trial balloon ... or just
a rumor by people opposed to Gorbachev rule.''
   Ed Turner, executive vice president of news gathering for CNN,
said the network was not backing off the story but was continuing
to report developments.
   ``We believed in Hurst's source because I have great confidence
and faith in him,'' said Ed Turner, who is no relation to Ted
Turner. ``You go with what you believe is the story. He knows when
he thinks he has a solid story. All you can do is trust your
people.''

<HEAD>Cardinal Says Clergyman Misquoted, Never Condemned Governor to
Hell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor said Wednesday that a
bishop never condemned Gov. Mario Cuomo to hell but instead told
him his abortion beliefs were contributing to the ``loss of his
soul.''
   Auxiliary Bishop Austin Vaughan, 62, was quoted by news media
last week as saying from the Albany County Jail in Albany that
Cuomo was ``in danger of going to hell if he dies tonight.''
   Vaughan, pastor of St. Patrick's Church in Newburgh, was serving
a 15-day jail sentence for blocking the entrance to a Planned
Parenthood clinic during an anti-abortion protest in Albany last
March.
   Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 presidential candidate, has
said he and his wife accept the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on
abortion in their private life, but that abortion is a matter of a
woman's own conscience. He budgets about $15 million a year in
state funds to pay for abortions for poor women.
   O'Connor had refused to comment on the matter until he could
speak to Vaughan. In a column published Wednesday in the Catholic
New York newspaper, the cardinal said Vaughan assured him he had
been misunderstood.
   ``What the bishop told me he actually said was that the governor
is `quite possibly contributing to the loss of his soul.' To me
that sounds significantly different from `cursing' or `condemning'
the governor to hell,'' O'Connor said.
   The cardinal said Vaughan said he was ``well aware that he has
no power whatsoever to condemn anyone to hell.''
   ``He would agree with the governor completely, that such an
unpleasant task is exclusively the prerogative of a much higher and
wiser power,'' he said.
   Cuomo responded to O'Connor's column with a terse, two-sentence
statement: ``The Cardinal says the Bishop was misquoted. I'm glad.''

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Wednesday
reinstated a suit by a former Los Angeles prosecutor who claimed he
was smeared after objecting to tactics in the ``Twilight Zone''
manslaughter case.
   Gary Kesselman, who was removed as prosecutor in the case
against film director John Landis, sued Los Angeles Deputy District
Attorney Lea D'Agostino, several supervisors and District Attorney
Ira Reiner for defamation, wrongful firing and civil rights
violations over disputes arising from the case.
   U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian had dismissed the suit on
the grounds that the prosecutors were legally immune from suit,
even if Kesselman could prove all of his allegations.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed Wednesday,
returning the case to Tevrizian for more pretrial proceedings.
   Landis and his co-defendants were acquitted in 1987 of
involuntary manslaughter in the deaths of actor Vic Morrow and two
children on the ``Twilight Zone'' movie set in July 1982.
   Kesselman, who was first assigned to prosecute the case, said he
was removed before the trial at his own request, but a supervisor
said he was removed for cause.
   His suit involved testimony by a prosecution witness, Donna
Schuman, that she had disclosed certain information to Kesselman,
who had replied that he had planned to conceal it and spring it on
the defense as a surprise. Kesselman denied the testimony and said
she had never given her the information.
   After that, he said, Ms. D'Agostino and supervisors in the
office began a campaign to harass and discredit him.
   Kesselman, now a private lawyer, also contended he was fired
from the office in retaliation for filing the suit. The county
denied it.
   His dismissal came shortly after his arrest in 1987 for
investigation of lewd conduct. That case ended in a no-contest plea
to disturbing the peace.
   Gregory Petersen, a lawyer for Kesselman, said he expected to
prove that the prosecutor was fired for ``refusing to go along with
the program'' of the office's approach to the case.
   John Collins, a lawyer for the county and the prosecutors whom
Kesselman sued, said he hoped the court would find them immune from
suit for all matters related to presentation of evidence in the
case.

<HEAD>Arafat, Soviet Diplomat Discuss Jewish Emigration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Soviet diplomat told the PLO
leadership Wednesday that Moscow shares its concerns over possible
settlement of Soviet Jews in the Israeli-occupied lands.
   Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Gennadi Tarassov expressed his
views to the PLO's executive committee, Soviet diplomatic sources
in the Tunisian capital said. The committee has been meeting since
Tuesday on the question of Soviet Jewish emigration.
   Tarassov later visited privately with PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
and reiterated his country's support for an independent Palestinian
state, Palestinian sources said.
   The Soviet official also was to meet with Chedli Klibi,
secretary general of the Arab League, who said Monday that Soviet
Jews were being forced to emigrate to Israel against their will.
   Neither Soviet nor Palestinian sources said whether Tarassov
made any commitment to control the departure of Soviet Jews for
Israel.
   The Soviet Union has repeatedly expressed its opposition to
Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where
Palestinian residents have waged a two-year uprising against
Israeli rule.
   Israeli officials have predicted 300,000 Soviet Jews will arrive
in Israeli in the next three years under relaxed Soviet emigration
rules.
   Arafat has called on the Soviet Union to curtail the migration,
while Iraqi President Saddam Hussein of Iraq has accused the United
States of closing its doors to Soviet Jews to force the emigrants
to settle in Israel.
   The United States has a global annual immigration ceiling of
270,000.
   Arafat and other Arab leaders fear that expanded settlement of
Soviet and other Jews in the territories will make a negotiated
peace settlement with Israel more difficult, perhaps impossible.
   Presently about 70,000 Jews live in more that 120 settlements in
the West Bank and Gaza. About 12,000 Soviet Jews arrived in Israel
last year but Israeli officials expect the annual number to soar to
more than 100,000 in the next few years.
   Israel captured the territories in the 1967 Middle East war. The
PLO hopes to establish an independent state in the territories,
whose populations are overwhelmingly Arab.

   President Bush, winning bipartisan acclaim in
Congress, is proposing further deep cuts in U.S. and Soviet troop
strength in Europe and declaring ``that time has come'' to swiftly
conclude agreements limiting conventional, strategic and chemical
weapons.
   ``Today, with communism crumbling, our aim must be to ensure
democracy's advance,'' the president said Wednesday night in a
State of the Union speech that blended his new troop withdrawal
proposal with a pledge to withdraw the remainder of the U.S.
invasion force from Panama by the end of the month.
   In a surprise overture, Bush proposed cutting military manpower
in Europe to 195,000 troops on each side, down from the 275,000
figure that was the U.S. bargaining position at conventional force
negotiations in Vienna.
   The president said he called Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
earlier in the day to inform him of the offer, which already had
been endorsed by NATO allies. The move, Bush said, was a response
to ``the revolution of '89'' in which he said the United States
``stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom.''

   President Bush's nominee to head the nation's

   The Senate Armed Services Committee delayed indefinitely
Wednesday's scheduled vote on the nomination of Victor Stello Jr.,

of energy for defense programs.
   Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and ranking Republican John

investigating Stello.
   ``We did not know how serious the allegations were regarding Mr.
Stello,'' Nunn told reporters after a closed committee meeting

vote ... until such time that we have at least an oral report from
the IG (inspector general).''

<HEAD>Dead Sea Was an Active Trade Route as Far Back as 2,300 Years</HEAD>

   Researchers say the Dead Sea
was a lively commercial center as far back as 2,300 years ago, not
anywhere near like it is today with few boats and only sparse
settlement along the shores.
   The research may also throw new light on the Essenes who lived
in the area, casting doubt on the accepted theory that they were
isolated hermits.
   Arieh Nissenbaum, a geo-chemist, said three stone anchors and
mooring ropes found recently in the Dead Sea were the ``first
datable evidence'' to support the theory that the Dead Sea was an
active place for commerce in the 4th century B.C.
   He said Carbon 14 testing at the Weizmann Institute of Science
in Rehovot on well-preserved fiber rope fragments left open the
possibilty that the anchors were from ships sunk in the first
Middle East oil war.
   ``The Dead Sea was not so dead. This is a misleading name given
to the lake by the British,'' said Gideon Hadas, an Antiquities
Authority archaeologist.
   According to ancient historians, a huge naval battle was fought
in 312 B.C. when Antigonus, the Seleucid ruler of Syria, tried to
seize control of the trade in asphalt, which naturally forms from
evaporating petroleum. He was repelled by the superior archery of
the Nabateans of southern Jordan who were backed by Egypt.
   Although there was uncertainty about the date because of a
100-year margin of error in dating, Nissenbaum said it is possible
that ``the anchors are mute witnesses to that battle.''
   Hadas found the 220-pound anchors along the western shore of the
lake, which at 1,292 feet below sea level is the lowest spot on
earth.
   He said the ropes were well preserved because of the high salt
content of the water and suggested other remains, even wooden
boats, might also be nestling in the seabed.
   Asphalt, which came to the surface in large blocks from fissures
in the seabed, was the prize of ancient traders. Nissenbaum said it
was used as mortar for buildings, an embalming agent in the
Egyptians mummification process, a medicine to treat skin wounds
and as a bug-killer.
   In a new study of Dead Sea shipping, Nissenbaum said that up to
the end of the Crusader era there was active boat traffic on the
lake. Ships ferried wheat and corn grown in southern Jordan along
the 50-mile length of the salt sea to the northern end where roads
led to Jericho and Jerusalem.
   A large Israelite farming community grew at Ein Gedi on the lake
shore and Hasmonean kings built a series of fortresses in the area.
   The Dead Sea region, surrounded by barren mountains and rocky
desert, fell into economic decline after the Crusader period. Today
the only boats on the lake are a few Israeli military patrol craft.
Just a few small settlements occupy its shores, and foreign
visitors come mostly to the health spas that promote the curative
powers, especially for those afflicted with skin diseases, of the
Dead Sea waters and mineral-rich mud.
   Robert Eisenman, chairman of the religious studies department at
California State University in Long Beach, suggests today's image
of the Dead Sea as a lifeless region may be the basis of a
misleading view of the Essenes, keepers of the Dead Sea scrolls.
   Traditional theories about the sect portrays them as a small
isolated community of hermits who sought refuge in a remote
wilderness, but he suggests this may not have been the case.
   His 15-member surveying and mapping expedition recently
completed a study of the Qumran caves at the northern end of the
Dead Sea. It was there that the scrolls dating to the second
century B.C. were discovered in 1947.
   Eisenman said his survey explored 282 desert caves along a
13-mile stretch of coast and found pottery as well as other
evidence of man living in 62 of them. He said a 1952 survey found
only 230 caves in the area and suggested man could live in only 17.
   Eisenman added that his findings indicated there could be more
scroll-bearing caves in the area and that many more had been
inhabitated that originally suggested.
   ``There was a lot of habitation,'' he said, pointing to pottery
shards in front of a large cave half-way up the side of a cliff of
brittle rock shale.
   ``This means it was not isolated like a lot of people think. The
idea of hermetic Essenes contemplating their navels in isolation is
rather peculiar.''

<HEAD>He's Got a Strange Beat for Network Television: Jazz</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Early in its life, ``CBS News Sunday Morning''
aired a profile of jazz pianist and educator Billy Taylor, which
led to a job that made him somewhat of an anomaly in today's
network television.
   ``Sunday Morning'' hired him to regularly chronicle other
jazzfolk and singers, and he pretty much had the field to himself
until last year, when NBC's ``Sunday Today'' hired Jonathan
Schwartz for reports that include jazz.
   This Sunday, Taylor starts his eighth year on CBS' Sunday
program with a report on Marcus Roberts, the pianist for jazz and
classical trumpeter Wynton Marsalis.
   Like more than a few of the people the two-time Emmy winner has
interviewed, Roberts may not be well-known to viewers.
   ``But it's my job to say, `Well, look, here's a guy who's
interesting' _ and they might go and check him out,'' Taylor said.
   Taylor, whose better-known subjects have included Ella
Fitzgerald, Quincy Jones, Maynard Ferguson and Max Roach, was
well-known in musical circles but also no stranger to broadcasting
when hired by CBS.
   In 1958, he was musical director on NBC's ``The Subject Is
Jazz'' series (the band included a pretty good trumpet man name of
Doc Severinson).
   Taylor's other air credits: a jazz history of sorts on ``Captain
Kangaroo''; two National Public Radio series, ``Taylor Made Piano''
and ``Jazz Alive''; musical director on the long-ago ``The David
Frost Show''; a cable series several years ago, ``Jazz
Counterpoint''; and several PBS specials.
   He stays busy. In addition to performing and composing, he also
lectures at colleges and still oversees New York's Jazzmobile
program, which he founded 25 years ago to bring jazz to those who
perhaps can't afford to pay to hear it live.
   He also has recorded extensively, including an album last year
with fellow pianist Ramsey Lewis.
   That Taylor landed what has proved to be his longest-running
tour in television is due, he says, to Shad Northshield and Bud
Lamoreaux, the first executive producer and a senior producer of
CBS' Sunday show, respectively.
   After his appearance on the program, he recalls, ``They said,
`Would you be interested in doing something along those lines with
other people for us?'''
   Oddly enough, Northshield hadn't specifically been looking for a
jazz specialist. The program had a classical music critic and ``it
occurred to me that we should have somebody who does contemporary
music,'' he says. ``But we weren't specific about the kind of
music. Then someone did the piece on him, and he was terrific.''
   Taylor credits the two producers and the broadcast's anchor,
Charles Kuralt, with providing the opportunity for features on
jazz, a subject rarely seen or heard on the major networks these
days.
   Why so? ``Well, most people who produce those kinds of shows are
not as aware as Bud and Shad,'' Taylor says.
   But it also helped that the folksy Kuralt knew the world of
jazz, he adds.
   ``He plays my straight man,'' Taylor says, ``but to be a good
straight man, you really have to know what the answer is.''
   Taylor estimates he averages 14 to 15 jazz features a year on
the CBS program.
   One, he chuckles, was about NBC's Schwartz, the son of a famous
Hollywood composer and a radio cult figure here; in his WNEW-AM
Sunday show, Schwartz learnedly discusses and airs the work of such
singers as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Linda Ronstadt and Maureen
McGovern.
   Most of those Taylor interviews consider him a colleague, he
says, and that helps. But he also has faced the interviewer's
classic nightmare _ a subject who is extremely shy, withdrawn and
generally no fun at all.
   Those can be trying times, he concedes: ``You elaborately set up
a question and think you're going to get a good answer. And then he
just says, `Yeah.'''
   __
   Elsewhere in television...
   ANOTHER REASON TO CONTINUE LIVING: Boxing champ Mike Tyson, in
his second prime-time network appearance since Barbara Walters
interviewed him, will be a referee in the Feb. 23 telecast of what
you might call NBC's version of ``Great Performances'' _ a
wrestling match between Hulk Hogan and ``Macho King'' Randy Savage.
NBC calls the tiff ``The Main Event.''
   NBC, noting that this is its third such gripping event in two
years, quotes Tyson as saying he fears neither Hulk nor Macho Man,
and that, in fact, ``There aren't two men on the planet that I
can't handle.''

<HEAD>Cartoonists Become Hong Kong's Conscience</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cartoonists have become the conscience of Hong
Kong as they acidly etch the desperation felt by a people destined
to live under the flag of Communist China in seven years.
   With politicians bickering and editorial writers anxious not to
irritate the leaders in Beijing, comic strips have become one of
the few platforms where Hong Kong's fears are expressed with often
brutal clarity.
   Just after the crackdown June 4 in Beijing on the democracy
movement, cartoonist Juan Tze drew Premier Li Peng in a bathtub of
blood.
   ``Is it hot enough?'' asked a soldier holding a bucket of
steaming ``people's blood.''
   After Sir Geoffrey Howe, then the British foreign secretary,
told Hong Kong that Britain could not guarantee the territory's
future, Larry Feign, an American expatriate, summed up the feelings
of many.
   ``I don't know who to hate more, Deng Xiaoping or Margaret
Thatcher,'' says one of his comic strip characters.
   After 149 years of British rule, Hong Kong returns to China in
1997. Although Beijing has promised to retain the territory's
free-wheeling economic and social system for 50 years, many of Hong
Kong's 5.7 million people lost faith in that promise after the June
4 crackdown.
   Many also have little confidence in faction-ridden local
politicians, says Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a leading educator and writer
in the colony. Newspapers also practice self-censorship in their
criticism of Beijing, he said.
   ``People look to comic strips as an outlet for their
frustrations,'' Cheng said. ``Their popularity demonstrates that we
have a solid groundswell of anti-communist, anti-China feeling,
especially after June 4.''
   Adds Feign: ``Cartoons appeal to the Chinese because you can get
your meaning across indirectly.''
   Cheng said that only in the last few years have comic strips
become an important political outlet in Hong Kong. A recent
exhibition of cartoons at the Hong Kong Arts Centre drew 40,000
people over several weeks.
   Feign and Juan are perhaps the two best known cartoonists in the
colony.
   Frenetic and balding, Feign, 34, is author of a comic strip for
the English-language South China Morning Post called ``The World of
Lily Wong.''
   For the five years since he moved to Hong Kong from Orange
County in California with his Chinese wife, Feign has charted the
lives of Lily, a smart, sexy Hong Kong woman, and Stuart Wright, a
bumbling but good-hearted American.
   Stuart wants to marry Lily and give her the passport she covets
but Lily isn't in love and so far has refused him. Through their
relationship, Feign explores the often blatant racism inflicted on
Chinese by Westerners. He also pokes fun at the ways Chinese view
Westerners, known as ``devils'' in Cantonese.
   A tall man, with the comportment of a Mandarin official in old
China's imperial court, Juan is more self-consciously political
than Feign.
   He grew up during Hong Kong's most turbulent times and remembers
watching the bloody anti-British riots in 1967 from a rickety
balcony on his tenement home. He began drawing comics as an art
student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in the 1970s.
   He took a page from early 20th century Chinese history, during
which cartoons were a popular form of political agitation, and
decided to use comics to fight for Hong Kong's common man. He went
to work at the Chinese-language Ming Pao.
   ``My generation is different from my parents','' said Juan, now
33. ``They came from China and are concerned with basic things like
food and money. We are searching for other things, from the
spirit.''
   When China recently announced its opposition to a British plan
to give passports to key Hong Kong professionals and officials,
Juan drew a man sitting on his bed, his birth certificate, identity
card and passport scattered beneath him. ``Who am I? Who am I?''
the man screamed as his wife snored beside him.
   ``We have an identity crisis in Hong Kong,'' Juan said. ``London
and Beijing are deciding our fate and we can't influence them. I
wanted to describe our feeling of hopelessness.''
   Following the crackdown in Beijing, Juan drew Chinese Premier Li
Peng explaining why tanks were used to put down the rebellion. ``We
ran out of cars,'' Li tells a visitor.
   Another strip shows an Englishman offering Hong Kong on a fork
into the drooling mouth of a corrupt Chinese cadre. ``Be a brave
Chinaman,'' the Englishman says.
   Juan, who hopes to stay in Hong Kong after 1997, has recently
published a book of his work, ``Black Goods.''
   ``I guess the Chinese might call me a counterrevolutionary,'' he
said with a wry smile. ``I'm just helping them gather proof.''
   If Juan expresses the desperation of Hong Kong, Feign captures
the absurdity of its life.
   Living on the cusp of two worlds _ Hong Kong Chinese and Western
expatriate _ Feign has a unique vantage point.
   ``In the beginning, my position gave me a chance to pull off a
lot of good gags,'' said Feign. ``But now as things get serious I
find it harder to draw. It's becoming a tragedy.''

<HEAD>Guerrilla Sabotage Putting Peru's Lights Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW SCOTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost every night, in a deserted field or on
a mountainside, a charge of dynamite goes off and Peruvians' lights
go out.
   The sabotage of high-tension pylons by leftist guerrillas who
call themselves, ironically, the Shining Path is plunging Peruvians
into darkness and cutting dangerously into the nation's industrial
output.
   Power rationing has become a daily headache for millions of
people in Lima and other major cities that depend on hydroelectric
power that is brought over the Andes.
   Lima has a new sound _ the almost constant hum of thousands of
portable gasoline generators.
   Its streets are in almost constant gridlock because traffic
lights are out. Restaurants and housewives complain of food
spoiling because refrigerators aren't working.
   Landlords are slashing rents for the upper floors of highrise
apartment buildings to entice renters worried about climbing the
stairs when elevators stop.
   Since July 28, 1980, when the first high-tension pylon was blown
up in the mountains near Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima _ as
President Fernando Belaunde Terry was giving his state-of-the-union
address _ 1,205 towers have fallen, according to the state power
company Electroperu.
   A total of 335 were felled last year alone and more than 100
have been toppled since municipal elections in November, when the
rebels blew up 80 in one week in an effort _ largely unsuccessful,
as it turned out _ to disrupt the voting.
   The rainy season that lasts from January to May in the highlands
is making it difficult for repair crews to reach toppled towers,
and Electroperu says it does not know how long power rationing,
which began in mid-November, will continue.
   ``The whole system is in a shambles,'' said Jose Dibos of the
National Industrial Society. ``We are running into an almost
continuous situation where power outages have to be accepted as a
way of life.''
   The Shining Path took up arms in 1980 to bring down Peru's
elected government and install a peasant-worker state patterned on
the ideas of Mao Tse-tung of China.
   The government says more than 17,500 people have died in the
violence and economic costs have surpassed $15 billion.
   Damage to the electrical system has cost the country more than
$600 million, including repairs and lost electrical output,
according to Electroperu. The company says it costs about $20,000
to replace a tower.
   The Industrial Society's Dibos said the electric company has
been able to maintain a ``precarious balance'' only because
industries are operating at 50 percent of capacity due to the
country's economic problems, which included 2,775 percent inflation
last year and a 12 percent drop in the gross domestic product.
   But he said the damaged power grid is a ``time bomb'' that is
costing industry millions of dollars in lost production and ruined
materials and equipment.
   One of the hardest hit areas is the glass industry, whose ovens
need a continous supply of power to allow for the slow heating and
cooling required to make glass.
   The Industrial Society says glass production has dropped by half.
   ``It's almost impossible for an industrial user to predict when
he is going to get power and for how long,'' Dibos said.
   Most of the power supplied to Lima, where a third of Peru's 22
million people live, comes from Electroperu's hydroelectric dam on
the Mantaro River in a mountain valley 165 miles east of Lima.
   Three interconnected lines carry power over the Andes to the
coast, each passing through guerrilla country. One of the three has
been down since 1987, when Electroperu withdrew its repair crews
after guerrillas burned 10 company trucks and threatened to kill
workers if they returned.
   An Electroperu spokesman, Jose Acevedo, said repair crews on the
other two lines know they are being watched.
   ``They watch them from a distance, and as soon as they finish
raising a tower, the terrorists come in and blow up another one,''
he said.
   Acevedo said one tower was felled six times before the army
strung barbed wire and planted land mines around it.

<HEAD>Underpinnings of U.S. Military Jolted by Breakup of Soviet Empire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cracking of the communist East bloc has
opened a path to profound change in U.S. defenses, and the fallout
for military chiefs and soldiers, weapons makers, political leaders
and taxpayers is just coming into view.
   ``A revolution in military affairs could be in the making,''
says William Kaufmann of the Brookings Institution think tank and a
frequent consultant to the Pentagon.
   The precise features of this transformation are fuzzy but the
direction is clear: smaller Pentagon budgets, fewer troops and a
shrinking pipeline of new weapons.
   The most frequently asked questions now are how radically will
the military be reshaped, and will Congress switch defense dollars
to social programs such as housing and education that were squeezed
during the Reagan administration's military buildup?
   Military planners already are rethinking traditional defense
strategies _ while trying to hold together the North Atlantic
alliance _ since few now believe the fractured Warsaw Pact armies
pose a major threat to Western security. The glue that has kept
NATO together for 40 years is fear of a surprise Soviet invasion of
Western Europe. With those fears now fading, will NATO come unstuck?
   While even the Pentagon's biggest supporters in Congress see
more relaxed East-West relations, some caution against assuming
that democratic reforms and moves toward free-market economies in
Eastern Europe would last if Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
was ousted.
   ``A return to past Soviet behavior is the biggest risk we must
consider in reordering our priorities and restructuring our own
defenses,'' Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the ranking Republican on
the Senate Armed Services Committee, said recently.
   Even so, the new world order means running a new-look U.S.
military on less money _ perhaps a lot less. President Bush
proposed to Congress a slight trimming of defense spending, to $292
billion, for the budget year starting Oct. 1. Pressures are great
on Capitol Hill to wield an even heavier ax.
   ``The reality is that we must plan on our defense budget going
down several percentage points every year for the foreseeable
future,'' says Gen. Colin L. Powell, the top U.S. military officer
as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Kaufmann says military spending by 1999 should be cut to half
today's level.
   The new austerity, in turn, translates to tougher times for
military contractors. The arms industry boomed during the Reagan
administration and now employs one in five of the nation's
manufacturing workers and one-third of scientists and engineers.
The boom may not bust, but some industry workers and their
communities already see reason to worry about layoffs and pay cuts.
   ``There can be a dark side'' to the outbreak of peace, Ohio Gov.
Richard Celeste said at a special conference of small- and
medium-size military contractors Jan. 24.
   The jobs of about 200,000 Ohio residents depend on the defense
industry. Other states, including California, Virginia, Washington,
Maryland and Missouri, are even more closely linked to the health
of military contractors.
   The bright side, in the view of many economists and defense
analysts, is that the expected Pentagon savings during the 1990s
could be converted to a ``peace dividend'' _ money to combat
homelessness, build new schools, repair old roads and bridges,
intensify medical research, combat drug abuse or cut taxes.
   The Bush administration, however, sees two holes in the ``peace
dividend'' theory. First, it says, no major savings should be
expected until new arms control deals are struck and the
pro-democracy movement in Eastern Europe gains a firmer footing.
Secondly, huge bills for correcting mistakes of the past, such as
untold levels of contamination from nuclear weapons plants, will
come due in the 1990s.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, presenting details of the
proposed 1991 budget, said: ``The peace dividend is peace,''
meaning the huge military investments of the past have bought a
more secure international order, but that drastically reducing
future military spending could undermine that security.
   That line of thinking, and Bush's cautious nature, will surely
face a severe test in the Democrat-controlled Congress, where
debate over spending priorities in light of a retreating Soviet
military menace already is under way.
   Some of the biggest squabbles are expected to focus on Bush's
desire to preserve the expensive strategic nuclear program. The
president's 1991 budget adds $900 million for research on the Star
Wars missile defense project and spares the multibillion-dollar B-2
stealth bomber program and the Navy's aircraft carrier battle
groups.
   Another likely ``big-ticket'' target for Congress is the
administration's request for $363 million to start building two
nuclear reactors in Idaho and South Carolina to produce tritium, a
radioactive gas used to make nuclear warheads. Critics say tritium
supplies already are adequate to meet future needs, so the $7
billion or more needed to complete the new reactors is
unjustifiable.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., says the administration may be forced to
scrap plans to expand the nuclear bomb factories.
   ``This is going to put a much heavier burden of proof on those
who want to spend for new facilities,'' says Wyden, who advocates
opening U.S.-Soviet negotiations to ban the production of
plutonium, a key ingredient in nuclear weapons.
   Perhaps the fiercest fight of all will be over base closings.
Bush's budget calls for shutting down or consolidating about 55
bases. Cheney offered no estimate of savings but said fewer bases
will be needed as troop strength is reduced.
   The outcome of these debates is likely to influence not only the
future shape of U.S. defenses, but also the fortunes of military
supply and consulting companies and their hundreds of thousands of
employees.
   ``There is a shakeout taking place in the industry,'' says
Jacques Gansler, senior vice president of Analytic Sciences Corp.,
a defense contractor.
   The prospect of large job losses has given new prominence to
debate in Congress over ``economic conversion'' legislation aimed
at helping defense company managers and workers switch from
production of military hardware to civilian items.
   Critics of this approach say the economy can cope without new
help from the government. They note that in the eight years
following the 1968 peak in defense spending during the Vietnam War,
the military budget was slashed 37 percent.
   ``While there was pain and suffering, we managed it,'' said
Kaufmann of the Brookings Institution.

<HEAD>Bush Wins Round 1 of Political Season; Democrats Try To Shift
Focus</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush led with his high cards,
defense, foreign policy and the remnants of the Cold War.
Democratic leaders praised the president, conceded the hand, and
set about changing the subject.
   Bush's State of the Union response to the chain reaction
``revolution of '89'' in Eastern Europe foretells the American
politics of the '90s.
   Any president has the upper hand when the issues are national
defense and foreign affairs, and, for most of the past generation,
those have been Republican issues.
   The Democrats usually make their case on domestic matters. Even
with Bush's poll popularity at record highs, the voters say they
think Democrats can do a better job in dealing with problems at
home.
   With the eased threat from Moscow and the disintegration of its
satellite bloc, Democrats think they can shift the voter focus,
beginning with this year's election campaign and looking toward the
presidential elections of 1992 and 1996.
   That would put the emphasis on future campaigns on their strong
suit. It would, presumably, spare their future presidential
nominees the kind of ridicule Gov. Michael Dukakis faced in 1988
after he was photographed with his helmeted head jutting up from
the turret of a tank. At a campaign reunion, Bush jokingly thanked
his 1988 advisers for keeping him out of tanks.
   Now, 10 days into the new session of Congress, the political
advantage belongs to Bush. He won, unexpectedly, with the Senate
minority he needed to uphold a veto of a bill extending the U.S.
visas of Chinese students, a step he said he had taken anyhow. Then
came his two major messages of the year, the new budget on Monday,
the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on
Wednesday night.
   Leaving budget bogymen and fine print problems for later, the
president issued his surprise call to subtract an additional 80,000
soldiers each from the U.S.-Soviet troop cuts in Europe that are
being negotiated.
   Even Democrats who had denounced his budget harmonized in praise
of that proposal, outlined hours after Bush had telephoned Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to tell him about it.
   That is the kind of diplomatic drama a president can deliver.
The Democrats have nothing to match it.
   The budget and domestic priorities are politically contested
terrain. Nobody is quarreling about troop cuts. And the democratic
upheavals that made them practical work to Bush's advantage, even
though the United States was not directly involved in the changes
that swept Eastern Europe.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said the conditions and
commitments that led to the disintegration of the Communist empire
in Europe were the work of presidents, Congresses and American
servicemen from Harry Truman's time.
   That counts the Democrats in for a share of the credit, but Bush
is the major political beneficiary, simply because he was president
when it happened.
   So the Democratic emphasis is on change at home. ``There are new
realities to be grasped, new challenges to be met, and very
different battles to be won,'' Foley said in the Democratic
response to Bush.
   ``In the 1990s, and well into the next century, the central
challenge for America will be economic, not military,'' he said.
``The greatest test of our strength will be in our classrooms, not
our missile silos. The gravest threat will come not from any
nation's attempt at world domination, but from every nation's
complicity in the worldwide destruction of the environment.''
   Those are problems indeed, and there are more built into the
Bush budget, deficits now, soaring federal liabilities later. Those
domestic headaches may well rearm the Democrats.
   But Bush is in charge at a time of chain reaction international
change ``so striking that it marks the beginning of a new era in
the world's affairs.'' Last spring, Democrats were complaining that
he was passively yielding the stage to Gorbachev, failing to
respond to Moscow peace initiatives. He silenced that with his
first proposal for troop cuts, delivered to the NATO summit at the
end of May. Now Bush holds the initiative.
   The first round of the 1990 political season is his. But only
the first, and it's a long season.

<HEAD>Study: Dolls May Be Overrated In Child Abuse Cases</HEAD>

   The 5-year-old girl tossed her hair, twisted around
in the chair, rolled her head, raised her arms, stood up and sat
down again, all the while dutifully answering questions from the
nice lady with the rag doll.
   A camera rolled behind a two-way mirror as the two went through
a delicate procedure that has become vital in prosecution of child
abuse cases.
   The lady told the girl that sometimes unpleasant things happen
to little children and maybe they could talk about it. She pulled
out a clothed, rag doll with hair of yarn _ and anatomical details
such as breasts and genitals.
   Together, the child and interviewer pointed to the different
body parts. No, no one had ever touched her there, said the child,
pointing. She was sure. Despite physical evidence of abuse, the
little girl wasn't talking that day.
   In recent years, the use of anatomical dolls has grown as more
child abuse cases are prosecuted. But a new study shows that the
dolls' effectiveness in aiding a child's memory may be overrated.
   ``These dolls have become very popular because some
psychologists believe they do something magical, eliciting
information they otherwise couldn't get at,'' said Bruce Forman, a
University of Miami psychologist. ``But our findings indicate
that's probably not so.''
   Anatomical dolls became available in the late 1970s and early
1980s and now are common in social workers' and prosecutors'
offices and police agencies. The dolls, costing up to $75, have
evolved from crude, unclothed figures to less-threatening, more
realistic ones with underwear and bright clothes.
   Experts agree that the dolls can help some children tell what
happened to them, especially those who are very young or are
embarrassed to talk about the incident. But the evidence is less
clear in terms of what interview tool helps get the best
information from an abused child and what is normal behavior.
   ``Clinically, many believe the dolls have a place in evaluating
suspected abused kids that cannot be taken over by another tool,''
said Mark Everson, a psychologist and co-director of the clinical
research program on childhood maltreatment at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
   In a study of whether dolls' anatomical explicitness would lead
a non-abused child to act out in a sexually suggestive manner,
Everson found that 6 percent of more than 200 children aged 2-5
showed fairly clear sexual acts with the dolls during an interview,
even when there was no history of abuse.
   In the Miami study, 45 children, aged 8 and 9, viewed a
12-minute film often used in sexual-abuse awareness programs. One
group later told what they remembered verbally, another by drawing
pictures and a third with the dolls.
   ``We found no significant difference in accuracy or completeness
of information recalled,'' Forman said. The results of the study
will be published in the journal ``Social Behavior and
Personality.''
   In another study, of 32 girls aged 5-8, the Miami researchers
found that abused girls showed somewhat more aggression and sexual
play with the dolls if an observer was not in the room than did
non-abused girls. With an adult in the room, there was little
difference between the two groups, Forman said.
   However, not all of the abused girls showed increased agression
and sexual play, indicating a need for more research on what is
normal behavior, he said.
   ``From our work, we know that children who have not been abused
display some curiosity about sexual body parts, and that's normal
and healthy when it appears at the appropriate age.'' It is
important, he added, that aggression shown by a child doesn't
necessarily imply a history of sexual abuse.
   ``We've only scratched the surface of how children react. There
are still a lot of questions,'' he said.
   Although much has been made of the potential for
over-interpretation of children's interaction with anatomical
dolls, they have become an integral part of child-abuse
investigations and the prosecution of mass child abuse cases.
   Videotaped interviews of children with the dolls was among
evidence used to convict Frank Fuster Escalona in 1985 in one of
Florida's most notorious cases, involving the abuse of children at
a baby-sitting service in Dade County. The story was retold
recently in the TV movie ``Unspeakable Acts.''
   Fuster is serving six consecutive life sentences. His wife,
Ileana, was also convicted in the so-called Country Walk case,
which involved allegations of nude sex games and satanic animal
sacrifices. She served about four years of a 10-year sentence and
was deported to her native Honduras.
   Among defense criticisms was that children had been manipulated
during the interviews and that using the dolls was inappropriate,
said John Hogan, lead prosecutor. ``Obviously the jury didn't put
much credence in that.''
   In California, defense attorneys also made an issue of how
children were interviewed in the McMartin Preschool molestation
case. Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were
acquitted last month of almost all charges linked to the alleged
molestation of 11 children at the now-defunct school in Manhattan
Beach, a suburb of Los Angeles.
   Mary Emmons, executive director of Children's Institute
International, where the children were interviewed, said defense
attorneys were just doing their job in attacking the methods. ``For
the most part, the methods used by mental health professionals are
well-stablished clinical methods designed to aid children in
telling what may or may not have happened,'' she said.
   Others in the field echo that sentiment.
   ``I have seen some criticism of use of the dolls ... and frankly
it all gets blown out of proportion,'' said Patricia Toth, of the
National Center for Prosecution of Child Abuse, a nonprofit group
based in Alexandria, Va.
   ``People latch onto the dolls as if they're responsible for
conviction of innocent people,'' Toth said. ``I truly don't think
they have the impact people attach to them. Dolls in and of
themselves don't make the case.''
   At the Children's Center in Miami, run by the Dade State
Attorney's Office, dolls play a prominent role in interviews. They
are primarily used for showing exactly what happened after a child
has already talked about an incident, said Teresa Pooler, an
assistant state attorney and director of the center.
   The center, founded in December 1986 after the Country Walk
case, has about 18 dolls in adult, child and toddler size. The
females have vaginas and breasts and the males have penises. An
average of 70 children are interviewed a month.
   ``We use the dolls for demonstrative purposes, not for diagnosis
as to whether something in fact occurred,'' said Pooler, adding
children often have different names for body parts and difficulty
with spatial relationships.
   ``I think anything that can be used to elicit a statement from a
child is a positive thing,'' she said, ``provided it's used
properly.''

<HEAD>Japanese Doctors Admit Patients' Right to Death with Dignity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese doctors, long regarded as too exalted to
be questioned, are changing their guidelines to give patients more
information about diseases like cancer and more say in
life-and-death decisions.
   Under pressure from new patients' rights groups, the Japan
Medical Association surveyed doctors about such ``informed
consent'' issues as terminal patients' right to stop treatment. The
results, showing most doctors willing to open up to patients, were
released in January accompanied by recommendations that doctors
should give more information to cancer patients and that terminally
ill patients should have a right to refuse treatment.
   ``I've seen patients with uncurable disease and cancer at final
stages, tied to machines and living in pain, and I refuse to be
kept alive like that,'' said Keinosuke Miyaji, spokesman the
Association for Death With Dignity, whose 7,300 members have signed
wills expressing their wishes in such cases.
   ``If I had cancer, I would like to know, by all means. My own
experiences with my husband made me think that knowing the truth
makes a big difference,'' said Ayako Katsunuma, whose husband,
Haruo, a doctor, died of lung cancer five years ago. ``Before the
surgery, my husband said he wanted just six more months to live, so
that he could ... complete unfinished work, and he did.''
   Haruo Katsunuma asked his doctors for the truth, and that
enabled the couple to make their remaining days together
worthwhile, Mrs. Katsunuma said. ``It also released some of my
mental suffering. Hiding the truth must be so stressful for other
family members.''
   Interest in patients' rights has been growing for years and was
given new impetus by widespread publicity of strenuous efforts to
treat Emperor Hirohito, whose final illness lasted more than three
months. After his death on Jan. 7, 1989, doctors disclosed that the
emperor hadn't been told he had cancer.
   In a country where doctors were held in awe, patients have
believed they should not bother physicians with ``silly''
questions. Doctors generally didn't explain fully the treatment
they provided or even how bad ailments were.
   However, in the medical association survey last summer of 1,607
doctors, 70.7 percent agreed they should respect patients' wishes;
16.3 percent urged the legalization of patthe right to die in
accordance with patients' wishes; and 7.3 percent said they must
always keep patients alive.
   Nonetheless, the medical association said cancer patients should
be told the truth only if they are strong enough to face reality
and their cancer is at an early stage. And Chairman Ichiro Kato
said it is ``not illegal'' for doctors to agree to let a terminally
ill patient die, they should provide information on the dangers of
treatment and on alternatives to those who are less ill.
   The association's report also said doctors bear no legal
responsibility when a patient refuses a transfusion for religious
reasons; if the patient is a child and a parent refuses a
transfusion for the child, a transfusion can be given against the
parents' wishes.
   While the report said patients could refuse doctors'
suggestions, it said that ``doctors and patients are not equal, and
doctors should take initiative as professionals with specialized
knowledge and experience.''
   Shizuko Kiba, who studies terminal care, said doctors have
overwhelmingly focused on medical technology and ignored patients'
feelings. ``Medical care is for patients, and its purpose,
especially for those at the final stage of their lives, should be
to relieve pain and let them live like humans,'' she said.
   When patients asked if they had cancer _ the leading cause of
death in Japan _ doctors almost always used to deny it, believing
the truth would hurt the patients' morale. ``But patients often
know that no means yes,'' Ms. Kiba said. ``The important thing is
communication between patients and doctors, through which patients
can learn the truth themselves naturally.''
   ``Informed consent'' requires communication, agreed Kazumasa
Hoshino, a medical professor at Kyoto University. ``It is almost
impossible when a patient steps into the room for the first time,
when we know nothing about each other.''

<HEAD>Penn Biologist Helps Restore Tropical Forest
^With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By A.J. HOSTETLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Daniel Janzen set out to teach people
to restore depleted tropical forests, he didn't think he'd be a
driving instructor.
   ``What I'm teaching is stuff that is a combination of academic
things and what we regard as the ordinary things about running an
ordinary life,'' Janzen said during an interview in his University
of Pennsylvania office amid tropical seed and fruit specimens,
popcorn, and Pepperidge Farm cookies.
   ``You spend two hours in the afternoon talking about how to tell
a beetle from a bug and then an hour and a half on driving lessons.
You mix the biological aspects with the practical aspects.''
   Janzen, 50, spends four months of the year teaching biology and
the rest in Costa Rica, guiding efforts to save its dwindling
tropical dry forests. He also helped raise more than $24 million to
buy 158 square miles of forests that in July was formally dedicated
as Guanacaste National Park.
   In October 1988, Janzen began training Costa Ricans to survey
the park's plant and animal life and to teach others the
techniques. There are 175 species of birds, 700 of plants, 3,140 of
moths and butterflies and 13,000 of insects, so the inventory alone
will take about 10 years to complete.
   Janzen practices a new field called restoration ecology, which
tries to return areas to their condition before they were damaged
by humans. He hopes to raise $30 million for the National
Biodiversity Institute of Costa Rica. Among the biggest
contributors have been the Costa Rican and Swedish governments, the
Pew Charitable Trusts in Philadelphia and the MacArthur Foundation,
which honored him with one of its ``genius awards'' earlier this
year.
   The program does not use American volunteers, although some of
Janzen's students at Penn have asked if they could join it; he
refused, he said, because that would mean fewer Costa Ricans would
be involved in the work.
   ``Costa Ricans develop a feeling of ownership. That's the link
you want. You want the members of the society to feel that the park
is actually theirs, so that when it's threatened, at some later
time, they then feel the threat is a personal threat.''
   The project got its start in 1985, when Costa Rican officials
discovered that the Corcovado National Park was threatened by about
1,200 gold miners, who had caused widespread ecological damage. The
officials asked Janzen to find out why the miners had breached the
park's traditionally respected boundaries. He discovered that the
miners had moved their operations into the forests because they
felt the land belonged to no one. He realized if the country's
resources were to be saved, Costa Ricans had to take pride in the
forests. Since then, Costa Rica _ about the size of West Virginia _
has devoted more than a quarter of its area to natural parks, more
than any of its Latin American neighbors.
   Janzen, a Minnesota native, has spent more than 26 years in
Costa Rica, drawn by its diverse plant and animal life. Helping to
plan a national park, however, gave the field scientist a new
challenge.
   ``As soon as you start planning a park and thinking about its
biological properties, you immediately realize that the real
challenge is not the biology, but the human administration,'' he
said. ``You can't just put an advertisement in the newspaper like
you can here and out of the woodwork comes 25 people who've already
got master's degrees in resource management.''
   Janzen carefully describes his role as a guide. ``My role is
teaching particular courses and being somewhat of an advisor for
some aspects of the administration of the park. I become part of
the process of making decisions, but I don't make decisions.''
   Those decisions are made by Costa Rican officials, who Janzen
said are very aware of the environmental impact their decisions
could have, an awareness he attributes in large part to the
country's size. Costa Ricans can't escape the problems by moving,
as Americans once did, he said.
   Janzen credits Costa Rican President Oscar Arias with
encouraging the country to put one-fourth of its natural resources
aside. ``Costa Rica pretty much understands what they want to do...
They know what the recipe is.''

<HEAD>Antibiotic With OTC Drug Best Against Travelers' Diarrhea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new suggests that combining an antibiotic with
an over-the-counter drug can reduce the duration of travelers'
diarrhea to just an hour, from an average of 34 hours with the best
known previous therapy.
   ``We never dreamed it would work so well. It was marvelous,''
said Dr. Charles D. Ericsson, who with Dr. Herbert L. DuPont led a
team of researchers at the University of Texas Medical School at
Houston.
   The researchers tested five different treatments _ including a
placebo, or inactive medication _ among 227 U.S. college students
who suffered from acute diarrhea while attending summer school in
Guadalajara, Mexico.
   The quickest relief came from combining the antibiotic
sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, marketed as Septra and Bactrim, with
the over-the-counter drug loperamide, marketed as Immodium AD, the
researchers said.
   Subjects took the antibiotic in tablet form twice a day for
three days, and an initial two-tablet dose of loperamide, Ericsson
said. One additional tablet of loperamide was taken after each
loose bowel movement.
   The average duration of diarrhea was an hour or less with the
combination of drugs, vs. 34 hours using the previous best therapy,
the antibiotic alone, said Ericsson. In the control group, the
average duration was 59 hours.
   Less effective were the other three approaches tested: a single
large dose of the antibiotic; two-a-day doses of the antibiotic
over three days; and the over-the-counter drug alone, the
researchers found. Their findings were reported in the Journal of
the American Medical Association.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Microchip Implant Survived a Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Silicon microchips implanted into rats'
feet survived a year and linked with nerve tissue, a step
researchers say could in several decades lead to the development of
bionic limbs.
   ``The goal of this project is to make an interface, a direct
connection, between the human nervous system and machines'' or
prostheses, said Greg Kovacs, a Stanford University electrical
engineer and medical student.
   Two quarter-sized radio transceivers, one at the stump of the
severed part of the human body and connected to the chip and the
other on the outside of the artificial limb, could relay
information by radio, Kovacs said.
   The main challenge for scientists is being able to take the
signals sent from the brain and interpret and process them into
information that can be fed into the prosthesis' circuits, probably
through a computer. Such a system is far in the future, warned
Kovacs and three colleagues, who last year implanted a tiny chip
between the severed ends of foot nerves in a half dozen rats.
   Nerve fibers regenerated through holes in the chip, and the
researchers were eventually able to stimulate activity by sending
signals through the chip.
   Kovacs said the holes in the chips were small enough that only
single nerves or small clusters grew in each pathway. The chips
probably will not be useful in reconnecting severed limbs or other
body parts, he said, because of the irreversible damage generally
caused by the cutting.

<HEAD>Can Dogs Warn of Imminent Epileptic Seizure? Study Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intrigued by stories of two dogs who reportedly
could sense that their masters were about to have epileptic
seizures, researchers are looking for other dogs who appear to have
that ability.
   If dogs can be trained to give warnings, they might make life
easier for people with epilepsy by giving them time to take
precautions to avoid injury during the seizure, said Reina Berner,
executive director of the Epilepsy Institute in New York.
   As a result, some people with epilepsy could become less fearful
of having seizures in public, and so begin to lead less restricted
lives, she said.
   The institute hopes to find three to five dogs who appear to
have the ability, so the animals can be formally tested. If it
appears, researchers hope to find out how they do it, so other dogs
can be trained, Berner said.
   The testing would involve monitoring brain waves of a volunteer
to watch for the signal of an impending seizure, and noting if and
when the dog senses the seizure coming.
   Berner said she had heard of one dog in Washington, D.C., who
could sense seizures in a girl, and had met a second such dog and
its owner. The owner said that while she was taking a shower, the
dog had predicted an oncoming seizure by barking even though the
animal was outside the closed bathroom door.
   Both dogs had been trained to work for people using wheelchairs,
she said. In addition, both appeared able to predict not only grand
mal seizures, which make a person collapse, but also complex
partial seizures, in which a person becomes semi-concious and
lapses into such simple behavior as walking.

gauge rose in December at its fastest pace in eight months, the
government said.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday the Index of Leading
Economic Indicators rose 0.8 percent in December, helping to move
the forecasting gauge up 0.4 percent for the year. It was the
weakest performance since the index fell 1.5 percent in 1984.
   The rise for the year compared with an increase of 3.9 percent
for 1988, and suggests the economy could be more sluggish this year

<HEAD>Judge Approves Eastern's Request for More Funds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines, struggling to rebuild as a
smaller carrier under bankruptcy court supervision, has received a
$50 million infusion to help fund its operations through February.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland on Wednesday approved
Eastern's request for $50 million to be taken out of escrow funds,
which contain around $600 million raised from recent sales of
Eastern assets.
   Lifland's approval came a day after a committee of Eastern's
preferred shareholders advocated the liquidation or outright sale
of the airline and said a $40 million advance should be enough to
cover the next month.
   Eastern's management issued a memo to its employees Wednesday
dismissing the preferred shareholders' salvo and persistent rumors
of a possible Chapter 7 liquidation.
   At Wednesday's hearing, attorneys representing the preferred
shareholders raised their estimate of Eastern's current needs to
$42 million, based on new data provided by the carrier. But the
shareholders, to whom Eastern owes $1.175 billion, didn't soften
their opposition to the airline's latest reorganization proposal.
   Eastern filed a new plan with the court late last week in which
it proposed to pay preferred holders no more than 10 cents on the
dollar in the form of new stock. Previously, Eastern had promised
to repay its creditors in full.
   ``We think that a new direction or directions have to be
explored for this airline,'' Robert Miller, an attorney for the
preferred shareholders' committee, said Wednesday in a telephone
interview. He said the committee might take further legal action,
but declined to elaborate.
   In papers filed Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the
shareholders' committee said it had lost faith in Eastern's
management because it was ``cannibalizing'' the airline by selling
assets.
   Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
suggested in a private meeting Tuesday with airline analysts that
he could merge Eastern and its sister carrier Continental Airlines,
according to unidentified analysts quoted in the Los Angeles Times
and the Washington Post.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent said Wednesday a merger between
Houston-based Continental and Miami-based Eastern continues to be
one of a range of possible options that could be considered. He
said Lorenzo's statements to the analysts were in line with his
previous public positions.
   Frank Ortis, president of Machinists union Local 702 in Miami,
said Lifland and Eastern's creditors likely would object to a
merger between non-union Continental and Eastern.
   ``I can't believe anybody would allow them to do that because
Continental is almost as shaky as Eastern,'' Ortis said. ``The only
sensible solution is to sell it to us and let us have a shot at
having a profitable airline.''
   In its memo to employees, Eastern said, ``We expected this type
of reaction from the preferred stockholders' committee. They are
trying to build pressure in an attempt to improve their position.''
   The memo, obtained by NBC's Miami affiliate WTVJ, said
liquidation was not in the interest of the creditors or Eastern.
   But some travel agents responded to the latest developments by
advising customers not to fly Eastern.
   ``There could be a lot more people stranded this time,'' said
agent Nancy Redlus of Sunshine Holiday Travel in downtown Miami.
``Right now, I don't know what's going to happen to the airline,
what's going to happen to them tomorrow.''
   The Machinists union has been on strike against Eastern since
last March 4. It was joined in sympathy walkouts by pilots and
flight attendants, forcing the airline into bankruptcy court
protection on March 9. The pilots and flight attendants abandoned
their strikes just before Thanksgiving, but Eastern has rebuilt as
a smaller carrier and hired mostly non-union workers to replace the
strikers.
   Lifland's approval for Eastern to withdraw the $50 million was
the fourth such request granted since the Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceeding began. The three previous drawdowns totaled $210 million.
   In addition to paying preferred shareholders no more than 10
cents on the dollar, Eastern's new reorganization proposal also
calls for paying unsecured crs only 10 percent of their debts in
cash when the airline emerges from bankruptrotection, and another
70 percent over the following 10 years, without interest In return
for accepting partial repayment, Texas Air would give the unsecured
creditors 40 percent of Easteruity.
   Under Eastern's two previous plans, unsecured creditors were to
be rd in full with interest at the completion of Chapter 11.
Eastern owes the unseccreditors, primarily trade suppliers such as
aircraft manufacturers, around $1.1 billion.
   The committee representing unsecured creditors so far has
reserjudgment on Eastern's new plan. Adam Harris, an the committee,
declined comment Wednesday on the shareholders' position and
Lifland's decision to grant the $50 million.
   Lawyers represend striking Machinists had asked at the hearing
ithdrawn by Eastern be matched by a contribution from Texas Air.

   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s new leader plans
to attack a morale problem at the Wall Street brokerage, but the
sorry state of the securities industry may prove a bigger obstacle
to reversing the firm's fortunes.
   Like other brokerages hurt by an industry-wide recession,
Shearson is extending staff cuts into the ranks of its highly paid
investment bankers, sources at the firm said.
   The cuts _ which one investment banker said could total 50 to
100 professionals by the end of May, or 10 percent to 20 percent of
the division, _ were initiated before this week's tumult
surrounding the resignation of chairman Peter A. Cohen.
   On Wednesday, parent American Express Co. took steps to bolster
Shearson's financial footing amid signs that the travel and credit
card giant would exert tighter control over the firm.
   Shearson's newly appointed president and chief executive
officer, Howard L. Clark Jr., a former American Express executive,
said his near-term goal is to complete an $850 million
recapitalization program that will preserve the firm's credit
rating.
   In a telephone interview, Clark said that in an effort to
reassure Shearson employees that the turmoil was ending he would
``get out and see the employees and management and retail system. I
will be doing a lot of that.''
   That would contrast sharply with the tenure of Cohen, a brash
43-year-old executive who was ousted after simmering tensions with
American Express Chairman James D. Robinson III boiled over this
week.
   A perception of arrogance on the part of Cohen _ especially
among the firm's 10,500 brokers _ has hurt morale. Other problems,
including 800 recent layoffs, a senior management restructuring and
slumping business, also have jolted the firm. Clark said he hoped
that would change.
   ``I think morale is going to improve as the business environment
improves because we've really compted corrected two uncertainties _
the management leadership question and the capitalization
andrating,'' he said.
   But Clark added: ``The basic problem is financial market _ the
volatility and cyclicality. That affects all firms, not just
Shearson.''
   Nine years after acquiring Shearson, American Express removed
the final high-level link to the firm's past with Cohen's forced
resignation Tuesday.
   Analysts predicted that the arrival of the subdued and practical
Clark, who turns 46 today, could lead to a scaling down of activity
in fields such as investment banking _ involving mergers and
securities underwriting _ that Shearson entered under Cohen during
Wall Street's expansion-crazed 1980s.
   ``Over the next several years you could see a swing back to the
Shearson of old where the main concern was the retail side of the
business,'' said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical Services.
   Shearson's current trn good part from declines in stock buying
by individuals, mergers and acquisitins and securities
underwriting.e of their size and exposure, Nos. 1 and 2 Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. and Shearson have been among the hardest hit.
   much of the blame on overexpansion. Shearson grew from a
mid-sized retail outfit to a diversified brokerage byquiring
investment banking firm Lehman Brothers Kuhn Loeb in 1984 and
retail brokerage E.F. Hutton &amp; Co. in 1988.
   ``They found out you can be all things to all people but you
can't always make money doing it,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder, a
securities industry analyst with Prudentche Securities Inc.
   The first order of business for Clark is the sale of about $250
million in new stock t shareholders. It replaces a public offering
scrapped because of the firm's slumping stock price and Cohen's
resignation.
   Under the new plan, announced Wednesday, American Express
eventually would cut its stake in Shearson to about 45 percent from
61 percent, enabling it to drop the brokerage fits balance sheet.
American Express still would remain Shearson's largest stakeholder.
   Unlike recent layoffs at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the investment
banking job cuts at Shearson are being done gradually. A Shearson
oicial who requested anonymity cae figure of up to 100 layoffs
``way out of line'' but said some reductions had occurred.
   Iear how the changing of the guard at Shearson would affect the
reductions.
   Merrill Lynch earlier this month let go about 70 investment
bankers, or about 10 percent of its force, spokesman Fred Yager
said. The layoffs were effective immediately.
   vestment bankers, who advise companies on acquisitions and sales
of stock and bonds, are among the most highly paid professionals on
Wall Street with six- and seven-figure salaries and bonuses.

   A Washington stockbroker, his father and a
friend who allegedly tipped the father to inside information about
a corporate takeover have settled civil securities charges.
   a civil complaint filed at federal court in Washington, the
Secies and Exchange Commission alleWednesday that Richard W.
Dutrisac, a board member of Pancretec Inc., tipped John E.
McCullough Sr. about the San Diego company's pending acquisition by
Abbot Laboratories in January 1989.
   According to the SEC, McCullough told his son, John E.
McCullough Jr., a registered representative for a Washington, D.C.,
brokerage, about the proposed deal. The son allegedly recommended
Pancretec, which makes drug-infusion pumps, to his customerl three
settled the SEC action without admitting or denying wrongdoing.
   The elder McCullough, 58, of Arlington, Va., agreed to pay
$35,000 in penalties and alleged illegal profits.
   His son, who was not accused of trading for himself, was to pay
$27,768 in fines and restitution of commission fees. All but $5,000
was waived due to ``inability to pay,'' according to the settlement
papers.
   The name of the younger McCullough's firm was not disclosed.
   Dutrisac, 50, of Santa Ana, Calif., agreed to pay $13,500 in
penalties. The government did not seek any alleged illegal profits
because there was no charge he traded on the inside information,
SEC attorney Daniel A. Nathan said.
   Nathan said no charges have been filed against the 11 McCullough
clients, who allegedly made $13,000 onretec trades. He declined to
sather charges would be brought in the future, although there was
no indication the clients were aware the information had been
misappropriated.
   Dutrisac's lawyer in Newport Beach, Calif., Ronald P. Arrined to
comment. Lawyers for the McCulloughs could not be reached for
comment.

<HEAD>The National Makes Its Debut</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National puts opening day fanfare behind it
today and begins its pursuit of a loyal following of readers for
all sports seasons.
   The country's only all-sports newspaper made its debut Wednesday
at newsstands and in vending machines in New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago after six months in development and two weeks of daily
tests.
   The first 48-page issue featured 36 pages of stories and
statistics, a weather map for spectators venturing to games around
the country and a short list of ``jock stocks'' for those wishing
to gamble their money on more than sporting events.
   Early sales were brisk, and National officials said they were
pleased with the startup, which is costing the paper's financial
backers about $25 million.
   Publisher Peter Price and editor Frank Deford said they were
optimistic about reaching goals of daily circulation averaging
200,000. Plans are to expand circulation of the tabloid-style
paper, which sells for 50 cents, into as many as a dozen more
cities by the end of the year.
   Deford, a former Sports Illustrated writer, said the owners also
are considering mailing an early-evening edition to subscribers
later in the year so that people who live and work outside major
cities can get the newspaper.
   Price said 250,000 copies were distributed on the first day and
that several newsstands in New York reported they exhausted their
supply within a few hours.
   Some folks bought a single copy while others bought several. A
man who identified himself as Jerry Ginsberg of Freehold, N.J.,
scooped up eight copies at a Penn Station newstand and said he was
betting $4 that ``in 10 years, these will be worth money.''
   Price conceded there was a ``novelty effect'' to the first-day
sales but said he was convinced there was ``immense demand'' for
the paper anyway.
   Deford said the paper would be so successful, someone else will
probably imitate it by launching a second national sports daily.
   The first issue offered what newspaper officials said was a
representative mix of local, national and international sports
stories, hockey and basketball statistics and standings that
included comments on each team.
   But some newspaper people questioned the exclusivity of the two
stories touted as ``exclusives'' in the first edition _ one in
which outfielder Darryl Strawberry said ``it's time for me to
leave'' the New York Mets and the other reporting Florida running
back Emmitt Smith's decision to turn professional.
   ``Strawberry says that every six weeks,'' said Vic Ziegel,
sports editor of the New York Daily News.
   Paul Anger, executive sports editor of the Miami Herald, said
several newspapers in Florida already have reported Smith was
likely to turn pro.
   Ziegel also noted the New York edition failed to include West
Coast scores.
   But The National did offer some unique, off-beat features. Its
``Jock Stocks'' listed stock price changes for companies with
sports affiliations. The weather map noted driving conditions at
game time in various cities.
   At a news conference, Deford said one of the only glitches in
the first issue was that Charleston, S.C., appeared where
Charlotte, N.C., should have been on the weather map. The mistake
appeared in the New York issue but he said it was corrected in the
other two editions.
   Each city's issue will be tailored to the local audience. The
first issue had different cover stories in each city, with Patrick
Ewing of the New York Knicks featured in the New York edition,
Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls in Chicago and Magic Johnson of
the Los Angeles Lakers in Los Angeles.
   The National is owned by National American Sports Communications
L.P., a partnership that includes Price and Mexican media baron
Emilio Azcarraga.
   Price said the partnership was prepared to spend $100 million
over five years to put the paper in the black but may spend more
and wait longer.

<HEAD>Midway Airlines Rejects Suitor's Bid for Board Seat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midway Airlines Inc., isn't saying what it
will do now that unwelcome suitor Ampco-Pittsburgh Corp. has
received government clearance to acquire a bigger stake in the air
carrier.
   Neither is Ampco, for that matter.
   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission
Wednesday, Ampco disclosed that it sought antitrust clearance to
increase its stake to more than $15 million worth of Midway's
common stock.
   The filing also noted that Midway had rejected Ampco's bid for a
seat on the Chicago-based airline's board.
   Ampco spokesman Ronald Hasek said the company would have no
comment beyond what was contained in the four-page SEC filing.
   A spokeswoman for Midway, Sandra Allen, confirmed that Midway
had rebuffed Ampco's request for representation on the board of
directors and that a Philadelphia banker had been elected recently
to fill a vacancy on the board.
   But she declined to discuss the anti-trust clearance or Ampco's
intentions.
   Last September, Ampco, a Pittsburgh, Pa.-based, heavy
manufacturing concern, disclosed it had acquired a 9.6 percent
stake in Midway, which serves 51 cities and operates from Chicago.
   According to Ampco's SEC filing, it ``made an informal request''
for representation on Midway's board Nov. 13. Ampco renewed that
request Jan. 2 after a Midway board member, Jeffrey H. Erickson,
resigned.
   But on Tuesday, according to the SEC filing, Midway told Ampco
``that its request for board representation had been rejected.''
   Late last week, Midway electedrank Reed, president and chief
executive officer of Philadelphia's First Pennsylvania Bank Corp.,
to fill the vacancy.
   Ampco said it ``is considering what action, if any, it may
take'' in response to Midway's rejection of its request.
   Ampco also revealed it requested anti-trust clearance from the
Justice Department and trade Commission to acquire additional
Midway stock which would result in Ampco ``holding more than $15
million in value of common stock but less than 15 percent of the
outstanding voting securities'' of Midway.
   The Ampco filing said it received clearance Dec. 12.

   Mixing the golden arches with the hammer and
sickle may be a better combination than two all beef patties,
special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles and onions on a sesame seed
bun.
   McDonald's in Moscow is more than just the opening of another
hamburger stand. It's West meeting East, capitalism flourishing in
the heart of communism, an American icon dazzling ruble-paying
Soviet masses.
   ``It represents a common ground. Soviets now have something
that's quintessentially American,'' said Harriet Kuhr of the
Friendship Force of Atlanta, which pioneered exchanges betweens
U.S. and Soviet citizens.
   ``In a way, it's one of our imperialistic beliefs that everybody
wants to be American but they haven't been allowed to,'' Kuhr said.
``That's not necessarily true, but it makes us feel good. It's
like, `Wow, McDonald's. What's next? Maybe they'll start building
Fords.' ''
   The Moscow McDonald's opened Wednesday with the most fanfare of
any of the 11,201 franchises in the late Ray Kroc's empire.
   The restaurant rang up 30,000 meals on 27 cash registers,
breaking the opening-day record for McDonald's worldwide, officials
said.
   Over 70 billion burgers have been served since Kroc flipped his
first patty 35 years ago, and 22 million people in 52 countries eat
at McDonald's every day. That's more people than live in Australia
and New Zealand.
   The fascination with a McDonald's on Alexander Pushkin Square,
named for the father of modern Russian poetry, went far beyond the
opening of a business venture, however.
   It was front page news in The New York Times and was featured on
all American networks. The nation somehow found it comforting to
know that its former Cold War foe now is more likely to have Beeg
Mak attacks rather than nuclear ones.
   ``It's the equivalent of selling Russian meat pies in Times
Square,'' said Ethel Dunn of the Highgate Road Social Science
Research Station in Berkeley, Calif.
   ``At the moment, it's a novelty. But Russians are getting used
to the idea there's something of value to be gained from Americans.
It's a chance for them to learn something from us.''
   McDonald's trained Soviet farmers how to increase yields of
potatoes, cattle and lettuce. It imported seeds for pickle
cucumbers and shipped in some things that aren't Soviet-grown, such
as mustard and sesame seeds.
   They also trained their burger flippers to be cheery, a stark
contrast to the dour faces found in state-run cafeterias.
   ``We taught them what fast friendly service means, what it means
to provide clean surroundings and good quality food,'' said Gary
Reinblatt, senior vice president for McDonald's of Canada. ``It's
going to make the world a smaller place.''
   Some Soviets were suspicious of the chipper faces.
   ``I smile to everybody and they say, `What's wrong? Why the
smile?' '' said an unidentified worker in Moscow. ``They think I'm
laughing at them, because it's very unusual for Soviet people to be
kind and to be polite to everybody.''
   And not everyone thinks the venture can cut the mustard or lead
to Soviet versions of Ronald McDonald, Mayor McCheese and the Ham
Burglar.
   ``I would be shocked if it works out right,'' said Dimitri
Simes, a Soviet emigre who works for the Carnegie Endowment for
Peace in Washington, D.C.
   ``They've had to train people for things they are not
conditioned to be: pleasant, efficiesponsible and not steal from
the kitchen, the company or customers,'' Simes sai
   ``To deliver the stuff they need at the restaurant, they will
need reliable transportation. It doesn't exist,'' Simes said. ``You
have to overcome so many bottlenecks inherent in the Soviet
system.''
   A Beeg Mac sold for 3.75 rubles, more than two hours' wages for
the average Soviet. That's a fraction of what patrons were paying
in nearby Zelyeny Ogonyok, or the Green Light, a joint with green
and gold signs offering meat stew, cold meatballs with beads of
fat, cabbage soup and black bread.
   But some sociologists said McDonald's is a tangible sign that
Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of overhauling the country's economic
system is delivering more goods to hungryrs.
   ``One of the primary concerns of Soviet citizens is the food
supply,'' said Louise Shelley, chairwoman of the department of
justice, law and society at American University.
   ``If the opening to the West increases the ability to feed the
population, it's really an important development. Ms a concrete
benefit, a symbol that there is some economic progress under
perestroika.''
   Where will it end?
   Avon is calling at China's door.
   Avon Products Inc. said Wednesday its cosmetics wibe made and
sold in China in a joint venture with Guangzhou Cosmetics Factory.
Avon expects to have 3,000 saleesentatives working in Guangzhou
within a year and hopes to appeal to 500 million Chinese women.

<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed against other major
currencies in Europe today after two days of sharp swings.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said there was a nervous air in the
markets, with the dollar first falling and then rising during the
morning.
   The U.S. currency had not recovered from heavy selling on
Wednesday following a denial by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev
that he would resign as chairman of the Communist Party.
   The first resignation rumor had pushed the dollar sharply higher.
   Dealers in Frankfurt said the dollar was likely to test new lows
over the next few days in expectation of lower U.S. interest rates
and the continuing strength of the West German mark.
   Dealers in Milan predicted the dollar would remain in a narrow
range until the U.S. unemployment figures were issued on Friday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar closed at 144.50 Japanese yen, up from Wednesday's
closing 144.40. Later, in London, it was quoted at the higher rate
of 144.55 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6780 West German marks, down from
1.6800; 1.4945 Swiss francs, down from 1.5025; 5.7000 French
francs, down from 5.7275; 1.8895 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8950;
1,247.25 Italian lire, down from 1,252.75; and 1.1862 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1856.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound. It cost
$1.6830 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6870 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $413.40 a troy ounce, up
from $413.25 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.25.
   In Zurich, the bid price of gold was $413.20, up from $412.50
bid late Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $3.61 an ounce to close at a bid $412.42.
   Silver was unchanged in London at a bid $5.22 a troy ounce.

   The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen in
quiet trading today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index
rose marginally.
   The dollar closed at 144.50 yen, up 0.10 yen from Wednesday's
144.40-yen finish. It opened at 144.45 yen and stayed in a narrow
range between 144.35 yen and 144.63 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 1.28 yen in three trading days, after
slipping 3.20 yen in the previous five days.
   Market players were selling yen to buy West German marks, and
``the yen's decline in its cross-trading against the mark resulted
in the relative decline against the dollar,'' said Yoshitsugu
Hanada, a trader with Mitsui Bank.
   ``But straight dollar-yen dealings were inactive,'' he added.
   Spot trading volume totaled some $5.43 billion, down from $9.34
billion the previous day.
   ``Investors were just not in a mood to buy yen before the (Feb.
18) election,'' Hanada said, adding that there have been increasing
reports of problems the pro-business governing Liberal Democrats
face trying to keep their majority in Parliament's lower house.
   ``The yen could go only as high as 143 yen,'' he said.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained
17.47 points, or 0.05 percent, closing at 37,206.42. It dipped
26.72 points Wednesday.
   The index quickly rose in early trading as the market's concerns
eased over Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's grip on power and
the performance of the New York stock market, said Yutaka Yoshino,
a dealer with Nikki Securities Co.
   ``A higher opening and lower closing often happens when the
market is suffering from uncertainties,'' he said, citing U.S.
government bond bidding next week and the election later this month.
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev himself denied a rumor that he would
resign as Communist Party chief. The rumor had pushed up the dollar
in Tokyo, resulting in a decline in the Nikkei.
   The 47-point overnight gain in the Dow Jones industrial average
on Wall Street also reassured Japanese investors, Yoshino said.
   But later in Tokyo's session today, investors stopped buying
because of remaining uncertainties, he added.
   An estimated 500 million shares changed hands, up from 450
million the previous day.

<HEAD>Sale of Bloomingdale's May Be Called Off</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than four months after putting
Bloomingdale's on the auction block, officials for Federal
Department Store Inc. are now contemplating calling off the sale of
the 17-store high-fashion chain.
   Federated is studying whether ``there would be more value ... by
retaining Bloomingdale's or by selling it,'' spokeswoman Carol
Sanger said Wednesday.
   Federated is Bloomingdale's parent and the American holding
company of Campeau Corp., the troubled Canadian retailer that
sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal
Bankrupcty Code on Jan. 15 for Federated and its sister U.S.
retailing chain, Allied Stores Corp.
   Campeau had set a February deadline for selling the 17-store
chain.
   According to unidentified sources quoted in today's editions of
the New York Times, Federated had received at least three bids for
tony Bloomingdale's, but ``most'' were below Federated's $1
billion-plus asking price.
   ``Absent a bid for Bloomingdale's that would be so overwhelming
that we'd have to act on it, the decision would be delayed pending
the construction of an overall reorganization plan for the
companies,'' Ms. Sanger said.
   Rumors have been circulating in the retail trade that potential
bidders were only considering offers of around $800 million.
   Any sale would be subject to bankruptcy court approval as well
as the approval of a committee, which has not yet been completely
formed, to represent creditors. The committee probably could not
meet until at least mid-February.
   Campeau acquired Federated in 1988; two years earlier Campeau
acquired the Allied chain. The acquisitions left the retailers with
more than $7.5 billion in debt.

<HEAD>Bank Announces Management Shakeup</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp. has cleaned out more of
its senior management as the troubled institution tries to recover
from massive losses in real estate loans.
   The bank said Wednesday that four senior executives had left the
company, including the head of the its Boston operation.
   The announcement came less than a week after the bank's board of
directors forced out Walter Connolly as chairman, naming H. Ridgely
Bullock as an interim replacement.
   ``These changes represent a major step in the achievement of our
recovery plan for the company,'' Bullock said in a statement. ``I
expect they'll have an immediate impact on our goal of
strengthening credit policies, procedures and administration.''
   The bank said Richard Driscoll, vice chairman of the corporation
and chairman of Bank of New England's Boston operation, had retired
at the request of the board of directors.
   Other executives to leave are M. Thomas Wilson, president of the
Boston operation; Hugh M. Taylor, senior credit policy officer; and
James Sweeney, executive vice president of real estate lending.
   Under the new organization, Bullock will also serve as chairman
and chief executive of the Boston division.
   Leo Breitman, who was president of Connecticut Bank and Trust
Co., a subsidiary, will be president and chief operating officer of
the Boston operation.
   Earlier in the day, Bank of New England said it had completed
the sale of a vehicle leasing business for $350 million, a move
that would give the company an infusion of cash.
   The bank said it had sold the U.S. portion of its McCullagh
Leasing to GE Capital, a subsidiary of General Electric Co.
   The business leases car and truck fleets in the United States
and Canada, and Bank of New England said it expected to complete
the sale of the Canadian portion next week for around $100 million.
   Bank of New England announced earlier this month it expected to
post a loss of more than $1 billion for 1989 because of bad real
estate loans, and the company has been trying to sell about $6
billion worth of assets.
   Earlier this week, the bank said it had agreed to sell its
credit card business to Citicorp for $828 million.
   Bullock said completing the sale of the leasing business
``represents continued momentum in our asset sales plan as we
aggressively pursue other options to downsize the company and
improve our capital ratios.''
   The bank last week was forced to borrow money from the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston, as depositors have withdrawn millions of
dollars.
   Tom Lavelle, a bank spokesman, said the money from GE Capital
could help Bank of New England avoid returning to the Federal
Reserve in the immediate future.
   ``It is a possibility that we would not resort to the Fed, but
we will be monitoring it over the next day or two,'' he said.

   Officials in charge of President Bush's
savings and loan bailout, getting their second tongue-lashing in as
many weeks on Capitol Hill, are assuring lawmakers they will speed
up their work.
   ``I share your ... concerns about getting this job done,''
Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson told critical members of
the Senate Banking Committee, ``and we're going to break our necks
to see that we get it done.''
   The officials, a week after undergoing criticism from House
members over the slow pace of their work, endured similar
complaints from the senators Wednesday.
   ``Act decisively. Do what's necessary. Don't be timid,'' said
Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, senior Republican on the Senate Banking
Committee.
   ``Surely, surely there must be something you can do to speed up
the process,'' he said, warning that further delay by the
Resolution Trust Corp. will increase costs to the taxpayers.
   On Wednesday, Arizona's largest savings institution,
Phoenix-based MeraBank, was seized by the federal government. The
action by the RTC made MeraBank the sixth Arizona savings and loan
to be seized by the government, leaving only four operating
privately.
   The RTC has taken over some 350 S&amp;Ls to date, disposing of 42 of
them. However, 33 of the resolutions were completed in the agency's
first three months of operation and only nine since then.
   ``The pace was a little slower than some of us would have liked
to have seen,'' conceded Robson, acting chairman of the RTC
oversight board.
   Sens. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the banking
committee, and Paul Sarbanes, D-Md., were particularly critical of
the administration's failure to fill many of the posts in the S&amp;L
bureaucracy nearly six months after enactment of the bailout law.
   ``It is impossible to understand how the thrift crisis can be
successfully resolved with many of the key players not even in
uniform ready to participate,'' Riegle said.
   The administration has failed to appoint a new Office of Thrift
Supervision director, two of the five members of the RTC oversight
board, an inspector general for the RTC, four of five members of a
board governing the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks and a new
member of the board of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   ``The urgency that was attached to this legislation seems to
have evaporated with its passage,'' Sarbanes complained.
   Robson said the administration has had some difficulty finding
candidates whose business activities did not pose a conflict of
interest. Also, he described the FBI clearance process as
``draconian.''
   However, he said the administration was ``very close'' to naming
a fourth member of the RTC oversight board and said the candidate
for the agency's inspector general was undergoing background checks.
   Robson also said if the $50 billion allocated to the RTC proved
to be inadequate, the administration could ask Congress to
``reallocate to earlier periods'' $32 billion earmarked for
post-1992 failures.

   The stock market was mostly lower in moderate

   ``I don't think anyone took it serious in terms of it being a
reversal,'' said Larry Wachtel, analyst with Prudential-Bache

still poor, interest rates are probably going higher. But from a
physical standpoint you can't come down this much without a

<HEAD>Delaware Court Gives Go-Ahead for Southern Union Merger with Metro
Mobile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southern Union, a Texas-based natural gas utility,
has won court permission to complete its $137 million merger with
Metro Mobile CTS Inc.
   Vice Chancellor William Chandler of Delaware Chancery Court on
Wednesday declined to block the merger, as requested by TCG, a
privately held Texas corporation owned by Southern Union
shareholder T.C. Griffith.
   Chandler said TCG had not proved it was likely to succeed with
its case. TCG charged that the merger violated Delaware business
law and that Southern Union withheld information that could affect
the value of shareholders' stock.
   Metro, a New York-based cellular phone company that has a
propane gas subsidiary, is offering $13.80 a share for Southern
Union's 10.145 million shares.
   Chandler noted in his 28-page opinion Metro's bid ``offers
Southern Union stockholders a significant premium'' over its recent
market price.
   About a dozen companies had bid for Southern Union stock, but
only Metro wanted the entire company, the chancellor said.
   ``Metro's bid, moreover, was at a far greater price than any
other offer and was the only offer to acquire all of Southern
Union,'' he said.
   There have been no other offers since June 1989, he said,
adding, ``a delay in receiving Metro's cash offer would be
injurious to Southern Union stockholders because of the time value
of money.''
   ``Worse still, if the merger is enjoined, Metro has indicated
that it will `probably walk away' from the transaction,'' the judge
said.
   Southern Union, based in Austin, Texas, has natural gas
utilities in Texas, Arizona and Oklahoma. It also is involved in
oil and gas exploration and production, markets gas to interstate
pipeline systems and users, and has substantial real estate
investments, according to the court filings.
   Southern Union and Metro are both incorporated in Delaware.
   In seeking the injunction, Griffith contended Southern Union did
not tell shareholders that the company had a change of winning
litigation against a New Mexico utility. Winning could increase
Southern Union's assets by about $60 million and also increase the
value of its natural gas reserves, according to Griffith's request.

   The stock market was lower in moderate trading
today but had bounced off earlier low levels.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 2.70 points to
2,587.84 at 11 a.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was off 2.25
points an hour earlier but had fallen nearly 10 points in the

   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 52.44 million
shares.
   Wall Street analysts said concerns about interest rates weakened
bond prices early in the day and dragged stocks lower.
   A report by the nation's purchasing executives suggesting the
manufacturing sector weakened further in January might have
contributed to a downward blip but was not having a sustained
impact in early trading, analysts said. The National Association of
Purchasing Management's index fell to 45.2 percent from 46.7
percent in December.
   A second report by the Commerce Department that construction
spending fell 0.6 percent in December, also was having a minor
impact in early dealings.
   ``I think the bad economic news is already built into the
market,'' said Philip Puccio, managing director of equity trading
for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Analysts also said Wednesday's rally, which ended a five-session
decline, was not necessarily expected to carry the market higher
today.
   ``Conditions are still bearish. As long as interest rates stay
as high, investors are not going to rush into the market,'' said
Brad Weeks, head of equity trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette. ``We had a rally yesterday for technical reasons and
technical reasons only.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices edged lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting
improved crop weather and slack export demand for U.S. wheat.
   Rain was moving into U.S. corn and soybean areas today, which
will help boost soil moisture reserves.
   Growing conditions also are continuing to improve in the South
American soybean belt, where recent rains have relieved dryness in
Argentina and Southern Brazil.
   Wheat is increasingly viewed as oversold and due for a rally.
But the slow pace of wheat export sales is a drag on the market.

Barclays declined to disclose how much he would be paid.
   Lawson, 57, told Press Association, Britain's domestic news

   He resigned as chancellor of the exchequer Oct. 26, telling
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher that he couldn't continue as long

<NOTE>EDS: RECASTS throughout to UPDATE with restructuring of debt

<TEXT>
   The government has taken control of MeraBank,
Arizona's largest savings institution, in a taxpayer bailout which
regulators said would be softened by a $450 million cash infusion
from the thrift's parent.
   By coincidence, the seizure Wednesday occurred while officers of
Pinnacle West Capital Corp. scrambled to rearrange the holding
company's debt to accommodate extra borrowing for MeraBank.
   Agreements to restructure more than $650 million in debt with
existing lenders were completed 15 minutes before Wednesday's
midnight deadline, Pinnacle West executives said.
   ``It's a done deal; it's all over,'' said Keith Turley, Pinnacle
West chairman and chief executive officer. ``Everything is signed,
sealed and delivered.''
   Turley said the agreement included provision for funds to meet
Pinnacle West's obligation to give MeraBank a cash infusion of $450
million plus $12 million in accrued interest. He also said it
avoids the possibility the holding company would have to wind up in
bankruptcy court.
   MeraBank fell victim to the state's real-estate slump, said a
lawyer for the Office of Thrift Supervision's regional office in
San Francisco.
   ``Basically what they did was go heavily into some of the newer,
riskier investments like construction loans and direct investments
and land loans for development purposes ... (while) a number of
S&amp;Ls and banks were doing the same type of thing in Arizona,'' said
Bill Black, the OTS district counsel.
   At the same time, Black said, Arizona's economy was beginning to
slump.
   ``If you buy a lot and the demand falls, what has to happen to
the price? It has to fall,'' he said.
   The OTS, a branch of the Treasury Department, determined that
the thrift was operating in an unsafe manner, and the Resolution
Trust Corp. took over, Black said.
   Regulators said all MeraBank branches will remain open for
business as usual, operating under a new government-owned thrift
called MeraBank Federal Savings Bank. Deposits will be insured up
to $100,000 per account.
   Pinnacle West had been seeking a buyer for MeraBank and
announced in December that it might have found one, but Henry B.
Sargent Jr., the company's chief financial officer, said Wednesday
that wasn't the case.
   ``We didn't have any prospects of selling MeraBank, but I think
now that the federal government has taken over, they will have a
prospect of selling it, and that is a possibility we've all
considered for some time,'' Sargent said.
   Sargent said Pinnacle West would honor the agreement to inject
$450 million into the thrift by March 31 even though it is in the
government's hands.
   The money will not bring MeraBank close to its capital
requirement, Black said.
   On Tuesday, Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the ratings of secured
debt and bonds of Arizona Public Service Co., an electric utility
which is Pinnacle West's only profitable subsidiary, and PacifiCorp
of Portland, Ore., closed its Phoenix office.
   PacifiCorp offered to buy APS in November. On Dec. 1, it offered
to buy Pinnacle West, minus MeraBank, and was rejected.
   Mike Nelson, PacifiCorp's director of financial planning, said
he wasn't sure whether the takeover would spark renewed interest in
Pinnacle West.
   ``We're still interested in entering into some sort of
negotiations,'' Nelson said.
   MeraBank lost $209 million in 1988 and lost $190 million in the
first three quarters of 1989. The extent of the red ink triggered
fears by state utility regulators that Pinnacle West might sap the
vigor of Arizona Public Service while trying to steady its
staggering thrift.
   Marcia Weeks, chairman of the Arizona Corporation Commission,
called the federal action ``a sad day for Arizona, but a big relief
(for) the utility ratepayers.''
   Under the debt restructuring agreement signed Wednesday, Turley
said, Citibank, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank and Morgan
Guaranty Bank and Trust Co. went together to provide up to $312
million in interim financing to satisfy Pinnacle West's agreement
with the OTC.
   The restructuring agreement includes $624 million of current
debt and $52 million in letter-of-credit guarantees and other
contingent obligations, Turley said. He said Wednesday's agreement
extends original maturity dates by two years.
   As earlier, it also pledges APS common stock as security, Turley
said. He said no APS asset is pledged and that the pledge won't
affect APS.
   However, he also said the modified agreements restrict Pinnacle
West's ability to incur new debt or make new investments. It also
institutes certain financial tests that must be met if Pinnacle
West were to pay cash dividends, and Turley said that made it
unlikely for the foreseeable future that Pinnacle West will be able
to pay any such dividend.
   Turley said having reached the debt restructuring agreement
``effectively eliminates the threat of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing,'' an action under which a company secures protection from
its creditors while undergoing financial restructuring and
continuing to operate.
   Black said the $450 million ``net-worth agreement'' wrung from
Pinnacle West on Dec. 6 reduced the taxpayer cost of the MeraBank
collapse far below the estimated $2 billion bailout of Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   The government took Lincoln away from American Continental
Corp., another Phoenix-based holding company, last April.
   ``This is by far the largest recovery the government has been
able to attain through a net-worth agreement,'' Black said.
   Pinnacle West bought Merabank for $426 million in December 1986,
the year the state's real estate market hit the skids.
   At the end of last November, MeraBank was $337 million in the
red and had about $4.5 billion in deposits in 833,000 accounts. Its
$6.6 billion in assets placed it 29th nationally in a mid-1989
rating by Sheshunoff Information Services Inc., an Austin, Texas,
consulting firm.
   MeraBank is the sixth Arizona S&amp;L to be seized by the
government, leaving only four operating privately. The second
largest, Western Savings and Loan Association of Phoenix, was
seized in June and put up for sale earlier this month.
   Kevin Shields, a spokesman for the RTC's Denver office, said it
would take months to prepare Merabank for sale.
   MeraBank operates a subsidiary in El Paso, Texas, MeraBank
Texas, which was a buyer in the 1988 government-assisted bailout of
three Texas S&amp;Ls. It got about $670 million from the government to
acquire State Federal, Lubbock; First Financial, El Paso; and
Brownfield Federal, Brownfield.
   The Texas thrifts, along with MeraBank's other holdings in the
state, revert to the government's possession.
   MeraBank is the 32nd S&amp;L failure so far this year. An additional
225 to 295 are likely to fail, compared with a record 328 last year
and 223 in 1988.

the tax aspects of the president's 1991 budget request, said the
administration felt strongly that the new savings accounts, along
with a proposed cut in the capital gains tax, would foster the
long-term investment needed by U.S. businesses to stay competitive.
   ``An important goal for the 1990s is to increase the rate of
growth of America's productive capacity,'' Brady said. ``More
saving is needed to finance increases in our productive capacity.
We believe that the federal government should foster an environment
that is conducive to saving and we have a plan to achieve this
objective.''
   The Family Savings Account, which Bush mentioned in his State of
the Union address, would allow an individual taxpayer to save up to
$2,500 a year and a family to invest up to $5,000 a year with the
money earning interest tax-free as long as it was held for at least
seven years.
   The administration sees this proposal as the centerpiece of an
effort to increase personal savings rates and thus expand the pool
of money available for businesses to borrow to modernize production
facilities.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., however
questioned both the savings proposal and the administration's
renewed effort to cut the capital gains tax, saying that both
measures would lose revenue at a time when the government was still
facing massive federal deficits.
   Sasser said the Family Savings Account would provide only ``a
minimal increase in private savings'' while costing the government
tax revenues.
   Also appearing before the committee today was Michael Boskin,
the president's chief economic adviser. Both Boskin and Brady
defended the Bush budget against charges that it relied heavily on
overly optimistic economic forecasts to reach the required deficit
target for 1991.
   In earlier testimony before the House Budget Committee, Boskin
said the economy is now going through a sluggish period, with
economic growth _ as measured by the gross national product _
dropping to a barely perceptible 0.5 percent annual rate in the
final three months of 1989.
   Boskin said that although he expects growth to pick up modestly
in the first three months of this year, another quarter of growth
below 1 percent is possible.
   Under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law, two consecutive
quarters of growth below 1 percent would require lawmakers to vote
on suspending the deficit reduction targets for 1991.
   Boskin urged lawmakers not to do so, especially if the economy
is showing signs of an imminent rebound.
   ``A suspension of Gramm-Rudman could have very unfavorable
impacts on financial markets and cause interest rates to rise,''
Boskin said in testimony Wednesday.
   Budget Director Richard Darman denied the budget ignores the
movement toward democracy in Eastern Europe, which many lawmakers
view as requiring less Pentagon spending than the $292 billion
proposed by the administration.
   ``The reality is that this is a budget which proposes a 2.6
percent real cut (in military spending after taking account of
inflation) in the first year and a 2 percent real cut every year
thereafter,'' Darman said.
   Robert D. Reischauer, head of the bipartisan Congressional
Budget Office, said the CBO came up with a $37 billion higher
deficit for the 1991 fiscal year than the Bush administration is
assuming.
   CBO put the 1991 deficit at $138 billion without any changes in
current policy, compared with the $101 billion claimed by the
administration.
   Reischauer said more than two-thirds of the higher CBO figure,
$26 billion, was a direct result of less optimistic forecasts on
economic growth and interest rates. The other $11 billion came from
higher expected spending for the savings and loan bailout and such
programs as Medicare.
   Because of its assumptions, the administration needed just $37
billion in savings to meet the requirement of proposing a budget
with a $64 billion deficit in the 1991 budget year, which starts in
October, down from an expected deficit this year of $123.8 billion.
   But Reischauer said the CBO assumptions would double the amount
of savings needed by the administration.
   Congress may adopt either the CBO estimate or the assumptions in
the Bush budget in drawing up its own spending plan, but the
administration's assumptions must be used later in the year in
determining whether across-the-board spending cuts are needed to
meet the deficit target.

<HEAD>USX Changes Bylaws On Proxy Fights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. said today it has changed its bylaws
to require advance notice of proxy fights, apparently in response
to reports that Carl Icahn, the company's largest stockholder, may
wage one.
   Charles A. Corry, chairman of the steel, oil and gas giant, said
at a new conference he told Icahn about the bylaw change Wednesday.
He declined to discuss Icahn's reaction.
   Icahn was in meetings today and not immediately available for
comment, his secretary said.
   Icahn has long been unhappy with USX management and believes the
company's stock price is too low.
   The takeover strategist, who also is chairman of Trans World
Airlines, waged a proxy fight at Texaco Inc. two years ago because
he was dissatisfied with that company's management. A Wall Street
source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, has said Icahn was
considering whether to take a similar step at USX.
   Corry said the company's board of directors unanimously approved
an amendment to the company's bylaws, requiring anyone wanting to
wage a proxy fight to inform the company at least 60 days prior to
the next annual shareholders meeting.
   ``That is intended to prevent someone from raising havoc at the
last moment,'' he said.
   The company's next annual shareholders meeting is set for May 7.

   The stock market was drifting at slightly lower
levels today, pressured by interest-rate worries and profit-taking.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 0.68 point to
2,589.86 at noon EST. The blue-chip indicator was off 2.70 points
an hour earlier after falling nearly 10 points around mid-morning.
   Advancing and declining issues were nearly even on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 679 issues down, 645 up and 471 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 73.73 million
shares.
   Wall Street analysts said concerns about interest rates weakened
bond prices early in the day and dragged stocks lower.
   A report by the nation's purchasing executives suggesting the
manufacturing sector weakened further in January contributed to a
downward blip but was not having a sustained impact in early
trading, analysts said. The National Association of Purchasing
Management's index fell to 45.2 percent from 46.7 percent in
December.
   A second report by the Commerce Department that construction
spending fell 0.6 percent in December, also was having a minor
impact in early dealings.
   ``I think the bad economic news is already built into the
market,'' said Philip Puccio, managing director of equity trading
for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Analysts said despite Wednesday's surge, which ended a
five-session decline, general business conditions remained bearish.
   ``As long as interest rates stay as high, investors are not
going to rush into the market,'' said Brad Weeks, head of equity
trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ``We had a rally
yesterday for technical reasons and technical reasons only.''
   Profit-taking following Wednesday's rally also was pressuring
stock prices, traders said.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.19 to 181.31.
   At the American Stock Exchange the market value index was up
0.47 to 350.54.

<TEXT>
   Japan's Fair Trade Commission said Thursday its
international committee was considering applying anti-monopoly
regulations to all foreign companies whose business practices
affect Japan.
   Japan's current anti-monopoly law applies only to Japanese
companies and subsidiaries of foreign firms operating within Japan.
   Commission spokesman Kazutoshi Fujishiro said the commission's
international committee was to report by mid-February on the
feasibility of extending the law to other foreign companies.
   The 15-member committee was set up two years ago because of the
increasingly global scale of business activities, he added.
   Fujishiro said small adjustments in some related laws and
consultation with foreign countries would be needed to extend the
the reach of Japan's anti-monopoly law beyond its borders.
   The newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun said the commission, a watchdog
body to ensure fair business competition, would soon begin
full-scale preparations for revision of the anti-monopoly law.
   The revision would indirectly contribute to bringing down the
high prices of imported goods in Japan, it said.
   The paper said other nations also extend the reach of their
anti-monopoly laws beyond national borders.

<HEAD>Retailers Finish Fiscal Year on Modest Sales Note</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Major U.S. retailers today reported fair sales gains in January,
with some having better luck than others clearing out leftover
holiday merchandise.
   Sales at stores open at least a year rose around 5 percent
industrywide from a year earlier, according to estimates by retail
analysts.
   Chains specializing in apparel had the best growth while mass
merchandisers, including the nation's two largest retailers, Sears,
Roebuck and Co. and K mart Corp., tallied increases below the
industry average.
   January is typically a slow time in the retailing trade and the
month marks the end of the fiscal year for many merchants.
Consumers usually have had their fill of spending at Christmas and
some people enter the new year bearing credit card debts that
discourage them from shopping for awhile.
   Widespread price cutting and other promotions this past holiday
season _ particularly by debt-laden department stores desperate to
raise cash _ may have left buyers more bloated than usual.
   Edward Johnson, a retail analyst at Prescott Ball &amp; Turben Inc.,
said the first three weeks of January were sluggish for retailers
as consumers nursed a bad case of post-Christmas spending blues.
But shoppers began returning to stores in the last week of the
month.
   The seasonally adjusted pace of sales quickened in the final
week to about 8.5 percent from 4.8 percent in the first three
weeks, he said.
   Jeffrey Edelman, of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said retailers
that had the leanest inventories due to brisk holiday business
generally had the lowest January sales gains. The ones stuck with
excess after Christmas pushed hard to move the merchandise to make
room for spring lines and therefore posted higher sales results.
   Looking ahead, Jeffrey Feiner, a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. analyst,
said an erosion in consumer confidence lately, reflecting
uncertainty about economic conditions and weakness in financial
markets, portends tougher times for retailers.
   ``Weakness in both the housing and financial markets makes the
outlook for consumer spending in retail stores in our opinion
likely to be quite sluggish, at least over the near term,'' Feiner
said.
   The sales reports today were from general merchandise chains,
department stores, specialty apparel retailers and others. Here are
some of the results:
   Sears, the nation's biggest retailer, said sales rose 2.2
percent in the four weeks ended Jan. 27 to $2.17 billion from $2.12
billion a year earlier. Sales at stores open at least a year,
called same- or comparable-store sales, rose 3.3 percent.
   Analysts and store executives attach greater significance to
same-store tallies because the excitement of new store openings can
inflate sales temporarily, providing distorted results.
   K mart, second in size to Sears, reported a 13.1 percent
increase in sales to $1.79 billion from $1.58 billion but on a
same-store basis sales were up 3.1 percent.
   No. 3-ranked Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which typically outperforms
rival discounters, said sales grew 24 percent to $1.84 billion from
$1.48 billion. Excluding newly opened stores, sales rose 10 percent.
   Among retailers concentrating on apparel, J.C. Penney Co. Inc.
said sales increased 8.5 percent to $779 million from $718 mllion a
year earlier. Same-store sales rose 7.3 percent.
   The specialty apparel retailer The Limited Inc. posted an 11
percent sales increase to $285.6 million from $256.7 million while
sales grew 9 percent on a comparable store basis.
   The Gap Inc., another clothing specialist, said January sales
surged 34 percent to $94 million from the year earlier's $70
million. Same-store sales jumped 24 percent.
   Dayton Hudson Corp., owner of department stores and the large
Target discount chain, said January sales went up 12.2 percent to
$711 million from $634 million. Sales at stores open at least a
year rose 5.2 percent.
   Woolworth Corp., owner of F.W. Woolworth Co. stores plus
numerous specialty retailers including the Foot Locker chain, said
domestic January sales rose 8.5 percent to $283 million from $261
million. Domestic sales were up 4.5 percent at stores open for a
year or more.

   SCI Television Inc. avoided being placed under
federal bankrupcty court protection after a judge in Delaware
approved a last-minute change in the company's debt revision plan,
a lawyer for SCI said.
   The company now faces a new deadline of Monday to complete a
restructuring of its $1.3 billion debt.
   The Denver-based operator of six television stations, unable to
meet interest payments on its debt, has been trying to get
bondholders to accept stock and securities in exchange for their
$507 million in outstanding bonds.
   As part of its planned debt restructuring, the company specified
that certain minimum levels of each of three series of bonds must
be tendered under its exchange offer. The requirement already had
been met on two series of bonds, but SCI remained short of the
minimum acceptance level of 87.5 percent for a third issue.
   The company faced a deadline of 4:30 p.m. EST Wednesday to
certify that it had been tendered or promised at least 87.5 percent
of its $100 million issue of 16{ percent senior subordinated
debentures, or be placed under bankruptcy protection.
   As the deadline approached, SCI lawyer James L. Patton Jr. said
the company requested that the minimum acceptance level be reduced
to 85 percent, and the judge agreed. SCI was able to certify that
it had met the reduced minimum.
   But in a statement today, the company said that a closer
examination of the tenders and promises to tender showed that there
had been some ``miscounts of tenders received and the non-tender of
securities which SCI understood had been offered to be tendered''
and that it had been tendered only 83.2 percent of the bonds as of
this morning.
   As a result, it said the court was informed and ``has taken no
action to modify or rescind its previous orders.''
   SCI said it was holding the exchange offer open until noon EST
Friday in an effort to get the required 85 percent of the bonds.
   The company has been unable to generate enough cash to meet
payments due on $1.3 billion in debt incurred when it was acquired
in 1987 by the entrepreneur George Gillett and a group led by the
buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Gillett owns 55 percent of SCI while the Kohlberg group owns the
rest.
   Under the debt restructuring plan, the bondholders will get a 39
percent equity stake in the company and bank lenders will get 5
percent. Gillett's stake will be trimmed to 41 percent and
Kohlberg's stake to 15 percent.
   SCI Television operates stations WSBK in Boston, WJBK in
Detroit, WJW in Cleveland, WAGA in Atlanta, KNSD in San Diego and
WITI in Milwaukee.

   Boeing Co. picked up another $1 billion in

   Japan Air System ordered four Boeing 747-400 jumbo jets and took

jets, worth about $560 million, including spare parts.
   The firm orders by JAS are worth more than $520 million, and the
total package would be worth more than $1 billion if the options
are exercised, Boeing said.
   The order represents the first placed with Boeing by JAS,
Japan's third largest airline and formerly a domestic-only carrier.
   JAS will specify engine types at a later date.
   Qantas chose Rolls-Royce engines for its new 747 and General

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The overseas construction industry,
once dubbed South Korea's ``golden goose,'' is gambling that new
markets in Arab and communist nations will help it overcome a long
slump.
   South Korean contractors, unfazed by political and regional
differences with their homeland, are eyeing postwar reconstruction
projects in Iran and Iraq, expanding business in Libya and starting
projects in the Soviet Union and other socialist nations.
   They're even considering a cooperative venture in Siberia that
would employ workers from South Korea's archenemy, communist North
Korea.
   ``Finally, we seem to be coming out of a long tunnel of
recession,'' said Choi Jae-yol, a government economic researcher,
referring to a surge in South Korean overseas construction.
   In the past two decades, domestic contractors have won $90
billion worth of contracts overseas, earning foreign currency
needed for the country's economic development.
   But in recent years, South Korea's overseas construction
declined severely. Volume of contracts nosedived from an all-time
high of $13.7 billion in 1981 to $1.6 billion in 1988.
   Overseas construction volume began to pick up last year,
reaching $2.4 billion, and officials expect business in 1990 to top
$7.7 billion, some of it in socialist and communist nations.
   South Koreans are expanding their business from labor-intensive
civil engineering to technology-oriented projects such as
powerplants but they still rely heavily on cheap labor.
   South Korean contractors abroad hire help from Bangladesh,
Thailand, the Philippines and other Third World Asian nations. At
the end of 1989, 42,000 foreigners were on Korean payrolls abroad,
compared with 24,000 Korean overseas construction workers.
   The South Koreans are paid roughly $875 a month while other
foreign workers earn only one-third of that amount, a price edge
companies say is necessary for them to remain competitive.
   Officials say Libya will emerge as South Korea's largest market
in 1990 with $5.7 billion of contracts, followed by Saudi Arabia
with $820 million and Iran with $422 million.
   Last September, Libya picked up Dong-A Construction Co. of Seoul
as a prime contractor for a $5.3 billion water project. A formal
contract for the project, the largest awarded a South Korean firm,
will be signed this year.
   South Koreans received nearly 80 percent of their overseas
contracts in the oil-rich Middle East in the past, but Saudi Arabia
and other Arab nations scaled down development revenues as prices
for their oil dropped.
   Choi, who works for the government-controlled Overseas
Construction Association, said the recovery pace of South Korea's
overseas construction business depends partly on the ability to
snare multibillion dollar rehabilitation projects in Iran and Iraq.
   South Korea is one of the few countrie able to do business with
both Iran and Iraq. During the eight-year Persian Gulf War, South
Korea maneuvered to stay neutral between the two.
   Iran sought South Korean assistance in getting U.S.-made jet
parts for its air force but the Seoul government rejected the
request, citing its neutral foreign policy. Iran retaliated by
downgrading its ties with Seoul to a charge d'affairs but restored
full ties with Seoul after the ceasefire.
   South Korea's rejection of Iran's request helped it open ties
with Iraq, with which Seoul had no diplomatic relations. South
Korea now maintains diplomatic relations with both Arab nations.
   Kim Sung-jo, a director-general in the Construction Ministry,
said South Korean business in the region would increase as the two
Arab nations push reabilitation projects.
   Several South Korean companies have sent teams of experts to
Tehran to inspect a major petrochemical project at Bandar Khomeini
in southern Iran, abandoned by Japan's Mitsui Corp.
   Iran officially asked South Korea to finish construction after
the Japanese conglomerate decided the plant was too damaged by the
war to be completed.
   The Iranian project was 85 percent completed before the war
broke out in 1980 and was originally estimated in 1973 to cost $358
million. By 1981, the cost had swelled to $4.48 billion.
   Government sources, who asked not to be identified, said Iran is
seeking a $3 billion loan from South Korea to complete construction.
   South Korean companies also are pursuing projects in the Soviet
Union and other socialist countries, with which their
anti-communist government is improving relations.
   Seoul has opened full diplomtic relations with Hungary, Poland,
Yugoslavia and Algeria and established de facto consular ties with
the Soviet Union in the last 12 months.
   The Daewoo group, one of the largest Korean conglomerates, is
pushing hotel projects in Budapest and Moscow. Another
conglomerate, the Hyundai group, has recently signed a 30-year
contract to develop forest land in eastern Siberia.
   With approval from the Seoul government, Hyundai plans to hire
hundreds of communist North Korean workers for its develpment
projects in Siberia.

<TEXT>
   W.R. Grace &amp; Co. on Thursday reported profits
for the final quarter and all of 1989 rose more than 8 percent,
with the company's core specialty chemicals operations putting in a
strong performance.
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, net income totaled $81.8 million,
or 96 cents a share, up 8.3 percent from $75.5 million, or 88 cents
a share in the previous quarter. Revenue came to $1.72 billion, up
4.1 percent from $1.65 billion a year earlier.
   Income from continuing operations jumped 50 percent to $83.4
million, from $55.5 million a year ago.
   During the quarter, Grace benefited from a lower tax effective
rate partly due to a reduction in foreign taxes.
   For the full year, Grace reported net income of $253.2 million,
or $2.97 a share, up 8.4 percent from $233.6 million, or $2.75 a
share. Revenue amounted to $6.11 billion, up 5.7 percent from $5.79
billion in 1988.
   Income from continuing operations rose 34 percent, from $192.1
million to $256.6 million.
   Grace Specialty Chemicals Co. showed strong gains, partly due to
continued growth of the company's worldwide packaging business and
strong results in water treatment activities and specialty
electronics materials, the company said.
   Grace Specialty Chemicals accounts for more than half of W.R.
Grace's total sales and is the focus of its investment strategy.
Specialty chemical operations received about 60 percent of $485
million Grace earmarked for capital expenditures.
   The company cited significantly higher results from the Pacific
Rim area, which Grace predicted will continue to provide
``higher-than-averaged growth rates in the future.''
   W.R. Grace also reported gains in its energy, specialty
businesses and health care groups.
   However, the company was adversely affected in the final quarter
and the full year by foreign currency translations.

   Walter Loeb grew up in a European merchant's
family, spent two decades working for big U.S. department stores
and won acclaim as the dean of retail securities analysts on Wall
Street. He's retiring, but not really.
   ``I'm calling it a graduation,'' he said.``I don't want to stop.
I want to keep going.''
   The new career the silver-haired, bespectacled Loeb is starting
at age 65 will be as a private consultant and newsletter publisher
in a realm in which he is considered an elder statesman.
   One of the hot topics as he peers into the future is the
prospect for global expansion by retailers. Shifting political
winds traversing Eastern Europe and plans for greater harmony among
European Community countries in 1992 could be a stroke of good
fortune for forward-thinking outsiders.
   ``If retailers don't think ahead they will not have the
opportunity because others will do it,'' he said. ``I think that
unless we get ready it will not ever happen.''
   Some prominent merchants have shown it can be done, he said.
They include Toys R Us Inc., The Gap Inc., England's Laura Ashley
Holdings PLC and Italy's Benetton Group.
   ``There are many examples of companies that have been able to do
a global distribution of merchandise and I think that this will be
the case more so in the 1990s,'' he said.
   Loeb's trans-national vision reflects is own immigrant
background. He speaks English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.
   ``I think it's a very exciting new topic,'' he said in an
interview as he was preparing to leave Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., launch
Loeb Associates and start a a monthly newsletter.
   Stores supplying staples that transcend cultural differences
should have the easiest time venturing from home turf. The giant
toy discounter Toys R Us is one of the best examples. ``Toys are
toys. Kids are kids and grandparents are grandparents,'' Loeb said.
   With retailers worldwide looking toward European expansion, he
said, the value of American properties currently for sale has
fallen because the siren song of foreign markets has diverted
investor attention.
   For instance, Loeb said the debt-encumbered Allied Stores Corp.
and Federated Department Stores Inc. chains owned by Canada's
Campeau Corp., which are trying to solve their financial problems
in bankruptcy court, may not fetch as much as they might have if
they were auctioned.
   Loeb said many widely publicized predicaments in retailing were
caused by brash developers with no merchandising expertise. The
financial drain of building retail operations, largely with
borrowed money, overshadowed the core business of selling goods.
   ``I'm sad about developments that have been caused by
developers. I believe very strongly that merchants should be
running the retail businesses,'' Loeb said. ``It's not a science
but it is also not easy to be a good merchant.''
   After the shakeout, more stores will be back in the hands of
retailers, Loeb predicted.
   ``Tomorrow some of these companies will again be smaller
entities,'' he said. ``Entrepreneurs will run them _ maybe with
high debt _ but they will be run on an entrepreneurial basis and
several will be very successful as a result.''
   Even exemplary retailers will have to adapt in the 1990s as
consumers save more, spend less and redirect dollars toward
housewares and home improvement. ``I think the consumer is going to
be very conservative,'' Loeb said.
   Stores appealing to do-it-yourselfers stand to flourish while
specialty apparel retailers _ which had been gobbling up market
share from traditional department stores _ will have a tougher
time, he said.
   Personally, Loeb said he frequents discounters because, like any
savvy consumer, he likes a good bargain. But he patronizes
specialty apparel stores when shopping for suits.
   ``I like the service. I like the attention and I like the
quality of the tailoring,'' he said.
   Friends and acquaintances describe Loeb as loyal and
self-effacing, with a ready sense of humor. He takes obvious pride
in the accomplishments of his three adult daughters and of his wife
of 31 years, Phyllis.
   Professional contacts admire his keen judgment and ferocious
appetite for work.
   ``Underneath an affable exterior he is Germanic in work
habits,'' said Isaac Lagnado, director of research at the
International Council of Shopping Centers.
   Loeb was born Jan. 28, 1925 near Frankfurt. His father, Karl, a
successful button wholesaler, moved his family and business to
Italy in 1936 when Nazi Germany was in the throes of anti-Semitic
political upheaval.
   The Loebs left Italy in 1939 for America. They relocated in Cuba
for 18 months while awaiting entry into this country, where the
elder Loeb established himself as a wholesaler of costume jewelry.
   Walter Loeb was drafted into the Army in 1943 and participated
in the Normandy invasion. He was at Utah beach on D-Day.
   Upon his return to the United States, he studied marketing and
history at New York University and graduated in 1949.
   He spent 20 years learning the retail business from the inside.
He worked at an arm of what is now R.H. Macy &amp; Co., at May
Department Stores Co. and at Allied Stores Corp.
   Loeb turned to consulting in 1969, then came to Wall Street in
1972 as an analyst with the Johnson Redbook Service. He joined
Morgan Stanley in 1974 as a senior analyst,was named a vice
president in 1980 and a principal of the firm in 1984.
   Dubbed the Dean of Wall Street retail analysts by industry
insiders, Loeb also has won recognition internationally. The French
newspaper Le Monde, in a 1988 article on a speech Loeb made in
Paris, referred to him somewhat irreverently as ``the pope of
business.''
   Experience in retailing has helped Loeb cultivate a rapport with
store executives that few in his field enjoy. It also endowed him
with special influence among institutional investors he has advised.
   ``I did everything that one does as you grow up in this
business,'' he said.

   It was in 1974 that 3M scientist Art
Fry, sitting through a boring church sermon, concocted the idea of
self-sticking, yellow notes that can be removed without a trace,
for use in his choir hymn books.
   But it took him four years to convince superiors at 3M that this
idea would sell commercially. Two years later, in April 1980,
Post-it notes premiered, and America has been stuck on them since.
   ``Initial enthusiasm for a piece of note paper with adhesive on
the back wasn't overwhelming,'' Fry said of his battle to persuade
superiors. ``It was hard to sell the concept that people needed a
note pad that would sell at a premium price comparscratch paper.''
   Now, a decade after the product hit the market, many Americans
wonder how they got along without the yelled to ordinary
ow squares they stick to
reports, folders, desks, computers, telephones and refrigerators.
   3M started with two sizes of Post-it notes: 3 inches by 5 inches
and 1{ by 2, available only in yellow. Today, the company says it
has more than 350 varieties, a range of different sizes and colors,
plus many with cartoon characters and messages. There are Post-it
notes specifically made for taking phone messages, marking book
pages and identifying material to be faxed.

   Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., the nation's largest
bottler of Coca-Cola products, said Thursday its fourth-quarter
profit tumbled 88.5 percent from results a year ago that included a
big gain on the sale of assets.
   Coca-Cola Enterprises, which is 49 percent owned by Coca-Cola
Co., said it earned $6.75 million, or 2 cents a share, in the three
months ended Dec. 31 compared with $58.8 million, or 40 cents a
share, a year earlier.
   The 1988 results included a one-time gain of 43 cents a share on
the sale of the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Mid-America and
restructuring charges of 11 cents per share. The net result was
that one-time items lifted earnings by 32 cents a share.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 1.9 percent to $911.8 million from
$895.2 million in 1988.
   For the year, Coca-Cola Enterprises said it earned $71.7
million, or 41 cents per share, in 1989, down 53 percent from
$152.6 million, or $1.03 a share, a year earlier.
   Full-year revenue inched up to $3.88 billion from $3.87 billion.
   ``Although 1989 was a disappointing year in terms of financial
results, we believe it will prove to be an important year in CCE's
development,'' said Brian G. Dyson, president and chief executive
officer. ``We expect operating cash flow and earnings per common
share to increase in 1990.''
   The company has operations across the country, and claims it
handles 43 percent to 44 percent of all Coco-Cola sold in bottles
in cans in the United States.

   Stock prices were slightly higher this
afternoon, as trading activity slowed from earlier levels.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 2.25 points at
2,592.79 at 2 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was off 0.68 point
at noon after dipping nearly 10 points around mid-morning.
   Advancing issues lead decliners by a margin of about 9 to 8 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 801 issues up, 642 down and 452
unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 111.12 million
shares.
   Wall Street analysts said the market was wavering, with little
sense of direction and with many institutional investors on the
sidelines.
   Earlier, concerns about interest rates weakened bond prices and
dragged stocks lower.
   A report by the nation's purchasing executives suggesting the
manufacturing sector weakened further in January contributed to a
downward blip early in the day but did not have a sustained impact,
analysts said. The National Association of Purchasing Management's
index fell to 45.2 percent from 46.7 percent in December.
   A second report by the Commerce Department that construction
spending fell 0.6 percent in December, also had a minor impact.
   ``I think the bad economic news is already built into the
market,'' said Philip Puccio, managing director of equity trading
for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Analysts said despite Wednesday's surge, which ended a
five-session decline, general business conditions remained bearish
and investors were remaining noncommital ahead of next week's
Treasury refunding.
   ``As long as interest rates stay as high, investors are not
going to rush into the market,'' said Brad Weeks, head of equity
trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ``We had a rally
yesterday for technical reasons and technical reasons only.''
   Some investors also were looking to Friday's report on January
unemployment to provide further clues to the economy's direction.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up 0.02 to 181.52.
   At the American Stock Exchange the market value index was up
1.03 to 351.10.

<HEAD>Grumman Earnings Down 39 Percent in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grumman Corp. on Thursday reported a sharp drop
in earnings for the 1989 fourth quarter and year, in part because
of lower sales in its aerospace and electronics sectors.
   In a statement, the company said it planned to reduce its work
force by about 1,000 by the end of 1990, following 3,000 cuts in
1989 that left the defense contractor with 28,900 employees.
   An imminent decline in defense spending by the federal
government because of easing East-West tensions has been blamed for
a poor outlook for the defense industry.
   For the period ended Dec. 31, Grumman said profits dropped 39
percent to $14.8 million, or 41 cents a share, from $24.1 million,
or 70 cents a share, in the same 1988 period.
   Sales for the quarter fell 16 percent to $867 million from $1.04
million.
   For the full year, net income was $67.3 million, or $1.91 a
share, down 22 percent from $86.5 million, or $2.50 a share, in
1988. Sales declined 2.5 percent to $3.56 billion from $3.65
billion.
   Grumman said sales from its aerospace division fell 5.8 percent
because of winding down of two development programs and delivery of
fewer production aircraft to the Navy.
   Grumman's electronics sales declined 13.3 percent because of
fewer test equipment deliveries, reduced requirements for Grumman
aircraft and lower revenue from an Air Force and Army joint radar
program.
   ``Even in a no-growth defense budget cycle, there will be plenty
of business for Grumman and others who are efficient, reliable
suppliers of quality products,'' Grumman Chairman John O'Brien said
in a statement.
   The statement said Grumman has a backlog of $6.9 billion, while
the proposed 1991 defense budget funds Grumman programs at $2.65
billion, about the same as in 1990.

<TEXT>
   Construction spending advanced last year at
its slowest pace since the 1982 recession, the government said
Thursday. Analysts blamed the weakness on high interest rates,
overbuilding and a sluggish economy.
   The Commerce Department said residential, non-residential and
government construction spending totaled $414.7 billion, a 1.2
percent increase over 1988 but the smallest gain since a 5.1
percent decline in 1982.
   Contributing to the poor showing was a 0.6 percent decline in
December spending, which was buffeted by record cold weather over
most of the country east of the Rockies.
   Spending totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $414.6
billion in December, nearly erasing a 0.7 percent gain in November.
It was the lowest one-month increase since a decline of 1 percent
last June.
   Analysts said Federal Reserve actions that kept interest rates
relatively high through most of the year not only made construction
more expensive, but also slowed the economy and thus made sales
more difficult.
   ``Plus, you had a number of good years of construction'' leading
up to 1989, said David Berson, chief economist for the Federal
National Mortgage Association. ``Eventually, you have all the
houses and office buildings that you need. You run out of pent-up
demand.''
   Because of the lessening demand and the state of the economy,
Berson said, ``1990, at best, will be about what it was in 1989 and
could even fall a little bit.''
   Another factor beginning to worry builders and analysts alike is
the adverse effect of the savings and loan bailout law on the
availability of construction financing.
   ``The law limits the amount that savings and loans can lend to
any one construction company,'' said economist Steven Cochran of
WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., who added that efforts are under
way to resolve the problem.
   Analysts point to widespread vacancies in office buildings as
evidence of overbuilding in the non-residential sector, which
continued to grow last year.
   Non-residential spending was up 2.4 percent to $99.4 billion in
1989 and 4.3 percent to an annual rate of $96.7 billion in December.
   Residential spending, representing 50 percent of construction
spending, was off 1.1 percent to $195.9 billion last year and down
0.7 percent in December to an annual rate of $191 billion.
   But single-family construction picked up 0.4 percent to an
annual rate of $144.3 billion in December, the third straight
advance after falling for eight months. Multi-family spending,
which has fallen every month since July, was down 2.8 percent to a
$20.6 billion annual rate.
   The usually volatile government sector rose 3.8 percent to $84
billion in 1989 and 2.9 percent to a $91.1 billion annual rate in
December, when it was boosted by a 9.3 percent gain in highway and
street projects. Government projects account for about 20 percent
of construction spending.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Shares finished slightly higher after a dull
session Thursday on London's Stock Exchange.
   At the London close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 8.5 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,345.8, just
above its session low of 2,343.6. At its highest, the index briefly
touched 2,355.4 points.
   Volume totaled 470.5 million shares, down from 574.9 million on
Wednesday.
   Although shares were buoyed at the outset by Wall Street's
robust performance Wednesday, any support for the market was
withdrawn at midafternoon following an unconvincing start from New
York stocks.
   ``The London market wants to go higher but we're uncertain over
Wall Street,'' said one chief dealer. ``We're seeing many
institutions checking prices, but they aren't going to order any
stocks until they're convinced that Wall Street has stabilized.''
   Several market watchers said a computer-driven trade at
midafternoon, weighted heavily to the sell side, drove shares down
from session peaks. Others said a disappointment with the early
direction of the Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street
undermined the London market.
   By the end of the London day, the Dow Jones average was down
2.25 points at 2,588.29.
   In London, the Financial Times 30-share index was up 2.0 points
at 1,866.0. The Financial Times 500-share index closed at 1,272.49,
up 3.19 points.

<HEAD>Livestock Producers Say Woolite Even Works When Wool's Still on
Sheep</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You probaby won't see any commercials
about it soon, but some livestock producers say they turn to
Woolite to brighten up their sheep for competition.
   ``It's designed for wool, and they're wool,'' said Marshall
Eaton as he was blow-drying a lamb recently at the 94th
Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show and Rodeo.
   ``We used to use Mrs. Stewart's Bluing, what your grandmother
used,'' said Eaton, an agriculture teacher at Tuscola in West
Texas. ``I guess people switched over at least 10 years ago,
whenever Woolite came out.''
   The household wool cleaner was among a number of well-known
products used to help Junior Lamb Show entrants look their best,
the Fort Worth Star-Telegram found.
   The newspaper said it found used bottles of Woolite and Ivory,
Palmolive and Dawn dishwashing liquids among the containers
discarded in the Sheep Barn washing area.
   Guy Reinarz, of New Braunfels, said he first uses a stronger
soap on his sheep and ``then I go back with Woolite. It seems to
leave the wool a lot softer.''
   There is nothing to indicate on the product's label that Woolite
can turn dingy gray Rambouillet lambs into sparkling white show
creatures.
   ``Trust Woolite _ no shrinking, stretching, fading,'' it says.
It also notes it works on ``all your fine washables ... of silk,
wool, cashmere, cotton, polyester...''
   But Bill McClaran, of Granbury, said he prefers Palmolive for
whitening those dingy lambs.
   ``When you run out of Palmolive, you use Woolite,'' McClaran
said.
   Regardless of what brand they use, livestock producers agree
that it is extremely important to have lambs' coats looking their
brightest when they are led before the sharp-eyed judges.
   Said Eaton, ``It's a little bit of a beauty contest.''

   The stock market closed lower today after
struggling through a featureless session punctuated by
profit-taking and continued interest-rate concerns.
   The market opened higher taking its cue from the bond market
which continued to advance following Wednesday's strong gains.
However, analysts said concerns about interest rates later weakened
bond prices and dragged stocks lower. Profit-taking after
Wednesday's strong gains also pressured stocks.
   A report by the nation's purchasing executives suggesting the
manufacturing sector weakened further in January contributed to a
sharp downward blip around mid-morning but did not have a sustained
impact, analysts said. The National Association of Purchasing
Management's index fell to 45.2 percent from 46.7 percent in
December.
   A second report by the Commerce Department that showed
construction spending fell 0.6 percent in December, added some
minor pressure.
   ``I think the bad economic news is already built into the

for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   After hitting lows at mid-morning, stocks rebounded slightly
then drifted in a narrow range the remainder of the session.
   Analysts said despite Wednesday's surge, which ended a

and investors were remaining noncommital ahead of Friday's
unemployment report and next week's Treasury refunding.

<HEAD>Economy Declined Sharply in January, Purchasing Group Says</HEAD>

   The U.S. economy fell sharply in January for the
ninth consecutive month and at the greatest rate of decline since
the last recession, the nation's purchasing managers said Thursday
in a widely watched survey.
   The monthly report, which substantiated other evidence of an
economic slowdown, contributed to a downward blip in stock trading
early in the day but it didn't last, analysts said. It had little
effect on bond trading.
   David Wyss, an economist for the forecasting firm
DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc., said the financial markets were ``too busy
worrying about the State of the Union address last night.''
   The markets were preoccupied with the implications of President
Bush's proposals Wednesday night for troop reductions in Europe,
which could lead to a lower federal deficit and, in turn, lower
interest rates, Wyss said.
   Alan Levenson, an economist for Salomon Brothers Inc., said the
purchasing survey result was about what the markets expected, so
the reaction was not unusual.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said its
monthly index fell in January to 45.2 percent, down from 46.7
percent in December.
   A reading below 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy
is declining, while above 50 indicates expansion, the group said.
The index has been below 50 for the past nine months.
   The figures were adjusted to reflect an update of the seasonal
adjustment factors of the U.S. Commerce Department that are used to
calculate the index.
   ``It confirms what we've been saying and what's been obvious for
a while, which is that the economy is slowing down rather
dramatically,'' Wyss said. ``But we don't see signs of recession.''
   Wyss pointed out that a key part of the survey, supplier
deliveries, was up in January, to 47.2 percent from 42.5 percent in
December. The figure shows how fast companies receive goods they
order; an increase means supplier companies are operating at a
higher capacity.
   Wyss said this figure is important because it is a component of
the Commerce Department's monthly leading indicators, the
government's chief economic forecasting gauge.
   However, the purchasing group attributed the increase to fewer
weather-related delays in producing and transporting goods.
   The group's new export orders figure also continued to show
relative strength, said the group, based in Tempe, Ariz. The
seasonally unadjusted export orders index increased to 55.5 percent
from 53 percent in December.
   The new orders portion of the group's survey fell significantly
in January, the employment component declined for the 11th
consecutive month and the inventories index was the lowest since
1986.
   ``The manufacturing economy entered 1990 on a dismal note,''
said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the group's survey committee. He
said it was the greatest rate of decline since December 1982, when
the nation was starting to pull out of the last recession.
   He said the group's overall monthly index averaged 48.9 percent
for all of 1989. That figure is consistent with real gross national
product growth of about 2.2 percent after adding 0.6 percent to
reflect the rebound in agricultural output last year from the 1988
drought, he said.
   Bretz said the index would have to fall below 44 percent before
it indicates a decline in real GNP.
   Doug Handler, an economist for Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., said the
report was weaker than he expected, but that other recent
statistics show the economy's manufacturing sector is ``bottoming
out in general.''
   The survey is based on responses from executives who buy goods
at more than 300 industrial companies.

<HEAD>4th-Qtr Profit Up at Gannett, Knight-Ridder; Loss at McGraw-Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gannett Co. Inc. reported Thursday its profit rose 8.1 percent
in the fourth quarter while another media giant, Knight-Ridder
Inc., posted a 31.2 percent increase in earnings from continuing
operations for the same period.
   Meanwhile, McGraw-Hill Inc. reported a loss of $98.3 million for
the quarter as a result of previously disclosed plans to take
unusual charges.
   Gannett said its earnings increased despite a weakening economy
partly because of the diversity of its holdings.
   The Arlington, Va.-based company, which publishes USA Today and
81 other daily newspapers, said it earned $127.4 million, or 79
cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31 compared with
$117.8 million, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 7 percent to $968.6 million from
$905.3 million a year earlier.
   For the year, Gannett earned $397.5 million, or $2.47 a share,
up 9.3 percent from $364.5 million, or $2.26 a share, a year
earlier.
   Operating revenue rose 6 percent to $3.52 billion from $3.31
billion a year earlier.
   The company said the latest results reflected a gain on the sale
of The New Mexican in Santa Fe, N.M., that was offset by operating
losses of GTG Entertainment and costs associated with its plan to
end its involvement with GTG ventures, which produced an ill-fated
television show ``USA Today on TV.''
   The company said advertising revenue from USA Today rose 13
percent for the quarter. It did not report earnings results from
the newspaper, but spokeswoman Sheila Gibbons said it had a
unspecified loss. She said the newspaper expects to post its first
annual profit in 1990.
   Gannett's operations also include 35 non-daily newspapers, 10
television stations and 16 radio stations.
   Knight-Ridder, based in Miami, said its earnings from continuing
operations rose to $55.1 million, or $1.05 a share, up from $42.0
million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 5.8 percent to $607.8 million from
$574.7 million a year earlier.
   For the year, the newspaper and information services company
said its eanings from continuing operations rose to $179.8 million,
or $3.43 a share, up from $146.8 million, or $2.59 a share, a year
earlier. The 1989 results include a gain of about $30 million from
the sale of a Pasadena, Calif., newspaper.
   Revenue for the year rose 8.9 percent to $2.27 billion from
$2.08 billion a year earlier.
   ``Our newspapers showed substantial profit and margin increases
thanks to improvements in Miami and weaker newsprint prices,'' said
Robert F. Singleton, chief financial officer at Knight-Ridder.
   Knight-Ridder owns 29 daily newspapers, including the Miami
Herald, Philadelphia Inquirer, Detroit Free Press and San Jose
(Calif.) Mercury News, and operates a growing business information
services division.
   New York-based McGraw-Hill said its fourth-quarter loss was
$2.01 a share in contrast to earnings of $55 million, or $1.13 a
share, a year earlier.
   The latest loss reflects a charge of $152 million after taxes
reflecting a realignment of operations, writedowns associated with
its Data Resources and other units, the shutdown of its general
books unit and reserves for severance payments associated with
staff reductions of more than 1,000 positions.
   The company said in December that it planned to make those
charges against its fourth-quarter earnings.
   Fourth-quarter revenue rose 8.2 percent to $518 million from
$479 million a year earlier.
   For the year, McGraw-Hill said it earned $47.8 million, or 98
cents a share, down from $185.5 million, or $3.83 a share, a year
earlier.
   Revenue for the year rose 6.9 percent to $1.79 billion from
$1.67 billion a year earlier.
   The company said fourth-quarter results from educational and
professional publishing benefited from the performances of college
publishing, legal and international book businesses.
   It said Business Week magazine had a strong performance, and its
financial services operations continued to show improvement depsite
an operating loss at its Data Resources unit and consolidation in
the brokerage industry. Its school publishing venture with
Macmillan had an operating loss for the quarter, which is
seasonally weak.
   Joseph L. Dionne, chairman and chief executive of McGraw-Hill,
said he expects the company to earn $3.50 to $4 a share excluding
non-recurring gains in 1990.

<TEXT>
   In seeking to entice Americans to save more
money, the White House is tackling a job that has been an
overwhelming challenge to other American institutions, including
motherhood.
   It begins with parents exhorting youngsters to put pennies in a
piggy bank. The lesson is developed throughout schooling. The
challenge is then taken on by banks, by companies with payroll
savings plans and by others.
   To some degree, all have failed, which is why the Bush
administration now wants to attack the problem with tax
enticements, promising not to levy a penny against certain savings
accounts left to build and age.
   Savings, it is sometimes contended, are the reason the Japanese
have gained such economic prominence. Their high savings rate _ 15
percent to 20 percent of income, sometimes more _ finances swift
industrial expansion.
   But using the Japanese as a model _ or European nations which
recently have saved at a rate double that of Americans _ might not
work. Americans are very different people with very different
habits and approaches to life.
   In the past 60 years, the only time in which the American
savings rate came close to recent Japanese levels was when,
literally, they were forced to save during World War II. Payrolls
were big, but there was little to buy.
   At the time, some officials thought they had stumbled on a truth
_ that savings bonds issued by the government and carrying the full
faith and credit of Uncle Sam had something to do with it. But the
program faded after the war.
   The savings binge ended, in fact, with the war. In the five
years 1941-1945, the rate averaged better than 20 percent. In 1946,
it dived to 8.5 percent, and the following year to 3.1 percent,
lower than the current level.
   Except for those years, there has never been a double-digit
savings rate _ the amount saved as a percent of disposable or
after-tax income. The rate has moved up and down, but the highest
was 9.4 percent in 1973.
   Moreover, the reasons for fluctuations aren't entirely clear.
Some of the evidence even contradicts pet theories, such as that
economic stability encourages savings.
   That wasn't true in the early 1970s, when inflation ran wild. On
average the first six years of that decade had the highest savings
rate of any similar since the 1940s. In 1974 the rate reached 9.3
percent, inflation 10 percent.
   That is, the second highest one-year savings rate since World
War II was accompanied by the first double-digit inflation rate in
modern times. It was a tragedy for savers, since inflation exceeded
the rate of interest earned.
   It was in the early 1980s that concern steadily mounted. In
1983, the rate dipped to just 5.4 percent, and to 4.4 percent in
1985, and from then until last year it remained under 5 percent.
   That decline is now seized upon by those who link it to the rise
in federal budget deficits. They could be correct. In fact, when
evidence developed last year that it was possible to cut the
deficit, the rate rose above 5 percent.
   While the budget-deficit link might seem a strong one, there is
another school of thought. Economist Edward Yardeni and others see
a connection with an entirely different set of figures, demographic
ones.
   According to them, the reason for low savings rates since the
early and mid-1980s is the bulge of younger people working its way
through the economy.
   As these people get older and put their big-spending years
behind them, says Yardeni, they will become savers, content to sit
on the couch and watch television instead of renting cars for ski
weekends and other entertainment.
   There are still more theories.
   One thesis is that Americans have pensions, Social Security and
large equity in homes, and so have a sense of security that allows
them to forego ``saving,'' as narrowly defined.
   Another: Why save if inflation is just going to wipe it out?
   Another: In view of recent shenanigans, why entrust savings to
banks and savings and loan associations that will only spend it
their way?
   One more: Who has money to save?

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Jan. 22, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,226.5 billion from $3,217.5 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,044.2 billion from $4,038.8 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $794.1 billion from $791.2 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,207.0 billion, a 7.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of increase from the
previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,033.4 billion, up 3.1 percent,
while M1 rose 6.0 percent to an average of $793.0 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $813 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$348 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $303.7 billion billion in the two-week period
ended Jan. 24, up from $299.4 billion two weeks earlier.

<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp., which has delayed
distribution of its latest desktop computer because of a faulty
chip, said Thursday its quarterly profit slipped for only the
second time in its eight-year history.
   For the three-month period ended Dec. 31, the Houston-based
maker of personal computers had earnings of $79.05 million, or
$1.84 per share, down 14 percent from $91.91 million, or $2.18 per
share, during the same quarter in 1988.
   Sales totaled $788.14 million, up 18 percent from $667.67
million in 1988's fourth quarter.
   Compaq, which took just four years to become a Fortune 500
company, last posted a year-to-year decline in quarterly earnings
in the third quarter of 1984, when profits were $1.8 million
compared with $3.8 million in the 1983 period.
   Compaq said in November it expected its fourth-quarter profit to
be off because it detected a fault in an Intel Corp. chip, causing
delays in distributing new products, said Mike Swavely, president
of the company's North American division.
   Engineers found a way to work with the chips several months ago,
but Intel contacted Compaq last week saying there was another
problem.
   The company said it had planned to ship its new Deskpro 486-25
computer Feb. 1, but the date was set back due to the new trouble.
Swavely said the model should be distributed during the current
quarter.
   Compaq also blamed the profit drop to a near-doubling of
fourth-quarter research and development costs to $38 million,
increased costs associated with new-product introductions, and to a
softening U.S. market for personal computers.
   For all of 1989, Compaq reported earnings of $333.3 million, or
$7.77 per share, up 31 percent from $255.2 million, or $6.30 per
share, in 1988. Sales totaled $2.87 billion, up 39 percent from the
$2.1 billion in 1988.
   President Rod Canion said the introduction of new products
contributed to the company's success in 1989.
   Besides the delayed DeskPro 486-25, the company introduced two
new desktop computers and notebook-sized laptop computers.
   Sales outside North America contributed 46 percent of Compaq's
revenue for 1989, Canion said, helping compensate for slowing
domestic sales of personal computers. To support growing
international sales, two new subsidiaries were opened in Norway and
Denmark.

<TEXT>
   A bankruptcy judge refused Thursday to require
two big department store companies to pay as much as $20 million in
deposits to utilities, which feared the retailers couldn't
guarantee payment of bills.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. said that if the
financial condition of the Campeau Corp. retailers Federated
Department Stores and Allied Stores deteriorates, he would require
a one-month deposit.
   But he said the 596 utilities serving Federated and Allied
businesses haven't shown that the retailers are deadbeats.
   ``There will not be a requirement at this time that a deposit be
made to any of these utilities,'' Aug said.
   In another development, bankruptcy court Trustee Conrad J.
Morgenstern announced formation of committees of unsecured
creditors for Federated and Allied.
   The committees, which could have broad influence over a
bankruptcy reorganization plan, include representatives from Liz
Claiborne Inc., Sony Corp. of America and Heller Financial Inc.
   Leon Mener, a lawyer for Consolidated Edison Co. of New York,
said he was disappointed Aug didn't offer utilities security. Mener
had argued that Federated and Allied can't guarantee their credit
will last.
   ``What we are concerned about is what happens at the end of the
process that may drag on for years and may have enormous
administrative costs,'' he said.
   Campeau, a Toronto-based developing company that bought
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. in the
1980s with billions of dollars in borrowed money, put them under
bankruptcy court protection Jan. 15 because of rising difficulties
in repaying the debt.
   It was the biggest bankruptcy filing in retail history. Both
Campeau subsidiaries are based in Cincinnati.
   Federated and Allied store chains include Bloomingdale's,
Abraham &amp; Strauss, Maas Bros. Jordan Marsh, Lazarus and Rich's.
Utilities represented at Thursday's hearing included New York
Telephone Co., Florida Power &amp; Light, AT&amp;T, Cincinnati Gas &amp;
Electric Co., and Puget Sound Power &amp; Light.
   Aug also approved a request by Federated and Allied to renew a
$300,000-a-year contract with the recruiter who is finding a
chairman and chief executive officer to replace John W. Burden III,
who retired Wednesday. Aug approved resumption of severance pay and
about $20,000 in monthly retirement benefits that had been
suspended.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration opened a heavy
lobbying campaign for its initiatives to cut the capital gains tax
and boost personal savings on Thursday, with chief of staff John
Sununu accusing Democrats of being ``the party of taxes.''
   Sununu rebuked Democrats for failing to join Republicans in
giving Bush a standing ovation during the State of the Union
address Wednesday night, when Bush declared the federal budget
could be balanced ``with no new taxes.''
   ``What I was surprised at last night was how stark the
definition between the two parties was in terms of the applause,''
Sununu told a White House briefing.
   Democrats bristled at Sununu's attack, coming barely 12 hours
after Bush told Congress in the nationally broadcast address that
Americans ``did not send us here to bicker'' and ``once again, I
offer my hand to all of you.''
   ``I would hope that Mr. Sununu would convince the president to
reverse his views on opposition to lowering taxes on working
Americans,'' Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate
Budget Committee, said in reference to a Democratic plan to cut
Social Security payroll taxes.
   Meanwhile, Bush renewed his push for a lower capital gains tax
by sending it to Congress wrapped in a package containing two
proposals designed to provide tax breaks to middle-income Americans.
   One would establish so-called tax-free ``family savings
accounts.'' The other would allow up to $10,000 to be withdrawn
without penalty from Individual Retirement Accounts to help finance
first-time home purchases.
   Bush, at a ceremony at the White House to kick off the lobbying
effort and send the legislation to Congress, said his package would
provide ``economic benefits for all citizens.''
   He vowed to work closely with the Democratic-led Congress on the
package, which the administration hopes will help sidetrack a
politically appealing plan by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
to lower Social Security taxes.
   On Capitol Hill, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady presented the
administration's case on the tax proposals to the Senate Budget
Committee. ``We believe that the federal government should foster
an environment that is conducive to saving, and we have a plan to
achieve this objective,'' he testified.
   But Sasser later told reporters that Bush's ``family-savings
account'' plan was little more than ``window dressing'' and would
be rejected by Congress.
   ``It is simply a crumb that they appear to be tossing in the
direction of middle class people as a way to cover their flank''
because of administration opposition to Moynihan's plan to roll
back last month's Social Security tax increase and to provide an
additional tax cut next year.
   Social Security taxes rose to 7.65 percent from 7.51 percent on
Jan. 1.
   Sununu defended the Bush economic proposals and was sharply
critical of Democrats.
   ``The Democrats, by refusing to stand up when the president
suggested that you didn't need new taxes, was (making) a party
statement,'' Sununu said.
   ``That ought to make the American public ask whether or not they
might be trying to tell them that they really still want to be seen
as the party of taxes,'' he added.
   Although Bush was applauded many times during his State of the
Union address, and received standing ovations from all on four
occasions, when he promised to balance the budget ``with no new
taxes,'' Republicans rose en masse to applaud him. Democrats
remained seated.
   At the Senate hearing, Brady and Michael Boskin, the president's
chief economic adviser, were criticized by Democrats for presenting
Congress with an unrealistic spending plan which failed to
adequately attack the budget deficit.
   ``The president and those of you who advise him are guilty of a
failure of leadership,'' said Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D. ``We are
finding ourselves in a weakened position internationally and we
don't seem to be able to summon the poltiical courage or the
political will to fashion a game plan that really has much merit.''
   Elsewhere, House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., told reporters
that his party agrees something needs to be done about America's
plummeting savings rate, but rejects Bush's tax cut.
   ``The capital gains tax reduction would give people who are in
the highest 1 percent of the nation's income 80 percent of the
benefits,'' Foley said. ``That's not the idea we have about
encouraging savings.''
   Democrats instead would prefer to talk about individual
retirement accounts that can be used used to protect up to $2,000 a
year from taxes for later use in retirement or as a down payment on
a first house.
   The administration's ``family savings account'' proposal would
allow couples to save up to $5,000 a year and individuals up to
$2,500 and not pay income tax on the interest if the deposits are
held for at least seven years.
   The other ``sweetner'' in the capital-gains package is a
proposal to permit up to $10,000 to be withdrawn prematurely from
an Individual Retirement Account, without penalty, to help finance
first-time home purchases.
   Although Bush initially proposed reducing the capital gains tax
to 15 percent, his new proposal would exclude from taxation up to
30 percent of the capital gain from the sale of an asset held three
years or longer.
   That works out to an effective tax rate of 19.6 percent for
taxpayers in the 28 percent bracket.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed to pay
Massachusetts $1 million in a settlement announced Thursday, the
latest settlement arising from the Wall Street firm's guilty plea
to securities fraud charges.
   Massachusetts became the 41st state to reach such an agreement
with Drexel. The amount was the largest settlement ever paid to the
state in a securities matter, according to Secretary of State
Michael J. Connolly.
   Drexel pleaded guilty last September in U.S. District Court in
New York to six felonies and paid $650 million to settle a range of
fraud allegations stemming from the government's lengthy
investigation of insider trading on Wall Street.
   Drexel also agreed to dozens of administrative changes and
unprecedented federal supervision in settling civil charges with
the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Under the settlement with the federal government, Drexel paid
$300 million in fines to the government and set aside $350 million
for investors who can prove they were harmed by the firm's actions.
Those who may be entitled to restitution include people who bought
stocks in about 20 allegedly fraudulent transactions cited by the
SEC.
   The settlement with Massachusetts is one of the largest the firm
has reached with states so far. Drexel paid Illinois about $1.2
million and Missouri announced a $1 million settlement on Wednesday.
   With the Massachusetts agreement, Drexel has paid states
settlements totaling $8.3 million.
   ``We're pleased we were able to settle it and now we can go
about our business,'' said Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman.
   The $1 million settlement will go into the state's general fund,
Connolly said.
   Connolly said the $275,000 originally offered by the firm was
inadequate.
   Settling with the states relieves Drexel of possible litigation
and frees state regulators from having to investigate the firm's
trading activities from 1984 to 1986, when the SEC alleged the
fraud occurred.
   The settlements also generally preserve the firm's ability to
underwrite securities and do other business in the states. Most
states can revoke a company's right to do business if the firm is
convicted or admits to committing a felony. Drexel abandoned the
retail stock brokerage business last year.
   In Massachusetts, the agreement includes a stipulation that
Drexel must not solicit any new retail trade without first
notifying the state Securities Division and demonstrating that
compliance procedures are in place.
   The firm also cannot sponsor private placements to individuals
and must work with the Securities Division to identify any state
investors injured by the illegal sale of Drexel junk bonds. Victims
would be entitled to place claims with the $350 million
compensation fund Drexel established.
   In addition, Drexel must hire an independent consultant to
scrutinize company policies and submit compliance reports; hire an
ombudsman to receive and investigate complaints; finance annual
audits by the state Securities Division and establish an oversight
committee to review its internal procedures.
   Connolly said he did not know whether any Massachusetts
residents were hurt by Drexel sales.
   Drexel has been working with state regulators for the past eight
months, and Connolly said officials monitoring the firm during that
time have given them high marks.

<HEAD>Gold Futures Rebound As Traders Rethink IMF News</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices rose sharply Thursday, nearly erasing the
previous session's losses as traders reconsidered the significance
of a U.S. proposal that the International Monetary Fund sell some
of its gold stockpile.
   Silver futures also posted strong gains in trading on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   On other commodity markets, sugar futures rose in volatile
trading while energy, livestock and crop futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $5.40 to $6.20 higher with the contract for
delivery in February up $5.60 at $418 a troy ounce. Silver futures
finished 10 cents to 10.5 cents higher with February at $5.297 a
troy ounce.
   The February gold contract fell $5.70 Wednesday in reaction to a
Dow Jones News Service report that the United States had proposed
the IMF sell $4 billion worth of gold to help some Third World
countries make past-due loan payments.
   The Treasury Department later said the proposal was for the IMF
to ``mobilize'' about $1.2 billion worth of gold. That would not
necessarily mean the metal would be sold on the open market but
might be swapped for U.S. dollars and other hard currencies in
deals with governments and central banks.
   The haziness of the proposal and the lack of overt support for
the idea among the IMF's 151 other nation-members were keys to
Thursday's rally, analysts said.
   ``Even if the United States makes this proposal and even if the
IMF agrees to do it, it's going to be a long time before they
actually sell any gold,'' said analyst James Steel of Refco Inc.
   Anne Orten, a vice president of Deak International Inc., a large
dealer of currencies and precious metals, said gold traders
``probably overreacted'' to the IMF news.
   She said that when the market opened Thursday with no further
sell-off, many traders who had sold contracts on Wednesday bought
back those contracts, which pushed the market higher.
   Sugar futures rose moderately on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange in a volatile session where the market rallied
strongly on rumors of Cuban-related buying, only to collapse into
the minus column before struggling back near the close.
   Some market watchers speculated there could be a sell-off Friday
in reaction to a Brazilian federal court decision, announced after
the close, clearing the way for some large shipments of Brazilian
sugar that the Brazilian government had sought to divert to its
alcohol fuel program.
   Sugar futures finished .07 cent to .14 cent higher with March at
14.8 cents a pound.
   Energy futures finished mostly higher on New York Mercantile
Exchange with support stemming from a threatened strike by U.S.
oilworkers against individual companies if contract negotiations
fail.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 6 cents lower to 8 cents
higher with March at $22.70 a barrel; heating oil was .82 cent
lower to .54 cent higher with March at 56.74 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .75 cent lower to .12 cent higher with March
at 62.70 a gallon.
   Corn and soybean futures ended lower and wheat finished mixed on
the Chicago Board of Trade after a midday rally failed.
   Wheat settled { cent lower to 1} cents higher with March at
$3.75\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 1 cent lower with March at
$2.37{ a bushel; oats were { cent lower to 1 cent higher with March
at $1.35} a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 2} cents lower with
March at $5.59} a bushel.
   Cattle futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in positioning ahead of Friday's semi-annual cattle
inventory report. Pork futures weakened in line with soft cash
markets.
   Live cattle futures settled .35 cent lower to .22 cent higher
with February at 79 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent
lower to .30 cent higher with March at 82.62 cents a pound; live
hogs were unchanged to .40 cent lower with February at 48.30 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent lower to .03 cent higher
with February at 50.20 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Murphy Plans to Step Down as Cap Cities-ABC Chief Exec in June</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman and chief executive of Capital
Cities-ABC Inc., Thomas S. Murphy, said Thursday he plans to step
down as chief executive on June 1 and will recommend that President
Daniel B. Burke succeed him.
   Murphy, who will stay on as chairman, and Burke have worked
together at the giant media company for nearly 30 years and it had
been expected that Murphy would turn the chief executive post over
to Burke at some point.
   ``That's not a surprise,'' said one securities analyst who spoke
on condition that he not be identified. ``Burke has appeared with
Murphy at every corporate presentation Murphy has made over the
past 10 years. They always refer to each other as partners.''
   The analyst said he did not expect any change of direction at
Capital Cities-ABC if the board of directors approves the
recommendation, as is expected. The next board meeting is in March.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Capital Cities-ABC
rose 37{ cents a share to $515.37{.
   The company owns the ABC Television Network, eight television
stations, six radio networks and 21 radio stations and has
publishing interests.
   Murphy has been chairman and chief executive since 1966 and has
been with the company since it was created in 1954. Burke has been
president and chief operating officer since 1972 and joined the
company in 1961.
   Murphy disclosed his plans Wednesday night at a meeting of the
company's senior managers in Phoenix, Capital Cities-ABC said in a
statement.
   A company spokeswoman, Julie Hoover, said Murphy and Burke both
were traveling and were unavailable for comment.
   It was expected that Burke would retain his current titles for
the time being.
   Typically, the chief executive maps a company's plans for growth
while the president oversees day-to-day operations.
   In a memo to employees, Murphy noted that he turns 65 on May 31
and wrote, ``I have long felt that successful companies grow most
effectively under the leadership of younger management.'' Burke
turns 61 on Sunday.
   ``I would continue to be involved, but Dan would be the final
decision-maker,'' he said.
   Murphy joined Capital Cities Communications Inc., the
predecessor company to Capital Cities-ABC, when it was founded in
1954. The company started with a UHF television station and an AM
radio station in Albany, N.Y.
   The company operated principally in broadcasting for 13 years
until moving into the publishing business in 1968, starting with
trade publication and then newspapers. Murphy became president in
1964.
   The company's most ambitious move came in 1986 when it acquired
the American Broadcasting Companies Inc. for $3.5 billion.
   Before joining Capital Cities, Murphy had worked as an
industrial oil salesman, an advertising account executive and a
product manager for a consumer products company.
   Burke joined the company in 1961 as general manager of WTEN-TV
in Albany and was named general manager of WJR-AM and WJR-FM in
Detroit in 1964.
   He served as president of the company's publishing division from
1969 until his election as president and chief operating officer in
1972.
   In addition to its broadcasting interests, Capital Cities-ABC
publishes nine daily newspapers, numerous weekly newspapers and
shopping guides and various periodicals and books. It has an 80
percent interest in the ESPN cable network and smaller stakes in
the Arts &amp; Entertainment and Lifetime cable networks.

   Energy futures finished mixed Thursday as crude
oil and wholesale gasoline prices succumbed to profit-taking. Home
heating oil futures fell amid selling tied to reduced demand
expectations.
   Analysts said volume was mostly low throughout the session with
sporadic bursts of trading. The selling to collect profits mostly
was confined to late in the day after various contracts had broken
through psychologically significant levels.
   The contract for March delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, ended 2 cents higher at $22.70 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Later
contract months also posted small changes, mostly declines.
   The March contract for No. 2 heating oil lost 0.82 cent to 56.74
cents a gallon, adding to Wednesday's decline of 1.64 cents. The
April contract ended down 0.14 cent at 55.75 cents a gallon while
delivery contracts farther into the future settled higher.
   March unleaded gasoline, which fell 1.02 cents on Wednesday,
settled 0.9 cent higher at 62.70 cents a gallon. Later contracts
also rose modestly.
   A bearish weekly report released late Tuesday by the American
Petroleum Institute continued to be a drag on futures prices,
analysts said. The API figures showed supplies of refined petroleum
products were more plentiful than previously believed.

   The chairman of a Senate panel said Thursday
that he wants to hold hearings into the jurisdictional dispute
between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the agency that
regulates the futures industry.
   ``I'm fully aware of the hornet's nest one can hit here,'' said
Sen. Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., about possible opposition from
farm area congressmen who oversee the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.
   A long-simmering rivalry between the SEC, which regulates the
stock and bond markets and the CFTC, which oversees the nation's
futures markets, heated up last year when a federal appeals court
ruled in favor of the CFTC.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held that financial
products that contain any aspects of a futures contract should be
regulated by the CFTC _ not the SEC.
   SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden, who testified before Dodd's
securities subcommittee of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban
Affairs Committee Thursday, has been very vocal about resolving the
dispute which he says is driving new financial products out of the
country.
   ``We are the only country in the world that has a separate
agency to regulate the cash market and the derivative market,''
Breeden said in response to a question by Dodd.
   ``I would very much like to see us debate this issue in this
Congress,'' said Dodd. ``I realize it's one that will raise some
feathers in certain quarters but it needs to be addressed.''
   The subcommittee's ranking Republican, Sen. John Heinz of
Pennsylvania, said he supported Dodd's suggestion for a public
airing of the issue.
   In the past, members of committees in both the House and Senate
have been careful not to tred outside their bailiwick, as a sign of
professional courtesy and political expediency, despite occasional
calls to resolve the dispute.
   ``It is still a critical issue,'' said Heinz. ``We shouldn't be
deterred from examining even the most fearful subject _ politically
fearful _ in this case.''
   Heinz added that he hoped Dodd will ``brave the wasps, hornets
and spiders _ and probably a few snakes as well _ that are likely
to crawl out of the woodwork.''
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago last summer
ruled that the SEC overstepped its authority in authorizing three
securities exchanges it regulates to trade in a hybrid financial
instrument known as a stock basket.
   Technically called an ``index participation,'' the product
resembles a basket of stocks because it allows investors to buy or
sell something with a value tied to broad stock market indexes,
such as the Standard &amp; Poors 500.
   But the appeals court held that such products come under the
CFTC's supervision if they have any element of a futures product.
   The appeals court refused to rehear the SEC's arguments and now
it's up to the solicitor general to decide if the dispute should be
brought before the U.S. Supreme Court for a possible hearing.
   ``We would defend our exclusive jurisdiction, at the same time
it doesn't mean we're against innovative products,'' a CFTC
spokesman said in a telephone interview.
   ``We'd like to see some alternative worked out without
litigation. There are a lot of ramifications that have to be
carefully considered,'' said the spokesman, who asked not to be
named.

<HEAD>Restaurant Should Weather Jefferson Avenue Closing Just Fine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bob Coleman figures his Wendy's restaurant, next
to Chrysler Corp.'s Jefferson Avenue assembly plant, will weather
the factory's closing Friday.
   He, like some of the 1,700 workers who will be laid off when
Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon production stops, has been through
factory shutdowns before.
   ``It closed down for a couple of weeks before,'' Coleman said of
the plant on Detroit's east side. ``It won't make too much of a
difference.''
   The Jefferson Avenue plant, one of the industry's oldest,
eventually will be demolished, and part of the land under it will
be incorporated into the Jefferson North plant, now being built
next to the old plant.
   Many of the laid off employees will be offered jobs at the
Jefferson North plant in a year and a half or so, when training
begins for workers who will begin production of a new sport-utility
vehicle in late 1992.
   And while the Jefferson North plant will offer some money for
the workers in late 1991, it's providing income for Coleman and his
employees now.
   ``We have the construction workers,'' the restaurant manager
said.
   When the Jefferson Avenue plant officially closes with the end
of its only shift Friday afternoon, no one is going to look back,
get a little misty-eyed and turn off the light.
   Hundreds of workers will show up Monday and beyond, cleaning up,
salvaging some equipment and getting the buildings ready for
razing. The United Auto Workers union, nonetheless, says it was
betrayed by Chrysler.
   A hand-painted sign taped on the door to UAW Local 7, across the
street from the Jefferson North construction site, takes a swipe at
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca: ``Lido said: Trust me. He lied _ UAW
Local 7.''
   Just over a year ago, Chrysler closed its Kenosha, Wis.,
assembly plant and put 5,500 workers on layoff with no new factory
to employ them. It was a move union, state and local officials
decried, saying Chrysler, and Iacocca specifically, had promised
that the plant would stay open longer.
   The Kenosha plant was closed when Chrysler moved Omni-Horizon
production to Jefferson Avenue. Now, the company says it can't sell
enough of the small cars to keep the Detroit plant open.
   On Thursday, Chrysler announced it would close its St. Louis car
plant Sept. 21, seven months after it cuts production there in
half. The company will lay off 3,700 workers in all.
   The UAW has contested the Jefferson Avenue plant closing, saying
the company could have done a better job of marketing or
redesigning the cars to boost sales.
   For months, workers at the Jefferson Avenue plant have walked to
and from their jobs past a moonscape of barren land slowly being
transformed into the Jefferson North plant.
   For some workers, like Walt Harris of Detoit, Jefferson North is
the future. During the time he's laid off and the time he hopes to
report for retraining, he plans to take law classes at Wayne State
University in Detroit.
   ``Then, hopefully, I'll be back at Jefferson North,'' said
Harris, who has worked for Chrysler for 23 years.
   Closing an assembly plant is like an H-bomb in an automaker's
arsenal as it fights to hold profits in a fickle industry. With
demand for new cars slipping and competition from U.S.-built
Japanese models growing, it's a tactic American companies have
resorted to increasingly.
   Since 1987, U.S. automakers have shut down 13 assembly plants,
laying off tens of thousands of workers in assembly and component
plants.
   Laid off union workers can qualify for a variety of benefits
designed to get them up to 95 percent of their take-home pay before
overtime. But some workers, like Local 7 member Eddie Jordan, a
veteran at Jefferson Avenue, doubt whether the benefit funds have
enough money to maintain that level as more workers draw from it.
   Still, he said the Jefferson Avenue closing is different than
the others because of the job possibilities offered by Jefferson
North.
   The Jefferson Avenue plant began making cars in 1907 and the
first vehicle bearing a Chrysler nameplate rolled off the assembly
line 17 years later. Nearly 9 million cars and trucks have been
built at the plant.
   Chrysler spokesman Doug Nicoll said the company will keep the 41
acres north of Jefferson Avenue and incorporate them into Jefferson
North. The future of another 104 acres south of the original
complex is undecided.
   Chrysler plans other cutbacks in its drive to trim $1 billion
from its $26 billion budget by 1991.
   Beginning Feb. 12, the nation's No. 3 automaker will cut one
shift from its St. Louis car plant, putting 1,900 people on
indefinite layoff. The company also is indefinitely laying off
hundreds of workers as part of other production cutbacks nationwide.
   Some analysts have predicted the St. Louis factory and some
Canadian plants may have to close entirely or be consolidated to
cut costs.
   The cuts aren't unique to Chrysler.
   General Motors Corp. in mid-March will shut its Lakewood
assembly plant in Atlanta, putting 2,500 workers on indefinite
layoff. The nation's largest automaker also is cutting a shift each
from its Doraville, Ga., and Linden, N.J., assembly plants.
   About 15,400 workers will lose or have lost their jobs at 11 GM
or Chrysler assembly plants because of indefinite layoffs between
January and September.

   American Health Partners has been unable to
satisfy the conditions set for the sale of its American Health
magazine to Reader's Digest Association Inc., a spokesman for
Reader's Digest said Thursday.
   But the seller told Reader's Digest it expects to meet the
conditions shortly, and the contract has not been termninated,
Reader's Digest spokesman Bruce Trachtenberg said.
   Reader's Digest, a privately held publishing company based in
Pleasantville, N.Y., announced earlier this month that it had
agreed to pay $29.1 million for the health and fitness magazine,
provided that certain unspecified conditions were met by Jan. 31.
   Trachtenberg said no new deadline for completion of the deal was
set after Wednesday's deadline passed, and said his company had
made no commitment on how long it would wait. He declined to
disclose what conditions were not met.
   ``We will be monitoring developments closely,'' he said.
   A call placed after business hours to American Health Partners
went unanswered. The New York-based partnership owns and operates
several other magazines, including Psychology Today and Mother
Earth News.

   When John J. Phelan Jr. was 16 years old, he
spent a summer working for his father's firm as a ``runner'' on the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange. He hated it.
   ``I thought it was just a frightful place to be,'' he said.
   As he grew older, Phelan changed his mind about the NYSE,
working as a ``specialist'' on the crowded floor managing the
trading activity and rising through the executive ranks to become
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Phelan announced Thursday he would retire at the end of 1990
after nearly seven years as chairman of the nation's largest stock
exchange.
   He guided the exchange through a period of explosive growth,
championed new sophisticated technology and introduced
controversial safeguards following the 1987 market crash and a
near-repeat performance in 1989.
   Securities industry officials said they were not entirely
surprised by Phelan's announcement and praised his tenure.
   ``I think he's been marvelous,'' said Alan C. ``Ace'' Greenberg,
chairman of the investment firm Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. ``He came from
the floor. He was a specialist. He understands the business. It
helped.''
   ``We've seen everything from electronic trading pressures to the
market crash to new products and innovations to congressional
pressure,'' added Wall Street veteran Jack Barbanel, president of
First Global Asset Management Inc. ``I think he has done a very
superb job addressing most of the issues.''
   Speaking candidly in his unabashed New York accent, Phelan
tackled difficult issues quickly and publicly _ including the 1987
crash, computerized program trading and competition from other
foreign and domestic markets.
   After the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 508 points on
Oct. 19, 1987 in a disaster compared to the Great Crash of 1929,
Phelan pulled no punches, calling it what it was _ ``the worst
market I have ever seen in my lifetime or would hope to see again.''
   Phelan, 58, also has come under intense congressional pressure
to reform the stock market and criticism from some fronts that the
exchange has not adapted to a competitive threat from fully
automated markets that can trade all day and night.
   He always has had an answer, and it usually has been without
rancor or apologies.
   ``He has been a calm and steadying influence as he steered the
markets through both good and bad times,'' said Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass, who has pressured for market reform since the
crash, often at odds with the exchange.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Chairman William A. Schreyer, the NYSE's
vice chairman, said: ``John Phelan will be best remembered for the
strong, steady leadership he has provided for the entire securities
industry during one of the most turbulent periods in its history.
   ``He has been a voice of reason, calm and integrity, not only
guiding the NYSE's member comunity but providing a broader public
service by reassuring the investing public as well.''

   The private Institute for Injury Reduction
said Thursday that rear-seat lap belts, when unaccompanied by
shoulder belts, cause more than 1,000 serious injuries a year.
   The organization, founded by a group of lawyers who specialize
in representing accident victims, urged a campaign by government
and industry to equip millions of autos with back-seat shoulder
belts.
   Benjamin Kelley, the institute's president, said that many
victims of serious lap belt injuries are children because they tend
to be in the rear seats of automobiles when crashes occur.
   The administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, Jerry Ralph Curry, said his agency is already
urging auto manufacturers and car dealers to prepare to retrofit
older cars with rear-seat shoulder straps.
   Under a rule adopted last year by the agency, new cars must be
equipped with rear-seat shoulder belts.
   Curry said he was concerned that the safety institute's report
may cause parents not to strap their children in while driving.
When properly adjusted, seatbelts save lives, he said.
   Kelley noted that last year's regulation does not apply to 140
million older cars on the road.
   ``Neither government nor the car industry are vigorously acting
to see that existing cars are rapidly equipped with safe, effective
rear-seat lap-shoulder belts,'' Kelley said.
   ``The harmful consequences of such indifference are summed up in
the injury cases we have learned about to date,'' Kelley said.
``The majority of the victims are children. The most common fatal
injuries are head injuries and internal bleeding.''
   ``Non-fatal, permanently disabling injuries are most often
spinal cord damage resulting in permanent paraplegia and massive
trauma to the abdominal organs,'' he said.
   Kelley said that in a typical crash other passengers in the car,
even those not wearing seat belts, tend to be less severely injured
than a person seated in the rear and wearing a lap belt.
   Kelley called on manufacturers, safety groups and the highway
safety administration to launch an advertising campaign ``to ensure
that all motorists know the hazards of rear-seat lap-only belts,
especially to children'' and the benefits of installing shoulder
belts.
   At a separate news conference, Curry said that while he is
delighted that Kelley's institute is focusing on rear-seat
accidents, they are ``small potatoes'' compared to the 340,000
annual accidents involving front-seat passengers, especially those
not wearing seat belts.
   He advised parents concerned about the issue to obtain a good
child safety seat and keep their child buckled up.
   If the child no longer fits the seat, put in a booster seat, he
said.
   If that no longer fits, place the child in the front passenger
seat with the shoulder strap fastened, he said.

   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said Thursday it
downgraded its rating on $400 million of Texas Air Corp. senior
debt because of heavy losses at Texas Air's subsidiary Eastern
Airlines and a new reorganization plan proposed by Eastern.
   The credit rating agency said the $400 million in Texas Air
senior debt remained on its surveillance list with negative
implications.
   Art Kent, a spokesman for Texas Air at its headquarters in
Houston, said the company had no immediate comment on Standard &amp;
Poor's action.
   On Tuesday, a committee of Eastern's preferred shareholders
suggested the liquidation or outright sale of the Miami-based
airline, which has been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization
since last March.
   In papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, the committee said it
had lost faith in Eastern's management because it was
``cannibalizing'' the airline by selling vital assets.
   The preferred shareholders criticized Eastern's latest
reorganization plan, unveiled late last week, which proposes to pay
them no more than 10 cents on the dollar in the form of new stock.
   The new plan also calls for paying unsecured creditors only 10
percent of their debts in cash when the airline emerges from
bankruptcy protection, and another 70 percent over the following 10
years, without interest.
   In return for accepting partial repayment, Texas Air would give
the unsecured creditors 40 percent of Eastern's equity.
   Under Eastern's two previous plans, unsecured creditors _
primarily trade suppliers such as aircraft manufacturers _ were to
be repaid in full with interest at the completion of Chapter 11.
   Eastern's ``heavy losses and revised reorganization proposal,
which foresees a reduced cash payout to unsecured creditors, will
result in additional demands on Texas Air's resources and severely
constrain financial flexibility,'' Standard &amp; Poor's said in a
statement.
   ``The parent company is already paying interest and dividends on
some Eastern secured debt and preferred stock, and funded part of
Eastern's September pension payment.''
   The rating agency stressed that Texas Air's cash reserves should
prevent any liquidity crisis and that Continental Airlines, its
other major subsidiary, is recovering from earlier financial
problems.
   However, Standard &amp; Poor's said, ``credit strength is damaged by
Eastern's continuing difficulties.''
   The statement also referred to reported remarks Tuesday by Texas
Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo that a merger of Eastern and Continental
is a possibility.
   ``While a combination has long-term potential, it would risk
reversing the substantial progress made at Continental,'' the
agency said.
   Texas Air, in a statement issued late Thursday, said it has
studied the merger option but ``no consolidation of Eastern and
Continental is currently being planned, or being proposed by Texas
Air to Eastern's creditors.''
   In a related development Wednesday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton
R. Lifland approved Eastern's request for $50 million to be taken
out of escrow to help fund its operations through February.
   Also on Wednesday, Eastern's management issued a memo to its
employees dismissing the preferred shareholders' criticisms and
persistent rumors of a possible Chapter 7 liquidation.

<HEAD>Centel Agrees to Pay $1 Million to Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centel Cellular Telephone Co. has agreed to
pay $1 million to the government over a 1989 accident in which two
people died when their helicopter crashed into a radio tower under
construction in North Carolina, a Federal Communications Commission
official said Thursday.
   Chicago-based Centel, which is not admitting any liability in
the accident, also will conduct a 2-year educational safety
awareness campaign within the cellular industry on antenna marking
and lighting as part of an FCC-approved consent decree, said Greg
Vogt, chief of the commission's mobile services division.
   The consent decree resolves an FCC complaint that Centel
allegedly had failed to comply with FCC requirements for tower
marking and lighting.
   The consent decree stemmed from a 1989 collision of a Medivac
helicopter with a tower at Coinjock, N.C., that was owned by a
Centel subsidiary, the commission said. Two people in the
helicopter were killed.
   Following an investigation of that accident and another 1989
incident involving a Centel tower in Portsmouth, Va., the FCC's
field operations bureau cited Centel for possibly violating FCC
rules.
   Vogt said the consent decree, which was issued Tuesday,
``resolves any pending sanctions that we might impose on Centel for
the violation of our rules.''
   However, Centel will have to pay $1 million within five days and
``conduct an education campaign within the industry to make sure
other licensees know their obligations to light towers during
construction,'' Vogt said.
   ``There has been some concern at the commission that licensees
haven't been diligent enough to make sure their lights are on and
working,'' both during construction and afterwards, he said.
   Two civil suits claiming wrongful deaths also were filed in the
North Carolina case, Vogt said.

<HEAD>First Interstate Reveals SEC Probe Connected to Huge Texas Losses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission is
conducting an inquiry into a $400 million charge that First
Interstate Bancorp reported Dec. 7 for loan losses, mostly at its
Texas subsidiary, the bank has disclosed.
   First Interstate said SEC staffers made an ``informal inquiry''
last month, requesting and receiving documents from the bank
holding company, the nation's 10th largest.
   The $400 million writedown against fourth-quarter profits
followed a similar $350 million charge the bank took in the third
quarter for losses at its Arizona bank.
   Last week, First Interstate reported a fourth-quarter loss of
$344.3 million because of problems at the Texas bank, the former
Allied Bancshares, which First Interstate acquired in early 1988.
   First Interstate revealed the SEC inquiry in a filing related to
its plan to issue 7.5 million new shares of stock to bolster its
capital, which was depleted by the writedown.
   The Wall Street Journal said the inquiry likely was aimed at
exploring whether First Interstate had violated disclosure laws by
not reporting its Texas problems more promptly.
   The Journal also reported that federal regulators have placed
First Interstate's Arizona unit under strict supervisory controls,
and that First Interstate may need regulatory approval to continue
paying its 75 cent quarterly dividend.
   The bank's filing also contained a warning that the big losses
may not be over.
   ``As a consequence of general economic conditions in the
operating regions of the corporation's subsidiary banks,
particularly the Southwest United States, however, there can be no
assurance that further substantial additions to the corporation's
allowance for loan losses will not be required,'' the filing said.
   First Interstate is the nation's 10th largest bank holding
company with $58 billion in assets. The bank has been trying to cut
costs through layoffs and selling businesses outside of its core
consumer and business banking divisions because of the Arizona and
Texas losses.
   The bank's problems also led to an announcement last month that
longtime Chairman and Chief Executive Joseph J. Pinola would be
succeeded as operating head of the company by President Edward
Carson on June 1.
   In his 12 years as First Interstate's chief, Pinola pursued an
agressive expansion policy that backfired in the southwestern
banking losses.

   Two of the largest privately held
tobacco dealers in the country have reached an agreement to merge
and form a holding company, officials said.
   The announcement was made jointly on Wednesday by Austin Co.
Inc., which is based in Greeneville, and A.C. Monk &amp; Co. Inc. of
Farmville, N.C.
   A name for the new company has not yet been selected, according
to Sam J. Calvert Jr., the chairman of Austin.
   Monk shareholders would own a majority of the stock of the
holding company and have a majority representation on the board of
directors, company officials said.
   Both companies will maintain separate operations.
   Calvert said the new company would be the fourth-largest tobacco
dealer in the world in total sales. Both Austin and Monk sell only
leaf tobacco.
   Officials for both companies on Thursday declined to give any
information on annual sales.
   Clyde Austin III, the vice chairman of Austin, said Thursday
that the two companies jointly own Mashonaland Tobacco Co. of
Zimbabwe.

<HEAD>SmithKline Cuts Dyazide Price By 11 Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SmithKline Beecham Thursday cut the price of
its popular high blood pressure drug Dyazide by 11 percent, one day
after its sole generic competitor removed its version of the drug
from the market.
   The pharmaceutical giant said the move was in response to a
request by U.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House
Energy and Commerce investigations subcommittee, who feared some
patients wouldn't be able to afford the brand-name drug.
   SmithKline's move, effective Saturday, will lower the price from
about 36 cents a capsule to an estimated 32 cents, company
spokesman Jeremy Heymsfeld said.
   Bolar Pharmaceutical Co. Inc.'s generic version had cost about
25 cents a capsule, he said. A typical patient takes one capsule a
day.
   Bolar recalled their capsules Wednesday following disclosures
that the company allegedly gave false test data to the Food and
Drug Administration for its version of Dyazide.
   ``It is a welcome gesture in the direction of price equity,''
Dingell said in a statement responding to the price cut. Dingell
had said Wednesday that if SmithKline did not cut the price, the
FDA should consider requiring SmithKline to reformulate the drug so
it would be easier to copy.
   Frederick Kyle, president of SmithKline Beecham
Pharaceutical-U.S., said the decision to cut the price took into
consideration the needs of stockholders, employees and patients.
   ``We recognize that for some patients the unavailability of a
generic version will represent an increase in their health care
expenditures. To help minimize the impact, we are decreasing the
price of Dyazide,'' Kyle said.
   In 1988, the first full year of generic competition for Dyazide,
sales in this country were $153 million, a 52 percent drop from
1987.
   The FDA said patients taking Bolar's generic drug should
continue taking the drug until their prescription runs out and
arrange with their physicians to take another medication.
   Last spring, Vitarine Pharmaceuticals of Springfield Gardens,
N.Y., took its version of Dyazide off the market after it admitted
cheating on FDA tests.

<HEAD>Company Reports Smaller Loss; Financing Arranged for LIN
Broadcasting Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McCaw Cellular Communications Inc., the
nation's largest cellular telephone company, said it reduced its
losses in the fourth quarter of 1989 and boosted revenues by 67
percent.
   McCaw also announced Thursday it has completed negotiations with
its agent banks on a credit agreement to finance its tender offer
for 21.9 million shares of LIN Broadcasting of New York.
   The $3.38 billion deal will give McCaw control of LIN, a major
step in the company's drive to serve the nation's largest
population centers.
   McCaw also said it expects to close in February the pending sale
of its south-central cellular systems to Contel Cellular Inc. for
approximately $1.3 billion.
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, McCaw lost $58.4 million or 36
cents a share on revenues of $152.2 million, compared with a loss
of $92.2 million or 70 cents a share on revenues of $91.3 million a
year earlier.
   For the year, McCaw lost $288.5 million or $1.95 a share on
revenues of $504.1 million, compared with a loss of $297 million or
$2.39 a share on revenues of $310.8 million in 1988.
   ``Our growth in revenues, cash flow and subscribers continues to
meet or exceed our expectations,'' said Craig McCaw, chairman and
chief executive officer.
   Cash flow, representing income from operations before
depreciation and amortization, rose to $19.1 million in the latest
quarter from $500,000 a year earlier.
   McCaw Cellular has been developing major regional systems that
are important to the creation of a national cellular network. The
deals with LIN and Contel will give McCaw and LIN a strong
concentration in California, Texas, Florida, New York and
Pennsylvania, McCaw said.
   McCaw credited the improved fourth-quarter performance to
reduced losses from operations, gains on sales of securities and
some cellular interests, and a significant rise in interest income
from the money received from British Telecom's purchase of a 20
percent interest in McCaw Cellular.
   The number of cellular subscribers in its markets, as well as
markets where it has the right to buy a controlling interest, rose
68 percent to 434,000 at year-nd from 258,000 at the end of 1988.

<HEAD>Paramount Signs Producers Simpson, Bruckheimer to 5-year Deal</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 12:01 a.m. Thursday PST, Time set by source.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Entertainment Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, the
producers of ``Top Gun'' and ``Beverly Hills Cop,'' signed an
exclusive five-year deal with Paramount Pictures to make at least
five films, the studio announced.
   The terms of the partnership were not disclosed. But the
arrangement is likely to make Simpson and Bruckheimer, the most
successful movie producers in Hollywood in the `80s, also the most
highly compensated.
   Furthermore, the pair will enjoy the independence to make any
movie, any way they want.
   ``They (Paramount) put up the money. We put up the talent. We
meet at the theater,'' Simpson said Wednesday.
   In recent years, the producing duo have made some of the
biggest-grossing films in movie history.
   Their box-office hits include 1983's ``Flashdance'' ($209
million worldwide box-office gross), 1984's ``Beverly Hills Cop''
($312 million), 1986's ``Top Gun'' ($351 million) and 1987's
``Beverly Hills Cop II'' ($281 million).
   Their only flop was 1984's ``Thief of Hearts.'' The two have
produced films for Paramount for the last seven years.
   The deal was struck after months of negotiations with Paramount
and other studios. Simpson and Bruckheimer said they also
considered taking their production company public, but declined to
do so because they wanted to be hands-on producers.
   ``We ended up with what we were after from the beginning _
freedom,'' Simpson said. Said Bruckheimer: ``We have the right to
make a certain number of pictures under certain limits, but very
broad limits.''
   Unlike most producers under contract to a studio, Simpson and
Bruckheimer will develop and make motion pictures without the
advice and consent of Paramount executives.
   Paramount will provide financing in the range of $20 million per
film and then market and distribute the finished products.
   ``We're not compelled to do anything,'' Simpson said. ``We're
not serving management's needs. ... We don't have any bosses.''
   Paramount will continue to negotiate contracts for the
producers, and Simpson and Bruckheimer do not expect to have to
hire additional personnel.
   While neither Paramount nor Simpson and Bruckheimer revealed the
terms of the deal, it is almost certain that the pair will collect
a substantial share of their films' profits. On top of that, they
will earn a producer's fee for the films they make. To make big
money, though, they have to make popular movies.
   The two also will be allowed to direct movies, and plan to
co-direct their next project.
   Directing, Bruckheimer said, ``is another horizon to tackle.
It's always been important to conquer new goals. And it's more
control over the creative process.''
   The pair said they have no aspirations to run a studio, as
producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber did last year when they exited
Warner Bros. to assume management of Columbia Pictures.
   The Simpson-Bruckheimer production company, located on the
Paramount lot, is now filming the auto racing movie ``Days of
Thunder,'' starring Tom Cruise, Robert Duvall, Nicole Kidman and
Randy Quaid. Simpson himself will play an Italian race-car driver
in the movie. It is directed by ``Top Gun's'' Tony Scott.
   Before joining with Bruckheimer to produce ``Flashdance,''
Simpson was Paramount's president of worldwide production for two
years. Bruckheimer, as an independent producer, has worked on
``American Gigolo,'' the remake of ``Cat People'' and ``Thief.''
