<HEAD>Amnesty Says Political Opponents Tortured, Detained in Egypt</HEAD>

   Amnesty International said Wednesday it was
concerned about reports that thousands of political detainees were
held without charge in Egyptian prisons and were often tortured.
   The human rights organization said 8,000 opponents of President
Hosni Mubarak's government were reportedly detained in 1989 and
detentions, although fewer, were continuing this year.
   ``Anyone can effectively be held for months without charge or
trial if the Interior Ministry says they are a `threat to national
security','' Amnesty reported from its headquarters in London.
   Ali Rahmy, press counselor at the Egyptian Embassy in London,
called the report ``completely false.''
   Amnesty attacked emergency laws that let the government hold
people without trial or charge, for many months or even years
   In some cases, family members were rounded up to force them to
divulge a wanted person's whereabouts, it said.
   Amnesty expressed concern that some hearings took place this
year without detainees being in court, making it impossible for the
court to know of any complaints of torture or ill-treatment.
   Egypt signed the 1986 United Nations Convention against Torture
and so must investigate such complaints of torture, but Amnesty
said it failed to do so.
   ``The evidence of torture in Egypt has been increasing and yet
there has so far been little sign of a response from the Egyptian
authorities to indicate an official resolve to tackle or eradicate
the problem,'' Amnesty said.
   ``More systematic torture including use of electric shocks to
the genitals and other sensitive parts of the body, and suspension
by the wrists from barred windows, or from doors, has been reported
in dozens of cases, including many from 1989.''
   Among cases of political prisoners it says were tortured in
detention, Amnesty cited Ali As-Sayyed Batikh, a surgeon arrested
on Sept. 23, 1989.
   ``Ali Batikh was himself beaten, and threatened with electricity
and sexual attacks while being asked questions about his alleged
activities for the Moslem Brotherhood in the Giza area,'' the
organization said.
   The Brotherhood is a banned organization of Islamic
fundamentalists. It was the fundamentalists who assassinated
President Anwar Sadat in October 1981.
   Amnesty said ``most victims have been members and sympathizers
of Islamic groups.''
   Of Egypt's 49 million people, 90 percent are Moslem. The rest of
the population is mostly Coptic Orthodox Christian.
   The rights group said it presented its findings to Egypt in
February, and talked with government officials last May, but got no
response to its requests for comment.
   Amnesty said the newly appointed interior minister and the
prosecutor general assured Amnesty specific cases would be
investigated, but the organization received no information
investigations took place.

   The third game of the world chess showdown was
adjourned Monday night after five hours, with neither world
champion Garry Kasparov or challenger Anatoly Karpov clearly in
control.
   The first game was a draw and Kasparov won the second game.
   Play was halted just after 10:30 p.m. when Kasparov wrote down
his 41st move and sealed it in an envelope. The game was set to
resume Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. when the match arbiter will open the
envelope.
   Spectators said the players were in an unclear position.
   ``There are chances for both sides and I predict a draw,'' said
Dmitri Gurevich, a grand master from Chicago.
   ``I think the position is better for black (Kasparov), but white
(Karpov) has good chances of surviving and getting a draw,'' said
international master Vitaly Zaltsman of Brooklyn.
   In the adjourned position, white has a king, rook, bishop,
knight and four pawns. Black has a king, two bishops, a knight and
five pawns.
   ``The adjourned position is a complete mess. Nobody knows what's
happening,'' said Joel Benjamin, a grand master from Manhattan.
   Kasparov, 27, the highest-rated player in the history of chess,
leads 1{ points to { points in the 24-game title match against
Karpov, 39, the former world champion he unseated in 1985.
   Karpov played with the white pieces in Game 3, which originally
was to be played Friday. Observers said they weren't surprised when
Karpov - an introverted, methodical, player - postponed it until
Monday: confidence is an important factor in this game of
psychological warfare.
   The arch-rivals have played more than 120 games with each other.
The majority of them, like Game 1 of this match, were draws.
Kasparov dominated Game 2 thoroughly.
   In the third game, Kasparov, playing the black pieces, repeated
his choice of opening from the first game - the King's Indian
Defense. But Karpov, with his fifth and sixth moves, adopted a
different system, known as the Classical Variation.
   Karpov used 1{ hours to play his first 15 moves. Kasparov used
21 minutes for his first 14 moves, then thought 41 minutes about
move 15 - a quiet knight retreat.
   Karpov then decided to accept Kasparov's offer of the queen.
   But Kasparov's 23rd move trapped Karpov's queen, and forced an
endgame in which Karpov had an extra rook but Kasparov had an extra
bishop and two pawns that appeared very dangerous.
   Former Soviet dissident Nathan Sharansky, who is regarded as a
strong amateur player, was in the press room analyzing the third
game.

<HEAD>Botulism Toxin Reduces Disabling Tremors, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Injections of the powerful toxin that causes
botulism eased disabling tremors that failed to respond to standard
drugs, researchers report.
   When injected into the muscles causing head or hand tremors, the
food poisoning toxin caused improvements for an average of three
months. Patients generally responded equally well to follow-up
treatment, a researcher said.
   Two-thirds of 51 patients showed improvement that helped them
feed themselves, improved their handwriting and reduced their
embarrassment in public, aaid Dr. Joseph Jankovic. Hand tremors
were eliminated in seven cases, he said.
   Jankovic, a neurology professor at the Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston and director of is Parkinson's Disease Center
and Movement Disorders Clinic, did the study with colleague Kenneth
Schwartz. He reported the results Monday at the annual meeting of
the American Neurological Association in Atlanta.
   The toxin, called botulinum toxin, is produced by bacteria and
is the most potent nerve-targeting poison known. When swallowed
with food, it causes life-threatening botulism.
   The toxin blocks messages from nerves to muscles, so researchers
use it to paralyze or weaken selected muscles. The effect wears off
because the toxin dissipates.
   Treated patients do not get botulism because the toxin
concentrates in the muscle sites where it is injected, and only
small amounts are used.
   Botulinum toxin was approved by federal regulators in December
for treating strabismus, in which eyes are crossed or otherwise
misaligned, and blepharospasm, which forces the eyelids to close.
Scientists say it can also treat spasmodic torticollis, a neck
muscle disorder that turns or tilts the head; a form of spasmodic
dysphonia, in which the vocal cords close too tightly, and some
other conditions.
   The new study ``looks like very, very promising research,'' said
botulinum toxin expert Dr. Mitchell Brin, assistant professor of
clinical neurology at the Columbia University College of Physicians
and Surgeons in New York.
   Schwartz said thousands of people might eventually be helped by
the treatment.
   Tremors can be caused by a variety of conditions. Jankovic
stressed that they are not a normal part of aging. ``Tremor at any
age, from infancy to 120 years of age, is always abnormal,'' he
said.
   The new work focused on people with tremors severe enough to
interfere with their jobs and everyday tasks or cause unacceptable
embarrassment.
   Each treatment involved three to five injections into the
affected muscle. Forty-two patients received injections to the neck
for head tremors and 10 were treated in the forearm for hand
tremors. One patient received injections in both sites.
   On average, the toxin took effect about a week later and
produced improvement for an average of 12{ weeks.
   There were a few relatively mild side effects that lasted up to
about three weeks.
   Twelve patients who received neck injections reported difficulty
swallowing, four patients had neck weakness and six patients
treated for hand tremor reported hand weakness, Jankovic said.
Still, almost all patients said they would rather have the
temporary weakness than the tremor, he said.
   Brin said the rate of side effects appeared to be high but that
it was probably related to dosages used rather than an inherent
drawback of toxin treatment. Jankovic and Schwartz said the side
effects should decrease as researchers learn more about dosages and
injection sites.
   Jankovic said an average treatment might cost about $500 to
$1,200.

   The U.S. budget crisis, which has big economic
implications on this side of the Atlantic, is causing some concern
among European commentators.
   ``Sometimes laughable, often deplorable'' is how the French
newspaper Le Monde viewed the U.S. budgetary process.
   The $250 billion deficit pushes up worldwide interest rates,
consumes capital and has undermined confidence in the dollar,
economists say.
   In a front page editorial, the moderate Le Monde criticized
``the disparity between (the deficit's) global stakes and the
shopkeepers' haggling'' in Washington.
   A commentary in the Netherlands' largest daily, the conservative
De Telegraaf, compared the United States to an ancient empire in
collapse.
   ``The Greeks couldn't hold out; the Romans couldn't keep their
heads above water; the United States is already degenerating
nicely,'' it said.
   European government officials have said little publicly about
the issue. European monetary union and German unification have been
more pressing political topics.
   Europe's budget-making process generally is a more orderly and
low-key affair than in the United States. Britain boasted a $15.6
billion budget surplus last year.
   For years, the United States' trading partners have been
pressuring the world's richest nation to cut its deficit because it
pushes U.S. interest rates higher, which in turn pushes up
international interest rates.
   Higher interest rates slow economic growth.
   The impasse could hamper the U.S. Federal Reserve Board's
ability to lower interest rates, which would increase chances of a
recession in the United States next year, analysts say. That could
hurt foreign economies because many are dependent on U.S. demand.
   The United States continues to finance a big portion of its
deficit with foreign capital at a time when world demand for
capital has been increased by German unification and the rebuilding
of Eastern Europe, analysts say. That also puts upward pressure on
interest rates.
   The impasse has created uncertainty, which the financial markets
hate, and has undermined confidence in the dollar, which has fallen
sharply in recent weeks.
   Stronger European currencies can hurt European exports by making
them more expensive.
   The Czechoslovak state press agency CTK has warned that
Czechoslovakia's effort to win status as a favored trading nation
in Washington could be a ``victim'' of the budget crisis.
   If Congress fails to approve a plan before midnight Friday, the
federal government might shut down for a second time this month.
   When Congress refused to pass the first deficit plan for the
fiscal year that began Oct. 1, President Bush closed the government
for the three-day Columbus Day weekend.
   Tourists being turned away from the Statue of Liberty and other
national monuments made a big splash on British and Spanish TV
coverage.
   Some commentators, however, were heartened by a change in U.S.
attitudes toward the deficit.
   Rome's La Repubblica, a liberal newspaper, said, ``The real new
event is that the electors are shrugging off the apathy which has
inserted itself in the past 10 years.''
   ``U.S. voters are losing patience,'' said Germany's left-leaning
Frankfurther Rundschau. If Congess fails, ``the (U.S.
congressional) elections on Nov. 6 will bring many surprises.''
   But the U.S. crisis has led some Europeans to question Bush's
administration and the American political system.
   Geoffrey Dennis, an economist at the London investment firm
James Capel and Co., said: ``It creates great concern about the
leadership of the United States.''
   The leading Spanish daily, the left-of-center El Pais, noted
``serious political problems highlighted by the budget crisis.''
   These include ``a lack of party discipline, the absence of
programs which can attract sufficient support, the president's
vulnerability to political circumstance and the influence of
pressure groups on Congress,'' it said.
   The Economist magazine had some practical suggestions for the
United States. One was that ``congressmen's pay could be linked to
the size of the deficit in the previous year - the bigger the
deficit, the lower their pay.''

<HEAD>Designer of The Year Vivienne Westwood: Innovative, Outrageous</HEAD>

   Britain's fashion industry has finally bestowed
its top accolade on Vivienne Westwood, the innovative and often
outrageous designer who created the punk look for the Sex Pistols
and triggered a worldwide craze.
   After years of being passed over by the fashion establishment,
the 48-year-old woman with the ever-youthful eye was named Designer
of the Year Monday night at a star-studded charity gala at the
Royal Albert Hall.
   The Duchess of Kent presented the award to Ms. Westwood, who
said she was ``very thrilled'' for herself as well as her staff.
``After all this time they had been getting very disillusioned and
this award is an honor for us all.''
   Always controversial and unorthodox, Ms. Westwood said on a
British Broadcasting Corp. radio program earlier in the day that
the news media consistently used three adjectives to describe her
clothes: ``crazy, sexy and unwearable.''
   She maintains her styles are commercial and defends everything
she has created in her career of more than 15 years, though she
acknowledged in an interview in Sky television's magazine this
month that some of her clothing was ``ridiculous'' and verging on
``the porno.''
   Her ``Cut, Slash and Pull'' collection for next spring and
summer unveiled on Saturday featured very demure 40s-style tailored
suits with midi skirts in light grey and dusty pink alongside
shocking bikinis and shorts embellished with bow-tied satin phallic
symbols.
   Ms. Westwood's latest experiment, slashing and ripping thick
denim and fine Lycra into patterns on leggings, shorts and dresses,
sometimes created fascinating designs, but sometimes seemed to
collapse.
   Dubbed the queen of fashion philosophers by The Daily Telegraph,
she told the BBC ``there's always a polemic in my clothes. I try to
fill the role of civilizing human beings, and the first thing they
have to do is question what's done.''
   Ms. Westwood, who described herself in the Sky interview as
anti-Christian and anti-American culture, said she was politicized
by the hippie movement in the late '60s.
   With her partner at the time Malcolm MacLaren, she created punk
as a reaction, incorporating anarchy into fashion, first for punk
rock's Sex Pistols. She also designed for pop stars Boy George and
Bananarama.
   ``I believed at that time youth had the potential to question
the establishment,'' she told the BBC. ``I'm proud of it (punk),
but I don't think it's important any more ... I don't think youth
has that role.''
   While punk made her name, Ms. Westwood has done collections on
many other themes including witches, pirates, paganism,
romanticism, rock 'n' roll and space travel.
   The Designer of the Year award was the top accolade among the
British Fashion Awards, which climaxed three days of catwalk shows
unveiling the British spring and summer collections.
   British designers took the best of the '60s and gave it a modern
'90s look for spring and summer. The key words are short, simple,
sexy and snappy.
   Cropped jackets and shorts are hot favorites. But the big news
is that dresses are back, especially those skimpy shifts loved by
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Audrey Hepburn.
   White is right but so are summer pastels, a little black and
navy, some vivid tropical hues and a smattering of bright prints
like those featured in Milan.
   Other designers receiving British Fashion Council awards Monday
night included Joseph for British Classics, Rifat Ozbek for British
Glamor, Catherine Walker for British Couture, and Joseph Tricot for
British Knitwear.
   Mary Quant, who revolutionized fashion in the '60s with the
miniskirt and has built an international clothes, cosmetics and
accessories empire, was named to the Hall of Fame.

   When six people were hurt in a car wreck a
few years ago, the surgeon on duty at nearby Parkland Medical
Center knew his small emergency room would be overwhelmed by all
the cuts and broken bones.
   So Dr. Paul Harper made a quick decision: Ambulances should
carry the victims to three other hospitals besides Parkland.
Spreading the carnage around meant the injured would get help more
quickly. The doctor felt it was best for patients.
   But in this case, what was best for patients was not necessarily
best for the hospital. Parkland lost business.
   ``I caught it for that,'' Harper recalled. ``The patients were
supposed to come to Parkland, even though they couldn't handle
them. The head nurse told me the administration was mad, and I
shouldn't do that again.''
   Such vignettes are common. Hospitals need patients. Doctors who
send them away for any reason, even for better care, risk rebuke: A
gentle scolding, perhaps. A quiet lecture about hospital economics.
Or worse.
   In Harper's case, what came next was much worse. His career is
in ruins. Once he performed 350 operations a year, the hospital's
busiest surgeon. Now he performs a dozen.
   Harper has filed a lawsuit claiming the hospital engineered a
slander campaign that destroyed his reputation and made doctors
afraid to send him patients. Richard V. Wiebusch, the hospital's
attorney, counters that Harper is in trouble because he is an
incompetent doctor, not because he is a financial liability.
   Such open warfare between doctors and hospitals still is
unusual, but the rules of conduct are changing. Many fear that
blunt coercion is becoming more customary as more hospitals press
doctors to practice a style of medicine that puts the health of the
institution first.
   Usually, hospitals try to keep doctors in line through more
subtle means: Nurses, who lose their jobs when hospital beds stand
empty, cajole doctors to admit more patients. Many hospitals post
names of those who fail to discharge elderly, low-paying Medicare
patients quickly enough. Physicians who don't get the message may
suddenly stop receiving referrals from the emergency room, an
important source of new patients.
   But gentle persuasion can turn harsh. Some doctors complain they
have been dogged by crudely planted rumors of incompetence, that
hospital administrators have ordered other doctors to stop sending
them patients or that their tiniest medical misjudgments are
scrutinized by hospital review committees.
   The worst of these abuses do happen, said Dr. Howard L. Lang of
Kentfield, Calif., chairman of the American Medical Association's
Hospital Medical Staff Section.
   ``It's not a daily occurrence,'' he said, ``but it is occurring
enough that it is not rare. We are not talking about a few whining
malcontents. There are real problems out there.''
   In general, hospitals want their doctors to bring in lots of
patients. They want them to order plenty of X-rays and tests when
the sick are covered by generous private insurance plans. And they
want them to do just the opposite when Medicare picks up the tab.
   Hospitals lose money when the elderly ill linger too long.
Medicare categorizes virtually all old people into DRGs, or
diagnosis-related groups. The DRG classification for a particular
illness pays a single flat fee for the patient, no matter how sick
he is or how long he stays in the hospital.
   ``DRGs encourage the hospitals to keep their costs down, and yet
the physician controls what the hospital bill will be,'' said Dr.
E. Haavi Morreim of the University of Tennessee. ``The hospitals
have had to do something to bring the physicians under the same
incentive. Many hospital administrators have felt the necessity for
some sort of system of carrots and sticks, either formal or
informal.''
   Perhaps the most feared and effective of these sticks is peer
review. This process is the main way doctors watch over the
competence of their hospital colleagues.
   Critics complain the system is sometimes perverted into a way of
punishing those who are economic threats to the hospital or to
other doctors. At its most extreme, doctors lose the right to admit
patients or to perform specific tests, procedures and operations.
   ``There is overwhelming economic motive to eliminate doctors who
cost the hospital money,'' said Dr. Verner S. Waite of Downey,
Calif. ``Doctors who complain about unethical billing practices,
unnecessary tests, using items the hospital can charge for that are
not necessary, are all at great risk of a peer review.''
   Waite has formed an organization to fight abuses of peer review.
He and many others believe that instead of weeding out bad doctors,
the system sometimes may protect dangerous hacks who are
financially and politically powerful because they admit lots of
patients.
   ``When they want to get you, they get you good. They blackball
you,'' said Dr. David M. Freedman. ``They will take away privileges
for nothing, when another doctor can murder someone, and because
he's in good standing they don't bother him.''
   Freedman works with Harper at Parkland Medical Center, an 86-bed
community hospital owned by Hospital Corporation of America, the
nation's largest for-profit hospital chain.
   Freedman believes his own practice has suffered because he
refused an order from a hospital administrator to stop referring
patients to Harper for surgery. Harper claims many other doctors in
this distant suburb of Boston also were warned not to send him
patients, in large part because he went against the hospital's
financial interests.
   Sometimes, a hospital can get rid of someone its considers a
financial nuisance simply by giving another physician the sole
right to perform that doctor's medical specialty.
   Ohio cardiologist Dr. Efraim Montesinos contended he was forced
to move his busy heart surgery practice from Toledo Hospital
because his patients often ran up bigger bills than were covered by
Medicare's flat-fee DRG system, which began in 1984.
   Said Dr. Peter Overstreet, one of Montesinos' supporters:
``Before DRGs, he was a hero. Since DRGs, he is a villain. It's the
same guy.''
   Montesinos said he cared for a large number of very sick
patients. They often took longer than usual to get better, so the
hospital lost money.
   ``I am in the service of my patients,'' he said. ``I am not in
the service of the hospital or the insurance company. As long as I
am a physician, I will do what I think is proper for the patient.''
   Last year, the hospital decided to give an exclusive contract to
a single heart surgery group. Montesinos, who could have bid for
the job, believes the exclusive contract was a ploy ``to get me out
of the hospital.'' He moved his practice to the nearby Medical
College of Ohio.

   Dr. John Gibbs, the hospital's director of medical affairs,
acknowledged finances played a role in the decision to change
surgeons. ``Most of his (Montesinos') patients weren't covered
under the DRGs,'' he said. ``The resource utilization was high -
the amount of (blood) pump time, a lot of X-rays, and the resources
of the hospital.''
   Hospitals now must go to considerable lengths to get rid of
financially rebellious doctors, but some fear it soon will become
much easier.
   Some medical consultants and attorneys suggest rewriting
hospital bylaws to permit ``financial credentialing.'' This would
allow review committees to consider doctors' economic profiles,
including the profitability of their patients, when deciding
whether to allow them to admit patients.
   Others worry doctors will shortchange their patients if they are
forced to put the hospitals' interests first. Said the AMA's Lang:
``When you base medical staff privileges on economic criteria
unrelated to quality, you are setting up a situation where the
patient can be harmed.''

   Dr. Robert Hessler surveys the gridlock of
gurneys cramming the emergency room hallways and makes a troubling
diagnosis: Something is wrong beyond the chest pains, broken limbs
and stomachaches confronting him.
   Each patient has a crisis, and has hurried here only to wait.
The emergency room is an overstretched strand in the health care
safety net, backlogged to the bursting point by overcrowding and
social wounds.
   ``The emergency room is overwhelmed with patients who need to be
administered to,'' says Hessler, assistant director of emergency
services at city-owned Bellevue Hospital. ``We do what we can
minute to minute. We're using every little nook and cranny we can
find to take care of these people.''
   Five patients are going to intensive care; four more to the
heart attack unit. Twenty-one have been patched up and are awaiting
admission to the hospital, including one man with an oxygen tube in
his throat.
   But the traffic doesn't stop with this batch of casualties. A
cluster of arriving emergencies queues up for triage. The worst get
seen first.
   Time passes with neither comfort nor silence in this makeshift
ward. Patients on stretchers stare at the ceiling without so much
as a curtain for privacy.
   Hessler, 38, patrols the area with a stethoscope dangling from
his neck and the pocket of his unbuttoned lab coat bulging with
diagnoses on a notepad. Delays are more than just an inconvenience;
they imperil the delivery of care.
   ``It's not a pleasant way to be sick,'' Hessler said. ``I'm
always afraid that somebody who's seriously ill has to wait longer
than they have to for a physician.''
   An average of 300 people a day pass through the emergency room
at Bellevue.
   President Bush, Mikhail Gorbachev and other dignitaries would be
rushed here if something happened while they were in New York.
Because of its quality care, city cops hurt in the line of duty
prefer 264-year-old Bellevue, the nation's oldest continuously
operating public hospital.
   It also sees the worst wounds of the city: crack addicts, bullet
holes from drug-related assault guns, AIDS patients, the homeless
who have no place else to go for care, teen-agers run over by
subway cars who need their severed limbs reattached, inmates from
city prisons whose manacled ankles protrude from stretchers.
   At Bellevue, battlefield images fit like bandages on a wound.
   ``We're kind of a field hospital. This is war zone medicine. We
see all the casualties,'' Hessler said. ``We see everything here.
We are the window to the world. You will never go anywhere else in
the world and see something we haven't already seen at Bellevue.''
   Drugs are found in two out of three patients who are shot,
stabbed or hit by a car, doctors say. One-fourth of the trauma
cases involve people who have mixed two or more intoxicants,
usually alcohol and cocaine.
   The homeless seek treatment for such ills as frostbite and
rotted feet similar to soldiers who suffered trench foot, a disease
caused by prolonged exposure to wet, cold and inactivity.
   ``It's like a Third World situation,'' Hessler said. ``And when
it's cold, we see body temperatures of 66 degrees. That's almost
the equivalent of hibernation. Their whole body is cold, not just
their feet and hands.''
   The river of patients creates stress and frustration.
   ``A patient doesn't have things people come to expect in a
hospital - a bed, a room, certainly not a TV. If you have to go to
the bathroom, you get a bedpan,'' Hessler said.
   The clamor is a long way from the quiet calm of Hessler's
hometown of Billings, Mont. He spent seven years at the University
of Miami Medical School before doing his residency at New York
University, one of the country's top medical schools.
   Hessler specialized in internal medicine, but opted for
emergency doctoring. It allows him to do a little bit of everything
that interests him: internal medicine, pediatrics,
obstetrics-gynecology, and surgery.
   ``I like to work with critically ill patients. They make you
think and work the hardest you possibly can. You're keeping people
alive,'' Hessler said.
   ``You have to do the right thing in the first few hours for
whatever they have. It puts such a stress on some people that one
of the major problems is physician burnout. Some doctors aren't
able to function with that pressure.''
   Or the daily dose of death. For every rush of adrenalin that
comes with saving a life, there are terrible pendulum swings of
seeing people die.
   ``We're not God. Not everybody can be saved,'' Hessler said.
``But if you die in spite of everything I could possibly have done,
at least I feel we delivered the best possible care and did
everything we could have.''
   He stays, even though there are better-paying jobs with less
heartache.
   ``People asked me why anybody from the NYU training program
would want to do emergency medicine,'' Hessler said. ``We're a
setting of last resort, delivering care to people who don't have
any insurance, don't have any money and don't have any place else
to go. We're here because we want to help people.''
   On call 24 hours a day, Hessler escapes the bedlam of Bellevue
at his suburban home in River Vale, N.J. He eases the tension by
clipping his rhododendrons, junipers and yews.
   ``After a day of wild and chaotic work, I can go home,'' Hessler
said. ``I can trim the bushes, look at my lawn, water the plants,
watch the birds flying around. I'm used to a more calm lifestyle.''
   In addition to sewing up accident victims or treating kids who
swallow rat poison, doctors care for societal ills. A Polaroid
camera is kept to document suspected child abuse. A standard
evidence kit can store specimens from rape victims.
   In one sweep through the room, Hessler bandages a smashed nose,
takes vital signs on a heart patient, scalpels the bureaucratic red
tape so a patient can get X-rays and tries to find out why a
patient is waiting for attention.
   ``You're doing three, four or five things at the same time,''
Hessler said. ``You're working so hard you don't have time to think
about what you'd rather be doing. You're too busy patching people's
lives back together.''
   Splotches of dried blood, bandage wrappings, discarded surgical
gloves, bedpans, surgical tape, syringe cases and other medical
flotsam litter the floor.
   Patients stack their shoes, coats and other possessionson the
bottom of their gurneys as they wait to be released or admitted.
Their medicine is not sugarcoated.
   ``If you come to the emergency room, I can't give you peace and
quiet and comfort,'' Hessler said. ``And for people who aren't
critically ill, I can guarantee you a very long wait.''

   A crush of patients has put city emergency rooms
in critical condition. The average wait is six to eight hours, and
one New York patient languished eight days before being admitted,
surveys show.
   The backlog imperils the quality of care in 41 states and the
District of Columbia, according to a survey last year by the
American College of Emergency Physicians. The Northeast and West
Coast have particularly acute congestion.
   ``It's a cruel illusion to dismiss this as a New York problem.
This is emphatically a nationwide problem,'' said Dr. Arthur
Kellermann, a member of the ACEP study group on overcrowding.
   The only states not reporting backlogs were Idaho, Minnesota,
Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Utah and
Wyoming.
   The nation's 5,700 emergency rooms had an estimated 92 million
visitors last year, according to the American Hospital Association.
There were 80 million visits five years ago. In the past decade,
admissions from emergency room visits have risen 30 percent, the
AHA said.
   The overcrowding crisis stems from a number of reasons: the
surge in drug overdoses and drug-related violence; the AIDS
epidemic; the fact that emergency rooms are a place of last resort
for the homeless and an estimated 37 million Americans who have no
health insurance; a nursing shortage; cutbacks in the number of
hospital rooms; and formulas for federal money that discourage
emergency admissions.
   ``We are on the verge of a major crisis,'' said Dr. Stephan
Lynn, chairman of the ACEP study group and director of emergency
medicine at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City.
   ``The lights never go out. The noise never turns off,'' Lynn
said. ``Some of my patients have no means to pay their bill and
some could buy the hospital, but all of my patients wait. When
there is no bed available, it doesn't really matter how rich you
are.''
   A 1989 survey by the New York state health department showed
that of 2,000 emergency room patients being treated one day, 210
waited eight to 24 hours for care, and 108 waited longer than 24
hours.
   The average wait in an emergency room is six to eight hours,
according to a survey of 300 hospitals in 43 states by the National
Association of Public Hospitals.
   At Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, patients wait
eight to 10 hours - four times longer than they did 10 years ago.
The emergency room is so busy that it turns away arriving
ambulances 20 percent of the time.
   ``That results in ambulances wandering around the city trying to
find emergency departments that are open,'' said Dr. Robert
Hockberger, chairman of emergency medicine at Harbor-UCLA.

<TEXT>
   The host of ``Masterpiece Theater,'' the head of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the former editor of The New
Yorker have something in common with some slum-dwellers - they're
on a rent strike.
   The well-to-do tenants are protesting conditions at their tony
Fifth Avenue apartment building overlooking Central Park on the
Upper East Side.
   The 15-story building, where a doorman stands guard in a
black-and-white marble tiled lobby with brass fixtures, floral
bouquets and tasteful lithographs, does not resemble the apartment
houses in sections of Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx where rent
strikes are common.
   Their plight is not likely to elicit pity from the average New
Yorker. In a city where a studio apartment can easily cost $1,000 a
month, most tenants at 1150 Fifth Ave. pay less than $2,000 a month
for their eight- and nine-room apartments, because their rents are
limited under the city's rent-control regulations.
   They may not live in squalid tenements overrun with drug
dealers, but some residents say they've been forced to live with
leaky roofs, bad plumbing and broken elevators for months.
   ``Everything is ruined,'' said Lucille Turecki, a divorced
mother of two daughters, gesturing to the water-soaked hallway
carpets and peeling ceilings in her six-room apartment. ``I stay
out of here as much as possible.''
   Since March, residents in 45 of the 58 apartments have withheld
rent to force the landlord to improve conditions. City housing
officials say the building has 66 pending code violations.
   Striking tenants include PBS television host Alistair Cooke,
former New Yorker editor William Shawn and museum director Philippe
de Montebello.
   The 96th Street building is being converted into a cooperative
and apartments much like those for which some tenants are now
paying $1,500 a month are on sale for more than $1.6 million, with
monthly maintenance fees of $3,200.
   The building's owner, Arnold Goldstein, said the rent strike is
a typical ploy tenants use during co-op conversions to force owners
to sell them their apartments at lower prices.
   ``They're paying scandalously low rents,'' said Goldstein. ``The
system is wrong if a poor working-class man with a family in the
Bronx pays more per square feet than Alistair Cooke. He and his
wife are two elderly people rambling around nine rooms and a young
working man has to live with his family in three rooms.''
   Cooke, 81, host of ``Masterpiece Theater,'' said part of his
apartment ceiling was damaged because of a leak the owners didn't
repair for months. He said the elevator was broken for eight months
before it was fixed.
   The residents said few of them are very wealthy and could never
afford to buy their apartments.
   ``We're not being greedy,'' Paula Blasband said recently,
sitting in her spacious, white-walled living room with windows
overlooking the park. ``It's been a horrible experience. The people
here are very fine people, they don't like going on a rent strike
and having their names in the paper.''
   Turecki's top-floor apartment is in the worst condition. She has
been in and out of court with the landlords for four years and says
she has spent $38,000 in legal fees. She has lived there since
1972.
   She transformed her dining room into a storage area for clothes
and other items damaged by roof leaks, and moved her dining room
table into the hallway. But the remaining furniture in her living
room always has a sprinkling of plaster dust from the scarred
ceiling overhead.
   Building manager Joe Masino acknowledged Turecki's apartment was
a ``disaster,'' but said most building repairs have been completed.
   He said the Turecki apartment was so badly damaged because it
took a long time and cost a lot to waterproof it.

   The National Enquirer has been tattling about
celebrities for decades, enticing millions of supermarket shoppers
with tantalizing headlines about lustful, jilted or diseased stars.
   Now, inquiring minds are witnessing the tabloid under siege.
   In recent weeks, CBS-TV's ``60 Minutes'' did an expose, Los
Angeles magazine uncovered a sources scandal, and Elizabeth Taylor
and Roseanne Barr have filed lawsuits.
   But National Enquirer Editor Iain Calder said last week the
tabloid's millions of readers - ``largest circulation of any paper
in America'' - needn't worry.
   Readers can expect more juicy headlines on the order of
``Princess Di Pregnant, How She Used Food and Sex Techniques To
Make Sure It's A Girl.''
   ``You won't see any difference in the way we cover stories,''
Calder said from his Lantana, Fla., office. ``It sort of goes with
the territory. Every few years you suddenly get attacked.
   ``After all these stories are run, within a few days, the dust
will settle.''
   The current wave of Enquirer-bashing started with the October
issue of Los Angeles magazine, which said the tabloid paid sources
for stories they had nothing to do with.
   The National Enquirer, with a circulation of 4.1 million,
maintains it scrupulously investigates stories before publication.
   ``Basically, what your lawyers tell you is, `Do you believe it
and have you checked it?''' Calder said.
   Rod Lurie, who wrote the magazine article, said he obtained a
10-page list of Enquirer payments and sources. Many of the sources
insisted they never supplied the information they were credited
with, according to Lurie. Calder said the document was stolen.
   ``One by one by one by one, they all told me the same thing.
They were paid for stories they had nothing to do with, yet, they
were `sources,''' Lurie said.
   One of those sources was Stuart Goldman, a writer charged with
unauthorized entry into a Fox Broadcasting Co. computer in an
unrelated case. He was identified as an investigative reporter in a
``60 Minutes'' piece on the Enquirer.
   ``I received about 12 checks for stories I didn't work on,''
Goldman said. ``When I questioned it, they said, `Don't worry about
it. You were probably shorted on other stories.'''
   The Enquirer maintains its accuracy has been unfairly
questioned.
   ``The phony sources story is ridiculous,'' Calder said. ``If we
wanted to run phony stories using phony sources, we wouldn't pay
the amount of money that we pay for stories that are eventually
killed.
   ``For every 10 soories, nine are killed. More than $850,000 is
paid to free-lancers each year on stories killed.''
   Lurie was amused by Calder's response. ``For Mr. Calder to be
questioning the credibility of my sources is ironic. He's been
paying good money to these sources for a long time.''
   Calder believes he knows why the tabloid is under siege.
   ``There are a group of powerful celebrities that have put
together a war chest and gone to Gavin de Becker to go after us,''
said Calder, who wouldn't name names.
   De Becker, a security consultant whose 120 clients include such
stars as Michael J. Fox, Cher and Miss Barr, was one of 65 people
interviewed by Lurie.
   ``No, there aren't a specific group of clients bent on
destroying the Enquirer,'' said de Becker. ``The idea of 100 major
media figures gathering in a gymnasium ... shouting `Give me the
head of the National Enquirer' is absolutely ridiculous.''
   But Cher attorney John Forbess predicted more legal woes for the
tabloid.
   ``I think celebrities in general are getting more and more fed
up with the outrageous nature of the articles being written,''
Forbess said. ``I think more lawsuits will be filed.
   ``With sources being paid for stories they had nothing to do
with, attorneys will think again about filing a lawsuit.''
   Carol Burnett, whose $1.6 million judgment against the
supermarket tabloid was reduced to $800,000 on appeal, said her
lawsuit apparently didn't have much effect on Enquirer reporting
``because it's still going on.''
   Just last month, Miss Taylor filed a $20 million libel suit
against the National Enquirer. The suit said Miss Taylor was
hospitalized with near-fatal pneumonia when a front-page headline
June 12 screamed: ``Liz Docs Furious. She's Boozing It Up In The
Hospital.''
   And Miss Barr and husband Tom Arnold filed a $35 million federal
racketeering lawsuit earlier this month against the National
Enquirer and Star tabloids, both owned by New York-based Macfadden
Holdings Inc., over the publication of love letters.
   ``The line in the sand has been drawn here, and the Enquirer and
celebrities are going to be doing some battles in the '90s,'' Lurie
said.

   The most sought-after stories by the National
Enquirer generally involve the personal trials and tribulations of
Hollywood's top television stars.
   Michael J. Fox, Vanna White, Roseanne Barr and Oprah Winfrey are
frequent cover material, along with such big-screen entertainers as
Eddie Murphy and Sylvester Stallone.
   But the most enduring National Enquirer personality is Elizabeth
Taylor.
   ``Who's left of the great, great movie stars who have a colorful
life?'' asked Enquirer Editor Iain Calder. ``She has all these
marriages and tragedy in her life. She's probably the most colorful
character of our time.
   ``She's the last of the old-time movie stars.
   ``I hope Liz is around for many decades, but when she goes
there's nobody to replace her.''
   The feeling is not mutual. Miss Taylor last month filed a $20
million libel suit against the Enquirer, claiming the tabloid
falsely labeled her a heavy drinker with a disfiguring disease.
   In recent years, the Enquirer has moved away from movie stars to
television actors. ``In the 1970s, we found television sold more
than movies,'' Calder said.
   The one exception has been Miss Taylor. After the actress filed
suit, the tabloid hit the supermarket checkout lanes a week later
with the cover story: ``Liz back on drugs. Doctors warn: This time
it will kill you!''
   There is no individual dominating National Enquirer attention at
the moment, Calder said.
   ``We've done very well with Dolly Parton, Cher and Vanna,
believe it or not,'' Calder said. ``We've done well on Liz when
we've had a good story, and Oprah.''
   The Lantana, Fla.-based tabloid has a staff of 50 reporters,
plus an untold number of free-lancers and ``a terrific source
network all over the world,'' the editor said.
   Calder said more than 50 percent of the Enquirer's stories are
non-celebrity articles.
   ``We work very hard to come up with upbeat stories. It isn't
just a bunch of negative stories about celebrities,'' he said.
   A recent copy of the tabloid included stories about a man
returning from the dead; a book by presidential first-pooch Millie,
with first lady Barbara Bush serving as ghostwriter; a 101-year-old
groom; and a man who survived a fall from a high-rise.

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Lawsuit by Family of Woman in Abortion-Coma Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINEOLA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Monday dismissed a lawsuit
seeking compensation for a man who fought anti-abortion activists
in court to get an abortion for his comatose wife.
   The suit by Martin Klein of Long Island sought $10 million from
the hospital and two anti-abortion activists.
   Hospital officials demanded he get a judge to appoint him
guardian of his wife, Nancy, before the abortion could be
performed. The activists fought the appointment in court.
   The suit filed in June 1989 by Klein, 37, an accountant, named
as defendants North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset and
anti-abortion activists John Short of Farmingdale and John
Broderick.
   The suit alleged they caused Klein emotional distress and forced
him to pay more than $50,000 in legal fees.
   Doctors had told Klein that an abortion would help his wife
recover. Mrs. Klein emerged from her coma after undergoing an
abortion last year.
   In dismissing the suit, state Justice Harry Hunter said in a
written ruling that the hospital acted properly in refusing to
allow the abortion unless Klein was appointed guardian.
   Hunter ruled that the lawsuit was unjustified and the hospital
was entitled to reimbursement for the money it spent defending
itself. He set a hearing for Nov. 7 to determine the amount.
   Klein's attorney, Jay Dankner, said an appeal was likely if
Klein is penalized at that hearing.
   The judge also found that Short and Broderick's actions ``did
not rise to the level of `extreme and outrageous conduct.''' In
fact, they ``effectively protected Nancy Klein's interests,'' he
wrote.
   Mrs. Klein, who was about four months pregnant, was in a car
accident in December 1988.
   Klein went to court in January seeking guardianship, but
Broderick and Short battled him fiercely, losing each time but
appealing all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court
refused to hear the case.
   Mrs. Klein, 34, eventually emerged from the coma and lives at a
rehabilitation hospital in Oyster Bay, Dankner said. She is able to
communicate and makes frequent trips home to be with her husband
and daughter, he said.

<HEAD>Mexico's First Nuclear Plant Now in Operation</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAGUNA VERDE, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The boxy, brick-red towers of
Mexico's first nuclear power plant jut into the moist tropical air
from a sandy beach flanked by palm-fringed lagoons.
   Not everyone is thrilled about Laguna Verde, a 654-megawatt
plant in southeastern Mexico that started normal operations in
August, 22 years after the project began and 14 years behind
schedule.
   The Federal Energy Commission says Laguna Verde, based on a
General Electric boiling-water reactor, will help power Mexico when
its petroleum begins to run out. Current consumption rates and
proven reserves indicate oil and gas production will continue at
least 53 years.
   Energy Commission spokesman Mario Santoscoy said officials hope
to begin two more nuclear plants by the year 2000.
   Spindly transmission towers march through the lush foliage into
the hills from Laguna Verde, in Veracruz state 190 miles east of
Mexico City, only three miles from where Hernan Cortez landed to
conquer Mexico.
   Many opponents are beginning to feel the campaign against the
plant is futile. Protests began in 1986, after the Chernobyl
nuclear accident in the Soviet Union.
   ``There is no possibility whatever to stop it because the
government proceeds without listening to anybody,'' said novelist
Homero Aridjis, president of the environmentalist Group of 100.
   Protests peaked in 1988, when tens of thousands of demonstrators
repeatedly jammed the streets of Jalapa, capital of Veracruz. The
navy was called in to end a nine-day blockade of the highway
outside Laguna Verde, which means Green Lagoon.
   A military post is still opposite the plant's main gate, but
anti-nuclear fervor has faded with time and frustration.
Demonstrations now are fewer and smaller.
   Most of the plant's foes seem to oppose nuclear power in
general, but many claim Laguna Verde is a badly built example of an
obsolete U.S. design that is poisoning the Veracruz coastline with
radiation.
   Nearly every claim by either side is disputed, and bickering is
more common than discussion.
   ``There are constant emissions of radioactive gases,''
environmentalist Roberto Helier said, quoting sources at the plant.
   Vinicio Serment Cabrero, plant information director, asserted:
``We haven't had discharges of radioactive materials, either liquid
or gas.''
   Critics pass out copies of official lab tests showing high
levels of strontium 90 in shrimp caught nearby. The plant safety
director, Sergio Zorrilla, has other documents citing later tests
with low strontium 90 levels.
   Opponents claim the plant was stopped 41 times during its test
run, including several emergencies. Officials admit to 30 or so,
but insist none was an emergency.
   A recent official study by nine foreign experts found the plant
had released only minute amounts of radiation. Critics accuse the
experts of bias. Helier cited studies showing even small amounts of
radiation can increase risks of cancer.
   Spent fuel from Laguna Verde will remain radioactive for
thousands of years.
   Critics also claim the lengthy test period - four times longer
than scheduled - indicates problems.
   John Ahearn, a member of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
from 1978 to 1983, said a long test ``can either indicate a lot of
problems or it can indicate prudent caution.''
   Former plant manager Augustin Perez Ruiz insisted it was the
latter: ``We did everything with the rigor of a novice. We didn't
want anything to happen.''
   Ahearn said a long test period might help train workers.
   ``The most critical element in nuclear power plants are the
people,'' he said. ``If you're in a country that has never built a
plant before, its going to take them a longer time.''
   According to critics, the plant workers are not well-trained.
``There's always a factor of risk,'' said Aridjis, the novelist,
and ``the most unpredictable of all is a human error.''
   Up the road from Laguna Verde, many people in the town of Palma
Sola have come to terms with the plant. A butcher shop has taken
the name Carniceria Nuclear.
   Hundreds of residents work at the plant, which helps replace
income lost when tourists began to abandon local beaches and market
vendors went elsewhere to buy fish.
   ``I was in the marches'' against the plant, said 30-year-old
Agueda Grajales, who sat behind the cash register in a hardware
store. ``Now I would not go.''
   ``At the beginning, we were afraid because they didn't tell us
anything,'' but now the plant ``is working and nothing is
happening,'' she said.

   A prosecutor in the bribery trial of
suspended Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald said Monday that
``pervasive and cynical corruption'' marked his fourth term leading
the nation's biggest Indian reservation.
   MacDonald is accused of accepting bribes and kickbacks from
businesses operating on the 26,100 square-mile Navajo reservation.
If convicted in tribal District Court on all 42 counts of bribery,
conspiracy and ethics violations, he could be jailed for up to 23
years.
   Also on trial is his son, Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr., an
unemployed lawyer who faces 23 counts of bribery, theft by
extortion, conspiracy and other violations.
   ``You've heard how Peter MacDonald delivered the goods for those
who paid the price,'' prosecutor Richard Hughes said in closing
arguments Monday. ``It reveals a pervasive and cynical corruption
that marked the fourth administration of Peter MacDonald, Sr.''
   Defense attorney Val Jolley argued that MacDonald made no
threats or promises when he accepted loans and gifts from
businessmen, and said the prosecution had put forward only shaky,
circumstantial evidence.
   ``Each stone must fit to build the arch,'' Jolley told the jury.
``If you find there's gaps in the arch, the arch collapses.''
   MacDonald later told supporters outside court that the case was
brought to keep him from running for the new office of tribal
president, which replaces the office of chairman.
   ``I'm confident I did no wrong,'' MacDonald said. ``The
proseuction didn't prove one thing of what they were alleging.''
   The trial, being heard by a jury panel of six Navajos, one
Pueblo Indian and five non-Indians, began Oct. 1. It had been
expected to last several weeks, but the prosecution called its last
witness on Thursday and the defense decided against calling any
witnesses.
   Hughes said MacDonald received payments of more than $400,000
from people doing business with the tribe between November 1986,
when he was elected to a fourth, four-year term, and Feb. 17, 1989,
when he was placed on administrative leave by the Tribal Council.
   Businessmen making loans to MacDonald were never paid back,
Hughes said.
   ``Each one of them paid just after they were on the hook,'' he
said of the businessmen who either had contracts or hoped to have
contracts with the tribe.
   MacDonald and former Chairman Peterson Zah are on the Nov. 6
ballot for the newly created post of tribal president.
   MacDonald's second trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 23. That
trial involves conspiracy charges stemming from the tribe's
purchase of a ranch for $33.4 million from a company which paid
$26.2 million for the property only five minutes earlier. His son
is a co-defendant in that trial.
  A third trial, in which MacDonald faces 93 fraud counts stemming
from the tribe's 1986 primary and general elections, is scheduled
to begin Dec. 4. Suspended Vice Chairman Johnny R. Thompson is a
co-defendant.

<HEAD>Four-year-old Maryland Girl Reaches Out All the Way to Wisconsin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police on Monday charged a Silver
Spring mother with leaving a child unattended after her 4-year-old
daughter, dialing at random, reached a Wisconsin county health
department Monday and said her mother wasn't home.
   The girl, whose name was not given, was found by Montgomery
County police in the Washington suburb of Silver Spring alone in
her apartment after Wisconsin authorities traced the call, a
process that took three hours.
   The girl's mother, Luvisca Deligny, 27, disputed police claims
that she left her daughter alone for most of the morning.
   ``I went up the street to the bank and left a girlfriend with
her,'' the mother said.
   The mother said she had taken the day off from her job in a bank
to care for her daughter, who was ill.
   The daughter reached the ``Public Health Line'' of the Walworth
County Health Department in Wisconsin, where Sarah Weeks answered
the phone.
   ``It was real quiet at first. Then there was this little voice
saying, `i,' She talked about her mom and that she wasn't there,''
Ms. Weeks said.
   Interview by telephone by a Washington Post reporter, the girl
said, ``I as going to call my mommy. I wanted to tell her I was all
alone,'' according to an account in Tuesday editions of the
newspaper.
   Ms. Weeks kept her little caller busy singing nursery rhymes,
ABCs and other songs while others traced the call with the help of
the local phone companies involved and AT&amp;T Corp., whose
long-distance lines handled the call.
   ``She was a real sweetheart,'' she said.
   The girl, ``was bright, aware of what was going on,'' said
Officer Dale Anonsen, one of two police officers who got a
maintenance man to open the apartment. ``She wasn't afraid to talk
to us or go with us.''
   Mother and daughter were reunited at the police station.
   Leaving a child unattended is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine
of $500 and 30 days in jail.

<TEXT>
   Republicans are trying to turn veteran Rep. Frank
Annunzio into a casualty of the nation's savings and loan crisis.
   The 75-year-old Illinois Democrat has rolled over his
competition in 12 re-election bids. But now he faces a tough
challenge from a former Chicago cop who is hitting hard at
Annunzio's dealing with the S&amp;L crisis.
   Republican state Sen. Walter Dudycz contends Annunzio, who heads
a House subcommittee that oversees thrifts, looked the other way
while the crisis was brewing.
   Annunzio, meanwhile, points his finger at the GOP. He blames the
Republican policies of the White House for the nation's S&amp;L
problems.
   He was among those who raised questions about the role of
President Bush's son Neil as a director of the failed Silverado
Banking, Savings &amp; Loan Association in Denver.
   Annunzio proudly displays banners and buttons declaring, ``Jail
the S&amp;L Crooks.''
   Dudycz has responded in kind. His buttons say, ``Jail Annunzio's
S&amp;L Friends.''
   Analysts are predicting a close race and see the contest as a
test case for voter reaction to the S&amp;L disaster.
   ``People are looking to see if politicians will be blamed for
the S&amp;L scandal,'' said political analyst Don Rose. ``It's an issue
that's at a low simmer in some places in the country, waiting to
boil over.''
   Dudycz questioned Annunzio's ethics when it was revealed that
the congressman over the past decade had accepted more than $50,000
in campaign contributions tied to S&amp;Ls. Annunzio contends there was
no conflict of interest.
   ``This is truly a David vs. Goliath race - Frank Annunzio and
the good-old-boy Democratic Party vs. Walter Dudycz and the
taxpayers,'' said Dudycz.
   Annunzio insists it's the other way around. He said Republicans
are exploiting Democratic crossover voting patterns to try to oust
him from the 11th District, which includes part of northwest
Chicago and suburban communities.
   ``The National Republican Party has earmarked me for defeat,''
Annunzio says. ``They thought I would play dead because of my age,
but I'm not going to roll over.''
   The National Republican Congressional Committee filed a
complaint with the Federal Election Commission claiming that
Annunzio filed to provide employment information about 20
contributors who were associated with a Maryland thrift.
   Annunzio's camp maintained the complaint was GOP retribution for
an S&amp;L-related ethics complaint the Democrats filed against
Republican Rep. Denny Smith of Oregon.
   Annunzio also has been criticized for reports that two of his
sons-in-law once worked for the savings and loan industry's chief
lobbying group, the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. And he
admits he once tried to get one of them a position with the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board in Chicago.
   He contends there ws nothing improper about the request and
stresses that the position was non-paying.
   Annunzio has attacked Dudycz for being on the Cook County
sheriff's payroll as a deputy while he was a state senator working
primarily in downstate Springfield.
   Both men say their ties to the community will make the
difference. Each uses ethnic working-class roots to seek support
from a constituency composed of police officers, firefighters and
other blue-collar residents who are first-generation Americans born
of Eastern European parents.
   Annunzio - a senior citizen in a community with the highest
median age of any Illinois district - casts himself as a champion
of the elderly. He voted against recent federal budget bills
because they contained cuts in Medicare.
   Dudycz, 40, is a relative newcomer to the political scene who
calls himself an ``American's American.'' He attracted attention in
1989 when he led daily rallies at the Art Institute of Chicago to
protest an exhibit displaying the U.S. flag on the floor.
   The self-styled populist has railed against increases in state
income taxes and property taxes. He's counting on radio advertising
and door-to-door canvassing to increase his name recognition.
   Annunzio, who has spent most of his recent time in Washington,
is trying to make up for his absence with advertising bought from
an $800,000 campaign war chest.
   ``We've basically had to change from a '60s type of campaign to
a sophisticated marketing strategy - go from zero to 60 in 6.3
seconds,'' said Kevin Tynan, one of Annunzio's sons-in-law and his
campaign manager.

<TEXT>
   Larger-than-life campaign posters of
ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, her loyalists and political
opponents clutter the pristine boulevards of the cities and the
bumpy dirt roads to the villages.
   Colorful party flags flutter atop mud-and-straw huts, modern
high-rise buildings, on bicycles, bullock carts and pickup trucks.
Loudspeakers blare the slogans of favorite candidates.
   Despite all the trappings, the campaign for the Oct. 24
parliamentary election lacks the wide public enthusiam that
heralded Pakistan's return to democracy two years ago.
   This election is being fought in the courtroom, not the
countryside.
   When President Ghulam Ishaq Khan ousted Ms. Bhutto on Aug. 6 and
called the election three years early, most Pakistanis were pretty
fed up with her performance and an ineffective Parliament paralyzed
by 20 months of bickering.
   The caretaker government, made up of former allies with little
in common except contempt for Ms. Bhutto, thought it would produce
enough evidence to prove she presided over Pakistan's most corrupt
and inept government.
   They boasted she would be forced out of politics for seven
years, maybe forever, and the left-leaning Pakistan People's Party
founded by her father, the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,
would be destroyed.
   Government lawyers crossed the country filing charge after
charge against the 37-year-old former prime minister, six former
Cabinet ministers and ultimately her husband.
   But even Ms. Bhutto's strongest critics now privately admit the
evidence is questionable and the credibilty of the caretakers -
called the ``undertakers'' by Pakistan's Urdu- and English-language
press - has been called into doubt.
   ``We wanted to make her the villian, but instead she's becoming
the victim,'' said one government official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``Now we are on trial and the verdict will be
delivered Oct. 24.''
   Promises of elections are the threads holding together the
delicate fabric of Pakistan's democracy, which unexpectedly
returned in 1988 when the military dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq, died in a still unexplained plane crash.
   Pro-government newspapers and state-owned radio and television
carry daily reassurances from Ishaq Khan and the powerful army
chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, that the polls will be held
on time ``come what may'' and that power will be transferred to the
choice of the people ``irrespective of who wins.''
   But in a country ruled by the military for more than half its
43-year existence, such promises have been broken too many time in
the past to inspire confidence.
   Politicians hurl accusations and insults at each other instead
of talking about the real issues that trouble this Moslem country
of 110 million people: a soaring birthrate, increasing poverty and
rising prices that are putting many of the basic necessities out of
reach.
   ``The politicians certainly aren't capable of running the
country,'' said Imran Rafiq Bhatt, a 25-year-old charity worker in
the eastern village of Visvian. ``We should give the country to
Japan on lease for eight years and maybe they could straighten
things out.''
   The events surrounding Ms. Bhutto's dismissal and her trials
before the special tribunals resurrected from the days of martial
law have only served to make Pakistanis more cynical about the
future.
   But analysts say the caretaker government has become Ms.
Bhutto's best friend, making her the underdog and helping halt and
then reverse her declining popularity and galvanize the
disillusioned rank-and-file in her party.
   Ms. Bhutto, the daughter of wealth and privilege, is cast as the
``poor people's sister,'' the champion of freedom and democracy,
the scrappy fighter of political oppression.
   It is a role she played so well for a decade after her father
was overthrown in 1977 military coup and hanged two years later -
the daughter of wealth and privilege advocating freedom, democracy
and people power.
   While the caretaker government was busy trying to collect facts
and figures in a bureaucratic manner, she criss-crossed the country
in a Pajero jeep, inching through the surging, suffocating crowds
and appealing to the sentiments of the people, then traveling all
night to her next court appearance.
   Soon the stories of large-scale corruption and mismangement
began to fade and sympathy for her grow.
   ``Her appeal is direct, sentimental and down-to-earth. She still
carries the day,'' said political analyst Syed Alamdar Raza. `The
coalition in power and her opponents who want to be in power have
no one who comes anywhere near her.''
   When she was in power and times were good, Ms. Bhutto said in an
interview, she occasionally thought about the day when she would
give up politics to devote time to her young children, son Bilawal
and daughter Bakhtawar.
   ``Now is not the time to talk or even think about retirement,''
she said during a weeklong campaign swing through eastern Punjab,
the country's most prosperous province and home to more than 60
million Pakistanis.
   Government officials and bureaucrats admit privately they
underestimated her drive, her ambition and her steely
determination.
   Even her most bitter opponents calculate she and the People's
Party will win about 80 seats in the 217-member National Assembly,
the law-making lower house of Parliament that chooses the prime
minister. That would fall short of an outright majority but most
likely make hers the largest single party.

   For the second time in less than a week, the
House voted Monday night to scrap strict anti-obscenity
restrictions on the National Endowment for the Arts and to penalize
grant recipients who are subsequently convicted of violating
obscenity laws.
   The House took the unusual step of tacking the entire NEA
measure it had approved Thursday onto a separate, $11.9 billion
appropriations bill for the Interior Department and several other
federal agencies, including the arts endowment, and sent the
combined package to the Senate.
   Supporters of the parliamentary maneuver argued that prospects
for final enactment of the House's previously approved endowment
bill, which now awaits Senate action, would be enhanced by
attaching it to a higher priority appropriations measure also
headed for the Senate floor.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said there was ``little if any
chance'' that the original bill, which would authorize a three-year
extension of the arts endowment, would survive in the waning days
of an election-year Congress mired in a budgetary crisis.
   He said the appropriations bill stands a much greater chance of
final congressional passage than the authorization bill.
   ``This will assure, I hope, that something that the House wants
in this very divisive matter reaches the president's desk and
becomes law,'' Williams said.
   The money bill, which the House passed on a 327-80 roll call,
says obscenity ``shall not be funded'' by the arts endowment. But
it shifts to the courts the responsibility for deciding whether
federally subsidized arts projects are obscene.
   Under the bill, grant recipients convicted of creating obscene
art must give the government its money back before they can apply
for any new NEA grants.
   In addition, the bill orders wide-ranging reforms in the
endowment's grant-making procedures to make its financing decisions
more responsive to the public interest. It would increase the
states' share of grant funds from 20 percent to 35 percent over
three years.
   Identical language was contained in the endowment's
authorization bill which the House approved 349-76 last week.
   On Monday, the House approved the same compromise measure
drafted by Williams and Rep. E. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., on a 234-171
roll call as a substitute for a more strongly worded proposal by
Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio.
   Regula's amendment would have forbidden the endowment to
subsidize obscene or indecent works and ordered the NEA chairman to
ensure that federally supported works ``are appropriate for a
general audience.''
   On a followup vote, the House ratified the Williams-Coleman
compromise on a 342-58 roll call. Then the House approved, 327-80,
the entire appropriations bill for the Interior Department, the
Forest Service, some Energy Department programs, the Smithsonian
Institution and other agencies for the current fiscal year, which
began Oct. 1.
   Included was $180 million in arts endowment spending this year,
a 5 percent increase over its $171 million budget last year.
   Before the final vote, the House approved, 251-155, a proposal
by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., to increase grazing fees on public
lands by 500 percent over the next four years. The plan, supported
by environmental interests, was heatedly opposed by Western
lawmakers.
   The bill also includes a one-year moratorium on exploring for
oil and gas in federal waters in many areas off New England, the
East Coast, Florida, California, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska.

   Deep in the night, ``Iraqi
forces'' rapidly approach a U.S. artillery position. The mock
battle peaks with a cry of ``Breakaway!''
   Specialist Joe Pierce slaps on night-vision goggles and races a
self-propelled howitzer cannon across the sand. He doesn't always
find his next position.
   Pilots and drivers of the army's 101st Airborne Division, hoping
to hone their night-fighting skills, are finding that the desert
terrain creates problems for the high-tech goggles.
   The difficulties include a reduction in depth perception and
bright lights ruining the sensors in some older model goggles.
   The 101st, 70 miles south of the Kuwaiti border, is the closest
full American division to the frontier and could be the first to
engage in combat with Iraqi forces.
   The U.S. military has stressed its night-fighting ability as a
big advantage over Iraqi forces, who avoided night battles during
the 1980-88 war with Iran.
   ``We expect to fight at night,'' said Maj. Lee Flake, 36, of
Swansea, S.C.
   Looking through the battery-powered goggles, everything in a
200-yard radius appears bathed in bright green light. The goggles
look like binoculars, with a special head brace.
   ``Because everything in the desert is the same color, it's hard
to pick up whether it's a hill or it's flat,'' said Pierce, 20, of
Dodridge, W.Va. during maneuvers Saturday.
   Hitting a small sand ridge at 15 mph can bounce the driver out
of the all-terrain vehicles that are the backbone of army forces in
Saudi Arabia.
   ``I thought Mike Tyson had knocked me one,'' said Sgt. Ernest
West, 39, of Trenton, Ga., comparing a jolt from a ridge to a punch
from the former heavyweight boxing champion.
   Several fatal airplane and helicopter crashes in the past week
have been blamed on difficulty in seeing upcoming hills and
recognizing the difference between the sky and desert.
   Even when pilots get close to the ground, the landing spot can
be obscured by blowing sand that the night-vision goggles cannot
penetrate.
   The U.S. military is now avoiding ground-hugging flight
maneuvers that simulate night combat conditions and requiring two
pilots at the controls.
   The problem is especially acute when there's a full moon, or no
moon.
   The glasses intensify small amounts of light and a full moon
often washes out any contrast in the landscape. Without any moon,
there's little light available for the goggles to gather.
   ``When there's no moon, you just drive straight and pray,'' said
one driver from the 502nd Field Infantry Regiment.
   Another problem, especially with the older models, is that any
bright light hurts the wearer's eyes and can also destroy the
goggles.
   The tubes in about 100 goggles were blown out when oncoming cars
flashed high-beam headlights at military convoys.
   Officers said the flashes from exploding shells might
temporarily render the goggles ineffective, but not destroy them.
   They point out that the technology has improved vastly in recent
years and constant training is improving performance.

<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An impoverished refugee woman's arrest for
scavenging through garbage cans in search of recyclable items has
angered advocates for the poor and raised questions about who has
the right to turn trash into cash.
   ``The right to eat ... takes precedence over the city's right,''
said Karina O'Malley, director of a Green Bay homeless shelter and
a member of a task force studying homelessness in Wisconsin. ``I
don't see why the city has to pit itself against the poor.
   ``This is a way for them to eke out a living without
panhandling.''
   Ms. O'Malley was among those who criticized the arrest of Tru
Vang, a 56-year-old Laotian Hmong refugee cited in August on
charges of violating a new anti-scavenging ordinance in Madison.
   The ordinance was enacted this year after the Wisconsin
Legislature passed a law requiring all communities to recycle
aluminum, paper, glass and other materials by 1995 to conserve
dwindling landfill space.
   The city attorney's office on Sept. 28 dropped the charges
against Ms. Vang, who had faced a fine of more than $300, after
Mayor Paul Soglin and several other city officials decried her
arrest as a wrong application of the anti-scavenging ordinance.
   The mayor said the law was aimed at people who might be tempted
to pickuup large amounts of recyclable material already sorted and
bagged for the city's curbside recycling program - not at a poor
person going through trash.
   Although the charge was dropped, the incident embarrassed many
in Madison, the state capital and home to the largest University of
Wisconsin campus. This town of 170,000 prides itself on ethnic
diversity, social concern and its strong opposition to the Vietnam
war during the 1960s and '70s.
   ``We can give tax breaks to developers ... and AT&amp;T, and then we
find time to prosecute a woman for selling cans to supplement her
welfare,'' Alderman Andrew Heidt complained during a recent city
council meeting.
   The clash between recycling interests and poor people looking
through garbage cans to find aluminum cans or newspapers to recycle
is inevitable, some say.
   Communities that mandate recycling have an economic interest in
ensuring that material set aside for recycling is collected by the
city and sold to recycling outlets to finance the program's
continuation.
   ``Everybody's seen the poor people with the shopping carts who
do this (pick through garbage). In a way, they're providing a
service to the public,'' said Pat Vanderburgh, assistant
superintendent of the Milwaukee Rescue Mission, a homeless shelter
in Milwaukee.
   He predicted that organized recycling programs could reduce such
people's income.
   ``As you have more recycling, you're going to have less
recyclable material available to people who need to go through the
garbage to make money,'' said state Rep. Spencer Black, one of the
authors of Wisconsin's recycling law.
   But Black said he believes the Madison ordinance is unnecessary
if it applies to scavengers.
   ``This situation is different. I don't see any value in a law
that stops people from recycling,'' Black said.
   Some suggest that a creative solution exists.
   Col. Leon Ferraez, a spokesman for the Salvation Army
headquarters in Verona, N.J., advocates programs that pay poor
people for recycling by picking up garbage no one wants.
   ``There should be a way to bring both sides together - recycling
material and recycling lives,'' Ferraez said.
   Others predict there will always be enough recyclable trash for
the poor but municipalities may not have the business sense to use
recycling as an economic development tool for everyone.
   ``Why should counties re-create the wheel when there are people
who need to make ends meet that are capable of working in programs
that can serve the community?'' said Dave Hurd, a recycling
specialist for a New York City concern that pays for garbage
collection and provides recycling services to businesses with trash
disposal and recycling problems.

<TEXT>
   A retired financial planner thinks he has an
answer to the federal budget deficit - vote out every incumbent on
Capitol Hill.
   And he's not kidding.
   ``Throw the Hypocritical Rascals Out,'' Jack Gargan urges in a
full-page ad that has appeared in 160 newspapers coast-to-coast,
from weekly shoppers to big-city dailies. Gargan has also gone on
the radio and TV talk-show circuit.
   He's turned his one-man crusade to unseat every member of
Congress into a non-profit organization called THRO Inc.
   His headquarters in Tampa has been bombarded with calls, mail
and hundreds of thousands in donations that he uses to buy more
advertising.
   ``I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore,'' the
headline of the ad screams in big, bold type.
   Gargan, 59, goes on to say he's appalled at the national debt,
angry at congressional pay raises and fed up over the savings and
loan scandal.
   ``But mostly I'm sad that we, as a nation, have thrown up our
hands in surrender to the politicians and bureaucrats who have put
us in this predicament,'' he writes.
   Gargan urges readers to return pledge cards and asks that they
push for an amendment limiting how long lawmakers may serve and
cast out all incumbents.
   ``There's no way we could end up with anything worse than what
we already have,'' he argues.
   Gargan last week said he formed THRO last summer with $45,000 of
his own money. Since then about $400,000 in donations have rolled
in. He's spent between $2,000 and $55,000 per ad. A few
publications have refused to run it.
   Overall, Gargan said, the response has surprised even him. He
said he has gotten more than 40,000 replies, almost all of them
positive.
   ``We can take our country back from the career politician and
shock the bejabbers out of some of those fat cats who thought they
were safe for years,'' he said.
   At the Democratic National Committee in Washington, spokesman
Jim Dresler said he knows about the movement only because a friend
sent him a copy of the ad as a joke. As for reaction from
congressmen, he said, ```There's been nothing at all.''
   At the Republican National Committee, spokesman Scott Sowry
said: ``I saw it in USA Today. It's evident it's an example of
voters across the country being fed up.''
   ``Atta boy, finally someone has the guts, gumption and gusto to
put his money where his mouth is. ... It is an idea whose time is
now,'' wrote a man from Charlotte, N.C.
   A reader from Sussex, Wis., put the ad on a widely-used computer
bulletin board. A Springfield, Ill., businessman promised to turn
the ad into flyers to pass out in his store. A 38-member business
coalition in Tucson, Ariz., sent a check for $250 and pledged to
``lead the charge here.''
   A woman from San Diego who said she cried when she read the ad
told Gargan: ``I haven't voted in years. ... Well, believe me, I'm
going to vote from now on.''
   One unsigned letter came from a person who read the ad in the
Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader and agreed with the premise but
feared ``the real Jack could be a sleaze ball con artist, age 40,
who wears $500 suits and has a top-of-the-line BMW parked
outside.''
   Gargan retired six years ago from a career in insurance and
financial planning. In the 1970s he ran for a Tampa City Council
seat as a ``shoestring candidate.'' His trademark was a shoelace
worn hanging from his lapel.
   He spent less than $5 on his campaign for postage. He got 13,000
votes but lost.
   ``I've been steaming for years,'' he said. ``I'm recently
retired and had the time, money, anger and idea.''

<HEAD>City Spending: From Electricity to Feed Pellets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Think you have trouble balancing your checkbook?
Mayor David Dinkins runs a municipal household with a $222 million
electric bill, a $20 million gasoline tab and 103 police horses
that gobble up $70,000 a year in hay and feed pellets.
   New York's $28 billion expense budget is larger than that of any
American city and all but two of the 50 states.
   It's easy to wind up $1.4 billion in the hole when you have
these kinds of costs:
   -$10 million to run Central Park for one year;
   -$12.2 million for a year's supply of disposable plates, cups,
napkins, forks, knives and spoons for school cafeterias;
   -$5,500 a month for 40 pounds of dog chow for each of 18 police
dogs;
   -$4.2 million a year to make, install and repair 67,420 traffic
signs;
   -$4.2 million for a winter's supply of rock salt (135,000 tons).
   If the city's budget is a far cry from the average household's,
it also bears relatively little resemblence to that of any other
municipality in this hemisphere.
   No other U.S. city has more than two public hospitals; New York
has 16, and they consume $4.3 million a year in latex gloves, $1.3
million in needles and syringes, $1.8 million in diapers, infant
and adult.
   Similarly, the city pays an unparalleled $2 billion a year in
public assistance. By one recent count 849,768 New Yorkers are on
welfare, a figure greater than the population of all but 10 U.S.
cities.
   With the economy slumping nationally and in the Northeast, New
York is grappling with a deficit that has prompted comparisons to
the city's near-bankruptcy in 1975.
   On any given day the city spends more than $1 million on
overtime, and much more in times of crisis. After an arson fire
killed 87 people at a Bronx social club, firefighters alone worked
$500,000 in overtime inspecting other such clubs.
   The city's second-quarter overtime king was John McKenna, who
made $16,400, or 29 percent of his $55,400 yearly salary. McKenna,
``senior stationary engineer'' at Queens Hospital Center, was
responsible for the installation of hundreds of new air
conditioners.
   Some of the city's spending figures are simply heartbreaking. On
the night of July 2 it spent $400,000 to house 3,196 homeless
families, 462 of them in barracks-style shelters. As child welfare
department caseloads swelled in the second quarter, social workers
billed $3.4 million in overtime.
   According to a recent count, the city was spending $688 million
yearly to care for 54,712 foster children - $10,805 per child. The
cost is an increase of 166 percent since 1985.
   The city, at least, gets a badly needed break by buying in bulk:
about $18,000 a week for 180,000 eggs and $450,000 a month for
300,000 pounds of poultry. The 23,000 municipal cars, trucks,
tractors, snowblowers, motorcycles and other vehicles, which use
about 17 million gallons of regular unleaded gasoline a year, fill
up at well below the average pump price.
   Some of the costs of local government are fairly esoteric, such
as $300,000 a year to reduce noise and $2.7 million for a two-year
study to determine the origin of trash that washes up on the
beaches. About $5 million goes to plant 12,000 new trees. But since
about 20,000 trees die each year, the tree population still
declines by about 20 a day.
   City officials seem to have a good handle on some costs but not
on others. For instance, last year's bill for English and Spanish
newspapers for the 20,000 jail inmates was $155,230.68. That was
one paper for every 30 inmates, the ratio prescribed by law.
   On the other hand, no one seems to know the final bill for the
11,000 pairs of shoes purchased last year (9,000 of them for the
Corrections Department) or the 1.2 million square feet of netting
to cover garbage barges.
   The telephone bill is another mystery; New York Telephone says
it does not divulge information about any customer's bills.
   This much is known: Earlier this year the Manhattan district
attorney's office discovered that one of its secretaries was
accepting collect calls from her imprisoned boyfriend, and then
transferring his calls - and those of other inmates - to points
across the map. The bill had passed $10,000 before she was fired.
   One last item. The Sanitation Department will replace 9,700 of
its 22,000 curbside litter baskets at a cost of $535,350.
   Where do the old ones go?
   ``People burn leaves in them. And they use them for barbecues,''
said department spokesman Jim Hart. ``I'm not going to their house
for dinner.''

   Talk show host Larry King says his fantasy
interview would be with Jesus Christ.
   ``I would ask him if he believed that he was born of virgin
birth, because whatever the answer is changes or reinforces the
world,'' King said in an interview in People magazine's Oct. 22
issue.
   King, 56, said his toughest interviews were Demond Wilson, who
starred in the TV series ``Sanford and Son,'' and actor Robert
Mitchum.
   ``The worst was Wilson,'' said King. ``He didn't want to be
there, and he was brash and obnoxious. He wasn't very nice.''
   Mitchum ``just gave me one-word answers,'' King said. ``In a
half hour I must have asked him 832 questions. I was down to asking
him, `Well, do you think it's going to rain tomorrow?' ''
   Nevertheless, King said, ``I like Mitchum a lot.''
   King will be host of a new variety show, ``Sunday Night With
Larry King,'' beginning Oct. 28 on NBC.

   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) - Willie Nelson says he doesn't care much
for politicians, but he's all for Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Gatewood Galbraith because Galbraith is all for
marijuana.
   Galbraith wants to legalize marijuana and even use it for food
and fuel.
   ``I'm for the war on drugs,'' Nelson said Sunday at a Democratic
Party rally, to the consternation of more traditional Democrats.
   ``I'm not in favor of the war on flowers and herbs. Marijuana is
an herb and a flower,'' the country singer said. ``God put it here.
What gives them the right to say God's wrong?''
   Nelson and Galbraith say they are regular marijuana smokers.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson and other Democrats at the rally
denounced Galbraith and said they do not support legalization of
marijuana.

   RADNOR, Pa. (AP) - William Conrad of ``Jake and the Fatman''
says the change of venue for the CBS show has him at odds with its
producer, Dean Hargrove.
   ``He loves shows that I don't. I look for human emotions, human
involvement,'' Conrad said in the Oct. 20 issue of TV Guide. ``I
don't like car chases. I don't like gunfights. I don't like fights
that are unnecessary.''
   Conrad predicted the show will be more violent because of
Hargrove's decision to move the show's setting from Hawaii to Los
Angeles for the third year of the series.
   ``I would have quit a year and a half ago if I'd had the chance,
but if you sign on for five years, you go on if its stays in
production for five years,'' he said.

   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Actress Sally Struthers will be presented
Tuesday with the Presidential End Hunger Award by President Bush in
Washington.
   The former ``All in the Family'' co-star works for the Christian
Children's Fund and spends much of her time trying to clothe, feed
and educate poor children around the world.
   Struthers, 42, said she was surprised to learn of the
presidential award while on the set of ``Murder, She Wrote,'' the
CBS mystery series.
   Struthers was in Portland over the weekend to help with a
benefit auction for an organization that helps parents identify
hearing problems in children.

<HEAD>East Germans Still Chasing Dream of Affluence</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dream dazzled them, seduced them, gave them
the will to dissolve their nation and unleash tremendous social
upheaval.
   To the people once called East Germans, the dream was Western
prosperity and the belief that it was tantalizingly close, perhaps
just around the corner.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his golden vision of affluence won
another victory Sunday that will help solidify his chances of
winning the united German elections on Dec. 2.
   His conservative Christian Democrats won four of the five states
in what was once East Germany but is now only the rundown, low-rent
backwater of a wealthy nation.
   As far as the territory's evolution from Communism to democracy,
the elections were vitally important because they will give the
former nation five new state governments.
   These states will have to quickly dismantle the strongly
entrenched Communist framework and reshape it to fit the federalist
system in western Germany.
   On a social and political level, however, the elections were new
fuel for the engine that drove German unity in the first place: the
quest for affluence.
   When East Germany's hard-line Communist rulers were toppled last
year, the borders were opened to the West and the seeds of German
unity took root.
   East Germans saw the prosperity enjoyed by their Western
neighbors. Kohl and his staunchly free market party, to many of
them, were synonymous with wealth and success.
   He campaigned on behalf of his Christian Democratic surrogates
in the months before the nation's first free elections in March.
The party promised quick unification as a means to quick
prosperity.
   They were elected overwhelmingly. Their mandate was largely
affirmed in May, when the nation chose its first freely elected
local governments.
   Unity finally came on Oct. 3, but the nation that was known as
East Germany is still East Germany, if not in name.
   More than 2 million of its 8 million workers are either
unemployed or being kept on artificial payrolls subsidized by West
German money. Grocery prices have skyrocketed and rents and energy
costs will soon follow.
   The main opposition, the left-leaning Social Democrats, has been
campaigning on a gloom-and-doom platform, arguing that greater
social benefits are needed to help the easterners survive in the
new free market economy.
   They have warned the westerners that higher taxes are inevitable
to pay for Kohl's quick push to unify their nation with an economic
wasteland.
   On Sunday, however, eastern Germans voted for the Christian
Democrats again in four of the five states.
   Wolfgang Thierse, a top East German Social Democrat, alluded to
the lure of affluence in remarks that were probably sour grapes but
also touched on the very real belief among East Germans that Kohl's
party is still their key to salvation.
   ``We can't present ourselves, and don't want to present
ourselves, as the party of big money,'' Thierse said. ``We also
can't present ourselves as miracle workers.
   ``But I think so many people here are so uncertain and so
worried, that they want to believe in miracles,'' he added. ``So
perhaps they may think that the CDU is closer to the money, and
thus promises them prosperity more quickly.''
   The results of the elections were enough to allow Koh''s party
to wrest from the Social Democrats control of the upper house of
Parliament, where representation is based on state balloting.
   It also put Kohl in a stronger position heading into the Dec. 2
national parliamentary elections, when once again his party and the
promise of affluence for eastern Germany will be put to the test.
   Though he leads in the polls, however, this will be the first
election in which western Germans will also have a say in the
matter.

   Army wives and girlfriends here have
had to learn how to fix cars, coach football and serve as stand-in
fathers at the maternity ward ever since 14,000 soldiers marched
off to Saudi Arabia.
   ``You see the women doing the trash, you see women - like me -
changing a flat,'' said Charlotte Clabough. Her husband, 1st Sgt.
James Clabough, is in Saudi Arabia.
   She and Tibbie Smith, whose husband, Sgt. Gary Smith, was sent
to the Persian Gulf as well, have also learned to coach youth
football since their spouses shipped out.
   ``We've got some boys who at first thought, `These women don't
know anything about football,' '' said Mrs. Clabough. ``I feel
we've won their confidence.''
   Jerome Washington, director of an athletic program at Fort
Stewart that serves 1,000 youngsters, said 14 of the 18 soccer
coaches now are women.
   ``Most of them knew we didn't have enough men,'' he said. ``They
know for the programs to go, we've got to have coaches.''
   Many women are also getting ready to coach about 700 women
scheduled to deliver babies between now and March at the base
hospital.
   A husband normally would be there to help with the delivery,
said Maj. Ann Kenny, chief of community health nursing at Fort
Stewart.
   ``Ideally, it is a family event. It helps to have someone there
to hold your hand and support you,'' said Kenny, who is pregnant.
Her husband, Maj. Timothy Joe Kenny, also is in the Persian Gulf.
   Some of Fort Stewart's teachers, many of them Army wives, have
also volunteered to stay after school to help kids with homework.
   ``There's a lot of little people out there who need to know that
just because Daddy is gone, things can still be normal,'' said
teacher Mary Gleason, whose boyfriend, 1st Lt. Robert Irwin, is in
Saudi Arabia.
   The women also have found ways to unwind as they wait for word
on when their husbands might return.
   On one recent night about 60 lined up outside Kracker Jacks, a
nightclub featuring muscular young men who wear little clothing.
   ``You can't sit home and crochet,'' said waitress Carrie Kates.
``Everyone needs to let their hair down once in a while and this is
a relatively harmless way to do it.''

<HEAD>U.S. Worried About Pakistani Nuclear Capability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that its own nuclear standoff with the
Soviet Union is easing, the United States is looking for a way to
defuse the potential for atomic war between Pakistan and India.
   ``The situation is that both India and Pakistan have nuclear
weapons, or at least the wherewithal to assemble components into
deliverable warheads quickly - and both sides know it,'' says Paul
L. Levanthal, president of the Nuclear Control Institute.
   The United States suspended aid to Pakistan on Oct. 1 because a
law required such action if President Bush was unable to certify
that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear device. The suspension
took effect automatically when Bush failed to certify.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III outlined his thoughts on
the nuclear issue last week to Pakistani Foreign Minister Yaqub
Khan. The State Department refused substantive comment on the
meeting, citing the sensitivity of the subject matter.
   Leonard Spector, a nuclear arms expert at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, calls the evolving situation in South Asia
``very dangerous.''
   Despite strong indications of Pakistani efforts to acquire a
nuclear weapons capability, the United States generally looked the
other way in recent years, seeing Pakistan as an indispensable ally
in efforts to drive Soviet troops out of Afghanistan.
   With Pakistan providing safe haven for Afghan rebels and the
United States supplying arms to the insurgents, the Soviets decided
to end their presence in Afghanistan in February 1989.
   U.S. economic and military aid to Pakistan this past fiscal year
totaled $582 million, the highest total worldwide after Israel and
Egypt.
   But Pakistan's strategic importance to the United States has
diminished now that the Soviets have withdrawn from Afghanistan and
the Cold War has faded.
   And with Pakistan apparently having succeeded in its quest for
atomic weapons, ``South Asia thus becomes the first region of the
developing world in which principal rivals have achieved mutual
nuclear deterrence,'' Levanthal says.
   One complicating factor for the administration is that Pakistan
is being run by a lame duck government that won't leave office
until after national elections on Oct. 24.
   Several experts suggested that the administration and Congress,
in consultation with the Pakistanis, attempt to work out terms for
renewing aid to Pakistan.
   An indefinite aid cutoff could rob the United States of leverage
with the Pakistanis and actually accelerate the arms race in the
subcontinent, says James Phillips of the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank.
   He says the United States should try to promote negotiations
between the Pakistan and India on nuclear arms reductions.
   Levanthal agrees. ``The challenge for the United States is to
act promptly in a way that puts a cap on the present situation,
avoids triggering a nuclear arms race and sets the stage for a
longer-term process of reduction and elimination of nuclear
weapons,'' he says.
   Spector says the administration should encourage Pakistan to
sacrifice the gains it has made in its nuclear program over the
past year. This would reduce the possibility that continuing
tensions between India and Pakistan, particularly over the strife
in Kashmir, could degenerate into a nuclear exchange.
   ``If we could accomplish that, it would be worthwhile,'' says
Spector.
   The U.S.-Pakistani landscape is cluttered with side issues that
further confuse an already murky situation. The two countries were
able to weather differences in the past because of the shared
hostility toward the Soviet Union.
   But now, Washington is concerned about major flows of heroin
from Pakistan into the United States each year and also doubts the
country's resolve to restore democracy. Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto was dismissed from office on Aug. 6 by presidential order on
charges of corruption and abuse of power.
   Beyond that, the administration is displeased that Pakistan has
been funneling U.S. aid for Afghan rebels based in Pakistan to the
most anti-Western of the rebel factions.

   Guy Hunt became Alabama's first
Republican governor of this century in a 1986 landslide that his
critics viewed as a fluke.
   In a bid for re-election, Hunt is locked in a close race against
Democratic challenger Paul Hubbert, executive secretary of the
67,000-member state teachers' union.
   Hunt is trying to put his name in the history books alongside
George Wallace as the only Alabama governors elected to two
straight terms. Hubbert is trying to become the first National
Education Association member elected governor of a state, according
to NEA records.
   Hubbert has tapped the state teachers' union's political war
chest and its state-wide volunteer network. Several top aides to
former governor Wallace also are working in the Hubbert campaign.
   Hunt has warned business interests that Hubbert is a pro-union
candidate who would carry out a liberal agenda. Former President
Reagan visited Alabama to attend a Hunt fundraiser and rally.
   Hubbert says the governor of Alabama is elected by the white,
middle-class, working male and that by watching what pickup trucks
carry ``as far as bumper stickers are concerned, you'll see what
direction the race is going.''
   But ``the guy in the pickup truck ... I think he's more of a
Hunt voter than a Hubbert voter,'' says Margaret Latimer, a
political science professor at Auburn University.
   Hunt, a north Alabama fruit farmer and a Primitive Baptist
preacher, was Reagan's campaign chairman in Alabama in 1976 and
1980. He never went to college and sold Amway products while
struggling with a six-figure debt left from a losing 1978 campaign
for governor.
   A bitter Democratic primary four years ago alienated many
traditional Democratic voters and propelled Hunt from GOP obscurity
to victor.
   Like Wallace of the 1960s, Hunt bristles at criticism of the
state. In June, he seethed at a national magazine article that
depicted Alabama as chained to a political history preventing it
from enjoying New South prosperity, tax reform and educational
advancement.
   In contrast, Hubbert says Alabama must recognize it rivals many
Third World countries in its pockets of poverty, infant mortality
rates and dismal health care in backwater communities.
   Hubbert, also from rural Alabama, holds a doctorate in
education. He became known as ``governor'' in the 1970s by building
the biracial teachers' union into a major political force.
   Despite his ties to liberal and progressive wings in the Alabama
Democratic Party, Hubbert has billed himself as fiscally
conservative and tough on crime.
   The ethics of both candidates are a campaign issue.
   Democrats produced a check showing that Hunt's campaign
organization paid a personal mortgage note held by Hunt and his
wife. Hunt said the mortgage was tied to debts left over from his
losing 1978 campaign.
   Hubbert said the Hunt camp pilfered a document from Hubbert's
headquarters. The document says the Democratic nominee should focus
on the question: ``Is Guy Hunt a crook?''
   Hubbert is running a ``dirty tricks'' campaign, Hunt asserts.
   Hunt ran an attack ad showing Hubbert sitting in a car with his
top associate, a black political organizer from the Alabama
Education Association.
   The ad ``reminded me of the campaigns of the early'' Wallace
years, said political science professor Latimer. Deliberately or
not, she believes the Hunt ad ``will play racist.''
   The governor's campaign press secretary says the ad is simply an
attempt to point out Hubbert's base of support, the state teachers'
union.
   Hubbert's campaign is his first race for statewide political
office and it comes one year after he received the liver of a
15-year-old boy in a transplant operation.
   A Hunt supporter has injected the issue of Hubbert's health into
the campaign.
   ``I've had doctors tell me that anybody who has a liver
transplant can become very sick, very quickly,'' said former state
attorney general Charlie Graddick.
   Hubbert, 54, is ``healthy as a horse,'' retorted Hubbert
spokesman Michael Tucker. ``We're seeing an attack by a thoroughly
discredited hatchet man.''
   Graddick switched to the Republican Party after unsuccessfully
seeking to become the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in the
bitterly contested 1986 primary.

   Here is a comparison of key parts of rival
deficit-reduction plans backed by House Democrats and the Senate
Finance Committee:
   GASOLINE: No change in the House bill. The Senate would raise
the 9-cent tax to 18{ cents a gallon by 1992. Neither bill would
affect heating oil.
   INDEXING: The House would forgo for one year the annual
adjustments to income tax brackets and personal exemptions, which
are designed to protect against inflation-caused bracket creep.
That would mean higher income taxes for everybody in 1991. The
Senate has no such provision.
   ALCOHOL: House - Raise the $12.50-a-gallon tax on 100-proof
liquor by $1; double the beer tax to 32 cents a six-pack; raise
taxes on most wines, including table wine, which would go from 3
cents a 750-milliliter bottle to 25 cents. Senate - Raise liquor
tax by $1.20; double beer tax; raise wine tax to 21 cents.
   TOBACCO: Either would raise the 16-cent cigarette tax by 4 cents
in 1991 and another 4 cents in 1993. Snuff, cigars and other
tobacco would face 25 percent tax increases each year.
   FLYING: Either would raise the 8 percent tax on airline tickets
to 10 percent.
   LUXURIES: Either would impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of
the price of cars above $30,000; boats above $100,000; jewelry
above $5,000; furs above $10,000 (House) or $5,000 (Senate), and
private planes $100,000 (House) or $250,000 (Senate).
   TAX RATES: The House bill would raise the top rate paid by the
wealthiest people, now 28 percent, to 33 percent. It would impose a
10 percent surtax on those with taxable incomes over $1 million.
The Senate bill would do neither.
   ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS: The Senate would limit itemized deductions
(except those for medical expenses and investment interest) of
people with adjusted gross income over $100,000. Only 95 percent of
deductions would be allowed against the portion of income above
$100,000.
   CAPITAL GAINS: The House bill would allow a person to avoid tax
on half of up to $200,000 of capital gains earned in a lifetime;
the gains could come from most investments but not from stocks. A
person with annual income under $100,000 could avoid tax on another
$1,000 a year of gains, including those on the sale of stock. No
capital gain would be taxed at a rate above 28 percent. The Senate
bill has no capital gains provisions.
   LOW-INCOME: Both bills would increase the earned-income tax
credit, which benefits low-income families with children, as a way
of offsetting some of the increased excise taxes. The House plan
included an $11 billion, five-year expansion of the credit; the
Senate, $16.8 billion.
   MEDICARE TAXES: House would increase to $100,000 the maximum
annual wage to which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax applies. The tax
is withheld as part of the Social Security tax. The Senate would
raise the limit to $89,000. The Senate would require all state and
local government workers and their employers to pay the tax; the
House would continue exempting workers hired before 1986.
   MEDICARE PREMIUMS: House would raise the $28.60 monthly premium
for Medicare Part B insurance to $29.90 next year and $46.20 by
1995. Senate: $29.90 next year and $47 by 1995.
   MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE: House would raise to $100 through 1995 the
present $75 deductible, which beneficiaries must pay before
Medicare starts paying for doctor bills. Senate: $150 each year.
   SOCIAL SECURITY: Either would require all state and local
government workers not covered by a public retirement plan to pay
Social Security taxes.

   An effort to restrict the export of
potentially harmful pesticides may be the toughest issue remaining
as House and Senate conferees struggle to complete the 1990 farm
bill.
   Behind-the-scenes negotiations have been fierce as Senate
Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy seeks to halt the
export of pesticides that are either banned or unregistered in the
United States.
   Details also must be approved on a tentative agreement on $13
billion in agriculture budget cuts reached Friday night by the
conference committee.
   The cuts would be part of the five-year $500 billion deficit
reduction package being negotiated by Congress.
   Under the tentative plan, subsidized acreage would be reduced by
15 percent in each of the four years after the 1991 planting year.
Deficiency payments to farmers - the difference between market
price and the government-established target price - would be
averaged over 12 months instead of five, as currently figured.
   The farm bill sets policy on virtually every aspect of U.S.
agriculture.
   Leahy, D-Vt., who chairs the conference committee, has shaped a
bill praised by environmentalists for advances in agricultural
conservation.
   But his efforts to restrict pesticide exports brought fierce
resistance from the $5 billion-a-year U.S. pesticide industry.
   Leahy's plan, approved by the Senate, would allow chemical
companies to export only pesticides that are registered in the
United States or have a designated food tolerance level. Exceptions
would include pesticides sent abroad for research or to fight
famine or communicable disease.
   Chemical companies say the restrictions would cost them billions
of dollars in overseas business and force the closing of American
manufacturing operations, resulting in job losses.
   The National Agricultural Chemical Association contends that
many pesticides are unregistered in the United States because they
are not needed in this climate, not because they are dangerous to
human health.
   However, backers of Leahy's plan say U.S. fruit and vegetable
growers are at a competitive disadvantage because they cannot use
the same pesticides that are being sold by U.S. companies to
foreign farmers.
   Environmentalists say residue from some of those pesticides is
showing up in dangerous levels on imported food in U.S. grocery
stores.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., the ranking Republican on the Senate
Agriculture Committee, has proposed an amendment supported by the
chemical industry.
   His amendment requires exporters to give EPA information on
chemicals they send abroad, but it does not give EPA the authority
to stop pesticide exports.
   The Bush administration opposes language restricting pesticide
exports. But Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and
Environmental Protection Agency administrator William Reilly, in a
letter to Leahy, urged adoption of the Lugar amendment if exports
are to be addressed in the farm bill.
   Leahy contended the Lugar plan would ``gut tough legislation
passed by both the House and the Senate to stop the export of
pesticides that the Environmental Protection Agency considers
probable carcinogens and too dangerous for domestic farm use.''
   The House bill would be less strict than Leahy's plan. It would
allow the export of unregistered pesticides if the EPA says they
pass health and safety review, the Food and Drug Administration can
screen for them and if they are registered in one country that is a
member of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.
   OECD countries include many nations whose food safety standards
are less stringent than the United States.
   In their letter to Leahy, Yeutter and Reilly said, ``We have
proposed to prohibit the export of any pesticide which has been
suspended, canceled or denied registration for human health
reasons.''
   ``We have also advocated controls on the export of other
unregistered chemicals, which go a long way toward improving food
safety at home and protecting human health and the environment
abroad,'' the letter said.
   But Leahy said that if the Lugar amendment is adopted, only two
U.S.-made pesticides would be stopped from export - chlordane and
heptachlor, both manufactured by Felsicol of Memphis, Tenn. Both
have been banned from U.S. agricultural use since 1978 because of
extreme toxicity, but are sold overseas for termite control.

<HEAD>China Has Bumper Grain Harvest, But Will Keep Importing U.S.
Product</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has another bumper grain harvest and
will have tremendous problems of storage, transportation and
marketing, according to an Agriculture Department analyst.
   But Hunter Colby of the department's Economic Research Service
said China will continue to import U.S. grain, primarily wheat,
despite back-to-back record harvests.
   ``One reason is that U.S. grain is very high quality, and they
can use it to blend in with their somewhat-lower-quality grain,''
Colby said in a telephone interview.
   Reports from Beijing point to a total grain harvest of 422
million metric tons this year. Agriculture Vice Minister Chan
Yaobang said the grain crop would exceed the 1989 harvest of 407
million tons, the previous high.
   Colby, a China specialist for the USDA, said that while wheat
imports from the United States will continue, they probably will be
reduced because of the big domestic harvests.
   ``An interesting thing about this year is that they're having
the same problems the Soviets are having,'' he said. ``They can't
store it. There's so much grain that it's sitting outside, and they
lose a lot.''
   The Soviet Union, which suffers huge losses of grain after
harvesting because of poor storage and marketing facilities, also
is having a bumper grain harvest. The USDA last week estimated
total Soviet grain production this year at 235 million metric tons,
a near-record.
   Colby was asked to comment on other reports from Beijing that
Chinese leaders are cautiously planning a partial return to
collective farming in hopes of raising productivity.
   Land was distributed to individual farming households 10 years
ago as the commune system was dismantled. That allowed farmers to
sell some crops on the free market. Grain production and rural
incomes jumped sharply.
   But growth recently has stagnated, and plots worked by
individual farmers - an average of 1.5 acres - are too small for
efficient mechanization.
   Thus, according to the English-language China Daily, party and
government officials recently decided that ``conglomerates in
charge of supply, production and sales'' would be established to
hasten large-scale mechanization.
   No details were provided by Beijing. Colby said there has been
talk for several years of trying to introduce larger-scale farming
in some areas that could support it.
   But Colby said he was not prepared to interpret this as a move
back to collectivization of Chinese agriculture.
   Meanwhile, he said, the huge harvests of the last two years are
putting a lot of budgetary pressure on China's government, which
announced plans to raise its grain purchase price.
   Also, officials have said the state would buy the entire grain
harvest, a practice abandoned in the 1980s. Lately, the state
contracted with each farmer to buy part of his harvest, leaving him
to sell the remainder on the free market at potentially higher
prices.
   ``The government is talking about ensuring that all the grain is
to be purchased and at subsidized prices,'' Colby said. ``So, it's
going to cost ... and they've had terrible budget deficits the last
couple of years. This is just going to make it worse.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - An Agriculture Department scientist says
kenaf, a fast-growing plant that already has potential as a wood
pulp substitute, could also be a good livestock forage crop.
   Charles L. Webber III of the department's Agricultural Research
Service said kenaf, a bamboo-like relative of cotton and okra,
would be grown throughout the South and Southwest.
   A plant to produce newsprint from kenaf is under construction
near Raymondville, Texas.
   Webber said kenaf's value as a feed would give farmers another
good reason to grow it. For one thing, he said, kenaf is an annual,
which presents fewer problems than with crops such as alfalfa that
must be planted each year.
   ``And kenaf can be grown under a much wider range of conditions
than can alfalfa - all over the South and Southwest,'' he said.
``It can tolerate more acid and poorer soils than alfalfa as
well.''
   Webber, an agronomist who works at the USDA agency's South
Central Agricultural Research Laboratory in Lane, Okla., reported
on kenaf last week in Riverside, Calif., at an international
conference on industrial crops and products.
   Some of his remarks and findings also were released here by the
agency.
   Although kenaf can be used to make silage, Webber said its best
potential could be as a less-expensive supplement in alfalfa-based
pellet feeds.
   ``Some businessmen have told me they expect to produce
alfalfa-kenaf feed pellets that will have the high protein values
of normal alfalfa pellets but at about 75 percent of the price,''
he said.
   Kenaf reaches a peak as a feed crop in 90 days after planting,
according to Webber's research.
   ``Before 90 days, the yields are not that high,'' he said. ``But
there's no advantage after 90 days because the plant begins to get
woody.''
   Kenaf yields run as high as 3.1 tons per acre, dried weight, at
90 days of growth, with ``a minimal input of fertilizer and
pesticides,'' Webber said. ``With a 90-day harvest date, it may
even be possible for growers to get two cuttings a year.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Rye production has always been erratic in the
United States, but the latest Agriculture Department figures show
the crop has faded to a fraction of its former glory.
   As of Oct. 1, according to last week's crop report, rye
production this year has dropped to about 10.1 million bushels,
down 26 percent from 1989 output. That is a record low for the
crop, reflecting reduced plantings by farmers.
   South Dakota is the largest producer, with 1.87 million bushels
estimated this year, compared with 3.24 million in 1989. Georgia,
No. 2, produced 1.32 million bushels, down from 1.61 million last
year.
   Records show production has varied greatly over the years, with
a peak of nearly 57 million bushels in 1935. As recently as 1984,
rye output was about 32.5 million bushels.

   Who commands what has become a vexing
question as more countries commit units to the multinational force
confronting Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   ``The disparate allied armies ... in the Arabian desert must be
forged into a unified fighting force if they are to defeat Saddam
Hussein,'' said Michael Dockrill, who lectures in war studies at
King's College, London.
   Military analysts agree that the estimated 350,000 troops,
airmen and sailors from 21 countries cannot be an effective force
until a chain of command has been established with clearly defined
operational areas and functions.
   The U.S. and British air forces work closely together, but the
French, Canadians, Italians and Belgians also are deploying
aircraft.
   President Bush and allied leaders have met to discuss the
problem, as have the field generals. Bush said last month that, in
the event of war, ``the command structure will function very
smoothly.''
   At sea, operational zones have been established for the eight
Western navies involved in enforcing the U.N. embargo on trade with
Iraq.
   If war begins, wider cooperation will be essential on land as
well as at sea and in the air. Artillery fire zones and tank
movements will have to be coordinated, communications systems
integrated, air defense sectors assigned.
   Capt. Ton van Gurp, who commands the two Dutch frigates in the
Persian Gulf, complained in a recent interview with the daily De
Telegraaf of Amsterdam: ``The way it is right now, I don't even
know my assignment in time of war. ... We don't know what we're
supposed to be doing.
   ``We want to know ... who's going to be in charge here if war
breaks out, because it's getting more dangerous every day.''
   He said the lack of a unified command structure among the U.S.,
British, French, Italian, Canadian, Belgian and other ships could
leave them badly exposed. Van Gurp said he preferred a U.N.
command.
   Most countries involved agree that Iraq must be forced out of
Kuwait, which it seized on Aug. 2, but not necessarily on how it
should be done or who should do it.
   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the U.S. commander, dropped a broad
hint last month that the allies would have to do the job militarily
when their forces were ready.
   Saudi Arabia, sensitive to Moslem criticism for inviting the
Americans to protect the kingdom and Islam's holiest shrines, said
quickly that no attack could be launched from Saudi soil without
its approval.
   Three U.S. carrier battle groups are in the area, however, plus
warships armed with cruise missiles. B-52 bombers are based on the
Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia.
   Who will be in charge of what in combat, and the need for
overall coordination, are major questions.
   Military experts say a major risk is the possibility of one
allied national force mistakenly firing on another in battle. Some
units have weapons Iraq also uses, such as French-built Mirage jets
and Soviet-made T-72 tanks, making recognition difficult in combat.
   The gulf armada includes more than 70 ships from 12 countries,
scores of jet fighter squadrons from 10 countries and ground forces
from 14, speaking four languages.
   The Americans are by far the dominant force, with about 200,000
military personnel committed in the biggest U.S. overseas
deployment since Vietnam.
   A rapidly growing Arab-Islamic force from at least 11 nations is
led by Gen. Khalid bin Sultan, son of the Saudi defense minister,
and is not likely to put itself under U.S. command.
   Britain has said it will coordinate its forces with
Schwarzkopf's. Its 6,000-man 7th Armored Division, known as the
Desert Rats, has trained with U.S. troops in Germany during NATO
maneuvers.
   France, not part of NATO's military command structure, has made
clear it will operate autonomously and is deploying its 4,000-man
Rapid Action Force alongside Arab troops in the northeastern Saudi
desert.
   ``This situation is containable while the various forces in
Saudi Arabia remain on the defensive and each country occupies a
well-defined sector of the desert,'' Dockrill said in a recent
paper. ``But what will happen if war with Iraq eventually breaks
out and even goes in Iraq's favor? Previous examples do not augur
well for the outcome.''
   Noting large-scale multinational military operations in World
War II and Korea, he wrote: ``Unless coalition forces are tightly
controlled by one supreme commander, with a clear chain of command
as during the Normandy landings in 1944, setbacks can easily lead
to disaster if the enemy enjoys the benefits of good internal lines
of communication and a cohesive and efficient command structure.''

   A freshman congressman rushed to the House
floor the day after President Bush and congressional leaders
announced their now-moribund budget agreement.
   ``Let us vote this down and get to work on crafting a fair and
compassionate deficit-reduction package,'' he said, attacking the
Medicare cuts and working-class tax increases.
   He sounded like a Democrat, but he wasn't. He was Rep. Craig
James of Florida, president of the Republican freshman class in the
101st Congress.
   James illustrates an often-ignored fact in congressional
politics: The differences between the two political parties,
especially when it comes to domestic programs, are very small.
   In the two weeks since the budget deal, as the mid-term
elections neared:
   -Both parties in Congress have backed plans to ease increases in
Medicare fees.
   -Both parties have embraced cutting back or eliminating the
proposed increase in taxes on gasoline. Ditto for home heating oil.
   -Both parties have proposed cutting capital gains taxes.
   -Neither party has proposed any further specific cutbacks in
federal spending beyond those in the original agreement.
   ``I think there is a great blurring of the two parties in this
country. And I think that's regrettable,'' said Sen. Warren Rudman,
R-N.H. ``The American people do not know who to blame.''
   Lawmakers of both parties may not have solved the nation's
financial ills, but they have been working overtime on blame
avoidance.
   Democrats, the doves of Congress for the past two decades, don't
want to take the heat if something goes wrong in the Persian Gulf -
so they adopt a resolution pledging support for Bush's policies.
   Republicans, after campaigning for years for ``entitlement
reform,'' join with Democrats and run the other way when proposals
are made to trim the biggest entitlements, Social Security and
Medicare.
   Robert Billings, legislative director of the American
Conservative Union, said his group has noticed a trend toward the
center from both the left and the right in Congress.
   ``On fiscal issues, that's where it hurts us the most,'' he
said, lamenting the weakening GOP support for spending cuts and no
new taxes.
   Ron Zucker of the Americans for Democratic Action, a liberal
group that also monitors congressional voting, said that on social
issues the differences remain pronounced - maybe even more
polarized.
   But on the budget, ``you are going to get some weird
flip-flops,'' he said.
   Even the tax issue - one where the differences between the two
parties should be easy to discern - can get muddy.
   Democrats don't want to talk about raising taxes, though most
believe it necessary. ``We have to change the debate from taxes to
who gets taxed and the fairness of it,'' said House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   And Republicans no longer want to claim that giving tax breaks
to the rich is the key to economic growth for all. ``We have never
... been a party that was sympathetic to the higher incomes,'' said
Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla.
   Of course, with elections just four weeks away, the two parties
need positions to run on - the ``us vs. them'' kind of stuff.
   So House Democrats seized on the tax portion of the budget -
agreed upon by their own leaders - and declared it unfair. To
exploit what they see as a political advantage, they created a
soak-the-rich plan designed to boost middle-class voter appeal in
uncertain times.
   In a rare phenomenon, Republicans are more divided than the
Democrats. But they appear to be falling back on a stance of
opposing any new taxes, George Bush or not. If that prevents them
from offering their own deficit-reduction proposal, so be it, but
it makes for good campaign stuff.
   Both party positions appear more aimed at the voters than at
accomplishing anything. Regardless of the final outcome, they'll
let the incumbents claim at home that they fought the good fight.
   So what about the challengers, the ones voters could turn to if
they get tired of all this?
   Even there, it's hard to see the difference between the two
parties. The most popular theme in both Republican and Democratic
campaign ads is asking voters to ``throw the rascals out.''

   Although Iraq has large conventional arms
stockpiles, it will quickly run out of parts for its high-tech
weaponry if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, military analysts
believe.
   One focus of Saddam Hussein's propaganda war against the
U.S.-led multinational force has been the sophistication of his
weapons systems.
   Last week, he claimed Iraq had developed a new missile called
the al-Hijara, or Stone, with a range of hundreds of miles.
   Also, Iraq is reported preparing to field what is known as a
fuel-air explosive bomb with blast potential approaching that of a
nuclear weapon.
   A British newspaper, Independent on Sunday, reported that Libya
was negotiating on Baghdad's behalf with Chilean arms manufacturer
Industrias Cardoen to buy such bombs. They are known as ``the poor
man's nuclear bomb.''
   Other high-tech weaponry in the Iraqi arsenal include its
domestically built al-Hussein and al-Abbas missiles, as well as its
own version of the Airborne Warning and Control Systems, or AWACS,
plane.
   But weapons experts make the point that the more sophisticated
weaponry is, the more prone it is to break down.
   Such weaponry also relies heavily on spare parts.
   Iraq has created a fairly commprehensive weapons industry, but
it relies heavily on imported components, including parts for its
missile guidance systems.
   ``They'll probably use up a lot of the sophisticated and
semi-sophisticated stuff pretty fast,'' said Bernard Trainor, a
retired U.S. Marine general.
   ``That's one of the concerns of the U.S. buildup right now,''
said Trainor, who heads the National Security Program at Harvard
University's Kennedy School of Government. ``We have to build
enormous stocks of both conventional weapons and sophisticated
weapons.''
   Saddam has ``got to do the same thing and that poses great
problems for him because he doesn't have ... the spare parts to
keep the sophisticated weapons in action,'' he said.
   Not only does Iraq build its own missiles. It also makes its own
version of the advanced Soviet T-72 tank - called the Lion of
Babylon - and a 210mm cannon with a range of 40 miles.
   That is the longest range of any artillery piece in production.
   Most Iraqi weaponry is of either Soviet design or manufacture.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will be asking Soviet
officials for intelligence data on them when he visits Moscow this
week, a senior Defense Department official said in Washington on
Thursday.
   Moscow said last month that it was willing to share such
information.
   Michael Dewar, a military analyst with London's International
Institute for Strategic Studies, said war with Iraq would not be a
walkover.
   He predicted that the U.S.-led multinational force would launch
``a massive, cataclysmic, sudden shock type of action, lasting a
matter of days, perhaps a week.''
   In that scenario, shortages would not be a factor, Dewar said.
   Paul Rogers, a defense analyst in the Department of Peace
Studies at the University of Bradford in England, also said he did
not believe shortages would be an issue, but disagreed about how
long a war would last.
   ``I think it will be extremely bitter, extremely intensive early
on, but I think there's a real risk of it being drawn out into a
protracted conflict,'' he said.
   ``We're talking about a drawn-out land war where they have
considerable advantages in their combat engineering skills. They
have such large numbers of artillery and tanks that if things break
down they'll just be thrown away,'' Rogers said.
   Iraq has an estimated 5,500 tanks and 7,500 artillery pieces and
air defense guns.
   Rogers said the most critical shortages are likely to develop in
Saddam's air force, given its vulnerability to Western missile
strikes and bombing as well as the hundreds of advanced U.S.,
British and French jet fighters arrayed against it.
   He said Iraq might be able to get spare parts and replacement
planes from Libya and Jordan, two Arab nations that have remained
friendly to Saddam.

<HEAD>It's Neighbor vs. Neighbor in the Battle to Burn Leaves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The autumn tradition of burning leaves has pitted
neighbor against neighbor as overflowing landfills force more
people to resort to the smoky practice that inflames clean-air
advocates and asthma sufferers.
   Heated battles are taking place in states like Illinois and
Pennsylvania, where bans on the dumping of yard waste in landfills
recently were enacted.
   Residents who consider the smell of burning leaves fall's
perfume and object to the cost and hassle of other disposal methods
are asserting their right to light up.
   Sufferers of allergies, asthma or other lung ailments are
demanding to breathe air free of smoke that environmentalists and
health officials say can be dangerous.
   ``It's always amazing to me how intensely people feel about this
issue,'' said Joseph Minott, executive director of the Delaware
Valley Clean Air Council in Philadelphia. ``It's part of American
culture.''
   A number of states ban leaf burning in heavily populated areas,
primarily because of concerns about the spread of fire, said Dave
Ryan of the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA discourages
leaf burning but doesn't consider it a major threat to air quality,
Ryan said.
   In rural areas, some communities ban the practice or restrict
when it can take place.
   But with 11 states enacting bans against dumping leaves or other
yard waste in landfills, local officials are under pressure to
loosen restrictions on leaf burning.
   Residents in some Illinois towns face charges of up to $1.70 a
bag to get rid of their leaves.
   ``It's a real Catch 22,'' said Hal Englund, editor of the
Journal of Air and Waste Management in Pittsburgh. ``Many
communities banned burning to protect their air, but now they're
worried about saving their landfills. So now they've got to rethink
their burning ordinances.''
   Environmentalists say the solution lies in recycling and
composting, a ``foreign concept to most people,'' said Jack Darin,
a field representative for the Sierra Club of Illinois.
   ``They're used to carting it to the curb rather than piling it
in the back yard,'' he said.
   In Warmington, Pa., local officials bowed to public pressure and
withdrew a proposed leaf-burning ban.
   ``They allow these people to burn the American flag,'' said town
resident Anthony Kieper, 50. ``If they're going to start telling
people they can't burn leaves, they're going to start telling
people they can't have a barbecue outside.''
   Residents opposed to leaf burning are just as vehement.
   Julie Reiner of Edwardsville, Ill., an asthma sufferer, went so
far as to rent a billboard to let her neighbors know that their
wayward smoke makes her choke.
   ``Burning leaves hurts those with lung disease. Please don't
burn,'' the billboard says.
   Leaf smoke can make breathing extremely difficult for sufferers
of asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis and allergies, said Maggie
Robbins of the Chicago Lung Association. Some sufferers of those
ailments must be hospitalized, she said.
   ``You're adding another insult to their lungs,'' she said. ``You
can literally keep these people locked inside their houses when you
burn leaves. They can't go in their back yards, they can't even
open their windows.''
   Robbins and some environmentalists say burning leaves emit seven
kinds of carcinogens.
   ``It's not to say that burning leaves is going to kill you, but
it's another form of air pollution that's not good for you,'' she
said. ``And it's not just your problem. Chances are your smoke is
going down the street to your neighbors.''

   The dollar dropped sharply against the Japanese yen
in Tokyo Monday. The yen's strength helped push stock prices
higher.
   The dollar ended the day at 128.15 yen, down 1.15 yen from
Friday's 129.30-yen finish. The U.S. currency opened at 128.55 yen
and ranged between 127.90 yen and 128.72 yen.
   The dollar's close was its lowest since March 6, 1989, when it
ended trading at 127.63 yen.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average surged
719.14 points, or 3.21 percent, closing at 23,109.20. The index
lost 195.47 points on Friday.
   Following a decline in the Sydney market, which opens earlier
than Tokyo, the dollar continued to sink in Tokyo due to weakening
market enthusiasm, dealers said.
   ``Investors are currently trying to break the 128-yen level and
push the dollar lower,'' said a Mitsubishi Bank dealer. ``The
dollar's downtrend has become quite strong.''
   Traders sold more dollars after the U.S. currency broke the
resistance point of 129 yen, a Chemical Bank dealer said.
   ``Japanese investors have renewed pessimism about the dollar and
are selling quite aggressively,'' she said.
   But dealers said any further decline would take some time
because of a strong incentive to cover short, or oversold, dollar
positions.
   On the stock exchange, the Nikkei advanced as market players
were reassured by the rising yen and government bond prices,
traders said.

<TEXT>
   Presidents Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the
Soviet Union and Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia were the
front-runners in speculation about today's awarding of the 1990
Nobel Peace Prize.
   If it were up to the Norwegian news media, they would be joint
recipients. They were the most prominent names among about 10
candidates local Nobel watchers believe would make likely choices
for the prize, awarded to someone who has worked for peace,
championed liberty and helped the downtrodden or promoted
brotherhood.
   But the name of the winner is a closely guarded secret, and the
media are often wrong. The Nobel Committee considered 100
nominations this year.
   The prize has been withheld 19 times since it was first awarded
in 1901.
   Another difficulty in guessing the winner of this year's
$700,000 prize is that the Nobel Committee has been changing the
geographic focus of the award.
   ``The changing has been very important: to no longer look just
to the Western world but to the whole world,'' Gidske Anderson,
leader of the five-member committee, said in an interview last
week.
   She said she found the media speculation amusing.
   Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite, established the
award in his 1896 will.
   He said it should go to ``the person who shall have done the
most or the best work for fraternity between peoples, for the
abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and
promotion of peace congresses.''
   The awards committee has taken some liberty in interpreting
Nobel's intention.
   It has awarded the prize 16 times to organizations or agencies.
It has awarded it to more than one person 16 times, and it has
recognized and encouraged work that has not yet borne fruit in the
fields of peace and human rights.
   Many of the pro-democracy activists and reformers in Eastern
Europe who were mentioned last year as possible winners may have a
better chance now.
   Havel once was a jailed dissident. Now he is Czechoslovakia's
president.
   Gorbachev was touted last year as a likely candidate, along with
former President Reagan, for their disarmament efforts.
   Although both were nominated again, news media speculation in
Norway and Sweden has focused on Gorbachev's encouragement of
democratic reforms in Eastern Europe.
   Another perennial candidate is Nelson Mandela.
   When the African National Congress leader was nominated for this
year's prize, he was still in prison, serving his 27th year for
plotting to overthrow the white minority government of South
Africa.
   Now he is free, preparing to negotiate with the government on an
end to apartheid amid the worst fighting among black South Africans
in decades.
   Mandela would be the second ANC leader to receive the award.
Then ANC President Albert Luthuli won the 1960 prize.
   Other frequently mentioned candidates were Chai Ling, one of the
Chinese pro-democracy activists; Pope John Paul II; German Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Burmese opposition leader Aung
San Suu Kyi.
   Nobel endowed four other prizes, in medicine, physics, chemistry
and literature, which are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, established by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1968, will be awarded Tuesday.
   The Nobel physics and chemistry prizes are to be announced
Wednesday.
   Last week, Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz won the
literature prize. Two American doctors, Joseph E. Murray and E.
Donnall Thomas, won the medicine prize for pioneering organ and
bone marrow transplants.
   The prizes are presented Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's
death.

   Hundreds of cadets in dress-gray uniform
joined Bob Dylan in singing the anti-war anthem ``Blowin' in the
Wind'' during a concert at the U.S. Military Academy that blew the
minds of past and present cadets.
   Dylan, who first recorded the song nearly three decades ago,
played to about 4,000 people Saturday night, several hundred of
them cadets.
   Cadets pumped their arms, picked on imaginary guitars and danced
in the aisles. It was Dylan's first appearance at West Point.
   ``I've been here for four years and this is the best time I've
ever had,'' said senior Steven Cavioli Jr. ``To get cadets to
unleash is really something and Bob Dylan did it tonight. We're not
politically agreeing with Bob Dylan. We're just shifting all that
stuff aside and enjoying his music.''
   Dylan saw nothing out of the ordinary in playing at the military
academy, said spokesman Elliott Mintz.
   ``The nature of the venue is not of great importance to Bob.
He's just Bob,'' Mintz said.
   Dylan fans were in disbelief at the concert's setting, which
they described as ``the belly of the beast.''
   Lucian Truscott IV, a West Point graduate whose novel ``Dress
Gray'' is a scathing portrait of cadet life, noted that the academy
prepares its cadets ``so when you're 45 or 50, you can be the
national security adviser.''
   ``The idea that they'd introduce Bob Dylan into that is
amazing,'' he said.

   A foul odor suspected of coming from a sewage
line sickened at least 113 guests at two casinos, authorities said.
   The guests, whose complaints included nausea, shortness of
breath and scratchy throats, were released after hospital tests
found no toxic substances in their blood, said Bob Leinbach of the
Clark County Fire Department.
   ``It could be the sewers. It could be the grease trap. We're
looking at everything,'' he said. A grease trap is a filter in a
sewage line.
   The fumes apparently were sucked through the ventilation system
into the Excalibur Hotel and Casino and the Tropicana Resort and
Casino, a half-mile apart, Leinbach said. Guests began complaining
of illness Sunday night.
   Neither hotel was evacuated and all operations continued
normally, Leinbach said.
   The complaints diminished after the ventilation systems were
purged, he said.

   Iran and Iraq have resumed diplomatic relations after a decade
of hostility, and a Soviet news agency says Saddam Hussein has
indicated a willingness to withdraw from Kuwait if he is allowed to
keep some territory.
   The renewed ties with Iran could help Iraq circumvent the
U.N.-ordered embargo on trade with Baghdad, prolonging the desert
stalemate and dampening the resolve of members of the international
alliance arrayed against it.
   Also on Sunday, a special flight arrived in Baghdad to take home
more than 100 Soviet military advisers and oil workers, diplomats
said from the Iraqi capital.
   Prior to its invasion of Kuwait, Baghdad relied on Moscow for
the bulk of its advanced weaponry. Soviet diplomats said the 180
advisers who remain in Iraq could leave when their contracts expire
unless they opt to depart sooner.
   Iraq threatened last week to restrict the travel of Soviet
military advisers if their government disclosed any of its military
secrets to the United States.
   In other developments:
   -In London, the Independent on Sunday newspaper reported that
Libya was negotiating for Iraq to purchase a highly explosive bomb
from a Chilean arms manufacturer. A company official confirmed the
report. The ``fuel air explosives'' weapon has been described as
``the poor man's nuclear bomb.''
   -Kuwaiti opposition figures meeting in Jiddah, Saudia Arabia,
with their government-in-exile and said they wanted guarantees of
democratic reform in a future liberated Kuwait. Kuwaiti activists
were demanding a Western-style parliament when Iraq invaded.
   -Newspapers in Cairo reported that police had arrested dozens of
Arabs and Egyptian Moslem extremists in their investigation of the
assassination of Parliament Speaker Rifaat el-Mahgoub on Friday.
They said they included at least 25 Palestinians and Iraqis.
   Egypt has been a key Arab participant in the multinational
military force standing up to Saddam in the Persian Gulf, but Iraq
denied any involvement in the killing of el-Mahgoub, his driver and
four security men.
   Iran and Iraq have reopened embassies in each other's capitals,
resuming diplomatic relations after a decade of hostility, Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported Sunday.
   The Iraqi charge d'affaires took up his post Sunday and his
Iranian counterpart was to leave for Baghdad shortly, the agency
said.
   The exchange comes two years after a U.N.-brokered cease-fire
halted hostilities in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which by
conservative estimates resulted in more than a million casualties.
   Tehran has officially condemned Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait and called for his withdrawal. But it has also condemned the
buildup of Western forces in Saudi Arabia since the invasion.
   Saddam is believed to be seeking Iranian help in circumventing
the U.N. embargo imposed to force him out of Kuwait. Food shipments
are reported to have reached Iraq from Iran across the countries'
730-mile border. Some sources say Iran has agreed to trade refined
oil for food.
   A Soviet news agency reported Sunday that Saddam indicated to a
visiting Soviet official last week that he might be willing to
remove his troops from Kuwait if he is allowed to keep certain real
estate.
   The agency named the lands as the Kuwaiti section of the
Rumaillah oilfield, which straddles the Kuwaiti-Iraq border, and
Warba and Bubiyan islands, near the Iraqi border and just off the
Kuwaiti coast in the gulf.
   An editor at the official Iraqi News Agency denied Sunday that
Iraq had made any such offer.
   The Soviet government-run Novosti Press Agency, in a dispatch
published Sunday by the labor newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna, said
Saddam made the comments in talks with Yevgeny Primakov, a top
Kremlin aide.
   Saddam claimed when he invaded Kuwait that the emirate was
stealing oil that belonged to Baghdad - through vigorous
exploitation of the Rumaillah field - and that Kuwait's monarchy
was illegitimate.
   He was also known before the invasion to have his sights on
Warba and Bubiyan, which would provide Iraq with key sea links.
   Saddam has also linked a gulf settlement to Israeli withdrawal
from territories claimed by the Palestinians.
   PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said Sunday that Saddam was showing a
``certain flexibility'' regarding his claims to Kuwait and urged
all parties in the gulf crisis to follow suit.
   Arafat spoke at a news conference in Tunis after visiting
Bagdhad. He did not elaborate.

   Dwight D. Eisenhower was lauded on the
100th anniversary of his birth as the man who laid the foundation
for the social and political changes that swept Europe in the past
year.
   ``It is most fitting that the centennial of Ike's birth falls
during this particular year,'' former President Ford said Sunday.
``For 1990 has seen the realization of Ike's most cherished dreams
and the fruition of his finest work.''
   Ford was among some 1,500 people who paid tribute to the World
War II commander and 34th president in ceremonies at Gettysburg
College, near where he retired with his wife, Mamie, after his two
terms in office. He died in 1969.
   ``How much we all wish that Ike could have witnessed the events
of the past year: human achievement of peace, justice and freedom
in Europe, for which he laid the foundation in World War II and
during his presidency,'' Ford said.
   As supreme allied commander in Europe in the early '50s,
Eisenhower set up NATO defense forces. During his presidency he
committed the United States to a strong anti-communist stance. He
sought to ease Cold War tensions, but a summit with Nikita
Khrushchev in 1960 broke off in a dispute over spy flights over the
Soviet Union.
   In another birthday observance Sunday, about 30,000 people
crowded Ike's hometown of Abilene, Kan. Hundreds of World War II
veterans showed up.
   Though he was born in Denison, Texas, Eisenhower spent most of
his childhood in Abilene and called it home.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
represented President Bush in Abilene. He said Eisenhower would
have approved the huge military buildup in the Middle East aimed at
rolling back Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The Gettysburg ceremonies ended a five-day symposium by
historians and political scientists on the Eisenhower presidency.
   Eisenhower's grandson, David, was at Gettysburg with his wife,
Julie Nixon Eisenhower, who brought greetings from her father,
former President Nixon.
   ``He came from the heart of America and he touched the hearts of
the world,'' wrote Nixon, Eisenhower's vice president.
   In another letter read at the ceremony, former President Carter
said Eisenhower was brilliant in war and in peace: ``For him,
national defense was more than the manufacturing of weapons.''
   Ford and Bob Hope unveiled a commemorative plaque on campus.
Hope, after poking fun at recent Republican presidents, concluded:
``Americans not only liked Ike. They loved him.''

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore lashed
out at the media today, blaming television for the bloody crackdown
on China's pro-democracy movement and the Western press for the
fluctuations in Hong Kong's stock exchange.
   Lee also defended his country's rigid restrictions on foreign
media, accusing newspapers such as the Asian Wall Street Journal,
of interfering in Singapore's domestic politics.
   In a related development, Dow Jones &amp; Co., the majority owners
of Asian Wall Street Journal, announced that it was halting
circulation of the newspaper in Singapore because of new
restrictions on the foreign press.
   Lee made his comments in a speech before the Commonwealth Press
Union, which comprises more than 500 newspapers, news agencies and
periodicals in 30 countries of the British Commonwealth.
   He said China's students, who took to the streets by the
hundreds of thousands in the spring of 1989, were seduced by
television into believing they could change China.
   ``I believe it is this contextless television experience that
led to the tragedy of Tiananmen on June 4,'' he said.
   On that day, soldiers marched on Beijing and crushed the
movement by driving thousands of students from Tiananmen Square.
Hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed.
   Lee said students in China for years had watched Chinese news
reports on demonstrations in the Philippines and student protests
in South Korea.
   ``China's students forgot that China was a very different
country from either the Philippines or South Korea, two countries
with close links to the United States where the media and Congress
wield immense influence,'' he said.
   Lee also criticized the students for not compromising with
China's hard-line leaders.
   ``If they had been patient and circumspect, they could have
contributed over 10 years to the gradual opening up of the system,
which had already started,'' he said.
   Lee was to travel to Beijing on Tuesday, his fifth visit since
1976. China and Singapore normalized relations in August.
   In his speech, Lee also blasted the foreign press in Hong Kong
for trying ``to foist Western values'' on the British colony.
   He blamed the foreign press for causing large drops on Hong
Kong's stock market, which was rocked by the Tiananmen killings.
   ``Much of the gyrations ... could have been lessened if the
Western press based in Hong Kong had not crusaded for their vision
of democracy in Hong Kong,'' he said.
   Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997 and many in the
territory fear that Beijing will not keep its promise to maintain
the colony's freewheeling political and economic system for 50
years following the takeover.
   Lee did not define what he meant by foreign press, but it
appeared he was referring to Dow Jones' Asian Wall Street Journal
and its Far Eastern Economic Review. The two English-language
publications have been the sharpest critics in the territory of
both China and Britain in the run-up to 1997.
   The 67-year-old prime minister has had a running battle with
both publications and has often accused them of interfering in
Singapore's internal affairs.
   Lee said the Journal's move to stop circulating Asian Wall
Street Journal in Singapore was of little consequence. Singapore
already restricts the Journal's circulation to 400 copies a day.
   One of Singapore's new press restrictions requires foreign
publications to post a security deposit to pay for legal fees and
fines should the government take them to court.

   The dollar was stable early today and trading was
light in the absence of any important U.S. economic indicators
scheduled for the day.
   Gold prices fell. Dealers said trading in the U.S. currency was
expected to remain light throughout the day.
   They said the market's prevailing mood remained bearish on the
dollar because of the gloomy outlook for the U.S. economy, the
continuing uncertainty over the terms of the budget-deficit
reduction pact and notions that the U.S. Federal Reserve will ease
its monetary policy a bit to stimulate growth.
   ``The fundamentals still look bad, said a dealer with a large
European bank in Frankfurt. ``At the moment it's still quiet, but I
expect that later on, when the U.S. markets open, there will be a
downward pressure on the dollar.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.15 yen to a closing 128.83 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 128.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with Friday:
   -1.5223 German marks, up from 1.5175
   -1.2849 Swiss francs, up from 1.2780
   -5.1010 French francs, up from 5.0555
   -1.7160 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7110
   -1,141.25 Italian lire, up from 1,137.25
   -1.1525 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1470
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9567, compared
with $1.9740 Friday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$383.45 per ounce at midmorning, from $388.15 bid per ounce Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $383.75, down from $388.00 Friday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.68 to close at a bid
$385.08.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.27 a troy ounce,
from Friday's $4.34.

   The government of President Elias Hrawi
moved today to reunify Beirut by dismantling the Green Line that
has long split the Lebanese capital into Moslem and Christian
sectors.
   The army command of Gen. Emile Lahoud ordered military police to
stop lawlessness by some leftist and Moslem militias that moved
into the enclave of defeated Gen. Michel Aoun in the Christian
heartland outside the city.
   Syrian and Lebanese troops crushed Aoun's 11-month mutiny in an
air-and-ground assault Saturday that left 160 people dead and more
than 800 wounded. Aoun took refuge in the French Embassy.
   Aoun, 55, remained in the French Embassy today while Lebanon and
France argued over French efforts to move him to exile in France.
France has been the traditional protector of Lebanon's Christians.
   Hrawi's government said it would not allow Aoun's departure
until he faces charges including the theft of $75 million from the
state treasury.
   Lebanese army engineering units started dismantling mines from
earth mounds along the five-mile Green Line, which stretches from
Beirut Port to the foothills of the central mountains in the
southeast.
   The Green Line has divided Beirut into Moslem and Christian
sectors since the outbreak of the civil war 15 years ago.
   It also was dismantled in the early days of former President
Amin Gemayel's term in office, which started in September 1982, and
the capital was reunited for 16 months.
   However, Moslem and leftist gunmen regained their positions
along the same line when they ousted Gemayel's Christian-led army
from Beirut's Moslem sector in a bloody confrontation in February
1984.
   A police spokesman said bulldozers would remove earth mounds and
other barricades along the Green Line after the army eliminated the
mines.
   The line is expected to be totally dismantled in a week or so,
the police spokesman said.
   Dismantling it would be the first step by the government to
achieve the creation of a militia-free ``greater Beirut.''
   The target is an area extending 22 miles along the Mediterranean
coast from the Dog River in the north to the Damour River in the
south and covering the capital's immediate suburbs at the foothills
of the central mountain range in the east.
   Security sources said Syrian soldiers were questioning at least
six of Aoun's top lieutenants at the Lebanese Defense Ministry,
which had been controlled by Aoun before Saturday.
   Lahoud's command said in a communique that a military police
battalion had been ordered to ``enforce law and order'' in the
80-square-mile enclave in the Christian heartland.
   Several Christian leaders complained that leftist and Moslem
militias moved in behind the Syrian troops and were involved in
atrocities against the population.
   The police spokesman said leftist militiamen allied with Syria
and Shiite gunmen from the pro-Iranian Hezbollah were involved in
``kidnapping, looting and other atrocities.''
   Aoun's fall tightened Syria's hold on Lebanon, which the Syrians
consider their strategic backyard. Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon, sent 40,000 troops into the country under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate.
   The capital has been divided into Christian and Moslem sectors
since outbreak of the civil war in 1975.
   Aoun had rejected an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end the
war and refused to recognize Hrawi as head of state, calling him a
Syrian puppet. The peace plan provides for the traditionally
dominant Christians to share power with the Moslem majority.

   The dollar dived against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
today as investors became more pessimistic about the U.S. economy,
traders said.
   The dollar closed at 128.15 yen, down 1.15 yen from Friday's
close of 129.30 yen. It opened at 128.55 yen and ranged between
127.95 and 128.72.
   The dollar's closing was its lowest since 127.63 yen on March 6,
1989.
   ``The dollar has become less attractive because of growing
pessimism over the U.S. economic performance,'' said a Mitsubishi
Bank dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Early dollar-selling in Tokyo followed the U.S. currency's
decline in the Sydney market, which opens earlier than Tokyo's,
dealers said.
   ``First the yen soared against the Australian dollar in early
trading, triggered by the Australian central bank's announcement it
would lower interest rates,'' said Mamoru Tabata, a dealer with the
Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   ``The (U.S.) dolla  will quickly fall further once it breaks the
128-yen line, which is a resistance point,'' Tabata added.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news conference,
however, that the market sees little possibility of the dollar
plunging. He said the U.S. currency's recent sharp drop has been
too fast.
   Mieno also said there had been unavoidable stock price declines
reflecting a correction of the ``bubble effect'' of asset prices.
The Tokyo market's leading index has declined this year from a
record high exceeding 38,900 points at the end of 1989.
   But on the stock exchange today, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock
Average surged 719.04 points, or 3.21 percent, closing at
23,109.20. The index fell 195.47 points Friday.
   Traders said the yen's strength, stability in bond prices and
relative calm in the Persian Gulf region contributed to today's
surge in the Nikkei.
   They said, however, that trading was thin, with many investors
sitting on the sidelines. First section volume was estimated at 350
million shares, up slightly from last Friday's 320 million.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
government bonds was 83.40 points at 5 p.m., up from Friday's
83.35-point close. Their yield stood at 8.055 percent, down from
8.065 percent.

   Prosecutors have taken the rare
step of charging a motorist with manslaughter in the death of his
6-year-old son in a car crash because the boy wasn't wearing a seat
belt.
   ``The point is to be made to all parents that it is your
responsibility that your child is seat belted in - no matter how
much they fight, kick, scream,'' said Pamela Davis-Springer, deputy
district attorney.
   Walter G. Sylvia Jr., 49, of Acton was driving his son, Michael,
to school Aug. 8 when he lost control of the car on a winding road,
authorities said. The car flipped twice, and the boy was thrown
out. He died an hour later.
   Authorities said that Sylvia was going too fast and that a seat
belt would have saved the boy's life. Under state law, children
must be in a safety seat or wear a seat belt.
   Sylvia faces arraignment Thursday. He could get up to a year in
jail if convicted. He was released on his own recognizance.
   ``I don't understand why they are doing this to me,'' he said.
``I don't know what they hope to accomplish.''
   Sylvia told officers that about 25 minutes into the trip,
Michael unbuckled his seat belt to push back his seat and cover
himself with a blanket. At that moment, Sylvia said, he lost
control of his car.
   Michael's death came weeks after Sylvia won a four-year battle
for custody of the boy.
   ``It's a difficult position to be in of charging a parent with
the death of their child,'' Davis-Springer said. ``I can agree with
the emotional angle, but you have to overcome that and determine if
the parent is criminally liable.''

   Since he came to power five years ago, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has presided over sweeping changes in his country and the
world that perhaps even he could not have predicted.
   He sounded a clarion call for reducing global tension and led
the way toward treaties slashing conventional and nuclear forces.
He withdrew Soviet troops from Afghanistan, freed the Soviet press
and created more powerful legislative bodies in the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev won the Nobel Peace Prize today for the profound
changes he has encouraged.
   But did he envision that his reforms would also lead to the rout
of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and demands for at least
some degree of independence by all 15 Soviet republics?
   Did he realize that his halting steps toward economic reform
would create near chaos in which the Soviet people would enter the
winter of 1990-91 facing shortages of such staples as bread,
potatoes and gasoline?
   ``Was the turnaround begun in April 1985 warranted?'' Gorbachev
himself asked in a keynote address opening the 28th Congress of the
Soviet Communist Party on July 2.
   The party, under his leadership, he said, must ``bear direct
responsibility for the worsening of the situation on the consumer
market, which has complicated the entire situation in the
country.''
   In that speech, his most recent ``state of the union'' address,
he admitted successes and failures, implicitly acknowledging that
although his popularity remains high outside the Soviet Union, he
faces increasing trouble maintaining the support of his people.
   Despite unrest, Gorbachev's grip on power appears firm. This
year, he was elected to a five-year term in the newly strengthened
post of president, and in July he was resoundingly re-elected to
head the Communist Party.
   The course of his reforms, which he has dubbed ``perestroika,''
has appeared to zig-zag at times, but in the political sphere at
least the progress has been relentless.
   At a landmark Communist Party conference in 1988, Gorbachev
allowed senior party leaders to come under unprecedented public
criticism, spurring public debate over key issues.
   In March 1990, the Soviet Union held the most democratic
elections in its history, and many Communist Party candidates were
defeated in balloting for the newly created Congress of People's
Deputies.
   The nation sat riveted to television coverage of the congress,
as deputies debated the future of the country, then elected a
president - Gorbachev - and a 542-member Supreme Soviet
legislature.
   Early this year, the country crossed another threshold, erasing
from the constitution the phrase guaranteeing the Communist Party
monopoly on power.
   But Gorbachev has hesitated on moving his country from central
economic planning to a market-based system.
   Now there is economic confusion in which farmers and factories
are not making required deliveries to state stores.
   ``Today, the Soviet people will no longer put up with what they
uncomplainingly endured in the past,'' Gorbachev said in his July
speech.
   ``After April 1985, we told the people the truth, rejected false
conceit, and admitted that we were in fact unable to provide them
with a fitting life.''
   Historians are asking how a leader such as Gorbachev could have
risen to power through the ranks of the traditionalist Communist
Party.
   One key is that Gorbachev's early political consciousness was
formed shortly after Stalin's 1953 death. Nikita Khrushchev,
Stalin's successor, accelerated the process of de-Stalinization in
1956 with a ``secret speech'' at the 20th Party Congress that
affected an entire generation.
   Khrushchev was ousted in 1964 and replaced by Leonid I.
Brezhnev, who reversed many of the reforms and is now blamed by
Gorbachev for what is called the period of stagnation.
   Gorbachev and others of his mindset laid low for decades, and
there is little in his biography hinting at the type of reformer he
has become.
   He was born in 1931 in the village of Privolnoye, in the
Stavropol region on the northern flank of the Caucasus Mountains in
the Russian republic. His speech still reflects the soft ``g's'' of
what in Russia is considered a southern accent.
   One of his grandfathers was arrested during Stalin's forced
collectivization of agriculture in 1929-32, he has told
interviewers, and the experience apparently left its mark.
   Gorbachev enrolled in Moscow State University as a law student
in 1950. Two years later he became a full member of the Communist
Party and was active in the Komsomol, the party's youth
organization.
   While in Moscow, he met his future wife, Raisa Maximovna
Titorenko, also from Stavropol.
   Gorbachev returned to Stavropol in 1955 as a Komsomol activist,
rising to Komsomol first secretary in the region in 1960.
   A year later, he was appointed Communist Party first secretary
in the city of Stavropol, and in 1966 was elevated to full
membership in the national Communist Party Central Committee.
   As party leader in Stavropol, Gorbachev became acquainted with
top party leaders visiting the region's resorts. He is said to have
particularly impressed Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin ideologist, and
Yuri Andropov, head of the KGB.
   Gorbachev's big career leap came in 1978, when he was moved to
Moscow and appointed Central Committee secretary in charge of
agriculture. In 1979, he was named a candidate, or non-voting,
member of the ruling Politburo headed by Brezhnev, and became a
full member a year later.
   Gorbachev's future looked bright when Andropov succeeded
Brezhnev as party leader in late 1982, but his mentor died in arly
1984 and was succeeded by the traditionalist Konstantin U.
Chernenko, a foe.
   The ailing Chernenko sought to diminish Gorbachev's chances of
succeeding him, but died just more than a year after taking office.
Gorbachev succeeded him on March 11, 1985.

   Maybe there was something amiss in the hiss.
   Maybe it was viperous vibes.
   Whatever the serpentine signal he received, Tom Robertson Jr.
deemed things were not as they ssssssssseemed.
   Robertson, 36, a self-taught snake expert and former zoo
employee, walked into a pet store on New York City's Upper West
Side about a week ago to buy some fish food.
   When he glanced at a tank that supposedly held harmless garter
snakes, he recognized similar-looking, Asian water snakes known as
Redneck Keelbacks. The snake's bite, in rare instances, can be
fatal.
   ``I told a guy in the store,'' said Robertson. ``He said he knew
they weren't poisonous. I told him I could bring them some proof;
he got real arrogant. I brought back a book, but they still didn't
believe me. ... I called the police, the ASPCA, Fish and Wildlife -
I called a lot of places, trying to find out what to do.''
   Finally, someone at the city Health Department took him
seriously.
   The department's inspectors called a New York University
biologist who confirmed Robertson's suspicions.
   The inspectors learned that a wholesaler had sold Petland
Discount stores about 50 supposedly harmless snakes - and that some
had been distributed to the chain's 50 stores in the metropolitan
area.
   The Health Department issued a public warning about the snakes
Friday and is investigating the matter.
   ``They believe me now,'' said Robertson, who received
congratulations Friday from neighbors and relatives.
   Since Friday, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals has picked up at least five snakes from pet owners who
called for help. Two were venomous. Two were not. It was unclear
whether the fifth one was.
   In addition, 14 venomous snakes were removed from stores and
taken to the zoo.
   Redneck Keelbacks are not usually aggressive. But a bite can be
fatal if untreated, Health Department spokesman Peter Lynn said.
   The orangy snakes are about 18 inches long and about as big
around ``as your pinky,'' Bronx Zoo spokeswoman Marilynn LeVine
said.
   Robertson, who's unemployed, has worked for pet store
wholesalers and for two years at a Seattle zoo. He owns about 50
snake books.
   He says he's not scared of snakes, even though ``any time you
handle them, you have it in the back of your mind'' that they might
bite.
   Respect, he said, is the key.
   He's snakeless, right now. But he's owned more than 200 - king
snakes, albino rat snakes, boa constrictors, pythons - since he was
8 years old.
   Still, he concedes that they're not the cleverest of pets:
   ``You can't train them, or teach them tricks.''

   Leonard Bernstein, the ``West Side Story''
composer and flamboyant conductor who won a wider audience for
classical music and became a pop celebrity of the rock 'n' roll
age, has died at age 72.
   Bernstein died Sunday at his home of lung failure, said his
physician, Dr. Kevin M. Cahill.
   The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Bernstein became the
wunderkind of American music nearly five decades ago at a time when
all respected conductors in the United States were born and trained
in Europe.
   Bernstein was a conductor, pianist, educator, author and
composer. His compositions included the theatrical, chamber music,
symphonies, ballet and even a Mass.
   ``He was the most versatile musician and he did more than any
other person in this century for the appreciation of American music
and music culture,'' said Sir Georg Solti, music director of the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
   A man of strong passions and sometimes sloppy sentimentality, he
led an orchestra performance at a liberated concentration camp,
raised money for the Black Panthers and on Christmas 1989
celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall by conducting Beethoven's
``Ninth Symphony'' in Berlin.
   His televised ``Young People's Concerts'' helped introduce the
baby-boom generation to classical music and won 11 Emmy Awards. He
also won Grammys and a Tony.
   ``Leonard Bernstein will be remembered as the man who began to
teach Americans what classical music was,'' said violinist Isaac
Stern.
   His trademark was his exuberance at the podium. His jabs,
contortions and leaps occasionally caused him to fall. At his first
rehearsal for a guest appearance with the St. Louis Symphony, his
initial downbeat, or cue to the musicians, so startled them that
they just looked on in silence.
   ``He shagged, shimmied and, believe it or not, bumped,''
composer-critic Virgil Thomson once said. ``Bernstein rose
vertically, a la Nijinsky, and hovered there a good 15 seconds,''
New York Times critic Harold Schonberg wrote.
   Bernstein maintained that conductors should be actors.
   ``I don't mean that when the music is tragic you've got to act
like Barrymore in `Hamlet,''' he said. ``But you have to indicate
to the orchestra by your body and your face, which is all you've
got, what the shape of the phrase is.''
   Born in Lawrence, Mass., Bernstein - he pronounced his name the
Germanic way, BERN-stine - got a relatively late start in music. He
was 10 before his Aunt Clara gave the family an upright piano.
   Shunning his father's beauty supply business, Bernstein studied
at Harvard, the Curtis Institute and the Boston Symphony's summer
retreat at Tanglewood, Mass. Among his mentors were composers Aaron
Copland and Serge Koussevitzky.
   Bernstein in 1943 was a wiry young man of 25 with dark wavy hair
when he got his big break: filling in at the last minute for an
ailing Bruno Walter to conduct the New York Philharmonic in a
concert broadcast on national radio.
   The triumph joined World War II headlines on The New York Times'
front page.
   ``I walked on with an awful hangover and don't remember another
thing until I heard a thunderous ovation,'' Bernstein recalled.
   In 1943, he wrote the ballet ``Fancy Free,'' about three
sailors' 24-hour shore leave in New York. It became the Broadway
smash ``On The Town.''
   Soon to come were his chamber opera ``Trouble In Tahiti''; the
movie score for ``On the Waterfront,'' and Broadway's ``Wonderful
Town,'' for which Bernstein won his only Tony. Later came
Broadway's ``Candide,'' and ``West Side Story,'' the
Romeo-and-Juliet tale set amid the fire escapes and gang warfare of
New York City. It was completed in 1957 and was made into a movie
in 1961.
   In 1958 he became the New York Philharmonic's first
American-born director. In 1969, he gave up his post to devote more
time to composition.
   ``He first of all educated a whole generation in America with
his televised educational concerts, and as the music director of
the New York Philharmonic, hundreds of recordings have become a
household item in every music lover's home,'' said Zubin Mehta,
music director of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra in Tel Aviv.
   ``Lenny had the magic touch. Almost anybody he conducted, he
popularized,'' said Morton Gould, president of the American Society
of Composers, Authors and Publishers. ``Whatever he did, he had
such involvement and such dedication. When Lenny did Mahler, he was
Mahler.''
   Joan Peyser, author of ``Bernstein: A Biography,'' said the
maestro ``put American music on the map.''
   Bernstein's celebrity blossomed in the 1940s. Women were said to
swoon when he stepped to the podium. Fans reportedly tore at his
clothes and attacked him in his car. Actress Tallulah Bankhead,
after watching him in rehearsal, offered this come-on: ``Darling, I
have gone mad over your back muscles. You must come and have dinner
with me.''
   A liberal Democrat and friend of the Kennedy family, he wrote a
work for the Kennedy inauguration and dedicated his ``Mass'' in
1971 to John F. Kennedy. His star-studded fund-raiser for the Black
Panthers in 1970 was mocked by writer Tom Wolfe as ``radical
chic.''
   Four days before his death, Bernstein, a heavy smoker, retired
from the concert stage, citing emphysema and other lung ailments.
His last conducting appearance was at Tanglewood on Aug. 19.
   Survivors include son Alexander, a teacher, and two daughters,
Jaime Thomas, a rock musician, and Nina Bernstein, an actress. His
wife, actress Felicia Montealegre, died in 1978.
   Funeral services will be private.

<HEAD>Fifth Man Named in Cambridge Spy Ring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former KGB double agent has identified the
long-secret ``Fifth Man'' in a notorious Soviet spy ring as John
Cairncross, a former British intelligence officer.
   Oleg Gordievsky, a career KGB agent who worked for the British
as a double agent before escaping to the West in 1985, disclosed
the man's identity in ``KGB: The Inside Story,'' a new book
excerpted today in The Times newspaper. It was written with
Christopher Andrew, a Cambridge University historian.
   The identity of the ``Fifth Man'' has been speculated for years,
and a number of people have been suspected, including Cairncross.
   Gordievsky said Cairncross played an important part in the spy
ring led by Harold ``Kim'' Philby and including Guy Burgess, Donald
Maclean and Anthony Blunt.
   Philby, said to be the most damaging double agent in British
history, spied for the Soviets for 26 years until he defected to
Moscow in 1963. Philby rose to become head of the anti-Soviet
section of M16, the British service responsible for gathering
foreign intelligence.
   All went to Cambridge University, and it was there that Blunt
spotted Cairncross and Burgess recruited him, the excerpt from the
book says.
   ``Although Cairncross is the last of the five to be publicly
identified, he successfully penetrated a greater variety of the
corridors of power and intelligence than any of the other four,''
according to the book, which is to be published Friday in the
United States and Britain.
   The excerpt quotes KGB officer Dmitri Svetanko as saying:
``Cairncross's achievements were the equal of any of the five
except Philby.''
   Cairncross was a spy working before and during World War II in
the Foreign Office, the Treasury and the office of a government
minister, the excerpt said. He also worked for Britain's electronic
eavesdropping center and for MI6, according to the section of the
book printed in The Times.
   ``Until the end of World War II, when Philby's career began to
take off, I think he provided more important intelligence than any
of the others,'' Andrew told The Associated Press.
   The Times said the Scottish-born Cairncross confessed to the MI5
counterintelligence service in 1964. He now lives in the south of
France and is the only member of the spy ring still alive.
   ``This is not a new discovery,'' Labor Party legislator Ted
Leadbitter said on Sunday. ``This has been known for an awfully
long time.''
   The Times said Cairncross's involvement with Soviet intelligence
has been well documented, but he had never been placed in the same
category as the other four. ``Cairncross always claimed he was just
`a small fish,' '' the newspaper said.
   Former MI5 officer Peter Wright had said former MI5 head Sir
Roger Hollis was the ``Fifth Man'' of the Philby ring. Earlier this
year, Gordievsky said in a BBC television interview that Hollis,
who ran the counterespionage service from 1956 to 1965, was not a
Soviet agent.
   Gordievsky's 700-page book details KGB involvement in the
shooting down of the Korean Airlines Flight 007 in 1983.
   Gordievsky began working for the British while posted in
Copenhagen, Denmark in the early 1970s.
   The KGB Soviet intelligence service sent him to London, but he
was recalled to Moscow and questioned about his activities. He
eluded a KGB tail and escaped to the West. His 1985 defection
sparked a retaliatory expulsion of 31 Soviet and 31 British
diplomats, trade representatives and journalists.

<HEAD>Chairman of New York Stock Exchange Gives Sermon to City</HEAD>

   The incoming chairman of the New York Stock
Exchange attacked the materialism of the 1980s in a sermon at the
world's largest cathedral.
   William H. Donaldson, who takes over Jan. 1, said the last
decade was a time when ``it was easy to see how good things were
for some people and even easier to not see how bad things had
become for others.''
   Donaldson's guest appearance as a preacher Sunday at the
Cathedral of St. John the Divine stemmed from a rally last May when
Mayor David Dinkins asked civic leaders to work together to improve
the city.
   Donaldson, 59, a securities industry veteran, is a friend of
President Bush and the fourth, full-time paid chairman of the New
York Stock Exchange. He and two friends founded Donaldson, Lufkin
and Jenrette, the nation's 10th-largest brokerage. He also served
in the Nixon and Ford administrations.
   Despite his success and power in the business world, Donaldson
told the congregation that the prospect of preaching had given him
the jitters.
   In fact, he said, he was so nervous that the occasion ``conjured
up memories of (himself as) a little boy in a blue suit asked to
read the Scriptures in Buffalo, New York - all sweaty palms and
shaky knees.
   ``On January 1, when I pass through those worldly portals on 11
Wall Street, my first day will seem like a piece of cake.''
   During his 25-minute sermon, Donaldson said it should not be
left to the captains of industry and government to reverse the tide
of selfishness and greed.
   ``It is a spirit that must spring from the individual, not the
employee manual,'' he said.
   Donaldson's sermon was the first of a series of weekly sermons
dedicated to what church officials call ``sharing visions.''

   Republican gubernatorial candidate Jon
Grunseth is accused in sworn affidavits of encouraging four girls
aged 13 to 16 to join him for a nude swim at a 1981 pool party,
according to a newspaper report today.
   The statements were made by Liane Nelson, now 23 and a social
worker dealing with sexual abuse cases in the Boston area, and her
cousin Elizabeth Mulay, 22, of San Jose, Calif, the Star Tribune
reported today.
   The two women said Grunseth also encouraged his daughter, Nina,
to swim in the nude at the Fourth of July party at his home.
   Nina Grunseth denied the charges in her own affidavit, and her
father said supporters of Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich were trying
to ``blackmail'' him into dropping his campaign.
   ``I regard this as an absolute outrage,'' Grunseth told the Star
Tribune. ``But what is going on here, I'm convinced beyond any
doubt, is a creation of the Perpich camp. We're three weeks before
the election and all of a sudden out of the clear blue there are
charges that are being dropped on us about something that happened
nine or 10 years ago that no one has ever heard of.''
   Nelson, 14 at the time of the party, said she decided to speak
out nine years later because she believes there was sexual
impropriety at the party.
   ``I think that is extremely inappropriate behavior for someone
who wants to be governor,'' she told the Star Tribune.
   According to the affidavits from Nelson and Mulay, two other
teen-age girls in the pool, including Nina Grunseth, removed their
swimsuits at Grunseth's urging. Grunseth and one or more of his
adult male friends also took off their suits, Nelson and Mulay
said.
   ``He suggested we all take our swimsuits off,'' Mulay said. ``My
cousin and I were adamant about not taking them off. ... At one
point, (Grunseth) cornered me in the pool. I tried to swim by, but
he blocked me in.''
   Mulay said Grunseth at one point tried to touch one of her
breasts.
   ``I became afraid and swam under his arms and got away. I was
very angry and got right out of the pool,'' her statement said.
   Nina Grunseth, in an affidavit prepared Friday, said: ``I
believe the allegation against my father is totally untrue. I know
my father, and I do not believe under any circumstances he
committed the act of which he is accused or any similar act.''
   Grunseth, who was 35 at the time and a businessman, described
his 1981 party as a well-attended, wholesome event.
   On Sunday, he sent a letter to Perpich saying he holds the
governor responsible for the allegations.
   ``They are lies, and I will not tolerate them. I will not
succumb to blackmail,'' the Star Tribune quoted Grunseth as
writing.
   Perpich said he had no previous knowledge of the allegations.
   ``I've had no part in it,'' Perpich said.

   President Bush said today that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, winner of the 1990 Nobel Peace
Prize, is a ``courageous force'' for peaceful change.
   ``He has brought historically significant change, both political
and economic, to the Soviet Union and to Eastern Europe,'' Bush
said in a statement.
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee, in announcing Gorbachev the
winner today, cited the Soviet leader for opening his country to
reform, helping slow the arms race and allowing Eastern Europe to
break free of Soviet domination.
   ``President Mikhail Gorbachev has been a courageous force for
peaceful change in the world,'' Bush said. ``East-West relations
hold greater promise for peace and world stability today than at
any time in the last 45 years.''
   Bush also said the United States ``continues to work with the
Soviet Union to promote regional and international peace.''

   A state legislator showed he could stand
the heat of the campaign trail when he helped put out a house fire
with a garden hose.
   Rep. Bob Ream, a Democrat seeking re-election, said he was going
door-to-door Sunday afternoon when he saw smoke coming out of a
house. No one was home.
   Two men accompanying Ream - Lewis Ball, a volunteer fireman, and
his father, Irving Ball, - called a local emergency number while
Ream entered the house through an open window.
   He said the smoke was so thick he couldn't breathe, so he opened
the front door and came outside. Ream went in the home again on his
hands and knees with a garden hose, and sprayed water on a flaming
rocking chair until the smoke forced him to leave again.
   Battalion Chief Ralph Starr of the Missoula Rural Fire
Department said because of Ream's efforts, most of the damage was
smoke damage.
   ``I think it helped,'' Starr said. ``He was pretty fortunate it
didn't flash back on him when he opened the door.''
   The fire's cause was unkown.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today the 1990
Nobel Peace Prize was not a personal honor but an award for
perestroika - the reform program that has revolutionized the
nation's foreign and domestic policies.
   ``Words fail one at such moments. I am moved,'' Gorbachev told
Soviet and foreign reporters at the Kremlin.
   He said he received news of the prize ``first of all not in
personal terms but as recognition of the significance of the
immense cause of perestroika.''
   Tass quoted the Soviet leader as saying: ``When we were starting
our perestroika, we knew that it would have vast significance to
all countries.''
   Gorbachev said he will go to Oslo to personally accept the
award.
   Earlier, word spread at the Supreme Soviet of Gorbachev's win.
   Yegor Ligachev, Gorbachev's defeated political rival, and
Anatoly Dobrynin, the former Soviet ambassador to the United
States, were among those at the legislature when reporters learned
of the announcement in Oslo.
   Dobrynin said he welcomed the award for Gorbachev.
   Asked what effect it might have on Gorbachev and international
politics, Dobrynin said, ``I think very favorable, both ways.''
   He declined to say specifically what effect the prize may have,
describing the award as ``an approval of Gorbachev's international
policies, which I think have been mostly approved by my (Soviet)
society and world society.''
   Abroad, Gorbachev has been popular for working to end the Cold
War and for allowing revolutions in many East bloc countries. His
position at home has been tenuous because of a worsening economy
and waning of Communist Party power, and it was unclear how winning
the Peace Prize would affect his standing.
   Ligachev, one of Gorbachev's key conservative rivals, dashed
from the parliament building shortly after the word spread of the
award, answering with only one word to reporters asking his
reaction: ``Positive,'' he said.
   There was practically no public speculation in Moscow about
Gorbachev's chances of winning the prize in the days before the
prize was announced.
   The official news agency Tass waited nearly 40 minutes to move a
one-line urgent story on today's announcement. Datelined Oslo, the
Tass story said: ``Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev won the 1990
Nobel Peace Prize, the Norwegian Parliament's Nobel Committee
announced today.''
   The award was not announced inside the Supreme Soviet chamber,
and most of the deputies and dignitaries there were unaware he had
won for at least half an hour after word reached reporters.
   Yelena Bonner, wife of late human rights activist Andrei
Sakharov, who was awarded a Nobel Prize while in internal Soviet
exile, today refused comment on the news that Gorbachev had won.
   Since coming to power in March 1985, Gorbachev has presided over
sweeping changes in his country and the world.
   He sounded a clarion call for reducing global tension and led
the way toward treaties slashing conventional and nuclear forces.
   He withdrew Soviet troops from Afghanistan, freed the Soviet
press and created more powerful legislative bodies in the Soviet
Union.
   In Oslo, the Nobel Committee chairman, Gidske Anderson, cited
the ``greater openness he has brought to Soviet society,'' a
slowing in the arms race and the freedom of Eastern Europen
nations.
   Gorbachev's reforms have led to the rout of Communist regimes
from Eastern Europe. They also have been accompanied by bloody
ethnic conflicts in Armenia, Azerbaijan and Central Asia and have
prompted secession drives by the three Baltic republics, and
declarations of independence or sovereignty by most of the
remaining 12 Soviet republics, including Russia, the largest.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party swept to victory in
state elections in eastern Germany, final results indicated today,
solidifying its power just seven weeks before Germany holds its
first nationwide balloting.
   As a result of Sunday's conservative victory in four of the five
new eastern states, the opposition Social Democrats appeared likely
to lose their thin majority in the upper house of Parliament. They
conceded the losses hurt their chances to unseat Kohl's government
in the parliamentary election Dec. 2.
   ``It doesn't appear as if we're headed into any shining or
glorious victory, but it is still not the reason to give up,'' said
Reinhard Klimmt, the campaign manager for Kohl's Social Democrat
challenger, Oskar Lafontaine. Klimmt spoke in an interview today
with Saarland state radio.
   Kohl told television Sunday night: ``The Dec. 2 elections have
not been won, the results will come on Dec. 2. But we are in a good
starting position.''
   Kohl's party leads a coalition that already controls the more
powerful lower house of Parliament, or Bundestag. Representation in
the legislation-reviewing upper house, or Bundesrat, is based on
parties' electoral performance in statewide elections.
   Sunday's vote was seen as a prelude to nationwide parliamentary
elections on Dec. 2 - the first united German vote in 60 years and
the fourth this year in what was still East Germany just weeks ago.
   Results showed the Social Democrats defeating the Christian
Democrats only in Brandenburg state, where Kohl's strength could
not carry the unpopular conservative candidate. The Social
Democrats got 38.8 percent of the vote in Brandenburg to 29.3
percent for the Christian Democrats and 12.8 percent for the
renamed Communist Party.
   The results showed the Christian Democrats won a majority in
Saxony.
   They also won the most votes in Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and
Mecklenburg-Lower Pomerania, and were expected to form a coalition
with the centrist Free Democrats to hold a majority in those three
states.
   The turnout in the five states that used to be East Germany
ranged from 65 percent to 73.5 percent of the 11.5 million eligible
voters.
   Elections were also held Sunday in the former West German state
of Bavaria, where the Christian Socialists, sister party in Kohl's
coalition, retained their absolute majority.
   Kohl, the politician most credited with uniting Germany on Oct.
3, is favored in the December elections.
   The Social Democrats have criticized Kohl's party for the speed
and cost of unification. Their own program calls primarily for
better environmental protection.
   Kohl had campaigned extensively on behalf of conservative
candidates in Sunday's elections, which gave eastern Germans state
legislatures and ended decades of centralized Communist control.
   Concerns among eastern Germans about their economic security as
their homeland converts to capitalism from a planned system
dominated the brief election campaign.
   The merger with richer West Germany has left East Germans
swimming in an economy now riddled with unemployment, higher prices
and uncompetetive industries.
   The renamed Communists who ruled East Germany for 40 years
seemed set to win seats in state legislatures, a sign of support
for a bid to enter the united Parliament in December.
   But the extreme right-wing Republicans failed in a bid for seats
in the Bavarian parliament and Kohl gave the party little chance in
the national elections.
   Sunday's state elections recreated the German states dissolved
by the Communists four decades ago when the country was
centralized.
   Elections in March chose the government that led East Germany to
unity, while a May vote put local governments in place.
   The new state governments must form new administrations to take
responsibility for police, education, transportation and some
social services.

<HEAD>Iraq Issues Harsh Statement To Counter Reports Of Flexibility On
Kuwait</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq issued a stern warning to the United
States and its allies today, saying Israel and other ``strongholds
of conspiracy'' would be crushed if Iraq were attacked.
   The statement in the newspaper of the ruling Baath Party comes
amid speculation in Baghdad that Iraq will be attacked within three
weeks. It appeared intended to counter suggestions that President
Saddam Hussein was showing signs of flexibility on the annexation
of Kuwait.
   The editorial in the Al-Thawra newspaper said Iraqis ``are
prepared to meet the American troops.''
   ``If they start the war, we will make it a catastrophe for those
who ignite it,'' the editorial said. ``The destruction will be
total, especially (considering) that Israel is within the range of
an al-Hijara missile, and all other strongholds of conspiracy and
aggression will be crushed.''
   Al-Hijara, Arabic for ``the stones,'' is the name of an Iraqi
missile that Saddam first described on Oct. 9, the day after at
least 19 Palestinian stone-throwers were killed in Jerusalem by
Israeli policemen. Saddam said the missile could hit targets
hundreds of miles away.
   The reference to ``other strongholds of conspiracy'' apparently
meant Saudi Arabia and other Arab countries participating in the
U.S.-led multinational force that assembled in the Persian Gulf
region after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Initially, the stated purpse of those forces was to defend
Saudi Arabia, but there have been indications some Western leaders
are losing patience and are considering a military attack to
dislodge Iraq from Kuwait. Exiled Kuwaiti officials have encouraged
that course.
   ``We will make them be sorry for listening to the advice of
their little stooges in the area,'' Al-Thawra said. ``All the
American interests and those of its allies inside and outside the
region will explode, and the fires will eat them at the first hour
of their aggression against Iraq.''
   The language seemed aimed at countering suggestions that Saddam
might be softening on his refusal to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat said
Sunday that Saddam was showing a ``certain flexibility'' regarding
his claims to Kuwait, and urged all countries involved in the gulf
crisis to follow suit.
   The remark came in Tunis, where Arafat met with Foreign Minister
Roland Dumas of France.
   Diplomatic sources in Baghdad said Arafat, who met with Saddam
earlier Sunday, is trying to persuade the Iraqis to talk with the
French, who have made it clear they believe Iraq's withdrawal from
Kuwait might be linked to an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Saddam said Aug. 12 that he would negotiate on a withdrawal from
Kuwait only if negotiations also were held on the Palestinian
issue.
   In Moscow, the government-run Novosti press agency also reported
Saddam showed signs of softening his position. The agency said
Saddam indicated to Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov recently that he
might remove his troops in exchange for some Kuwaiti territory
along the gulf.
   But Iraq's first deputy prime minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan,
said on Sunday that Iraq is prepared ``to confront whatever
happens'' in holding Kuwait.
   And Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, visiting Morocco, said: ``In
the light of this crime in Jerusalem, the Arab nation has a great
responsibility to say the clear word - not to agree on dealing with
two faces.''

   Left-wing Israeli parties today said they would
challenge the Cabinet's decision not to cooperate with a U.N. team
investigating the shooting deaths of at least 19 Palestinians by
Israeli police.
   The Cabinet on Sunday called the U.N. mission ``unacceptable''
and said the delegation should stay away from Israel. The decision
defied not only the United Nations but its chief ally, the United
States.
   Israel took on the United States on a second issue, announcing a
new housing plan that ignores American pleas not to settle newly
arrived Soviet immigrants in territory captured in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   The main opposition Labor Party was expected to support the
left-wing challenge to the Cabinet decision during debate today in
the opening fall session of the Knesset, or parliament, legislators
said.
   Even with Labor support, the motion will have a difficult time
overcoming the 62-seat majority of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing coalition in the 120-member parliament. But Shamir's
hold could be weakened by arguments with Shas, an ultra-Orthodox
religious party.
   Labor and small left-wing parties have 54 votes in parliament.
   Amnon Rubinstein, head of the small Shinui Party, said he
believed the Cabinet decision was a mistake since it would isolate
Israel from the United States and the world community.
   ``It is a response that will damage Israel's relations with her
friends overseas, will weaken her influence in the United States
and would exclude her from the concensus which the Western family
of nations has constructed against (Iraqi president) Saddam
Hussein,'' Rubinstein said.
   The Labor Party also has urged low-level police and city
officials to cooperate with U.N. envoys so Israel's side would be
heard.
   Cabinet officials made it clear that they expect the U.N. three
investigators to stay away, although it appeared no move was taken
to block their arrival. ``This is not an invitation to come; it's
an invitation not to come,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister Benyamin
Netanyahu.
   The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday to condemn
the deaths of the Palestinians in police gunfire on Oct. 8 on
Jerusalem's Temple Mount, known in Arabic as Haram al-Sharif and
revered by Jews and Moslems.
   In a rare gesture, the United States joined in the censure of
its ally, agreeing to a resolution calling for the dispatch to
Jerusalem of a three-member delegation to investigate the
shootings.
   The Temple Mount riot began when Palestinians threw rocks onto
worshipers praying below at the Western Wall, Judaism's holiest
site. Police first used tear gas and rubber bullets, then live
ammunition.
   Israel's Cabinet, at its regular weekly session Sunday, said it
saw no reason for the United Nations to intervene when it had
ignored worse incidents in other countries.
   The Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth reported that Secretary of
State James A. Baker III sent a message urging Israel to accept the
U.N. team, saying a refusal could further distract world attention
from international efforts to solve the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Israel set up its own inquiry into the shootings on Friday. The
investigating commission is led by former Mossad spy chief Zvi
Zamir and is only empowered o make recommendations.
   Israel maintains its police were provoked by the barrage of
stones thrown at Jews at the Western Wall, also known as the
Wailing Wall.
   An Israeli human rights group on Sunday accused police of
indiscriminate shooting and ``criminal negligence'' in the
bloodshed. The group, Betselem, said the government has attempted
to ``hide the facts, mislead the public... and evade
responsibility'' in the shootings.
   Foreign Minister David Levy said Israel's stand against the
United Nations could strain ties with the United States: ``The
situation now is difficult, one mustn't take it lightly.''
   The Cabinet's response gave vent to Israel's frustration at
coming under strong criticism at a time when civilians are being
issued gas masks to cope with Iraq's threats to attack with
chemical weapons. The army started handing out the defense kits
last week in three towns and planned to widen distribution to all
cities, including Arab villages, beginning today.
   The Temple Mount clash was the bloodiest of a 34-month
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of lands seized in
the 1967 Middle East war. Moslems revere the site as the place
where the prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
   It is the Jews' holiest site, and the location of the Western
Wall, or Wailing Wall, remnant of their Biblical temple.
   The Temple Mount shootings have shifted the focus of the
Palestinian uprising from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to
Jerusalem, home to 350,000 Jews and 150,000 Palestinian Arabs.
   On Sunday night, the Israeli government announced plans for a
building campaign throughout Jerusalem to dramatize its claims to
the city.
   The committee on immigration decided to build about 5,000
apartments in the coming year and to ask the Cabinet to approve
incentives to contractors and Soviet immigrants, said Absorption
Ministry spokeswoman Ida Ben-Shitreet.
   Mrs. Ben-Shitreet said housing would go up in eight
neighborhoods, six of them in predominantly Arab east Jerusalem,
which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed.
   The decision comes despite U.S. requirements that Israel avoid
settling Soviet newcomers in occupied territories or east
Jerusalem. These were conditions of a $400 million loan guarantee
approved by Congress this month.

   A former Air Force sergeant convicted of
aggravated assault because he engaged in homosexual conduct while
knowingly infected with an AIDS-related virus lost a Supreme Court
appeal today.
   The justices, without comment, let stand Nathaniel Johnson Jr.'s
conviction, dishonorable military discharge and six-year prison
sentence.
   Johnson was stationed at McChord Air Force Base in Washington
state when in 1987 he tested positive for the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is believed to cause acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   A person who, like Johnson, tests positive for HIV has a 20 to
30 percent change of developing AIDS over a five-year period,
according to the federal Centers for Disease Control.
   Johnson was sent to the Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland
Air Force Base in Texas for evaluation and treatment, and while
there received counseling on ``safe sex'' practices.
   Johnson remained a patient at Wilford Hall until October 1987,
about two weeks after the Air Force adopted a policy that held out
the possibility of disciplinary action for HIV-infected military
members who did not practice safe sex.
   Lawyers for Johnson say he never was told about the policy.
   After returning to McChord, Johnson engaged in homosexual
conduct with a 17-year-old boy he had met in a Tacoma bar.
   The two kissed, and Johnson performed fellatio on the youth. A
military judge also found that Johnson had attempted to have anal
intercourse with the youth. Johnson did not tell the boy about his
HIV infection.
   Tried by general court-martial at McChord in early 1988, Johnson
was convicted of consensual sodomy by fellatio. He also was
convicted of aggravated assault and attempted sodomy, both premised
on the act of attempted consensual anal intercourse. He was
sentenced to 10 years in prison.
   The U.S. Air Force Court of Military Review threw out the
attempted consenual sodomy conviction after ruling that the charge
essentially duplicated the aggravated assault charge.
   The court reduced Johnson's sentence to six years, and its
ruling was upheld by the U.S. Court of Military Appeals last April.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Johnson said the
portion of the Uniform Code of Military Justice used to prosecute
him for aggravated assault is impermissibly vague when applied to
the possible transmission of a virus.
   They said the offense of aggravated assault never was intended
to be used against someone accused of transmitting a contagious
disease unless there is a clear intent to spread the disease.
   The appeal added: ``Our society is clearly inflamed with
hysteria over the HIV epidemic ... We cannot allow our legal system
to be improperly used as a tool for the further prosecution of HIV
carriers.''
   The case is Johnson vs. U.S., 90-61.

<HEAD>Illinois Cops Lose High Court Appeal on Earrings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two policemen from a small town in Illinois
who say they were disciplined unlawfully for wearing earrings when
off duty lost a Supreme Court appeal today.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Peotone,
Ill., officials violated the two officers' constitutional right to
make a fashion statement while on their own time.
   Marvin Rathert and Gary Zybak contend they have a right,
protected by the 14th Amendment's bar on deprivations of
``liberty'' without due process, to wear any jewelry they choose,
including an ear stud, when not on the job.
   But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in rejecting that
contention last June, said, ``The Peotone police officers are
members of a small community ... There is little difference in the
way the village's police officers are publicly viewed ... whether
they wear the ear stud on duty or off.''
   Peotone is a village of fewer than 5,000 residents.
   The appeals court relied heavily on a 1976 decision in which the
Supreme Court upheld a police force's hair-length regulations for
all policemen.
   But in the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the two policemen
said the 1976 ruling ``cannot be properly applied to a transitory
article of personal dress that can be worn off duty and be left at
home while on duty.''
   The case is Rathert vs. Village of Peotone, 90-349.

<TEXT>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) - A former church chorister accused of
poisoning her two husbands and a former boyfriend is looking
forward to telling her side of the story at the opening of her
murder trial, her attorney said.
   Blanche Taylor Moore, 57, is charged with first-degree murder in
the Oct. 7, 1986, arsenic-poisoning death of Raymond Reid. He was
her boss and later her boyfriend.
   Jury selection was scheduled for this afternoon in Forsyth
County Superior Court.
   ``She's been anxious about all the negative little things that
have come out in the whole 14{ months'' since she was arrested,
said defense attorney Mitchell McEntire. ``She's had a desire to
respond and has had no forum.''
   Prosecutors, who are seeking the death penalty, have said Mrs.
Moore systematically poisoned Reid, James N. Taylor, her first
husband, and the Rev. Dwight Moore, her second, over a 16-year
period. Only Moore survived the arsenic.
   When Moore was hospitalized in May 1989 shortly after returning
home from his honeymoon, doctors were perplexed by his severe
nausea and vomiting.
   Tests showed the Burlington minister was lucky to be alive: He
had been poisoned by a near fatal dose of arsenic in his food.
   Hospital officials immediately notified police, who began
checking into the past of Moore's bride, a retired grocery store
clerk. They quickly discovered that Reid, 50, had died three years
earlier after a long hospital stay.
   Reid's body was exhumed and an autopsy showed he died from
arsenic poisoning. A subsequent autopsy also found arsenic in the
exhumed body of Taylor, who died of an apparent heart attack at age
45 in 1973.
   Non-fatal amounts of arsenic also were found in the bodies of
her father, who died in 1966, and mother-in-law from her first
marriage, who died in 1970. No charges were filed in those cases.
   Earlier this month, Judge William Freeman denied a request by
Forsyth County District Attorney Warren Sparrow to consolidate the
two murder charges and two assault charges in Moore's poisoning
into one trial.
   Mrs. Moore, a small-framed woman and a grandmother, will be
tried later on the second murder charge in Taylor's death and the
assault charges.
   Sparrow said today that jury selection could take a week and
that the trial itself could last up to six weeks. Sparrow said he
intends to call as many as 70 witnesses.
   Since her arrest July 18, 1989, Mrs. Moore has been held without
bail in the Alamance County Jail in Graham. It's just a few miles
from Burlington, where she had once lived a quiet life, singing in
the church choir and working at the local Kroger's grocery store.
   ``She has suffered from nearly 15 months of incarceration,''
said McEntire. ``She's been stuck in a cell in the county jail, and
it has taken its toll. But she has a spirit about her that remains
very strong.''

<HEAD>High Court Sets Aside Minnesota Flag-Burning Conviction</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 9th graf, Cary burned, to President Reagan sted Bush</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, which has twice ruled that
burning the American flag is protected political speech, today set
aside a Minnesota man's flag-burning conviction.
   The justices told a federal appeals court to restudy a
free-speech challenge to William C. Cary Jr.'s federal conviction
for burning an American flag during a 1988 demonstration in
Minneapolis.
   In upholding Cary's conviction, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled he was arrested and prosecuted not for any political
message contained in his flag burning but ``to prevent further
breaches of the peace.''
   The nation's highest court in June 1989 struck down a Texas law
- and by extension similar laws in most other states - barring
desecration or destruction of the flag. And the court last June
invalidated a federal flag-burning ban that had been inspired by
the political firestorm the 1989 ruling touched off.
   Both decisions were reached by 5-4 votes.
   In both, now-retired Justice William J. Brennan wrote for the
court that government may not prohibit expression of an idea simply
because most people find it deeply offensive.
   But in Cary's case, the 8th Circuit court ruled his prosecution
was not aimed at any expression of an idea but instead was aimed at
conduct that could have led to violence.
   In a brief order, the justices set aside the appeals court
ruling and told that court to reconsider Cary's case in light of
last June's decision.
   Cary burned a flag during a March 18, 1988 demonstration outside
an armed services recruitment center in downtown Minneapolis to
protest President Reagan's policies in Honduras.
   Some 3,200 American troops had been ordered into Honduras the
previous day.
   Some vandalism, including the breaking of windows, took place
during the demonstration, but federal prosecutors never alleged
that Cary participated in that. The only charge against him was
based on the federal law against flag burning that existed at the
time.
   Cary was convicted and sentenced to three months in jail.
   The Supreme Court decision striking down the Texas law was
announced while Cary's appeal was pending before the 8th Circuit
court.
   In ruling on Cary's case last February, the appeals court said
his conviction under the old federal law was not content-based but
tied to the government's desire to ``prevent further breaches of
the peace which would likely result from the reaction of the
vandals to Cary's means of communicating his message in a context
of violence.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Cary urged the
justices to reverse his conviction. They said the conviction
``depended on the communicative impact of his conduct.''
   But Bush administration lawyers said the conviction should
stand.
   ``The court below concluded that the government's interest in
preventing breaches of the peace was implicated on the facts before
it,'' Justice Department lawyers said.
   The Minnesota Civil Liberties Union, in a friend-of-the-court
brief, took Cary's side.
   It contended that the 8th Circuit court's ruling in Cary's case
``has virtually gutted'' the two Supreme Court rulings on flag
burning by carving out a vague ``context of violence'' exception.
   The case is Cary vs. U.S., 90-5183.

   A 21-year-old university student poured
gasoline on his head and set himself on fire after accusing the
government of corruption and demanding its resignation.
   The student was taken to Police Hospital with burns covering
more than 50 percent of his body, said Kosol Nakachon, a
photographer for the newspaper Bangkok Post, who witnessed the
incident Sunday.
   Later Sunday, police halted a demonstration by eight university
students who threatened to set themselves afire if the government
did not resign.
   Kosol said the student, Tanawot Klingchue, set himself ablaze
shortly after criticizing the government for alleged corruption in
a speech before 400 students and other people on the road in front
of Ramkhamhaeng University.
   He said Tanowot them poured gasoline on himself, set himself
ablaze and walked about 150 feet before collapsing on the road.
   Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan's 2-year-old coalition
government has been shaken by frequent charges of corruption.
   The army chief, Gen. Suchinda Kraprayon, was quoted as saying
Wednesday that the army may soon have to decide whether to respond
to public calls for it to step in and help resolve political
problems.
   Chatichai made a major Cabinet change in August to improve the
government's image. Two deputy ministers were fired in corruption
scandals.

   The 37-year-old law barring
blacks from many public facilities formally ended today, and the
African National Congress urged blacks to counter right-wing
opposition by exercising their new rights.
   In another development, black factional fighting broke out in a
township east of Johannesburg on Sunday night. Police said seven
blacks were killed at a migrant workers hostel in fighting between
rival groups armed with pistols and knives. The fighting was the
worst incident after several weeks of relative calm in the black
townships in the area.
   The lifting of the Separate Amenities Act, which was a pillar of
South Africa's apartheid system, was not expected to have
noticeable effects in major cities, where segregation has eased in
recent years.
   But in smaller towns controlled by the right-wing Conservative
Party, a showdown was set between blacks and white authorities and
residents opposed to the changes.
   In the town of Middelburg in the Conservative-dominated
Transvaal province, residents have voted to close all public
facilities rather than open them to all races.
   Other towns planned to charge fees higher than most blacks can
afford to restrict their use of public amenities. Black leaders
threatened strikes and boycotts to protest the actions.
   ``Entry to public facilities must be unconditional and free.
What these councils are planning is an illegal act of banditry,''
said the ANC's secretary in the eastern Transvaal, Joe Nkuna.
   He said the formation of vigilante groups to keep blacks out
would fail if people were determined to end discrimination, and he
appealed to blacks to begin using the amenities.
   Parliament repealed the Separate Amenities Act in June and gave
communities until Oct. 15 to comply. The governing National Party
had approved the act in 1953, five years after it came to power on
a platform advocating strict separation of the races.
   Since President F.W. de Klerk took office in August 1989,
however, he has instituted a number of racial reforms, released
such emminent black leaders as Nelson Mandela, and begun talks with
the ANC to negotiate a new constition giving the black majority
some share of power.
   The so-called petty apartheid laws permitted under the Separate
Amenities Act barred blacks from such municipal services as public
restrooms, swimming pools, spas, and libraries.
   The black factional fighting in Kempton Park township was
between Zulus and Xhosas, the main combatants in the recent battles
around Johannesburg that have left about 800 people dead since
early August.
   Many Zulus are loyal to the conservative Inkatha movement while
many Xhosas and other blacks back the African National Congress.
   Several people were wounded in Sunday night's battle, hospital
officials said. All the victims had bullet or stab wounds, police
said, adding no arrests had been made.
   The ANC and Inkatha also have been battling in the eastern
province of Natal since 1986, leaving about 5,000 dead. The two
sides were scheduled to resume peace talks today in Durban, the
largest city in Natal Province.
   The ANC and Inkatha both oppose apartheid, but differ on tactics
and plans for a future South Africa.

   The final budget plan that will emerge from
Congress will mean sharply higher taxes for upper-income Americans,
Majority Leader George Mitchell said today.
   The House and Senate are expected to approve rival
deficit-reduction plans this week in an effort to keep the
government from shutting down for the second time this month.
   House Democrats are calling for an increase in the top rate paid
by the wealthiest, from 28 percent to 33 percent. The Senate
Finance Committee is proposing limiting deductions that can be
claimed by upper-income taxpayers, which also would serve to
increase taxes on the wealthy.
   The administration opposes the House Democratic plan, which
would require higher-income taxpayers to bear about two-thirds of
the proposed tax increase.
   President Bush told reporters on Air Force One today that he met
this morning with minority leaders Rep. Bob Michel, R-Ill., and
Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   He said they were ``pretty much on the same wavelength'' in
preferring the Senate Finance Committee proposal over the House
Democratic plan.
   But Bush, en route to Texas for the first stop of a two-day
campaign trip, refused to say what he might do about taxes.
   ``That managed to get a little confused last week, so what I'll
do is to say the action's in the Congress and I will take a look at
what comes out,'' he said. ``We've indicated to our leaders our
preferences.''
   Mitchell, D-Maine, told reporters he hoped the two versions
could be blended ``to get an even more progressive tax package.''
   Bush and Congress have been negotiating for months on a
deficit-reduction plan to cut spending and increase taxes by about
$500 billion over five years.
   Mitchell said the burden on the rich would be considerably
higher under the Senate Finance Committee bill compared with a plan
worked out among congressional leaders and the White House. That
agreement was rejected by the House.
   The Finance Committee bill includes a 9{-cent-a-gallon increase
in the tax on gasoline.
   The House Democratic version would forgo any increase in the
gasoline tax, relying instead on delaying an adjustment in the
income-tax brackets and personal exemptions - a delay that would
mean higher income taxes on everyone who files a return.
   The government's spending authority expires at midnight Friday
and President Bush has said he'll veto any stopgap extension unless
a deficit reduction is approved.
   John Sununu, the White House staff chief, said Sunday the odds
favor another shutdown next weekend.
   All sides ``will have difficulty'' agreeing on a budget by then,
he said.
   Bush allowed non-essential federal activity to stop for three
days over the Columbus Day holiday weekend after the House rejected
a deficit reduction plan Oct. 5. The government resumed operating
on the stopgap measure that expires Friday.
   The odds are ``probably relatively high'' the government will
begin shutting down a second time if Congress fails to approve a
plan acceptable to the White House, Sununu said.
   Congress also is racing to complete work on a number of other
measures including a clean air bill, crime legislation, the 1990
farm bill and a civil rights measure. Lawmakers hope to adjourn
sometime in the next two weeks to campaign for the Nov. 6 election.
   Later today, the Senate planned to take up the $268 billion
defense spending bill for fiscal 1991. The plan trims about $1
billion from Bush's budget request for the Strategic Defense
Initiative but leaves intact the administration's request for the
B-2 stealth bomber. It also cuts 100,000 troops from the U.S.
worldwide troop level of 2.1 million.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said Sunday the president is prepared
to keep Congress in session for as long as it takes to craft a
budget plan he can accept.
   Both Sununu and Quayle attacked a plan that was passed last week
by the Democratic-controlled House Ways and Means Committee.
   The measure, which would raise the income tax on the wealthiest
Americans from 28 percent to 33 percent, is expected to win
approval from the full House. A family earning more than $200,000
could see their taxes increase by $11,000 under the plan.
   Quayle said the administration is ``violently opposed'' to the
Democratic plan, while Sununu said the administration was ``opposed
to playing around with the income tax rate for Americans across the
board.'' Quayle appeared on CBS's ``Face the Nation,'' while Sununu
was on NBC's ``Meet the Press.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee,
said his proposal is designed to ``protect middle-income and poor
America'' and make everyone ``share in the pain of governing.''
   ``I'm not going to deny that we're trying to make a political
statement, and there certainly is evidence that there's now a
division between Democrats and Republicans,'' said Rostenkowski,
D-Ill.
   While Sununu and Quayle strongly opposed the House proposal,
they did not criticize the Senate Finance Committee's plan to leave
the 28 percent rate intact and instead close tax loopholes for the
rich.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the committee, said he
would not go along with an increase to 33 percent - although he
supports it in theory - because Bush's opposition dooms any tax
package that includes such an increase.
   ``That means that we have a progressive table, that those making
the highest income will pay the highest increase in the taxes,'' he
said on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley.
   Any deficit-reduction plan is expected to reduce defense
spending, cut Medicare and hold back spending in other federal
programs. Debate in recent days has focused primarily on raising
taxes, including those on alcohol, gas, luxury items and
cigarettes.
   The 1991 fiscal year began Oct. 1.

   The Supreme Court boosted the federal
government's crackdown on obscenity today as it let stand the
forced closing of three adult bookstores and nine video rental
shops in Virginia.
   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments by the
businesses' owners, who were convicted of racketeering and selling
obscene materials, that the subsequent seizures of the businesses
violated their free-speech rights.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear arguments in the case, but
four votes are needed to grant such review.
   In other decisions today:
   -The court, which has twice ruled that burning the American flag
is protected political speech, set aside a Minnesota man's
flag-burning conviction. The justices told a federal appeals court
to restudy a free-speech challenge to the man's federal conviction
for burning the flag.
   The lower court had ruled that the an was arrested and
prosecuted not for any political message contained in his flag
burning but ``to prevent further breaches of the peace.''
   -Ruled against a former Air Force sergeant convicted of
aggravated assault because he engaged in homosexual conduct while
knowingly infected with an AIDS-related virus. The justices,
without comment, let stand the man's conviction, dishonorable
military discharge and six-year prison sentence.
   -Refused to revive a copyright lawsuit over an unauthorized
biography of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the Scientology religion.
The justices, without comment, let stand a decision throwing out
allegations of copyright infringement against the book's publisher.
   -Refused to help states ban deceptive advertising by airlines.
Without comment, the court left intact a ruling that only the
federal government may regulate airline ads. The lower court's
ruling said that Texas officials lack the authority to take action
against allegedly misleading airline ads.
   -Ruled against two policemen from Peotone, Ill., who contended
they were disciplined unlawfully for wearing earrings when off
duty. The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the two
officers' constitutional right to make a fashion statement while on
their own time had been violated.
   In the Virginia obscenity case, the seizures were carried out
under provisions of the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act, or RICO. Those convicted of participating in an
enterprise through a pattern of racketeering may be forced to
forfeit all assets and proceeds stemming from the illegal activity.
   The justices were told that the Virginia case is the first
prosecuted under RICO in which the racketeering activity charges
were based entirely on obscenity crimes.
   Obscenity was added in 1984 to the long list of underlying
crimes on which a RICO prosecution could be based.
   ``The court's determination of the validity of post-judgment
forfeiture in this case will have enormous impact upon the future
of RICO obscenity prosecutions, both state and federal,'' lawyers
for the convicted business owners said.
   Dennis and Barbara Pryba, owners of the corporations that
operated the bookstores and video shops in northern Virginia, were
convicted of selling and distributing obscene magazines and
videotapes worth about $105.
   An employee, Jennifer Williams, also was convicted on obscenity
charges.
   Dennis Pryba was sentenced to three years in prison and five
years probation, and was fined $75,000. Barbara Pryba was given a
suspended prison sentence and fined $200,000. Ms. Williams was
given three years probation and fined $2,250.
   One of the corporations the Prybas owned also was fined
$200,000.
   After a separate jury trial, a federal judge ordered that all
assets - including corporate stock, inventory, bank accounts,
automobiles and even office furniture - be forfeited.
   The convictions and forfeiture order was upheld by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals last April.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Prybas and
Williams argued that forfeiture of businesses engaged in
constitutionally protected activities - the distribution of
materials not found to be obscene - amounts to an impermissible
``prior restraint'' of speech.
   ``Although obscenity itself is a crime, a past finding of
obscenity has never, in this court's view, justified a ban on
further communicative offerings,'' the appeal said.
   The Bush administration urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   ``If bookstores, newsstands, publishing houses and the like were
immune from forfeiture, drug lords and other racketeers could

proceeds from seizure,'' government lawyers argued.
   The case is Pryba vs. U.S., 89-1902.

<HEAD>Cheney: U.S. Prepared To Keep Troops In Saudi Arabia For Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney said today the
United States is prepared to keep troops in Saudi Arabia for years
if necessary.
   ``We're there as long as the Saudis want us ... as long as it
takes to get the job done. And no one should underestimate our
staying power,'' Cheney said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio
interview.
   The defense secretary was to meet with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher and British Defense Secretary Tom King later today on the
first stop of his 10-day visit to Europe. Cheney goes to Moscow on
Tuesday and then to Paris.
   Britain already has warplanes and naval ships in the Persian
Gulf. It is sending about 6,000 combat troops as part of the
U.S.-led multinational force assembled after Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug 2.
   Cheney said economic sanctions were only just beginning to hurt
Iraq and stressed the United States hopes to avoid war.
   Mrs. Thatcher told her Conservative Party at its annual
conference Friday to prepare for war if sanctions fail. Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd called for an assessment within weeks of the
effectiveness of the economic sanctions.
   Cheney said Mrs. Thatcher was ``just stating very forthrightly
the view we in the United States hold as well.''
   He dismissed predictions that support in the United States for
the troop buildup will decline and the international alliance
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein will crumble unless force is
used soon. ``Time is much more likely to be on our side than it is
on his side,'' said Cheney.
   Asked if there was the political will in the United States to
maintain 250,000 troops in Saudi Arabia ``for some years'' to keep
up the pressure, Cheney said, ``There certainly is.''
   He said the United States would respond ``very forcefully'' to
an Iraqi attack on any ally in the multinational force.
   Cheney said there is some concern that Saddam might resort to
military means to break the sanctions rather than suffer continued
economic harm.

   Bluesmen Buddy Guy and John Lee Hooker
were top winners at the 11th annual National Blues Awards Show
sponsored by a blues preservation group headquartered in Memphis.
   ``It's people like John Lee Hooker who've always kept the blues
alive and been responsible for the music's remaining vital,'' said
singer Bonnie Raitt, who accepted an award on Hooker's behalf. ``I
feel honored to be able to play the music and songs that he and
other great musicians have written.''
   The awards were handed out Sunday at a banquet sponsored by the
Blues Foundation Inc. The awards are called Handys, in honor of
W.C. Handy, a blues pioneer who wrote and performed in Memphis.
   Guy was named blues entertainer of the year and blues
instrumentalist of the year for guitar. He also accepted the blues
band of the year award.
   ``I'm more surprised than I've ever been in my life because I've
never won anything before,'' Guy said.
   Hooker won blues vocalist of the year and contemporary male
blues artist of the year.
   His album, ``The Healer,'' was selected contemporary blues album
of the year.
   The Blues Foundation, with some 1,500 members, has 25 affiliate
groups around the country and in Great Britain.

   Friends and colleagues remembered Leonard
Bernstein as an exuberant conductor, a versatile composer and the
man who more than anyone brought American music to the world.
   ``With him goes a spectacular, special era in American music
making,'' said violinist Isaac Stern, who paused after his 70th
birthday tribute at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia on Sunday
to remember his friend of 47 years.
   ``He was in a way the epitome of this burgeoning, exultant young
powerful giant called music making in this country.''
   Frank Sinatra, who starred in the 1949 film version of
Bernstein's ``On The Town,'' called Bernstein's death ``a personal
loss to me and to the world.''
   ``He was perhaps one of the 10 best interpreters of fine music
in the past 100 years,'' he said.
   Bernstein, whose career included the hit Broadway shows ``On the
Town'' and ``West Side Story'' and hundreds of recordings, died
Sunday at age 72.
   ``The loss is too great to consider,'' said ``West Side Story''
choreographer Jerome Robbins, his voice breaking. ``I've lost a
very good personal friend and collaborator from early on.''
   ``He was the most versatile musician and he did more than any
other person in this century for the appreciation of American music
and music culture,'' said Sir Georg Solti, music director of
Chicago Symphony Orchestra.
   ``His departure creates an unfillable gap in our artistic and
spiritual life. He leaves us at a moment when we seem to need him
the most,'' said John Williams, conductor of Boston Pops.
   In Austria, noted music critic Franz Endler spoke of Bernstein
as ``a really good friend, not only for important people in Vienna
but also simple people ... one of the most open-hearted people I
ever knew.''
   ``Nobody will ever again personify our love for music like
Leonard Bernstein did,'' said Vienna State Opera Artistic Director
Claudio Abbado.
   Abbado said Bernstein ``was not only an incomparable musician
whose enthusiasm and joy in making music were a constant delight,
but also a true, spontaneous friend whose example was a source of
inspiration during a great part of my musical career.''
   Stage director Otto Schenk said: ``The actual interruption
through physical death is just incomprehensible for me. My meeting
with him was a meeting with music and with joy.''
   ``He was the most unique musician of this century, there is no
doubt about it,'' said Zubin Mehta, music director of the New York
Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.
   ``He first of all educated a whole generation in America with
his televised educational concerts, and as the music director of
the New York Philharmonic, hundreds of recordings have become a
household item in every music lover's home,'' Mehta said from Tel
Aviv. ``I think our musicians will miss him a lot.''
   On his doctor's advice, Bernstein retired from conducting four
days before his death, citing emphysema and other lung ailments.
Bernstein, once a heavy smoker, last conducted on Aug. 19 at the
Boston Symphony's summer home at Tanglewood, Mass.
   ``In the past few days, the words from one of his Broadway songs
has been going through my head: `Just when the fun is starting,
comes the time for parting,' '' said composer Ned Rorem, quoting
from ``We'll Catch Up Some Other Time'' from ``On the Town.''
   ``Broadway compositions often eclipsed his most important music,
his symphonies and chamber music,'' Rorem added. ``If he had
specialized, he would have been so frustrated as to be impotent.''
   In 1958 Bernstein became the first American-born director of the
New York Philharmonic. He stepped down in 1969 to devote more time
to composition.
   ``He was the New York Philharmonic in its spirit and very
essence and we're going to miss him like crazy,'' said Nick
Webster, Philharmonic director.
   ``His greatest influence was as a performer,'' said
composer-conductor Leon Kirchner, emeritus professor at Harvard.
``There were simply hundreds of kids who went to Tanglewood. He had
a very profound sense of musical structure, of the marvelous
meanings of musical symbols. He was able to translate them make
them intelligible to young people.''
   Pianist Jerome Lowenthal, who had played Bernstein's ``Age of
Anxiety'' with Bernstein conducting, said: ``Bernstein related to
this music. He was a very tortured man and you just had to have a
word with him to know that, and at the same time he managed to be
embarrassingly charming. ... His success just exacerbated the
torture. He suffered from the pressures of superstardom.''

   Following are excerpts of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reaction to being selected Monday for the Nobel Peace
Prize. He spoke in an interview with Soviet television and several
foreign TV stations, and his remarks were translated from Russian
by The Associated Press:
   ---
   The first thing I'd like to say is to confirm the news. It's
quite true. I was just now receiving the ambassador of Norway and
he informed me about the decision of the Nobel Committee about
awarding the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize and that this decision, as he
said, had a definite motivation ...
   Well, what shall I say? Words fail one at such moments. I am
moved. Nevertheless, I'll try to do it. First of all, I am deeply
touched as a person, moved by this decision. I perceive this action
of the most authoritative organization of the global community
first of all not in personal terms, but as recognition of the
significance of the immense cause of perestroika for the destiny of
the entire world. I think that was what was crucial for the final
decision in that committee, which is so serious as we know. They
always take sound decisions. ...
   Secondly, when we were starting our perestroika we thought and
above all we wanted at that time to be understood correctly, to be
understood above all in the sense that we ourselves need
perestroika. We came to the conclusion that we could not continue
to live as we had lived, that we needed deep transformations in all
spheres of life, and that it was the will of the people ... to
develop our policies and to act. But even then we wanted to be
understood correctly, in that what we were going to do would have
vast significance for all countries, for the entire world because
it was happening in such a huge country as the Soviet Union, which
plays a great role and bears on its shoulders a great
responsibility to the world community.

<TEXT>
   A series of chain-reaction accidents
involving more than 20 cars, including one carrying ammunition,
slammed into each other today on a smoky, fog-shrouded highway. At
least a dozen people were injured, police said.
   Bullets exploded when the car carrying ammunition caught fire,
state police said.
   ``It was no major thing, no big explosion, just some rounds
popping off,'' said Sgt. Joe Lentini.
   No one was injured by the bullets, but emergency workers said at
least 12 to 15 people hurt in the chain-reaction crash shortly
before 8 a.m. were taken to a hospital near New Orleans.
   ``I don't know how many. We transported so many I quit
counting,'' said David Bell, an ambulance worker.
   Cars, pickups and larger trucks littered a mile-long stretch of
the Lafitte-Larose highway about five miles south of New Orleans.
   The fog was so thick state police cars crept toward the scene
with two troopers walking in front of the cars to guide them,
Lentini said.
   State Trooper Ernest Dykes said smoke from marsh fires
apparently set by deer hunters contributed to the hazard posed by
the fog.
   ``It was foggy but what made it so bad is the hunters are
burning the marsh. They do that to make the deer move out so they
can shoot them. It was real thick,'' complained David Dumestre, an
emergency medical worker.
   Dykes said the practice is illegal but some hunters burn the
marshes anyway.
   Visibility was so bad, Dykes said, that he could feel the heat
from the burning car containing the ammunition, but couldn't see it
from 20 feet away.

<HEAD>Ambassador Says Israelis Have No Need to Fear United Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Germany's first ambassador to the Jewish
state presented his credentials to the president today and assured
Israelis they had nothing to fear from Germany's unification.
   Otto von der Gablentz, 60, was the first ambassador accredited
to a foreign country since unification Oct. 3, German officials
said.
   Von der Gablentz said that his country would never forget the
Holocaust, nor Germany's historic responsibility to the Jewish
people.
   Israelis have expressed concern that a unified Germany would
dominate Europe and forget its responsibility for the Jewish people
over the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were killed.
   ``Israel has no reason to be sad about the disappearance of East
Germany. It has good reasons to trust the feeling of responsibilty
which we have felt in Germany for our past,'' he said on Israel
radio.
   ``I have deep respect for the feelings of Israelis,'' he said,
adding the Nazi horrors of World War II would be remembered in a
united Germany.
   President Chaim Herzog, who received the new ambassador at his
residence in Jerusalem, said that he was not sorry that East
Germany had ceased to exist.
   ``I cannot mourn the disappearance of East Germany, which was a
hostile nation toward Israel, which was a center for the Palestine
Liberation Organization and a center for terror in Europe against
Israel and other nations,'' Herzog said.
   Before German unification, West Germany was a valuable ally of
Israel, often defending the Jewish state in the international
arena. It paid more than $40 billion in reparations to Israel and
Holocaust victims around the world.

   Dr. John Gibbs, the hospital's director of medical affairs,
acknowledged finances played a role in the decision to change
surgeons. ``Most of his (Montesinos') patients weren't covered
under the DRGs,'' he said. ``The resource utilization was high -
the amount of (blood) pump time, a lot of X-rays, and the resources
of the hospital.''
   Hospitals now must go to considerable lengths to get rid of
financially rebellious doctors, but some fear it soon will become
much easier.
   Some medical consultants and attorneys suggest rewriting
hospital bylaws to permit ``financial credentialing.'' This would
allow review committees to consider doctors' economic profiles,
including the profitability of their patients, when deciding
whethr to allow them to admit patients.
   Others worry doctors will shortchange their patients if they are
forced to put the hospitals' interests first. Said the AMA's Lang:
``When you base medical staff privileges on economic criteria
unrelated to quality, you are setting up a situation where the
patient can be harmed.''

<HEAD>Garbo Collection Expected to Net Millions at Auction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The art collection of Hollywood legend Greta Garbo
is expected to raise around $24 million when it comes up for
auction in London and New York next month.
   The main part of the Swedish-born star's collection, including
three Renoir paintings and one by Pierre Bonnard, come under the
hammer at Sotheby's in New York in November.
   The second part will be sold at their London auction house in
December.
   The top item for sale is Renoir's ``Leontine Et Coco,'' painted
in 1909, which is expected to fetch up to $9 million.
   Garbo, who died in April at the age of 84, conquered Hollywood
between the wars and then rejected the film industry after making
``Two Faced Woman'' in 1941.
   She became a mysterious recluse, but continued to collect art,
antiques and furniture and her New York apartment became an
Aladdin's cave of treasures.
   She left her entire fortune to her niece, Gray Reisfield, who
she described as ``my dearest living relative'' and who will
receive all proceeds from the auction.

   Twelve people were killed Monday in
accidents involving the manufacture of firecrackers for this week's
Hindu ``Festival of Lights,'' a news agency reported.
   A one-year-old boy, his mother and 90-year-old grandfather were
killed by an explosion at an unlicensed fireworks factory in the
south Indian vilage of Villupuram, Press Trust of India said.
   The boy's father, who owned the factory, was badly injured.
   A second firecracker accident in Villupuram, 85 miles south of
Madras, killed three adults and a child, Press Trust said.
   In New Delhi, three teen-agers were burned to death while making
firecrackers, the news agency said.
   In Lucknow, 250 miles southeast of New Delhi, two people were
burned to death and three others were seriously injured when fire
broke out in a firecracker shop, Press Trust said.
   Throughout the country, illegal backroom factories are making
firecrackers for Thursday's celebration of Diwali, the Hindu
festival marking the day when Lord Rama returned home victorious
from battle and was crowned king.
   Fatal accidents are common at this time of year when people
prepare to celebrate with firecrackers, fireworks and by stringing
colored lights around their homes.

   A bus loaded with passengers hit a freight train,
killing 19 people and seriously injuring 16 others, an official
report said.
   The bus plowed into the freight train, which was carrying coal,
at a railroad crossing in Xiaoyi county, in eastern China's Shanxi
province. The report in the Sunday edition of the Shanghai-based
Wenhui Daily was seen in Beijing on Monday.
   It was the first report in the official press of the Saturday
morning accident. China's official media seldom report accidents
unless they are too serious to ignore or involve foreigners.
   The report said 12 people on the bus were killed instantly. It
did not say how many passengers the bus was carrying, how fast the
vehicles were travelling, or who was at fault. Most railroad
crossings in China are unmarked or poorly marked.

   Six seconds was all it took to flatten eight
12-story apartment buildings in northern England.
   The dilapidated buildings engulfed a half-mile area in dust and
debris Sunday as the Controlled Demolition Group reduced the
buildings to 50,000 tons of rubble.
   The firm said it would submit its demolition by explosives to
the Guinness Book of Records as the largest in Britain.
   It won't surpass the world's largest demolition by explosives,
though. That record belongs to the company that blasted the
21-story Traymore Hotel in Atlantic City in 1972.
   Controlled Demolition Group director Richard Van said it took
two months to lay the 6,000 explosives that destroyed the high-rise
apartments.
   The buildings, built in 1968 and containing 492 apartments, had
become a haven for criminals and the local authority in Salford,
165 miles northwest of London, said it would be less expensive to
start anew.
   The apartment blocks will be replaced on the 22-acre site by a
$58 million government-aided development of nearly 500 private
apartments and houses with a leisure center.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Free-Speech Arguments, Supports Obscenity
Crackdown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court turned aside free-speech
arguments Monday and boosted the federal government's crackdown on
obscenity.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand the forced
closing of three adult bookstores and nine video rental shops in
Virginia under a federal anti-racketeering law.
   The businesses' owners, convicted of racketeering and selling
obscene materials, had argued that the subsequent seizures of their
properties violated their free-speech rights.
   The seizures were carried out under provisions of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Those convicted
under that law may be forced to forfeit all assets and proceeds
stemming from their illegal activity.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear the business owners'
appeal, but four votes are needed to grant such review.
   In other action Monday, the court:
   -Rejected the appeal of a former Air Force sergeant convicted in
Washington state of aggravated assault for engaging in homosexual
conduct while knowingly infected with an AIDS-related virus.
   -Set aside a Minnesota man's federal conviction for burning an
American flag during a 1988 demonstration in Minneapolis. The
justices told a federal appeals court to reconsider the conviction
in light of their decision last June that flag burning is protected
political speech.
   -Refused to let Texas, and by extension other states as well,
ban deceptive advertising by airlines. The justices let stand an
appeals court ruling that only the federal government may regulate
airline ads.
   -Unanimously ruled in a Georgia case that state officials need
federal clearance, under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, before
holding elections for state judgeships.
   -Refused to revive a copyright lawsuit against the publisher of
an unauthorized biography of L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the
Scientology religion.
   -Turned down the appeal of two Peotone, Ill., policemen who said
they were disciplined unlawfully for wearing earrings while off
duty.
   In the obscenity and racketeering case, the Virginia bookstore
and video rental shop owners are the first ever prosecuted on
racketeering charges stemming entirely from obscenity crimes.
   Obscenity was added in 1984 to the long list of underlying
crimes on which a RICO prosecution could be based.
   ``The court's determination of the validity of post-judgment
forfeiture in this case will have enormous impact upon the future
of RICO obscenity prosecutions, both state and federal,'' lawyers
for the convicted business owners said.
   Dennis and Barbara Pryba, owners of the corporations that
operated the bookstores and video shops in northern Virginia, were
convicted of selling and distributing obscene magazines and
videotapes worth about $105.
   An employee, Jennifer Williams, also was convicted on obscenity
charges.
   Dennis Pryba was sentenced to three years in prison and five
years probation, and was fined $75,000. Barbara Pryba was given a
suspended prison sentence and fined $200,000. Ms. Williams was
given three years probation and fined $2,250.
   One of the corporations the Prybas owned also was fined
$200,000.
   After a separate jury trial, a federal judge ordered that all
assets - including corporate stock, inventory, bank accounts,
automobiles and even office furniture - be forfeited.
   The convictions and forfeiture order was upheld by the 4th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals last April.
   In their appeal, the Prybas and Williams said forfeiture of
businesses engaged in constitutionally protected activities - the
distribution of materials not found to be obscene - amounts to an
impermissible ``prior restraint'' of speech.
   The Bush administration urged the justices to reject the appeal.
   ``If bookstores, newsstands, publishing houses and the like were
immune from forfeiture, drug lords and other racketeers could
invest in those businesses and thereby insulate their criminal
proceeds from seizure,'' government lawyers argued.

<HEAD>Judge Issues Arrest Warrant For One In TV Dog Fight Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge issued an arrest warrant today for
a man accused of staging a dogfight for a KCNC-TV reporter who was
filming a series on pit-bull fighting that has cost the reporter
her job.
   Jefferson County District Judge Gaspar Perricone issued the
warrant for Guy Walker, who faces two counts of dog fighting, after
Walker failed to appear at a court hearing. Walker's lawyer,
Antonio Lucero, said his client could not find transportation.
   The other three defendants in the case - former KCNC reporter
Wendy Bergen and former station photographers Scott Wright and Jim
Stair - appeared before Perricone with their lawyers.
   The fights allegedly were staged for Bergen's televised series,
``Blood Sport,'' an expose of underground dog fighting that was
broadcast during the May ratings ``sweeps'' period.
   Bergen, who was indicted on nine felony charges, is accused of
arranging the fights, paying for them, lying about the source of
the videotape, lying to KCNC management and encouraging a friend to
lie to the grand jury.
   She had claimed the tape was sent to her anonymously. She and
the two photographers resigned from KCNC.
   Perricone scheduled a hearing for Dec. 14 and a tentative trial
date of Feb. 4.
   The judge denied defense motions to bar cameras from the
courtroom.
   Bergen spoke only briefly at the hearing, saying only ``Yes, I
do,'' when asked if she understood her rights and the charges
against her.
   Bergen's lawyers said earlier they plan to challenge evidence
obtained from her through the use of an informant wired with a
hidden microphone.
   Bergen allegedly talked freely with Mark J. Labriola, a friend
who had told Bergen that he had connections with dog fighters and
who was wearing a microphone. Labriola, who admitted helping Bergen
stage several dogfights, had made a deal with prosecutors granting
him immunity from prosecution.
   Defense attorneys contend that it was improper for prosecutors
to send in their ``agent'' with a hidden microphone after Bergen's
attorney prevented prosecutors from directly asking her certain
questions.
   Neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys will discuss their
legal strategy, but a challenge is expected because Jefferson
County prosecutors elicited damaging statements from Bergen with
Labriola's hidden tape recorder.
   A disciplinary rule in the attorney's code says lawyers should
not contact a defendant directly or through an agent - such as
Labriola - once the defendant is represented by counsel.
   The defendants were indicted in September on 15 felony charges
for allegedly staging pit-bull fights and lying to the grand jury.
   Stair and Wright face charges of accessory to a crime and
conspiracy to commit perjury. Stair also has been indicted on one
count each of dog fighting and conspiracy to commit a dogfight.

<HEAD>Apartheid Law Dismantled, Whites Say They'll Find Loopholes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major apartheid law that
barred blacks from public facilities for decades was formally
scrapped Monday, but right-wing whites planned to exploit loopholes
to maintain segregation.
   In a separate development, police said factional fighting left
eight blacks dead as rival groups battled with pistols and knives
at a migrant workers hostel in Kempton Park, east of Johannesburg.
   The Sunday night battle was the worst single incident since
relative calm was restored to the black townships around
Johannesburg three weeks ago.
   The demise of the Separate Amenities Act, a pillar of South
Africa's apartheid system, did not have noticeable effects in major
cities, where libraries, parks, buses, swimming pools, toilets and
other facilities have been integrated in recent years.
   But in smaller towns controlled by the right-wing Conservative
Party, confrontations were expected between blacks and whites
opposed to the change.
   In the town of Middelburg, east of Johannesburg, white residents
voted to close all public facilities rather than open them to all
races.
   Other towns planned to charge exorbitant fees for
``non-residents.'' Most of the people living inside town limits are
white, while blacks are forced to live outside the town boundaries
under remaining apartheid laws that segregate neighborhoods.
   For example, the town of Bethal planned to charge an annual fee
of $200 to non-residents wishing to use the public library.
   Conservative Party member of Parliament Ferdi Hartzenberg said
the move to scrap the Separate Amenities Act ``destroyed a
considerable part of white people's own community life.''
   Anti-apartheid leaders urged blacks to begin using facilities
and threatened strikes and boycotts against towns trying to
maintain segregation.
   ``Entry to public facilities must be unconditional and free.
What these councils are planning is an illegal act of banditry,''
said African National Congress official Joe Nkuna.
   Hernus Kriel, federal minister of planning and provincial
affairs, warned that towns trying to circumvent the change may face
legal action.
   Parliament repealed the Separate Amenities Act in June and gave
communities until Oct. 15 to comply. The National Party, which has
ruled South Africa since 1948, approved the act in 1953 as part of
its strict segregation politices.
   But since President F.W. de Klerk took office in August 1989 he
has instituted a number of racial reforms, released black leaders
such as Nelson Mandela, and opened talks with the ANC to negotiate
a new constitution giving the black majority a share of power.
   The recent violence in townships around Johannesburg has
strained relations between the government and the ANC, the leading
black opposition movement.
   But de Klerk, who returned from a trip to Portugal and Britain
on Monday, said, ``certain tensions will arise from time to time.''
He said the disagreements were not serious and the peace talks
remained on track.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Inch Upward in August Despite 2.1 Percent
Sales Gain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories inched upward 0.5 percent
in August despite a 2.1 percent gain in sales, the government said
Monday. Analysts said that while the imbalance bears watching, it
was not at a dangerous level.
   Analysts watch for signs of undue inventory growth during
periods of economic weakness because unusually large backlogs could
cause production cutbacks and loss of jobs, adding even more stress
to the economy.
   Some analysts believe the economy is headed toward a recession
this year if it is not already in one.
   But Michael Boskin, President Bush's chief economic adviser,
told an American Stock Exchange conference Monday he expected the
economy to skirt a downturn.
   ``Even though it is particularly difficult to forecast the
short-term course of the economy ... by our best estimate the
economy is going to grow weakly in the fourth quarter of 1990 and
early 1991,'' he said. ``I do believe the third quarter data ...
will show that the economy continued to grow.''
   The Commerce Department said inventories held on shelves and
backlots in August totaled a seasonally adjusted $806.5 billion, up
from $802.2 billion the previous month.
   But the 0.5 percent gain in August slowed slightly from a 0.7
percent increase in July, which had been the largest since an 0.8
percent advance in July 1989.
   At the same time, the department said sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted $551.9 billion, up from $540.4 billion in July. July sales
had declined a revised 0.4 percent rather than the 0.5 percent
first reported last month.
   The activity pushed the ratio of inventories to sales down to
1.46 from a 1.48 level in July. The ratio means it would take 1.46
months to exhaust the backlog of goods at the August sales pace.
   The increased inventories ``is another indicator, a sign of a
troubled economy,'' said Thomas Runiewicz, an economist with the
WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   But he also noted that industry has ``become much more efficient
in terms of managing inventories and keeping them low'' and that
the situation is not as critical as it would have been a few years
ago.
   Nevertheless, backlogs grew in all major business categories.
Retail inventories were up 1.3 percent to $239.5 billion.
Manufacturers posted a 0.2 percent gain to $373.9 billion and
wholesalers registered a 0.3 percent advance to $193.0 billion.
   At the same time, manufacturing sales were up 3.4 percent to
$245.9 billion, while wholesalers listed a 2.6 percent increase to
$156.4 billion.
   Retail sales, on the other hand, dropped 0.4 percent to $149.6
billion.
   The department reported last Friday that retail sales rebounded
1.1 percent in September, driven largely by automobile purchases
and surging gasoline prices.
   But economists said the two special factors masked an otherwise
weak report, which included a large decline in department store
sales. Excluding gasoline and autos, sales rose only 0.1 percent
last month.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday killed a copyright
lawsuit over an unauthorized biography of L. Ron Hubbard, founder
of the Scientology religion.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a decision throwing out
allegations of copyright infringement against the book's publisher.
   Hubbard, who died in 1986, published nearly 600 fiction and
non-fiction works during his lifetime, 111 of which are in print.
   The exclusive holder of worldwide publishing rights to his
published non-fiction works and his unpublished works is New Era
Publications International.
   According to New Era's 1989 lawsuit, it plans to publish a
biography of Hubbard that will draw on both his published and
unpublished works.
   New Era sued after learning that Carol Publishing Group planned
to publish a book by Jonathan Caven-Atack entitled ``A Piece of
Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed.''
   After determining that Caven-Atack's book contained
``substantial quotation'' from Hubbard's works, U.S. District Judge
Louis Stanton in New York City ordered Carol Publishing not to
release the book.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May reversed
Stanton's ruling. The appeals court said the book's use of
copyright material amounted to ``fair use'' and was not illegal.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today accused the
international community of hypocrisy and said Israel would not pay
the price of the West's problems in the Arab world.
   He repeated his warning to Iraq that Israel would hit back if
attacked, and warned it against intervening in Jordan, which
borders on Israel and is seen from Jerusalem as a buffer against
Iraqi attack.
   ``Any intervention in the situation there, or intervention in
its territory by another state, is likely to raise the tension, the
dangers, to levels we cannot accept,'' Shamir said.
   Shamir's speech opening the fall session of Parliament reflected
deep bitterness over the world's reaction to the killing of 19
Palestinians on the Temple Mount.
   But he stopped short of directly attacking the United States,
Israel's chief military and financial backer, for siding with
Israel's critics in the U.N. Security Council.
   Shamir complained in censuring Israel's use of force against
Moslem rioters at the Temple Mount, the world body ignored Israel's
argument that it was provoked by stones thrown at Jewish worshipers
at the adjacent Western Wall.
   ``What stood out was the absence of any mention of the grave
attack on the Jewish people's holiest place,'' he said.
   Shamir said that when terrorists killed Israeli tourists in
Egypt, or when hundreds of Moslems died in riots at the Saudi
Arabian holy city of Mecca, ``We didn't hear similar denunciations,
and we did not see the Security Council being convened.''
   Israel was ``expected to put up with the renewed and massive
supply of arms of advanced weapons to those states, to agree to
negotiations with the terrorist organizations, and to ignore the
words of incitement and hatred that are constantly voiced and
written in the Arab states.''
   ``Each time, reality comes and slaps anew the faces of those of
who hold with theories of moderation, and confirms our fears and
assertions,'' he said, adding:
   ``But the lesson is not learned. At any rate, Israel will not
pay the price of the lessons that the international community must
extract from this gloomy reality.''
   Israeli officials have objected strongly to the argument that
the United States had to back an anti-Israel resolution in the
Security Council in order to preserve Arab support for U.S. action
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   A senior official, speaking anonymously, said: ``We are not
prepared to be the sacrificial lamb of the anti-Saddam coalition.''
   Left-wing Israeli parties said they would mount a challenge in
Parliament to try to reverse the Cabinet's rejection of a U.N.
investigation into tee Temple Mount killings.
   But even with the support of the Labor Party, the main
opposition, the motion would have difficulty overcoming the 62-seat
majority of Shamir's right-wing coalition in the 120-member
parliament.
   The Security Council voted unanimously Friday to condemn the
Oct. 8 shootings on the Temple Mount, a site revered by both Jews
and Moslems. Arabs call it Haram al-Sharif.
   The United Nations also authorized its own three-man
investigation team.
   In rejecting the U.N. mission Sunday, Israel defied both the
United Nations and the United States, which sent a message asking
Israel to accept the mission.
   The daily Yedioth Ahronoth reported that in the message,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III suggested Israel's refusal to
accept the U.N. team could further distract world attention from
internatinal efforts to solve the gulf crisis.
   Israel also defied the United States on a second issue,
announcing a new housing plan for Soviet immigrants that ignores
American pleas not to settle them in war-won territory.
   Six of the eight new residential communities are to be in east
Jerusalem on territory captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967
Middle East war and annexed.
   The decision was designed to reinforce Israel's claims to the
city.
   ``The heart of the Jewish people needs to expand faster,'' said
Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, who heads a Cabinet committee on
immigration. ``There is no better answer to the political dangers
than strengthening the Jewish population.''
   His committee decided to build about 5,000 apartments in the
coming year and to ask for sweeping incentives for contractors to
build in Jerusalem, including the eastern sector, said Absorption
Ministry spokeswoman Ida Ben-Shitreet.

   For enthusiasts, roller coasters are a
magic remedy for life's ups and downs.
   ``You can't be distracted on a roller coaster,'' explained
Liucija Ambrosini, a 44-year-old Chicago teacher, as she waited in
line for another coaster ride at Six Flags Magic Mountain.
   Ms. Ambrosini was among 200 members of the American Coaster
Enthusiasts club who rode the park's ``Big Four'' coasters during a
weekend white-knuckler bash in Southern California. The
2,000-member group's annual convention also included a visit to the
65-year-old Giant Dipper in San Diego.
   Biggest, fastest, scariest: Those are the qualities that attract
roller-coaster fans. And once is never enough.
   ``My husband and I will ride a really good roller coaster 30 or
40 times,'' Ms. Ambrosini said.
   She has ridden more than 300 coasters as far away as Canada,
England and Japan.
   Roller-coaster popularity peaked in the 1920s when more than
1,500 were in operation in the United States. Lack of maintenance,
the ravages of nature and park closures left only 147 coasters in
North America by 1978, according to the coaster club.
   But that trend has reversed, leading some enthusiasts to predict
a second golden age for ``negative gravity.''
   There will be 203 coasters in operation by year's end, with 17
new, moved or renovated ones opening this year alone, the club
said.

   Tom King plans to marry Vivian Taylor
this Saturday. Right after the ceremony, he'll jump off a bridge.
   King is one of 300 parachuting daredevils who plan to leap off
North America's second-highest bridge 876 feet into the New River
Gorge, a canyon slicing through the heart of the Appalachians.
   The wedding, on the New River Gorge Bridge, falls on the 11th
annual Bridge Day. That's the one day a year the span is closed to
traffic so pedestrians can enjoy the view and the autumn foliage -
and parachutists can jump off.
   The event attracts the largest number of parachutists who belong
to the U.S. BASE Association. BASE stands for building, antenna,
span and earth.
   ``For most of the jumpers, this is it,'' said Jean Boenish,
BASE's executive director. ``They take their vacation time, save
their pennies and wait to get out to West Virginia.''
   The U.S. 19 bridge, completed in 1977, is the longest steel arch
bridge in the world and the second highest in North America, after
the 1,053-foot Royal Gorge Bridge in Colorado.
   About 100,000 spectators are expected, said Cindy Whitlock of
the Fayette County Chamber of Commerce. Hotels have been booked for
months in Fayette County and are selling out fast in Raleigh and
Kanawha counties, Whitlock said.
   King, 39, a real estate agent in Memphis, Tenn., brought Taylor
to Bridge Day last year and ``she literally loved the place.''
   ``I fell in love with her. She fell in love with me. She fell in
love with the bridge,'' he said.
   ``It seemed logical at the time'' to plan a wedding there, King
said.
   Taylor, 34, a registered nurse, said the wedding will be as
traditional as it can be on a bridge. She will wear a gown, the
groom will wear a tuxedo, and there will be five bridesmaids and
groomsmen.
   After the ceremony, King, two groomsmen and a few guests will
leap off the bridge. Taylor said that for her, just watching is
enough. She called last year's experience ``a natural high you just
can't explain.''
   But King, a veteran skydiver, said there's nothing to worry
about, even though three people have been killed in leaps from the
bridge, two during Bridge Day festivities. The last death was in
1987.
   ``It's fun. It's a sport. It's challenging,'' King said. ``We
don't think it's dangerous. Nothing's dangerous if you know what
you're doing.''
   Boenish said most BASE jumpers are trained skydivers. She
described the experience:
   ``As soon as you jump off, you're kind of suspended, and then
you start falling, and you get through that and what you start to
get into is that familiar comfort of high air speed.''
   King describes the bridge jump as ``high anxiety followed by
total euphoria.''
   ``The jump itself is extremely nerve-racking, but as soon as the
parachute opens and everything's OK, it's beautiful,'' he said.
   The jumpers leap from the bridge's center and fall at speeds
nearing 60 mph before slowing down to land on a sandbar, Boenish
said.
   Parachutists were prohibited from taking the plunge last year
because the river, which is also popular with white-water rafters,
was running dangerously high following heavy rain. But about three
dozen jumpers went off the bridge anyway and a few were arrested.
   The river under the bridge is under federal jurisdiction as the
New River Gorge National River. While BASE jumping is banned from
federal properties like Half Dome in Yosemite National Park, no one
will be banned from jumping into the gorge this year if conditions
are favorable, National Park Service Chief Ranger Bill Blake said.
   But parachutists who jump when it's not legal face up to six
months in prison, a$$5,000 fine, and would be banned for life from
jumping off the New River bridge, Blake said.
   Boenish expects 300 jumpers from six countries, including
Australia and South Africa.

   More than 40,000 children under the age of
five die every day from malnutrition and infection, despite
increases in the worldwide supply of food, a hunger relief group
said Monday.
   Children are among 500 million people suffering from hunger,
most of them living in poor, developing nations in Asia, Africa and
Latin America, according to the report issued by Bread for the
World. The group works to eliminate hunger.
   A major cause of hunger is disruptions caused by wars and
fighting in many nations: Afghanistan, Angola, Cambodia, Ethiopia,
Sudan, Mozambique and Liberia, to name a few.
   Art Simon, the group's president, said Bread hoped to encourage
countries to slow down military spending and direct the money to
feeding the hungry.
   ``The billions we have spent to arm developing countries now
haunts us, especially since that money could have been used to meet
the world's nutritional needs,'' he said.
   Many deaths of children could be prevented if food and medical
treatment were available, he said.
   Although the Third World has the greatest number of hungry
people, developed nations like the United States are not immune
from the problem, the report said.
   Despite its record agricultural productivity, as many as 18
million Americans are without the proper nutrients that promote
good health and growth. Of these, some 8 million are children and 2
million are over the age of 65, the report said.
   A disproportionate number of hungry people are black, Indian or
Hispanic. The South is more affected than any other region.
   More than two-thirds of America's hungry live in metropolitan
areas, but the poverty rate in rural areas is growing faster that
in urban areas, the report said.
   In an overview of conditions around the world, the report said
Africa is the region of greatest concern. Much of the continent is
characterized by famine, declining per capita food production and
collapsing social services.
   Of the 550 million people on the continent, some 200 million are
hungry or vulnerable to hunger, the report said. Dislocations
caused by war and environmental degradation have created hundreds
of thousands of refugees on the continent.
   Asia has seen its food production increase in the last 30 years
as a result in part of the technologies of the Green Revolution.
Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and China have
made great strides to reduce hunger.
   But other countries have not fared as well. Hunger and poverty
persist in places such as the Philippines, Nepal, Bangladesh and
Sri Lanka.
   In Latin America, poverty and hunger are at greater levels in
1990 than they were in 1980. The average per capita income dropped
in the first years of the decade as countries on the continent
struggled to service burgeoning debt payments.

   The Supreme Court refused Monday to help
states ban deceptive advertising by airlines.
   The court, without comment, left intact a ruling that only the
federal government may regulate airline ads.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in April that Texas
officials lack the authority to take action against allegedly
misleading airline ads.
   The appals court, which normally only has jurisdiction in
Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana, said its April ruling also was
binding on the 33 other states that supported Texas.
   The 33 states, in a separate appeal, said the appeals court
exceeded its authority.
   The states are Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Maine,
Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska,
Nevada, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington,
West Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
   The case stems from an effort by Texas officials to bar
allegedly false advertising by TWA, Continental and British
Airways.
   Texas officials said the airlines misled consumers, making it
appear they were offering lower fares than competitors by
prominently advertising the ticket price and only mentioning
additional taxes, surcharges and fees in the small print.

<HEAD>Mondale Name Not Enough To Guarantee Win in Minnesota</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Ted Mondale isn't banking on his famous
name to get him elected to the Minnesota Legislature. The son of
the former vice president plans to spend a record $120,000
campaigning for the state Senate.
   Mondale, 33, is running against Republican incumbent Phyllis
McQuaid, who questions not only his judgment but also his motives.
   ``We're always hearing that people are being turned off by
big-spending campaigns,'' McQuaid said. ``It makes you wonder
what's going on.''
   State GOP Chairman Bob Weinholzer thinks he knows.
   ``Obviously, he's in this race to eventually run for higher
office,'' Weinholzer said. Mondale moved to the district only about
a year and a half ago and he's raised more than a third of his
campaign money from outside Minnesota.
   ``It's almost absurd,'' Weinholzer said of the out-of-state
contributions. ``For a state Senate race, we've never seen anything
like that.''
   Mondale is the only state Senate candidate on the Nov. 6 ballot
who did not agree to abide by a voluntary $40,669 spending limit.
The current record is $93,000 spent by another Democrat in a 1986
state Senate race.
   ``He's a new candidate running against an established incumbent
in a district that's marginally Republican,'' said Senate
Democratic Majority Leader Roger Moe.
   ``He thinks he needs more, and I'm in no position to question
his judgment.''
   Mondale, a lawyer and lobbyist, refers to his Republican
critics' comments as the ``politics of diversion.''
   ``I don't want to stay in the state Legislature all my life,''
he said. ``It is a citizen legislature, and many times incumbents
stay in too long and lose touch with their constituents. If I do a
good job at the Legislature ... then perhaps there would be an
opportunity'' to serve in higher office.
   McQuaid, 62, agreed to abide by the spending limit. But because
Mondale isn't abiding by it, McQuaid is allowed to exceed the limit
and receive a public subsidy. She had raised $38,509 through August
and will receive an $18,000 subsidy. Mondale had raised about
$98,000 during the same period and had spent $83,360.
   ``There isn't another state Senate race with a candidate who has
his name ID,'' McQuaid said. ``That alone should give him a
10-point start over any other challenger.
   ``It's unfortunate he's doing this,'' she said of his campaign
spending.
   McQuaid says she's pleased with the campaign outlook and that
results from internal polls look ``very good'' for her. Mondale
said he believes the race is close.
   Mondale said the advantages of being the son of former Vice
President and U.S. Senator Walter F. Mondale don't guarantee
electoral success.
   ``My father served this state and nation well,'' he said. ``But
just being a Mondale does not win an election. I equate being the
son or daughter of a famous person, or of anyone, much like being a
woman in the workplace. People expect more of you, and you have to
be twice as good as the other person to gain acceptance.''
   Mondale said he won't ``unilaterally disarm'' by limiting
campaign spending in a system that favors incumbents. And he said

   McQuaid highlights her record as state senator, mayor and school
board member and her involvement with community groups.
   Mondale said McQuaid has been an ineffective legislator and has
not proposed an agenda for the '90s.
   ``I hope the comparison will be made between where I want to go
and where she's been over the last eight years,'' Mondale said.
``If that's the comparison, I'll win. If the question is, who's
lived here longer and been to more bake sales, Phyllis McQuaid will
win.''

<HEAD>Thornburgh Overruled Aides in Awarding Ex-Employee $25,000</HEAD>

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh went against
career Justice Department lawyers in agreeing to pay $25,000 to a
former department official who was investigated in the alleged
disclosure of government secrets, say sources familiar with the
case.
   A senior career department attorney who reviewed the case of the
official, political appointee Roger Pilon, concluded there was
sufficient evidence to have justified his firing and therefore he
was not entitled to reimbursement for legal expenses, according to
a memo to Thornburgh obtained by The Associated Press.
   But the attorney general overruled those findings and instead
authorized a settlement with Pilon, who had headed the Asylum
Policy and Review Unit.
   Several top officials strongly disagreed with Thornburgh,
according to sources familiar with the issue who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer, who wrote the memo to
Thornburgh, resigned in May - partially because of the attorney
general's handling of the matter.
   The dispute began in 1988, when Pilon was investigated by the
FBI in connection with an allegation that his wife, Juliana, had
disclosed a classified State Department document to a South African
diplomat. The document analyzed communist involvement in black
nationalist movements opposed to the South African government.
   Both Pilons have denied any wrongdoing, and Mrs. Pilon has said
she did not pass on any classified material.
   Prosecutors declined to press charges against the couple and
turned the matter over to the Justice Department's Office of
Professional Responsibility for a review of Pilon's conduct.
   Pilon was placed on paid leave during the investigation by the
FBI and the department's career-staffed internal watchdog unit.
   He later was reinstated by Associate Deputy Attorney General Dee
V. Benson, who said in a Sept. 9, 1988, letter to Pilon that ``no
implication adverse to you should be taken from the
investigations.''
   Several weeks later, Pilon resigned to become a fellow at a
conservative research organization.
   Last November, the Office of Professional Responsibility
released its 1988 annual report that alluded to Pilon's case
without naming him.
   The report said that a foreign counterintelligence investigation
indicated that an employee ``may have been involved in the
disclosure of classified information to a foreign government.''
   While evidence did not warrant prosecution, the report said, the
investigation had found ``sufficient cause to terminate'' the
official's appointment and said ``the employee resigned prior to
the initiation of removal proceedings.''
   Pilon, who told reporters that the report did refer to his case,
quickly demanded an apology from the department, asked for payment
of his legal fees and threatened to sue for character defamation.
   Thornburgh then asked Ayer to investigate Pilon's demands. Ayer
assigned the case to career Justice Department lawyer Lawrence S.
Robbins, who at the time worked in the solicitor general's office.
   Robbins, according to a Jan. 24 memo from Ayer to Thornburgh,
found that Pilon had been reinstated despite ``sufficient evidence
to justify Pilon's dismissal.''
   The memo obtained by the AP did not detail any evidence Robbins
cited in his classified report.
   Robbins also found, according to Ayer's memo, that OPR had not
been told of Pilon's reinstatement and thus could not be faulted
for saying the employee had ``resigned prior to the initiation of
removal proceedings.''
   Ayer recommended that Pilon not be compensated for his legal
expenses.
   Sometime after receiving the memo, Thornburgh decided to award
Pilon the $25,000 and to issue a formal apology for the wording of
the OPR report.
   Ayer, who now refuses to comment, said after he resigned in May
that Thornburgh had tried to use ``the matter,'' which he did not
identify by name, to discredit OPR and its head, Michael E. Shaheen
Jr., himself a career official.
   Ayer also contended that Thornburgh had been trying to undermine
Shaheen as his office was seeking to investigate two of the
attorney general's closest aides on an unrelated matter.
   Acting at Thornburgh's direction, Assistant Attorney General
Stuart M. Gerson in July wrote Matthew L. Myers, Pilon's attorney,
that the couple were entitled to an apology because ``the 1988
investigation of Mr. Pilon did not produce any evidence sufficient
to warrant his dismissal from the department.''
   That letter also referred to ``confusion created'' by the 1988
OPR report and said that Pilon had been ``restored
unconditionally'' to his position and that ``his subsequent
resignation was self-initiated and was not made in the face of
removal proceedings (which in fact never had been contemplated or
ordered).''
   The letter said the department was awarding the $25,000 to
settle Pilon's complaint.
   Justice Department spokesman Daniel Eramian now refuses to
comment on the Pilon issue, except to say that ``we stand by the
report'' issued by Gerson.
   Pilon, in an interview, said his decision to resign played no
part in his reinstatement by the department.
   ``You just don't return a top-secret security clearance, even if
it is for three weeks, if there is evidence that suggests that I
should be terminated,'' Pilon said.

   Since riding the range with cowboy star
Roy Rogers for an upcoming cable special, country music singer
Randy Travis has decided he would like to do a western movie.
   ``If I was going to do something like that, I would be the most
comfortable in a western,'' Travis said recently. ``Like the cattle
drive, that was just a natural thing for me to do. Riding was no
problem and I knew how to work cows; I'd done that before.''
   The cattle drive Travis and Rogers took part in was for ``Randy
Travis - Happy Trails,'' a special recorded for the Nashville
Network cable TV service last summer in Montana.
   The show airs Wednesday and also features country singers Holly
Dunn and Michael Martin Murphy with veteran actor Denver Pyle.
   Rogers is also a partner with Travis on his new album ``Heroes
and Friends.''

   LONDON (AP) - Actress Goldie Hawn says that she would like more
children, even though time is against her.
   ``I'm too old to have another child, but I'd love to have
more,'' Hawn, 44, told ``Woman's Own'' magazine in a story
published Monday.
   ``I love being pregnant and I'd like to be so again. It's doing
exactly what we were meant to do, the way God intended,'' she said.
   Hawn has three children: Oliver, 13, and Kate, 11, from her
former marriage to singer-actor Bill Hudson, and son Wyatt, 4, by
her partner, actor Kurt Russell.
   Hawn also said she would consider plastic surgery if she felt it
was needed.
   ``I'm pretty vain and I like to look good, so if I thought it
would make me feel better about myself then I would use it,'' she
said.

   MODESTO, Calif. (AP) - It was a lot milder than his Lethal
Weapon movies, but police said actor Mel Gibson smashed a camera
when a photographer refused to quit taking pictures.
   Gibson was in the parking lot of a local nightclub, the Easy
Street Lounge, when free-lance photographer Richard Reeves began
snapping photos of him Saturday, police were told.
   According to the police report, Reeves ignored a request to
stop, so Gibson grabbed the camera and smashed it against the
pavement. Gibson then apologized and told Reeves he would pay for
the damaged equipment, valued at $650, witnesses told police. No
arrests were made.
   Gibson reportedly was in this central California city 90 miles
southeast of San Francisco to buy cattle for his Montana ranch.

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Watching the autobiographical
documentary ``Listen Up'' hasn't been easy for producer Quincy
Jones.
   ``When the film was being shot, I had a few bad moments. But
when I first saw the whole thing on the screen, it hit like a
sledgehammer,'' Jones, 57, said in a telephone interview from
Toronto published in the Sunday Tennessean.
   ``I can hardly stand to watch the movie. I may have to see it 10
or 12 times before I will be able to decide whether it's good
technically.''
   The documentary chronicles Jones' career as producer of albums
for Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Miles Davis, Frank Sinatra and
Michael Jackson.
   Jones said the movie forced him to face things he had blanked
out most of his life.
   ``I never did that before. When you see 57 years condensed to an
hour (and) 50 (minutes), it's very dramatic. I never was much of a
husband or father.''

   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - Some were dressed in black tie and
evening gown. Others wore slacks and munched popcorn. But they rose
as one to cheer tenor Luciano Pavarotti into five encores.
   More than 11,000 fans were held spellbound by the 55-year-old
opera great during a two-hour performance Sunday at Thompson-Boling
Arena.
   ``In the 50 stadiums we have been singing in, never have we
found such a beautiful audience,'' Pavarotti said. ``Or such an
incredible smell of popcorn.''

   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Forget those rumors about sour notes
between musicians Rick James and M.C. Hammer.
   Hammer, who borrowed the melody from James' 1982 hit ``Super
Freak'' to create this summer's smash single ``U Can't Touch
This,'' got together with the man he called his idol backstage
before performing Saturday at Buffalo's Memorial Auditorium.
   The stars, who had never met, promised to work with each other
somewhere down the road.
   ``I used to go to your concerts,'' Hammer told James. ``I felt
good using music from a person I idolize. Y'all used to come out
and do a show! Then I'd do my thing at the club to `Super Freak.'''
   ``Keep doing it!'' said James.

   Here is a look at major achievements and failures
of Mikhail S. Gorbachev since he became Soviet leader on March 11,
1985:
   
   FOREIGN POLICY:
   - Switched the basis of foreign policy from a struggle with
capitalist countries to cooperation in fulfilling ``universal human
values,'' such as the desire for peace and a better life.
   - Abandoned the so-called ``Brezhnev Doctrine'' of military
intervention in Communist countries, setting off a wave of
revolutions in Eastern Europe that deposed old-style rulers and
made the Iron Curtain division obsolete.
   - Agreed to let a unified Germany become a member of NATO,
clearing the way for formal unification of the divided nation.
   - Reduced fears of a superpower nuclear war or attack on Europe
or China by holding regular summit meetings with U.S. and Western
European leaders, and by ending a 30-year chill in relations with
China.
   - Cut defense budget and unilaterally pulled 500,000 troops and
10,000 tanks from Europe. Later, in a series of agreements with the
United States and NATO, he promised to remove more troops, tanks
and warplanes from Europe.
   - Agreed with the United States to destroy shorter- and
medium-range nuclear weapons and pursue more arms reductions
agreements; agreed to intrusive verification treaties.
   - Withdrew 115,000 troops from Afghanistan.
   - Stimulated settlement of conflicts in Angola, Namibia,
Cambodia and Nicaragua. Moved to improve ties with Japan, South
Korea and Israel.
   
   DEMOCRATIZATION:
   - Allowed wider freedom of press and assembly, leading to an
explosion of opposition groups, many of which turn to severe
criticism of Gorbachev, his policies and the Communist Party.
Allowed greater freedom of religion and reopening of churches
across the country.
   - Persuaded the Communist Party leadership to end its
constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power, but fails to salvage
its foundering credibility.
   - Created the Soviet Union's first working national legislature
and allowed the Soviet Union's first nationwide competitive
elections in 1989.
   - Won approval from the same legislature for broad new
presidential powers, including the right to impose emergency
economic reforms and suspend republic parliaments.
   - Freed hundreds of political prisoners and largely ended
persecution for political views.
   - Increased the possibility for Soviets to travel to other
countries, but has not yet given the legislature the final version
of a promised law on free entry and exit.
   
   ECONOMIC POLICY:
   - Has failed to improve daily life of ordinary Soviet citizens,
as shortages have worsened and inflation and rationing have
increased. Delayed needed reform of Soviet prices, which have
little relation to actual costs and waste scarce resources.
   - Won parliamentary approval for the leasing of land to
individuals, with the right of inheritance. But has not yet won
approval for the private ownership of land.
   - Eased foreign investment through approval of joint ventures,
but has not approved full foreign ownership of property and
profits.
   - Legalized small private business cooperatives, but failed to
provide them with adequate, legal sources of supplies.
   - Revealed the long-secret Soviet budget deficit, and let it
grow to 90 billion rubles, (about 150 billion at official exchange
rate) this year.
   
   DOMESTIC POLICY:
   - Sent thousands of soldiers into peace-keeping duties in their
own country, but failed to halt ethnic and nationalist conflicts
that have killed some 500 people in the last two years.
   - Agreed to discuss eventual Lithuanian independence with
leaders of the Baltic republic after imposing an economic blockade
over its declaration of independence. Faced similar demands for
independence or sovereignty from most of the 12 other republics,
including Russia.
   - Has failed so far to halt official corruption and the soaring
violent crime rate, although has used broad presidential powers to
order tougher police action.
   - Used his powers to order a crackdown on ``black marketeering''
and demanded state firms fulfill their orders for supplies to state
enterprises.
   - Has failed so far to follow through on promises to improve the
quality of the Soviet Union's polluted water, air and land.
   - Has failed so far to have adequate housing built for the
population, which has suffered from decades of overcrowded living
conditions.

   Shuttle Discovery began
its return trip to Kennedy Space Center today, more than a week
after successfully sending the spacecraft Ulysses on a five-year
mission to explore the sun.
   The shuttle, strapped to the back of a Boeing 747, roared away
from NASA's Dryden Flight Research Facility at 6:44 a.m., NASA
said. The plane planned to refuel at Kelly Air Force Base in San
Antonio, Texas, and was scheduled to arrive in Florida shortly
before sundown.
   The shuttle landed at Edwards early Wednesday. Six hours after
the shuttle was launched from Florida on Oct. 6, it sent Ulysses on
a $750 million mission to study the sun's polar regions.
   The shuttle returned to Edwards Wednesday morning after
launching Ulysses on its $750 million mission.
   Discovery's 1.7 million-mile flight was the first since April -
the longest gap between shuttle missions since they resumed after
the 1986 explosion that destroyed Challenger and killed seven crew
members.
   The flight helped boost morale at the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration, which has been plagued by hydrogen leaks in
the shuttles Columbia and Atlantis.
   The next shuttle flight is scheduled for early November, when
Atlantis will conduct a secret mission for the Pentagon.

   The recent epidemic of mosquito-borne
St. Louis encephalitis has claimed its first victim in Florida, the
state's first death caused by the virus in 13 years, a state health
official said today.
   Alvena Patton, a 58-year-old Brevard County woman who has been
in a coma since Aug. 21, died Saturday, according to Ernie Durfee,
a spokesman for the state Department of Health and Rehabilitative
Services.
   The death rate from St. Louis encephalitis typically is 7
percent. Since mid-August, HRS has confirmed that 34 people across
central and south Florida contracted the illness. One other person
besides Patton has slipped into a coma, Durfee said.
   Symptoms can include headaches and fevers usually associated
with the flu, and coma and death can eventually result from brain
inflammation. In between, people can experience a stiff neck,
tiredness and irritability. Other severe symptoms include extreme
sleepiness, tremors and seizures.
   Eight people died during the last Florida outbreak of St. Louis
encephalitis in 1977. The state usually has one to three cases a
year, Durfee said.
   Patton's husband said his family hopes the death of the West
Melbourne woman will cause residents to take warnings more
seriously.
   ``The county needs to get serious about this virus,'' said Harry
Patton. ``They need to get spray trucks out and try to stop this
thing. I know it costs a lot of money, but people's lives are at
stake.''

   A former Air Force sergeant convicted of
aggravated assault for homosexual conduct while knowingly infected
with an AIDS-related virus lost a Supreme Court appeal Monday.
   The justices, without comment, let stand Nathaniel Johnson Jr.'s
conviction, dishonorable military discharge and six-year prison
sentence.
   Johnson was stationed at McChord Air Force Base in Washington
state when in 1987 he tested positive for the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which is believed to cause acquired
immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.
   AIDS is a contagious disease that attacks the body's immune
system, rendering it incapable of resisting other diseases and
infections. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.
   Johnson was a patient at the Wilford Hall Medical Center at
Lackland Air Force Base in Texas when the Air Force adopted a
policy that held out the possibility of disciplinary action for
HIV-infected military members who did not practice safe sex.
   Lawyers for Johnson say he never was told about the policy.
   After returning to McChord, Johnson engaged in homosexual
conduct with a 17-year-old boy he had met in a Tacoma bar.
   Tried by general court-martial at McChord in early 1988, Johnson
was convicted of consensual sodomy. He also was convicted of
aggravated assault and attempted sodomy. He was sentenced to 10
years in prison.
   The U.S. Air Force Court of Military Review threw out the
attempted consensual sodomy conviction after ruling that the charge
essentially duplicated the aggravated assault charge.
   The court reduced Johnson's sentence to six years, and its
ruling was upheld by the U.S. Court of Military Appeals last April.
   In seeking help from the nation's highest court, lawyers for
Johnson said the portion of the Uniform Code of Military Justice
used to prosecute him for aggravated assault is impermissibly vague
when applied to the possible transmission of a virus.
   They said the offense of aggravated assault never was intended
to be used against someone accused of transmitting a contagious
disease unless there is a clear intent to spread the disease.

   Gen. Michael J. Dugan, fired last month as Air
Force chief of staff for disclosing U.S. contingency plans for war
with Iraq, is working in the Pentagon as an aide to Air Force
Secretary Donald B. Rice, a spokesman said Monday.
   Dugan remains on active duty and has been working as a special
assistant to Rice since shortly after Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
fired Dugan on Sept. 17, said Air Force spokesman Col. Joe Purka.
   The matter of Dugan's status arose after Cheney said during a
radio interview in London on Monday that Dugan is ``no longer in
the Air Force.''
   Cheney was responding to an interviewer's question about whether
the United States would considering targeting Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein with military force as a way of reversing the Iraqi
occupation of Kuwait. Among the remarks made by Dugan that led to
his firing was that U.S. contingency plans included massive air
raids on Baghdad that would target Saddam and his family.
   Cheney said in the interview that U.S. policy forbids targeting
of foreign leaders.
   When reminded of Dugan's statement, Cheney said, ``He's no
longer in the Air Force.''
   Dugan, a 32-year veteran and former fighter pilot, maintains his
rank as four-star general until President Bush formally nominates
him for retirement and the Senate acts on the nomination. Purka
said Bush had not yet made the nomination.
   If the Senate does not act within 90 days of the date of Dugan's
firing, his rank would slip to major general, Purka said. Major
general is two notches below general.
   Bush on Sept. 21 nominated Gen. Merrill A. McPeak to succeed
Dugan as the Air Force's top-ranking officer.
   In his position as special assistant to Rice, Dugan is assessing
the Air Force's system for evaluating officers and is studying how
many pilots and navigators the service will need in the future,
Purka said.
   Purka said Dugan is not accepting news media requests for
interviews.

   Police fired tear gas
Monday at protesters whose opposition to this nation's sole legal
political party has caused the government to close its borders with
three countries.
   The demonstrators were demanding multiparty democracy and
threatened to disrupt the annual congress of President Andre
Kolingba's Central African Democratic Assembly, scheduled to start
Thursday in Berberati. The town is 375 miles west of Bangui.
   Gunshots were heard Monday in several areas of Bangui, where
protesters have set up barricades to impede the departure of ruling
party officials for Berberati. The gunfire was believed to come
from police. No casualties were reported.
   The Ministry of Public Security and Territorial Administration
announced Saturday it was immediately closing the country's borders
with Chad, to the north, Cameroon to the West and Congo to the
south. They will not reopen until the ruling party congress ends on
Oct. 23, the ministry said.
   The border closures seal off land routes to Berberati from
outside the country. This landlocked country's borders with Sudan
to the east and Zaire in the south remain open.
   Kolingba is an army general who took power in a coup on Sept. 1,
1981, seven months after voters in this nation of nearly 3 million
people approved a multiparty constitution. He imposed single-party
rule.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won the 1990
Nobel Peace Prize today for his decisive role in the dramatic
rapprochement between East and West - leadership that helped end
the Cold War, free the East bloc and slow the arms race.
   In awarding the 59-year-old Soviet leader the $700,000 prize,
the Norwegian Nobel Committee also cited him for allowing greater
openness in his homeland.
   Gorbachev said today the prize - the first to a superpower chief
executive since President Woodrow Wilson won in 1919 - recognized
the success of perestroika - his government's reform policies.
   ``Words fail one at such moments. I am moved,'' the official
Soviet news agency Tass quoted Gorbachev as saying.
   ``When we were starting our perestroika,'' Gorbachev said, ``we
knew that it would have vast significance to all countries.'' He
said he will personally accept the award in Oslo.
   In its citation, the Norwegian Nobel Committee said it decided
to give Gorbachev the prize ``for his leading role in the peace
process.''
   The committee noted ``dramatic changes'' have occurred over the
past few years in the relationship between East and West, saying:
``Confrontation has been replaced by negotiations. Old European
nation states have regained freedom. The arms race is slowing down
and we see a definite and active process in the direction of arms
control and disarmament.''
   The committee said several factors played a role in the historic
changes, but this year it was singling out Gorbachev ``for his many
and decisive contributions.''
   ``This peace process,'' the citation said, ``...opens up new
possibilities for the world community to solve its pressing
problems across ideological, religious, historical and cultural
dividing lines.''
   Gidske Anderson, leader of the Nobel Committee, refused to say
if the prize was meant to help Gorbachev stay in power, as the same
domestic policies that have democratized political life also have
led to instability.
   ``If you will read the text you will see we are talking mainly
about international policy,'' Ms. Anderson said.
   ``The big thing that is happening in the world is the
reconciliation of the superpowers. We are very happy to come with a
laureate who has such great significance.''
   Gorbachev is the second Soviet to win the Peace Prize. The first
was nuclear scientist and human rights activist Andrei Sakharov,
who won in 1975. Sakharov, who died in December, could not accept
the award for 14 years - until Gorbachev freed him from internal
exile and allowed him to travel.
   Sakharov's widow Yelena Bonner, criticized Gorbachev last week
in a Norwegian newspaper, comparing him to Napoleon, who conquered
Europe and made himself an emperor. Today she had no comment on
Gorbachev's win.
   Initial reaction today favored the choice of Gorbachev for the
prize.
   In Washington, President Bush praised the Soviet leader, saying
the United States ``continues to work with the Soviet Union to
promote regional and international peace.''
   ``President Mikhail Gorbachev has been a courageous force for
peaceful change in the world,'' Bush said. ``East-West relations
hold greater promise for peace and world stability today than at
any time in the last 45 years.''
   Former President Ronald Reagan said Gorbachev won the award
because of his ``bold and courageous leadership'' and added: ``I
congratulate my friend on his wonderful recognition of his
accomplishments.''
   ``Since our first meeting in Geneva nearly five years ago, I
have found Mikhail Gorbachev to be sincere in his effort to make
the world safer,'' especially by reducing nuclear weapons
stockpiles, Reagan said in a statement.
   Lech Walesa, the 1983 peace laureate who is campaigning to
become Poland's first popularly elected president, sent
congratulations to Gorbachev, saying he was pleased the world has
recognized his ``great work.''
   The Solidarity leader wished Gorbachev ``further persistence and
successes on the road to democracy.''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain said the selection
of Gorbachev was ``terrific.''
   And Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Germany has a special reason to
thank Gorbachev for lifting Soviet objections to German
unification. ``We Germans ... have grounds to be thankful to you
and are delighted along with your countrymen over this award,''
Kohl said.
   President Vaclev Havel of Czechoslovakia, who had been
considered a leading candidate for the prize, said:
   ``Mikhail Gorbachev contributed significantly to the
acceleration of the inevitable changes in the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe and certainly deserves the prize. If this prize
contributes to the peaceful and quiet transition of the Soviet
Union to a society of equal nations and citizens, we welcome it
warmly.''
   In its citation, the Nobel Committee said the ``greater
openness'' Gorbachev ``has brought about in Soviet society has also
helped promote international trust.''
   However, the changes Gorbachev has encouraged at home have been
accompanied by bloody ethnic conflicts in Armenia, Azerbaijan and
other areas. And his economic reforms - the transformation to a
market-based system is still far off - have led to shortages of
consumer goods.
   The prize was endowed by Alfred Nobel, the Swedish inventor of
dynamite, and has been awarded since 1901. He established four
other prizes, in medicine, literature, physics and chemistry, which
are awarded in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, established by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1968, will be awarded Tuesday. The Nobel
physics and chemistry prizes will be awarded Wednesday.
   Last week, Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz won the prize
for literature. Two American doctors, Joseph E. Murray and E.
Donnall Thomas, won the prize in medicine for pioneering organ and
bone marrow transplants.
   The awards are presented in Oslo and Stockholm on Dec. 10, the
anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896.

   Here is the English-language text of the
1990 Nobel Peace Prize citation, as released by the Norwegian Nobel
Committee.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the 1990
Nobel Peace Prize to Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev, president of
the Soviet Union, for his leading role in the peace process, which
today characterizes important parts of the international community.
   During the last few years, dramatic changes have taken place in
the relationship between East and West. Confrontation has been
replaced by negotiations. Old European nation states have regained
freedom. The arms race is slowing down, and we see a definite and
active process in the direction of arms control and disarmament.
Several regional conflicts have been solved or have at least come
closer to  solution. The U.N. is beginning to play the role which
was originally planned for it in an international community
governed by law.
   These historic changes spring from several factors, but in 1990
the Nobel Committee wants to honor Mikhail Gorbachev for his many
and decisive contributions. The greater openness he has brought
about in Soviet society has also helped promote international
trust.
   In the opinion of the committee this peace process, which
Gorbachev has contributed so significantly to, opens up new
possibilities for the world community to solve its pressing
problems across ideological, religious, historical and cultural
dividing lines.

<HEAD>MacDonald Kickbacks Trial Winds Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tribal judge told jurors today that
all elements of a charge must be proved to find suspended Navajo
Chairman Peter MacDonald guilty, saying it's like needing all the
ingredients to make Navajo fry bread.
   ``If you are making fry bread, you have to have certain
elements, flour, water, salt and baking powder,'' Judge Robert
Yazzie said. ``If you have one element missing, your case is not
proven.
   ``Like making fry bread. If you don't have the salt, the bread
will be tasteless.''
   Closing arguments in the bribery and kickback trial that began
Oct. 1 were scheduled for later in the day.
   Yazzie read the legal definitions of bribery in political
matters, theft by extortion, the ethics violation of accepting
gifts or loans in an effort to influence, and conspiracy.
   One law he outlined said a tribal official could accept gifts
based on a social relationship, but tribal law prohibits any
official from accepting a gift, service, or other benefit of more
than $100 during any calendar year from persons doing business with
the tribe.
   The prosecution contends MacDonald, 61, illegally asked for and
accepted cash payments, loans, plane rides and use of an automobile
from businessmen operating on the reservation.
   The defense argued that MacDonald received the money and other
favors through friendship with the givers and that their acceptance
was not linked to any threat or promises from MacDonald.
   The prosecution rested its case Friday after presenting its 23rd
and final witness on Thursday.
   The defense announced it would call no witnesses. Defense
lawyers said they believed the prosecution failed to prove its
case.
   With the dismissal of three counts against MacDonald on Friday,
42 counts remain pending against MacDonald. His son, Rocky, an
unemployed lawyer who lives in San Jose, Calif., faces 23 counts of
bribery, theft by extortion, ethics violation and conspiracy.
   MacDonald was placed on administrative leave in 1989 by the
Tribal Council after allegations of corruption surfaced midway
through his fourth, four-year term. He and former Chairman Peterson
Zah are on the Nov. 6 ballot for the newly created post of tribal
president.

   Firefighters rescued two black Labrador
puppies from a house that caught fire when the dogs apparently
knocked over a can of gasoline.
   Firefighters rescued one of the puppies when they arrived Sunday
morning but had to re-enter the house for the other dog, which was
found huddled in a corner.
   ``We administered first aid, gave him oxygen and treated him the
best we could,'' fire spokesman Terry Magelssen said. ``He seemed
to be faring pretty well.''
   The puppy suffered smoke inhalation and the hair on its snout
and stomach was singed. The first puppy also was given oxygen for
smoke inhalation.
   Assistant Fire Chief Steve Marr said today that ``one dog was at
home just fine and the other was at a vet somewhere.''
   The dogs were estimated to be 6 to 8 weeks old.
   The puppies apparently were playing when they knocked over the
gasoline can, Clark said. A resident of the house and a neighbor
tried to fight the blaze with a garden hose until firefighters
arrived, but did not try to rescue the dogs, Marr said.

<HEAD>Soviets' Pride in Gorbachev Is Mixed With Anger Over Economy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens rushing from store to store Monday
seeking food, clothes and other essentials expressed as much anger
as pride over Mikhail S. Gorbachev, winner of this year's Nobel
Peace Prize.
   ``For worldpeace and disarmament, he has done an awful lot. But
for his own people, he hasn't done much,'' said Bela, 53, a subway
rider who declined to give her last name.
   ``Around the world, he's popular, of course. But here, he's
not,'' she added, gesturing at grim-faced passengers carrying
half-full shopping bags.
   Most of the 15 Soviets interviewed in Moscow streets, markets,
subways and apartment buildings praised Gorbachev for his role in
raising the Iron Curtain and ending the Cold War.
   But they expressed anger over his domestic policies, which they
blamed for ethnic violence, inflation and shortages of staples
ranging from gasoline to instant coffee.
   ``I don't know much about politics, but what I see in the
stores, I hold the government responsible for,'' said Lyova
Likacheva, a 35-year-old factory worker.
   ``And what I see in the stores is nothing - they're empty.''
   Gorbachev told television reporters the prize would help ``on an
emotional and intellectual level'' to raise support for his
economic reforms.
   But many of the Soviets interviewed said they believed he had
received the award solely for his foreign policy. The Nobel
Committee said his role in international affairs was the main
reason for the prize, but also praised him for promoting ``greater
openness'' in the Soviet Union.
   The news that Gorbachev had won the prize spread quickly through
the city and seemed to take most people by surprise. There had been
virtually no speculation in the Soviet press about Gorbachev's
possible receipt of the $700,000-award.
   Arkady I. Sokolov, a 62-year-old machinist, was one of the few
people interviewed who smiled broadly on hearing that Gorbachev was
the first Soviet to win the peace prize since dissident physicist
Andrei Sakharov in 1975.
   ``He deserves it,'' Sokolov said. ``Armaments are being reduced
everywhere, that's the main thing. ... Of course, I'm proud of
him.''
   Andrei Tatishchev, 23, said he felt no such pride.
   ``In international affairs, I think he's done everything right.
It's domestically that there is disorder,'' Tatishchev said.
   ``I would be proud of him if he put things in this country in
order. What happens there, outside our borders, doesn't interest me
very much as an ordinary Russian person.''
   Lena Somochkina, 17, and her classmate, Tanya Fokina, said they
thought Gorbachev deserved the award for reducing the chances of
nuclear war, allowing freedom of speech and encouraging reform
throughout the East bloc.
   ``He somehow turned our government around completely,''
Somochkina said. ``We used to live behind an Iron Curtain. ... If
Gorbachev hadn't come to power, who knows whether there would have
been reforms in Eastern Europe?''
   The ``only thing'' that Gorbachev ``has maybe done wrong,''
Fokina added, was to undertake hesitant economic reforms that have
led to near chaos. And for that, she mostly blamed his aides and
government bureaucrats.
   ``I think they haven't let him - the people around him in the
government haven't given him the freedom - to do what he wants,''
she said.

<HEAD>Wildlife Activist's Office Is Habitat For New Insect Species</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of the World Wildlife Fund,
Kathryn S. Fuller, has ants in her plants.
   So do lots of people. But the insects Fuller noticed crawling
across her desk last year apparently are a brand-new species, never
before seen by ant experts.
   This means scientists at the fund, which is dedicated to
preserving wildlife and its habitat around the globe, have a new
task right in their own Washington headquarters - making sure the
ants survive.
   The story began when E.O. Wilson, a zoology professor at Harvard
University and a leading authority on ants, visited Fuller's
office. Wilson, a World Wildlife Fund board member, had just
completed an exhaustive work entitled, ``The Ants.''
   Fuller asked Wilson to check out her ants.
   ``Ed's eyebrows just shot up when he saw them,'' Fuller says.
``He immediately identified the ants as members of the genus
Pheidole, a neotropical group on which he has specialized. We
traced the ants to their colony in a potted plant behind my desk.''
   The two collected some worker ants in a vial so Wilson could
study them in his lab. Later he asked that some soldier ants be
collected and sent to him at Harvard to aid in species
identification.
   ``This is a very surprising find and certainly distinctive,''
Wilson said in a statement issued Monday by the fund.
   If the preliminary results are confirmed by final taxonomic
tests, WWF officials said, the new species could wind up being
called ``Fuller's Ant.''
   ``I will feel a very personal sense of responsibility for these
ants, whether or not they're named after me,'' the fund president
said.
   The potted plant where the ants live was a palm tree, identified
by World Wildlife Fund botanists as a Draceana reflexa. The ant
colony could have come with the palm from Florida, or possibly was
imported with another plant and migrated to the Draceana in
Fuller's office.
   On advice from Wilson, Fuller is feeding the ants sugar water
and apple cores, along with cheese, cookies and an occasional
Danish.
   Fund botanists have added to the planter with the host palm tree
some neotropical flora that secrete a substance harvested by
similar ants in the wild.
   ``I'm telling people 'm creating a complete tropical ecosystem
in here,'' Fuller said. ``It shows you how little is known about
diversity in the world, how many species are unknown.''
   The World Wildlife Fund describes itself as the largest private
conservation organization, with projects in more than 140 countries
to protect wildlife and its habitat.
   So its leaders are determined to save the ants.
   ``I've given the plant company strict instructions not to touch
my plant,'' Fuller said. ``The caretaker told me most of his
clients want their plants ant-free. I was the first person to ever
tell him to leave the ants alone.''

<HEAD>Cambodian Gov't Criticizes Reported U.S. Pressure On Dancers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed
government has criticized what it calls an attempt by the U.S.
State Department to pressure Cambodian dancers to defect during
their U.S. tour.
   Four members of the 36-member classical dance troupe have
defected during the tour. The troupe was to complete its
performances in New York Sunday to end the tour, the first cultural
exchange between the United States and Cambodia since the Vietnam
War.
   The State Department says it plans to interview all the dancers
to determine if they really want to return home.
   ``We regret this action of the U.S. Department of State, which
is a form of political pressure to serve a political goal,'' said a
Foreign Ministry statement carried by the Cambodian broadcast.
   ``We would like to stress that these dancers, like other
Cambodian people, are free to choose their domiciles without
pressure from any foreign government,'' the statement said.
   A transcript of Sunday's broadcast was seen in Bangkok Monday.
   The Communist Cambodian government was installed by a Vietnamese
invasion in late 1978. Citizens are not free to travel; more than
300,000 refugees are in U.N. camps just inside the Thai border.
   In a statement last week, the Bangkok office of resistance
leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk said the defections of the dancers
``symbolized the unpopularity and the lack of freedom and democracy
in this Vietnamese tank-installed regime.''

   President Bush today warned Saddam Hussein that
Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait could lead to trials similar to those
held after World War II.
   ``Hitler revisited,'' Bush said of Iraqi actions.
   ``But remember, when Hitler's war ended there were the Nuremberg
trials. Every day now, new word filters out about the ghastly
atrocities perpetrated by Saddam's forces,'' he said.
   The president's remarks came at a fund-raising luncheon for
businessman Clayton Williams, the Republican candidate for governor
of Texas.
   ``His victory will be a triumph for the old-fashioned virtues
that made this state what it is,'' Bush said about Williams.
   Williams is the front-runner in the race against Democrat Ann
Richards. Republican Gov. William Clements is not running for
re-election.
   The president also will be stumping for candidates in Nebraska,
Iowa, Illinois and Michigan during the two-day political trip.
   Bush mixed high praise for Williams with an attack on Congress
for not coming up with a budget bill to his liking.
   ``Thirty-seven times in the last 10 years, Congress has missed
its own budget deadline,'' Bush said. ``This Friday time's up.''
   With that, the president hinted he would not sign another
continuing resolution that would keep the government operating in
the absence of a budget agreement.
   By the end of this week, the president and Congress must come up
with $500 billion in spending cuts and tax increases to reduce the
federal deficit over the next five years.
   In the race for governor of Texas, one of the states Bush calls
home, Williams has spent at least $16 million, including $7.5
million since March. Richards has spent at least $9.4 million,
including $5.7 million since March.
   At least $6 million of the total Williams has spent has been his
own money.
   An independent poll made public late last week said Williams was
leading Richards by 51 percent to 40 percent.
   Why bother going to Texas?
   ``It's the president's home state and it plays a major role in
presidential politics,'' said Michele Davis, executive director of
the Republican Governors' Association. ``Once the dust clears after
the election, everybody wants to be able to point to Texas and be
able to say they played a role in a big win.''
   The nasty tone of the Texas race was demonstrated last week when
the two rivals had a rare joint appearance and Williams used to the
occasion to say, ``I'm here to call you a liar today. ... You've
lied about me.'' Williams was angered that Richards had questioned
his relationship with a Houston loan broker under investigation by
the FBI for alleged money-laundering.
   Williams was in the best shape of the candidates Bush was trying
to help.
   In Nebraska, Republican Gov. Kay Orr was trailing her Democratic
challenger, businessman Ben Nelson. The most recent survey done for
the Omaha World-Herald said Nelson led Mrs. Orr by 8 percentage
points - 44 percent to 36 percent.
   The first Republican woman elected governor of any state, Mrs.
Orr got into trouble when she backed a tax increase after pledging
throughout her campaign to hold the line against new taxes.
   ``She had to apologize,'' said Davis, who insisted that Mrs. Orr
has ``been able to prove that taxes are down'' since she took
office and that Nebraska now has the nation's lowest unemployment
rate.
   Davis said Nelson had outspent Orr 2-1 on television.
   Also benefiting from the presidential visit to Nebraska were
former congressman Hal Daub, who is challenging Democratic Sen.
James Exon, and Ally Milder, who is challenging Democratic Rep.
Peter Hoagland.
   In Iowa, Bush plans to campaign Tuesday for GOP Gov. Terry
Branstad and Rep. Tom Tauke, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Tom
Harkin.
   Bush is visiting Illinois to help gubernatorial candidate Jim
Edgar, now secretary of state. His last stop Tuesday is in Grand
Rapids, Mich., where the president will campaign for state Sen.
John Engler, who is running for governor.

   Larger-than-life campaign posters of
ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, her loyalists and political
opponents clutter the pristine boulevards of the cities and the
bumpy dirt roads to the villages.
   Colorful party flags flutter atop mud-and-straw huts, modern
high-rise buildings, on bicycles, bullock carts and pickup trucks.
Loudspeakers blare the slogans of favorite candidates.
   Despite all the trappings, the campaign for the Oct. 24
parliamentary election lacks the wide public enthusiam that
heralded Pakistan's return to democracy two years ago.
   This election is being fought in the courtroom, not the
countryside.
   When President Ghulam Ishaq Khan ousted Ms. Bhutto on Aug. 6 and
called the election three years early, most Pakistanis were pretty
fed up with her performance and an ineffective Parliament paralyzed
by 20 months of bickering.
   The caretaker government, made up of former allies with little
in common except contempt for Ms. Bhutto, thought it would produce
enough evidence to prove she presided over Pakistan's most corrupt
and inept government.
   They boasted she would be forced out of politics for seven
years, maybe forever, and the left-leaning Pakistan People's Party
founded by her father, the late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto,
would be destroyed.
   Government lawyers crossed the country filing charge after
charge against the 37-year-old former prime minister, six former
Cabinet ministers and ultimately her husband.
   But even Ms. Bhutto's strongest critics now privately admit the
evidence is questionable and the credibilty of the caretakers -
called the ``undertakers'' by Pakistan's Urdu- and English-language
press - has been called into doubt.
   ``We wanted to make her the villian, but instead she's becoming
the victim,'' said one government official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``Now we are on trial and the verdict will be
delivered Oct. 24.''
   Promises of elections are the threads holding together the
delicate fabric of Pakistan's democracy, which unexpectedly
returned in 1988 when the military dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia
ul-Haq, died in a still unexplained plane crash.
   Pro-government newspapers and state-owned radio and television
carry daily reassurances from Ishaq Khan and the powerful army
chief of staff, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, that the polls will be held
on time ``come what may'' and that power will be transferred to the
choice of the people ``irrespective of who wins.''
   But in a country ruled by the military for more than half its
43-year existence, such promises have been broken too many time in
the past to inspire confidence.
   Politicians hurl accusations and insults at each other instead
of talking about the real issues that trouble this Moslem country
of 110 million people: a soaring birthrate, increasing poverty and
rising prices that are putting many of the basic necessities out of
reach.
   ``The politicians certainly aren't capable of running the
country,'' said Imran Rafiq Bhatt, a 25-year-old charity worker in
the eastern village of Visvian. ``We should give the country to
Japan on lease for eight years and maybe they could straighten
things out.''
   The events surrounding Ms. Bhutto's dismissal and her trials
before the special tribunals resurrected from the days of martial
law have only served to make Pakistanis more cynical about the
future.
   But analysts say the caretaker government has become Ms.
Bhutto's best friend, making her the underdog and helping halt and
then reverse her declining popularity and galvanize the
disillusioned rank-and-file in her party.
   Ms. Bhutto, the daughter of wealth and privilege, is cast as the
``poor people's sister,'' the champion of freedom and democracy,
the scrappy fighter of political oppression.
   It is a role she played so well for a decade after her father
was overthrown in 1977 military coup and hanged two years later -
the daughter of wealth and privilege advocating freedom, democracy
and people power.
   While the caretaker government was busy trying to collect facts
and figures in a bureaucratic manner, she criss-crossed the country
in a Pajero jeep, inching through the surging, suffocating crowds
and appealing to the sentiments of the people, then traveling all
night to her next court appearance.
   Soon the stories of large-scale corruption and mismangement
began to fade and sympathy for her grow.
   ``Her appeal is direct, sentimental and down-to-earth. She still
carries the day,'' said political analyst Syed Alamdar Raza. `The
coalition in power and her opponents who want to be in power have
no one who comes anywhere near her.''
   When she was in power and times were good, Ms. Bhutto said in an
interview, she occasionally thought about the day when she would
give up politics to devote time to her young children, son Bilawal
and daughter Bakhtawar.
   ``Now is not the time to talk or even think about retirement,''
she said during a weeklong campaign swing through eastern Punjab,
the country's most prosperous province and home to more than 60
million Pakistanis.
   Government officials and bureaucrats admit privately they
underestimated her drive, her ambition and her steely
determination.
   Even her most bitter opponents calculate she and the People's
Party will win about 80 seats in the 217-member National Assembly,
the law-making lower house of Parliament that chooses the prime
minister. That would fall short of an outright majority but most
likely make hers the largest single party.

<HEAD>FTC Challenges Sales Of Publishing Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission on Monday
challenged R.R. Donnelley &amp; Son Company's acquisition of a smaller
publishing-printing partnership, saying it could substantially
lessen competition in the high-volume publication field.
   Donnelley, which has its headquarters in Chicago, bought the
Meredith/Burda companies for $570 million in a deal consummated on
Sept. 4. The previous week, the U.S. District Court denied the
FTC's request for a preliminary injunction blocking the sale.
   ``We were convinced at the very beginning, when this sale was
agreed upon in December 1989, that it did not present legal
obstacles,'' said James Ratcliff, Donnelley's vice president for
corporate affairs. ``We think we were right on the facts of the
law, and that we have a good case, and we will press on.''
   The FTC issued an administrative complaint that the acquisition
``created a firm whose share of the market is so high that it has
become a dominant firm.'' It said the deal will eliminate
competition among other firms in the market.
   R.R. Donnelly is a printing firm, specializing in high-volume
publication gravure printing of the type used for long runs of
magazines, newspaper inserts and catalogues. Meredith Corporation,
based in Des Moines, is a magazine publisher which also owns seven
television stations. It is a partner in printing operations with
the Burda family of Germany.
   ``What Donnelly bought was the printing operations,'' Ratcliff
said. ``We are not publishers.'' Included is a magazine printing
plant in Des Moines, and catalogue printing plants in Lynchburg,
Va., Newton, N.C., and Casa Grande, Ariz.
   An official in the FTC's Bureau of Competition who asked not to
be named said the sale would give Donnelly more than 50 percent of
the market in at least one area.
   The complaint also names Meredith Corp. and Pan Associates, L.P.
which each owned 50 percent of Meredith-Burda.
   A federal judge turned down the FTC's request for a preliminary
injunction against the sale on Aug. 27, but the FTC official said
the court's ruling was ``just a preliminary assessment of the
commission's likelihood of succeeding.''
   The new complaint will be heard before an administrative law
judge, whose ruling can be appealed to the full commission. If the
firms lose both decisions, they can carry the case to a federal
court.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won
the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize on Monday for easing international
tensions, but claimed it as an endorsement of wrenching changes he
has made at home.
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee said the 59-year-old Soviet leader
displayed a ``leading role in the peace process which today
characterizes important parts of the international community.''
   ``Words fail one at such moments. I am moved,'' Gorbachev said
in a television interview.
   ``I perceive this action of the most authoritative organization
of the global community first of all not in personal terms, but as
recognition of the significance of the immense cause of perestroika
for the destiny of the entire world.''
   Gorbachev has been criticized at home because some of his social
and economic reforms, called perestroika, have led to bloody ethnic
rioting, food shortages, and demands by most Soviet republics for
independence.
   ``We know that there are great problems (in the Soviet Union),
but that is not what he got his prize for,'' said Gidske Anderson,
leader of the five-person Nobel Committee. ``The big thing that is
happening in the world is the reconciliation of the superpowers.''
   ``If you will read the text you will see we are talking mainly
about international policy,'' she said.
   The committee's citation said the ``greater openness (Gorbachev)
has brought about in Soviet society has also helped promote
international trust.''
   The committee said Gorbachev had made many contributions to the
``dramatic changes'' in East-West relationships since he came to
power in 1985:
   ``Confrontation has been replaced by negotiations. Old European
nation states have regained freedom. The arms race is slowing down
and we see a definite and active process in the direction of arms
control and disarmament.''
   Gorbachev told a Norwegian TV interviewer his reforms were
popular outside the Soviet Union because ``the world was ripe for
change.
   ``It had grown tired of the Cold War, the arms race, the
hardships resulting from an overload of current problems facing the
world community,'' he said.
   In the past five years, the Soviet Union has agreed to reduce
nuclear and conventional armed forces, helped settle regional
conflicts in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and withdrawn its
forces from Afghanistan.
   Many world leaders praised the award, but several said they
hoped it would lead to even more freedom in the Soviet Union.
   ``If this prize contributes to the peaceful and quiet transition
of the Soviet Union to a society of equal nations and citizens, we
welcome it warmly,'' said Vaclav Havel, a former dissident who
became Czechoslovakia's president after the Soviet Union eased its
grip on the East bloc.
   Former President Reagan said Gorbachev is ``sincere in his
effort to make the world safer'' and ``is dedicated to doing what
must be done for the good of his people.''
   President Bush called Gorbachev ``a courageous force for
peaceful change in the world.''
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher called the choice
``terrific.'' And French President Francois Mitterrand said
Gorbachev was ``the decisive factor in the easing of tensions in
the world.''
   Some Soviet citizens were less enthusiastic about the honor for
Gorbachev.
   ``I don't know much about politics, but what I see in the
stores, I hold the government responsible for,'' said Lyova
Likacheva, a 35-year-old Moscow factory worker. ``And what I see in
the stores is nothing - they're empty.''
   The 71st Peace Prize was the first to a Soviet leader. U.S.
presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson won the award in
1906 and 1919 respectively.
   Gorbachev is the second Soviet nobel peace laureate. Dissident
Andrei Sakahorov won the 1975 prize, but was not allowed to accept
it until last year.
   Gorbachev said he would personally accept the award, worth about
$700,000, this December in Oslo.
   The peace prize, first awarded in 1901, was endowed by Alfred
Nobel, the Swedish inventor of dynamite. It is always presented in
Oslo on the Dec. 10 anniversary of his 1896 death.
   Nobel endowed four other prizes, in medicine, literature,
physics and chemistry, all awarded in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, established by the
Central Bank of Sweden in 1968, will be awarded Tuesday. The Nobel
physics and chemistry prizes will be awarded Wednesday.
   Last week, Mexican poet and essayist Octavio Paz won the prize
for literature. Two American doctors, Joseph E. Murray and E.
Donnall Thomas, won the prize in medicine for pioneering organ and
bone marrow transplants.

   President Bush said Monday that Iraqi atrocities in Kuwait could
lead to trials similar to those held after World War II, and his
defense secretary said U.S. troops will stay in Saudi Arabia as
long as needed.
   Iraq, meanwhile, insisted it would fight rather than withdraw
from Kuwait.
   ``Hitler revisited,'' Bush said in Dallas of Iraqi actions in
the tiny emirate that Saddam Hussein's troops seized Aug. 2.
   ``But remember, when Hitler's war ended there were the Nuremberg
trials. Every day now, new word filters out about the ghastly
atrocities perpetrated by Saddam's forces,'' Bush said.
   Earlier Monday, U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney said
Americans would stay ``as long as the Saudis want us...as long as
it takes to get the job done. No one should underestimate our
staying power.''
   ``Time is much more likely to be on our side than it is on his
side,'' Cheney said, referring to Saddam and the U.S.-led
multinational force.
   Asked if there was the political will in the United States to
maintain troops in Saudi Arabia for years, Cheney said: ``There
certainly is.''
   The defense secretary, who spoke in London as part of a 10-day
tour that also will take him to Moscow, said economic sanctions
were only just beginning to hurt Iraq. He stressed that America
hopes to avoid war.
   Iraq denied it was softening its stance on the gulf crisis.
   ``Kuwait is the 19th province of Iraq and this fact will not be
changed whatsoever even if we fight a long war for that,''
Information Minister Lafif Nassayif Jassim was quoted as saying.
   He told reporters in Baghdad Sunday night that he believes a
U.S.-led attack is imminent, but that Iraq would not fire the first
shot, the official Iraqi News Agency reported.
   ``We expect the war at any moment and we are ready to fight
against the Americans and those who come with them,'' he said.
   An editorial in Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling Arab
Baath Socialist Party, said Iraqis ``are prepared to meet the
American troops.''
   ``If they start the war, we will make it a catastrophe for those
who ignite it,'' the editorial said. ``The destruction will be
total.''
   Should fighting break out, the statement said, ``All the
American interests and those of its allies inside and outside the
region will explode, and the fires will eat them at the first hour
of their aggression against Iraq.''
   The Iraqi statement appeared intended to reassure its citizens
and counter reports that Saddam might be wavering in his
determination to hold onto Kuwait. Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat met with Saddam on Sunday and
said later that the Iraqi president was showing a ``certain
flexibility'' regarding his claims to Kuwait.
   Arafat spoke in Tunis after meeting with the French foreign
minister. Diplomatic sources in Baghdad said Arafat is trying to
persuade the Iraqis to talk with the French, who suggested Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait might be linked to an Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Saddam said Aug. 12 that he would discuss a withdrawal from
Kuwait only if talks also were held on the Palestinian issue. The
West Bank and Gaza are home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   The official Soviet Novosti press agency said Saddam had
indicated to Soviet envoy Yevgeny Primakov that he might remove his
troops in exchange for some Kuwaiti territory on the gulf.
   ``That report is not precise,'' Jassim said of the Novosti
dispatch.
   In other developments Monday:
   -Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told Soviet
lawmakers the Kremlin has no plans to join the multinational force
in the gulf, and assured them any such deployment would require
their approval.
   ``The Soviet leadership has no plan for participation in a
military operation,'' he said.
   -In Jiddah, Saudi Arabia, the wife of the Kuwaiti planning
minister said Iraq is fencing off the northern part of Kuwait.
   ``The Iraqis are setting up a wire fence across Kuwait. They
apparently plan to gulp up Bubiyan and the northeastern oilfield,''
said Fatima Hussein, who fled Kuwait last week and was among 750
businessmen, economists and politicians at a three-day conference
on their country's future.
   -The French Foreign Ministry reported Iraqi soldiers have
emptied the rooftop cistern holding the water for the French
Embassy in Kuwait. The building now has no water, electric or
telephone service, and rice is the only remaining food, the
ministry said.
   Iraq's ambassador to France, Abdul Razzak al-Hashimi, denied
that the cistern had been emptied.
   -Spain became the first European Community country to see all
its hostages safely out of Iraq when 15 Spaniards reached Jordan
accompanied by a five-member private delegation that won their
release from Baghdad. Seven Spanish diplomats voluntarily remained
behind.
   There are more than 600 American hostages in Kuwait and about
300 in Iraq.
   -Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan said his government is
considering whether the constitution can be interpreted to allow
deployment overseas of armed Japanese troops under U.N. auspices.
The constitution, written during the U.S. occupation after World
War II, prohibits the use of force to settle international
disputes.

   Iraqi crewmen
of a container ship cursed members of a U.S. boarding team, leading
to tense moments before the vessel's master agreed to change
course, Navy officers say.
   In another reported incident, U.S. Marines for the first time
joined in a boarding party by ``fast-roping'' from a hovering
helicopter onto the deck of an Iraqi ship in the northern Arabian
Sea.
   In nearly nine weeks since the U.N. embargo against Iraq began,
the multinational force of naval ships has intercepted 2,350
commercial vessels, nearly 40 a day, U.S. military spokesmen said.
   They said they could not provide a breakdown by members of the
multinational force, nor any updated figures on the number of
boardings or diversions of ships.
   The U.S. warships are part of an international flotilla
enforcing the U.N. embargo, which was imposed in response to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The majority of boardings have occurred in the Red Sea, mainly
along the approaches to Jordan's key port of Aqaba.
   Despite Jordan's assurances to the contrary, U.S. officers say
some prohibited cargoes appear to be slipping through Aqaba and
being taken overland to Iraq.
   The Roberts, the frigate USS Elmer Montgomery, and Greek and
Spanish frigates are serving as embargo gatekeepers for ships
entering and leaving the Strait of Tiran, which leads into the Gulf
of Aqaba.
   The 3,600-ton Roberts, based at Newport, R.I., has conducted
about 40 boardings itself and one previous diversion, of the
Sudanese freighter Blue Nile, in the Tiran Strait Oct. 5.
   The tense confrontation occurred Friday when a combined
Navy-Coast Guard team from the Roberts boarded the 24,302-ton,
Qatar-flagged container ship Bar'zan after following it for eight
hours as it headed toward Aqaba.
   Cmdr. John W. Townes III, captain of the Roberts, said Sunday
that some members of the Bar'zan's crew, identified as Iraqis,
``verbally abused'' the Americans, using ``a lot of four-letter
words.''
   He said the situation never got out of hand.
   ``It got close but the boarding party has learned that the best
thing is to step away,'' he said.
   The Bar'zan, which had picked up cargo in the United States and
Spain en route to the region, agreed to divert to the Saudi port of
Jiddah after its cargo manifest was ``found to be unclear as to the
ultimate destination'' of some goods on board, Townes said.
   U.S. military spokesmen said Marines from the amphibious landing
dock ship USS Ogden climbed down by rope onto the Iraqi-flagged
tanker al-Mutanabbi on Saturday after it was intercepted by the
Ogden, the frigate USS Brewton and the Australian missile frigate
HMAS Darwin.
   Once the Marines secured the 66,155-ton tanker, inspection teams
from the Brewton and Darwin boarded from small boats.
   ``After determining that al-Mutanabbi was empty of cargo, the
boarding teams departed and the ship was cleared to proceed,'' a
statement said.
   A Navy spokesman in the Saudi city of Dhahran, Cmdr. J.D. Van
Sickle, said he did not know why the Marines were involved. The
Ogden, which carries about 900 Marines, is among 18 ships in a
Marine amphibious task force in the north Arabian Sea.

   Five American airlines have been authorized to
open passenger and cargo service to Tokyo and other cities in
Japan, the Department of Transportation announced on Monday.
   Three air carriers - United Air Lines, Delta Air Lines and
American Airlines - were authorized to serve Tokyo.
   Delta, America West Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines were
authorized to serve two other Japanese cities, Nagoya and Fukuoka.
   The route awards were granted under a November 1989 agreement
which laid the foundation for a major expansion of air service
between the United States and Japan.
   In making the announcement the department noted that the
U.S.-Japanese market currently generates more than $6 billion in
revenue for both countries. Last year the Japan market ranked third
in numbers of passengers, after Canada and Great Britain, and was
first in passenger revenue.
   Monday's announcement is the last of several awards authorizing
new flights to Japan.
   In July, Federal Express, which had been providing all-cargo
service to Tokyo, was permitted to serve Nagoya as well. In August,
United Cargo Service was selected to operate a new all-cargo
service to Tokyo. And in September the department allotted the 450
charter flights authorized by the agreement.
   Patrick V. Murphy, deputy assistant secretary for international
affairs, made the following new selections:
   -Chicago-Tokyo authority to United with backup authority to
American if United does not choose to fly the new route.
   -Los Angeles-Tokyo authority to Delta with backup authority to
American.
   San Jose-Tokyo authority to American with backup authority to
Continental Airlines for Houston-Tokyo service.
   -Honolulu-Nagoya authority to America West with backup authority
to Continental.
   -Honolulu-Fukuoka authority to Hawaiian Airlines with backup
authority to Continental for Los Angeles-Nagoya service.
   -Portland-Nagoya authority to Delta with backup authority to
Continental for Seattle-Nagoya service.
   Nine air carriers submitted 23 proposals for the new routes, the
department said.

   President Bush said Monday he will nominate Robert
William Gambino, a 20-year veteran of the Central Intelligence
Agency, to be director of Selective Service.
   If confirmed by the Senate, Gambino would succeed Samuel K.
Lessey Jr. as head of the nation's standby consciption arrangements
for the armed forces.
   For the past 10 years, Gambino has held a variety of positions
outside government, most recently as vice president of a research
group in Falls Church, Va.
   From 1960 until 1980 he worked for the CIA.
   Gambino's nomination was announced during a campaign appearance
in Dallas by Bush.

   Arizona voters will try to do what their elected
leaders have failed at for 15 years: put the costly and divisive
Martin Luther King holiday issue to rest, one way or the other.
   Arizona is one of just three states - with Montana and New
Hampshire - that have not made the late civil rights leader's
birthday a state holiday in some form. Congress designated the
third Monday in January a federal holiday in 1983.
   Repeated attempts at making King Day a holiday have died in the
Arizona Legislature since the first effort failed in 1975.
   Amid concern that the dispute has hurt the state economically,
pollsters and politicians now believe voters will give their
blessing Nov. 6 to a ballot measure adopting the holiday.
   A rival ballot measure would ratify legislation creating a paid
King holiday for state workers but eliminate a paid Columbus Day.
Polls show scant support for that idea.
   All sides, including impeached Gov. Evan Mecham who is a leading
opponent, have said they will abide by the outcome.
   The Republican and Democratic gubernatorial candidates favor a
King Day. Mecham, who created a storm during his tenure as governor
by eliminating a King holiday created by his predecessor, lost his
bid to regain the governor's office in the Sept. 11 Reublican
primary.
   ``There's a feeling here that the only thing worse than giving
them the holiday is not giving it to them,'' said Jim Tidwell,
chairman of the Republican Party in Gila County.
   ``There are also just a hell of a lot of people who feel that
America is a leading nation in civil rights and that we ought to
honor that,'' said Pheonix pollster Earl de Berge.
   De Berge said his own polls show voters favor the holiday by
about a 5-to-3 margin. A poll by The Arizona Republic found 55
percent in favor of King Day and 42 percent opposed.
   A poll by the newspaper conducted Sept. 13-16 found only 18
percent of 601 registered voters surveyed favored the King-Columbus
Day swap.
   If both ballot measures are approved, the one with the greater
number of yes votes wins. If both are rejected, the
long-established Columbus Day would be retained, and Arizonans
would have no paid King holiday.
   The outcome could end a struggle that has divided the state
since the first King holiday bill was introduced and defeated in
1975.
   Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt, a Democrat, created the holiday by
executive order just before he left office in 1986.
   But Mecham, armed with an attorney general's opinion that
Babbitt's order was illegal, rescinded it days after he took office
in January 1987.
   Mecham subsequently issued his own executive order, setting
aside the third Sunday in January as an unpaid holiday to honor
King, but it never was recognized by supporters of a paid holiday.
Mecham was impeached and removed from office for unrelated actions
in 1988.
   The Legislature created a paid King holiday in October 1989 but
did away with the state's paid Columbus Day holiday to avoid the
expense of giving state workers an additional paid day off.
   That touched off a firestorm among Arizona's Italian-Americans,
who helped gather enough petition signatures to place the issue
before the voters on Nov. 6.
   Lawmakers passed a second bill in May, establishing the King
holiday and keeping Columbus Day, in hopes of heading off the
public vote.
   But another referendum drive - this one headed by Mecham -
succeeded in collecting enough signatures to place the second
measure on the ballot as well.

<HEAD>The Sick, Farmers, Tourists Face Higher Costs Under Budget Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal payments to doctors and hospitals
would go down, driving up costs to patients. The government would
be less generous to farmers and college students. And, under the
budget deal brewing in Congress, a broad range of fees would
increase - from tourists entering the country to inventors filing
for new patents.
   In fact, virtually all Americans would be likely to find
themselves digging deeper into their pockets.
   Rudolf G. Penner, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and
former director of the Congressional Budget Office, sees a silver
lining concerning the higher costs: ``They're pretty widespread, so
they shouldn't be intensely felt by any particular group or
individual.''
   The proposals are contained in separate budget-cutting bills the
House and Senate are girding to debate this week. The packages are
aimed at paring the federal deficit by $40 billion in the budget
year that began Oct. 1, by $500 billion over the next five years.
   So far, the tax increases contained in the plans have received
most of the public's attention, with Democrats and Republicans
vying to show the voters that the rich will pay their fair share.
   But it's not just tax increases that the average American would
notice should lawmakers and President Bush finally reach a
deficit-reduction agreement.
   In fact, most of the savings in the packages Congress plans to
vote on come from spending reductions.
   Among the programs hardest hit would be Medicare, which helps 33
million elderly and handicapped Americans pay their medical bills.
Increases in the program, one of the fastest growing in the
government, would be held to $43 billion to $49 billion below the
amount needed to keep pace with inflation over the next five years.
   Although details of the congressional plans differ, it seems
certain that the reimbursements doctors and hospitals receive for
treating Medicare patients will be restrained.
   The Senate Finance Committee bill, for example, would hold
increases in payments to hospitals to 3.2 percent in 1991, 2
percent below the expected rate of inflation for hospital costs.
Reimbursements to family doctors would increase by just 2 percent
next year, while payments to specialists - such as surgeons - would
be frozen at this year's levels.
   With their federal reimbursements reduced, doctors and hospitals
could be forced to pass their costs onto patients - all patients.
The government limits the ability of health-care providers to boost
costs for Medicare recipients.
   Medicare patients themselves are being singled out by the budget
writers. The $75 they must pay each year in doctors' bills before
the government begins picking up the tab would increase to $150
next year under the Senate Finance bill, $100 under the House
Democratic plan.
   Farmers would also be hit by a significant reduction in federal
agriculture subsidies, totaling $13.6 billion over the next five
years.
   Although details were not final, lawmakers tentatively decided
to reduce acreage eligible for crop subsidies by 15 percent for
each farmer, beginning in 1992.
   They also agreed to reduce the subsidies in another way: by
changing the formula by which farmers receive payments when market
prices are low. The five subsidized crops are wheat, corn, feed
grains, rice and cotton.
   College students would also find the Guaranteed Student Loan
program stingier, under a measure approved Monday by the House
Education and Labor Committee.
   The loans - which go to 3 million students at colleges, graduate
schools, and trade schools - would no longer be available at
schools where more than 35 percent of students have defaulted. That
is expected to end the program at about 1,000 schools.
   The committee also decided to reduce the yield banks receive
from the government for making the federally backed loans. This
could discourage some lenders from making the money available to
students.
   Other measures affecting consumers would:
   -End, for five years, the options civil service retirees have to
receive their benefits in a lump sum. People over age 64 with 30
years of service would be exempted.
   -Impose a $1 fee on tourists, on planes or ships, entering the
United States, including returning Americans, except for those
traveling from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean or U.S. possessions.
   -Increase U.S. Patent Office fees for items such as patent
applications.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, his eyes shining with
pleasure, said Monday his Nobel Peace Prize reflected worldwide
recognition of the importance of his reforms ``for the destiny of
the entire world.''
   Gorbachev's $700,000 prize came as he delayed shifting the
Soviet economy from a centrally planned to a market system. While
the Nobel recognition was bound to raise his international
prestige, its effect was less certain in the Soviet Union, which is
plagued by consumer shortages and ethnic strife.
   ``It will be an influence of an emotional and intellectual
nature because it is ... an appreciation of the cause we are all
working for. All the more so because this award coincides in time
with a most crucial stage in perestroika,'' he said.
   ``We are on the threshold of deep changes and reforms ... with
regard to the economy's transition to a market system.''
   Gorbachev was expected to propose a new reform package Monday to
the Supreme Soviet, but his speech was postponed until Friday.
   The Soviet president said he received the news of the award from
Norwegian Ambassador Dagfinn Stenseth at the Kremlin. Gorbachev
said he would travel to Oslo to accept the award.
   He strongly praised the other Soviet peace laureate, the late
Andrei D. Sakharov, who was barred from collecting the prize in
1975, a decade before Gorbachev rose to power.
   Gorbachev recalled Sakharov from internal exile 18 months into
his administration.
   Gorbachev said that when he took office, ``the world was ripe
for change. It had grown tired of the Cold War, the arms race ...
the hardships resulting from an overload of current problems facing
the world community.''
   ``And I consider that academician Sakharov was in the first
ranks of searchers for the answers that agitated people's minds,''
he said.
   Sakharov's widow, Yelena Bonner, who in an interview last week
with a Norwegian newspaper compared Gorbachev to Napoleon, declined
to comment on the award Monday.
   Gorbachev appeared delighted as he stood before reporters,
speaking calmly and slowly.
   ``I am deeply touched. ... I perceive this action ... as a
recognition of the immense value and the immense significance of
the great cause of perestroika for the destiny of the entire
world.''
   ``When we began our perestroika ... we came to the conclusion
that we could not continue to live as we had lived, that we needed
deep transformations in all spheres of life,'' he said.
   ``Even then we wanted to be understood correctly, in that what
we were going to do was bound to be of great significance for all
countries, for the entire world because it was happening in such a
huge country as the Soviet Union, which plays a great role and
bears on its shoulders a great responsibility to the world
community,'' he said.
   Many Soviets, even those who support reform, are skeptical of
Gorbachev's ability to transform the nation.
   Historian Roy A. Medvedev, a member of the Supreme Soviet, said
of the Nobel prize that ``in internal affairs, it won't have much
significance.''
   Most of about 15 Soviets interviewed at random in Moscow said
that although Gorbachev may have helped reduce world tension, his
contributions to his homeland were mixed.
   ``In international affairs, I think he's done everything right -
it's domestically that there is disorder,'' said Andrei A.
Tatishchev, 23.
   ``I would be proud of him if he put things in this country in
order. What happens there, outside our borders, doesn't interest me
very much as an ordinary Russian person,'' Tatishchev added.
   Shortly after the announcement, Gorbachev gave an interview to
Soviet and foreign television reporters. The state news agency Tass
carried excerpts.
   In the Supreme Soviet chamber, Chairman Anatoly Lukyanov waited
78 minutes before informing lawmakers he had ``just learned'' that
Gorbachev had won the award.
   The announcement was followed by seven seconds of mild applause,
comparatively brief in a chamber accustomed to long speeches and
adulation.
   Medvedev later told reporters that Lukyanov had not wanted to
interrupt discussion of a report delivered by Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadaze.
   A defeated Gorbachev rival, Yegor K. Ligachev, was observing the
parliamentary debate when word broke. He told reporters ``I have an
extremely positive reaction,'' then rushed away.

   When immigrant Sam Krichinsky arrived in
Baltimore in 1914, he says at the opening of the movie ``Avalon,''
it was the most beautiful place he had ever seen.
   If audiences share Krichinsky's memory, they can thank Allen
Daviau. As the film's director of photography, Daviau was charged
with transforming director Barry Levinson's rich script into
equally evocative images.
   Perhaps no scene in ``Avalon'' reveals Daviau's artistry more
than that first scene in which Krichinsky (Armin Mueller-Stahl
portraying Levinson's grandfather as a young man) lands in Electric
Park, a 1914 exposition re-created for the film by production
designer Norman Reynolds.
   As the first reel unspools, something looks off. As Krichinsky
moves through Electric Park, decorated with 18,000 lights, his body
movements are slightly jumpy and the colors overly rich. He walks
at normal speed, and yet it is clear we are not watching his actual
arrival. It is instead Krichinsky's recollection of it.
   ``This is a very abstract, stylized, idealized memory he's
having of brilliant lights,'' said Daviau, whose cinematography won
Academy Award nominations for Steven Spielberg's ``E.T. the
Extra-Terrestrial,'' ``The Color Purple'' and ``Empire of the
Sun.''
   ``One of the things Barry said was, `We have to find a way to
distance the past sequences from the present of 1948,' '' Daviau
said. To avoid cinematic cliches, he declined to use filtration or
sepia toning.
   What Daviau (pronounced Dav'-ee-ow) did instead was film at 18
frames per second, as opposed to the standard 24 frames. He then
``stretch-printed'' the film, using every other frame twice.
   ``It's missing a third of the information that our 24-frame-per
second mind is used to seeing, and it's being restored in an
artificial way,'' Daviau said. ``We've seen stretch printing in
silent films for many, many years. The difference is, you haven't
seen it in color.''
   Daviau first used the technique making a bank commercial several
years ago. He still alternates between commercials and feature
films.
   ``It's the best mixture in the world,'' he said, ``because
commercials keep you busy, they keep you in practice, they make you
a lot of money and you meet a lot of directors who are on their way
to doing pictures.
   ``Working in commercials allows you to be choosy about what
movies you do. . . . What I was really looking to do happened when
`Avalon' came along.
   ``I really am fascinated with the '40s,'' Daviau said. ``I got
to deal with a period that I remember quite well.''
   The movie spans 50 years, detailing the lives of the
Krinchinskys - Levinson's family - and the world in which they
live.
   Daviau started as a still photographer, photo lab technician and
theatrical lighting designer. During the mid-1960s, he photographed
rock promotional films with Jimi Hendrix, Aretha Franklin and The
Who. Other feature credits include ``The Falcon and the Snowman''
and ``Defending Your Life.'' In 1988, the American Society of
Cinematographers voted him best cinematographer in feature films.
   Levinson and Spielberg both are visual directors, Daviau said,
but have different styles.
   ``Steven is much more interested in the design of the shot; the
graphics are very, very important to him,'' Daviau said. ``Barry is
a visual director, by all means, but it's a different emphasis. He
loves the compositions.''
   The cinematographer's job is a curious one.
   ``It's really a case of choosing to make your presence known.
And you pick a look for a film and then you're out to make that
look fit,'' Daviau said.
   ``There are certain things that general audiences may notice
about photography that are not the things you do. A lot of times,
we're credited with scenery. The things we really do are things
that people rarely notice. Most of our work is lighting, color,
texture.
   ``One of the greatest things that you do in cinematography is
you guide the audiences's eye to where it should be. You're giving
emphasis where it's desired.
   ``I don't think I would ever want to be known as every film I
have looking the same or somebody saying, `Oh! Daviau did that for
sure.' I'd much rather shape the look to the individual film.''
   In ``Avalon,'' he said, certain details demanded to be examined
closely.
   ``I looked at Armin Mueller-Stahl's face and in a second I saw
those eyes. This is one of the most remarkable faces I've ever been
given to photograph.''
   For the Thanksgiving dinner scenes in ``Avalon,'' Daviau bathed
the interiors with warm, comfortable light; pouring in from outside
windows is cold, blue light.
   Near the film's end, Sam Krichinsky settles into a chair to read
a newspaper. A few seconds later, when he arises, he's aged 10
years. The framing of both shots is identical. There is no jump in
the image, even though the two scenes were done more than a week
apart. So seamless is the transition that some in the audience
don't notice for several moments that Krichinsky's grown old.
   And that, for Daviau, is photography at its best.

   Thousands of state mining and railway workers
went on strike Monday, and state oil workers plan to join them in a
72-hour work stoppage Tuesday to demand wage increases, spokesmen
for the companies said.
   About 5,000 workers at Empresa Minera del Centro (Centromin)
began an indefinite strike on Monday, a Centromin spokesman said,
hampering operations at the San Cristobal, Andaychagua, Cobriza,
Casapalca mines in the Junin and Huancavelica areas east of Lima.
The mines produce copper, lead and zinc.
   The striking workers represent nearly half of Centromin's
workforce.
   Management at Centromin are not taking part in the salary
dispute.
   The workers are demanding a raise of nearly 200 percent to $9 a
day, up from present daily wages of $3.50, according to the
Federation of Miners and Metalworkers of Centromin Peru.
   The Federation said Centromin is offering a 75-cent-a-day pay
hike, to $4.25 a day.
   About 4,000 workers at the state railway company Enafer began an
indefinite strike Monday to protest a presidential decree freezing
wages until December, an Enafer spokesman said.
   The strike will affect the cargo route from Lima's port of
Callao to the Mantaro Valley, 120 miles east of Lima, the spokesman
said. Enafer handles 96 percent of Centromin's shipments.
   The spokesman said the southern rail routes between Arequipa, La
Juliaca, Puno and Cuzco would also be paralyzed.
   Workers at Petroperu, the state oil company, are set to strike
Tuesday for three days to demand wage increases, a Petroperu
spokesman said Monday.
   The company's 10,000 workers plan to shut down offshore drilling
and operations in the jungle and coastal regions, as well as the
company's five refineries.

   The little town of Le Chambon-Sur-Lignon now has a
scroll of honor, and 30 villagers have medals, a half-century after
they and their neighbors saved 5,000 Jews from Nazi persecution.
   Israeli Ambassador Ovadia Soafer presented the Medals of
Righteousness to townspeople who risked their lives as they
sheltered Jews on the run from 1940 through 1944.
   ``You gave a lesson of courage and dignity, but also a political
lesson which statesmen of the entire world should retain and apply
as a rule of conduct - don't give in to threats, don't let youself
be intimidated,'' Soafer said at Sunday's ceremony.
   The entire town, in addition to its scroll, will be honored Oct.
22 at the Yad Vashem holocaust memorial in Jerusalem.
   It is the first community in France to be recognized
collectively by the Yad Vashem institute, which customarily honors
individual non-Jews who took risks on behalf of Jews during World
War II.
   Marie Brottes, 84, said she and her neighbors, mostly poor
Protestant peasants, simply did what the Bible advised.
   ``You had to see those poor Jews who arrived with nothing - no
clothes, no possessions, no family. We helped them because it's
written in the Gospel. That's what gave us the courage and strength
to do what we did,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Just 11 weeks after France fell to the Germans, the
collaborationist Vichy government passed laws discriminating
against Jews. By 1945, 80,000 Jews had been deported to Nazi death
camps. Only 2,500 returned.
   Sheltering mainly children at first, the people of Le Chambon
turned no one away, betrayed no one, attempted to convert no one.
   Mrs. Brottes and other villagers recall the wartime events in
``The Weapons of the Spirit,'' a documentary film about how,
through word of mouth, the quiet, mountain community in central
France became a place of refuge for 5,000 Jews.
   The 90-minute film, shown in France for the first time last
week, was screened in Le Chambon before an audience of rescuers and
survivors, many never reunited before.
   ``Le Chambon-sur-Lignon was like paradise, a little corner of
the world that allowed us to survive,'' said Joseph Atlas, 14 when
he reached Le Chambon after a brief period at an internment camp.
   Atlas, now a 64-year-old engineer, said residents might not
understand why many Jews took so long returning to the village to
express thanks.
   ``At the end of the war, when we discovered the full extent of
the Holocaust, we had to rebuild ourselves psychologically,'' he
said.
   Atlas praised the film's accuracy, but said it brought back
troubling memories.
   The film is the work of Pierre Sauvage, born in 1944 to Jews who
took refuge in Le Chambon.
   Sauvage says Le Chambon - inspired by its impassioned pastor,
Andre Trocme - was swept up in a conspiracy of goodness.
   ``Goodness was contagious. It was a situation in which it was
almost harder to do evil than good,'' said Sauvage, who is based in
Los Angeles and has worked for PBS in the United States.
   The villagers are hardly inclined to see themselves as heroes.
   ``They simply thought what they did was normal, and they looked
at me as though my questions were stupid,'' Sauvage said.
   Madga Trocme, 89, widow of Pastor Trocme, said the villagers
acted because they knew in their hearts ``anything else would have
been a sin.''
   ``They acted in the memory of their Huguenot tradition and the
persecution they experienced over the centuries,'' she said after
seing the film. ``It was war, everybody was in danger. We did what
we did because it had to be done.''

<HEAD>Chilean Arms Maker Denies Deal for Sale of Air-Fuel Bomb to Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chilean arms maker on Monday denied
published reports that it is negotiating the sale of a new air-fuel
bomb to Iraq through the Libyan government of Col. Moammar Ghadafi.
   Cardoen Industries said in a communique it has never made such a
bomb, which is considered an inexpensive but highly lethal
explosive.
   ``Cardoen Industries has no commercial relations for the export
to Iraq of defense material, and has no plans to violate government
regulations banning such exports,'' the company said.
   He said no such exports are planned to any other country either.
   A British newspaper on Sunday said Cardoen had developed the
bomb, and was negotiating its sale to Iraq through Libya.
   Cardoen is one of Latin America's largest arms makers. During
the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, it sold hundreds of cluster bombs to the
Baghdad government of President Saddam Hussein.
   The company says, however, it has now cesead the sale of all
military equipment to Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.

   President Bush signed a bill Monday authorizing
payments of up to $100,000 for people who may have developed cancer
from nuclear testing or uranium mining in Western states during the
Cold War.
   ``These payments fairly resolve the claims of persons present at
the test site and of downwind residents, as well as claims of
uranium miners,'' Bush said in a statement. He signed the measure
during a campaign trip here.
   The United States conducted more than 200 atomic tests in the
open air in both the South Pacific and in Nevada.
   ``Atmospheric testing of atomic devices - important to national
security during the darkest days of the Cold War - ended in 1963''
when the United States signed and ratified the Limited Test Ban
Treaty, Bush said.
   The bill authorizes $100 million for a Radiation Exposure Trust
Fund. Money for the fund would have to be appropriated in a
separate bill.
   The bill provides compensation for people who developed cancer
in certain time periods and:
   -Spent one or two years, depending on their type of cancer, in
downwind areas of Nevada, Arizona or Utah from nuclear tests
between 1951 and 1958, or between June and July, 1962.
   -Or mined uranium in Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, Wyoming or
Utah from 1947 to 1971.
   Uranium miners are entitled to payments of $100,000. Persons
exposed to radiation and who contracted specific diseases would be
entitled to $50,000.
   Courts have ruled the government was immune from prosecution
because national security dictated a need for the uranium, but
judges involved in the case urged the miners to seek redress from
Congress.
   Rep. Wayne Owens, D-Utah, an attorney who represented the
``downwinders'' in a federal lawsuit eight years ago, said the bill
will benefit people he called great patriots.
   ``They are victims of the Cold War, and they will now be
compensated for their long suffering,'' he said.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who co-sponsored the bill with Owens,
said the formal apology contained in the measure might mean more to
victims than the money.
   ``People were sick of what went on and how callous the federal
government seemed to be,'' Hatch said. The apology ``should make
people feel pretty doggone good.''
   One who agreed was Rula Orton of Parowan, Utah. Her 14-year-old
daughter died in 1960 of leukemia that doctors think may have been
induced by radiation. ``I'm glad they're owning up to it,'' said
Orton. ``I feel very good about that.''

<DATELINE>JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent rises in oil prices stem
solely from fears of a war, not a supply shortage, Kuwait's oil
minister said Monday. Analysts said Saudi Arabia, whose reserves
have risen dramatically in the past year, will probably help
prevent severe price shocks during a war.
   The oil minister for the exiled Kuwaiti government, Rashid
al-Ameeri, said at a news conference that oil prices would increase
in the event of hostilities. But he said they would not skyrocket
to $100 a barrel, as predicted recently by a former Saudi oil
minister, Ahmeed Zaki Yamani.
   Ameeri spoke in the Saudi capital, where his government-in-exile
has been established since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   A U.S.-led multinational force has been deployed to Saudi Arabia
in response to the Iraqi aggression, and the stand-off is entering
its 11th week.
   A trade embargo meant to force Iraq out of Kuwait has cut off
four million barrels per day of oil exports from Iraq and occupied
Kuwait.
   Industry experts noted Saudi Arabia, which sits on a third of
the world's proven oil reserves, would exert itself to stabilize
the market. The Saudis already have been instrumental in offsetting
the shortfall in the oil market resulting from the invasion of
Kuwait.
   The kingdom increased its own output by about two million
barrels per day to 7.5 million barrels, and convinced other members
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel to
increase their output.
   In addition, Saudi oil officials refer to the four strikes made
between June 1989 and April 1990 in a previously untapped central
region of the kingdom. During that period, official estimates of
the kingdom's proven reserves jumped by about 50 percent to 252
billion barrels.
   Light sweet crude was trading at $37.75 per barrel Monday on the
New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil was selling on international
markets for about $21 a barrel in July.
   Ameeri said the recent increase in oil prices was not the result
of any shortage in oil supplies, but stemmed from fears about a war
in the gulf.
   His statements were clearly intended as reassurance. Independent
oil industry executives said that the market would suffer a severe
upheaval in the event of a Middle East war, but that the extent to
which oil prices will rise would depend on the extent of damages to
the regional oil facilities and the duration of hostilities.
   Saudi oil officials, led by the minister, Hisham Nazer, often
play up the country's oil production potential.
   Oil experts note the kingdom is also putting back into service
old facilities that were mothballed during the oil glut in the
early 1980s.
   Ameeri said Iraqi troops have placed mines around Kuwaiti oil
fields, refineries and other installations. The Iraqis have also
``stolen'' equipment from Kuwaiti oil facilities, he said.
   ``The damage to the oil industry in Kuwait is huge,'' Ameeri
said.
   He estimated the Iraqis are now pumping about 90,000 barrels a
day, just meeting the needs of local power stations and
desalination plants. Kuwait's pre-invasion output was 1.5 million
barrels a day.
   Iraq's invasion followed Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's claims
that Kuwait had cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue by
overproducing and driving down prices, and that it had stolen $2.4
billion of oil from the Rumailah field between the two countries.

<HEAD>States Must Get Federal Approval Before Holding Elections For
Judges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials must get federal approval
before holding elections for dozens of state judges, the Supreme
Court ruled in a Georgia case Monday.
   The justices unanimously upheld a three-judge federal court's
ruling that such approval is required by the Voting Rights Act of
1965.
   The decision, announced without first hearing arguments in the
case, was the first in which newly installed Justice David H.
Souter participated.
   It came on an appeal by Georgia officials and a cross-appeal by
black voters who wanted new elections ordered for judgeships
already filled.
   At issue was the scope of the 1965 law's requirement that
officials in southern states and elsewhere get Justice Department
approval before making changes in election systems.
   From 1964 to 1988, Georgia created 77 new trial judges and five
new judicial circuits.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh in 1989 said he opposed 48 of
the judgeships and the redistricting plans for two circuits.
   The Georgia General Assembly also voted last year to create six
more judgeships. The state had not submitted those to Thornburgh
for his approval when a special three-judge federal court last year
ruled the state violated the Voting Rights Act.
   The federal court said the state must get approval from the
attorney general for any election changes that could discriminate
against blacks.
   ``The creation of new judgeships does have the potential for
discrimination,'' the panel said, because Georgia has rules that
blunt minorities' voting power in electing judges.
   Those rules authorize circuit-wide voting and require candidates
to designate the specific opening they are seeking if a judicial
circuit has more than one judgeship vacancy.
   The three-judge court ordered Georgia officials to comply with
the Voting Rights Act requirement of federal approval or keep the
judgeships unfilled.
   But the federal court refused to overturn the results of any
previous elections because ``the remaining judges would be
overwhelmed by the resulting increase in work and the court system
thrown into disarray.''
   Georgia officials said there is no evidence blacks have suffered
from discrimination. They said there are many black judges in the
state, though less than the percentage of black citizens.

<DATELINE>CODY, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Country music star Ferlin Husky was in stable
condition Monday at a Cody hospital after suffering chest pains and
canceling a weekend benefit performance.
   Husky, one of country music's top entertainers in the early
1960s with such hits as ``Wings of a Dove,'' was suffering from
what appeared to be angina, said his wife, Marvis.
   She was arranging to fly her husband to Baptist Hospital in
Nashville to be examined by the same medical team that has treated
such country greats as Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings.
   Husky, 63, was scheduled to perform Saturday night at the Wynona
Thompson Auditorium in a benefit concert for the Kidney Foundation.
   But he complained of chest pains shortly before the show and was
taken to West Park Hospital.
   ``On Saturday night he called me from his hotel and said, `I'm
so sick and I can't move and I just wanted to tell you I love you,'
'' Mrs. Husky said in a telephone interview Monday from her home in
Hendersonville, Tenn., a suburb of Nashville. ``I really think he
thought that was it.''
   The singer has a history of heart problems. He suffered a heart
attack in Seattle in 1983 and underwent heart surgery in 1977.
   Lately, Mrs. Husky said, ``he's not been feeling real good and
he's been pushing himself real hard. He's been under a lot of
stress. ... He's neglected going in for checkups.''
   Nonetheless, she said, ``he's a tough guy. He said he was so
disappointed to have to cancel the benefit. He said he will come
back and do it. He will. I know he will.''
   At the height of his career, Husky was a recording, movie and
television star. He made 18 movies with such stars as Jayne
Mansfield and Zsa Zsa Gabor.   He once said his selection as Arthur Godfrey's
summer
replacement at CBS in the late 1950s was the zenith of his career.
   He cut back on his entertaining career in 1970 and has mostly
played concert dates.

<HEAD>Judge Sees Long Convoluted Proceeding in Keating Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge predicted ``a long and convoluted''
proceeding Monday in the fraud case against the Arizona developer
who formerly headed American Continental Corp.
   Charles Keating is accused of bilking investors with American
Continental junk bonds sold through the now-defunct, Irvine-based
Lincoln Savings and Loan. Lincoln's failure was the nation's most
expensive savings and loan collapse.
   Keating, 66, remained jailed Monday in lieu of $5 million bail.
But he made his first comment on the case as he was being led into
the downtown Criminal Courts Building through an underground
garage.
   ``It's dangerous to be right when government is wrong,'' Keating
told reporters.
   His lawyer, Stephen Neal, asked to explain Keating's comment,
would say only: ``Mr. Keating is innocent. He believes in his
innocence. He's confident that when the evidence is developed he
will be vindicated.''
   Keating was chairman of Phoenix-based American Continental,
which owned Lincoln. Experts estimate the cost of bailing out
Lincoln will reach $2 billion.
   Prosecutors say investors in American Continental junk bonds
lost more than $250 million.
   Superior Court Judge Lance Ito said he would read the 45-volume
transcript of grand jury proceedings before Oct. 26, when he set a
hearing for legal arguments on defense motions seeking to have the
judge throw out the indictment as insufficient.
   The judge said he would also decide at that hearing whether to
keep the grand jury transcripts sealed and would rule on defense
motions for discovery of prosecution evidence.
   A prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman, said he
would ask for reciprocal discovery of defense evidence.
   ``I expect this will be a long and convoluted discovery
proceeding,'' the judge commented.
   Ito set a tentative trial date of Nov. 26, but conceded that
would probably be delayed.
   Neal said a spring date would be more realistic, and the judge
said: ``I'm not overly optimistic on the trial date.''
   Neal said he was still pursuing a bail reduction for Keating in
federal court after losing similar bids in state appeals courts.
   Also in court for Monday's hearing were Keating's co-defendants,
who are all free on bail. They are Ray C. Fidel, 32, former
president of Lincoln; Robin S. Symes, 37, who was its chief
executive officer; and Judy Wischer, 42, who was president of
American Continental.
   Each defendant faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of
six or more of the 42 counts.

   ``If you want to protect your livelihood, you can't afford to
vote for Ann Richards,'' the letter from the Independent Insurance

   Richards said, ``They are afraid of me because they know that
insurance rates should be lowered in Texas.''
   Richards is in the pocket of trial lawyers, the Williams'

   ``Richards is a political ambulance chaser,'' said Gordon
Hensley, a spokesman for Williams. Trial lawyers represent injured

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kim Dae-jung, a 66-year-old opposition
leader, was hospitalized Monday on the eighth day of a hunger
strike he began to protest a spy scandal and to demand quicker
democratic reforms in Korea.
   Looking haggard and weak, Kim was taken by ambulance to Yonsei
University Hospital in western Seoul.
   Kim, a two-time presidential candidate, had lost about 13 pounds
and his condition had rapidly deteriorating. Aides said he had
remained in his office since the strike began Oct. 8, drinking only
water and being attended fulltime by a nurse.
   Aides said Kim would continue the hunger strike in the hospital
under medical supervision.
   Acting party chairman Moon Tong-hwan and about a dozen others
started a hunger strike Monday, party officials said. About 55
other members of the party would join Moon soon, they said.
   A mass anti-government hunger strike could create more domestic
political turmoil on the eve of the second round of talks between
the prime ministers of South Korea and North Korea.
   The talks, to be held in Pyongyang, North Korea's capital, are
aimed at easing political and military tensions between the Koreas,
divided since 1945.
   Government critics have charged that the administration of
President Roh Tae-woo is focusing on the talks to divert attention
from pressing domestic issues.
   Kim began his hunger strike to demand reforms and call attention
to a scandal involving the military intelligence Defense Security
Command, which allegedly spied on 1,300 civilians.
   Kim said he would continue his hunger strike until the
government negotiated on four demands - economic reform,
dissolution of the security command, early implementation of local
autonomy and scrapping of government plans to change the form of
government from presidential to parliamentary.
   In an attempt to appease public outrage over the government
spying, Roh fired his defense minister and head of military
intelligence last week. He also reshuffled major party posts and
appointed a new floor leader to encourage the opposition
parliamentarians to return to the National Assembly.
   The 78 opposition members of Parliament resigned en masse in
August, accusing the government of railroading bills and reneging
on promised reforms.
   On Saturday, about 100,000 opposition supporters, radicals and
dissidents rallied in Seoul, the second major opposition protest in
four months and the first two to take place since Roh became
president in early 1988.
   ``This type of struggle is physically the most peaceful, yet
spiritually the most powerful,'' said Kim when he started the
hunger protest. Kim staged hunger strikes in 1977 and 1982, but
both lasted only two to three days.

<HEAD>Kohl Says Those Who Fled East Germany Should Return</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday appealed
to people who left East Germany to return home and help repair that
part of the new united Germany.
   His remark came as Kohl hailed his party's Sunday election
victories in now-defunct East Germany, where his Christian
Democrats won the most votes in four out of five states.
   The victories strengthened Kohl's already good chances of
winning united Germany's first national parliamentary vote seven
weeks from now.
   He told reporters steps should be taken to ``encourage those who
left the DDR (East Germany), whenever and for whatever reason, to
return.''
   He said that would be a ``very important contribution to
rebuilding'' former East Germany, which is beset by skyrocketing
unemployment and other formidable problems.
   More than 4.6 million East Germans fled to West Germany during
40 years of Communist rule in the East.
   Earlier in the day, Kohl met other leaders of the Christian
Democratic Union to discuss Sunday's election victories.
   ``The 14th of October is a day of great joy and satisfaction,''
Kohl said.
   He said the party has a ``favorable starting position'' for
federal elections on Dec. 2, in which underdog Social Democratic
candidate Oskar Lafontaine will try to unseat Kohl.
   The Social Democrats were clearly stung by the results.
   ``It doesn't appear as if we're headed into any shining or
glorious victory, but it is still not the reason to give up,''
Reinhard Klimmt, Lafontaine's campaign manager, said.
   The chancellor warned his party against complacency.
   ``There is the danger that some might believe the election is
already over. There can be no talk of this,'' he said.
   Opinion polls taken before Sunday's balloting already indicated
Kohl had a healthy lead over Lafontaine.
   The Christian Democrats won the most votes in the newly created
states of Saxony, Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt, and Mecklenburg-Lower
Pomerania.
   Brandenburg was the only eastern state where the Social
Democrats won against the conservatives. Final results there gave
the Social Democrats 38.2 percent of the vote to 29.4 percent for
the Christian Democrats.
   The Christian Democrats won an absolute majority in Saxony, with
53.8 percent of the vote, and will be looking for coalition
partners in three other states.
   The most likely partner are the Free Democrats, already the
junior member of Kohl's governing coalition.
   Christian Democrat Alfred Gomulka, who won the vote for governor
in Mecklenburg-Lower Pomerania, said he may try to forge a ``grand
coalition'' to include the Social Democrats. The Christian
Demorats' and Free Democrats' combined vote there falls short of a
parliamentary majority.
   The Party for Democratic Socialism, comprising East Germany's
former Communists, drew less voter support than in East Germany's
first free elections in March. The party still won seats in each
state legislature and is the third-strongest party in some areas.
Its best showings were in Mecklenburg-Lower Pomerania, 15.6
percent, and Brandenburg, 13.4 percent.
   The far-right Republicans were shut out of all five state
legislatures.
   The best they did was 1.15 percent in Brandenburg. Parties had
to win at least 5 percent of the vote to win state legislative
seats.
   The turnout in the five states that used to be East Germany
ranged from 65 to 73.5 percent of the 11.5 million eligible voters.
   The Dec. 2 vote will install the first democratically elected
leader for all of Germany in nearly 60 years.
   Kurt von Schleicher, the last leader of the Weimar Republic, was
chosen chancellor after elections in November 1932.
   In January 1933, Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler took over through
political maneuvering amid a collapsing political and economic
system.
   Kohl expressed concern on Monday that former Communist
functionaries may still be exerting influence in eastern Germany.
He said a major challenge for eastern Germany is ``dismantling old
structures'' left over from Communism.

   President Bush cleared the way Monday for a sharp
increase in Soviet immigration into the United States.
   In his annual determination of the refugee ceiling, Bush
authorized admission of 131,000 as refugees into the country during
the year ending next Sept. 30.
   The refugee total is apart from those who apply for entry as
routine immigrants.
   The regions with the highest quotas were East Asia with 52,000
and the Soviet Union with 50,000. The figure for the Soviet Union
represented an 8,000 increase over the previous year.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said the quota for the rest
of Eastern Europe had declined ``because the political landscape
had changed dramatically'' and fewer people are seeking to leave
those countries.
   Refugee quotas for other regions were Africa 4,900; Eastern
Europe 5,000; Near East and South Asia 6,000; Latin America and the
Caribbean 3,100; not designated 10,000.

   A U.S. Coast Guard cutter intercepted a 40-foot
sailboat packed with 91 Haitians and returned them to Haiti on
Monday, the Coast Guard said.
   The boat was spotted Saturday about 500 miles southeast of Miami
by the Coast Guard cutter Escanaba, the Coast Guard said.
Immigration authorities who interviewed the occupants concluded
that they were trying to immigrate for economic reasons, rather
than political reasons, and thus were not eligible for asylum.
   They were the first group of Haitians repatriated by the Coast
Guard since Sept. 23 when a fishing boat carrying 136 Haitians was
intercepted about 500 miles southeast of Miami.
   The Coast Guard has repatriated a total of 907 Haitians so far
this year.

   Florida's mosquito-carried encephalitis
outbreak has recorded its first confirmed fatality, and health
officials warned Monday that trick-or-treaters should not go out
after dark on Halloween.
   The victim was a 58-year-old West Melbourne woman who fell into
a coma two months ago. She died Saturday one day after her
respirator was disconnected.
   The viral illness is carried by a mosquito that feeds around
dusk.
   Thirty-four people in 15 counties across Central and South
Florida have contracted the so-called St. Louis strain of
encephalitis since mid-August. Fifteen became so ill they required
hospitalization and two people slipped into comas. Twenty-one more
people have shown positive results on the first of two tests needed
for confirmation.
   Dr. Charles S. Mahan, the state health officer, called on all
Florida communities to hold Halloween activities during the
afternoon instead of the evening, as is traditional, in order to
reduce the risk of exposure.
   ``Moving the trick-or-treat hours is a prudent precaution in
light of the current increase in the number of St. Louis
encephalitis cases,'' Mahan said in a statement.
   Authorities were looking at a possible second encephalitis death
in St. Lucie County last month, but are awaiting test results.
   Symptoms of the disease can range from headaches and fevers
usually associated with the flu to coma and death resulting from
brain inflammation. In between, people can experience a stiff neck,
tiredness and irritability. Other severe symptoms include extreme
sleepiness, tremors and seizures.
   The death rate from St. Louis encephalitis typically is 7
percent. Eight people died during the last Florida outbreak of St.
Louis encephalitis in 1977. The state usually has one to three
cases a year, according to Ernie Durfee, a spokesman for the state
Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.
   Florida's first confirmed fatality was Alvena Patton, who had
been in a coma since Aug. 21, Durfee said.
   Her husband said his family hopes her death will cause officials
and residents to take warnings more seriously.
   ``The county needs to get serious about this virus,'' said Harry
Patton. ``They need to get spray trucks out and try to stop this
thing. I know it costs a lot of money, but people's lives are at
stake.''
   Mahan said that although mosquito eradication efforts have been
increased, the recent increase in rainfall could prolong the
current mosquito infestation until drier, colder weather arrives.

   Interior Minister Antonio Gava resigned on Monday,
citing health reasons.
   Gava, a 60-year-old Christian Democrat, had held the post the
past two governments. He said his illness prevented him from
``totally devoting'' himself to the job. According to the ANSA news
agency, Gava suffers from diabetes.
   Premier Giulio Andreotti immediately named Vincenzo Scotti as
Gava's replacement. Scotti, 57, also a Christian Democrat, has been
serving as the party's leader in the Chamber of Deputies.
   Gava came under fire recently from the opposition Communists for
the government's record in fighting organized crime. But in his
resignation letter, Gava defended his performance and said he felt
``especially satisfied'' with his contribution to new government
anti-crime measures expected to be announced this week.
   In addition to interior minister, Gava served in previous
governments as minister of posts and telecommunications and finance
minister.
   Scotti has served as labor minister and culture minister.

   A drug company is recalling three lots of a
bronchodialator drug product that may have been packaged in
mislabeled cartons, the Food and Drug Administration said Monday.
   The product is Metaproterenol Sulfate Inhalation Solution, USP 5
percent. Some bottles of the product may have been packaged in an
outer folding carton labeled Carbinoxamine Compound Drops, which is
used to treat cough and upper respiratory symptoms associated with
allergy or colds in children.
   The FDA advised parents who have been prescribed Carbinoxamine
Compound Drops that the correct medication is purple in color with
a grape flavor and grape odor. It uses a dropper with four distinct
graduation lines between \ and 1 milliliter.
   The inhalation solution is pale yellow and its dropper shows
measuring lines at 0.2 milliliter and 0.3 milliliter.
   If used as pediatric drops in infants, the inhalation solution
could cause nervousness, excessively rapid heartbeat, tremor and
nausea. It also could cause hypertension, palpitation, vomiting and
bad taste.
   Both products are made by Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. of Morton
Grove, Ill, which issued the recalled in cooperation with the FDA.
   The FDA also recommended that pharmacists review their records
since February and notify any patient who had been given either of
the products so they could examine the medications and their
labels.
   The recalled lots of Metaproterenol Sulfate Inhalation Solution,
USP 5 percent, are numbers 18222K, 18421H and 18421C. Packages of
Carbinoxamine Compound Drops with the same lot numbers also are
being recalled.

<HEAD>Airline Industry To Lose $1 Billion In Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. airlines, faced with a $10 billion boost
in the cost of jet fuel because of the Persian Gulf crisis, will
incur a $1 billion loss in the final quarter of 1990, the president
of the Air Transport Association said Monday.
   ``The airline industry has never lost that much in an entire
year,'' Robert J. Aaronson, the association's president, said in a
speech prepared for delivery in Montreal.
   The industry had profits of $170 million on total revenues of
$28 billion in the first six months of the year, the ATA said.
Third-quarter figures were not yet available.
   The airline spokesman called for intervention to stop ``rampant
speculation'' in petroleum products on the commodities markets and
said rising prices do not reflect the fact that adequate petroleum
supplies are available on world markets.
   ``Soaring fuel prices, which have now risen by more than 100
percent, thrust the airline industry into a crisis the likes of
which it has never seen,'' Aaronson said.
   ``The effects of almost daily rises in jet fuel costs on top of
a softening economy can only exacerbate the weakened financial
condition of the airlines and lead to wide-scale layoffs and
service reductions throughout the industry,'' he said.
   The airlines have already laid off 10,000 employees and delayed
delivery of ``scores of new jets,'' Aaronson said. '
   The highly competitive nature of the airlines makes it virtually
impossible to cover all costs simply by raising prices,'' Aaronson
said.
   According to Aviation Daily, the average price per gallon paid
for jet fuel on the spot market on Friday was $1.42, up from 57
cents a gallon in the days immediately before Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Aaronson, the airlines spokesman, urged the commodities markets
``to limit the volatility of speculative trading in oil.''
   ``The market does not reflect the reality of the supply
situation, and it is incumbent on the commodities markets to limit
this rampant speculation,'' he said.
   ``Speculators are amassing fortunes at the expense of ordinary
citizens and businesses,'' he said.
   Aaronson also called on the Bush administration to reconsider
billions of dollars in new taxes on the air travel industry that
have been proposed during current budget negotiations.
   ``No industry or sector of the economy has been hit as hard as
the airline industry during this fuel crisis,'' he said. ``Now is
the worst possible time to put additional tax burdens on an
industry already faced with costs beyond its control - an industry
that is scrambling for economic survival.''

   A man accused of staging a dogfight for a
television news report that cost a star reporter her job was
ordered arrested on Monday after he failed to appear in court.
   The other defendants, former KCNC-TV reporter Wendy Bergen and
former station photographers Scott Wright and Jim Stair, were
advised of their rights.
   The three, along with the missing man, Guy Walker, were indicted
by the Jefferson County grand jury in September on 15 felony
charges accusing them of staging pit-bull fights and lying to the
grand jury.
   The fights allegedly were staged for Bergen's series ``Blood
Sport,'' an expose of underground dog fighting telecast during the
May ``sweeps'' period when the race for ratings becomes
particularly competitive.
   Jefferson County District Judge Gaspar Perricone issued an
arrest warrant for Walker, who faces two counts of dog fighting.
Walker's attorney, Antonio Lucero, said his client did not have
transportation to Monday's hearing.
   Perricone scheduled a Dec. 14 motions hearing, and gave the
Jefferson County district attorney's office another month after
that date to respond. No trial date was set.
   The judge denied the defendants' request to bar television and
newspaper cameras from the courtroom.
   Bergen, an award-winning investigative reporter, resigned
shortly before a grand jury issued indictments claiming she
repeatedly lied to the panel about whether the dogfight was staged
for her show. Wright and Stair also resigned.
   Bergen claimed a tape showing a pit bull fight arrived
anonymously in the mail. But prosecutors say station photographers
made portions of the tape.
   Bergen spoke briefly at the hearing, saying only ``Yes, I do,''
when asked if she understood her rights and the charges against
her.
   Attorneys for the three former station employees said they will
move to dismiss the charges.
   Bergen was indicted on nine felony charges, including arranging
the fights, paying for them, lying about the source of the
videotape, lying to KCNC management and encouraging a friend to lie
to the grand jury.
   Stair and Wright are charged with being an accessory to a crime
and conspiracy to commit perjury. Stair also was indicted on one
count each of dog fighting and conspiracy to commit a dogfight.
   Bergen's lawyers have said they plan to challenge evidence
obtained from Bergen through the use of an informant wired with a
hidden microphone.
   The informant, Mark I. Labriola, has admitted helping Bergen
stage several dog fights. He was not charged under a deal with
proseuctors.

   President Elias Hrawi started dismantling
Beirut's dividing Green Line on Monday to unify what he hopes will
be a militia-free capital after the defeat of rebel Gen. Michel
Aoun.
   Government bulldozers removed mounds of earth, rocks and other
obstacles from the Galerie Semaan crossing, on the highway linking
Moslem south Beirut with the Christian suburbs of Hazmiyeh and
Baabda.
   Motorists then drove across the intersection, waving their hands
to helmeted Lebanese soldiers and honking their horns in
jubilation.
   Lebanese and Syrian army engineering units removed mines from
the intersection Saturday, when Syrian and Lebanese troops advanced
behind a curtain of heavy air and artillery shelling to end Aoun's
rebellion.
   Syrian and Lebanese troops crushed Aoun's 11-month mutiny in an
eight-hour assault Saturday that killed 160 and wounded 800.
   Aoun remained in refuge in the French Embassy for the third day
Monday, with Lebanon insisting that he face trial on a variety of
charges, including the theft of state funds.
   In Paris, French President Francois Mitterrand said he would
reject any Lebanese request to hand Aoun over. Scores of his
supporters occupied Lebanon's embassy in Paris and its consulate in
Marseille, demanding Aoun's safe passage to France.
   Aoun began his mutiny in November 1989 after rejecting an Arab
League-brokered peace plan to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war
and calling Hrawi a Syrian puppet. The peace plan provides for the
traditionally dominant Christians to share power with the Moslem
majority.
   Syrian forces arrested six of Aoun's top lieutenants, including
his chief of military intelligence, Col. Amer Chehab. They were
interrogating them at the Lebanese Defense Ministry, which was
seized from Aoun's troops.
   The Galerie Semaan crossing was flooded with cars less than 30
minutes after the army command of Gen. Emile Lahoud declared it
``safe'' for civilian traffic.
   Lebanese army engineering units were removing mines from areas
along Beirut's five-mile Green Line in preparation for dismantling
it.
   The Green Line, which has divided Beirut into Moslem and
Christian sectors since the outbreak of the civil war, was torn
down in the early days of former President Amin Gemayel's term in
office in September 1982.
   However, Moslem and leftist gunmen regained their positions
along the line when they ousted Gemayel's Christian-led army from
Beirut's Moslem sector in a bloody confrontation in February 1984.
   ``The Green Line is expected to be totally dismantled in a week
or so,'' said the police spokesman, speaking anonymously in line
with regulations.
   Dismantling the Green Line would be the first step toward the
creation of a militia-free ``Greater Beirut'' extending 22 miles
along the Mediterranean coast and covering the capital's nearby
suburbs at the foothills of the central mountains.
   Bringing down the Green Line would be one more major dividing
line to fall the past year - the Berlin Wall, built in 1961 by East
Germany as an ideological division to the West, was torn apart last
fall during a popular uprising.
   The major obstacles are the presence of Christian, Shiite and
Druse militias in that territory.
   Hrawi met Monday with a six-officer delegation from the Syrian
military command and discussed with them, among other topics, the
Greater Beirut plan, a presidential statement said. It did not
disclose further details.
   The Syrian team included Maj. Gen. Saeed Bayrakdar, commander of
Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon, and Brig. Gen. Ghazi Kenaan,
chief of Syria's military intelligence in the country.
   Syria, in Lebanon under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate, considers
the country its strategic backyard. The fall of Aoun has
strengthened its hold on the country.
   Hrawi instructed a two-man government committee to start
discussions with the various militias to ``arrange for their
withdrawal from the Greater Beirut,'' a government source said.
   The army ordered a battalion of its military police to enforce
law and order in the 80-square-mile enclave formerly controlled by
Aoun.
   Police said leftist and Moslem militias moved into some
Christian villages after Aoun's troops collapsed to settle old
scores with traditional civil war foes.
   A police spokesman said Shiite Moslem gunmen of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah advanced to Beirut's Christian suburb of Hadath on Sunday
and were involved in ``kidnapping Christians and looting houses.''
   A pro-Syrian Christian militia led by Elie Hobeika also entered
Hadath and clashed briefly with Hezbollah late Sunday ``over
looting.'' Four people were killed and 10 wounded.
   Leftist militiamen of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party,
traditional enemies of Lebanon's right-wing Christians, slipped
into the mountain resort of Bekfaya northeast of Beirut, stormed
Phalange Party offices and kidnapped a number of Phalangists, the
police spokesman said.
   The Phalange Party, the largest right-wing Christian political
group, was opposed to Aoun's mutiny.

   A suspected arson fire damaged three floors of
the Lebanese Consulate and injured an employee and five
firefighters, the Fire Department said Monday.
   The fire broke out on the ground floor of the consulate in
Manhattan on Sunday evening and spread to two upper floors before
being extinguished, said Fire Department spokesman Tom Kelly.
   Kelly said a flammable liquid was found at the scene but the
cause of the blaze was still being investigated. The consulate had
received recent telephoned threats, Kelly said, but declined to
elaborate.
   Three firefighters suffered neck injuries when a ceiling
partially collapsed, another broke his wrist and a fifth suffered
cuts on his hand, officials said.
   A consulate employee who tried to put out the fire with an

   The Bush administration reacted Monday with
mild displeasure to an Israeli government decision not to cooperate
with a United Nations team investigating the shooting deaths of 19
Palestinian Arabs.
   ``We want to see that U.N. resolution fully implemented,''
President Bush said as he flew to Texas and Nebraska to raise funds
and make speeches for Republican candidates.
   ``We were a part of it and we think it's the right step. So I'll
just leave it there,'' Bush told reporters who traveled with him on
Air Force One, the presidential jet.
   The State Department, going a step further in criticizing the
Israeli Cabinet's decision, said through spokeswoman Margaret D.
Tutwiler: ``The United States voted for this resolution because we
think it is right. And therefore we are disappointed that the
Israeli government has decided not to cooperate with the mission.''
   The U.S. official added: ``In fact, we think that failure to
cooperate denies Israel an opportunity to present its case to the
Secretary-General. We are hopeful that the Secretary-General's
people will be able to carry out this mission.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a message to Foreign
Minister David Levy before the vote, ``made clear our sense of
concern over Israel's handling of the situation,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said later.
   The 19 Palestinians were killed by Israeli police on the
hallowed Temple Mount, sacred to Moslems and Jews, last Monday. The
shootings were the climax to a riot that began when Palestinians
threw rocks onto Jewish worshipers praying below at the Western
Wall, a sacred site to Jews. Police first used tear gas and rubber
bullets, then live ammunition.
   The United States drafted a resolution for the Security Council
to condemn the Israeli police while also regretting interference
with worship. The Palestine Liberation Organization, through Yemen,
proposed censuring Israel and establishing U.N. oversight of
Israel's treatment of Palestinians.
   Finally, the Council last Friday night adopted a modified
version of the U.S. draft, authorizing Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar to send investigators to Jerusalem but without
calling for permanent U.N. involvement.
   Israel's Cabinet on Sunday issued a communique calling the
resolution ``completely unacceptable.'' It said Israel would not
receive the delegation.
   State Department spokeswoman Tutwiler, confirming reports in the
Israeli press, said Baker had interceded with Levy before the vote.
   In a message through the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv, he told Levy
that admitting the U.N. mission would not have set a precedent
since Israel had accepted a representative of Perez de Cuellar in
June, the U.S. official said.
   ``We would like to see this issue concluded and hope that Israel
will find a way to work with the Secretary-General's
representative,'' Ms. Tutwiler said in a statement.
   Israeli reports said Baker wrote Levy he was worried that
rejection would focus world attention on Israel instead of Iraq,
whose annexation of Kuwait the United States is trying to reverse.
   According to the newspaper Yediot Ahronot, Baker told Levy: ``At
a time when I am sure that you would have preferred that there
would not have been any Security Council decision at all, we
exerted every effort, including threats of a veto, against the much
harsher proposal that had been approved.
   ``We supported this decision that we felt that Israel should
have been prepared and capable of dealing with the violence and
rioting without killing 20 people or injuring 150. In the fact that
they were not prepared, Israel played into the hands of (Iraqi
President) Saddam Hussein...
   ``I am worried that if you reject this mission that is about to
travel to Israel, you will put Israel, and not Iraq, at the center
of world attention.''
   Baker also told Levy the United States would ask the Security
Council to reconvene ``to reach a new decision'' on Iraq's
aggression against Kuwait. ``We will not allow Saddam Hussein to
get off the hook,'' the letter said.
   Spokeswoman Tutwiler did not confirm the authenticity of the
letter or release a text here. She said she had to consult Baker.
   The administration has taken the position it was not connecting
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait with the dispute between Israel and
Palestinians.
   Saddam Hussein has called for considering the two issues
simultaneously. Bush in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly two
weeks ago said an Iraqi withdrawal could lead to opportunities to
resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue.

   At least two of the gunmen crashed through a plate-glass window

   Police recovered $5,000 in cash and $6,000 worth of solid gold
jewelry, said Police Chief Ron Allanach.
   Gunmen wearing nylon stockings over their heads forced about 30
card players to lie face down on the floor, firing shots as they
did so, police said.
   They went from one player to the next, pointing a gun barrel at
each victim's head and stealing cash and jewelry, Allanach said.
The gamblers were believed to be of Vietnamese and Chinese
background, said the chief.
   Arrested were Li Yi Zhou, 18, of the Chinatown section of
Boston, and Chanh Tran, 18, of New York City, were being held on
armed robbery charges in lieu of $50,000 bond, said police.

   Instead of gunfire and explosions along
Beirut's Green Line, there were sounds of hope Monday as a
bulldozer toppled a section of the five-mile border dividing the
Christian and Moslem sides.
   Soon, the battle-ravaged passage was filled with motorists
honking car horns in celebration.
   The first steps in dismantling the 15-year-old barrier came
after Syrian and government troops crushed rebel Christian Gen.
Michel Aoun's 11-month mutiny against President Elias Hrawi on
Saturday.
   Aoun opposed an Arab League peace plan that Hrawi was elected
last November to implement. With Hrawi's forces in control of
Christian east Beirut, a cautious reunification effort was begun.
   According to plans in the always-volatile Lebanese capital,
unrestricted access between east Beirut and the Moslem western
district may be possible next week.
   The Green Line - a zone of earthen mounds, barbed wire,
sandbags, overturned buses and other debris - has stood as a symbol
to Lebanon's civil war since it was first set up in April 1975.
   Unlike the Berlin Wall that was erected for ideological reasons
in 1961 to separate East from West - and fell during a popular
uprising last year, the Green Line took shape gradually and along
religious lines as the battles intensified.
   It took its name from a similar zone erected in 1974 on the
eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus to divide Greek- and
Turkish-controlled areas.
   The Green Line was partially dismantled in 1983 under former
President Amin Gemayel's administration with the help of a
multinational peacekeeping force.
   But it was re-fortified in February 1984 when Moslem militia
drove Gemayel's Christian army units out of the Moslem sector,
beginning years of killings, kidnappings and violence.
   The Green Line is now dotted with bushes and undergrowth that
have sprouted amid the ruins in a city once called the Paris of the
Middle East.
   Tree stumps unrooted from parks stand in long-vacated highways
amid twisted traffic lights and rusted road signs. Many roads and
alleys are littered with live shells and grenades.
   The line curves from the war-battered port district through the
ruins of the once-bustling downtown commercial district to the
foothills of the central mountains overlooking the city.
   The hundreds of high-rise apartment blocks on either side of the
line are riddled with bullet holes and scorch marks from exploding
shells.
   These were the sniper nests, where militiamen from both sides
clashed almost daily, killing hundreds of people. Many of victims
were women hanging their washing or civilians trapped in the open
when the gun battles flared without warning.
   Despite the encouraging signs Monday, Hrawi still faces a
struggle in a country plagued by deep hostilities.
   There are still Christian and Moslem militia positions on the
line. But commanders pledge these will gradually be abandoned.

   The former chief legal officer for the company
that makes Advil, Anacin and Preparation H was arraigned Monday on
charges he pretended to be a doctor and illegally ordered enemas
for hospital patients.
   Roger Kapp, 54, was arrested after police put a tape recorder
and a number tracing device on the home telephone of a Lenox Hill
Hospital patient.
   Authorities allege that Kapp ordered an enema for the patient,
then telephoned her at home to discuss the procedure.
   The calls were traced to Kapp's extension at American Home
Products, a manufacturer of medicines and medical supplies.
   Kapp was arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court on two counts of
second-degree criminal impersonation. Each misdemeanor is
punishable by up to six months in jail. Judge John Walsh released
Kapp without bail and scheduled a Nov. 5 hearing.
   ``The conduct in question arises from a medical problem,'' said
Kapp's lawyer, Barry Bohrer. ``Mr. Kapp has taken steps to address
and cure that problem.''
   The charges are based on two calls, one in April and one in May.
In each case, the caller used the name of a physician actually on
staff.
   Kapp was chief legal counsel for American Home Products for two
years until he left about three months ago, said Charles Hagan, who
served as chief legal counsel before Kapp.
   A June memorandum signed by Kenneth Raske, president of the
Greater New York Hospital Association, warned member institutions
that several hospitals had received calls similar to those Kapp has
been accused of making.

<HEAD>Students Strike for Independence in Ukraine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of students went on strike Monday in
Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, to support hunger strikers'
demands for independence, Soviet media reported.
   As many as 50,000 students blocked central streets and marched
to the Ukrainian parliament building, where some held a sit-in
protest, the independent news agencies Interfax and Postfactum
said.
   The Ukraine is one of 13 Soviet republics seeking greater
autonomy from the central government in Moscow. Although its
parliament has declared sovereignty - defined as the right to
overrule national laws - the students contend the republic should
move more quickly and decisively toward secession.
   The news agencies said 70 to 200 of the protesters broke through
a ring of security guards around the parliament building to hold
the sit-in.
   Meanwhile, another column of students marched to Kiev
University, occpied one of its main buildings, hoisted a blue and
yellow Ukrainian flag and announced an ``occupation strike,''
Interfax said.
   Postfactum said veterans of the war in Afghanistan ``took part
in organizing the demonstration and protecting its participants.''
But no police action against the students was reported.
   The state-run Soviet press has devoted little attention to the
Ukrainian student movement. Interfax and Postfactum are independent
agencies established the past two years that distribute information
primarily by fax.
   Student leaders could not be reached by telephone Monday night
for independent confirmation.
   Several dozen students set up a tent camp and began the hunger
strike in Kiev two weeks ago. Seven opposition members of
parliament joined the hunger strike five days ago, and an unknown
number of additional hunger strikers have since set up ``solidarity
camps'' in five other Ukrainian cities, according to Interfax.
   Oles Doniy, a leader of the Ukrainian Students' Union,
reportedly read a list of demands to the parliament on Monday,
including the resignation of the regional government.
   Leonid Kravchuk, chairman of the Ukrainian Council of Ministers,
refused to step down but told the parliament he was willing to
start a dialogue with the students, Postfactum said.
   The students are also demanding that the Ukraine nationalize
Communist Party property, refuse to sign a new union treaty with
the other Soviet republics, require Ukrainians drafted into the Red
army to serve within the republic's borders, dissolve the
republic's parliament and call new elections.
   Postfactum quoted a student coordinating group as saying that 14
vocational schools, 17 higher educational institutions, 11
technical schools and several research institutes and high schools
were on strike.

invaded. Most of their heavy weapons were captured by Iraq, but
some combat jets and tanks were saved.
   The GCC and other Gulf Arab forces total around 144,500 men, 330
combat aircraft, 800 tanks and 36 major naval units.
   They are supported by:
   EGYPT - It has pledged up to 20,000 troops with tanks and heavy
artillery. About 14,000 troops - including paratroopers, commandos,
chemical warfare specialists and infantry - are in Saudi Arabia.
Several thousand more soldiers from the 3rd Armored Division and
the 3rd Mechanized Infantry Division, are expected in the next few
days. Five hundred troops are in the United Arab Emirates.

missiles; more than 330 surface-to-air missile launchers, including
captured Kuwaiti systems; 500-plus combat aircraft, including
Soviet-supplied long-range Su-24 fighter-bombers and advanced
MiG-29 interceptors. The equipment is spread around an estimated 25
airbases.
   Its main naval units are a training frigate with anti-submarine
torpedoes, an estimated eight Soviet-built missile-attack craft and
six torpedo boats.
   In Kuwait, Iraq has an estimated 10 divsions, four of them
armored, totaling 170,000 troops; 3,500 T-55 and T-62 tanks, and
1,700 artillery pieces in what appear to be defensive positions.
   About 250,000 men, including the seven Republican Guard
divisions with up to 1,300 tanks and 750 guns, are in southern Iraq
as a tactical reserve. Silkworm anti-ship missiles are believed to
have been deployed to counter any U.S. amphibious landing in
Kuwait. FROG-7 battlefield missiles have also been deployed,
including batteries captured in Kuwait.

<HEAD>Justice Department Backtracks from Earlier Proposal on Fines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department on Monday urged
adoption of sentencing guidelines for corporations convicted of
crimes that would force judges to impose fines based on the
seriousness of the offense.
   But the department shied away from a proposal it had earlier
advanced under which a company involved in a massive fraud could be
fined twice its gain or twice the loss to its victims.
   The department had endorsed this proposal last February when the
U..S. Sentencing Commission was debating two different proposals
for corporate sentencing guidelines.
   The department rescinded its support for one of the proposals
under consideration, as well as its own suggestion, after receiving
an inquiry from the White House, which had been contacted by
business groups expressing concern over stiff fines.
   The letter by then-Deputy Attorney General Donald B. Ayer
endorsing the proposal had been sent without the permission of
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, the department said.
   Since that dispute, which contributed to Ayer's resignation on
May 11, the Justice Department has reviewed its position. It
reiterated its support Monday for a proposal that sets fines
according to the severity of the offense.
   The commission was set up under a 1984 law designed to eliminate
disparity in sentences. It has already promulgated complicated
guidelines for punishing individuals according to the type of
offense and the defendant's criminal history. But last winter the
commission put off adopting guidelines for sentencing corporations
convicted of crimes.
   ``The system we are advocating will result in stiff corporate
sanctions,'' deputy assistant attorney general Paul L. Maloney told
reporters.
   ``We support a system of imposing fines that captures the
seriousness of the offense as measured by the commission's existing
ranking of offenses'' in the guidelines for individuals, Thornburgh
said in a letter to the commission that was released by the
department.
   ``We believe that an offense-level approach, rather than an
approach based on gain or loss, accomplishes this purpose,''
Thornburgh said.
   The seriousness of the offense, and therefore the size of the
fine, would be determined by a number of factors, including whether
top officials were involved in the crime or whether the company had
a history of similar misconduct.
   Bribery or threats to national security also could lead to
higher fines, the department said.
   Under the proposal outlined by the Justice Department, companies
that report wrongdoing as soon as it is discovered and cooperate
with prosecutors would be credited with lower fines.
   Corporate lawyer Victoria Toensing, a former senior Justice
Department official who had argued against adoption of earlier
proposals, praised the department's letter as offering a ``sensible
approach'' for punishing corporate misbehavior.
   The Justice Department's proposal would help courts distinguish
between responsible corporations that are prosecuted for the
actions of rogue employees and those whose management flagantly
flout the law, she said.
   The department essentially endorses the same proposal it had
supported earlier this year. But Thornburgh's letter said the
department no longer supports a provision it had advanced to fine
companies the greater amount of tiwce its gain or the loss to
victims.
   Maloney said deparment reviewed comments filed with the
Sentencing Commission in deciding on its new position. The White
House approved the letter that Thornburgh sent the Sentencing
Commission but did not participate in the department's decisions,
Maloney said.

   A man already facing the death penalty
in Nebraska for killing two boys there was found guilty of murder
Monday in the stabbing and strangling of an 11-year-old boy more
than eight years ago in Portland.
   John J. Joubert, 27, originally from Portland, was found guilty
in the August 1982 killing of Richard Stetson.
   Joubert sat expressionless and blinked as the jury's verdict was
read after less than two hours of deliberations. No sentencing date
was set.
   Joubert already is scheduled to be executed in Nebraska's
electric chair on Dec. 7 for murdering two boys, age 12 and 13,
there in 1983. He had been an airman stationed at Offutt Air Force
Base outside Omaha when those crimes took place.
   Prosecutors had said Joubert would be returned to Nebraska to
face the sentence there no matter what happened at his trial in
Maine.
   His lawyer, Liisa Hamilton, said she expects him to appeal the
Maine verdict, and will seek to withdraw his guilty pleas in the
Nebraska murders.
   Assistant Attorney General Eric Wright, who prosecuted Joubert
in Maine, said he would seek Maine's maximum life prison sentence
for Joubert. Wright also explained why Maine sought to try a man
already on death row in another state.
   ``I think people in this state need to understand that we wanted
to do our best to make sure that if he ever got out from under his
death sentence in Nebraska he'd have no place to go but Thomaston
to die,'' said Wright, referring to a state prison.
   Joubert's reaction to the verdict was, ``No comment.''
   Before the jurors began deliberations, they were challenged by
both the defense and the prosecution to carefully compare casts of
Joubert's teeth to photos of bite marks on the victim's leg.
   Wright said the casts match the tooth marks. Hamilton said they
don't necessarily match, and said she was unconvinced the marks on
Stetson's body were left by teeth.
   But the marks proved pivotal in the jury's final decision, as
did testimony from a journalist who interviewed Joubert after the
killing, said forewoman Terry Blazek, of Waldoboro.
   Blazek said jurors were unaware of Joubert's Nebraska
convictions.
   ``Every single one of us had no idea about what happened in the
other states,'' she said.
   Because of pretrial publicity, Joubert's trial was moved from
Portland to Wiscasset, a small coastal town about 30 miles to the
north.
   Prosecutors relied heavily on testimony from a journalist who
wrote a book about Joubert and claimed that, during an interview
about his crimes, Joubert did not deny he killed Stetson.
   In his final address to the jury, Wright took issue with the
defense attorney's attempts to link an alternative suspect to the
crime, saying that there was no evidence to support that.
   Wright also labeled as ``unreliable'' the testimony of Dr.
Norman D. Sperber, a forensic dentist called by the defense who
said it was unlikely Joubert's teeth left the marks. The prosecutor
said Sperber's testimony was riddled with inconsistencies and
contradictions.
   Hamilton attacked the testimony of Mark Pettit, a television
journalist who has interviewed Joubert for a book he wrote about
the defendant and his crimes.
   Pettit testified that when he asked Joubert if he killed
Stetson, Joubert responded: ``I can't lie to you. I can't tell you
I didn't do it.''
   Hamilton questioned why Pettit failed to go to the police with
that information.
   ``Why would he make that statement to a reporter, of all
people?'' said Hamilton.

   An administrator wanted to show the new
president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology the door to
his office Monday. But he couldn't find it.
   Student pranksters wanted to lay out a welcome for Charles M.
Vest, the university's 15th president. They hid the doorway behind
a bulletin board with clippings from the student newspaper - the
banner headline read ``Vest Takes Over Monday.''
   The ``hack'' - as such pranks are known at MIT - was so
successful that the administrator thought he was on the wrong
floor.
   Vest, who arrived just after the confusion had cleared, was
undeterred. The bulletin board was moved to a place of honor in the
hallway. Vest went to work, toting a bottle of champagne given him
by the pranksters.
   Vest succeeds Paul E. Gray, who had served since 1980.
   He served as provost and vice-president for academic affairs at
the University of Michigan for two years. Before that he was dean
of the university's College of Engineering for three years.

   Hundreds of prominent Kuwaiti exiles
vowed Monday at the conclusion of a three-day conference to return
home with the al-Sabah rulers and liberate Kuwait from the Iraqi
occupying forces.
   They insisted in a communique there will be ``no bargaining and
no negotiating on Kuwait's sovereignty, independence and
territorial security.''
   Conference sources said it was tantamount to a message to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein rejecting any settlement that falls short
of a total pullout of Iraqi troops that invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Reports from Moscow said Saddam might withdraw in return for
some Kuwaiti territory along the Persian Gulf. And in Tunis, Yasser
Arafat, chief of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said Saddam
was showing a ``certain flexibility'' regarding the occupation.
   Iraq invaded its oil-rich neighbor after a dispute over the
Kuwaiti islands of Warba and Bubiyan, which would provide Iraq with
an outlet on the gulf. Saddam also claimed Kuwait was stealing oil
from the Rumailah oilfield that crosses 2 miles into Kuwaiti
territory. Nearly all the oilfield is in Iraq.
   Conference sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Saddam appeared to be contemplating a partial withdrawal that would
let him keep Bubiyan, Warba and the Rumailah oilfield.
   About 750 Kuwaiti business executives, economists and
politicians attended the conference, which focused on their
country's plight and its future. They urged the U.N. Security
Council to pursue ``all available means'' to ensure an Iraqi
withdrawal and enable its former rulers to return.
   Oil Minister Rashid al-Ameeri told reporters Iraqi troops have
placed mines around Kuwaiti oil fields, refineries and other
installations. The Iraqis also have stolen equipment from Kuwaiti
oil facilities, he said.
   ``The damage to the oil industry in Kuwait is huge,'' Ameeri
said. ``Almost everything is damaged.''
   The conference was called in large part as a manifestation of
solidarity between the people and the exiled leadership.
   With prominent opposition ranks represented, it was also meant
to show Saddam his call for replacing the al-Sabah leadership
through a referendum would run into a stone wall.
   The crown prince and prime minister, Sheik Saad al-Abdullah
al-Sabah, presided.
   He told Iraq's leaders in his closing address: ``You have no
place in Kuwait and you will have to leave it through peace or war,
if need be.''
   Saad assured the estimated 300,000 citizens in occupied Kuwait:
``You are not alone in your struggle against the tyranny of the
Iraqi regime.''
   Originally, 800,000 citizens were in Kuwait.
   The communique declared ``our condemnation and detestation of
all oppression, murder, torture, looting and terrorism committed by
the forces of the Iraqi regime against unarmed and innocent
civilians in Kuwait.
   ``We declare . . . our solidarity with our legitimate leadership
in the persons of our emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and his
crown prince.''
   Fatima Hussein, wife of Kuwaiti Planning Minister Suleiman
Abdul-Razzak al-Muttawa, told a news conference Iraq is fencing off
northern Kuwait - territory Saddam has long coveted.
   ``The Iraqis . . . apparently plan to gulp up Bubiyan and the
northeastern oilfield,'' said Mrs. Hussein, who fled Kuwait last
week.
   She said the fence extended from the northeastern Matla area,
with one third of the Kuwait territory north of the fence, abutting
Iraq's Basra region.
   She said this area includes Warba and Bubiyan and the part of
the Ratqa oil field that extends into Iraq under the name of
Rumailah. Only about 5 percent of the oilfield is in Kuwait.
   She said occupation forces were marking empty houses for Iraqi
occupation and three huge statues of Saddam were being erected in
Kuwait City.
   The communique asked Arab powers that had been sympathetic with
Iraq to reconsider, and also said Kuwait still supports the
Palestinian struggle ``to regain their homeland and rights from
Israel'' despite the position taken by Palestinian leaders against
Kuwait.
   It said Kuwait bears no grudges against the people of Iraq -
``We know for certain . . . (they) are helpless and await the hour
of salvation when the tyrant of Baghdad and his clique fall.''
   The conference was meant also to map post-liberation reform
blueprints that call for a democratic system of rule based on free
elections.
   The communique stated in general that ``the people of Kuwait
stick to their national unity and legitimate system of government
which is based on consultation, democracy and participation in
government in the shadow of the 1962 constitution.''
   There was no sign whether opposition ranks received assurances
they sought beyond good intent.
   The conference opened Saturday with an ovation for the emir and
his crown prince when he promised more Western-style democracy.

<HEAD>House Democrats Deficit Bill Would Raise Most Americans' Taxes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS new grafs 14-15: ``House Republicans,'' with new GOP
budget plan</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Democratic deficit-reduction plan under
attack from the Bush administration would raise taxes on all but
the poorest Americans, socking the richest 1 percent with increases
averaging nearly $14,000 a year.
   The proposal would cut taxes slightly on those with incomes
under $20,000 a year, according to an analysis Monday by the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation. Those above the $200,000 income
level would face a 7.4 percent tax increase.
   For people between those extremes, the legislation would result
in tax increases in the 1 percent range. That would result from
putting higher consumer taxes on alcohol and tobacco; giving up
next year's income tax adjustment to offset inflation, and raising
the amount of wages subject to the Medicare tax.
   Economists for the House Ways and Means Committee, which wrote
the proposal, estimated its tax changes and cost increases for
Medicare beneficiaries would cost the average family $352 next
year.
   Analysts said:
   -The poorest one-fifth of families, with after-tax income
averaging $7,316, would get a $14 tax cut.
   -The second-poorest one-fifth, averaging $16,917, would pay $114
more.
   -The middle group, averaging $25,896, would pay $183 more.
   -The second-richest 20 percent, averaging $36,481, would face a
$280 tax increase.
   -The top 20 percent, whose incomes average $81,934, would pay
$1,173 more.
   Those with incomes averaging over $428,000 - the richest 1
percent - would face a $13,951 tax increase.
   Although other deficit plans are being considered, the House
Democratic version is getting most of the attention now because of
the administration's opposition and because it seems to have
support from most of the party's House members.
   President Bush, after meeting with the congressional Republican
leaders, Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Rep. Bob Michel of Illinois,
said Monday that they were ``pretty much on the same wavelength''
in preferring a different tax increase approved by the Senate
Finance Committee. ``What I'll do is say the action's in the
Congress and I will take a look at what comes out,'' Bush told
reporters on a campaign trip to Texas.
   House Republican leaders, after days of indecision and disputes
among the rank and file, decided Monday to advance a budget plan of
their own with broad spending cuts and no dramatic tax increases.
   The only new levies would be some of the increases Bush proposed
in his budget last January. In a bow to the party's conservative
wing, the GOP plan would not increase taxes on the wealthiest
Americans. But neither would it cut the capital gains tax, a
long-time goal of the president.
   Unlike the House Democrats' plan, the Finance Committee version
would avoid changes in income tax rates but would limit itemized
deductions for people earning over $100,000.
   The Finance panel's plan would raise taxes by just under 3
percent for families in the $20,000-to-$50,000 income range; 1.9
percent for those between $50,000 and $75,000 and 3.5 percent for
those between $100,000 and $200,000. The $200,000-plus group would
pay 3.7 percent more.
   Because differences between the House Democrats' tax plan and
the Senate Finance Committee version will take some time to
resolve, it becomes more likely that Bush will order the government
shut down Saturday morning for the second time this month.
   More than two weeks into the new budget year, Congress has yet
to enact the first of 13 required appropriation bills. A stopgap
spending measure expires at midnight Friday and Bush has said he
will not agree to another unless Congress has approved a
deficit-reduction plan that the administration supports.
   House liberals say their bill would reverse a 1980s trend that
saw higher-income Americans take an increasing share of the
national wealth. They note a Congressional Budget Office conclusion
that the richest 5 percent of Americans saw their after-tax income
rise by 5.4 percent between 1980 and 1990 while all other groups
lost ground.
   The Democratic plan would raise taxes by $148.6 billion over the
next five years and require those with incomes above $50,000 to pay
about two-thirds of that increase.
   It would raise from 28 percent to 33 percent the top income tax
rate paid by those with highest incomes and require those earning
over $1 million to pay an extra 10 percent tax. A new 10 percent
tax would be levied on part of the price of boats, private planes,
furs, cars and jewelry. And the $51,300 maximum annual wage on
which the 1.45 percent Medicare tax is paid would be raised to
$100,000.
   The liberal proposal dropped provisions in other plans that
would raise the tax on gasoline and limit itemized deductions
allowed people with incomes over $100,000 a year. Keeping hands off
the gas tax appeals to rural lawmakers while those from New York
and California especially oppose limiting deductions.
   To make up revenue that other plans would get from the gas tax,
liberals propose to forgo next year's scheduled inflation
adjustments in the tax brackets and personal exemptions.
   That would mean higher taxes for everybody who files a return.
The least impact would be on those with the highest incomes, who -
since they already would be paying the highest rate - face no
danger of being pushed by inflation into a higher tax bracket.

   Nicaragua's consul in Miami, a nephew of President
Violeta Chamorro, on Monday denied new reports linking him to
cocaine trafficking as part of a ``guns-for-drugs'' scheme for the
Contras in the mid-1980s
   Adolfo ``Popo'' Chamorro said he knew nothing of a federal
investigation growing out of testimony by a Colombian drug pilot
who said he paid the younger Chamorro millions of dollars for drug
shipments.
   ``Never in my life have I had anything to do with this type of
illicit activity,'' Chamorro said. He said neither Mrs. Chamorro's
government nor the United States would have allowed him to take his
high-profile post as Nicaraguan consul in Miami if he were under
suspicion.
   News reports about the case only help the Sandinistas, whose
leftist government was fought by the Contras, and ``give arms to
attack the new democratic government of Nicaragua,'' the newly
appointed official said.
   Two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity have told The
Associated Press that Chamorro - along with Octaviano Cesar,
brother of Mrs. Chamorro's top aide, Alfredo Cesar - are the
subjects of an investigation by the Customs Service and other
agencies.
   Chamorro, 41, abruptly adjourned the news conference when asked
if U.S. authorities warned him that drug trafficker George Morales
was under indictment when the U.S.-backed Contras accepted cash and
planes from him in 1984.
   Before walking out, Chamorro said both the United States and
directors of the Contra group he helped lead had authorized all
transactions with Morales, and that he knew nothing about drug
charges.
   Accusations linking Chamorro with alleged ``guns-for-drugs''
deals are not new. Morales testified before a Senate committee in
1987 that Chamorro and Octaviano Cesar arranged the trade of guns
and drugs on a Costa Rican ranch owned by U.S.-born Contra
supporter John Hull.
   Morales said he was certain the CIA and the U.S. government
authorized the deals, in part because his drug indictment was
ignored by the U.S. attorney's office for two years while he helped
the Contras. He was not taken into custody until a second
indictment in 1986 and is now serving a 16-year sentence.
   Chamorro's ex-wife, Marta Healey, who married drug pilot Richard
Healey after separating from Chamorro, reportedly knew Morales and
made the first connections between the trafficker and the Contras.
   ``That you'll have to ask her, I really don't know,'' Chamorro
said Monday when asked about his ex-wife's links to Morales.
   During the 1987 hearings, Chamorro and Cesar acknowledged
receiving help from Morales, and Cesar said he suspected Morales
was involved with smuggling. But both men denied any involvement
with drugs.
   At Monday's news conference, Chamorro distributed a July 1988
letter from the committee's chairman U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.,
saying the Senate investigation had uncovered no evidence linking
him to trafficking.
   But Kerry's spokesman Michael Meehan said Monday that the letter
was no longer valid.
   ``There are three years and plenty of facts that have come
forward'' since the hearings, said Meehan. He mentioned the
testimony of Colombian drug pilot Fabion Ernesto Carrasco in a
Tulsa, Okla., case seven months ago.
   Carrasco testified he paid millions of dollars to Chamorro and
Octaviano Cesar for cocaine flown into Florida by planes that, in
turn, carried arms to Central America.
   Carrasco's attorney in Miami, John Mattes, refused to comment on
the testimony except to say prosecutors and the Tulsa jury had
apparently found it credible.
   Carrasco testified he met Chamorro, Octaviano Cesar and Morales
at a Miami restaurant in June 1984 to plan the guns-for-drugs
arrangement. He said he was the co-pilot on one subsequent flight,
and was ordered by Morales to pay the other two men for the cocaine
after successful drug flights.
   In all, a half-dozen flights, each carrying 300 to 400 kilograms
of cocaine, were made from Central America to the United States,
Carrasco and Morales said.

   The Interparliamentary Union

<HEAD>Defense Officials Claim Support for `Long Haul' in Gulf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Monday said
Washington is prepared for a ``long haul'' in the gulf and
Americans are willing to keep troops deployed there for years.
   At a news conference after talks with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, Cheney rejected the notion of a quick strike or any
deadline for sanctions to force Iraq from Kuwait.
   British Defense Secretary Tom King also said his nation is
prepared to keep forces in the gulf indefinitely.
   Cheney arrived in Britain on Sunday at the start of a 10-day
European tour to discuss the gulf crisis. He goes to Moscow on
Tuesday and then to Paris.
   ``No one should make the mistake of assuming this is the kind of
operation which will be over in a very short period of time,'' said
Cheney. ``The United States is prepared for the long haul if that
is what it takes to get the job done.''
   ``The pressure is going to tell,'' King said. ``It was never
going to be a quick fix, a two-week wonder.''
   But Cheney said he was certain sanctions were working. He
predicted the embargoes will erode Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's
political base within months and reduce the fighting ability of his
1 million-troop army.
   ``If I were in his (Saddam's) place tonight, I would be
concerned over the next few months he will see the erosion of his
political base within Iraq, the erosion of his economy within Iraq,
and the erosion of the capability of his enormous military
machine.''
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd suggested last week that
the effectiveness of sanctions should be assessed within weeks.
   Britain has deployed planes and naval ships to the gulf, and is
sending about 6,000 combat troops, including the ``Desert Rats''
tank regiment.
   In a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview earlier Monday,
Cheney said the American public would support keeping troops in
Saudi Arabia for ``some years.''
   ``We're there as long as the Saudis want us ... as long as it
takes to get the job done. And no one should underestimate our
staying power,'' he added.
   He also said he believed Iran will stick to the U.N.-supported
embargoes against Iraq despite strengthening diplomatic relations
with its former enemy.
   ``The Iranians are not, in our opinion, interested in seeing
Saddam Hussein succeed ... they've given every indication that they
will for the most part carry through and enforce sanctions,''
Cheney said.
   At the news conference, Cheney dismissed suggestions that U.S.
public support for the gulf deployment is eroding as attention
switches to domestic economic problems.
   ``The notion that somehow we have a short attention span ... a
few weeks or months, I don't think is valid,'' he said.

   Some textbooks donated by Norway for
public schools here will be destroyed because of ``very blunt''
sexual education passages, the deputy minister of education,
Hortensia Rivas, said Monday.
   She denied it was because of their ``leftist'' teachings.
   The texts were used in public schools under the former leftist
Sandinista administration.
   Ms. Rivas said the only ones to be destroyed are natural science
texts used in grades 5 and 6.
   ``Those books must be changed because they give a very blunt
sexual education,'' she said.
   She gave no details and said she did not know how many books
were included. There are 632,900 children in Nicaragua's public
schools in grades 1 through 6 and 84,000 more children at junior
and high school levels.
   The replacement will take place when the next school year
begins, in March 1991, Ms. Rivas said.
   Reading textbooks used in grades 2 and 3 also were replaced this
year.
   A news report from Oslo, Norway, said the 5-month-old
conservative government will destroy 4 million textbooks donated by
the previous Norwegian government to the Sandinistas.
   Education Minister Sofonias Cisneros has said many textbooks
used during the Sandinista era will be replaced because they are
highly politicized.

<TEXT>
   The United States did not give a go-ahead to
Syria in the ouster of Gen. Michel Aoun in Lebanon and still urges
all foreign forces to leave the country, a State Department
spokeswoman said Monday.
   ``If you're asking me, Did the United States give Syria a green
light? I would tell you, Absolutely not,'' spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler told reporters.
   She said U.S. officials had no contact with Syria about the
participation of Syrian troops in the weekend assault that forced
Aoun out of his Beirut enclave to refuge in the French Embassy.
   The U.S. government on Saturday urged all Lebanese to support
President Elias Hrawi, who has started reunifying Beirut and moving
to create a city free of armed groups after putting down Aoun's
11-month mutiny.
   Syrian and Lebanese troops defeated Aoun in an eight-hour
assault Saturday that killed 160 people and wounded 800.
   Asked if the United States backs Hrawi's government in its call
for Aoun to face a court of law in Lebanon, Ms. Tutwiler said,
``Our position has always been limited to advice that (Aoun) step
aside. We have never taken a position on what should happen to him
after doing so.''
   She said, however, that the U.S. government hopes the matter
``will not delay the urgent work of national reconciliation.''
   Ms. Tutwiler said Syrian forces apparently were requested to
help oust Aoun by the legitimate government of Lebanon, but she
added, ``It is longstanding United States policy that all foreign
forces in Lebanon leave.''
   Asked when a U.S. ambassador would be sent to Beirut, she noted
that the Senate has not yet confirmed a new nominee ``and our
determination on sending our ambassador back will be made, as it
has always been made, when you take into consideration safety.''
   She said the government has no reaction to Aoun's ouster beyond
Saturday's statement which regretted the loss of life and said,
``We hope that this ends a sad chapter in Lebanon's history and
that the Lebanese people can now move toward reconciliation and
rebirth of a united, sovereign and independent Lebanon.''

Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans may be getting closer to the ideal diet,
but they still eat too much fat, cholesterol and sodium, according
to a federal report discussed here Monday.
   The Department of Agriculture report on the nation's eating
habits - which includes the USDA's revised dietary guidelines - was
the focus of the 73rd annual American Dietetic Association meeting.
Participants discussed a draft of the report, which is scheduled
for release in its final form Nov. 5.
   As in the past, the USDA will appeal to Americans to consume
less saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol, try a variety of foods
that include plenty of vegetables, fruits and grain products, and
maintain a healthy weight.
   Current diets contribute to high rates of heart disease, high
blood pressure and diabetes, the report says. But Americans are
coming closer to reaching USDA guidelines for a healthy diet, it
said.
   ``Americans are doing pretty well,'' said Susan Welsh, the
USDA's director of human nutrition information services. ``We're
definitely moving in the right direction, but we still have a ways
to go.''
   Americans are meeting the USDA's recommended daily allowances
for nine of 15 essential vitamins and minerals, Welsh said.
   But while fat intake has decreased over the past four years from
40 percent to 36 percent of the average American's calories, that
level still is too high.
   ``The USDA has been recommending 30 percent of calories from
fat, so we have some work to do in that area,'' Welsh says.
   Health officials attending the meeting described how they are
attempting to persuade Americans to improve their diet.
   USDA representative Betty Peterkin said the revised dietary
guidelines are expected to be similar to earlier guidelines, but be
``more positive, not prohibitive'' in tone.
   The guidelines are expected to factor a person's body mass,
waist and hip size and medical status in determining an ideal
weight, Peterkin said.
   Previously, insurance industry tables used a person's height to
determine the ideal weight.
   The report said the guidelines will call for moderation,
cautioning Americans to avoid extremes in their diets, because both
excessive eating and excessive dieting can be harmful.
   Welsh said awareness is the main barrier to overcome before
Americans completely integrate the guidelines into their diets.
   ``There's often an inaccurate perception of one's own diet,''
she said. ``Earlier surveys show that 50 percent of Americans
surveyed think their diets are all right. But the surveys showed
that only 12 percent had healthy diets.''

   A jury of two men and four women,
one of whom is black, was selected Monday to hear the obscenity
trial of rap group 2 Live Crew.
   Broward Judge June Johnson said the jurors would be sworn in
Tuesday morning and sequestered until they decide if the band's
performance of four banned songs at a Hollywood nightclub violated
community standards for obscenity.
   If convicted, rappers Luther Cambell, Chris Wongwon and Mark
Ross each face up to a year in prison and fines of up to $1,000.
   Defense attorney Allen Jacobi called the panel ``a pretty good
jury.''
   ``There's people from different walks of life. They're not all
from the suburbs,'' said Jacobi. ``There's a couple of young
people; there's a black woman. They all seem to be inquisitive.''
   Band members and their attorneys argued the panel couldn't be
fair without young, black jurors. Prosecutors said the jurors' race
and age was irrelevant.
   The black woman is a retired cook with Phillips Petroleum. The
three alternates are two white men and a black woman.
   Their ages weren't released.
   Also on Monday, two Michigan concerts the group had planned were
canceled.
   Ferris State University officials cited liability concerns when
canceling a Sunday concert at the Big Rapids campus. Promoters
canceled a Saturday concert in Flint after city officials said they
had to pay $5,200 for extra police protection.

<HEAD>Guitarist Carlos Santana Sues Miller Beer Over Commercial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guitarist Carlos Santana sued the Miller
Brewing Co. Monday, accusing the beer manufacturer of malice and
fraud for televising a commercial he said mimicks his rendition of
the song ``Black Magic Woman.''
   The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount of damages. Santana's
lawyer, David Phillips of San Francisco, said damages sought could
amount to ``over $1 million.''
   Miller spokesman Steve Forsythe said the Wisconsin company knew
nothing about the suit and had no comment.
   The suit alleges Miller and its New York ad agency, Backer
Spielvogel Bates Inc. violated the federal trademark law.
   The commercial advertised Miller Lite Beer. The brewer and its
agency began running the commercial last fall and continued for
several months despite a demand to stop, the lawsuit says.
   The suit claims Miller knowingly used the commercial ``with the
imitation of Santana's distinctive guitar playing therein,'' to
help sell Miller Lite Beer.
   The 1970 hit song was written by Peter Green.
   Although Santana did not write the song, the suit said, ``the
rendition by Santana of ``Black Magic Woman'' has become such a
continuing popular musical success that the public identifies the
song as Santana's theme song...(his) musical signature.''

<HEAD>Hermitage Director Piotrovsky Dead at 82</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris B. Piotrovsky, director of the
world-renowned Hermitage Museum, died Monday in Leningrad of a
cerebral hemorrhage, Tass said. He was 82.
   Piotrovsky won fame in 1939 for his discovery of the ancient
civilization of Urartu, in present-day Armenia. Until his death, he
had been working as director of the prestigious Leningrad museum
that only recently under glasnost had begun to let some of its
treasures travel to the outside world.
   Piotrovsky published more than 200 works in the Soviet Union,
including ``The History and Culture of Urartu.'' His excavations in
the Armenia at Mount Karmir-Blur Hill uncovered the remains of an
Urartu period town and fortress.
   After nearly 15 years in archaeology, Piotrovsky became a member
of the Armenian Academy of Science in 1944. He became director of
the Leningrad branch of the predecessor to the Institute of
Archaeology in 1953, then took over leadership of the Hermitage in
1964, according to biographical encyclopedias.
   Among dozens of Soviet awards, Piotrovsky was awarded the 1974
Firdousi Prize for his research into the ancient cultures of
Transcaucasia and Iran, the official news agency said. He also was
an honorary member of the British, French and other foreign
academies of science.
   He took part in analyzing the remains of King Tut's tomb and
helped decipher dozens of rock drawings in Egypt, Tass said.
   During his tenure at the Hermitage, cultural freedom in the
Soviet Union expanded and contracted, and recently expanded again
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Hermitage, always a focal point of world artistic attention,
has taken some advantage of the openness by agreeing to show some
works long hidden and let others travel to foreign countries for
exhibit.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete. No successor was announced
at the Hermitage.

<TEXT>
   British designers have reinvented the Sixties with
a sexy, snappy '90s swing for next spring and summer.
   Nostalgia for the '60s isn't surprising for the country that
invented the miniskirt. But the designers didn't wallow in it. They
pushed it forward into the very modern Nineties with some of the
best collections seen here in years.
   The British look for 1991 is short, simple and sexy.
   The sportswear influence is strong, with cropped jackets and
shorts the hot favorites. But the big news is that dresses are
back, especially skimpy shifts ala Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and
Audrey Hepburn.
   It's definitely going to be a white summer in Britain, though
the color palette runs from black and navy to summer pastels,
occasionally vivid tropical hues, and a smattering of the bright
and bold prints featured in Milan.
   ``It's a '90s version of simplicity dressing,'' said designer
Benny Ong. ``I think the '60s heralded the innocence of it, and the
'90s makes a full circle and says now we have arrived. I think the
difference is, it's a realized woman who is dressing now - and
there is a choice.''
   Designers who lived through the '60s - Caroline Charles, Edina
Ronay and Jean Muir - and those too young to remember - Arabella
Pollen, Jasper Conran and Bruce Oldfield - showed very individual,
wearable collections with an accent on youth at shows over the
weekend and on Monday.
   Caroline Charles did trapeze-line coats and short little shifts,
some in black and white prints, set off by Jackie Kennedy-style
pillbox hats and big sunglasses.
   Arabella Pollen did her sexiest collection yet, featuring
houndstooth check jackets worn with hot pants or hipster miniskirts
and minishifts for evening decorated with pieces of cut mirror. ``A
sort of neon Hong Kong,'' the designer said.
   Bruce Oldfield featured a pared-down look with fluid nautical
print silk shifts, trapeze dresses over slinky jersey bodysuits,
and glamorous asymmetrical sand-colored chiffons with gilt chains
setting off the bust or derriere.
   Paul Costello did his classic linen separates in sherbet colors
and a lovely white linen shift but his back-to-front jacket dresses
in shiny brocades were less successful.
   Betty Jackson mixed figure-hugging pants with loose jackets and,
with an eye to the not-so-young, did some knee-length shifts. Edina
Ronay featured mint and pink pastel sequins for evening with
chiffon and raw silk in the same colors. Jasper Conran's lean and
fluid classically tailored jackets, shorts and short knife-pleated
skirts were back on the catwalk.
   Rifat Ozbek, who has the biggest international clout, opted for
a video presentation instead of a catwalk show. Titled
``Afrodizzia,'' it featured hot African colors, sequins and prints
as well as Rasta ragamuffins in African print leggings and rough
linen tops embroidered with compact discs.
   London also kept its reputation for the wild and wacky.
   Vivienne Westwood, who originated punk fashion and won this
year's Designer of the Year, marched to her own tune in her ``Cut,
Slash and Pull'' collection. It featured very demure '40s-style
tailored suits with midi-skirts alongside slashed and ripped denim
shorts and dresses and shocking bikinis and shorts embellished with
bow-tied phallic symbols.
   Westwood, honored Monday night at an award ceremony at Royal
Albert Hall, developed the punk look and incorporated anarchy into
fashion. One of Britain's most unorthodox and influential
designers, she has designed for the Sex Pistols, Boy George and
Bananarama.
   Pam Hogg's very sexy cotton bustiers, peek-a-boo catsuits, and
short-shorts in dark red, smoked green and mauve, were worn by
models with shaved heads and a wide grey stripe across their eyes.
   Workers For Freedom, the design duo of Graham Fraser and Richard
Nott who won the 1989 Designer of the Year award, picked ``Delicate
Bondage'' for their theme. Some models were strapped into soft
knee-length dresses with leather harnesses. Others wore brightly
printed kimono styles and shirts with evil eyes.
   Body Map's body-hugging ``Square'' collection showed the
influence of Mondrian prints. Ghosts featured clinging minis in
lime and tangerine.
   Red or Dead showed a short red playsuit in synthetic rubber
diving suit material, shorts with red shield stamps that peel off,
and baby dolls embroidered with ``Kiss Me Quick'' and other
sayings.
   Several designers noted there were very few American buyers and
said it was due to the weak dollar and strong British pound. But
Red or Dead spokeswoman Catherine Morris said it had brought down
its prices on clothes and was ``doing outrageously well in
America.''

<TEXT>
   Members of Parliament's upper house
told 53 U.S. senators on Monday that Pakistani courts, not the U.S.
government, will decide if ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
runs in this month's general election.
   In a letter to President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, 44 Pakistani
senators accused the U.S. senators of interfering in Pakistan's
domestic affairs and warned this could affect the already strained
relations between Washington and Islamabad.
   The letter comes at a time when anti-American sentiment is
growing over U.S. influence in this Moslem nation of 110 million
people and the suspension of $573 million in economic and military
assistance.
   The United States suspended aid on Oct. 1, demanding greater
assurances Pakistan does not have a nuclear weapon. Some
congressional members also want aid cut off if Ms. Bhutto is
disqualified from Oct. 24 parliamentary elections.
   The letter said that ``the question of eligibility of candidates
is not to be determined by U.S. senators but by courts of law
established under the constitution and law of Pakistan.''
   Ishaq Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto's 20-month-old government on
Aug. 6, citing charges of corruption, mismanagement and failure to
provide law and order. She is being tried before special one-judge
tribunals that have drawn fire from all quarters as being obviously
one-sided.
   News reports in the Pakistani press said the 53 U.S. senators
sent a letter to President Bush that spoke of deteriorating
U.S.-Pakistani relations if the 37-year-old Ms. Bhutto was not
allowed to run.
   Some of the most influential members of Pakistan's 89-member
Senate, where Ms. Bhutto's foes hold overwhelming control,
responded angrily.
   ``Political leaders should have the liberty to contest elections
as they desire. But no political leader should be above the law and
all leaders should obey the law,'' they wrote.
   They asked Ishaq Khan to convey to the Bush administration they
are not ready to compromise Pakistan's political sovereignty and
national honor and will not tolerate interference in matters
exclusively the concern of Pakistan.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Suspects Arrested in Parliament Speaker Killing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Search for killers of Egypt's Parliament
speaker continued for a fourth day with hundreds of suspects
rounded up Monday, including Iraqis, Palestinians and Jordanian
extremists.
   The Cabinet of Prime Minister Atef Sedki meanwhile recommended
stricter security measures to safeguard against terrorist attempts
after reviewing a report by Abdel-Halim Moussa, the interior
minister in charge of police.
   Moussa said in his report that the killing of Speaker Rifaat
el-Mahgoub, his driver and four security men Friday in Cairo was
carried out by Arabs who infiltrated the country by using
facilities provided to Egyptians returning from Kuwait and Iraq,
according to the state-run newspaper Al Gomhouria.
   The leading state-owned newspaper Al-Ahram said Monday that
security authorities have evidence the killers were Arabs who had
sneaked into Egypt.
   The government has accused Iraq of sending saboteurs to spread
terror in Egypt to punish it for its opposition to Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Some government officials and analysts have been speculating
that el-Mahgoub's murder was carried out by either Iraqi agents or
local Moslem fundamentalists.
   Iraq has denied any involvement in the assassination, saying the
accusations were ``based on the promotion of lies'' and meant to
``cover up popular indignation'' against Egypt's support of the
U.S.-led forces in the gulf region.
   Tuesday's editions of Cairos newspapers said up to 300 suspects
have been rounded up since Friday. They said 130 were arrested
Monday.
   There were 22 Palestinians, Iraqis, Jordanians and Lebanese
among those arrested Monday. No further breakdowns were given.
   The arrested Palestinians included a soldier in the the
Palestinian Liberation Army. The report, in Al-Akhbar, a third
state-owned daily, did not identify him further.
   All the arrested suspects resembled composite sketches of five
gunmen compiled from witnesses.
   Airport security officials said three Arabs carrying Australian,
American and Syrian passports were arrested Sunday, but the
official Middle East News Agency said the one with the U.S.
passport was released later.
   In addition to the Arabs, Al-Ahram said an unspecified number of
local Moslem extremists were arrested for questioning about their
possible connection with the assassination.
   Last week, Moussa announced the arrests of 35 alleged saboteurs
and warned of possible terror attacks by Iraqi agents. He warned
that officials would be targeted for assassination to punish Egypt
for its strong opposition to the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The Palestinians are suspected of being members of Abu Nidal's
Palestinian terrorist group. Recent reports said Abu-Nidal, who
split years ago with the Palestine Liberation Organization, has
moved his headquarters to Iraq from Libya.
   El-Mahgoub and the four security men were buried Saturday
following a state funeral led by President Hosni Mubarak.

<TEXT>
   House negotiators agreed Monday to give the
steel industry more time to comply with tougher new toxic air
pollution requirements, congressional sources said.
   The action moved a House-Senate conference committee one step
closer to overall agreement on the first reorganization of the
nation's federal clean air laws in 13 years.
   The development appeared to set the stage for a settlement with
the Senate over new controls on toxic chemical emissions from
industry as a whole.
   The section on toxic emissions and another section on acid rain
are the two major remaining unsettled issues before the conference
committee.
   Separate clean air bills, imposing new controls on factories,
utilities and automobiles, were approved by the House and Senate
earlier this year. The conference members have worked since
mid-July to try and resolve differences in the two bills.
   The talks between the House and Senate became stalled over the
weekend when the House members couldn't decide on whether special
considerations should be given to certain industries such as steel.
   The steel industry has vigorously argued that it would not be
able to comply with the new requirements by the end of the decade
and would have to shut down most of the nation's coke ovens.
   But by late Monday, the House negotiators decided to give steel
companies an additional 20 years, until the year 2020, to bring
coke ovens in line with the rest of industry. The Senate proposal
already has such a provision.
   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, who fought for special treatment for
the steel industry, said steel still would be faced with ``very,
tough standards.''
   Beginning in 1998, steel companies would have to begin meeting
specific ``milestones'' that will force the adoption of new
pollution control technologies, said Eckart in an interview.
   The reductions would be made primarily by installing new
pollution control technology. The agreement also would require
industry to take additional actions if health risks to residents
near a plant are still considered to exceed a certain level.
   With the issue of the coke ovens resolved, both Senate and House
sources expressed confidence an agreement can be worked out.
   Last week Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, and
House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., told the negotiating teams
they wanted a compromise clean air bill by midnight Sunday with
expectations of final floor votes this week.
   But the Sunday deadline passed with no agreement.

<HEAD>Spread of AIDS Virus Pushing Up Tuberculosis Cases</HEAD>

   Tuberculosis-related deaths should increase
sharply because of the ``parallel epidemic'' of AIDS, the World
Health Organization warned Monday.
   A survey by the Geneva-based group estimated that almost half of
the 6 million to 8 million people believed infected with the virus
that causes AIDS also have TB, which claims about 3 million lives
annually and is the No. 1 killer among contagious diseases.
   Data collected by WHO suggest those with both TB and the HIV
virus develop acquired immune deficiency syndrome ``dramatically''
faster.
   ``It is becoming a parallel epidemic and it is this trend that
has public health officials worried, '' said WHO Director-General
Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima.
   WHO estimates the number of HIV carriers could rise to 15
million to 20 million by the end of the century.
   ``Thus, because of the mirror nature of the two diseases, WHO
expects TB cases and deaths to rise sharply, especially in Africa,
Latin America, and South East Asia, '' said the survey.
   The agency estimates 2.4 million people in sub-Saharan Africa
are infected with both diseases; 300,000 in Latin America; 200,000
in Asia; 100,000 in the United States; and 50,000 in Europe.
   The AIDS virus is passed during sex or through bodily fluids,
but tuberculosis is transmitted through the air when infected
people cough or sneeze.
   Last year, nearly 8 million new TB cases were reported to WHO,
including 2.6 million in the less-developed countries of the
Western Pacific and 2.5 million in Southeast Asia.
   The death toll ranged from 932,000 in Southeast Asia to 42,000
in industrialized countries.
   The survey said the increase in TB cases in central and East
Africa is overburdening the medical system. If treated properly, 98
percent of infected TB patients can be cured, it said.
   In New York, cases of TB have doubled since 1980. As many as
100,000 new cases are possible in coming years, said Jack Adler,
director of the City Health Department's Bureau of Tuberculosis.

<TEXT>
   The House approved legislation Monday to
create the post of chief financial officer for the U.S. government,
a move designed to fight bureaucratic waste, fraud and
mismanagement.
   The measure passed on a voice vote and now goes to the Senate.
   Its chief sponsor, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., said the lack of
a watchdog official with jurisdiction over the entire federal
budget was one reason for a rash of scandals ``draining the federal
treasury and undermining public confidence in government.''
   ``It is almost inconceivable that an organization which controls
almost one-fourth of the country's gross national product has
incompatible and outmoded financial management systems,'' Conyers
said.
   The bill would create a ``centralized and professional
leadership structure'' at the Office of Management and Budget, he
said.
   The Bush administration opposes the bill, the OMB said in a
statement. While supporting efforts to improve government
management, the bill would create confusion and blur the lines
between the executive and legislative branches, it said.
   The administration favors establishing a deputy director for
management and a government-wide controller in OMB, as well as
chief financial officer positions in each department, the statement
said.
   A staffer with the House Government Operations Committee, which
Conyers chairs, said the bill had been amended to address some of
the administration's objections.
   For example, the latest version deletes a provision giving the
chief financial officer a four-year term. Also removed was a
requirement that the president give his reasons to Congress if he
fires the officer.
   The bill originally required a study of government accounting
standards. The administration said that would not be necessary
because the treasury secretary, comptroller general and OMB
director are establishing a Federal Accounting Standards Advisory
Board to perform the task.
   The comptroller general is a congressional officer in charge of
the General Accounting Office, a congressional agency.
   The latest version of the bill drops the study requirement. But
it would require the administration to submit accounting standards
developed by the new advisory board to Congress for approval before
implementation.

   President Francois Mitterrand said Monday he will
reject any request by Lebanese authorities to hand over rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun, who took refuge at the French Embassy in Beirut after
his weekend defeat.
   ``I will tell them in advance, `No,''' Mitterrand told a news
conference.
   ``Gen. Aoun is a refugee at the French Embassy. He has demanded
political asylum in France, and France has granted it to him. It is
a matter of honor for her (France). She will protect Gen. Aoun and
his security.''
   Aoun called on his rebel Christian soldiers to surrender in the
face of an attack by Syrian and Lebanese government forces
Saturday. But Lebanese authorities refuse to let him leave for
France, saying he should be put on trial.
   Aoun supporters occupying Lebanon's embassy in Paris meanwhile
alleged that Syrian troops are killing Aoun's captured officers
with gunshots to the head.
   A spokesman for the protesters said family members of the
officers had been contacted by telephone from Paris. He could not
provide an estimate of the number of men killed.
   The scores of Aoun supporters occupying the Paris embassy and
Lebanon's consulate in Marseille demand the general's safe passage
to France.
   Mitterrand said France recognized the government of President
Elias Hrawi and would not grant recognition to any Aoun-led
government-in-exile. Mitterrand also said Aoun's departure
eliminated any justification for the presence of foreign troops in
Lebanon.
   Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac and other leaders of the conservative
opposition urged Mitterrand to request an emergency meeting of the
U.N. Security Council to demand withdrawal of foreign troops from
Lebanon.
   Chirac also said France should stick to its offer of political
asylum for Aoun.
   Scores of Aoun's supporters occupied Lebanon's embassy in Paris
and consulate in Marseille on Monday, demanding his safe passage to
France after his defeat in Beirut.
   Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac and other leaders of the conservative
opposition urged Mitterrand to request an emergency meeting of the
U.N. Security Council to demand the withdrawal of foreign troops
from Lebanon.
   Chirac also said France should adhere to its offer of political
asylum for Aoun.
   France is home to thousands of Lebanese Christians.
   When Aoun began his rebellion a year ago, the French government
was sympathetic to his goal of resisting domination by Syria and
its Lebanese Moslem allies. This support eroded as Aoun
increasingly became perceived as an obstruction to any feasible
peaceful settlement.

   New York, Boston, and other eastern cities
are gambling with catastrophes far worse than last year's
California earthquake if they don't prepare better for a major
quake expected within 30 years.
   That gloomy prediction Monday from Ian Buckle, deputy director
of the National Center for Earthquake Engineering Research, shook
up a national quake conference two days before the anniversary of
the Oct. 17, 1989, Loma Prieta tremor.
   ``The earthquake in the Bay area last year is the writing on the
wall for the East,'' Buckle told more than 300 scientists,
government officials and engineers at a national quake conference.
   ``This is a race against time, and the odds of winning do not
look favorable,'' Buckle said.
   The California quake on Oct. 17, 1989, measured 7.1 on the
Richter scale, killed 67 people and caused an estimated $6 billion
in damage.
   If an equally strong temblor struck an East Coast city, hundreds
of thousands of apartment buildings would be in danger of
collapsing, along with some bridges, roads and railroad passes,
Buckle said. The result would be huge death and injury tolls and
tens of billions of dollars in damage, he said.
   Buckle said seismologists estimate there is a better that 60
percent chance that a magitude 6 quake will occur within 30 years.
The shaking in such a quake would be roughly 10 times less powerful
than in the California quake, but would still be very damaging in
regions of the country with building standards less strict than
California's.
   In September, researchers from the U.S. Geological Survey and
Virginia Polytechnic Institute published a study estimating the
chance of a damaging earthquake in the East. They said the chance
of a magnitude 6.0 quake somewhere in the east or lower Midwest is
29 percent by the year 2000, 64 percent by the year 2020 and 97
percent by the year 2090.
   The odds were highest in the lower Midwest which includes the
New Madrid fault zone, where the New Madrid fault lies next highest
in the Southeast and somewhat lower in New England.
   New York City, hit hard by a quake in 1884, may be doomed to
suffer some of the worst damage because of its dense population and
thousands of older buildings of unreinforced masonry.
   If the 1884 quake, estimated at 5.9 magnitude on the Richter
scale, occurred now, it would cause $11 billion to $26 billion in
damage, depending on its epicenter, Buckle predicted.
   ``There would be a great deal of structural damage to all the
unreinforced masonry, and more than half of Manhattan is of this
kind,'' said Buckle, a professor of civil engineering at the State
University of New York in Buffalo.
   Long suspension bridges and skyscrapers, which are built to
withstand strong wind, would be less vulnerable to earthquake
damage, he said.
   ``It's the apartment buildings - the 4-story, 5-story, 10-story
masonry buildings - that have the right dynamic characteristics and
the poor strength to be a recipe for disaster,'' he said.
   Buildings of that type are common all along the Atlantic
seaboard, where moderate and strong quakes have been recorded over
the past 200 years. Charleston was struck by a quake estimated at
7.5 magnitude in the 1800s and Boston had an estimated 7.0
magnitude in the 1700s.
   Some progress has been made in protecting East Coast buildings
from quakes, Buckle said.
   Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey, as well as New York City
and Memphis, Tenn., have either adopted or are very close to
adopting seismic provisions in their building codes. But he said
that would affect only new structures and wouldn't require older
buildings to be renovated.
   But more needs to be done, he said.
   ``The public clearly should learn what to do in an earthquake,''
he said. ``The drop-and-cover rules that California schoolchildren
are taught should be taught to schoolchildren in New York and along
the Atlantic seaboard. People should do things to improve the quake
resistance of their homes.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush on Monday condemned ``ghastly
atrocities'' by Iraqi forces in occupied Kuwait and warned Saddam
Hussein that, like Nazi officials after World War II, he may face a
war-crimes trial.
   ``Hitler revisited,'' Bush said of Saddam. ``But remember, when
Hitler's war ended, there were the Nuremberg trials.
   ``America will not stand aside, the world will not allow the
strong to swallow up the weak,'' the president said.
   Bush leveled his warning as he opened a two-day trip to boost
Republican election hopes in Texas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and
Michigan.
   The president combined his attack against Saddam with a blast at
Congress for failing to enact a $500 billion package of tax hikes
and spending cuts.
   ``The American people have every right to expect more from their
elected representatives,'' said Bush, picking up on a widespread
mood of public anger against elected officials.
   The two conflicts - one in the Middle East and the other on
Capitol Hill - have become the staples of Bush's campaign
appearances.
   ``Every day now, new word filters out about the ghastly
atrocities perpetrated by Saddam's forces,'' Bush said at a
fund-raising luncheon for Clayton Williams, the Republican
candidate for governor of Texas.
   Bush recounted stories of Kuwaiti babies being removed from
incubators so the machines could be sent to Baghdad. Similarly, he
said dialysis patients were taken from their machines so the
machines could be used in Iraq.
   In another instance, he said, two youngsters who distributed
leaflets were executed by Iraqi forces as their parents were forced
to watch.
   Bush said the incidents point up ``the cruel and senseless
suffering endured by the people of Kuwait; a systematic assault on
the soul of a nation.''
   The horrific descriptions paint a background against which the
United States may seek new action in the United Nations against
Iraq.
   Sources say the administration is considering a resolution that
would condemn Iraq's dismantling of Kuwait, declare Iraq
accountable for the damage there and specifically mention the
possibility of military action.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Justice
Department has been compiling a list of violations committed in
Kuwait by Iraqi forces. He said other countries are keeping similar
records.
   ``The president simply wanted to make the point that Saddam
Hussein has to be held accountable for his actions in Kuwait. We're
certainly open to considering various ways of doing that,''
Fitzwater said after Bush's reference to the Nuremberg trials.
   He said Bush's warning was aimed not only at Saddam but also at
officers of his armed forces and the soldiers themselves.
   On the political front, Bush - despite his 25 years of
government service - appeared to align himself with the
anti-establishment feeling among voters. ``I can't tell you what a
pleasure it is to be out of Washington,'' he said to applause in
Dallas.
   Attacking the Congress for its failure to enact a budget, Bush
said, ``If this is the best that the system can do, then it's time
to build a better budget system.''
   In the Texas race, Williams has outspent his Democratic opponent
2-1 and holds an 11 point lead, according to an independent poll
last week.
   Bush's second stop Monday was in Nebraska, where Republican Gov.
Kay Orr was trailing her Democratic challenger, businessman Ben
Nelson. The most recent survey done for the Omaha World-Herald said
Nelson led Mrs. Orr by 8 percentage points - 44 percent to 36
percent.
   In Omaha, Bush called Saddam a ``dictator bully'' and said his
aggression had been condemned by the United Nations as well as most
nations around the globe.
   ``In spite of that condemnation there is this systematic
dismantling of Kuwait which is accompanied by unprecedented
brutality,'' Bush said.
   ``It's an ugly scene,'' Bush added. He was loudly applauded when
he declared ``all that does is make me convinced even more than
ever that this aggression by Saddam Hussein will not stand.''
   After a late-night flight Bush was spending the evening in Des
Moines where he will resume campaigning on Tuesday.
   Bush made the budget mess a centerpiece of his speeches.
   He said Congress has missed its own budget deadlines 37 times in
the last 10 years.
   ``Twice now this year, I've signed emergency legislation to add
more time to the clock,'' the president said. ``Well, this Friday,
time's up. The American people deserve more than this stopgap
government.''
   His statement reinforced administration warnings that Bush will
not sign another spending extension, preferring instead to let the
government shut down in the absence of a budget agreement.
   Bush was unwilling to say what he might accept in the way of tax
increases.
   ``I'm not going to say what I will or won't do,'' Bush told
reporters on Air Force One as it left Washington. ``That managed to
get a little confused last week.''
   Over the course of the week, Bush signaled he was willing to
accept higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans in exchange for a
sharply lower capital gains tax rate. Then the White House said
Bush had not espoused that strategy. Finally, the White House said
Bush liked the idea but didn't think Congress would approve it.
   The president indicated a preference Monday for a Senate Finance
Committee plan that would not affect income tax rates. Instead, it
would raise taxes on gasoline, alcohol, tobacco and luxury items
and raise Medicare taxes.
   ``One of my biggest fears,'' he said, ``has always been that the
Congress will continue to pay for its spending habits by raising
income taxes on everybody.''

<HEAD>Sacramento Union Refuses to Advertise NC-17 Films</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sacramento Union said Monday it will
reject advertising for all movies carrying the new adults-only
NC-17 rating.
   The Union, a morning paper with a circulation of 70,000, joins
the 180,000-circulation Birmingham News in Alabama, which last week
banned NC-17 ads. The rating excludes all patrons under age 17.
   The Union's editor, Joseph Farah, said films carrying the new
rating are ``nothing more than X-rated films with a polite new
name.''
   ``We consider the Sacramento Union a strong family paper and we
believe accepting X-rated movie ads - whatever they're called -
would be a contradiction of our image and philosophy,'' he said in
a statement.
   The NC-17 mark was created by the Motion Picture Association of
America on Sept. 26 to replace the X rating.
   The X rating had became synonymous with hard-core sex films.
Filmmakers asked that the new rating be created to identify
mature-themed movies that they believed were not pornographic.
   ``Henry and June,'' a Universal Pictures release, is the first
movie bearing the new NC-17 rating. The film is based on the erotic
diaries of writer Anais Nin and chronicles her affairs with writer
Henry Miller and his wife, June.
   The film, playing on 189 screens, grossed $1.4 million over the
weekend for a strong per-screen average of $7,408. So far, it has
made $2.8 million.

<HEAD>House Overhauls Reservist Protection Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House passed legislation Monday that would
make certain that reservists called to active duty would not lose
their jobs, insurance coverage or rented homes.
   The bill, approved by voice vote and sent to the Senate, would
modernize and strengthen protections previously granted for those
called to active duty.
   Sponsors said activation of reserve forces in the Persian Gulf
crisis made necessary an overhaul of the law.
   One provision is designed to prevent eviction of a service
member's family living in a rented home or apartment.
   While current law prohibits eviction without a court order, the
protection only extends to leases where the monthly payment is less
than $150. The bill would extend the ceiling to $1,200.
   Another provision provides that when reservists return to their
jobs, employers must provide health insurance benefits as if there
had been no job interruption.
   Insurers would be required to reinstate the coverage as if no
military service had occurred.
   Employment protection in current law only guarantees a reserve
forces member a return to a prior job for 90 days of service. The
House bill would extend the protection for whatever period the
service member was on active duty.
   A special provision for health care professionals would relieve
them from paying liability insurance premiums such as malpractice
insurance. The coverage would be suspended for the active duty
period.
   The bill would postpone court actions for damages while the
insurance was suspended. The action could be resumed when the
insurance was reinstated.

   The space shuttle Discovery
cut short its trip from California to Cape Canaveral because of bad
weather Monday and was to spend the night at thi base in the
Florida Panhandle.
   Discovery, riding atop a specially outfitted jumbo jet, left
Dryden Research Center in the California desert Monday morning and
was supposed to arrive at the Kennedy Space Center before
nightfall.
   However, NASA said low clouds caused the Boeing 747 carrier
plane to cancel a planned refueling stop at Kelly Air Force Base in
San Antonio and reroute to Sheppard Air Force Base at Witchita
Falls, Tex. There, the aviation fuel needed wasn't readily
available, and takeoff was delayed until it was too late to reach
the Cape on Florida's Atlantic coast before dark, officials said.
   Discovery, which launched the Ulysses spacecraft toward the
sun's poles Oct. 6, is scheduled to fly again in February on a
secret Pentagon mission.

<HEAD>Campesinos March, Guerrillas Recall '79 Coup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 3,000 people, most of
them peasants, marched through downtown San Salvador on Monday to
demand land, respect for human rights and demilitarization of this
war-ravaged society.
   The march came on the anniversary of a 1979 coup by progressive
military officers. The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front,
the guerrilla army battling the U.S.-backed government, issued a
communique calling for renewed commitment to the goals of the '79
revolution.
   ``To defend the land is to achieve democracy!'' shouted the
marchers, whose ranks were augmented by some workers and students.
   ``Instead of murderous air force planes, land for the
campesinos!'' they shouted.
   The marchers also chanted slogans calling for a purge and
reduction of the armed forces. The FMLN, which is participating in
monthly peace talks with the government, has demanded a purge and
drastic pruning in return for its own demobilization.
   The 1979 coup that ousted Gen. Carlos Humberto Romero was
designed to check repression and corruption, promote democracy and
make for a more just distribution of national wealth.
   But the young officers who carried it out were opposed by a
still-powerful old guard, and deepening polarization gave way to
civil war.
   The rebels, in a communique, called on young officers to back a
negotiated solution to the civil war, help solve cases of human
rights abuse in which the army is implicated and work for
democracy.

<TEXT>
   Israel's U.N. envoy said Monday his
government would not receive a U.N. delegation to investigate the
Israeli police killing of 19 Palestinians, but that Israel would
not keep out individual tourists.
   After meeting Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to
inform him of the Israeli government's official position regarding
a mission, Ambassador Johanan Bein told reporters, ``If they want
to get in as tourists, they can come. If they come, they can see
anybody - Israel is a free country.
   ``But a delegation from the secretary-general will not be
received by the government of Israel.''
   U.N. officials said they would not comment or announce a
decision on sending a mission until they received answers to their
questions from Israel.
   President Bush said as he left on a political trip to Texas and
Nebraska, ``We want to see that U.N. resolution fully
implemented.''
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler said America
was ``disappointed that the Israeli government has decided not to
cooperate with the mission.''
   A stalemate could mean another meeting by the Security Council,
which ordered a U.N. investigation Friday night, and open the door
to further council involvement, diplomats said.
   Israel opposes any U.N. visit at this time, even on a tourist
basis.
   Western diplomats said meanwhile that discussions were under way
to keep Security Council pressure on Iraq to force its withdrawal
from Kuwait. Some diplomats said, however, that pressing too far
could force the council to press further against Israel.
   A senior Kuwaiti official said diplomats were talking about a
possible resolution on reparations for damages to Kuwait, seizure
of Iraqi assets and limitations on the size of Iraqi missions and
on the movement of Iraqi diplomats abroad.
   Such a resolution, the official said, might be brought to a vote
next week, despite the focus on violence in Jerusalem.
   The diplomats spoke on the condition of not being identified.
   Bein noted that an independent investigation in Israel is under
way in the Temple Mount shootings on Oct. 8. Police intervened with
tear gas, rubber bullets and then live gunfire when thousands of
Palestinians hurled stones down on Jews praying at the Western
Wall, or Wailing Wall.
   ``Everybody who comes to Ben Gurion Airport can arrive,'' Bein
said. ``There are no limitations in Israel. But they (U.N.
officials) don't want to come as tourists. If they want to come,
they want to come as a delegation and on that I gave the reaction
of the government of Israel.''
   The Security Council condemned the violence on Friday and
requested a U.N. investigation into the deaths.
   Israel rejected the council action and the call for an outside
investigation as a violation of Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem
and in the territories occupied in the 1967 Mideast War.
   Israel wants to head off any investigation at the outset,
Israeli sources said, because it does not want to give the U.N.
Security Council any diplomatic toehold or any reason to take
further action with regard to Palestinians in Israel and its
occupied territories.
   Bein indicated the U.N. request to visit may be reconsidered
after Israel's commission delivers its report.

<TEXT>
   Flags at Lincoln Center were at half-staff
Monday, and the New York Philharmonic said it will play the music
of Leonard Bernstein rather than Beethoven in memory of the
American musical titan.
   Bernstein, whose passion at the podium, versatility as a
composer and performances on television helped make him the
nation's leading classical musician, died Sunday at his New York
City apartment.
   He died of sudden cardiac arrest caused by progressive lung
deterioration from a tumor and emphysema, four days after he
retired on doctor's orders. His son, Alexander, was at his side.
   A private burial was scheduled for Tuesday at the Greenwood
Cemetery in Brooklyn, where his late wife, actress Felicia
Montealegre, is buried.
   Bernstein wrote the scores for such classics as ``On The Town''
and ``West Side Story.'' He also lured countless thousands of
baby-boomers into the world of classical music with his Emmy
Award-winning ``Young People's Concerts.''
   ``He was the most unique musician of this century, there is no
doubt about it,'' said Zubin Mehta, music director of the New York
Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra.
   Bernstein conducted his first New York Philharmonic concert in
1943 at age 25 when he was called on to fill in for Bruno Walter in
a nationally broadcast radio concert.
   ``I walked on with an awful hangover and don't remember another
thing until I heard a thunderous ovation,'' Bernstein once
recalled.
   A memorial concert is planned for Carnegie Hall on Nov. 14, the
47th anniversary of Bernstein's Philharmonic debut.
   In 1958, Bernstein became the Philharmonic's first American-born
director and served in that capacity until 1969, when he stepped
down to devote more time to composing. He served as laureate
conductor until his death.
   ``He was the New York Philharmonic in its spirit and very
essence and we're going to miss him like crazy,'' Philharmonic
Director Nick Webster said.
   Beginning Thursday night and continuing through Oct. 23, the
Philharmonic will perform an all-Bernstein program, orchestra
spokesman Neil Parker said. The schedule had called for works by
Beethoven and Shostakovich.
   Parker said a larger musical memorial is being planned and many
celebrities have called asking to participate. ``We'll have more
about that in a day or so,'' he added.
   Bernstein, a heavy smoker, announced his retirement from the
concert stage Thursday, citing emphysema and other lung ailments.
His last conducting performance was Aug. 19 at Tanglewood Music
Center in Massachusetts.
   Despite his increasing ill health, he said then he planned to
conduct an Oct. 28 AIDS benefit concert for the Gay Men's Health
Crisis at Carnegie Hall. Sponsors said they will perform a musical
tribute to Bernstein that night.
   As a conductor, Bernstein was known for his concert contortions:
jabbing, leaping and even an occasional fall into the musicians
pit.
   Bernstein believed conductors should be actors.
   ``I don't mean that when the music is tragic you've got to act
like Barrymore in `Hamlet,' '' he once said. ``But you have to
indicate to the orchestra by your body and your face, which is all
you've got, what the shape of the phrase is.''
   A man of strong passions, Bernstein's fiery professional style
melded with his equally strong political beliefs.
   He once led an orchestra performance at a liberated
concentration camp, raised money for the Black Panthers, and
celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall with a performance of
Beethoven's ``Ninth Symphony'' in Berlin.
   ``With him goes a spectacular, special era in American music
making,'' violinist Isaac Stern said.
   Seiji Ozawa, the Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor who in his
20s was an assistant to Bernstein in New York, wiped tears from his
eyes as he reflected on his mentor.
   ``I had no money,'' Ozawa recalled. ``He gave me many food and
drink. His wife, Felicia, gave my wife a dress. I think she still
has it.''
   ``He was too much for one body,'' Ozawa said. ``He lived 10 or
20 times more than the usual person's one life.''
   Colleagues who worked with Bernstein said his greatest gift was
the ability to bring out the best in a performer.
   Gerard Schwarz, music director of the Seattle Symphony, said
Bernstein made ``every single player in an orchestra feel a part of
something terribly important.''
   Larry Kert, who played the original Tony in the Broadway
production of ``West Side Story,'' said that during the eight weeks
of rehearsals, ``Leonard Bernstein played for me every day.
   ``He could have gotten a rehearsal pianist but he cared too
much. I was the new kid on the block and he stroked me and took
care of me - and I will never forget him for that.''
   ``The loss is too great to consider,'' said Jerome Robbins, who

   More and more poll respondents believe the
country is going down the tubes and President Bush's approval
rating, though high, has hit a new low, according to a poll
released Monday.
   Only 19 percent of people surveyed from Wednesday through Sunday
said ``things in this country'' were ``generally going in the right
direction,'' according to The Washington Post-ABC News poll.
   That was the lowest such response since the poll began asking
the question in 1982. Seventy-nine percent of respondents said they
believed ``things have gotten pretty seriously off on the wrong
track.''
   Most people still approve of the way Bush is handling his job -
56 percent. But only a week before, 65 percent approved, In early
September, three-quarters of respondents approved.
   Similarly, the proportion approving the way Bush is dealing with
then economy fell from 53 percent in September in 38.
   Bush still got high ratings for his handling of the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait - 64 percent, down from 78 percent in September.
   Respondents were asked if they approved or disapproved of the
way the president, Democrats in Congress and Republicans in
Congress were handling the deficit. Nobody won high marks.
   Compared with the previous week, the president's ``approve''
response fell to 33 percent from 38 percent, the Democrats' fell to
30 percent from 32 percent, within the likely margin of error, and
the Republicans' fell to 23 percent from 33 percent.
   The poll interviewed 1,006 people selected at random. In such a
poll, the likely margin of error is 3 percentage points either way.

<HEAD>Both Sides Claim Success in Greek Municipal Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A government-backed candidate for mayor
narrowly won over former actress Melina Mercouri in Athens, but
leftist candidates emerged victorious on Monday in three of
Greece's five largest cities.
   Sunday's nationwide municipal elections were widely viewed as a
referendum on the economic austerity policies of the conservative
New Democracy Party of Prime Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, who
took office in April.
   Mitsotakis and opposition leaders, including socialist former
Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou, both claimed success in the
voting for mayors and council members.
   In the capital, Antonis Tritsis, a former socialist minister
supported by New Democracy, got 50.15 percent of the vote to defeat
former Minister of Culture Mercouri, a member of Parliament from
Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement, or PASOK, and star of
the film ``Never on Sunday.''
   It was the first time in 15 years a candidate for mayor in
Athens was elected in the first round, where an absolute majority
is needed for victory.
   Tritsis, twice a Fulbright Scholar at the Illinois Institute of
Technology in Chicago, takes office in January, He succeeds Nikos
Yatrakos, a New Democracy member.
   Leftist candidates, backed jointly by PASOK and the
Communist-led Coalition of the Left and Progress, won races in
Piraeus, the country's major port city; Patras, and Iraklion on the
island of Crete.
   Incomplete results from the Interior Ministry indicated 219
mayors were elected and that runoff elections will be held Sunday
in 146 races, including mayoral campaigns in Salonica, Greece's
second-largest city.
   No official results were available late Monday from the hundreds
of communities throughout the country.
   In Patras, about 100 miles west of Athens, police used tear gas
to disperse rioters early Monday following victory celebrations by
supporters of incumbent socialist mayor Andreas Karavolas.
   The Athens News Agency reported that 33 police and rioters were
injured and six people were arrested.
   In Salonica, about 200 miles north of Athens, conservative
Constantinos Cosmopoulos won 48.2 percent of the vote, short of an
absolute majority. Dimitris Fatouros, joint candidate of the
socialists and the coalition, received 47 percent.
   Papandreou claimed the results showed conservatives lost 5
percent to 10 percent of their strength nationwide. He did not
elaborate on how he determined this.
   Mitsotakis said the results indicated conservatives increased
their presence by at least 20 percent over the 1986 municipal
elections, and showed public acceptance of government efforts to
revive the flagging economy.
   Mitsotakis is struggling to control inflation running at 25
percent and reduce a $10 billion public debt. He seeks to sell some
state-controlled industries and streamline the bankrupt social
security system.
   Marches and strikes have been staged to protest the programs.

<HEAD>Former Civilian Leader Returns to Haiti to Run for President</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - More than two years after being
deposed in a military coup, former President Leslie Manigat
returned to Haiti late Monday to campaign for re-election.
   Manigat, accompanied by his wife, former Sen. Myrlande Hypollite
Manigat, arrived in Port-au-Prince on a commercial flight from New
York, said a spokesman for Manigat's National Progressive
Democratic Rally party.
   About 300 people welcomed Manigat during a heavy rain about 8
p.m. EDT.
   The interim civilian government of President Ertha
Pascal-Trouillot previously barred Manigat from returning, fearing
he wanted to claim the presidency.
   But the government, under pressure from human rights and
political groups, lifted the ban last week, saying it decided
Manigat ``only wishes to return as a citizen in order to run'' in
the Dec. 16 elections.
   Manigat, 60, was elected president in January 1988, but served
only six months before being ousted by a military coup. He was the
army's choice in the election, which was widely regarded as rigged,
and was overthrown and deported after tying to assert his
authority over the military.
   Since his ouster, Manigat has worked as a researcher in
international relations in Washington, D.C., Geneva and Paris. He
has repeatedly stated his intention to return to Haiti and run
again for president.
   Manigat is one of about 20 declared presidential candidates,
including the former director of the feared paramilitary police
known as the Tonton Macoutes.
   Friday is the deadline for filing for a spot on the ballot.
   The president-elect is to be inaugurated on Feb. 7, 1991, the
fifth anniversary of the fall of dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier.
   The election will be monitored by observers from the United
Nations, the Organization of American States and the Caribbean
Economic Community.
   Attempts to hold free elections collapsed Nov. 29, 1987, when
assassins supported by the army shot and hacked to death at least
34 voters at polling stations. Hundreds of others died in
pre-election violence.

<HEAD>`Machinal,' Revival of a 1928 Broadway Success, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1928-29 Broadway season produced such hits
as ``Street Scene'' by Elmer Rice, ``Holiday'' by Philip Barry,
``The Front Page'' by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur and
``Machinal'' by Sophie Treadwell.
   ``Machinal''? Sophie Treadwell?
   Leave it to Joseph Papp and his enterprising new team at the
Public Theater to unearth a dramatic rarity as its first offering
of the fall season. And while not a long-lost masterpiece,
``Machinal,'' especially under Michael Greif's taut and tantalizing
direction, certainly deserves a major revival after more than 60
years.
   Treadwell, who died in 1970, was a prominent journalist,
novelist and playwright during and after World War I. ``Machinal''
is her best known play, and it has had occasional small-scale
revivals in New York over the years. But the version which opened
Monday at the New York Shakespeare Festival's LuEsther Hall is the
first major reworking of the play.
   Greif has given it a fascinating production. From the
cacophonous opening scene of a busy Manhattan office to the grim
final moments on death row, the evening is a series of
expressionistic tableaux. They are done in great style and with a
firm sense for the period in which the story is set. The 1920s are
evoked by a bit of a popular song, the flip of a short skirt or
just the way the actors move across the floor.
   ``Machinal'' is an early feminist tract, loosely adapted from
the sensational 1927 murder case of Ruth Snyder, sentenced to die
in the electric chair for the murder of her husband.
   It's the story of a woman as victim, battered by her mother,
husband and society into a submission that eventually leads to her
downfall and death.
   Treadwell's heroine, a stenographer named Helen Jones, marries
her boss, a porcine capitalist who spouts homilies about big
business and marriage. Their marriage not only traps Helen but
nearly suffocates her.
   A child doesn't help. In fact, the baby only makes her feel
worse.
   Helen finds romance in a speakeasy where she meets a young man -
who was played in the original 1928 production by Clark Gable.
Their love affair is doomed when she kills her husband, a crime not
depicted on stage.
   The theater, LuEsther Hall, with its high ceilings and bank of
lighting fixtures, enchances the design of the production created
by David Gallo. Actors quickly carry furniture off and on the
stage.
   Light and dark are important components of that design, and the
lighting - and even the lack of it - by Kenneth Posner is
startlingly effective.
   The large cast is headed by Jodie Markell as the doomed Helen.
She's sweet but also a little scary, a demented woman who touches
your heart, too. There are fine portraits by John Seitz as her
wealthy husband, Marge Redmond as her nagging mother and William
Fichtner as the man she loves.
   ``Machinal'' is more than a theatrical curiosity. It's an
interesting work by a forgotten playwright that helps us understand
the past. And it's exactly the type of play the Public Theater
should be re-examining.

<TEXT>
   The co-owner of a radio station, known for
his leftist views, was ambushed by gunmen in three cars and shot to
death in the capital Monday, authorities said.
   The Fire Department said in a statement that Humberto Gonzalez
Gamarra, 49, co-owner of Radio Nuevo Mundo, was found severely
wounded in his car in the southwestern section of the city but died
a few minutes later at the hospital.
   Police said they had no clues who assassinated Gonzalez, or why.
   Witnesses said assailants in three vehicles chased Gonzalez's
car for several blocks, one of them blocked its path at the
entrance of a shopping mall, and the other two pulled up alongside,
according to the news release.
   The men then opened fire and fled, the news release said.
   Gonzalez was one of several politicians organizing the United
Revolutionary Party, a leftist organization.
   His brother, Julio Gonzalez Gamarra of the Revolutionary Party,
a center-left group, is a candidate for deputy in the national
legislature for Quetzaltenango province in general elections Nov.
11.
   Their father, Humberto Gonzalez Juarez, served in the 1951-54
leftist government of Col. Jacobo Arbenz and was kidnapped and
assassinated several years ago.
   Arbenz was overthrown by a military coup, and a series of
rightist, mostly military governments followed in Guatemala until
the 1985 election of Vinicio Cerezo, a civilian Christian Democrat.
   The overthrow of Arbenz sparked a leftist guerrilla war that
simmers on. Human rights organization estimate 30,000 people have
been killed in more than three decades, most ofthem suspected
leftists assassinated by rightist death squads believed to be
linked to the military.

<HEAD>U.N. Envoy Meets With Head of Iran's Judiciary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. envoy Reynaldo Galindo Pohl met
Monday in Tehran with the head of Iran's judiciary, and praised the
Iranian judicial system that is based on draconian Islamic laws.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Galindo Pohl as
telling Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi that on his visit to the capital's
Evin prison he had heard prisoners confess to spying against the
Islamic Republic.
   The broadcast said the rights envoy praised Iran's criminal
laws, under which a sentence passed by a lower court can be revoked
by the Supreme Court.
   ``I think this is very good, appropriate and just,'' the radio
quoted him as saying.
   Yazdi told Galindo Pohl that ``under no judicial system, except
that based on Islam, were human rights protected.''
   Yazdi added that ``the best example of this is the totally free
lives led by the minorities alongside the other people of our
country.''
   Galindo Pohl met with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Aakbar
Velayati earlier Monday, the radio said.
   Velayati said he hoped such missions would be underaken with ``a
spirit of impartiality,'' the radio reported.
   It is Galindo Pohl's second visit to Iran this year.
   The Salvadoran jurist visited Iran in January under a U.N.
mandate.
   His report, released in February, was widely criticized for
being too soft on Iran. International organization had accused Iran
of gross rights violations.
   The London-based Amnesty International has blamed Iran of
torturing prisoners and hanging government opponents on alleged
drug-related charges.
   According to statistics released by Iran's state-run media, more
than 1,500 alleged drug smugglers have been executed since December
1988, and tens of thousands of ``drug addicts'' thrown in prison.
   On his previous visit, Galindo Pohl reported he found no
evidence that the drug-related charges were a coverup for hanging
or imprisoning government opponents.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Monday accused
the world of hypocrisy, ignoring murders of Israelis while
condemning Israel for killing 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem last
week.
   He also warned Iraq in a speech to Parliament that any
intervention in neighboring Jordan that upset Jordanian stability
would bring swift Israeli retaliation.
   Shamir defended his Cabinet's rejection Sunday of a U.N.
Security Council resolution urging a U.N. investigation of the Oct.
8 deaths on the Temple Mount.
   Israel defied the United States on a second issue, announcing a
new housing plan for Soviet immigrants that ignores American pleas
not to settle the wave of newly arrived Soviets in occupied
territory.
   Six of eight new residential communities announced Sunday are to
be in east Jerusalem on territory captured by Israel from Jordan in
the 1967 Middle East war and annexed.
   America and most other nations do not recognize Israel's
annexation. The Bush administration this year approved $400 million
in loan guarantees for housing the Soviets on condition it not be
used beyond the 1967 line.
   Sunday's decision was designed to reinforce Israel's claims to
the city.
   ``The heart of the Jewish people needs to expand faster,'' said
Housing Minister Ariel Sharon. ``There is no better answer to the
political dangers than strengthening the Jewish population.''
   Left-wing parties on Monday attacked the Cabinet action
regarding a U.N. mission. The largest opposition faction, the
center-left Labor Party, said it would join a no-confidence vote
against Shamir's conservative government.
   Shamir, reacting to the Security Council condemnation, said
critics ignored that police charged the Mount only after
Palestinians unleashed a barrage of stones at Jewish worshipers at
the adjacent Western Wall.
   ``The citizens of Israel and all Jews everywhere cannot but be
astonished and protest at the voices of criticism ... in which what
stood out was an absence of any mention of the grave attack on the
Jewish people's holiest place,'' he said.
   Shamir complained that the Security Council failed to respond in
any way to the murders of 16 Israeli tourists in two attacks in
Egypt, one in 1985 by a deranged Egyptian policeman and another
last February by unidentified gunmen.
   ``We did not hear similar denunciations and we did not see the
Security Council being convened when whole families were murdered
in Ras Bourka or when buses carrying Israel tourists were
attacked,'' he said.
   Shamir did not follow other Israeli politicians in directly
criticizing the United States, Israel's chief ally, for joining in
the unanimous Security Council vote.
   But he suggested backing for the resolution was motivated by the
need to hold together the U.S.-backed force against Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein's takeover of Kuwait.
   ``The Security Council decision ... was a one-sided decision,''
he said. ``One can only conjecture about its motives and the
support it received in the present international situation.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
expressed disappointment in Israel's decision not to cooperate with
the U.N. investigators.
   ``We think that a failure to cooperate denies Israel an
opportunity to present its case,'' she said.
   At the United Nations, Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar
said Monday he was undecided whether to dispatch a team and would
wait to hear Israel's position.
   In his speech, Shamir also condemned the international community
for urging Israel to accept increased U.S. arms sales to Arab
states while Saddam has repeatedly threatened an attack on the
Jewish state.
   The 74-year-old leader of the right-wing Likud bloc appeared to
step up Israeli warnings to Iraq.
   While previous Israeli statments have pledged retaliation for an
invasion of Jordan, Shamir said Israel ``will not hesitate to react
in any way we see fit'' if there is an attempt to undermind
Jordan's stability.
   ``Any intervention in the situation there or intervention in its
territory by another state is likely to raise tensions ... to
levels we cannot accept,'' he said.
   In a response to Shamir's speech, Labor Party leader Shimon
Peres told Parliament that the right-wing government was ruining
Israel's standing in the world and upsetting its alliance with the
United States.
   He told a news conference later that Labor would join in a
no-confidence vote expected next week, and said the Cabinet's
reaction to the U.N. investigation kept international attention on
Israel and away from the gulf crisis.
   ``We with our own hands, instead of extinguishing the fire, we
are increasing the flames,'' Peres said.
   Shamir's defense of the Cabinet decision also followed questions
by Israeli human rights activists as to the government's account of
the Temple Mount slayings. They indicated the government had
overstated the dangers to police and civilians from rioting
Palestinians.
   In storming the Temple Mount - a site holy to both Moslems and
Jews - police wounded more than 140 Arabs in addition to killing
19. A half-dozen police and 28 Israelis were injured in the stoning
beforehand.
   On Sunday, the Israeli human rights group Betselem accused the
police of firing indiscriminately and noted the ``light character''
of injuries to both police and civilians.

   Republican candidate Jon Grunseth vowed
Monday to stay in the governor's race and prove that he is innocent
of allegations that he encouraged four teen-age girls to join him
for a nude swim at a 1981 party.
   Two women alleged in sworn statements that they attended an
Independence Day party at Grunseth's home when they were 13 and 14
years old.
   They said Grunseth encouraged them, his daughter, Nina, and
another girl to join him for a nude swim, and one of them alleged
that he tried to touch her breast. One of the women said Grunseth
swam naked but that both girls wore bathing suits.
   Grunseth maintained that his campaign opponent, Democratic Gov.
Rudy Perpich, ``was the driving force'' behind the allegations,
which he said are ``absolutely false.''
   ``Before this is over, there will be many witnesses who will say
that this charge is impossible,'' Grunseth told a news conference.
``It will take us a while to find them, but we will find them in
the near future.''
   ``We can't bring action, get this into court, prior to the
election,'' he said. ``That's what's so sad about this.''
   Perpich said he knew nothing of the allegations before a
reporter called him over the weekend. ``I had no contact with these
people,'' he said. ``It's bizarre to say we in any way had anything
to do with this, period.''
   The women making the allegations said they decided to come
forward with the story because of the governor's race. They made
the sworn statements with the help of a lawyer and provided them to
the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, which reported them Monday. They
later provided the statements to other journalists.
   Nina Grunseth, now 23, said the allegation against her father
``is totally untrue. I know my father, and I do not believe under
any circumstances he committed the act of which he is accused or
any similar act.''
   She said one of the women making the allegations told her in a
telephone conversation Sept. 29 that if her father would drop out
of the governor's race, ``no other allegations would be made
against him and both of our names would be kept out of the
newspaper.''
   Grunseth aides planned to ask the U.S. attorney's office to
determine whether either extortion or blackmail is involved, said
spokesman Elam Baer.
   The allegations were made by Liane Nelson, now 23 and a social
worker dealing with sexual abuse cases in the Boston area, and her
cousin Elizabeth Mulay, 22, of San Jose, Calif.
   Nelson said she decided to speak out nine years later because
she believes there was sexual impropriety at the party. ``I think
that is extremely inappropriate behavior for someone who wants to
be governor,'' she told the Star Tribune.
   She didn't respond to a reporter's message lft on her telephone
answering machine Monday. Mulay's telephone number is unlisted.
   Grunseth has noted that Nelson's parents have been active in
Democratic politics in Minneapolis in the past.
   In her statement, Mulay said Grunseth ``suggested we all take
our swimsuits off.''
   ``My cousin and I were adamant about not taking them off,'' she
said. ``... At one point, he (Grunseth) cornered me in the pool. I
tried to swim by, but he blocked me in.''
   Mulay alleged that Grunseth tried to pull her bathing-suit strap
down and to grab her breast but he missed.
   The Perpich campaign has in recent weeks focused on Grunseth's
temporary refusal to pay some court-ordered child-support and
health insurance payments after his 1983 divorce, and for being
delinquent in paying some of his property taxes.

   The highest-ranking South Korean
official to cross the armed border into North Korea said Tuesday
that mutual diplomatic recognition between the nations is necessary
to ease tensions on the divided peninsula.
   ``We will emphasize to the northern side that basic recognition
is the first step toward improving inter-Korean relations,'' said
Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon.
   Kang is scheduled to meet with his North Korean counterpart Yon
Hyong Muk in the second round of discussions between the rival
nations since the peninsula was divided in 1945. The two prime
ministers met in the South Korean capital of Seoul in September.
   South Korea has recognized Communist North Korea as a separate
nation, but the North has refused to do the same its southern
neighbor, claiming it would perpetuate division.
   South Korea has said there can be no significant progress in
ending hostilities until both governments officially accept each
others' existence.
   ``The Military Demarcation Line ... is a barrier of distrust and
confrontation that has blocked travel and any meeting between our
people ... and has brought bitter anguish and distrust,'' Kang said
before crossing the border at the village of Panmunjom in the
Demilitarized Zone between the nations.
   Kang and the 90-member delegation were greeted by young North
Korean girls dressed in brightly colored traditional gowns and
carrying flowers.
   The group left the border area for the nearby town of Kaesong,
where they were to take a special train to the North Korean capital
of Pyongyang, about 90 miles north of the border.
   On Sunday, a 17-member South Korean musical delegation crossed
the border for a 10-day trip scheduled to include joint concerts
with North Korean musicians.
   The delegation, made up of 14 musicians and musical writers and
three reporters, were met by about 500 North Korean officials and
villagers in Panmunjom.
   ``Your visit has marked a breakthrough in self-reliant cultural
exchanges between the North and the South, and it is an epochal
event in the history of divided peninsula,'' said Kim Won-kun,
chairman of North Korean League of Musicians.

from jury selection in the bribery trial of a legislator snared in
an FBI investigation into vote-buying in the South Carolina
Statehouse.
   The unexpected media ban by U.S. District Judge Falcon Hawkins
kept a veil of secrecy over legal proceedings for state Rep. Luther
Taylor. Taylor's attorneys have argued that further disclosures
about the case would make it impossible to seat an impartial jury.
   Taylor, 40, a Democrat from Columbia, is one of nine state
lawmakers indicted by a federal grand jury in August and September
on charges of taking bribes in exchange for their support of a bill
legalizing betting on horses and greyhounds.
   They were charged under the Hobbs Act, a federal law banning
acceptance of money or gifts in return for votes or favors. Four
lawmakers have already pleaded guilty to bribery. A fifth has
pleaded guilty to a drug charge that came up in the course of the
investigation.
   By Monday night, seven jurors had been seated. The jury will be
composed of 12 jurors and three alternates.
   After Hawkins barred the media from jury selection Monday,
attorneys for South Carolina news organizations lodged an emergency
appeal before the 4th U.S. Circuit of Appeals in Richmond, Va.
   Hawkins also has issued a gag order barring participants from
discussing the case outside court. Aother order sealing court
records in the cases of Taylor and three other lawmakers charged
separately is under appeal.
   ``There has to be a balancing process so that any restriction on
our right of access is as narrow as can be and still protecting the
Sixth Amendment right'' of a fair trial, said Jay Bender of the
South Carolina Press Association.
   ``We think the First Amendment is first,'' Bender said. The
First Amendment guarantees the right to free speech.
   The judge said he feared potential jurors might be more
circumspect in answering questions from attorneys if reporters were
present.
   ``If they know what they're saying is to be public, I am of the
opinion they will not be near as candid,'' Hawkins said.
   Taylor's attorney, Joel Collins, did not file a motion to bar
the media from jury selection but argued the presence of reporters
would jeopardize Taylor's right to a fair trial.
   Bender, citing the lack of compelling government interest in
sealing the proceedings, offered alternatives such as identifying
jurors by numbers.
   Taylor has pleaded innocent to charges he took $4,300 in bribes
this year in exchange for supporting a pari-mutuel betting bill. He
is also charged with conspiring to obtain bribes.
   He has served in the state House of Representatives since 1983.
   If convicted, Taylor faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in
prison and a fine of $1.5 million.
   The 16-month FBI sting employed a former House
member-turned-lobbyist, Ron Cobb, who pretended to represent an
Atlanta organization that supported efforts to legalize parimutuel
betting on horses and greyhounds in South Carolina. The indictment
alleged Taylor met with Cobb and agreed to accept money for
supporting the pari-mutuel bill. It also alleged he agreed to
recruit other lawmakers to support the bill.

   World leaders said Monday in congratulating
Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the Soviet leader's courage, boldness and
role in ending the Cold War make him the rightful winner of the
1990 Nobel Peace Prize.
   Gorbachev ``has been a courageous force for peaceful change in
the world,'' President Bush said, joining in a tide of warm praise
from leaders ranging from German Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the 1983
winner, Poland's Lech Walesa.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher termed the award
``terrific'' and ``richly deserved,'' and others said it may help
President Gorbachev's efforts to boost the sagging Soviet economy.
   ``I am of the opinion that if ever an award was justified, this
was it,'' German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said in an
interview with the Cologne-based Deutschlandfunk radio station.
   In awarding the prize, the Norwegian Nobel Committee cited
Gorbachev for his decisive role in the East's and West's drawing
closer together, and allowing greater openness in his homeland.
   Echoing the committee, Bush said Gorbachev ``has brought
historically signficant change, both political and economic, to the
Soviet Union and to Eastern Europe.''
   Former President Jimmy Carter, speaking at Moravian College in
Bethlehem, Pa., said Gorbachev ``would have been my choice.
   ``His selection is long overdue. In my opinion, in this
hemisphere, no one else alive or who has lived in this century has
so beneficially changed the world political society as has Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   ``He got the Vietnamese out of Kampuchea (Cambodia). He got his
Soviet troops out of Afghanistan. He brought freedom in a great
degree to the people of the Soviet Union. He's made possible the
liberation of Eastern European countries. He's been a strong
enforceable leader even when the United States opposed bringing
about nuclear arms reductions, so in many ways, he's superlative.''
   Polish trade union leader Walesa said he wished Gorbachev
``further persistence and successes on the road to democracy that
you have outlined.''
   It was the first peace prize awarded to a Soviet or U.S. chief
executive since President Woodrow Wilson won in 1919.
   Israeli President Chaim Herzog said he believed Gorbachev's
policies ``will bring freedom and happiness to many peoples and
advance peace throughout the world and particularly in the Middle
East.''
   Herzog said Gorbachev's role in opening the way for more Jews to
emigrate to Israel, ``will be remembered for many generations and
the entire Jewish people is full of gratitude.''
   From Los Angeles, former President Reagan congratulated his
``friend,'' calling the prize a ``well-deserved tribute to his bold
and courageous leadership.
   ``Under President Gorbachev, the Soviet Union is making
fundamental and necessary changes in its political and economic
systems - changes which will give the Soviet people the freedoms
they deserve,'' he said.
   Germany's Kohl said in a telegram to Gorbachev: ``Your personal
contribution to the improvement of relations between East and West,
to overcoming the division of our continent, to breakthroughs in
disarmament and arms controls and solutions of regional conflicts
is worthy of highly deserved praise.''
   In Spain, Foreign Minister Fernandez Ordonez called the award an
``act of justice.''
   Italy's Premier Giulio Andreotti said the announcement ``filled
me with joy.''
   United Nations Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar told
reporters Gorbachev had not only contributed ``in a remarkable
manner'' to detente, but to enhancing the role of the U.N. ``as a
peacemaking and peacekeeping center.''
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said the prize may
boost Gorbachev's standing in efforts for domestic economic reform.
   ``It won't help him out of his economic predicament,'' London
School of Economics Soviet expert Margot Light said. ``But it may
make his political position slightly more stable.''
   Citing the 59-year-old Gorbachev's contribution to the cause of
freedom, Portuguese President Mario Soares said, ``(It is) a choice
that I applaud with both hands, enthusiastically and without
reserve.''
   President Patricio Aylwin of Chile called Gorbachev ``a man who
has had the enormous courage of pushing democratic and liberalizing
reforms. . . . His efforts have definitely contributed to
strengthening peace around the world.''
   Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said in a message of
congratulations, ``Your leadership and historical vision have
decisively contributed to strengthening peace and detente in the
world.''
   Bulgaria's president, Zhelyu Zhelev, told Gorbachev he deserved
the reward for his ``extraordinary contribution to the dismantling
of the totalitarian system'' and for ``the creation of a new
political climate in europe and the world in which peace and
cooperation among all peoples are the most cherished values.''
   Not all reaction was positive.
   Latvian historian Jan Saltsmanis, whose homeland is among the
Baltic republics fighting for independence from the Soviet Union,
said the West was too impressed with Gorbachev.
   ``I reacted with dismay,'' he told the radio in Sweden, where he
has lived since 1945. ``Gorbachev has opened up borders, he
deserves a certain merit for the development. But you ... should
not overestimate his significance in the context.''

<HEAD>Police to Remain on Mohawk Area After Army Withdrawal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Army troops called to a Mohawk reservation
during a violent two-month land dispute plan to withdrawal, but
police units will continue to patrol the area, officials said
Monday.
   Public Security Minister Claude Ryan said Quebec provincial
police and Royal Canadian Mounted Police will oversee highways
leading to the Mercier Bridge, a main route to Montreal blocked in
July by Mohawks protesting a proposed golf course and condominium
project on land claimed by the Indians.
   Ryan said the police will remain until a ``professional,
competent'' Mohawk police force is formed.
   The 13-member Mohawk Peacekeepers, directed by a Mohawk council,
did not attempt to confront armed Mohawks who barricaded the bridge
July 11. A provincial policeman died attempting to topple the
blockade.
   Mohawk council members reacted angrily at the news police will
patrol the reserve.
   ``I don't like it,'' said member Alvin Delisle. ``We have a
police force which is capable of patrolling the reserve ... it's
our jurisdiction.''
   About 500 troops are scheduled to leave the area Tuesday, army
spokesman Capt. Carol Lefrancois said. The army was deployed in
mid-August, and the barricades on the bridge and elsewhere were
removed later that month.
   The troops will remain on alert until the end of the month, Ryan
said.
   A platoon of 50 military police moved into the reservation
Monday to help the provincial police and RCMP take over. Ryan said
they would stay at least until the end of the month.
   He said the provincial police will prepare a plan by
mid-November to establish a new police force, mostly composed of
natives.

<HEAD>Radioactive Dogs, Tons of Excrement Being Buried At Hanford</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of dead dogs, the remains of a
Cold War radiation experiment, were shipped to the Hanford nuclear
reservation for burial last month. Coming next: 17.5 tons of their
radioactive excrement.
   The 560-square-mile federal reservation in south-central
Washington already is a repository for millions of gallons of
radioactive waste left over from decades of nuclear weapons
production. It also has accepted defunct Navy nuclear subs and
retired reactors for burial.
   The 828 dead beagles, shipped from California in 55-gallon
drums, were buried in trenches at Hanford a few weeks ago. Their
remains had been stored in freezers at the Institute of Toxicology
and Environmental Health on the University of California campus at
Davis.
   The last dog died at the age of 18{ in 1986, 27 years after
government-funded beagle experiments began at the university.
   The beagle clean-up, expected to cost about $22 million, is part
of a nationwide Department of Energy effort to clean up radiation
contamination at university labs where government research was
conducted.
   The dogs left behind tons of urine and feces. Since the wastes
are radioactive, they also must be buried and shipped under
regulations governing low-level radioactive waste.
   The burial closes a chapter in a government effort to test the
effects of radioactive fallout.
   Several West Coast universities were paid to conduct animal
experiments in the late 1950s when public concern about fallout
from open-air nuclear weapons tests was mounting.
   At birth, the dogs either were put on a diet of bone-seeking
strontium-90, irradiated with cobalt-60 or injected with radium.
About a year and a half later, the treatment would stop and the
dogs would be sent to live in outdoor cages until they died.
   The experiments have shown that dogs fed high doses of radiation
get cancer more quickly than people. The dogs who received the
lowest doses didn't get cancer, said Dr. Otto Raabe, who has
directed beagle research at the University of California at Davis
for the last 15 years.
   In a similar case in Iowa, environmental groups have reacted
angrily to a plan to incinerate hundreds of slightly radioactive
carcasses of dogs that were injected with radioactive isotopes in
experiments to improve human health at the University of Iowa. The
university has run out of storage space.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Hearing in Camarena Murder Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Monday ordered a hearing on
whether jurors who convicted four men on charges stemming from the
1985 kidnap and murder of a U.S. drug agent were exposed to outside
information.
   ``I believe it is necessary to hold an evidentiary hearing to
determine the precise nature of the extraneous information that
reached the jury,'' U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie said. ``It
is unclear what the jury was exposed to.''
   Defense lawyers asked Rafeedie to order a new trial based on
statements by one juror that other members of the jury had heard or
seen news accounts of the case before returning their verdicts
against the four defendants.
   Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, Ruben Zuno Arce and Juan Jose
Bernabe Ramirez were convicted of various charges of conspiracy,
kidnap and violent crimes in aid of racketeering. The case stems
from the 1985 killing of Enrique Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent.
   Javier Vasquez Velasco was convicted of violent crimes in aid of
racketeering for the deaths of two Americans who were reportedly
mistaken for DEA agents in a Guadalajara restaurant the week before
Camarena disappeared.
   Prosecutors say Mexican drug traffickers killed Camarena in
retribution for successful drug interdiction efforts in the
Guadalajara area.
   So far, 22 people have been charged in this country in
connection with Camarena's slaying. More than 20 have been
convicted in Mexico.

<HEAD>Dow Jones Freezes Budgets for Spending, Salaries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dow Jones &amp; Co. is freezing budgets for capital
spending and salaries and imposing other news and business cutbacks
to cope with weak financial results and the sluggish economy.
   The cuts, announced in an internal memo to managers Oct. 11,
followed weeks of rumors about a possible retrenchment and
triggered concern over possible future layoffs at the media and
financial industry giant.
   Earlier in the week, Dow Jones announced a 17.5 percent drop in
third-quarter profit, reflecting a steady downturn attributed
principally to the company's acquisition of the financial
information service Telerate Inc.
   Dow Jones also has been hurt by the recession plaguing Wall
Street since the 1987 stock market crash.
   Operating income at Dow Jones' business publications, which
include The Wall Street Journal and Barron's weekly, dropped 80
percent in the second quarter. Advertising linage at the Journal
dropped 16 percent in the period.
   The internal memo from Chairman Warren H. Phillips and President
Peter R. Kann, freezes all capital expenditures immediately and
holds all 1991 department budgets - including total salary costs -
at 1990 levels. Accounting for inflation, the budget cut would
amount to more than 5 percent for 1991.
   The memo also said Dow Jones would reduce management bonuses
next year, eliminate all temporary help, try to eliminate all
editorial staff relocations and reduce space devoted to news in the
Journal.
   ``It's likely we, like many other companies in our industry,
will be facing adverse market conditions for most of our
publications and services, particularly in the U.S. in 1991,'' the
memo said.
   The memo said the cuts were ``the preferred method of trimming
our costs structure'' but Phillips and Kann said they could not
guarantee they would meet company goals. The memo did not rule out
layoffs.
   The memo said Dow Jones would sell its corporate jet and reduce
its aviation staff, and sell excess land purchased for Journal
printing plant expansion and printing presses in storage.
   Among other editorial reductions, the memo said Dow Jones would
reduce Journal special report inserts and table plans for a Journal
magazine among other moves to contain or reduce costs.

<HEAD>UPI Dismisses Unspecified Number of Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International said Oct. 12 that
it would dismiss an unspecified number of employees and concentrate
its reporting on 15 populous states.
   ``There will be some people who will get dismissal notices,''
said Milt Capps, senior vice president for corporate affairs.
   ``There will be some ups in some places and some downs in others
to maintain the staffing equilibrium,'' he said. ``We will have as
many people reporting as we have had, given that we are also
relying on stringer correspondents and subcontractors.''
   Capps declined to say how many people were being laid off.
   Capps said UPI would continue to have bureaus in ``virtually
every state'' and had no plans to announce any bureau closures
soon.
   The 83-year-old wire service announced in September that it was
closing bureaus in five states.
   Executive Vice President Pieter Vanbennekom said UPI planned to
intensify its reporting of business and finance, economics and
trade, government, crime and ``quality of life'' issues.
   He said wires known as MetroRegional wires would be established
serving California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Michigan, Florida, Ohio, Massachusetts, Indiana, New
Hampshire, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.
   UPI derives about 82 percent of its revenue from the 15 states,
Vanbennekom said.
   Similar wires may be established in other states in 1992,
depending on the success of the program, he said.

<HEAD>New Jersey Paper Plans Staff Cuts, But No Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Staff levels will be reduced at The
Record as part of a cost-reduction program, but no layoffs are
planned, Chairman Malcolm A. Borg said Oct. 11.
   Borg and Publisher Byron C. Campbell issued a statement saying
spending would be scrutinized, other operating costs would be cut
and staff would be reduced through hiring controls and attrition.
   They warned, however, that the decision against layoffs could be
reversed if sluggish economic conditions continued in the
Northeast.
   ``If economic conditions deteriorate further, this decision will
be revisited,'' the statement said.
   The statement was issued after published reports about rumors
that The Record might cut its staff by 10 percent.
   Classified advertising at The Record has dropped more than 25
percent, while overall revenue is down by about 12 percent,
spokesman Peter Hearne said.
   ``Ad revenue in the Northeast is off by large proportions and
has been for a couple of years. We are just in a position where we
must get our costs in line,'' Hearne said.
   The paper has a daily circulation of about 150,000.

<HEAD>New Hampshire Daily Cuts Staff, Drops Weekly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST LEBANON, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dail Valley News laid off nine
employees and discontinued its money-losing controlled-circulation
weekly Oct. 8, citing a decline in advertising revenue.
   The layoffs, the first since the paper was founded in 1952,
reduced the staff to 81 employees.
   Publisher Willmott Lewis Jr. told employees the paper had
reduced expenses three months ago in the hope layoffs would not be
necessary, but the decline in ad revenues had continued. He said
revenues had fallen since peaking in 1988.
   Circulation, which provides about 20 percent of the paper's
revenue, is 18,800.
   Discharged employees received severance pay of a minimum of
nearly three weeks' salary.

<HEAD>Knight-Ridder Reinvents a Community Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Knight-Ridder Inc. unveiled a redesigned
newspaper Oct. 11 that seeks a share of quality time in this baby
boomer-rich suburb.
   The News, a reconstituted 35-year-old daily, takes its visual
cues from USA Today with heavy use of color, maps and indexes,
eye-catching graphics and clean lines.
   In content, short, trendy stories will be the norm. Broadsheet
sections have been reserved for the top news, local developments,
business and sports. Feature articles are offered in a tabloid
magazine called Essentials.
   ``What we did was to take a very specific community and say, `If
we were reinventing the newspaper, if a newspaper didn't exist in
this place, and we were trying to create a newspaper that we
thought would have the greatest appeal to the people in this
community, what would it be?' '' said James Batten, Knight-Ridder
chairman and chief executive officer.
   While many newspapers have evolved along similar lines in recent
years, Knight-Ridder put in two years researching approaches aimed
at baby boomers. The result transformed The Boca Raton News into
The News.
   ``People were skeptical at first because they were afraid we
were trying to reinvent USA Today for the local area,'' said Lou
Heldman, the project's corporate coordinator. ``It is meant to have
all of the traditional journalistic components: to do investigative
reporting, to be a watchdog over government and institutions, to
run stories with an edge when that's called for and to not
homogenize the writing style.''
   Wayne Ezell, editor of the News, said: ``We don't spend much
time in the business asking ourselves what our readers are
interested in. We tend to engage people who read newspapers. We
need to talk to the people who don't read newspapers.''
   The newspaper, whose circulation is estimated at 40,000, has
been tailored specifically for Boca Raton, a community of 67,000
people between Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. Its image is
that of an upscale retirement haven, but 30 percent of the
population is in the baby boomer pool, half of whom have arrived in
the past five years.
   Loyal, older readers haven't been left out. A focus group study
of readers over age 45 showed that ``it's a bigger hit frankly with
the older readers than the younger readers,'' he said.
   Batten said he regards The News as a laboratory testing
potential applications for Knight-Ridder's other papers.

<HEAD>Baby Bells Get Boost in Electronic Info Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court boosted a bid by the
nation's seven regional telephone companies to provide electronic
information services to homes and businesses.
   The court, without comment Oct. 9, rejected an appeal aimed at
making it harder for the companies to enter the developing
industry.
   The underlying issue is whether the companies should be allowed
to use their phone lines to sell such information as stock market
quotes and ``electronic Yellow Pages'' with home-shopping and
classified advertising.
   Last April, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here threw out
part of a 1987 lower court ruling that barred the companies from
selling the information services.
   The appeals court said the ruling by U.S. District Judge Harold
Greene, who has overseen the breakup of the AT&amp;T phone monopoly for
more than a decade, was too strict. It sent the case back to him
with instructions to use a more lenient test - whether lifting the
ban would be in the public interest.
   Asking the Supreme Court for help was a coalition of consumer
groups, long-distance phone companies, equipment manufacturers,
data-processing businesses and newspapers that want to enter the
at-home information market.
   The coalition, including the American Newspaper Publishers
Association, said the appeals court ruling jeopardizes the vigorous
economic growth spawned by the breakup of AT&amp;T in 1984.
   The phone companies said that their opponents are trying to kill
legitimate competition and that most Americans will be slow in
getting information services unless the Baby Bells participate.

<HEAD>Persian Gulf, Gas Prices Most Closely Watched Stories</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis and the resulting
increase in gasoline prices were the most closely followed stories
during September, but Americans paid much less attention to the
federal budget crunch, a media group reported.
   The Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The Press said Oct. 10
that 68 percent of Americans surveyed said the Mideast crisis was
the most important news of September.
   Sixty-three percent said they were following very closely news
about the U.S. troop deployment to Saudi Arabia and other
developments in the wake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. That
was the same percentage as in August.
   Sixty-two percent said they paid close attention to stories
about rising gasoline prices, up from 56 percent in August.
   The percentage of the public who paid close attention to news
about hostages held in Iraq and Kuwait declined from 57 percent to
47 percent.
   Although the poll was taken Oct. 4-7, the period in which budget
negotiations broke down and a government shutdown was ordered, only
34 percent said they were closely following news about efforts to
resolve the budget impasse.
   However, 45 percent said they were aware gasoline tax increases
were being considered, 38 percent had heard cigarette taxes might
be raised and 40 percent knew alcohol tax increases were under
consideration.
   Among people under 30, only 20 percent said they were following
the budget news closely. The percentage increased with age and
reached 46 percent among people 50 and older.
   The results were based on telephone interviews of 1,213 adults.
The margin of error was plus or minus three percentage points.

<HEAD>Times Mirror Corrects Poll Figures on Republicans and Rich</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Times Mirror Center for The People &amp; The
Press said it wrongly reported that a national poll it took last
month found that 51 percent of the people surveyed associated
Republicans with ``rich, powerful moneyed interests.''
   The correct figure was 21 percent, the center said Oct. 12.
   In a previous poll three years ago, 18 percent made such an
association. The big jump to 51 percent was widely published and
frequently cited by political commentators.
   Times Mirror said that the incorrect figure was due to a
computing error.
   It said it also overstated the percentage of people who
spontaneously said they associated Republicanism with conservatism,
being business-oriented and not being for the people.
   Scott Sowry, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee,
said the party was certain that the apparent jump was an error.
   ``That's what we've been saying all along,'' Sowry said.

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Birmingham News became the nation's
first newspaper to reject advertising for the new NC-17 adults-only
film ``Henry &amp; June.''
   The afternoon paper rejected ads for the Universal Pictures
release and said it would refuse ad copy for all subsequent NC-17
films, citing its previous ban on X-rated movies.
   ``We feel like the NC-17 is not that far removed from X, based
on what we're familiar with,'' marketing director Tom Adams said.
   In Los Angeles, Universal spokesman Allan Sutton said the News
was the first and only newspaper to ban NC-17 ads.
   The movie, which includes two lesbian sex scenes and a shot of
an erotic drawing, is based on the diaries of Anais Nin and
chronicles her affairs with writer Henry Miller and his wife.
   It was the first released under the Motion Picture Association
of America's new rating, which excludes anyone under 18 and
replaces the X rating.
   Studios long considered the X designation box office poison
because of its association with hard-core sex and the inability to
place media ads.
   Jack Valenti, association president, condemned the News' blanket
prohibition on NC-17 films. ``If a newspaper wants to live in the
Stone Age, I can't do anything about it,'' he said.
   In an editorial Oct. 7, the News said ``smut was still smut''
and the NC-17 rating could lead to more violent or erotic fare,
``drawing audiences that might have been turned off by the stigma
of an X rating.''
   The newspaper also published its policy.
   ``The policy of the Birmingham News in reviewing and accepting
advertising for movies will not change as a result of the decision
to replace the old `X' designation with the new `NC-17'
designation.
   ``As a general rule, movies that receive the NC-17 rating or are
unrated will not be reviewed and advertisements for those movies
will not be accepted. Exceptions to that policy will be considered
on a case-by-case basis.''

<HEAD>NFL Players Group Asks for Separate Interview Areas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The NFL Players Association is asking the league
to set up an area outside locker rooms so players would not be
required to participate in media interviews unless fully clothed.
   The union issued a statement Oct. 8 from executive director Gene
Upshaw saying NFL players should be afforded absolute privacy in
their locker rooms.
   ``People deserve to be treated with respect and dignity whether
they are male or female, pro football players or members of the
media,'' Upshaw said. ``Women in sports media must have the same
access as their male counterparts to NFL players.''
   So, Upshaw said, keep all reporters out of the locker room and
``provide a separate area . . . where all players would be
available on an equal basis to all accredited media, male or
female.''
   Cincinnati Bengals coach Sam Wych was fined $30,000 for closing
his team's locker room to a female reporter. That incident followed
one in which Lisa Olson, a reporter for the Boston Herald, accused
New England Patriots players of sexually harassing her and
humiliating her in the locker room during practice.

<HEAD>Santa Fe Drops Effort To Ban Street Newspaper Sales</HEAD>

   City leaders agreed Oct. 10 to drop a move
to ban vendors from selling newspapers at intersections.
   City attorney Jim McKay said he had been satisifed The New
Mexican had adequate insurance to cover any traffic accident caused
by a vendor.
   McKay had recommended in July that the council change a 1987 law

accident.
   The Public Safety Committee voted 3-2 in August to recommend
changing the law and the City Council had scheduled a hearing for
Oct. 10.
   The newspaper's insurer, Daniels Insurance Co., assured McKay
the newspaper would pay damages if the city was found negligent due

   McKay said other newspapers' vendors would be allowed at
intersections if they could prove they were adequately insured.

<HEAD>Kid Reporters Get First Interview With Retired Justice</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIANAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of young reporters scored a
journalistic coup by interviewing retired U.S. Supreme Court
Justice William J. Brennan Jr.
   After suffering a stroke, Brennan retired in July under doctor's
orders to reduce his workload and decline all interviews until at
least next year.
   But five reporters and editors from the Indianapolis Children's
Express bureau spent 30 minutes in September interviewing the
84-year-old Brennan, who had been the strongest liberal voice on an
increasingly conservative court. Their interview was published in
The Indianapolis Star on Oct. 8.
   The team peppered Brennan with questions about children's
rights, abortion, drug testing, the death penalty for minors and
the mentally retarded, the Equal Rights Amendment and his
replacement on the court, David H. Souter.
   They said Brennan dodged most questions on the newest justice,
but indicated he wasn't pleased with him.
   ``It wasn't so much like we were scooping anybody. We were just
talking,'' said Wendy Potasnik, 17.
   ``It was more like a conversation than an interview,'' agreed
Lisa Schubert, 10. ``I mean, I'd ask him the same questions as if
I'd ran into him one day.''
   The interview was arranged with the help of Brennan's daughter,
Nancy, who is a friend of Peter Sterling, president of the
Children's Museum. The museum houses the Children's Express bureau,
which publishes a one-page, weekly report in the Star on issues of
interest to youngsters.
   Before interviewing Brennan, the young reporters carefully
researched his 34-year tenure on the bench. The team met twice a
week for six weeks reviewing newspaper and magazine articles on
Brennan and some of the more than 1,200 opinions he wrote.

<HEAD>Reporter, Editor Dismissed in Flap Over Personal Investments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The business editor and a reporter
for the St. Petersburg Times have been ousted in a
conflict-of-interest dispute that raises questions about what
personal financial activity is appropriate for journalists.
   The episode began late last month when reporter James Greiff
disclosed he had been short-selling stock of Wells Fargo &amp; Co., the
San Francisco-based bank.
   After consulting with top editors, business editor Leonard M.
Apcar dismissed Greiff on Oct. 3. Two days later, Apcar quit under
pressure after the superiors learned his individual retirement
account was invested in a mutual fund containing Banc One Corp. of
Columbus, Ohio.
   Business journalism ethics have received increased scrutiny
since the 1985 insider trading conviction of R. Foster Wi   In short-selling,
an investor sells borrowed stock on the
expectation the price of the issue will decline. The investor
profits if the price drops and the shares, usually borrowed from a
broker, can be replaced at a lower price.
   The risky strategy, forbidden to journalists by at least one
major business publication, amounts to a bet that a company's stock
price will drop.
   Theoretically, a reporter writing a negative article about a
company could ``short'' the stock of that company, expecting the
story to drive down the price. Greiff said he had not written about
Wells Fargo. He was accused only of bad judgment, not any
wrongdoing.
   Following Greiff's dismissal, Apcar said he told his immediate
supervisor that he had bank stock in an IRA, but he didn't name the
bank.
   Greiff, meanwhile, said he told Times executives that Apcar held
shares of Banc One, which had been mentioned in a story by Greiff
as a possible suitor for a Florida bank. Apcar had edited the story
and decided his mutual-fund holding presented no conflict.
   On Oct. 4, after rumors that Apcar owned stock in the bank
filtered through the newsroom, Apcar said he voluntarily told his
supervisor that Banc One was in the mutual fund. A day later, Foley
asked Apcar to resign.
   Mutual funds typically contain baskets of different stocks and
other securities. Their contents usually are decided by fund
managers, not investors. In an IRA, investors cannot withdraw money
without penalty until retirement.
   ``You're not in a mutual fund . . . for a short period of
time,'' said Apcar, who was hired by the Times in early 1989 after
more than 12 years as a reporter at The Wall Street Journal.
``You're in for the long haul unless you trade, and I don't
trade.''
   The Times' conflict-of-interest policy does not specifically bar
any investments but cautions reporters to avoid even the appearance
of a conflict and to raise questions with superiors.
   Greiff, a Times reporter for more than five years, said he did
not violate any policy, written or spoken. He said business writers
were told only not to invest in companies they cover or ones based
in Florida.
   ``Within 10 minutes after placing my order with my broker I told
several people in my department and told Len,'' he said. ``I said,
`Do you have any problem with it?' and he said no.'' Apcar said he
did not respond immediately to Greiff's comments.
   ``It went from being no problem to being a problem to being a
firing offense in a matter of a few days,'' Greiff said.
   Rules governing reporters' investments vary widely. Dow Jones &amp;
Co., which owns The Wall Street Journal, has what is considered to
be the strictest conflict-of-interest policy in the nation.
   Reporters and other staffers are barred from short-term trading
and must hold securities at least six months. They cannot trade
futures or options or sell short. Reporters and their families are
prohibited from investing in companies related to their coverage
areas.
   The Society of American Business Editors &amp; Writers' ethics code
urges avoiding even the appearance of conflict. It calls for
skirting ``active trading and other short-term profit-seeking
opportunities.''
   Some editors said newspapers may be at fault if they discipline
reporters without precise guidelines.
   ``If there is no specific policy that makes that clear I think
the newspaper has overreached,'' said Sandra Duerr, business editor
of The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Ky.

   A man pleaded guilty to trying to extort $30,000
from the late Malcolm Forbes by threatening to harm his reputation.
   George Kenneth Warnock, 25, of the Bronx, had been charged in
July with mailing two threatening letters to Forbes the previous

   He faces up to two years in prison and a $250,000 fine when
sentenced Dec. 14 by U.S. District Judge Lawrence M. McKenna.
   The indictment didn't describe the nature of Warnock's threats.
A lawyer for Forbes' family said Warnock had never met Forbes.

<HEAD>South Carolina Paper in Agreement With NAACP</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MYRTLE BEACH, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sun News and the state NAACP
signed a landmark agreement stipulating the newspaper will increase
opportunities for employment and promotion for minorities at all
levels in the company.
   Representatives of the civil rights organization and the
newspaper said the agreement announced Oct. 12 was the first of its
kind in the nation.
   ``Signing this unique and historic agreement we have both agreed
is the right thing to do,'' said William F. Gibson, state president
of the NAACP and chairman of the NAACP's national board of
directors.
   Gibson signed the agreement at a news conference along with J.
Michael Pate, president and publisher of The Sun News; Nelson
Rivers, executive director of the state NAACP; and Laura Hensley,
vice president of marketing and finance at the newspaper.
   ``It was a pretty easy task because we took our pluralism policy
to them and we sat down and said this is what we want to do and we
all worked it out,'' Pate said.
   One goal is for The Sun News to put blacks in 20 percent of
management, senior management and professional positions by the end
of 1993.
   The agreement also calls for The Sun News to make 10 percent of
its purchases from minority-owned businesses by 1991, 15 percent by
1992 and 20 percent by 1993.
   Pate said the percentage of minoriting reluctance of campus
administrators to release campus crime reports to the public and
campus communities.''
   The Legal Defense Fund also provided a $1,000 emergency grant to
SPJ chapters in South Carolina to help challenge the state's
criminal libel law.
   In the past two years, two newspaper editors in South Carolina
have been arrested on criminal libel charges stemming from their
reporting about public officials. SPJ feels such prosecutions,
while never brought to trial, have a chilling effect on
journalists.
   In other free speech matters, SPJ directors voted Oct. 14 to
give a First Amendment Award to Cincinnati art gallery director
Dennis Barrie for his stand on artistic freedom. Barrie was
acquitted Oct. 5 of pandering obscenity for exhibiting photos by
the late Robert Mapplethorpe at the Contemporary Arts Center in
Cincinnati.
   ``His battle to uphold the principles of the First Amendment
came at considerable expense and the threat of jail,'' said SPJ
President Frank Gibson, metro editor for The Tennessean in
Nashville.
   SPJ presented two other First Amendment Awards during its
convention:
   -Texas Supreme Court Justice Lloyd Doggett, for longstanding
efforts on behalf of governments having open meetings and records.
   -Peter Sussman, editor of the San Francisco Chronicle's Sunday
``Punch'' section, for publishing the bylined essays of Dannie
Martin, a convicted bank robber. The inmate and the newspaper have
suedin federal court to try to overturn prison restrictions on
Martin's reporting.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Revives $4 Billion Libel Suit Against ABC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court revived a $4 billion lawsuit
by a millionaire inventor who says ABC's ``20-20'' falsely
portrayed him as a liar and hypocrite.
   The justices told a federal appeals court Oct. 9 to restudy
Arthur Jones' libel suit over the 1987 report on the fate of 63
baby elephants Jones rescued from death in Africa.
   The justices said the case should be reconsidered in light of
their June ruling that the Constitution's guarantee of free speech
did not ``create a wholesale defamation exemption for anything that
might be labeled opinion.''
   The June decision, however, did not strip away constitutional
immunity for pure expressions of opinion that cannot be proved true
or false.
   Jones, the inventor of Nautilus exercise machines, was the
subject of a ``20-20'' broadcast in 1984 - the year he flew the 63
elephants from Zimbabwe to the Ocala, Fla., farm he calls
Jumbolair.
   The elephants had been marked for death as part of a culling, or
herd thinning, operation.
   The elephants lived on Jones' Ocala estate until the summer of
1986, when the herd began to be dispersed.
   The 1987 report aired by ``20-20'' was preceded by a comment by
host Barbara Walters that it would discuss ``the fate of some baby
elephants to whom a promise was not kept.''
   According to Jones' suit, that comment and others contained in
the report ``falsely cast him as a liar and a hypocrite, and
accused him of animal cruelty.''
   U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich dismissed the suit
before it reached a jury. She ruled that some of the comments cited
in the lawsuit were not defamatory and that those which might be
were expressions of opinion not statements of fact.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal in
December.
   Lawyers for ABC, urging the justices to reject Jones' appeal,
said the broadcast ``simply does not contain . . . statements
accusing him of hypocrisy, lying, unscrupulousness and cruelty to
animals.''

<HEAD>Eight Police Officers Sue Toledo Blade</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight police officers filed a $24 million
suit charging The Blade invaded their privacy and libeled them in a
series of articles about the police department.
   The suit claims The Blade's series, ``The Secret Files of
Internal Affairs,'' gave an inaccurate portrayal of the officers.
The officers said they were not prosecuted for any of the incidents
related in the articles.
   The suit, filed Oct. 11 in Lucas County Common Pleas Court, said
the plaintiffs had suffered humiliation and mental anguish because
of the series.
   Jonathan Hart, a lawyer for The Blade, said the newspaper stood
behind the stories.
   ``The newspaper researches, reports and publishes important
facts affecting the public interest of the citizens of Toledo, as
The Blade believes it did in news articles complained of by these
officers,'' Hart said from his Washington office. ``The Blade
believes the news articles were true when they were published and
continues to believe them to be true.''
   The series, which ran in June, was based on a review of nearly
1,000 disciplinary files of former and current officers. The files
are maintained by the police department's Internal Affairs unit.
   The Blade reported that officers have committed crimes but have
not been arrested. The newspaper also detailed social problems
facing the division, including substance abuse and domestic
violence.

   A newspaper photographer was charged with
obstructing a police officer after he took pictures of Cherokee
County sheriff's deputies capturing an escaped prisoner.
   Joe Cook, of the weekly Cherokee Citizen, was charged Oct. 8
because he ignored officers' orders to step back from the arrest
scene and because he swore at them, Sheriff John Seay said.
   Cook said deputies arrested him because they were afraid he had
pictures of them beating the prisoner. He said his camera was taken
from him and the film removed.
   ``They thought I had pictures of them roughing him up,'' Cook
said. ``He was groaning and said, `Please, no more.' ''
   Sgt. Jim Harvey denied the prisoner was beaten, saying he
struggled with deputies. ``Any scuffle would look like you're
roughing the subject up,'' he said.
   Cook said he was making pictures of the prisoner being carried
to the street and was told to step back. He said he stepped back to
a point designated by officers. He said he continued to photograph
the capture but was continually thwarted by an officer who stepped
in front of him.
   ``I pointed my finger at him and said, `Get out of my way,' ''
said Cook, who admitted swearing at the officer.
   Cook posted bail of $1,200. He said his camera had black and
white film when he was arrested but contained exposed color film

<HEAD>Pravda Editor Says He Survived Reporters Revolt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The editor of Pravda says he survived a mutiny by
reporters, who want to raise plummeting circulation by replacing
rambling speech text with more lively copy.
   On Oct. 11, Pravda published an unsigned denial of reports that
the newspaper's Communist Party organization called last week for
the resignation of Ivan Frolov, who was appointed editor a year
ago.
   The notice, buried on page 8, acknowledged that the newspaper's
party organization had ``sharp, sometimes tough'' discussions
during two days of meetings and that ``criticism of the leadership
was expressed.''
   But, it said, the meetings ``did not adopt a no-confidence
resolution in the chief editor.''
   Frolov said at an unusual news conference on Oct. 10 that
``these people thought they could organize a mini-coup.''
   Outside in the hallway, Pravda writers held what they called a
``parallel'' news conference about their efforts to unseat Frolov.
They said they sought to improve the newspaper, officially
described as the ``organ of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party.''
   Pravda satirist Vladislav Yegorov told reporters the party
organization at the newspaper had passed a resolution asking the
Central Committee to ``review the question of the editorial
board.''
   He said 140 workers at Pravda who are members of the Communist
Party cell had considered calling for Frolov's resignation but
dropped the idea as too provocative.
   Last year Pravda's circulation dropped by 3 million, to about 7
million, and it appears to be falling further during a subscription
drive now under way, Yegorov said.
   He said readers were bored by the format of Pravda, which last
week devoted its pages to the full texts of speeches from a two-day
meeting of the Communist Party's Central Committee - a body of
diminishing relevance in Soviet politics.
   ``Our readers don't want that,'' said Yegorov. ``The most
important thing is to make it a newspaper that is interesting to
readers.''

   Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore lashed
out at the media Oct. 15, blaming television for the bloody
crackdown on China's pro-democracy movement and the Western press
for the fluctuations in Hong Kong's stock exchange.
   Lee also defended his country's rigid restrictions on foreign
media, accusing newspapers such as the Asian Wall Street Journal of
interfering in Singapore's domestic politics.
   Lee made his comments in a speech before the Commonwealth Press
Union, which comprises more than 500 newspapers, news agencies and
periodicals in 30 countries of the British Commonwealth.
   He said China's students were seduced by television into
believing they could change China.
   ``I believe it is this contextless television experience that
led to the tragedy of Tiananmen on June 4,'' he said.
   Lee said students in China for years had watched Chinese news
reports on demonstrations in the Philippines and student protests
in South Korea.
   ``China's students forgot that China was a very different
country from either the Philippines or South Korea, two countries
with close links to the United States where the media and Congress
wield immense influence,'' he said.
   Lee also blasted the foreign press in Hong Kong for trying ``to
foist Western values'' on the British colony.
   He blamed the foreign press for causing large drops on Hong
Kong's stock market.
   ``Much of the gyrations . . . could have been lessened if the
Western press based in Hong Kong had not crusaded for their vision
of democracy in Hong Kong,'' he said.

   The International Press Institute criticized
Kenya's single-party government for banning a magazine that had
repeatedly called for multiple political parties.
   The Nairobi Law Monthly was the fourth publication banned by the
government in two years.
   In a message to Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, institute

   The institute, an independent organization of publishers and
editors in some 60 countries, released a copy of the leader Oct. 9.
   The magazine was banned Sept. 28 under an order signed by Kenyan
Attorney General Matthew Muli. The ban came two days after Moi
threatened to arrest critics as part of a renewed crackdown on
those calling for multiple parties.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shortly after the U.S.-Soviet business weekly
Commersant hit the newsstands in January, government ministers
started calling editorial offices to find out how to muzzle its
sharp commentaries.
   ``When they found out we were independent, they kind of lost
their bearings and gave up,'' said Vladimir Yakovlev, Commersant's
editor in chief.
   Commersant and two other new Soviet periodicals owe their
independence in part to the policy of glasnost and in part to their
backing from investors in the United States and other Western
countries.
   Commersant is backed by the U.S. investment company Refco. The
tabloid provides a weekly barometer of the ups and downs of foreign
enterprises' performances in the Soviet Union and critical features
on Soviet economics.
   Its Russian circulation is 350,000 and its English distribution
is 30,000, Yakovlev said. Commersant recently went on sale in the
United States.
   According to officials of the State Committee for the Press,
joint ventures have filed 23 applications to start publications,
while private individuals filed 60 and political parties and public
groups filed 20.
   Izvestia and Hearst Publications published a pilot issue of a
new English-Russian newspaper on July 4 and hope to be issuing a
regular edition next year. The weekly magazine Business Week
brought out a dual language edition last summer and also hopes to
publish regularly.
   Special one-time editions of Western magazines, including Ladies

<HEAD>Newsprint Recycling Board Named in Maryland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. William Donald Schaefer appointed a
nine-member board Oct. 10 to oversee Maryland's newspaper recycling
law.
   The law passed this year by the General Assembly requires that
by 1992, 12 percent of newsprint used by Maryland newspapers must
be recycled paper. The quota rises to 40 percent by 1998.
   Fees will be levied against publishers that do not meet the
goals.
   The Newsprint Recycling Board will have authority to waive the
fees for publishers that prove they cannot reach the quota.
   The board is made up of representatives of newspaper publishers,
state agencies, private businesses and environmental groups.

<HEAD>Post, Paper Firm in Venture To Boost Newspaper Recyling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUNDALK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington Post and a Baltimore waste
paper processor are planning a newspaper recycling venture.
   The Post and Canusa Corp. hope to open a paper-bundling plant in
Dundalk that could handle up to 6,000 tons of old newspapers a
month.
   A corporation they formed, Capitol Fiber Inc., has submitted the
proposal to Baltimore County. Under a county law the plant must be
approved by county environmental officials.
   The plant would sort and bundle the papers in 2,000 pound bales,
prior to shipment to recycling plants, said Bruce Fleming,
president of Canusa.
   Capitol Fiber's application says it would initially be getting
about 1,800 tons of old newspapers a month picked up from
Washington sidewalks. The company would charge the city $10 a ton
for the paper.
   Fleming said he hoped to strike similar deals with Baltimore and
Baltimore County for their newspaper, once they implement recycling
plans.

   Newspapers in Louisiana will begin
printing on recycled newsprint by 1992, officials of the Louisiana
Press Association said Oct. 9.
   The voluntary plan calls for recycled paper to account for 10
percent of the state's newsprint consumption in 1992, 20 percent by
1995, 30 percent by 1997 and 40 percent by 2000.
   David Manship, associate publisher of the State Times and
Morning Advocate in Baton Rouge, said the program is similar to one
now in place in New York state.
   He said most major producers should be able to supply newsprint
with recyclable fibers by 1992.

   CBS Earnings Down 30 Percent in Third Quarter
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. reported a 30 percent decline in
earnings in the third quarter, citing higher television
expenditures, partly for news coverage of events in the Middle
East.
   The network said Oct. 10 that its after-tax profit fell to $43.5
million in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to earnings of
$61.9 million during the same period in 1989. Revenue rose 12
percent to $662 million from $593 million.
   Laurence A. Tisch, CBS president and chief executive, said
increased programming costs contributed to the weak quarter. He
said the televison network spent more money on new program
development, first-run summer programming and the aquisition of
program rights for sporting events.
   The company said revenue growth increased primarily from
broadcasts of major league baseball games.
   ``CBS's earnings rre likely to continue to decline,'' Tisch
said. ``However, CBS has the cash reserves to steer through an
economic downturn, while sustaining our long-term plan to improve
ratings.''
   For the first nine months of the year, CBS earned $266.8 million
on revenue of $2.34 billion. That compared to a net profit of
$236.8 million on revenue of $2.10 billion a year earlier.

   A producer responsible for an interview with
a ``Buckwheat'' impostor on ABC's ``20-20'' resigned, the network
said.
   Lynn Murray resigned in a ``mutual decision'' with ABC because
of the Oct. 5 segment, ``Whatever Happened to `Our Gang?',''
spokeswoman Maurie Perl said Oct. 11.
   The news magazine aired an interview with a man who claimed he
played Buckwheat in the ``Our Gang'' comedies of the 1930s and '40s
and was now working as a grocery bagger in Tempe, Ariz.
   William Thomas, who actually portrayed Buckwheat, died in 1980.
   Victor Neufeld, the program's executive producer, decided Murray
did not properly handle research for the segment, Perl said. Murray
had worked with ``20-20'' in several capacities for 10 years, Perl
said.

<HEAD>Financial News Network Fires Executive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financial News Network, the 24-hour
business-oriented cable television service, said Oct. 12 that it
fired a top executive for improper financial dealings.
   The company said C. Steven Bolen was dismissed as chief
financial officer following a board investigation that concluded he
``received compensation payments that were not properly authorized
and . . . that certain bank accounts administered under (his)
direction were not properly recorded.''
   The company said two other employees in the accounting staff
were put on leave while FNN reviews their status.
   Bolen has been on leave since summer, when questions about
payments to him first surfaced, said sources close to FNN who spoke
on condition they not be identified.
   Bolen, who had been with the company for about five years and
worked out of its Los Angeles office, earned $185,000 annually. No
charges have been filed against him.
   Bolen could not be located for comment.
   FNN said it believes all the funds have been accounted for. FNN
spokeswoman Amber Gordon would not comment on how much money was
involved.
   Separately, FNN and Infotechnology Inc., which owns 47 percent
of the news service as well as 97 percent of UPI, said they had
terminated the services of their accounting firm, Deloitte &amp;
Touche.
   A committee comprised of FNN board members recommended the
termination because it didn't think the firm ``would be able to
complete the audit work in a timely fashion,'' FNN said.
   Deloitte, in turn, notified FNN, Infotechnology and UPI that the
financial statements it prepared for them should no longer be
relied upon.
   Deloitte said it was withdrawing its 1989 opinion of FNN's
financial health because of fresh information concerning some
transactions between FNN and UPI, as well as questions about 1989
financial statements by Bolen.
   FNN since has retained Coopers &amp; Lybrand as its auditors.

<HEAD>ABC, British Agency To Send News to Japanese Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC News and Worldwide Television News have
agreed to provide domestic and international news reports to Fuji
TV, Japan's largest commercial network.
   The deal, announced Oct. 10, was the second in two months
between American and Japanese networks.
   CBS and the Tokyo Broadcasting System agreed in September to
combine resources and technology for worldwide newsgathering.
   The CBS contract is exclusive and gives Tokyo Broadcasting the
right to air in Japan such programs as ``CBS Evening News'' and
``60 Minutes.''
   The ABC-WTN contract with Fuji is non-exclusive, according to
WTN, a London-based agency serving 1,000 clients worldwide,
including CBS and CNN.
   The Fuji deal also doesn't provide for sharing facilities
overseas nor does it give the Japanese company rights to air ABC's
regularly scheduled news programs, said Scott Michaelis, WTN's
regional executive for North America.
   Fuji will be allowed to excerpt news reports broadcast on ABC's
``World News Tonight,'' he said. Fuji also will get all of WTN's
international news reports under the agreement.
   ABC, which owns 45 percent of WTN, recently agreed in principle
to raise its stake in the company to 80 percent. London-based
Independent Television News and Australia's Nine Network would
share the remaining percentage.

<HEAD>Rural Backyard Dishes Favored in Cable TV Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new proposed compromise for re-regulating
cable TV would require the industry to sell network programs to
some 3 million mostly rural owners of backyard satellite dishes,
its Senate sponsors said Oct. 12.
   Providing details of an accord negotiated over the past two
weeks, Sens. Al Gore, D-Tenn., and Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., said
cable networks could still restrict their programs to subscribers
of local cable distributors.
   But Gore said the compromise also now includes ``critical
language protecting the backyard home satellite dish market'' - a
provision that cable operators have vigorously fought the past
eight years.
   However, he acknowledged that the bill could still be stymied in
the waning days of the 101st Congress by objections from other
senators and the Bush administration.
   Both the Senate bill and a similar measure passed by the House
last month would require cable operators to provide a ``basic
tier'' of service - local and public TV stations plus
government-access channels - at rates to be regulated by the
Federal Communications Commission.

<HEAD>CBS Sportscaster Apologizes for Polish Comment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS sportscaster Jack Buck apologized Oct. 10
for comments he made after entertainer Bobby Vinton flubbed the
national anthem before a baseball playoff game.
   Vinton stumbled over several lines of ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' before the Cincinnati Reds' 5-3 victory over the
Pittsburgh Pirates on Oct. 9. Afterward, Buck said, ``Well, when
you're Polish and you're from Pittsburgh, you can do anything you
want with the words.''
   Vinton, a native of nearby Canonsburg, is known as ``The Polish
Prince.''
   Buck's comment drew criticism from Lawrence R. Wujcikowski,
president of the Polish Falcons of America, a Polish hertiage group
based in Pittsburgh.
   ``If (Buck) wanted to comment on Mr. Vinton's singing, then he
should have done that. But he could have left being Polish and
living in Pittsburgh out of it,'' Wujcikowski said.
   Buck said he meant his remarks as a compliment to Vinton.
   ``On the heels of the national anthem, I tried to pay a
compliment to Bobby Vinton and it didn't come out right,'' he said.
``I was saying that if he messed it up, that's OK because everybody
loves him. And he did mess it up, didn't he?''

   Alma Stead, a longtime staff writer for the
Oxford Eagle, died Oct. 5 after a long illness. She was 62.
   Stead had worked for the Eagle for 12 years and reported on
local government and courts. She previously worked for other
nce to Tokyo and other cities in
Japan, the Department of Transportation announced on Monday.
   Three air carriers - United Air Lines, Delta Air Lines and
American Airlines - were authorized to serve Tokyo.
   Delta, America West Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines were
authorized to serve two other Japanese cities, Nagoya and Fukuoka.
   The route awards were granted under a November 1989 agreement
which laid the foundation for a major expansion of air service
between the United States and Japan.
   In making the announcement the department noted that the
U.S.-Japanese market currently generates more than $6 billion in
revenue for both countries. Last year the Japan market ranked third
in numbers of passengers, after Canada and Great Britain, and was
first in passenger revenue.
   Monday's announcement is the last of several awards authorizing
new flights to Japan.
   In July, Federal Express, which had been providing all-cargo
service to Tokyo, was permitted to serve Nagoya as well. In August,
United Cargo Service was selected to operate a new all-cargo
service to Tokyo. And in September the department allotted the 450
charter flights authorized by the agreement.
   Patrick V. Murphy, deputy assistant secretary for international
affairs, made the following new selections:
   -Chicago-Tokyo authority to United with backup authority to
American if United does not choose to fly the new route.
   -Los Angeles-Tokyo authority to Delta with backup authority to
American.
   San Jose-Tokyo authority to American with backup authority to
Continental Airlines for Houston-Tokyo service.
   -Honolulu-Nagoya authority to America West with backup authority
to Continental.
   -Honolulu-Fukuoka authority to Hawaiian Airlines with backup
authority to Continental for Los Angeles-Nagoya service.
   -Portland-Nagoya authority to Delta with backup authority to
Continental for Seattle-Nagoya service.
   Nine air carriers submitted 23 proposals for the new routes, the
department said.

   Paul K. McMasters, deputy editorial
director of USA Today, was honored Oct. 13 with the Society of
Professional Journalists' highest award.
   The longtime supporter of the society and current chairman of
SPJ's Freedom of Information Committee was named as the 1990 Wells
Key recipient at the society's annual awards banquet.
   The Wells Key award memorializes Sigma Delta Chi's second
national president, Chester Wells, who died in 1913, shortly after
assuming office. The society has since been renamed the Society of
Professional Journalists.
   The incoming society president, Frank Gibson of The Tennessean
in Nashville, described McMasters as ``the epitome of the SPJ
volunteer.''
   ``As chairman of the Freedom of Information Committee, he has
given long and unselfish service to carry forward the bedrock
mission of SPJ's past and its future,'' Gibson said.
   On Oct. 12, delegates at SPJ's convention named three Fellows of
the Society of Professional Journalists: Loren Ghiglione, editor of
The News in Southbridge, Mass.; Georgie Anne Geyer, syndicated
columnist for Universal Press Syndicate; and Bernard Shaw,

   Designation as an SPJ Fellow is the highest honor the society
gives for public service.

   The Bush administration, strongly opposing a
House Democratic plan to sharply boost taxes on the wealthy, is
setting the stage for an election-season showdown with Congress
over a deficit-reduction plan.
   The government will be forced to begin shutting down again if it
can't agree on a deficit-reduction plan with Congress by Friday,
White House Chief of Staff John Sununu predicted Sunday.
   All sides ``will have difficulty'' agreeing on a budget by then,
he said.
   The president and Congress have been negotiating for months on a
deficit-reduction plan to cut spending and increase taxes by about
$500 billion over five years.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Leonard Bernstein, the ``West Side Story''
composer and flamboyant conductor who won a wider audience for
classical music and became a pop celebrity of the rock 'n' roll
age, has died at age 72.
   Bernstein died Sunday at his home of lung failure, said his
physician, Dr. Kevin M. Cahill.
   The son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Bernstein became the
wunderkind of American music nearly five decades ago at a time when
all respected conductors in the United States were born and trained
in Europe.
   Bernstein was a conductor, pianist, educator, author and
composer. His compositions included the theatrical, chamber music,
symphonies, ballet and even a Mass.

   JERUSALEM (AP) - In a defiant response to the U.N., Israel has
rejected a mission to investigate the killings of 19 Palestinians
on the Temple Mount and announced a new building drive to populate
Jerusalem with Soviet immigrants.
   Sunday's Cabinet decisions appear to set the Jewish state on a
collision course with its chief ally, the United States, which has
appealed to Israel to accept the United Nations investigators.
   The U.N. Security Council voted unanimously Friday to condemn
the Temple Mount shootings, which occurred one week ago during
riots at the Jerusalem site revered by both Jews and Moslems.
   n a rare gesture, the United States joined in the censure of
its ally, agreeing to a resolution calling for the dispatch to
Jerusalem of a three-member delegation to probe the shootings.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Attorney General Dick Thornburgh overruled
career Justice Department lawyers in agreeing to pay $25,000 to a
former political appointee who was investigated in the alleged
disclosure of government secrets, sources say.
   A senior department lawyer who reviewed the case of Roger Pilon
concluded that there was evidence to support his firing and that he
was not entitled to reimbursement for his legal bills, according to
a memo to Thornburgh obtained by The Associated Press.
   But the attorney general disagreed and instead authorized a
settlement with Pilon, who headed the department's Asylum Policy
and Review Unit.
   Several top aides strongly disagreed with Thornburgh, according
to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Deputy Attorney
General Donald B. Ayer, who wrote the memo to Thornburgh, resigned
in May - partially because of the attorney general's handling of
the matter.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev won
the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize on Monday for easing international
tensions, but claimed it as an endorsement of wrenching changes he
has made at home.
   The Norwegian Nobel Committee said the 59-year-old Soviet leader
displayed a ``leading role in the peace process which today
characterizes important parts of the international community.''
   ``Words fail one at such moments. I am moved,'' Gorbachev said
in a television interview.
   ``I perceive this action of the most authoritative organization
of the global community first of all not in personal terms, but as
recognition of the significance of the immense cause of perestroika
for the destiny of the entire world,'' he said.

   JERUSALEM (AP) - Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Monday accused
the world of hypocrisy, ignoring murders of Israelis while
condemning Israel for killing 19 Palestinians in Jerusalem last
week.
   In a strongly worded warning to Iraq, Shamir also said any
intervention in neighboring Jordan that upset that country's
stability would bring swift Israeli retaliation.
   Addressing Parliament, Shamir defended his Cabinet's rejection
Sunday of a U.N. Security Council resolution urging a U.N.
investigation of the deaths on the Temple Mount a week ago.
   The Cabinet action was criticized Monday by left-wing parties,
and the largest opposition faction, the center-left Labor Party,
said it would join a no-confidence vote against Shamir's

   President Bush on Monday condemned ``ghastly
atrocities'' by Iraqi forces in occupied Kuwait and warned Saddam
Hussein that, like Nazi officials after World War II, he may face a
war-crimes trial.
   ``Hitler revisited,'' Bush said of Saddam. ``But remember, when
Hitler's war ended, there were the Nuremberg trials. America will
not stand aside, the world will not allow the strong to swallow up
the weak.''
   Bush, on a two-day campaign trip for Republican candidates,
recounted stories of Kuwaiti babies being removed from incubators
so the machines could be sent to Baghdad. Similarly, he said
dialysis patients were taken from their machines so the machines
could be used in Iraq.
   He said two youngsters who distributed leaflets were executed by
Iraqi forces as their parents were forced to watch.
   Bush said the incidents point up ``the cruel and senseless
suffering endured by the people of Kuwait; a systematic assault on
the soul of a nation.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court turned aside free-speech
arguments Monday and boosted the federal government's crackdown on
obscenity.
   The justices, over one dissenting vote, let stand the forced
closing of three adult bookstores and nine video rental shops in
Virginia under a federal anti-racketeering law.
   The businesses' owners, convicted of racketeering and selling
obscene materials, had argued that the subsequent seizures of their
properties violated their free-speech rights.
   The seizures were carried out under provisions of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Those convicted
under that law may be forced to forfeit all assets and proceeds
stemming from their illegal activity.
   Justice Byron R. White voted to hear the business owners'
appeal, but four votes are needed to grant such review.

days left in the year. A reminder: Daylight-Saving Time ends at
2:00 A.M. Sunday. Clocks go back one hour.
   Today's Highlight in History:
   On Oct. 27, 1787, the first of the ``Federalist Papers,'' a
series of essays calling for ratification of the United States
Constitution, was published in a New York newspaper. The essays,
written anonymously by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and John
Jay, argued in favor of a strong national government.
   On this date:
   In 1795, the United States and Spain signed the Treaty of San
Lorenzo, which provided for free navigation of the Mississippi
River.
   In 1858, the 26th president of the United States, Theodore
Roosevelt, was born in New York City.
   In 1880, on his 22nd birthday, Theodore Roosevelt married Alice
Lee.
   In 1886, the musical fantasy ``A Night on Bald Mountain,''
written by Modest Mussorgsky in 1867 and revised after his death by
Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, was performed in St. Petersburg, Russia.
   In 1904, the first rapid transit subway, the IRT, opened in New
York City.
   In 1914, author-poet Dylan Thomas was born in Swansea, Wales.
   In 1922, the first annual celebration of Navy Day took place.
   In 1938, Du Pont announced it had coined a name for its new
synthetic yarn: ``nylon.''
   In 1947, the radio show ``You Bet Your Life,'' starring Groucho
Marx, premiered on ABC. (It later became a television show on NBC.)
   In 1954, Walt Disney's first television program, titled
``Disneyland'' after his yet-to-be completed theme park, premiered
on ABC.
   In 1967, ``Expo `67'' closed in Montreal.
   In 1978, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin were named winners of the Nobel Peace Prize
for their progress toward achieving a Middle East accord.
   In 1982, China announced its population totaled more than 1
billion people, as counted by more than 5 million census takers.
   Ten years ago: 30 American prisoners in Cuba were released and
flown to the United States. Opera star Beverly Sills gave her last
performance on an opera stage, appearing in a Lincoln Center
production of ``Die Fledermaus.''
   Five years ago: The United Auto Workers union announced that
members had voted to approve a new contract with Chrysler
Corporation, ending a 12-day strike. The Kansas City Royals won the
World Series, shutting out the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 7, by a
score of 11-0.
   One year ago: The third game of the World Series, delayed by the
Northern California earthquake, was played at Candlestick Park. The
Oakland A's defeated the San Francisco Giants, 13-7.
   Today's Birthdays: ``Tonight Show'' executive producer Frederick
DeCordova is 80. Actress Teresa Wright is 72. Actress Nanette
Fabray is 70. Hall-of-Famer and sportscaster Ralph Kiner is 68.
Actress Ruby Dee is 66. Former White house chief of staff H.R.
Haldeman is 64. Actor-comedian John Cleese is 51. Actress Carrie
Snodgress is 44. Actress and TV personality Jayne Kennedy-Overton
is 39. Singer Simon Le Bon is 32.

   Reading President Bush's lips was a lot easier
than reading his mind about taxes, as demonstrated in his on-off
switch on a bargain to boost the top income tax rate.
   After raising the possibility, Bush hedged, reopened, hedged,
and, for a while, seemed to be enjoying the confusion before he
finally said no deal.
   That stirred up the chronic factional strife in Congress, and
within the Republican minority, escalated the discord over an
assortment of rival budget plans and threats.
   The White House and Congress, Republicans and Democrats all look
like losers in the stalemate over their most basic assignment, the
long overdue task of financing federal operations.
   Doomsday comes on Friday, when the government again will run out
of spending authority unless the Congress finally produces a budget
and Bush signs off on its terms.
   It is a deadline Bush said he will not waive by accepting a
temporary extension of spending authority without an overall budget
settlement. He said the clock is going to keep running because
without that pressure, Congress wouldn't do anything.
   ``They are going to have to stay in town and pass a budget,''
Vice President Dan Quayle said in a CBS interview as the rival tax
writers staked their latest positions on the Sunday television talk
shows. ``The president is simply not going to let the Congress go
home until they pass a good deficit-reduction plan that is going to
avoid a recession.''
   Beyond that, there has been no clear White House strategy since
the rejection of the earlier budget deal, produced in five months
of negotiations and abruptly spurned by the House.
   There certainly was no game plan showing last week when Bush
reopened the old idea of swapping an increase in the top tax rate
for a cut in capital gains taxes, the latter an elusive goal of his
since the 1988 campaign.
   He said there would have to be proper balance between the boost
and the cut; the idea was tried in summit negotiations and failed
because Democrats and Republicans never could agree on a proper
balance. Democrats wanted a higher tax rate and a smaller capital
gains reduction than Bush was willing to accept.
   In rerun, the same dispute made the same deadlock inevitable.
   After reviving the idea, Bush gave Republican senators the
impression he'd drop it, but his spokesman then revived it.
Campaigning last Wednesday, the president seemed to be enjoying the
confusion. He even parodied his most famous campaign slogan. ``Read
my hips,'' he said, when asked while jogging whether he was
dropping the capital gains reduction.
   Finally, in a written statement on Thursday, he said he didn't
think the trade would work, and called it a waste of time.
   ``Indeed, I'm quite concerned that pursuing it in the current
context may not only fail, it may legitimize something farther to
the left that we cannot accept,'' Bush said.
   He didn't say why he restarted the pursuit.
   While the capital gains tax he wanted is out of the bidding, the
higher income tax rate he vehemently opposes is not. House
Democratic tax-writers are pushing a top rate of33 percent to
apply to all upper-income taxpayers.
   Quayle says the administration is violently opposed. Bush would
be almost certain to veto a budget that included the upper-income
tax boost.
   The Democrats are using the tax dispute in an attempt to depict
Republicans as the party of the rich. Rep. Dan Rostenkowski,
D-Ill., chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said he wouldn't
deny that they are trying to make a political statement by pushing
the tax rate increase in the House.
   The Senate Finance Committee wants to raise taxes without
changing the top overall tax rate, by limiting itemized deductions
for upper-income Americans. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, called it
a back door route to the same outcome.
   Nevertheless, the White House is willing to swallow a settlement
on those lines, increasing income taxes so long as there is no
increase in the rate.
   But conservative Republicans would rather fight than switch to
any tax increases. So would GOP candidates who took the hard, Bush
line against new taxes early in the campaign and have seen that
issue undercut.
   As he campaigns, Bush is telling Republicans they need to stand
firm for the best budget possible.
   The trouble is that GOP factions disagree with each other, as
well as with Democrats, on what that is.

   To paraphrase Mark Twain as Bart Simpson
might do it, the reports of Fox Broadcas are
greatly exaggerated, man.
   Especially from Fox's perspective. Little more than three weeks
into the fall season, the 4-year-old netwoting Co.'s deathrk is suffering
the
bitter taste of prolonged bad press. Its executives are feeling
persecuted.
   Welcome to the big leagues, boys.
   For those who just landed from another planet, Fox took ``The
Simpsons,'' its overnight, runaway sensation, and slammed it right
in the face of NBC's top-rated, long-beloved ``The Cosby Show.''
   In short, David walked right up to Goliath and unleashed his
slingshot. Then he thumbed his nose.
   Goliath has not fallen.
   Since moving to Thursdays at 8 p.m., reruns of Fox's animated,
bug-eyed ``Simpsons'' had been trounced by original ``Cosby''
episodes. But in its fall premiere last Thursday, ``The Simpsons''
lost by only one-tenth of a ratings point.
   Fox was gleeful ab spy chief Zvi
Zamir and is only empowered to make recommendations.
   Foreign Minister David Levy said Israel's stand against the
United Nations could strain ties with the United States: ``The
situation now is difficult, one mustn't take it lightly.''
   The Cabinet's response gave vent to Israel's frustration at
coming under strong criticism at a time when civilians are being
issued gas masks to cope with Iraq's threats to attack with
chemical weapons. The army started handing out the defense kits
last week in three towns and planned to widen distribution to all
cities, including Arab villages, beginning today.
   The Temple Mount clash was the bloodiest of a 34-month
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of lands seized in
the 1967 Middle East war. Moslems revere the site as the place
where the prophet Mohammed ascended to heaven.
   It is the Jews' holiest site, and the location of the Western
Wall, or Wailing Wall, remnant of their Biblical temple.
   The Temple Mount shootings have shifted the focus of the
Palestinian uprising from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to
Jerusalem, home to 350,000 Jews and 150,000 Palestinian Arabs.
   On Sunday night, the Israeli government announced plans for a
building campaign throughout Jerusalem to dramatize its claims to
the city.
   The committee on immigration decided to build about 5,000
apartments in the coming year and to ask the Cabinet to approve
incentives to contractors and Soviet immigrants, said Absorption
Ministry spokeswoman Ida Ben-Shitreet.
   Mrs. Ben-Shitreet said housing would go up in eight
neighborhoods, six of them in predominantly Arab east Jerusalem,
which Israel captured in 1967 and later annexed.
   The decision comes despite U.S. requirements that Israel avoid
settling Soviet newcomers in occupied territories or east
Jerusalem. These were conditions of a $400 million loan guarantee
approved by Congress this month.

<HEAD>Leadership in America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Among the lessons emerging from the federal
budget merry-go-round is that leadership in America is in trouble.
   Your next-door neighbor might tell you that it began long before
this, but the inability of political leaders to reach an
understanding on so basic an issue as the budget has showcased the
problem.
   After a year of economic stagnation and big debts, and rising
unemployment in recent months, most American households have had to
cut deeply and painfully into their budgets. They had no choice but
to do so.
   Business and charities too have been cutting. In some companies
the efficiency measures have been as drastic as any ever taken
before, but they had no choice in the matter. Cutting was a matter
of survival.
   Washington's inability to reach an agreement therefore stands in
contrast to the personal experience of millions of people, and it
leaves them asking who and what they can rely on, if not
themselves.
   Moreover, the new budget will mean higher taxes, which most
people will see as no solution. Households and businesses were
denied that course; workers cannot order higher paychecks and
businesses cannot raise revenues at will.
   The tax increase also comes at what could be an inappropriate
time, when sales are off, the credit structure ailing, job security
tenuous and confidence at some of the lowest ratings since the
early 1980s.
   Moreover, few can forget, those higher taxes are arriving on the
scene after the public was assured for months that the line would
be held.
   The giants of American business probably did little to inspire
confidence either, announcing last week that the economy would
weaken and probably fall into recession, after saying earlier that
there wouldn't be a recession.
   Even the impersonal government statistics have done their bit to
erode confidence. Earlier this year the official economic numbers
indicated a moderately active economy, but those figures later were
revised downward.
   While it is unlikely, further official revisions in the future
could show that the economy was indeed in recession in the late
summer and fall of 1990, but that it was not known to the
record-keepers.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, whose commitment is to orderly
monetary policy, seemingly remains aloof from the battle of the
pocketbooks, declining to lower interest rates until Congress
reaches agreement on a budget.
   But here, too, there are doubts about the Fed's power. How can
the Fed cut interest rates if inflation is rising? What power does
it have over inflation from high energy prices, when those prices
are determined abroad?
   Wall Street, too, has inspired little confidence, with some of
the same people who forecast a strong market last spring now,
somewhat tardily, telling their customers that a bear market lies
ahead.
   It is probably a significant commentary about so-called experts,
leaders, authorities, forecasters and the like, as well as an
indication of the times, that a contrarian view of things can gain
the confidence of people.
   In the stock market and perhaps in the larger world of economics
and finance, the contrarian view holds that if so many are
expecting bad times it is worth studying the possibility that
better times might lie ahead.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - As the world was edging toward another world
war, they worked feverishly trying to decipher coded messages the
Japanese were sending from embassy to embassy and warship to
warship. And long before the first bomb fell, they cracked the code
the Japanese thought was unbreakable and learned that war was
imminent. Because of bureaucratic bungling by the intelligence
agencies, they didn't learn where it would start.

   Fifty years ago - and more than a year before Pearl Harbor -
Americans scored one of their most brilliant victories of World War
II.
   The commander was a Russian immigrant and sometime geneticist
named William Frederick Friedman. The nature of the battle might be
suggested by Friedman's intense interest once in the 50,000-word
novel ``Gadsby,'' which Ernest Vincent Wrigh wrote without using
the letter ``e.'' Friedman's troops were a motley assemblage of
academics, math wizards and puzzle freaks. With a left-handed
assist from William Shakespeare.
   Together, after 18 baffling months of dead-end days and
floor-walking nights that temporarily collapsed Friedman into a
mental ward, they broke the Japanese diplomatic code.
   Their collective genius did not foil, of course, the sneak
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States
actively into the war. Crossed and sometimes disconnected wires in
American intelligence enabled that. But codebreaking by Friedman,
et al, laid the groundwork for the pivotal victory of the U.S.
fleet at Midway in June 1942. Indeed, codebreaking was an essential
ingredient of the Allies' ultimate triumph.
   Let us begin the tale with John Quincy Adams. As secretary of
state 1817-1825 he hired the first U.S. code clerk. Codebreaking
and-or making was not a pressing concern at the State Department
for years, not even when Herbert O. Yardley, 24, signed on as a
$17.50-a-week code clerk in 1913.
   Yardley had been an indifferent student back in Indiana but had
a flair for math. Today he would have become a computer hacker.
Back then he was a Morse code hacker. And, at State, bored. So
bored he began cracking incoming code traffic. He deciphered a
message to President Woodrow Wilson from his top aide, Col. Edward
M. House, in but two hours. He joined Army intelligence in World
War I as a lieutenant and cryptographer.
   The Army had another such lieutenant, Friedman. He had been born
near Odessa in 1891, was brought to America by his postal worker
father to escape anti-Jewish rioting and eventually graduated from
Cornell University as a geneticist.
   As Friedman was settling into a postgraduate career of fruit
flies and Mendelian imperatives, a letter arrived at Cornell. It
came from Col. (honorary) George Fabyan, a wealthy cotton broker
and world-class eccentric who was looking for a ``would-be-er, not
an as-is-er'' geneticist to help improve the flora and fauna on the
farm at his Riverbank Laboratories outside Chicago.
   The colonel, who kept a pet gorilla and drove about in a
carriage drawn by two zebras, had another, non-mammalian passion:
to prove that Sir Francis Bacon and not Shakespeare wrote
Shakespeare. He had only to decipher the code he believed Sir
Francis had encrypted in ``Troilus and Cressida'' etc. to prove
Bacon's authorship and thereafter bask in the world's acclaim. His
codebreaker was a similarly convinced proper Bostonian, Mrs.
Elizabeth Wells Gallup. She in turn hired an assistant, Elizebeth
(her mother spelled it without an `a' so no one would call her
daughter Eliza) Smith.
   When Friedman arrived at Riverbank in 1915, he brought with him
an interest in photography. Mrs. Gallup asked him to photograph
some Shakespeare folios. He thereupon became fascinated with a)
Miss Smith and b) cryptanalysis (a word he coined) and married both
for life.
   ``When it came to cryptology, something in me found an outlet,''
he was to say. ``Just an inherent curiosity to know what people
were trying to write that they didn't want other people to read.''
   While Sir Francis's hidden messages kept eluding Mrs. Gallup,
the Army began sending cryptograms and coded messages to Riverbank
for deciphering. Friedman broke one, keyed from a book, without
even knowing what the book was. Impressed, the Army enlisted him
into its primitive code apparatus when World War I broke out.
   After the war, Friedman, convinced that Fabyan was rather an
oddball, nonetheless reluctantly returned to Riverbank. The Army
sent out a ciphered message it considered absolutely
undecipherable. Freidman cracked it and sent back a letter to
Washington in the same cipher. The Army hired him in 1921 to work
up its codes. Mrs. Friedman eventually worked for the Coast Guard
cracking codes of Prohibition rumrunners. And Friedman wrote some
seminal works on cryptology.
   Yardley, meanwhile, had been set up in secret in mid-town
Manhattan with Army and State Department slush funds to run a
codebreaking operation he called the Black Chamber. His first coup
was to crack the codes the Japanese delegation was using at the
1921 Washington Naval conference to limit construction of capital
ships.
   Not to be outdone, the Navy in 1924 appointed Lt. Laurence F.
Safford to head a new Research Desk in the Code and Signal Section.
In the finest tradition of interservice rivalry, Safford's unit in
Room 2646 of the Navy Building never communicated what it was doing
to the Army Building next door on Constitution Avenue in
Washington. Lack of communication among communications spies was to
remain a problem all along the road to Pearl Harbor.
   It did slowly change, however, in the face of a technological
revolution: Radio.
   Radio direction finding - pinpointing the source and
destinations of coded messages through triangulation by
eavesdropping receivers - had entered the arsenal of modern
warfare.
   In 1925 the Navy began installing radio monitors at Guam, the
Philippines and Shanghai. Two years later the U.S. cruiser
Marblehead, porcupined with antennae, shadowed the Japanese fleet
maneuvers.
   Less visible sailors with civilian safecrackers stole code books
from Japanese consulates, even in Washington where the party-loving
naval attache, Lt. Cmdr. Kiyoshi Hasegawa, dallied with a lady
agent while his safe was rifled. The results were deciphered with
the assistance of Dr. and Mrs. Emerson J. Haworth, he a former
Quaker missionary and professor at Tokyo University.
   Codebreaking had become an intense activity, so much so that
Yardley's Black Chamber had broken the codes of 19 nations by the
time Henry L. Stimson became Herbert Hoover's secretary of state in
1928. By then State was financing Yardley exclusively. Stimson, a
jewel in the high hat of the Old School, was aghast. A dedicated
peacemaker, he said: ``The way to make men trustworthy is to trust
them.''

   Even though Japanese militarists were already clashing with
Chiang Kai-shek's soldiers in China and were murdering dovish
ministers at home, Stimson closed down the Black Chamber with one
of the most famous quotes in all cryptography: ``Gentlemen do not
read each other's mail.''
   In reaction, the Army created a new Signal Intelligence Service
under Friedman (who by oversight never got a security clearance)
with a staff of six to prepare codes, locate enemy radio stations
and break ciphers. And Friedman began talking with Safford.
   For his part, an angry Yardley told all in a 1931 best-seller,
``America's Black Chamber.'' His book was his last, greatest and
wholly unintended gift to American cryptology. It persuaded the
Japanese to start using encrypting machines.
   These were nothing new. Thomas Jefferson - who else? - had
invented one. His had wheels which turned in a sequence so that
`a', for instance, went in one end and came out `z' at the other.
The key to deciphering was to find the key to the encipherment, the
system used to turn the wheels. Introducing electricity over a
century later meant the wheels could turn infinitely faster
producing millions of possible combinations.
   Yet a basic of decipherment remained: The frequency letters
appear in a given language. The letter `e' is the most common in
English, hence Friedman's absorption with nn e-less novel.
   An electrical enciphering machine named Enigma was sold for
commercial users in Germany after the first war. In 1927 the Army
Signal Corps bought one for $144. It became the Nazis' Achilles
heel throughout World War II. They complacently believed Enigma
unbreakable. But the British, with the help of some briliant Poles,
cracked it, giving the Allies a fateful advantage.
   The Japanese had the same confidence in 97-shiki O-bun Injiki -
Alphabetical Typewriter 97. The Americans called the machine Purple
after a color in the spectrum. They had already broken a Japanese
machine they called Red.
   The Navy had cracked Red with the help of an accommodating woman
provided by the Office of Naval Intelligence who tarried in bed
with Lt. Toshikazu Ohmae while agents rifled his briefcase. Then, a
much more sophisticated machine, Purple, began to be intercepted by
the Navy's listening radios.
   Capt. Jinsaburo Ito of the Japanese Navy had developed No. 97.
``Let America and Britain solve this cipher if they can,'' he said.
   Friedman's staff of 19 codebreakers was given the challenge.
   Codebreakers, to say the least, do not come in tidy packages.
Winston Churchill was to say of the grab bag of geniuses who
cracked Enigma: ``I told you to leave no stone unturned in your
recruiting. I did not expect you to take me so literally.''
   America's cryptographers included stamp collectors, chess
masters, a naval officer who accepted a tennis date knowing nothing
of the game but learned it overnight from a book, Mrs. Agnes Meyer
Driscoll, who was a devotee of cryptic puzzles and taught many the
tricks of the trade. And Friedman, a golfing family man with an
alert, kindly face who could see patterns where others saw only
chaos.
   The small, parochial world of cryptography of the 1930s
exchanged enciphered Christmas cards, held round-robin restaurant
parties at which guests had to solve a cryptogram at the appetizer
eatery to tell them where to go for the fish course. Purple, in a
world edging toward war, was something else.
   Purple was for use only in the major Japanese embassies. On Feb.
18, 1939 Tokyo signalled these outposts Purple was going on line.
It made the fatal error of sending parallel messages on the Red
machine to lesser consulates. Comparing the two, Friedman's crew
decrypted 25 percent of the cipher in a few weeks. Thereafter: a
brick wall.
   Little steps, nonetheless, could be taken. The Japanese, a
formal people, stick to proper and unvarying ways of address.
Diplomatic messages, encoded, could be compared with the same
messages when delivered to American diplomats in translation - if
they were the same messages. Messages sent in Red were compared
with Purple intercepts made about the same time.
   Night after night Mrs. Friedman, who could not be told why,
could hear her husband pacing back and forth in their kitchen.
   ``Naturally, this was a collaborative, cooperative effort,''
Friedman later said. ``No one person was responsible for the
solution.''
   There were Safford's people who kept up a steady flow of radio
intercepts. Japanese diplomacy sometimes came via American
commercial cable companies instead of by radio. Rights to privacy
notwithstanding, cable managers would pass on copies and times of
transmission. (But the scrupulous cable managers in Honolulu did
not give the FBI copies of Japanese messages, some of which were
Pearl Harbor spy reports, until a week before the attack).
   Then, sometime in August 1940, Harry Laurence Clark, one of
Friedman's young cryptographers, had an insight that came to him in
the night. He came to work the next day ecstatic.
   ``I wonder if the monkeys did it that way?'' he is quoted by
Friedman's biographer, Ronald Clark. ``That way'' was to use
telephone stepping switches in the Purple machine, not electric
wheels.
   Friedman's crew began scrounging switches from telephone
companies, even five-and-dime stores. By guess and by God and by
genius and by inspired calculation they began piecing together a
copy of the machine none of them had ever seen or ever would see
and which was talking in a language few of them knew.
   It buzzed and sparked and wasn't lovely, but on Sept. 25, 1940,
America's Purple machine decoded its first full message.
Washington, again, could read Tokyo's hand.
   As the Japanese Empire inexorably collapsed in on itself in
flames, Purple machines were smashed into bits as embassies closed,
garrisons surrendered or, more often, fought to the last man. One
machine, partially intact, was captured on Guam. Of its hundreds of
wired connections, only two were different from the sight-unseen
Purple machines of William F. Friedman and his crew.
   Even after the war was over, the Japanese refused to believe
what the Americans had done. No, they said, they must have stolen a
Purple machine somewhere.
   They had. Out of the air.

   EDITOR'S NOTE - They are alien creatures of the deep, unknown in
the waters of the United States until a few years ago. They can cut
off the water supply of cities, ruin boat engines, and scientists
worry that they will upset the aquatic food chain. The invasion of
the zebra mussels, which began in the Great Lakes, is expected to
spread to waterways across the land.

   Microscopic at birth, the tiny invaders
ride the currents of the Great Lakes searching for a home along the
rocky lake bottom, or better yet, on a man-made structure.
   Life is easy with few natural predators and plenty of solid
structures to attach their hairlike tentacles. And laying 30,000
eggs a year does more than just keep the family heritage going.
   They grow to the size of a pistachio nut within two years as the
zigzagged stripes begin appearing on their army-green shells. Man
is little deterrent to their population explosion because he's
still trying to understand them.
   ``At first we couldn't identify it,'' says Monroe water plant
superintendent Wilfred LePage. ``A couple months later, biologists
told us, `You have zebra mussels and you may never be rid of them
again.'''
   That was in January 1989. Last December, a colony of zebra
mussels and ice clogged Monroe's only water intake from Lake Erie,
cutting the flow to a trickle. Businesses and schools were closed,
hospital surgeries were postponed and the city went to a local
river and nearby Toledo for water during the two-day emergency.
   ``We went through hell,'' LePage says.
   The event earned Monroe a reputation as the Pearl Harbor of the
zebra mussel invasion. Eventually, the fingernail-sized, inedible
mollusk is expected to spread beyond the Great Lakes to lakes and
rivers in 60 percent of the country.
   ``The lesson I'm trying to get out to water plants is, `Get
ready, because they're gonna come.''' LePage says. ``And when they
do, things happen so fast. Then you'll have to pull out all the
stops just to keep your plant running.''
   Some already know.
   -The city of Detroit water department, which provides drinking
water for 42 percent of Michigan's 9 million residents, this year
built a chlorination plant to control zebra mussels at one of its
three water intakes.
   -The U.S. Coast Guard is finding zebra mussels on the bottoms of
some of its navigational buoys and vessels in the Great Lakes.
Marinas in Lake Erie report the zebra mussels have been found
blocking water intakes for engine cooling systems.
   -The four major steel companies in northwest Indiana have
received variances from their pollution discharge permits allowing
them to use molluscicides to kill zebra mussels at their water
intakes in Lake Michigan.
   -Electric utilities along Lake Erie are stepping up their
inspections of water intakes for coal-burning and nuclear power
plants. Detroit Edison estimates it will spend $500,000 next year
for a zebra mussel control program at its Monroe coal-burning
plant.
   The coming of the zebra mussel has ramifications beyond just
water plants. Scientists worry that they will alter the aquatic
food chain, that mollusk-borne toxins will end up in sport fish and
waterfowl, and that zebra mussels will disturb fish-spawning
grounds and clog water intakes critical for farm irrigation.
   The mussels also cling to boat hulls and boat engines, and their
shells can slice the feet of beachgoers. They are the Great Lakes'
version of the leaf-eating gypsy moth caterpillar or the
Africanized ``killer'' bee.
   ``The zebra mussel is likely to spread much more quickly than
the gypsy moth,'' says Richard Moll, assistant director of the
Michigan Sea Grant program. ``I would imagine in a couple decades
they'll be found throughout the U.S.''
   Like the gypsy moth, the zebra mussel was inadvertently imported
into the United States from Europe, probably aboard a freighter. It
is one of about 115 foreign species that have been introduced into
the Great Lakes by man, intentionally and unintentionally,
according to Ed Mills, a senior research scientist with Cornell
University in Ithaca, New York.
   The zebra mussel is believed to have entered the Great Lakes
area when the freighter of uncertain flag emptied its ballast water
into Lake St. Clair in 1985 or 1986. It has been sighted in each of
the Great Lakes and is moving to inland waterways by hitchhiking on
boats, boat trailers, bait pails and even waterfowl.
   It conceivably can live in waters throughout the temperate
region of the United States, which includes about 60 percent of the
country, and southern Canada. In New York state, the zebra mussel
is moving eastward from Buffalo along the Erie Canal. The Finger
Lakes aren't far behind.
   ``They'll be colonized fairly soon,'' says Robert Lange, a
biologist with the New York Department of Environmental
Conservation. ``They are working through the Erie Canal east. So
far they've reached Rochester and eventually they'll reach the
Hudson.''
   The Mississippi River is expected to be colonized by Great Lakes
mussels entering either in Minnesota or through the Illinois River
near St. Louis.

   Lake Erie has the greatest infestation, but scientists hold out
hope that the other Great Lakes will experience only small
invasions because they don't have the rocky bottom structure Lake
Erie has.
   The zebra mussel is so dangerous because it can reproduce so
quickly. A fully mature female can produce more than 30,000 eggs
per season. The eggs are fertilized outside the shell and hatch
into free-swimming larvae called veligers.
   The veligers can remain suspended in the water for one to three
weeks, allowing currents to scatter them. If they don't settle on
firm objects in that time period, they die. Those that find a hard
surface attach to it with extremely strong tentacle-like threads.
The zebra mussel is mature at one year and can live to about 4
years old and grow to about 1{ inches long.
   ``The older they get, the tougher they are to remove,'' says
Gerry Mackie, a researcher at the University of Guelph in Ontario.
``Nothing or very few things can pry it off the rock. That makes it
tough for predators.''
   And the zebra mussel has few natural predators outside of the
diving duck and sheepshead fish.
   The zebra mussel has flourished in Lake Erie, where it filters
plankton from the water. An adult can filter about a quart of water
per day, and that's what concerns scientists about the impact on
the food chain.
   ``The current situation is the plankton is out in the open
water,'' Mills says. ``With the zebra mussel, which settles on the
bottom, they will be removing particles from the open water. More
of this food is going to be channeled to the bottom. Getting this
food to a salmon is going to be less efficient.''
   Researchers say it's too early to tell how the zeb mussel will
affect sport fishing. They say there could be an increase in mussel
predators such as the bottom-feeding sheepshead, but it's unknown
how they will affect more sought-after fish in the Great Lakes,
such as walleye and lake trout.
   Mackie says, however, there are some positive aspects to the
zebra mussel invasion. The zebra mussel's filtering ability is
making Lake Erie clearer.
   ``I've never seen Lake Erie look so nice as it has,'' LePage
says. ``I've seen the bottom of the lake in places that I've never
seen before.''
   In the Netherlands and Soviet Union, researchers put the zebra
mussel's filtering ability to use in clarifying lakes. They also
use it as a biological monitor to detect what chemicals are in the
water.
   In the United States and Canada, a new industry has sprouted
around the zebra mussel. Dow Chemical Company in Midland, Mich.,
and many others are developing anti-fouling boat coatings to keep
zebra mussels from attaching. The King Co. in Holland, Mich., has
developed a bullet-shaped squeegee to scrape and remove zebra
mussels from water intake pipes.
   Researchers from around the country are watching Congress to see
whether it appropriates $37.5 million for research and control of
the zebra mussel. Others are refining methods to control the pest.
Most of those solutions are based on chlorine, which is fatal to
the zebra mussel. It's been used for the past 200 years in the
mollusk's native Europe.
   In Monroe, a chlorine spray jet has been installed at the mouth
of the water intake to treat the water as it enters the pipe.
   ``So far we are keeping them down,'' LePage says. ``Our intake
is as clean as a whistle.''
   Monroe used the King Co.'s squeegee to clean its intake pipe
after last year's invasion. The high-tech RotoRooter removed enough
mussels to fill six dump trucks. It cost the city $250,000 to get
the system back to pre-mussel operating levels.
   The water plant sends divers down regularly to inspect the
intake for zebra mussel buildup. The city also is building a second
water intake designed to prevent another zebra mussel takeover. The
modifications will cost the city an extra $2 million, LePage says.
   To control the zebra mussel, Great Lakes researchers are trying
to learn all they can about the mussel's habits - its reproduction,
its predators and parasites, and its favorite nesting spots.
   At a recent meeting of zebra mussel experts from around the
world in Saginaw, Mich., some said the best approach may be to find
ways to control and even anticipate all introduced species, not
just the zebra mussel. Other species recently introduced in the
Great Lakes are upsetting the food chain. They include the spiny
water flea and the ruffe, a fish limited mainly to the Duluth,
Minn., area.
   The scientists proposed forming a center for the study of
introduced species, possibly to be established at a university in
the Great Lakes.
   ``It's going to take years of research before we get a
definitive answer,'' Mackie says.

   A target date of Dec. 31, 1992, was set to finish the task.
   About 60 percent of the 282 measures making up the detailed plan
of action to form the single market have been adopted by community
agencies, although some countries, notably Italy, have been slow to
put the rules in place.
   The pressure to wrap up the showcase program is keen.
   ``If we fail, there will be no political union,'' says an
official of the European Commission, who requested anonymity. ``No
one will believe in it anymore.''
   The executive agency said in a report earlier this year that the
Common Market ``is now at a crucial stage in implementation'' of
the program.
   ``This year,'' it said, ``will determine whether or not the
objectives...will be attained.''
   Rough spots lie ahead.
   Controls on individuals at the countries' borders must be
lifted.
   The Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, West Germany and France
finally agreed on a plan for removing border checks for travelers
in an accord designed to be a model for other community nations.
   Residents will be able to move freely, without showing passports
or identity cards, among the five countries by Jan. 1, 1992.
   Five years ago, the countries agreed in principle to open their
borders by 1990. But after the border between East and West Germany
opened, the deal collapsed. Some of the countries became worried
about immigrants from Eastern Europe illegally crossing into their
territories.
   The community also has had little success in evening out the
varying tax rates among the different nations.
   An effort to impose a minimum withholding tax on interest income
was a dismal failure. Luxembourg, long known for its bank secrecy
laws and tax breaks, was a fierce opponent.
   Attempts to come up with similar value-added taxes, roughly like
sales taxes in the United States, have met with resistance.
   But the community has produced a wealth of new ideas to try to
achieve its 1992 goal.
   Some of the rules or proposals:
   -Call for lifting restrictions that bar citizens of one country
from depositing money into banks in another country.
   -Provide for a team of experts to watch over mergers and
takeovers of large companies in Western Europe.
   -Insist that public contracts in telecommunications,
transportation and water and energy be open to competition in all
member countries. Companies which in the past had handily gained
contracts from their local government will not have such an easy
time in the future.
   -Set out ways for importing meat products and purebred breeding
animals into the countries.
   -Press for more competition among airlines in pricing fares and
setting routes.
   -Ensure that university diplomas issued in one country will be
recognized in another.
   ``Nobody should have any illusions about the reality of the
single market. It will arrive on January 1, 1993. Indeed, it is
already happening now,'' Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey said
in a recent speech. In July, Haughey turned over to Italy the
community's rotating presidency.
   Analysts predict the creation of the single market will give a
kick to the community economies by increasing competition, removing
red tape, getting rid of costly border controls and encouraging
economies of scale.
   That will make the European Community - not the United States or
Japan - the economic strongman of the 1990s, some say.
   To avoid distracting from the 1992 program, the community has
agreed on a three-phase plan to draw the former territory of East
Germany and its 16 million citizens into the trading bloc.
   Limited exemptions from community rules have been given so the
backward East German economy can be brought in line with the
free-market systems of the West.
   West Germany will pay most of the bills for improving the
eastern sector. Chancellor Kohl has promised that unification will
not drain money from aid programs for the community's poorer
countries of Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece.
   As an added dimension to the 1992 program, the Common Market is
considering a three-stage plan to form an economic and monetary
union, which would eventually lead to a common currency and a
central banking system modeled after the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   The project has touched off intense debate in Britain where Mrs.
Thatcher has argued against giving up national sovereignty to new
community institutions.
   Britain's go-slow approach recently won backing from other
nations worried about gloomy economic prospects because of the
Persian Gulf crisis, which has kicked up oil prices and inflation.
Support appears to be growing to delay the quick timetable of Jan.
1, 1993, for a European central bank, dubbed EuroFed, and a single
currency.
   Even so, the community intends to go ahead with a special
conference in Rome in December that will open discussions on
setting up new monetary agencies.
   Despite deep divisions over some issues, the countries still
appear committed to moving much closer together in the coming
years.
   If they succeed, Haughey's words could well come true:
   ``It is not unreasonable to say that by 1995 ... there will be
an entirely new Europe.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - The new chancellor of the University of
California at Berkeley, once a hotbed of student protest, is a
Chinese-born engineer who hopes to build some bridges, to close the
gap between science and the humanities, between the races.

   One of Chang-lin Tien's early memories
of the United States is a pair of segregated water fountains in a
Southern bus station, one marked ``whites only'' and the other
labeled ``colored.''
   ``I was very disturbed,'' says the new chancellor of the
University of California's Berkeley campus. ``I didn't know which
fountain I was supposed to use.''
   That taste of 1950s racism made a strong impact on Tien, who was
born in China, as he arrived in Kentucky to study at the University
of Louisville.
   In his $165,000-a-year job, one of his tasks will be convincing
fellow Asians that admissions policies at the prestigious
university don't discriminate.
   ``I don't pay attention just to numbers, but to interaction,''
says Tien, 55. He says, with a slight Chinese accent, that the
school needs ``more staff and faculty from minorities.''
   ``But we should be able to understand each other and work
together,'' he says.
   Born in central China to a banker's family which fled to Taiwan
after the Communist victory on the mainland in 1949, Tien studied
at National Taiwan University as well as its military academy. An
engineer by training and a member of Taiwan's academy of science,
he maintains strong ties to many Chinese organizations.
   Just how strong those ties are was demonstrated when the school
received a $1 million grant from the government in Taiwan, with
Tien barely settled in his new office. Another $1 million grant
soon came from a Chinese charitable group in San Francisco.
   Tien took over as the university's seventh chancellor on July 1.
   University officials point out that other Asian-Americans have
been in charge at some U.S colleges or universities, but they were
smaller institutions that lacked research facilities.
   S.I. Hayakawa, a Japanese-American, took over at San Francisco
State in the 1960s and quelled student rioting. He later went on to
the U.S. Senate as the man who, as he put it, took on ``spoiled
brats.''
   The problems at San Francisco State followed similar outbursts
at Berkeley, where the Free Speech Movement was born in 1964,
setting off years of tumult at the school. The climax came in 1969
when rioting broke out over a plot of land near the campus.
   The 2.3 acres was marked for student housing, but protesters
wanted to turn it into a ``People's Park.'' The violence cost one
life and injured dozens. The National Guard was called in and
occupied the city for 17 days.
   But that's history.
   Student Jimmy Chung recently wrote the San Francisco Chronicle
to complain about ``constantly bringing back the images of the '60s
to show how the university has changed over the years.''
   ``It has been a full generation since the riots and marches and
those days are but legends to us,'' he wrote. ``Our generation
deserves our own history; we are not the ashes of a once-burning
fire, as we have somehow become in the eyes of the media.''
   University officials stress that Tien wasn't chosen because of
his ethnic background. Indeed, University of California President
David Gardner said when the selection was announced in February
that Tien's ``academic record, his administrative abilities and the
regard in which he is held, not only at Berkeley but throughout the
University of California, were the only considerations...''
   But the fact that he is Chinese must be considered a plus.
   There have been accusations that the university has racial
admissions quotas and charges that minority faculty hiring has not
been aggressive enough.
   Of the 22,000 undergraduates, 45 percent are white, 28 percent
Asian, 13 percent Hispanic and 8 percent black, with the rest
coming from other ethnic backgrounds. Studies have shown that if
students were admitted strictly on the basis of grades and tests,
nearly 97 percent would be white or Asian-American.
   The university now requires students to take courses in either
black, Hispanic, American Indian, Asian or European-American
cultures. The last course is unusual, if not unique. It allows, for
example, an Irish-American or Jewish-American to study their own
cultures.
   ``It is these courses that will help all to feel comfortable by
understanding each other,'' Tien says.
   A miniature basketball hoop stands near Tien's desk with a sign
written in Chinese that - freely translated - says ``Go Bears.''
The school's athletic teams are nicknamed the Golden Bears.
   ``I used to play guard on the varsity at the university and
academy in Taiwan,'' Tien says. ``I was short, but fast.''
   Tien also is the first engineer to head the Berkeley campus, and
he feels that background will help him in his new job.
   ``I'm a mechanical engineer, not a civil engineer, but I plan to
build a lot of bridges,'' he says.
   The bridges are figurative, but Tien hopes they will span the
gap between science and the humanities and bring the races closer
together.
   Tien says his engineering background makes him ``a little more
systematically organized.''
   ``I do a lot of background work and make a quick, clear-cut
decision after all the facts are in,'' said Tien, an authority in
thermal radiation who for seven years chaired Berkeley's Department
of Mechanical Engineering.
   The chancellor, who plans to keep his hand in teaching, is
taking part this fall in a new freshman class called ``The Physical
World.''
   ``We want to introduce students in the social sciences and
humanities to the newer developments in science and technology,''
he says. ``People in all fields have to have knowledge of
technology. Just look what the computer has done.''
  Tien, long an American citizen, sees a greater role for the
school in world affairs.
   ``We need to expand our vision of the international scene,'' he
says, pointing out that Berkeley now offers international and area
studies.
   The new courses will ``provide a tremendous opportunity to
increase our knowledge of the Pacific Rim, Europe and the Soviet
Union, among other areas,'' he says.
   The new organization, which includes the existing Institute of
International Studies, is designed to ``integrate an international
perspective into the curriculum for both graduate and
undergraduates,'' according to university publications.
   ``Berkeley is not a local university,'' Tien once said. ``It is
a national university. It is an international university.
   ``Sometimes we are embedded so much in the local relationship,
we have forgotten we have a responsibility to the whole world in
terms of leading institutions in public education.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - The neighboring towns of Palomas, Mexico, and
Columbus, N.M., have been smugglers havens for years, authorities
say, with rival families battling for control of the drug traffic.
That rivalry often has been bloody.
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Everyone in this border town knows who
the drug smugglers are, but they don't want to talk about it.
   ``I don't want to end up like that other guy,'' says a Palomas
businessman, insisting on anonymity.
   That other guy was Jose ``Pepe'' Armendariz, 37, a local
businessman who was dragged from a Palomas bar in March 1989 and
shot once in the back of the head. His body was found in the local
cemetery a little more than a year ago. Townspeople and U.S. law
enforcement officers say the killing was drug-related, but official
details are scarce.
   Jose Miller Hermosillo, attorney general for the northern Mexico
state of Chihuahua, says the case remains under investigation.
   The dead man's father, Jose Armendariz, says his son had been
friends with drug smugglers since childhood, but was not involved.
   ``I think he knew something. He knew everybody around here and
what they did,'' Armendariz says.
   Several people have been killed here in the past two years in
disputes involving drug-connected families, residents and U.S. law
officers say.
   ``Pepe paid the price for being too friendly with one side or
the other,'' says Carlos Ogden, attorney and ex-mayor of
neighboring Columbus, N.M.
   Retired U.S. Border Patrol agent Don Daniels says one faction
finally forced the other out of Palomas, a town of about 8,000
people, and six or seven people were killed.
   ``They had a little mini-war,'' Daniels says.
   Michael Lappe, agent in charge of Customs at El Paso, Texas,
says the power struggle followed the death three years ago of
longtime Mexican drug kingpin Pablo Acosta. Mexican federal police
killed Acosta in a shootout at a ranch near Ojinaga, 200 miles
south of El Paso.
   Lappe says the Sandovals of Palomas were among families emerging
in the vacuum created by Acosta's death.
   Brothers Carlos and Fabian Sandoval are under U.S. indictment on
heroin-smuggling charges dating from 1983. U.S. Attorney William
Lutz of Albuquerque, N.M., said they were fugitives for seven years
after each putting up $2,500 of their respective $25,000 bonds.
   ``We've always thought they were down in the Palomas area,''
Lutz says.
   Carlos Sandoval remains at large, but Fabian Sandoval was
arrested in early September following a shootout near here, said
Federal Judicial Police Cmdr. Elias Ramirez.
   Ramirez said Sandoval attempted to bribe officers with $500,000
in U.S. currency.
   Sandoval and five men arrested with him are members of a family
linked to drug trafficking and murder, Ramirez said at a Ciudad
Juarez news conference.
   The federales seized much of the Sandoval family property,
including a lumberyard in Palomas, said Tracy Self, police chief in
neighboring Columbus, N.M.
   The family also owned landing strips, warehouses and ranches and
employed more than 100 gunmen throughout Chihuahua state, Ramirez
said.
   Many emerging Mexican drug organizations have connections to
Colombian cocaine cartels, several U.S. law enforcement officials
say. Colombian cocaine has been routinely flown into Chihuahua
state for years, they say.
   But the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
has been cracking down for the past two years. Self says there is a
tough, new federal commandant in Palomas.
   There used to be an airport west of Palomas where Colombian
cocaine was flown in, but the bi-national crackdown, including a
nearby anti-smuggling radar blimp on the U.S. side, forced the
landings farther into Mexico's interior, the officials say. Now,
they say, smugglers truck the contraband to the border and stash it
in the desolate rangeland along the 180 miles of rusty barbed-wire
fence New Mexico shares with Mexico.

   ``What the Colombians are doing is aligning themselves with
established Mexican drug traffickers, because they have all the
established routes in place, all their arrangements taken care
of,'' says Sam Herrera, resident Drug Enforcement Administration
agent in charge at El Paso.
   Self says informants in Mexico tell him Colombians have been
buying property around Casas Grandes 120 miles south of here and in
the Las Chepas area a few miles south of the border 18 miles west
of here.
   ``They're forcing people out and buying officials ... The way it
was described to me, they were telling these people, `We can buy it
from you or we can buy it from your widow.'''
   Palomas and Las Chepas are ideally located for smuggling in a
sparsely populated triangle of Mexico between New Mexico's
east-west and north-south borders.
   Palomas and Columbus have been smuggler's havens for
generations.
   ``We have families in Palomas and Columbus that are second- and
third-generation smugglers,'' Self says.
   He says they're nearly impossible to infiltrate because they're
so close-knit.
   ``You can hire 50 kids in Palomas for 50 bucks apiece to haul 50
pounds of marijuana across the line ... It's virtually impossible
to stop them all,'' he says.
   During a shootout with state judicial police a few weeks ago at
Las Chepas, one youth captured by officers told them ``they were
lucky his gun jammed or they would never have taken him alive,''
Self says. Several other youths escaped.
   Self says he fears an all-out drug war may be brewing between
rival families. He says his own life has been threatened many times
by local smugglers. He carries a submachine gun.
   He provided a list of 13 known Palomas drug smugglers and 40
weapons they have bought from one legitimate U.S. gun shop since
1986. The weapons include several semi-automatic weapons. The men
all listed New Mexico post office boxes.
   ``They get the post office box and driver's license, and with
that they can go into any gun store in New Mexico,'' he says.
   Self says children of wealthy Palomas drug families attend
school in Columbus. The children are U.S.-born and therefore
citizens.
   ``About 75 percent of our 310 students come across from
Palomas,'' school secretary Irene Davis acknowledges.
   In school, Customs and Border Patrol officers give anti-drug
lectures, but Mrs. Davis says students see the issue from
conflicting perspectives. How do children of drug families ``just
say no?''
   ``The smaller ones don't really understand what it is that's
going on, but the older ones do. It kind of gives them double
standards,'' says Mrs. Davis, 43, a lifelong Columbus resident.
   The Palomas businessman says he also worries about the lure of
easy money on children. He says his teen-age son suggested last
summer he might join the smugglers.
   ``Dad, but they make a lot of money,'' he says the youth told
him.
   The father threatened to throw his son out of the house.
   The father already had been asked to carry a package across the
border for hundreds of dollars, he said.
   ``I'm honest. I said no. I said, `When I sit down and eat a pot
of beans, I'm going to eat them without having to look over my
shoulder to see who's going to shoot me in the back. And when I go
to sleep, I don't sleep with a gun under my bed and I don't walk
around with four or five bodyguards like you guys do.'
   ``These guys have to go out in the street every day, and they
know somebody's going to knock them off one of these days.
   ``I could have become a millionaire,'' he adds, ``but I'm not
going to live like that.
   ``Like this guy that got killed. He said, `I have so much money,
I'm not going to be able to spend it the rest of my life.' He sure
didn't. He didn't get to spend it.''

   ANTELOPE WELLS, N.M. (AP) - Just across the barbed-wire border
fence that separates William Hurt's vast 4H Ranch from Mexico, a
200-acre cornfield concealed an estimated $40 million worth of
marijuana.
   The 9-foot corn was tall enough and thick enough that the
marijuana planted between the rows could not be seen from Hurt's
ranch, 50 feet away. The field was discovered by Mexican federal
police flying over in an airplane, then-U.S. Border Patrol Agent
Don Daniels says.
   When the federales raided the Mexican plantation last Oct. 1,
they also came onto U.S. soil and held Hurt, 34, and a friend at
gunpoint for a tense 15 minutes on Hurt's land, Hurt and Daniels
say.
   ``Somebody's looking to end up dead out here. I just hope it
isn't me,'' says Hurt.
   A month later nearly 50 of Hurt's cattle were rustled into
Mexico by men believed to be marijuana smugglers. He'd also had 20
head stolen in August.
   Hurt says contacts in Mexico tell him he may have been rustled
because the smugglers believed he told authorities about the
cornfield.
   ``There's already been a threat against me. I was told it was
worth so many pesos to see me gone. They (the contacts) said a
million pesos, which figures out to be about $3,000,'' Hurt says.
``I just look over my shoulder all the time.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE - Wild animals are being returned to their former
habitats in New York's Adirondack Mountains and elsewhere across
the country, but not all are being welcomed back. Docile moose are
fine and small cats are OK, some residents say, but who wants
wolves and cougars roaming around their back yard?

<TEXT>
   Dozens of Canada lynx shipped from the
Yukon are digging their claws into the high peaks of New York's
Adirondack Mountains in one of the nation's newest wildlife
restoration projects.
   In addition, female moose could be moved to the Adirondacks as
early as next year to keep company with a lonely herd of males.
   Some nature lovers want to bring back wolves and cougars, but
some residents say that's going too far.
   One advocate of wolves and cougars is Neil Woodworth, lobbyist
for the Adirondack Mountain Club.
   ``You're never going to see them, you're never going to be
threatened by them, but you're going to hear them at night,'' he
says ``It's the very essence of the wilderness, the kind of
experience you'll treasure a lifetime.''
   While many people are afraid of wolves and cougars, the less
dangerous lynx and docile moose are welcomed by conservationists
and Adirondack residents alike.
   Fifty lynx have been released since last year around Newcomb in
Essex County, about 100 miles north of Albany, says biologist
Rainer Brocke, who heads the program. About 40 more will be
released next year.
   Canada lynx are sleek cats with long fur and tufted ears,
weighing from 18 to 35 pounds. The cats live in forests, and
lumbering wiped them out in the Adirondacks in the late 1800s.
   The high peaks can sustain about 70 lynx, says Brocke, a
professor at the state University College of Environmental Science
and Forestry in Syracuse. By next year, enough lynx will have been
released to make up for cats lost to road kills, disease or even
poachers, he says.
   Biologist Bob Lund of the New Jersey Fish, Game and Wildlife
Division says, ``New York has a tremendous land advantage with the
Adirondacks. They'll probably be real successful.''
   New Jersey's efforts to reintroduce the lynx's cousin - the
bobcat - in the northern third of the state failed, mainly because
only 24 cats were released from 1977 to 1981, Lund says.
   Human development ``essentially pushed out and ran over'' New
Jersey's bobcat population by the 1950s, Lund says. Only a few
bobcat remained, and the population has been virtually unchanged
despite the restoration effort, he says.
   The lynx may fare better. So far, six have been killed by cars,
while another raiding a chicken coop was shot by a farmer. The rest
are thriving, and at least one pair apparently mated last spring,
Brocke says.
   The cats are tracked by radio collars. The males have roamed
areas as large as 700 square miles. Some lynx have wandered all the
way to New England and New Brunswick, Brocke says.
   ``They exercise their freedom to roam,'' he says. ``Some
exercise it too much.''
   The lynx are roaming to ``pick the areas where they're
interested in living and setting up shop,'' says Kent Gustafson, a
research assistant for the project. Those released in 1989 are
settling down, he says.
   Environmental officials hope to release female moose that may
entice about 20 migratory males wandering the Adirondacks to settle
down as well.
   ``The number there now is not going to get any larger because
most of them are males,'' Brocke says.
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation could begin
releasing moose in the mountains by late next year, says Peter Nye,
who heads the agency's endangered species unit.
   While New Jersey's bobcat program failed, a wild turkey
restoration had dramatic success. A decade ago, 23 turkeys were
released. Today, New Jersey's wild turkeys number 5,000 and the
state allows limited hunting of the birds, Lund says.
   In North Carolina, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has
reintroduced 22 red wolves in Alligator River National Wildlife
Refuge since 1987.
   The wolves were bred in captivity from only 40 survivors of the
species. Those survivors were rounded up in Texas and Louisiana in
1973, after Congress passed the Endangered Species Act.
   ``I tell people that if the Endangered Species Act had not been
passed till 1976, there would be no red wolves today,'' says Warren
Parker, who heads the program.
   Two litters of red wolf pups were born in the refuge this year,
Parker says. More wolves will be released in other parts of the
Eastern Seaboard next year, he said.
   Contrary to claims made by opponents of such efforts, wolves and
other carnivores are not beasts from hell, Parker says.
   ``You're not going to have to pull up and move because we put
wolves in next to you,'' he says. ``They're not going to chase
school buses and attack children.''
   Red wolves feed mostly on small mammals and do not hunt in
packs. Their cousin - the gray wolf - does hunt in bands, and is
finding a cooler welcome in the Adirondacks and other areas where
conservationists want them reintroduced.
   Defenders of Wildlife, a conservation group in Washington, D.C.,
is pushing federal officials to re-establish gray wolves in
Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.
   ``A bloody and pointed and government-sanctioned effort to
shoot, poison and trap the grey wolf off the face of the earth''
has left it all but extinct in the lower 48 states, says the
group's spokeswoman, Mary Margaret Patterson.
   Since the wolf died out in Yellowstone around 1920, the park has
been overrun by elk and bison, the wolf's prey, Patterson says.
   The wolf is needed to thin elk and bison herds that are on the
brink of starvation, she says.
   Ranchers fearful for their livestock oppose bringing back the
wolf.
   Adirondack residents don't mind lynx, which feed on snowshoe
hare and other small mammals. But only the staunchest of nature
lovers want large predators such as wolves and cougars living next
door.
   ``They add an incredible asthetic quality,'' says Woodworth of
the Adirondack Mountain Club.
   On the downside, wolf packs can wrestle large mammals such as
moose to the ground.
   Putting wolves back in the Adirondacks would jeopardize the
state's efforts to revive moose, Brocke says. Also, competition
from another cousin may leave no room for the gray wolf in the
Adirondacks.
   ``The coyote has taken over the ecological niche of the original
wolf,'' Brocke says. ``We have a mini-wolf in the Adirondacks
already.''
   Talk of restoring wolves and cougars to the Adirondacks is
premature, since researchers are waiting to see how the lynx fare.
   ``Lynx aren't a threat to anyone,'' Gustafson says. ``If you're
going to learn how to do something, you've got to start small.''

   John Shea finally agreed to do a television
series, but not until he had read dozens of pilot scripts in search
of a strong role.
   A veteran New York stage actor who has appeared in several
films, Shea is making his TV series debut on CBS in ``WIOU,'' set
in the highly competitive environment of local television news.
   Shea stars as Hank Zaret, a newly hired news director battling
low ratings at a network affiliate station in Chicago. The role of
a key man in a tough spot mirrors Shea's own apprehension about
working in TV.
   ``I didn't watch television, I didn't like it, and I didn't want
to do a series,'' Shea says. ``I felt television could destroy me.
I came out of the New York theater and had elitist attitudes.''
   But Shea, an energetic man, found that he sometimes spent six
months doing nothing between plays and movies.
   ``I was getting bored,'' he says. ``I looked for alternatives,
and my agent said a TV series was one way to solve the problem.
After I won an Emmy for playing the attorney in `Baby M.' the
networks started pursuing me in earnest. I turned down everything,
but decided to educate myself. I started reading the pilot scripts.
   Shea began splitting his time between stage and films when he
made his movie debut in ``Missing'' in 1982. Since then he has
appeared in ``Stealing Home,'' ``A New Life,'' ``Unsettled Land''
and ``Windy City.'' His TV films include ``The Impossible Spy,''
``Family Reunion,'' ``Small Sacrifices,'' ``Kennedy,'' ``Baby M.''
and ``Do You Know the Muffin Man?''
   He compares the theater to sculpture and television to
watercolors. ``On stage you're constantly chipping away at an image
to discover and reveal an ideal form, which is never achieved,'' he
says. ``In television, like watercolors, you have to know what you
want and do it very quickly.
   ``So I had a jump when `WIOU' came around. Last winter I read 30
to 40 scripts. To me `WIOU' was clearly the best for many reasons.
I got a lot of scripts for half-hour comedies, but I didn't want to
do a sitcom. I wanted a role that would challenge me.
   ``I didn't want to be the sole star of an hour drama. I've heard
too many horror stories of how actors get burned out. I wanted to
do an ensemble show.''
   Now he's working with some of the people who helped refine
ensemble dramas in the early 1980s with such multi-Emmy winners as
``Hill Street Blues'' and ``St. Elsewhere.''
   Shea heads a cast in ``WIOU'' that includes Helen Shaver as a
reporter pushing to become an anchorwoman. Shaver is also the
former girlfriend of Shea's character.
   Others in the large cast are Harris Yulin as an anchorman whose
ego matches his inflated salary, Mariette Hartley as an executive
producer who feels she should have gotten Shea's job, and Dick Van
Patten as a popular weatherman who reaps a fortune for personal
appearances.
   It's a volatile mixture of drama and black comedy that goes up
against NBC's hot police show ``Hunter'' and ABC's lyrical ``Cop
Rock'' on Wednesday.
   Shea says one of the things that attracted him to ``WIOU'' was
its similarity to the only shows he ever watched, ``Hill Street
Blues'' and ``St. Elsewhere.'' They were also ensemble shows that
blended drama and comedy, and they were developed at MTM when it
was headed by Grant Tinker.
   Tinker went on to become head of NBC when those police and
hospital dramas slowly developed an audience while charming the
critics and Emmy voters.
   ``WIOU'' is from Tinker's GTG Entertainment. Tinker was chairman
of NBC from 1981-86.
   The creators of ``WIOU,'' John Eisendrath and Kathryn Pratt,
each spent six years in local television news in Chicago.
Eisendrath was a producer and writer and Pratt was a reporter.
Scott Brazil, co-executive producer with the creators, is a former
producer of ``Hill Street Blues.''
   ``My character is a man obsessed with details, and so am I,''
Shea says. ``I was involved in the casting. I'm involved in the
writing. I'm a news junkie and I collect stories. I have a master's
degree in directing from Yale, and I see this as an opportunity to
direct again.
   ``Hank's a former boy wonder who's taken smaller stations to the
top. I think of him as a news gangster who goes after the story at
any cost. He took a fall in New York when he rushed into a story
that turned out to be wrong. Now he's wary. Everybody's on his
neck. He has to bring up the station's ratings, but he has to watch
his ethics.''
   Shea has leased a house in Santa Monica and his wife and son,
Jake, have joined him from New York. His wife is Laura Pettibone, a
fine-arts photographer whose work is exhibited in galleries around
the country.
   ``I made my debut in `Missing,' which was a prestigious picture
with Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek. I couldn't find a worthy
successor. I turned down a lot of things, went my own way, and as a
result lost my momentum,'' Shea says.
   ``I did a lot of art films abroad that no one has ever seen. So
in a way I'm entering the culture of my country in a big way. What
I haven't done before is mainstream work, and I thought a
television series would do that immediately. None of my features
were big commercial successes.
   ``This is a turning point. I'm older now, ready for a new phase
of my life.''

   There are certain songs by George and Ira
Gershwin that Michael Feinstein never ever gets tired of singing.
   Like ``They Can't Take That Away from Me.''
   Or ``Someone To Watch Over Me.''
   ``That's a song, every time I do it, I feel a different sense of
how I want to sing it,'' says the brash, boyish Feinstein.
``There's never only one interpretation.''
   In the last seven years or so, Feinstein has been singing a lot
of Gershwin - and Kern and Rodgers and Porter and Styne and all
those other great Broadway and Hollywood composers he admires with
the enthusiasm of a true believer.
   And his devotion has paid off.
   Since 1983, Feinstein has gone from tiny hotel clubs in Los
Angeles to the fabled Algonquin in New York, from concert dates all
across the country to various symphony orchestras and to Broadway
three times in two years.
   The performing - and pressure - have been almost non-stop.
   ``I do work a lot,'' the 34-year-old Feinstein said the other
day while preparing for his latest foray on Broadway, ``Michael
Feinstein in Concert: Piano and Voice.'' ``One thing that happens
when you first achieve success is that you get jobs and think `Wow!
Great! This is what I wanted my whole life!' You take everything.''
   Seven records and hundreds of concerts later, he says it's time
to slow down after being on the road for as much as seven months
each year.
   ``I got to a point where finally I had to say, `No, I'm not
going to do this.' It's hard to say no. I'm a real people pleaser.
Now I'm really starting to say no because there has to be a balance
in everything, particularly in work and play. And I'm going to take
a good deal of time off next year.''
   Besides his house in California, Feinstein now has a second home
in Santa Fe, N.M., although he hasn't been there as often as he
would like.
   ``I have unblocked a lot of my life for 1991,'' he says. ``I
just need time to myself. People hire you because they think you're
good or they love what you do. But you have to have time to be
creative. You have to have time to lie on a beach and read. To do
other things. I want to take time to learn how to use computers and
synthesizers.''
   Although he loves New York, Feinstein can't unwind in the Big
Apple.
   ``That's why I've never lived here,'' he says. ``But I meditate
- and exercise - and that keeps me sane.''
   What hasn't bothered him was the change from playing in front of
50 to 60 people at places like the Algonquin to performing before
2,000 in a theater or even 17,000 in the Hollywood Bowl.
   ``When I was first booked into a large place, I was nervous,''
Feinstein says. ``I didn't know whether I would adapt to a larger
setting.
   ``I learned that I could do the same thing on stage that I could
do in the Algonquin - relate to the people, tell stories. If I'm
comfortable on stage and act like I'm in my living room, then the
audience is going to be comfortable.''
   Feinstein beams when he talks about his latest project, a series
of recordings with famous composers playing their own works.
   ``I'm like a little kid,'' he laughs. ``I jump up and down
because it's so much fun.''
   The idea grew out of Feinstein's passion for collecting records
- something he has done since he was a child in Columbus, Ohio. It
started with old 78 rpm records of people such as Bing Crosby and
Fred Astaire and blossomed after he obtined home recordings of
many famous songwriters playing their own compositions.
   After Feinstein moved to California in 1976, he met a lot of
them - Harry Warren, Ira Gershwin, Arthur Schwartz, Burton Lane and
others.
   ``Everytime I would hear one of these guys play the piano it was
a revelation,'' he recalls. ``It's like an author reading his own
work. They know what it's about. It came from their soul.''
   Album one, ``Michael Feinstein Sings the Burton Lane Songbook,''
has just been released. And Lane, best known as the composer of
``Finian's Rainbow'' and ``On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,''
made surprise appearances on stage during Feinstein's latest
Broadway show.
   ``Burton didn't write that many shows for Broadway,'' Feinstein
says. ``He was very picky as to what he did. But he told me once
that he felt his songs were ambassadors of good will. They had made
a lot of friends for him.''
   On tap are a second volume of songs with Lane as well as an
album with Jule Styne, composer of shows such as ``Gypsy,'' ``Funny
Girl'' and ``Bells are Ringing.'' And others such as Hugh Martin,
Harold Rome, Jay Livingston, Morton Gould, Charles Strouse and
Jerry Herman have expressed interest in working with him.

   ``Are we weird?'' guitarist Chris DeGarmo of
Queensryche asks, only slightly kidding.
   No, Queensryche's not weird - it's just that hearts and flowers
are not part of their vocabulary. When they write of love, it's
obsessive and intense. Such topics as homelessness, self-reliance,
the environment and dream control are also more their speed.
   And seriousness is their specialty.
   Critics hailed the Seattle band's 1988 magnum opus,
``Operation:mindcrime,'' as heavy metal's answer to the Who's
``Quadrophenia'' and Pink Floyd's ``The Wall.'' The entire album
concerned an underground organization that preaches the overthrow
of government and the cleaning-up of a corrupt society.
   With their latest effort, ``Empire,'' Queensryche has left
behind a record tied together by a central theme and has instead
turned to individual songs dealing with specific issues. The band
used that formula on their two earlier works, 1986's ``Rage for
Order'' and 1984's ``The Warning.''
   ``The first thing that we wanted to do was not repeat
ourselves,'' DeGarmo said in a telephone interview.
   ``I think the experimentation that the band is always pushed for
is what produced `Operation:mindcrime,' and we felt confident that
if we continued just really trying to not tread water and push our
songwriting out into new areas that we'd come up with something
that we all felt really good about - and something that was
interesting as well.''
   DeGarmo called ``Empire'' a more intimate record.
   ``The last record was pretty cynical - this third person
fictional event that the listener just watched more than anything
or listened to as a spectator,'' he said, ``and this time we just
felt we needed to make a more personal record that had a lot more
`I' language in it.''
   Such songs as ``Della Brown,'' about a homeless woman;
``Resistance,'' about cleaning up the environment; and ``Best I
Can,'' a tale of triumph over adversity, prove that the band hasn't
left behind its social consciousness.
   `` `Della' talks about this media message that seems to come to
young women that if they've got looks, they've got everything,''
DeGarmo said.
   ``She tries to believe that line and never develops her mind,
never develops the person within - and what happens is eventually
that young, beautiful figure and face fades with time and she's
left unhappy.''
   Perhaps the album's most introspective track is the gorgeously
orchestrated ``Silent Lucidity,'' a haunting song about the fine
line between dream and reality and the possibility of controlling
dreams.
   DeGarmo wrote both the music and lyrics of ``Lucidity'' and said
it came from his own experiences with lucid dreaming.
   ``The first time I ever experienced a lucid dream, it kind of
really startled me,'' he said. ``I knew that I was dreaming, and
yet I could actively participate in the dream and shape it.''
   He said the song raises questions about why, if one is dreaming,
do situations seem so real.
   ``How come you can go to sleep and enter this REM state, where
you're having sight and sound information coming to your brain, and
you wake up with the experience of what you've done in your dream?
   ``And then you shake it off and go, `Oh no, it was only a dream
but, geez, it sure felt like I walked through that wall, or like
that I really flew or I had this sexual experience,' or whatever it
was that you had - that's why people wake up so freaked out out of
a nightmare. It scares them so much because it's so real,'' he
said.
   ``Empire'' also contains some of the band's first love songs,
but they're more bitter than sentimental, filled with longing and
charged with sexual energy. The songs also reflect the band's
unwillingness to completely lay bare its soul.
   ``You sort of want to reach in and write something about that
side of you, the side of you that is involved in relationships, but
yet you don't want to share that private space of your life with
everyone, so it becomes very tricky to tread that line,'' he said.
   With ``Empire,'' Queensryche has made still another attempt to
challenge itself. As DeGarmo said, they're also trying to ``keep
the predictability factor'' low and the ``goosebump ratio'' high.
   ``We kind of have this feeling that (the audience is) really
into the fact that they never quite know what's going to be on the
next Queensryche release,'' he said, ``and that they're just
willing to go along with our experimentation.
   ``I think once they get in ... they just fall further into the
abyss until they're stuck inside our records, finding new things
each time they go through them.''
   Singer Geoff Tate provides the band's trademark soaring,
operatic vocals and most of its gritty lyrics. Queensryche holds
onto an older trend in heavy metal with its two guitarists, DeGarmo
and Michael Wilton, both of whom share lead and rhythm chores
relatively equally. Bassist Eddie Jackson and drummer Scott
Rockenfield round out the band.
   DeGarmo thought that Queensryche musically has come a long way
since its start seven years ago.
   ``From a melodic standpoint, I think we're ... trying to make
songs that are a little stickier. I think the lyrics are much more
concrete now than they were in the past, and musically, the
goosebump ratio is getting higher.''

   Orion Pictures has scheduled the release of
Jonathan Demme's new thriller, ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' for
Feb. 14, 1991.
   Though debuting on Valentine's Day, the film is by no means a
romance. Based on the shocking best-selling novel by Thomas Harris,
``The Silence of the Lambs'' stars Academy Award-winner Jodie
Foster as Clarice Starling, a gutsy FBI trainee haunted by her
past, who risks her life in an attempt to save a missing woman from
death.
   ``The Silence of the Lambs'' co-stars Anthony Hopkins, Scott
Glenn, Jack Crawford and Dianne Baker.

  ENGLAND (AP) - Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio will portray Maid
Marian, and Alan Rickman will play the Sheriff of Nottingham in
Morgan Creek's ``Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,'' which stars Kevin
Costner in the title role.
   The Warner Bros. release, currently shooting for 13 weeks in
England and France, is set for release next year.
   The production is currently shooting deep in the ancient forests
of Central England, where Robin Hood's legendary Sherwood Forest
has been re-created.
   In December, the production will travel to the ancient walled
city of Carcassone, France, to authentically depict the medieval
city of Nottingham.
   This adaptation of the classic tale of the swashbuckling hero of
Nottingham Forest also stars Morgan Freeman and Christian Slater.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Cameron Mackintosh's hit London musical ``Miss
Saigon,'' will open on Broadway in March 1991 at the Broadway
Theater, where another Mackintosh hit, ``Les Miserables,'' is
currently in its fourth year.
   ``Les Miserables'' will move to another Shubert theater late in
1990 to make way for the arrival of ``Miss Saigon.''
   ``Miss Saigon'' tells a tragic story of love and self-sacrifice
involving a young Vietnamese girl and an American soldier at the
time of the fall of Saigon in 1975.
   ``Miss Saigon'' had its world premiere in September 1989 at the
Theater Royal, Drury Lane, opening with the largest advance sale in
the history of the West End.

   Take 6 has a bit of a public relations
problem it would like to clear up.
   It seems members of this sextet have been berated for lending
their distinctive a cappella harmonies to an advertisement plugging
beer.
   Now Take 6 has no philosophical problems with jingles. But this
is a gospel group, whose members don't drink, don't smoke, don't do
drugs and praise the Lord at every turn. And they most assuredly
don't do beer commercials.
   ``A lot of fans who are Christians have come to us and said, `We
knew you'd sell out. We're disappointed. We're not going to listen
to you anymore,' '' said Mervyn Warren. ``But unfortunately, it's
just not true.''
   Take 6 recorded a Levis commercial that wasn't used, television
themes to the sitcom ``Punky Brewster'' and game show ``To Tell the
Truth'' and are open to other offers. But when Budweiser beer
approached them, Take 6 said no.
   That didn't stop Budweiser from carrying through with the idea
using a group of imitators, Warren said.
   Imitation may cause problems, but - as the saying goes - it's a
sincere form of flattery. The flap over the commercial is but one
indication that the self-described ``contemporary Christian a
cappella pop jazz'' group has made an impact with a career that's
just now two albums old.
   Take 6 formed in 1980 at Oakwood College, a Baptist institution
in Alabama. After seven years of singing on the gospel circuit
under the name Alliance, they were signed by Reprise Records in
Nashville.
   Their first album unexpectedly earned a Gold record and three
Grammy Awards. Take 6 quickly became favorites of fellow musicians,
and have performed or recorded with Quincy Jones, Johnny Mathis,
Ella Fitzgerald, James Taylor, Melba Moore and k.d. lang.
   Stevie Wonder invited the group to open concerts for him in New
York City, bought hundreds of copies of their CD for his friends
and even used Take 6's music on his answering machine message. ``I
called it myself,'' Warren said.
   The just-released second album, ``So Much 2 Say,'' is a
combination of the spiritual and secular. Such songs as ``Time
After Time'' and ``Sunday's on the Way'' speak to Take 6's gospel
audience, while ``I L-O-V-E You'' and ``Where Do the Children
Play'' address more universal concerns.
   There's also something new for Take 6: Musical instruments other
than their voices.
   Deep on Side 2 of ``So Much 2 Say,'' band members joke about the
``A cappella Act of 1990'' that bans the use of musical
instruments. They immediately follow the gag with ``Where Do the
Children Play,'' the only song on two Take 6 albums with
instruments.
   According to Warren, the decision to put drums, horns and a
Synclavier on the song wasn't unanimous.
   ``When you've got six cooks in the kitchen, they all want to
season the pot a little differently,'' he said. ``I'm an `if it
ain't broke, don't fix it' type of person. I probably would not
have put instruments on it if it were completely up to me.''
   Warren, who produced the album, said he was anxious to disprove
skeptics who thought Take 6 couldn't make another successful a
cappella album.
   ``Take 6 will always be an a cappella group at heart,'' he said.
``But because we all do play instruments and we listen to all
different kinds of music, inevitably there are going to be some
novelty pieces and some departures.''
   Warren shrugged off the pressure that's generally crushing on
groups trying to follow a successful debut.
   As is traditional, the group had plenty of stored material for
the first album. The follow up was recorded in a year.
   ``The first one was kind of an introduction to the public - who
we are,'' he said. ``The second record we actually sat down and
conceptualized and wrote this entire record almost from scratch.''
   ``Where Do the Children Play'' implores adults to guard children
against drug abuse. ``These are our children,'' Take 6 sings in a
song written by members David Thomas and Claude McKnight III.
``Don't let them slip away.''
   The group is doing its part by sponsoring a campaign during this
fall's concert tour. They will select six junior high school
students from six cities (get it?), bring them to concerts and
enroll them for a stay next summer at the Music and Arts Camp at
Fisk University in Nashville.
   Winners have to show an interest and aptitude in the arts. Take
6 will announce winning students during visits to schools along the
tour.
   The group is also doing several benefit concerts for Young
People Against Crack, a Poughkeepsie, N.Y.-based teen-age education
and recreation program designed to help kids resist drugs, said
Shauna Woods of Choice Management in Nashville.
   ``We're trying to do a little something to make the world a
better place for children,'' Warren said.
   Of all the musicians with whom Take 6 has worked since the debut
a`bum, Warren said his favorite was Quincy Jones.
   ``He's always been the best for me,'' he said. ``I've always had
his records and I never dreamed that I'd be able to participate in
any way on his next record.''
   Take 6's career has taken the sextet beyond the gospel circuit.
This summer, the group performed at jazz festivals across the
country and didn't have to change a note to satisfy finicky jazz
fans, he said.
   But whatever style the group tries out, Warren said Take 6 will
always be a gospel group.

<DATELINE>ELLIS ISLAND, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You study the yellowed pictures. Could
that now-silent face belong to someone you once knew? And those
funny clogs. Your great-grandmother used to wear that kind to work
as a child, and eager for new work, the family story goes, she
brought them with her from the old country.
   Visitors to Ellis Island may find themselves looking for
personal pieces of history as they move through the new National
Museum of Immigration, in the building where their ancestors began
new lives as Americans.
   Stand in the huge registry room, the great hall with its soaring
vaults lined with thousands of Gustavino tiles. ``If they emigrated
through Ellis, you can be sure you're standing in the same space
where your ancestors stood at one time,'' says Diana Pardue, chief
of the museum services division of the National Park Service, which
manages Ellis Island.
   Ellis, you may find, is less a sight to see than an experience
to be shared, however vicariously, with the ancestors who went
through it to be admitted to the United States.
   Not that Ellis isn't a handsome sight. The 1897 main building,
in the largest restoration ever attempted in the U.S., has been
brought back from near-ruin with $156 million of privately donated
funds and has drawn critical praise as an architectural treasure.
   But perhaps some of the best treasures are the little things:
the recorded histories, the homely memorabilia donated by
individuals, the scraps of records, postcards, photos and posters.
   And, of course, the experience:
   - Land by ferry at the island and enter the building through the
baggage room, where you'll see authentic bags, boxes and trunks of
the period. Most immigrants checked their belongings, but others,
distrustful, dragged them through the entire clearance procedure.
   - Walk up a flight to the huge registry room, where arrivals
underwent initial scrutiny. Even as they climbed the steps, they
were scanned by doctors who noted those who had difficulty
climbing. They were asked if they had at least $25 to get
themselves started and given eye, mental and general health checks.
Some newcomers received dreaded chalkmarks on their shoulders that
meant more intensive examination.
   - Go through the wing of smaller examination rooms (now the
``Through America's Gate'' exhibit), connected by hospital-tiled
corridors. Here immigrants endured detailed testing, and
commissioners reviewed applications against complex regulations.
While waiting, some applicants scratched graffiti or their names,
still to be seen, on the walls. Most were cleared within hours, but
others were kept overnight in dormitories on the third floor.
   - Exit from the registry room down the ``Stairs of Separation,''
where immigrants departed after processing. The left stairs led to
the ferry back to the Manhattan docks and the right for trains to
westward destinations. (Most went west.) The center stairs were
reserved for those who were detained.
   The real mission of the museum, says Pardue, is to put this
experience into context, by telling its reasons and showing its
artifacts.
   Museum displays trace the great wave of immigration which lasted
from about 1880 to 1924 - the largest human migration in history.
Twelve million new Americans came to the country through the
immigration station at Ellis Island, opened in 1892, and perhaps as
many as 140 million Americans today are descendants of these
immigrants.
   Most came for economically related reasons: Overpopulation, land
shortages, unemployment and dislocation caused by
industrialization. The earliest came from England, Ireland, Germany
and the Scandinavian countries; later immigrants came mainly from
Italy, Russia, and Austria-Hungary. The early ones wanted land; the
later ones often just wanted jobs.
   Immigrants came through Ellis and about 30 other entry points,
such as Brunswick, Ga.; El Paso, Texas; Ketchikan, Alaska; and Port
Townsend, Wash. That's why the museum is devoted immigration itself
and not just to Ellis. ``The task of separating the story of Ellis
from the story of immigration was impossible,'' Pardue says.
   Facts are given life by memorabilia. Rail timetables list
departures to Council Bluffs, Des Moines, St. Joseph and Kansas
City via ``The Corn Belt Route.'' Original ship manifests carry
information that immigration officials relied on for official
records. Thus the visitor learns that Miss S. A. Snowden, 27, of
Bedford, England, arrived from the port of Liverpool to settle
permanently in New York City. She had three pieces of baggage.
   Voices of immigrants are heard through an archive of recorded
individual oral histories. The Park Service spent about 10 years
collecting these, searching for subjects by taking out small ads in
the AARP Bulletin and similar publications.
   Through this search, they also found items for the ``Treasures
from Home'' exhibit. After a while, Pardue says, the collection
sort of grew by itself, with one contributor telling another.
   These are souvenirs from the worlds left behind: Linens and
clothing in elaborate needlework, books, musical instruments,
sewing machines, toys, spectacles, shoes, jewelry, and other
treasures. Most immigrants arrived with just as much baggage as
they could manage, and what they brought were things they valued.
   ``The extraordinary part is that the people who donated things
are still alive, and they've been able to tell us about them, to
give us details. Someone who may have donated a doll could tell us
how she got it and what it meant.''
   There are no immigration records at museum, though future plans
- ``years away,'' according to Pardue - include a computerized
immigration archive. Dozens of outbuildings on the island await
funding for restoration, which the Park Service plans to carry out
without government help. --
   If you go, go early. Attendance has exceeded the museum's
estimates, and there may be a wait for tickets ($6 adult, $3 child,
round trip) on the Circle Line ferry to the island. There is no
admission charge at the museum.

   The tourist pickings in New York City are still good, even after
you've seen Ellis Island and mainline Manhattan attractions such as
the Empire State Building, Rockefeller Center, the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, and Wall Street.
   There are over 150 museums, 400 art galleries, 51 historic
districts, 780 landmark buildings, about 200 skyscrapers, 1,543
parks and playgrounds, nine major scenic landmarks, 38 Broadway
theaters (many more off-Broadway) and thousands of places to go
shopping.
   Don't limit yourself to Manhattan; the Bronx, Staten Island,
Brooklyn, and Queens have world-class attractions. Here are some
possibilities for your New York wish list:
   Uptown:
   - Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 112th Street and Amsterdam
Avenue. This is the largest neo-Gothic cathedral in the world, and
its stone and stained glass is still being worked on by artisans
drawn from the surrounding multi-ethnic neighborhood, under
tutelage of European masters. Attend services or take a regularly
scheduled tour. Phone (212) 316-7540.
   - The Cloisters at Fort Tryon Park. Dramatically sited
overlooking the Hudson River and the escarpments of the New Jersey
Palisades, the Cloisters is built in the manner of a monastic
retreat and houses some of the Metropolitan Museum's best medieval
art, including the famous Unicorn Tapestries. Since it's part of
the Metropolitan, one admission charge will cover both locations on
the same day. Phone (212) 923-3700.
   - Morris-Jumel Mansion, 1765 Jumel Terrace. This elegant 1765
Georgian house, built by Col. Roger and Mary Philipse Morris, has
many associations with the Revolutionary War, including service as
Washington's headquarters during the battle of Harlem Heights in
1776. It later was owned by Stephen and Eliza Jumel, Francophiles
and friends of Napoleon, from whom they received furniture for the
house. It's said to be the oldest residence in New York. Phone
(212) 923-8008.
   Midtown:
   - The new Central Park Zoo, 64th Street and Fifth Avenue. Newly
rebuilt, this zoo features both outdoor and indoor exhibits of
animals in naturalistic surroundings - a tropic house for
alligators, reptiles, birds, and monkeys, and a polar house for
bears, penguins, puffins, and other cold-weather species. You can
see the zoo's polar bears swimming from below, through a
glass-enclosed pool, or from above, from the pathway leading from
the zoo gardens.
   - Pierpont Morgan Library, 29 E. 36th Street. Oncethe home of
the famous financier, this palazzo-style building was designed by
McKim, Mead and White and now houses one of the world's best
collections of master drawings, medieval manuscripts, rare books
and historical documents. The collection includes Morgan's private
library and a Gutenberg Bible. Phone (212) 685-0610.
   Downtown:
   - Fraunces Tavern Museum, 54 Pearl Street. The site of
Washington's farewell to his officers after the Revolutionary War,
the restored tavern is a working restaurant. Five historic
buildings make up the museum, featuring Americana of the 18th and
19th centuries. Phone (212) 425-1778.
   - Trinity Church, 74 Trinity Place. This is the church whose
280-foot Gothic spire is often pictured against the towers of Wall
Street. Serving a parish chartered by King William III nearly 300
years ago, the current building is 19th century, with earlier
mementoes. Among those buried in its churchyard are Alexander
Hamilton and Robert Fulton. Phone (212) 602-0800.
   - South Street Seaport Museum, on the East River at Fulton
Street. This old maritime quarter has been restored as a museum,
featuring chandler's houses, a printshop, the Fulton fish market,
waterfront pubs and restaurants, and historic 19th century sailing
ships to tour. Visitors can cruise the harbor on a sidewheel
paddleboat and steamer. Phone (212) SEA-PORT.
   The Bronx:
   - The Bronx Zoo, East Fordham Road, exit East Tremont Avenue
subway. Arguably the most famous zoo in the world, it covers 265
acres and is home to 3,800 animals of 700 species, who live in
naturalistic settings. Easiest way to see the most is to take the
Safari and Skyfari tours via tractor train and aerial tramway. The
Bengali Express monorail goes over hilly wooded land called Wild
Asia, inhabited by many rare animals. The American bison, almost
gone from its original habitat in the West, now lives in the Bronx
on the Rare Animals Range. Phone (212) 367-1010.
   - The New York Botanical Garden, Southern Boulevard, south of
Moshulu Parkway. If you're doing the Bronx Zoo, make a day of it by
going across Fordham Road to the Botanical Gardens, one of the
oldest and largest in the country. Nearly equal in size to the zoo,
it has 12 outdoor gardens, floral exhibits in the domed Enid A.
Haupt Conservatory, and walking trails throughout, including 40
acres of original forest land. Phone (212) 220-8700.
   Brooklyn:
   - The Brooklyn Botanic Garden, 1000 Washington Avenue. Not as
large as its Bronx counterpart but rewarding for those interested
in Oriental garden design. Its 52 acres include the Steinhardt
Conservatory, which houses tropical, desert, and temperate
pavilions and a Bonsai museum. Especially evocative is the Japanese
Hill-and-Pond Garden with its torii gate. Phone (718) 622-4433.
   - The Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway. Noted for its
Egyptian and primitive art, this museum is in the same neighborhood
as the botanic garden, and a visit can be combined on the same day.
Phone (718) 638-5000.
   Staten Island:
   Richmondtown Restoration, 441 Clarke Avenue. This community of
26 historic buildings includes the Voorlezer's House (c. 1696), the
oldest standing elementary school in America. Phone (718) 351-9414.
   Queens:
   Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, Crossbay Boulevard. A haven for
naturalists, the refuge has over 10,000 acres of land and water
reserved for birdwatching and nature walks. Phone (718) 474-0613.

   If you're coming to New York City, come footloose.
   The city's public transportation system can get you into and
around town, anywhere you want to go. And with better than 100,000
visitors arriving every day to join more than seven million New
Yorkers, do you really want to look for a place to park on
Manhattan streets?
   Getting into town to start with is easy enough, with three major
airports, two major train terminals, and one major bus terminal,
all connected with local buses and taxis and most with the subway
system.
   LaGuaria and John F. Kennedy International airports, both in
Queens, are linked to Manhattan by limousine, taxi, or minibus; JFK
additionally has a bus-subway connection. Newark International,
across the Hudson River in New Jersey, has buses and bus-train
combinations to bring passengers into the city.
   Both Penn Station (Seventh Avenue and 33rd Street on the West
Side) and Grand Central Terminal (Park Avenue and 42nd Street on
the East Side) bring rail passengers directly into the heart of the
city. Those who come by intercity bus arrive at the Port Authority
Bus Terminal (Eighth Avenue at 42nd Street on the West Side). From
any of these, you can get to your hotel with a short taxi, bus or
subway ride.
   Once in town, you can get around by subway (230 miles of lines),
buses (1,745 miles of routes), taxis (12,000 licensed yellow cabs),
or on foot to any place in Manhattan or four other boroughs -
Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and the Bronx. Reach Staten Island by
the bargain-priced (50 cents) Staten Island Ferry. Bus and subway
fares are $1.15, and taxis make a $1.50 initial charge plus 25
cents for each additional one-fifth mile.
   Subway and bus route maps are available on buses, at subway
token booths, and the New York Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau
Information Center at 2 Columbus Circle. The bureau also has an
information phone, (212) 397-8222, staffed from 9 a.m.to 6 p.m. to
give you route advice and answer other tourist questions.
   Another version of the subway guide, published by John Tauranac,
Ltd., presents the system in a set of three maps - one illustrating
weekday service, one showing evening and weekend service, and the
third with late-night operations. The format is manageable 13x17
inches and folds in eighths for pocketing. It's available in
bookstores at $2.50.
   Self-guided walking tour booklets also are available at the
visitors bureau. These include guides to Rockefeller Center,
historic sights in Lower Manhattan, and all other Lower Manhattan
sights and attractions.

   To a casual visitor, China Cove on Angel
Island State Park's northeastern shore is a pleasant sandy beach
for picknicking and watching boats in San Francisco Bay.
   To others, it is ``Ellis Island of the West,'' and to many of
Asian ancestry, it symbolizes something far less welcoming.
   The old immigration station at China Cove, opened in 1910,
originally was meant to handle an expected flood of immigrants who
would be coming to the United States by way of the newly opened
Panama Canal. But it was used instead as a detention center for
most of the approximately 175,000 Chinese immigrants who came to
America between 1910 and 1940, looking for their ``Gan Saan'' or
``Golden Mountain'' of wealth which they planned to return to the
economically depressed villages that sent them.
   At any one time, between 200 and 300 men and 30 to 50 women were
detained as they tried to overcome the tangle of restrictive
anti-Asian laws. Some of these were held on the island for weeks,
months or even years awaiting hearings or appeals on their
applications. Almost 10 percent of the detainees eventually were
deported, and many of these, to avoid the humiliation of being sent
back to their villages, committed suicide.
   The detainees often wrote poetry to vent their anger, despair,
homesickness and loneliness, and some of it was carved on the walls
in the style of the Tang dynasty. The rediscovery of the carvings
in l970 prompted a California State Legislature appropriation for
the preservation of the station, which closed after a fire 50 years
ago.
   Today visitors can visit the old rooms, now brightly painted,
and see fragments of the poetry. A 50th anniversary commemoration
is planned for November, and many former detainees will make peace
with the past, says Paul Chow, whose Angel Island Immigration
Station Historical Advisory Committee is planning the event. ``We
finally made it to Gold Mountain,'' he says.

   Sobered by two snow-scarce seasons, European winter resorts are
luring skiers back to the slopes with massive investments in
snow-making machines and substitute activities ranging from winter
golf and horseback riding to sled dog runs and cooking classes.
   Europe's last two mild winters triggered an ``arc of crisis,''
mainly in the Western Alps, causing resorts to close early or
drastically curtail their season. On the eastern side of Europe's
central range, however, mountains benefited from greater snowfalls
and held the damage to a 3 percent drop in attendance.
   Meanwhile, high-altitude resorts, which boast skiing the
year-round at over 11,550 feet, boasted record seasons. France's
glaciers at Les Deux Alpes and Alpe d'Huez attracted thousands of
Italians over the border, while Hinterdux and Sulden in Austria
became the ``hotdog'' places to ski. Italy's 9,100-foot Stelvio
pass, training site for the national team and its boisterous star
Alberto ``La Bomba'' Tomba, invested $10 million in new lifts for
glacier skiing, another growing summer - as well as winter - sport
for Europeans and visitors.
   Europe's oldest resort, Italy's Sestrieres, reeled out the lure
as soon as summer ended. It is offering a half-price ($636) early
purchase season ticket for over 100 lifts spread across 250 miles
of the Franco-Italian ``Milky Way,'' which allows gliding back and
forth across the border with no passport. Also included in the
ticket are free access to health clubs, medical insurance and
helicopter evacuation in case of accident, free ski lessons for
children under 7, free tickets to a race in the World ski
championship on Dec. 11, discounts on mountain bike purchases and
free access to a winter golf driving range.
   Italy's French-speaking Val d'Aosta area, at the foot of
Europe's tallest peak, Mont Blanc, already has started its drive to
edge out Salt Lake City, Nagano (Japan), Ostersund (Sweden), Jaca
(Spain) and Sochi (USSR) for the last Winter Olympics of the
century in 1998. The Aosta resorts of Courmayeur and Pila have
poured $10 million into new snow-making equipment in 12 valleys and
started regular helicopter ski runs with mountain guides at powder
snow time or high on the glaciers. Cross-country skiers are a being
wooed by $5 rental fees, while canine fans can try their rein with
Siberian and Alaskan huskies and Alaskan malamutes at the Mont
Blanc sled dog school. Europe's version of the Alaskan Iditarod
race, called Alpirod and starring many of the American drivers from
the grueling competition, starts Jan. 22 in Courmayeur, covering
the entire Alpine region in 12 days.
   Applying the same wandering spirit to restless skiers, Italy's
spectacular Dolomite range - with its ``Superski Dolomiti'' skipass
allowing access to 12 resorts and 450 lifts - has started a new
``vacation on the move'' formula. Skiers may glide off every 48
hours to a new town, while their suitcases are bused to the next
hotel on their vacation, allowing them to unbuckle at the door of
their next overnight stay without the hassle of changing location.
   ``Our main problem has been to get the correct information on
the weather to skiers abroad,'' says Franz Peradoner, director of
the Dolomiti formula. ``While skiers might have been sobbing in one
mountain valley, others could have been kicking up powder in
another place where the snowfall hit. It's always safer to check
conditions with a quick telephone call.''
   Swanky Swiss resorts seem to have suffered the least from scarce
snowflakes. Zermatt recorded a 12.9 increase in foreign visitors,
also due to its glacier skiing. St. Moritz, with less than 50
percent of the visitors seeking downhill activities, has
diversified into cross-country, winter cricket, polo games in the
snow, greyhound racing and horse jumping.
   Nevertheless the snow-drought did hit the entire European
industry hard in 1990. France's Rossignol and Yugoslavia's Elan ski
factories posted record losses, and Salomon bindings reduced their
sponsorship to 30 World Cup skiers. Apparel companies like Benetton
took advantage of the crisis to buy up equipment producers like
Nordica boots and to start producing new winter clothes lines. And
some environmentalists, especially in Switzerland, are beginning to
request restrictions in local referendums on artificial snow
cannons, claiming it affects the alpine ecology and the water
table.
   A quick ski-around other areas:
   - Austria. Saalbach is hosting the World Ski championships in
February, and many resorts already are fully booked for the
Christmas and traditional Carnival vacations. Ice skating, curling,
winter bicycling and hiking have been planned as no-snow
contingencies.
   - Switzerland. Some resorts like Wengen (a favorite of Britain's
Prince Charles, an expert skier), and Muerren are so popular that
hotel owners accept reservations from regular clients only in
alternate years. The French-speaking Valais area has launched a
lift card useable in the entire province. Sunny resorts like Crans
Montana are offering golf-in-the-snow and outdoor tennis, besides
hiking.
   - Scandinavia. Sweden and other Scandinavian countries are
enjoying a mini-boom, reinforced by a ``snow guarantee'' triggering
a reimbursement in case the flakes do not fall.
   - France. Albertville, site of the 1994 Olympics, has been the
rising star- of France's high-tech resorts, and neighboring Val
d'Isere, Courchevel and Les Arcs are proceeding with preparations
for the world competition.
   - Germany. West Germany's resorts are offering three-hour
instead of all-day lift tickets, while Garmisch Partenkirchen, of
Olympic fame, has invested in ``snow cannons'' to avoid calling off
World Cup ski races for the fourth season in a row.
   - Spain. While the central Sierra Nevada resort coped with tons
of snow throughout the 1990 season, the popular Baqueira y Beret, a
regular stop for King Juan Carlos and his royal family, was only
intermittently open. But Spain has one of the lowest week-long lift
tickets in Europe - less than $100 for six days, while the Alpine
lifts are as high as $300 a week.

   After suffering an off-year last
season due to poor snow, Colorado ski resorts are hoping to lure
record numbers of skiers with $30 million in lift and lodge
improvements throughout the state.
   ``The forecast predicts a wet winter this year. Even the
Farmer's Almanac is predicting a snowy year,'' said Kathleen Shaw,
a spokeswoman for Colorado Ski Country USA, the industry's lobbying
group.
   The skiing in Colorado is as varied as the state's geography.
Singles and young couples - the people who can party all night and
ski all day - flock to the glitz of Aspen and Vail, provided they
can afford it.
   Families gravitate to the big resorts, too. Steamboat Springs
has grown to rival the terrain of the better-known resorts. Summit
County - with resorts at Keystone, Arapahoe Basin, Breckenridge and
Copper Mountain - has some good deals with a wide choice of where
to ski.
   Others - particularly westerners who think anything other than a
rope tow is a lift of luxury - tend to prefer the small places, the
best-kept secrets of Colorado skiing provided they can survive the
rigorous economic competition.
   Wolf Creek Pass, in southern Colorado, has snowfalls of 400
inches a year. It's unpretentious and never crowded. Ski Sunlight
near Glenwood Springs, the middle-class answer to the Aspen area's
four resorts, doesn't have the highest vertical by any means, but
it's uncrowded, has varied terrain and its lift tickets come with a
pass to the hot springs pool.
   Small areas have it tough. Monarch, between Gunnison and Salida,
has been through bankruptcy reorganization. Powderhorn, near Grand
Junction, has so many lawsuits from angry creditors, and a water
shut-off by fed-up neighbors, that it may not even open this year,
although current company officials say it will.
   Eldora, near Boulder, is managed now by Vail Associates, as is
Ski Broadmoor in Colorado Springs. Shaw says the small resorts
suffer more from high liability insurance rates, uncertain power
bills and lack of skier awareness outside Colorado, so they have a
tough time competing with the big ones.
   As baby boomers age, so is skiing. Telluride, famous for its
steep, narrow bump runs - including the famed Plunge - is grooming
and widening some of them now.
   Boomers who skied bumps all day when they were in college ski
one steep set of bumps a day, mostly to prove they can still do it.
What they prefer is well-groomed advanced intermediate runs, and a
ski school-day care option for their kids.
   At Purgatory, a previously small resort now coming into its own,
locals buy season passes for $75. Visitors get day care, lunch and
a ski lesson for $38. The top adult lift ticket price is $34.
   Colorado Ski Country says Colorado resorts, because of the
amenities they offer - including sleigh-riding and ice skating -
provide better value for the money than resorts in other states
like Utah or Wyoming.
   Aspen is touchy about its prices. Earlier this year, Aspen Ski
Co. commissioned a study that showed a week of skiing for two,
complete with air fare from Chicago and mid-range lodging, was less
than a skier would pay at Deer Valley resort in Utah. Still, the
tab runs $2,900 for the two-person package in Aspen, food and drink
not included.
   At Breckenridge in Summit County, week-long packages without air
fare start at $300. Purgatory, Crested Butte and others have a wide
range of prices.
   The rising cost of oil is likely to increase air fares this
winter, although Shaw says Colorado Ski Country expects the rising
costs to have little impact this coming season. Most travel
packages have been locked in on contract, she says, so skiers this
season won't suffer from higher air fares ``unless they decide at
the last minute to go skiing.''
   Out-of-state travelers to Colorado ski resorts don't have to
hassle with the winter crush at Stapleton International Airport in
Denver any more. In the last 10 years, airports close to major
resorts have undergone runway and navigation improvements to allow
jet traffic to land.
   Skiers going to Crested Butte, for example, can fly direct and
non-stop every day from Chicago and Dallas-Fort Worth, and on
weekends from Atlanta and Houston to Gunnison, only a 30-minute
drive to the resort.
   Hayden, a 20-minute drive from Steamboat Springs, has direct
flights coming from Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, Phoenix,
Minneapolis, San Jose and Newark.
   Choosing a ski resort involves trade-offs. A fast nightlife and
lots of shopping and restaurants generally mean crowds, too.
Conversely, a smaller area with no crowds means little or no
nightlife and little shopping.
   The time of year is important, too. Christmas in a ski resort is
an experience valued by many. Early snowbirds anxious to hit the
slopes put up with blustery cold and varying snow conditions in
November and early December. January has better snow, but it can
get cold.
   During February, March and early April, the snowpack is deep and
solid, the crowds thin after spring break, and it's warm enough
many days to ski in a T-shirt and jeans.
   Travel agents can obtain information on any of Colorado's 25 ski
resorts - lifts, terrain, prices, lodging, amenities and weather.

   The poets and the travel agents will tell you: Go to Ireland.
They'll wax lyrical about the Irish, warm and friendly, and the
countryside, beautiful - and it's cheap.
   Two out of three isn't bad.
   Two hundred years ago, Horace Walpole wrote that the Irish
``have the best hearts in the three kingdoms'' of Great Britain.
Arguably, his opinion still holds.
   The country itself, the green island, the emerald of Europe,
appears just made for photographs, as well as memories. Indeed,
several new picture books published this year try to capture the
people and the dramatic vistas in two-dimensional visions (``An
Irish Moment,'' Colour Library Books; ``Ireland: Your Only Place,''
Crown; ``Irish Cottages,'' Crown).
   No other country is so associated with a color: green. The Irish
claim their land produces 41 shades of green. It's now 42, with
U.S. currency left there by tourists.
   Which brings us to the third point: With the recent U.S. dollar
devaluation, Ireland's economic entry into the European Community
and the country's growing reliance on tourism - to survive, if not
thrive - a visit is no longer the bargain of the past. (Although
comfortable bed-and-breakfasts, listed geographically in an Irish
Tourist Board booklet, cost a most reasonable $20-$30 per person.)
   On a recent week-long trip across the country, it was decided to
bypass cosmopolitan Dublin and train-ferry from London to Rosslare
Harbour on Ireland's southeast coast. The train ride across Wales
and the luxury ferry across the Irish Sea are delightful adventures
in themselves. There are other ferry routes as well, depending on
your plans, including one from the coast of France.
   Ten minutes into the country provided the first of many examples
of the friendliness and hospitality of the Irish. When car rental
arrangements and accommodations went awry on arrival, a local lass
working for a competitor rental agency offered her home as a
bed-and-breakfast for the night and went out of her way to take us
to and from dinner, waking early to fetch our car and bring it to
us.
   From there, armed with the advice of a leprechaun travel agent
and a good map, it was off to see the country - constantly
reminding ourselves to drive on the left. A small car is a
necessity, incidentally, if your plans are to take the narrower
side roads, the ones the Irish now call ``regionals'' as compared
to the ``national'' highways.
   From Rosslare, it was on to Wexford, Waterford (yes, the crystal
palace), Dungarvan, with its Celtic Sea coast vistas, Cork (the
country's second largest city) and just north, Blarney (not a long
way from Tipperary).
   The 15th-century Blarney Castle lures tourists with the legend
of its Blarney Stone, the promise of everlasting eloquence to those
who kiss it. According to the story, recorded in verse centuries
ago:
   ``There is a stone there
   ``That whoever kisses
   ``Oh! he never misses
   ``To grow eloquent.''
   Others, obviously not Irish, say kissing the stone assures
telling lies for seven years.
   Getting to the stone takes some clambering up ancient staircases
to the roof, where the ritual requires lying down on one's back and
leaning over backwards to plant a pucker on the piece.
   There is more to see around the castle, including the Rock
Close, with its Witches' Kitchen and Wishing Steps, and the Castle
House, but, sure, 'tis the Stone that attracts.
   On the road again, doubling back south, through Cork, to the
seacoast resort of Kinsale, then east and then north toward
Killarney and the precarious and astounding ride around the Ring of
Kerry peninsula with its dramatic views from sinuous mountain
roads. (Take the tour; leave the driving to them.)
   Then, farther north toward Tralee - if there's time, a side trip
to the Dingle peninsula - where ``Ryan's Daughter'' was filmed -
and a short ferry ride across the Mouth of the Shannon to Kilrush
and a few miles across to the Atlantic coast town of Kilkee.
   The spectacular Cliffs of Mohrer rise up from the ocean on the
road north toward Galway.
   Then, time running out, it's back south toward Shannon and the
touristy ``medieval banquet'' entertainment at Bunratty Castle
before one last pint of stout and shopping at Shannon airport.

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A picturesque river winds through historic
downtown. Adventurous sorts explore ancient Spanish missions - and
spicy Mexican food. Margaritas and mariachi music abound.
   It's all part of the appeal of San Antonio, a place of history
and romance, where diversions are many.
   From its quaint restaurants and pubs along the popular River
Walk to the museums of the nearby Alamo, this city of a million
people - the nation's ninth-largest - fascinates all ages. And the
friendly, relaxed mood is instantly pleasing.
   ``Charming, that's the word we hear a lot,'' says Frances
Schultschik of the Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``There are a
lot of things for people to do, with the history and the charm.''
   By far the most popular destination is the Alamo, site of a 1836
battle in which 189 Texas patriots died at the hands of the Mexican
army of General Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna.
   Established in 1718, the Alamo, or Mission San Antonio de
Valero, was one of a chain of Spanish missions built by Franciscan
friars trying to introduce Christianity to the Indians. The Texans
later used the Alamo as a fort in the war for independence from
Mexico.
   Missions San Jose, Concepcion, San Juan Capistrano and Espada
also dot the city as part of the San Antonio Missions National
Historical Park. Each of the missions has an active parish church.
They are popular spots for traditional San Antonio weddings.
   La Villita is another must-see attraction for history-lovers.
This downtown village is nestled along the San Antonio River and
houses shops and art galleries in its old buildings.
   The Menger Hotel, built in the 19th century next to the Alamo,
has gone through several restorations to preserve its historic
atmosphere. The hotel's bar, where Theodore Roosevelt recruited his
``Rough Riders,'' is filled with folklore.
   Across downtown, a literal taste of San Antonio awaits at Market
Square, patterned after a traditional Mexican market. The famous Mi
Tierra and La Margarita restaurants serve up sizzling fajitas,
savory enchiladas and other favorite Mexican foods and beverages.
Jovial mariachi musicians provide the entertainment.
   Just as popular are the market's assortment of gift shops and
its dozens of trinket-selling vendors in the huge El Mercado.
   The ultimate San Antonio event takes place each spring when the
entire city lets loose for ``Fiesta.'' Dozens of festivals, parades
and other special events take over the city during the wild
three-week party.
   Festivals also are part of San Antonio's charm the rest of the
year.
   The Texas Folk Life Festival on the grounds of the Institute of
Texan Cultures in early August celebrates the diverse ethnic
heritage of the state with food, music and dancing.
   A festival of lights illuminates the River Walk at Christmas. A
10-day St. Patrick's Day celebration - featuring the river dyed
green - takes place in March. Various other art and music festivals
occur throughout the year.
   ``The city is known for its fiestas - just about any time of
year you can come down here and be a part of some event that's
going on,'' Ms. Schultschik says.
   For visitors who like amusement parks or animals, San Antonio
has at least two major attractions.
   At Sea World of Texas, killer whales, dolphins and sea lions
perform shows, and sharks, penguins and other sea creatures are
exhibited in natural settings.
   The internationally known San Antonio Zoo has 3,612 animals,
representing 674 species. Its African antelope collection is one of
the largest and most varied in the world. It's the only zoo
exhibiting an endangered whooping crane.
   In 1992, the city will greet its newest attraction, a musical
theme park called ``Fiesta Texas.'' Park developers, who also
created Opryland in Nashville, say Fiesta Texas will feature the
music and culture of Texas and the Southwest.

   Some other tourist spots in South Texas:
   - The Caravan Corral at McAllen, a project of the Chamber of
Commerce, offers a motoring convoy that can last as long as 40 days
to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula or the Chihuahua Desert. A guide, a
mechanic and a bilingual ``green angel'' familiar with Mexican law
and customs, bring up the rear of each convoy.
   - The Encinitos Ranch, 45,000 acres of Texas prairie near Alice
in the Rio Grande Valley, shows what it was like to be a cowboy in
earlier times. Guests ride out on horseback every day for a week,
eat out on the range and sleep under the stars - and earn $1 a day.
(Also available is a one-evening hayride or campfire.)
   - Old-time charm is the attraction of the small hamlet of Gruene
(pronounced ``green'') on the banks of the Guadalupe River. It
claims Texas' oldest dance hall, Gruene Hall.

   Following the 14-hour flight from Bangkok to Seattle, you stand,
exhausted, before the Customs inspector. Your ears are so stuffed
you hardly hear him say, ``Open that bag, please.''
   As you do so, carry-on items erupt onto the counter. Among these
is a papaya you'd forgotten to eat during the journey.
   Travelers delayed behind you glare suspiciously as the inspector
interrogates you and eventually confiscates the fruit. In failing
to declare it, you broke the law.
   It's that easy to become a ``criminal'' while going through
Customs. Even forgotten fruit - prohibited because crop-killing
parasites may be present - gives you a ``record.''
   Embarrassment and confiscation are minor compared to jail terms
or fines imposed for illegal drugs, firearms or counterfeit goods,
but computerized files give inspectors instant information about
past infractions which, however slight, can cause annoying delays
following future excursions abroad.
   Your best defense: know and abide by regulations. All purchases
and gifts acquired abroad, plus repairs and alterations, must be
declared.
   Provided you've been abroad at least 48 hours and haven't used
your exemption within the previous 30 days, your exemption is $400,
(or $600 from Caribbean basin countries) including one liter of
alcoholic beverage (prohibited by some states) and 200 cigarettes
or 100 cigars (Cuban cigars only if purchased in Cuba).
   Keep receipts handy to show value, especially on high ticket
items. Families may combine exemptions, but minors may not import
alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
   If you don't meet the 48-hour or 30-day requirements, your
exemption is $25, including 50 cigarettes or 10 cigars, plus 4
fluid ounces of alcoholic beverage or perfume, and may not be
declared on a family basis.
   Travelers returning from the U.S. Virgin Islands, Samoa or Guam
have $1,200 in exemptions, including five liters of alcoholic
beverage.
   If acquisitions exceed exemptions, 10 percent is charged on the
next $1,000 worth of merchandise (or 5 percent if you're returning
from the U.S. Virgin Islands, Samoa and Guam). Thereafter,
individual articles are variously dutiable, and rates may be
obtained from U.S. Customs Offices.
   You must have valid prescriptions for any drugs or drug
paraphernalia you're carrying; firearms and ammunition require
special permits.
   Additional restrictions apply to foodstuffs: uncured cheeses,
fresh or prepared meats, poultry and fish not hermetically sealed,
fresh vegetables and fruit. Rooted plants, seeds or cuttings are
not allowed.
   Products made from endangered species - the lengthy list covers
tortoises, spotted cats, rare birds, elephants, whales, most
monkeys, alligators and crocodiles, many snakes and lizards - are
prohibited, as are ceramic tableware with lead-based glazes,
automobiles that don't meet EPA standards and pre-Columbian or
other artifacts unless you've got permits from countries of origin.
   Surprisingly, the law allows travelers to import - in limited
quantity and for personal use only - copies of many trademarked
articles, including famous-maker watches, perfumes, clothing,
leather items, cameras and electronic goods. Larger quantities of
these counterfeits are confiscated and importers fined or
imprisoned.
   Although not restricted, currency, checks or securities over
$10,000 must be reported on Customs Form 4790.
   When crossing borders, don't try to joke with Customs agents.
And whenever in doubt, declare!
   Contact the U.S. Customs Service, Department of the Treasury,
Washington, D.C., 20229 for more information or, before buying
merchandise abroad, call the nearest American embassy for advice.

   Shades of Phineas Fogg. A balloon trip over the Swiss Alps may
not put you in the same league as the famous Jules Verne character,
but it's a start.
   Two of the twelve Swiss Winter Alpine packages offered by Buddy
Bombard's Great Balloon Adventures in Europe will include the
annual Chateau d'Oex Winter Alpine Balloon Festival in January. The
Bombard balloons will be among the 50 from 15 countries which will
make daily flights in formation through the snow-covered valleys
and over the Alps near Gstaad.
   One of the Festival packages starts at Rougement, Switzerland,
with three days of long-distance flying in the mountains toward
Chateau d'Oex. Picnic luncheons and champagne are served while
floating over Alpine peaks. Four days are spent flying during
Festival events, including two days of mass ascensions and
competitions for precision flying. The other Festival package
reverses this itinerary, starting with the Festival in Chateau
d'Oex.
   Each balloon carries five passengers in airships designed for
12, so that camera equipment can be accommodated. ``The number and
quality of great photographic opportunities are remarkable. Guests
should plan to bring twice as much film as they would normally use
on a trip of this length,'' says Bombard.
   Packages include luxury accommodations and meals at different
Swiss restaurants each evening. The Festival packages cost about
$6,500 per person, while shorter six-day tours are about $4,000.
For information, call (800) 862-8537. -
   Not all is cold in Denmark during the winter.
   There are winter concerts for the first time this year at
Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens Concert Hall.
   Performances will be by the Italian Chamber Orchestra (Nov. 4);
pianist Andras Schiff and his wife, violinist Yuuko Shiokawa (Nov.
26), singer Inga Nielsen (Feb. 5); a Danish-Swedish musical evening
with recorder-player Michala Petra, violinist Soren Elbaek, oboist
Bjorn Carl Nielsen and trumpeter Haakan Hardenberger (Feb. 22); and
the Emerson String Quartet (March 18). Guest soloists are
Anne-Sophie Mutter, violist Bruno Giuranna, ad cellist Boris
Pergamenschiow.
   Top tickets are about $42. For reservations, call the Tivoli
Concert Hall ticket center in Copenhagen at (45-33) 15 10 12.
   ``The Lay of Thrym,'' an August Bournonville ballet about
ancient Nordic gods and the end of the world, opens the Royal
Danish Ballet's season at the Royal Theatre in Copenhagen. Other
ballets include the Hans Christian Andersen tale of ``Jack the
Dillard,'' a children's ballet by Lise La Cour; ``A Midsummer
Night's Dream,'' by John Neumier; and world premieres of two
ballets by American choreographers - ``New Ballet,'' by Laura Dean,
the postmodern dance specialist, and ``Caroline Mathilde,'' by
Flemming Flindt, artistic director of the Cleveland Ballet.
   Top price is about $35. Call (45-33) 14 10 02 for reservations.
   Another Copenhagen diversion is the ``Flowers for Every Rhyme
and Reason'' through Dec. 2 at the Museum of Decorative Art.
Flower-themed art and furnishings from the late middle ages to the
present include a Van Dyck self-portrait and examples from the 17th
century Rococo, early 20th century Art Nouveau and l960s flower
power periods. This is one of the shows being mounted by the museum
for the 1990-1991 season to celebrate its centennial. -
   ``Rajasthan: The Heart of India'' is the itinerary of a
Jan.14-Feb. 8 tour sponsored by the Institute of Asian Studies.
   Travelers will explore both countryside and cities in the trip
around this Indian state, visiting rural villages, medieval forts,
old temples, once-royal sanctuaries like the Taj Mahal, and the
cities of Bombay, Old and New Delhi. The Cattle Fair at Nagaur, the
Desert Festival near Jaisalmer and the town of Osian, where wild
peacocks nest around an 8th century temple, are on the itinerary.
Tour leader is Dr. Doranne Jacobson, who has lived in, written
about and photographed India. Cost is $4,516 per person, double
occupancy, of which $350 is a tax deductible contribution to the
institute. For more information, contact International Ventures and
Travel, Inc., in New York, 1 (800) 338-2624. -
   Hikers looking for a new challenge might consider the Kaapsche
Hoop Hiking Trail in the Berlin State Forest near Waterval-onder in
South Africa. This newly opened trail follows an old gold rush
route with old miners' huts, abandoned mines and diggings along the
way, as well as patches of indigenous high forest carpeted with
ferns, creepers and moss. The South African Tourism Board says the
trail, with two main routes and connecting paths, is adaptable for
different times (one to three days) and fitness levels. For more
information, contact the tourism board at 1 (800) TABLE MT. -

   Gambler Luke Short and Marshal ``Longhair'' Jim Courtright are
destined to face off at the White Elephant Saloon again Feb. 8,
through reenactment of the ``The Last Great Gunfight'' in the Fort
Worth Stockyards historic district.
   The 1887 duel, believed to be the last famous gunfight of the
old west, ended with the death of the marshal. Short was briefly
jailed and protected from a lynch mob by Bat Masterson; he later
was cleared. The parts will be played by local history buffs at the
Stockyards' White Elephant Saloon, named after the original.
   Historic district visitors may be able to witness the mayhem
after a ride on an 1896 steam engine, being restored for service
beginning early in 1991. The train will pick up passengers between
the Stockyards district and other points in Fort Worth.
   The district, once the center of the Texas cattle industry,
includes the Livestock Exchange Building and the Cowtown Coliseum,
site of the world's first indoor rodeo. -
   Cajun-Creole culture and the history of French Louisiana is
focus of Vermilionville, a re-created historic village attraction
at Lafayette.
   The settlement includes historic buildings - the Beau Bassin
House and Maison Buller - and re-creations like La Chapelle des
Attakapas, modeled after the first church built by Acadian settlers
in St. Martinville. Crafts, music and food recall the days in 1755
and after when the French-speaking Acadians (or ``Cajuns''), from
Nova Scotia, and Creoles, descended from African, West Indian and
European pioneers, settled the bayous and prairies of south
Louisiana.
   Food of the two cultures is represented with dishes like
beignets, gumbo, red beans and rice, available at outdoor food
stalls, and ``down home'' meals at La Cuisine de Maman,
Vermilionville's restaurant. Cajun and Creole chefs also offer tips
with daily demonstrations at the Cooking School. -
   Rural farm history of the Shenendoah Valley is recalled at the
Museum of American Frontier Culture at Staunton, Va.
   Three farms represent cultures of early settlers of the region
with farm buildings reconstructed from abroad: Black-timbered,
wattle-and daub 18th century farm buildings from Hordt, in
Germany's Rhineland-Palatinate region; a 17th century English farm
featuring timber-framed barns with thatched roofs from Northchapel
Parish, near Petworth, West Sussex; and a 19th century Scotch-Irish
farm, with white-washed sandstone and thatched roofs, from near
Drumquin, County Tyrone, in Northern Ireland. A fourth farm is a
typical 19th century Appalachian farm, featuring log farmhouse and
outbuildings, from near Eagle Rock, Va.
   The farms produce livestock and crops as they would have in the
18th and 19th centuries, and costumed staff members demonstrate
activities like planting, livestock care and domestic crafts. -
   Between November and April each year, 15,000 to 20,000 gray
whales pass the Monterey Bay Aquarium in Monterey, Calif., on their
way from Alaska to Baja California and back.
   The aquarium has outdoor decks three stories high, with guides
to help visitors spot the whales. It also sponsors whale-watching
boat trips during January, the peak of the migration season.
   A shark exhibition, with live sharks, opens at the aquarium Jan.
13. ``They are a remarkable group of animals that have survived on
this planet for hundreds of millions of years,'' says Julie
Packard, the aquarium's executive director. ``And now, in part
because of our fears, we may be fishing many of them to the brink
of extinction.'' -

   All that poet John Masefield asked for his tall ship was ``a
star to steer her by.''
   World travelers these days need more than a star; they need
guidelines on where to go, what to see, where to stay, where to
eat. There are plenty of specialized publishers willing to provide
direction.
   Some, far from all, of the newer travel guidebooks:
   Fodor's ``London Companion,'' by Louise Nicholson, a revised and
updated version originally published as ``London: Louise
Nicholson's Definitive Guide.'' Walking tours, shopping and dining
advice and ``how to stay dry and have fun on rain-drenched days'' -
including ``shop for the anti-rain kit'' and spend the day at the
British Museum.
   Fodor's guide of ``Europe's Great Cities,'' keyed to 1990, is a
basic look at 20 cities, from Amsterdam to Zurich. In addition to
specific information on the cities, it lists government tourist
offices for each of the countries, as well as some tour groups and
package deals for independent travelers.
   The travel company also has published ``Great Britain: England,
Scotland and Wales'' and specific guides for Maui and Washington,
D.C.
   Fodor's new ``The Himalayan Countries'' offers information on
planning the trip (``what to pack,'' ``passports and visas'') and
getting there as well as specifics on the countries: Bhutan, Nepal,
North India, North Pakistan, Tibet.
   Chronicle Books published the fifth edition of guides to less
expensive places, ``Cheap Sleeps in Paris'' (not the cheapest, but
the best values for a variety of tastes, and in which ones is
English spoken) and ``Cheap Eats in Paris'' (125 cafes, bistros,
brasseries and restaurants), both by Sandra A. Gustafson. The
author notes that ``no hotel can purchase a listing or ask to be
included'' in her ``Sleeps'' guide.
   Handy ``city travel kits'' from Doubleday include ``Seven Days
in London'' and ``Seven Days in Paris,'' and ``Four Days in
Venice,'' illustrated guides to the major sights, with pull-out
maps.
   Perhaps the best guides to Ireland come from the Irish Tourist
Board, which offers a booklet of ``approved'' guest accommodations
(bed-and-breakfasts listed by region) and a similar guide to hotels
and guest houses.
   Bantam's ``France: 1990,'' broken down by regions, including
Paris itself, Normandy, Brittany and the North, the Alps, the
Mediterranean. Appropriate maps accompany each section, which
emphasize the sights.
   A similar guide to Canada 1990 joins the Bantam series, which
includes Spain, Australia, Great Britain, Hawaii, Italy and Mexico.
   Bantam had added San Francisco, Hong Kong and Paris to its city
guides series, which includes London and New York.
   The City by the Bay, apparently still among the favorites in the
nation, is also the subject of a revised ``The Best of San
Francisco'' (Chronicle) by Don and Betty Martin.
   More thematic travel guides recently published include:
   - Pamela Lanier's revised edition of ``Condo Vacations,'' a
listing of vacation condominiums in the United States, Hawaii and
the Caribbean.
   - Eleanor Berman's ``Traveling on Your Own,'' ideas for group
and solo vacations.
   - Rand McNally's magazine-format ``Getaway Guide: Great
Escapes,'' which includes special events across the nation, city
vacations, wilderness explorations and scenic drives, along with
road maps.
   - Arthur Frommer's third annual ``New World of Travel'' on
alternative vacations.
   - ``Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You
Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over 50,'' by Joan Rattner
Heilman (Contemporary) is in its third edition, revised with new
information about to make your age - if you're past 50 - pay off in
travel.

   What's new - and news - in hotels:
   - A Consumer Reports survey of more than 100,000 readers rated
42 hotel chains based on the level of satisfaction they experienced
during their visits. By one count, the magazine noted, there are
now 190 national or regional hotel chains, 60 of them less than
five years old.
   Hampton Inn scored highest among economy hotels; Best Western
among the moderate hotels; Residence Inn in the high-priced
category; and Four Seasons among luxury hotels.
   Biggest complaint overall was about the quality of hotel food
(47 percent were less than ``very satisfied''), followed by climate
control (35 percent).
   The category of economy hotels included those whose rates were
up to $40 a night; moderate, $40-$56; high-priced, $63-$94; luxury
$91-$139.

15-month refurbishing. Work included preservation of the suites
decorated by theatrical designer Oliver Messel in the 1950s.

   The study was sponsored by Courtyard by Marriott, which says it
wants to learn more about women business travelers, who are

   Tourism officials hope a train ride
following the route of Glenn Miller's ``Chattanooga Choo-Choo''
will boost recognition for the city that inspired the tune.
   The Chattanooga Convention and Visitors Bureau is planning a
special rail excursion from New York to Chattanooga next September
on what will be the song's 50th anniversary.
   Bureau officials plan to use the 18-car train to bring about 400
convention planners, travel writers, tour operators and business
executives to Chattanooga.
   If all goes as planned, the train will arrive in Chattanooga in
time for the city's annual Choo-Choo festival.
   Harry Warren and Mack Gordon wrote the song ``Chattanooga
Choo-Choo,'' about a fictional New York-to-Chattanooga rail route.
It made its debut in the 1941 movie ``Sun Valley Serenade'' and won
a gold record for Miller.

<HEAD>Alzheimer's Association Is Beacon of Hope for Victims, Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If it is better to light one candle than to curse
the darkness, the volunteer founders of the Alzheimer's Association
have set a beacon they hope will guide others through a potential
public-health nightmare.
   One in 62 Americans - 4 million people - already has Alzheimer's
disease, a debilitating, incurable brain affliction that robs
victims of their memories, their capacity to care for themselves
and - over an agonizing period of years - their lives.
   One in 22 Americans - 15 million people - could have the disease
within half a century, researchers predict, increasing the already
enormous emotional and economic toll on families thrust into the
grueling gauntlet of caregiving detailed in the book ``The 36-Hour
Day.''
   ``It's a lingering, lingering death,'' said Jerome H. Stone, a
wealthy Chicago businessman who watched his attractive, intelligent
wife deteriorate into something ``subhuman'' after she was
diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 1970.
   ``As one of my friends described it, it's a funeral that never
ends,'' said Stone, who turned his helpless frustration over his
wife's 14-year decline to death into the founding passion behind
the Alzheimer's Association.
   This year, the Chicago-based organization is celebrating its
10th anniversary, and it is regarded as a model for volunteer
groups, said Dr. Gene D. Cohen, deputy director of the National
Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md.
   ``They're really looked at as one of the truly exemplary family
associations,'' Cohen said. ``They've been very, very effective in
raising visibility in an area that has been so misunderstood for
such a long period of time.''
   Since it was founded in 1980, the organization has increased
from seven initial groups to 210 chapters in 49 states. Its
national budget has grown from $78,000 to $18.4 million, staffers
said.
   Though it began and still relies mostly on volunteers, it has
more than 100 paid workers at its headquarters and its Washington,
D.C., office. Many chapters have their own offices and staffs.
   The association is proud of its effectiveness in lobbying and
advocacy:
   - Alzheimer's disease is recognized by the public and by
officials as a major public-health problem. Since 1985, it has been
the theme of made-for-TV movies, television news documentaries,
news magazine cover stories and, most recently, an award-winning
country and western song.
   - Federal research funds have increased from $4 million a year
to $150 million, including support for 15 research centers.
   - Thirty-three states have created task forces to study
Alzheimer's-related problems; 119 state programs exist, financed at
$25 million annually, providing services ranging from respite care
for families, to day care for victims, to training for care givers.
   Stone ``haunted the medical establishments'' after his wife's
diagnosis in 1970 in a vain search for information on Alzheimer's
disease. He found only wisps of data, even though 64 years had
passed since German neurologist Alois Alzheimer identified the
disease, documenting its characteristic nerve-fiber tangles in the
brain of a demented woman.
   Stone searched out seven disparate family support groups for
people with various brain diseases and persuaded them to form the
Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association.
   He agreed to be the group's first chairman, inviting charter
members to Chicago as his guests for meetings. And he took over
most of the initial fundraising.
   About a month after the association's one-person office opened
in New York in autumn 1980, an inquirer to ``Dear Abby'' asked for
information about Alzheimer's disease. Abby inquired at the
National Institutes of Health and was given the address of the
association's little New York office.
   Within four days of its printing, the office received 25,000
pieces of mail, according to the association.
   ``We immediately knew all the statistics doctors were giving us
were wrong, that there were Alzheimer's patients all over the
country,'' Stone said. ``There was a hunger for information.''
   Families needed strategies to cope with victims' forgetfulness,
tendency to wander away, exaggerated personality traits and
eventual incapacitation and unresponsiveness.
   And they needed a network of other families with whom they could
share the ordeal of watching a loved one slowly die of
complications from bed sores, feeding problems or pneumonia, the
typical causes of death in Alzheimer's.
   That network is strong today, through the 1,600 support groups
the Alzheimer's Association sponsors via local chapters engaging
more than 35,000 volunteers.
   Jane Campbell, 34, a Chicago restaurant manager whose mother was
diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease last year, says she has
benefited greatly from such a group - its compassion, reassurance
and experience.
   ``My first meeting, all I could do was cry and tell them how
scared I was and how awful it felt. It's so bewildering to have
someone you know not remember where they are, who they are and who
their children are,'' she said.
   ``People said, `You're in the right place,' '' and she returned
for more group meetings, Ms. Campbell said.
   Much of the group's focus is on problem solving, she said, ``how
to feed someone who doesn't want to eat, how to get them to
exercise . . . how to keep loving someone who has this disease.''
   Hilda Pridgeon, whose husband was diagnosed with Alzheimer's
disease in 1974, when he was only 47, had none of the benefits of
such an organization, but managed to find the wife of another
victim, and then a few other victims' wives in Minneapolis.
   ``We needed to talk to each other so we wouldn't all go down the
same dead-end streets looking for help,'' said Mrs. Pridgeon.
   She later took a leave from her job at Data Control Corp. to
become a founding leader of the association. Though her husband
died in 1988, the 64-year-old Mrs. Pridgeon remains heavily
involved.
   ``Jerry Stone certainly was the glue that held us together and
got us on the right track in many ways,'' she said. ``But there was
real core of dedicated people.''
   Not all were present at the organization's beginning.
   Princess Yasmin Aga Khan Jeffries, the daughter of perhaps the
most famous Alzheimer's disease victim - Rita Hayworth - got
involved in the early 1980s. She has since helped raise an
estimated $5 million through annual galas in her mother's name
beginning in 1984.
   ``I watched my mother suffer. I suffered. Others suffered. I'm
committed to it,'' Mrs. Jeffries said from New York.
   Ms. Hayworth died in 1987. This year's $1,000-a-plate galas are
scheduled for Oct. 26 in Chicago and Nov. 1 in New York.
   For Stone, the successes are sweet.
   ``One thing I'm very proud of - I think in 10 years we've
learned, and taught people, how to cope,'' he said.
   But the successes are not enough, he said. Not when care for
U.S. Alzheimer's victims is costing an estimated $88 billion a
year, and the government is spending only $150 million on research
- less than 0.2 percent of the cost of care - to find a cause and
cure.
   ``From my business sense that's not a very good ratio,'' Stone
said.

<HEAD>As Scooters Increase, So Does Scrutiny</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE OWEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VALLEY FORGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Thompson can't walk much anymore.
   She is only 49, but has lung disease and uses an electric
scooter to go shopping and take her treasured neighborhood walks,
all the time hooked up to an oxygen tank.
   ``I had a real intimidation about using'' the three-wheeled
scooter, Mrs. Thompson. ``What will they think? What will they
say?''
   ``They,'' she said, was ``everyone around me - that silly notion
that everybody's looking.''
   That's not a problem anymore, and as using scooters becomes more
acceptable to older people and those with disabilities, the
question will increasingly focus on a consumer issue: which one to
buy.
   On a bright, clear, cool morning, 16 people set out on scooters
along the six-mile bicycle and walking path at Valley Forge
National Historical Park to help find that answer.
   Only one scooter broke down, about two miles into the tour past
monuments and small log cabins that mark where Washington's troops
holed up for the winter of 1776.
   ECRI, a non-profit evaluator of healthcare technology originally
called Emergency Care Resource Institute, is trying to help others
do what Mrs. Thompson had to do herself.
   The models tested by ECRI show what consumers face when choosing
a scooter. Some had three wheels, some four; some had two
batteries, some one; some can turn more easily in tight spots; one
had large wheels and thus better suited to outdoor use. Some have
cloth seats, some vinyl, which can be important to someone with
incontinence.
   Mrs. Thompson last year tried out five scooters, without the
information ECRI hopes to provide.
   ``Especially after sharing it with so many people at the beach
this summer, I think it's important that people have the
information on what it can do for them,'' said Mrs. Thompson, of
nearby Plymouth Meeting.
   ``For me personally, I wanted to be able to use it in the house.
I wanted to be able to use it in small spaces. And I wanted to be
able to assemble and disassemble it myself.''
   ``Mine takes me around my neighborhood real nicely - stop and
visit the dogs and the kids. The other thing is braking, how it'll
handle a hill, its maneuverability, whether it'll tip.''
   Those are exactly the kinds of concerns ECRI investigated with
the financial help of the National Institute of Disability Research
and Rehabilitation, the U.S. Department of Education and the
National Rehabilitation Hospital.
   The engineers and other ECRI employees at Valley Forge rated
scooters for comfort, hill-climbing, braking, stability of the
ride, driver fatigue, speed control and battery power. The outdoor
test is part of the testing from which ECRI expects to release
results around next June.
   Mrs. Thompson said her scooter will tip, but that if she gets in
a tricky spot she can get a foot out to brace herself. Many people
who use such vehicles - such as stroke patients with some paralysis
- aren't so fortunate, said Kenneth Brown of ECRI.
   ``You don't have an arm to brace yourself. You just kind of go
over in it,'' said Brown, who leaned to one side on two wheels to
demonstrate.
   Sharon Lawler, a marketing specialist for ECRI who rode one of
the scooters, said ECRI has no ties to manufacturers. ``That way
people can be sure that our data is at least objective.''
   Her scooter made it, but Rob Schluth's didn't have the power to
handle the hills at the park. That won't ruin its evaluation,
ECRI's Brown said. It will simply put it in perspective of what is
determined in other tests that may make it good for indoor use.
   ``If the unit is acceptable, it would be conditionally
acceptable, that you don't take it out on rough terrain,'' he said.
   Having 15 finishers impressed Brown. ``I didn't expect this many
to do this well. A lot of these models were indoor models and they
handled the park very well,'' he said.
   Scooter prices range from $1,500 to $3,500, Brown said.
Generally, insurance has not helped pay the bill, he said.
   Pat Suda, national sales director for scooter manufacturer
Ortho-Kinetics of Waukesha, Wis., said Medicare rarely reimburses
for the scooters. She said the company is telling distributors,
``Be prepared to ask for cash, don't ask what their insurance is.''
   She agrees with ECRI that projections of the aging of the U.S.
population promises growth in the scooter market. Al Thieme has
seen the growth firsthand. Thieme made his first scooter 22 years
ago for his wife, who suffered multiple sclerosis. Now he has a $9
million business as president of Amigo, a Bridgeport, Mich.-based
manufacturer of scooters.
   ``Today there's a lot of competition. There are probably 20
different manufacturers in the United States and I would say 20 to
25 manufacturers in other countries,'' Thieme said.

<HEAD>`I Don't Feel It,' Oldest U.S. Veteran Says at 104</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY JAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nathan Cook lied to get into the Navy and has
never regretted it in the 89 years since. The Navy led him to his
wife, took him around the world and enabled him to become the
country's oldest veteran.
   He's 104, but, he says, ``I don't feel it.''
   Cook, who enlisted shortly after the Spanish-American War and
served in both world wars, became the nation's oldest living
veteran July 26, when George Echols died in Washington, D.C., at
105.
   He sat quietly Aug. 26 while representatives of Post 12 and the
Western District of the American Veterans Association swore him in
and presented him with a certificate of merit.
   Cook's 78-year-old daughter, Eleanor E. Kay of Tempe, held his
hand as she read the oath of the association for her father.
   ``I know in the back of his mind, although he can't hear, he
knows what's going on,'' Ms. Kay said. ``I know he'll tell me about
it later.''
   Cook said he was 15 when he joined the Navy in 1901. He told
recruiters he was the minimum age required - 17. He had been lured
by posters promising worldwide travel.
   And the Navy complied - it sent him around the world four times,
he said.
   Cook became a lieutenant and stayed in the Navy for 44 years -
he said he's never wanted to do anything else.
   ``There's few places I haven't been,'' he said with a smile in a
recent interview during which he responded to written questions
since he can't hear.
   In 1907, Cook went on the USS Kansas on an around-the-world
cruise. He survived a strange fever attack in Manila, the
Philippines. He also survived an acute appendicitis attack in
Gibraltar that led doctors to pack him in ice and ship him back to
the states for surgery.
   Cook said he also was involved with the aftermath of China's
Boxer Rebellion, the Pancho Villa Mexican border skirmish in
1916-17 and World Wars I and II. He was only three years late for
the Spanish-American war in 1898.
   He retired in 1946 and moved to Tempe, a suburb of Phoenix, in
1960.
   He entered the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Phoenix after
his wife, Elizabeth, died in 1982.
   While he was at sea, Elizabeth took care of the family, Cook
said. ``She did a good job of it, too.''
   He met her at a Navy ball in New York's Tammany Hall in 1901, he
said. They were married four years later, and Cook has four
children, eight grandchildren, 11 great-grandchildren and three
great-great-grandchildren.
   Born Oct. 10, 1885, and a Mormon since he was 8, Cook attributes
his long life to his church's prohibition of drinking and smoking.
   Appearing to drink, however, was necessary if he were to fit in
with his shipmates, he sid, so he tricked them by ordering a
``Seven and tonic,'' a non-alcoholic drink served in a whiskey
glass. Another was to carry tea in his flask.
   Of course, he was eventually found out, but not until he already
had proved himself, Cook said.

<HEAD>32 Years Later, Artist Returns to Tiffany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. KIRK SEMPLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When 28-year-old artist Jack Frankfurter left
his first professional art job, designing silver at Tiffany &amp; Co.,
he took off for Rome with every intention of returning after a
year's study.
   A year turned into decades, and when Frankfurter finally came
back, it was as an artist with five oil triptychs installed in the
fabled store's Fifth Avenue windows - not as a silver designer.
   ``It's closing a circle, in a way,'' he said.
   For Frankfurter, 61, the Tiffany paintings represent more than a
return to the place where he began his professional art career.
They also represent a symbolic return to his childhood and a 20th
century America he left long ago for the classical attractions of
Italy.
   Born in Austria in 1929, Frankfurter moved to New York with his
family at the outbreak of World War II. He studied fine arts and
literature at Columbia University and Cooper Union, and briefly
taught college English.
   He joined Tiffany, though he had no experience designing silver.
He created coffee pots and teapots, ashtrays, clocks and hurricane
lamps.
   His designs, he said, were generally modern but usually echoed
classical designs. His interest in the art of antiquity led him
toward Italy.
   In 1957, Frankfurter secured a grant to attend the University of
Rome for a year. Tiffany asked him to return to their studios
afterward, but those plans were shattered within his first few
months in Rome.
   ``I was taken by the fact that it was absolutely beautiful,'' he
said. ``It became obvious to me that this is what I wanted to paint
all along.''
   Through the '60s and '70s, Frankfurter was a success: exhibits
throughout Italy and in London, New York, Munich and Los Angeles;
works in museums and the private collections of Malcolm Forbes,
Gore Vidal and Frederico Fellini; designs for theater productions
in several European cities.
   The last decade, by his own admission, was not his most
productive. But Frankfurter sees his Tiffany show in May - the
first exhibit of his work in the United States since 1976 - as the
start of a new period in his career.
   ``I found that while living in Rome, I'd lost contact with
America,'' he said. During the last decade, though, he began to use
his art to explore American themes - in particular, the America of
his childhood.
   ``As far as my art was concerned, and as far as my outlook was
concerned, I had many more roots in America,'' he said. ``Even
after 32 years in Italy, I think I'll always be a foreigner
there.''
   Although he often feels like ``a fish out of water'' when he
returns to the United States, he remains profoundly attracted to
this country. His recent works reflect that conflict; they are
crowded with nostalgic symbols of American cultural life laced with
cynicism and irony.
   In one triptych, ``By The Sea,'' a collage of images includes
carousel horses, family album snapshots, a toy sailboat, an ice
cream cone and a hot dog, all painted with oil in a style that
gives it a windblown and weathered look, as if the triptych - and
the memories - were left out in the salt air for a half-century.
   Another painting, ``Dream Vending Machine,'' depicts a
coin-operated machine in the shape of a movie marquee. The inside
is littered with cultural icons of wealth and prestige: a cruise
ship, a Daimler, a wedding in Paris and champagne. But the glass of
the machine is cracked, and plastered on it is a sign that reads
``out of order.''
   ``They're not optimistic; I don't have that great optimism,'' he
said.
   ``I played with my early memories of America,'' he said.
``Whether I enjoyed it or not, it's what I look back on.''
   Frankfurter is not certain whether he could return permanently
to the United States, but is sure about his work.
   ``I have more desire to work now and more endurance at it than
years ago when I would gladly put down my brushes early at the end
of the day to go out with my friends,'' he said. ``Now I happily .
. . work until midnight because I'm enjoying what I'm doing.''

<HEAD>New Project Unites Inner-City Elderly, Youth</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Terrence Page and Maryon Freifelder have been an
unlikely pair of friends for three years, teaming up on issues of
interest to young and old.
   Page is a senior at Miami Central High School; Freifelder is an
activist with the American Association of Retired Persons and a
member of Florida's Silver-Haired Legislature.
   Together, they have traveled across the state on campaigns for
new laws. Now they are teaming up again to promote a new
crime-prevention project linking the two generations.
   ``We sincerely believe that youth and age - if we're willing to
walk hand in hand - can solve any problem in this community,''
Freifelder said.
   The program called Youth and Elderly Against Crime was kicked
off recently with a pep rally organized by Dade County schools,
Citizens Crime Watch, Jewish Family Services' crime prevention
group, and Freifelder and Page's Intergenerational Law Advocacy
Group.
   Of the 79,000 crimes committed in Miami last year, only
two-tenths of 1 percent involved seniors. But crimes against the
elderly create a sense of outrage, and opened the door for the
program.
   About 150 students from three inner-city high schools will be
linked with two senior housing complexes, a senior community center
and a downtown church to survey seniors about crime and suggest
solutions.
   One of the program's biggest achievements would be to eliminate
a widely expressed fear among the elderly of teen-agers - all
teen-agers.
   ``Whole generations, especially those living in the inner city,
have expressed nothing but fear,'' said Vern Thornton, director of
the state attorney general's Seniors Vs. Crime Project. ``This fear
leads to the elderly community imprisoning themselves at home.''
   Page has felt the unwillingness of seniors to accept teen-age
strangers, but he considers that a minor setback.
   ``One of the reasons why there's resistance is a lot of time
it's hard for people to believe that somebody cares,'' the
18-year-old said.
   But he sees the generation gap as a misunderstanding that can be
resolved.
   In the first stage of the one-year project, teen-agers will be
matched with a designated group of seniors in their neighborhoods
to meet regularly and draft crime-prevention plans.
   Other Miami programs already focus on crimes against the elderly
and linking old and young, but this extends the existing projects.
   Christell Porter, who arranges crime-prevention meetings for
Jewish Family Services, organized about 35 residents of the Mildred
and Claude Pepper Towers to attend the kickoff rally.
   Her group already offers dead-bolt locks, peepholes and
heavy-duty metal screening for windows.
   Dade County public schools offer Adopt-a-Grandparent and Senior
Mentors for Creative Student programs to capitalize on the assets
of each generation.
   ``We have the two extremes. We have the young who are somewhat
unaware of the problems associated with being old. Second, we have
the old, octogenarians worried about their ability to protect
themselves against crime,'' said Police Chief Perry Anderson. ``I
think they'll be looking out for each other.''

<HEAD>Test Your Knowledge About Homeowner's Insurance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's the home-buying season, and in addition to
buying your new home, you need to consider another important
purchase - homeowners insurance.
   To find out how knowledgeable you are about homeowners
insurance, the Denver-based College for Financial Planning has
prepared the following quiz.
   Choose one answer for each question.
   1. Homeowners insurance must be purchased a) before you move
into your new house, b) at the time of closing, c) within one year
of moving into your new house.
   2. If you would like your home fully rebuilt after a total loss,
it should be insured up to what percentage of its replacement
value. a) 60, b) 80, c) 100.
   3. Most homeowners policies (those without an extra premium) pay
to replace personal property a) at the value determined after
adjusting for depreciation, b) up to 50 percent of its value, c)
fully.
   4. To insure paintings and antiques a) you need no additional
coverage because your basic homeowners policy covers them fully, b)
you need a floater (policy endorsement), c) you need a commercial
policy.
   5. Insurance against flood and earthquake damage always is part
of the standard homeowners policy. a) True b) False
   6. The average cost of a homeowners policy for a $100,000 house
at 80 percent replacement value is a) $250 a year, b) $350 a year,
c) $450 a year.
   7. Unless you pay to increase the limit, most policies typically
insure your belongings, such as furniture and clothing, for what
percentage of the replacement value you carry on your house. a) 35,
b) 50, c) 75.
   8. Unless you pay to increase the limit, a typical policy
provides how much personal liability insurance for you and your
household. a) $25,000, b) $50,000, c) $100,000.
   9. If you must evacuate your home because it is being rebuilt
after a fire or natural disaster, a typical policy generally pays
additional living expenses up to what percentage of your home's
coverage. a) 5, b) 10, c) 25.
   10. A deductible is a) the amount of a loss you must pay before
the insurance coverage begins, b) when your premium is
automatically withdrawn from your account, c) the amount the
insurance company pays toward the loss.
   ---
   Answers: 1. b; 2. c; 3. a; 4. b; 5. b; 6. c; 7. b; 8. c; 9. b;
10. a.
   ---
   Insurance to protect your home is complicated enough to warrant
a yearly review; however, homeowners protection is not so
complicated as to be an excuse for not having the right coverage.
   Whether you are buying a new home or have determined you need
additional coverage on an existing policy, you should consult with
your insurance agent to guarantee that you have the appropriate
coverage.

<HEAD>Winter Is a Great Time for Gardening</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE BRIA</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the air gets nippy, people ask me
if I've put the garden to bed. Never. The cows that watched me
weeding the corn in July see me in snowboots and earflaps in
December picking Brussels sprouts for Christmas dinner.
   Some of the tastiest and most nutritious crops thrive in autumn
and are still good in winter.
   The year-round gardener looks forward to chilly nights to put
flavor into parsnips and sprouts. He or she makes room in the
vegetable patch for other hardy crops like late broccoli, Chinese
cabbage, kale, collards, beets, leeks, carrots, turnips, spinach,
Swiss chard and other greens.
   Scientists say cool weather affects the metabolism of some
plants, promoting sugar buildups and concealing less attractive
flavors. When frost is killing tender crops like tomatoes and
beans, hardy vegetables are just reaching their prime.
   One of the best of these crops is Brussels sprouts, some of us
think. Long a favorite in Europe, sprouts are strangely missing
from most American gardens. The National Gardening Association
estimates only one gardener in 10 grows them.
   ``Perhaps too few gardeners have picked fresh, frost-sweetened
sprouts in late fall, cooked them just to the fork-tender stage and
served them with melted butter,'' the association says in its
gardening guide.
   Some gardeners may have fumbled by planting sprouts too soon or
too late. In my garden, 50 miles north of New York City, the best
time is October, coinciding with the first frosts.
   If planted in early spring, they mature in midsummer with
inferior taste. If planted too late, the plants don't grow enough.
You have to experiment in your own climate, and especially with
conditions in your own garden, to get it right.
   Parsnips, one of the sweetest of vegetables, are also curiously
absent from many gardens. Perhaps a yen for instant gratification
turns some of us away, for parsnips require waiting - and
attention.
   Planted in early spring, the edible root doesn't start
sweetening until the autumn chill - a waiting time of six months
and more. Some growers think they don't reach their best until they
have wintered over - almost a year after sowing.
   Like carrots, parsnips are difficult to germinate. After
numerous failures outdoors, I resorted to sowing them indoors in
flats under lights where I could keep them both warm and damp. This
worked, giving me nice seedlings to transplant in May.
   Because parsnips are a deep-thrusting root plant, the soil must
be worked carefully to remove stones. I use an iron bar to punch
deep holes, which I fill with compost, and plant the seedlings in
those. After these initial efforts, the plants need occasional
watering, but that's about all.
   I start digging up my parsnips after a few hard frosts, using a
trowel or spading fork. To protect them from the bitterest cold,
mulch them with leaves or hay and then harvest them as you desire
all winter long and into early spring. In the South, they may be
dug a few at a time and stored in the refrigerator, where the cold
will sweeten them.
   Broccoli, nice-tasting all summer, acquires an extra tang in
autumn. This vegetable is an ideal garden crop in my area, for a
single planting in early spring will yield large heads in summer
and then florets deep into November.
   Breeders have also produced varieties, like Waltham and Green
Valiant, that are planted in midsummer to yield large central heads
in the fall.
   Romanesco, an Italian heirloom variety recently offered in U.S.
seed catalogs, produces a gorgeous chartreuse head. Broccoli,
especially eaten raw, ranks at the top of nutrition charts for its
vitamins and minerals.
   Also outstanding nutritionally, kale yields tasty greens in the
fall and winter. Its lacy leaves add a nice touch to the salad
bowl.
   Late lettuces with names like Arctic King and North Pole produce
deep into fall and early winter. Third harvests are prolonged in
coldframes or under transparent synthetic covers. Peas will yield a
fall crop, although not as abundant as in spring.
   Cut back to ground level in late fall and mulched deeply, Swiss
chard sends up fresh tender leaves in early spring. You cut these
for salads even as you're planting next season's crop. Truly, the
garden never sleeps.

<HEAD>Florida Doesn't Attract Retirees Like It Used To</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Florida's strength as a magnet for
retirees seeking sun, sand and palm trees may be diminishing.
   A recent University of Florida study of U.S. Census data shows
the numbers of elderly people moving to the Southeast dropped in
the first half of the 1980s compared with the 25 previous years.
   Stephen Golant, a university demographer who published the study
in July's Journal of Gerontology, predicts the drop will continue
through the 1990s for several reasons:
   - Fewer babies were born during the Depression, the age group
now beginning to turn 65.
   - The Northeast and Midwest provide more retirement
opportunities.
   - The recession of the early 1980s made it difficult for
Northern retirees to sell their homes and move.
   Also, Golant said, a youth movement seems to be stirring in
Florida, with a backlash against retirement communities.
   ``What's happening is that the glamour of having an older
population in one's community is, if anything, dampening rather
than increasing,'' Golant said.
   Communities once synonymous with retirement - Miami Beach and
St. Petersburg - have made efforts to attract younger people
because of the realization that retirees demand more services, he
said.

   U.S. District Judge A. David Mazzone ordered
Eastman Kodak Co. to pay Polaroid Corp. $909.5 million in damages
and interest for infringing on seven Polaroid patents.
   In his decision Friday, the judge said Kodak's infringement was
not willful and declined to award the $12 billion Polaroid had
sought in punitive damages.
   Kodak officials said the award would be paid out of its earnings
without any substantial impact on the company's finances. Polaroid
said it would review the decision before determining its next step
in the 14-year-old suit.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The U.S. Labor Department reported wholesale
prices soared 1.6 percent in September - an annual rate of more
than 20 percent - as gasoline prices shot up at their fastest pace
on record.
   While the Labor Department on Friday blamed much of the steep
increase in wholesale costs on costlier petroleum, prices excluding
the volatile energy and food areas were still up a worrisome 0.6
percent - twice the August gain.
   The 20.6 percent rise in the cost of gasoline was the highest
one-month increase since the government began tracking the
commodity in 1947.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Rebounding automobile purchases and surging
gasoline prices powered retail sales to a strong 1.1 percent gain
in September, the government said.
   The figures released Friday showed the biggest advance in four
months, but economists said the two special factors were masking an
otherwise weak report, which included a large decline in department
store sales.

   HOT SPRINGS, Va. (AP) - Top business leaders have predicted the
U.S. economy will stagnate during the second half of this year. A
minority say a recession is here or on the way.
   The Business Council's fall forecast projected a nearly
imperceptible 0.3 percent economic growth rate in the second half
of 1990, and said oil-driven inflation will climb to 6.1 percent
before falling back below current levels.
   The forecast was presented Friday to the 100 leaders of the
nation's top corporations at their semiannual, two-day meeting at
this mountain resort.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of The Wall Street
Journal, is freezing capital spending and salaries and imposing
other news and business cutbacks to cope with weak financial
results and the sluggish economy.
   The cuts, announced in an internal memo to managers Thursday,
followed weeks of rumors about a possible retrenchment and
triggered concern over possible future layoffs at the media and
financial industry giant.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Financial News Network, the 24-hour
business-oriented cable television service, said it fired a top
executive for improper financial dealings and dismissed its
auditors.
   The company said two other employees in the accounting staff
were put on leave while FNN reviews their ``status.''
   Chief Financial Officer C. Steven Bolen, 44, was dismissed
following a board investigation that concluded he ``received
compensation payments that were not properly authorized and . . .
that certain bank accounts administered under (his) direction were
not properly recorded.''

   BEIJING (AP) - In one of its few economic reforms this year,
China has opened a national wheat market to replace central
allocation of the nation's 85 million ton annual wheat harvest.
   More than 200 grain trading companies were to begin dealing on
opening day Friday at the Wholesale Grain Market in Zhengzhou, the
provincial capital of Henan, China's wheat heartland, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported.
   The market is one of China's few experiments in using markets to
replace four decades of central planning.

<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc., which has taken a
battering on Wall Street as it contends with a computer industry
slowdown, is betting its bottom line on three new, lower-priced
Macintoshes it will introduce Monday.
   Analysts are divided over whether Apple's effort to gain market
share at the expense of profit margins will revitalize the company
or cut into earnings.
   Investors, so far, appear to be wary - Apple's stock price has
plummeted from a high of $50 a share during the past year to a low
of $25.50 last week before closing Friday at $28.25.
   ``Apple's overall unit shipments have declined and you can make
a very strong case that the markets Apple is trying to enter now
are much more closed than they used to be,'' said Douglas Kass, an
analyst at Dataquest Inc., a San Jose-based research firm. ``They
missed the window of opportunity in the lower end a year and a half
ago.''
   Kass said the new machines will produce a ``pretty rapid spike
in sales'' and will strengthen Apple's mid-range offerings. But, he
added, ``I don't think the low end will generate that much to make
it a big deal.''
   Others are more optimistic.
   ``People forget what happens when you introduce a very
inexpensive version of a product that a lot of people want,'' said
Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter in
San Francisco. ``Apple's volume is going to go through the roof. I
may be out in left field in this, but I think this totally reverses
their fortunes.''
   Apple, stagnating with a 9 percent share of the $67 billion
personal computer market - down from a peak of 14 percent in 1987 -
is launching its new machines with a $40 million television and
print advertising campaign.
   The company is cranking up production of the computers to the
limit, anticipating strong demand as it introduces the machines
simultaneously in 121 countries.
   Most of the company's dealers already have been given previews
of the computers and, despite a reluctance by Apple executives to
provide details before Monday, there aren't many secrets.
   The Mac Classic, a compact desktop computer based on the
Motorola 68000 microprocessor with a built-in black-and-white
monitor, will be priced at about $1,000 with a floppy-disk drive
and $1,500 with a 40-megabyte hard disk drive.
   The list prices are less than half those of the comparable and
very popular Macintosh Plus and SE models, and street prices are
expected to be several hundred dollars lower.
   The Macintosh LC, based on the more powerful Motorola 68020
microprocessor and listed at $2,400 with a 40-megabyte hard disk,
and the Macintosh SI, based on the still more powerful Motorola
68030 and priced $3,800 to $4,500 with an 80-megabyte hard disk,
are several thousand dollars cheaper than existing models. Both
will have separately available 12-inch monitors - black-and-white
for $300 or color for $600.
   Most analysts predict the LC, Apple's first low-cost color
model, eventually will be the hottest seller of the new machines.
But it won't be ready in volume until January, costing Apple the
key Christmas sales season.
   The computers won't be as cheap as the least expensive clones of
International Business Machines Corp. personal computers. But the
new Macs will be competitive with IBM clones equipped to use
Windows 3.0, the software from Microsoft Corp. that gives
IBM-compatible machines the ``look and feel'' of Macintoshes.
   Apple chairman and chief executive officer, John Sculley,
acknowledges the risks in introducing new products with lower
profit margins, but he said he thinks the timing is right with a
recession looming and industry sales bumping along sluggishly.
   Until the introduction of Windows 3.0 in May, Apple's
Macintoshes, because of their unique, easy-to-use design, allowed
the company to keep prices high and attain more than 50 percent
gross profit margins.
   ``The strategy Apple has been pursuing in the late 1980s is one
which made us the third most profitable computer company in the
world,'' Sculley said at a recent briefing with reporters. ``It was
a pretty good one when we had high industry growth, when there
wasn't anyone who had technology that looked anything like ours,
and when we were trying to reposition Apple from a toy company to a
serious computer company.
   ``It's quite clear that with the industry slowing down, with
more competition out there, that Apple, if it is going to be a
significant player in the 1990s, has to go for market share and get
very aggressive,'' he said.
   Sculley said he believes investors will support the strategy
``as long as the products are well received by the market ... and
the efforts lead to higher market share.''
   With the Christmas buying season beginning, it shouldn't take
long for investors to find out if Apple's plan is correct. The big
question facing Apple and every desktop computer maker, though, is
whether the weak economy will scuttle sales for everyone.

<HEAD>Recession? Business Leaders Can't Agree</HEAD>

   Business leaders can't agree on whether
the U.S. economy is headed for a recession.
   ``I guess I would align myself with those who believe we are in
or are entering a recession,'' said Willard C. Butcher, chairman of
Chase Manhattan Bank.
   But while John S. Reed, chairman of Citicorp, describes it as a
``difficult period,'' he says he's ``not ready to throw in the
sponge.''
   And David T. Kerns, chairman of the Xerox Corp., says he doesn't
``have the slightest idea'' whether the United States is in a
recession.
   There were other topics discussed at the Business Council's
weekend meeting at this mountain resort - the Persian Gulf crisis,
the federal budget deficit and the baseball playoffs - but
recession took center stage.
   The council's semiannual economic outlook report, prepared by 19
corporate economists, set the tone.
   ``There is, first of all, a very big difference in what our
consultants are projecting now, compared to what they were
projecting last spring,'' Lewis T. Preston, chairman of J.P. Morgan
&amp; Co. and council vice chairman, told reporters before presenting
the report to leaders of the nation's top 100 corporations.
   While three-fourths of the economists believe the economy still
can skirt a recession this year, projected growth in the second
half was down to 0.3 percent at an annual rate, compared with a 2
percent rate projected in May.
   Five of the 19 panelists said an economic downturn would occur
before year's end.
   In a session with reporters, 12 of the council's corporate
chiefs assessed their particular industries. While most agreed on
the overall economic sluggishness, many noted that weakness varied
from industry to industry and from region to region.
   ``It feels like (a recession) in some segments,'' said General
Electric Co. Chairman John F. Welch Jr., who becomes council
chairman in January. ``In other segments, things are quite good.''
   Citicorp's Reed said consumers were reflecting the economy.
   ``We look at our credit card business ... and we see different
patterns depending on the state of the economy in a given area,''
he said.
   ``In areas where the economy is very weak, consumers tend to
prepay their outstanding and put the card in a drawer,'' Reed said.
``And in areas where they're feeling good, they tend to use it
normally.''
   But most agreed that even those industries that had not been
greatly affected by the economic sluggishness earlier in the year,
slowed dramatically after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``There is still growth but at a lesser rate than in the past,''
said James D. Robinson III, chairman of the American Express Co.
   ``This, too, changes as you go across the country - the
Northeast, of course, being quite hard hit now; Central and Western
parts of the country, however, spending still a bit more robust,''
he said.
   Robinson, Welch and others agreed that housing and consumer
spending on durable goods - big-ticket items such as appliances and
automobiles - have been most adversely affected.
   Those items were sliding even before the Persian Gulf crisis, in
part because of high interest rates. The oil-price shock has
removed even more money with which to buy them.
   ``Housing starts, instead of being up about 2.25 percent, are
going to be down about 12.25 percent this year,'' said S.D. Bechtel
Jr., chairman emeritus of the Bechtel Group Inc. ``Next year? More
of the same.''
   Bechtel also said non-residential construction would be down
considerably this year.
   ``Our consumer-related businesses - appliances, light bulbs and
things like that - were going along at a fairly even keel for the
first seven months ... and clearly were affected in August by the
shock that hit the system and orders fell off in line with consumer
confidence,'' said GE's Welch. ``So we've seen a real slowdown in
the consumer durable side.''
   Among those industries still experiencing some strength include
food, drugs and health care, areas most resistant to recessionary
effects, the business leaders said.
   ``Consumer credit continues to be good but we're seeing a modest
(rise) across the country in delinquencies and charge offs,'' said
Chase Manhattan's Butcher. ``Interestingly, about 50 percent of
thse delinquencies and charge offs are individual bankruptcies.''
   In the heavy machinery sector, both aircraft and electrical
machinery orders are strong, Welch said.
   Roger B. Smith, retired chairman of General Motors Corp., said
the automobile industry still expects a ``very good year.''

   Xerox Corp., the sleeping giant of office
products companies, has woken up.
   Analysts say it's about time, after the company's loss of its
dominant position in the copier industry and its foray into the
financial services business.
   Xerox this week launches a television advertising campaign that
the company hopes will shake its image as merely a photocopier
maker and establish it as ``the document company.''
   In an industry now bursting with facsimile machines, fancy
copiers, optical scanners and personal computers, Paul Allaire,
Xerox's new president and chief executive, wants top billing for
the company that invented the plain-paper copier.
   ``There's no other company that can come close to making the
kind of claims and positionings that we do,'' Allaire said in a
recent interview. ``We think it really does build from our heritage
and should give us an advantage of uniqueness'' in today's crowded
information industry.
   The ad campaign, which includes a catchy Broadway show tune, is
more than a sales pitch. The company wants to change the mindset of
both white-collar America and Xerox employees themselves.
   The message is that Xerox, whose name is virtually synonymous
with photocopying, can help office workers create and publish
splashy reports, not just copy individual pieces of paper.
   ``By focusing on the document, we actually see more opportunity
for Xerox,'' said Leonard Vickers, Xerox's senior vice president
for marketing. ``Yes, we'll sing and dance . . . but it's a lot
more than that. We're just sharpening and redefining the business
we're in around the document.''
   By stressing the importance of quality documents, Xerox can sell
more of its printers, scanners, fax machines, computer networks,
work stations, electric typewriters, software and, of course,
copiers, Vickers said. Then there's its newest product, DocuTech, a
$220,000 multi-functional machine that allows users to create and
alter documents digitally, as well as publish them.
   Analysts say Xerox is onto something.
   ``Clearly, the direction is right,'' said B. Alex Henderson, an
analyst with Prudential Bache Securities in New York. ``Nobody's
doubting that this is what they need to do.''
   Analysts have long criticized Xerox for branching out into the
financial services businesses in 1979 when it established the Xerox
Credit Corp. Today, Allaire has put some of those businesses on the
auction block and is considering selling others.
   ``We will look at every one of them and if we cannot have a game
plan to have each of those units deliver at least a 15 percent
return on equity, we will look at ways of not being in those
businesses,'' said the 52-year-old Allaire, who took the helm at
Xerox in August.
   Xerox has already started doing that. It announced Thursday an
agreement to sell NAVCO Corp., an auto insurance company, to a
subsidiary of General Motors Acceptance Corp. for approximately
$250 million.
   ``Like a lot of huge corporations, they got led down the
unrelated diversification path,'' said David J. Schofield, a
technology analyst with Duff &amp; Phelps in Chicago. ``And it seems
the general consensus is that that doesn't work.''
   The financial services business was once seen as a way to make
up for a drop in Xerox's share of the plain-paper copier market.
Japanese competition reduced Xerox's share to 8.5 percent in 1985.
Xerox increased that to a 15.2 percent share last year, according
to Dataquest Inc. Last year, the company won the Commerce
Department's Malcolm Baldrige quality award.
   Xerox last year had net income of $704 million on revenues of
$17.6 billion, compared to net income of $632 million on revenues
of $16.4 billion in 1988.
   While the advertising campaign won't change Xerox's image
overnight, company officials say it is the dawn of a new era.
   The campaign is ``Paul Allaire's effort to create a 90s
corporation,'' Vickers said. ``There's a very hardheaded logic
behind what looks like a softhearted campaign. ... We're doing it,
for the best of all reasons, to make money, to grow the company.''
   It began as an internal campaign in September when Allaire sent
out letters and a booklet to Xerox's 111,400 employees explaining
``the document company'' strategy.
   The campaign went public two weeks ago in select newspaper and
radio advertisements, but will hit mainstream America during the
first game of the World Series on Tuesday with one of a series of
lively, sometimes thoughtful, television ads.
   All the radio and television ads are accompanied by a version of
a Stephen Sondheim song, ``Putting It Together,'' from the Broadway
show ``Sunday in the Park With George.''

<HEAD>Majority Approves GM-Canada Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the Canadian Auto Workers union have
voted overwhelmingly to approve a new three-year contract with
General Motors Corp., the automaker and union said.
   Overall, 90 percent of the workers at GM plants in Oshawa, St.
Catharines, Windsor, Scarborough, Woodstock, London and Ste.
Therese voted Sunday to approve the new pact, the union said in a
news release.
   Production workers voted 93 percent in favor and skilled trades
workers were 80 percent in favor of the new contract.
   ``It meets the immediate needs of our members and addresses
their overall social concerns as well,'' union President Bob White
said.
   The deal, which was reached Thursday, was approved by more than
400 local union leaders on Saturday and prevented a strike by GM's
36,500 unionized workers.
   Under the agreement, GM of Canada workers will get wage
increases of 7.5 percent in the first year, followed by increases
of 6.7 percent and 4.8 percent. That includes a cost-of-living
increase of $2.38 an hour over the three years.
   Under the old contract, GM workers earned an average of $17.82
an hour.
   ``We have wage increases in each of the three years, improved
cost-of-living protection against inflation ... more time off the
job to spend with the family, and an innovative worker security
program to prevent layoffs and ease the impact when they hit,''
White said.
   At a van plant in Scarborough, where 2,376 workers face layoffs,
the new pact provides employees with hiring preference at other GM
plants and additional income protection should the plant close
prior to the pact's expiration date.
   The GM-union agreement is similar to one the union reached with
Ford of Canada in September and union officials have said that a
matching pact will be sought with Chrysler of Canada in
negotiations that continue Tuesday.

<HEAD>IBM 3rd Quarter Profit Rises 27 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM said today its profit jumped nearly 27
percent in the third quarter despite weakening economic conditions
at home and abroad.
   International Business Machines Corp. said net income for the
three months ended Sept. 30 totaled $1.11 billion, or $1.95 a
share, up from $877 million, or $1.51 a share, in the same quarter
last year.
   Revenue rose nearly 7 percent to $15.28 billion, from $14.30
billion in the year-ago period.
   Overall sales slipped 1.5 percent to $9.01 billion, but revenue
derived from support services, software, equipment rental and
financing posted double-digit increases over the year-earlier
period.
   The earnings were slightly below the expectations of industry
analysts.
   ``Despite weakening economies in the U.S. and other parts of the
world and a major product transition, we continue to make progress
on the course we have set for the business,'' IBM Chairman John F.
Akers said in a statement.
   He said the company, based in suburban Armonk, is ``encouraged
by customer response'' to the recent introduction of the System-390
line, a new generation of mainframe computers that are about twice
as powerful as current models. The line was unveiled in early
September, though some models won't be available until the third
quarter of 1991.
   Akers said the world's largest computer company also was seeing
the benefits from a cost-cutting plan announced late last year. The
restructuring includes the elimination of about 10,000 jobs and
plant consolidations. The move was prompted by a slowdown in the
computer industry.
   ``Our portfolio of products and services, which is the strongest
in our history, and our geographic diversity are serving us well,''
Akers said. ``Assuming no further deterioration in the world's
economies, we continue to expect substantially improved financial
performance for 1990.''
   For the year's first nine months, IBM reported net earnings of
$3.56 billion, or $6.21 a share, up 12 percent from $3.17 billion,
or $5.43 a share in the 1989 period.
   Revenue for the first three quarters totaled $46.0 billion, up
almost 9 percent from $42.2 billion in the same period a year
earlier.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Upholds New York Man's $1 Million Award for Asbestos
Exposure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact a $1
million punitive-damages award won against The Celotex Corp. by a
New York man who sued over his exposure to asbestos.
   The justices, without comment, refused to hear arguments that
the award wrongly was based on mere negligence and not, as required
by New York law, on a finding of reckless or intentional conduct.
   John E. Johnson, who from 1942 to 1945 worked as an
electrician's helper at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, was diagnosed after
his retirement in 1985 as having a lung condition caused by
asbestos exposure.
   Johnson sued Celotex and other asbestos manufacturers over their
failure to warn him about the dangers of such exposure.
   Asbestos has been used for decades in the construction of
buildings and ships. Inhalation of asbestos fibers has been linked
to various diseases.
   Tens of thousands of personal-injury lawsuits have been filed
against asbestos manufacturers by shipyard workers. Hundreds of
asbestos-in-buildings suits also have been filed.
   Some asbestos makers have sought protection by filing for
bankruptcy.
   After a trial on Johnson's charges, U.S. District Judge Charles
Sifton awarded him $350,000 in compensatory damages and $2.8
million in punitive damages.
   Celotex, one of three defendants who had not settled before
trial with Johnson, was ordered to pay $1 million of the $2.8
million punitive-damages award.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Sifton's ruling
last March.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Celotex argued that
the appeals court misapplied New York law in upholding the
punitive-damages award.
   The appeal also contended that Johnson's case wrongly had been
consolidated with a lawsuit filed in behalf of a man who had died
from a disease attributed to asbestos.
   Johnson lives in Long Island but a lawyer who worked on his case
could not say which community.
   The case is The Celotex Corporation vs. Johnson, 90-339.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
a group of shipping companies ordered to beef up pension funds for
dockworkers in Mobile, Ala., and Philadelphia.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the
companies say jeopardizes some labor negotiations along the East
Coast.
   The case stems from a settlement in 1988 between the
International Longshoreman's Association and the Carriers Container
Council, a group of shippers that administers a benefit fund for
East Coast dockworkers.
   The council is an outgrowth of a 1977 labor dispute prompted by
the changing nature of the longshore industry. Up to that time,
contributions to pension plans were based on the number of
man-hours worked.
   But with the advent of containerized shipping, there was a drop
in hours worked at smaller ports such as Mobile. Pension fund
contributions now are based on tonnage of cargo loaded and unloaded
at the docks.
   The 1988 agreement between the council and the ILA left the
shipping association with a $57 million surplus. The shipping
companies said they contributed too much money to the fund because
their tonnage assessments were mistakenly too high.
   Pension fund managers for the Philadelphia and Mobile workers
did not sign the 1988 pact.
   Collective bargaining in the industry operates on two tiers - a
national level designed to produce an overall union contract for
docks from Maine to Texas and at a local level at each port in
which ILA locals negotiate with their employers.
   The Philadelphia and Mobile funds sued the shipping company
group over the 1988 surplus. A federal judge in Alabama ordered the
companies to pay $15.3 million to the Philadelphia fund and $4.2
million to the Mobile pension plan.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March agreed that the
companies must make restitution to the two funds, but sent the case
back for further hearings on the proper amount of damages.
   The appeals court also upheld a related ruling by another
federal judge who said the shippers group must pay more money to
the Mobile fund for withdrawing as a contributor to that plan.
   The judge ordered the shippers to pay $1.2 million for
withdrawing. The appeals court said the amount must be determined
by an arbitrator.
   In its appeal to the Supreme Court, the shipping companies said
the appeals court ruling could interfere with negotiations between
labor and management to keep pension funds solvent.
   But the 11th Circuit court said federal pension law generally
prohibits employers from recovering surplus money contributed to an
employee trust fund.
   The ILA supported the shipping company appeal. The union said
the appeals court ruling could mean disaster for collective
bargaining in the industry.
   The case is Carriers Container Council vs. Mobile Steamship
Association, 90-323.

<HEAD>Compaq Introduces New Notebook-Sized Computer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Compaq Computer Corp. on Monday introduced a new
notebook-sized personal computer experts say will give the company
an edge over the competition in laptop models.
   The new model from the Houston-based personal computer maker
uses several innovations to squeeze its electronics, including a 20
megahertz Intel Corp. 386SX microprocessor, into an 8{-by-11-inch,
7{-pound machine.
   Compaq said the computer uses technology originally developed
for the defense industry. The technology allows the computer's
circuit board to fold in half to take up less space.
   Compaq calls the new LTE 386s-20, introduced at a news
conference in New York, the highest performance ``notebook''
computer on the market.
   Although at least one competitor has announced a 386SX-based
notebook computer, Compaq will be the first to ship such a machine
when its dealers start receiving the model later this month,
industry experts said.
   The computer has a suggested retail price of $6,999 for a model
with a 60-megabyte fixed disk drive and $6,499 for one with a
30-megabyte drive. It will sell in the range of $5,000 at Compaq
dealers.
   Compaq also announced an optional attachment that increases the
performance of the computer when it is used on a desk.
   Several industry observers said the new machine may prove too
expensive, particularly at a time when the economy is declining,
and when several competitors are poised to introduce lower-priced
notebook machines.
   ``I think it's an exciting product, and I think it's an exciting
technology, but at that high of a price tag I'm not sure,'' said
Linda Kiley, a research analyst with the BIS-CAP International
market research firm in Norwell, Mass.

<HEAD>Wall Street Journal Plans to Halt Circulation of Asian Paper in
Singapore</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of the Wall Street Journal announced
Monday they will halt the circulation of the Asian Wall Street
Journal in Singapore, following the publication of new restrictions
on the foreign press there.
   ``What the government of Singapore wants is for the foreign
press to practice self-censorship,'' Dow Jones &amp; Co., the majority
owner of the Asian Wall Street Journal, said in an editorial. ``A
facade of factual reporting will be allowed, but any statement by
authorities must be taken at face value.''
   The editorial, published in Monday's editions of the Asian
Journal, the Wall Street Journal in the United States and the Wall
Street Journal Europe, also accused Time Warner Inc.'s Asiaweek of
cooperating with Singapore's regulations. Asiaweek recently
published a positive cover story on retiring Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew.
   Asiaweek's editor Michael O'Neil said the editorial was
``factually incorrect'' and that the story on Lee was not ``too
soft.'' He declined to comment further.
   Lee, in a speech Monday in Hong Kong to the Commonwealth Press
Union, said the Journal's decision was of little consequence.
   Dow Jones' decision is the latest in a long-running battle
between its two Asian publications, the Asian Wall Street Journal
and the Far Eastern Economic Review, and the Singapore government.
   In 1987, Singapore restricted the circulation of the Asian
Journal from 5,000 copies to 400 after the Journal ran a story
about Singapore's efforts to start a second stock market. The
government criticized the story in a 1,500 word letter that the
Journal refused to print in full.
   Singapore also limited the Review to 400 copies for reporting on
the government's treatment of the political opposition and other
sensitive topics.
   When the Review halted its circulation in Singapore, the
government altered its copyright laws to allow a local printing
house to reprint copies of the Review and sell them in Singapore.
   It was not immediately known whether Singapore would also allow
printing houses to do the same with the Journal.
   Dow Jones' decision follows the passing of new regulations by
Singapore's parliament on Aug. 30. Under the regulations, foreign
publications are required to obtain an annual distribution permit
if they distribute more than 300 copies in Singapore and if they
carry articles on politics and current affairs on ``any country in
Southeast Asia.''
   The new regulations also require such foreign publications to
post an unspecified security deposit that can be put toward any
legal liabilities or court costs the publications might face in
Singapore.
   ``What worries us here is not any one provision,'' Dow Jones
said in its editorial. ``What worries us is the purpose to which,
five years of experience warns us, these powers will be put.''

   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about 12 points in
the early going, was down 16.58 at 2,381.44 by 11 a.m. on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 545 up, 656 down and

   The figure came in toward the lower end of advance estimates,
and IBM shares fell 4 to 96\ as traders combed through the data.
   Eastman Kodak led the active list, up 2} at 37&rsqb;, while Polaroid
tumbled 5&lsqb; to 24&lsqb; after a delayed opening.
   Late Friday a federal judge in Boston ordered Kodak to pay
$909.5 million, much less than analysts had expected, to Polaroid
in a prolonged case involving patents on instant cameras.
   Energy stocks also slumped as the price of crude oil for
November delivery fell about $1.50 a barrel, to just over $38 a
barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Texaco lost 1~ to 55{; Atlantic Richfield 1| to 125&lsqb;; Amoco } to

<TEXT>
   Digital Equipment Corp. plans to announce on
Tuesday a new line of minicomputers aimed at small and midsize
businesses, industry analysts said.
   The minicomputers will be the first by Digital to use Intel
Corp.'s highest-power microprocessor, the 486, experts said.
   The new computers will use a 33 megahertz 486 chip and will come
with one to six processors. They will support 16 to 128 users
sitting at desktop terminals and run at 20 million to 100 million
instructions per second, The Boston Globe reported Monday.
   The models will be priced from $18,000 to $100,000 and will run
a version of the popular Unix operating system supplied by Santa
Cruz Operation. An operating system is a computer's base layer of
software that controls internal computer functions.
   Because the machines will use Unix and Intel chips, they will
adhere to industry standards, which increasingly are favored by
computer users. Machines based on industry standards cn more
easily be connected to each other and use standard applications
software.
   Later this month, Digital is expected to announce six new models
in its VAX 6000 line, with nearly double the power of present
models. In addition, the company, based in suburban Maynard, is
likely to announce updates of its DECsystem workstation servers
Oct. 31, the Globe said.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Shrinks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus in September fell from a year
ago as the Gulf crisis pushed up oil import bills, the Finance
Ministry said Monday.
   The nation's exports exceeded its imports by $6.9 billion in
September, down 3.9 percent from the same month last year, the
ministry said.
   In trade with the United States, Japan's surplus narrowed to
$4.31 billion in September from $4.78 billion a year earlier.
Exports to the United States fell 5.7 percent to $8.26 billion,
while imports grew by 1.5 percent to $3.96 billion.
   Overall, exports rose by 6.1 percent to $25.80 billion from
$24.31 billion in September 1989.
   Imports increased by 10.3 percent to $18.89 billion from $17.13
billion a year earlier.
   After Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the cost for crude oil
imports soared 48.7 percent from September 1989 to $2.54 billion. A
barrel of oil averaged $22.32 in September, up 31.9 percent from a
year earlier.
   Aside from oil, economists said overall import growth has
continued strong because of Japan's firm demand for industrial and
consumer goods.
   Amid September imports, gold accounted for $844.76 million, up
352.4 percent from a year earlier.
   Finance Ministry officials said they couldn't explain the surge.
Economists said investors might be tending to buy gold for security
during the Gulf crisis.
   For the first half of fiscal 1990, which began April 1, Japan's
trade surplus shrank by 11.4 percent to $29.10 billion from $32.86
billion in the 1989 period, the ministry said. Exports in the first
half rose 1.6 percent to $139.43 billion, while imports climbed 5.7
percent to $110.33 billion.

   Pepsico Inc. said its third-quarter earnings
rose 25 percent as all of its businesses posted sales and profit
gains.
   The soft drink, food and restaurant company said it earned
$336.6 million, or 42 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept.
8, up from $269.3 million, or 34 cents per share, in the same
period of 1989.
   Revenue increased to $4.48 billion from $3.9 billion.
   Pepsico said its soft drink business had an 11 percent revenue
gain, to $1.7 billion, while operating profits in that division
rose 16 percent to $239.3 million.
   The company said its U.S. soft drink operations chalked up gains
despite the loss of business from Burger King fast-food
restaurants, which switched to Coca-Cola soft drinks from Pepsico's
brands. Pepsico's soft drinks include Pepsi-Cola, Diet Pepsi and
Mountain Dew.
   Pepsico said revenue from its snack food business rose 16
percent to $1.2 billion, while operating profits were up 14 percent
to $240.6 million.
   The company's snack food brands include Doritos, Tostitos,
Crunch Tators and Santitas.
   The firm's restaurant business recorded an 18 percent gain in
revenue, to $1.5 billion. Operating profits increased 6 percent to
$147.3 million, after $17.6 million was deducted for the closing of
unprofitable restaurants.
   Pepsico's restaurants include Kentucky Fried Chicken, Taco Bell
and Pizza Hut.
   For the first nine months of the year, Pepsico reported earnings
of $811 million, or $1.01 per share, up from $699.3 million, or 88

<HEAD>Intel Announces Powerful New Chips for Laptop Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Intel Corp. announced Monday a set of compact,
power-saving microprocessor chips that will enable computer makers
to produce smaller laptop computers with longer battery life.
   In picking Tokyo to announce the new version of its highly
popular 386 microprocessor, dubbed the 386 SL, the U.S. chip
company underscored Japan's growing domination of laptops - one of
the fastest-growing areas of the computer market.
   Intel's powerful 386 microprocessor is used as the ``brains'' of
many IBM-compatible personal computers, but previous versions
consumed relatively large amounts of power, helping drain the
batteries of portable computers.
   Intel said the new chips, made especially for laptop and smaller
``palmtop'' computers, would cut power use in half.
   The announcement of the 386 SL and other associated chips
represents Intel's entry into the market for ``chip sets,'' or
packages of chips used by computer makers to build clones of IBM
and other computers.
   Advances in semiconductor technology since Intel introduced the
first 386 processor in 1985 also have allowed it to combine the
functions of many chips in one microprocessor.
   Intel said the new 386 SL processor contains 855,000
transistors, and includes a short-term memory, a main memory
controller and computer management circuitry.
   With the new chip set, a computer that mimics the popular AT
model of International Business Machines Corp. can be built with
only 10 chips plus memory on one circuit board measuring four by
six inches, compared with 170 chips for early 386-based computers,
Intel said.
   By 1993, only one chip plus memory will be needed to make the
same computer, said David House, president of Intel's Microcomputer
Components Group.
   ``We have shrunk the 386 to a fraction of its original size,''
said Intel President Andrew Grove. ``This also made it possible for
the chip to run faster and for us to make it more cheaply. But more
importantly, it leaves us the room to add additional chip
functions.''
   Included in the 386 SL is a new power management system that
automatically shuts off unused computer components to conserve
battery life.
   Lower power consumption also allows manufacturers to reduce the
weight of laptops by using smaller batteries, one of the heaviest
components.
   Intel said the 386 SL will cost $176 in bulk. Computers
containing the chips will become available early next year, it
said.
   Grove said Japan now accounts for 10 percent of Intel's
approximately $4 billion in annual sales - a share that may grow
with the new chip set.
   ``We brought this introduction to Japan in recognition of
Japan's leadership in computer packaging and display technology,
which are the other key technologies in portable computers,'' Grove
told reporters.
   While U.S. companies remain strong n desktop computers,
Japanese companies have introduced a flurry of high-performance
laptops and are rapidly increasing their world market share.
   Laptop sales have grown particularly rapidly in Japan, where
limited housing and office space often prohibits the permanent use
of desk space for a full-size personal computer.

   London shares closed slightly higher but below

<HEAD>United Places Order Worth Up to $22 Billion With Boeing</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with further details</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Airlines' parent company today announced
an order worth up to $22 billion for 128 Boeing aircraft, the
largest airplane deal in history.
   The agreement includes firm orders for 34 Boeing model 777s -
the first-ever purchase of that new plane - and 30 Boeing 747-400s,
plus options on 34 model 777s and 30 model 747-400s.
   United, one of the nation's biggest airlines, had come close to
placing the wide-body order earlier this year but postponed it in
July at the request of UAL's labor unions, who were leading an
effort to buy the company.
   The employees failed to get bank financing for a $4.4 billion
bid and UAL's board rejected their offer last Tuesday.
   This is United's third major aircraft order in 18 months. Its
last order, for 370 narrow-body Boeing jetliners, came in April
1989.
   ``This purchase will allow United to replace older aircraft as
well as expand both its domestic and international services,'' said
Stephen Wolf, chairman of UAL Corp., the parent company of
Chicago-based United.
   ``In short, it will ensure that this company is positioned to
compete aggressively around the world,'' he said in a statement.
   In Seattle, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group spokesman Richard
Schleh said the twin-engine 777, designed to fill a market niche
between the 747-400 and the existing 767-300 widebody, will be 209
feet long, have a wingspan of 197 feet, and will seat 360 to 390
passengers in two classes.
   ``The importance of today's commitment for Boeing cannot be
overstated,'' said Boeing chairman and chief executive officer
Frank Shrontz. ``With a ratification by Boeing's board on Oct. 29,
this order will launch an all-new 777 aircraft family - which will
set a new standard for very large twin-engine operations around the
world.''
   United is to receive its first 777s in May 1995 and the first of
its new 747s in 1994, Schleh said. Both planes will be powered by
variations of Pratt &amp; Whitney's PW4000 engine.
   United had long been rumored as the 777's ``launch'' customer.
Boeing confirmed this summer it was discussing the 777 with United
and seven other carriers, including American Airlines, British
Airways, Japan Airlines and Cathay Pacific.
   United's 777s will seat 363 passengers, 38 in first class and
325 in economy. The 747s, which normally seat 412 in three classes,
will be in a variety of configurations tailored to specific
markets, Boeing said.
   Boeing earlier had said it planned the 777 for 350-375
passengers.
   Boeing plans to build the jets with folding wingtips, to allow
it to fit at existing airport gates. United, however, has not yet
selected the folding wings as an option, Schleh said.
   The 777 will have a range of up to 4,800 statute miles. That
compares with the long-range 767-300, which can carry 261
passengers in mixed classes 7,200 miles, and the 747-400, the
world's largest commercial jet, which can fly 8,000 miles.
   Boeing already is talking about building a ``family'' of 777
aircraft and has proposed a version that could haul 300-320 up to
7,600 miles. The design eventually could be adapted further with a
stretched fuselage, Boeing says.

   Kuwaiti Oil Minister Rashid
al-Ameeri Monday discounted speculation that oil prices would reach
$100 a barrel in the event of a military strike to liberate Kuwait.
   Ameeri, who is with the Kuwaiti government-in-exile set up in
Saudi Arabia after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion, told a press conference
that oil prices would increase in the event of hostilities, but not
that high.
   He said Iraqi troops have placed mines around Kuwaiti oil
fields, refineries and other installations. War would result in
further damage to Kuwaiti oil installations, he said.
   But he added that Kuwaiti leaders have drawn up contingency
plans to reconstruct the facilities with international assistance.
   Ameeri's statements were clearly intended to reassure the world
about the oil supply as more and more Kuwaitis are heard expressing
impatience with the U.N. sanctions against Iraq and pressing for a
U.S.-led military strike to end the 10-week-old Iraqi occupation of
their country.
   Independent oil industry executives have said the market would
suffer a severe upheaval in the event of a military conflagration,
but the extent of the oil price hikes would depend on the amount of
damage to the oil facilities and the duration of hostilities.
   They've also noted that Saudi Arabia, which sits on one-third of
the world's proven oil reserves, would exert itself to stabilize
the market.
   The Saudis were instrumental in offsetting the shortfall caused
by Iraq's invasion, which took 4 million barrels per day off the
market. The kingdom increased its own output by about 2 million
barrels per day to 7.5 million barrels and urged other members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase their
production.
   Oil experts note that the kingdom is also preparing to reuse oil
facilities that were laid to waste during the lean years of the
glutted world oil market in the early to mid-1980s.
   Ameeri was attending a three-day conference in Jiddah of
prominent Kuwaiti exiles discussing their country's plight and its
future.
   He said the recent increase in oil prices was not the result of
a shortage in oil supplies, but of fears about war in the Gulf.
   Former Saudi Oil Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani said recently that
oil prices would rise to $100 dollars a barrel if war broke out.
   Ameeri noted that oil production has increased to make up for
lost supplies from Kuwait and Iraq. He also said countries could
release oil from their strategic reserves.
   ``If the crisis is resolved quickly, then the shortfall in the
market can be offset,'' he said. ``But if the crisis lingers on,
the market would not be able to put up with the adverse
consequences.''
   Ameeri estimated Kuwait was losing $50 million to $60 million a
day in income because of the shutdown of its oil industry. Kuwait's
pre-invasion output was 1.5 million barrels a day.
   He also estimated that the Iraqis are now pumping about 90,000
barrels a day, just meeting the needs of local power stations and
desalination plants.

   The first cellular telephone system in

first call went to U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle, officials said.
   The phone system is operated by WesTel Radiotelefon Ltd., a
joint venture of U S West Inc. of the United States and the
Hungarian Telecommunications Co.
   The Hungarian phone company holds a 51 percent stake in the
venture, while U S West, a regional phone company based outside

   Hungary's minister of commerce and trade, Akos Peter Bod,
telephoned Quayle and U.S. Secretary of Commerce Robert Mosbacher,
the venture said in a statement.
   The new system initially will serve 3,000 subscribers in the
capital, and double that by February, officials said. The venture
plans to expand service to the highway corridor between Budapest
and Vienna by the end of 1993.
   U S West also has an agreement to build a cellular system in

   The early October sales rate for cars and trucks
made by the Big Three automakers in North America dropped 4.8
percent from the same period last year, when sales began a
three-month slump, the automakers said Monday.
   Year-to-year comparisons were clouded by wild swings in the
September and October sales rates last year, prompted mainly by
incentives and announcements of price increases.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. said
their domestically made cars and light trucks sold at an average
daily rate of 27,620 from Oct. 1-10 this year, compared with a
daily rate of 29,016 during the same time last year.
   Car and truck sales fell 1.5 percent and 10.7 percent,
respectively.
   Consumers who planned to buy cars in the last quarter of 1989
headed to dealerships early to take advantage of incentives before
they ended and to avoid previously announced price boosts for
1990-model cars and trucks.
   For example, GM offered its dealers big incentives in September
1989 to clear their lots for 1990 cars and trucks. Customers
flocked to showrooms, and that resulted in sharply lower sales
rates in October.
   In turn, that colored Monday's year-to-year, early October
comparisons. GM's car sales were up 15.9 percent while those of
Ford, which didn't offer incentives like GM did last year, dropped
23.8 percent.
   Through Oct. 10 of this year, sales of cars and trucks by the
Big Three were running 8.1 percent behind last year's pace, with
car sales down 10.4 percent and truck sales off 4.4 percent.
   Ford said its early October car sales fell 17.2 percent and
truck sales were down 23.8 percent, combining for a 21.3 percent
decline in vehicle sales. The company's year-to-date car and truck
sales were down 9.1 percent.
   GM said its vehicle sales were up 13.3 percent over last year.
In addition to the 15.9 percent increase in car sales, GM's light
truck sales were up 7.3 percent.
   GM's car and truck sales so far this year were running 5 percent
behind last year's pace.
   Chrysler said its combined car and truck sales for early October
were 10.8 percent lower than last year, with car sales rising 2.6
percent and truck sales dropping 26 percent. The company's vehicle
sales so far this year were 14.6 percent behind last year's pace.

<HEAD>They're Not Waking Up to Pepsi AM, Soft Drink Maker Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After a year of test-marketing a high-caffeine
soft drink, Pepsi-Cola Co. evidently has woken up and smelled the
coffee.
   The No. 2 beverage maker behind Coca-Cola Co. says it has
stopped testing its extra-kick Pepsi A.M., although Pepsi will
continue to test a marketing strategy aimed at luring coffee
drinkers to its regular cola in the morning.
   Pepsi-Cola had begun testing Pepsi A.M. in August 1989 in
Waterloo, Iowa, but decided to discontinue the beverage this past
August, company spokeswoman Leigh Curtin said Monday. There are no
immediate plans to brink the drink back.
   ``What we found from the test was we didn't need to reformulate
our product for consumers to enjoy it in the morning,'' Curtin
said.
   Pepsi A.M. had about 25 percent more caffeine than regular
Pepsi. The compny wanted to see if the added jolt would attract
coffee drinkers, but sales proved slow and some Iowa consumers said
the beverage tasted flat.
   While the test has ended, Pepsi has not given up on converting
coffee drinkers to its soft drinks in the morning, said another
Pepsi spokeswoman, Rebecca Madeira.
   She said a promotional test begun in August 1989 in Fort Wayne,
Ind., is continuing using the slogan ``Pepsi in the Morning'' for
its regular cola.
   Coca-Cola also has used periodic promotions in some markets that
pitched its regular soft drinks for consumption in the morning.
   Industry experts say the percentage of soft drinks consumed in
the morning has risen to 15 percent of all soda sales from 10
percent a decade ago, an important increase because each 1 percent
share of the market represents more than $400 million in retail
sales.
   Coffee consumption, meanwhile, has shown signs of declining,
though it remains one of the prevalent wakeup beverages in the
country.
   ``We think there is a lot of potential there to expand,'' Ms.
Madeira said.

<HEAD>Earnings Mixed At Four Major Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A handful of the nation's largest banks announced mixed
third-quarter earnings Monday, with No. 2-ranked Chase Manhattan
reporting a huge loss while J.P. Morgan returned to profitability
and Security Pacific's net declined.
   Banks continue to grapple with problem loans to less-developed
countries as well as with a declining U.S. economy and
deteriorating real estate holdings, each of which has taken a toll
on balance sheets.
   Chase Manhattan Bank said it lost $623 million, or the
equivalent of $5.03 a share in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared
with a $1.11 billion loss, which equaled $12.45 a share, a year
ago. Results for both the recent and year-ago quarters include the
effects of several special items.
   Last month Chase said it would post a major loss as it set aside
$650 million to cover potential losses from bad loans, particularly
in the bank's domestic real estate portfolio. At the time Chase
also announced it was eliminating 5,00 jobs and cutting its stock
dividend in half in a restructuring designed to help the bank
``reach higher levels of capital.''
   Chase said last month that it expects earnings in the final
quarter to exceed $140 million.
   For the first nine months, Chase reported a loss of $527
million, or the equivalent of $4.74 a share, compared with a
shortfall of $840 million, or $10.01 a share a year earlier.
   At New York-based J.P. Morgan &amp; Co., net income totaled $208
million, or $1.08 a share for the quarter, compared with a loss of
$1.82 billion, or the equivalent of $9.92 a share a year ago, when
the company added $2 billion to its reserves to cover problem Third
World loans.
   Morgan Chairman Dennis Weatherstone noted that ``trading results
were excellent, net interest revenue was stronger and revenue from
investment management and operational services continued to grow.''
Morgan is the nation's fourth-largest bank.
   For the first nine months, Morgan said net income totaled $814
million, or $4.23 a share, compared with a loss of $1.43 billion,
or $7.87 a share in the equivalent 1989 period.
   Security Pacific Corp., headquartered in Los Angeles and the
nation's fifth-largest bank, said net income for the third quarter
slipped 27 percent to $135.3 million, or $1.05 a share, from $185.1
million, or $1.55 a share a year earlier.
   Security Pacific Chief Executive Robert H. Smith noted that the
bank has taken a number of steps to ``fortify our balance sheet.''
Among them, the bank strengthened its reserve pool for loan losses
and over the course of the year has added $5.7 billion in new core
deposits through acquisitions and aggressive marketing, he said.
   For the nine-month period, the bank reported net income of
$518.9 million, or $4.18 a share, down 5 percent from $548.9
million, or $4.67 a share in the 1989 period.
   At First Chicago Corp., the nation's 13th largest bank, net
income for the quarter totaled $36.2 million, or 45 cents a share,
compared with a loss of $23.3 million or 50 cents a share a year
earlier.
   The Chicago-based holding company said the improved performance
reflected a smaller provision for loan losses - $160 million versus
$200 million a year earlier - and tax benefits associated with a
1987 net operating loss.
   Chairman Barry Sullivan said in a statement that ``we recognize
that the near-term economic outlook is hostile and we are
tightening our belts accordingly.''
   For the first nine months of 1990, First Chicago reported net
income of $192.2 million, or $2.60 per share, down 18 percent from
$235.8 million, or $3.33 per share for the 1989 period.

   Harvest pressure helped push most grain and
soybean futures prices lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said dry weekend weather in the Midwest allowed farmers
to get back into their fields to resume the soybean and corn
harvest, which was stalled by heavy rains early last week.
   More rain is forecast for the region later this week but
coverage is expected to be light, said William Biedermann, grains
analyst with the futures brokerage Allendale Inc.
   A National Weather Service outlook released on Friday predicted
below-normal rainfall in the Midwest for the five-day period
beginning Thursday.
   Analysts said the early dip in futures prices also reflected a
reluctance by farmers to sell their crops at current prices.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.65{ a bushel; corn was
1} cents to 2} cents lower with December at $2.28 a bushel; oats
were \ cent lower to } cent higher with December at $1.20 a bushel;

   The Penn Central Corp. said Monday it has
offered $408 million to buy a group of non-standard automobile
insurance companies from American Financial Corp.
   American Financial is privately owned by the Lindner family, and
owns 41.6 percent of Penn Central's common shares. Carl H. Lindner
is principal shareholder and chairman of American Financial, and is
chief executive of Penn Central.
   The insurance group in the deal proposed Monday includes Atlanta
Casualty Co., Windsor Insurance Co., Stonewall Insurance Co. and
their subsidiaries. The companies had net premiums of $328 million
and net income of $31.3 million last year, and an estimated
shareholders' equity of $207 million on Sept. 30, Penn Central
said.
   The sale requires approval of a committee of Penn Central
directors and government regulators, among other conditions. Penn
Central officials said they hoped it would be completed by the end
of the year.
   Penn Central operates industrial manufacturing, defense service,
insurance and energy businesses.

<TEXT>
   The high cost of covering the Persian Gulf
crisis and a sluggish national advertising market have prompted ABC
News to consider cutting back its news operations.
   According to Monday's Wall Street Journal, the network is
considering closing several bureaus and furloughing a small number
of employees. While ABC is about to make major investments in a
handful of foreign news bureaus, it is taking a hard look at
reductions in domestic operations.
   ``If there is some movement in domestic bureaus, it will more a
product of reorganization than cutbacks,'' said Sherrie Rollins, an
ABC spokeswoman, when contacted for comment. She said it was
``premature'' to say whether a reorganization will result in a net
loss of employees.
   ABC, a unit of Capital CitiesABC Inc., also decided not to
proceed, at least temporarily, with a new overnight news broadcast
that was scheduled to debut in January.
   Because of the cost of covering the Middle East crisis, ABC has
trimmed its projection for an operating profit to $50 million this
year, compared with $75 million that had been anticipated earlier,
according to the Journal.
   ABC is the top-rated evening network newscast, which features
Peter Jennings.
   Other major broadcast networks also are considering cuts. NBC
News, owned by General Electric Co., said it was laying off 25
people and has held its 1991 budget to this year's levels.

<HEAD>State Announces $100 Million Automaker Refund</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   State Attorney General Robert Abrams on Monday
announced a settlement with 12 car manufacturers that will provide
up to $100 million in refunds to consumers.
   The settlement was reached under the state's ``lemon law'' and
could set a precedent for other states, officials said. Abrams said
he believes it to be the largest refund by automakers in the
nation's history.
   The settlement will provide refunds for all New York residents
who bought or leased new cars after Aug. 2, 1986, and have been
forced to pay for repairs that should have been covered by
warranty.
   The repairs must have been made after the manufacturer's basic
warranty expired (normally during the first 12 months or 12,000
miles, whichever comes first), but before the first 24 months or
18,000 miles, or whichever comes first.
   The state's lemon law requires manufacturers and their dealers
to make repairs under their warranty, at no cost to the customer,
for a period of two years or 18,000 miles, whichever comes first.
   The carmakers who entered into the agreement are Chrysler, Ford,
General Motors, Honda, Hyundai, Isuzu, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan,
Subaru, Toyota and Volvo. Each company also paid the state $10,000
in costs, for a total of $120,000. But they did not admit
wrongdoing in signing the settlement.
   Some carmakers, such as Mercedes-Benz, were not included in the
settlement because their warranty programs are broader than the
state's lemon law, Abrams said.
   Abrams said the settlement was reached after a ``long-fought
effort'' of four years to get the auto manufacturers to agree on
the terms.
   Within the next month, the automakers will place advertisements
in major New York newspapers detailing the refund plan. The ads
will run for six weeks and consumers have 4{ months to respond.
   ``What happens in New York becomes very important to the rest of
the nation and we may see other states taking a look at this,''
Abrams said.
   Since the state's lemon law was expanded in 1986, a record $60
million has been recovered on behalf of consumers, Abrams said.

<HEAD>Judge Sees Long Convoluted Proceeding in Keating Case</HEAD>

   Charles Keating declared his innocence Monday
before a preliminary hearing on charges the former chief of
American Continental Corp. bilked investors out of more than $250
million.
   ``It's dangerous to be right when government is wrong,'' he told
reporters outside the courtroom.
   His lawyer, Stephen Neal, asked to explain the comment, said:
``Mr. Keating is innocent. He believes in his innocence. He's
confident that when the evidence is developed he will be
vindicated.''
   Keating, 66, remained jailed Monday on $5 million bail after
Superior Court Judge Lance Ito set a tentative trial date of Nov.
26.
   Keating and three others are accused of defrauding investors
with American Continental junk bonds sold through the now defunct
Lincoln Savings and Loan.
   Experts place the cost of bailing out the failed California S&amp;L
at about $2 billion, making it the most expensive bailout.
   Keating, an Arizona developer, was chairman of Phoenix-based
American Continental, which owned Lincoln.
   Also in court Monday were Keating's co-defendants, all of whom
are free on bail. They are Ray C. Fidel, 32, former Lincoln
president; Robin S. Symes, 37, former Lincoln chief executive
officer; and Judy Wischer, 42, former American Continental
president.
   Each of the four defendents is charged with 42 counts of fraud
and could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of six or more
counts.
   Neal said he was still pursuing a bail reduction for Keating in
federal court after losing similar bids in state appeals courts.
   The bespectacled Keating was permitted to change from his prison
uniform into slacks and an open-collared beige shirt before
entering the courtroom, where he listened to the proceedings with a
slight smile.
   Ito scheduled a motions hearing Oct. 26.
   ``I expect this will be a long and convoluted discovery
proceeding,'' the judge said.

   Stock prices gained ground today, extending
Friday's rally in an on-again, off-again session.
   Brokers said investors' spirits got a lift from declining oil
prices. Otherwise, they said there wasn't much in the news to
support the advance.
   Traders still appeared to be hypersensitive to any weak spots in
corporate third-quarter earnings reports, which are due to reach
their peak flow over the next couple of weeks.
   A prominent case in point was provided today by International
Business Machines, which posted a third-quarter profit of $1.95 a
share, up from $1.51 a share in the corresponding span last year.
   The figure came in toward the lower end of Wall Street
estimates.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major U.S.
automakers for first period of October 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were nine selling days in the period this year and eight
selling days last year, and 239 selling days so far this year,
compared with 238 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table separately and combined as transplant
cars.
   Mazda has begun selling sport-utility vehicles made in a Ford
plant in Kentucky.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Romania to Devalue Leu, Liberalize Prices; New Currency Seen</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania will devalue its national
currency by almost half and lift subsidies on most consumer goods
beginning Nov. 1, a government official said Monday.
   Economics Minister Eugen Dijmarescu said in an interview that
the government had decided to devalue the Romanian leu from the
current official rate of 20 to the dollar to 35 to the dollar.
   The government also plans to replace the leu with a new currency
early next year, according to official sources.
   Romanians will be able to change their lei, still emblazoned
with the Socialist emblems of Nicolae Ceausesacu's former
dictatorship, for the as-yet-unnamed new currency at a rate of
10-to-one, the sources said.
   Officials said the measures should help the leu become fully
convertible, help attract foreign investment, and help Romania's
devastated economy adjust to free market practices after four
decades of Communist central planning.
   The government also hopes the devaluation will stimulate exports
and redress a spiralling trade deficit, observers said.
   Dijmarescu said the new measures will enable the leu to achieve
convertibility ``sooner than initially thought possible.'' Western
observers say at least three years will be needed for full
convertibility.
   He said subsidies will be lifted Nov. 1 on most consumer goods.
But prices of staples such as bread, meat, and electricity would
remain fixed, to protect low wage earners from the inflationary
effects of the liberalization package.

   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities were virtually unchanged in Monday's auction.
   The Treasury Department sold $9.4 billion in three-month bills
at an average discount rate of 7.18 percent, down from 7.19 percent
last week. Another $9.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.22 percent, up from 7.21 percent last
week.
   The rates for three-month bills were the lowest since they sold
for 7.18 percent on Oct. 1. Rates for six-month bills were the
highest since they averaged 7.33 percent on Sept. 24.
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
- 7.41 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,818.50, and 7.60 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,635.00.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 7.62
percent last week, up from 7.58 percent the previous week.

   A consumer group said Monday that five of the
nation's top 20 property and casualty insurance companies would be
threatened with insolvency in the event of a severe economic
downturn.
   Spokesmen for four of the firms took issue with the report by
the Ralph Nader organization Public Citizen and said the companies
are healthy. Comment was not immediately available from the fifth
firm.
   ``They either used the wrong facts or they got the wrong
numbers,'' said Howard Smith, senior vice president and comptroller
for the American International Group.
   In addition to AIG, the companies listed as potentially at risk
were Aetna, the Hartford, Liberty Mutual and United States Fidelity
&amp; Guaranty.
   ``Although, during the present high phase of the insurance
cycle, none of these companies are on the edge of insolvency, the
underlying weakness in their financial condition is clearly
evident,'' the consumer group said.
   Shawn Mooney, senior vice president of the Insurance Information
Institute, called the study irresponsible. ``You can precipitate a
run on a company by putting out statements that such and such a
company is in bad financial shape,'' he said.
   Public Citizen president Joan Claybrook said she would not advse
people holding policies with any of the companies to change to
another insurer. But she said they should write to their companies
and urge corrective action.
   The study analyzed six factors that it said could cause
companies to fail during a downturn in the insurance business. It
said the five companies were each vulnerable to four of the
factors.
   The 124-page report analyzed shrinking surpluses, the ratio of
surplus to losses and unusually wide premium swings over the years
1969 to 1988.
   Three short-term factors were also examined: the amount of risk
the company insures compared with the size of its cushion against
unexpected losses, the degree to which its investments could be
converted into cash, and the extent of its investment in high-risk
junk bonds.
   Joyce Willis, a spokeswoman for the Hartford Insurance Group,
said Hartford rates high in assessments by credible agencies. ``It
would surprise me that suddenly someone else could come in and use
what appear to be similar criteria and announce that we are
vulnerable,'' she said.
   Ms. Claybrook said Public Citizen believes the standards used by
the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a commonly
accepted rating group for insurers, ``are not tough enough.''
   Her group's report said a combination of low premium volume,
high claims and weak return on investment could mean potential
financial trouble for the companies. It said all of these factors
occur during an insurance cycle downturn.
   ``The failure of just one insurance giant would overwhelm the
state funds designed to protect policyholders,'' Ms. Claybrook
said. ``The result could be another taxpayer bailout on the model
of the savings and loan industry.''
   Smith of AIG said he was ``flabbergasted'' that his institution
would be considered vulnerable. He said AIG had a 17 percent return
on equity in last year's annual report plus the highest premium
volume of any commercial writer in the country, and ``our cash flow
continues to be exceptionally strong.''
   Jonathan Powell, a spokesman for Aetna, called the five firms
named by Public Citizen ``very strong companies'' and said he was
astounded that the consumer group would find otherwise. Whit
Lancaster, manager of corporate communications for Liberty Mutual,
labeled the report ``absurd and reckless.''
   Other firms included in the survey were Allstate, CignaINA,
Chubb, CNA, Continental, Crum &amp; Forster, Farmers, Fireman's Fund,
Kemper, Lincoln, Nationwide, St. Paul, State Farm, Travelers and
USAA. Only Allstate and State Farm failed to register any of the
potential danger signals, the study said.
   Public Citizen recommended several steps to ease the problems it
found. Among them are repeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act that
exempts insurers from anti-trust laws; use of the Racketeer
Influence and Corrupt Organizations law to prosecute fraud and
wrongdoing by insurance executives; use of more insurance tax
dollars for regulation; and a yearly federal report on the
effectiveness of state regulation.

<HEAD>Chemical Companies Suffer Effects of Higher Crude Prices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Crude oil price hikes hampered third-quarter
growth in the chemical industry - a situation analysts say will
worsen by the end of the year.
   Third-quarter earnings are not yet out, but chemical company
stock prices have taken a beating because crude oil prices have
nearly doubled since the Persian Gulf east crisis began.
   Companies with large chemical units like Exxon Corp., Chevron
Corp., Mobil Corp. and E.I. Du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., which owns
Conoco, will offset their chemical earnings squeezes with higher
profits from crude oil sales.
   But companies that focus on chemicals have no crude-oil profit
buffer.
   Makers of chemicals used in making a variety of plastics will be
hit the worst, analysts say, because oil represents a large portion
of their costs.
   ``If conditions stay as they are, it's bound to be worse in the
fourth quarter'' because a recession will follow, said analyst
Leslie C. Ravitz with Salomon Brothers in New York.
   Companies that buy commodity chemicals and further refine them
to make plastics are a little more insulated because a relatively
smaller portion of their feedstock cost is directly related to the
price of oil, analysts say.
   ``Feedstock prices have gone up more quickly than product
prices,'' said Earl Armstrong, a consultant for DeWitt &amp; Co., a
Houston consulting firm that specializes in the chemical industry.
   Armstrong said prices for some refined products began catching
up with the higher costs this month. But most companies were forced
to swallow the higher costs during the first month of the oil
increase because of price protection clauses in supply agreements
that require them to give manufacturers 30 days' notice of an
increase.
   ``Everybody got hurt pretty badly on the time lag,'' Armstrong
said.

<HEAD>Polaroid's Third Quarter Earnings Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp. reported Monday that its
third quarter earnings increased 5 percent over last year, aided by
strong international sales gains.
   The firm said net earnings for the quarter were $31.3 million,
compared with $29.9 million for the same period last year. Total
sales increased 6 percent in the quarter to $463.7 million,
compared to $437.7 million last year.
   The earnings report followed news on Friday that U.S. District
Judge A. David Mazzone had ordered Eastman Kodak Co. to pay
Polaroid $909.5 million in damages and interest for infringing on
seven Polaroid patents. Mazzone said the infringement was not
willful and declined to award the $12 billion Polaroid had sought
in punitive damages.
   U.S. sales were down 6 percent for the quarter ending Sept. 30,
while international sales increased 27 percent. The firm attributed
the gains to strong international sales, aided by a weaker dollar.
   Higher unit sales also contributed to the increased margins, but
were offset by higher marketing costs, resulting in a 5 percent
drop in operating profit, the firm said.
   But profit before taxes increased due to lower interest expense.
   I. MacAllister Booth, president and chief executive officer,
said in a statement the firm remained ``committed to making the
marketing, product development and capital expenditures necessary
to support sales and to secure our competitive position in the
growing imaging marketplace of the future.''
   The third quarter earnings reflected those investments, Booth
said.
   For 1990 operating profits were expected to be flat or slightly
down from last year, reflecting the uncertainties of the U.S.
business climate and continued investments in product development,
Booth said.
   Polaroid supplies instant photography, cameras and films, as
well as conventional films, videotapes and electronic visual
communication products to family, business and technical and
industrial markets.

   Stock prices pushed ahead by fits and starts
Monday, extending Friday's rally despite worries about the outlook
for corporate profits.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 18.32 to
2,416.34 on top of Friday's 32.92-point gain.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 802 up, 748
down and 441 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 164.98 million
shares, against 187.94 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 194.88 million shares.
   Brokers said investors' spirits got a lift from declining oil
prices. Crude oil futures for November delivery fell $1.74 a barrel
to $37.95 on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Otherwise, they said there wasn't much in the news to support
the advance.
   Traders still appeared to be hypersensitive to any weak spots in
corporate third-quarter earnings reports, which are due to reach
their peak flow over the next couple of weeks.
   A prominent case in point was provided Monday by International
Business Machines, which posted a third-quarter profit of $1.95 a
share, up from $1.51 a share in the corresponding span last year.
   The figure came in toward the lower end of advance estimates,
and IBM shares fell 1 to 99\ as traders combed through the data.
   Eastman Kodak, also among the volume leaders, rose 3\ to 37~,
while Polaroid tumbled 6{ to 22} after a delayed opening.
   Late Friday a federal judge in Boston ordered Kodak to pay
$909.5 million, much less than analysts had expected, to Polaroid
in a prolonged case involving patents on instant cameras.
   Boeing, which received a $22 billion aircraft order from UAL,
gained 1{ to 46. UAL slipped &lsqb; to 90&lsqb;.
   Aside from Kodak and Boeing, blue chips that contributed to the
Dow's gain included General Electric, up 1&rsqb; at 54&rsqb;; Philip Morris,
up ~ at 45|; United Technologies, up 1{ at 46, and Sears Roebuck,
up 1&rsqb; at 24&rsqb;.
   Oil stocks were mixed. Precious-metals issues, meanwhile, gave
ground as the price of gold tumbled. ASA Ltd. fell 3~ to 40;
Homestake Mining | to 17&lsqb;, and Newmont Gold 1} to 36}.
   Phelps Dodge, which came in with higher third-quarter earnings,
rose } to 48}.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $22.35 billion, or
0.80 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.42 to 165.84.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 3.51 to 355.03, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 3.20 at 303.23.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 1.99 to 329.54. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 293.27, down .70.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Plummet, Dollar Mostly Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices fell more than $12 Monday, driven by
a drop in the price of oil and by rumors of a negotiated settlement
in the Middle East. The dollar finished higher against all major
currencies except the Japanese yen.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current
delivery fell $12.50 to settle at $375 a troy ounce. Republic
National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $375.70,
down $12.30 from late Friday.
   Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat met
with Saddam Hussein on Sunday and said later that the Iraqi
president was showing a ``certain flexibility'' regarding his
claims to Kuwait.
   Iraq on Monday denied it was softening its stance, but traders
said the news from the Middle East helped drive down the price of
gold.
   Also affecting prices was the energy futures market, where the
near-term contract for oil settled at $37.95 a barrel, down $1.74
from Friday.
   Gold also fell in dealings overseas. In London it dropped to a
late bid of $379.75 a troy ounce, down from $388.15 bid late
Friday.
   In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $379.50, down from
$388.00 bid late Friday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, the metal fell
$2.68 to close at a bid $385.08.
   In New York, the dollar finished up against most major
currencies, after also rising overseas.
   One British pound fetched $1.9498, less expensive than $1.9675
on Friday. In London, the pound fell to $1.9545 from $1.9740.
   However, the dollar fell against the yen across the board. It
closed in New York at 127.73 yen, down from 129.05 Friday. In
Tokyo, it fell to a closing 128.83 yen from 129.98 yen Friday.
Later, in London, it fel to 128.05 yen.
   ``Most of the activity was in cross trading with movement out of
high-yielding currencies ... and movement mostly into yen,'' said
Ronald Holzer, chief dealer with Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   Holzer said traders moved out of Australian dollars after the
country lowered interest rates.
   Other selected late dollar rates in New York compared with late
Friday rates included: 1.5262 German marks, up from 1.5243; 1.2905
Swiss francs, up from 1.2860; 5.1120 French francs, up from 5.1055;
1,143.00 Italian lire, up from 1,142.25; and 1.1540 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1471.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday
included: 1.5230 German marks, up from 1.5175; 1.2870 Swiss francs,
up from 1.2780; 5.1035 French francs, up from 5.0555; 1.7165 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.7110; 1,141.50 Italian lire, up from 1,137.25;
1.1520 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1470.
   Silver bullion for current delivery slipped to settle at $4.132
a troy ounce, down from $4.306 Friday.
   In London, silver fell to a late bid price of $4.22 a troy
ounce, down from $4.34 bid late Friday.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Decline In Calmer Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices declined in active but
calm trading Monday as the market sensed some easing of tensions in
the Persian Gulf.
   A drop in refinery demand for crude oil contributed to the
slide.
   The November contract for delivery of light sweet crude fell
$1.74 to $37.95 a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile
Exchange after dropping 73 cents on Friday.
   Analysts said trading was influenced by a Soviet report that
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein might be willing to withdraw his
troops from Kuwait in return for some Kuwaiti land bordering the
Persian Gulf.
   Peter Beutel, an oil market analyst with Pegasus Econometric
Group Inc., said the market believed tensions were lessening
somewhat. If that is the case, the likelihood of war would be
reduced, and so would a cutoff in oil supplies from the Gulf.
   However, the situation in the Gulf and the market remained
touch-and-go. ``Tomorrow morning may be a completely different
story,'' Beutel warned.
   Abundant supplies of crude oil and refined products also helped
bring prices down Monday.
   The November contract for home heating oil tumbled 3.29 cents to
$1.0207 a gallon, while wholesale unleaded regular gasoline slipped
2.18 cents to 94.95 cents a gallon. Both contracts advanced on
Friday.
   Refiners are currently retooling their equipment to turn out
more heating oil and less gasoline for the winter months. This
seasonal lull reduces the need for crude, and with traders feeling
more optimistic about the Middle East situation, allows
supply-and-demand forces to have an impact on trading.
   Beutel said technical forces were also at work in the market
Monday. Under current conditions, refiners are not willing to pay
$40 and more per barrel for oil, and are balking at the higher
prices, he said.
   In natural gas trading, the November contract closed at $1.900
per 1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.950 on Friday.

<HEAD>Precious Metal Debacle: Gold, Silver, Platinum Plummet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Silver prices hit new 14-year lows Monday and gold plunged to
its lowest level since before Iraq invaded Kuwait, reflecting new
hopes for peace in the Middle East and skepticism in the investment
value of precious mtals.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures fell; near-term orange
juice rebounded; grains and soybeans were lower; and livestock and
meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $12.50 to $14.20 lower on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for spot delivery at $375 an
ounce, the lowest spot gold price since Aug. 1.
   Silver futures ended 17.4 cents to 19.9 cents lower on the Comex
with October at $4.132 a troy ounce. Platinum plunged $22.80 to $23
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where the October contract
ended at $394.10 a troy ounce, platinum's first drop below $400
since early 1986.
   Analysts said the sell-off was partly triggered by a sharp drop
in petroleum prices that was in turn prompted by a Soviet press
report that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein might withdraw his troops
from Kuwait in exchange for some Kuwaiti territory on the Persian
Gulf.
   But analysts said the slide in gold, silver and platinum also
was an indication that more and more investors no longer view
precious metals as desirable assets in times of economic and
political uncertainty.
   Although the market is not following its traditional path,
``it's hard to imagine a scenario more bullish'' for precious
metals than the current situation, said Frederick Demler, metals
analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   ``Ten years ago we would have seen gold at $500 or $600,'' he
said.
   Analyst William O'Neill of Merrill Lynch Futures said gold- and
platinum-producing countries such as the Soviet Union and South
Africa were heavy sellers of those metals Monday.
   Monday's lower oil prices also were linked to expectations that
U.S. consumption of crude oil has begun to weaken on a seasonal
basis as refineries retool to produce more heating oil and less
gasoline, said Peter Beutel, energy analyst with the Pegasus
Econometric Group of Hoboken, N.J.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled 57 cents to $1.74 lower on
the New York Mercantile Exchange with November at $37.95 a barrel;
heating oil was 2.17 cents to 3.29 cents lower with November at
$1.0207 a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.55 cents to 2.7 cents
lower with November at 94.95 cents a gallon.
   Frozen concentrated orange juice for November delivery rose 4.5
cents to $1.1795 a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange,
rebounding from a loss of 16.45 cents Friday.
   All other orange juice contracts fell their permitted daily
limit of 5 cents, though, in a continued reaction to a government
report that predicted a bumper Florida orange crop.
   Harvest pressure helped push most grain and soybean futures
prices lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts said dry weekend weather in the Midwest allowed farmers
to get back into their fields to resume the soybean and corn
harvest, which was stalled by heavy rains early last week.
   An Agriculture Department report released after the close showed
the soybean harvest 40 percent complete and the corn harvest 32
percent complete as of Sunday. The progress rate was below average
for both crops.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1 cent to 3 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.65{ a bushel; corn was
1} cents to 2} cents lower with December at $2.28 a bushel; oats
were \ cent lower to } cent higher with December at $1.20 a bushel;
soybeans were 6{ cents lower to 1} cents higher with November at
$6.14 a bushel.
   Cattle futures finished narrowly mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Pork futures ended mostly lower, led by the pork belly
market, which erased limit gains amid expectations for sharply
lower cash prices next week.
   Live cattle settled .03 cent lower to .13 cent higher with
October at 78.97 cents a pound; feederccattle were .30 cent lower
to .15 cent higher with October at 87.32 cents a pound; live hogs
were .63 cent lower to .68 cent higher with October at 58.30 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .80 cent to 1.77 cents lower with
February at 65.42 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government bond prices closed slightly higher
Monday after a listless session.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond gained 7-32 point, or
$2.19 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices
rise, slipped to 8.93 percent from 8.95 percent late Friday.
   ``It has been an extraordinarily quiet day,'' said Susan Hering,
a Treasury bond economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.
   Government bond prices rose slightly when the market opened
after rising overseas, then slipped slightly and remained at
virtually the same level the rest of the day.
   Ms. Hering said the market had almost no reaction to news that
auto sales dropped 4.8 percent in the first 10 days of October. ``I
think people were expecting them to be weak, so that diffused the
impact,'' she said.
   Often, a sign of growing economic weakness boosts bond prices
because it makes it more likely the Federal Reserve will ease
interest rates.
   A dip in oil prices also had little impact, she added. Usually,
bond prices rise on signs that inflationary pressures may be
easing. Inflation is a major concern of bond investors since it
devalues the fixed-return securities.
   Ms. Hering said she believed bond investors were awaiting the
results of the ongoing budget negotiations in Washington and the
release Thursday of September consumer price figures.
   Also Monday, interest rates on short-term Treasury securities
sold at auction were virtually unchanged.
   The Treasury sold $9.4 billion in three-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.18 percent, down from 7.19 percent last
week. Another $9.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.22 percent, up from 7.21 percent last
week.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged to 3-32 point higher, intermediate
maturities rose from 1-16 point to 5-32 point, and long-term issues
were up as much as 7-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 1.23 to 1,147.99.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.37 percent as the
discount rose 2 basis points to 7.16 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 7.54 percent as the discount rate rose 4 basis points
to 7.18 percent. Yields on one-year bills remained at 7.56 percent
as the discount stood at 7.08 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 percent, up from 7~
percent late Friday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 88 1-32, up 3-32 from Friday. The
average yield to maturity fell to 7.83 percent from 7.84 percent.

   IBM said Monday its third-quarter profit jumped
almost 27 percent despite the economic downturn and persistent
sluggishness in the computer industry.
   However, Wall Street did not cheer the news and sent IBM's stock
price down $1 to close at $99.25 in New York Stock Exchange
trading.
   ``From what had been anticipated this was on the low side,''
analyst Stephen Cohen of SoundView Finanical Group Inc. in
Stamford., Conn., said of the earnings.
   International Business Machines Corp. said profit for the three
months ended Sept. 30 totaled $1.11 billion, or $1.95 a share, up
from $877 million, or $1.51 a share, in the same quarter last year.
   Revenue at the world's largest computer company rose nearly 7
percent to $15.28 billion, from $14.30 billion in the year-ago
period.
   Analysts expressed concern partly because IBM declined to say
how much its results benefited from the lower value of the dollar
during the quarter.
   IBM derives more than half its revenue and profit outside the
United States. A weaker dollar means overseas sales translate into
better results in dollar terms. Because of this, analysts want to
know whether the benefits of the weaker dollar are masking any
underlying trouble.
   In a conference call with analysts, IBM said it gained from the
dollar's decline but would not elaborate.
   Cohen estimated the boost amounted to 30 cents out of the $1.95
in per-share earnings. In addition, about 5 cents came from lower
federal tax rates this year. With this in mind, he said, ``1.95
does not look like that big a number.''
   IBM's product sales slipped 1.5 percent to $9.01 billion, but
revenue from support services, software, equipment rental and
financing posted double-digit increases over the year-earlier
quarter.
   IBM, based in suburban Armonk, told analysts that sales of
personal computers were unchanged during the third quarter. While
this came as little surprise, analysts said it presented one more
worry as the economy declines.
   IBM also told analysts that revenue from mainframe computers was
not as robust as other products because of the transition to the
new System-390 mainframe line, announced in September. IBM said it
hasn't been able to meet demand for the powerful, new-generation
machines, crimping revenue, said John Jones, an analyst at
Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco.
   Jones called the decline in IBM's stock price a ``bear-market
knee jerk.''
   ``Some people may have hoped that IBM would come through with a
big surprise,'' he said.
   In a statement, IBM Chairman John F. Akers said the company was
seeing the benefits of a cost-cutting plan announced late last
year. The restructuring, which includes the elimination of about
10,000 jobs and plant consolidations, was prompted by the computer
industry slowdown.
   ``Our portfolio of products and services, which is the strongest
in our history, and our geographic diversity are serving us well,''
Akers said. ``Assuming no further deterioration in the world's
economies, we continue to expect substantially improved financial
performance for 1990.''
   For the year's first nine months, IBM reported a profit of $3.56
billion, or $6.21 a share, up 12 percent from $3.17 billion, or
$5.43 a share in the 1989 period.
   Revenue for the nine months totaled $46.0 billion, up almost 9percent
from $42.2 billion in the same period a year earlier.
   Meanwhile Monday, NCR Corp., another major computer maker, said
profit slipped 3 percent in the third quarter due to a
share-repurchase program.
   NCR, based in Dayton, Ohio, said it earned $91 million, or $1.36
a share, down from from $94 million, or $1.23 a share, in the
year-earlier quarter.
   Revenue rose 9 percent to a record $1.52 billion, from $1.39
billion a year earlier.
   NCR said it repurchased 2.2 million common shares during the
quarter under a continuing stock buyback program. That increased
earnings per share while decreasing net income, it said.
   For the first nine months, profit was $258 million, or $3.73 a
share, a 3 percent decrease from $265 million, or $3.40 a share, a
year earlier.
   Revenue increased 5 percent to $4.39 billion from last year's
$4.17 billion.
   Charles E. Exley Jr., NCR's chairman and chief executive, said
the company didn't expect profit to increase for the entire year
due to disappointing domestic orders in the second and third
quarters.

   United Airlines announced plans Monday to buy as
many as 128 new Boeing aircraft to rejuvenate and expand its fleet
in an order worth at least $11 billion and potentially a record $22
billion or more.
   The deal includes Boeing's new 777 model, the first-ever order
for that plane, and represented a significant coup for Boeing over
its leading competitors, McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus
Industrie of Europe.
   It also came a week after a protracted employee effort to buy
United failed, and seemed to signify an attempt by one of the
nation's leading airlines to refocus attention on its long-term
competitive position.
   ``This purchase will allow United to replace older aircraft as
well as expand both its domestic and international services,'' said
Stephen Wolf, chairman of Chicago-based UAL Corp., United's parent
company.
   ``In short, it will ensure that this company is positioned to
compete aggressively around the world,'' Wolf said,
   The agreement includes firm orders for 34 Boeing model 777s and
30 Boeing 747-400s, with a total value of about $11 billion.
   In addition, United has the option to purchase an additional 34
model 777s and 30 model 747-400s. If all those options were
excercised, the total value of the purchase would swell to at least
$22 billion and make it the largest order in history.
   For United customers, Wolf said, the order means ``more service
to more destinations in the world's newest, most modern and
efficient aircraft.''
   ``For our shareholders, it means more revenue growth'' to be
reflected in increased shareholder value.
   Wolf declined to discuss plans for financing the order. But he
said it wouldn't affect employee contract negotiations.
   ``We don't intend to ask them to make concessons to pay for the
fleet,'' he said. ``We anticipate raises.''
   Wolf said the expansion ``provides a sense of security'' for
United's 74,000 employees.
   United said it chose Pratt &amp; Whitney 4000 engines to power the
aircraft. Assembly on the 777s is to start in late 1992. As they
are delivered, United said, they will replace the company's DC-10
aircraft on domestic routes and provide expansion capacity.
   Delivery of the 747-400 aircraft would start in 1994. A number
of 747-400s from a previous order are expected before that and will
be used for continued expansion of United's international market.
   Wolf said the company would more than double its service to
Europe in 1991 by adding destinations.
   A large United purchase had been expected for some time,
although the uncertainty of the buyout negotiations with employees
had raised questions about the timing and size. It was well known
throughout the industry that Boeing, Airbus and McDonnell Douglas
were competing aggressively for the order.
   ``The importance of today's commitment for Boeing cannot be
overstated,'' Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief executive
officer, said in a statement from the aircraft maker's Seattle
headquarters.
   ``With a ratification by Boeing's board on Oct. 29, this order
will launch an all-new 777 aircraft family - which will set a new
standard for very large twin-engine operations around the world.''
   Boeing Commercial Airplane Group spokesman Richard Schleh said
the 777, designed to fill a market niche between the 747-400 and
the existing 767-300 wide-body, will be 209 feet long and have a
wingspan of 197 feet. United's 777s will seat 363 passengers.
   Boeing plans to build the 777 at its Everett, Wash., wide-body
plant north of Seattle, Schleh said. It now has about 3,400
employees working on the plane.
   Shrontz said the buildup in the 777 program will mean 8,000 to
10,000 jobs. But not all will be new jobs, he said, because some
will come from other company operations.
   Like other leading airlines, United has been seeking to
replenish its fleet with younger airplanes that are more fuel
efficient and require less costly maintenance than their aging
predecessors.
   The latest order is United's third in 18 months. United's last
aircraft order, for 370 narrow-body Boeing jetliners, was in April
1989.
   UAL spokeswoman Sara Dornacker said the average age of United's
fleet was 12.7 years at the end of August compared with 13.6 years
a year earlier.
   The largest order in the industry, excluding options to purchase
aircraft, is $16.8 billion, made in April 1989 by an Ireland-based
aircraft leasing company, GPA Group Ltd. It ordered a total of 308
planes from Boeing, Airbus Industrie and McDonnell Douglas.
   United had come close to placing its wide-body aircraft order
earlier this year but postponed the plans in July at the request of
UAL's unions, which were then still in the midst of leading an
attempt to buy the airline.
   Last week, the employees failed to get bank financing for a $4.4
billion bid, prompting UAL's board to reject their offer.

<HEAD>Apple Computer Introduces New Lower-Priced Macintoshes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREMONT, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As expected, Apple Computer Inc. on
Monday unveiled a lower-cost line of its popular Macintosh
machines, tempting consumers but worrying investors and dealers.
   Apple priced the Macintosh Classic at about $1,000, the
Macintosh LC at $2,500 and the Macintosh IIsi starting at about
$3,800. However, shoppers can expect better deals after retailers
discount the products, experts say.
   ``We are prepared to do whatever it takes to reach more people
with Macintosh,'' said Brodie Keast, an Apple product marketing
manager. ``The plan is to get as aggressive on price as we need to
be.''
   Analysts said the strategy will work only if the Cupertino-based
company sells enough computers to offset the smaller profit margins
on them.
   The risks are making investors jittery that Apple won't be able
to make changes necessary to thrive on lower margins. Apple's stock
closed Monday at $27.75 a share in national over-the-counter
trading, down 50 cents from Friday and well off its 12-month high
of $50.37{.
   The new computers, unveiled at Apple's factory in Fremont, also
are raising concerns among Apple's 1,700 authorized dealers. They
worry that they ultimately will lose business if Apple, in its
effort to boost sales, recruits more dealers or sells through
retail outlets previously shunned, analysts said.
   ``Clearly, this is something Apple is evaluating,'' said Walter
J. Winnitzki, an analyst for the brokerage firm Brown Brothers
Harriman &amp; Co. in New York.
   The base Macintosh Classic, available immediately, comes with 1
megabyte of memory and a floppy disk drive. Another version for
about $500 more offers 2 megabytes of memory and a 40-megabyte hard
disk drive. Both versions feature the processor and black-and-white
video screen in a single unit.
   The Macintosh LC comes with 2 megabytes of memory and a
40-megabyte hard dis drive. It will be available in limited
numbers until January, when production is stepped up.
   The Macintosh IIsi, a lower-cost version of Apple's more
powerful business computers, is available immediately.
   Both the LC and IIsi models are available with either
black-and-white or color screens.
   ``To reach new customers, we didn't just lower the prices of our
existing products. We redesigned these computers from the ground up
with the features customers have told us they value most,'' said
John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive officer.

   The Air Line Pilots Association is opening a
long-planned television and radio campaign to burnish its members'
professional image in the immediate aftermath of the conviction of
three pilots for flying while drunk.
   The campaign theme: ``Safety is a daily commitment.''
   The $250,000 cost to buy air time for the commercials was paid
for by individual contributions from 2,500 pilots, said Capt. Henry
Duffy, president of the association that's also the pilots' labor
union.
   Although the advertising campaign was conceived two years ago,
it follows widespread negative publicity from the arrest and
conviction of three Northwest Airline pilots for intoxication while
flying.
   One of them testified he had consumed up to 20 rum and Diet
Cokes at a lounge the night before piloting a flight from Fargo,
N.D. to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport.
   ``We go quickly by 19,000 successes and focus on an occasional
slip,'' Duffy said, referring to the number of flights safely
concluded each day in the United States.
   ``Pilots have the feeling that there is no understanding of how
much training they undergo, of how many checks they are subject to
and how many physicals they've had to take,'' he said.
   ``I think any time the media focuses on some negative aspect of
the aviation industry there are going to be questions in the public
mind,'' Duffy said. ``We want to balance that with the high level
of competence in the cockpits.''
   Duffy said the association's ``image enhancement campaign'' was
prompted by concerns expressed by many of the 42,000 pilots who
belong to the association.
   ``Pilots themselves aren't at all good in being their own PR
agents,'' Duffy said. ``No matter how skillful a feat of airmanship
a pilot performs, you'll usually only hear him or her say, ``I was
just doing my job.''
   The television commercial will be aired 150 times on CNN
Headline News from Oct. 22 to Nov. 18. and is aimed, Duffy said, at
business travelers, ``our key target audience.''
   It also will be shown on the late evening news in Miami,
Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Atlanta.
   The radio commercial will be broadcast beginning the week of
Oct. 22 with sponsorship of games 4, 5 and 6 of the World Series on
the CBS Radio Network. It also will be aired on the Mutual Radio
Network during college and professional football shows, talk shows
and news reports.
   The 30-second television commercial cuts from the cockpit where
the crew calmly carries out its duties to the cabin where a little
girl plays with a teddy bear and naps.
   The narrator: ``More than a million people rely on us every day.
It takes experience, ability and dedication to be a professional
airline pilot.''

<HEAD>Boeing Launches 777, Its First All-New Aircraft in 12 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>

   A huge order Monday from United Airlines
gave The Boeing Co. the go-ahead for its new 777 jetliner, a plane
Boeing hopes will be the basis of a new, high-tech family of
aircraft for the early 21st century.
   The twin-engine plane, slightly smaller than a 747 jumbo jet, is
the first all-new aircraft to be launched by Boeing since 1978. To
build the jet, Boeing plans to add as many as 6,500 more jobs in
the Seattle area over the next four years.
   United ordered 34 of the jets and took options on another 34 as
part of a 128-plane order potentially worth more than $22 billion.
United also bought 30 Boeing 747-400s and optioned 30 more in what
would be the largest commercial aircraft purchase in history if all
options are exercised.
   At a news conference, Chris Longridge, Boeing Commercial
Airplane Group executive vice president for sales, called the order
``mind-boggling.''
   The total value of all Boeing's announced orders in 1987 was
$19.9 billion, a company record at the time, he noted.
   Longridge said Boeing already is talking about building a
``family'' of 777 aircraft and has proposed a version that could
haul 300-320 people up to 7,600 miles. The next logical step would
be a stretch version to carry more than 400 passengers, Longridge
said, adding that ``some operators have been talking to us about
that.''
   Boeing designed the 777 to fill a market niche between its
767-300 and 747 widebodies.
   It's big. It will seat 360-390 passengers in two classes,
compared to a 747-400, which holds 412 people in three classes.
   At 209 feet, the 777wwill be about 23 feet shorter than a 747.
But its body will be 2 inches wider at 20 feet, 4 inches, and its
197-foot wingspan 2 feet more than the jumbo jet's. Each engine
will be 20 percent more powerful than those of a 747 and large
enough to swallow the body of a mid-sized jetliner.
   The most visible change from previous models will be the folding
wingtips that will allow the jet to use airport gates now used by
mid-sized planes.
   But the plane will have an all-new wing and fuel-stingy engines
that Alan Mulally, vice president of engineering for Boeing's New
Airplane Division, says will make it 30 percent to 40 percent more
fuel-efficent than existing DC-10s and L-1011s.
   To save weight, the plane will make extensive use of composite
materials rather than metal.
   Airlines today order jets 10 years in advance and expect to fly
them another 20 years after that. For that reason, Mulally said
Boeing's potential customers wanted the 777 design to be as
flexible as possible.
   The 777 will be plumbed and wired to allow galleys and
lavatories for different seating patterns. Seats can be placed
anywhere from five to 10 abreast.
   The 777 will have a range of up to 4,800 statute miles. That
compares with the long-range 767-300, which can carry 261
passengers in mixed classes 7,200 miles, and the 747-400, the
world's largest commercial jet, which can fly 8,000 miles.
   Three Japanese companies - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki
Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries - will build large
portions of the plane's fuselage. The companies also build part of
the 767.
   Longridge said the 777 program eventually will employ 8,000 to
10,000 people, with assembly at Boeing's Everett widebody plant.
About 3,400 are working on it now. Boeing, which has about 100,000
workers in the Seattle area, has been trimming its workforce and
the new jobs could offset that somewhat, he said.
   Although it's introduced several variations of existing models,
the last all-new planes Boeing brought out were the mid-sized 757
and the 767 in 1978.
   United and Boeing struck their deal Sunday night, Longridge
said, after the airline heard last-minute presentations by Boeing
and competitors McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Airbus Industrie.
   United long was rumored to be the initial 777 customer. The
company postponed its order last July at the request of its unions,
which were making an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to buy the
carrier.
   Longridge said Boeing is discussing possible 777 sales with
American Airlines, Delta Airlines, Cathay Pacific, British Airways,
Qantas, Japan Air Lines and All Nippon Airways. He said it's likely
All Nippon could make its decision within the next few weeks.

<HEAD>Judge Strikes Down $500 Million Bond Approval for PSNH Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Monday struck down state
approval for Northeast Utilities to issue $500 million in bonds to
help pay for its $2.3 billion takeover of bankrupt Public Service
Company of New Hampshire.
   Merrimack County Superior Court Judge Kenneth McHugh said
approval of the bonds by the state Industrial Development
Authority, Gov. Judd Gregg and the Executive Council was
``arbitrary, unreasonable and capricious.''
   He ordered the IDA to hold a public hearing on the bond
application.
   The state is reviewing the ruling and has not decided whether to
appeal.
   McHugh issued his ruling on a complaint by the Campaign for
Ratepayer's Rights, which has opposed the Seabrook nuclear plant
built by Public Service and has fought electricity rate hikes
planned to help pay for the $6.6 billion plant.
   The Executive Council, which is elected to review certain
appropriations, approved the pollution-control bonds 5-0 several
weeks ago on recommendation of the IDA. The bonds, half of which
are tax exempt, are among a number of bond issues Northeast
Utilities, of Berlin, Conn., planned to use to finance its friendly
takeover of PSNH.
   McHugh earlier rejected as premature a petition by the Campaign
and others to block the bonds. But he said the court would review
their claims before the bonds are issued.
   McHugh ruled only on whether the public had been given a proper
chance to participate in the IDA decision.
   Utility and authority officials denied the allegation. They said
they had reviewed the process carefully and were confident of its
legality.

   The Canadian Auto Workers union prepared to open
contract talks with Chrysler Canada Ltd. on Monday after reaching
new contracts with Canadian subsidiaries of General Motors Corp.
and Ford Motor Co.
   The union represents about 10,000 Chrysler workers in Canada.
   In the United States, Chrysler Canada's parent company, Chrysler
Corp., is negotiating with the United Auto Workers for a new
national agreement covering about 63,000 workers in what could be
tough talks.
   ``The company has made a lot of money in Canada,'' CAW spokesman
Larry Bauer said. ``If we listened to them every time they pleaded
poverty, we'd be making $2 an hour.'' Chyrsler's unionized Canadian
workers currently make more than $17 an hour.
   The CAW, like the UAW, expects to sign very similar agreements
with each of the Big Three automakers.
   The CAW's contracts with Ford and GM Canadian subsidiaries call
for annual wage increases of 7.5 percent, 6.7 percent and 4.8
percent in each of the three years of the contract.
   In the United States, the pattern agreement reached with GM and
Ford provides for a 3-percent wage increase in the first year and
lump-sum payments equal to 3 percent of wages in the second and
third years.
   Chrysler Canada spokesman Lois McTavish said it was irrelevant
to compare the company's contract talks with negotiations under way
in the United States.
   ``There are two completely independent, separate sets of
negotiations, issues and unions,'' McTavish said. ``And we'll have
to wait and see if we'll agree to a contract similar to Ford's and
GM's.''

<HEAD>Winnebago Reports Record Loss for Fiscal Year, 5th Straight
Quarterly Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FOREST CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Winnebago Industries Inc.'s bottom line
improved in the most recent quarter, but the motor home company
still had a $3.8 million loss on sagging sales.
   The market for recreational vehicles has been sent into a
tailspin by soaring gasoline prices and fears of a recession, a
combination that leaves consumers reluctant to spend $27,000 and up
on a motor home.
   The quarterly loss was Winnebago's fifth consecutive.
   The company recently offered gasoline rebates to new customers
in an attempt to revive its slumping business.
   Winnebago's loss in the quarter ended Aug. 25 came to 15 cents a
share, compared with a loss of almost $11.3 million, or 46 cents a
share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Revenue slipped 4
percent to $85.9 million from $89.5 million.
   For the full fiscal year, the loss came to $17.8 million, or 72
cents a share, and surpassed the previous record loss of $13.5
million in fiscal 1980, another period when gas prices soared and
the economy contracted. A year ago, Winnebago had a loss of almost
$4.7 million, or 19 cents a share. Revenue fell 23.4 percent on the
year to $335.1 million from $437.5 million.
   Winnebago makes recreational and commercial vehicles and its
Cycle-Sat subsidiary delivers television commercials by satellite.
   The fourth fiscal quarter loss was aggravated by a settlement of
an Internal Revenue Service audit that increased the net loss by
$2.3 million, said Fred Dohrmann, Winnebago's chief operating
officer.
   Results for the fiscal year were hurt by reduced sales volume
for recreational vehicles and operating losses at the company's new
commercial vehicle business and at Cycle-Sat, Dohrmann said.
   But he said the company had operating income from its
recreational vehicle division in the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year.
   Winnebago said it has been able to substantially increase sales
volume of the Winnebago Warrior and Itasca Spirit micro-mini motor
homes.
   In an attempt to reassure customers spooked at the gas pump,
Winnebago last week guaranteed to rebate gasoline expenses above
99.9 cents a gallon for new motor homes purchased through the end
of the year. The rebates will be in effect for 12 months or 12,000
miles, whichever comes first.
   Winnebago also laid off 1,500 workers at Forest City at the end
of last month because of high inventories of unsold recreational
vehicles. On Monday, it called back 1,000 workers, but said there
were no plans yet to bring back the remaining 500 idled workers.
