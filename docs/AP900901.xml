   A new law will allow Greece to try a
Palestinian the United States wants extradited in connection with
the bombing of an American airliner, a member of Parliament says.
   The bill was approved unanimously by an all-party parliamentary
committee Friday and will become law after a debate in Parliament
next week, said the lawmaker, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The legislation appeared designed to prevent the extradition of
Palestinian Mohammed Rashid, wanted by the United Sates for
allegedly planting a bomb that exploded in a Pan Am airliner flying
over Hawaii in 1982. A Japanese teenager was killed by the blast
and 15 other passengers were wounded.
   The Rashid affair has become a sensitive issue between Greece
and the United States since his arrest at Athens Airport in 1988.
He has been awaiting extradition since May 1989.

   Hungary's Prime Minister Josef Antall
says Soviet compensation demands for withdrawing troops from his
country are unreasonable.
   Antall on Friday also threatened that Hungary would leave the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact if it remained a military organization.
   ``We want to abolish the military structure of the Warsaw Pact.
If this doesn't happen we will leave it by the end of next year,''
Antall said in an interview broadcast on Finnish national radio.
   Antall said the Soviet Union demanded over $4 million for
facilities and equipment left behind by 50,000 Soviet soldiers who
have begun withdrawing from Hungary, which elected a non-communist
government in March.
   ``We think these demands are unreasonable as they (the soldiers)
have used old Hungarian buildings, damaged them and polluted the
environment,'' said Antall, in Helsinki for a meeting of
conservative European leaders.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Renews Debate on Sweden's Neutrality</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVA JANZON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The detention of Swedes in Iraq has
revived the debate over Stockholm's traditional policy of
neutrality. Some Swedes, angry after seeing their captive
countrymen on TV, are demanding military action.
   A few young men have even called the U.S. Embassy in Stockholm,
volunteering to join international forces blockading Iraq. Other
Swedes suggest their country contribute forces to the military
buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   Successive Swedish governments have argued in favor of
neutrality, allowing the country to play a mediating role in some
conflicts.
   It has also protected Swedes. Often citizens of neutral
countries have been allowed to leave hot spots while other
nationalities are detained.
   Pehr G. Gyllenhammar, head of the Volvo car manufacturing
empire, is one of those calling for a reevaluation of the politics
of neutrality.
   ``The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait ... has shown a new unity between
countries which earlier were in conflict with each other,'' he
wrote in the Dagens Nyheter newspaper.
   ``In this situation Sweden passes, as usual. As usual we refer
to our policy of neutrality,'' he said. ``As usual we indicate a
`special role of mediator' which has influenced (Iraqi President)
Saddam Hussein's decision to release Swedes, while holding as
hostages the citizens of nations which protest and are willing to
take risks.''
   Iraq has seemed to take neutrality into account in its treatment
of foreigners. When Saddam said Wednesday that Western women and
children would be allowed to leave, Finns were the first to go.
   In addition, groups of Finns, Swedes and Austrians were released
from Iraq last week, while most other Westerners remained captive.
But the exodus was suddenly stopped. More than 100 Swedes, many
male employees of Swedish firms, were being held in Iraq.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anita Matejovsky said some of about
50 Swedish women and children in Iraq received exit visas Friday
and that the rest were promised theirs on Saturday, she said.
   Government officials say Swedes have been held because the
country supports U.N. sanctions against Iraq. They reject
suggestions that their policy toward Saddam is milder than that of
other Western nations.
   ``We are not neutral in this crisis,'' Prime Minister Ingvar
Carlsson said Tuesday.
   Finland and Sweden say they, like other nations, are refusing to
close their embassies in occupied Kuwait, as Iraq has demanded. But
the embassy buildings have actually been emptied.
   Carlsson endured tough questioning on the subject during a
nationally televised news conference Tuesday. He was asked whether
$8.7 million in aid to Persian Gulf refugees was intended as
compensation for the absence of Swedish military help.
   Journalists also asked whether Sweden was not acting sharply
against Iraq because it still hoped to get its citizens out.
   ``We have acted sharply already. We are not proceeding mildly in
this question,'' said Carlsson, barely containing his anger.
   But he said Sweden would not send military forces unless the
United Nations specifically requests them.
   Sweden, which has not fought a war in 176 years, has contributed
more than 55,000 men to U.N. peacekeeping operations.
   Swedes have been debating the ramifications of their neutrality
policy since World War II. At that time, Nazi troops were allowed
to cross Swedish territory into occupied Norway, but Allied forces
were not given access to help Finland in its Winter War with the
Soviet Union.
   Independence-minded Lithuanians, Estonians and Latvians are
still bitter about Sweden's acceptance of the Soviet Union's
annexation of the Baltic states in 1940. Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis, on a trip through Nordic countries during the
past week, has been comparing Iraq's annexation of Kuwait to his
country's fate.
   In one appearance, he asked ``whether Sweden, in the name of
realist politics, would be willing to hand Kuwait to Iraq after a
year of annexation.''
   ``Because of today's international situation (of East-West
detente), there is a tendency to question the dogma of
neutrality,'' said Wilhelm Agrell, an associate professor of peace
and conflict studies at the University of Lund.
   ``The Iraq crisis tests a new international position for Sweden,
and also for many other countries,'' said Agrell. ``Sweden has
answered with confusion and delay and crouches down behind the fact
that it is a small country.''

<HEAD>Stranded Kuwaiti Students Do More Worrying Than Studying</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Saturday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By LISA LEVITT RYCKMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Homesick and heartsick over the Iraqi invasion of their country,
stranded Kuwaiti students are doing more worrying than studying,
and some have dropped out to join the fight.
   ``Studying comes second now,'' said Osamah Al-Tuwairesh, one of
14 Kuwaiti students at the University of Southern California last
semester. ``The first thing we think about is getting our country
back.''
   Students and other Kuwaiti nationals began gathering in
Washington, D.C., on Friday for a conference to discuss their
country's situation. The meeting, expected to draw up to 1,500
people, ends on Sunday.
   ``Ever since the first day of August all my friends have talked
about going back and joining the resistance,'' said Al-Tuwairesh,
president of the 110-member Southern California branch of the
National Union of Kuwaiti Students. He said he knows at least a
dozen students who have traveled to Saudi Arabia since the invasion.
   ``The first day this happened, some students started collecting
names of people saying they were ready to go,'' said Abdul-Hamid
Khudada, a graduate architectural engineering student at Penn
State. ``That's the least we could do. It's not fair the Americans
and others go to fight for our country, and we don't fight.''
   The Kuwaiti embassy has tried to encourage the more than 1,200
students at U.S. universities and colleges to stay in school,
despite possible financial hardships caused by a cut-off of funds
from their oil-rich government, which had supplied many with
scholarships and living stipends.
   ``They don't want people just to back there and get killed,''
Al-Tuwairesh said. ``The students really don't have any military
training.''
   The embassy is working on ways to pay the students' bills, and
many schools have agreed to defer tuition, dormitory and book costs
for the moment. Others are offering loans and helping the Kuwaitis
find jobs; the Immigration and Naturalization Service is allowing
them to work 20 hours a week during the crisis.
   ``The university did everything possible to help,'' said
Univeristy of New Mexico architecture student Jamal Al-Hajji.
``They told me, `If you want a job in school we can arrange it for
you.' And they can give me a loan.''
   Central Michigan University also has agreed to defer payments
for its 15 Kuwaiti students, said Sharon George, director of the
International Student Services. ``In return, the Kuwaiti students
are very, very thankful,'' she said. ``They are a gracious people
and a proud country. They are not used to being cared for.''
   Saif Abdullah of the Kuwaiti embassy in Washington said they are
collecting donations and have reduced the usual stipends by about
40 percent. ``The students will go through some hardship until
everything is OK,'' he said.
   But financial worries pale next to family ones. Many students
have not heard from relatives since the Aug. 2 invasion.
   ``I'm so worried,'' said Saud Abdullaziz, a senior at the
University of San Francisco who last spoke to his parents and
brother in Kuwait City the day before the Iraqis moved in. ``I'm
thinkng of canceling this semester and going back to check on my
family. I am just thinking all the time about home.''
   Anwar Al-Mudhat, a doctoral candidate in finance and investment
at Claremont Graduate School, said his fellow students can do more
for their country by staying here than by returning home.
   ``It's a noble thing to do, but most of these people aren't
trained,'' Al-Mudhat said. ``Besides, we need these people here in
the United States to present our people's case to case to the
American public. And this by itself is a noble thing.''

   When the airmen yelled ``Go get 'em
Gen'rul!'' H. Norman Schwarzkopf couldn't resist.
   ``We'll get 'em all right,'' he said. Then he turned quickly to
correct himself, mindful of his mission, and the group of reporters
trailing him.
   ``We're going to get them _ when they come across the border,''
said the commander of the U.S. forces marshalling in Saudi Arabia
south of the border with Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   Schwarzkopf, who set up his command post in Saudi Arabia just
days ago, paid his first visit to the troops in the field Friday.
   His nickname is ``Bear'' and he can be blunt and gruff. But on
Friday he tried a more grandfatherly approach, putting his arm
around troops and commanders alike.
   He assured them of the world's support, and promised to make
their stay in the desert as comfortable as possible as they face
off against the Iraqis who invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   He had a simple message to the troops.
   ``Our job is to get it over as fast as we can,'' he told a group
of airmen.
   After Air Force A-10 pilots told him their tank-killing jets
could exact a heavy toll on the Iraqi armored divisions,
Schwarzkopf nooded in approval before fighting good-naturedly for
his branch of the service.
   ``Try and leave a few for the army, will you?'' he quipped as he
left.
   Schwarzkopf spoke softly when telling a group of Marines about
the crash of one of the huge C-5 Galaxy transports in West Germany
on Wednesday in the Operation Desert Shield airlift. Thirteen of
the 17 Americans aboard were killed.
   He can shift gears quickly.
   At the news conference, he was asked if the United States was
getting military help from Israel, the enemy of the Arab world.
   ``No,'' was the answer. Next question.
   He said he wasn't worried about U.S. troops adjusting to the
desert climate, where temperatures can shoot up to 120 degrees.
   ``They're not potted plants or greenhouse shrubs,'' he chided.
   For Iraqi forces, Schwarzkopf had nothing but bad wishes. But he
delivered them in an animated exchange with reporters.
   ``I hope they're hungry. And I hope they're thirsty. And I hope
they're out of ammo,'' he said. ``And I hope they feel bad about
what they did, because they should.''

<HEAD>Japan Still Unwilling to Take On Responsibilities of Global
Leadership</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japan's reaction to the Persian Gulf crisis reveals
a nation still not ready to take on the responsibilities of global
leadership despite its status as an economic superpower.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu announced Wednesday, nearly one
month after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, an aid package of nearly
$1 billion for the U.S.-led force arrayed against Iraq and further
assistance to Middle East countries hurt by the embargo on Baghdad.
   Robert Orr, director of the Stanford Japan Center in Kyoto, says
Japan's policy formulation was largely a matter of deciding what
could be done to placate Washington.
   ``I don't think that's the way a great power should be
operating,'' Orr said Friday. ``The Japanese still really do not
have a global perspective.''
   Japanese bureaucrats can expect further pressure from the United
States, which had applauded the package as an initial contribution
to the gulf forces. Washington has urged Tokyo to provide
transportation for military cargo.
   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 has shown that the
Japanese political system is ill-equipped to cope with the quick
decision-making required in responding to international crises.
   Bureaucratic infighting between powerful ministries has made it
difficult to reach a consensus, a cherished goal of political life
here.
   ``In effect, they were arguing when they should have taken
action,'' The Japan Times newspaper said in an editorial.
   And Kaifu, despite strong showings in public opinion polls, does
not have the power base within the governing Liberal Democratic
Party to easily push through his own agenda.
   ``Throughout the process of determining its contribution to the
Middle East, (Japan) has never made clear what its basic policy
is,'' the newspaper Mainichi Shimbun wrote Friday.
   Kaifu has acknowledged the country's ``growing responsibility''
in the world and awareness of growing impatience with the pace of
Tokyo's response.
   ``If our response was delayed any further, I was afraid we would
give the impression to the world that Japan is not doing anything
about this serious problem,'' he said after unveiling the package.
   Behind the weeks of waiting for a Japanese aid program to emerge
was a heated debate over what could be done under the post-World
War II constitution that bars the use of force in settling
international disputes.
   There is strong public opinion in Japan and throughout Asia
against any action that could lead to Japanese military activity
overseas.
   Triggered by the U.S. pressure, bureaucrats and politicians are
debating a change of the country's laws that would make it easier
for Japan to respond to future crises in a decisive matter, but
which critics charge could led to a violation of the constitution.
   A government official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the legal review was unprecedented and indicates that Japan's
reaction to the Middle East tension is charting new ground for the
country.
   Any proposed revisions are sure to meet with strong opposition
in the Parliament, where the Japan Socialist Party is the largest
opposition group.
   A senior Socialist recently said of the crisis: ``It is an ideal
time for Japan to show the spirit of our peace constitution.''

<HEAD>Banks Have To Give Quicker Access To Deposits Under New Law Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank customers, beginning today, will be
guaranteed quicker access to their deposits under the final
installment of a 3-year-old federal law that the banking industry
is trying to get changed.
   At issue is the Expected Funds Availability Act, legislation
passed by Congress in 1987 to prevent banks from imposing lengthy
delays before customers were allowed access to deposited funds.
   Beginning Sept. 1, banks will be required to meet shorter time
limits for making funds available on deposited checks.
   Local checks must be cleared by the bank in two business days,
down from three days currently. Non-local checks must be cleared in
five business days, down from the current seven business days.
   A local check is defined as one written on an institution in the
same metropolitan area or within the same Federal Reserve check
processing region.
   The previous three-day and seven-day limits had been in effect
for the past two years and were instituted as interim standards to
give banks time to prepare for the more stringent final regulations.
   Many banks are already processing checks in the shorter time
periods going into effect today. Those banks that have been using
the longer interim standards will be required to notify their
customers within the next 30 days that their funds will be
available more quickly.
   In addition to the changes affecting regular checks, money
deposited in the form of cashiers' checks, certified checks and
government checks must be available to depositors by 9 a.m. the
next business day. This represents no change from the interim
regulations.
   The law guaranteeing bank customers quicker access to their
money was passed after a long lobbying campaign in which consumer
groups presented examples of banks freezing funds for as long as
two or three weeks, a practice banks referred to as putting a
``hold'' on deposited checks.
   The U.S. Public Interest Research Group, which lobbied
aggressively for the 1987 law, said banks were making $290 million
annually in interest on the money withheld from customers during
the so-called ``float period,'' the time between when the bank got
credit for the funds and when it released the money for use by the
depositor.
   The consumer research group charged that banks were collecting
another $145 million a year in bounced-check fees because funds
weren't released faster for depositors' use.
   In the two years in which the interim regulations have been in
effect, consumer groups contend the law has allowed depositors with
interest-bearing accounts to make millions of dollars more because
of the shorter ``hold'' periods on checks.
   ``We think the law is working well to make the holdup at the
bank a thing of the past,'' said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer advocate
at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
   However, banking groups have been lobbying Congress to make
changes in the law. A bill giving banks more leeway was approved by
the Senate Banking Committee in July.
   Under that measure, which is expected to be taken up by the full
Senate in September, banks for the next four years would be given a
longer processing time for certain checks deposited at automated
teller machines.
   Mark Serepca, a spokesman for the American Bankers' Association,
said a recent survey by his organization found that 20 percent of
banks will just stop accepting deposits at teller machines unless
the customer has an account at the bank whose teller machine he is
using.
   ``Many banks are telling us they won't offer the expanded
service any more because they fear the risk of too many bad
checks,'' Serepca said.
   While consumer groups said they would be willing to accept
longer processing time for certain automated teller deposits, they
vowed to fight another proposal that would keep the processing time
for all local checks at three days instead of the two-day limit
taking effect today.
   Mierzwinski said such a change isn't necessary because surveys
done by the Federal Reserve, which administers the law, showed that
up to 75 percent of banks are already processing local checks
without difficulties within the two-day limit.

<TEXT>
   President Bush calls it ``the shape of the
post-postwar world.'' To a degree unknown for generations, the
nations of the world are working together in the interest of peace,
not only in the Persian Gulf but in bloodstained Cambodia as well.
   Gone, at least for the moment, are the superpower rivalries that
often blocked cooperation to settle regional conflicts during the
post World War II era that came to be tagged the ``Cold War.''
   But the new world Bush talks about is sure to contain its own
chills and frustrations for the United States. For example, a world
in which international cooperation is the norm is one in which
unilateral action is condemned.
   How much has the world changed in the nine months since Bush's
unilateral decision to remove Manuel Antonio Noriega from power in
Panama?
   Or since Ronald Reagan's decision to invade Grenada? Or Leonid
Brezhnev's decision to send Soviet troops into Afghanistan?
   Does the swift mobilizing of an international force to block
Saddam Hussein give reason to think prospects are heightened for an
international effort to finally bring peace to the Middle East?
   ``What is at stake here is truly significant,'' Bush said
Thursday. He cited ``the dependability of America's commitments to
its friends and allies, the shape of the post-postwar world,
opposition to aggression, the potential domination of the energy
resources that are crucial to the entire world.''
   He spoke in the context of announcing that he was asking Japan,
West Germany, Korea, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and
free Kuwait for financial and energy resources to support the
Persian Gulf mobilization.
   That request opens another area of international involvement.
Presumably, nations that agree to pay part of the cost will also
want a role in the decision making.
   At this time of widespread agreement on how to proceed in
response to the Iraqi aggression, that wouldn't seem much of a
problem. But suppose Saddam Hussein is able to hold out, resist the
blockade and keep his troops in Kuwait indefinitely? Will the
world's unanimity continue?
   Should Iraq yield to international pressure and withdraw from
Kuwait, will there be unanimity on the shape of the post-invasion
Persian Gulf? Would a return to the status quo, a Kuwait governed
by the Emir and his family, be acceptable to all nations?
   There also is the question of whether an Iraqi withdrawal would
now be enough. Influential members of Congress, such as Sen.
Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, are urging Bush to hold out for the removal of
Saddam Hussein from power. They argue that as long as he is in
control of Iraq, it would only be a matter of time before he struck
again.
   More broadly, any attempt to look ahead to the post-Cold War
world runs into the question of whether the response to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait will be the exception or the rule.
   After all, the Persian Gulf with its oil resources is a region
so vital to so many of the world's industrial nations that it
provided unique incentive for governments to set aside interests
that divide them and unite behind an effort to roll back the Iraqi
aggression.
   Less than 24 hours after Bush cited with obvious satisfaction
the number of nations cooperating with the U.S. in the Persian
Gulf, the Vietnamese-installed government of Cambodia announced its
willingness to accept a major U.N. role in moving that nation
toward free elections.
   While the announcement leaves Cambodia still a long way from an
end to a 20-year period in which hundreds of thousands of people
have died, it does represent substantial progress toward an
international solution.
   For years, the world stood by, apparently helpless, as Cambodia
was ravaged by civil war and the savagery of the Khmer Rouge regime
when thousands died in execution chambers and slave labor camps.
   The prospect of a return to power of the Khmer Rouge may have
provided enough incentive for the compromise that is leading to a
United Nations role.
   The Persian Gulf and Cambodia _ both areas on which it was
relatively easy to find international agreement on the need for
action to halt further violence.
   The leaders who now are cooperating need only look back on the
response to the start of the Iran-Iraq war, to see a different sort
of response. There was no concerted effort to halt the fighting
between two evenly matched nations widely viewed as pariahs. The
only concern during the years that war dragged on was over whether
it would cause an interruption of oil shipments.

<TEXT>
   The idea of a floating hospital for injured
seals and sea lions seemed like a good one to Dan Deuel and Mary
Crumley. But it smacked of harboring the enemy to some people, who
have made death threats against the couple.
   ``Man is pretty possessive,'' said Neal Langbehn, a National
Marine Fisheries Service special agent, whose job includes tracking
down people who shoot marine mammals. ``If a critter causes him any
problems, all his natural instinct seems to be to get rid of the
critter. As man takes up more and more of the Earth, there are
going to be more conflicts.''
   Deuel and Crumley and some volunteers run Free Flight Bird and
Marine Mammal Rehabilitation Ltd. from their home on a bluff
overlooking the Pacific Ocean.
   Earlier this year, Deuel suggested to the Bandon Port Commission
that he could move his operation to a barge in the harbor. That
would make it more accessible to the public and more mobile in case
of an oil spill.
   The commission said OK, but the reaction from some nameless
people was different.
   ``My old man says you will be so ticked off when that Mary gets
dead, just like our fish. . . . No Barge. Or she's dead,'' read one
letter.
   The man's voice on the telephone answering machine was choked
with anger: ``Bring one sea lion into the port of Bandon and I'll
kill him right along with you, buddy.''
   The threats have been turned over to the Oregon State Police,
which called in the FBI to help.
   ``They sound maybe crazy enough to do it,'' Crumley said.
   ``If we get a death threat here, we feel it is not just a death
threat towards us,'' said Deuel. ``It is a death threat against
anyone who cares about peace on this planet.''
   Free Flight, which Deuel started 13 years ago, is caring for an
orphaned Steller sea lion pup and three injured harbor seal pups.
One was shot, one was attacked by a dog and one was hit by rocks
thrown by children.
   ``Because of the hostility, I don't release any of them around
certain coastal communities,'' Deuel said.
   The law allows fishermen to shoot harbor seals and California
sea lions if they steal fish and won't be driven away, but not
Steller sea lions. They were listed this year as a threatened
species because of dwindling numbers in Alaskan waters.
   Though their population is stable in Oregon, a fisherman who
shoots one here is still liable for a $25,000 federal fine.
   ``There's an awful lot of hard feelings on the entire coast,
from California clear up to Alaska, about the seals and sea lions
and their predation onto salmon,'' said Melvin Erdman, who has
fished out of Bandon for 48 years.
   When a sea lion comes across a salmon troller, it will dog the
boat for hours, taking the fish right off the hook as the fisherman
winches it in.
   Bitterness runs deep among fishermen who have watched the
government cut and complicate the salmon season to conserve
dwindling stocks, then protect a predator.
   Erdman said there is no shortage of people who would happily
kill the seals and sea lions Deuel and Crumley care for, though he
hasn't heard anyone threaten the couple directly.
   Despite the threats, Deuel said he won't give up on his project.
   ``It is all dependent on how our fund raising goes and right now
it is not going too bad,'' he said.

   Front-seat passengers of the 1990 Chrysler
LeBaron are nearly seven times more vulnerable to head injury in
crashes than the car's drivers, who are protected by air bags,
government tests show.
   A Chrysler spokesman, however, said the tests were unreliable
because they were based on conditions that exceed government safety
standards.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Friday
released its final round of crash test results for 1990
automobiles. For the year, the agency tested 34 vehicles ranging
from subcompacts to luxury sedans and light trucks.
   The tests showed that most drivers protected by air bags were
significantly less likely to sustain head injury than unprotected
front-seat passengers in the same vehicles.
   In the Chrysler Imperial four-door sedan, for example, the
passenger is four times as vulnerable as the driver.
   Chrysler spokesman Steve Harris said the tests were based on
crashes of cars into fixed objects at 35 miles per hour. But
government regulations require only that vehicles have safety belts
or air bags that perform satisfactorily in tests conducted at 30
mph.
   Also, the tests were not repeated to ensure that initial results
were free from external factors such as the weather or equipment
failure, he said.
   But Harris acknowledged air bags have a major impact on safety
and are needed for passengers as well as drivers.
   ``Everybody (in the auto industry) has indicated that's the
direction they're going,'' he said. ``We'll be moving air bags into
the minivans next year and start working toward passenger air bags
shortly thereafter.''
   The NHTSA tests, under the same conditions as a frontal
collision between two identical vehicles driving at 35 mph, are
equivalent to a car moving at 70 mph striking an identical parked
car.
   Tests are conducted using dummies that represent an
average-sized adult male. The dummies wear seat belts.
   According to the NHTSA index, a score of 750 or lower means head
injury is unlikely; 750-1,250 means head injury is possible; and
anything higher means head injury is likely.
   A separate scale records the possibility of chest injury, which
is considered likely when the score tops 60.
   The lower the numbers, the lower the potential for injury. But
for purposes of comparison, vehicles have to be of the same type
and weigh within 500 pounds of each other.
   The Chrysler LeBaron's score for driver head injury was 298,
well below the threshold for likely injury. But the front-seat
passenger score was 2,043. Chest injury scores were 40 for the
driver and 46 for the passenger.
   In the Imperial, the driver head injury score was 517 while the
passenger head injury score was 2,132.
   Rated highest of all vehicles tested for potential driver head
injury was the Ford Club Wagon van, with a score of 2,613. Its
passenger score was 1,896.
   The Isuzu Trooper II had the highest potential injury score for
the front-seat passenger _ 1,952.
   The Chevrolet S-10 Blazer had the highest driver chest injury
score _ 74. The highest passenger injury score was the Trooper II's
64.

<HEAD>Doctor to Face Second Trial in Identity-Switch Murder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A doctor convicted of an identity-switch
murder in an insurance fraud case will be retried after jurors
deadlocked on whether he should be sent to the gas chamber,
prosecutors said.
   A judge on Friday allowed a new penalty phase trial for Dr.
Richard Pryde Boggs and scheduled a Sept. 13 hearing to set the
trial date.
   Boggs, 57, was convicted July 12 of murder, grand theft, assault
and insurance fraud. On Aug. 8, the jury deadlocked 10-2 in favor
of sending him to the gas chamber for the 1988 death of Ellis Henry
Greene.
   Boggs was silent on Friday as Deputy District Attorney Al
Mackenzie asked the judge for a retrial on the penalty phase -- an
effort defense attorney Dale Rubin termed ``a waste of taxpayers'
money.''
   No jury would condemn Boggs to death on the strength of the
evidence presented at trial, Rubin told Superior Court Judge
Florence Marie Cooper.
   ``It is not in the furtherance of justice to retry this case,''
said Rubin. But Cooper ruled the law gives her no such discretion.
``I believe the decision lies with the prosecution authority, not
the court,'' she said.
   The prosecution said Boggs lured Greene from a North Hollywood
bar to his medical office in April 1988 and suffocated him,
although the cause of death was never conclusively proved through
medical evidence.
   The prosecution alleged that Boggs and the owners of the
troubled Just Sweats sports apparel company of Ohio conspired to
switch Greene's identity in an effort to collect life insurance on
one of the business partners.
   Melvin E. Hanson, principal in the clothing firm, awaits trial
in the case. His partner, John B. Hawkins, remains a fugitive.
   Boggs misidentified the body as Hanson and Hawkins had the body
cremated the following day. Hanson's credit cards and birth
certificate were found with the body.
   Hawkins, who is still missing, received $1 million in life
insurance benefits and Boggs got $6,500, prosecutors said.
   Rubin acknowledged at trial that Boggs participated in an
insurance fraud scheme, but said his client never killed anyone.
   He said Boggs' conviction was influenced by testimony about his
homosexual lifestyle and suggested that would be an issue on appeal
of his conviction. Boggs wore bright orange jail coveralls to
court, indicating he is being held in the Los Angeles County Jail's
``alternative lifestyle'' section.

   Burglary suspects have been known to break
out of police stations, but in Beaver County, one allegedly tried
to break in.
   Brian H. Walker, 19, of Ambridge near Pittsburgh was charged
Thursday with burglary and criminal mischief for allegedly trying
to break into the Harmony Township municipal building to retrieve
his friend's impounded car keys.
   Walker shimmied up a pole and climbed a ladder to the roof, got
in through a vent and crashed through the ceiling of the township
secretary's office, police said. Then he walked down the hall to
the police department.
   ``I look at it as stupid more than daring,'' Harmony Police
Chief Jack Lively said.
   Police later found scrapes on the police department door, where
the alleged burglar finally was stymied. The township's sole
late-night officer was on patrol.
   Police said Walker was trying to help a friend whose car had
been towed to the municipal parking lot after his arrest on charges
of drunken driving and assault.

<HEAD>White House Task Force Postpones Spotted Owl Advice</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report on how to save the rare spotted owl
is not on the president's desk as planned today, and at least one
scientist says advice offered on this issue should be made public
anyway.
   The report is being prepared by a task force chaired by two
Cabinet secretaries, Clayton Yeutter of Agriculture and Manuel
Lujan Jr. of Interior.
   At stake is the survival of the endangered owl and the financial
health of the Northwest timber industry, which environmentalists
say is contributing to the bird's problems.
   Officials for the Agriculture Department refused official
comment on Friday. But a department official who spoke on the
condition of anonymity said, ``The task force has not come back
with a finding yet.
   ``The Sept. 1 deadline was an internal goal. They are looking at
next week,'' the source said.
   Officials for the Fish and Wildlife Service also refused comment
on the task force this week. David Klinger, press officer for the
service's regional office in Portland, said the service ``is not
privy'' to the task force meetings.
   ``It's going to be news to us right along with the rest of the
world,'' he said.
   White House spokesman Stephen Hart said in a telephone interview
from Kennebunkport, Maine that it was not yet decided what role
Bush will play in the final decision about protecting the owl on
federal lands.
   ``It's unclear in that we are not sure what form the report will
take. We are right now in a waiting mode to see what the task force
delivers. I would expect any final decision will have to have the
concurrence of the White House,'' he said.
   ``What we have said in the past is that we are seeking a
balance,'' Hart said.
   Meanwhile, a scientist who appeared before the task force in
August is urging its leaders to make public the advice they have
received from independent biologists and foresters.
   The scientist, former Texas A&amp;M biologist John Teer, was among
three who said this week that they endorsed a protection plan that
the White House has resisted.
   Teer said they told Assistant Agriculture Secretary James
Moseley the owl's survival would be jeopardized by any further
compromise in the plan submitted by Forest Service biologist Jack
Ward Thomas and a committee of government scientists.
   ``I think it would be to his advantage to let people know,''
Teer said.
   The administration has struggled to please both
environmentalists and the Northwest's timber industry since the
Thomas panel determined in April that the rare bird is headed for
extinction unless logging stops on millions of acres of old-growth
forests.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service declared the owl a threatened
species on June 22, but the listing's impact remains unclear with a
government blueprint for protection still in limbo.
   Environmentalists say the Republican administration is ignoring
the advice of its own scientists while bending owl protection plans
to lessen the impact on timber jobs.

<TEXT>
   New drug-use statistics confirm earlier
surveys that indicate cocaine use is declining, according to
officials at the National Institute on Drug Abuse.
   The new data show a continued drop in the number of
cocaine-related emergency room visits in hospitals across the
country _ 27 percent from the third quarter of 1989 through the
first quarter of this year.
   ``We are finally beginning to see some progress in reaching
those who are seriously affected by the cocaine epidemic,'' said
Charles Schuster, director of the institute, which is in the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   The figures from the Drug Abuse Warning Network, or DAWN, show
the number of visits for the first quarter of this year was 8,135,
a 4 percent reduction from the last quarter of 1989 when 8,507
visits were recorded. Visits in the third quarter of 1989 numbered
11,145.
   Despite the improvement, however, the number of cocaine-related
deaths continued to increase last year, to 2,496, up from 2,254 in
1988. DAWN reports death data only on an annual basis.
   ``We're assuming deaths occur most often among the heaviest
users, and that's the population you'd expect to see changes in
last,'' said Edgar Adams, director of epidemiology at the institute.
   ``We're just beginning to see change in the emergency-room data,
and if that continues, we would hope to see a downturn in the
deaths next,'' he said.
   Heroin use followed the same trend as cocaine, both for hospital
visits and for deaths.
   The DAWN data shows the number of emergency room visits related
to the drug dropped 22 percent, from 3,933 in the third quarter of
1989, to 3,071 in the first quarter of this year.
   Heroin-related deaths, however, climbed from 1,884 in 1988 to
1,995 in 1989.
   Significant decreases in cocaine- and heroin-related emergency
room visits were reported by hospitals in most of the cities
included in the DAWN report, officials said.
   They said this confirms decreases in drug use reflected in two
other surveys conducted by the institute, the National Household
Survey on Drug Abuse and the High School Senior Survey.
   The decrease in cocaine-related emergency room visits began in
September of last year after three quarters of holding steady and
increasing 354 percent between the second quarter of 1985 and the
last quarter of 1988.
   Adams said the pattern indicates that the downturn ``is not an
aberration.''
   ``It's important that we're looking at a period that extends
through several quarters where there was a period of stability and
six months of decreases,'' Adams said.
   The DAWN data is based on reports from 431 emergency rooms. Most
of the facilities are located in 21 large metropolitan areas.

<HEAD>Neil Bush Asks Judge to Dismiss Government's Case Against Him</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Neil Bush says he's no longer in a position to
do the things banking regulators have accused him of doing, and
he's asking an administrative law judge to dismiss the government's
case against him.
   The president's son was an outside director of Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan Association, a Denver thrift that
collapsed in December 1988 at a cost to taxpayers estimated at $1
billion. Regulators have accused Bush, 35, of conflict of interest
in his former role as a director.
   In written arguments submitted to Judge Daniel J. Davidson, Bush
said there was no possibility that he could continue the alleged
abuses since Silverado already has been taken over by the
government.
   ``Silverado is in receivership,'' said his brief, which was made
available Friday. ``No `intermediate step' taken now will prevent
that, and nothing Bush could ever do in the future could pose
abnormal risk, loss or damage to Silverado or its insured''
deposits.
   In a separate S&amp;L development Friday, a spokeswoman for the
Resolution Trust Corp. said that agency plans to hire a special
group of employees to watch for possible corruption as it sells
hundreds of failed thrifts.
   The RTC hopes to set up a team of 20 to 30 ``contractor cops''
this fall, spokeswoman Kate Spears said. The team, which will
oversee the sale of billions of dollars of S&amp;L assets, will be led
by a new assistant director of the RTC to be named soon.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision has accused Bush of conflict of
interest for not disclosing his business ties to two big Silverado
borrowers, Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters. The thrift agency
is seeking an order against Bush which effectively would bar him
from working for banks or S&amp;Ls.
   Bush also could be a target of a negligence lawsuit that the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is considering filing against him
and other former directors of Silverado.
   Bush has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that the
regulators' actions are politically motivated. He has been ordered
to appear at a public hearing on Sept. 25 in Denver before
Davidson, who will then make a recommendation to the director of
the Office of Thrift Supervision, Timothy Ryan.
   A spokesman for the office, William Fulwider, said Friday the
agency would have no comment on Bush's request to the judge.
   ``There's no authority for them (the regulators) to be doing
what they're doing,'' Bush's attorney, James Nesland, said in a
telephone interview from Denver. ``Why should we litigate an order
that can't be issued?''
   Bush's petition says the proposed order against him would be the
first against an outside director after the institution has been
closed.
   ``Plainly, the cease-and-desist proceeding against Bush cannot
be characterized as an `intermediate sanction' to protect Silverado
or its insured funds,'' the document says. ``The action here can
only be characterized as a punitive proceeding, and that is not the
purpose of a cease-and-desist proceeding.''

<HEAD>Jackson a Veteran of Many Self-Appointed Diplomatic Missions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, who met this week with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein on the Persian Gulf crisis, has traveled
the world as a self-appointed diplomat to pursue a host of missions
of his own making.
   The longtime civil rights activist and unsuccessful presidential
candidate has visited dozens of countries and conferred with more
than 60 heads of state.
   One of Jackson's biggest coups came in 1984, when he went to
Syria to secure the release of Navy Lt. Robert O. Goodman Jr.,
whose jet bomber was shot down during a raid over Syrian
antiaircraft positions in Lebanon's central mountains.
   Jackson, who at the time was running for the Democratic
presidential nomination, brought Goodman home to the United States
a month after the pilot was shot down. Jackson called on President
Reagan to meet personally with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try
to reduce tension between the two countries.
   Assad's assistance to Jackson was seen as a clever move to
influence American public opinion to change Reagan's foreign policy
in the region.
   Over the years, Jackson's efforts in international diplomacy
have taken him around the globe and provoked controversy on more
than one occasion.
   He has hugged Yasser Arafat in Lebanon, accepted a cigar from
Fidel Castro in Cuba, conferred with Pope John Paul II in Rome and
advocated anti-apartheid civil disobedience in South Africa.
   A photograph of Jackson embracing Arafat, the leader of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, during a 1979 visit to the
Middle East still angers many American Jews and caused him trouble
with Jewish voters during his presidential campaigns. At one point
during the 1988 campaign, Jackson met with Jewish leaders in what
he described as an ``a step toward healing the wounds.''
   Jackson said earlier this week he hoped to keep adversaries in
the gulf talking in order to avoid war in the Middle East but that
he was making the trip as a journalist, and would not be engaged in
diplomatic negotiations.
   Jackson, who flew to Iraq for the U.S. television show ``Inside
Edition,'' met Thursday with Saddam and Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz.
   He met first with Aziz, who explained to him the reasons behind
Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, and later with Saddam, Iraqi officials
said. No details of the meeting with Saddam were released
immediately.
   Jackson visited the Persian Gulf in 1987, meeting Saudi Arabian
and Jordanian leaders and delivering 600 pounds of Christmas gifts
for the crew of a U.S. warship.
   In 1984, Jackson visited Castro, who then released some two
dozen Americans from his jails. He also traveled to Nicaragua,
where he praised the Sandinista government, to Panama and to El
Salvador, where he tried to mediate differences between Salvadoran
rebels and then-President Napoleon Duarte.
   He paid his first visit to South Africa in more than a decade in
February, when he met with black leader Nelson Mandela upon his
release after 27 years in prison. Jackson had been refused a visa
since 1979.
   A year earlier, he was in Moscow to promote aid to victims of
the December 1988 earthquake in Armenia and to assess the economic
and political reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev.

   When the tearful goodbye is over, a Navy
wife is left to get on with life alone. Well, almost alone.
   The modern Navy, recognizing that reduced family worries make
better sailors, is offering counseling services _ or just a
shoulder to cry on _ to families of troops shipped to the Middle
East.
   ``You know the old quote, `The Navy wife is the toughest job in
the Navy?' It's true. What it is to love a sailor is letting him
go,'' said a 36-year-old Navy wife with two teen-age children who
identified herself only by her first name, Glory.
   In the past, families turned to chaplains. But in the late
1970s, the Navy and Marine Corps started offering counseling
services.
   ``When I was in Vietnam in the '60s, who would have ever
thought?'' said William J. Kelly, deputy director of the Newport
Family Service Center, which opened in 1982. Newport has three
counselors for its 8,000 military personnel.
   The Defense Department's decision to offer counseling, ``is not
all selfless,'' Kelly said. Troops perform better when they don't
have to worry about their families at home, he said.
   To ease stress on those left stateside, the military offers a
variety of services. The chaplains are still around and are more
sought-out during times when troops are deployed, said Cmdr.
Willard James, a chaplain.
   James said the five chaplains at the Newport base often make
referrals to the service center and to ``ombudsmen,'' spouses of
military personnel who are trained in crisis management and
familiar with the various resources available.
   Glory is one of Newport's 35 ombudsmen. Telephone calls come
around the clock, she said.
   ``I get the crying calls. I get the happy calls. I get the birth
calls,'' the 19-year Navy wife said. ``I am a listening ear.''
   ``I think the hardest thing at this point is the uncertainty,''
she said. ``We don't have any answers for them.''
   The USS Roberts is the only one of Newport's 12 ships to be
deployed so far. For those with family on the Roberts, the biggest
concern has been ensuring paychecks arrive on time.
   ``When the husband is deployed, life goes on. Dinner has to get
on the table,'' she said. ``We are the anchors.''

   Hundreds of mostly Pakistani refugees, some
suffering malnutrition and others bruised from beatings by Iraqi
soldiers, crossed into southern Turkey through this border post one
day this week.
   Few Westerners have escaped through Habur, the single border
crossing between Iraq and Turkey, since 52 dependents of U.S.
Embassy personnel stationed in Kuwait left Iraq on Monday.
   But on Friday a string of cars stretching more than seven miles
long awaited entry into Turkay under scorching 104-degree heat.
   Among the refugees were 1,000 Pakistanis, more than 100 Chinese,
31 Sri Lankans and a few Finns. Many looked bedraggled and
exhausted and all crossed on foot, clutching their belongings.
   ``We waited for seven days to enter Turkey,'' said one Pakistani
who refused to give his name. Many of his countrymen worked on
construction sites in Kuwait before Iraq invaded its oil-rich
neighbor on Aug. 2, he said.
   Several travelers said Iraqi troops made many bureaucratic
checks to verfify their nationality before allowing them to pass
into Turkey. Most Westerners have been barred from leaving Iraq
since the month-old crisis began.
   Some refugees were taken to the field hospital of the Turkish
Red Crescent, the Moslem equivalent of the Red Cross. Dr. Nuri
Polat of the Red Crescent said most were suffering from
malnutrition and dehydration.
   Some travelers said they had trouble finding food in Iraq, which
has suffered food shortages since the United Nations imposed a
trade embargo to pressure Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``Some Pakistani nationals were beaten by Iraqi soldiers and we
had to send them to hospitals nearby for treatment,'' Polat said.
He would not elaborate.
   Two cars carrying three Finnish women, a boy and a Pakistani man
also crossed the border Friday.
   Shaikh Mohammad Zubair Siddiqi of Lahore, Pakistan, his wife
Asta Anneli Kyllikki of Keskisoumi, Finland, and their 18-year-old
son arrived in one car.
   Siddiqi said they left all their belongings in Kuwait and drove
22 hours to reach the border.
   Two Finnish women traveling in a second car refused to talk to
reporters. A Finnish official said their husbands had not been
allowed to leave Iraq.
   Siddiqi, manager of Moto Cave, an air-conditioning company in
Kuwait, said he and his family had to leave after his company
closed and the Finnish community in Kuwait decided to depart.
   ``All the banks had closed, we could not get out money and there
was a curfew,'' he said.
   Mrs. Siddiqi said people in Kuwait wait in long lines to buy
bread and ``supermarket shelves were cleaned out in two days''
after the invasion.
   In one instance, she said, ``I saw Iraqi soldiers filling up
their shopping cart at the supermarket and walking straight out
without paying.''
   Raimo Pahkasalo, the Finnish Embassy's charge d'affaires in
Kuwait, crossed the border with 18 Finns Aug. 24, after he locked
up the embassy. Nine Finns, all men, were not allowed to cross.
   Zhang Zheng, coordinating the departure of more than 100
Chinese, said Beijing asked the group to leave Iraq. Zhang said he
rented buses to take the Chinese to Istanbul, where they would
catch planes home.
   Since the Persian Gulf crisis began, about 16,000 people have
left Iraq and Kuwait through Turkey.
   Iraq has distributed some Westerners among strategic sites to
serve as human shields against any U.S. attack on the facilities.
There are about 21,000 Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait, including
3,000 Americans.
   Iraq has also ordered embassies closed in Kuwait, which Baghdad
annexed and now claims as part of its territory. But many foreign
governments, including the United States, have refused to close
their missions in Kuwait.

   Frank Sinatra has signed an exclusive
contract for nine shows over two years at the Sands Hotel Casino
and County Club in Atlantic City, a hotel spokesman said.
   Sinatra will perform five shows in the 850-seat Sands Copa Room
from Oct. 4 to 7, Sands spokesman Jim Wise said Friday. Sinatra,
74, also will perform twice both in 1991 and 1992 at the casino,
Wise said.
   The contract precludes Sinatra from performing at any other
Atlantic City casino, said Wise, who would not disclose how much
the contract is worth.
   Sinatra, a New Jersey native, first performed in Atlantic City
in 1939 when he sang with Harry James and his Orchestra, Stone said.

   Irish singer Sinead O'Connor says the
flap over ``The Star Spangled Banner'' has her on the testy side.
   During a 90-minute act an amusement park in this town 30 miles
east of Buffalo, the 23-year-old O'Connor tried to hush some of the
audience who talked while she sang.
   ``Is everyone going to be quiet now?'' she said Thursday night.
``If there's anyone that wants to sing the national anthem, can you
wait until later?''
   Later O'Connor apologized, and the crowd of 6,500 cheered.
   ``I hope I wasn't harsh before,'' she said. ``The last few days
have been a strain and I've been irritable, so I hope I didn't
appear rude.''
   O'Connor threatened last week to walk out of the Garden State
Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., if the national anthem was played, as
is the tradition there. Center staff relented and the show went on.

   Navajo leaders are satisfied that
director Robert Redford is making an effort to employ Native
Americans in his latest film, ``Dark Wind.''
   The film's producers ``have assured us that Navajos and Hopis
will work on the productions of the film,'' leaders of the Navajo
nation said in a statement Friday.
   Some Navajos have objected to Redford offering the leading role
of a Navajo policeman to Lou Diamond Phillips.
   Phillips, who says he is part Cherokee, has been selected to
play Jim Chee, a fictitious Navajo policeman. The film is based on
``The Dark Wind,'' a novel by New Mexico author Tony Hillerman.
   Navajo leaders said they have no quarrel with a producer's right
to capitalize on an actor's popularity. ``All we ask is that they
be sensitive to our needs, culture and language in making films
based on the Navajo,'' the statement said.
   Sammye Meadows, the film's Native American liason, said earlier
this week that Redford and others searched coast to coast to find a
Navajo actor to play Chee.
   Shooting for the film begins Sept. 10 on the Navajo and Hopi
reservations.

<HEAD>Ortega: Government Must Abandon Market Reform or Face Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Daniel Ortega has
told the conservative government it faces further social unrest
unless it abandons its free market economic policies.
   The leftist Sandinista leader made the statement during a debate
Friday at the national university on ``The Possible Nicaragua''
among representatives of the new and old governments, private
enterprise and labor.
   Ortega, succeeded by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in April after
losing free elections, said the only route to a ``truce'' between
the Sandinistas and the new government would be cancellation of
three decrees that pave the way for the transition to a market
economy.
   President Chamorro's decrees were suspended after two violent
Sandinista-led strikes.
   ``Those decrees would have to be forgotten,'' Ortega said.
   He accused the U.S.-backed government of ``retaliating'' against
the Sandinistas by firing public servants, planning to privatize
state enterprises and planning to return Sandinista-confiscated
lands to previous owners.
   ``If this government takes destabilizing actions ... those
governed have the right to question, to protest the government's
action, to exercise their power, which they do not lose when they
cast their vote,'' Ortega said.
   The Sandinistas _ who promised to ``govern from below'' after
losing the Feb. 25 elections _ maintain that any attempt to
dismantle the leftist state they built is a ``destabilizing''
action.
   Attempts by the Chamorro government to move to a market economy
have provoked violent Sandinista reaction, including the two
paralyzing strikes in May and July.
   Ortega insisted during the debate that workers have the right to
strike for political reasons.
   Minister of the Presidency Antonio Lacayo announced during the
debate that the government has created a $10 million emergency fund
to create short-term jobs for those who become unemployed because
of economic reforms.
   The announcement by Lacayo, considered the real power in the
4-month-old government, indicated how seriously Nicaragua's
leadership takes threats of more Sandinista-led unrest.
   The strikes have already put much of the new government's
economic program on hold.
   Lacayo, the president's son-in-law, rejected suggestions that
the Sandinistas have intimidated the government into sharing power.
   He called for a constructive and cooperative attitude on all
fronts to help rebuild Nicaragua and said everyone must ``share the
sacrifices needed to revive the economy.''
   Ortega said the conditions for such cooperation do not exist.
   ``Those conditions are created by not firing teachers ... (and)
public employees,'' he said.
   Ortega said in the debate that 3,000 Sandinista sympathizers
have been fired from government jobs and replaced with 2,000 people
who support the new government. Lacayo disputed those figures but
did not offer any of his own.
   Unemployment is estimated at more than 30 percent _ about what
it was under the Sandinistas _ and is growing as the state tries to
trim the public payroll.
   Inflation has been running at 80 percent a month since Mrs.
Chamorro took office on April 25. The price of staples is out of
reach for many Nicaraguans and foreign investment has been scared
away by the Sandinista labor unrest.

<HEAD>200,000 Children Will Be Hurt on the Job, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 200,000 children will be injured
this year on the job, according to a report by the American Youth
Work Center, a youth advocacy group.
   In a report released Friday, the American Youth Work Center
predicted some 40,000 cases of child labor violations will be
reported this year, almost double the number found in 1989.
   ``Deaths and injuries are increasing dramatically and yet are
spread thinly across the country,'' said AYWC's William Treanor.
``And so all that people have are anecdotal stories. Everybody can
think of one gruesome, horrible incident that they're aware of and
they think that that's some sort of freak occurrence. ''
   The Department of Labor conducted a one-day sweep of businesses
in June this year, uncovering 3,800 cases of child labor violation.
Most of the cases involved youngsters working more hours than the
laws allow, but many were using dangerous machinery.
   As a result of the sweep, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
announced that the administration would back legislation to
increase fines from $1,000 to $10,000, the maximum penalty for
violations.
   The legislation, co-sponsored by Reps. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
and Don Pease, D-Ohio, will go to the floor when Congress gets back
to work this fall.
   One area not covered by proposed legislation is agricultural. An
estimated 300 children are killed every year in farm work, and more
than 23,000 are injured. In July this year, investigators from the
Department of Labor found children as young as 3 years old working
as migrant laborers in Northern California.

<HEAD>Post Office to Keep the Color in Christmas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Postal officials are red-faced about reports
that they want Americans to have a white Christmas.
   Not so, says Richard J. Strasser, senior assistant postmaster
general for marketing and customer service. Strasser's comments
came after postal officials in Kansas City told area residents
earlier this week that they should ``never use red, green or any
dark colored envelopes.''
   If people buy Christmas cards that come with envelopes that are
red or green or some other color, the Postal Service will deliver
them happily, Strasser said Friday.
   Americans send one another some 2 billion cards annually,
millions in colored envelopes.
   White envelopes are easier for the agency's automated machinery
to handle, Strasser admitted. Dark-colored backgrounds can make the
addresses written on them very hard to read.
   ``They are a challenge, but we can handle it,'' he said.
   How did the misunderstanding start? Some postal workers may have
been too enthusiastic in discussing the benefits of the new
automatic letter sorting equipment, Strasser said.
   Strasser said the postal service and the makers of greeting
cards have been working together to develop envelope colors that
are attractive but can easily be handled by automatic sorting
machinery.
   But in the meantime, no envelope that is sold will be rejected,
he said.

<HEAD>HHS proposes changing Medicare physician payment program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan is proposing
to Congress a plan that will change the way physicians are paid by
the Medicare program.
   The package sent to Congress on Friday includes a preliminary
fee schedule covering about 1,400 physician services, shifting
payments to primary care and away from procedure-based services
like surgery.
   Under the new system, physician fees will be based on the time,
skill level and resources needed to perform the service, as well as
practice costs and malpractice insurance costs.
   More than 500,000 physicians will be affected by the change
scheduled to be implemented Jan. 1, 1992. It will be the largest
change in the Medicare program since its inception 25 years ago.
   In his letter to health committee and subcommittee chairmen and
ranking members, Sullivan cautioned that the numbers in the fee
schedule are ``very preliminary ... Many and perhaps all of these
values will change.''
   ``Important policy and technical questions ... are unresolved,''
he said.
   Under the current Medicare system, physicians are paid their
actual charge, customary charge or the prevailing local charge for
a service, whichever is lowest.
   The system has resulted in large variations in payments among
localities and services.
   The new system will pay physicians either the actual charge or a
fee based on the value scale, whichever is lower.
   A geographic adjustment will account for differences in practice
costs, but overall payments will increase for many physicians in
rural areas who are paid less than urban physicians under the
current system.
   A spokesman for the American Medical Association said the
group's officials were looking over the preliminary fee schedule
but could not comment in detail on the proposal yet.

<TEXT>
   When is a vacation on the
Southern California seashore no longer a vacation? For the American
wife of a Kuwaiti engineer, vacation turned to exile when Iraq
invaded her adopted country.
   Stacey Carpenter's husband remains in the occupied Middle East
nation and has not been able to contact his wife and two children
since Iraqi troops crossed the border on Aug. 2.
   Assurances from relatives that he is all right can only go so
far.
   ``I'm worried about him. It is definitely a potentially
dangerous situation over there,'' she said.
   Carpenter, 33, doesn't want her married name published because
she considers her husband a hostage. As the Persian Gulf crisis
moves into its fifth week, she says her status is uneasy.
   ``I'm not a widow, I'm not a divorcee, I'm nothing,'' she said.
   Carpenter, her 6-year-old son, Saad, and 10-month-old daughter,
Layla, have been staying with her parents in this beach town about
15 miles southwest of downtown Los Angeles. They arrived for a
one-month vacation in early July.
   She is looking for a job and her son will soon start school.
   ``My parents are helpful and generous, but I've invaded their
home,'' said Carpenter. ``I'm an independent person who likes to do
things my own way. I have to support my family. I have no access to
money. All my money is in Kuwait.''
   Carpenter's mother, Dixie, said her daughter's predicament is
also a godsend. ``I'm glad she took the vacation when she did,''
she said.
   Carpenter said she fears it may be a year or two before she can
return to Kuwait, where she was a physiologist and researcher at
the University of Kuwait medical school.
   She watches television to keep track of Middle East developments.
   ``Last week, I thought the U.S. would move in and strike Iraq in
an intense, short military action,'' she said. ``Now, it seems like
everything will be stalemated.''
   Carpenter and her husband, a chemical engineer, married in 1980
while they were students at the University of California, Santa
Barbara. Carpenter became a Moslem.
   Adjusting to the prospect of spending a long time in the United
States has been tough on Carpenter's son.
   ``I miss my dad and a few friends a lot. I miss Kuwait,'' said
Saad.

<HEAD>Premier Proposes ``One China, Two Regions'' Formula</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Hau Pei-tsun today proposed a
``one country, two regions'' formula in another attempt to solve
differences between Taiwan and the rival Communist government in
China.
   Hau said the formula would respect the differing political
systems of China and Taiwan, which has been governed by the
Nationalists since they lost a civil war on the Chinese mainland in
1949.
   Both the Communists and Nationalists regard Taiwan as a Chinese
province.
   Hau said the Nationalists would enact laws based on the new
formula to govern trade, cultural and other civilian exchanges
between Taiwan and China. Such exchanges have increased recently.
   Officials said one main area to be covered would be the
repatriation of an increasing number of mainland Chinese who have
entered Taiwan illegally to seek a better life. At present there
are no laws covering them.
   More than 10,000 mainlanders have entered Taiwan illegally since
1987, when the Nationalists relaxed private contacts between
Taiwanese and Chinese.
   The Nationalists, who maintain they are China's legitimate
leaders, continue to reject any official contacts with the Chinese
government.
   In the past, both sides have offered other formulas to solve
their differences, but each solution has been rejected by the other.
   China proposed a ``one country, two systems'' formula, but this
was rejected by the Nationalists who said it would have reduced
them to the status of a local government.
   In turn, the Nationalists proposed a ``one country, two
governments'' formula, but this was rejected by Beijing which said
it would have created two Chinas.
   Hau proposed the latest formula in a written report to the
lawmaking Legislative Yuan, which would have to approve the
changes. There was no immediate indication of whether the proposal
would be accepted.
   Legislator Huang Chu-wen, a member of the governing Nationalist
Party, said Hau's proposal was an attempt to resolve the dispute
over sovereignty and solve problems involving trade and other
private exchanges between Taiwan and China.

   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov
joins other regional leaders Sunday in trying to agree on a plan to
save the polluted Baltic Sea, but Soviet-Baltic independence
politics was complicating the meeting.
   One-third of the sea floor, or about 40,000 square miles, is
dead, according to reports released by the Baltic Commission and
Greenpeace International in advance of the two-day conference in
Ronneby, southern Sweden.
   Phosphates and nitrates from farms, factories and cars have
created slimy algae floats along the coasts of the seven nations
which surround the Baltic Sea, according to the scientific reports.
   Sweden and Poland are hosting the conference, which has been
overshadowed by the problem of how to invite representatives of
five Soviet republics without disavowing their struggle for
independence or stepping on Moscow's toes.
   Invitations were finally sent last Wednesday to the heads of
governments in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Byelorussia and Russia.
They are among Soviet republics that have passed sovereignty
declarations of various degrees.
   They were given the right to make formal statements and display
their flags at the conference, but are to be regarded as part of
the Soviet delegation, Swedish officials said.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis declined the
invitation Friday, saying it showed that Sweden was a ``Soviet
satellite.''
   ``It's a big pity that Sweden in this situation has actually
taken the position of the Soviet Union,'' Landsbergis said in Oslo,
Norway. He said Sweden was the only country in Europe which
accepted Soviet annexation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in
1940, and its current policy reinforced that decision.
   ``Sweden takes a satellite position, compared to Czechoslovakia
and Hungary,'' said Landsbergis. ``The events that are connected
with the negotiations in Ronneby stress the importance of what
happened 50 years ago,'' he said through an interpreter.
   The international environmental organization, Greenpeace, called
on the conference to immediately start reducing pollution of the
Baltic. It said nitrates and phosphates entering the sea have
increased 10 times over the past 20 years, producing the
oxygen-consuming algal blooms.
   Greenpeace said a 1988 agreement by the Baltic nations to halve
all emissions into the sea by 1995 was far from adequate.
   The Baltic Commission report said improvements have been made in
some areas thanks to growing awareness during the 1970s and 1980s.
The report said levels of mercury, lead, arsenic, DDT and other
dangerous substances appeared to be falling.
   Swedish Cabinet Secretary Pierre Schori said Friday his
government sees the conference ``as an embryo for a regional
cooperation which would include other issues as well, for instance,
science, culture and transportation questions.''
   He said, ``I hope that we now shall see the first example of
regional initiative in the new Europe.''

   Napoleon said an army marches on its
stomach. But these days the 265th Quartermaster Detachment is
treading a paperwork road on its way to the Mideast.
   There's record-keeping to bind the tiny unit of 14 guardsmen
over to the regular Army: forms for new dog tags, forms for new
green Army identification cards to replace their red South Carolina
National Guard IDs, forms to draw their first Army pay.
   More ominous is the business of preparing for overseas
deployment: The paperwork for inoculations against typhoid and
meningitis; fittings for new gas masks; instructions to the Army on
where to send their belongings if they don't return.
   ``I'm having them send my stuff to my mom and dad,'' Mark, a
20-year-old college student, said with an uncertain shrug.
   But even these grim reminders of their mission are muted by the
boredom that accompanies each stop.
   Some doze while waiting on the long wooden benches, paying
little attention to CNN news reports droning from the television
suspended over the waiting area.
   A general is telling reporters in Saudi Arabia the triple digit
temperatures of the desert are dropping and U.S. soldiers may be
wearing field jackets on chilly nights. But the men of the 265th
aren't listening as they go back out into the moist heat of Georgia
in August and on to their next stop.
   The unit, which specializes in water purification, was put on
alert last Sunday, a move that placed it in the regular Army. On
Wednesday the unit traveled from its hometown of Allendale, S.C.,
to this huge Army base near Savannah to begin training for
deployment.
   Little was said Friday, through the heat and boredom, about
their eventual destination. Instead, they razzed each other,
particularly Mark, the youngest member and the only white in the
otherwise all-black unit.
   ``You better watch it over there in the desert,'' someone
warned. ``You're going to come home as dark as us.''
   A solution was suggested. Mark should wear his chemical warfare
clothes at all time to avoid a sunburn.
   Another favorite joke: Mark's decision to leave his prized red
sports car with his girlfriend, who quickly rolled up 600 new miles
on the odometer.
   ``Hey, don't worry about it,'' said Bill, a veteran of 17 years
in the Guard. ``If she put 600 miles on in two days, you know she
didn't have any time to fool around on you.''
   Among those laughing was Henry, who retired in June after 25
years of teaching. At a gentlemanly 51, he is the oldest in the
unit. He was 34 when he joined and probably will stay until he has
to leave when he turns 60.
   ``I always wanted to be in the Guard,'' he said. ``I couldn't
for a long time because it was hard for blacks to get in.''
   Limping slightly from the unit's predawn PT _ physical training
_ Henry had little hesitation about going to the Mideast.
   ``I'm glad to have the chance to pay the Guard back,'' he said.
   Henry coached football at Ruffin High, which fielded teams of
dubious distinction. Henry said his players would pump themselves
up with the odd chant: ``I ain't staying with my Momma because she
beats me; I ain't staying with my Daddy 'cause he beats me; I'm
staying with Ruffin because it don't beat no one.''
   Members of the unit used to tease him about the team until this
year, when it beat Allendale. Then, said Henry, there was no
mention of football.
   ``That's what the Guard is all about,'' he said. ``You work with
the same people for years. You work with people you know and can
trust.''

<HEAD>U.S. Diplomats in Kuwait Tell Jesse Jackson Most Americans in
Hiding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. diplomats in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait told the
Rev. Jesse Jackson the roughly 2,000 Americans left in the country
are hiding from Iraqi troops in fear of being used as hostages, The
New York Times reported today.
   An unknown number of Americans have been rounded up and taken to
Iraq, where they are being held at strategic sites as human shields
against possible attack.
   The diplomats, who have been resisting an order from Iraq to
shut down the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City, said they are running
out of water, their food is spoiling because they lack electricity
and no air-conditioning means they sleep outside for some relief
from the heat, the Times reported.
   ``I wouldn't say I'm terrified, but it isn't a very pleasant
way,'' Ambassador W. Nathaniel Howell said Friday through the
locked gate of the embassy compound.
   A group of reporters accompanied Jackson into Kuwait on an Iraqi
Airways jet that President Saddam Hussein provided for him. Jackson
traveled to the Mideast in his new role as a television reporter
and talked with Saddam Thursday night.
   The Western reporters were the first to be allowed into Kuwait
since the Aug. 2 invasion. They were escorted through the quiet and
nearly deserted city by armed Iraqi escorts, the newspaper said.
   After hours of negotiations with Iraqi officials, Jackson was
allowed to visit the U.S. Embassy, it said.
   He spoke with Howell and deputy chief of mission Barbara Badine,
who said Americans trapped in Iraq are staying out of sight.
   ``They're all in hiding because they know what the Iraqis are
going to do to them,'' Badine said. ``They're going to round them
up in their houses. They knock on the door at midnight and take
people away. We never hear from them again and they are interned.
   ``For that reason, they don't come out of their apartments to be
seen.''
   Jackson said he would appeal on their behalf in an interview
with Saddam scheduled for today. He said he is videotaping news
segments for broadcast next week.
   Diplomats said 11 Americans in Kuwait outside the compound
needed medical treatment and asked that an evacuation flight be
arranged.
   They said they were with six colleagues in the compound and 42
other Americans who had sought refuge.
   ``We've got some soda and juices left, to keep from getting
dehydrated,'' Badine said. ``We've built our own outhouse. We don't
have any water to spare.''

   A few foreigners began trickling out of
Iraq on Friday under Saddam Hussein's pledge to free women and
children hostages, but Iraq made more requests in connection with
the release of the remaining captives.
   Government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said 237 hostages were
waiting to be flown to London and Paris on Iraqi Airways. He said
on the return leg, the flights should carry home Iraqis who he said
were stranded abroad.
   ``This is a humanitarian request, and we hope the two
governments will reply quickly and positively,'' al-Hadithi said at
a news conference.
   He referred to Iraqis being stranded in London and Paris by
``brutal American sanctions.'' However, the sanctions imposed
against Iraq by the United Nations do not restrict the movement of
Iraqi nationals.
   On Saturday, a senior official with Iraqi Airways said one of
the airline's Boeing 747s was scheduled later in the day to ferry
scores of women and children out of the country.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he did
not have precise figures on passengers or a breakdown on
nationality but said the plane would fly to Amman, Jordan, Paris,
London and Washington. He said it would pick up Iraqis stranded in
Europe.
   Britain did not object to letting the Iraqi planes take Iraqis
home.
   ``If a plane is coming out here with British nationals on it,
and is going back to empty to Baghdad, Iraqi nationals want to go
on it, of course they can go,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said,
adding pointedly: ``We do not have hostages.''
   French Foreign Ministry spokesman Daniel Bernard said France had
not been officially informed of the demands and added that France
``will not give ourselves over to any negotiations, to any trading
with anybody.''
   Al-Hadithi said the request was not a precondition to allowing
the foreign women and children to leave the country. But if it were
denied, he said, they might have to travel overland.
   He said the foreign men still held in Iraq are being held at
potential military targets all over the country. Baghdad has
already said the captives would be used a human shields for key
installations.
   ``Every place, every town that has a vital installation will
host our guests,'' al-Hadithi said. Iraq refers to the captives as
``guests.''
   ``We're relocating the foreign men all over the country at
airports, air bases, military bases, industrial plants,
communications centers, power centers and oil refineries _ wherever
Iraq considers it has a vital installation, one exposed to the
American threat in Saudi Arabia,'' he said.
   The United States has tens of thousands of troops deployed in
Saudi Arabia, along with contingents from other nations.
   Some 21,000 Westerners were stranded in Kuwait and Iraq after
Iraq invaded on Aug. 2 in a dispute over oil, money and land.
   On Tuesday, Saddam announced he would allow the foreign women
and children to leave to preserve the ``Arabs' humanitarian image.''
   Among the first to depart were 19 Italian women and children who
crossed the desert and arrived in Jordan on Friday, and three
Finnish women who crossed into Turkey.
   Britain's Foreign Office said Friday that Iraq has issued exit
visas to 139 British women and children, but hundreds of others
were waiting for theirs.
   The Foreign Ministry in Bonn said it expected 100 of its
nationals to be among the evacuees.
   In Stockholm, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anita Matejovsky said
some of about 50 Swedish women and children in Iraq received exit
visas Friday and that the rest were promised theirs on Saturday,
she said. Two dozen other Scandinavians were expected to be
evacuated, along with 16 Spaniards, five Greeks and 17 Cypriots.
   The U.S. State Department had said that about one-third of the
3,000 Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq are women and children
who should be allowed out.
   U.S. State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said Iraqi
authorities rounded up five more Americans. She said one American
woman was granted an exit visa and allowed to leave for Jordan. A
U.S. diplomat in Baghdad said no American women and children had
been granted exit permits by Friday. There was no explanation for
the discrepancy.
   ``The Iraqis still have 100 percent control on the detainees,''
said the diplomat, who asked that his name was not used.
   On Thursday, the State Department criticized Iraq for dragging
its feet in releasing the American women and children.
   A group of 316 Soviets left for Moscow Friday aboard an Aeroflot
plane. Aeroflot is the only foreign airline that has been allowed
to land in Baghdad since the invasion.
   A Soviet official in Baghdad said about 800 Soviet civilians
have been airlifted in recent days, while hundreds of others
traveled to Jordan across the desert.
   A senior Asian diplomat complained about the confusion over the
evacuation procedure.
   ``It's a very confusing situation. One official says something,
the other says the opposite,'' he said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Six Months Needed to Stabilize Soviet Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said the government
will choose from among four plans for major economic reform and
will try to stabilize the faltering economy within six months.
   And in an indication of the urgency he attaches to fixing the
country's economic woes, Gorbachev said he would cut back on
foreign travel.
   The Soviet economy is wracked by shortages of everything from
medicine to cigarettes and citizens are furious. Politicians are
pushing for economic reforms of varying speed and scope.
   Four separate panels are currently working on widely different
proposals to move the Soviet economy from a centrally planned,
command system to one driven primarily by market forces.
   But speaking to reporters after a two-day session of government
advisory bodies, Gorbachev said officials believe the country
should settle on one blueprint for major economic reform.
   ``We must come out with one program,'' Gorbachev said. ``If we
lose two or three months ... it will affect things in such a way
that we will have to make corrections not only in tactics but
strategy.''
   The commissions include a group supervised by Gorbachev and
Russian federation president Boris N. Yeltsin, who favors faster
moves toward a market economy than Gorbachev and Kremlin leaders.
   They went to work after the national legislature, the Supreme
Soviet, rejected Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov's blueprint for a
transition to a market economy.
   The Supreme Soviet reconvenes Sept. 10 to take up the latest
proposals, which Gorbachev said would not be ready for another week.
   Yeltsin has said that if the central Soviet government's plan is
not to his liking he will implement radical and swift economic
reform in Russia, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics. That
would be a major blow to unity of the Soviet Union, already
fractured by bitter ethnic and political clashes.
   But Gorbachev said that at a joint meeting of the presidential
and federation councils this week, participants came to a ``general
understanding of the situation, its crucial nature and most
importantly an understanding of the need to act together,
cooperating.''
   Gorbachev is scheduled to visit France in the fall but appeared
to rule out another trip he had been expected to make, to Spain in
order to push along the nation's economic reform.
   The Soviet president said serious measures would be taken in the
next six months to cut off Soviets' ability to accumulate ``hot
money,'' the term for income derived from black marketeering and
other activities.
   The Soviet Union suffers from what economists call a ``ruble
overhang,'' a supply of rubles far outstripping the supply of goods
available for purchase.
   Gorbachev did not say exactly how ``hot money'' would be
controlled and did not specify what other steps were under
consideration to stabilize the economy. He said the next stage of
economic reform would deal with prices, taxes, the government's
budget and the earning, distribution and use of foreign currency.
   Once the central government agrees on one of the reform plans,
he said, it wil be presented to the legislatures of the Soviet
republics. He acknowledged the proposals could face resistance.
   ``Everything is subjected to doubt, to meticulous analysis,''
Gorbachev said.
   He said the national legislature would also review the economic
reform plan and that afterward he would issue a presidential decree
confirming it.
   Ryzhkov's initial program, presented in May, called for drastic
price increases on bread and other items whose prices have remained
basically unchanged for decades. The program fueled panic buying
that made ill-stocked store shelves even barer.

   Is the world ready for a pyramid version
of Rubik's Cube or a toilet-training seat that encourages toddlers
with flashing lights and a few bars of the ``Hallelujah Chorus?''
   Inventors who hope it is are gathering at conventions in Anaheim
and Pasadena this weekend, showing off their products and dreaming
of mass marketing and big profits.
   An electric tooth flosser shared space with Alaskan
``moose-nugget flowers'' _ gift-wrapped excretions _ and some 120
other exhibits at the Inventors &amp; Entrepreneurs Expo 1990 at the
Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim.
   ``There's still this idea in America that you'll have the
opportunity to take a good idea and make millions,'' said Alan
Tratner, president of the Inventors Workshop International, the
co-sponsor of the trade show.
   The Small Business Administration is the other sponsor of the
three-day expo.
   ``This is like a lottery. This is a gamble,'' said Joseph Bland
of Santa Barbara on opening day Friday.
   Bland, a ``third-generation inventor'' whose grandfather created
an early automatic transmission, is displaying a valved-cell engine
that he says can improve fuel economy by 200 percent.
   The odds of a licensing agreement with a major auto firm are
long, he said, but he might try marketing his design as an auto
supply store kit. He said he has spent $5,000 over three years in
legal fees to patent his design.
   Inventors are often ``a little nuts,'' but must be tenacious,
too, Bland said.
   ``I can have the greatest idea in the world, but if I don't
carry it through it will die,'' he said.
   Fred Roberts of Clarksville, Tenn., is confident there is a
place in consumers' hearts for his toilet-training seat.
   ``With so many mothers working, there's no mommies to potty
train kids. This motivates children and speeds training up,''
Roberts said.
   The wooden seats, decorated with the face of a dog, teddy bear
or other animal, have an electronic microchip that allows parents
to record words of encouragement for their child.
   After a successful session, the potty plays such tunes as
``Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'' and the ``Hallelujah
Chorus,'' the animal's lighted eyes flash and the wooden ears wag.
   Roberts said investors have put $1 million into his recently
patented invention, which he said was a hit when tested in day-care
centers.
   Another Anaheim exhibitor, Mike Hodson, traveled from Wasilla,
Alaska, seeking exposure and a possible licensing agreement for a
puzzle akin to a Rubik's Cube. ``Frustum'' is designed in a trendy
New Age pyramid shape.
   At the Invention Convention in Pasadena, some 250 exhibitors are
grouped by inventions to improve the planet, improve human life,
and fad or fun creations, said spokeswoman Suzanne Milstead.
   A ``Turtle Pack,'' which converts from a backpack to sleeping
tent to chair, is billed as a possible solution to the homeless
problem. Another item being displayed is the ``Mini-Flush,'' which
reduces the amount of water used in each flush of a toilet.
   The three-day convention opening today is intended to connect
inventors with companies or people interested in buying,
franchising or investing in new products, she said.
   But the independent tinkerer also plays an important social role.
   ``The inventor may be the person who will help save our planet''
as it runs out of resources, she said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, who met this week with Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein on the Persian Gulf crisis, has traveled
the world as a self-appointed diplomat to pursue a host of missions
of his own making.
   The longtime civil rights activist and unsuccessful presidential
candidate has visited dozens of countries and conferred with more
than 60 heads of state.
   One of Jackson's biggest coups came in 1984, when he went to
Syria to secure the release of Navy Lt. Robert O. Goodman Jr.,
whose jet bomber was shot down during a raid over Syrian
antiaircraft positions in Lebanon's central mountains.
   Jackson, who at the time was running for the Democratic
presidential nomination, brought Goodman home to the United States
a month after the pilot was shot down. Jackson called on President
Reagan to meet personally with Syrian President Hafez Assad to try
to reduce tension between the two countries.
   Assad's assistance to Jackson was seen as a clever move to
influence American public opinion to change Reagan's foreign policy
in the region.
   Over the years, Jackson's efforts in international diplomacy
have taken him around the globe and provoked controversy on more
than one occasion.
   He has hugged Yasser Arafat in Lebanon, accepted a cigar from
Fidel Castro in Cuba, conferred with Pope John Paul II in Rome and
advocated anti-apartheid civil disobedience in South Africa.
   A photograph of Jackson embracing Arafat, the leader of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, during a 1979 visit to the
Middle East still angers many American Jews and caused him trouble
with Jewish voters during his presidential campaigns. At one point
during the 1988 campaign, Jackson met with Jewish leaders in what
he described as an ``a step toward healing the wounds.''
   Jackson said earlier this week he hoped to keep adversaries in
the gulf talking in order to avoid war in the Middle East but that
he was making the trip as a journalist, and would not be engaged in
diplomatic negotiations.
   Jackson, who flew to Iraq for the U.S. television show ``Inside
Edition,'' met Thursday with Saddam and Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz.
   He met first with Aziz, who explained to him the reasons behind
Iraq's annexation of Kuwait, and later with Saddam, Iraqi officials
said. No details of the meeting with Saddam were released
immediately.
   Jackson visited the Persian Gulf in 1987, meeting Saudi Arabian
and Jordanian leaders and delivering 600 pounds of Christmas gifts
for the crew of a U.S. warship.
   In 1984, Jackson visited Castro, who then released some two
dozen Americans from his jails. He also traveled to Nicaragua,
where he praised the Sandinista government, to Panama and to El
Salvador, where he tried to mediate differences between Salvadoran
rebels and then-President Napoleon Duarte.
   He paid his first visit to South Africa in more than a decade in
February, when he met with black leader Nelson Mandela upon his
release after 27 years in prison. Jackson had been refused a visa
since 1979.
   A year earlier, he was in Moscow to promote aid to victims of
the December 1988 earthquake in Armenia and to assess the economic
and political reforms of Mikhail Gorbachev.

   Dozens of men were under scrutiny today
in the slayings of five college students, but attention focused on
an 18-year-old University of Florida freshman charged with
assaulting his grandmother.
   Edward Louis Humphrey, 18, was jailed with bail set at $1
million bond and authorities acknowledged Friday he was being
investigated over the slayings at off-campus apartments in this
northern Florida town.
   Police sealed his apartment and searched for clues in the
garbage.
   ``There's a lot of good information that we have received that
seems to bear some credence that he may be a possible suspect,''
police Lt. Sadie Darnell said.
   Humphrey was among as many as 100 people being checked out by
homicide detectives, Darnell said. About 600 law enforcement
officials are involved in the hunt.
   Also mentioned was Warren Virgil Tinch, a fugitive wanted in an
Ohio mutilation murder who was allegedly spotted in Gainesville and
nearby Ocala about a week before the slayings.
   The victims _ students at either the University of Florida or
Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville _ were found stabbed to
death on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.
   Investigators said three of the four women were mutilated, and
that the killer appeared to have a grudge against petite brunettes
with shoulder-length hair.
   A woman who lived at the Gatorwood apartments where the bodies
of the last two victims _ roommates Tracy Inez Paules and Manuel R.
Taboada _ were found told the Sun-Sentinel in Fort Lauderdale that
Humphrey had a ``major crush on Tracy.''
   Humphrey lived at the apartment complex for a time this summer
until he was evicted.
   ``He'd fall over himself to be near her or to help her,'' said
Rachel Olivier, 22. ``He'd go and sit by the pool and watch when
she'd come out.''
   Investigators, who earlier took semen and blood samples from the
crime scenes, took a blood sample from Humphrey, said his public
defender, Randy Moore.
   In Sharpes, Brevard County Judge Kerry Evander ruled there was
reason to hold Humphrey on $1 million bond pending trial in October
on the assault charge.
   ``Innocent 'til proven guilty,'' Humphrey said in a clear voice
at the hearing.
   Humphrey was arrested Thursday at his grandmother's home in
Indialantic, some 180 miles southeast of Gainesville. He was
charged with aggravated battery on a person over 65.
   Assistant State Attorney Michael Hunt said prosecutors sought
the high bond because ``he would appear to be a threat to members
of his family and the community.''
   But Hunt confirmed state investigators had talked to prosecutors
about a possible link to the slayings.
   Gainesville police sealed off Humphrey's apartment Thursday and
questioned anyone attempting to enter the property, located about
three miles west of campus.
   A Florida Department of Law Enforcement plane followed Humphrey,
who had been under surveillance since Tuesday, as he drove from
Gainesville to his grandmother's home Wednesday. Neighbors said he
had emotional problems since he received a severe head injury in a
traffic accident more than a year ago.
   Erik Bedesem, 19, who described himself as Humphrey's best
friend, said Humphrey was injured after he jumped out of his
brother's car in a failed suicide attempt. He said Humphrey was
taking lithium, a medication prescribed to stabilize mental illness.
   Funerals were held Friday for four victims in their hometowns:
Christina Powell, 17, of Jacksonville; Christa Hoyt, 18, of
Newberry; and Ms. Paules and Taboada, both 23 and from the Miami
area. Church services were held Thursday for Miss Powell's
roommate, Sonja Larson, 18, of Deerfield Beach.

   An Iraqi Airways Jumbo Jet was scheduled to
ferry scores of foreign women and children out of Iraq and occupied
Kuwait on Saturday, a senior airline official said.
   One plane flew to Kuwait on Saturday morning to bring to Baghdad
an unspecified number of foreign women and children who would join
the others flying West, said a source traveling with American civil
rights leader Jesse Jackson.
   Jackson was on the flight to Kuwait and was to accompany
evacuees all the way to Washington, said the airline official and
Michael Cheers, a photographer traveling with Jackson.
   Cheers said the Iraqi Airways plane took off for Kuwait _ a
one-hour flight _ at 11 a.m. (3 a.m. EDT).
   Officials say 237 American and other foreign women and children
have gathered at the Melia Mansour Hotel in Baghdad since Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday said he would allow foreign
women and minors standed in Iraq and Kuwait to leave.
   It was not immediately known how many Americans would be on the
flight from Baghdad, and it was not clear if Jackson had a role in
securing the release of the foreigners.
   A State Department spokesman in Washington said the department
had heard ``several rumors over the past few days'' about possible
flights out for the hostages, but had no confirmation of today's
possible departure. ``We're very hopeful,'' he said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The airline official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
he was told by authorities to ready a Boeing 747 for the evacuation
from Baghdad. The flight was expected to take off at 6 p.m. (10
a.m. EDT), he said.
   It was to stop first in Amman, the Jordanian capital, and then
fly on to London, Paris and finally Washington, the airline
official said.
   The airline official said he did not know how many people will
be aboard the Boeing 747 after Jackson returns from Kuwait with
more evacuees.
   Jumbo jets can carry more than 400 passengers.
   Iraq's flag carrier will bring home an unspecified number of
Iraqis stranded in the European capitals and in the United States
since the Iraqis invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the airline official
said.
   Saddam has said the male foreigners were to stay in Iraq as
``guests'' to shield his country against a possible attack by
U.S.-led multinational forces that assembled in Saudi Arabia after
the invasion and subsequent annexation of Kuwait.
   About 21,000 Westerners, including 3,000 Americans, were in Iraq
and Kuwait when the Persian Gulf crisis erupted.

<HEAD>Child Rights Convention Comes Into Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement guaranteeing children the
right to a healthy environment free from abuse or exploitation
comes into force this weekend.
   The United Global Convention on the Rights of the Child takes
effect Sunday in the 29 nations that have ratified it.
   In addition, 105 nations including all of Europe and the Soviet
Union have signed the convention, indicating their intention to
ratify it, but the accord is not binding on them until they do. The
United States has not yet signed.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said in a statement
the convention ``addresses the needs of those who are humanity's
most vulnerable as well as its most cherished resource.''
   He said the speed with which states ratified the convention and
its entry into force less than a year after its adoption, showed
the international community's deep commitment to enhancing respect
for the dignity, well-being and development of the child.''
   The General Assembly unanimously adopted the convention last
December.
   The U.N. Children's Fund and many governments and private
agencies say the agreement sets new standards for fighting child
neglect, sexual exploitation and other abuse.
   It wraps together all the international laws concerning the
rights of minors that were scattered among more than 80 treaties
and declarations drafted over the last 60 years.
   The convention, however, has engendered controversy because it
allows anyone 15 years of age or older to be drafted into military
service, a provision the U.S. administration supported.
   More than 95,000 child soldiers lost their lives in the
Iran-Iraq war, and over 200,000 15-to-17-year-olds serve in various
armed forces worldwide, officials said.
   Norway, Sweden, France, West Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia,
Canada, Mexico and other nations wanted the draft age raised to at
least 17, and the Soviet Union said it would go along with that
standard.
   The United States, however, held out for keeping the draft age
at 15, arguing that the 1949 Geneva Conventions on warfare and the
1977 Additional Protocols specify that age, and the new convention
should conform.
   In another controversial issue, the accord sets the end of
childhood at age 18, but does not say whether childhood begins at
birth or at some point earlier. That had divided anti-abortion and
pro-choice advocates.
   The convention glosses over abortion, stating only in the
non-binding preamble that children deserve special protection
``before as well as after birth.''
   The United States supported the inclusion of the reference to
the rights of the unborn.
   Recognition of children as individuals with inalienable rights
began under international law in 1924, when the League of Nations
adopted the Geneva Declaration on children's rights. That abolished
the common custom of treating children as the property of their
fathers.
   The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the right
of free association and guarantees a child the right to enjoy a
family life.
   It extends international legal protection to the adoption
procedure. Ratifying governments are required to provide adoption
services so orphans can have access to family life.
   Under another provision, the accord says children may not be
separated from their parents, except for the child's well-being.
They also cannot be sold into prostitution, slavery, or used as
bonded laborers to pay off parents' debts.
   The convention, however, lets ratifying nations set the minimum
age for child laborers and regulate working conditions.
   Nations signing the convention must report periodically to a new
U.N. Committee on the Rights of the Child.
   The first ``World Summit for Children'' will be held in late
September at U.N. Headquarters to mobilize the world's governments
to save up to 100 million children from death by disease and
malnutrition in the 1990s.
   Canada, Egypt, Mali, Mexico, Pakistan and Sweden are
cosponsoring the event to push governments to redirect spending
from military budgets and payments on their foreign debts in favor
of health and nutrition.
   The global gathering will take place during the next General
Assembly.

<HEAD>Pope Hopes to Refocus Attention on Poor in Trip to Africa</HEAD>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II began his seventh voyage to Africa
today, a trip the Vatican hopes will refocus world attention on the
plight of the poor when all eyes are turned to the Persian Gulf.
   The 70-year-old pontiff was flying by special Alitalia Airbus to
Dar es Salaam, capital of the East African nation of Tanzania, the
first leg of a 10-day tour that will also take him to Burundi,
Rwanda and the Ivory Coast.
   The plane made an hourlong stopover on the Mediterranean island
of Malta. Church bells pealed when the jet landed, and the pope,
stepping onto the aircraft's stairs, waved to a crowd at the
airport. John Paul visited the island for three days in May.
   John Paul's 49th foreign pilgrimage will wrap up Sept. 10 with
the consecration of a huge controversial basilica in Ivory Coast
that rivals St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.
   The Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano on Friday said the
pope's trip will serve to remind the world of Africa's chronic
poverty, noting that the poor stand to suffer most from the Middle
East crisis, which began when Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   The paper described the trip as ``a journey of peace to the land
of the poor at a time when, before the marshalling of arms, the
world seems to wince almost only at the fluctuations in the stock
markets.''
   ``What new price will African poverty have to pay as a result of
this new crisis?'' L'Osservatore Romano said. ``If the developed
world fears recession, then what about those who already live off
the crumbs from the table of the rich?''
   In all, the pope will travel 11,600 miles and deliver 41
speeches.
   Vatican officials say the pope will speak on AIDS, which is
particularly widespread in Africa.
   The pope has expressed solidarity with AIDS sufferers, while
condemning the sexual behavior that can transmit the disease and
ruling out the use of condoms as a means of checking its spread.
   According to the latest church statistics, the number of
Catholics in Africa has increased by 50 percent in the past 10
years _ to a total of about 75 million, or 13 percent of the
continent's population.
   Moslems are Tanzania's largest religious group, representing
about one-fourth of the population of 25 million. Catholics make up
21 percent, with Protestants, Anglicans and animists accounting for
the rest.
   Islam and the Catholic Church, the two largest religious groups
in the world, have sometimes been at odds as they compete for
converts in Africa.
   In Tanzania, church officials describe an overall situation of
harmony between the two faiths, although they see signs of
potential conflict with fundamentalists favoring the imposition of
the Sharia, or Islamic law.
   In Burundi, the pope's visit will mark the end of conflict
between church and state. Only three years ago, all foreign
missionaries had been expelled, local priests detained, weekday
church services banned and religious education halted.
   But since President Pierre Buyoya took power in a 1987 coup,
religious freedom has been restored and the church is working with
the government to promote unity in a nation often torn by violence
between the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups.
   The pope will spend two nights each in Burundi and Rwanda before
traveling across the continent to the West African nation of Ivory
Coast, where he will end his trip Sept. 10 by consecrating the
Basilica of Our Lady of Peace.
   The basilica, modeled on St. Peter's and nearly as large, was
built by President Felix Houphouet-Boigny in his hometown of
Yamoussoukro at a cost put by the government at $133 million. The
president says he is paying for the church with his own money.
   But critics have charged the cost may be twice as high and
described the basilica as a display of opulence in a poor country
facing severe economic crisis.
   The pope waited to consecrate the basilica until
Houphouet-Boigny agreed to build a hospital on the grounds.
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro said the Holy See is not
embarrassed by the basilica, pointing out the money was not spent
on weapons. He also wondered why there was no similar outcry over
the construction of mosques in Morocco, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and
Rome that are even bigger.

   Thirteen million Japanese took part in a nationwide
disaster drill today, many of them being evacuated from
smoke-filled department stores or airlifted from elevated
expressways and rooftops.
   The drill in Tokyo and nine other cities, conducted annually
since 1971, marked the 67th anniversary of the Great Kanto
Earthquake
   The powerful temblor later estimated at 7.9 on the Richter scale
hit Tokyo and surrounding areas in 1923 and killed 140,000 people.
   Following last October's San Francisco earthquake, National Land
Agency officials decided the emphasis of this year's exercise would
be on ways to cope with possible urban disasters. Officials said
today's drill involved 13 million people.
   Drill organizers released smoke in department stores and train
stations to replicate conditions during a fire.
   In Tokyo's Edogawa Ward, a seven-mile section of the elevated
Metropolitan expressway was closed for about 30 minutes as a large
helicopter used a rope to lift passengers from their cars in a
rescue drill.
   It was the first such drill on an elevated expressway in Japan,
the officials said.
   National Land Agency chief Moriyoshi Sato flew in another
helicopter to inspect an airdrop of emergency supplies, simulations
of rescues of people from a collapsed house and other evacuation
drills.
   ``As our country is naturally subject to disasters caused by
earthquakes, typhoons and volcanic eruptions, the (government) will
strive further to strengthen anti-disaster measures,'' Kyodo News
Service quoted Sato as telling about 10,000 people who participated
in the drill.
   Experts say an earthquake similar to the one in 1923 could hit
the Tokyo region at any time. The Japanese archipelago sits along a
fault line between massive tectonic plates which slowly grind
against each other.

<HEAD>Solar-Powered Plane Heads Toward Kitty Hawk to Close
Transcontinental Flight</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A solar-powered airplane is slowly nearing
the end of its wind-tossed odyssey from California to Kitty Hawk,
N.C., the birthplace of powered flight.
   After more than six weeks, sometimes being blown the wrong way,
aviator Eric Raymond still has about 240 miles to go in his
198-pound plane, Sun Seeker. But strong headwinds appear to have
dashed his hopes of reaching Kitty Hawk during the Labor Day
weekend, said his wife, Aida.
   ``He's getting desperate to get there. He just wants to finish
the flight,'' Mrs. Raymond said in a telephone interview Friday.
   Meanwhile, the welcome mat is out where Orville and Wilbur
Wright piloted a motor-powered airplane for the first time in 1903.
   ``There's a lot of excitement here,'' said Nancy McWilliams,
spokeswoman for Kitty Hawk Kites, a hang glider school planning a
reception for Raymond's arrival. ``It's been the talk of the town
for the last month. Wherever I go, people say, `Where's Eric?
When's Eric arriving?'''
   Raymond, 33, a former national hang gliding champion had logged
only 18 miles for the day when he landed Friday afternoon at
Virginia Tech Airport at Blacksburg, Va., about 25 miles west of
Roanoke, Va.
   ``We've been very upset because the delays we've had on this
trip have had nothing to do with the plane, they were because of
the weather,'' Mrs. Raymond said.
   ``We thought he was going to land at Kitty Hawk on Sunday,'' she
said. ``Now the weather forecast is saying the strong headwinds
will keep up for another four days after today and he may not be
able to fly until they stop.
   ``The weather forecast has been so wrong all along, we're just
hoping it'll be wrong again,'' she said.
   When Raymond took off from the New River Valley Airport in
Virginia on Friday, he had 260 miles to go, and had logged 2,168
miles in 102 hours and 35 minutes in the air.
   On Thursday, he braved the Appalachians, gaining 132 miles
before landing about 35 miles west of Roanoke.
   It was July 16 when Raymond first took off from Desert Center,
beginning his quest to prove an ultralight aircraft partially
powered by solar energy could cross the United States.
   Rather than set a flying record, Raymond wants to show solar
power's usefulness, said trip spokesman Jack Whitehouse. The plane
has solar cells on its surfaces to run an electrical motor that
turns its propeller.
   The motor is used for takeoffs and landings. After takeoff, the
motor is turned off and the plane rides the thermals like an
ultralight glider.
   Two days after the sojourn began, the craft was seriously
damaged in an aborted takeoff from Lordsburg, N.M.
   Raymond and his ground crew brought the craft back by land to
Lake Elsinore for repairs. Raymond manufactured and sold hang
gliding equipment there until six months ago, when he devoted
himself to the Sun Seeker project.
   The Sun Seeker had better luck after taking off again from
Desert Center on Aug. 2.
   Although the craft hasn't crashed since, strong headwinds and
rain along the way have made for slow going.
   In the month since, the Sun Seeker has remained grounded on
eight days because of bad weather. One day the craft was forced to
land after strong headwinds pushed it backwards.

   Clear skies prevailed across much of the nation today, and the
southern Plains braced for another day of record temperatures that
are likely to scorch the region through Labor Day.
   Today's forecast called for sunshine and temperatures in the 80s
from the Ohio Valley to New England.
   Rain was expected in the Carolinas, central Georgia, southern
Alabama and south-coastal Texas.
   Denver had a touch of showers early today, and scattered rain
was likely across the Rockies, from Wyoming southward.
   A stationary high pressure over north Texas was expected to hold
the heat wave over the southern Plains and Mississippi River valley
until Monday.
   On Friday, temperatures soared to 105 degrees and higher in
Concordia, Kan., and the Texas towns of Austin, Fort Worth and Waco.
   The forecast in the far West called for dry weather, with
temperatures in the 80s in the Northwest, 90s in central California
and 100s in desert regions.
   The nation's high on Friday was 111 degrees at Borrego Springs,
Calif. and Lake Havasu City and Yuma in Arizona.

   The government imposed an indefinite
curfew on three northern Tamil districts today to enable troops to
conduct operations against Tamil separatist guerrillas, military
officials said.
   The curfew took effect at early this morning in Vavuniya,
Mullaitivu and Mannar, and was announced over state radio. A curfew
also was imposed in Kilinochchi, a northern town.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, gave no
details of the planned military operations.
   Sri Lankan forces control towns in the districts, but the
countryside is under the control of the Tamil Tiger rebels fighting
a 7-year-old war for independence.
   Four soldiers, six Tamil rebels and two civilians were killed
Friday in the north and east of this Indian Ocean island off
India's southern coast, officials said.
   The four soldiers were killed and five more wounded Friday when
a foot patrol triggered a land mine on Mandaitivu Island, Jaffna
Peninsula, officials said.
   The Sri Lankan army was stalled at Mandaitivu on the 11th day of
an offensive to end a rebel siege of the 23-man army garrison in
Jaffna Fort. The fort on the edge of Jaffna city is linked to the
islands by a heavily mined causeway the troops have failed to
cross. It has been cut off for 10 weeks.
   The six rebels were killed when troops opened fire at the
guerrillas, who had torched two mosques and Moslem homes in
Palamunai, eastern Batticaloa district Friday, the officials said.
   The two civilians _ a Moslem and a Tamil woman _ were killed by
Tamil rebels in separate attacks in the east, the officials said.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed since Tamil rebels began
their separatist rebellion in 1983.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million population
and allege discrimination by Sinhalese, who account for 75 percent
of the population.

<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. George Deukmejian's plan to
require California homeowners to pay up to $60 a year for mandatory
earthquake coverage was approved by the Legislature.
   The bill was inspired by the October 1989 Northern California
quake that killed 62 people, destroyed more than 1,000 homes and
caused $7 billion in damage. It was sent to Deukmejian's desk
Friday evening after votes of 28-3 in the Senate and 43-21 in the
Assembly.
   The bill would provide about 6.5 million property owners with up
to $15,000 of quake insurance for an annual surcharge of between
$12 and $60.
   It would set up a state-backed insurance pool that would be used
to partly recompense homeowners' losses in the event of a quake. It
initially would provide up to $15,000 in money that a homeowner
would use to bridge the gap left uncovered by the average
deductible.
   Quake insurance deductibles average about 10 percent of the
market value of a home. If a home is completely destroyed, a
customer can replace the house by meeting the cost of the
deductible, or about $15,000 on a $150,000 dwelling.
   But most of the 24,000 quake-damaged homes were not completely
destroyed, suffering an average of $8,000 in losses each. That was
usually far less than the deductible and had to be paid by the
homeowner.
   Deukmejian has 10 days to sign the bill, veto it or let it
become law without his signature.

   The foreign ministers of China and the Soviet
Union said today that peaceful means should be used to solve the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   After three hours of talks with his Chinese counterpart, Qian
Qichen, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze told
journalists the two nations were willing to cooperate to peacefully
resolve the standoff.
   ``We did not have any disagreements,'' Shevardnadze said. ``We
both support peaceful means and peaceful channels to solve the gulf
crisis.''
   He stopped short, however, of directly condemning the use of
force in the region.
   Both China and the Soviet Union reluctantly supported a United
Nations resolution authorizing force to back economic sanctions
against Iraq, which invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   China said from the start it was opposed to the use of force and
the Soviet Union backed the U.S.-proposed U.N. Security Council
initiative only after stalling for more than a week.
   Qian said Moscow and Beijing had ``nearly identical'' positions.
   ``The present task is that parties should avoid the use of force
to prevent an acceleration into war,'' Qian said in a separate
meeting with journalists.
   The United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and other
nations have warships in the gulf region. U.S. vessels are
searching ships transiting the region they suspect might be
breaking the embargo.
   In addition, the United States has sent 60,000 troops and dozens
of fighter planes to Saudi Arabia aimed at discouraging any move by
Iraq to seize more territory.
   Both foreign ministers stressed the importance of an Arab
settlement to the Middle East crisis. They did not say, however,
what peaceful means they would be willing to pursue jointly toward
resolving the Middle East crisis.
   They said they intended to keep open a triangle of communication
between their nations and the United States.
   Shevardnadze said his talks with Qian raised Sino-Soviet
relations to a ``unified new level in cooperation.''
   The Communist powers split over ideological differences in 1960,
but in the last decade relations steadily improved, culminating
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's May 1989 visit to Beijing to
normalize ties.
   Shevaradnadze said the two sides would hold talks on their
shared 4,300 mile border on Sept. 10 in Moscow. China and the
Soviiet Union came close to going to war after several bloody
border clashes in 1969.
   Gorbachev has pledged to withdraw 120,000 of the estimated
500,000 Soviet troops stationed along the border by year's end.
   Qian said a new atmosphere of trust now exists between the two
nations.
   Shevardnadze, on an eight-day, three-nation tour, visits North
Korea on Sunday and Monday before traveling to Japan.

   An enterprising novelty merchant said he
wants to wipe out Iraq's Saddam Hussein _ with toilet paper.
   The bathroom tissue bearing Saddam's picture is selling fast,
says Mark Polish, 49, president of the Philadelphia T-Shirt Museum,
a downtown manufacturer and wholesale distributor of novelty items.
   So far, 2,700 rolls have been sold, he said Friday.
   ``Already my inventory has been wiped out,'' Polish quipped.
   When Iraq invaded Kuwait, Polish immediately had his Missouri
supplier start printing up rolls of toilet paper bearing the Iraqi
leader's picture and the message, ``Hussein's Insane.''
   ``I'm always laughing,'' Polish said. ``My object is to make
people smile. It makes life a little more enjoyable. Nothing's
wrong with that, is there?''
   He says stores nationwide have bought the Saddam roll, with
retail prices running about $5 each.
   ``One New Jersey woman came into my place and bought three
rolls, which she's going to send to her son stationed with an Army
unit in Saudi Arabia,'' Polish said. ``She thinks he'll enjoy using
it.''

   A year after a Labor Day marred by
riots and looting, this resort city is trying to make people forget
by putting on its finest.
   Many are staying away because they remember only the worst.
   ``The table is set. We've got our best linen, best china, best
silver, best crystal,'' Andrew Fine, co-chairman of the Community
Coordination Committee, said Friday.
   Lingering fears that the rioting of last year might be repeated
are making some of the preparations unnecessary as the city's
hotels _ full to capacity during the 1989 Labor Day holiday _ are
less than half full today.
   City Manager Aubrey Watts said that hotels were at 48 percent
occupancy Friday night, but: ``It appears to be rising.''
   The end-of-summer party, which for the past 10 years has
attracted students from predominantly black East Coast colleges,
last year erupted in looting and violent confrontations between
youths and police. Damage was estimated at more than $1.4 million.
   Many of the young people and civil rights leaders said the
clashes were racially motivated and the city did not want black
visitors. City officials said the problem was one of too many
people in too small an area with too little to do.
   More than 100,000 young people jammed the city's beachfront
strip for the 1989 Labor Day weekend.
   Early today, young people walked and rode bicycles along the
oceanfront thoroughfare. City police officers and state troopers
were out in force, walking in pairs and riding horses. Clergymen
accompanied many of the patrols, ready to act as peacemakers.
   Police Chief Charles R. Wall declined to say how many officers
were on patrol, but said the entire 607-member force is working
12-hour shifts over the weekend.
   Police said three men in a car fired into an unoccupied car
eight blocks from the oceanfront early today. No one was injured,
and there were no arrests.
   Police said they made only a handful of arrests for public
drunkenness.
   ``I've never seen it this quiet on a Friday night or any other
night for that matter,'' said Dot Keller, who works at Clarke's Pub.
   Last year, police backed by state troopers and the National
Guard twice cleared the oceanfront after looting broke out.
   Hundreds of people were arrested or cited, and more than 50 were
injured. Most of those arrested were local residents, not college
students.
   This year the city appointed a biracial committee, including
students, to plan the event _ dubbed Laborfest. Local merchants
raised more than $100,000 to provide entertainment along the
oceanfront.
   Despite local efforts, some black students at schools that
previously frequented Virginia Beach called for a boycott.
   Mayor Meyera Oberndorf said she was confident the Labor Day
weekend would be a successful contrast to last year's violence.
   ``We will be able to show a watching world that many things are
possible when people trust and show respect,'' she said Friday
night.
   But some merchants boarded up storefronts for the weekend.
   Norfolk State University helped book two nights of entertainment
at a city park about four miles from the oceanfront, hoping to
spread out crowds that used to congregate solely at the beach.
   The city also closed a section of the oceanfront to cars and set
up satellite parking lots away from the beach serviced by shuttle
buses.

   The sighting of a makeshift water-collection
device on a South Pacific island could be a clue in the
disappearance of U.S. aviator Amelia Earhart during a 1937
globe-circling flight, researchers said.
   The World War II-era sighting by a former Coast Guard serviceman
was reported in a letter to Rick Gillespie, executive director of
the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery in
Wilmington, Del.
   ``More and more, it looks like we're closing in on learning
exactly what happened,'' he said Wednesday.
   Richard Evans, 64, of Annville, Pa., wrote describing the
rain-water collection apparatus he found while exploring an
isolated section of Nikumaroro, about 1,000 miles northeast of Fiji.
   Investigators last year found another possible clue to the
Earhart disappearance on the island, a navigator's bookcase that
could have come from Earhart's two-engine Lockheed Electra airplane.
   Evans described the water-catching device as a canvas funnel
draining into a 5-foot-by-2-foot metal container.
   ``We didn't build it and the natives didn't build it. If it's
Earhart's, who knows? People are really getting excited about it,
though,'' said Evans, who was assigned to the now-uninhabited
island to help build a Coast Guard navigation and communications
base.
   Gillespie said the dimensions of the canvas and container, as
described by Evans, closely match the engine covers and one of the
149-gallon fuel tanks from Earhart's plane.
   It could suggest Ms. Earhart and her navigator, Fred Noonan,
survived a landing there in July 1937 and waited in vain for
rescue, Gillespie said. Evans said he wrote the letter to Gillespie
after reading a news report on the hunt for Earhart's plane.
   ``The water-collection structure was on the windward side of the
island. The water's rough and you can't land a boat. But it was a
good spot if you were looking for a rescue plane,'' said Gillespie.
   Researchers theorize Earhart and Noonan landed on the island's
coral reef flat, but waves and tides carried the plane into the
2,000-foot-deep trench surrounding the atoll.
   The team is scheduled to visit the island next summer and may
conduct deep-water probes for the plane.
   ``If it's down there, the water is cold enough that it should be
well preserved,'' Gillespie said.
   Earhart's possible route was tracked to the island by two
retired military aviators who used 1930s navigation techniques to
plot her likely course.
   Tom Willi and Tom Gannon of Fort Walton Beach, Fla., persuaded
the aicraft recovery group to mount their $250,000 expedition last
year.

<HEAD>Syrian Troops Deploy Around Christian Enclave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian troops and Lebanese soldiers loyal
to President Elias Hrawi today deployed around the gateways into
the Christian enclave amid reports an offensive to crush rebel Gen.
Michel Aoun was imminent.
   Security sources said hundreds of Syrians and mainly Moslem
Lebanese troops were taking up positions along the western side of
the Green Line dividing Beirut into Moslem and Christian sectors.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Syrians also were deploying in the hills to the north and east of
the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north of Beirut.
   The enclave, in which an estimated 1 million Christians live,
has been ringed by the Syrians and their militia allies since
April, when Aoun declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive out the
Syrians.
   The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio said Aoun has ringed his
headquarters in the shell-wrecked presidential palace in Beirut's
eastern Baabda suburb with tanks to confront any attack.
   The buildup followed a summit in Damascus Wednesday between
Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad, who pledged to provide the
Lebanese government with ``any assisstance needed to extend its
authority over the whole of Lebanon.''
   Aoun controls about 40 percent of the enclave after an
eight-month power struggle with Christian militia chieftain Samir
Geagea for control of the territory. Aoun refuses to recognize
Hrawi, who was elected Nov. 24 to implement an Arab League-brokered
plan to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun rejects the plan because it does not guarantee the
withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops deployed in Lebanon under a 1976
Arab league peacekeeping mandate. He considers the Syrians, who
have sided with the Moslems, an army of occupation.
   The peace plan, ratified by the Lebanese parliament in October,
gives the Moslems, who make up about 55 percent of Lebanon's 4
million people, an eqaul share of power with the traditionally
dominant Christians.
   Hrawi has sacked Aoun as interim prime minister and army
commander. But the general refuses to step down or hand over the
ruined presidential palace that is a symbol of constitutional
authority in Lebanon.
   Voice of the Nation, along with other radio stations and Beirut
newspapers, predicted that Hrawi's troops and Syrian forces would
soon launch an assault to evict Aoun from Baabda if he refused to
move out peacefully.
   The leftist As-Safir daily said civilians were fleeing Baabda
and its Aoun-controlled environs because they feared an attack was
likely.
   Aoun commands about 19,000 mainly Christian troops. It was not
immediately clear how many troops the Syrians were deploying around
the enclave.
   Hrawi's forces include 22,000 Moslem troops commanded by Gen.
Emil Lahoud, but they are poorly equipped.
   Many have sat on the sidelines of the civil war for the last few
years, and it was not clear whether they would participate in an
assault on Aoun.
   Geagea, Aoun's Christian rival and commander of the Lebanese
Forces militia, has at least 6,000 fighters and thousands of
reservists.
   It was not clear whether Geagea, who has said he accepts the
peace plan, would participate in an offensive against the general.

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar and Iraq's foreign minister discussed a plan to deploy an
Arab peacekeeping force as a buffer between U.S. and Iraqi troops,
Jordanian officials said today.
   The senior officials declined to say how much of the plan needed
to be cleared with the governments involved. But one official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, hinted that there would be an
announcement later today.
   Sources also said the Soviet Union might play a mediating role
in working out a simultaneous withdrawal of Iraqi forces from
Kuwait and the multinational force in Saudi Arabia. The United
States has repeatedly said its forces will not withdraw from the
gulf region until Iraqi soldiers have left Kuwait.
   Perez de Cuellar, and the Iraqi foreign minister, Tariq Aziz,
held a second day of talks on the Persian Gulf crisis today.
   Earlier, an official said both were optimistic.
   The two discussed prospects for freeing foreign hostages in Iraq
and for a settlement in Kuwait, the sources said.
   ``The situation is very promising,'' said a senior Jordanian
source with access to the talks. He refused to elaborate.
   Perez de Cuellar and Aziz are trying to find common ground to
defuse the crisis that began with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
They met today after conferring for 2{ hours with Crown Prince
Hassan at the royal palace.
   Hassan is regent in the absence of King Hussein, who is on a
foreign tour seeking support for an Arab solution of the crisis
that began with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and later
annexation of its oil-rich neighbor.
   As Hussein continued his diplomatic mission, the Arab League
concluded a two-day meeting in Egypt. The League hardened its
position on the invasion by demanding Iraq pay war reparations to
Kuwait after withdrawing its troops.
   The League also demanded that Iraq immediately free 21,000
Westerners, including 3,000 Americans, it has held hostage since
overrunning Kuwait.
   Only 13 of the League's 21 members were present to adopt the new
resolutions, indicating how the crisis has divided the Arab world.
   About 60,000 U.S. troops sent to Saudi Arabia face more than
200,000 Iraqi troops along the Saudi borders with Kuwait and Iraq.
In addition, dozens of warships from the United States and other
nations are patrolling the gulf region to back up U.N.-imposed
economic sanctions on Iraq.
   Arab countries opposed to the invasion also have sent small
contingents of soldiers to the multinational force led by the
United States.
   Perez de Cuellar and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz met in
the royal palace amid reports that Iraq would begin freeing foreign
women and children.
   Perez de Cuellar late Friday hailed Baghdad's decision to
release the women and children as ``an important step forward.''
   ``But from my point of view, this is not enough,'' he said. ``I
hope this first decision of the Iraqi government will be followed
by other decisions which will allow all foreigners to leave the
area.''
   The U.N. leader said a decision by Iraq to release all
foreigners would help reduce tension Middle East. Some of the
Westerners held captive in Iraq and Kuwait have been moved to
strategic installations to deter a U.S. attack.
   The U.N. chief has said he is not meeting Aziz to negotiate or
make concessions on the U.N. Security Council resolutions demanding
an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. He said his purpose
was to discuss all aspects of the problem with Aziz in an effort to
solve the crisis.

   A motorist who was stopped early today on
suspicion of drunken driving grabbed an officer's gun, wounding the
officer and a second policeman before shooting himself to death,
authorities said.
   Pembina County Sheriff's Deputy Miles Nelson stopped the suspect
on a possible charge of driving under the influence shortly after 1
a.m., according to Deputy Cal Cluchie.
   An ``altercation'' occurred in which the man took Nelson's
service handgun and shot him, Cluchie said.
   Nelson managed to call for assistance as the man fled. Cavalier
Police Chief James Johnson, responding to the call, was also
wounded as he attempted to stop the man, Cluchie said.
   The suspect was later found nearby with a fatal gunshot wound,
apparently self-inflicted, he said.
   Nelson was listed in critical condition at the United Hospital
in Grand Forks, and Johnson is listed in stable condition at
Pembina County Memorial Hospital.
   No other details were immediately available.
   Cavalier is located about 15 miles south of the Canadian border
in northeastern North Dakota.

<HEAD>California Legislature Rejects Moving Up Primary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal to move up California's
presidential primary from June to the first Tuesday in March, a
week after the nation's leadoff primary in New Hampshire, has been
defeated.
   Lawmakers could not agree on whether to let ballot measures
share the election.
   Republicans argued that Democrats could benefit if voter
initiatives were allowed to share the primary ballot. Democrats
would likely post a higher voter turnout in their drive to restore
their party to the White House, they said.
   Without ever voting on the proposed shift, the legislators
killed it Friday by voting down a constitutional amendment tied to
it by Ken Maddy, Republican leader of the state Senate. Such votes
require a two-thirds majority to pass.
   Supporters said moving the primary forward would change the
California election from an afterthought into the nation's dominant
early primary.
   The early vote was intended only for electing presidential
convention delegates, with primaries for congressional, legislative
and other races in June. But California's constitution requires
that any measure qualified for the ballot by voter initiative
petitions must go on the next statewide ballot.
   State initiatives in recent years have included huge property
tax cuts, a cigarette tax hike and major insurance, education and
environmental measures, so the early ballot could have allowed
voters of one party to decide major policy issues.
   The California primary, now one of the latest in the nation, has
not had a strong impact on a presidential nomination race since
1972, when George McGovern's victory in California cleared the way
for his nomination as the Democratic candidate.

<TEXT>
   After collaborating on an economic reform
proposal, rifts have developed between President Mikhail Gorbachev
and the leader of the nation's largest republic over the final
policy's scope and speed.
   The clash was a setback to reconciliation efforts between
Gorbachev and Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin, who
indicated he could adopt an independent policy for his republic
with a more market-oriented approach.
   Gorbachev said the government will choose from among four plans
and will try to stabilize the faltering economy within six months.
   The Soviet economy is wracked by shortages of everything from
medicine to cigarettes, and citizens are furious. Politicians are
pushing for economic reforms of varying speed and scope.
   Four separate panels are currently working on widely different
proposals to move the Soviet economy from a centrally planned,
command system to one driven primarily by market forces.
   ``We must come out with one program,'' Gorbachev said Friday.
``If we lose two or three months ... it will affect things in such
a way that we will have to make corrections not only in tactics but
strategy.''
   The commissions include a group supervised by Gorbachev and
Yeltsin, who favors faster moves toward a market economy than
Gorbachev and Kremlin leaders.
   They went to work after the national legislature, the Supreme
Soviet, rejected Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov's blueprint for a
transition to a market economy.
   The Supreme Soviet reconvenes Sept. 10 to take up the latest
proposals, which Gorbachev said would not be ready for another week.
   But Yeltsin has said that if the central Soviet government's
plan is not to his liking he will implement radical and swift
economic reform in Russia, the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Yeltsin believes Ryzhkov's plan would maintain the central
government's command system that he blames for causing the
country's economic problems. ``If implemented, it would lead to a
collapse,'' Yeltsin said.
   Gorbachev said serious measures would be taken in the next six
months to cut off Soviets' ability to accumulate ``hot money,'' the
term for income derived from black marketeering and other
activities.
   The Soviet Union suffers from what economists call a ``ruble
overhang,'' a supply of rubles far outstripping the supply of goods
available for purchase.
   Gorbachev did not say exactly how ``hot money'' would be
controlled and did not specify what other steps were under
consideration to stabilize the economy. He said the next stage of
economic reform would deal with prices, taxes, the government's
budget and the earning, distribution and use of foreign currency.
   Once the central government agrees on one of the reform plans,
he said, it wil be presented to the legislatures of the Soviet
republics. He acknowledged the proposals could face resistance.
   ``Everything is subjected to doubt, to meticulous analysis,''
Gorbachev said.
   He said the national legislature would also review the economic
reform plan and that afterward he would issue a presidential decree
confirming it.
   Ryzhkov's initial program, presented in May, called for drastic
price increases on bread and other items whose prices have remained
basically unchanged for decades. The program fueled panic buying
that made ill-stocked store shelves even barer.

   Bush administration sources said today that President Bush and
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet soon to discuss the
Middle East crisis, most likely in Helsinki, Finland. Details were
sketchy, but the sources said the meeting could take place as early
as next weekend. Although it has backed U.N. resolutions opposing
Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait, Moscow has taken a relatively small
role in trying to resolve the crisis.

   U.N. chief Javier Perez de Cuellar held a second day of talks
with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in Amman, Jordan. Senior
Jordanian officials said the two discussed the possible deployment
of Arab troops as a buffer between U.S. and Iraqi forces, and the
possibility of Moscow mediating a withdrawal of Iraqi forces from
Kuwait and the U.S.-led multinational force from Saudi Arabia. No
details were disclosed, but one official, speaking on condition of

   An Iraqi Airways jumbo jet was expected to ferry scores of

plane would stop first in Amman, Jordan, then fly to Paris, London

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein says all foreign women and
children can leave, but red tape has delayed their departures, and
Iraq continues to move foreign men to military installations to
shield them from a U.S. attack.

   U.S. diplomats in Iraqi-occupied Kuwait told the Rev. Jesse

   The diplomats, who have been resisting an order from Iraq to
shut down the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City, said they are running
out of water, their food is spoiling because they lack electricity
and no air-conditioning means they sleep outside for some relief
from the heat.

   Iraq began rationing food today in an effort to outlast the U.N.
embargo. Sources in Baghdad say coupon books have been issued and
food distribution centers have been set up.
   Long lines have formed at bakeries in Baghdad, and at food shops
in smaller towns, the sources said in telephone interviews. Flour,
rice, dried beans, grain and powdered milk have disappeared from
shops. Meat vanished days ago.
   Pharmacy shelves were empty of medicines, and hospital officials
spoke of dwindling supplies of antibiotics and anesthesia, the
sources said.

   As the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait begins its
second month, some experts from within and outside the government
believe direct U.S. military action may be the best way to end the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Britain, Israel and Saudi Arabia are said to be recommending the
military approach along with some members of Congress. Some within
the administration are offering the same advice, although President
Bush's spokesman dismissed such accounts as ``uninformed
speculation.''
   The crisis has prompted Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev to hold a summit meeting, perhaps as early as next
weekend in Helsinki, Finland, administration sources said.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a member of the Foreign Relations
Committee, has urged military action against Iraq. But among
lawmakers who left for the Persian Gulf Friday on a fact-finding
mission, none advocated an attack in comments to reporters.
   The commander of the U.S. forces in the Middle East, Army Gen.
H. Norman Schwarzkopf, ruled out the possibility that the United
States might initiate hostilities.
   ``There's not going to be any war unless the Iraqis attack,''
Schwarzkopf told reporters late Friday after spending the day
visiting American troops in northeast Saudi Arabia.
   Still, military commanders in the area say the capability of
attacking Iraq is there and growing by the day as more forces
arrive.
   Alan Keyes, a former top State Department official in the Reagan
administration, told the Cable News Network Friday, ``It may
require that we'll have to hit him (Saddam) once militarily before
he sees the light.''
   Bush dispatched U.S. forces to the region three weeks ago,
saying their mission was defensive. But Iraqi diplomats have noted
that the presence of Stealth fighters gives the United States an
offensive capability.
   The Washington Times reported Friday that Saudi Arabia, Britain
and Israel were urging President Bush to resolve the crisis with
military force.
   Leaders in those countries reason that the alternative would be
to leave oil-rich countries of the Persian Gulf at the mercy of
Iraq's conventional, chemical and nuclear weapons once U.S. and
other foreign forces leave the region, the newspaper said. Some
U.S. officials agree with this position, the Times said.
   Meanwhile, an Iraqi Airways jetliner was scheduled to ferry
scores of Western women and children out of Iraq and occupied
Kuwait today, Iraqi government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi said.
   It was not immediately clear how many would be on the first
flight, but officials say 237 people already have been assembled in
the Iraqi capital and have exit visas.
   Civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who is visiting Baghdad, will
accompany the evacuees on the trip, said al-Hadithi.
   Some 3,000 American women and children have been promised
permission to leave Iraq.
   ``The Iraqis insist on stringing this out and putting all of
these innocent people through this cruel ordeal,'' said State
Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. She said the Iraqis have
been adding layers of red tape to the departure process.
   Ms. Tutwiler also said the State Department is keeping track of
possible war crimes by Iraq.
   ``We are, of course, very concerned about Iraq's violations of
international law, including the taking of hostages and the use of
civilians as a shield against military action,'' she said.
   She added it was ``normal policy'' for the U.S. government to
maintain files on possible violations of the laws of war.
   Bush spoke to Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and French President Francois Mitterrand in a

   Prince Charles was recovering today
after a three-hour operation to repair a slow-healing break in his
upper right arm, a hospital spokesman said.
   There were no complications and the prince's condition was
``excellent,'' said Nigel Clifton, general manager of the Queen's
Medical Center in Nottingham.
   Surgeons installed a titanium plate to permanently hold the
broken bone in place, and the grafted small pieces of bone from the
prince's hip to stimulate healing of the fracture.
   The prince, who is first in line of succession to the throne,
broke the arm in two places when he fell during a polo match two
months ago. One fracture was healing naturally, but the other
required surgery.
   Princess Diana was at the hospital during her husband's
operation. He is expected to be up and walking within two days, but
may be hospitalized for as long as 10 days, Clifton said.

   U.S.-Vietnamese teams have finished
their longest joint search ever for the remains of missing American
servicemen, the official Vietnam News Agency said Saturday.
   The search Aug. 6-Aug. 31 involved more teams and specialists
than ever before, said the report, monitored in Bangkok. U.S.
forensic experts examined 70 sets of remains that the Vietnamese
said they previously found on their own searches.
   The Vietnamese agency did not say what the outcome was. Any
remains suspected to be those of Americans missing from the Vietnam
War are flown to U.S. military laboratories.
   The U.S. experts are from the Joint Casualty Resolution Center
and the Army Central Identification Laboratory, both Hawaii-based
agencies that try to account for America's wartime missing.
   The Pentagon lists 2,300 Americans missing from the war that
ended in Communist victories in 1975 in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
About 70 percent are missing in Vietnam.
   The latest joint search was the 11th since the first one in
September-October 1988.
   The United States and Vietnam still do not have diplomatic
relations, but on Friday they held their second round of talks
seeking an end to the war in Cambodia between guerrillas and the
Vietnamese-installed government.

   NASA today delayed Columbia's
astronomy mission until late next week to replace an electronic
part used for a telescope inside the shuttle, grounded first by
fuel leaks and now cargo problems.
   Columbia had been scheduled to lift off today with seven
astronauts and the $150 million Astro observatory. The flight was
called off Thursday night when the space agency discovered the
fault.
   Workers entered the shuttle's cargo bay Friday to examine an
electronic box at the base of Astro's X-ray telescope. Engineers
later concluded a quick fix wouldn't be enough, saying a component
in the unit or the entire unit will have to be replaced. That ruled
out a launch attempt any earlier than Thursday or Friday.
   NASA had hoped to launch Columbia on Wednesday if the component
could be fixed easily. Mission managers did not set a launch date
at a meeting today, but were expected to make a decision sometime
this weekend.
   ``Any time we get close and don't go, like a kid going to the
carnival, we're frustrated and we're anxious to get going,'' said
William Lenoir, head of NASA's space flight program. ``But we're
not going until we're ready. I think we're getting awfully close to
ready.''
   The last shuttle flight was in April, when Discovery carried the
flawed Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. Delays have brought the
longest gap between missions since flights resumed after the 1986
Challenger accident.
   Columbia's first launch attempt on May 30 was scrubbed because
of leaking hydrogen. A similar problem was found with Atlantis a
month later, and its classified Pentagon flight was delayed from
July to November.
   A beleaguered National Aeronautics and Space Administration has
spent the summer also contending with Hubble's defective mirror and
communications problems with the Venus-orbiting Magellan spacecraft.
   NASA technicians worked into the night testing a line driver, a
component of an electronic box that routes electrical power and
data between Columbia and the X-ray telescope.
   Engineers decided they could not restore communications by
installing a new cable, but would try replacing a component that
sends information to the line driver later today. If that doesn't
work, then the whole box will be replaced.
   The launch also had been threatened by a problem with a middeck
instrument that measures acceleration and vibration, launch
director Bob Sieck said. The instrument failed to activate properly
during the countdown and was replaced today.
   Columbia's seven-member crew planned to stay at Kennedy Space
Center into the weekend. Four astronauts are astronomers who will
operate Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes during the nine- to
10-day flight, probing some of the hottest objects in the universe.
The X-ray telescope will be managed by ground controllers.
   The latest delay is not expected to affect Astro's observing
schedule, said Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist. Scientists had
to choose new targets after the mission was delayed in 1986 by the
Challenger explosion.
   Columbia has until Sept. 14 to lift off, otherwise it will be
forced to wait until Discovery carries the sun-probing Ulysses
satellite into orbit, Lenoir said.
   NASA must launch Discovery between Oct. 5 and 23 to take
advantage of the alignment of Earth, the sun and Jupiter, whose
gravitational field will slingshot Ulysses back to the sun. The
next opportunity for launch would be in 13 months.
   Discovery's move to NASA's other shuttle launch pad was delayed
until at least Tuesday because of frayed electrical connections,
NASA said today. The shuttle was supposed to have been rolled out
Sunday.
   NASA is confident Columbia will not leak excessively during
fueling this time, Lenoir said. It now appears Atlantis has the
same type of leaks as Columbia, which means it is a ``common
problem'' more likely caused by contamination than a faulty design,
he said.
   Columbia's new plumbing is from a different batch than the one
that was removed and the one that leaked on Atlantis, and fared
much better in acceptance tests, said shuttle director Robert
Crippen.
   NASA will rely more on visual evidence of hydrogen leaks during
fueling for future flights and use different criteria for sensors.

<HEAD>Saddam Hussein: Butcher in the West, Savior in Arab World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   To the West, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is
the ``Butcher of Baghdad,'' the man who drops poison gas bombs on
his own people, ruthlessly eliminates rivals _ or invades his
neighbors.
   President Bush has questioned his sanity, and compared him to
Adolf Hitler.
   But many in the Arab world regard him as a hero for standing up
to the United States. In Iraq, crowds motivated both by fear and
real admiration hail him as the savior of Arab nationalism.
   Whether he's portrayed as monster or messiah, nobody fascinates
the world today like Saddam.
   In the United States, Saddam in less than a month has gone from
being just another faraway despot to representing the embodiment of
evil.
   Gas stations have put up targets with Saddam's face as the bulls
eyes. T-shirts portray his face on spiders and read
``Iraqnophobia,'' a reference to a recent horror film. Tabloids
such as the New York Daily News run headlines reading ``Butcher's
Bargain.''
   A recent Newsweek poll found that 43 percent would support
Saddam's assassination.
   Those who have met Saddam are much in demand in the debate over
whether he is a madman or fiend. ABC-TV broadcast tape of a
pre-invasion interview with Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer in which
Saddam was asked to confirm stories he had gunned down a disloyal
aide. He denied it. Members of Congress spoke of Saddam wearing a
gun in past meetings.
   Peyman Pejman, a writer for the Bismark (N.D.) Tribune who met
Saddam in 1988, said the man ``has scary eyes.'' He reminded
readers that ``the line between madness and genius is a thin one.''
   Students of Saddam have found ample evidence to prove he is
crazed, evil or both. A decade ago he presided over a firing squad
that executed 20 officials for disloyalty. In 1982 he arrested an
aide who questioned Iraq's invasion of Iran, and when the man's
wife pleaded for his release, Saddam reportedly returned the body
in a black bag, chopped into pieces.
   In 1981 he republished a pamphlet written by a favorite uncle
titled ``Three Whom God Should Not Have Created: Persians, Jews and
Flies.''
   His most vicious act may have been his 1988 poison gas attack on
Kurdish villages that left thousands dead.
   ``Psychologically, it is useful to have this incarnation of
evil'' when a nation goes on a war footing against an adversary,
said Dr. Jerrold M. Post, a George Washington University professor
of psychiatry who has studied the psyche of Saddam and other world
leaders.
   Yet this is a man who in his own country is referred to as
``father-leader,'' who is lionized in poems and nursery rhymes and
whose portrait is hung in homes and on street corners everywhere.
   His personality cult is based partly on fear and intimidation,
but his bold confrontation with the West has touched a chord of
sympathy with millions in the Arab world. ``He wants to stand up to
the bullies, rightly or wrongly,'' said Hussein Hammani, Jordan's
ambassador to the United States. ``He wants the Arabs to have a
sense of pride.''
   Saddam's televised meeting with Western ``guests'' being held
hostage in Iraq, which Bush dismissed as ``manipulative and
cynical,'' may be getting better reviews in the Middle East, said
Stephen Hess, an expert in politics and the media with Brookings
Institute, a Washington think tank.
   ``I think he's playing to the rest of the Arab world, to people
with longstanding grievances against Western democracies,'' Hess
said last week.
   Saddam's also veered closely to the messianic, as when he
referred to the invasion of Kuwait by saying a ``newborn child was
born of a legitimate father and an immaculate mother. Greetings to
the makers of the second of August, whose efforts God has blessed.''
   It's such megalomania and savage use of power that have drawn
comparisons to Hitler.
   Post, the George Washington University professor, said Saddam
shares several psychological traits with Hitler, including
paranoia, extreme self-absorption and lack of a conscience in the
pursuit of power. ``His grandiose face masks underlying insecurity.
While Hussein is not psychotic, he has a strong paranoid
orientation,'' Post said.
   Saddam may even crave the bad publicity he is getting in the
West, Post said. ``He needs the limelight, to be seen as one of the
most important actors in this moment in history.''
   But Post and others warned that the historical analogy to
Hitler, who possessed far greater powers to destroy the
international order, is flawed.
   Time magazine writer Strobe Talbott, in an article titled ``The
Dangers of Demonization,'' writes that while comparisons to Hitler
are far from preposterous, ``there is nonetheless something
pernicious about the analogy.''
   He said there is a danger many readers and listeners ``will, at
least subliminally, take the point to its invidious extreme, Saddam
equals Hitler, ergo Arabs equal Nazis.''
   James Abourezk, a prominent Arab-American and former senator
from South Dakota, shared such concerns.
   ``These kinds of overdrawn comparisons really damage the
interests of Arab-Americans and our relations with all the Arab
nations,'' he said.

depot that housed the canisters for more than 20 years.
   Balloons flew from some of the vehicles and ``The End'' was

   In a surprise superpower bid to resolve the Persian Gulf crisis,
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet,
Bush administration sources said today.
   Iraq, meanwhile, prepared today to fly out sick Americans and
some Western women and children held for more than a month.
   The White House declined to immediately confirm the
Bush-Gorbachev meeting. National security adviser Brent Scowcroft
said ``I just don't have anything more to say at this time'' but
said an announcement was scheduled for later.
   Also today, U.N. secretary-general Javier Perez de Cuellar held
a second day of talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in
Amman, Jordan. Senior Jordanian officials said the two discussed
the possible deployment of Arab troops as a buffer between U.S. and
Iraqi forces.
   The sources also said Moscow might mediate the withdrawals of
the U.S.-led multinational force from Saudi Arabia and the Iraqi
army from Kuwait.
   No details were disclosed, but one official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said an announcement was possible today.
   Details were also in short supply regarding plans for the
Bush-Gorbachev meeting. Sources said arrangements for the session
were sketched out last week during White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu's visit to Moscow, and the meeting will probably be
Helsinki, Finland.
   Despite the diplomatic moves, Iraq said Friday it was sending
more foreign men to strategic installations to deter a U.S. attack.
They will replace the women and children moved to Baghdad for their
impending release.
   ``We're relocating the foreign men all over the country at
airports, air bases, military bases, industrial plants,
communications centers, power centers and oil refineries _ wherever
Iraq considers it has a vital installation, one exposed to the
American threat in Saudi Arabia,'' said Iraqi government spokesman
Naji al-Hadithi.
   About 21,000 Westerners _ including 3,000 Americans and 4,500
Britons _ have been prevented from leaving Iraq and Kuwait.
   An Iraqi Airways jetliner was scheduled to ferry scores of
Western women and children out of Iraq and occupied Kuwait today,
al-Hadithi said. It was not immediately clear how many would be on
the first flight.
   The government spokesman said a Boeing 747 was expected to take
off from Baghdad at 6 p.m. (10 a.m. EDT). It will stop first in
Amman, the Jordanian capital, and then fly on to London, Paris and
finally Washington, he said.
   American civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, who is visiting
Baghdad, will accompany the evacuees on the trip, said al-Hadithi.
   Jackson flew to Kuwait this morning to pick up ``four or five''
seriously ill Americans and take them back to Baghdad, said
al-Hadithi. Officials say 237 people already have been assembled in
the Iraqi capital and have exit visas.
   Al-Hadithi did not say whether the ailing Americans were men or
women or elaborate on their condition. The Americans apparently
have been in hiding in Kuwait and al-Hadithi said Jackson appealed
for their release on humanitarian grounds.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry said a plane chartered by the Japanese
government left for this morning Jordan to pick up Japanese women
and children allowed to leave. A Foreign Ministry official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said a total of 80 Japanese,
including 68 women and children and 12 dependents of Japanese
Embassy personnel in Iraq, are to be flown to Japan.
   The West Germany Foreign Ministry said a commercial airliner
flew from Frankfurt to Iraq today to pick up German women and
children held. About 1,000 West Germans are among the stranded
Westerners.
   In Kuwait, U.S. Embassy diplomats resisting Iraqi orders to
close the mission said water was running low, food was spoiling and
they were sleeping outdoors to escape the heat, according to
today's New York Times. Power, and therefore air-conditioning, was
cut off at many of the city's embassies.
   Four days after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Iraq annexed its
oil-rich neighbor. Later, Iraq ordered the 60 Kuwait embassies
moved to Baghdad.
   Iraqis were also reported suffering hardships because of the
U.N.-imposed economic sanctions which are being backed up by U.S.
and other foreign warships patrolling the Persian Gulf region.
   Iraq has issued coupon books to prepare for rationing, which
began today, said sources in Baghdad speaking on condition of
anonymity. They said food distribution centers have been set up.
   The coupons entitle each Iraqi to a monthly allocation of 13
pounds of flour, 3.3 pounds of rice, 2.2 pounds of sugar, 3.5
ounces of tea, 1.1 pounds of oil, 17 ounces of detergent and one
bar of soap, the sources said.
   Children under one year of age receive three cans of powdered
milk each month, but older children receive none. Fresh fruit and
vegetables from summer crops remained plentiful, the sources said.
   A week ago, the United Nations authorized the growing armada in
the gulf region to enforce the embargo, which has shut down Iraq's
oil exports _ the country's main source of foreign exchange _ and
prevented most imports.
   Last year, Iraq spent $2.9 billion to buy about 75 percent of
its food from the United States, Canada, Australia, Turkey, Sri
Lanka and elsewhere.
   Long lines have formed at bakeries in Baghdad, and at food shops
in smaller towns, the sources said in telephone interviews. Flour,
rice, dried beans, grain and powdered milk had disappeared from
shops and meat vanished days ago.
   Pharmacy shelves were empty of medicines, and hospital officials
spoke of dwindling supplies of antibiotics and anesthetics, the
sources said.
   Iraq has a two- to four-month stock of staple food, according to
U.S. government and trade estimates. Some experts speculate that
Iraq could stretch its stocks to withstand a six-month siege.
   On Tuesday Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein promised to free women
and children, but the releases had been held up by Iraq's
requirement of an exit visa and other demands. Nineteen Italians _
16 women and three children _ managed to get out of Iraq and arrive
safely in Jordan on Friday.
   In other developments:
   _In Moscow, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday
blamed Saddam for the ``very dangerous'' situation in the gulf but
said his nation still favors a diplomatic soution.
   _Arab foreign ministers on Friday ended a two-day emergency
session in Cairo, Egypt, with a new condemnation of Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait and a call for Iraq to immediately release foreign
hostages.

   Landslides and flooding killed at

in Manila and surrounding provinces in eight days, officials said.
   In Pampanga province north of Manila, police said 274 houses
were swept away by flash floods near the U.S. Clark Air Force Base.
There were no immediate reports of casualties.
   On Aug. 24, floods killed 13 people in the Manila area and

   The Office of Civil Defense said initial reports Saturday
indicated seven people died during a landslide north of Manila. It
said another person drowned in nearby Bulacan province.
   A 3-year-old girl drowned in the Manila suburb of Valenzuela and
four others were reported missing, Mayor Santiago de Guzman said.
   The Office of Civil Defense said about 4,200 people were forced
to flee their homes in suburban Quezon City and Kalookan.
   The U.S. military-run Far East Network said about eight inches
of rain fell in some sections north of Manila during a 15-hour
period Saturday.

   War-weary refugees are scrambling to leave
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, but George Karam was hurrying back Saturday
to reopen the Show Biz Pizza Place and Sharalynn Health Club.
   ``Business,'' explained Karam, a Lebanese who has spent 23 years
in Kuwait. ``I've got a big investment, and they need me there.''
   He smiled at the prospects.
   Karam was among the growing tide of people going the other way.
   At first, it was just a trickle of Palestinians who supported
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Now, thousands each day are
crossing from Jordan into Iraq en route to Kuwait, which Iraq
invaded Aug. 2 and later annexed.
   Those crossing have mixed motives. Many Jordanian Palestinians,
most of whom lived in Kuwait before the invasion, see a chance to
earn an honest dinar. Others have schemes to try. Some have gone
out of political zeal.
   Following the invasion, Saddam decreed that anyone not returning
to resume activities in Kuwait within two weeks would lose
residence status. The deadline has passed, but people are still
going back.
   ``I think there is stability coming to Kuwait but much to be
done,'' said Karam, who owns nine businesses. He estimates that a
quarter of his 800 employees have fled.
   A wealthy man, Karam flew back on an Iraqi Airways flight.
   Many more are headed back by road.
   ``All my friends will go back,'' said Mohammed Yusuf, a
19-year-old student whose T-shirt declared, ``I am proud to be a
Palestinian.'' He was born in Kuwait, but was in Jordan when Iraq
attacked.
   ``Now Palestinians will have freedom,'' he said, confident that
Saddam would expand rights to Palestinians and other Arab
foreigners that were denied them under the deposed Kuwaiti royal
family.
   ``We love Saddam, we love him,'' repeated Yusuf's friend, Samir
Mohammed, another Kuwaiti Palestinian who was about to head home.
   ``We is wonderful, he is our tiger of the Arab world,'' Mohammed
said. Searching his English vocabulary for more words, he added:
``A gentleman.''
   Some 300,000 Palestinians lived in Kuwait before the invasion.
They made up the largest expatriate community.
   As the well-heeled refugees arrived in Amman, they found rooms
in luxury hotels vacated by Jordanian Palestinians going back.
   ``They are all going, shopkeepers, engineers, people with
businesses, everyone,'' said a Jordanian hotel executive who asked
not to be named.
   A reporter at the Jordanian-Iraqi border last week saw two
Palestinian student refugees alone in a hired van. Five days later,
he saw the van returning to Kuwait, jammed with adults, children
and luggage.
   The returning refugees, who often surpass 2,000 a day at the
Ruweishid crossing, are joined by others coming across other land
borders and on flights from Arab capitals.
   Refugees report that although Iraqi troops are closing in on
foreigners in Kuwait, and some items are running short because of
the international blockade on Iraq, the reduced population is
living relatively normally.
   Karam said his motives were not political. He thought of Kuwait
without pizza and exuded the air of a businessman who knows how to
sniff the wind.
   ``I am going back,'' he said, rushing off to catch his plane.

   For the first time since 1951, police
didn't stop members of the Ku Klux Klan from donning hoods this
morning for a march in this northeastern Georgia city.
   About 100 Klan members and white supremacists marched through
Gainesville today, carrying a banner reading ``Stop Colored
Immigration.'' They held a 40- minute rally at the Hall County
Courthouse before dispersing.
   About 40 marchers wore Klan robes and open-face hoods and 15
wore hoods covering their faces. About three dozen spectators
gathered at the perimeter of the cordoned-off march route. Only
marchers, police and reporters were allowed at the march route.
   The turnout was lower than the 250 expected. About 340 helmeted
law enforcement officers flanked the marchers, who were expected to
go to Lawrenceville, about 30 miles away, for another rally this
afternoon.
   The state's 1951 anti-mask law, which prevents concealment of
identity in public places, was ruled unconstitutional in May by a
state court judge in Gwinnett County. Georgia Attorney General
Michael Bowers told law enforcement officers not to enforce the law
while an appeal is pending.
   The misdemeanor charge carries a maximum $1,000 fine or a year
in prison.
   One of the first to put on a full hood this morning was Lewis
Baxter of Sylvania, ``grand klaliff'' of the Confederate White
Knights of the KKK.
   Baxter, who identified himself, said he was wearing his hood not
to protect his identity but rather ``to celebrate a victory to us.
They said we'd never wear them again and we're wearing them.''
   Other masked Klansmen declined to identify themselves, but did
not don their robes and hoods until they approached the march area.
   Downtown Gainesville was deserted except for several hundred law
enforcement officers. Most shops were closed and shop doors carried
orange ribbons signifying the town's protest against the Klan.
   Only police and reporters were allowed access to the
supremacists' march and rally; spectators and counterdemonstrators
were restricted to a designated space near the courthouse, said
Gainesville Police Capt. Marion Darricott.
   This afternoon, supremacists were expected at the Lawrenceville
courthouse where Klansman Shade Miller Jr. was arrested last year.
   Gwinnett State Court Judge Howard Cook, in declaring the law
unconstitutional, agreed with Miller's contention that the law
violated Klansmen's First Amendment right to anonymous free speech
and expression.
   Klan members also planned an annual cross-burning ceremony
tonight in Stone Mountain on the property of longtime Klan leader
James Venable.

   Forty-eight people have been killed and 250
injured by Typhoon Abe, the sixth major storm to batter China's
southeastern coast this summer, the official Xinhua News Agency
reported Saturday.
   The typhoon, which hit coastal Zhejiang province Friday morning,
left 41,000 people homeless and 45 missing, Xinhua and the China
Daily said.
   The provincial meteorological station said Abe was the most
severe typhoon to hit Zhejiang in 34 years, Xinhua said.
   More than 10 million people in Zhejiang have been affected by
the storm, with 665,000 stranded by flooding, it said.
   The typhoon has destroyed 283 miles of dikes, 897 dams, 209
miles of canals and 589 bridges, the report said.
   Abe was headed north toward Jiangsu province and Shanghai, where
it was expected to cause substantial damage, the China Daily
reported.
   China's southern coast already has been hit by five typhoons
this summer.

   A jury awarded more than $240,000 to the
family and lover of a man whose ashes were mistakenly scattered at
the entrance to the San Francisco Bay.
   A Superior Court jury found the Neptune Society, a crematorium,
was negligent in handling the remains of Robert Saari and had
breached its contract to return the ashes for a private service to
Saari's lover, Patrick Hinrichsen.
   Saari died in January 1985 of AIDS. The Neptune Society, which
specializes in scattering ashes at sea, was hired only to cremate
Saari.
   The three-week trial ended Thursday. The $242,503 award gave
Hinrichsen $175,000; Saari's mother, Tyme, $62,500; and Saari's
sister, Peggy, $5,000. The panel also awarded each plaintiff $1 in
punitive damages against the society.
   Richard Jongordon, former owner of the Neptune Society, was the
target of the lawsuit.
   ``It was one of those things,'' he said. ``One of the employees
made a mistake. It was totally unintentional.''
   The current owners, who took over Neptune a year ago, weren't
named in the lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   President Bush has decided to make available
more high-tech weapons for Israel and is considering forgiveness of
Egypt's $6.7 billion military debt to the United States, a senior
administration official says.
   Additional weapons for Israel would bolster that country's
defense against Iraq and offset recent decisions to sell Saudi
Arabia more tanks and jet fighters, officials said Friday.
   Wiping out the $6.7 billion debt owed by Egypt for past arms
sales would reward an Arab country lined up with the United States
in sending troops to Saudi Arabia and taking part in the
international trade embargo against Iraq.
   Forgiving the debt would require congressional approval.
   The initiative for more aid to Israel came from Israeli
officials, according to congressional, government and private
sources who all spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Israel has kept a low profile in the Persian Gulf crisis, but
has warned that it would consider an Iraqi movement of troops into
Jordan a hostile act.
   Some Israeli officials broached the idea of taking over U.S.
military equipment and ammunition in Europe that would eventually
be withdrawn because of expected agreements with the Soviet Union.
   The New York Times said in today's editions that officials were
considering providing Israel with F-16 and F-15 fighters, Apache
anti-tank helicopters, Patriot ground-to-air missiles that could be
used against attacking missiles, and M-60 tanks.
   The Times said the Israeli deal could amount to $1 billion worth
of arms.
   Asked what would be made available and when, an administration
official told The Associated Press, ``No decisions have been
made.'' At a news briefing today in Kennebunkport, Maine, national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft said the United States and Israel
were in routine annual consultations about military aid.
   Addressing the report on Egypt's foreign debt, Scowcroft said,
``We are and have been worried some time about Egyptian debt.''
   ``We are reviewing the situation for all the countries that are
heavily impacted by the gulf situation,'' he said.
   The Egyptian military debt, consisting of $4.5 billion in
principal with the remainder interest, was amassed from 1979 to
1985. In recent years, Egypt has been getting annual grants of
about $1.3 billion from the United States for military purposes. It
also has been receiving economic grants approaching $1 billion
annually.
   Current law requires that any country more than a year in
arrears on debt repayment be barred from further foreign aid.
Federal officials had scheduled meetings on how to avoid that
penalty when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   Officials considered three options: outright cancellation of the
debt, a ``buyback'' in which Egypt would repay some fraction of the
face amount and a freeze on interest payments.
   The preferred option given to the president, officials said, was
forgiveness, an option opposed by the Treasury Department on the
grounds that it was too large a sum to wipe off the books in a time
of U.S. budget stringency.
   The Washington Post said in today's editions Bush had decided on
forgiveness, but the senior official said such a course was ``one
of the options being reviewed by the administration.''

<HEAD>Chiles Tries To Hold Off Nelson; GOP Governor Readies for General
Election</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Political Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles came
out of retirement with a high-minded pledge to revolutionize modern
politics.
   But before Chiles can lead his envisioned reforms, he must hold
off U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson's bid to defeat him in Tuesday's
Democratic gubernatorial primary.
   Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, meanwhile, no longer looks like
the easy mark Democrats hoped for in the November general elections
that both parties say could be a watershed for Florida.
   The first-term governor has ignored four primary foes in a
television blitz that portrays him as a family man who fights taxes
and drugs, protects the environment and works hard to get convicts
into the electric chair.
   Recent polls have indicated Martinez is running ahead of Nelson
and, for the first time, within range of Chiles, whose negative
ratings with voters have risen during the heated campaign.
   ``I've gotten what I need out of the Democratic primary,'' said
Martinez campaign manager J.M. ``Mac'' Stipanovich.
   Chiles and Nelson both have promised to work for the winner of
the Democratic primary, which Nelson describes as ``a family
fight.'' Democrats are worried, though, because a bitter 1986
primary was widely blamed for enabling Martinez to defeat the
battered nominee, Steve Pajcic, and become the state's second
Republican governor since Reconstruction.
   The GOP believes it can re-elect Martinez, win the state Senate
for its first legislative majority this century, and thus control
redistricting that could bring Florida four new U.S. House seats in
1992.
   Martinez is expected to easily win the GOP nomination against
maverick state Sen. Marlene Woodson Howard, who maintains Martinez
is unelectable because of his support for a services tax that was
later repealed and his anti-abortion activism. Three political
unknowns also are on the GOP ballot.
   Chiles, 60, jumped into the governor's race in April, saying he
wanted to stop the domination of big money in politics. His
rejection of special-interest influence could spread around the
nation, says Chiles, taking inspiration from the Eastern Europe
revolts.
   ``Come join us in the plaza!'' he implores.
   Nelson, who has raised almost $6 million to the nearly $2
million Chiles has raised with a self-imposed $100 limit on
individual contributions, would be beholden to special interests as
governor, Chiles says.
   ``What we're saying is the way you campaign says a lot about the
way you would govern,'' he says.
   Chiles' running mate is former three-term U.S. Rep. Kenneth
``Buddy'' MacKay, who also has a stellar ethics reputation. MacKay,
who narrowly lost the 1988 election for Chiles' Senate seat to
Republican Connie Mack, persuaded Chiles to join him in a last
hurrah.
   ``If the voters don't respond to the way we're doing this
campaign, we're history,'' says MacKay, 57.
   Nelson, 47, is a six-term congressman who was well on his way to
the Democratic nomination before Chiles entered the race. Two other
Democrats dropped out when Chiles dropped in.
   Nelson has tried to portray Chiles' image for pristine ethics as
exaggerated and says Chiles has a double standard.
   Chiles' health, particularly his mid-campaign return to use of
the anti-depressant Prozac, also has been raised, and Nelson has
implied that Chiles is a quitter for retiring from the Senate when
his term ended in January 1989.
   But recent polls indicated Chiles was pushing his lead over
Nelson well past double digits and that Nelson was suffering a
backlash. Nelson's running mate, state House Speaker Tom Gustafson,
was widely criticized and finally apologized for suggesting Chiles
could be suicidal.
   Chiles has chastised Nelson for negative politics. He also has
charged that Nelson, with his slogan ``a new generation of
leadership,'' is trying to pit young against old. Polls have
indicated Chiles' strongest support comes from voters over 60.
   At the Century Village condominium community in Broward County's
Deerfield Beach, veteran Democratic activist Charlie Goldstein
expressed resentment at the Nelson campaign.
   ``Everybody over age 55 has health problems. That's not an
issue,'' said Goldstein, organizing a Chiles rally for Sunday. His
condo community has nearly 11,000 registered voters, and the
predominantly Democratic retirees in such South Florida communities
are known for higher turnouts than the general population.
   In a televised debate, Nelson criticized Chiles for retiring at
a time when he chaired the Senate Budget Committee and had 18
years' seniority that put him in good position to help Florida and
reduce the federal deficit.
   ``It was Casey at the bat, full count, and (Chiles) turned on
his heel, he walked away and walked into the dressing room and he
turned in his uniform,'' Nelson said.
   Chiles attributed his retirement decision to ``burnout,'' and
frustration with the lack of commitment by both the president and
Democratic leadership to reducing the deficit.
   He says he decided to run for governor because the job offers a
hands-on chance to make changes.
   The two moderate Democrats have expressed few differences on the
issues. Each time Nelson has raised an apparent distinction, Chiles
has responded by embracing the same position. Chiles now says he is
against government interference on abortion, would ban assault
rifles and supports a seven-day handgun waiting period.
   Nelson says Chiles has been evasive and is running a ``trust-me
campaign'' that will face much heavier fire in the general election
campaign.
   MacKay says the primary has been more negative than Chiles has
faced in the past, but that it may have been good practice.
Martinez has raised more than $7 million and Stipanovich is known
for killer political instincts.
   ``Some of the attacks we anticipated, but not in the primary
campaign,'' MacKay said. ``It may turn out that it's better that
way. We've been able to develop a quick-response mechanism.''

   An Iraqi Airways jet scheduled to fly at
least four ailing Americans and 146 U.S. and British women and
children out of Iraq and Kuwait was delayed in Baghdad today,
sources in the Iraqi capital said.
   A second jetliner also sat on the Baghdad runway, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported. No reason was provided for the delay.
   The news agency, quoting an unidentified source at the Iraqi
Ministry of Culture and Information, said British and U.S.
authorities had agreed to a request from Iraq for the aircraft
transporting the women and children to use landing facilities and
refuel.
   But Iraqi officials were awaiting a response to a similar
request made to French officials for the use of landing facilities
in Paris, the news agency said. In Paris, the French Foreign
Ministry said the plane was to stop at Orly Airport to drop off 20
French women and children before proceeding to London. The second
Iraqi Airways jetliner was to carry 72 women and children to Amman,
Jordan _ 66 Japanese, two Australians and four others of
undetermined nationality, said government spokesman Naji al-Hadithi.
   The foreigners were among an estimated 21,000 Westerners and
Japanese who were trapped when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2,
causing world economic and military pressure against the government
of President Saddam Hussein.
   Both planes had been scheduled to take off from Baghdad today at
about 6 p.m. (10 a.m. EDT), al-Hadithi said. He had said at a news
conference that the plane carrying the British and U.S. nationals
would fly to London, then Washington.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said today that seven British and three American women received
exit visas from Iraqi officials today but that their husbands, who
were accompanying them, were all detained.
   Officials have said 237 women and children have been assembled
at a hotel in Baghdad since Tuesday, when Saddam said they would be
allowed to leave. Red tape slowed the process, with the government
requiring exit visas.
   American civil rights leader Jesse Jackson was aboard a plane
that flew to Kuwait this morning to pick up ``four or five''
seriously ill Americans and bring them back to Baghdad, the
government spokesman said.
   He did not say whether the ailing Americans were men or women,
or elaborate on their condition.
   He said Baghdad had received word from the United States
``through diplomatic channels'' that some ailing Americans were
among the foreigners stranded in Kuwait after Iraq's invasion.
   The Americans apparently were hiding to avoid internment by the
Iraqis who have used many foreigners as human shields to fend off
any attack by U.S.-led multinational forces based in Saudi Arabia.
   Al-Hadithi said when Jackson met with Saddam earlier this week
he appealed for their release.
   A West German commercial airliner left from Frankfurt for Iraq
today to pick up German women and children, the West German Foreign
Ministry said. The ministry said the flight was arranged to pick up
an estimated 100 West German women and children in Iraq but would
likely include other Westerners as well.
   ``We expect the plane to be full,'' said the spokesman. The
plane has 259 seats. About 450 West Germans are in Iraq and 260 are
believed held in Kuwait, the ministry said.
   Japan's Foreign Ministry said a plane chartered by the Japanese
government left this morning for Jordan to pick up Japanese women
and children allowed to leave. A Foreign Ministry official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said a total of 80 Japanese,
including 68 women and children and 12 dependents of Japanese
Embassy personnel in Iraq, are to be flown to Japan.
   In Madrid, the Spanish Foreign Ministry said 52 Spaniards were
to be evacuated aboard a Lufthansa plane.
   Al-Hadithi, who is director-general of the Ministry of
Information, said Britain and the United States have granted the
Iraqi Airways jetliner permission to land in London and Washington.
   ``But we are surprised that we still have not received a
positive response from the French government,'' al-Hadithi said.
   He said the same plane is to bring back Iraqis stranded in
Europe and the United States since the invasion, but again provided
no numbers.
   Britain's Foreign Office said it would have no objection to
Iraqis returning to Baghdad aboard flights airlifting people out.
   In France, 26 Iraqi military personnel and civilians connected
with the defense program remain in the cities where they were
undergoing training programs before the invasion.
   The French have not linked their departure to Westerners in Iraq.
   Meanwhile, 24 Italian women and children arrived in Rome today,
a day after most of them left Iraq. Twelve of the women and all
seven children had been in Kuwait City during the invasion, and
traveled to Baghdad a week ago.
   Another Italian woman from Baghdad and four from the Iraqi city
of Mosul joined the group in Amman, Jordan on Friday.
   ``Coming home is a beautiful feeling, even if the Iraqis were
always very courteous to us,'' said Regina Garofalo, a singer who
had been performing at a Kuwait hotel at the time of the invasion.

<HEAD>Teachers Disenchanted With Reform, Nationwide Poll Finds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's teachers are disenchanted with
reform, are dissatisfied with their work conditions and feel left
out of decision making, according to a survey released Saturday.
   Three out of five _ 61 percent _ said teacher morale at their
schools was just ``fair'' or ``poor,'' according to a nationwide
poll of 21,389 elementary and secondary school teachers conducted
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.
   A startling 96 percent said lack of funds was forcing them to
spend an average of $250 of their own money on supplies to support
classroom activities.
   Just 18 percent gave school reform efforts a grade of ``A'' or
``B,'' compared with 31 percent in a 1987 Carnegie survey. And 28
percent graded the reform movement ``D'' or ``F,'' compared with 19
percent in the previous survey.
   The findings ``should cause the nation grave concern,'' said
foundation President Ernest L. Boyer in a forward to the report,
``The Condition of Teaching, 1990.''
   ``The signals are clear that teachers think reform has more to
do with politics than with classrooms and student performance,''
Boyer said in an interview.
   ``Sadly, after nearly a decade of intense school reform, we find
the majority of veteran teachers reporting `no change' or `decline'
since 1983 on many of the conditions critical to a healthy climate
for teaching and learning in their schools,'' the report concluded.
   
   Four out of 10 teachers said they'd choose another profession if
they had it to do over again.
   ``The conclusion is clear: Improved working conditions are
essential if we hope to attract and hold outstanding teachers,''
Boyer said.
   On the other hand, half the nation's teachers say they are more
enthusiastic about their profession than when they started their
careers. And 55 percent said they subordinate all other aspects of
their life to their jobs. The survey was conducted by mail last
January and February, based on a random sample of public school
teachers in each state. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 1
percentage point.
   Among results:
   _ Seventy-one percent said they are ``not at all'' or ``only
slightly'' involved in student promotion and retention decisions _
the same percentage as three years ago.
   _ Just 1 percent said they have a major role in evaluating peers.
   _ Sixty-four percent said they have less than an hour a day of
scheduled time to prepare for classes.
   _ Seventy percent said counseling services are ``fair'' or
``poor.''
   _ Thirty-eight percent complain that classes are too big.
   The survey also found that 20 percent of elementary teachers
said neglected students are a ``serious'' problem in their school,
up from 9 percent three years ago.
   A secondary school teacher from Illinois wrote: ``Currently
seven of my students' parents ... are getting divorces. One
stepfather raped his daughter; two girls told me of sexual abuse
when they were young; one boy killed himself; two boys related to
me of suicide attempts; one girl ran away to Florida for two months
and now has a child; one got pregnant, had an abortion and now has
a 2-week-old child.''
   Still, state data revealed a few bright spots.
   Thirty-seven percent of teachers nationwide said their salaries
were ``good'' or ``excellent.'' But in Connecticut, where average
pay ranked second nationally at $41,412 in 1989-90, 82 percent
considered salaries good or excellent.
   Thirty-nine percent of teachers nationwide consider morale
``good'' or ``excellent,'' but 53 percent of teachers in Maine felt
that way.
   Nearly six out of 10 teachers in Kansas and Wyoming said support
services are good or excellent.
   Seventy percent of Vermont teachers said they are deeply
involved in choosing texts and other instructional materials.

   A federal prosecutor's secret computer
files, including sealed indictments and pending FBI investigations,
mistakenly were sold for $45 to a businessman who thought he was
buying only a broken computer system.
   Charles Hayes said government agents finished a nine-hour search
of his office early today for the computer equipment with the
secret files. They seized nine computer terminals, a computer
memory device and other assorted equipment in their search, he said.
   Hayes, who sells government surplus equipment, said he would
have handed over the computers anyway and was trying to get back
the items he had already resold.
   He called the sale of the equipment Aug. 3 ``the worst case of
bureaucracy I have ever seen. If it is this loose, I wonder what
else is missing up there.''
   ``What it amounts to is I am being punished for the inefficiency
in (the prosecutor's office),'' said Hayes.
   He said about nine people, including federal marshals and staff
from the U.S. attorney's office in Lexington, took part in the
search on his business Friday night. They had a search warran,
Hayes said.
   In a lawsuit filed Thursday, the U.S. Justice Department
demanded that Hayes, of rural Pulaski County, return the computers
immediately. The government also wants him to tell who bought the
equipment or had access to the data.
   Court documents said a technician failed to erase the memory of
the computer at the U.S. attorney's office in Lexington before the
government sold the system in July to Hayes.
   According to the lawsuit, the computer's memory and backup
storage tapes contain sensitive details about FBI informants,
federally protected witnesses, sealed indictments and personal
information about employees in U.S. Attorney Louis DeFalaise'
office.
   ``The U.S. attorney's office used some or all of the computer
equipment ... to prepare and store virtually every document and
record generated by both the civil and criminal divisions of the
office from 1983 to 1989,'' the lawsuit said.
   If made public, the files could ruin criminal investigations and
cause ``great harm and irreparable injury'' to the work of U.S.
prosecutors. ``The seriousness of the injury to the United States
of America cannot be understated,'' the lawsuit said.
   Within hours of the lawsuit's filing, U.S. District Judge Eugene
Siler Jr. ordered Hayes immediately to return the computer system
to the government and not examine, copy or distribute the data. A
hearing was set for Sept. 4.
   Hayes said the government told him the computers' memory had
been wiped before he obtained it. He said a customer bought a
computer storage device and several tapes presumably containing the
secret files.
   He said he has asked the customer to return the items.
   In Washington, Justice Department spokesman Michael W. Robinson
declined to comment on what effect, if any, release of the tapes
would have on past and pending litigation or informants.
   ``We can't be sure what is on there until we see it,'' Robinson
said.
   In Lexington, DeFalaise declined to comment, citing the pending
lawsuit. In a deposition, DeFalaise's former secretary said she
stored all final drafts of criminal and civil matters in the
computer's memory.
   A technician for Harris-Lanier Corp., the computer's
manufacturer, thought he erased the computer's memory in January,
the lawsuit said.
   In July, Hayes bid $45 for the system: 13 computer terminals,
two central memory units, two cartridge module drives and nine
printers. The system had 93 megabytes of memory and could store
hundreds of thousands of pages.
   After Hayes picked up the equipment on Aug. 3, the Harris-Lanier
technician told government officials he didn't erase the memory
after all. A magnetic probe used to scramble the data was too weak.
   Because the computers were broken, technicians couldn't purge
the memory through normal computer commands. ``The information
almost certainly remained stored within some parts of the computer
equipment,'' the lawsuit said.
   Hayes said FBI agents who visited his business Aug. 17 treated
him rudely and departed after a bitter exchange when they attempted
to examine his office without a search warrant.
   The Justice Department contends in the lawsuit that Hayes hasn't
been forthcoming. The officials also contend that Hayes, with the
help of his computer technician Jim Freeman, can retrieve the data.
   Hayes denied he has looked at the sensitive information.

   Police found the body of a missing
10-year-old girl in the crushed remains of a car five hours after
the auto was demolished in a collision and towed away.
   The accident occurred Thursday night on I-395 just south of
Washington, D.C., when the car was hit from behind as it was
stopped for a highway construction project. Police said the other
vehicle was traveling 65 mph.
   Police were unaware that the child, Veronica Covarrubias,
remained in the first car until after her parents, two sisters and
a brother were taken to Fairfax Hospital.
   Virginia state troopers returned to the scene at 4:30 a.m.
Friday, five hours after the collision, believing the girl may have
been thrown from the car. They then went to a towing company's
storage lot and found her in the rear hatchback area of the
crumpled car.
   ``The metal had just rolled up'' over the child, trooper James
L. Brinkley Jr. said. ``The rear trunk came up in the front seat.
That's how bad it was.''
   Authorities said an autopsy will be performed, but they added
that the child appeared to have died on impact.
   Mohammed E. Islam, 20, of Stafford, Va., was charged with
reckless driving after the crash.
   Jose Covarrubias, 32, his wife, Roxana, 37, were listed in
serious condition at Fairfax Hospital. Paul Covarrubias, 1, was
listed in stable condition. A 13-year-old daughter, Roxana, was
listed in fair condition. A 3-year-old girl, Danitca, was treated
and released.

   An 11-year-old boy was arrested Saturday in
connection with the microwave death of a dog owned by a Humane
Society worker.
   A white Maltese owned by Marlene Stephens was put to sleep after
it was found in a microwave oven Thursday. The dog was cooked for
an undetermined amount of time, said a Canton police officer who
asked not to be identified.
   Police declined to release the name of the youth and would say
only that his case will go before Stark County Juvenile Court.
   Someone broke into Ms. Stephens home Thursday and placed her
dog, Jo Jo, into the microwave, police said. The oven was still
running when she returned home from work that afternoon, officials
said.
   She called police before rushing the dog to a veterinarian. The
injuries were so severe, however, that the dog was put to sleep
Friday.
   In addition, her other dog, a dachshund named Satin, suffered
minor wounds in the belly when someone had tried to stab the animal
with a screwdriver, police said.
   Ms. Stephens said she believed the dog killing was ``a form of
recreation.''
   ``He did it for kicks,'' she said. ``He took my little dog and
put her in the microwave.
   ``I work all day with dogs and I love them dearly,'' she said.
``Then I come home and give my dogs twice as much love. These dogs
are my kids.''
   Ms. Stephens said the intruder broke into her home by tearing a
screen off a window.

<HEAD>Lewis Telethon Moves from Las Vegas to Hollywood</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL FLEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 17 years in Las Vegas, the Jerry Lewis
Labor Day Telethon will try to shake its lounge lizard image this
weekend, moving to Hollywood in search of trendier acts, lower
costs and a fresher look.
   The 21{-hour long Muscular Dystrophy Association fund-raiser
celebrates its 25th anniversary from the Star Search Theater on
Sunset Boulevard, where Ed McMahon presents his glitzy talent show.
   The nationwide broadcast begins at 9 p.m. EDT Sunday and ends
6:30 p.m. Monday.
   Among the scheduled entertainers are such youth-oriented acts as
rapper M.C. Hammer, Tony! Toni! Tone!, En Vogue, cast members from
``The Young Riders,'' Fred Savage of the ``The Wonder Years'' and
Bob Saget of ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   Behind the scenes, Lewis no longer acts as one of the producers
and will serve only as a host. Producer George Schlatter (``Real
People'' and ``Rowan and Martin's Laugh-in'') takes sole producer
credit.
   The MDA announced in January that Schlatter would be the
executive producer for the show. Lewis later said the telethon had
used five other producers over the years and he welcomed
Schlatter's involvement.
   ``I just couldn't work that hard and keep going,'' said Lewis,
64. ``Come air time, I would be so exhausted, it was hard to
continue at that pace.''
   But the show hasn't entirely abandoned tradition. Bill Cosby
will appear in a remote feed from Las Vegas, and the program still
will have such telethon fixtures as Lewis, McMahon, Norm Crosby and
Top 40 radio countdown king Casey Kasem.
   And, Schlatter says, Lewis will probably once again sing
``You'll Never Walk Alone'' to close the show.
   ``I'm not looking to redo the whole thing,'' Schlatter said
Tuesday. ``It's been too successful for too long. We're celebrating
the accomplishments of the last 25 years and kind of renewing the
dedication to moving it into the '90s.''
   Over the years, the telethon has raised more than half a billion
dollars to fight neuromuscular diseases that kill and cripple
thousand of people annually, most of them young.
   The Las Vegas shows were always successful in terms of pledges,
with last year's tally a record $42.2 million. But even as pledges
went up, viewership went down. From 1985 to 1989, the show drew
increasingly smaller audiences.
   In addition, it was becoming increasingly more expensive to
produce the telethon from there.
   The accommodations had to be converted into television studios,
and entertainers and crew members were flown in, usually from Los
Angeles, said telethon spokeswman Jim Brown.
   ``We don't know how much we'll save this year because we're
right in the middle of it all,'' he said. ``But we hope to save
something.''
   In moving to Los Angeles, the telethon can use a working
television studio and can tap a ready supply of talent, much of it
the stars of choice for younger viewers.
   Among the newer groups on the bill, Tony! Toni! Tone! has been
hot on the charts this summer with its single ``Feels Good'' and En
Vogue's single ``Hold On,'' has gone platinum. M.C. Hammer's album
``Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em'' is credited with selling over 5
million copies, more than any other rap album.
   One drawback might be a shortage of walk-in fans: In Las Vegas,
telethon coordinators could round up willing audience members at
any hour because the gambling casinos are open round-the-clock.
Finding charity-minded fans at 3 a.m. on Hollywood's Sunset
Boulevard could prove more problematic.
   The Jerry Lewis telethon began in New York City in 1966,
emanating from a single TV station and raising $1 million. It moved
to Las Vegas in 1973 and raised $13.5 million that year.
   The telethon now is carried by 200 stations and is viewed
annually by an estimated 100 million people.
   While Jerry Lewis does his shtick in Los Angeles this weekend,
Jerry Lee Lewis is twisting and shouting in a rock benefit for
muscular dystrophy in San Bernardino. The three days of rock music
of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, which began Saturday, features
performers such as Lewis, the Commodores, Fats Domino and Eddie
Rabbitt.

   Saudi Arabia's defense minister
said Saturday that foreign troops in the kingdom would not be
allowed to initiate attacks unless Iraqi forces cross into Saudi
territory.
   ``The kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not a theater for any action
that is not defensive for Saudi Arabia,'' Prince Sultan bin Abdul
Aziz told a news conference.
   His comments appeared to rule out the use of Saudi Arabia as a
base for possible efforts to strike inside Iraq or drive out
occupation forces in Kuwait.
   U.S. Army Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander of American
forces here, said Friday there would be no war unless Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein made the ``awfully stupid mistake'' of
attacking Saudi Arabia.
   U.S. officials say more than 100,000 troops, including those
aboard dozens of ships in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, are in the
region or on the way. The deployment could go as high as 250,000.
   The U.S.-led multinational force is facing more than 200,000
Iraqi troops poised along the Saudi borders with Iraq and Kuwait.
Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2 in a dispute over oil and land, then
annexed the small emirate.
   Prince Sultan, who met with reporters after delivering a speech
to Saudi military cadets, said ``any peaceful solution would have
in mind the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait.''
   He was vague when asked how an Iraqi withdrawal could be
achieved without military action. Be he said Saudi Arabia ``will
not initiate hostilities against other Arab state.''
   ``War should always be a last resort,'' said Prince Sultan, who
spoke through an interpreter.
   The prince, a younger brother of King Fahd, condemned Iraq for
placing foreigners at strategic sites to serve as human shields
against attack.

   The government isn't doing a good enough job
informing the public about its automobile tire testing program, an
auto safety group says. So in a report for release Sunday, it drew
up its own list of the longest-lasting tires.
   Based on the government results, the Center for Auto Safety
ranked the most popular tires manufactured by 26 radial tire
companies ``to help consumers buy the safest and most long-lasting
tire for their money.''
   ``Without readily available ratings, consumers remain at the
mercy of tire companies,'' the center's Clarence Ditlow said.
   Ditlow said the government should be disseminating the results
of its extensive tire testing program. Right now, the government
will give anyone who asks its test data on nearly 1,800 passenger
car tires, free of charge.
   But Ditlow, in a letter to Jerry R. Curry, administrator of the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, said a list of the
best and worst tires would be more useful.
   The government responded that it doesn't want to pick winners
and losers.
   ``We're not going to make judgments,'' NHTSA spokesman Kent
Milton said. ``Some people want a lot of traction and some want
more mileage. It's not in our purview to say which is the best
vehicle, the best tire or the best headlight.''
   The government rates tires according to three grades: tread
wear, traction and temperature characteristics. For tread wear, the
center's list shows the General AmeriClassic and Vogue CBR VI to be
the best, with ratings of 400, which would carry them 80,000 miles
under test conditions. Each rating point is worth about 200 miles.
   General also manufacturers one of the lowest-ranked tires in the
center's list: the XP2000 ZG, which tied with Yokohama's 60 and
70-A001R@A0089 for a ``rock-bottom rating'' of 50, good for 10,000
miles.
   ``Inconsistencies in durability and quality between and among
companies are rampant,'' the center report said. It said Sears
produces tires such as the Road Handler that is rated for 62,000
miles, while it also makes tires with names that evoke safety, such
as the Guardsman@Weatherman, which is rated at 140, good for 28,000
miles.
   The center recommends that consumers get the price of tires they
want to buy and divide it into the mileage rating to compare costs
of various tires per mile. Manufacturers are required to mold the
ratings onto the tires.
   The grades for traction are either A, B or C, with A being the
best and C being the minimum to meet government standards.
Temperature grades of A, B or C measure the tire's ability to run
at lower temperatures, which help reduce the possibility of
blowouts or tread separation.
   A government pamphlet says even a C-graded tire is ``not
unsafe'' and warns that under-inflation or overloading will
overheat and damage any tire and greatly increase the chance of a
blowout.
   The pamphlet also says personal driving style, characteristics
of the car and how and where it is driven, as well as tire
maintenance, can influence tire life more than brand name or the
price paid.
   The tire industry accused the center of oversimplifying the
government test results. Thomas E. Cole, chairman of the Tire
Industry Safety Council, said numerical tread wear grades do not
guarantee tire mileage.
   ``The best way to maximize tire performance and highway safety
this holiday and throughout the year is through proper inflation,
proper maintenance and frequent inspection for road damage,'' Cole
said.
   Regardless of the tire grade, Cole said, the actual life of any
tire depends primarily on road surface quality, driving habits,
tire inflation, wheel alignment and rotation.
   He recommended that the buyers combine the federal testing
information with personal driving considerations as well as dealer
recommendations.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and President
Bush will meet in Helsinki on Sept. 9, Soviet television announced
on Saturday.
   The Soviet announcement came as President Bush said that he and
Gorbachev would meet to discuss the Middle East crisis and other
international matters.
   ``We have many matters to discuss,'' Bush told reporters in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   The Soviet evening television show Vremya read the following
announcement, which was also transmitted by the state Tass news
agency:
   ``It was officially announced here that the president of the
U.S.S.R. Mikhail Gorbachev and the president of the U.S.A., George
Bush, will meet on Sunday, Sept. 9, in Helsinki for a discussion of
international and bilateral questions.''
   It would be the eighth summit between Gorbachev and his American
counterpart. Five were with Ronald Reagan.
   U.S. officials had said earlier Saturday that Bush proposed a
summit, and that it likely would be a one-day affair, essentially a
meeting over lunch.
   Bush said he was reluctant to say that the meeting was about the
crisis in the Middle East, but acknowledged it would be among the
issues discussed.
   He said he and Gorbachev would touch upon ``a wide array'' of
issues, including the conventional forces treaty yet to be
concluded to cover troop reductions in Europe. He said the one-day
session would be a free-flowing discussion between he and
Gorbachev, but dampened speculation that Moscow would play a role
in mediating the crisis with Iraq.
   ``I don't see a mediating role at all'' for Gorbachev, Bush
said. ``There are a lot of mediators out there.''
   Arrangements for the Bush-Gorbachev summit were sketched out
during White House Chief of Staff John Sununu's visit this week to
Moscow, administration sources said. Bush and Gorbachev last held a
summit May 30 to June 3 in the United States. They had met
previously on the Mediterranean island of Malta in December 1989.
   At a Moscow news conference Friday night, Gorbachev did not
mention the possibility of a meeting with Bush. But he said he is
in ``constant contact'' with many world leaders, including Bush.

   The one-day meeting Sept. 9 in Helsinki,
Finland, between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev will be the 22nd superpower summit.
   Bush said the meeting would be held to discuss the Middle East
crisis and other matters, including arms control.
   Summits began in World War II as the Allies debated the shape of
the postwar world.
   Here is a list of past summits.
   Tehran, Iran, Nov. 28-Dec. 1, 1943
   The Big Three - President Roosevelt, British Prime Minister
Winston Churchill and Josef Stalin of the Soviet Union - discuss
the war against Germany. Stalin presses for a second front to
relieve Soviet armies.
   Yalta, Soviet Union, Feb. 4-11, 1945
   Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin discuss the postwar world,
granting Stalin influence over the nations that ultimately form the
Soviet bloc.
   Potsdam, Germany, July 17-Aug. 2, 1945
   President Truman and Clement Atlee, Churchill's successor, face
Stalin. Truman tells Stalin the United States has a powerful new
weapon, but doesn't say what it is.
   Geneva, July 18-23, 1955
   President Eisenhower meets with Soviet Premier Nikolai Bulganin
and the leaders of England and France to discuss occupied Germany.
   Camp David, Md., Sept. 25-27, 1959
   Nikita Khrushchev, as Soviet premier, meets Eisenhower during a
two-week visit to the United States. They agree to reopen talks on
the status of Berlin and issue a communique calling disarmament an
important issue.
   Paris, May 16, 1960
   The meeting collapses on opening day when Khrushchev demands an
apology for the American U-2 spy plane shot down over the Soviet
Union. He withdraws an invitation for Eisenhower to visit the
Soviet Union.
   Vienna, Austria, June 3-4, 1961
   President Kennedy and Khrushchev meet, but talks on a nuclear
test ban and arms control produce no agreement. They issue a joint
communique affirming their support for a neutral Laos and
willingness to maintain contact.
   Glassboro, N.J., June 23-25, 1967
   President Johnson and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin meet but
resolve no differences over the Vietnam War, the Arab-Israeli war
and nuclear arms.
   Moscow, May 22-24, 1972
   President Nixon and Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev meet, the
first time a U.S. president has visited Moscow. They sign
agreements on health, the environment and space and scientific
cooperation.
   Washington, June 18-25, 1973
   Brezhnev and Nixon sign a pledge to seek agreement to end the
nuclear arms race in 1974 and a pledge to cooperate in avoiding
confrontations.
   Moscow, June 27-July 3, 1974
   Nixon and Brezhnev sign a number of documents on nuclear
weapons, including one limiting underground nuclear explosions.
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger says impeachment proceedings
hamper Nixon.
   Vladivostok, U.S.S.R., Nov. 23-24, 1974
   President Ford and Brezhnev reach tentative agreement to limit
the number of strategic offensive nuclear weapons and delivery
vehicles, including multiple-warhead missiles.
   Helsinki, Finland, July 30-Aug. 2, 1975

European security. They report progress on strategic arms issues.
   Vienna, June 15-18, 1979
   President Carter and Brezhnev conclude seven years of strategic
arms limitation talks with the signing of the SALT II treaty.
   Geneva, Nov. 19-21, 1985
   President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev spend far
more time in private sessions than planned but do not reach any
breakthrough on major issues. Reagan calls it a ''fresh start'' in
relations.
   Reykjavik, Iceland, Oct. 11-12, 1986
   Reagan and Gorbachev hold detailed talks on eliminating nuclear
weapons but disagree over the U.S. strategic defense initiative,
known as Star Wars.
   Washington, Dec. 8-10, 1987
   Reagan and Gorbachev sign a treaty to eliminate
intermediate-range nuclear forces, but disagreement over Star Wars
blocks progress on a strategic arms reduction treaty. Moscow, May
29-June 2, 1988
   Reagan and Gorbachev exchange the ratified texts of the INF
treaty, discuss strategic and conventional arms and stroll in Red
Square. Reagan softens his criticism of Soviet human rights abuses;
Gorbachev complains of missed opportunities.

   The Bush administration, unable thus
far to prod Iraq's Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait with a massive
military buildup and international diplomacy, is bracing for a
drawn-out and costly war of nerves.
   A month after President Bush ordered the biggest deployment of
troops since the Vietnam War, the administration is refocusing its
strategy for the long haul. In the short term, Bush's high-profile
weekend meeting with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is certain to
emphasize Saddam's isolation.
   Administration officials say they still believe that the waiting
game with Iraq can be won, but concede many questions remain about
Saddam's ability to weather the economic embargo against his nation.
   Although a prolonged desert standoff always was deemed possible,
administration officials say that until now most attention was
focused on short-range goals _ and not the consequences of a
$1-billion a month indefinite U.S. military presence in the Persian
Gulf region.
   With the memory of last winter's successful Panama blitz still
fresh, detailed long-term planning had been only sketchy, said
officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
   Still, ``no one was under the impression that it was a quick-fix
situation,'' said one official here with the president. ``Everyone
knew it could take weeks _ or months.''
   With the president himself now voicing open pessimism about
prospects for a diplomatic solution, the administration is
improvising a long-range policy.
   For the first time, the administration is considering proposing
to Congress a delay of Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction targets
because of the cost of the Persian Gulf operation, according to
sources.
   The targets, pointing the way to a balanced budget by fiscal
year 1993, could not have been met anyway.
   They call for reducing the federal deficit to $64 billion in the
fiscal year that begins in just a month _ a herculean task that
would have called for some $100 billion in spending cuts and-or tax
increases even before the Persian Gulf operation.
   Congress returns from its summer recess this week, and Bush
returns from his 25-day working Maine vacation. As budget talks
resume, and Congress begins to take a look at the crisis, the
long-range costs and consequences of the U.S. military buildup will
take center stage.
   The issue of how long American troops can remain in Saudi Arabia
is surely one that will be in the forefront.
   How long a U.S. presence can be maintained without draining the
Treasury and losing American support is an open question.
``Americans are an impatient crowd,'' said Rep. Newt Gingrich,
R-Ga., House minority whip.
   The U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf
``will go on as long as it takes to have these United Nations
sanctions fully implemented,'' Bush said.
   One senior administration official said that it is now clear
that ``Saddam Hussein is feeling the impact of the embargo.'' The
official said the Iraqi leader is desperately contacting other
nations seeking to barter oil for commodities.
   Building on lessons learned in Panama, the administration acted
decisively and quickly in sending forces to the Middle East and in
rallying international condemnation of Iraq in the days after the
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
   But there is little in common between the Panama invasion and
the Middle East buildup.
   The operation all but assured that Iraq would not invade Saudi
Arabia, but thus far has done little toward dislodging Saddam from
Kuwait. And the Iraqi leader raised the ante by refusing to allow
thousands of foreigners, including about 3,000 Americans, to leave
the country.
   The administration never really plotted a long range strategy
for dealing with Saddam, officials conceded.
   There couldn't be a worse time for a drawn-out military
expenditure, with a budget crisis brewing even before the crisis
flared.
   Prospects of an administration shift of thinking on Gramm-Rudman
targets was alluded to by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``These are all matters to be considered by the negotiators when
they meet (this week),'' he said. ``We will have a proposal to put
on the table. We trust the Democrats will. And discussion of
Gramm-Rudman targets would all be a part of those deliberations.''
   The president himself has been vague on long-range strategy.
   ``It's difficult at this juncture to know fully what the impact
will be. Clearly, it will have some budget implication,'' Bush said
in his Thursday news conference.
   The United States is prepared to wage a long economic war of
attrition against Iraq _ mindful that this strategy may impart a
human toll on Iraqis. ``There's nothing that's painless,'' Bush
asserted.
   By the same token, Iraqis are used to long periods of
deprivation, having just emerged from an eight-year war with Iran.
   At the same time, administration officials say Saddam's invasion
has changed some of the dynamics of the Middle East for good _ and
the dynamics will be permanently altered even if Saddam is not
toppled.
   ``I'd like to think that out of this dreary performance by
Saddam Hussein there could be now an opportunity for peace all
through the Middle East,'' Bush said.
   The only goal the United States has enunciated so far _ whether
long range or short range _ is the complete withdrawal of Iraqi
troops from Kuwait, restoration of the former leadership and
freedom of movement for foreigners now stuck in either country.
   And, while the administration is now down playing the prospects
of a diplomatic initiative, ``perhaps one will hit pay dirt,'' says
Bush.

<HEAD>Judge Orders City To Allow Anti-Logging Demonstration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered a northern
California city to let anti-logging groups hold a Labor Day march
and rally at a lumber mill.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel issued a temporary
restraining order after the city of Fortuna in Humboldt County took
no action on the groups' request for a permit to hold activities
outside Pacific Lumber Co.
   Weigel said if the demonstrators' lawsuit proceeded, they were
likely to show that the denial of a permit violated freedom of
expression.
   The march follows a summer of protests by activists against
increased cutting of so-called ``old-growth'' trees _ trees from
long-established stands _in Humboldt and Mendocino counties.
Between 750 and 1,000 people plan to march through Fortuna to the
lumber mill and lay wreaths to lament the ``death of the forest.''
   Fortuna is about 260 miles north of San Francisco.
   Just two weeks before the scheduled march, Fortuna passed an
ordinance increasing from 14 to 20 days the application time
required for parade permits.
   Weigel said the change was suspiciously timed and appeared to be
aimed at blocking the march, an assertion denied by a lawyer for
the city.
   The judge urged the American Civil Liberties Union, which
represented the demonstrators, and the city to reach an agreement
that would allow the march. When that did not happen by midday
Friday, he signed an order prohibiting the city from blocking a
march of up to two hours.

   President Bush said today that he
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet next Sunday in
Helsinki, Finland, to discuss the Middle East crisis and other
international issues.
   ``We have many matters to discuss,'' Bush told reporters.
   A simultaneous announcement of the one-day summit was made on
the Soviet television show Vremya and transmitted by the state Tass
news agency. It said the two leaders would discuss ``international
and bilateral questions.''
   In a brief session with reporters before an afternoon of golf,
Bush said he was reluctant to say that the meeting was about the
crisis in the Middle East, but acknowledged it would be on the
agenda.
   He said he and Gorbachev would touch upon ``a wide array'' of
issues, including the conventional forces treaty yet to be
concluded to cover troop reductions in Europe. ``It will be
free-flowing discussions,'' he said.
   Bush dampened speculation that Moscow would play a role in
mediating the crisis with Iraq.
   ``I don't see a mediating role at all'' for Gorbachev, Bush
said. ``There are a lot of mediators out there.''
   Senior Jordanian officials in Amman had reported that Moscow
might assume such a role.
   Bush said that he had not discussed the Persian Gulf crisis
directly with Gorbachev by phone because he has known for some time
that he would be seeing him.
   Bush asserted several times that it would not be a one-issue
summit.
   ``I can't say the Middle East has nothing to do with this
meeting. But it's not the whole thing,'' Bush said.
   The summit will be his third meeting as president with
Gorbachev; Gorbachev also met five times with President Reagan.
   Bush said his wife Barbara would travel to Helsinki, and that
Raisa Gorbachev would accompany the Soviet president.
   Bush said he does not see any more flexibility on the part of
Iraq's Saddam Hussein than before.
   ``I don't want to mislead the American people'' by suggesting
there is ``some breakthrough at hand,'' he said.
   The president accused Saddam of a ``tawdry'' and ``outrageous''
performance in posing with hostages in a series of television
messages to the west. Bush said it was ``despicable''
   On another subject, Bush said it was his ``gut instinct'' to
recommend to Congress that it forgive some of Egypt's $7 billion
military debt to the United States as a gesture of appreciation for
its support in the current crisis.
   Just two hours before Bush's announcement, national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft had refused to confirm that a summit would
take place. But he told reporters that there was a lot for Bush and
Gorbachev to talk about, from the Persian Gulf crisis to
developments in Cambodia and Afghanistan.
   In the midst of the Scowcroft briefing, White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater took a call from the secretary of state and then
scribbled a note to the national security adviser. They whispered
briefly together and then, turning back to reporters, Scowcroft
said, ``Stay tuned, we'll have an announcement at 1 o'clock.''
   Laughing, he added, ``I knew I shouldn't have done this''
briefing.
   Asked about the timing of the announcement, Scowcroft said there
were certain issues of ``diplomatic niceties'' and ``an agreement
on when these things are announced.''
   On other gulf-related issues, Scowcroft said:
   _Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and a handful of diplomatic
personnel would remain in the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait as long as
possible to assist the 2,500 Americans there. ``Where would they
(citizens) turn? They are there to try to help Americans,'' he said.
   _Saddam is playing a game with hostages in which ``the ground
rules change daily and sometimes hourly. We demand that he release
all innocent civilians detained against their will.''
   _U.N. Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar would remain in Iraq
until Sunday.
   ``What he went there for was to impress upon Saddam Hussein that
the world community has spoken. Unless Saddam Hussein is prepared
to meet that framework, it's difficult to see how there would be
successful negotiations,'' said Scowcroft, speaking of the
U.N.-imposed sanctions against Iraq.
   _There is no difference between an ``Arab solution'' and an
international solution to the crisis. But he also said ``the Arabs
are and ought to be out in front on this.'' He said he did not want
to single out the Arabs from ``the world community as expressed
through the United Nations, which is taking a position against
flagrant aggression.''
   Arrangements for the Bush-Gorbachev summit were sketched out
during White House Chief of Staff John Sununu's visit this week to
Moscow, administration sources said. Bush and Gorbachev last held a
summit May 30 to June 3 in the United States. They had met
previously on the Mediterranean island of Malta in December 1989.
   At a Moscow news conference Friday night, Gorbachev did not
mention the possibility of a meeting with Bush. But he said he is
in ``constant contact'' with many world leaders, including Bush.
   Bush is spending the long holiday weekend with his wife Barbara
and assorted children and grandchildren at their seaside vacation
home on Walker's Point.
   The tension level among Bush and his aides appears to have
eased, as administration officials said the situation in the
Persian Gulf was ``settling'' a bit following the crisis mode that
was sparked by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Bush appeared relaxed and jovial when he hosted a picnic Friday
for the press corps covering his trip.
   Earlier in the day, he was on the telephone talking to King Fahd
of Saudi Arabia, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Great Britain
and French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Fitzwater said the president outlined his plans to raise money
from wealthy nations to support the U.S. military buildup in the
Persian Gulf and to provide economic aid for poor countries
suffering as a result of the trade embargo against Iraq.
   The foreign leaders, each of whom has had repeated contact with
Bush since the Gulf crisis began, agreed ``to stay in close
communication'' on the matter, Fitzwater said.
   Officials with Bush in Kennebunkport also said Friday that there
was some pressure building from allies and members of Congress to
move militarily against Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein. The
sources spoke on condition of anonymity, and did not further
identify those supporting a military move.
   The officials said the pressure by no means constituted a
consensus. They indicated that mainstream opinion within the
administration and the Congress and among U.S. allies was to stay
with the current policy of using economic sanctions to force Saddam
to roll back.
   Bush returns to Washington on Monday evening.

   Boris N. Yeltsin, populist president of the
Russian republic, sharply criticized Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev Saturday over plans to free the sinking economy of
government control and let the market rule.
   He rejected Gorbachev's call of a day earlier for the merger of
two vastly different blueprints for economic reform.
   Yeltsin told a news conference at the Russian federation
headquarters: ``We won't go along with merging the two programs.
That's completely unrealistic. That would be a brake not only on
economic reform but also on the entire renewal of society and the
political life of our country.
   ``The president is showing indecisiveness in this regard,'' he
said.
   One plan, prepared by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, calls for the
government to retain control over prices initially and for
long-term denationalization of industries and property.
   The other, drafted by a governmental advisory board, outlines
more rapid lifting of price controls and a quick switch to private
control of most industries and private individual property.
   Yeltsin said the plan by Stanislav Shatalin, a member of
Gorbachev's Presidential Council advisory group, should be
presented to the legislatures of the nation and the 15 republics.
   The clash was the latest in a rocky, three-year relationship
during which Gorbachev kicked Yeltsin out of the Soviet leadership
for blasting reform plans as too timid, and Yeltsin staged a
political comeback based on widespread popular support.
   A new poll, taken in July by the national Center for
Socio-Political Studies, indicated that Yeltsin's popularity rose
from 29.0 percent to 47.1 percent since last year and Gorbachev's
fell from 36.2 percent to 18.4 percent. Ryzhkov's rating fell from
20.6 percent to 3.1 percent.
   A report on the poll by the independent news agency Interfax
gave no margin of error, nor did it say how the survey was
conducted.
   The latest dispute was a setback to the efforts of a 12-member
committee of leading economists assembled jointly by Gorbachev and
Yeltsin in July to develop a common policy on economic reform.
   Gorbachev told a news conference Friday night that the two plans
must be merged into a ``document that reflects general agreement.''
   Yeltsin believes the plans are so fundamentally different they
cannot be combined. He said Shatalin's plan would be presented to
the Russian Supreme Soviet at the session opening Monday. It
closely follows a plan endorsed by Yeltsin earlier.
   The national Supreme Soviet convenes Sept. 10.
   ``People are tired of waiting,'' Yeltsin said, seated amid a sea
of microphones in front of the blue-and-red Russian republic flag.
``People are at the limit of . . . patience. Therefore, they
expressed such very sharp dissatisfaction with the actions of the
union government, which for five years did practically nothing in
economic reform.''
   He said he got a sense of public reaction during a
just-completed 22-day tour of 27 cities in the Russian republic.
   If the Russian federation goes its own way on economic reform,
it would immensely complicate Gorbachev's efforts to unify a
country already fractured by ethnic conflicts. Yeltsin's government
already has moved to seize control of banking in Russia from Soviet
authorities, and he said it could start implementing an overall
economic reform program on Oct. 1.
   Yeltsin believes Ryzhkov's plan would maintain the central
government's command system, which he blames for aggravating the
country's economic problems. ``If implemented, it would lead to a
collapse,'' he said.
   He said any plan adopted is doomed to fail unless Ryzhkov and
the ministers under him resign. Gorbachev himself is at risk,
Yeltsin said.
   ``Every day the union government takes away from confirming this
plan, it diminishes Gorbachev's term,'' He said.
   After government advisory bodies met for two days to discuss
economic reform, Gorbachev said Friday that the government will try
to stabilize the faltering economy within six months by cutting off
Soviets' ability to accumulate ``hot money.'' That is the term for
income derived from black marketeering and other activities.
   Ryzhkov's initial program, presented in May and rejected by the
national legislature a month later, called for drastic price
increases on bread and other items whose prices have remained
basically unchanged for decades.
   The program fueled panic buying that left ill-stocked store
shelves even barer.

<TEXT>
   After three weeks of staying well
south of Saudi Arabia's northern border with Iraq, U.S. troops are
moving north to bolster defensive lines and vastly improve their
offensive capabilities.
   The movements of several U.S. units last week were described as
a logical extension of the American military buildup as more and
more U.S. firepower flows into the region.
   U.S. officials said the movements were noteworthy because they
signaled that U.S. commanders are comfortable putting troops a good
distance from major supply points.
   ``If nothing else, it shows we believe we are now capable of
sustaining a significant force in forward positions,'' said a
senior Air Force officer in Dhahran. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Marine Maj. Gen. John Hopkins said Saturday the Marine force in
Saudi Arabia _ now about 15,000 strong _ would be tripled within
two weeks.
   ``We are right where we should be. If the flow continues, we'll
be at full combat power in two weeks,'' Hopkins told a visiting
delegation of U.S. senators.
   U.S. officials say more than 100,000 troops, including those
aboard dozens of ships, are in the Persian Gulf region or on the
way.
   Until last week, the United States would have been almost
entirely dependent on air firepower to counter an Iraqi invasion of
Saudi Arabia. Most ground forces were in positions about 200 miles
from the Saudi-Kuwait border.
   ``We needed to have the troops down at the ports and air base,
to provide security for the ships and transports (planes) as they
arrived in country,'' a top aide to a senior U.S. military official
said, also on condition of anonymity.
   As the airlift brought more and more troops and supplies to the
kingdom, U.S military planners began shifting the deployment to the
north, with most units setting up initial staging camps about 100
to 150 miles from the border.
   But last week, Marine and at least two Army units moved even
farther north, in the case of the Marines to within 35 miles of the
Kuwait border.
   The Marines, members of the 7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade,
have taken up positions behind the Saudi forces closest to the
border. From those positions they could defend the north-south
highway that Iraqi tanks could use to reach the richest of Saudi
Arabia's oil fields.
   A bit farther south, the mechanized 24th Infantry Division began
to establish a forward base for its heavy ground forces, which
include M-1 tanks and Bradley armored infantry carriers. The M-1s'
arrival last week gave American commanders their first shipment of
the United States' heaviest ground power.
   ``They give us a cushion, make it more comfortable for us to
move up because we know the troops have heavy support,'' an Army
officer said.
   To the west of those positions, the 101st Airborne Division's
air assault brigade has established its first forward refueling and
rearming base, according to brigade officers.
   Several other potential sites for refueling and rearming camps
have been identified, and more forward camps likely will be
established in the next few weeks, the officers said.
   Additional heavy and light Army infantry are arriving in Saudi
Arabia or are due to arrive within days. Even more heavy equipment
is in the early stages of its sealift, which takes two to four
weeks. Still more is waiting in the United States to be shipped
here.
   Although the forces moving north have offensive capabilities,
U.S. commanders here said it is unlikely the United States would
use Saudi-based forces to initiate combat, if a decision to attack
was made.
   But if hostilities did erupt, regardless of which side initiated
them, U.S. forces now are in positions from which they could engage
Iraqi ground forces far more quickly than they could have a week
ago, they said.
   ``We're not looking to start anything, but we are looking to be
ready when it starts,'' the senior military aide said.

   Volunteering soon will become a
high school graduation requirement for students in the North Kansas
City School District.
   In a pilot program announced last week, the 16,000-student
district will require students to complete 36 hours of community
service outside the classroom as part of a new social studies
class, ``the American citizen.''
   ``It's time to put the `me' generation behind us,''
Superintendent Gene Denisar said Tuesday at a convocation for the
district's 2,000 teachers and administrators.
   He declared the North Kansas City district's 1990-91 school
year, which begins Tuesday, as the Year of Service.
   The ``American citizen'' class will first be offered next
semester as an elective in a high school to be chosen later.
Starting in fall 1992 it will become a required course.
   Denisar said that as far as he knew, no other school district in
the state has such a graduation requirement.
   Denisar also hopes the course may spur community support. The
district has been trying since last spring to pass a capital
improvements package to improve and expand district facilities.

<HEAD>Judicial Report: Police Killed Blacks Without Reason</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official commission issued
a stinging report Saturday saying police fired without reason on a
protest march, killing five blacks and wounding 156. The report
recommended a criminal investigation.
   The report into police conduct at the Sebokeng township March 26
was one of the harshest criticisms of police conduct ever made by
an official inquiry. It said the marchers never threatened the
police, and officers fired without orders.
   The attorney general should investigate policemen who fired
bullets for possible criminal action, said the report, which was
authored by Justice R.J. Goldstone. It gave no indication what
charges might be filed if action is taken.
   Police ``displayed an attitude of unconcern for the lethal
nature of their ammunition . . . This is an attitude which no
police force should tolerate,'' the report said.
   It was released at a time when police are under attack from the
African National Congress, church groups and others for alleged
bias and improper conduct in black factional fighting around
Johannesburg.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok, who supervises police, said
Saturday that the case would be turned over to the attorney general
for investigation. He also said there may be a police investigation.
   The ANC said at least 12 people were killed in the shootings at
the Sebokeng township south of Johannesburg. The march was to
protest local housing conditions, rents and other grievances.
   The report said one officer fired and others joined in when a
mostly peaceful crowd tried to march to a police station.
   ``At most, the behavior of the crowd may have justified the use
of tear gas, and then only after a proper warning to disperse,''
the report said.
   ``There appears to be no credible evidence to suggest that the
behavior of the crowd was such that the policemen could have
reasonably been in fear of their lives or personal safety.
   ``There was a complete lack of discipline in the police line.
This was the direct cause of the shooting into the crowd.''
   A white civilian carrying a pistol joined the police unit and
took part in the incident, the report said.
   But it said no evidence emerged of criminal action on the part
of Capt. Du Plooy, the police commander on the scene, who was
sitting in a vehicle at the time. Such a finding would make it hard
to prosecute other officers involved.
   President F.W. de Klerk ordered the inquiry following public
outrage over the shootings.
   In another development, Peter Mokaba, leader of the South
African Youth Congress, charged Saturday that the government
instigated black factional fighting. He called for disbanding the
white-led police and army and denounced de Klerk despite his
efforts to end apartheid.
   South Africa can have peace only when the white-led government
is removed, he said at a funeral in Tokoza township near
Johannesburg for four people killed in black factional battles.
   Police fired tear gas at protesters who tried to march through
Tokoza after the funeral, and protesters hurled rocks. No injuries
were reported.
   Government and police have rejected ANC charges of police bias
during fighting last month in Johannesburg between Xhosas and other
blacks linked to the ANC, and Zulus tied to the conservative
Inkatha movement.
   At least 518 people have been killed in the fighting, which
began Aug. 12.

<TEXT>
   Edwin Oldfather Reischauer, who served
as U.S. ambassador to Japan during the Kennedy and Johnson
administrations, died Saturday from hepatitis. He was 79.
   Reischauer died at Green Hospital of Scripps Clinic and Research
Foundation, the clinic said.
   Ambssador to Japan from 1961 to 1966, Reischauer wrote several
books on America's relationship with Japan and Asia. Among his
books are ``The Japanese Today: Change and Continuity,'' and
``Japan: The Story of a Nation.''
   Reischauer was born in Tokyo to missionary parents on Oct. 15,
1910. He graduated from Oberlin College in 1931. He received a
doctorate from Harvard University after studying at universities in
France, Japan and China.
   Reischauer first joined the Harvard staff as an instructor in
1938. He returned after World War II as an associate professor,
later a professor of Far Eastern languages. He retired in 1981. He
also was a director of the Harvard-Yenching Institute from 1956 to
1961.
   During World War II, Reischauer served in the Far Eastern
Affairs office in the State Department and the War Department,
specializing in Japanese language training and intelligence.
   As ambassador, Reischauer established contacts with opposition
leaders, intellectuals, the media and students. He urged America to
abandon its ``occupation mentality'' toward Japan as the nation
began its emergence as an industrial power.
   His books included ``East Asia: The Modern Transformation,''
1965; ``Beyond Vietnam, the United States and Asia,'' 1967; ``The
Japanese,'' 1977; and ``My Life between Japan and America,'' 1986.
   For his work to promote better understanding between cultures,
Reischauer was conferred Japan's First Class Order of the Rising
Sun in 1968.
   Reischauer was a resident of Belmont, Mass., and La Jolla.
   He is survived by his wife, Haru, who is related to Japanese
royalty; a son, Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional
Budget Office; and daughters Ann Heinemann and Joan Simon.

<TEXT>
   Here is a transcript of President
Bush's announcement Saturday of a one-day meeting next week with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and of the question-and-answer
session that followed.
   BUSH: We'll have a brief announcement that I'd like to make, and
that is that President Gorbachev and I will meet on Sunday, Sept. 9
in Helsinki to discuss international and bilateral matters. I spoke
with President Koivisto of Finland this morning, and I believe the
Soviets made a similar approach to President Koivisto, to secure
the final arrangements.
   Secretary (of State James A. ) Baker and Foreign Minister
(Eduard A.) Shevardnadze have been working out the details of this
meeting over the last few days, and we got word this morning that
an announcement at this time would be agreeable to the Soviets.
   So, I wanted to get that out, and I'm looking forward very much
to seeing Mr. Gorbachev again. We have many matters to discuss.
   There is no special agenda relating to the Middle East. Nobody's
doing any negotiating or anything of that nature. When President
Gorbachev was here, he and I agreed that it would be useful to have
periodic meetings without casting them in the vein of a summit, and
that's exactly what this meeting is about. And I will be delighted
to see him again, and we have many subjects to discuss.
   Q. Mr. President, this is a little bit sudden. Can you tell us
what you hope to _ I mean, it seems sudden on such short notice.
   What do you hope to accomplish? And also, was this your
initiative or his?
   BUSH: It's not overly sudden. We just haven't been discussing
it. And it's _ I believe in this case I made the suggestion that we
have this meeting, at this time and at this place.

   Q. What do you hope to accomplish?
   BUSH: Well, being sure we're together. As you know, I've been
very pleased with the cooperation we've been getting from the
Soviet Union on a wide array of questions and subjects. And I think
it is important at this juncture that we discuss issues not just of
_ as they relate to Europe and try to update where we stand on
these arms negotiations, but also to discuss the Middle East.
   Q. Mr. President, is this at all motivated by concern that the
Soviets either don't understand or don't agree with US actions in
the Gulf region, specifically the military deployment, that they've
expressed some doubt _
   BUSH: No, I've _ I'm very pleased. As I think I said before
publicly, we seem to be in general agreement on a lot of issues, a
lot of questions that relate to the Middle East. But it is my view
that it's just important that we have good, free-flowing
discussions about this. So it's not a _ it wasn't driven by any
worry that we might be apart, rather that there's a wide array of
questions that could use consultation at this time.
   Q. .... why you haven't talked to President Gorbachev until now
and since ... ?
   BUSH: Because I'd anticipated seeing him.
   Q. Have you talked to him about the summit meeting?
   BUSH: No.
   Q. Mr. President, given the ...
   BUSH: But I've been in direct contact with him about the summit
meeting personally. Yeah, Sandy.
   Q. Mr. President, will you be asking Mr. Gorbachev to pull his
military advisers out of Iraq?
   BUSH: I'm _ we have no agenda, no issues of that nature that
have been _ been _ you know, agreed on to discuss.
   Q. ... concern here though, doesn't that help ...
   BUSH: Well, I'm not sure of the status of those military
advisers right now, Sandy. Yeah.
   Q. Mr. President, given the ...
   Q. ... will be talking about other than the Middle East? Will
you be discussing, for example, START talks, CSCE, or any other
possible meetings with him?
   BUSH: With _ other meetings?
   Q. With Gorbachev?

   Miss America 1990 Debbye Turner says
giving up her crown this week will be bittersweet, but she conceded
she's looking forward to lounging around with no make up on.
   But after a week of relaxing, it will be back to the books to
finish her degree in veterinary medicine.
   Miss Turner, a 24-year-old who competed as Miss Missouri after
losing in years past in her home state of Arkansas, said she has
enjoyed the last 12 months.
   She says Saturday, her last night as Miss America, will be a sad
one.
   ``It is a bittersweet experience. This has been a good year and
you always hate to see it end,'' Miss Turner said. ``I'm sure I'll
be a little weepy about it.''
   Among the highlights were meeting President Bush, Bill Cosby,
Oprah Winfrey and jazz great Lionel Hampton.
   ``I am looking forward to a week to go somewhere and do nothing
but lay out with no makeup,'' she said. ``I get tired. I'm on the
road seven days a week. Living out of a suitcase has its
challenges.''
   She said that after taking a week off she will resume her
studies at the University of Missouri-Columbia Veterinary School,
where she is six months short of her doctor of veterinary medicine
degree.
   Miss Turner said she remains surprised by how much attention she
received as Miss America. Among the stranger incidents drawing
attention were the loss of her luggage in Moscow, Idaho, and a call
she placed to another Turner staying at a New York hotel who was
receiving her messages.

   American cyclist Greg LeMond kept race
officials in suspense Saturday by not checking in for Sunday's
finale of the World Cycling Championships.
   LeMond, the first American to win the Tour de France, was
nowhere to be seen Saturday. His absence sparked rumors that he was
planning to fly in by helicopter at the last moment in order to
lessen the effects of jet lag and media attention.
   Whatever the reason, organizers said, LeMond would be at the
starting line to defend his title in the individual men's
professional road race.
   If LeMond succeeds, he will be the first rider to win both the
Tour de France and the world championship two years running.
   LeMond, who rides for the French professional team ``Z,'' has
won the Tour de France three times _ 1986, 1989 and 1990. He also
won world championships in 1983 and 1989.
   In last month's Zurich Classic, however, he was edged out by
Frenchman Charles Mottet.
   Unlike the Tour de France, a grueling, 2,112-mile race spread
out in stages over three weeks, Sunday's 162-mile championship will
be held on a nine-mile circuit.

   A harmonica player who has been
jailed in the past for impersonating Grateful Dead guitarist Bob
Weir allegedly has been at it again, police say.
   Oakland police are looking for Randall Delpiano to arrest him on
a warrant accusing him of stealing and violating his parole after
serving 15 months on fraud and theft charges, Sgt. Stan Bricker
said Friday.
   Bricker questioned Delpiano two years ago after he was charged
with bilking a woman out of $4,000. He was accused of gaining her
confidence by impersonating Weir. He was paroled in April.
   Bricker said Delpiano told him ``he gets some satisfaction'' out
of pretending to be Weir. Delpiano resembles Weir, who doesn't play
harmonica.
   ``People like him when they think he's Bob Weir,'' Bricker said.
   Grateful Dead publicist Dennis McNally called Delpiano ``a
professional con man who has got an emotional problem.''
   ``Bobby obviously objects to him doing so,'' McNally said. ``I
really hope he runs into sharper Deadheads who recognize him,''
referring to the nomadic group of fans who sometimes follow the
band around the country.
   Bricker identified Delpiano as the man who allegedly has been
impersonating Weir in the community of Discovery Bay in Contra
Costa County.

   Robert Indiana, an artist known for his
block-letter representations of the word ``LOVE,'' was arrested on
a charge of hiring a male prostitute, police said Saturday.
   Deputies also seized nine drawings of naked young men from
Indiana's home on Vinalhaven, an island 16 miles off Maine's coast
that is known as an artists' retreat, officials said.
   ``We did not seize anything claiming it was pornographic,''
District Attorney William Anderson said. ``The only reason we
seized it was for evidence.''
   The prosecutor declined to comment when asked whether two young
Vinalhaven men who told investigators that Indiana paid them for
sex would face charges.
   The two men, one 21 and the other 19, told police they were
posing for Indiana when the sex acts allegedly occurred. The men
claimed they were paid to have sex with Indiana.
   Indiana was released on $300 bail after being arrested on the
misdemeanor charge.
   There is no phone listing for Indiana and attempts to reach him
for comment were unsuccessful.
   Indiana, 61, was born Robert E. Clark but adopted the name of
his home state. His colorful representation of the word ``LOVE'' in
a square with the ``L-O'' on top of the ``V-E,'' the ``O'' tilted
on its side made him famous in the 1960s.
   Indiana is to be arraigned Oct. 3 in Maine District Court.
Anderson said the maximum penalty for the misdemenaor charge is
$1,000 fine and 364 days in jail.

   BUSH: Well, I hadn't. I mean, we've just set these meetings up,
and the way I described it from our side to him was that we'd like
_ that we'd have no agenda, and that it would be free-flowing
discussions. But I know that we'll have discussions of _ as I
mentioned, CFE, and a CFE agreement would lead to the CSCE
meetings. So I think we'll be talking about all of these things,
Sandy. Yes?
   Q. Mr. President, what role would you like to see the Soviets
play in the burden-sharing campaign that the Administration has
started?
   BUSH: Well, I don't know that they have a _ have a role to play
in burden-sharing at all.
   Q. Why?
   BUSH: I _ the Soviet Union is _ have a lot of responsibilities
around the world. If they want to help in the burden-sharing,
that's fine. But I don't go there with a specific burden-sharing
role in mind. It should be disconnected from the mission that
Secretary Baker and Secretary (of Treasury Nicholas) Brady are
undertaking.
   It has _ put it this way. This meeting, in my view, is not about
burden-sharing.
   We may get a better idea of all of this, because I think Jim
Baker will be in Moscow very soon.
   Q. Mr. President, given the Soviet relationship with Iraq, do
you see Moscow playing a mediating role in the crisis in the Gulf?
   BUSH: I don't see a mediating role at all, and I don't think the
Soviets see themselves having a mediating role. There are a lot of
mediators out there trying hard, (U.N.) Secretary General de
Cuellar being in the forefront of this.
   I talked today to the President of Yemen from up here, who
thinks there's some chance for some mediation, and so it's fine for
them to go forward. But I don't think the Soviets see themselves in
a mediating role, and I don't intend to ask them to see themselves
in a mediating role, nor do I expect him to ask the United States
to be in a mediating role.
   Q. You said last week that you didn't foresee, at that point, a
diplomatic settlement of this problem. Has your view of that
changed?

   The U.N. secretary-general and Iraq's
foreign minister appeared close to agreement Saturday on a plan to
prevent a clash between Iraqi and U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf,
Jordanian sources said.
   Although Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar and Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz expressed only general optimism after ending
two days of talks, senior Jordanian officials described substantial
progress.
   If approved by the governments involved, the plan could free all
foreigners held in Iraq; deploy an Arab peacekeeping force as a
buffer between U.S. and Iraqi troops along the Saudi border; and
eventually resolve the status of Kuwait, the officials said.
   The Soviet Union might help mediate simultaneous withdrawals of
Iraqi troops from Kuwait and opposing forces in Saudi Arabia, they
said.
   Before leaving for the airport Saturday night, Aziz said: ``As
far as I see it, the talks were very fruitful.''
   But he added: ``This situation is complicated and dramatic (and)
cannot be resolved by dramatic diplomacy. It needs patience. It
needs time and people to understand exactly the positions.''
   Perez de Cuellar scheduled a news conference for Sunday.
   Also Saturday, the White House announced that President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet in Helsinki,
Finland, on Sept. 9.
   Jordanian officials close to the talks here said the U.N. chief
and the Iraqi minister worked on how to immediately lessen tensions
in the region.
   One official, who like the others spoke to The Associated Press
on condition of anonymity, said Perez de Cuellar delivered ``a
peaceful message'' from Bush to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Aziz said of his talks with Perez de Cuellar: ``I listened to
him very carefully and told him about our situation and the ways
and means to reach the common goals we share . . . which are peace
and stability in the region.''
   Bush demands that Iraq leave Kuwait and restore the deposed
royal government. Saddam wants to link his withdrawal from Kuwait
with an Israeli pullout from the occupied territories and a Syrian
pullout from Lebanon.
   Perez de Cuellar's talks with Aziz lasted far longer than
originally scheduled. They took place as Jordan's King Hussein was
in Germany on the eighth stop of a 10-nation tour to seek peace.
   Both Perez de Cuellar and Aziz met with Prince Hassan, Hussein's
brother and regent, to discuss Jordan's initiatives for an Arab
buffer force and a negotiated solution principally among Arabs, a
palace official said.
   Perez de Cuellar and Aziz met privately, then with aides on
Friday, and decided to meet again Saturday.
   At a news briefing Friday night, the secretary-general described
Saddam's promise to release foreign women and children as ``an
important step forward.'' But he added, ``From my point of view
this is not enough.''
   Aziz said all foreigners could leave, men included, if the
United Nations could produce guarantees that the United States
would not attack.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States made a similar offer last
week, but Washington said it rejected any conditions for releasing
hostages.
   Iraq has detained about 21,000 Westerners, including 3,000
Americans, since overrunning Kuwait.

   BUSH: Well, I haven't seen any flexibility on the key point,
which is the operating within the United Nations mandate.
   I've listened carefully and follow up as carefully as we can on
various conversations that Saddam Hussein has, and what the world
community has said is to get out of Iraq, and to ... out of Kuwait,
and to restore the rulers. And now you see the Arab League acting
and calling for reparations, but on _ for Saddam Hussein to make
good on reparations _ but I don't see any willingness on his part
to undertake what the world community is looking for. So I'd like
to be optimistic, and I think it's fine to have these talks going
on.
   I encouraged Javier Perez de Cuellar, and told him I wished him
great success, but I don't want to mislead the American people by
saying that I think there's some breakthrough at hand or some
flexibility that is clearly going to be required on his part to
live within the mandate of the United Nations.
   Q. Sir, what do you make about _ of the piecemeal approach that
Saddam has been taking releasing a few women and children.
   BUSH: I don't like that. Yeah. I don't like it. I don't like it.
I don't think the world likes it. I'm glad when any American comes
out of there, but there's a certain brutality, a certain tawdry
performance in all of this.
   Q. What do you think his motive is in handling it that way?
   BUSH: Well, I can't anticipate his motive, but it is just
turning off world opinion. It is so base and so outrageous that I
think most people in the Arab world are very embarrassed by this,
and I think that's certainly true of others around the world.
   I've talked to so many leaders, and they all agree that this is
_ this is just a despicable performance.
   Q. How long can you let it go on, sir?
   BUSH: Well, I don't _ I've not wanted a deadline. I don't ...
deadlines. I've got to ...
   Q. Mr. President, can you tell us when you first broached this
idea of a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev?
   BUSH: Over a week ago, maybe, or something like that.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's desire for a U.S.-Soviet
summit next Sunday stems from concern about the buildup of U.S.
troops near his borders and his desire to bolster his country's
flagging superpower status.
   Gorbachev says he is campaigning for a diplomatic rather than a
military solution against Iraq not because his country has become
weaker, but because it conforms to his ``new thinking'' _ the
approach that underlay arms agreements he has signed with the
United States.
   ``Some people think we lose our prestige and reputation'' by
advocating peaceful means to force an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait,
he told a news conference on Friday.
   ``It is not so. I think that everything will depend on whether
we are successful in using political measures,'' he said.
   By pushing for a peaceful solution, said Angela Stent of
Georgetown University, Gorbachev is calculating that the Soviets
``will emerge from this with a stronger international position,
even in the Middle East,'' where the Kremlin has lost ground to the
United States over the last decade.
   It remains unclear what led to the decision to hold a summit at
a time when the Soviets seem to be sitting on the superpower
sidelines. The announcement came after a visit to Moscow last week
by White House chief of staff John Sununu. Ostensibly, he was in
town as part of a long-scheduled program to impart U.S. management
skills to the Soviet executive branch.
   Soviet cooperation with Washington in the current crisis has
reduced the dangers for the Bush administration, vastly diminishing
the threat of a global war resulting from any conflict involving
the U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia.
   Overall, however, Gorbachev seems poised to gain more than Bush
from the summit. He is swamped with political trouble at home, and
he has come under public pressure from his military for guarantees
that U.S. troops will be withdrawn from the gulf once the crisis
has passed.
   The Soviet commander of the Warsaw Pact, Gen. Vladimir N. Lobov,
was quoted last Thursday by the state news agency Tass as warning
that the presence of so many U.S. troops in Saudia Arabia, less
than 700 miles from the Soviet border, could alter the strategic
balance.
   He said the buildup could derail talks in Vienna aimed at
reducing troops stationed in Europe by the Warsaw Pact and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Belonogov told a parliamentary
committee that because of the military buildup, ``the situation is
becoming more and more explosive. And there are no guarantees that
the United States will leave Saudi Arabia after the crisis is
settled.''
   Gorbachev responded Friday that ``I don't think that the U.S.
leadership, after political solutions to this conflict have been
found, will preserve'' its force in Saudi Arabia.
   ``I believe that when a solution has been found, we will be able
to provide guarantees,'' he said. ``And I believe that the sooner
we have a military detente after that, the more calm we all will
feel.''
   Gorbachev and his generals clearly would feel better if Bush
stated such guarantees publicly in Helsinki, where the Sept. 9
summit will take place.
   The benefit may be greater for Gorbachev in the short term than
in the long term, as the Soviets become increasingly preoccupied
with their crumbling economy and ethnic unrest that is altering the
shape of the nation.
   The world has changed greatly since the Middle East War of 1973,
when the White House ordered a nuclear alert, opening U.S. missile
silos to demonstrate support for Israel against Arab nations,
including Iraq, which were armed and backed by the Kremlin.
   Since then, the Soviets have lost their empire in Eastern
Europe, signed arms control pacts with the United States, mended
fences with China and taken steps to open diplomatic relations with
Israel.
   ``They are in retreat,'' said Adam Ulam of Harvard University.
``If we had had this crisis four or five years ago, the Soviets
would have been prudent, but they would have been issuing grave
warnings to the United States.''
   Although the Soviets are siding with the United States, their
support has been lukewarm.
   The Kremlin has backed a U.N. Security Council resolution that
Iraq withdraw its invasion forces from Kuwait, stopped its own
substantial arms shipments to the government of Saddam Hussein, and
said it expects to lose $880 million in trade for its actions.
   But so far, the Soviets have balked at joining the American
naval blockade against Iraq.
   And although the Kremlin halted its arms shipments to Iraq, it
has not withdrawn 193 Soviet military specialists and 5,000
construction workers stationed there. It also pulled its diplomats
out of Kuwait rather than keeping there in defiance of Saddam
Hussein's order to leave.

   Although he was acquitted, the trial of
an Army sergeant charged with killing a civilian during the U.S.
invasion of Panama has left some soldiers with doubts about using
deadly power.
   ``It would make me hesitate,'' Sgt. Gina Nixon said Friday after
the military jury announced the verdict. ``Just look at the all the
things he's gone through to prove his innocence.''
   Master Sgt. Roberto Enrique Bryan, 43, a paratrooper with 19
years in the Army, was found innocent of unpremeditated murder, or
voluntary manslaughter, in the death of a wounded, unarmed
Panamanian.
   Ted Sampley, publisher of U.S. Veteran News and Report, said the
court-martial has caused ``irreparable damage to the morale of
combat soldiers. Combat soldiers must not hesitate in the face of
the enemy.'' The publication set up a defense fund for Bryan.
   ``The message is one of confusion,'' Sampley said. ``What is a
combat soldier's exact role now? Should he be a police officer and
worry about human rights. Or is he a soldier conditioned to inflict
deadly casualties on the enemy?''
   In the Dec. 23, 1989, episode, Bryan's unit stopped a carload of
five Panamanians at a roadblock. A grenade was tossed and the
soldiers opened fire, killing four of the men; 10 American soldiers
were injured by the grenade.
   The fifth Panamanian man was injured. Bryan shot and killed him
a short time later under circumstances that were at issue in the
trial.
   The prosecution's case rested on the testimony of 1st Lt.
Brandon Thomas, who said Bryan shot the man without provocation to
avenge the soldiers injured in the grenade explosion. A prosecutor,
Capt. Charlie Luckey, called it ``a battlefield summary execution.''
   Witnesses supported Bryan's contention that the man made
threatening moves and testified that Thomas did not see the
shooting.
   Luckey said the defense witnesses who testified they saw the
Panamanian make a threatening motion ``all missed something.''
   ``We're all soldiers and we all know we kill the enemy (but)
we're all soldiers and we all know when the enemy is shot up and
wounded and no longer a threat, we all know he's no longer a
combatant,'' Lucky told jurors.
   Bryan's unit, along with most of the 82nd Airborne Division from
the base, has been deployed to Saudi Arabia. The soldiers still on
post Friday said they would have reacted as Bryan did.
   ``Probably under the same circumstances, I would have done the
same thing,'' said Master Sgt. Don Gouldsmith.
   Bryan proved by his actions that he was ``willing to put his
soldiers' welfare first, regardless of what the outcome was. You
don't find that everyday. It's indicative of a good leader,''
Gouldsmith said.
   Sgt. David McLean said he could only hope that the court-martial
didn't cause soldiers in a combat situation to hesitate.
   `Stop and think (about shooting), and you might not be around,''
he said.
   At least three other U.S. soldiers have been prosecuted for
their actions during the Panama invasion. One was convicted of
unpremeditated murder and two others were found guilty of lesser
charges.

   A delegation of U.S. senators on
Saturday brought mail and words of support to U.S. troops in Saudi
Arabia, and two said the Middle East crisis had changed their views
on sales of U.S. arms to the Saudis.
   The 14-member delegation received a 30-minute briefing from the
commander of American forces in the Middle East, Army Gen. H.
Norman Schwarzkopf, before heading to a number of American base
camps in northeast Saudi Arabia.
   ``We're going to get rid of Saddam Hussein, and then we'll bring
you guys home,'' Carl Levin, D-Mich., told one group of soldiers.
   Senator David Durenberger, R-Minn., said that the longer the
standoff dragged on the greater the risk for the Iraqi president.
   Senator Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said Schwarzkopf told the
senators the U.S. mission remained a defensive one and that no
attack on Bagdhad is planned for now.
   Cranston, a strong supporter of Israel who has opposed past
sales of high-tech U.S. arms to the Saudis, said the current crisis
had convinced him ``we should make available what they need.''
   ``I was the leader of the opposition, but not any more,''
Cranston said of military sales to the Saudis. ``Now they are
allied with us, they are sitting on the front lines, they will take
the first casualties.''
   Another fierce defender of Israel in the Senate, New York
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan, said he too was convinced the
Saudis now are deserving of further U.S. military equipment.
   Several senators said they wished more nations would join in the
multinational defense force.
   ``I would like to see some of the Western European nations being
more supportive,'' said Senator John Glenn, an Ohio Democrat.
Glenn, the former astronaut, rode in the cockpit of a C-130
Hercules transport plane for one leg of the trip.
   The senators took notes from soldier constituents and promised
to contact families back home. They also brought boxes of mail and
words of support.
   The leader of the delegation, Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Claiborne Pell, arrived with three boxes of mail. Aides
said the boxes contained 600 pieces of mail from Pell's
constituents in Rhode Island.
   The Saturday visit was the second by a congressional delegation
_ eight senators came earlier in the week _ and a third is due
Sunday. A group of U.S. congressmen visited sailors Saturday aboard
the USS La Salle.
   If the troops were looking for word on when they might be coming
home, they were disappointed.
   Glenn said the ``international squeeze play'' was taking its
toll. ``But how long it takes, nobody knows _ anywhere from six
weeks to six months and beyond.''

   President Bush said Saturday that he
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet next Sunday in
Helsinki, Finland, for a ``free-flowing'' one-day summit on the
Middle East crisis and other issues.
   The third summit between the two leaders was announced
simultaneously here _ where the president was wrapping up a 25-day
vacation _ and in Moscow.
   ``We have many matters to discuss,'' Bush said, adding there was
``no agenda'' for the meeting. He said he proposed the meeting and
Gorbachev accepted.
   While Bush sought to lower expectations that the summit might
help resolve the Middle East standoff, the meeting was portrayed by
administration aides as symbolically important if only as a show of
U.S.-Soviet solidarity against Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Moscow has been Iraq's chief arms supplier and there are
currently Soviet military advisers there.
   Bush said he and Gorbachev ``seem to be in general agreement''
over the crisis, even though Soviet support for military action in
the gulf has been lukewarm. He said he did not see the Soviets
acting as a mediator in seeking to persuade Saddam to withdraw his
troops from Kuwait.
   The president asserted several times that matters other than the
Middle East would be discussed at the summit.
   He said that among a ``wide array of questions that could use
consultation at this time'' is progress on an agreement to reduce
conventional forces in Europe. Both leaders have voiced a hope that
the treaty can be signed later this year at a 35-nation summit.
   However, administration officials have said that while the talks
are on track in terms of reducing troops, there have been recent
hangups on artillery and aircraft reductions.
   Bush said he would take his wife Barbara to Helsinki and that
Raisa Gorbachev was expected to accompany the Soviet president. The
trip also is expected to give Bush a chance to try out a new Air
Force One, a modified version of a Boeing 747 that was delivered
just last week.
   Bush has had two previous meetings as president with Gorbachev:
last December on the Mediterranean island-nation of Malta and in
late May and early June in Washington. Gorbachev also met five
times with former President Reagan.
   Dressed in a light tweed sports coat, Bush answered reporters'
questions on his way to a round of golf. The president was to
return to Washington on Monday.
   He said it was his ``gut instinct'' to ask Congress to forgive
some of Egypt's $6.7 billion military debt to the United States as
a gesture of appreciation for its support in the current crisis.
   Asked what he hoped to accomplish at his summit with Gorbachev,
Bush said: ``Being sure we're together. ... It is my view that it
is just important that we have good, free-flowing discussions about
this.''
   The Soviet Union voted in favor of a U.N. Security Council
resolution authorizing the use of force to impose sanctions on
Iraq, but it has voiced reservations about the U.S.-led naval
blockade.
   Moscow has stopped arms shipments to Iraq but nearly 200 Soviet
military advisers and 5,000 construction workers remain there.
   Although Bush has spoken by phone with dozens of world leaders
about the Middle East crisis, he has not talked directly to
Gorbachev since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   He said this is because he had hoped he would be meeting the
Soviet leader.
   Bush was to spend Saturday night in Helsinki in advance of the
all-day Sunday session. Aides said that Bush did not plan to visit
any other countries on the trip.
   Although Bush stressed several times that there was ``no
agenda,'' press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: ``They both know
what they want to talk about.''
   ``A lot has happened since the two of them met before, not only
in the Persian Gulf,'' said national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft.
   He mentioned Cambodia and Afghanistan as other areas that needed
superpower attention.
   As for the Soviets acting as mediator in the crisis, Bush said,
``I don't see a mediating role at all and I don't think the Soviets
see themselves as having a mediating role. There are a lot of
mediators out there trying hard.''
   He mentioned U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar as
``being in the forefront of this.''
   Perez de Cuellar conferred Saturday with the Iraqi foreign
minister in Amman, Jordan. Senior Jordanian officials said the
meeting produced some progress toward reaching an agreement that
could free all foreigners held in Iraqi, deploy an Arab
peacekeeping force as a buffer between U.S. and Iraqi troops along
the Saudi border and eventually resolve the status of Kuwait.
   As he had done before, Bush voiced pessimism over chances for a
diplomatic breakthrough.
   ``I haven't seen any flexibility'' on Saddam's part, he said.
   Asked about Saddam Hussein's piecemeal release of some women and
children, Bush said: ``I don't like it ... I'm glad when any
American comes out of there, but there's a certain brutality, a
certain tawdry performance in all of this.''
   ``I've talked to so many leaders and they all agree that this is
just a despicable performance.''
   Aides said Bush suggested a meeting last week in a diplomatic
cable to Gorbachev. That was followed by two phone conversations
between Secretary of State James A. Baker and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said that the very fact that Bush and Gorbachev were
meeting to discuss the Middle East could increase pressure on
Saddam. ``Once again, it shows world unity in opposition to Saddam
Hussein,'' he said.
   Earlier Saturday, Scowcroft had refused to confirm an Associated
Press report about the upcoming summit.
   As Scowcroft answered questions at a briefing, Fitzwater took
two urgent phone calls _ one from Bush and the second from Baker.
He went to the podium, scribbled a note to Scowcroft, and whispered
to him. Turning back to reporters, Scowcroft said, ``Stay tuned,
we'll have an announcement at 1 o'clock.''
   At his briefing, Scowcroft said:
   _Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and a handful of diplomatic
personnel would remain in the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait as long as
possible to assist the 2,500 Americans there. ``Where would they
(citizens) turn? They are there to try to help Americans,'' he said.
   _Saddam is playing a game with hostages in which ``the ground
rules change daily and sometimes hourly. We demand that he release
all innocent civilians detained against their will.''

   Here is a comparison of two Soviet economic plans,
according to the newspaper Trud and the Sept. 2 edition of the
weekly Moscow News. One plan was being prepared by the government
of Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov, and the other from a working group
headed by Stanislav Shatalin, a member of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
Presidential Council advisory group.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PRICES:
   RYZHKOV PLAN: Prices would be raised at once _ perhaps by as
much as two to three times _ by administrative decree, with a
later, gradual transformation to market prices. Hardest-hit groups,
such as the elderly and non-working mothers, would get compensation.
   SHATALIN PLAN: The market, not administrative decree, would
determine prices on many goods. There would be gradual increases in
wholesale prices of energy. Prices would be frozen on about 100 to
150 basic goods and services for the entire transition period.
After that, the prices of 70 percent to 80 percent of the goods
would be free-floating. Rationing is not ruled out and social
assistance would be provided.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PRIVATIZATION OF BUSINESSES AND PROPERTY:
   RYZHKOV PLAN: Long-term denationalization of businesses and
property; the state would control at least 50 percent of shares in
most industries.
   SHATALIN PLAN: State control over businesses and property would
end, with the private sector prevailing in most industries. Some
property would be sold at low or symbolic cost to labor
collectives. Leasing might be possible, as would be private family
property, but the republics would determine some forms of ownership.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BUDGET, FINANCING:
   RYZHKOV PLAN: Reliance on taxation for income.
   SHATALIN PLAN: Strict control on state spending, measures for a
sounder ruble, reform of the banking system.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   CENTRAL CONTROL&equals;
   RYZHKOV PLAN: Strongly resembles the present system in that the
central government still would maintain major control, determining
what its own powers should be and leaving residual powers to the
republics. The central government could reduce its powers if so
inclined.
   SHATALIN PLAN: Economic union would be on a voluntary basis. The
sovereign republics together would decide what powers the central
government should have.

   A red-faced national security
adviser Brent Scowcroft, who usually does not preside over news
briefings, should have followed his instincts Saturday.
   As the White House aide was on camera refusing to confirm press
reports of a new U.S.-Soviet summit, presidential press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater was on the telephone at the other end of the room,
being told by President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III that the summit was on.
   Fitzwater hustled up to where Scowcroft was still saying he
would not be able to confirm that a summit was in the offing.
Scowcroft interrupted himself as Fitzwater hastily scribbled a note.
   ``Stay tuned,'' Scowcroft told reporters. ``We'll have an
announcement at one o'clock.'' Then wryly, ``You know, I knew I
shouldn't have done this.''
   Reports of a possible summit between Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev had been on news wires for more than 12 hours
when Scowcroft opened the briefing for reporters.
   ``I'm not aware of any plans, but I can't rule it out,''
Scowcroft told reporters at Bush's vacation retreat here.
   That's when the phone in the back of the room began to ring.
   The first call for Fitzwater came from Bush, who was fishing on
his powerboat in the Atlantic. The second was from Secretary of
State James A. Baker III.
   Afterward, Fitzwater told reporters that both Bush and Baker had
called to inform him that final details of the summit had fallen
into place and that it could be announced officially later that day.
   ``The president asked me, `Where are you?' I said, `I'm on
camera,''' Fitzwater said.
   ``There are certain issues of comity when you're making
arrangements for these things, and an agreement on when it will be
announced,'' he responded, ``and there's usually a desire to have a
simultaneous announcement.''
   At 1 p.m., Bush made the official announcement of a one-day
meeting in Helsinki, Finland, a week from Sunday. A simultaneous
announcement was made on the Soviet television show, ``Vremya,''
and transmitted by the state Tass news agency.

   A fugitive who once faked suicide to escape
trial fatally shot himself when FBI agents arrived at his apartment
to arrest him, the bureau said.
   Agents acting on tips from television viewers of ``America's
Most Wanted'' were poised Friday to arrest Richard Allen Sturdy,
but he shot himself when they knocked on his door, said Richard S.
Swensen, the FBI's top agent in New Orleans.
   Sturdy died at a hospital soon after, Swensen said.
   The Fox Television Network on Aug. 26 broadcast a segment about
Sturdy, who was accused in a multimillion dollar fraud scheme.
Several Metairie viewers called in with information about Sturdy,
Swensen said.
   As the operator of Strawn Crossing Grain Co., a small grain
elevator in Jacksonville, Ill., Sturdy allegedly recruited other
elevator managers to create records for nonexistent loads of corn
and soybeans, Swensen said. The fake records were used to defraud
large grain processors of up to $10 million over about 20 years, he
said.
   Sturdy was arrested and indicted in 1988 on federal charges of
mail fraud, conspiracy and defrauding the Internal Revenue Service.
   About two weeks before his trial was to begin in January 1989, a
suicide note was found in Sturdy's motel room and his wallet and
jacket were found on a bridge over the Illinois River in Peoria,
Ill.
   Authorities discounted the ``suicide'' and issued a warrant
charging Sturdy with failing to appear for trial.

   America and its allies may wish to see
Saddam Hussein go, but Iraqi exiles say no one is in sight to
replace him and without a strongman in charge, Iraq could explode
into an orgy of bloodletting.
   ``Saddam has managed to crush any successor and any opposition
out of existence. There are no charismatic leaders waiting in the
wings to take over if something happened to Saddam,'' a senior
member of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan in London said in a
telephone interview.
   For years, Saddam has moved against the opposition in Iraq and
outside. The rebellious Kurds are still active, but they have been
badly mauled by the Iraqi president's legions.
   ``You could call it the Romania of the Middle East,'' one
London-based Iraqi emigre said.
   But no one expects a popular Romania-style uprising in Iraq, and
a palace coup presents its own problems.
   After years of maneuvering himself to a position of power,
Saddam knows how to guard his flanks.
   Since he invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, reports from Baghdad say Saddam
has been moving constantly between underground bunkers.
   Reports from Stockholm a week ago said a Swedish company had
built 14 installations under Baghdad, equipped with filters against
nuclear radiation and poison gas, during Iraq's 1980-88 war with
Iran.
   For years, Saddam has systematically removed anyone who opposed
him or appeared to be gaining power.
   His inner circle is made up mostly of relatives from his home
village of Takrit in northern Iraq. All became wealthy supporting
him.
   ``They know that when Saddam goes, they go,'' said a former
Iraqi army officer now living in London. ``So who's going to pull
the trigger?''
   Like all Iraqi political exiles interviewed by The Associated
Press, he spoke on condition of anonymity, citing fear of reprisals
against his family in Iraq.
   Estimates of how many Iraqis have fled in the past 20 years
range from 500,000 to 3 million.
   They represent all shades of political opinion, but all keep a
low profile, fearing Saddam's long reach.
   His wrath has been felt by dissenters and members of ``enemy''
groups _ Communists, pro-Syrian members of the ruling Ba'ath Party,
Kurds and pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems.
   Saddam is a Sunni Moslem, the minority sect which dominates
Iraqi politics.
   Iraqis took refuge in dozens of countries. One of the largest
communities was in Kuwait before the invasion.
   Iraqis in Western Europe say hundreds of exiles were quickly
rounded up and taken to Baghdad. What befell them is still a
mystery.
   Like the Romanians when Nicolae Ceaucescu fell, Iraqis might see
the end of Saddam as a signal to exact revenge on thousands of
informers and militiamen.
   ``There will be a bloodbath. These people have been subjected to
so much brutality, it is beyond anger,'' said an exile from a small
village in northern Iraq.
   Exiles say a military coup would be the only way to get rid of
Saddam. But Saddam has ousted senior officers who became too
popular or voiced dissenting opinions, and has reportedly crushed
several coup attempts.
   ``Even if there were a coup, it would be hard to find an Iraqi
face presentable to the people and the West,'' said an Iraqi
engineer living in Paris. ``Everyone's been tainted by Saddam.''
   Possibilities include Nizar Hamdoun, a deputy foreign minister
and former ambassador in Washington; Taha Yassin Ramadan, a member
of the ruling Revolution Command Council; Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's
chief deputy, and Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, the only Christian
in Saddam's Cabinet.
   The fear is that a dictator will emerge to replace Saddam,
possibly armed with nuclear weapons produced by the ambitious arms
program now under way.

<DATELINE>RUWEISHID, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fair-skinned, redheaded Scottish
woman arriving in Jordan on Saturday with thousands of Arab and
Asian refugees said she was smuggled out of Kuwait by her husband,
a professor at Kuwait University.
   Patricia Fido, a native of Edinburgh, Scotland, is the wife of
professor Abdullah Fido.
   She stood at the Ruweishid border post Saturday, as sharply
defined as a lighthouse, in fashionable European dress, surrounded
by a mass of robes, sarongs and dhotis at the once-sleepy border
post _ now a sprawling refugee camp.
   ``I was smuggled out by my husband,'' she declared.
   Fido had accompanied his wife and three sons, ages three to 11,
on a 36-hour voyage across the desert from Kuwait, through Baghdad,
to Ruweishid.
   He did not reveal how he got his redheaded wife out of Iraq. He
also did not specify his own nationality.
   A senior border official said Mrs. Fido was the only Westerner
among the 10,000 people, mostly Arabs and Asians, who came through
the frontier Saturday.
   Fido acknowledged relief at finally escaping Iraq.
   ``We were lucky to get out, but many of our friends are
suffering,'' he said.
   His wife, asked whether their friends in Kuwait City were in
hiding, said, ``No, but they are keeping a low profile, very
low-key, staying in their homes and not going out.''
   The family's large green Mercedes was piled high with
belongings. Hundreds of cars with white Kuwaiti plates streamed
through the border post at a steady rate. Most had piles of luggage
balanced on the roof, with more bundles and families of up to seven
or eight people crammed inside.
   Thousands more people _ Egyptians, Indians, Bangladeshis,
Pakistanis, Filipinos and Thais _ camped under tents made of
bedsheets, amidst growing piles of litter.
   The stench from garbage and poor sanitary arrangements is such
that many evacuees walk around with pieces of cloth tied around
their faces, like surgical masks.
   Most are waiting for their embassies to complete arrangements
for their journeys home.
   ``We are doing the best we can under the circumstances,'' said
the border official, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
   He said the flow of refugees had slowed considerably since early
in the week.
   Many of those arriving Saturday appeared to be more affluent
people, with a goodly number traveling in expensive cars. Those in
private vehicles were quickly cleared and continued to Amman.
   Many penniless families have waited up to five days for
clearance to enter Jordan, only to wait again for evacuation to
their homelands.

   Despite President Bush's assertion that the
amount of goods reaching Iraq through Jordan has been reduced to a
``trickle,'' a new State Department report says there is still
heavy traffic using that route in defiance of United Nations
sanctions.
   ``Food supplies and other goods still are transiting Jordanian
highways, obviously destined for Iraq,'' the report said.
``Numerous tractor-trailers and other trucks were moving east from
Jordan to Iraq.''
   State Department officials said the report was completed
Thursday, the same day Bush told a news conference that commerce
between Jordan and Iraq ``has come down to a bit of a trickle.''
   At another point, Bush acknowledged that he was unable to give
the precise quantity involved in the cross-border traffic.
   During their meeting two weeks ago, Bush said Jordan's King
Hussein offered him assurances he would comply with the embargo.
   But The Washington Post in its Saturday editions said the Bush
administration was sending a special envoy to tell Hussein not to
expect any emergency financial aid from the international community
until he cuts off the remaining cross-border traffic.
   At the same time, administration officials said they were
considering forgiving Egypt's $6.7 billion military debt to the
United States. Egypt is one of a handful of countries which has
sent troops to Saudi Arabia in support of the U.S. military buildup.
   The New York Times said in Saturday editions that officials were
considering providing Israel with F-16 and F-15 fighters, Apache
anti-tank helicopters and Patriot ground-to-air missiles that could
be used against attacking missiles. The package also could include
M-60 tanks.
   Administration officials said no final decisions have been made.
   Bush would not comment on the possibility of forgiving Egypt's
debts when asked Saturday in Kennebunkport, Maine. But he told
reporters ``his gut instinct'' was to make such a recommendation to
Congress.
   Bush said he wants to work with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
to alleviate Egypt's ``grave financial problems.''
   The one-page State Department report on compliance with
sanctions, made available to The Associated Press, was an update on
efforts to circumvent the economic embargo that the United Nations
authorized against Iraq early last month.
   The report said Syria has not prevented some smuggling of
agricultural products into Iraq but that truck traffic via Iraq's
northern neighbor, Turkey, was very limited.
   The report also said Iraq was continuing to shop actively on the
West European market for other goods, including military and
military-related equipment. There were reports Friday that Iraq has
offered the Philippines an oil-for-sugar deal.
   Bush has staked the success of his policy on an effective global
economic embargo against Iraq, contending that widespread
deprivation in Iraq eventually will force Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to withdraw his forces from Kuwait.
   An earlier State Department update on the sanctions said Libyan
planes have flown a number of cargo aircraft into Baghdad, an
indication that Iraq ``may increasingly rely on air transport as a
means of avoiding interception of sea shipments.''
   Yemen also has been cooperating with the Iraqis, unloading Iraqi
oil at Aden 10 days ago in violation of the sanctions, the report
said.
   The Washington Post said Saturday's that Iran also was being
eyed by smugglers as a potential conduit for sending goods to Iraq.
Iran is on record in support of the sanctions but would have
difficulty policing the long border between the two countries.
   The Washington Times reported this past week that Cuba and North
Korea are flying military-related equipment to Iraq.
   Still, the administration is pleased with what it regards as the
widespread international compliance with the embargo.
   Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson called the
international compliance ``unprecedented.'' Georgetown University
economist Clyde Hufbauer described it as ``amazing.''
   One measure of the effectiveness of the sanctions is that Iraq
reportedly introduced a rationing system on Saturday.
   Coupon books entitle each Iraqi to a monthly allocation of 13
pounds of flour, 3.3 pounds of rice, 2.2 pounds of sugar, 3.5
ounces of tea, 1.1 pounds of oil, 17 ounces of detergent and one
bar of soap, sources said.
   Children under one year of age receive three cans of powdered
milk each month, but older children receive none. Fresh fruit and
vegetables from summer crops remain plentiful, the sources said.

<HEAD>Saudi Border Post is Refugees' Heartbreak Hotel</HEAD>

   Traffic has slowed to a trickle at
the main Kuwait-Saudi Arabia border post, a new heartbreak hotel
for poor refugees with no place to go.
   ``We have been here four days and we haven't seen a refugee,''
said Dr. Rapia Mohammed, one of the four doctors and five nurses at
a tent hospital of the Red Crescent relief group. The Saudis set up
the hospital following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to care
for dehydrated and sick refugees.
   At the seedy, fluorescent-lit waiting room at the Saudi customs
post, Bangladeshi and Afghani workers who fled Kuwait sleep on the
floor or outside on blankets. The Saudis give them food every day,
and they pray in the mosque at the post.
   ``The Iraqis take all our things from us: watch, money and my
shoes. My shoes are new so they take that. They are very bad
people,'' said Mousafer Al-Lahgul, 33, an Afghan mason, who has
been living at the border post for three days. He doesn't know how
long he'll stay.
   In the weeks following the invasion, the border post 60 miles
from Kuwait City along a paved road was frantic with activity.
About 70,000 Kuwaitis alone are now in the Saudi eastern province.
About 100 Americans, many married to Kuwaitis, crossed the line
here to freedom.
   Many stayed at the Khafji Beach Hotel on the Arabian Gulf before
moving on.
   But the Iraqis have dug up the road with bulldozers, making it
impassable even to four-wheel-drive vehicles, said a U.S. State
Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Now, the only escape routes from Kuwait are across the
treacherous and scorching desert.
   ``It's completely different'' from the situation in mid-August,
said the U.S. official.
   At the border post, bored Saudi customs agents say only one or
two cars a day have passed through recently.
   Al-Lahgul and two friends were injured early last month when
their car crashed while fleeing Kuwait. They each spent five days
in a Saudi hospital near the border.
   He said the Saudis promised to take him to Riyadh, the capital.
After that, his life is up in the air.
   ``They (Saudis) told me maybe they come today,'' he said
Saturday as he gingerly stood up with the help of a cane.

   A memorial to Nazi war deserters was unveiled
in Goettingen on Saturday while activists gathered on the former
``death strip'' in Berlin during events to mark the anniversary of
the outbreak of World War II.
   Ironically, the day noting the 1939 Nazi invasion of Poland also
coincided with tougher rules for Poles and other former East Bloc
citizens seeking to visit West Berlin.
   In one of the few events to acknowledge the anniversary, the
first official West German monument to those who fled the Nazi Army
was dedicated in Goettingen, about 110 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   Goettingen Mayor Artur Levi said men who deserted the Nazi
military were unfairly forgotten and whose ``love for the
fatherland knew no limits.'' The granite memorial contains a
mutilated swastika, a symbol of the Nazi regime.
   In Berlin, several hundred church, environmental and peace
activists gathered on Potsdamer Platz, a former main square in
pre-war Berlin that was reduced to the barren ``death strip'' after
the Berlin Wall was erected.
   The group laid the cornerstone of a building they hoped would be
called ``European House,'' devoted to peaceful cooperation between
European nations.
   A small group of peace activists also rallied in the East German
city of Weimar, the center of German culture in the 18th and 19th
centuries. The Weimar Republic, named for the city, governed
Germany from the end of World War I until the rise of Nazism in the
1930s.
   On Saturday, tougher West Berlin visa requirements for Eastern
European residents went into effect.
   Visitors now must have a written invitation from somebody living
in the city, a hotel reservation and adequate amounts of Western
currency.
   West Berlin has been the only Western city where Poles could
travel with no restrictions. They converge on the city in large
numbers to buy goods scarce in their country.
   ``We are going to protest and defend Polish citizens' rights
with all means we have,'' said Polish Foreign Ministry spokesman
Witold Gruszka in Warsaw on Saturday.
   The rules were approved by the United States, France and
Britain, which still have final say over many of the laws passed in
West Berlin.
   The German states are scheduled to be united Oct. 3, when the
former World War II allies are to give up their special rights to
Berlin.
   Also Saturday, East German Defense Minister Rainer Eppelmann was
quoted as saying that Soviet troops should leave the country more
quickly than the four-year timetable agreed to by the Soviets.
   Eppelmann, quoted by the East Berlin newspaper Berliner Zeitung,
said four years is too long.

<HEAD>U.N. Cambodia Plan Raises New Hopes, Despite Past Failures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRUNNSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new U.N. peace plan for Cambodia has
again raised hopes for ending the civil war, but many past efforts
have failed after initial optimism.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council on
Tuesday proposed a U.N. interim administration in Cambodia until a
new government is elected. They envisaged deploying up to 20,000
U.N. personnel, including a peacekeeping force, to bolster a truce
and guide the nation to democracy.
   The Vietnamese-installed communist government of Premier Hun Sen
is battling a guerrilla coalition composed of the communist Khmer
Rouge and two non-Communist groups, one headed by former head of
state Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the other by former Premier Son
Sann.
   All sides welcomed the U.N. plan and signaled willingness to
hold talks to discuss it in detail.
   But they have made no concessions on long-standing differences.
Meanwhile, fighting has increased as both sides have reported big
battles for control of western and central areas during the current
rainy season.
   One diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the
proposal a breakthrough because it was endorsed by Britain, China,
France, the Soviet Union and the United States, which back
different parties in the war. They are the permanent members of the
security council.
   China, the guerrillas' main backer, said conditions had been
created for a political settlement ``and the time is right for a
settlement.''
   U.S. officials at the United Nations tried on Friday to persuade
Vietnamese diplomats to back the U.N. plan.
   The same day, the Vietnamese government said the new plan went
``in the right direction in the search for an overall, fair and
reasonable political solution.''
   But outside efforts cannot succeed without the approval of the
Cambodian factions. Each time they have neared breakthroughs in the
past, they later retreated to their old positions.
   In Tokyo in June, Sihanouk and Hun Sen signed a document saying
they wanted a Supreme National Council formed that would arrange
the first truce in the war and act as an interim body before
elections. The council would comprise representatives from the
government and rebels.
   But the agreement collapsed quickly. Fighting continued, and the
Khmer Rouge insisted it have the same number of council seats as
the Hun Sen government.
   Both sides expressed willingness to attend talks that Indonesia
is trying to arrange for this month. Indonesia has played host at
three rounds of Cambodian peace talks since 1988.
   The U.N. plan calls for five key ministries to be placed in U.N.
hands. But the government and the guerrillas have long disagreed on
the extent of the U.N. mandate.
   Phnom Penh wants to retain power in the interim period. The
guerrillas want either the United Nations or the Supreme National
Council to have interim power.
   Phnom Penh's deputy prime minister, Hor Nam Hong, welcomed the
U.N. plan but did not indicate his government would concede on the
issue of interim power.
   However, in remarks quoted by the official news media on
Saturday, he accepted the ``major role played by the United Nations
during the transitional period, notably the right to organize free
and fair elections.''
   ``Certain important ministries may be supervised by the United
Nations so that the elections can take place in a neutral political
environment,'' he said.
   Phnom Penh previously rebuffed the United Nations because it
recognizes the guerrilla coalition as Cambodia's government.
   In July, however, in a major policy shift, the United States
said it would no longer back the guerrillas' U.N. seat. Washington
also said it would consider opening direct talks with the Cambodian
government.
   The civil war began after Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978,
ending a rule of nearly four years of the Khmer Rouge. Under the
Khmer Rouge, hundreds of thousands of people died of famine, in
executions and slave labor camps.

<HEAD>Government Seizes Computers In Search For Secret Files</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NANCY, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government agents seized computer equipment
from a businessman's office Saturday in a search for a federal
prosecutor's secret computer files that were mistakenly sold for
$45.
   Charles Hayes, owner of Challenger Ltd., said federal marshals
and staff from the U.S. attorney's office in Lexington seized nine
computer terminals, a computer memory device and other equipment
from his office in Nancy, about 70 miles south of Lexington.
   Hayes said he bought a broken computer system from the U.S.
attorney's office in Lexington. After he took possession of it, the
government realized a technician failed to properly erase the
computer's memory.
   As a result, sensitive details about FBI informants, federally
protected witnesses and sealed grand jury indictments and court
records were released inadvertently to Hayes.
   Hayes said he was trying to find the records the FBI wanted and
would have turned them over anyway. He called the nine-hour search
of his offices that ended early Saturday ``the action of desperate
men.''
   Hayes' company buys government surplus equipment for resale to
the public. Some of the computer equipment was sold and Hayes said
he's trying to get the customers to return the items.
   But he has refused to identify the customers, which made
government investigators suspicious.
   Officials with the U.S. marshal's office in London, Ky., the
U.S. attorney's office in Lexington and the U.S. Justice Department
in Washington, D.C., could not be reached Saturday for comment.
   The Justice Department filed suit Thursday in London, demanding
Hayes return the computers immediately. The government also wants
Hayes to testify about who purchased the equipment or had access to
the data.
   If made public, the seven-year's worth of secret files could
ruin ongoing criminal investigations and cause ``great harm and
irreparable injury'' to the work of federal prosecutors, according
to the lawsuit.
   U.S. District Judge Eugene Siler Jr. granted the government's
request in a temporary order and scheduled a hearing Tuesday. Siler
also signed the search warrant executed Friday evening, said Hayes.
   Hayes contends he doesn't know which computers came from the
U.S. attorney's office because the equipment was mixed in with
similar inventory.

<HEAD>High Court Supports Landlord in Case Over Rental to Unmarried
Couple</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sharply divided Minnesota Supreme Court has
ruled that a landlord did not violate the state's Human Rights Act
when he refused to rent to an unmarried couple.
   The court, on a 4-3 vote that reversed a state Court of Appeals
decision, ruled Friday that Layle French did not discriminate on
the basis of marital status when he refused to rent to a woman who
planned to live with her fiance, whom she eventually married.
   ``It is simply astonishing to me that the argument is made that
the Legislature intended to protect fornication and promote a
lifestyle which corrodes the institutions which have sustained our
civilization, namely marriage and family life,'' Associate Justice
Lawrence Yetka wrote for the majority.
   ``Before abandoning fundamental values and institutions, we must
pause and take stock of our present social order: millions of drug
abusers; rampant child abuse; a rising underclass without
marketable job skills ... and children growing up with no one to
guide them in developing any set of values,'' Yetka wrote.
   The landlord French, 34, of Marshall, contended that the ruling
against him violated his constitutional rights to freedom of
religion and to due process of law. His attorney argued that French
upheld a state law against fornication.
   In the ruling, Yetka said, ``at the very least, before the state
imposes sanctions on French, it must repeal the fornication
statute.''
   However, Chief Justice Peter Popovich wrote in dissent that
``this is not a case involving discrimination against fornicators,
rather it is a case involving discrimination against single people
living together.''
   Popovich also questioned the constitutionality of the
fornication law.
   The state claimed that because French was a landlord in a
secular setting, his religious beliefs were subject to the state's
prohibition against housing discrimination.
   In June last year, an administrative law judge ruled that French
violated the state's anti-discrimination law when he reneged on an
agreement to rent a house to Sue Parsons in February 1988.
   Parsons intended to live in the house with her boyfriend, whom
she later married. French said it would violate his religious
beliefs to rent to the couple before they wed.
   French said he paid Parsons $348 because he broke an oral
contract to rent her the house. He later paid a $700 civil penalty
in $1 bills, as a protest.
   A three-judge panel of the state Appeals Court last October
unanimously upheld the discrimination finding.
   It said the government may subject the practice of religion to
``reasonable'' regulation if there is an ``overriding compelling
interest.''
   In French's case, the panel said, the interest was eliminating
discrimination.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Berlin, so long divided by an ugly wall, is
being made whole again to resume its historic role as the capital
of a united Germany.
   Scaffolding covers the Brandenburg Gate, symbol of German unity,
for a facelift expected to take two years.
   There are plans to rebuild the Hotel Adlon, which sat on the
Pariser Platz in front of the towering gate, joined to the American
and British embassies in a sort of three-cornered sandwich.
   Hitler's brass, diplomats, foreign journalists, and everybody
who was anybody in the Berlin of the 1930s mingled at the fabled
Adlon.
   Bodo Freyer, one of East Berlin's leading city planners, is
reponsible for rebuilding old Berlin.
   Until the wall came down in November, Freyer's world ended at
Pariser Platz and the gate, which stands on the line dividing the
city.
   ``We never had to worry about what happened over there,'' he
said pointing at an empty white area denoting West Berlin on his
wall map. ``Now our task is to get the city to grow together
again.''
   To Freyer's delight, his job often takes him to the
once-forbidden zone to work with West Berlin planners on reviving
the central district, much of which is in East Berlin and went to
seed during four decades of communism.
   Less than 10 months after the wall opened, Berlin is booming. An
influx of 1.3 million East Germans has brought its population to
3.4 million.
   Planners don't know how many billions of dollars will be needed
to rebuild the city, but expect the process to last a decade.
   Between the world wars, Berlin was one of Europe's most dynamic
cities: an artistic mecca, a political and financial powerhouse,
and home to refugees escaping Communist upheaval in the east.
   In the 1920s, Marlene Dietrich electrified audiences in the
musical show ``Something's in the Air.''
   Great minds were drawn to Berlin. Albert Einstein taught physics
here, Jean-Paul Sartre came from Paris to philosophize, Vladimir
Nabokov wandered the streets in exile from Russia and wrote novels.
   The rise of the Nazis in the 1930s changed Berlin forever.
   Most of the Jewish community, the largest in Germany, fled or
perished in the Holocaust, and the world identified the city with
evil.
   When the Nazis cracked down on nonconformists, Berlin's artists
and independent intellectuals deserted the city.
   After the war, divided and desolate, Berlin became a backwater.
   West Berlin was an outpost of democracy in a sea of communism.
So many people fled to it from surrounding East German territory
that the Communist regime built the Berlin Wall in 1961 to keep
them in.
   The wall builders disregarded streets and subway lines, creating
an artificial strip through the city.
   ``It's a unique situation,'' Freyer said. ``A building boom will
occur to fix what happened due to the division.''
   During World War II, bombs razed the Adlon and most other
buildings in the city's historic center.
   Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's most famous prewar square, was cut in
two by the wall and became a vast no-man's land.
   A platform at Potsdamer Platz where U.S. presidents once peered
into East Berlin was an early Cold War symbol. It has been taken
down.
   Daimler-Benz, the industrial giant, wants the choicest piece of
real estate on Potsdamer Platz for a new headquarters.
   Foreign countries hope to recover embassy sites confiscated by
East Germany after the war.
   ``We have the right to the land where our embassy was before the
war,'' a senior French diplomat said. ``We would have to entirely
rebuild because it's grass now.''
   The French Embassy was across the Pariser Platz from the U.S.
Embassy and the Adlon.
   On the West Berlin side of the Brandenburg Gate, the Reichstag
waits silently. On Dec. 2, the two German legislatures will decide
whether to return a united German parliament to its original home.
   On Sunday mornings, groups of soccer players gather for pickup
games on the green expanse in front of the Reichstag, where Hitler
once addressed throngs of supporters.
   An army of rabbits that lived in the deserted area behind it has
invaded the meadows of the Tiergarten across the street.

   Two days after defeating his boss in the
Democratic primary for county commissioner, a cancer-stricken road
worker lost both his job and medical insurance.
   Newton McWilliams, who suffers from a deadly type of skin
cancer, was fired Thursday from his job as a Grant County road
worker by the man he beat in Tuesday's primary, County Commissioner
Kenneth Boyer. McWilliams received 61 percent of the vote.
   McWilliams, 32, of Lamont, said Boyer ``told me it was time to
pay the piper and that I could go campaign full time and to get off
the premises.''
   Mounting medical bills have left him in debt and he's worried
about finding another job in his condition, said McWilliams, who
for seven years helped maintain roads in this rural, northern
Oklahoma county.
   ``If you've got cancer, you can't afford to be without
insurance,'' he said Friday.
   Boyer, 59, denied any malice in firing McWilliams, although he
said Friday that he was upset about being challenged by an employee.
   ``They probably ought to have a law where a person has to resign
when they run against an incumbent or their boss,'' he said.
   McWilliams' campaign for November's general election would have
interfered with his work, said Boyer, who acknowleged that he had
had no plans to resign while running for reelection as county
commissioner.
   Boyer, who served one four-year term, said he allowed other
county employees to give unused sick days to McWilliams, who missed
a week of work a month for cancer treatments. Before that,
McWilliams was allowed six days of sick leave a year.
   ``I feel sorry for anybody who has cancer,'' Boyer said. ``It
could even happen to you or I. I did everything I possibly could.''

   A U.S. Marine who refused to go to the Persian
Gulf, saying he was a conscientious objector, will be held at the
Pearl Harbor brig until his military trial, officials said.
   Cpl. Jeffrey Paterson, 22, faces charges of violation of a
lawful order, missing movement and unauthorized absence for
refusing to board an airplane with other members of the 1st Marine
Expeditionary Brigade, who shipped out Wednesday night, Marine
officials said.
   The military equivalent of a preliminary hearing will be
scheduled for next week to look into the charges, said Capt.
Leonard Ryan, a spokesman for Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station.
   If convicted, Paterson could face maximum punishment of
imprisonment for five years and one month, dishonorable discharge,
reduction in rank and forfeiture of all pay and benefits, Ryan said.
   Paterson, of Hollister, Calif., filed for conscientious objector
status Aug. 17, about two weeks after Iraq invaded Kuwait, citing
his opposition to U.S. ``interventionist'' policies in the Middle
East.

   Iraqi authorities have pressed into service
elderly Iraqis to patrol Kuwait City and blown up public buildings
to instill fear in Kuwaitis, said an Indian refugee who arrived in
Amman on Saturday.
   Meanwhile, a New York-based human rights monitoring group,
Middle East Watch, issued a statement expressing concern about the
conduct of Iraqi troops toward Kuwaitis and non-Westerners inside
occupied Kuwait.
   The group said it had interviewed scores of Kuwaitis, Arabs and
Asians who had fled to other Middle East countries following the
Aug. 2 invasion.
   Middle East Watch said hundreds of people arrested by Iraqis
shortly after the invasion remain unaccounted for, including
Kuwaiti army officers, government officials and Iraqi dissidents.
   The group also said Iraqi troops fired on peaceful
demonstrations opposing the occupation, killing or wounding several
Kuwaitis. But Middle East Watch said it could not provide the
number of casualties.
   Harinder Pal Singh, an Indian national who ran an air
conditioning business in Kuwait for 13 years, said he had witnessed
abuses by Iraqi troops. Singh fled Kuwait earlier in the week and
arrived in Amman on Saturday.
   Singh said uniformed and armed Iraqis at least 70 years old were
patrolling the streets of Kuwait City.
   ``I don't know whether it works or not, but with a gun everyone
is afraid,'' he said.
   ``In Kuwait, there is no law and order,'' he said.
   Middle East Watch said the Iraqis were using members of the
Popular Army, a poorly trained government militia, for occupation
duty in Kuwait. After the Aug. 2 invasion, the Iraqis moved some
regular army units into positions near the border with Saudi
Arabia, where a massive U.S. troop buildup is under way.
   The refugee said officers had little apparent control over their
troops, and he described incidents in which Iraqis kidnapped
foreign women.
   ``They are especially interested in Filipino girls,'' he said.
``It happened in front of my friends.''
   Singh said soldiers manning roadblocks routinely steal personal
items from the occupants of cars.
   ``If he sees your watch, he will ask for it, and you can't do
anything about it,'' he said.
   He said the Iraqi soldiers apparently do not have enough food or
water and were foraging wherever they can.
   Middle East Watch said the widespread looting that marked the
early days of the invasion has been curbed in part by the swift and
well-publicized punishments meted out to suspected looters. Some
people taken into custody for looting have reportedly been executed.
   Singh said that some days gunfire could be heard in Kuwait City
as the Iraqis skirmished with Kuwaiti resistance fighters. He said
the Iraqi occupiers regularly destroyed public buildings with
artillery and tank fire.
   ``They'll go to an important place and destroy it with a tank as
if they want to put their stamp on each and every position,'' he
said.
   At the Turkish border outpost of Habur, a Pakistani refugee who
arrived with his wife and two children Saturday complained that
Iraqi soldiers were robbing departing foreigners.
   Ashfaq Ahmed, who worked in a factory in Kuwait, said his family
and hundreds of other Pakistanis in cars had to wait for 10 days at
the border before being allowed by the Iraqis to cross into Turkey.
   Ahmed said the Iraqis took most of his belongings, including a
camera, television set and a radio.
   ``They stole everything, everything. All our money, cigarettes,
and even my trousers,'' he said, pointing to the long robe he was
wearing.
   ``We had to bribe the officials at the border to let us
through,'' he said.

from the northern Plains to the northern Atlantic Coast.
   A few showers and thunderstorms were scattered over central
Texas, central Alabama, and from southwestern Nebraska to northern
Iowa.
   Thunderstorms along the western Gulf Coast produced strong winds
around Galveston Island Saturday morning, with gusts to 46 mph
reported.
   Sunny, dry weather prevailed across the rest of the nation.

   Commands radioed 152 million miles
across the solar system Saturday made the errant Magellan
spacecraft easier to control as it orbits Venus, NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory said.
   Engineers have not determined why the spacecraft has suffered
two long communications blackouts but were hopeful that its $744
million mission to map the planet with radar would begin this month.
   Controllers began sending commands to Magellan early Saturday to
awaken it from a so-called deep-safe mode and put it in a state
called random access memory control.
   Nearly six hours after beginning the series of orders, the lab
received Magellan's confirmation of the new configuration.
   Radio signals take 27 minutes, 10 seconds to travel from Earth
to Venus and back. Venus is Earth's closest planetary neighbor.
   Magellan appeared to be stable, its solar panels were properly
pointed at the sun and its batteries were charged, the lab said in
a statement.
   The new condition will allow flight controllers to more easily
program Magellan's computers. In addition, data from Magellan can
tell engineers more about the spacecraft's condition, said JPL
spokesman Jim Doyle.
   Next week, engineers will do more to normalize the spacecraft's
operation. If that goes without a hitch, Magellan would be ordered
on Sept. 12 to send home radar data already stored on its tape
recorder and its radar sensor would resume operation two days later.
   Magellan was launched from the space shuttle Atlantis in May
1989, and made a looping, 15-month, 948 million-mile journey to
Venus.
   The spacecraft entered orbit around the cloud-shrouded planet
Aug. 10, and things began to go wrong. The radio link from Magellan
to Earth failed for 14 hours starting Aug. 16 and for 17{ hours
beginning Aug. 21.
   Controllers put Magellan into deep-safe mode, which kept its
solar array pointed toward the sun so its batteries would stay
charged.
   Other spacecraft have passed near Venus, but they returned
images far less detailed than Magellan can produce.
   Images of Venus sent by Magellan after an Aug. 16 test of the
radar-mapping system showed extensive seismic faults, enormous
flows of solidified lava, cinder cones, a meteorite impact crater
filled with lava and innumerable valleys and mountain ridges.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration had originally
planned for Magellan to begin its mapping survey by the end of
August.

   Debby and Jerry Willis of Parkman, Maine,
nearly succeeded in their escape across the border from occupied
Kuwait into Saudi Arabia.
   But Iraqi soldiers caught them in the desert. Now, Mrs. Willis
is finally released, but her husband remains behind in Iraq as a
hostage at a military site to deter a possible U.S. attack.
   Trapped in Kuwait by the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion, the Willis' lay
low and then sought refuge in the U.S. Embassy. After two weeks,
with Iraqi troops closing in, they decided to make a run for the
border.
   ``Friends had told us to get false passports and go out with
Poles, or other foreigners, but we did not want to do that,'' Mrs.
Willis said on Saturday at the Baghdad airport, finally on her way
home on a flight with hundreds of other Western women and children.
   In their attempt to escape, the couple had headed out across the
desert for Saudi Arabia in a four-wheel drive vehicle.
   However, they could not find any local guides willing to take
the risk to help them. Instead, on their own, they tried to follow
an old water course.
   Nearly at the border, they passed an abandoned vehicle, but an
Iraqi patrol leaped out of it and ordered them to halt.
   ``We did not resist,'' said Mrs. Willis, one of the Western
women allowed to leave after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said
only foreign men would be detained.
   Mrs. Willis was a lawyer in Kuwait. Her husband, who is
originally from Johnson City, Tenn., had come looking for a job
just before the Iraqis invaded.
   They were captured on Aug. 25, more than three weeks after the
invasion.
   ``Iraqi officials stole everything from us _ cameras, jewelry,
even jeans and tennis shoes from the men,'' Mrs. Willis said. But
she said she wasn't afraid until they took away her husband.
   Willis remains in Iraq, apparently housed at a potential
military target along with other foreigners.

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen years ago, the Cold War began
to defrost when 35 world leaders met in this capital to sign the
Helsinki Human Rights Accords.
   Now, the leaders of the two superpowers will use the city as a
site to try to solve the latest threat to world peace _ the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   Washington and Moscow confirmed Saturday a summit between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will be
held in Helsinki on Sept. 9.
   Finnish President Mauno Koivisto said, ``Finland is ready to
host the meeting'' and he welcomed the two world leaders.
   Since the 1975 Helsinki Accords, foreign leaders have found this
city a useful stopover to hear Finnish leaders' views on Soviet
affairs.
   Koivisto was the first Western leader to meet Gorbachev after he
became Soviet Communist Party leader in 1985.
   Previously, Koivisto had held talks with three other Soviet
leaders: Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov, and Konstantin Chernenko.
He has now met Gorbachev more than 10 times.
   U.S. leaders also have shuttled through Helsinki numerous times
since Gorbachev came to power. In May 1988, President Reagan paid
his respects to Finnish diplomacy in a speech at Finlandia Hall,
the site of the signing of the Helsinki Final Act.
   ``America respects Finland's neutrality ... and we salute the
creative statesmanship that has been Finland's gift to world
peace,'' Reagan said before meeting Gorbachev in the Soviet capital.
   During a three-day state visit in October 1989, Gorbachev also
made a long-awaited gesture by acknowledging Finnish neutrality
more explicitly than any Soviet leader before.
   But Finland's position has not alway been understood by the rest
of the world.
   After 100 years of Russian rule and two bitter wars against the
Soviet Union from 1939-44, Finland adopted a cautious, neutral
foreign policy that is now being held up as a model by reformers in
the Baltic states and others in the Soviet sphere.
   That policy, sometimes derogatorily called ``Finlandization'' to
indicate subservience to a larger power, is now paying off.
   Finland retained its independence unlike its southern neighbors
_ Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania _ which the Soviet Union annexed in
1940.
   Finland is the only nation to have soldiers in all U.N.
peacekeeping duties worldwide and has contributed the most troops
overall.

   Whatever the agenda, the specter of next
weekend's snap U.S.-Soviet summit underscores the isolation of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and serves as a dramatic diplomatic
move that could bring the Soviet Union deeper into the embrace of
the non-communist world.
   ``We have many matters to discuss,'' President Bush told
reporters in Maine. He held out hope for agreement with Mikhail
Gorbachev on a long-awaited conventional forces treaty to cover
troop and tank reductions in Europe.
   Bush sought to dampen expectations that the meeting could
somehow break the hostile impasse in the Middle East. He put the
Gulf crisis somewhere in the discussions but not necessarily at the
center.
   Be that as it may, there's something in Helsinki for everyone
among the nations involved in the Middle East face-off, with the
notable exception of Saddam Hussein.
   _For Bush, it is a key step in sealing the remarkable
international coalition that has developed to reverse Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait and protect the Middle Eastern oil fields from
Iraqi piracy.
   The meeting would restore an element of the post-Cold War amity
that had been rolling across the globe before Iraq sent its tanks
into Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   _For Gorbachev, still struggling to tame the Soviet economy and
the restless Soviet republics, it provides a spectacular stage to
practice the safer craft of foreign diplomacy. In his continuing
bid for Western aid, he can send a signal that Moscow can be a
reliable partner in crisis management.
   There were reports from Amman that Moscow might mediate the
withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. Before the invasion of Kuwait,
Moscow was a longstanding ally of Saddam, providing Iraq with its
most sophisticated weaponry, and military advisers to make it work.
Bush seemed to dismiss that out of hand. ``I don't see a mediating
role at all'' for Moscow, he said.
   Gorbachev is leery of the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia
and presumedly would relish an agreement that would return
everyone's military to their own borders. It can't make Red Army
generals happy to see U.S. troops deployed side-by-side Arab troops
in the Saudi desert.
   Whatever role Gorbachev may play, his role in the anti-Iraq
coalition is a far cry from the Brezhnev era, when the Soviets
began large-scale military support for Saddam and could be counted
on to blast any American-led military or diplomatic initiative.
   _For Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and other Arab nations involved
in the anti-Iraq effort, Soviet participation provides cover from
criticism that they are too willing to do American bidding. Soviet
acquiescence in the anti-Iraq effort has been important all along,
but the fact is that Gorbachev himself has pretty much kept his
distance.
   In the midst of the military crisis in the Gulf, Bush said
Thursday that events in the Middle East might lead to a new
post-Cold War world order. He might have been referring to hopes to
keep intact the anti-Iraq alliance that includes almost all the
states of the United Nations _ including nations that have been
enemies for years.
   _For James A. Baker III it promises a sort of resurrection. He's
been on vacation while national security adviser Brent Scowcroft
and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney took center stage on U.S. policy
in the gulf crisis.
   But a distinct success has slowly emerged from this crisis _ the
diplomatic efforts to forge an international opposition to Iraq _
and vacation or not, Baker has to have been a central figure.
   Senior U.S. officials said only Baker and Scowcroft worked on
the Bush-Gorbachev meeting.
   Asked why Bush and Gorbachev would get together, Scowcroft said:
   ``A lot has happened since the two of them met before (in
Washington in May and June), not only in the Persian Gulf,'' he
said. He mentioned Cambodia and Afghanistan and added, ``There is
no lack of things for the two of them to talk about.''
   Notably, there is arms control. In fact, two big treaties
continue to wave in the winds _ the conventional forces (CFE)
agreement for Europe and a pact that would cut back strategic
nuclear missile levels.
   ``We've just set these meetings up, and the way I described it
from our side to him (Gorbachev) was that ... we'd have no agenda,
and that it would be free-flowing discussions.
   ``But I know that we'll have discussions of -- as I mentioned,
CFE, and a CFE agreement.''

   An emotionally troubled University of
Florida freshman under scrutiny in the grisly murders of five
college students had a strong attraction for one of the slain
women, a former neighbor said.
   Edward Lewis Humphrey, who was arrested Thursday for beating his
grandmother but is a suspect in the murders, lived briefly this
summer at the Gatorwood apartments, where the bodies of Tracy
Paules, 23 and her roommate Manuel Taboada, 23, were found.
   Humphrey had a ``major crush on Tracy,'' said Rachel Olivier,
22, who also lived at the apartments. ``He'd fall over himself to
be near her or to help her. He'd go and sit by the pool and watch
when she'd come out.''
   Humphrey also lived for a short time at Tolbert Hall, a
dormitory where victim Christina Powell, 17, lived during summer
school.
   The other stabbing victims were 18-year-old Sonja Larsen, and
Christa Hoyt, 18. Four of the victims were students at the
University of Florida, Taboada at Santa Fe Community College.
   Humphrey, 18, of Indialantic, ``continues to be a very good
suspect for the moment,'' said police spokeswoman Lt. Sadie
Darnell. But ``we have other good suspects,'' about a dozen in all,
she said.
   Darnell cautioned that the killings might not all be linked to a
single suspect. The killer may still be at large, she said, and
people should remain on guard.
   ``We cannot say the killing is over. We don't know. We don't
have anyone in custody for the murders,'' she said.
   Among other suspects, she mentioned Warren Virgil Tinch, 58, an
Ohio fugitive wanted for the mutilation stabbing death of a woman
in that state. Someone matching his general description stole cars
in Gainesville and Ocala a week before the murders.
   Humphrey remained jailed Saturday in Brevard County, central
Florida, on $1 million bond on a charge of assaulting his
79-year-old grandmother. Authorities have interrogated him at
length about the Gainesville murders and taken blood samples, but
no additional charges have been filed.
   Brevard County Sheriff Jake Miller and neighbors described
Humphrey as a troubled youth who suffered an auto accident two
years ago in which he fell or threw himself from a car moving at
over 60 mph.
   He has been taking the mood-stabilizing drug lithium, said Randy
Moore, chief felony attorney with the Brevard County public
defender's office, which is representing Humphrey. Lithium is often
used to treat schizophrenics.
   ``I think there is a question about his sanity,'' Moore said.
``He acts like he is out of it.''
   Both prosecutors and Moore's office have said they likely would
seek a psychological evaluation of Humphrey this week.
   Police sealed off the youth's Gainesville apartment and
questioned anyone entering the complex. But Darnell said no attempt
has been made to obtain a search warrant and examine the apartment
itself _ a move that would require investigators to convince a
judge there was good reason to suspect Humphrey.
   ``That would be the normal course of any investigation, and we
have not reached that point yet,'' she said.
   Most of the University of Florida's 34,000 students took
advantage of the long Labor Day weekend to head for the beach or
home, said school spokesman Larry Humes.
   Between Top 40 hits, radio stations kept broadcasting the latest
news on the killings and urged people ``to have a fun Labor Day _
but also a safe one.'' One station asked people to tie white
ribbons in front of their homes to remember the dead.

<HEAD>California Lawmakers Reject Early Presidential Primary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HOWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California lawmakers rejected a
proposal to move up California's presidential primary from June to
March after stumbling over the issue of whether the primary ballot
should be stripped of voter initiatives.
   The planned shift would have put California's primary in the
first week of March, hard on the heels of the Iowa caucuses and the
New Hampshire primary. It failed to go to a vote late Friday when
Assembly members rejected a constitutional amendment that would
have stripped all other ballot measures from the presidential
primary ballot.
   A fragile compromise worked out by supporters of the early
primary depended on legislative approval of both the amendment and
the main bill, but it fell apart just hours before the end of the
1990 legislative session.
   ``They may try to bring it back next year, but I doubt it,''
said Sen. Ken Maddy, the Senate's GOP Leader and the author of the
proposed amendment. ``Frankly, I don't see a groundswell of support
for it except from some insiders and political reporters.''
   Supporters say the shift would change the California election
from an afterthought into the nation's dominant early primary.
   Now one of the latest in the nation, the California primary
hasn't had a real impact on a presidential nomination race since
1972, when George McGovern's victory here cleared the way for his
Democratic nomination.
   The early primary proposal would have left a separate primary
for congressional, legislative and other races in June. But under
California's constitution, voter initiatives that were ready would
have to go on the same ballot as the presidential primary.
   Both parties were concerned that a one-sided primary, or one
that drew especially strong voter interest for one party, could
skew the results of ballot proposals.
   Since initiatives in recent years have included major issues
like the Proposition 13 property tax cuts, a cigarette tax hike and
major insurance, education and environmental measures, that raised
the possibility of major policy issues being decided principally by
voters of only one party.
   To avoid that, Maddy tied the early primary bill to enactment of
a constitutional amendment that would bar initiatives from the
presidential primary ballot.
   But while the early primary bill required only a simple majority
vote of the Senate and Assembly, Maddy's constitutional amendment
required a two-thirds majority.
   After several Assembly roll calls, the vote for Maddy's bill was
47 to 25, seven short of the required majority in the 80-seat lower
house.
   Maddy said lawmakers were unsure about the effects of moving to
a March primary. Even if his amendment had passed the lower house,
Maddy said, the Assembly may have wanted to sit on the bill until
next year.
   The early primary proposal faced stiff opposition in the Senate,
where the Democratic leader, President Pro Tem David Roberti of Los
Angeles, opposed Madden's constitutional amendment.
   ``The problem is what to do with the initiatives,'' Roberti
said. He said he prefer leaving them on the ballot in March and
November ``because that's when we will have the biggest turnout.''

   Canadian troops backed by armored vehicles
and helicopters Saturday swept into a Mohawk community where armed
Indians and authorities have stared at each other across barricades
for 53 days.
   Gen. Armand Roy, commander of the Canadian Forces 5th Brigade,
said he decided to send in his troops after two Mohawk men were
wounded in factional fighting behind Indian barricades set up in a
land dispute with government officials.
   ``I decided to move my troops so as to guarantee the security of
civilians and my soldiers,'' Roy said.
   The military action came after efforts failed to reach a
negotiated settlement in the dispute. The Mohawks have been trying
to block a golf course extension on land they claim is theirs, but
they have also raised other grievances.
   One shot was fired into the air by a Mohawk after the troops
moved in, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. said. But there were no
reports of casualties.
   Defiant Indian militants stood their ground and screamed at
Canadian soldiers to get away as troops pushed to within 100 yards
of the Mohawks' main barricade Saturday afternoon.
   The troops moved into an area where the army had estimated at
least 50 armed members of the militant Mohawk Warrior's Society
were located.
   Later in the evening, Lt.-Col. Pierre Daigle said the army was
digging in for the night around two other barricades.
   ``I'm willing to die for this,'' one Warrior screamed at a
soldier approaching the main barricade. ``Are you ready to die? But
before I die, I'm going to take out 50 of you. ...''
   Ellen Gabriel, a Mohawk negotiator, denounced the army action as
illegal. She said some Mohawk children had been caught in the path
of the advancing troops.
   ``The army move was so fast they didn't have a chance to get the
children out ...,'' she said in a radio interview from behind the
barricades at the settlement.
   Journalists were not being allowed into the Kahnesatake Indian
settlement overlooking the village of Oka, 18 miles west of
Montreal.
   The troops, backed by provincial police, had also surrounded the
Mohawk community center, where about 75 Indian civilians were
gathered. The center has been used to house a food bank run by the
Indians.
   Provincial authorities Monday had given the military the
go-ahead to end the armed standoff that began July 11, when the
Quebec provincial police attempted to storm a Mohawk barricade at
Oka. One officer was killed, but it is still not clear by whose
gunfire.
   Later that day, fellow Mohawks set up a blockade in sympathy at
the Mercier bridge, a major link between Montreal and its southern
suburbs.
   The ostensible reason for the Mohawk uprising _ expansion of the
golf course _ was settled when the federal government purchased the
land and said it would turn it over to the Indians. But militants
seized the situation to publicize a much wider range of Indian
grievances against the government, including demands for
sovereignty.
   Quebec provincial police identified the two wounded Mohawks as
Chief Francis Jacob and his son Corey.
   The two were severely beaten with baseball bats by four or five
members of the Warrior's Society early Saturday morning, police
said. Jacob, who had two black eyes, and his son were later
released from the hospital.
   Dan David, a journalist who lives in the Mohawk settlement, said
the factional fighting was sparked by an incident Friday evening in
which several masked Warriors ransacked and looted the home of
veterinarian Rejean Mongeon.
   He said some members of the Warrior's Society took offense after
moderate Mohawks were quoted in the media as denouncing the attack
on Mongeon's home.
   The militant Warrior's Society has been vying with elected
native officials for authority within the Mohawk community.
   On Friday, Mohawks from the Kanewake reserve south of Montreal
allowed troops to remove the main barricades they had set up on
routes leading to the Mercier bridge. Quebec Transport Department
officials said it would take several days before the bridge can be
reopened to traffic.
   The bridge blockade has forced thousands of commuters on the
south shore of the St. Lawrence River to make long detours to
Montreal, which is on an island. Angry residents have protested and
thrown rocks at Mohawks.

   About 200 white supremacists gathered in northeast Georgia
Saturday, and a SWAT team broke up a smaller Ku Klux Klan rally in
Louisiana that drew vocal opposition.
   In Lawrenceville, Ga., 200 people rallied at the old Gwinnett
County Courthouse, where Klansman Shade Miller last year was
arrested in a one-man protest of the state's 1951 law prohibiting
wearing a mask in public.
   Klan leaders said this year's rally in part was a celebration of
the state's decision not to enforce the mask law, which a state
judge ruled unconstitutional after Miller's arrest. An appeal to
the state Supreme Court is pending.
   About 40 marchers wore traditional Klan robes and open-faced
hoods and 15 concealed their faces with masks attached to the hoods.
   About 100 Klan members and white supremacists marched also
through Gainesville, Ga., about 30 miles way, carrying a banner
reading ``Stop Colored Immigration.'
   Meanwhile, in Shreveport, La., the Caddo Parish Sheriff's
Department SWAT team stepped between robed Klan members and about
40 opponents when a shouting match threatened to escalate into
violence.
   A crowd including blacks and whites jeered as J.W. Farrands, an
imperial wizard from Sanford, N.C., led 16 other Klan members to
the Caddo Parish courthouse, where he spoke to about 40 supporters.
   David Duke, a former Klan leader and state senator who is
running for the U.S. Senate, was not mentioned at the rally.
   Thomas Cochran, head of Duke's campaign office in Shreveport,
said Duke supporters asked the Klan not to march ``because any
imbecile knows that's not good for our campaign.''

<TEXT>
   The caretaker government will file
corruption charges against ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
this week, an official said Saturday.
   Ms. Bhutto was dismissed Aug. 6 by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.
He accused the 37-year-old prime minister of corruption,
incompetence, and abuse of power during her 20 months in power. Ms.
Bhutto and leaders of her Pakistan Peopel's Party deny the charges.
   ``The corruption charges will be based on solid material that
can be proved in a court of law,'' said Interior Minister Zahid
Sarfraz at a news conference. ``These cases will prove how blatant
the corruption was and how large was it magnitude.''
   Mrs. Bhutto has called her opponents ``a bunch of crooks.''
   She also said Ishaq Khan acted at the behest of the armed
forces. She had been at odds with the military over policy and
personnel appointments since she took office on Dec. 2, 1988.
   High court judges will try the corruption case against Mrs.
Bhutto and others in her government, and convicted politicians will
be banned from participating in the elections set for Oct. 24.
   Ms. Bhutto and her supporters have threatened to boycott the
polls if she is barred from the contest.
   ``No one should fear the special courts, as these will providee
everyone an opportunity to prove his or her innocence,'' Sarfraz
said.
   ``But in case some one refuses to appear in the courts or
boycotts the polls, the election and the democratic process will go
on unhindered,'' he said. ``The democratic process cannot stop if
it does not suit a particular leader or a party.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Election officials Saturday
postponed general elections that had been planned for November,
delaying efforts to bring democracy to Haiti.
   A statement by the independent Electoral Council said the Nov. 4
election date was ``washed up.'' It cited a shortage of money and
equipment.
   The council did not set a new election date but said it would be
held in time to inaugurate a president by the Feb. 7, 1991. That
date, previously planned for the inauguration, will be the fifth
anniversary of the flight of dictator Jean Claude Duvalier.
   ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier, son of Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier,
was swept from power in a popular uprising and fled to France in
Feb. 1986. His father ruled from 1957.
   The statement said the opening date for a three-week
voter-registration period had been moved from Sept. 3 to Oct. 5 due
to lack of funds and materials. The statement was signed by Council
president Jean-Robert Sabalat.
   The last attempt at free elections in Haiti in 1987 collapsed
when thugs supported by the army killed at least 34 voters.
   ``We have already set up the district bureaus and most local
bureaus. But we cannot begin registration insufficiently
prepared,'' Electoral Council member Emmanuel Ambroise said. ``The
Nov. 4 date for elections is just impossible.''
   Many of the 12,000 registration bureaus have not been set up.
   The council has said that it has only received $400,000 of the
$2.6 million it needs to complete registration.
   In past statements, the council has said it would call off the
election if not enough people register to give credibility to the
next regime.
   Electoral Council executive secretary Patrick Tardieu said the
postponement had nothing to do with a standoff between President
Ertha Pascal-Trouillot and the Council of State, which governs with
her.
   On Thursday, the Council of State asked election officials not
``to rush headlong into elections,'' saying minimal security
conditions had not been established by the executive branch.
   On Aug. 14, the Council of State broke off relations with Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot because of alleged abuse of power and refusal to
satisfy demands for administrative reform, law and order, and
economic relief.
   Seven of the 12 political parties that appointed Mrs.
Pascal-Trouillot provisional president in March have called for her
resignation. They have asked the Electoral Council to postpone
registration until the conflict has been solved.
   On Sept. 11, the United Nations will consider a Haitian
government request for technical and security assistance for
elections, including supervision of voter registration and
balloting.

   Columbia's astronomy mission is off
until late this week so NASA can fix a link to one of the
telescopes aboard the shuttle.
   The space agency had hoped to launch Columbia and its $150
million Astro observatory as early as Wednesday, but engineers
determined Saturday that the problem could not be corrected as
easily as hoped and said the earliest date would be Thursday.
   The communication problem between Astro's X-ray telescope and
launch control was the latest in a series of flaws that have dogged
NASA for months.
   NASA has not launched a shuttle since April, when Discovery
carried the flawed Hubble Space Telescope into orbit. That is the
largest gap between flights since after the 1986 Challenger
accident.
   At NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.,
scientists have been working to control the errant Magellan
spacecraft, in orbit around Venus. Commands were radioed across the
solar system Saturday to improve control of the Magellan, which has
suffered two long communications blackouts.
   At Cape Canaveral, NASA officials said the latest Columbia delay
was not viewed as serious.
   ``One day is not going to make that much of a difference to the
team. It's not the first time it's happened,'' said Lisa Malone,
spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``There's always a chance you're going to have some kind of
delay, whether it's weather or something on the orbiter or
something on the payload, which is what we have here,'' she said.
   The countdown for a Saturday liftoff was halted Thursday night
after contact was lost with Astro's X-ray telescope. Workers
entered the cargo bay Friday to examine a unit linking the
instrument with the orbiter and launch controllers.
   Controllers need to be in constant touch with the X-ray
telescope before launch to monitor the pressure and temperature of
argon, a chemical used to keep the scientific instruments cool.
   Engineers decided Saturday they could not restore communications
by installing a new cable in the unit, a sort of electronic box,
but would try replacing a component inside the box that channels
signals between the telescope and launch control. If that doesn't
work, the whole box will be replaced.
   Workers on Saturday also replaced an instrument that measures
acceleration and vibration. The instrument failed to activate
properly during the countdown.
   Four of the crew members are astronomers who will operate
Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes during the nine- to 10-day
flight, probing some of the hottest objects in the universe. The
X-ray telescope will be managed by ground controllers. The
observatory will remain aboard the shuttle.
   The Astro mission was first scheduled for March 1986, but the
Challenger disaster two months earlier put the flight and all
others on hold.
   After a series of minor delays, the mission was rescheduled for
May 30. Excessive amounts of hydrogen leaked during fueling,
however, and the flight was called off.
   Another shuttle, Atlantis, was found to have similar leaks a
month later, prompting NASA to ground the entire three-shuttle
fleet. New fuel lines were installed in Columbia, and the shuttle
was moved back to the launch pad last month. Atlantis' launch has
been rescheduled for November.
   Columbia must lift off before Sept. 14 or will have to wait
until after Discovery's flight in October with the sun-probing
Ulysses satellite.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Saturday
rebuked Iraq for its occupation of Kuwait, but said military action
by U.S.-led forces could bring ``more evil'' to the Persian Gulf.
   ``Everything possible must be done to avoid a bellicose
solution,'' the pope told reporters on a flight from Rome to
Tanzania at the start of a 10-day African tour.
   The pontiff said Kuwait's existence and rights ``must be
respected.''
   In other comments in Tanzania, the pontiff opened his seventh
trip to Africa by urging the world community to help solve two of
the continent's gravest problems: AIDS and the crush of refugees.
   ``The life-giving functions of human sexuality, and the blood
which epitomizes health and life itself, have become a roadway to
death,'' he said.
   In his remarks on the gulf crisis, the pope expressed concern
about the possibility the United States and its allies might resort
to armed confrontation against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
whose troops invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   ``Naturally every war creates worry in its various aspects,''
the pope said.
   ``Many things in history have been resolved through war. But on
the other hand, war brings with it more violations of human rights
and more evil than good or solutions.''
   The pope would not say whether the Vatican would formally
condemn a military strike against Iraq.
   The pontiff encouraged a diplomatic settlement, citing the
United Nations as the best forum.
   ``We try not to lose hope. We pray for this and there are talks
going on about this,'' he said.
   ``It would be reasonable for the Iraqis to understand this
approach by the international community and to collaborate,'' said
the pope, who noted there are no plans or proposals for the Vatican
to act as a mediator in the crisis.
   Last Sunday, in his first direct public comments on the gulf
crisis, the pope decried the ``grave violations of human rights and
of the U.N. charter.'' He did not mention Iraq by name.
   In his other remarks, the pope called for a global effort to
wipe out AIDS. But he also made clear the church rejects the use of
condoms as a means of checking the spread of the deadly disease.
   In a speech to diplomats, John Paul described AIDS as a
``terrible evil'' which threatens all of humanity.
   ``The AIDS epidemic calls for a supreme effort of international
cooperation on the part of governments, the world medical and
scientific community, and all those who exercise influence in
developing a sense of moral responsibility in society,'' the pope
said.
   He warned that the AIDS crisis could be aggravated by
indifference, discrimination against AIDS sufferers, and rivalries
among scientists seeking a cure.
   John Paul also directed his attention to the plight of Africa's
millions of refugees.
   Most are ``innocent victims of ethnic conflict, power struggles
or failed development policies,'' he said. ``The situation cries
out for urgent intervention on the part of the international
community.''
   The pope will spend five days in Tanzania before traveling to
the tiny neighboring countries of Burundi and Rwanda. He ends his
tour Sept. 10 in the Ivory Coast.

<HEAD>Court Refuses to Order EPA to Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday refused to
order the Environmental Protection Agency to install new curbs on
the precursors of acid rain to benefit Canada.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
said the EAP could study the issue further.
   The case could be close to moot, since Congress is expected to
order new measures against the precursors of acid rain _ chiefly
sulfur and nitroggen oxides emitted by utility and other
smokestacks _ in revisions to the Clean Air Act expected to pass
this fall. The United States and Canada have begun negotiations on
a treaty to deal with the issue.
   Half of acid rain falling in eastern Canada originates in the
United States, much of that from the industrial areas of the
Midwest and central Atlantic states.
   The province of Quebec sued EPA more than two years ago in an
attempt to force the EPA to act. Canada contents that 14,000 of its
lakes are endangered by acid rain, which can turn lakes in
sensitive soil areas so acidic that no fish can live.
   Just before President Reagan took office, outgoing EPA
administrator Douglas Costle wrote Secretary of State Edmund Muskie
that the U.S. pollution in question was harming Canada.
   Quebec, supported by New Brunswick, Ontario, nine northeastern
U.S. states and several environmental groups, argued in court that
Costle's letter constituted a determination under U.S. law that
required action against offending pollution sources.
   The U.S. environmental agency countered that it was not trying
to stall a pollution cleanup, but needed more time to identify
specific remedial actions and sources.
   A three-judge panel of the appeals court agreed, and said the
agency had the right to wait until the completion of a massive
scientific study on acid rain commissioned by Congress 10 years
ago. The hundreds of scientists involved in the study are expected
to release their final report in December.
   ``The EPA's delay in action on the (plaintiff's) petitions has
been neither arbitrary, nor capricious, nor contrary to law,'' the
court said in its ruling.
   In U.S. federal administrative law, courts generally may
overturn decisions in an agency's area of expertise only if those
decisions can be shown to be arbitrary, capricious or otherwise
contrary to law.

   The 3,600 black soldiers who endured
frostbite, mosquitoes and the unsetting summer sun to build the
Alaska Highway nearly 50 years ago also were never recognized for
their work, two professors say.
   Now a reunion is being organized for the soldiers _ who made up
about a third of the force that built the highway _ and it will
take place in the far gentler Florida clime.
   ``We're going to try to have a conference here so that all those
black troops that want to stay warm and be comfortable instead of
going to Alaska (can) celebrate their part of the construction,''
said James N. Eaton, curator of the Black Archives Research Center
and Museum at Florida A&amp;M University.
   But first Eaton and Lael Morgan, a journalism professor at the
University of Alaska in Fairbanks who contacted Eaton for help,
have to find the soldiers, who were ignored in accounts of the
highway's construction.
   They've put the word out through military and construction
magazines and black newspapers, and interviewed their first two
veterans Thursday.
   ``I think that it's a very interesting project,'' Alexander
Powell, one of the two vets, told reporters Friday. ``Maybe we'll
get our due recognition.''
   Powell, a soft-spoken 68-year-old man born and raised in Quincy
just west of Tallahassee, was shipped to Alaska in April 1942.
   Before the Army transferred him to the South Pacific 16 months
later, he had lived with winter temperatures that dropped to 70
degrees below zero, a summer sun that never set, mosquitoes, black
bears, almost no recreation and a lot of hard work.
   But he was chuckling as he talked about his part in building the
road.
   ``It was a nice healthy country,'' Powell said. ``I didn't have
a cold, the sniffles or anything while I was up there.''
   Other soldiers weren't so lucky. Most units reportedly lost at
least one or two soldiers, Morgan said.
   ``With all that cold, it would come back up to 30 or 35 below
(and) it would actually feel warm to you then,'' Powell said.
   Morgan has been researching the eight-month construction of the
1,200-mile Alaska Highway for two years. She said she was amazed to
learn that about a third of the 10,000 soldiers who built the
highway, which is still the only road that links Alaska to the rest
of the United States, were black.
   ``You go through all the souvenir books of the Alaska Highway
and all the old news clippings, you never see a single black
face,'' Morgan said. ``Nor did any historian know the whereabouts
of any of these people. So I started looking.''
   She turned for help to Eaton because many of the black soldiers
were believed to have come from Florida and south Georgia and
because of the reputation of the archives at Florida A&amp;M, the
state's only historically black public university.
   Eaton said they'd like to hold a reunion at the school in late
1991 so that it can be taped and taken to Alaska for the 50th
anniversary. He and Morgan also want to make a traveling exhibit of
photographs and memorabilia.

   A suburban Chicago couple were charged with
beating their two children to death while disciplining them and
hiding the bodies in a steamer trunk for much of the last four
years, police said Friday.
   Sheila Jones, 24, and Andre Jones, 27, of Riverdale each were
charged with two counts of murder and two counts of concealing a
homicidal death, said Dan McCullough, a spokesman for the Cook
County state's attorney's office.
   Ms. Jones walked into a police station Thursday night and told
detectives where the children could be found, said Chicago police
Cmdr. Robert Beavers. Police seized the trunk containing the bodies
of Luther Magee, 2, and Jessica Wilkens, 1.
   ``The mother decided it was too much of a burden to handle,''
Beavers said.
   ``It was a continuing series of abuses. The kids got weaker and
weaker and weaker until they both just expired. He said they were
undisciplined and unruly children, and he was trying to discipline
them, and the mother said the same thing,'' Beavers said.
   Both the children's stepfather and their mother confessed to the
killings, Beavers said. The couple were being held until a bail
hearing Saturday.
   The bodies were discovered sealed in black plastic bags locked
in a trunk, Beavers said.
   Initially, the children were wrapped in a blanket and hidden in
the trunk of the couple's car, the parents told police. After a
year, the smell became overpowering and the parents decided to wrap
the bodies in plastic and store them in the steamer trunk, he said.
   The couple told police Luther died on Nov. 13, 1986, and Jessica
on Nov. 27 of the same year, Beavers said.

   Three animal rights protesters, dressed

the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus after chaining
themselves to a high-wire support rope.
   Circus workers used bolt cutters to snip the protesters' chains
Thursday night. The clowns were taken to the San Mateo county jail
and booked on charges of trespassing, disturbing the peace and
conspiracy, police said.
   Those arrested at the Cow Palace were identified as Alden
McElrath, 41, of Oakland; Lillian Carswell, 21, of Berkeley; and
Damien Pierce, 26, of Albany.
   The disruption of the circus, shortly after intermission of the
opening night performance, was brief.
   Before the performance, members of animal rights groups
demonstrated outside the arena and passed out leaflets accusing the
circus of animal abuse.

   The company said it is recalling 16-ounce cans of French Style
green beans shipped in July to 140 Pathmark food stores in eastern
Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Delaware, New Jersey and the New York
City metropolitan area.
   The cans have a one-line code 0201J6F82 printed on their bottom
end.
   Pathmark has already removed from its shelves all recalled cans
it still has, Del Monte officials said.
   Del Monte said it has received no reports of illness from people
who may have eaten the product. Harmful bacteria could grow in the
uncooked beans.
   The San Francisco-based company said consumers who bought the
beans should return them to the place of purchase.

   The leader of a religious cult, facing
a possible death sentence for murdering a family of five, lost an
appeal Friday for a jailhouse visit with his wife.
   Lake County Common Pleas Court Judge Martin O. Parks, who
presided at the trial of Jeffrey Lundgren, 40, ruled against the
request filed on behalf of Lundgren by his attorneys. He gave no
explanation for his decision.
   Lundgren's wife, Alice Lundgren, 39, is serving a life prison
term for complicity to commit aggravated murder and kidnapping. She
claimed during the trial that she was afraid of defying her husband.
   Lundgren was convicted Wednesday of five counts of aggravated
murder and kidnapping in the April 17, 1989, deaths of Dennis and
Cheryl Avery and their three daughters. The jury will reconvene
Sept. 17 to decide whether to recommend the death penalty.
   Lundgren was a lay minister for the Reorganized Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter Day Saints who was defrocked and formed his own
sect.
   The Averys were killed in what Lundgren described to
church-members as a cleansing ritual.

   Mayor Brian O'Toole faces a maximum of eight years in prison for
lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under 14. Sentencing was
scheduled for Dec. 5. Officials said he could get probation.
   O'Toole, out on $5,000 bail, is accused of molesting the boy
from the time the youth was 9 until he was 13. The boy is now 15.
   The Sunnyvale City Council has 120 days to call a special
election to replace the mayor after officially declaring the seat
vacant, according to the city charter. It's too late for the
election to be put on the November general election ballot, however.
   Vice Mayor Richard Napier has provisionally taken over the
mayor's duties in this city of 106,000 people near San Jose.

   Harris Corp. and two executives of its digital
telephone division were indicted Friday on charges of conspiring to
pay bribes to Colombian officials for help obtaining government
telecommunications contracts.
   Harris Corp., which makes telephone switching equipment at its
Digital Telephone Systems division in Novato, Calif., was named in
the five-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in San
Francisco.
   The indictment also charged John D. Iacobucci, vice president
and general manager of Digital Telephone Systems, and Ronald L.
Schultz, the division's human relations director, with violating
the bribery provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
   In a statement issued at its Melbourne, Fla., headquarters, the
company denied the allegations and said the two employees were
innocent.
   The indictment charged that in 1989 the Iacobucci hired New York
consultant Robert D. O'Hara to pay a member of Colombia's national
legislature for help getting a telecommunications contract.
   According to the indictment, DTS paid O'Hara $22,835 with the
understanding that some of the money would be used to pay bribes.
   Iacobucci an Schultz are accused of preparing false invoices to
disguise the fact that some of the money would be used by O'Hara to
pay bribes.
   O'Hara, named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the indictment,
represented himself as having connections with Colombian officials,
the indictment said.
   The indictment charged that Iacobucci agreed to pay money to a
Colombian legislator in return for help obtaining contracts.
   The member of the the Camara de Representantes that Harris Corp.
sought to influence was not identified. But the indictment charged
that the company and Iacobucci agreed to pay a commission to a
local Colombian firm partly owned by the official if Harris
obtained a contract.
   The commission would be equal to 5 percent of any contracts
Harris obtained from Telecom, the government-owned company that
operates international and long distance telephone services in
Colombia, according to the indictment.
   If convicted Harris Corp. could be fined up to $9 million. The
charges against Iacobucci and Schultz each carry maximum prison
terms of 30 years and fines of up to $1.55 million.
   ``We believe that these charges are based upon a distorted view
of the facts, and they represent a radical departure from existing
enforcement policies,'' said the Harris statement in the name of
John T. Hartley, chairman and chief executive.
   ``We have cooperated fuly with the Justice Department in its
investigation of the allegations, providing clear evidence refuting
the charges.''

   Some of the thousands of condoms
distributed in a student newspaper at the University of Arkansas
prior to spring break may be defective, the newspaper says.
   Safetex Corp., which provided the condoms, is recalling the
Saxon Ultra-Thin variety latex condoms it distributed between June
1989 and July 1990. The variety was among three provided free with
a special issue of the newspaper on Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome published March 14.
   Steve Wilkes, editor of the Arkansas Traveler, said a letter
from Safetex stated that condoms from one inventory lot given to
the student newspaper ``may have been below government standards.''
   The condoms were glued to a piece of paper in a special edition
of the newspaper, along with a note that read ``The Arkansas
Traveler asks you to have a safe spring break. This could save your
life. Please be careful. Condoms donated by the Safetex Corporation
Lyndhurst, N.J. You can purchase these condoms at your local drug
store.''
   The standard implemented by the Federal Drug Administration
allows only four failures of out 1,000, according to the letter
with the recall notice. Wilkes said the condoms in the lot failed
more often than that. He did not say how often they failed.
   The newspaper reported the recall in its Thursday edition.
   Safetex President Kiyohide Okuyama said in a telephone interview
that the company wanted the condoms returned. But when told how
they'd been distributed, he said, ``In that case, it's probably
impossible to get them back.''

<TEXT>
   Peruvian writer and politician Mario Vargas
Llosa said Mexico, ruled by one party for 60 years, is ``the
perfect dictatorship,'' newspapers reported Friday.
   A spokesman for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party
claimed the novelist had ``lost touch with reality'' during his
years of residence in Paris.
   ``The perfect dictatorship is not communism, is not the Soviet
Union, is not Fidel Castro, it is Mexico,'' Vargas Llosa told a
conference of intellectuals Thursday evening in the Mexican capital.
   ``It is the dictatorship camouflaged in such a way that it can
seem not to be a dictatorship. But in fact it has ... all of the
characteristics of a dictatorship, not of a man but of a party,''
added Vargas Llosa.
   The novelist, who ran a strong but unsuccessful race this year
for the presidency of Peru, was referring to the party that has
ruled Mexico since 1929.
   He said the party was ``immovable, a party which concedes enough
space to criticism on the level at which that criticism serves it,
because it confirms it is a democratic party.''
   But Vargas Llosa said the party suppresses ``that criticism
which in some way endangers its permanence.''
   His remarks were carried by the government's Notimex news
agency, as well as by several leading Mexico City dailies.
   The conservative El Heraldo and the leftist La Jornada carried
the story on the front page.
   The government's El Nacional included the remarks in the fourth
column of a story on page 16 of its arts and culture insert.
   Vargas Llosa said that the ruling party's leftist rhetoric,
stemming from the 1910-1920 revolution, was the most efficient in
Latin America at recruiting intellectuals, but he said Mexico's
suffered from the same social injustices as most countries in the
region.
   Later Friday, the party's secretary for international affairs,
Romeo Flores Caballero, ripped back at Vargas Llosa in a statement
carried by the independent Excelsior news agency.
   The official said Vargas Llosa had lived in Paris so long he had
lost touch with his own country's history, as well as Mexico.
   ``If he knew the history, he would have won in the recent
elections in Peru,'' Flores said.
   The agency quoted another party official, parliamentary deputy
Augusto Gomez Villanueva, as claiming Vargas Llosa was seeking
notoriety because of his failure in the Peruvian elections.

   The state Supreme Court has blocked the
release of tape-recorded conversations between a psychotherapist
and two Beverly Hills brothers charged with murdering their wealthy
parents.
   Erik Menendez, 19, and Joseph Lyle Menendez, 22, are accused of
the August 1989 shotgun slayings of Jose Menedez, 45, and Mary
Kitty Menendez, 44.
   Recordings of the brothers' October and November 1989 sessions
with psychologist L. Jerome Oziel were to have been released to
prosecutors and the public Sept. 4. But on Thursday, the court
ordered the tapes sealed until it decides whether to grant a
hearing on the disclosure issue, a decision that could take three
months.
   Prosecutors want to use statements in the tapes as evidence
against the brothers, who have denied the murders.
   Conversations between patients and therapists during treatment
normally are confidential but can be disclosed in some
circumstances when a patient has threatened another person.
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Albrecht ruled Aug. 6
that the tapes could be released because Oziel had concluded that
the brothers were dangerous to himself and two other people to whom
the therapist had disclosed the brothers' statements.
   Lawyers for the brothers argued that Oziel's limited disclosures
had taken care of any danger that existed and that full disclosure
was not justified or authorized by law. After a state appeals court
let Albrecht's ruling stand, defense lawyers appealed to the
Supreme Court.

   Former defense consultant Mark Saunders
was sentenced to 21 months in prison and fined $5,000 Friday for
his role in funneling military procurement data to a defense
contractor.
   Saunders was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan
Jr. for his role in the Pentagon procurement scandal that is the
subject of a longrunning Justice Department investigation dubbed
``Operation Ill Wind.''
   The investigation has resulted in nearly 40 convictions of
Pentagan officials, consultants and executives of defense firms as
well as several corporations.
   In an unrelated case, the Justice Department announced Friday in
Washington that a subsidiary of Baltimore's Martin Marietta Corp.,
Martin Marietta Electronics and Missiles Group of Orlando, Fla.,
had paid an additional $2.56 million to settle allegations of
overcharges for government use of the firm's computers.
   The company earlier paid $898,000.
   Saunders, 56, was convicted June 5 of conspiracy to defraud the
government, wire fraud and conversion of government property.
   U.S. District Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. ordered that Saunders,
56, be placed on two years of supervised release after completing
the prison term.
   The former Navy procurement official who became a defense
consultant was convicted of participating in a scheme to funnel
secret Pentagon bid information to another defense consultant, who
sold it to Norden Systems, according to trial testimony.
   Saunders obtained the information from former Navy procurement
official George G. Stone, who pleaded guilty to participating in
the scheme, and passed it along to defense consultant Thomas E.
Muldoon.
   Muldoon then sold the bid information about the sophisticated
Marine Corps radar and communication system to Norden Systems, one
of several companies competing for the $100 million contract,
according to testimony.
   Three Norden executives have already pleaded guilty to taking
part in the operation.
   Muldoon, who was convicted last year of unrelated defense fraud
charges, was indicted along with Saunders. But the charges against
Muldoon were dismissed by a judge who ruled that prosecutors may
have indicted him as punishment for appealing the earlier ``Ill
Wind'' conviction.
   Stone testified that he kept Norden in the competition for the
contract at the request of Saunders. Norden dropped out of the
competition after the ``Ill Wind'' investigation became public two
years ago.

<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court upheld the
government's right to restrict payments of Supplemental Security
Income to aged and disabled people who have received overpayments
from other programs.
   By a 3-0 vote, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled a
decision by a San Francisco federal judge who threw out the
restrictions in nine Western states. The court agreed with four
other federal appeals courts that have upheld the same rules in the
last four years.
   The ruling stems from a suit that challenged rules passed by the
Reagan administration in 1982.
   Under those regulations, if an agency discovers it has overpaid
someone, it normally would seek to deduct the money from future
checks. Under the 1982 regulation, the amount of the monthly
deduction _ money the recipient is not actually getting _ is
counted as income in deciding whether the person is eligible for
Supplemental Security Income to the aged, blind or disabled.
   Velma Martin, a San Leandro railroad worker's widow who filed
the suit, had been collecting survivor's benefits from the Railroad
Retirement Board since 1978, and was told by the board in 1985 that
she had been overpaid more than $8,500 over four years because she
had failed to report additional income.
   Under its rules, the board said it was deducting Ms. Martin's
entire check of $268.14 a month for 34 months.
   Left with only her $386 monthly Social Security payment as
income, she applied for SSI benefits but was turned down because
the deducted $268.14 was counted as income, putting her over the
eligibility limit.
   Ms. Martin then sued and won a ruling by U.S. District Judge
Thelton Henderson that the 1982 eligibility rules violated federal
law.
   That law defines income as ``payments received'' in the form of
various benefits; Henderson said both the law's language and intent
required actual receipt of the money, and excluded money that was
being withheld.
   Henderson applied his ruling to the entire circuit _ California,
Arizona, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Montana, Alaska and
Hawaii, plus Guam and the Northern Marianas.
   But the appeals court disagreed with his reading of the law.
   Under Henderson's ruling, ``SSI funds will be used to partially
subsidize a claimant's debt to an outside program,'' said the
appellate opinion by Judge Cecil Poole.
   He said Congress would have made its intention clearer if it had
meant to put such a serious limitation on the government's ability
to define SSI applicants' income.
   Poole also said Ms. Martin and others whose overpayments came
from the Railroad Retirement Board could ask the board to spread
the repayment over a longer period by reducing the monthly
deductions.
   Regardless of that option, the restrictions cause hardships,
said Ms. Martin's lawyer, Gill Deford of the National Senior
Citizens Law Center.
   ``These are people who are receiving welfare benefits,'' he
said. ``If the amount is less than they're entitled to under
federal law, almost by definition it's working a hardship.''

   A man who sent a threatening letter to President
Bush and said he would ``punch his lights out'' if the president
visited the Northwest has been convicted on three counts and could
face up to 15 years in prison.
   Defense lawyer Robert Leen on Thursday chastized prosecutors for
trying 43-year-old Eugene Hains instead of ordering him to get
mental health treatment.
   Leen said Hains suffered post-tramautic stress syndrome after
serving in Vietnam and never intended to carry out the threats he
voiced in the letter and in a conversation with a Secret Service
agent.
   A federal jury convicted Hains Wednesday on two counts of
threatening the president and one count of sending a threatening
communication. He faces a maximum penalty of five years in prison
on each count, although the judge was expected to be lenient.
   Hains was upset over bills from an Anaheim, Calif., technical
school he briefly attended and said in a letter to Bush that he
would get a gun from Mexico and kill those responsible, according
to testimony.
   The letter prompted a visit from a Secret Service agent, whom
Hains told he would punch the president if Bush ever came to
Seattle or Oregon.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Angelo Calfo cited a 1981 incident in
Illinois in which Hains, upset over being laid off, returned to his
job site with a 12-gauge shotgun and an ammunition belt slung
around his chest. He was convicted of aggravated assault in that
episode.

<HEAD>Balancing the Budget in Five Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress, says the professor, is a bit like a
person in possession of a credit card on which the issuing bank
somehow forgot to put a limit.
   ``Credit limits on bank cards are there to protect you from
bankruptcy,'' he says. ``While you, perhaps, are sensible enough
not to spend yourself into the poorhouse, not everyone is.''
   Congress, he laments, seems to be in that latter category. It
talks about cutting the budget deficit, he says, but it has already
raised spending plans 11 percent beyond the president's proposals.
   The professor, William Dunkelberg, is an economist, but he says
the budget deficit is almost solely a political issue. Everyone
understands the need for government to live within its income, but
then politics obliterates reason, he says.
   History demonstrates that America needs to put a cap on federal
spending, just as certainly as those caps are needed on credit
cards. History proves it, he says. Congress chooses to raise taxes
instead of cutting spending.
   Whenever taxes are raised, he continued, you may be sure that
spending also will be raised. And when spending is raised, just as
certainly you can expect taxes to be raised.
   But, the elected official alibis, government needs more money
because of inflation. Not so, says Dunkelberg. He explains:
   If the tax rate is 10 percent and you earn a dollar, the
government gets 10 cents. If inflation raises your salary by 10
percent, you will get $1.10 and the government will get 11 cents,
or 10 percent more.
   However, he says, government spending keeps growing as a percent
of total income, and that requires higher tax rates - or lots of
new taxes. That's what has been happening, he says.
   ``Why should government get more of our output?'' he asks. He
suggests everyone consider that question and make a political
decision:
   ``We must simply decide if we are getting our money's worth from
the dollars being spent by government.
   ``If we are, we shall be happy to pay. If not, we should cut
spending and send those dollars back to the people who are supposed
to be the beneficiaries of the governmental system _ the
taxpayers.''
   Dunkelberg is not just an abstract thinker; he is a practical
person who understands budgets and has to live within one as dean
of Temple University's school of business. ``We must cap federal
spending,'' he declares.
   He suggests we consider proposals such as that advanced by the
Chicago Association of Commerce and Industry, which would put a 5
percent annual cap on government spending increases. And if
inflation ate that up, so be it.
   ``It has a happy side effect of making government interested in
keeping inflation low,'' he observes.
   If we did that, he promised we would produce a balanced budget
within a few years, and then surpluses to reduce outstanding
government debt or to provide funds for new federal tax cuts.
   Note, he says, this 5 percent cap would not deny government an
annual increase. Each year it would still have about $50 billion in
new spending to allocate as it saw fit.
   All that we're doing here, says Dunkelberg, is making it
possible to eliminate the deficit. As matters stand, he explains,
``spending is now programmed to grow by more than revenues every
year.''
   Put a 5 percent cap on spending growth, he argues, and with
today's tax code we would achieve in five or six years what has
eluded us for two decades, a balanced budget. And after that, a
surplus.

   Stocks have lived up to their reputation in the
Persian Gulf crisis, but the dollar and gold clearly have not.
   You'd expect stock prices to gyrate in a situation like this.
And they have.
   You'd likewise expect the dollar and gold to attract the smart
money. But they haven't.
   If this worldwide emergency has taught us anything new about the
way the financial markets work, it's that some safe havens have
lost their traditional allure.
   The explanations offered sound like those used to describe the
political plunge of the Soviet Union. The end of the Cold War has
changed the natural order of things, the market experts say. That
has reduced the urgency of the so-called flight to safety by
investors.
   In the political arena, the United States has been an obvious
beneficiary of these changes. In the financial world, though, the
dollar has had to make room for other superpowers, principally the
German mark.
   Gold, too, has become an also-ran, moving briefly over $400 an
ounce in the early stages of the Gulf crisis, then retreating.
   In both cases, part of the explanation is that they don't make
world crises like they used to. With the Soviet Union leaning
toward the West, the chances for world peace look better than the
chances for world war, no matter who America's enemy of the moment
may be.
   Even outside politics, recent global shocks have dissipated
quickly. The stock market crash of 1987, for instance, was rapidly
erased by a revived bull market.
   Persian Gulf worries also shall pass. Traders may rush to safety
at the first signs of trouble, but exit just as swiftly on the
expectation that even the worst problems will be temporary.

   Temporary or not, the Gulf crisis was prompting some businesses
to make hay while the storm rumbled.
   Artesia Waters Co. of San Antonio, Texas, was rushing to supply
17,000 gallons of water to the troops in Saudi Arabia. Quaker Oats
Co. shipped 20,000 cases of Gatorade. Tyson Foods Inc. received
orders for 240,000 pounds of frozen chicken. Circus Circus
Enterprises Inc. of Las Vegas said it would donate 10,000 decks of
cards to the Air Force.
   None of the firms getting an unexpected windfall from the crisis
was brash enough to advertise it. But they were finding ways to get
the word out.
   ``We didn't initiate this thing,'' said Artesia President Rick
Scoville. ``. . . But once it got snowballing, we took advantage of
it.''
   Meanwhile, desert camouflage was selling out at Army surplus
stores around the country. It's a fashion statement for some;
others traveling to the Middle East were scarfing up the gear,
including gas masks, to scalp on the black market.

<HEAD>OIL: It's Light Sweet, Not WTI</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   With all eyes on the oil markets, the New York Mercantile
Exchange took the opportunity to renew its long-ignored case for a
semantic change.
   The U.S. benchmark crude traded on the futures market is ``light
sweet,'' not West Texas Intermediate, the Merc told its members.
   The WTI label stuck in the 1980s when the Merc first began
trading oil futures. It was the most common of several similar
grades on the market.
   No one much cared what the label was until some buyers, paying
for WTI, later discovered they were getting a different grade.
   So, please, it's light sweet _ light for its high hydrogen
component and sweet for its low sulphur content.
   Stay tuned for ``sour'' oil, which the Merc said it will begin
trading in about a year.

   The only good news on the economy was that the trade picture
brightened in the second quarter. The government said the spring
deficit was the smallest in 6{ years.
   But the improvement was based on a steady drop in oil prices,
which have recently reversed thanks to the tensions in the Gulf.
Analysts were not optimistic about future reports as long as the
oil outlook remained uncertain.
   In other reports, the government said the leading economic
indicators were flat in July, home sales fell, and factory orders
grew slightly. Mideast pressures could push all lower in August.

   McDonald's Corp. surprised the fast-food business by opening a

aimed at small-town markets, the company said.
   IBM said it would make its biggest product announcement in years
next week when it unveils a line of mainframe computers. The
expected publicity rush, large even by IBM standards, prompted the
company to hire a train to cart reporters to the press conference
in upstate New York next Wednesday.
   Steven Jobs said his Next Inc. would roll out new products later
in the month, including a souped-up workstation and spreadsheet
software. Analysts said Jobs, who founded Next after splitting with
Apple Computer, needs a homerun to deflect criticism that his new

   The United Auto Workers headed into Labor Day by targeting
General Motors Corp. for pattern contract negotiations. The goal is
to get a standard contract covering workers at GM, Ford Motor Co.

   First there was Iraq-nophobia, the fear of what the Gulf crisis

   When Campeau Corp.'s department stores sought
bankruptcy court sanctuary, it didn't surprise Wall Street
dealmakers who months ago saw the takeover business punctured by
the failure of the company's record retailing buyout.
   But Campeau's latest problems seem to have driven another stake
into the heart of the once-raging market for corporate buyouts.
   Bankers and investment firms have become even warier. And,
``it's made investors more cautious,'' said Perrin Long, a
securities industry analyst with Lipper Analytical Services Corp.
   Campeau's department store divisions, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., filed for protection from
their creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law.
   The divisions have a combined $7.7 billion in debt. Much of it
was borrowed through high-interest junk bonds to finance the
purchases by Campeau, a Canadian real estate developer, of Allied
in 1986 and Federated in 1988.
   The takeover business, which boomed in the '80s on the back of
junk bond financing, had to shift quickly into low gear after
Campeau revealed its troubles last September. Financing for several
deals, including Ramada Inc.'s restructuring and Coniston Partners'
acquisition of TW Services Inc., had to be revamped because of junk
bond market gyrations.
   Furthermore, big banks made cautious by the Campeau mess refused
to back a planned employee-management buyout of United Airlines'
parent UAL Corp.
   Suddenly, takeover financing appeared to be drying up. Wall
Street reacted by throwing a tantrum _ the collapse of the UAL deal
helped send the Dow Jones industrial average plunging 190 points on
Oct. 13.
   By the time Federated and Allied headed into court last week _
as many observers had expected would happen _ investment bankers
and dealmakers already were coping with a changed environment. But
experts say the Campeau filing has helped to subdue the buyout
market further.
   Companies still will be bought and sold, but finding bond
investors will be difficult, said Long.
   ``We're in a transitional period because junk bond financing
kind of has a dirty name,'' he said.
   Norman Weinger and Michael Metz, two Oppenheimer &amp; Co. analysts,
agreed in a report last week that mergers and acquisitions will
involve bigger commitments of equity by buyers.
   Investors simply don't want to leave themselves open to the
kinds of losses that Campeau's creditors are facing.
   Investment firms were listed among Campeau's biggest creditors.
The firms own or hold for others billions of dollars in Federated
and Allied bonds, and also put up millions of their own dollars for
short-term bridge loans to help Campeau complete the Federated deal.
   First Boston Corp., Campeau's lead adviser in the Federated
deal, could lose as much as $293 million, according to Fred Garcia,
a First Boston spokesman.
   Of that amount, $43 million is from junk bonds owned by First
Boston, Garcia said. The remaining $250 million is from a bridge
loan.
   First Boston already has provided for any losses by charging
them against its 1989 earnings, Garcia said, adding that the
company still showed a profit for the year.
   Another of Campeau's more than 50,750 creditors is PaineWebber
Inc., which put up a $95 million bridge loan in the Federated
buyout.
   A PaineWebber spokesman, Jeffrey Taufield, said the company's
losses on the loan have been offset somewhat by fees it collected
on the Federated deal. Like First Boston, PaineWebber has adjusted
its 1989 earnings to reflect any losses from the unpaid loan.
   Publicly, the companies portrayed any losses as a fact of
investment banking life.
   ``We remain committed to the merchant banking business,
understanding _ as has been demonstrated very clearly _ that it is
a high risk and high reward business,'' said Garcia.
   PaineWebber officials will continue looking at opportunities
``in companies where they believe there is long-term potential,''
Taufield said.
   But investment bankers have been chastened somewhat by the
Campeau filing.
   ``It would be foolish for us not to consider current market
conditions in any transaction,'' said an employee at one Wall
Street firm. ``We're not backing away _ but we've got our eyes
open.''
   Long predicted investment firms would move to reduce their
exposure to bridge loans, which generally are refinanced with bond
sales. The firms and other creditors are lining up to see how much
they can recover from Campeau.
   Long speculated the firms might get 20 cents back for each
dollar they lent.
   Besides their own balance sheets, dealmakers are also concerned
that Campeau's troubles may revive anti-takeover sentiment in
Washington.
   A year ago, after the record $24.53 billion leveraged buyout of
RJR Nabisco Inc. but well before Campeau's problems became public,
congressional committees held hearings on possible ways of curbing
debt-financed buyouts.
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks has already
announced that his committee will hold hearings on the Campeau
filing and and look into the consequences of leveraged buyouts.
   Brooks said he feared the Chapter 11 filing was ``only the
beginning, and that we will see the takeover trophies of the 1980s
become the bankruptcy case names of the 1990s.''
   Another I-told-you-so came from Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,
whose state is home base for Federated and Allied.
   ``Campeau represents the merger mania of the '80s, when
companies were more interested in devouring one another than
producing a better product,'' Metzenbaum said.
   Congress was out of town last week and spokesmen for the Senate
Finance and House Ways and Means committees said there had been no
discussion of those panels holding new hearings in the wake of the
Campeau filing.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ who last year testified that
investors could be ``left holding the bag'' if debt-laden buyout
targets ran into trouble _ has not commented publicly on the
Campeau filing.
   Brady last year did not advocate any limits on takeovers, saying
market forces should be allowed to determine the future of the
buyout process.
   Congress passed some minor restrictions on the deductibility of
interest from debt-financed buyouts last year. Jim Jaffe, an aide
to Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said the
committee was unable to garner enough support for more substantive
changes because of a lack of guidance from the Bush administration.
   ``That is really what people are waiting for,'' Jaffe said.
``They figure it's not worth doing anything if the administration
isn't going to ultimately sign on.''

<HEAD>Jobs Data Seen As Key to Financial Outlook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As they go back to their jobs after the Labor
Day weekend, many government officials and Wall Street investment
managers will be focused on the latest trends in the American work
force.
   A monthly report due Friday on the employment situation may well
give financial policymakers their first late-summer signal on the
economic outlook for the rest of the year.
   The data could serve as an early litmus test in the debate over
whether a recession lies in wait.
   In addition, some observers think the figures may play a pivotal
role in determining the Federal Reserve's next move in setting its
monetary policy.
   Of course, veteran statistics-watchers always caution that
numbers for any single month shouldn't be asked to carry too much
weight.
   But any weakness that shows up in the report for August would
come on the heels of a set of decidedly downbeat readings for July,
when the unemployment rate increased to 5.5 percent from 5.2
percent the month before.
   ``July's employment report indicated a much weaker economy, with
heavy job losses in construction, services and manufacturing,''
notes the current edition of the Merrill Lynch Market Letter.
   The July report showed a drop of 57,000 in nonfarm payroll
employment, excluding workers employed in connection with the
federal census, Merrill Lynch analysts observe.
   They project a further 30,000 decline for August, again after
adjusting for short-term distortions involving the census.
   If there were another sizable increase in the unemployment rate,
it could represent the signal the Federal Reserve has been awaiting
to relax its credit policy, seeking to foster a drop in interest
rates.
   But some analysts warn against making the assumption that
interest rates would automatically fall as evidence accumulated of
a business slump.
   One widely publicized x-factor in the equation is the August
surge in world oil prices, which has intensified fears of inflation
in many of the industrialized countries.
   In this kind of environment, said Paul Boltz, financial
economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore, ``easing may
redouble the market's concerns about the Fed's willingness to fight
inflation.''
   The pressure on oil prices eased in the past week, permitting
stock prices to rally. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
closed Friday at 2,614.36, up 81.44 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.92 to 176.97;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
13.88 to 381.21, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 7.10 at 323.39.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 127.88 million shares a day,
down from 189.86 million the week before.
   Even with cooperation from oil prices, a good many observers say
they have reservations about the interest-rate outlook.
   The U.S. credit markets face stiff competition these days from
interest-bearing securities in other countries such as Germany,
where rates are comparable and reported inflation is less.
   There are worries, too, about worldwide demand for capital,
given intense needs for investment in Eastern Europe.
   ``It also appears that demands to maintain a military presence
in the Middle East will absorb capital the Middle East could have
invested in foreign economies and markets,'' said Greg Smith at
Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``We want to be somewhat cautious about assuming interest rates
will come down any time soon,'' Smith concluded, ``even if the
economy does prove to be as weak as people expect.''

   Airline industry officials say they're not sure
what can be done to assure customers get faster ticket service than
what they encountered earlier this week in a last-minute rush for
discounted air fares.
   When many travel agents around the country tried to lock in
tickets for airline customers on Wednesday, their computers spit
back this message: SYSTEM UNAVAILABLE.
   A deadline for cheap autumn fares combined with a new charge for
higher jet fuel costs threw the nation's airline reservation system
into what agents and airlines described as an unprecedented
gridlock.
   As tens of thousands of Americans jammed phone lines seeking to
book tickets, computers were so slow that getting reservation
information often took 30 minutes or more rather than the usual few
seconds. Some systems crashed. And would-be passengers who tried
calling airlines directly wound up on what seemed like permanent
hold.
   ``The system's not built to handle Armageddon, and Wednesday was
Armageddon,'' Dexter Koehl, spokesman for Minneapolis-based Carlson
Travel Network, said Friday. ``People simply got shut out.''
   It's unknown how many customers couldn't buy the discounted
tickets, but airlines said passengers had plenty of advance notice
and shouldn't have waited until the last minute.
   Industry officials mostly threw up their hands and said there
was little that could be done to avoid such days in the future.
They said increasing the capacity of airline reservation systems
has never been discussed because the computers never faced such
large demand.
   But some agents said two prior extensions by airlines of the
midnight deadline Wednesday may have encouraged travelers to take a
chance and hope for another extension before making plans. That
also may have added to the burden.
   The double whammy was a deadline for special fares _ described
as among the best deals in recent years, with prices discounted 40
percent or more _ and a 5.3 percent fuel surcharge on all tickets.
   Travel agents worked well into the night to meet demand, and
airlines including Northwest Airlines, American Airlines and Trans
World Airlines, extended the deadline.
   ``We ended up hand writing a lot of tickets,'' said a West Coast
travel agent who asked not to be named. ``I'm sure we missed a lot
of calls where we could help people.''
   USAir spokeswoman Susan Young said the airline received about
330,000 telephone calls on Wednesday, about 100,000 more than
normal. It refused to extend the deadline.
   ``We gave people plenty of time and plenty of notice,'' Young
said. ``There was adequate time. People who did hang on the line
were able to make reservations.''
   American's Sabre airline reservations network with 125,000
terminals handled 100 million entries requesting information on
Wednesday, about 25 percent more than the previous single-day
record.
   The airline added a midnight to 6 a.m. shift of agents after
realizing that thousands of callers probably weren't getting
through, and it honored the cheap rates until that time.
   ``I don't know what else we could have done in this case,''
American spokesman Tim Smith said. ``The fares were there for
almost three weeks. We always urge people to plan ahead.''
   Northwest spokesman Doug Miller said the airline extended the
cheap fares for 24 hours because ``people who under normal
circumstances would have had plenty of time to make the booking
weren't able to.''
   ``Our computer reservation system was overloaded. We were
experiencing delays in getting bookings accomplished,'' he said.
   The fares were good enough to fight for despite busy signals and
on-hold elevator music. A midweek roundtrip flight between New York
and Charlotte, N.C., was $158 under the special fare, compared to
$251 now. A New York to Los Angeles ticket was $318 until
Wednesday, now $449.
   Carlson Travel Network, which has 1,300 offices nationwide, said
its air sales in the first three days of the week as the deadline
bulge grew were $39 million, compared with $30 million for the
previous seven days.
   At one Carlson agency in midtown Manhattan, the manager stayed
until 3:30 a.m. Thursday processing tickets. The company is busy
calculating its overtime costs for the week.
   ``It's like when you flip on every switch in the house,''
Susannah Knight, owner of Knight Travel in Charlotte, said of the
overload. ``They more or less blew a fuse.''

<HEAD>High Gasoline Doesn't Deter Labor Day Drivers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices have surged to their highest levels in years,
but they aren't keeping many Americans home this Labor Day weekend.
   Fuel-addicted motorists seem willing to pay whatever they must,
even though the inflated prices have some folks grumbling at the
pump.
   ``It's like being in jail,'' said Bud Case, a builder from South
Charleston, W.Va. ``If the bail is $10,000, someone will dig in and
get that money. Gas prices are the same way.''
   As Case shelled out $26.13 to fill up his Chevy S-10 camper
Friday in Charleston, he said he'd spend $5 a gallon if that was
what it took to get away for the holiday.
   Prices aren't nearly that bad amid the oil crisis caused by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, although a road trip this weekend will
cost a few dollars more than it did last Labor Day.
   The American Automobile Association reported that gasoline
prices were averaging $1.307 for a gallon of self-serve regular
unleaded just before the long weekend. That's up from $1.084 over
the July 4 holiday and $1.062 on Labor Day last year.
   The AAA predicted a 2 percent decrease in Labor Day travel, but
it said higher gasoline is not to blame.
   ``We think it has more to do with just the general doldrums of
the economy,'' AAA spokesman Geoff Sundstrom said. ``Historically,
people tend to curtail their travel if they're concerned about
their economic livelihood. High prices by themselves don't seem to
cut into travel that much.''
   Motorists interviewed around the nation agreed they are pretty
much hooked on fuel, so they're using it even if they don't like
the price.
   ``It ought to be back where it was before they started all this
foolishness,'' said Jacob Rogers, 84, of Belgrade, Maine, as he
filled his station wagon at North Augusta Texaco on Friday.
   ``I think it's terrible, but what are you going to do?'' asked
Lewis Ashley of Raleigh, N.C. ``Gasoline is a necessity. People are
going to drive even if hits $2 a gallon. They don't have much of a
choice.''
   Ashley said he had started riding city buses more in the last
month because of the increased gasoline prices.
   Driving 303 miles from St. Louis to Chicago would take $19.80
worth of gas at current prices and an average 20 miles per gallon,
compared with $16.42 on July 4 or $16.09 last Labor Day.
   Cars with better gas mileage would cost less, but gas guzzlers
would cost more.
   ``If people realize that on a relatively short trip that we're
not really talking big bucks, it shouldn't stop them from going,''
said Bern Rotman, spokesman for the New York state Department of
Economic Development. His department estimated a Labor Day round
trip of 600 miles will cost just $5.32 more than it did last year.
   ``People have planned their Labor Day trip and they're taking
it,'' said Frank Eastvedt, spokesman for the Automobile Club of
Southern California.
   The club has noticed changes in the types of vacations people
are taking.
   ``We're doing more short trips than longer ones,'' he said.
``They're taking maybe trips just within the state rather than
going further.''
   A survey in Alabama found motorists are avoiding the
full-service lanes and pumping their own gas. Often, they switch to
cheaper grades.

<HEAD>Hundreds of Chrysler Hourly Workers Punch Out for Last Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of union workers at Chrysler Corp. have
accepted buyouts designed to reduce the No. 3 automaker's need for
layoffs.
   The workers punched out for the last time Friday. Chrysler
spokesman Lee Sechler estimated about 600 people had signed up for
the buyout program.
   ``It's a positive alternative to layoffs,'' he said.
   The reduction in the company's work force comes as Chrysler
negotiates a new national labor contract with the United Auto
Workers union and as the financially struggling company seeks ways
to cut costs.
   Meantime, negotiators for the UAW and General Motors Corp.
continued meetings Friday in subcommittees that focus on particular
contract issues, such as wages, benefits and job security.
   Last Tuesday, the union picked GM as its bargaining target,
intending to reach an agreement that it can then bring to the other
two automakers. Contracts covering more than 450,000 active workers
for GM, Chrysler and Ford Motor Co. expire Sept. 14.
   GM and UAW officials said they planned to meet during the Labor
Day weekend. Negotiations began in mid-July.
   Sechler said it won't be known until late next week or perhaps
later how much money the automaker is spending on the buyout. He
declined to provide details of the plan, which is contained in a
1988 national UAW-Chrysler contract.
   The payout formula is based primarily on an eligible worker's
seniority with Chrysler. There are about 60,000 UAW-covered
employees at Chrysler, but company and union officials said they
didn't know precisely how many of them would be eligible for the
program.
   The plans is not open to workers in some Chrysler factories,
such as its Jeep assembly plant in Toledo, and some job
classifications within plants, such as skilled trades.
   Chrysler is involved in a cost-cutting program launched last
October to slice $1.5 billion from its $26 billion annual budget by
the end of this year.
   The automaker's second-quarter earnings were down 47.2 percent,
and Chrysler has acknowledged that the company will post a
significant loss during the third quarter, mainly because of
production interruptions at its profitable minivan plants.
   Production at the minivan factories in St. Louis and Windsor,
Ontario, was stopped for about four weeks to retool for 1991 models.
   Since reaching its 1988 contract with the UAW, Chrysler has shut
down two assembly plants in Kenosha, Wis., and Detroit, resulting
in more than 7,000 layoffs. Chrysler plans to close its St. Louis
car plant Nov. 9.
   Meantime, an unidentified UAW official was harshly critical of
Chrysler in a story in Friday editions of The Detroit News for
reinstating merit pay for executives while pleading poverty to
hourly workers.
   Sechler said an in-house magazine distributed to employees in
April noted that the merit-pay program had been reinstated after
being suspended last October when the cost-cutting program began.
