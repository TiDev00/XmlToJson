<HEAD>Police Chief Calls on West to Help Fight Drugs</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Colombia's chief of police said Monday
his country cannot fight drug traffickers alone and called on
Western nations to increase its efforts to combat trafficking.
   Police chief Gen. Miguel Gomez Padilla said in an interview that
industrialized countries must fight drugs on all levels, from ending
arms sales to drug traffickers to tightening banking laws to stop
drug barons from laundering their money.
   ``To end narco-trafficking what is required is an atttack on all
levels of the process, including consumption,'' Gomez told The AP.
``We need cooperation from the rest of the world to end drug
trafficking.''
   He made his comments as Colombian President Virgilio Barco was
visiting Washington to discuss the drug war with President Bush.
   Gomez said Western countries are cooperating in the drug war, but
he said the aid ``will never be enough.''
   ``Colombia has insisted that drug trafficking is a multinational
crime,'' he said.
   He added, ``It is indispensible that there be strong action on
the part of industrialized countries to attack consumption.''
   Colombia supplies an estimated 80 percent of all the cocaine
consumed in the United States.
   Maj. Jorge Humberto Martin, press spokesman for the National
Police, said Colombia needs ``communications and transportation
equipment, more helicopters and more money'' to fight drug barons.
   Colombia launched a crackdown of drug traffickers early this year
that Gomez said has succeeded in reducing cocaine exports by 20 to
30 percent.
   In response, the powerful Medellin cocaine cartel has carried out
a campaign of bombings and assassinations that has left an average
of two policemen dead each day this year.
   Bush met in February with the presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and
Peru and promised the United States would increase its aid in the
fight against drug traffickers.
   Gomez said Bush has increased U.S. aid, but said not enough
controls have been put on the laundering of drug money.
   ``We have insisted on the control of laundering capital, and this
has been happening, but not to the degree that we would have
liked,'' Gomez said.
   On May 27, Cesar Gaviria of the ruling Liberal Party was elected
to succeed Barco. Of the major presidential candidates, Gaviria took
the hardest line against drug traffickers.

<HEAD>Tentative Settlement Announced in British Columbia Truckers' Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative settlement was
announced Monday in a British Columbia truckers' strike that has
disrupted commercial traffic at U.S. border crossings.
   But some strikers denounced it and pledged to keep their border
blockades in place.
   About two dozen U.S. truckers who had delivered their loads in
Canada and were then stranded at the border were allowed to head
home Monday night through the Blaine, Wash., border crossing. But
most loaded trucks remained blocked there.
   Passenger cars, buses, and trucks carrying medical supplies, mail
and fresh produce were allowed through.
   Bryan Williams, the provincial government's chief mediator in the
strike, said agreements had been signed between the independent
truckers and ``a fairly substantial number'' of employers.
   The blockades have resulted in food and fuel shortages in the
province and in Point Roberts, a small peninsula that's part of
Washington state but reachable only through British Columbia or by
water.
   The president of the Western Owner Operators Association, Don
Tofsrud, said the independent truckers were being asked to dismantle
their blockades.
   ``I'm asking all the guys to get home and get some sleep,''
Tofsrud said.
   But several hours later, the blockade continued at Blaine.
   Details of the tentative settlement were withheld, but some
striking truckers reacted negatively to reports they'd heard.
   Doug Neal, a spokesman for striking truckers at the Blaine
crossing, said a pay demand of $40 per hour in Canadian currency _
$34 U.S. _ was non-negotiable.
   ``If we don't get it, we're going to stay here until we do,'' he
said.
   The truckers pay their own operating costs. They presently are
paid $26 to $35 an hour Canadian, about $22 and $29 U.S.
   More than 1,000 independent British Columbia truckers have
participated in a series of escalating job actions since withdrawing
their services a week ago to obtain higher hauling rates. The
blockade of four border points between British Columbia and
Washington state and along two major Canadian highways began in
earnest Friday.
   Idled drivers at the Washington state border city of Blaine at
the end of Interstate 5 said Monday they were growing angry and
wanted to go home.
   ``We got trapped up here,'' said Dick Tallmadge of Kent, Wash.,
who estimated he was losing about $100 U.S. a day in mileage
payments.
   Tallmadge said he didn't understand how keeping U.S. drivers
``hostage'' aided the Canadian truckers.
   ``We're not doing them any good,'' he said. ``We are a thorn in
their side.''
   ``We're T.O.W., Truckers of War,'' said Dyke Stewart of Raleigh,
N.C.
   Stewart later announced the agreement that let empty U.S. trucks
return home through Blaine. He said American truckers who refused to
let their trailers be examined to show they were empty, or who were
carrying goods back to the United States, would not be allowed to
move.

  Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
South Korean President Roh Tae-woo on Monday agreed to establish
diplomatic relations between their nations and to continue
discussions toward that end, the South Korean leader announced.
   ``As a result of my meeting with President Gorbachev today,
normal bilateral relations between our countries will be restored,''
said Roh, fresh from an afternoon meeting with the Soviet leader.
   No date was set for further discussions.

   Three-year-old Fabian Maldonado was dropped from a
federal food program because he is too healthy. Now, his mother
doesn't know how she is going to feed him.
   Another mother, Kellie Brillhart, estimates she will lose about
$200 a month from her food budget because her oldest daughter has
been cut from the same program.
   They are among some 27,000 women and toddlers in Texas who will
be struck from the Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and
Children by July because of rising food costs and increased demand,
said Debra Stabeno, program director for Texas.
   ``WIC has helped us a lot,'' said Mrs. Brillhart, 23, the mother
of three children who are all on WIC. ``My 3-year-old daughter,
Lisa, was cut off the program last week. She came up to be renewed
and they just said, `Sorry, she can't get back on it.' But she's
been cut before. I told them, `Well, I'll be back in six months.'''
   Fabian Maldonado also was cut from the Houston program.
   ``They told me there would be no more (food voucher) cards,''
said his mother, Fortino Maldonado, 37. ``I don't know how I will be
able to buy food now.''
   Mrs. Maldonado said in Spanish that her son has been on WIC since
he was an infant.
   The 12-year-old program was designed to curb the infant mortality
rate and ensure that pregnant women at risk for nutritional
deficiencies delivered healthy babies.
   WIC serves lower income women who are young, anemic, smoke, use
drugs, have poor dietary habits or other problems. It also is for
poor children up to 5 years old who have nutrition problems.
   Participants receive vouchers they use at grocery stores to buy
milk, cheese, cereal, juice, infant formula, peanut butter, eggs and
dried beans.
   But higher food costs and increased demand resulted in a budget
shortfall this year, forcing WIC officials to implement cuts in at
least 36 states.
   Healthy children and mothers are primary targets.
   ``We serve 330,000 people a month in the state,'' Ms. Stabeno
said. ``We're not shutting the doors or anything. We want to
encourage mothers to keep their appointments, even those in the
lowest priority, because they still may be eligible.''
   Pregnant women who are accepted to the program remain eligible
until six weeks after they deliver, unless they are breast feeding,
and are re-evaluated every six months. Infants remain on the program
until their first birthday and then are re-evaluated for growth and
nutritional deficiencies every six months.
   Now when they come in for re-evaluation, some women are shocked
when they are told they or their toddlers are too healthy to
continue receiving vouchers.
   ``What am I am supposed to have done _ not given my baby a
bottle, or not taken her to the doctor for shots so that she can
continue to receive assistance?'' said one 39-year-old mother of
three whose 13-month-old baby was cut from the program last week.
She spoke on condition of anonymity.
   When Texas officials saw food cost increases doubling and
tripling their budget estimates, they initially cut back the amount
of cereal and cheese for clients. But now Texas officials have
resorted to dropping thousands from WIC each month.
   ``We've reduced our food package in the quantities allowed for
younger children and postpartum women as based on the latest
recommended daily allowance,'' Ms. Stabeno said. ``But you can get
the recommended daily allowance and still be hungry.''
   In Houston, where officials must trim 1,600 people from the WIC
rolls by July, director Fay Walker acknowledged the cutbacks will
affect only a small portion of the 30,700 city program participants.
   ``Still, I think it's going to affect us,'' Ms. Walker said.
``Having to turn one child away is one child too many.''
   Ms. Walker said WIC also brings many pregnant women into health
clinics early in their pregnancy, allowing for more prenatal care,
which also enhances the baby's health.
   ``It's been proven that dollars spent in the WIC program are
dollars saved in Medicaid and other programs,'' Ms. Stabeno said.
``There have been a lot of nationally funded studies that show that
WIC helped increase the birth weight of the babies and the length of
pregnancy and made a substantial difference in the cognitive
abilities of the children.''
   Diana Castillo, 27, of Humble used WIC for about five years to
help her four children.
   ``Since I'm on welfare, it helped quite a lot,'' Mrs. Castillo
said. ``Sometimes you don't have enough food stamps to get the extra
things the babies need.''

<TEXT>
   When Bob Crostic bought his first pair of
stonewashed jeans recently, he discovered a small chunk of pumice in
one of the pockets.
   There was more than a bit of irony in the find.
   Crostic, a staffer with the U.S. Forest Service, oversees an
open-pit pumice mine in the Santa Fe National Forest that is at the
center of a noisy dispute about the use of public lands.
   Because some of the pumice is used to stonewash or acid-wash
fabric, critics contend the forest is being sacrificed for fashion,
and ``Fashion vs. Forest'' has become their rallying cry.
   The Las Conchas Pumice Mine looks like a moonscape, the dazzling
white of the pumice piles offset only by a couple of heaps of
burned, blackened tree stumps.
   ``Great stuff to mine,'' Crostic told recent visitors as he
grabbed a handful of the lightweight, volcanic rock and sifted it
through his fingers.
   Last spring, as work began to prepare the mine site in northern
New Mexico's scenic Jemez Mountains, about 20 members of the
environmental group Earth First! converged to protest the operation.
Three were arrested when they locked themselves to earthmoving
equipment.
   At issue is a 19th-century federal law that allows private
citizens to mine and appropriate public lands at negligible cost.
   The law, enacted to encourage mineral development, says that
anyone who finds a valuable mineral deposit on public lands may
stake a claim and mine it or patent the claim and purchase the land.
   While coal, oil, gas, sand, stone and other minerals have been
removed from its provisions, the General Mining Law of 1872 still
covers metals such as gold, lead, copper and zinc, as well as pumice.
   Copar Pumice Co., which had staked claims in the area, received
approval last summer from the Forest Service to strip-mine 33 acres
in the national forest about 15 miles west of Los Alamos. Copar then
must restore the site once mining is finished by recontouring it and
planting grass and trees.
   Environmentalists went to court, contending the mine's impact had
not been adequately assessed, but mining continues while the case is
pending.
   In September, Copar owner Richard Cook applied for a patent, or
outright ownership, of 1,700 acres surrounding the mine.
   Under the 1872 law, if the tract is determined to contain
valuable pumice, Cook can buy the land for $2.50 an acre. Once he
owns the property, no state or federal reclamation laws would
require him to restore the site after mining.
   ``It's essentially a major ripoff of public land under an archaic
law,'' said Henry Oat of Santa Fe, who heads the East Fork
Preservation Coalition.
   The operating mine is barely a fourth of a mile from the East
Fork of the Jemez River, a pristine trout stream that has been
approved by Congress for inclusion in the National Wild and Scenic
Rivers system.
   Nearly 180 acres of the land Cook seeks fall within the
quarter-mile corridor on either side of the river that would be
protected by the federal designation, which awaits President Bush's
approval.
   The legislation prohibits Cook from patenting the 180 acres along
the river, but he cannot be prevented from mining it because he has
valid claims. He has said, though, that he would not mine it because
that would spoil the view from the river.
   ``We don't intend to destroy the landscape or the area in any
way,'' he said from his office in Espanola.
   Cook also said he has no plans for the 1,700 acres other than to
mine it, but his opponents fear he would develop condominiums or
other commercial ventures in the forest.
   Environmentalists also are worried that the beautiful Jemez area,
a popular tourist destination, will turn into a pumice-mining center.
   The Copar pumice is the remnant of a volcanic explosion 150,000
years ago and is considered valuable because of its large-sized
chunks, its purity and its proximity to the highway.
   Pumice goes into products ranging from building materials to
toothpaste.
   Its use as an industrial abrasive, including stonewashing
garments to give them an aged appearance, is a small but growing
segment of the market, said Donna Smith, a mineral economist who
lives near the mine.
   Copar, however, is not a major pumice supplier to the garment
industry. Cook said about 10 percent of the mine's pumice goes for
stonewashing, far less than was anticipated when the mine opened.
   ``The garment industry just isn't taking all the large chunks
now,'' Cook said.
   Most of Copar's pumice is used for construction, he said.
   Industry spokesmen say much of the pumice used by major garment
manufacturers is imported.
   Levi Strauss &amp; Co., for example, buys its pumice from Turkey for
its products that are stone- or acid-washed, and has cut back about
60 percent on the amount of pumice it uses, supplementing the stone
with chemicals, said company spokesman David Samson in San Francisco.
   Although only a fraction of Copar's product ends up in the
industrial machines in which denim is stonewashed, opponents of the
mine have urged a boycott of stonewashed clothes.
   The East Fork Preservation Coalition and other environmental
groups also are pushing a proposal to have 115,000 acres, including
the mine site, designated as a National Recreation Area, which they
say would stop the patent process and offer greater protection for
the forest.
   There are efforts, too, to reform the 118-year-old mining law,
including two bills that have been introduced in Congress to revamp
it.
   The Copar mine is one of a series of disputes arising from the
law and an example of why it should be changed, said Philip Hocker,
president of the Mineral Policy Center in Washington, D.C.
   ``The law says that anybody who finds a valuable mineral deposit
in the public domain has a right to mine it, no matter what the
environmental consequences and with no payment to the public,'' he
said. ``That's what's wrong with it.''

   Angola's civil war began as soon as it gained
independence from Portugal in 1975 and fighting continues despite
peace talks. Associated Press correspondent Tony Smith traveled to
Luanda and filed this report from the government side.

<TEXT>
   By day, life in Luanda has been much the
same for 15 years: Armed soldiers stand on street corners, women
wait in line at dismal shops for the monthly rations of necessities,
and everyone looks tired.
   At night, war comes to the city, which less than a year ago was
cautiously preparing for peace.
   Four bombs have exploded in the capital this year. Most of Luanda
has been dark after sundown since rebels sabotaged 44 high-voltage
pylons east of Luanda in April. Sporadic gunfire can be heard until
dawn.
   Guerrilla sabotage has interrupted water supplies and delayed
food shipments, sending prices soaring in bustling black markets
that are much better supplied than state stores, where prices are
fixed.
   In April, the curfew began at midnight and most people ignored
it. Now it starts at 9.30 p.m. and is enforced by soldiers, who push
curfew-breakers into vans and take them to police stations for the
night.
   Rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was angered by an army offensive deep
into his southern strongholds early this year and has stepped up
urban sabotage and bombings despite new peace efforts that began in
April. Most of the attacks have been in and around Luanda.
   In the dusty suburb of Palanca, a young soldier who identified
himself only as Ben leaned against the barred doors of a darkened
cafe and switched off the regular ``Good Morning, Combatant'' progam
on his transistor radio.
   ``It's not just that people are frightened to go out at night,''
he said. ``There's no electricity, so there's nowhere to go.''
   Bars and discos that provide Luandans with a release from the war
are becoming scarce.
   Last year, new bars and nightclubs began to thrive after
President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire brought Savimbi and Jose Eduardo
dos Santos, Angola's president, together June 22 and the two foes
sealed a truce with a handshake.
   The cease-fire collapsed within days, however, and tentative
peace talks broke down soon afterward.
   In April, low-level officials from both sides held the first
discussions since then in Portugal, from which Angola gained its
independence 15 years ago. UNITA has called for a new truce, but
government delegates say agreement on terms and a future agenda must
come first.
   Dos Santos' government, still avowedly Marxist and backed by an
estimated $1.5 billion a year in Soviet military aid, has hinted it
might accept rebel demands for free multiparty elections, but only
when peace is well established.
   ``The government doesn't want to prolong a pernicious war when
political solutions are feasible among compatriots,'' the defense
minister, Gen. Pedro Maria Tonha, said on television last month.
   He said Operation Zebra, an offensive the government says
captured a strategic airstrip Feb. 2 at Mavinga, 700 miles southeast
of Luanda, shows the army ``has sufficient fighting power to silence
UNITA militarily.''
   Tonha spoke at a ceremony in southern Cuando-Cubango province,
where he decorated soldiers who fought in the campaign.
   On May 15, Lt. Col. Francisco Furtado, Zebra's chief of staff,
told foreign reporters visiting the southeastern military base at
Cuito Cuanavale that his soldiers were withdrawing from Mavinga
because it had ``lost its strategic importance.''
   A Defense Ministry statement in mid-May said that Mavinga, 90
miles south of Cuito Cuanavale, was firmly under government control
and that President dos Santos theatened to ``strangle'' the rebel
headquarters at Jamba, farther south, with long-range artillery
bombardment.
   UNITA claimed its fighters routed government troops well north of
the area last week, but Western diplomats in Lisbon, the capital of
Portugal, said intelligence reports gave no indication of such a
battle.
   Large troop movements through the Luanda airport support claims
by Western sources that two of four government battalions from the
Mavinga operation were being moved north to the new Cuanza-Bengo
front, which starts 35 miles east of Luanda. It is commanded by Gen.
Antonio dos Santos Franca, who planned Operation Zebra.
   Military sources in Luanda say the estimated 2,000 UNITA
guerrillas operating in small sabotage and ambush squads around the
capital should be no match for government ground and air offensives.
   Heavy fighting continues in northern Uige, Zaire and Malanje
provinces, near the border with Zaire, and rebels have attacked
government units guarding foreign oil installations near the coastal
city of Soyo, north of Luanda.
   Also, UNITA says it always can return to bush warfare, making
hit-and-run attacks on areas under government control.
   U.N. observers in Angola say more than 33,000 of the Cuban
soldiers who helped fight the rebellion since it began in 1975 have
returned home under U.S.-brokered accords signed by Angola, Cuba and
South Africa in December 1988. Cuba had about 50,000 military
personnel in Angola when the withdrawal began.
   Under the agreement, South Africa promised Namibia independence
and an end to its military and logisitcs support for UNITA.
   The rebels still receive about $50 million a year in U.S.
military aid, most of it funneled through Zaire. The State
Department has pledged to continue assistance until peace is
achieved.

   Contra rebels being disarmed in
Nicaragua say they're putting their foot down over one request: they
don't want to trade in their soldiers' boots for rubber ones.
   ``Our fight for democracy has been very dignified and this makes
us reject this type of boots they are giving us when we turn in our
rifles,'' said Carmelo Cuadra, a disarmed rebel in this guerrilla
base 150 miles north of Managua.
   Each Contra is being supplied with a pair of blue jeans,
checkered shirt and rubber boots. They say the rubber boots are not
appropriate for the farm work many will be doing as civilians after
a decade of war.
   They are also being given food rations, a medical checkup and
safe-conduct pass.
   One former combatant, Fremio Altamirano, said his companions have
been allowed to keep their jungle boots, rain ponchos, hammocks and
backpacks.
   The United Nations, which is overseeing the demobilization, said
that as of Saturday, 3,288 rebels had turned in their weapons. An
estimated 12,000 rebels are expected to be decommissioned by June 10.
   Violeta Barrios de Chamorro was elected in February, ending a
decade of rule by the leftist Sandinistas. Her government and Contra
leaders signed an agreement calling for the demobilization to be
completed by June 10.
   The accord calls for the Contras to disarm in five security zones
around the country which are policed by U.N. forces.
   In return, the government agreed to provide more than 20
development zones where the Contras can settle. It provides them
with their own police forces and with a say in local town councils
and government departments involved in the resettlement.
   It is the latest in a series of agreements. Rebel demobilization
has been an off-again, on-again process since Mrs. Chamorro's
election.

   When the Rev. Donald Baird's son invited
classmates over for a backyard birthday party, the children's
parents called, one by one, to decline the invitation.
   Eventually, the party consisted of the Presbyterian minister's
son and one friend.
   Even as the Mormon Church seeks improved relations with other
religious groups, many gentiles in the Mormon heartland say they
face economic, political and social sanctions _ or simply feel
shunned.
   ``I think everybody has a war story to tell,'' said Baird, one of
the authors of a Utah Presbyterian study of the Mormon Church.
   Signs of change exist: a recently revised ritual no longer
portrays non-Mormon clergy as agents of Satan, for example. But some
ecumenical officials and church observers say the Church of Jesus
Christ of Latter-day Saints has not entered the mainstream of
American religious life.
   ``Mormons' exclusivist claim toward truth and being God's church
is as strong as it's ever been,'' said the head of a liberal Mormon
group who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``That's probably the
major stumbling block toward improving relations with other
churches.''
   The issue of interfaith relations with the Mormon Church was
brought to the forefront by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), which
is holding its General Assembly through June 6 in a land where
Mormons outnumber Presbyterians more than 200-to-1.
   In response, Mormon leaders issued an appeal to set up informal
meetings with Presbyterian officials, and the denomination's
Theology and Worship Ministry Unit and Utah Presbytery both
submitted reports on Mormon-Presbyterian relations.
   ``We believe in `impossible possibilities' because God has made
them possible time and time again,'' the national group said in its
report calling for further dialogue with the Mormon Church.
   The church was founded in 1830 by Joseph Smith based on
revelations he said he received in upstate New York. Tensions with
non-Mormon neighbors forced Smith to move the church from Ohio to
Missouri, then Illinois, where Smith was shot to death in 1844.
   After Brigham Young brought followers to the valley of the Great
Salt Lake in 1847, tension was constant between the federal
government and the church until the end of church-sanctioned
polygamy in 1890 and the granting of statehood to Utah in 1896.
   Jan Shipps, a professor of religious studies at Indiana
University, said the recent elimination of the part of the church's
endowment ceremony where Satan hired a non-Mormon preacher to spread
false teachings ``is a very important signifier the LDS church is
moving away from its position that all other churches are false.''
   Shipps also said though no official policy encourages ecumenical
relations, there has been ``a kind of relaxing'' of rules allowing
some local Mormon churches to get involved with councils of
ministries.
   A Mormon Church spokesman said the church has always held the
position all religious groups should enjoy freedom of conscience,
and he characterized individual acts of unfriendliness toward
non-Mormons as isolated instances.
   ``The church leaders encourage members to go out of their way to
be kind to neighbors of other faiths. That's our policy,'' said Don
LeFevre, director of media relations.
   But many non-Mormons say life is not easy in a state where about
70 percent of the state's 1.6 million residents are Mormon, as are
the governor and 98 percent of state legislators.
   The report to the Presbyterian General Assembly prepared by the
Presbytry of Utah cites one survey that found a majority of
non-Mormons believed local companies are biased in hiring and
promoting employees, and another that showed the majority of Mormon
residents were unaware of any bias toward gentiles.
   One man tells of how he was greeted to his new neighborhood by
Mormon neighbors who hung up a welcome sign extending the full
length of their house.
   But others tell a different story.
   Laura Neidert said her Mormon neighbors have avoided her family.
``I felt once they found out we were not LDS, we were shunned,'' she
said.
   On Sunday night, more than 300 people from Protestant, Orthodox
and Roman Catholic churches marched from the First Presbyterian
Church to the Salt Palace in an Ecumenical Pentecost Procession. No
Mormon representatives were asked to march.
   ``We've invited recognized Christian denominations to
participate,'' said parade coordinator Ina White.
   Marchers said the parade showed local Mormons they aren't the
only religious group in town.
   ``I think it opens up the LDS community that there are other
churches that are vibrant, that are alive, that are witnessing in
the United States,'' said Presbyterian Howard Hartog of Mount
Pleasant. ``It's a great feeling.''
   In the general ecumenical realm, the Mormon Church's policy of
aggressively seeking converts from other faiths continues to keep it
on the sidelines of interfaith discussions, according to some
observers.
   ``The Mormons' sheep-stealing is offensive to all Christian
groups,'' said Roman Catholic Brother Jeffrey Gros, director of the
Commission on Faith and Order of the National Council of Churches.
   ``When someone is proselytizing you, they are not recognizing you
as fully Christian. I think that is the sticking point.''
   The Mormons, however, have no plans to back down on proselytism.
Said LeFevre: ``Our philosophy is we have something so precious we
would like to show it.''
   Some people within the Presbyterian Church say much can be
learned from such evangelistic enthusiasm. The Presbyterian Church
has lost more than a third of its members in the past
quarter-century to fall below 3 million, while the Mormon Church has
steadily grown to 4.2 million members.
   ``You can't buy a hamburger here without getting into a
theological discussion. ... That's fantastic,'' Baird said. ``Here,
religion is not a hobby. It's a way of life.''

   Right-wing whites are
organizing and arming in a desperate effort to stop the government
from sharing power with the black majority.
   Their leaders are enraged by President F.W. de Klerk's plans to
end apartheid and say they will never accept a black government.
Both white and black leaders fear the right wing will provoke
violence that could endanger efforts to find a peaceful solution.
   While the pro-apartheid Conservative Party tries to force an
election to unseat de Klerk and his National Party, more radical
groups are arming for war.
   Extremists have raided government armories for guns, neo-Nazis
are organizing military units and ``White Wolf'' groups have
attacked blacks.
   ``We are preparing ourselves to meet the revolution that Mr.
Mandela's killers will start; it will be a holy war,'' extreme
right-wing leader Eugene TerreBlanche said in an interview,
referring to black leader Nelson Mandela.
   On May 26, about 50,000 whites attended a Conservative Party
rally in Pretoria to demand de Klerk's ouster. The crowd cheered
wildly when party leader Andries Treurnicht said whites never would
surrender political control.
   ``We shall not accept the threatened destruction of our nation's
freedoms, but will fight to restore that which has already been
unjustly given away,'' Treurnicht declared.
   De Klerk said the tactics could start a war between whites. ``The
Conservative Party's threats of revolt and resistance are
irresponsible, undemocratic and dangerous,'' he said two days after
the rally.
   Officials say a few hundred well-armed extremists with supporters
in the security services could launch a devastating terrorist
campaign, and attacks on blacks or government leaders could threaten
fragile peace negotiations.
   ``There is going to be violence,'' said a security official, who
would not let his name be used. ``The question is how much.''
   Mandela and other black leaders share the government's concern.
   ``Unless the state acts immediately to stop the recent wave of
right-wing attacks on black people, the whole peace process in this
country could be in jeopardy,'' said The New Nation newspaper, which
supports Mandela's African National Congress, the main black
opposition group.
   Many of South Africa's 5 million whites oppose plans to dismantle
apartheid, the official policy of racial segregation that preserves
their privileges and denies rights to the country's 28 million
blacks.
   A growing number of whites, stunned by reforms de Klerk has
introduced since assuming office last year, are turning to the
Conservative Party or more extreme organizations. They fear blacks
will seek retribution, and many possess weapons in a nation
sometimes described as ``awash with guns.''
   The Conservatives want whites to keep total control and blacks to
be given political rights in separate, tribal-based states. They say
de Klerk has betrayed whites, above all the dominant Afrikaners, who
are descended from Dutch settlers and account for 60 percent of the
white population.
   De Klerk legalized black opposition groups in February and has
promised to negotiate a new constitution that will lead to power
sharing with blacks.
   Treurnicht claims whites and blacks cannot live together as
equals because of cultural and other differences.
   ``Equal votes for blacks is disastrous in terms of racial and
political stability,'' he said in an interview.
   Like other right-wing leaders, Treurnicht insists Mandela and
other black nationalists are Communists. He claims Mandela and his
followers are waging war on whites.
   Mandela has ``disregarded the existence of the white nation in
South Africa,'' Treurnicht said. ``He does not intend to recognize
any white community. In a sense, that is a declaration of war on the
whites.''
   He says his Conservatives, who won 31 percent of the vote in
September's white elections, could win a whites-only election held
now. National Party officials admit privately the Conservatives
would stand a good chance.
   The Conservatives cannot force an election, however, and de Klerk
does not have to call one until 1994. The government hopes to carry
out its reforms before then and show whites they have nothing to
fear.
   Treurnicht, who holds a doctorate in religious philosophy,
disavows violence and says his party will achieve its goals through
the ballot box, but makes veiled threats of what could happen if it
does not succeed.
   ``We have told Mr. de Klerk you cannot expect a people to lie
down if you take away their rights,'' he said.
   More extreme organizations, such as the neo-Nazi Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, are preparing for what their leaders say is an
inevitable race war. The groups, which have thousands of members,
are forming private armies.
   ``I say to the government that, if you are going to sell out the
whites to the blacks in this unjust way, we are going to fight for
what is rightfully ours,'' Jaap Marais, leader of the Pure National
Party, said in an interview.
   About 300 members of the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, dressed
in khaki uniforms reminiscent of Nazi storm troopers, practiced
shooting, riot tactics and marching at a recent training session on
a farm outside Johannesburg.
   Women in uniforms were taught by former army instructors to use
pistols and shotguns. Children played while their parents trained,
and there were family picnics under the trees.
   Prof. Janis Grobbelaar, a political analyst, said the extremists
believe their survival is at stake, and ``these actions should not
be simply dismissed as those of lunatic fringes.''

<TEXT>
   Horst Marggraf scanned the meat section of an
East Berlin grocery store and dropped a brightly labeled package of
West German ham into his shopping cart.
   ``I don't normally buy West German meat, but I have relatives
coming,'' said Marggraf, 61.
   A month before the historic economic union of the Germanys, East
German consumers already are setting the stage for massive
unemployment with their preference for Western goods.
   Hundreds of thousands of workers are expected to lose their jobs
as the centrally planned economy is dismantled and individual
sectors are forced to compete with Western enterprises honed by the
laws of supply and demand.
   East German makers of electronics, clothing and household goods
have cut prices up to 90 percent in a desperate attempt to compete
with Western products that are considered far superior.
   Nowhere are the effects of competition more evident than in
grocery stores, where a flood of Western meat, potatoes, soups and
sausages is eroding the vast collective farm system that typifies
communism.
   Experts are conducting experiments as one of history's quickest
economic transitions takes place.
   ``We put East German yogurt in West German packaging, put it in
some stores and people bought it at a 3-1 rate to East
German-packaged yogurt,'' said Andries Kurjo, agriculture analyst
for the Institute for Inter-German Economic and Social Affairs in
West Berlin.
   ``Consumers were willing to pay three times as much and swore it
tasted better,'' he said.
   Kurjo, who spent 10 years analyzing East German agriculture for
the U.S. Embassy in East Berlin, said 20 percent to 30 percent of
the East German food industry had been lost to West German firms in
recent months.
   He estimated only one-third of the 3,800 collective farms could
make it without government subsidies.
   ``Only the best, those with the most flexible leaders, have the
possibility to survive,'' Kurjo said.
   Food began pouring in from the West in March, when the two East
German government agencies involved signed contracts with Western
distributors.
   About two-thirds of the East Berlin stores now sell Western meat,
vegetables, fruit, juice and milk.
   The sudden competition in what was a captive market has made
farmers perhaps the most rebellious segment of the work force.
   Thousands have blocked border crossings with their antiquated
tractors. They have rallied in major cities to demand limits on
imports and government help for their collectives.
   Nearly 900,000 East Germans, about 10 percent of the work force,
earn their livelihoods in agriculture.
   East Germany is to become a free market formally on July 2, when
its economy and social institutions are essentially absorbed by West
Germany in the most significant phase of German unification.
   Kurjo said agriculture makes up about 10 percent of the economy,
and about 40 percent of the average East German's paycheck is spent
on food.
   Western competition has led to a huge oversupply of domestic
agricultural products, he said. There have been reports of farmers
destroying crops and animals because of shrinking demand.
   At a farm near Merseburg, in the south, Hubert Hempel, 42, said
the operation was plagued by oversupply.
   ``We must slaughter small pigs because we cannot sell them and
cannot afford to feed them,'' he said.
   Under the old system, prices paid to farmers were artificially
high and those charged consumers were artificially low. The subsidy
amounted to 32 billion marks _ $9 billion _ a year, about 12 percent
of East Germany's budget.
   Collectives operated on the basis of guaranteed prices for their
products and guaranteed salaries for their workers.
   Farmers now find distributors will not buy at the artificially
high prices, and even with lower domestic prices, consumers still
favor Western products.
   Customers bought attractively packaged West German sausage for
3.99 East German marks in an East Berlin grocery store, even though
a larger quantity of East German sausage cost only 79 pfennigs,
about one-fifth as much.
   West German yogurt in a glossy plastic container adorned with
pictures of fruit sells for 2.55 marks, or 76 cents. East German
yogurt in a glass bottle with an ill-fitting lid costs 38 pfennigs,
11 cents.
   Like most East German enterprises, the collective farms employ
too many people for the amount of work to be done. Kurjo said the
average for a 6,000-acre farm was about 350 workers.
   ``They had a curious system of keeping as many people on their
farms as possible because the income paid by the government was
based on how many employees a collective had,'' he said.
   Harry Nebelung, a 51-year-old agricultural engineer in charge of
vegetable production on a collective in Saarmund, about 30 miles
south of Berlin, said his operation could thrive, but only if it
changed.
   ``We have too many people,'' he said. ``If we had larger
tractors, we wouldn't need them.''
   Kurjo said he was ``astonished'' to learn that most East German
farmers wanted to keep their collectives intact rather than become
owners of private farms.
   Unlike Western farms, whose owners often work seven days a week,
the collectives are run more like factories. Employees have a
43-hour week, with guaranteed holidays and sick days.
   ``They have been educated as specialists _ a feed mixer, a
milker,'' Kurjo said. ``They know nothing of the economy, which a
Western farmer must be expert in.''

   The Khmer Rouge failed to appear Monday at the
opening of peace talks aimed at ending Cambodia's 11-year-old civil
war, casting a cloud over the first international peace conference
in Japan since World War II.
   Khieu Samphan, nominal head of the Communist Khmer Rouge, later
said he didn't attend the talks ``because there are many problems.''
The Khmer Rouge poses the strongest military challenge to the
Vietnam-backed government of Premier Hun Sen.
   Samphan had appeared Sunday evening at a pre-conference banquet
and posed for a photograph with the leaders of other factions. He
said on arrival in Tokyo that he hoped to be able to sign a
cease-fire accord.
   But Hun Sen's government has refused to give the Khmer Rouge a
voice, blaming it for ``genocidal policies'' of the Khmer Rouge when
it held power from 1975 to 1979.
   Hun Sen said he would negotiate only with Sihanouk. In recent
weeks, fighting in Cambodia has intensified.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu on Monday greeted arriving
delegations from the Vietnam-backed Phnom Penh government of Premier
Hun Sen and the three-party guerrilla coalition led by Prince
Norodom Sihanouk at Akasaka Palace, Japan's state guest house.
   The talks started about 10 minutes late at 9:30 a.m. after some
hesitation and confusion over Samphan's absence.
   An official with the Khmer Rouge delegation, contacted at their
hotel, declined to explain what had happened. ``We are busy, and
cannot tell you,'' said the official, who did not give his name.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said the reason was not clear.
   While the talks started without him, Samphan and several aides
met for about 20 minutes with a key Thai mediator, Deputy Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who is here to observe the talks and
was instrumental in drafting the cease-fire pact.
   As the Khmer Rouge leader left the meeting, he told reporters he
hadn't attended the peace talks ``because there are many problems.''
He repeated that he had come to Tokyo to sign the cease-fire.
   ``I am waiting for that,'' he said, refusing to elaborate.
   The truce is expected to be disregarded, but the Tokyo talks are
still regarded as a stepping-stone to the possibility of political
progress to end the war.
   The Phnom Penh government hopes the talks also will cover an end
to arms supplies to the guerrilla factions, formation of a national
council to unite the Phnom Penh authorities and Sihanouk's
coalition, and arrangements for some form of international control
in Cambodia, said Hun Sen's spokesman, Chum Bun Rong.
   ``He hopes that we will succeed in this meeting, at least 99
percent. The one percent would be if the Khmer Rouge sabotages it,''
the spokesman said Sunday.
   The 67-year-old Sihanouk was accompanied to the talks by the
third member in his coalition, conservative former Premier Son Sann,
and Prince Ranariddh, Sihanouk's son.
   Talks aimed at settling the Cambodian conflict have had a bumpy
course since 1987 when Sihanouk and Hun Sen met in Paris. Sessions
have been held sporadically in Indonesia and Paris, pointing up how
difficult it is to bring the contenders together, much less get them
to agree.
   The next scheduled Cambodia peace talks are to be held in Paris
in July with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
   Sihanouk's government was ousted in 1970 in a military coup. The
prince allied himself with the Khmer Rouge, which took Phnom Penh in
1975 but then held him in house arrest while killing hundreds of
thousands of Cambodians.
   Vietnam invaded in late 1978, sending the Khmer Rouge back into
the jungles, and the country has been in a state of civil war since.
Hanoi claims that it took all its forces out of the country in
September, though there are charges that Vietnamese troops are still
supporting the Hun Sen government.

   ``City of Angels,'' a jazzy, satire of 1940s
Hollywood and hardboiled detective fiction, won the Tony Award
Sunday night as best musical of the 1989-90 Broadway season.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' an adaptation by Frank Galati of the
John Steinbeck novel about Dust Bowl Okies, beat out August Wilson's
``The Piano Lesson'' for best play. The production by Chicago's
Steppenwolf Theater Company also won a directing Tony for Galati.
   In accepting his award, Galati paid tribute to Steinbeck's widow,
Elaine, ``and the enduring genius of her husband, John.''
   ``City of Angels'' picked up a total of six awards, more than any
other production. James Naughton, the musical's macho detective
hero, was named best actor, and cracked, ``How sweet it is,'' when
he claimed his award.
   The show also won a featured actress prize for Randy Graff, who
plays a love-starved secretary in the show. ``City of Angels'' also
collected prizes for best book of a musical _ Larry Gelbart _ and
best score for composer Cy Coleman and lyricist David Zippel as well
as the set design award for Robin Wagner.
   Tommy Tune scored twice for ``Grand Hotel,'' picking up awards
for direction of a musical and choreography. ``I am very proud to be
part of such a sparkling season on Broadway,'' he said.
   Robert Morse withstood some stiff competition, including Dustin
Hoffman and Charles S. Dutton, to win the actor prize for his
performance in ``Tru,'' based on the life of writer Truman Capote.
   ``I'm just so grateful to be back here,'' Morse said. Morse last
won a Tony in 1962 for ``How to Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying.''
   As expected, Maggie Smith won the best actress prize for her
portrayal of an eccentric tour guide in ``Lettice &amp; Lovage.''
   Also no surprise was the best actress-musical award to Tyne Daly
for her portrayal of Mama Rose in a revival of ``Gypsy.'' ``I've got
30 seconds for a 36-year-old fantasy,'' exulted Miss Daly who was
making her first appearance on Broadway. ``Gypsy'' also took the
best revival prize.
   Michael Jeter, who plays a timid bookkeeper in ``Grand Hotel,''
won for featured actor in a musical. In an emotional speech, Jeter,
a popular choice, told the audience, ``You are my heart,'' as the
crowd cheered.
   Charles Durning, who plays Big Daddy in a revival of Tennessee
Williams' ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'' won for featured actor in a
play, while Margaret Tyzack, the prim employer of Maggie Smith in
``Lettice &amp; Lovage'' was named best featured actress.
   The other technical awards were taken by ``Grand Hotel,'' for the
costumes of Santo Loquasto and the lighting of Jules Fisher.
   Alfred Drake, the robust baritone of such Broadway hits as
``Oklahoma!'', ``Kiss Me, Kate'' and ``Kismet,'' was awarded a
special Tony honor for excellence. The Seattle Repertory Theater was
given the Tony for outstanding regional theater.
   The 1989-90 season was one of the best in recent years. Compared
with the previous season, which produced only one big musical _
``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' _ and one big play _ ``The Heidi
Chronicles,'' this year brought more than enough candidates for most
Tony categories.
   In fact, several likely candidates for nominations were ignored,
including Vanessa Redgrave for ``Orpheus Descending'' and the trio
of stars from the revival of W. Somerset Maugham's ``The Circle'' _
Glynis Johns, Stewart Granger, and the late Rex Harrison, who died
of cancer Saturday, less than a month after his last performance in
the play.

   The Antoinette Perry Awards, known as the Tonys, were founded in
1947 by the American Theater Wing. The awards show, held this year
at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and televised on CBS, was presented by
the wing and the League of American Theaters and Producers.
   The nominees were chosen by a 12-person committee ranging from
lyricist Sheldon Harnick to producer Jean Dalrymple to Rosetta
LeNoire, artistic director of the AMAS Repertory Theater. The
winners were chosen by more than 700 voters, mostly theater
professionals, critics and journalists.

<HEAD>Legislatures Taking Aim at Live Artists Who Aren't</HEAD>

   At many pop music concerts these days, a
listener can hear intricate horn riffs and vocal harmonies with no
brass in sight and only one singer at the microphone.
   The growing use of canned music and ``lip-syncing'' at concerts
has drawn the ire of lawmakers in New York and New Jersey, who say
listeners should be told if the live performances they're paying for
aren't entirely live.
   The lawmakers are going after big names. Artists like Madonna and
Milli Vanilli are among those who have been accused of augmenting
their live shows with tapes.
   ``The more we get into it, the more I hear it's very prevalent,''
said Democratic Assemblyman Joseph Mecca, who proposed the New
Jersey bill.
   The New Jersey bill would require concert promoters to warn
ticket buyers in advertisements and on ticket stubs if an artist is
using recordings in place of live lead vocals.
   New York's bill, sponsored by Republican state Sen. Eugene Levy,
goes even further. It would require disclosures in advertisements
for all music that has been recorded or otherwise reproduced.
   Lip-syncing isn't particularly new. Neither are musical tapes _
artists as diverse as James Taylor, David Byrne and Sinead O'Connor
have sang onstage with only a tape player behind them.
   It's complicated, however, by technology like synthesizers,
samplers and drum machines that give hit songs a highly mechanized
sound that can't be duplicated cheaply, if at all, by live musicians.
   Carl Freed, executive director of the North American Concert
Promoters Association, estimated that 90 percent of the rock or rap
artists out on the road either use tapes or reproduce instruments
through synthesizers.
   Dance pop duo Milli Vanilli, winners of this year's Grammy for
best new artist, speak in heavily accented English between songs but
sing with amazing clarity in concert, said Chris Willman, a pop
music critic for the Los Angeles Times. He says it's clear they're
faking.
   A spokesman for Arista Records, the duo's label, said, ``There is
some use of backing vocals on tape. Lead vocals are live ... The
band is playing live.'' The spokesman refused to give his name for
attribution.
   It's a touchy subject in the music business. Admitting to an
extensive use of tapes shows an inherent deception about what's
advertised as a live show.
   ``Most people _ a vast majority of people _ don't care,'' Freed
said. ``But when it comes to people who lip-sync 100 percent of
their shows, people do care. They feel ripped off.''
   But those cases are unusual. And promoters complain that the New
York bill doesn't differentiate between a complete miming act and
occasional augmentation.
   In her current tour, Madonna does a duet with a dancer who
lip-syncs a song that Warren Beatty sang on Madonna's new album.
   The Rascals, who recorded ``Good Lovin''' in the 1960s, can't
afford a horn section on the road so they use a synthesizer to
duplicate horn riffs on some songs, said their manager, Keith Beccia.
   Beccia said the New York bill would leave many bands with several
unpleasant options _ cut their hits from the show, turn off tapes or
simply avoid playing in New York altogether.
   Freed called the bills another attack on artistic freedom on an
industry already reeling from a public scrap about parental warning
labels on albums that use explicit lyrics.
   Both lawmakers say they're not trying to prevent artists from
using tapes, but just want them to be upfront about it.
   ``I would be very disappointed if (Paul) McCartney decided he
wanted to do a little bit more dancing on stage and started to use
tapes,'' Mecca said. ``I would want my money back, to tell you the
truth. But I wasn't reared on MTV.''
   Promoters say the ticket-buying public should decide whether
canned music is good or bad. If people don't like it, they won't
come to the shows, Freed said.
   ``I don't think it takes away from the effect of the show,''
Freed said. ``I think it adds to it. They're trying to give kids a
reproduction of what they see on MTV _ so they don't have to hear an
artist breathing hard while they're doing dance routines.''

   Midwesterners mourning neighbors killed in a deadly barrage of
tornadoes were hit Sunday by a second onslaught of thunderstorms and
high winds that raised the weekend weather death toll to 13.
   Wind-toppled trees on Sunday killed a camper in Wisconsin and an
8-year-old boy in a town park in Indiana, the state that bore the
brunt of the fierce weather that began Saturday night.
   Across Indiana, officials reported eight dead and at least 150
people injured Saturday in the state's worst tornado outbreak since
1974. The storms left 24 cities in 15 counties with significant
damage. Officials tracked about 50 tornado touchdowns during a
four-hour period.
   In Illinois, a tornado Saturday destroyed or damaged scores of
houses and killed one woman. Also Saturday, 10-year-old boy drowned
in a storm-swollen river in Milwaukee and an 82-year-old man was
killed by a wind-blown tree branch in the northwestern Missouri town
of Stewartsville.
   Twisters or high winds downed trees, knocked out power and
damaged homes and businesses from Kansas to Michigan and Ohio. In
Arkansas, thunderstorms dumped heavy rain, causing flash flooding
that closed roads.
   In the second round of deadly weather Sunday, high winds at a
campground in Rocky Arbor State Park in south-central Wisconsin
toppled a tree onto a tent, killing a 21-year-old woman and injuring
another woman in the tent with her another, according to the Juneau
County Sheriff's Department. The injured woman, 24, was hospitalized
in fair condition.
   In the central Indiana town of Mulberry, a 60-foot-tall felled by
80 mph wind blew down on three boys who were visiting Centennial
Park for a picnic, said Town Marshal Bruce Welton. The freak
accident killed an 8-year-old boy and left a 7-year-old boy in
critical condition and a 10-year-old boy in guarded condition,
hospital officials said.
   Severe thunderstorms and at least one tornado raked central
Indiana on Sunday, downing trees and powerlines, but no serious
damage or injuries were immediately reported.
   Clouds of black dust sucked from freshly-plowed fields by 40 mph
winds created blackouts on highways in the northern part of the
state, causing an 18-car pileup on U.S. Highway 31 outside South
Bend. Five people suffered minor injuries, police said.
   The most disastrous of the many tornadoes to touch down Saturday
ripped through the southwestern Indiana town of Petersburg, killing
six and leaving hundreds homeless just two weeks after floods
knocked out the town's fresh water supply.
   The other Indiana tornado deaths were in Bedford, in the southern
part of the state, and in Putnam County in west-central Indiana,
said Jerome Hauer, director of the State Emergency Management
Agency. Hauer, who was unable to provide details of the deaths, said
said his staff had received reports that 150 people were injured
statewide.
   Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh toured Petersburg and Bedford and viewed
other damage from the air on Sunday.
   At least 150 homes and 18 businesses in Petersburg were destroyed
and 120 homes and 58 businesses were damaged when the storm ripped a
five-mile path through town, said Al Miller, field operations
coordinator for the State Emergency Management Agency. At least 57
people were injured.
   ``The tornado clearly cut right through the middle of town,''
Bayh said. ``It looked to me like there had been a bombing run made
right through the middle of Petersburg.''
   Residents of the mining and farming community of 3,000 had been
without fresh water for two weeks because of flooding that tore
through levees along the White River and severed the water main. A
temporary pipeline carries water from a nearby power plant, but it
was unsafe to drink without boiling first.
   The Rev. Jeff Stratton said the townspeople had kept their sense
of humor despite the added hardship.
   ``I've joked with some friends here that I've heard from reliable
sources that tomorrow it's frogs and locusts,'' he said.
   Petersburg resident Keith Burch had just sat on the couch when
the tornado hit. He said he had no idea what was happening.
   ``The windows blew in and I started crawling into the bedroom,''
he said. ``The refrigerator blew up against me and pinned me against
the wall. That's probably what saved me. The rest of the house blew
in.''
   Elsewhere over the weekend:
   _ In Illinois, 30 homes were destroyed and at least 70 damaged in
Jasper County, while Shelby County reported 12 homes demolished and
26 others damaged. A 54-year-old Edwards County woman was killed
when a twister destroyed her home.
   _ In Ohio, a tornado damaged 100 houses homes and some 50
businesses in Harrison, outside Cincinnati, and up to 20 houses and
10 businesses destroyed, police Sgt. Carl Butler said. No serious
injuries were reported. At least 30 airplanes were damaged or
destroyed and one of three hangars was flattened at the Cincinnati
West Airport in Harrison, said Tim McKenna, whose family owned the
airport.
   _In Wisconsin, several thousand residents of Fond du Lac, an
eastern Wisconsin city of 36,000, were temporarily without electric
service as tree limbs tore down transmission lines. In Milwaukee,
searchers Sunday found the body of a boy, 10, who slipped into the
Menomonee River shortly after storms swept through the area the
previous evening.
   _In Minnesota, thunderstorms with wind gusts up to 70 mph and
hail moved across southeastern and east-central parts of the state.
A tornado damaged four farms Saturday one mile east of Goodhue in
southeastern Minnesota, but no injuries were reported.
   _ In Kentucky, tornadoes struck several counties, damaging homes,
tossing mobile homes, downing trees and knocking out power. At least
five people were injured, none seriously.
   _ In Michigan, a tornado touched down in Big Prairie Township,
damaging some of the many vacation trailers in an area where many
retirees live, said Newaygo County sheriff's dispatcher Bob Bain. No
injuries were reported, and authorities were unable to provide
detailed description of the damage.
   More than 110,000 homes and businesses were blacked out Sunday
because powerlines were downed by thunderstorms and high wind that
hit the state late Saturday and early Sunday.
   _ In Kansas, winds that reached 70 mph tore roofs from homes
throughout the city of Hutchinson. Downed power lines knocked out
power to nearly 50,000 homes and sparked grass fires.

   Jane Fonda says her current beau, cable king Ted
Turner, wasted no time phoning her up after reading last year about
her breakup with husband Tom Hayden.
   ``He wanted to know if I was available to date,'' Fonda said in
an interview in the June 11 issue of People magazine. ``I think I
said I wasn't feeling so hot, that he was an interesting guy, too,
but I wasn't feeling peppy.''
   Fonda and Turner eventually met, but she and Italian soccer
player Lorenzo Caccialanza were dating at the time, the magazine
said. Turner, whose holdings include CNN and the Atlanta Braves,
waited until that relationship ended to make a move, People said.
   Turner, 51, was uncharacteristically reticent about his
relationship with Fonda, 52.
   ``It's hard to have your dating life dissected,'' he told the
magazine.
   Turner did say he works out more now that he dates Fonda, who has
made a series of exercise videos. And Fonda occasionally
participates in some of Turner's favorite hobbies _ fly fishing and
turkey hunting.
   ``Ted is extremely knowledgeable about wildlife,'' Fonda said.

   Robert Redford urged a new crop of university
graduates to force politicians into ending a decade of ``naked greed
and profit at the expense of the environment.''
   The actor and longtime environmental activist spoke Saturday at
commencement ceremonies on the Boston campus of the University of
Massachusetts.
   ``It is time to send a message to our elected officials that if
they do not protect our environment they will be voted out of office
or never get elected in the first place,'' Redford said.
   Redford said the 1980s were devastating for the environment.
   ``Never can I remember a time of such naked greed and profit at
the expense of the environment as the last decade,'' he said.
   Redford, who received an honorary doctorate of science degree,
criticized President Bush for failing to follow up on campaign
promises to improve the environment.
   ``I don't think we need to wait around anymore for something to
come from the top,'' he told 2,400 graduating seniors and their
guests. ``It ain't gonna happen. I don't want to be told, `read my
lips' when the lips aren't saying anything.''

   Five-time national speedboat champion Al
Copeland says he hasn't raced in more than a year because of fried
chicken.
   Copeland owns Popeyes Fried Chicken and borrowed nearly $500
million last year to gobble up competitor Church's Fried Chicken.
But Copeland's new creditors didn't want him to race his boat as
long as his debt was outstanding.
   ``The lenders didn't want to risk something happening to me and
asked that I not race for a while,'' Copeland said. ``It was a
handshake deal ... worse than signing a contract because there
aren't any loopholes.''
   Copeland, who won the world superboat title in 1986 and has won
the national superboat crown five times, said he'd like to
participate in the Popeyes Offshore Racefest on Saturday. But actor
and martial arts expert Chuck Norris will step in if lenders
persuade Copeland to stay on land.
   Actors Don Johnson and Kurt Russell also are expected to race.

   Talk of Tom Lasorda jumping from Los Angeles

manager for another two years.
   ``They told me they wanted me to come back and I told them I
wanted to come back more than they wanted me back,'' Lasorda said
Sunday. ``I'm the happiest guy in the world.''
   Lasorda, 62, has been with the Dodgers baseball organization for
41 years. He's been manager since 1977.
   Rumors began less than a week ago that he would become manager of
the Mets. But Dodgers President Peter O'Malley and general manager
Fred Claire decided to give Lasorda a two-year contract extension,
through 1992.

   South African journalist Donald Woods says the
United States suffers from a ``cult of conservative selfishness''
that propels ``salesmen'' into public office.
   Woods, who wrote the biography of anti-apartheid activist Steven
Biko, gave the keynote address Saturday on the Boston campus of the
University of Massachusetts.
   Woods, who lived in exile for 12 years, said American economic
sanctions against his homeland contributed in part to Nelson
Mandela's release.
   ``I have always had faith that once the mass of Americans know
the facts they end up doing the right thing,'' said Woods, who
received an honorary Doctors of Humane Letters degree.
   He railed against the ``cult of conservative selfishness'' in
America, which he said propelled to office people who promise
short-term gains, ``salesmen instead of statesmen.''
   Still, Woods has hopes for young people in the United States.
   ``I sense that young Americans ... seem to be snapping out of the
blight of conservatism of the past 10 years and to be keen on
rejoining the real world, and on that I base my hopes for the
world,'' Woods said.

   Whether confronting protesters, fencing with
reporters, wading into friendly crowds or wooing the high and mighty
of the capitalist world, the traveling Mikhail Gorbachev wields
personal charm as a strategic weapon.
   In Canada, a Lithuanian army deserter spoke to the Soviet
president for two minutes _ and came away convinced he saw sympathy
in Gorbachev's eyes.
   In Washington, Gorbachev lectured congressional leaders like
schoolboys _ and at least one was caught by TV cameras nodding in
apparent agreement.
   And in the heartland Sunday, a beaming Gorbachev plunged into
crowds to shake hands and chat, and turned the charm on businessmen
as well.
   Arriving at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport, he
immediately waded into a crowd.
   ``My camera jammed just as he was standing right there,'' said
Christopher Morgan, an Air Force reservist. ``But ... I'll have that
etched on my memory.''
   Later, Secret Service agents had to run to catch up with
Gorbachev when he crossed a street to chat with Minnesotans. People
climbed on portable toilets for a better view.
   Roger Moe, Democratic majority leader in the Minnesota Senate,
shook Gorbachev's hand, then pulled out a pocket camera and took his
picture.
   Supporters in Minnesota shouted ``Gorby! Gorby!'' Crowds held
signs reading, ``We love Mikhail, Raisa,'' ``Mr. Gorbachev is a Cool
Dude'' and ``Give Gorbachev the Nobel Peace Prize.''
   Since he rose to power in 1985, Gorbachev has made spontaneous
forays into crowds a trademark. On virtually every trip abroad or
into the Soviet countryside, he makes at least one impromptu
``walkabout.''
   With his popularity waning at home as panicked shoppers empty
shelves in advance of price rises, he appeared to relish the warmth
of Americans and Canadians on his latest trip.
   Before his summit in Washington with President Bush, the
59-year-old Gorbachev stopped in Ottawa for talks with Canadian
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   He spent an hour strolling along a pedestrian mall, chatting with
people behind police barricades, first on one side of the street,
then on the other, depending on which screamed louder and who
managed to catch his attention with a sign, a book or a T-shirt.
   In Washington, he hung out of his black Zil limousine to wave at
people lining the streets, no doubt worrying his KGB and Secret
Service guards.
   He told people he met that he felt ``really at home.'' In one
sidewalk conversation, he said, ``All people want a better tomorrow.
And the rest is not too important.''
   He fielded the same political questions, never losing patience
with those challenging his stance on Lithuania or asking about his
declining popularity at home.
   In return, he asked either simple, direct questions _ ``What is
your job? How much do you earn? Is it enough?'' _ or ones that would
seem to require reflection, such as ``Are you successful in life?''
and ``What is your source of happiness?''
   When a man in Ottawa asked whether the situation in Russia was so
bad that its leaders had to go abroad to find cheering crowds,
Gorbachev laughed good-naturedly before answering that his
popularity abroad reflected the changes in the Soviet Union, not
vice versa.
   Imre Sooar, a 21-year-old Lithuanian who defected to Canada after
he was drafted last year, startled Gorbachev by yelling in Russian,
``Come on, why not give the Baltics their freedom?'' Gorbachev,
surrounded by 20 security men, instantly veered in Sooar's
direction, and the two began a spirited conversation.
   While still skeptical of the Kremlin's intentions, Sooar said
later: ``We looked into each other's eyes, and I got the feeling he
was trying to tell me something. ... It's pretty obvious he is in a
difficult position right now, but I felt he would like to give us
our freedom.''
   At a meeting in the Soviet Embassy in Washington on Friday,
Gorbachev upbraided congressional leaders. ``We cannot wait for
Congress and congressional leadership to mature'' and extend trade
privileges to the Soviet Union, he said. ``Congress is a problem, so
think about it.''
   Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., was shown on TV
nodding as Gorbachev criticized Israel for settling Soviet
immigrants in the occupied territories.
   A news conference in Washington on Sunday was sprinkled with
moments of humor. When a Soviet journalist asked Gorbachev about his
problems with political nemesis Boris Yeltsin, he replied, ``I don't
think you have chosen the best place for clarifying our internal
problems. But c'est la vie, as they say.''
   In Minneapolis, Gorbachev urged some of the United States'
captains of industry to help with his country's radical economic
reforms. His audience included the heads of Anheuser-Busch Co.,
Pepsico, Amoco Corp. and Dow Chemical Co.
   ``His charisma overcomes a lot of skepticism _ even mine,'' said
Dwight Opperman, president of West Publishing, a St. Paul-based
law-book publisher with 4,000 employees.

   Thirty-one years ago, Elizabeth Garst sat on
the lap of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev at her grandfather's
farm in central Iowa and listened with rapt attention.
   Sunday afternoon, she listened to another Soviet leader, Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, with equal interest.
   ``I was as thrilled as I was the first time,'' said Garst, now
39. ``I think Gorbachev is a fabulous leader. He is remarkable in
history for leading such dramatic reform.''
   Garst, chairperson and chief operating officer of the Racoon
Valley State Bank in Adel, Iowa, was one of only two women among the
145 people invited to Gorbachev's meeting with business and
agriculture leaders.
   Her grandfather, the late Roswell Garst, was host to Khrushchev
in his 1959 visit to Iowa. A photograph of the 9-year-old girl
bouncing on the Soviet leader's knee was widely distributed.
   Another member of the Garst family, Iowa banker John Chrystal,
was seeking to benefit from the Gorbachev visit.
   Chrystal, Roswell Garst's nephew, is in a heated three-way battle
for the Iowa Democratic gubernatorial nomination. The winner of
Tuesday's primary will face incumbent Terry Branstad in November.
   Chrystal, 64, has visited the Soviet Union every other year since
1960 and has known Gorbachev for nine years.

   A volcano on the uninhabited Aleutian island of
Kiska erupted for the first time since 1969, spewing steam and ash
thousands of feet into the sky over the Bering Sea.
   Witnesses at a U.S. Navy transmitter station on Amchitka Island,
about 60 miles east of Kiska, said they saw steam blowing from the
4,000-foot volcano Friday morning and watched for a few hours before
weather obscured the view.
   ``As far as magnitude, it doesn't seem to be a major explosive
event,'' said Victoria Avery, a scientist at the Alaska Volcano
Observatory.
   The last eruption noted at Kiska Volcano, one of 40 active
volcanoes in the Aleutians, lasted six days in September 1969,
officials said.
   The uninhabited island, occupied by the Japanese in World War II
and later made a national historic landmark, is near the western end
of the Aleutian chain stretching from Alaska toward the Soviet Union.

   Thirteen-year-old Lisa Watson welcomed Raisa
Gorbachev into her ``typical'' American family's home for a chat
around the dining table Sunday, and ended up with a new pen pal.
   ``I told her that I would like to go back to Moscow. She seemed
very happy about that and she gave me her address so I could write
her,'' Lisa said after the Watsons shared coconut macaroons and
talked about family matters with the Soviet first lady.
   An estimated 6,000 people jammed yards, sidewalks and streets and
even climbed trees for a better view of Mrs. Gorbachev as she
arrived at the home of Steve and Karen Watson, their four children
and their dog.
   Lisa, in a red and white striped dress, waited with her mother on
the sidewalk for Mrs. Gorbachev's motorcade. Lisa gave Mrs.
Gorbachev a hug and a bouquet before introducing her to her family.
   The chat around the dining room table was supposed to have lasted
20 minutes, but Mrs. Gorbachev stayed an hour, skipping a trip to a
computer manufacturer.
   In a news conference in their front yard, the Watsons said Mrs.
Gorbachev was warm and put them at ease right away. ``She had all of
the press people sit on the floor and said, `Let's have a private
chat,''' Mrs. Watson said.
   The Watsons gave Mrs. Gorbachev two books, stories that the
Children's Theater had performed, as well as a family photo album
and some drawings.
   In return, Mrs. Gorbachev gave them a blue and white ceramic
serving pot, candy and books of Russian stories written in English.
   The Watsons were chosen partly because Lisa performed in Moscow
last year in an exchange between the Children's Theater Co. of
Minneapolis and a Moscow children's theater. Jon Cranney, artistic
director of the Children's Theater Co., recommended the Watsons to
Gov. Rudy Perpich's staff as a typical, middle-class family.
   Lisa appeared in the ABC miniseries filmed in the Twin Cities,
``The Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase.'' Her 11-year-old
sister, Stephanie, appeared in a 1987 Guthrie Theater production.
Mrs. Watson, 38, is an obstetric nurse. Her 39-year-old husband
teaches art at an elementary school in Eden Prairie. The family also
includes brothers Tom, 7, and Will, 6, and their dog, Bonnie, who is
part golden retriever and part Irish setter
   Jane Mullen, a neighbor, said the Watsons ``are maybe average in
terms of income, but they are not average people.'' She said the
Watsons spend more time with their children.
   ``I think the way they live their lives is a real value
statement,'' Ms. Mullen said. ``They are the kind of family you like
to portray.''
   Before arriving at the Watson home, Mrs. Gorbachev picked up
macadamia nuts, Super Mario Brothers Nintendo bubblegum and insight
into the capitalist system during surprise visits to a Mexican
``takeout'' and Snyder's drugstore.
   At the drugstore, she quizzed employees about their jobs. ``Does
your salary depend on the merchandise you sell?'' she asked through
an interpreter.
   She also was curious about the vacation time drugstore workers
were given, asked about the contents of a Snickers bar and inquired
into the differences between expensive and inexpensive nail polish.
She also asked if the store carried French perfume.

<HEAD>Fate of Trade Deal Seen Tied to Lithuania Though Bush Says
Otherwise</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Bush quote in 12th graf is cq</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev emerged from the summit
with the trade agreement he wants, but members of Congress say it
won't do him any good until he relaxes his pressure on breakaway
Lithuania.
   In fact, a leading House Democrat said Sunday that President Bush
can expect challenges from Congress on how he handled the
U.S.-Soviet summit in general.
   ``In other words, is the Congress of the United States going to
ratify the Bush approach to the Soviet Union, which is not to jam it
to them while they're weak, to lay back a little bit, not to try to
squeeze every drop out of that lemon?'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
   Aspin, appearing on NBC-TV, said that even before Bush signed the
trade pact Gorbachev desperately sought, the American president
faced a ``growing unhappiness'' from right-leaning Republicans who
see Bush's actions as too conciliatory towards the Soviets.
   ``The pot has been stirred up even more'' by pushing trade
without obtaining concessions on Lithuania and ``delinking'' the two
issues, Aspin said.
   ``It's going to be an interesting, interesting time,'' said
Aspin. He predicted ``potential problems'' as well over an agreement
banning production and reducing stockpiles of chemical weapons.
Critics say the pact is unverifiable.
   Even before Bush okayed the trade deal, conditioned on a
loosening of Soviet emigration law, members of Congress served
notice they wouldn't allow the Soviet Union to become a
most-favored-nation trading partner until Gorbachev ends his
economic squeeze on Lithuania.
   ``MFN's a possibility but so is snow,'' Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan., said a week ago. The most-favored-nation
designation qualifies a trading partner for the lowest U.S. tariffs.
   Last month, the Senate, with Bush's GOP colleagues leading the
way, passed a non-binding resolution seeking to halt any U.S.-Soviet
trade agreements while the crackdown on Lithuania continues. The
vote was 73-24.
   Moscow slapped an embargo halting food and fuel supplies to
Lithuania after the Baltic republic declared independence on March
11.
   Bush, in an end-of-summit joint press conference with Gorbachev,
said his decision to conditionally grant Moscow trade benefits had
nothing to do with Lithuania.
   ``The linkage is between the emigration _ and that's it,'' Bush
declared.
   Bush had barely waved goodbye to Gorbachev when his chief of
staff, John Sununu, put it differently in an ABC television
interview. ``There is no way the president of the United States is
not going to consider a whole host of issues as he determines
whether or not to send'' the trade deal to Congress, Sununu said on
``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a former chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said what happens to the trade
agreement _ once it is sent to Congress _ hinges on a number of
decisions facing the Kremlin in a period of turmoil.
   ``Members of Congress ... would be watching what goes on back in
the Soviet Union and how they work it out in the next few weeks,''
he said.
   Earlier, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said
``some rather modest changes in his (Gorbachev's) policy toward the
Baltic states'' could convince Congress to approve trade benefits.
   Meantime, Lithuania President Vytautas Landsbergis said Sunday
that he hopes to sign a trade agreement with the republic of Russia,
now headed by populist reformer Boris Yeltsin. Yeltsin is considered
Gorbachev's political
   nemesis.
   Bush said he was blunt with Gorbachev about U.S. support for
self-determination of the Baltic states, and he was ``encouraged to
see discussions going on over there between various leaders.''
   But he said the Soviet leader provided no assurances that he
would lift the embargo against Lithuania. The Soviets say
independence can only be attained through a drawn-out process
involving a referendum.
   While Bush insisted it was in the United States' best interest to
sign the trade deal, he acknowledged that Congress shares a role in
deciding its fate.
   ``We've got a Congress that has its rights,'' he said. ``They
have every right to look at what I've signed and every obligation to
do that, and make their judgment as to whether it's in the best
interests.''
   Unlike a treaty which requires ratification by a two-thirds vote
of the Senate, the trade pact is an executive agreement which
requires approval by a majority of the House and Senate.
   One of the most vocal senators in the drive to tie trade to
Lithuania is Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who said there will be
``one tough battle'' in the Senate on trade unless the economic
embargo on Lithuania is lifted.
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., argued last month that it was
pointless to link the issues.
   ``We need to be encouraging trade with the Soviet Union and other
countries,'' he said. ``This is not some favor we are granting the
Soviets. We are the world's largest debtor nation.''

   Here are unresolved summit issues the
superpowers will be addressing in the coming months through formal
negotiations:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Strategic Arms: The leaders failed to removed three key
obstacles to completing a treaty reducing long-range nuclear
weapons. These include constraints on testing a new version of the
Soviet SS-18 heavy missile, limits on the Soviet Backfire bomber and
prohibitions on transferring strategic arms to third countries. The
Strategic Arms Reduction Talks are to resume in Geneva on June 11.
   _Conventional Arms: Little progress was recorded on issues
related to the Conventional Forces in Europe negotiations, which aim
to sharply reduce levels of troops, tanks and other non-nuclear
armaments. These talks, involving 23 nations, are continuing this
summer in Vienna with a goal of finishing by year's end.
   _Germany: No compromise was reached between the U.S. position
that a reunited Germany have membership in NATO and the Soviet
demand that it not. Secretary of State James Baker is scheduled to
resume discussing the matter with his Soviet counterpart in
Copenhagen on Tuesday, and formal talks between the two Germanies
and the four victorious World War II allies are to resume in Berlin
on June 22.

   When Morris Udall, environmentalist chairman of
the House Interior Committee for nearly a quarter century, announced
plans to retire, some people asked what that would mean to the
protection of public land.
   Also, could a man who has been a leader in Congress, despite a
long battle with Parkinson's disease, be happy outside the
legislative process?
   Udall apparently is ready to pass the torch _ after one more term
in the House.
   ``I've spent thousands of hours working to protect American lands
and create national parks,'' said Udall. ``I regret I have not been
able to spend a lot of time in those areas.''
   He said he wants to take his bride, the former Norma Gilbert whom
he married last year, to see the parks. ``I would like to pitch a
tent and stay for a while.''
   Udall, 67, announced last month that he will retire at the end of
1992, and Capitol observers believe he means it. Re-election this
year should be no problem.
   For 11 years, the congressman has battled a disease that leaves
one's mind intact, but savagely attacks muscular reactions, reducing
the once upright and active former pro basketball player to a
stooped-over old man.
   Yet Udall's refusal to surrender to the illness led people to
believe he would never leave Congress voluntarily.
   ``I am always reluctant to write out a specific agenda,'' said
Udall, but he added that before he leaves, ``There are a few key
areas where I can play a positive role.''
   He said he wants to participate in the debate on campaign finance
reform. He serves on a House task force that will handle the
legislation now being debated by the Senate.
   He also said he wants to see the American Heritage Trust bill
passed to assure a permanent trust fund for federal acquisition of
lands and to improve recreational areas.
   Before leaving as the most senior and powerful member of the
Arizona delegation, Udall also plans to oversee a few more
appropriations for the Central Arizona Project, a federally funded
canal still under construction that provides water to arid areas of
the state.
   The project is expected to be completed soon and Udall has said
he wants to be in Congress when the water finally flows to Tucson.
   ``I've spent a lot of time on that effort and my parents always
taught me to finish what I start,'' said the congressman.
   Once he's in retirement, Udall says he'll write another book.
   ``My latest, `Too Funny to be President,' was only one-third of
my collection of jokes and stories,'' he said.
   Udall was elected to the House from Arizona's second district in
1961 to replace his brother, Stewart, who was appointed interior
secretary by President Kennedy. He has been Interior Committee
chairman since 1977.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., is heir-apparent to the job.
   ``Miller already has been taking over leadership,'' said Rindy
O'Brien of the Wilderness Society. ``Miller has a very keen
environmental interest. He's a hard fighter. Same as Mo.''
   One of the most productive politicians of his generation, Udall
also is perhaps the most popular among his colleagues. His unusual
ability to bring enemies into agreement over legislation has gained
him admiration from all parts of the political spectrum.
   ``We will miss having Mo there because he was always someone you
could count on,'' said O'Brien.

   When former Iowa Sen. Dick Clark launched the
Aspen Institute's congressional retreats five years ago, he chose a
site not too far from Washington _ North Carolina's Eastern Shore.
   ``It was just a damned disaster, to be honest,'' he said. ``It
was money wasted.''
   The lawmakers came late and left early because of changing events
in Washington, just a short flight away. ``And when they were there
they were constantly on the phone with their offices,'' he said.
   So Clark searched the globe for a solution _ and found several.
   ``I found if I took people out of the country and invited the
spouses I could get people to come,'' he said.
   Indeed, the latest financial disclosure forms of House members
show the trips sponsored by the Aspen Institute are a favorite of
the select group of lawmakers asked to serve on the group's panels
on U.S. relations with the Soviet Union, southern Africa and
Indochina.
   But the Aspen Institute is far from alone in bankrolling the
travels of members of Congress. The House records show members took
hundreds of free trips last year, visiting world capitals, tropical
islands and some of the nation's finest resorts.
   And while on the road, many members also picked up thousands of
dollars in honoraria. But the value of the trips appeared in most
cases to be worth more than the $2,000 or so paid for speeches.
   This is the last year House members can accept honoraria. But in
eliminating that perk last year, the House did not restrict the
trips lawmakers can take at the expense of labor unions, trade
associations and other interest groups that have substantial
legislative interests.
   Other sponsors, like the Aspen Institute, are non-partisan think
tanks whose seminars are praised by members of Congress and other
participants.
   The itinerary for the 1989 Aspen retreats went like this: Jamaica
in January, Bermuda in March, a mountain retreat in Switzerland in
August, followed weeks later by several days in Dubrovnik,
Yugoslavia. The four seminars cost the foreign policy organization
$1 million.
   ``I take them nice places and I think they enjoy themselves,''
Clark said in a telephone interview. ``But we really work hard and
long.''
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., said her husband and most other
invited spouses skip the beach for the Aspen seminars ``because of
the caliber of the people they bring together.''
   ``Yes, we could not go to Jamaica,'' Johnson said, mindful of the
criticism some public interest groups direct at such travel. ``But
one of the values of leaving the country is focus. Your office isn't
constantly calling. Somebody isn't flying off for a quick speech.
And one of the ways to get members to come is providing them
something their families see as a pleasure.''
   While about two dozen members of Congress attended the five-day
Aspen conference in Jamaica, another 11 were elsewhere in the
Caribbean at a conference sponsored by New Jersey's Fairleigh
Dickinson University on the island of St. Croix.
   Trips that didn't take House members out of the country often
brought them to the nation's best resorts.
   Republican Rep. Tom Campbell of California was among the guests
of the American Bar Association at a meeting in Hawaii. Democratic
Reps. Joe Moakley of Massachusetts and Beryl Anthony of Arkansas
visited Nantucket in August for a National Association of Home
Builders gathering.
   Moakley also visited Puerto Rico at the expense of the National
Association of Government Employees union and was a guest of the
Securities Industries Association at the Boca Raton Beach Club in
Florida.
   A handful of House members reported free trips to participate in
charity golf tournaments.
   ``It's a respite we really enjoy,'' said Indiana Republican Dan
Burton, who participated in six tournaments last year.
   The House member with the most free trips in 1989, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder of Colorado, rarely got near the beach.
   Schroeder, who was reimbursed for more than 50 trips, did get
three nights in Hawaii to attend the ABA conference and spent a few
nights in Florida. But she was more likely to be found in Newark,
Des Moines or Minneapolis, speaking to conferences on family issues
or Democratic Party functions.
   ``She chooses her trips by topic not by climate,'' said Schroeder
spokeswoman Andrea Camp. ``And she has a lack of a tan to show for
it.''

   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo arrived
Sunday for an unprecedented meeting with Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev designed to promote normalized relations and trade.
   Roh met Sunday evening with former President Reagan, who, with
his wife, Nancy, is scheduled to have breakfast Monday with the
Soviet president and his wife, Raisa.
   Reagan and Roh met for 20 minutes, during which they discussed
improving Seoul's relations with Moscow and easing tensions in the
region.
   ``This meeting will be an important step towards bringing peace
to Northeast Asia and on the Korean Peninsula, thereby ending the
Cold War in that part of the world,'' Reagan said of Roh's planned
session with Gorbachev.
   Some 200 people, both supporters and opponents of the visit,
staged a noisy demonstration outside the Fairmont Hotel after Roh
was safely inside. ``They're noisy, but nothing violent,'' said a
police dispatcher who would not give her name.
   Roh's plane, flying U.S. and Korean flags from a hatch above the
flight deck, was greeted by several hundred people, including San
Francisco Mayor Art Agnos, former Secretary of State George Shultz
and Korean Ambassador Hyun Hong-choo.
   Under a brilliant blue sky, Roh was handed a bouquet of flowers
by 8-year-old Diane Lieu, a San Francisco youngster clad in a Korean
costume of red and gold.
   ``I'm delighted to see this taking place,'' Shultz said just
before the plane landed. ``From the standpoint of the United States,
we have a great interest in peace and stability throughout the
Asian-Pacific region.''
   The city declared Sunday ``Roh Tae-woo Day,'' and Agnos was
expected to present Roh with the key to the city.
   The meeting between Roh and the Soviet president would be the
first time leaders of their countries have met since the Republic of
Korea was created 45 years ago. Korean officials expect them to meet
at about 4 p.m. Monday, when there is a 90-minute gap in Gorbachev's
crowded 22-hour San Francisco schedule.
   ``The waves of reform now reshaping the world have started
rushing toward Northeast Asia,'' Roh said as left Seoul. He said he
hoped talks with Gorbachev would help ``pave the way for the peace
and unification of the Korean peninsula.''
   ``Korea now remains the only country on earth that is still
divided as a legacy of the Cold War,'' Roh said.
   He is expected to invite Gorbachev to visit Seoul and may seek
Moscow's help in arranging a summit meeting with North Korean
President Kim Il-sung. Kim has refused to recognize the South Korean
government, and the Soviet Union is North Korea's oldest ally.
   During his talks with Gorbachev, Roh said he would focus on
bilateral issues, emphasizing the normalization of relations and
measures to promote peace and unification of the divided Korean
peninsula.
   Roh plans to leave Tuesday for Washington to meet with President
Bush.
   Local Koreans see the meeting as a step toward the reunification
of North and South Korea, an apparent goal of Roh and possibly
Gorbachev. Both of the leaders see increased economic opportunities
in such a move.
   Bilateral trade between the nations reached $600 million last
year, up 106 percent from 1988 and a tenfold hike over 1985 levels,
according to the Korean Embassy. The figure is expected to top $1
billion this year.

<HEAD>No Trade Revolution Seen in Upgraded Ties With Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improved trade ties with the Soviet Union are
unlikely to usher in an export bonanza for the American farmer, says
a new report from the Agriculture Department.
   The most favored nation status being sought for the Soviets ``may
not greatly benefit U.S. farmers'' but also ``poses little danger to
U.S. farmers,'' according to the report from USDA's Economic
Research Service.
   ``Because of the limited increase in Soviet export earnings (with
or without most favored nation from the United States), the
continued Soviet commitment to increasing its degree of food
self-sufficiency and the USSR's substantial need for nonagricultural
imports, little increase in agricultural imports is likely to
occur,'' it said.
   Most favored nation status would put the Soviets on the same
footing in terms of tariffs and other matters as this country's top
trading partners.
   President Bush agreed to upgraded trade ties between the two
nations on Friday, pressing Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for a
new law protecting Jewish emigration as the price.
   American agribusiness had been pushing for such a move.
   Five former agriculture secretaries, three Republicans and two
Democrats, issued a statement earlier Friday urging the upgraded
trade status. They said it would ``help build a relationship that
all sides can count on for the long term and be a basis for bringing
the Soviet Union more fully into the world trading system.''
   The statement also was signed by 27 groups ranging from the
American Farm Bureau Federation to the import-export giant Cargill
Inc. as well as assorted corn, wheat, soybeans, pork and other
producer organizations.
   USDA economists in their report did cite a recent study by the
U.S. International Trade Commission that said granting most favored
nation status to the Soviets could mean an overall $1 billion gain
for the United States. But it said other studies put the amount
lower.
   USDA is currently forecasting total U.S. agricultural exports for
this year at $40 billion and the Soviet Union's purchases of grain
from this country already have made it the second largest
single-nation customer.
   The report said that U.S. imports from the Soviet Union are
typically commodities that enter duty-free, such as precious metals
and compounds, anhydrous ammonia, art work, sable skins and
tractors. The report said the Soviets are selling the same sorts of
goods to Canada, which already has granted them most favored nation
status.
   The report said the Soviet Union has a limited ability to produce
the sort of consumer goods that would be most affected by lower
tariffs.
   A notable exception: Most favored nation status would slash the
tariff on imports of Soviet vodka between 60 percent and 90 percent
and could lead to imports substantially above last year's $19
million.
   Most favored nation status would cut tariffs on Soviet energy
shipments to the United States by 50 percent to 75 percent.
   ``However, the USSR energy sector has difficulty maintaining
commitments to western Europe and other importing countries where
little or no discriminatory tariffs now exist,'' according to the
report.

   A University of California economist says the
real cost to consumers of the nation's sugar program is ``somewhere
in the neighborhood of below $500 million.''
   The American Sugar Alliance, which represents U.S. growers, is
applauding the finding from Andrew Schmitz, chairman of the
agricultural economics department at Berkeley. They claim that it
``refutes the often quoted figure of $3 billion as the cost to
consumers of the U.S. sugar program.''
   Consumer advocates urge an opening up of quotas that keep U.S.
sugar prices above the world market and thus protect a few American
growers from huge economic losses that would arrive along with a
tide of cheap sugar produced in the Third World.
   They say the cost to consumers of high sugar prices is $3 billion
a year.
   Schmitz unveiled his estimate at a recent State Department
conference on sugar markets. He said the $3 billion figure ``is
based on assumptions which are questionable'' and added that he used
``realistic assumptions'' to reach his conclusion.
   For example, he said the $3 billion estimate was calculated based
on a world price ``at an all-time low in real terms.'' He said it
also was questionable to believe that U.S. prices have no effect on
the world sugar market _ meaning that without the American program
world prices might rise.
   He also said the estimate fails to factor in a savings to
consumers by their switch in some cases from sugar to lower-priced
corn sweeteners.
   ``The greater the degree of substitution between sugar use and
corn sweetener use, the lesser will be the impact of sugar quotas on
U.S. consumers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jail Crowding Worsens as New Inmates Outstrip Construction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Overcrowding in the nation's jails is steadily
worsening, and part of the problem is that jails are holding inmates
for overfilled state prisons, according to the Justice Department.
   On June 30, 1989, there were 395,553 prisoners held in jails
operated by local governments designed to hold 367,769 people,
according to a study released Sunday by the department's Bureau of
Justice Statistics.
   That marked a 15 percent increase from the 343,569 prisoners in
custody on the same day in 1988, when the jails had a rated capacity
of 339,633.
   Meanwhile, the capacity of local jails expanded 8 percent between
the middle of 1988 and midyear 1989, the study said.
   The average daily population of the nation's local jails for the
12 months ending June 30, 1989, was 386,845, also up 15 percent from
an average of 336,017 for the same 12-month period ending June 30,
1988, the study said.
   The occupancy rate of the nation's jails increased from 101
percent to 108 percent between the two periods, the study said. In
1983, the occupancy rate of nation's jails was 85 percent and in
1976 it was 65 percent.
   Overcrowding was worse in the jurisdictions that had the largest
number of inmates. The occupancy rate averaged 116 percent in the
508 local jurisdictions that held at least 100 inmates. These
jurisdictions had 81 percent of the nation's jail prisoners.
   State prison overcrowding also contributed to the problem in
local jails, according to the study. The study found that 88 percent
of the 508 largest jurisdictions held 42,053 prisoners for other
authorities, including 29,358 inmates that had been sent to local
jails because of overcrowding elsewhere, the study said.
   Twenty-six percent of these jurisdictions were under a court
order to reduce overcrowding at one or more jails and 23 percent had
been ordered by judges to improve conditions.
   Despite the increased overcrowding, the number of inmate deaths
declined from 469 during 1988 to 414 last year, the study said. The
number of jail suicides declined from 147 to 121.
   There were 19 million admissions and releases from local jails
during the 12-month period ending June 30, 1989.
   The average daily population of female jail inmates jumped 27
percent between 1988 and 1989. Women comprised 9 percent of all jail
inmates in 1989, the study said.
   The study surveyed local jails that hold inmates after
arraignment, usually more than 48 hours.
   Police lockups that house prisoners, usually drunks, for less
than 48 hours were not included. State-run jails and the combined
jail-prison systems of Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode
Island and Vermont were not included in the survey.

   Today's historic ``post-summit summit,'' a
meeting between the Kremlin's Mikhail Gorbachev and South Korea's
Roh Tae-woo, promised to be an important first step toward easing
tensions on the Korean peninsula.
   The South Korean president arrived in San Francisco Sunday
morning and, after a quick round of airport greetings, spent the day
closeted at the Fairmont Hotel with a group of top-level aides,
planning strategy for the first-ever meeting of top South Korean and
Soviet leaders.
   He met briefly Sunday night with former President Reagan, whose
schedule also included breakfast today with Gorbachev, fresh from a
four-day summit in Washington with President Bush. During the
20-minute meeting, Roh and Reagan discussed prospects for improving
Seoul's relations with Moscow and increasing stability in the area.
   ``This meeting will be an important step towards bringing peace
to Northeast Asia and on the Korean peninsula, thereby ending the
Cold War in that part of the world,'' Reagan said after the meeting.
   As he left Seoul, Roh said, ``The waves of reform now reshaping
the world have started rushing toward Northeast Asia.'' He said he
hoped talks with Gorbachev would open a new era in efforts ``to pave
the way for the peace and unification of the Korean peninsula.''
   ``Korea now remains the only country on Earth that is still
divided as a legacy of the Cold War,'' Roh said.
   Korea was partitioned at the 38th Parallel after World War II. In
1950, the Soviet Union backed the communist North Koreans'
three-year invasion of U.S.-supported South Korea. That bitter war
turned the south into one of the United States' staunchest allies,
but Koreans have always dreamed of reunification.
   The talks are the fruit of Seoul's bid to woo the rapidly
reforming Warsaw Pact countries, aiming both to open new markets and
to bring about an easing of hostilities with its northern neighbor.
   From all indications, the Gorbachev-Roh meeting was arranged
hastily with the blessing of the United States, although it has been
treated as a casual get-together, perhaps in deference to Soviet
relations with North Korea.
   There was no firm agenda and even the time the two would meet was
unclear. Roh planned to fly to Washington on Tuesday to brief Bush
on the meeting before returning to Seoul.
   The 58-year-old South Korean leader reportedly was going to press
for early and full diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union,
reinforcing Seoul's growing economic exchanges with Moscow.
   The South Korean president also was expected to urge a meeting
among the Koreas and the four powers with interests in Northeast
Asia _ the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan and China, news
reports said.
   North Korea has an estimated 1.1 million troops and South Korea
has 650,000. Last week, the North renewed its 1988 proposal calling
for both Koreas to reduce forces to 100,000 armed men in three to
four years.
   The United States, which has 43,000 troops stationed in South
Korea, has declared strong support for improvement in South-North
relations and is trying to improve its own relations with the
North's government in Pyongyang.
   North Korea has denounced the Roh-Gorbachev meeting, calling it
``a serious political issue.''
   For its part, Moscow may voice support of North Korea's call for
the signing of a Korean peace treaty, withdrawal of all nuclear
weapons from the peninsula and the pullout of all U.S. troops in
South Korea.
   Seoul has established diplomatic relations with every East
European country except Albania and East Germany.

<HEAD>Thomas Sutherland's Daughters Talk About Five Years of Waiting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The yellow ribbon on Kit and Joan
Sutherland's front-door knocker is now frayed and faded. But that
doesn't mean the sisters have given up waiting for their father,
held hostage five years in Lebanon.
   Thomas Sutherland, a Scottish-born American abducted by Shiite
Moslem extremists in Beirut on June 9, 1985, has been described by
former hostage David Jacobsen as ``one strong, tough Scottish
farmer.''
   And pessimism is not a family trait.
   ``I think, because Dad is so strong and ... really a
happy-go-lucky, wild, ornery kind of person, that it's really
difficult not to be that way,'' Kit Sutherland said.
   ``And so sometimes you reach the frustrations, but we learned
from the very beginning not to get on the roller coaster, to watch
what happens and wait until you see things.''
   But Joan said: ``I really think something's going to happen.
Maybe not tomorrow, but maybe by the end of the summer.''
   Kit, 29, and Joan, 25, share a house in this university town at
the foot of the Rocky Mountains. Sutherland's other child, Ann, 31,
lives with her husband and daughter in California.
   Sutherland, 59, was the dean of agriculture and food science at
the American University of Beirut and was on leave from Colorado
State University in Fort Collins when gunmen kidnapped him as he
drove in a convoy to Beirut Airport.
   His family stays hopeful by looking at the ``small things: the
fact that some of them have died, and Dad hasn't,'' Kit said.
   ``A lot of things have happened that they (the hostages) could
have been killed for,'' she said. ``So you have to stay optimistic
that at least the most rational of groups, the most rational of
terrorists, has him.''
   Sutherland traveled from Scotland to the United States in the
1950s to continue his agriculture studies at Iowa State University.
He met his wife, Jean, there and married.
   He became a U.S. citizen in 1963 but retained his love for his
native land.
   ``He knows Robert Burns poems,'' recalled freed hostage Rev.
Lawrence Martin Jenco, who shared a year's captivity with
Sutherland. ``And he would recite them with that wonderful Scots
accent.''
   His daughters also credit the strength of their mother, Jean,
with keeping their hopes high.
   Mrs. Sutherland, 56, teaches English at American University and,
except for visits to see her daughters, has remained in Beirut. She
was in Fort Collins finishing her doctoral thesis when her husband
was kidnapped.
   Kit Sutherland, an animal-sciences research assistant at CSU, and
Joan, who works at a Fort Collins lending company, say the last five
years have not exactly been ``on hold.''
   But they have learned what it means to be ``hostage daughters.''
   ``It's gone fast in some ways because you realize that life goes
really fast and in that sense, he's missed a lot,'' Kit said. ``But,
in the other sense, it just seems to drag by because you want him to
finally get out. It's only been every once in a while that it's
difficult to keep optimistic.''
   The release of two American hostages in April, and a recent
report in a Beirut magazine saying Sutherland was ill and would be
released soon, are encouraging signs, she said.
   ``Dad has never been the one to be `the next one,''' she said.
``We've never thought he was the one that was coming out. So this is
the first time that we've had any indication'' that he might be
freed.
   The sisters plan to mark the fifth anniversary of his captivity
at events in the Fort Collins and Denver areas. They admitted that
anniversary dates can be stressful, but said the university
community and Fort Collins residents have been very supportive.
   Throughout Fort Collins, yellow ribbons flutter from trees,
houses, offices, schools and churches.
   Those ribbons routinely are replaced with new ones. But the
ribbon tied on the Sutherlands' door is weather-beaten.
   ``We're not taking it down until he's released,'' Joan said.

   After four days of superpower summitry, a
glad-handing Mikhail Gorbachev dashed through this Midwestern
metropolis like a traveling salesman Sunday, wooing street crowds
and pitching the new Soviet Union to business leaders.
   The Soviet leader urged some of the United States' most prominent
capitalists to continue to help with his country's radical economic
reforms.
   ``When we begin such a project, we feel we need American business
because it is so big,'' he said at an evening meeting attended by
such corporate luminaries as the heads of Anheuser-Busch Co.,
Pepsico, Amoco Corp. and Dow Chemical Co.
   After a Minnesota visit of about seven hours, Gorbachev and his
wife, Raisa, flew to San Francisco, the last stop on their American
tour. They arrived at 10:25 p.m. PDT.
   Earlier in the day, about 6,000 people, some waiting at least six
hours, stood at the state Capitol in St. Paul just to see him zip
past in his limousine.
   Gorbachev repeatedly waded into crowds to shake hands and
exchange small talk, prompting squeals of delight and chants of
``Gorby! Gorby!'' Some admirers waved white handkerchiefs called
``GorbaChiefs,'' reminiscent of the ``Homer Hankies'' brandished by
Minnesota Twins fans during the 1987 World Series.
   When Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, stepped from their limo and
walked the last block to Gov. Rudy Perpich's mansion for a luncheon,
most people shouted ``Welcome!'' but a few carried Lithuanian,
Estonian and Latvian flags.
   Guests at the luncheon included Perpich, British publisher Robert
Maxwell and Whitney MacMillan, chairman of the Minnesota-based
Cargill Inc., the Soviets' largest private trading partner.
   To commemorate the visit, Maxwell announced the creation of a
research center called the Gorbachev Maxwell Institute of
Technology, to be located in the Twin Cities area.
   ``I see this as yet another element of common cooperation which
seems to be emerging and developing between our countries, between
many countries of the world and at the human level, too,'' Gorbachev
said.
   The Soviet president told the business leaders that his country
has spent the past five years sorting out ways to reform the
national economy and will need help, among other things, with
changing decades-old management ideas.
   ``The important question is, `What kind of Soviet Union does the
president and the U.S. people want to see?' '' Gorbachev asked. ``A
Soviet Union that lacks confidence, that is not stable, that is in
turmoil? Or does America want to see the Soviet Union as a noble
democratic state which is moving toward new forms of life?''
   He expressed gratitude for 150 joint business ventures now under
way with companies in the United States, involving food
distribution, automation, medicine and farming.
   American companies doing business in the Soviet Union will be
rewarded with expanded business in the future, he said, but he
warned that ``those who just stand on the sidelines, who do not want
to risk,'' will remain on the sidelines when the Soviet economy is
prospering.
   If his economic reforms are successful, he said, the civic unrest
in the Soviet Union will end.
   ``I think we saw a leader who admitted that his country has made
a lot of mistakes and they're willing to change,'' said best-selling
author Harvey Mackay who owns an envelope business in Minneapolis.
   ``His leadership insisted on having all of these major business
leaders here,'' said former Vice President Walter Mondale, who also
attended the session. ``He obviously wants them to think about
investing.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev made a separate visit to the home of 13-year-old
Lisa Watson, an actress who visited the Soviet Union last year in an
exchange with a Moscow children's theater.
   Before Mrs. Gorbachev arrived at the house, she made two
unannounced stops: to a Mexican deli takeout and to a drugstore,
where she bought macadamia nuts and two packages of Super Mario
Brothers Nintendo bubblegum.
   Gorbachev left Washington earlier Sunday after wrapping up his
summit with President Bush. At a news conference, the leaders
proclaimed their meeting a success, though they still disagree on
the Kremlin's treatment of the Baltic independence movement and on
plans for a united Germany.
   That preoccupation with international matters was left behind in
Washington. In Minneapolis and San Francisco, Gorbachev planned to
focus on American ways that might be used to rescue the lumbering
Soviet economy.
   Minneapolis was festooned with red ribbons and welcome signs in
Cyrillic to greet the Soviet leader, and the entire visit was aired
live on local television.
   A visit to a family farm outside Minneapolis, reminiscent of
Nikita Khrushchev's 1959 visit to an Iowa farm, was canceled.
Khrushchev was the last Soviet leader to venture into the nation's
heartland.
   Sunday's visit by Gorbachev capped off frenzied preparations
begun in mid-May. Greeting signs popped up in the airport and on the
interstate, companies took out welcome ads in Sunday's newspapers,
stores sold T-shirts.
   But not everyone was enthusiastic.
   ``I don't understand the adulation. This is still a man who
represents a regime that starved, tortured and killed many many
people,'' said Martha Anderson, president of the Ukrainian-American
Community Center in northeastern Minneapolis.
   Minnesota has emphasized its common bond with the Soviet Union.
Both have mining and farming areas, frigid climates and a common
heritage: many Eastern Europeans settled in the Iron Range in the
northern part of the state.
   In Perpich's letter of invitation delivered Feb. 26 to the Soviet
ambassador in Washington, he noted the Twin Cities had much of what
might interest the Soviet Union: corporations that are leaders in
medical technology, computers, microelectronics, agriculture,
health-care and financial services.
   Advanced computer technology is another area in which the Soviets
hope to make great leaps in a short time, and Gorbachev included a
visit to Control Data Corp., which is producing computers for the
Soviets to improve nuclear power plant safety.
   The state trade office says more than 35 Minnesota companies are
doing business with the Soviets. Control Data, a company for which
Perpich once worked, sold the first large computers to the Soviet
Union in 1968.
   The trip by Gorbachev, who has been to New York and Washington in
earlier visits, marks the first extended U.S. tour by a Soviet
leader since Leonid Brezhnev visited in 1973.

   Mikhail Gorbachev, stalking business for the
failing Soviet economy, ventures into the West Coast den of
capitalism Monday at a banquet for billionaires and millionaires.
   Gorbachev, who arrived in California at 10:25 p.m. PDT Sunday,
will meet titans of industry in the plush Venetian Room of the
Fairmont Hotel as he pursues investors in the Soviet Union's opening
markets and seeks to position his country as a Pacific Rim trading
partner.
   The lunch with 150 executives from more than 100 companies,
including oil, banking, food, entertainment, airline, hotel, real
estate and computer giants, is of crucial importance to the Soviet
president and his audience.
   The Soviets need hard cash, manufacturing expertise and business
alliances as they transform their staggering, centralized economy
into one that incorporates free-market principles.
   Gorbachev's Sunday agenda included meetings in Minnesota with
regional business and agriculture leaders and at the
Minneapolis-based Control Data Corp. computer company.
   U.S. companies see opportunities in the Soviet Union but are
worried about political uncertainty, monetary problems, bureaucratic
tangles, and other social and economic issues.
   ``Anybody who says there's a bonanza out there for us doesn't
know what he's talking about,'' said Walter Hoadley, senior
economist at BankAmerica Corp. and a fellow at the conservative
Hoover Institution. ``But my concern is that American companies will
wait until it's safe. Then it'll be too late. The Japanese and
Europeans certainly are probing. We have already moved too slowly.
Wait-and-see may be the prudent thing, but it may not be the wisest
thing.''
   Even before Gorbachev arrived on the West Coast, Chevron Corp. on
Saturday announced an agreement to explore and develop the Soviets'
newly discovered oil field near the Caspian Sea. Its estimated oil
reserves are more than double those of the Alaska North Slope.
   The deal, Soviet and American officials said, was an example of
the commercial contacts that would flourish under the trade
agreement President Bush and Gorbachev signed Friday.
   Gorbachev has another important meeting on his San Francisco
agenda _ a first-ever meeting with South Korean President Roh
Tae-woo.
   In addition to putting pressure on North Korea to open up and
move toward unification with the South, the Gorbachev-Roh summit
could accelerate Soviet-South Korean trade, which doubled to $600
million last year and is expected to surpass $1 billion in 1990.
   ``The Soviets desire to link themselves to the economic dynamism
of the Pacific nations,'' said John W. Lewis, chairman of the
International Strategic Institute at Stanford University, where
Gorbachev is speaking before the business luncheon. ``They obviously
are blocked from being full participants by the state of their own
economy. But the Asian countries have no doubt that Gorbachev has a
strong interest in the Soviet Union becoming a major player in
Asia.''
   The billionaires Gorbachev will dine with include William Hewlett
and David Packard, co-founders of computer giant Hewlett-Packard
Co.; Joan Kroc, primary shareholder of McDonald's Corp.; and Ernest
and Julio Gallo, the world's richest winemakers.
   More than a dozen other guests are worth hundreds of millions of
dollars. Nearly all are wealthy leaders of multibillion-dollar
companies, such as Apple Computer Inc.'s John Sculley, Walt Disney
Co.'s Michael Eisner, Oracle Systems Corp.'s Lawrence Ellison,
Chevron Corp.'s Kenneth Derr, and Unocal Corp.'s Richard Stegemeier.
   Gorbachev, whose reported salary of $77,760 pales beside those of
his lunchmates, may be the poorest man in the room. But he will be
offering the promise of a potentially lucrative market for those
companies willing to invest now in his country.
   ``I've watched the Soviets go from arrogance to humility,'' said
Hoadley, 73. ``They've got some real problems. Their biggest problem
is they have a system that is not designed to take risks. We've
gotten a lot of burned fingers over there and we're reluctant to
take risks. I'm afraid that America is becoming more of a provincial
nation economically at a time when international business is so
important.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
rejected Israel's invitation to visit and see for himself whether
many Soviet Jewish refugees are settling in the occupied Arab
territories.
   ``I will be frank, the time has not yet come to go there,'' he
said Sunday evening during a brief stop in the American heartland
following his four-day summit with President Bush in Washington.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz issued
the invitation to Gorbachev after the Soviet leader threatened to
cut the number of Jews allowed to leave the Soviet Union.
   During a joint news conference with Bush at the end of the summit
Sunday morning, Gorbachev said the Soviet Union ``is being bombarded
by a lot of criticism'' from Arab states because of the recent rise
in the numbers of Jews leaving his country for Israel.
   Unless the Israeli government provides guarantees that the
refugees will not settle in lands captured from Arab countries by
Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War, he warned, the Soviet Union will
consider reducing the flow.
   ``We must give further thought to it, in terms with what we can
do with issuing permits for exit,'' he said.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union is at an all-time high.
About 35,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel so far this year,
and the figure is expected to reach as high as 150,000. About 1
million Soviets are seeking permission to emigrate.
   Israel responded to Gorbachev's statement by reiterating that it
has no policy of settling Soviet emgirants in the occupied West Bank
or Gaza Strip, where Palestinians have been in revolt for 29 months.
The occupied territories are home to 1.7 million Palestinians and
about 70,000 Jewish settlers _ of which Israel says only about 200
are Soviet refugees.
   Israeli leaders have repeatedly said that new immigrants are free
to settle anywhere they wish in Israel, but that the government does
not attempt to steer them to the West Bank or Gaza Strip.
   Arab leaders have contended that Jewish emigration to the West
Bank and Gaza Strip is a threat to Palestinian rights and peace in
the region.
   ``I will tell you frankly, let the leaders of Israel think about
what has been said today in Washington, so they don't turn out to be
the only people in the world who don't understand,'' Gorbachev told
reporters in Minneapolis.
   Gorbachev said he and Bush had discussed the situation in the
Middle East ``several times'' during the summit.
   ``Recent years have seen major accomplishments in turning around
the situation in the Arab countries ... and there is a very real
chance of reaching agreement and unraveling this knot,'' he added.
``Look, there's been a lot of change in the Arab position. Realistic
change.''
   Israeli leaders said Gorbachev's warning violated the spirit of
his own reforms in the Soviet Union.
   ``The Soviet Union is changing direction, and it cannot be that
only regarding Jews it would take a step that leads it backward and
not forward, to progress and freedom,'' Deputy Prime Minister David
Levy said.
   The Soviet leader's remarks also were condemned by U.S. Jewish
leaders.
   Malcolm Hoenlein, executive director of the Conference of
Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, said the comments
were undoubtedly ``a response to the unrelenting Arab campaign to
halt Jewish emigration.''
   ``But even to suggest a restriction of Jewish emigration to
Israel is unacceptable,'' Hoenlein said.
   The United States has both opposed Israeli settlements in the
occupied territories and pushed hard for freer Jewish emigration
from the Soviet Union. During the summit, Bush signed a trade
agreement giving the Soviets valuable trade privileges but said he
would not submit it to Congress for ratification until the Soviet
legislature enacted liberalized emigration laws.

   Selected quotes from the final day of the
U.S.-Soviet summit:
   
   ``President Bush would have resolved an issue like this within 24
hours, and he would have restored the validity of his constitution
within 24 hours on any state.'' Mikhail Gorbachev, commenting on his
handling of Lithuania and how Bush would react if a U.S. state tried
to secede in the same fashion.
   
   ``The linkage is between the emigration _ and that's it.'' Bush,
on whether the administration wants Soviet concessions on Baltic
independence _ in addition to liberalized Soviet emigration policies
_ as prerequisites for a U.S.-Soviet trade pact.
   
   ``I don't think you have chosen the best place for clarifying our
internal problems _ but c'est la vie, as they say,'' Gorbachev, to a
Soviet journalist who asked him about disputes back home with his
political rival, Boris Yeltsin.
   
   ``I agree there are settlements that go contrary to the United
States' policy, and I will continue to represent the policy,
reiterate the policy, and try to persuade the government of Israel
that it is counterproductive to go forward with additional
settlements in these territories.'' Bush, on new Israeli settlements
in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   
   ``The Soviet Union is now being bombarded by a lot of criticism
from Arab countries. ... Either after these meetings and exchanges
with the president of the United States of America on this
particular issue, our concern will be heeded in Israel and they will
make certain conclusions. Or else we must give further thought to it
in terms of what we can do with issuing permits for exit.''
Gorbachev, on Arab complaints that Jews leaving the Soviet Union are
populating new Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories.
   
   ``The important question is, `What kind of Soviet Union do the
president and the U.S. people want to see?' A Soviet Union that
lacks confidence, that is not stable, that is in turmoil? Or does
America want to see the Soviet Union as a noble democratic state
which is moving toward new forms of life?'' Gorbachev speaking to
U.S. business leaders in Minneapolis.

   In his first trip to the nation's heartland,
Mikhail Gorbachev charmed and cajoled, then got down to business _
the business of renewing old corporate ties and building new ones to
revive the Soviet economy.
   In a seven-hour visit to the Twin Cities on Sunday, the Soviet
leader, fresh from the Washington summit, was both showman and
salesman, making impromptu forays into crowds chanting ``Gorby!
Gorby!'' and then urging corporate luminaries to invest in his
country.
   Mrs. Gorbachev, meanwhile, took an unexpected shopping trip,
stopping at a Mexican deli and a drugstore, where she bought bubble
gum and macadamia nuts, but turned away a Snickers bar, saying,
``Nyet, Nyet, I'm on a diet.'' She also got some insight into the
mechanics of capitalism, questioning workers about salaries and work
policies.
   The Gorbachevs flew late Sunday to San Francisco, where they'll
spend the day today before heading back to Moscow in the evening.
   Their Minnesota visit included a luncheon at Gov. Rudy Perpich's
mansion, a Twin Cities tour, a meeting with more than 100 business
and agricultural leaders, and a stop at Control Data Corp., which is
plannning to sell $32 million of computers to the Soviet Union to
improve nuclear power plant safety.
   A scheduled trip to the Brand family farm in Farmington, south of
Minneapolis, was canceled because of time constraints and blustery
weather _ steady drizzle, strong winds and 50-degree temperatures.
   The family, however, met the Gorbachevs on the airport tarmac
before their departure. ``You could see why they are loved as they
are. They're very personable,'' said Richard Brand.
   The Gorbachevs also dazzled the thousands who lined up 15 to 20
deep in some spots, cheering, squealing and waving white hankies
called ``GorbaChiefs,'' reminiscent of the ``Homer Hankies''
brandished by Minnesota Twins fans during the 1987 World Series.
   The couple left their limousine three times to work and woo the
crowds with handshakes, waves and smiles _ and, for a lucky few, a
word or two.
   Another local family, the Watsons, had a personal audience with
Mrs. Gorbachev, who spent nearly an hour in their home chatting
about such matters as mortgage and food costs. Their 13-year-old
daughter, Lisa Watson, is in a children's theater group that has
traveled to the Soviet Union.
   ``I felt love in that woman,'' Mrs. Watson said. ``She looked you
right in the eye and locked you right in.''
   Not everyone was so enamored of the couple, however. Small groups
of protesters flashed such signs as ``Hands off the Baltics'' and
``Gorby Go Home'' in areas along the motorcade route.
   To commemorate the visit, British publisher Robert Maxwell, who
attended the luncheon, announced the creation of a research center
called the Gorbachev Maxwell Institute of Technology, to be located
in the Twin Cities area.
   ``I see this as yet another element of common cooperation which
seems to be emerging and developing between our countries, between
many countries of the world and at the human level, too,'' Gorbachev
said.
   The serious side of Sunday's stop in the Midwest also was
reflected in Gorbachev's meeting with more than 100 business and
agricultural leaders, some of whom have longstanding relations with
the Soviet leader.
   ``I see so many old friends, who even in the most difficult
periods of our relations showed themselves to be real business
people,'' he said as he looked out over the group.
   Noting the 150 joint business ventures under way with U.S.
companies, he called for more partnerships in this turbulent time.
``When we begin such a project we feel we need American business
because it is so big,'' Gorbachev said.
   He warned that those executives ``who just stand on the
sidelines, who do not want to risk'' will remain on the sidelines
when the Soviet economy is prospering. ``We'll make sure that is
so,'' he said.
   ``The important question is, `What kind of Soviet Union do the
president and the U.S. people want to see?' '' Gorbachev asked. ``A
Soviet Union that lacks confidence, that is not stable, that is in
turmoil? Or does America want to see the Soviet Union as a noble
democratic state which is moving toward new forms of life?''
   As he stood at the base of the stairway to the plane, preparing
to leave for California, the Soviet leader was asked in English by a
reporter: ``Mr. President, what did you think of your visit in
Minnesota?''
   His response: ``Prekrasno.'' In Russian, it means ``beautiful.''

   In the first debate between Peru's presidential
candidates, Alberto Fujimori accused Mario Vargas Llosa of taking
drugs, and Vargas Llosa attacked his opponent for coming ``with his
samurai sword held high.''
   The two-hour televised debate Sunday night came a week before the
runoff election between Vargas Llosa, the internationally known
novelist, and Fujimori, an agronomist who has capitalized on his
Japanese background and claimed it could help attract foreign
investment to Peru.
   Fujimori, a political unknown when he launched his campaign,
surprised the heavily favored Vargas Llosa in the first-round
balloting on April 8. He finished with 24.6 percent of the vote to
Vargas Llosa's 27.6 percent, forcing a runoff because no candidate
received an absolute majority.
   But the 51-year-old Fujimori has since picked up support, and
recent polls show him leading by five percentage points. Analysts
viewed the debate as critical for Vargas Llosa, 54.
   Security was tight as more than 100 police stood guard during the
debate at Lima's civic center. Authorities closed off most of the
nearby downtown area to traffic. Leftist guerrillas have staged
several attacks in the Peruvian capital in recent weeks.
   The exchanges in Sunday's debate were marked more by personal
attacks than by specific policy proposals.
   In his opening statement, Fujimori accused Vargas Llosa's
center-right Democratic Front coalition of conducting a dirty
campaign and spreading insults against him.
   Vargas Llosa countered by claiming that Fujimori offered only
``generalities and banalities, instead of specific proposals.'' He
said that Fujimori, the son of Japanese immigrants, ``came with his
samurai sword held high.''
   The two candidates differed on their policies toward turning
around Peru's moribund economy and controlling cocaine trafficking.
   Vargas Llosa reiterated his campaign pledges to get the
government bureaucracy off the backs of private business and sell
off state-owned companies.
   ``This is the great proposal of the Democratic Front: to
privatize the public sector,'' he said.
   Vargas Llosa pledged to reduce inflation from the current 2,000
percent annually to 10 percent within one year. He also promised to
pursue a program of crop substitution to guarantee peasants a good
price for legal crops and wean them away from growing coca for the
billion-dollar cocaine trade.
   Fujimori, who labels himself a centrist and independent, charged
Vargas Llosa with proposing a program of ``economic shock'' that
threatened jobs and salaries.
   ``To apply shock during a period of inflation serves only to make
the problem worse,'' he said.
   He said he would maintain state companies and promised to
``drastically reduce inflation while maintaining salaries and jobs.''
   He rejected any ``foreign intervention'' in the fight against
drug trafficking. This was an apparent reference to the United
States, which has offered to send military advisers to train
Peruvian soldiers in anti-drug jungle warfare.
   Fujimori also referred to a magazine interview in which Vargas
Llosa admitted to taking drugs.
   In response, Vargas Llosa said he tried drugs ``when I was 14
years old a couple of times.'' He said he had never used them since.
   In his closing statement, Fujimori provided the surprise of the
evening when he held up a copy of Ojo, a newspaper that supports
Vargas Llosa, which carried a headline saying the novelist had
scored a ``knockout'' in the debate.
   ``How world communications have progressed,'' Fujimori quipped.
   After the debate, Fernando Viana, an executive of the newspaper,
said the copy displayed by Fujimori was a fake.

   Pop superstar Michael Jackson was
admitted to a hospital emergency room Sunday night complaining of
chest pains, officials said.
   Jackson, 31, was in stable condition and undergoing tests, said a
statement issued by St. John's Hospital and Health Center
spokeswoman Paulette Weir and Jackson spokesman Bob Jones.
   Lee Solters, another Jackson spokesman, said the singer and
dancer has no history of heart problems. Solters would not comment
further.
   Jackson was hospitalized in January 1984 after his hair caught
fire when a smoke bomb misfired during the filming of a soft-drink
commercial in Los Angeles. He suffered second-degree scalp burns.
   Jackson was catapulted into the public eye at age 5 with the
Jackson Five family pop group. He went on to become a one-man
phenomenon.
   He sold more than 100 million albums in the 1980s and won an
unprecedented eight Grammy Awards for his 1982 release,
``Thriller,'' the most successful album of all time with sales of
more than 40 million copies worldwide.
   His last album, ``Bad,'' released in 1987, spawned five No. 1
hits.
   The reclusive star, known for wearing one white glove onstage,
has been celebrated as widely for his eccentricities as for his
music and choreography.
   He has often gone out in public wearing a disguise, has had
repeated cosmetic surgery, owns a menagerie of exotic pets and tried
unsuccessfully to buy the bones of ``Elephant Man'' John Merrick.

   Mechanical problems are starting to
take a toll on NASA's shuttle schedule, and the space agency is
wondering whether the troubles are random or somehow related.
   Columbia stands silently at Launch Pad A this week, grounded
first by a bad cooling valve and now by a mysterious hydrogen leak
that threatens to push its astronomy mission into July or later.
   Hardly a month before, one of Discovery's power units had to be
replaced at NASA's other shuttle launch pad, an unprecedented job
that delayed the Hubble Space Telescope's ride into orbit.
   Despite the breakdowns, few blame the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.
   ``Imagining you can fly the shuttle without any problems is like
trying to imagine you can drive to work without hitting any red
lights,'' said John Pike, director of the Federation of American
Scientists' space policy project.
   David Winterhalter, director of systems engineering and analysis
for NASA, said the life of the shuttles _ the fact ``they've been
around a while'' _ may be at the heart of the mechanical problems.
   John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George
Washington University, says NASA should keep plugging away.
   ``What's the alternative? Quitting? We deal with the system we've
got,'' he said.
   Problems with the thousands of components that comprise the
shuttles _ nearly 90 tons without solid rocket boosters and external
tank _ normally are discovered in the hangar.
   On Columbia and Discovery, the troubles were not spotted until
they were at the launch pads.
   Replacing Columbia's cooling valve and Discovery's auxiliary
power unit was the first time such work had ever been performed at
the pad. Both resulted in two-week delays. And a shuttle launch had
never been scrubbed during fueling until last Wednesday's Columbia
scratch.
   ``I see it as the odds,'' said Brewster Shaw, deputy director of
shuttle operations for NASA. ``It's complicated hardware. It's going
to break once in a while. I don't get too depressed over that.''
   NASA officials said they do not intend to scale down future
flight plans as a result of this year's disruptions. Nine shuttle
missions were scheduled for 1990, the same number as in 1985, which
was the year before Challenger exploded and put the program on hold
for 2{ years.
   One of the remaining six missions _ possibly Columbia's _ likely
will slide into next year.
   ``You cannot anticipate all the problems,'' said NASA launch
director Bob Sieck.
   A test is set for Wednesday in which Columbia's external tank
will be partly filled with super-cold liquid hydrogen. Officials
want to duplicate the conditions under which hydrogen escaped into
the rear engine compartment during fueling for the scratched launch
last Wednesday.
   Shaw said he doubts the test will pinpoint a cause that can be
fixed easily at the pad. If so, Columbia will have to be returned to
the hangar for repairs, making it July before the shuttle can lift
off with seven astronauts and the $150 million Astro observatory.
   Columbia's last-minute problems would have halted the launch even
if more stringent checks had not been added following the Challenger
accident, NASA officials said. The same is true of Discovery's
auxiliary power unit failure.
   NASA officials still believe each shuttle is capable of 100
flights. With a goal of 12 flights a year, that would keep the fleet
aloft until the year 2020, said Keith Hudkins, chief of NASA's
shuttle orbiter program. After that, he said, no one knows where the
future lies.
   ``If tomorrow makes the anti-gravity machine that's always been
in all the comic books, where you just push the button, obviously we
would start working on that the day after tomorrow,'' Hudkins said.

   It was hardly the picturesque picnic-table
setting the Brands had labored four days to perfect, but their
airport tarmac meeting at least gave the farmers a chance to
exchange gifts and conversation with Mikhail and Raisa Gorbachev.
   Tired and behind schedule, the Gorbachevs canceled a scheduled
25-minute visit to the Brand farm Sunday in Farmington, about 20
miles south of Minneapolis. The Soviets had requested the farm tour
as part of Gorbachev's seven-hour swing through the Twin Cities area.
   Instead, neighbors milked the cows Sunday night so the Brands and
several family members could meet the Gorbachevs at the airport.
   ``You could tell they felt very badly they couldn't make it,''
Richard Brand said of the airport meeting. ``You could see why they
are loved as they are. They're very personable.''
   The Brands presented the Gorbachevs with pictures of their farm
and family and a basket of Minnesota-made foodstuffs, including
cheese, jellies and buffalo jerky. The Soviet first family brought
dolls for the Brands' grandchildren.
   ``They spent a lot of time with my grandson and my
granddaughter,'' Brand said. ``You could tell they love kids.''
   The Brands said they're sorry Gorbachev wasn't able to visit
their farm and get a taste of rural American life.
   ``Let's face it, this is Russia's main problem _ food
production,'' Brand said. ``It's a real serious problem in Russia.
I'm disappointed that we couldn't show him a typical, American
average farm.''
   The Brands, who run their 240-acre farm with their two sons, milk
75 cows and raise alfalfa, corn and soybeans. In all they have 250
cows.
   ``We'll go back to what we like best,'' Brand said after four
days of readying the farm for their expected visitor. ``We're going
to rest and move a little slower.''

<HEAD>Cuomo to Seek Third Gubernatorial Term, Won't Rule Out White House
Bid</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Convention begins noon EDT; lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario M. Cuomo formally declared he'll
seek a third term but wouldn't promise he'll complete it. He refused
to rule out running for president in 1992.
   Cuomo's announcement Sunday of his re-election bid had been
widely anticipated, and he is expected to win virtually unanimous
support from delegates at the two-day state Democratic convention
opening today in Albany. His acceptance speech is planned for
Tuesday.
   His Republican challenger will be Pierre Rinfret, a millionaire
economist and political newcomer nominated at the GOP convention
last week. Herbert London, a dean at New York University, is running
on the Conservative Party ticket.
   Cuomo told cheering supporters that his heart was in being
governor.
   ``The truth is, Matilda and I don't want to do anything else,''
Cuomo, 57, said as he and his wife visited the convention hall
Sunday.
   But he kept open the possibility he'd run for president in 1992.
He refused to pledge to serve the full four-year gubernatorial term.
   ``That wouldn't work at all,'' he said. ``What would make you
believe it?''
   There was widespread speculation that Cuomo would run for
president in 1988, but he decided against it.
   This year, state fiscal problems apparently have not deterred him
from another gubernatorial bid.
   Three other Democratic governors beset by fiscal problems in the
Northeast _ Massachusetts' Michael Dukakis, Connecticut's William
O'Neill and Vermont's Madeleine Kunin _ have announced they won't
seek re-election this year.
   Facing his third straight year of deficits, Cuomo recently
approved a record $1.8 billion tax increase package to keep his
budget balanced. That package included a 15 percent business tax
surcharge and the delay of a scheduled income tax cut that had been
due New Yorkers this year.
   The Canadian-born Rinfret, 66, has pledged to make Cuomo's
handling of New York's economic problems a campaign issue. He has
already begun comparing Cuomo to Dukakis, the failed 1988 Democratic
presidential candidate.
   Cuomo has the advantage of incumbency and a national reputation
as one of the Democratic Party's most eloquent speakers. He also has
more than $7 million in his campaign warchest and a stable of
veteran political operatives, led by son Andrew Cuomo.
   Cuomo and Rinfret both advocate abortion rights but disagree on
capital punishment. Cuomo eight times has vetoed legislation to
restore the death penalty in New York state. Rinfret has called for
the electric chair to be used against murderers and major drug
dealers.
   In 1982, Cuomo pulled a major upset when he beat then-New York
City Mayor Edward Koch for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination.
Cuomo narrowly defeated millionaire Republican businessman Lewis
Lehrman in the general election.
   Cuomo gained national prominence in 1984 when he delivered a
rousing keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. Two
years later, he won re-election to a second term as governor with a
record 65 percent of the vote to 32 percent for Republican Andrew
O'Rourke.

   A ``typical'' American family with four kids
and a dog shared coconut macaroons with Raisa Gorbachev around their
dining room table and said the moment was ``too wonderful'' to
bother taking photographs.
   ``It exceeded anything we could have expected. We won't sleep for
a week,'' said Steve Watson, 39.
   The Watsons chatted about family finances with Mikhail
Gorbachev's wife during her visit Sunday, part of the Gorbachevs'
seven-hour stopover in Minnesota.
   The visit to the white stucco home with green awnings was
supposed to last 20 minutes, but the Soviet first lady stayed an
hour.
   ``I think for the same reason that we wouldn't take autographs,
we didn't need pictures. It was too wonderful an experience,''
Watson said.
   ``I think she is wonderful,'' declared 13-year-old Lisa Watson,
whose performance as part of a children's theater exchange in Moscow
last year helped lead to her family being chosen as Mrs. Gorbachev's
hosts.
   Wearing a red and white striped dress and a bow in her hair, Lisa
greeted Mrs. Gorbachev in Russian and gave her a bouquet and a hug
on the sidewalk before introducing her parents, sister and two
brothers.
   Karen Watson, 38, said Mrs. Gorbachev put everyone at ease right
away. ``She had all of the press people sit on the floor and said,
`Let's have a private chat,''' said Mrs. Watson, an obstetric nurse.
   Watson, an elementary school art teacher, praised Mrs.
Gorbachev's ability to communicate despite the language difference.
   ``She would reach out her hand, and it was almost like that was a
third language. I really liked holding that hand. It was a beautiful
hand,'' he said as his wife began to laugh.
   ``I'll tell you, I felt love in that room,'' said Mrs. Watson.
   Lisa wound up with a pen pal. ``I told her that I would like to
go back and she seemed happy about that. She gave me her address so
I can write to her,'' she said.
   An estimated 6,000 people jammed yards, sidewalks and streets and
even climbed trees for a better view of Mrs. Gorbachev as she
arrived.
   The Watsons had been recommended to Gov. Rudy Perpich's staff as
a typical middle-class family by Jon Cranney, artistic director of
the Children's Theater Co. of Minneapolis, which took part in the
theater exchange.
   Still, the family is hardly typical _ Lisa and 11-year-old sister
Stephanie appeared in an ABC miniseries filmed in the Twin Cities,
``The Voices Within: The Lives of Truddi Chase.''
   The family also includes 7-year-old Tom, 6-year-old Will and dog
Bonnie, who was kept out of sight during the visit.
   Mrs. Gorbachev inquired about the family's income and food budget
and asked whether they had completed payments on their home.
   ``She went to the back door, looked out and wanted to know if
that was all of our yard and if that was our garage, which the
Secret Service men were all in,'' Mrs. Watson said.
   Earlier, Mrs. Gorbachev paid unscheduled visits to a Mexican
``takeout'' and a drugstore, where she picked up macadamia nuts,
Super Mario Brothers Nintendo bubblegum and insight into the
capitalist system.
   ``Does your salary depend on the merchandise you sell?'' she
asked employees. She also asked how much vacation time employees are
given.
   The Soviet first lady was curious about the contents of a
Snickers bar. But in the end she rejected the candy. ``Nyet, Nyet,''
she said. ``I'm on a diet.''

   Shouts of ``Gorby! Gorby!'' and a ``Mr.
Gorbachev is a Cool Dude'' sign helped lure Mikhail Gorbachev away
from his official escorts and onto Minnesota streets. Not that he
really needed any urging.
   The Soviet president lived up to his reputation for spontaneously
wading into crowds Sunday despite the presence of protesters whose
chants competed with cheers from most onlookers.
   ``Thank you all for your feelings,'' Gorbachev said through an
interpreter during one hand-shaking foray in St. Paul. ``I wish
happiness and well-being to the people of Minnesota and this state.''
   At one stop, Gorbachev's wife accepted from an onlooker a
hand-painted sign that read, ``We love Mikhail, Raisa.''
   ``I've never seen any reception like that for a political
figure,'' said Gov. Rudy Perpich.
   Gorbachev smiled and often stopped to say a few words.
   ``My heart started pounding so fast,'' said Jan Michel of
Hopkins, who shook Gorbachev's hand. ``He said a word, but we don't
know what it was,'' said Michel, part of a 77-member bell-ringing
group that performed as the Gorbachevs arrived.
   When the Gorbachevs first emerged from their limousine near the
governor's mansion, they approached a group of about 200 protesters
but did not talk to them. The protesters flew flags of Lithuania,
Latvia and Estonia.
   ``He's a very charming man, but you have to remember he does have
iron teeth,'' said protester Karin Berkholtz.
   Others demonstrated against Soviet involvement in Afghanistan,
Vietnam and Ethiopia and Soviet treatment of Jews.
   Police had to scramble as Gorbachev jumped out of his limousine
or crossed a street to shake a hand. At the state Capitol, however,
some 6,000 supporters and demonstrators who had waited up to seven
hours got only disappointment.
   Gorbachev stuck his hand out his car window and waved, but his
motorcade didn't even slow. Many people ran the length of the
Capitol lawn, leaping hedges and jumping curbs, to get a look.
   ``It did go pretty fast,'' said Shelly Hanson, who with her
husband, son, daughter and nephew made the 2{-hour trip from
Alexandria and waited two hours for the motorcade.
   ``Obviously, it would have been nicer if he shook hands with some
people here, but we would make the same trip again. We got such a
good look and him, it made him seem so real. We were pretty
excited.''

<HEAD>Social Democrats Wind Up 9-Year Life in British Politics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Social Democratic Party has dissolved itself
after nine years of trying to create a moderate third force in
British politics.
   ``You have to realize, sadly, that our membership is not large
enough to lay claim to be a democratic party,'' party leader David
Owen told reporters Sunday after the party's national committee
voted 17-5 to suspend its constitution.
   Owen said party membership had collapsed to 6,200 from a peak
68,000 soon after the Social Democrats were launched in January
1981. Party organizers said a number of members had not paid dues
for the year.
   Owen is one of three legislators the party has in the 650-member
House of Commons. The three will continue to hold their seats as
Independent Social Democrats.
   Owen and three other former Cabinet ministers, then leading
members of the Labor Party, had formed the new party promising to
``break the mold of British politics.''
   They sought the middle ground between the dominant Conservative
and Labor Parties, hoping to eventually displace Labor, which they
accused of going too far to the left.
   Many analysts predicted Labor would never achieve power again
after Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservatives won a
second general election victory in 1983, then consolidated it in
1987.
   But the Social Democrats not only never got within sight of their
target. They never even managed to displace the old centrist Liberal
Party, with whom they formed an uneasy alliance that won 22
parliamentary seats in the 1987 general election.
   Owen refused to merge with the Liberals, but a majority of his
party agreed and formed the Social and Liberal Democrats. David
Sainsbury, a grocery chain multimillionaire, told Owen he was no
longer willing to continue his financial backing of the fading party.
   Meanwhile, Labor has undergone a rejuvenation under leader Neil
Kinnock.
   It has dumped leftist policies and extreme leftist members and
benefited from a slump in popularity for Mrs. Thatcher's governing
Conservatives stemming from inflation, cuts in the National Health
Service and a new tax to finance local services levied on all adults
instead of just property owners.

   Gov. George Deukmejian welcomed Mikhail
Gorbachev to California with a letter on behalf of the state's
Armenians conveying their hope for greater safety in the
violence-torn Soviet republic of Armenia.
   Gorbachev, who flew to San Francisco late Sunday after spending
much of the day in Minneapolis, canceled a late evening tea with the
governor, but the two spoke outside the Soviet consul general's
residence.
   Deukmejian told the Soviet president that California wants to
expand trade with the Soviets. The governor, who is of Armenian
descent, also presented Gorbachev with a letter from Deukmejian
about the desires of California's Armenians.
   ``They're very supportive of what (Gorbachev's) trying to do in
the Soviet Union and hope that he will be able to provide greater
protection and safety for the people there,'' Deukmejian said.
   Many Armenians have been killed in ethnic and political strife in
the southern U.S.S.R.
   Deukmejian gave the Soviet leader a clock bearing the governor's
seal, and Gorbachev gave Deukmejian a medal in honor of
Californians' assistance to Armenian earthquake victims.
   A high school marching band played the Soviet national anthem as
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, stepped off a plane that landed at
10:25 p.m., more than an hour late.
   Gorbachev greeted Mayor Art Agnos and other local politicians as
he moved across the tarmac. A motorcade sped the Gorbachev to the
Soviet consul general's home, where about 1,000 people gathered
outside police cordons.
   Many began chanting after the motorcade sped past. Some held
candles or waved placards expressing their secessionist wishes for
some Baltic states.
   One sign read, ``Act Like Lincoln, Free Slave Nations.''
   Gorbachev failed to make one of his frequent unannounced forays
into the crowd.
   ``I'm from East Germany. I should have met him,'' said Marie
Istel, who lives across the street from the consul general.
   ``He's a great guy. I'm glad he took the (Berlin) Wall down. It's
just amazing. It would have never happened without him.''

   Doctors said today that there were signs of
improvement in the paralysis condition of Norway's King Olav, who
suffered a stroke late Saturday. But they warned of an approaching
infection of his lungs.
   ``Under the circumstances His Majesty the King had a quiet night
and slept a good part of the night. There is still a paralysis in
the left side of his body, but an improvement has occurred so that
His Majesty to a certain extent can move his leg,'' doctors Rolf
Nyberg-Hansen and Erling Brodwall announced in a press statement.
   They said the king is fully conscious and can communicate.
   ``Early Monday the king had a light increase in body temperature,
and there is sign of an approaching infecton of his lungs,'' the
doctors said.
   King Olav, at 86 the world's oldest reigning monarch, was taken
to Rikshospitalet last Tuesday with a mild infection of his
pericardium.
   The stroke came one day after the hospital decided to let the
king remain at the hospital for observation.

<HEAD>Journal Report Faults Death Penalty System in South</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many defense lawyers in capital punishment cases
in the South are inexperienced in handling such cases, a law
publication reported today.
   The National Law Journal, which studied nearly 100 death-penalty
cases in six states, also said standards for appointing lawyers to
poor defendants are ``inadequate or nonexistent.''
   Texas, Mississippi and Florida have no statewide standards,
Georgia's are not enforced by courts or the law and Louisiana's
allow for the appointment of lawyers with no experience in criminal
law, it said.
   Lawyers' requests for money to hire investigators and experts
often are denied, the journal added.
   The weekly publication studied cases in Alabama, Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, in which nearly 80
percent of the executions in the United States have been carried out
since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976.
   Of 60 lawyers interviewed who had clients on death row, half of
them said it was their first such case, the journal said.
   The law newspaper also said it checked the professional records
of about 1,000 trial lawyers in states that have handled capital
punishment cases since 1976 and found that death-penalty lawyers
were more likely than other lawyers to have been disciplined.
   But the disciplinary actions, ranging from minor reprimands to
disbarment, were not necessarily related to the capital punishment
cases, it said.
   In Louisiana, 8.9 percent of the capital-punishment lawyers who
were checked had undergone some form of professional discipline,
compared with 0.19 percent of all Louisiana lawyers, the report said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen for the
fifth consecutive trading day today, while share prices inched up on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 152.42 yen, up 0.25 yen from Friday's close
of 152.17 yen. After opening at 152.65 yen, it ranged between 152.27
yen and 152.80 yen.
   The dollar now has gained 2.97 yen in five days.
   Currency dealers attributed today's rise to the successful summit
between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Washington.
   ``The market expects that disarmament will help the United States
shed its budget deficit, and it encouraged the purchase of the
dollar,'' said a trader at Daiichi Kangyo Bank.
   THe dollar rose sharply in morning trading, but declined somewhat
later on profit-taking.
   ``The market is not ready to push the dollar up beyond the
153-yen mark yet,'' said the dealer, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said overall
sentiment is running in the dollar's favor because of fewer
expectations of lower U.S. interest rates despite a decline in the
latest U.S. unemployment figures.
   The U.S. Labor Department reported Friday that the nation's
unemployment rate in May fell to 5.3 percent from 5.4 percent in
April.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 34.25
points, or 0.10 percent, closing at 32,925.37.
   Securities dealers said shares rose because of a strong showing
by the New York Stock Exchange at the end of last week.
   ``The Nikkei index rose moderately, but there really aren't any
outstanding incentives other than bullishness in overseas markets,''
said Keiichi Nishida of Kidder Peabody.
   A dealer with Nikko Securities, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the market environment is improving.
   ``The key question is how long we can make this atmosphere
last,'' he said.
   Dealers said large-capital shares, such as construction, heavy
industries and petroleum, were rising while electronic shares were
declining.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds edged up to 88.36 points at 5 p.m. from
Friday's close of 88.04. The yield fell to 6.895 percent from the
previous 6.960 percent.

   Boat custody, not child custody, was the
sticking point in the Blairs' divorce.
   Circuit Judge Muriel Robinson settled it, ruling Friday that
Michael Wayne Blair could keep the former couple's boat, motor and
trailer, but Donna Lynne Blair could use them on one weekend each
month.
   Attorneys agreed that Mrs. Blair should get the boat during the
hours frequently set for child visitation in divorce cases, between
6 p.m. Friday and 6 p.m. Sunday.
   The judge also ordered Blair to show Mrs. Blair how to operate
the boat safely, and ordered her to return Blair's motorcycle.
   Mrs. Blair has been granted custody of the couple's 6-year-old
son, and Blair was ordered to provide child- and other support
payments.

   More than 100,000 people in Hong Kong and
thousands more in cities around the world held demonstrations to
remember the hundreds who fell one year ago when Chinese troops
crushed the pro-democracy movement.
   ``We won't forget June 4'' and ``We are not scared,'' read
banners carried by demonstrators in Hong Kong who marched several
miles Sunday from a downtown park to the local headquarters of
China's Xinhua News Agency, the Communist government's de facto
embassy. Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   About 200 demonstrators staged an overnight sit-in and
candlelight vigil outside the Xinhua building. Several tried to
force their way to the main entrance of the building but were
blocked by police.
   Rallies also were staged in cities across the United States and
in Britain, Czechoslovakia, Canada, France, Taiwan and Japan.
   Police estimated 100,000 people joined in the Hong Kong march,
but organizers put the figure at more than 200,000. It was the
biggest rally in the British colony since nearly 1 million people
demonstrated last summer in support of China's pro-democracy
movement.
   ``Only democracy can save China and we won't back down despite
pressure from Beijing,'' said Szeto Wah, chairman of the Hong Kong
Alliance in Support of the Patriotic Democratic Movement in China,
which organized the protest.
   China has labeled the alliance ``subversive'' for helping
dissidents fleeing the mainland.
   In the United States, protest rallies were held in New York,
Washington, San Francisco, Atlanta, Chicago, Boston and Buffalo,
N.Y., among other cities.
   Nearly 2,500 people gathered on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in
Washington to hear Chinese student leaders evoke the horror of last
June 3-4, when Chinese troops moved against demonstrators in Beijing
and other cities, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands.
   ``There have been many tears ... the tears will become the seeds
of change, the seeds of human rights, the seeds of freedom and
democracy,'' said Chai Ling, who has been credited with organizing
last year's hunger strikes in Beijing.
   In New York City, about 1,500 people demonstrated across the
street from the Chinese Consulate. A sign naming the corner
``Tiananmen Square'' was authorized by Mayor Edward I. Koch before
he left office.
   Tiananmen is the vast square in central Beijing that was occupied
for weeks by pro-democracy protesters.
   The protesters later marched uptown to the Chinese Mission to the
United Nations.
   More than a 1,000 people rallied outside the Chinese consulate in
San Francisco. They carried a replica of the Goddess of Democracy
statue, the symbol of the pro-democracy movement that was erected in
Tiananmen and torn down during the military crackdown.
   About 400 people attended a rally at the University of Illinois
at Chicago, where they heard Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., attack
President Bush's announcement last month renewing China's most
favored nation trading status.
   ``When the Chinese government murders its students and denies
democracy to Chinese people, it does not deserve the most favored
nation status and we will fight to see it does not receive it,''
Dixon said.
   In Prague, Czechoslovakia, where students helped lead last
November's peaceful revolution that ousted the country's hard-line
Communist leadership, hundreds of young people marched Sunday night
to the Chinese Embassy, the state CTK news agency said.
   The demonstrators carried banners reading ``Freedom for China''
and ``You Cannot Crush Freedom with Tanks,'' CTK said.
   In Toronto, one of several Canadian cities where weekend rallies
were held, about 8,000 people gathered at City Hall Sunday to mark
the anniversary.
   Several hundred protesters in Paris led by fugitive student
leader Wu'er Kaixi lit candles at the Plaza of the Rights of Man,
dedicated to the declaration of human rights during the French
Revolution in 1789.
   ``Last June 4 the Goddess of Democracy statue (in Tiananmen
Square) was crushed by a tank. But not long afterward what was
crushed was the Berlin Wall,'' said Wu'er, who is vice chairman of
the Paris-based Federation for a Democratic China.
   ``I am convinced the Goddess of Democracy will once again stand
in Tiananmen Square,'' he told the crowd.
   In Taiwan, organizers set up an altar for last June's victims as
about 400 Taiwanese, braving rain, rallied in a Taipei park.
   Demonstrators in Tokyo gathered in a park with wreaths and
banners in Chinese and Japanese saying, ``Long live freedom and
democracy in Tiananmen Square'' and ``The June 4 massacre is the
world's shame.''
   In London, a Chinese student who said his friends were killed in
the crackdown told an estimated 2,000 people outside the Chinese
Embassy that the pro-democracy movement will rise again.
   ``China is a vast country and you cannot control the people with
tanks and machine guns,'' said Li Lu, wearing a white flower to
commemorate the dead.

<HEAD>Co-Inventor of Semiconductor Chip Dead at 62</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robert Noyce, an inventor of the computer
chip that revolutionized electronics and helped usher in the
Information Age, has died of a heart attack at 62.
   The computer pioneer died Sunday at Seton Medical Center.
   Working separately in the late 1950s, Noyce and Jack S. Kilby
invented the integrated circuit, which made possible rapid gains in
computer technology by putting the power of multiple transistors on
a single, tiny chip.
   Computer chips, or semiconductors, are used in everything from
personal computers and pocket calculators to microwaves and medical
equipment.
   ``Very few things have changed the world as dramatically as the
integrated circuit,'' said Robert M. White, president of the
National Academy of Engineering. ``The development of the integrated
circuit was the single most important event that helped to usher in
the Information Age.''
   Noyce was a founder in 1968 of Intel Corp., the nation's
third-largest semiconductor producer.
   In 1988, he was appointed chief executive and president of
Sematech, the government-industry group set up to help the United
States recover world leadership in semiconductor manufacturing from
the Japanese.
   Noyce was ``a legend within the electronics industry,'' spokesman
Jim Jarrett said from Intel's Santa Clara, Calif., headquarters.
   ``Bob was an instrumental figure in creating what has become a
$50 billion industry, and semiconductors are the driving force
behind a $500 billion electronics industry,'' said Stan Victor,
spokesman for Texas Instruments Inc.
   Noyce once said American leadership in semiconductor
manufacturing is essential to the nation's economic and military
security. He said U.S. companies must adopt the cooperative
practices of their Japanese competitors to regain it.
   Noyce was born in Burlington, Iowa. He earned bachelor's degrees
from Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, in physics and mathematics.
Noyce earned a Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1953.
   He became a researcher at Philco Corp., then moved to the
Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory. He co-founded Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp. in 1957.
   He was working at Fairchild and Kilby at Texas Instruments when
they invented the integrated circuit.
   Noyce was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in
1983.
   Survivors include his wife, Ann Bowers, four children and 12
grandchildren.
   Funeral plans were incomplete.

<HEAD>Pawnshops Seen as Lenders to Poor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jewelry, guns and guitars are the most common
wares. Look around Stanton Myerson's pawnshop, and you'll also find
a telescope, a diabetes monitor and a television marked ``prison
approved.''
   A steady stream of visitors moved through the store on a recent
weekday afternoon in this economically depressed city near
Philadelphia. Some were seeking loans; some were buying goods left
as collateral and never reclaimed.
   ``Basically, it's blue-collar people, who live from paycheck to
paycheck, who need at times extra funds to carry them over to the
next paycheck,'' said Myerson, owner of Lou's Loan Inc. in Chester
and Upper Darby.
   Although widely overlooked by policymakers and researchers,
pawnshops are an important but costly source of credit to the poor,
according to a recent study by Swarthmore College economics
professor John P. Caskey and student Brian J. Zikmund.
   Millions of Americans borrow about $50 at a time, typically
reclaiming their goods in two to three months, the study found. They
pay interest and fees ranging from an annual 36 percent in
Pennsylvania and New Jersey to 240 percent in Oklahoma.
   ``Most pawnshop customers come from low-income economic groups
and are probably ineligible for bank or finance company credit,''
Caskey and Zikmund write in the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas
City's Economic Review journal.
   Pawnshops are on the rise in response to bank deregulation,
falling real wages for production workers and a growing poverty
rate, the researchers say. They deal in smaller amounts than
traditional lenders like to handle and are seeking enhanced
respectability in suburban shopping centers.
   Most pawnbrokers own perhaps two or three shops. Cash America
Investments, a Fort Worth, Texas-based company with 100 pawnshops in
three states, is traded on the American Stock Exchange.
   ``Policymakers obviously don't think a lot about pawnshops,''
Caskey said in an interview. ``There's a great deal of attention to
banks and now, of course, savings and loans. But there's a
phenomenon growing here that people aren't aware of. I think they
ought to be paying some attention to it.''
   An estimated 6,900 pawnshops provided about $689 million in loans
in 1988, the study said. The amount was less than 0.1 percent of the
nation's $744 billion outstanding consumer credit that year.
   But at an average of $50 each, some 35 million loans were spread
among as much as 10 percent of the nation's adults, allowing for
multiple loans to some customers.
   During the 1980s, the pawnbroking industry grew in almost all
states for which data could be obtained, the researchers say.
   ``There is a movement now among pawnbrokers to try to clean up
their image,'' Caskey said. ``They're trying to move out to the
suburbs, provide well-lit, very clean, professionally managed
stores, with squeaky clean images.''
   He said he found little evidence to back up the popular
perception that pawnshops are fronts for stolen goods. ``Obviously
it happens, but it's very rare,'' he said.
   Pawnshops must register pawned goods and the names of individuals
pawning them with police. Authorities can seize stolen items,
costing the brokers both their collateral and the loaned money.
   In Oklahoma, just 0.15 percent of pawned goods were confiscated
by police as stolen property, the study said.
   State and local governments regulate how much pawnshops can
charge for interest, storage and insurance. In more than half the
states, pawnshops can levy an effective 120 percent interest rate or
more on the average-sized loan, the researchers say.
   State and local laws also determine what can be pawned. In
Delaware, false teeth and artificial limbs are off-limits.
Pennsylvania pawnshops must see proof of ownership before accepting
workers' tools.

<HEAD>White Supremacist Gets Punches, Then Endorsement, From Black
Activist</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto LR2</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black activist punched a white
supremacist in the face on camera at a television studio, then
endorsed him over a black candidate in the Republican primary for
lieutenant governor.
   Little Rock activist Robert ``Say'' McIntosh said he wanted to
get back at GOP runoff candidate Ralph Forbes for preventing him
from burning an American flag during a demonstration on the steps of
the state Capitol last July.
   ``That's for stepping on my rights,'' McIntosh said Sunday after
he had stopped hitting Forbes and the candidate got up off the floor
of the KARK television studio.
   McIntosh said the blows were not thrown for Forbes' views on
race. Forbes supports racial segregation.
   Forbes said later he would press charges.
   The station broadcast the fracas on its night newscast.
   Forbes faces a black real estate salesman, Kenneth ``Muskie''
Harris, in the June 12 runoff for the GOP nomination. Forbes got 46
percent of the vote and Harris 36 percent in last week's primary.
   McIntosh said he was going to vote for Forbes in the runoff.
   ``I've always favored white people who will tell you they don't
like you,'' McIntosh said. ``If he prosecutes me, I'm still going to
vote for him. I'm going to vote for the man for telling the truth of
how he believes.
   ``Mr. Forbes can't do black people no harm; he hasn't got any
money,'' McIntosh said. He offered no other reasons for endorsing
Forbes.
   Forbes went to the studio for an interview during the station's
evening newscast, and McIntosh arrived afterward. Forbes was about
to present a Stars and Stripes, folded military style, to McIntosh
in a symbolic gesture when he was sent flying, KARK anchor Jack
Martin said.
   Martin said McIntosh showed up uninvited.
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' Forbes said. ``I didn't know
why he was endorsing me, and then he wanted to have the media, have
the camera take a picture of Mr. Forbes presenting the American flag
to him, and I'm standing there, holding the flag, and he comes up
and sucker punches me.
   ``He came at me like a windmill,'' Forbes said. ``He got me down
on the floor. I didn't attack him back.''
   Newscast producer Melinda Dunston said the police were called,
but that officers refused to make an arrest because they had not
witnessed what happened.
   After the incident, she said, the two men ``calmed down and
talked some more.''

   A Soviet helicopter pilot being treated for
radiation damage from the Chernobyl disaster got a get-well note
from Mikhail Gorbachev praising him as a national hero who risked
his life in the line of duty.
   The note to Anatoly Grishchenko was delivered Sunday by Yuriy
Osipyan, a member of the Soviet President's Council and vice
president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   Grishchenko is recuperating at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center, where he underwent a bone marrow transplant April
27.
   Osipyan, who is traveling with Gorbachev on a U.S. tour following
the summit with President Bush, said Grishchenko was looking well
and praised him as ``our national hero.''
   In the handwritten note, translated by Osipyan, Gorbachev told
Grishchenko, ``All the people know that you didn't spare your life
in the line of duty.''
   Grishchenko stood up inside a plastic isolation tent, which
protects him from infection, and chatted for about 20 minutes,
Osipyan said.
   Grishchenko, 53, developed a pre-leukemia condition after flying
through hot radioactive gases to dump sand and wet concrete on the
stricken reactor at Chernobyl, which exploded in 1986. The accident
was blamed for at least 31 deaths.
   After arriving two months ago, Grishchenko underwent radiation
and chemotherapy to kill his bone marrow, which produces blood
cells. He then received a transfusion of marrow taken from a woman
in Besancon, France.
   Despite a mouth inflammation and a lung infection common among
transplant recipients, Grishchenko has shown no signs of rejecting
the donor marrow, said Dr. Patrick Beatty, who heads Fred
Hutchinson's Unrelated Transplantation Program.
   ``We're very pleased with how he's doing,'' Beatty said.
   Most transplant patients stay in the hospital about 100 days
before moving to hospital-owned apartments nearby as outpatients.
   While doctors don't consider a patient cured until five years of
remission, ``all signs we have now point to a recovery,'' said Dr.
Robert Hansen, center associate director.
   The Soviet government paid for Grishchenko's transplant,
including the $185,000 required to be deposited before the procedure
begins, Beatty said.

   Chunks of concrete from an aging bridge fell
onto a heavily traveled highway, damaging at least 20 vehicles and
injuring four people, police said.
   The debris from the bridge over Interstate 376 on the city's
southeastern outskirts crashed through the windshields of several
cars on Sunday afternoon.
   ``A rock came out of the sky, bounced off our hood and smashed
the windshield,'' motorist Laura Nizankiewicz said. ``There was
glass all over the car.''
   The debris damaged the hoods, roofs, windshields and bumpers of
vehicles passing under the bridge. ``A lot of them were damaged when
cars kicked the debris up, smacking windshields,'' said state
Trooper W. Hughes.
   A woman occupant of one car that struck debris in the road
suffered neck and shoulder injuries when debris flew through the
windshield, Hughes said. She was listed in stable condition at
Presbyterian-University Hospital, he said.
   Two other people were treated at the scene, and at least one
other person was hurt, he said.
   City engineer Fred Reginella said pieces started falling Thursday
from the bridge's supporting arches, some of which were repaired in
1980. The bridge is at least 75 years old, he said.
   Al Neri, a spokesman for Mayor Sophie Masloff, said engineers
were unsure late Sunday if the debris fell from the bridge or from
collection nets placed under the span during the weekend.

<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with xx grafs to UPDATE with Mandela off on trip. No

<DATELINE>GABARONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A day after ending a six-day hospital
stay, Nelson Mandela was off today on the first leg of a 13-nation
tour through Europe, North America and Africa to promote his
anti-apartheid efforts.
   At the hospital, doctors removed what they said was a benign cyst
from the African National Congress leader's bladder.
   Dr. Gus Gecelter, who performed the operation, said the
71-year-old Mandela is in good health.
   ``We don't look at patients chronologically any more, in terms of
their age. We look at them biologically. And Mr. Mandela is a man of
about 50,'' Gecelter said.
   ``I feel well,'' Mandela said as he left the Park Lane Clinic in
Johannesburg, South Africa, on Sunday.
   Mandela's began his six-week trip with a visit to Botswana, his
first since time in the country since his release from prison Feb.
11 after spending 27 years in jail for sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the government.
   He was to hold talks with President Quett Masire before
addressing a rally at the National Stadium.
   He is then to visit the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Canada, Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya and
Mozambique.
   Gecelter said Mandela had been given vitamins and antibiotics for
the trip.
   Speaking Saturday at the Park Lane Clinic, where he was
hospitalized for seven days, Mandela said he would urge the
international community to maintain sanctions against South Africa.
   He said there had been no significant changes to the apartheid
laws and that President F.W. de Klerk had not presented a true
picture of South Africa during his recent European tour.
   Later Saturday, Mandela held talks with De Klerk at his offices
in Pretoria. Dicussions centered on progress which had been made on
last month's government-ANC accord and the need to reduce violence
in the country.
   His ANC is the leading group fighting the apartheid system of
racial segregation.
   Mandela was admitted to the private Park Lane Clinic on May 27
for what ANC officials initially described as a routine physical
examination. After an announcement he had undergone a minor
operation, the exact nature of the surgery was kept a secret for
five days.

   The dollar was higher in Europe late this morning
and trading was quiet due to the Whit Monday holiday celebrated in
many parts of the Continent. Gold fell in London.
   ``There's hardly any business in the market,'' said one trader in
Milan, Italy.
   The market also lacks direction because it ``is basically happy
where the dollar is right now,'' he said.
   In Japan, the dollar rose 0.25 yen to a closing 152.42 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at 152.60 yen. Currency dealers in
Tokyo attributed the rise to the successful summit meeting between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Washington.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.7016 West German marks, up from 1.6940

   The heat was on today in the Southwest, while much of the
Northeast and parts of the Midwest faced a threat of severe
thunderstorms.
   Forecasters predicted highs today of 110 degrees or more in
Southwest deserts and highs of more than 100 in parts of Texas and
central California.
   Cool, dry air pushed into the East today and was expected to
spawn more thunderstorms after portions of the Midwest were
devastated by tornadoes during the weekend.
   Strong thunderstorms developed Sunday night along and ahead of a
cold front in the Atlantic coast states. Strong thunderstorms
developed along a second cold front in the Ohio Valley and lower
Great Lakes region.
   Thunderstorms were expected in New York and New England. Light
winds and mostly sunny skies were forecast for the Midwest today,
with scattered showers and thunderstorms by tonight in Iowa and
surrounding states.
   Today's highs in the Pacific Northwest and the Great Lakes states
were forecast in the 50s and 60s.
   Rain fell early today in Maine, Texas and Washington state.
   Midland, Texas, set a record high Sunday for the date with a
reading of 103 degrees.
   The high Sunday in the Lower 48 states was 110 degrees in the
Arizona towns of Bullhead City, Phoenix and Yuma and in Palm

   Musician Bill Monroe earned a hometown hero's
welcome at the Bluegrass Festival, where he was honored with
plaques, proclamations and a medley of kind words.
   ``It's hats off to Bill Monroe, the boy that made Rosine
famous,'' festival organizer Stoy Geary told a cheering crowd
Saturday at the ``Hats Off to Bill Monroe'' ceremony in the western
Kentucky town.
   About 25 people crammed onto the stage to give the 78-year-old
Grammy award winner gifts ranging from a solid brass key to the
nearby town of Owensboro to a petition signed by 30,000 fans in
North Carolina.
   He also received an honorary brick with his name on it that is to
be placed in the sidewalk at a bluegrass museum planned for
Owensboro.
   ``When you get your name in concrete, you're doing all right,''
said Monroe, who paid tribute to his fans and touched briefly on the
impact of bluegrass music.
   ``Bluegrass music has made more friends than all the other kinds
of music put together,'' he said.
   ``Rosine, Kentucky, owns this music,'' said Monroe, who performed
some of his favorite songs. ``It belongs right here.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev had to travel all the way to
the United States for Soviet TV viewers to get a rare glimpse of
their president in a more casual setting.
   The 59-year-old Kremlin chief was shown Saturday and Sunday on
Soviet TV driving a golf cart at Camp David, Md., the American
presidential retreat, with President Bush at his side.
   In the past, Soviet summit coverage has included only the formal
comments made by the leaders.
   But in a break with tradition, Soviet television carried Bush's
and Gorbachev's informal remarks to reporters before and after their
meetings.
   The added comments appeared designed to stress to Soviet viewers
that their president would not be coming back to Moscow empty-handed.
   The midday Soviet television news broadcast today showed
Gorbachev touring the Control Data Corp. computer plant in
Minneapolis and meeting with capitalists. It also showed him amid
crowds of well-wishers on Minneapolis streets.
   Gorbachev's U.S. trip has dominated regularly scheduled newscasts
on government television.
   Television also has interrupted regular programming to carry
special broadcasts of Gorbachev's activities and a regular summit
feature called ``American Diary,'' including feature reports about
American life.
   Some of the TV commentary has pointedly drawn attention to
changes in international relations under Gorbachev.
   ``Only five years have elapsed since'' Gorbachev held his first
summit with then-President Ronald Reagan in Geneva, Switzerland, the
Soviet announcer said as Gorbachev prepared to board a helicopter
that would carry him from the Washington Mall to Andrews Air Force
Base en route to Minneapolis.
   ``And how many changes there have been both in our relations with
the United States and in world politics overall, how unrecognizable
the world has become in these years,'' the announcer said just
before a 21-gun salute marked Gorbachev's departure from Washington.
   None of the Soviet television coverage has contrasted Gorbachev's
triumphs abroad with his troubles at home, although broadcasts did
carry his answers to U.S. questions about the Soviet economy and
ethnic unrest.
   Sunday's TV highlight was a live hourlong broadcast of
Gorbachev's news conference with Bush.
   It included reporters' probing questions about Gorbachev's
opposition to allowing a united Germany to join the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, emigration of Soviet Jews to occupied
territories and his sanctions against secessionist Lithuania.
   Other special broadcasts have included Gorbachev's arrival
ceremony in Washington and his talk Friday with American writers,
scientists and other dignitaries at the Soviet Embassy in Washington.
   Soviet newspapers also have played up the summit. Pravda, the
paper of the Communist Party Central Committee, has carried daily
front-page stories.
   On Sunday, just below the masthead, Pravda headlined its summit
coverage ``A Step to a Safe Future.'' A black-and-white Tass
photograph showing a smiling Bush and Gorbachev standing side by
side was splashed across the fold of page one.
   The presidential wives have not been left out of the coverage,
either.
   Raisa Gorbachev was shown touring an exhibition of Russian
manuscripts at the Library of Congress in Washington and _ joined by
Barbara Bush _ kissing children and speaking to students at
Wellesley College in Massachusetts.
   ``People's diplomacy,'' the TV correspondent called it.
   Not all was perfect in the TV coverage, however.
   Gorbachev's remarks to huge crowds that flocked to him during two
unscheduled stops on the streets of Washington were not audible. The
message was all visual: Gorbachev shaking hands, and Americans
cheering for him.

<TEXT>
   A bomb planted by suspected Sikh militants
killed three children during a Hindu religious ceremony today and
two suspected separatists died in another explosion, officials said.
   Police said the explosions occurred in Patiala, 140 miles
southeast of Amritsar. At least 34 people, including 18 women and
children, were injured, police said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Villagers celebrating a Hindu religious festival were crowding
around booths selling sweetened water when the first blast occurred
this morning.
   Three children were killed immediately, police said.
   A short time later, two suspected Sikh extremists wheeled a
motorscooter into the festival site. A bomb on the scooter exploded,
killing the two men instantly, police said.
   Police said they believed the men had planned to plant the bomb
at the festival grounds.
   The deaths brought to 1,002 the number of people killed this year
in the Sikh separatist fight in Punjab state, a rich agricultural
region in India's north.
   Sikhs have a slight majority in Punjab, but nationwide they
comprise just 2 percent of India's 880 million people.
   Sikh militants have been fighting for an independent nation since
1982, claiming members of their sect are discriminated against by
Hindus, who make up 82 percent of India's population.

<TEXT>
   A pocket-sized spray version of cayenne pepper is
being used by growing numbers of police agencies to temporarily
disable drunks, drug addicts and snarling dogs, the device's
manufacturer says.
   Gardner Whitcomb, owner of Cap-Stun Inc., said his company's
sales have quadrupled this year to more than $1 million.
   More than 1,000 police agencies have switched from mace to
Cap-Stun since the FBI decided to switch to the pepper spray last
fall, The Denver Post reported today.
   Women concerned about a 57 percent surge in rapes in the Denver
area over the past year also are turning to Cap-Stun. But some
Denver police officials have doubts about its effectiveness.
   ``Unless it hits you right in the open eyes, it takes too long to
incapacitate you,'' said Sgt. Dave Abrams, supervisor of the Denver
Police Department's SWAT team. ``I've seen it take more than a
minute.''
   Whitcomb said Denver police spray at too close a range to allow
formation of a mist that can be inhaled.
   A Maryland chemist developed the spray 20 years ago when his
wife, summoned to court to testify about a holdup she witnessed,
wanted nonlethal protection against thugs who threatened her life.
   Cap-Stun is supposed to stop dogs and intoxicated or drugged
criminals, who often are unaffected or angered by mace. The pepper
attacks membranes inside the nose.
   The spray does not have lasting effects, promising reduced
brutality charges against police.

<HEAD>Talks Cut Short When Khmer Rouge Failes To Appear</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Talks aimed at reaching agreement on a cease-fire in
Cambodia's 11-year-old civil war recessed after just 25 minutes
today when the Khmer Rouge representative failed to appear.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials awaited contact from the four
warring factions on a resumption of the first peace conference held
in Japan since World War II, but prospects did not appear
encouraging.
   The Khmer Rouge, militarily the strongest group in the loose
three-party guerrilla coalition fighting the Vietnam-installed
government of Premier Hun Sen, had said it came to Tokyo ready to
sign a cease-fire accord.
   But it said it could not participate in negotiations that it
described as two-sided peace talks led by Hun Sen and Prince Norodom
Sihanouk, head of the guerrilla coalition.
   Hun Sen has refused to accept the Khmer Rouge as a potential
equal participant in an interim government, suggesting the radical
communists could return to power and preside over another reign of
terror.
   Previous Cambodian peace talks also have floundered over a future
government role for the Khmer Rouge. Hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians died during the Khmer Rouge's 1975-1979 rule, when it
tried to turn the country into a primitive agrarian commune.
   Vietnam invaded the country and drove the Khmer Rouge from power.
It claims to have withdrawn all its troops from the country last
fall.
   Japanese Foreign Ministry officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they could not comment on the reasons for the recess
in today's brief talks or their content.
   ``Everything now is stagnant because of this question,'' one
said. Asked about prospects for the talks' resumption, he said, ``We
don't know yet and we don't know yet what happened today.''
   After the talks recessed, the participants continued to hold
informal discussions in other rooms of the Akasaka Palace, the
ministry officials said.
   Japan agreed to a suggestion from Thailand in April that it act
as host to talks between Hun Sen and Sihanouk to maintain momentum
in the Cambodian peace process. But Sihanouk said the Khmer Rouge's
nominal leader, Khieu Samphan, and conservative former Premier Son
Sann, leader of the third guerrilla faction, also should take part.
   Japanese officials prepared a circular negotiating table that
they hoped would solve the problem of a negotiating format, with
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama surrounded on one side by
Hun Sen and three representatives of his government, and on the
other by Sihanouk, Son Sann, Sihanouk's son Prince Ranariddh, and
Khieu Samphan.
   But the Khmer Rouge said the formula still resulted in talks
between two sides, not among four warring parties.
   Also in Tokyo to observe the talks was Thai Defense Minister
Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, a key mediator between the Cambodian groups
who was instrumental in drafting the proposed cease-fire.
   While other faction leaders were meeting in Akasaka Palace, Khieu
Samphan paid a 20-minute visit to Chavalit's hotel room in another
part of Tokyo.
   Both sides refused to comment on their discussions, but the Khmer
Rouge leader told reporters afterward he had boycotted the peace
talks ``because there are many problems.''
   ``I'm here to sign the peace agreement,'' he said.
   Sihanouk has repeatedly pledged he will sign a cease-fire
agreement in Tokyo regardless of what happens, but also has said the
Khmer Rouge should be included.
   Fighting has intensified in Cambodia in recent weeks, with the
guerrillas claiming victories in many parts of the country. The
cease-fire agreement scheduled for signing in Tokyo reportedly has
no measures for supervising a truce or new elections.
   The five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council _ the
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France and China _ are to
hold talks on Cambodia in Paris in July.
   The United Nations has recognized the guerrilla coalition as the
legitimate government of Cambodia, and Hun Sen has therefore
resisted U.N. participation in peace plans.

   Actor Sir Rex Harrison, lauded by colleagues as a
master of high comedy who talked with the animals as the lovable Dr.
Dolittle, died Saturday of pancreatic cancer. He was 82.
   The award-winning actor is remembered for his wit and charm as
well as his versatility and skill during a 66-year career on the
stage and screen.
   Harrison died in his sleep at his Manhattan home.
   Harrison debuted on Broadway in 1936 and last performed there May
11 as Lord Porteous in the revival of ``The Circle,'' W. Somerset
Maugham's 1920s comedy.
   Harrison became inexorably linked with the Henry Higgins
character in ``My Fair Lady,'' winning a Tony award in 1957 for the
Broadway version and an Academy Award in 1964 for the film version.
   Another of his more notable roles was that of Dr. Dolittle, who
talked with the animals and taught them to speak back in the 1967
movie named for his character.

   Although President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev remain at odds over the future alignment of a
unified Germany, leaders of the two Germany states say the
superpower summit has improved conditions for merging their
countries.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Sunday that the
Washington summit ``has further improved the international
conditions for the unity process between the Germanys.''
   His foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, and East German
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere also said they saw the summit as
improving conditions for German unity and disarmament.
   ``The resolution of the uttermost aspects of German unity
requires new and far-reaching progress in the CSCE-process, in
disarmament, and in the overall cooperation between West and East,
especially in the area of economics,'' Kohl said in a statement.
   The CSCE, or 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe, deals with military security, economic cooperation and human
rights.
   Kohl said progress in reducing long-range nuclear weapons, the
beginning of a worldwide ban on chemical weapons and the ending of
nuclear testing were equally important.
   In addition, Kohl said U.S. readiness to expand trade with the
Soviets was of ``psychological importance ... to promote the reform
politics of President Gorbachev.''
   In an interview with West German TV, Genscher called the summit
``a great success with its positive aspects that will also have
positive results on the developments in Europe.
   ``And that means also for the Europeans and the unification of
Germany, because relations of the two superpowers with each other
have fundamentally improved.''
   De Maiziere, also interviewed by West German TV, said the summit
showed the superpowers were rethinking their approach to security.
   ``The deciding message that I think I heard is that in the area
of stabilizing security they are having new and very different
ideas,'' de Maiziere said of Bush and Gorbachev.
   ``They are trying not to define the security theme militarily _
not end it with rocket counting _ but with considerations of
economic ties, with cultural ties,'' de Maiziere said.
   During their summit, Bush and Gorbachev signed a treaty that
drastically slashes chemical weapons. The two leaders also issued a
statement breaking the deadlock on efforts to reduce long-range
nuclear arms.
   In addition, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and his Soviet
counterpart Eduard Shevardnadze have indicated that prospects for
reduction of conventional forces in Europe had improved.
   The Soviet Union had been balking at a plan to cut the
superpowers' troops to 195,000 for each side in Central Europe.
   Gorbachev, concerned about the military strength of a united
Germany, has opposed Bush's demand that the new nation be a full
member of NATO. The issue was discussed extensively on Thursday, the
first day of the summit, but was set aside so the leaders could
focus on other matters.
   At their joint news conference Sunday, Bush said he and Gorbachev
had a better understanding of their differences on the issue of
German alignment. ``But I'm not sure we narrowed them.'' Bush said.
   Gorbachev had threatened to review the Soviet defense strategy
and delay the pullout of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe if a
united Germany insists on joining the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   Baker was to give Genscher a full report in Copenhagen, Denmark,
during a meeting that began today of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
   As of July 2, the two German nations will start to merge their
economies, and the West German mark will replace the virtually
worthless East German currency.
   East Germany's first non-Communist government came to power after
elections in March, following the ouster of hard-line Communist
leaders late last year.

   ``City of Angels,'' a satire of gumshoe fiction
and Hollywood, was named best musical of the Broadway season, and
the Tony Award for best play went to an adaptation of John
Steinbeck's ``The Grapes of Wrath.''
   ``City of Angels'' won six Tonys overall, more than any other
production, in a ceremony Sunday at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater.
``Grand Hotel'' won five. The event was televised by CBS.
   The big loser was August Wilson's ``The Piano Lesson,'' which won
no Tonys even though it had five nominations, including best play,
and had won both the Pulitzer Prize and New York Drama Critics
Circle award.
   Tyne Daly, formerly of television's ``Cagney and Lacey,'' was
named best actress in a musical as the brassy stage mother Mama Rose
in ``Gypsy,'' a role originated by Ethel Merman 30 years ago. The
show also won as best revival.
   Robert Morse won as best actor in a play for his portrayal of
writer Truman Capote in ``Tru.'' Morse's competition included
Charles S. Dutton in ``The Piano Lesson'' and Dustin Hoffman as
Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice.''
   ``I'm just so grateful to be back here,'' said Morse, who last
won a Tony in 1962 for ``How to Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying.''
   Maggie Smith won as best actress for ``Lettice &amp; Lovage.''
Margaret Tyzack, in the same play, won for best featured, or
supporting, actress. Charles Durning, Big Daddy in the revival of
``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' won the best featured actor Tony.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' an adaptation by Frank Galati of the
novel about Dust Bowl Okies, also won a directing Tony for Galati.
In accepting his award, Galati paid tribute to Steinbeck's widow,
Elaine, and his ``enduring genius.''
   ``City of Angels'' a jazzy production set in 1940s Hollywood,
picked up the best actor prize for James Naughton, the show's
hardboiled detective.
   ``How sweet it is,'' he cracked.
   The musical also won awards for featured actress, Randy Graff as
a love-starved secretary; best book, Larry Gelbart; score, composer
Cy Coleman and lyricist David Zippel; and set design, Robin Wagner.
   Among the five awards for ``Grand Hotel,'' set in Berlin in the
years before Hitler, were two for Tommy Tune for direction and
choreography.
   ``When we were out of town, I didn't quite have the choreography
right,'' Tune said. ``I would like to thank the director for not
firing me.''
   ``Grand Hotel'' also won Michael Jeter a Tony as best featured
actor in a musical for his role as a dying bookkeeper dancing wildly
on a last fling.
   ``If you have got a problem with alcohol and you can't stop and
think life can't change and dreams can't come true, I stand here as
living proof that you can stop,'' he said in accepting the award.
``It changes a day at a time and dreams come true.''
   Costume designer Santo Loquasto and lighting designer Jules
Fisher both won Tonys for ``Grand Hotel.''
   Ron Silver, a presenter, made a speech supporting the National
Endowment for the Arts, which is under attack for funding art some
consider indecent. Silver also mentioned the anniversary of the
crackdown at Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   During a commercial break, executive producer Joe Cates asked for
no more references to those subjects. ``To take advantage of a live
television show that way does incredible harm,'' he said.
   But a winner after that, Galati, mentioned the endowment. ``Were
he alive, there would be no louder voice in support for the National
Endowment for the Arts than John Steinbeck,'' Galati said.
   Alfred Drake, who starred on Broadway in ``Oklahoma!'' ``Kismet''
and ``Kiss Me, Kate,'' received a special Tony.
   The Seattle Repertory Theater won a special Tony and $25,000 for
outstanding regional theater.
   The Tony Awards were begun in 1947 by the American Theater Wing
and are named for actress Antoinette Perry. They are voted on by
people working in Broadway theater and by theater journalists.

   Thomas Baal sent love to his parents
before he was put to death by lethal injection. It was an execution
he fought for over his parents' court objections.
   Baal, 26, was executed Sunday for fatally slashing a Las Vegas
bus driver. His parents had tried to intervene, saying he was
mentally incompetent and should not have been allowed to decide for
himself to die or appeal.
   ``Send my love to my mama and my papa,'' Nevada State Prison
Warden Pete Demosthenes quoted as Baal's last words.
   State Prison Director Ron Angelone said Baal told him to tell his
parents, Edwin and Doris Baal of Mesa, Colo., that ``Jesus was
taking him home and he was not scared.''
   The execution came 10 hours after the U.S. Supreme Court voted
5-4 to allow it.
   At Baal's parents' request and over his objections, the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had stayed the execution
Saturday, saying a lower court erred in not holding a hearing on
whether Baal was mentally competent to appeal. The Supreme Court
majority held there was no basis for that conclusion.
   Baal was executed for the Feb. 26, 1988, killing of bus driver
Frances Maves, 34. She was robbed and stabbed while inspecting her
bus at an airport in Las Vegas.
   According to Baal, she gave him $20 when he asked for money, but
he demanded more and a struggle ensued. ``You shouldn't have done
that,'' he said, according to his confession. ``Now you pay. I
sentence you to death.''
   Before the execution got under way, Baal looked through viewing
windows at the 24 witnesses and tried to speak to Dan Seaton, the
prosecutor in the case. Seaton said he couldn't make out what Baal
was saying.
   After that, Baal appeared to talk to himself, then closed his
eyes as the lethal injections began.
   Baal spent a sleepless night in a cell next to the death chamber
and made a last confession to the prison chaplain, prison spokesman
Glen Whorton said.
   ``He was glad it was finally going forward and he started to make
phone calls to friends and relatives,'' Whorton said.
   Andy Anderson of Reno, an opponent of abortion and capital
punishment, was one of several people protesting the daybreak
execution. He knelt for two hours on the hood of his car in the
parking lot outside the prison.
   A votive candle on the hood beside him was blown out by a gust of
wind, ``just like the life that was snuffed out this morning,'' he
said.
   Baal's execution was Nevada's fifth and the 129th nationally
since the U.S. Supreme Court in 1976 cleared the way for states to
resume use of the death penalty.

   British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell is
putting up $50 million to help establish a global research center
named for Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Te $100 million Gorbachev Maxwell Institute of Technology was
announced Sunday during the Soviet president's visit to Minnesota.
The institute will mix U.S., Soviet and European scientists and will
be in the Twin Cities.
   It will cope with issues ``that matter to humanity,'' such as
environmental warming, communications, health and food, Maxwell said.
   The remaining $50 million is to be raised by Gov. Rudy Perpich
and a committee of Minnesotans. The project got an immediate lift
from Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland Co., who
donated $1 million.
   Gorbachev said the institute represents ``yet another element of
common cooperation which seems to be merging and developing between
our countries, between many countries of the world, and on the human
level, too.''
   ``We join our efforts to address and come to grips with problems
that are of concern to all of us,'' he said.
   Maxwell, chairman and chief executive officer of London-based
Maxwell Communication Corp., said the institute is a tribute to the
thawing of relations between the superpowers.
   ``I know of no better way to show that we in Europe are grateful
to President Gorbachev, as well as President Bush for ending the
Cold War, because what happened at Yalta was not particularly to our
liking,'' he said.
   Maxwell Communications' North American headquarters are in the
Twin Cities.
   The governor has been pressing for a major research center in
Minnesota for several years. He met with Maxwell in London in
September.
   Maxwell Communications holds 20 percent equity in St. Paul's Webb
Publishing Co., which specializes in general printing and publishing
company-owned magazines. Maxwell, who bought Macmillan Inc. in New
York two years ago, is chairman and chief executive officer of
Britain's Mirror Group PLC, which publishes the Daily Mirror, the
United Kingdom's second-largest newspaper.

<HEAD>Teacher-of-the-Year Faces Losing Her Job</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Weeks after winning a statewide
teacher-of-the-year award, Eleanor Larrabee was called out of the
classroom and told she was losing her job to budget cuts.
   The City Council has since won her a reprieve.
   ``It took two minutes. I was mute. I could only nod,'' said Mrs.
Larrabee, recalling how Westfield school authorities told her last
month she was being ``bumped'' from the job by a middle-school
teacher with greater seniority.
   In March, she had been named the top teacher in Massachusetts by
Junior Achievement, a group that fosters entrepreneurship in young
people. She also finished fourth in the organization's national
competition.
   Mrs. Larrabee and 41 other city teachers were handed layoff
notices when the School Committee proposed cutting 120 jobs out of
nearly 650 in the district. The committee also proposed eliminating
athletics and busing for students living within two miles of school.
   Cuts are necessary because the school's $20 million operating
budget is being cut by $2.2 million. Local government districts
around Massachusetts are grappling with cuts because of a state
budget crisis.
   But the way the School Committee proposed to make up the
shortfall was too much for the City Council.
   It condemned the schools' decision as ``irresponsible'' and voted
9-2 Thursday to send back the proposed budget. The council ordered
the School Committee to reorder its spending priorities so no
teachers would be let go.
   School Superintendent William C. Allard said he couldn't make the
cuts in any other way. ``We are not crying wolf,'' he said. The
School Committee is due to meet Tuesday to discuss the council's
order.
   Mrs. Larrabee said ``it would be wonderful'' if the council
action would help her and other teachers keep their jobs.
   She had worked in a bank for 18 years before becoming a teacher
at Westfield High five years ago. She said her experience in what
she calls ``the real world'' aided her development of innovative
school projects that aimed at teaching youngsters economics by
having them set up small businesses.
   ``Everyone was shocked when I went back to school. But I love
children and I thought `I have nothing to lose,''' she said. ``And
when I finally got into teaching, I realized this was it. This was
what I was meant for.''

<HEAD>Frederick's of Hollywood Founder Frederick Mellinger Dead at 76</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT JABLON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frederick Mellinger, whose Frederick's of
Hollywood designed women's lingerie from a man's point of view, has
died of pneumonia at age 76.
   The exuberant purveyor of purple satin bustiers, edible panties
and peekaboo bras died Saturday night at his Los Angeles home, said
Morton Field, the family attorney. Private services were scheduled
for today, he said.
   ``He truly revolutionized lingerie in this country,'' said Ellen
Appel, a publicist. ``When other people were making traditional,
white, boring lingerie, he was making very glamorous lingerie:
peignoirs, baby dolls.''
   Born in New York City, Mellinger got his start when he lied about
his age _ then 14 _ to get a clerical job at an ``intimate apparel''
firm. It was there that he learned the art of mail-order
merchandising.
   In 1946, he opened Frederick's Fifth Avenue in New York, a
mail-order business selling products that his World War II Army
buddies told him they would like to see their girlfriends wear.
   A year later, Mellinger moved the store to Los Angeles. Over the
next four decades, the bright purple, Art Deco headquarters on
Hollywood Boulevard became a landmark.
   In the 1960s, Mellinger began to open outlets in malls. There are
now 160 stores and sales reached more than $80 million last year,
said Ms. Appel.
   Mellinger was the guiding spirit of the company, designing
brassieres with names like ``Rising Star'' and ``Cadillac,'' and
teaching himself French, Spanish and German in order to work with
European suppliers.
   Frederick's explicit catalogs, offering scantily-clad models, sex
toys, body oils and X-rated videos, were mailed to thousands of
American homes, making Frederick's of Hollywood a household name.
   From the sex-kitten '50s, women moved into the liberated '60s and
'70s, but Frederick's continued to offer its collection of padded
and ``pointed missile'' bras, as well as garter belts and G-strings.
   ``He stuck by his principles,'' Ms. Appel said. ``Women in the
'70s, during the heights of the liberation movement, were picketing
Frederick's of Hollywood. He used to say, `Fashions may change, but
sex appeal is always in style.'''
   These days, rock star Madonna sports Frederick's-style lingerie
on her concert tours, and most department stores stock clingy
``unmentionables.''
   Yet styles do change, and in 1984, the firm suffered its first
yearly loss, a $148,000 shortfall.
   Mellinger stepped down as chairman and chief executive, and the
new management set about changing Frederick's image, deleting sexual
aids and X-rated videos from company catalogs and adding more
wholesome-looking models.
   Last fall, the purple Hollywood headquarters was painted gray.
   Mellinger is survived by his wife, Harriett; a son; a daughter;
and five grandchildren.

<HEAD>Premiers to Meet Again in Effort to Save Meech Lake Accord</HEAD>

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney says Canada's
provincial ministers have agreed to continue closed-door discussions
to try to settle a constitutional rift that has prompted talk of
Quebec's secession.
   An informal dinner meeting Sunday night in Hull, Quebec, across
the Ottawa River from the national Parliament, was called in hopes
of moving toward a full-scale conference.
   Mulroney emerged from the five-hour meeting to say ``we still
haven't finished our work'' and that provinical leaders would
reconvene this morning in Ottawa.
   The provincial leaders are discussing the Meech Lake agreement, a
proposed amendment designed to convince Quebec to sign Canada's 1982
national constitution.
   Quebec refused to sign the document, saying that the
French-speaking province's distinct nature had not been taken into
consideration.
   ``I remain optimistic,'' said Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa.
``It seemed there was a will to break the impasse. All the premiers
realized the seriousness of the situation.''
   In 1987, the 10 provincial premiers and Mulroney signed the
five-point Meech Lake accord _ named for the site of the signing at
a lake near Ottawa _ as a way to protect Quebec's culture and
language. They set a deadline of June 23, 1990, to win ratification
by all 10 provincial legislatures.
   Since then, however, governments in three provinces have changed
and the new premiers have refused to go along with the agreement,
throwing the country into crisis and leading to talk about Quebec
secession and even a breakup of Canada.
   The most controversial of the five points in the accord is the
one designating Quebec as a ``distinct society.'' The other four
points concern methods of amending the constitution, the power of
provinces to opt out of some federal-provincial spending programs,
nominations to the supreme court and Senate reform.
   Bourassa insisted that ``the Meech Lake accord must be ratified
as is.'' Quebec's concessions were made in 1987, he said, and ``it's
not realistic to presume that I can go before the national assembly
to ratify an amended Meech Lake.''
   Nationalism has been on the rise in recent months in Quebec,
where many feel they are being rejected by English Canada.

   Students here found a ticket for a ride
down memory lane in a wallet they returned to the owner who lost it
40 years ago.
   Three Central High School students were helping their French
teacher clean out a closet Friday when one of the students, Arvis
Owens, found a torn, fake-alligator-skin green wallet.
   The four didn't find any money, but did find yellowing
photographs, a 3-cent stamp and a hand-written driver's license
dated Jan. 30, 1950, the Beaumont Enterprise Journal reported
Saturday.
   Teacher Kris Galles made a few phone calls using the phone book
and the name and Beaumont address listed on the license _ Patricia
Graves, 385 Gober Road.
   After three calls, Ms. Galles found Ms. Graves' stepmother, who
gave her the current phone number.
   Ms. Graves, now married and named Patricia Henderson, said she
did not recall losing the wallet. But her face lit up when she
pulled out 40-year-old pictures of her little sister and her
17-year-old self in ``pin-up girl'' poses.
   ``We thought we were quite something back then,'' she said.
   She also found a picture of her first date.
   Mrs. Henderson, now a drainage district commissioner in Beaumont,
said she was thrilled to have the wallet back and to find the
students so interested.
   ``I feel great. It has brought back a lot of very fond
memories,'' she said. ``Imagine that somebody else would be excited
about a part of my past.''

<TEXT>
   Rival Democrats Harvey Gantt and Mike
Easley, entering the closing hours of their Senate runoff primary,
are concentrating their fire on Republican Sen. Jesse Helms. But
across the continent, California Democrats are slamming each other.
   North Carolina and California are among nine states holding
primaries on Tuesday, the busiest day so far of the 1990 election
year. The other states are Alabama, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New
Jersey, New Mexico and South Dakota.
   As they entered the final 24 hours before voters cast their
ballots, candidates checked opinion polls, unleashed their final
television ads and tried to stir support with a closing round of
personal appearances.
   Two new polls of potential voter sentiment in the bitterly fought
race for the Democratic nomination for governor of California showed
former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein maintaining a lead over
state Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
   The Los Angeles Times poll said Feinstein had a 13-point lead _ a
gain of two points over a similar survey early in May. The poll gave
the former mayor 42 percent and Van de Kamp 29 percent. There were
29 percent still undecided or supporting one of the nine minor
candidates on the Democratic primary ballot.
   Mervin Field's California Poll, which gave Feinstein a slim 3
percent lead earlier this month, reported that margin had opened up
to 8 points over Van de Kamp, 42-34, in polling that concluded
Sunday. New polls also were out in Iowa and New Mexico.
   In North Carolina, Easley accused Helms of attacking him with
``personal character assassinations'' in radio ads. ``They are
personal and very negative,'' the Brunswick County prosecutor told
supporters Sunday.
   One Helms ad accuses Easley of waffling on the issues and another
suggests that he plea-bargained a drug case involving a campaign
contributor's son who was caught with nearly a pound of cocaine.
   Easley said he was countering with ads saying, ``This year North
Carolina must say no to Jesse Helms and mudslinging.''
   ``I think Charlotte people believed long before anyone else that
we are going to bring Jesse Helms home,'' Gantt told supporters
Sunday night in Charlotte, N.C.
   Abortion was the issue of the day in California where Sen. Pete
Wilson had only token opposition for the GOP nomination to succeed
fellow Republican George Deukmejian in the governor's office.
Deukmejian declined to seek a third term.
   Van de Kamp appeared on the steps of the Los Angeles County
Courthouse with Norma McCorvey, the ``Jane Roe'' of the landmark
U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade abortion rights decision.
   ``I have no criticism of Mrs. Feinstein's record (on abortion),''
McCorvey said. ``But I believe John Van de Kamp is the candidate who
will do the most to protect a woman's right to choose. I trust John
Van de Kamp.''
   Feinstein also stressed her long support of abortion rights,
telling fund-raisers in West Hollywood that ``I believe that a woman
is best protected by another woman who believes in the right to
choose.''
   The two candidates were running television commercials harshly
attacking each other.
   Van de Kamp's commercials described Feinstein as a ``Republican
in Democratic clothing,'' while the former mayor's ads accused the
attorney general of refusing to ``talk about his own record.''
   Abortion also has been a major issue in Iowa's Democratic primary
for governor. The National Abortion Rights Action League endorsed
Iowa House speaker Don Avenson in a move designed to help him
against anti-abortion rival Tom Miller, the state attorney general.
Republican Gov. Terry Branstad is an abortion opponent.
   A new poll, published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, said
Avenson had moved into the lead with support from 32 percent of
those surveyed, compared with 25 percent for Miller. Former banker
John Chrystal was at 19 percent, and 20 percent said they were
undecided.
   The newspaper said the sampling was among 629 likely primary
voters and had a margin of error of 3.9 percent.
   ``It's breaking our way, obviously,'' said Avenson.
   In New Mexico, large fields were seeking the gubernatorial
nomination in both parties. Incumbent GOP Gov. Garrey Carruthers was
ineligible to seek re-election, but the person elected to succeed
him will be the first New Mexico governor allowed to serve two
successive terms.
   A new poll published Sunday in the Albuquerque Journal said state
Senate Minority Leader Les Houston and former legislator Frank Bond
each had the support of 29.2 percent of the registered Republicans
surveyed.
   On the Democratic side, former Gov. Bruce King had the backing of
42.7 percent, while state Attorney General Paul Bardacke was
supported by 31.5 percent.
   The poll was conducted for the Journal by Research and Polling
Inc. of Albuquerque, which surveyed 664 registered Democrats and 402
registered Republicans. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4
percent for the Democrats and 5 percent for the Republicans.
   A large field was battling in Alabama for the Democratic
nomination to oppose GOP Gov. Guy Hunt, the first Republican to hold
that office since the post-Civil War Reconstruction period.
   Among the Democratic contenders was former Gov. Fob James who was
taped recently by a public television crew while telling a
Republican Party official that ``there ain't but one damn Goldwater
Republican in this race, and you know who that is.''
   An aide to James, a former Republican, said the remark was ``a
joke more than anything.''
   In Montana, four Republicans were vying for the nomination to
oppose Democratic Sen. Max Baucus.
   In Mississippi, Republican Sen. Thad Cochran was as good as
re-elected to a third term. He had no primary opposition and no
Democrat has filed to run against him in the fall.
   Democratic Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey and Howell Heflin of
Alabama had only token primary opposition. The same was true of
Republican Sens. Larry Pressler of South Dakota and Pete Domenici of
New Mexico.
   Gantt and Easley worked hard to get out their core supporters.
   ``There are a lot of voters out there, especially in the East,
that we ought to be able to pick up,'' Easley said while campaigning
in the eastern part of the state. ``If we have a big turnout in the
East, Mike Easley will win the runoff. If we don't it'll be real
close.''
   Gantt sought votes in the same region over the weekend,
especially in the northeast, which has a high percentage of black
voters who were critical in the May 8 primary when the former mayor
of Charlotte led a six-man field.
   But Gantt fell short of the 40 percent threshold he needed to
avoid a runoff and become the first black candidate for statewide
office in North Carolina this century.

   Fellow actors mourned Sir Rex Harrison as a
master of high comedy who played the crotchety elocutionist in ``My
Fair Lady'' and talked with the animals as the lovable Dr. Dolittle
during a 66-year career.
   The Tony- and Oscar-winning actor, remembered for his wit and
charm as well as his versatility and skill on the stage and screen,
died in his sleep early Saturday at his Manhattan home. He was 82.
   Harrison had been ill only a short time and did not know he had
pancreatic cancer, said his attorney, Harold Schiff. His doctors had
told him he was suffering from gallbladder trouble.
   ``He didn't want to know,'' Schiff said.
   Harrison debuted on Broadway in 1936 and last performed there on
May 11 as Lord Porteous in the revival of ``The Circle,'' W.
Somerset Maugham's 1920s comedy.
   ``He died with his boots on, no question about it,'' said Elliot
Martin, producer of ``The Circle'' and three other Harrison shows.
   Harrison became inexorably linked with the Henry Higgins
character in ``My Fair Lady,'' winning a Tony award in 1957 for his
Broadway run with Julie Andrews and an Academy Award in 1964 for his
screen version opposite Audrey Hepburn.
   ``To watch him and to work with him was a joyful experience. I
doubt there was anyone before like him,'' Andrews said. ``The
theater has lost an extraordinary one-of-a-kind.''
   Hepburn called him ``the quintessential actor.''
   Actress Lynn Redgrave called Harrison ``the master of high comedy
playing.''
   ``Nobody knows how to do what he did. He gave high comedy a
danger, accuracy and razor sharpness, and at the same time it
appeared to be completely effortless. You could never see the joke
coming,'' she said from San Diego.
   ``My Fair Lady,'' a musical version of George Bernard Shaw's
``Pygmalion,'' was revived in 1981 with Harrison reprising his role
for $50,000 a week.
   ``Mr. Harrison is perfect in the part _ crisp, lean, complacent
and condescending until at last a real flare of human emotions burns
the egotism away,'' reviewer Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times
wrote at the time of the premiere in 1956.
   Harrison, who characterized his vocal range as ``one and a half
notes,'' crooned ``I've grown accustomed to her face'' hundreds of
times as the stuffy language professor who falls in love with a
Cockney waif after teaching her to speak proper English.
   ``I could have played Higgins for 20 years, but I wanted to do
other things,'' Harrison said in 1985. ``And I did, in fact.''
   Among them was his role as Dr. Dolittle, the man who talked with
the animals and taught them to speak back. The 1967 film introduced
Harrison to a new generation of young moviegoers. His other
best-know movies included ``Major Barbara'' in 1940 and ``Blithe
Spirit'' in 1945.
   ``He had the best sense of humor of almost any actor I have ever
known,'' said his agent, Lawrence Evans, who worked with Harrison
for more than 40 years. ``He was a lovable, irascible man.''
   Harrison was born in Huyton, near Liverpool, on March 5, 1908,
and joined the Liverpool Repertory Theatre in 1924.
   His first appearance on the London stage was in 1930. By the end
of the decade he emerged as a star, appearing in Sir Terence
Rattigan's ``French Without Tears'' from 1936 to 1938. The actor
last appeared on the London stage in ``The Admirable Crichton'' in
1988.
   In addition to his awards for ``My Fair Lady,'' Harrison won a
Tony for his portrayal of Henry VIII in Maxwell Anderson's ``Anne of
the Thousand Days'' and a special American Theater Award for his
overall stage achievements. He was knighted last year by Queen
Elizabeth II.
   Harrison was married six times. He is survived by his current
wife, Mercia Tinker; two sons by previous marriages, Noel and Carey,
and their children; and his sister.
   His third wife, actress Kay Kendall, died of leukemia in 1959.
Years later, Harrison starred in Rattigan's ``In Praise of Love,''
the story of a man whose wife is dying of an incurable disease and
is forbidden by doctors from telling her.
   Harrison's funeral service will be private, but there will be a
memorial get-together June 18 at a Manhattan church. Schiff said
Harrison had requested that it be called a ``memorial celebration''
and feature jazz.

<HEAD>Court to Decide If Passengers Can Sue in Near-Crashes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court agreed today to decide
whether passengers on international flights may sue airlines for
emotional distress allegedly suffered in near-crashes that cause
them no physical harm.
   The court said it will review a ruling that Eastern Airlines may
be forced to pay passengers on a flight that landed safely in Miami
after all the plane's engines failed briefly in the air.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that the
so-called Wa an international air travel treaty,
permits airlines to be sued in such cases rsaw Convention,by passengers
who suffer
only psychological trauma.
   An airline is required by the treaty to pay up to $75,000 per
person, depending on the severity of injuries. The liability ceiling
is lifted only if the airline is shown to have committed willful
misconduct.
   The treaty only covers international flights. In domestic
flights, the law of the state in which a lawsuit was filed would
apply. Lawyers for Eastern Airlines said in most states passengers
on domestic flights who can prove negligence _ but not willful
misconduct _ would be barred from recovering damages for emotional
distress unaccompanied by physical injury.
   The 11th Circuit court ruled in the case of Eastern Flight 855,
which left Miami on May 5est in Hong Kong
where about 100,000 demonstrated. Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule
in 1997.
   Smaller demonstrations were held in Taiwan, Japan, Britain,
Canada and the United States.

<HEAD>Court Agrees to Hear Case Involving Immigrant Farmworkers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to hear a Bush
administration appeal aimed at giving federal officials more power
to deny temporary legal status to immigrant farmworkers.
   The court, without comment, said it will review a ruling that
said the workers are entitled to various procedural protections when
applying for such residential permits.
   The case stems from a 1988 lawsuit by the Haitian Refugee Center,
the Migration and Refugee Services of the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Palm Beach, Fla., and 17 applicants for temporary residence. The
class-action suit is intended to benefit thousands of aliens.
   The suit said applicants for temporary residency were being
denied their rights under a 1986 federal law that established a
program for admitting foreign farmworkers to the United States.
   To be eligible for the program, aliens must have applied during
an 18-month period that ended Nov. 30, 1988, and have done migrant
farm work for at least 90 days during a one-year period that ended
May 1, 1986.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a federal
judge's ruling that required the Immigration and Naturalization
Service (INS) to take a number of steps to assure applicants are
treated fairly when interviewed for temporary residency.
   Thosnslators, permitting applicants to present witnesses and
requiring INS interviewers to explain what evidence they relied on
in ruling on applications.
   The appeals court said the 1986 immigration law ``granted aliens
a constitutionally protected right to apply for temporary residency
as well as a right to substantiate their claims for eligibility.
Once Congress chooses to create such a system of entitlements ... a
property interest is created that is accorded procedural due process
protection.''
   Bush administration lawyers, in the appeal acted on today, said
the law does not give federal judges such sweeping authority.
   The 11th Circuit Court ruling ``has sanctioned the improper
intervention of federal district courts into the day-to-day business
of administering the immigration laws,'' the government lawyers said.
   The appeal said INS has received more than 1.3 million
applications under the 1986 law for temporary residency and approved
93 percent of them. But the appeal said tens of thousands of
applications for temporary permits could be affected by the appeals
court ruling.
   The appeal added that the 11th Circuit court's ruling could have
a bearing on additional thousands of applications for permanent
residential status under the 1986 law.
   The case is McNary vs. Haitian Refugee Center, 89-1332.

   John C. Quinn Jr., managing editor of the
Poughkeepsie (N.Y.) Journal, was killed when a van driven by his
brother slammed into a tree, state police said today.
   Quinn, 34, was pronounced dead Sunday night on arrival at
Westerly Hospital, said state police Capt. Donald Kettelle. Quinn's
26-year-old brother, Christopher, who was driving the van, was
treated and released, Kettelle said.
   The men were sons of John C. Quinn, former editor of USA Today,
who retired as a Gannett Co. Inc. executive in April.
   John C. Quinn Jr. joined the Journal in January 1987 after 5{
years at The Providence Journal-Bulletin, where he started as a copy
editor and rose to become assistant managing editor for Sunday
sections, his father said.
   Quinn, a 1977 graduate of Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., also
served internships at Gannett papers in Huntington, W.Va., and
Agana, Guam, and in editing positions at the Statesman-Journal in
Salem, Ore.
   The van hit a tree on a curve along a rural stretch of State
Highway 112 north of the village of Carolina.
   The state police report said that what appeared to be bottles and
cans of beer were found in the car and officers were investigating
whether the accident was alcohol-related.
   Christoper Quinn would be charged with refusing to take a
blood-alcohol test, Kettelle said. He refused to do so on advice of
his attorney, the captain said.
   Quinn Jr. also is survived by another brother, Richard, of
Washington, D.C., and by a sister, Lo-anne Quinn Cellar of Richmond,
his father said.

<HEAD>Court Allows Whistleblowers to Sue Employers for Personal Injury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear industry ``whistleblowers'' who say
they were disciplined for complaining about lax safety may sue their
employers under state personal injury laws, the Supreme Court ruled
today.
   The court unanimously said such lawsuits are not pre-empted by a
federal law protecting such whistleblowers.
   Today's ruling carries significant effect. The federal law does
not provide awards of punitive damages, often the most lucrative
part of a successful suit under the corresponding state laws.
   ``We conclude that (a) claim for intentional infliction of
emotional distress does not fall within the pre-empted field of
nuclear safety,'' Justice Harry A. Blackmun wrote for the court.
   The decision is a victory for Vera English of Wilmington, N.C.,
who worked as a laboratory technician for General Electric at its
nuclear fuels manufacturing plant there for almost 12 years before
she was fired in July 1984.
   Today's decision reinstates her suit after it was ordered
dismissed by a federal appeals court.
   Earlier that year, Ms. English had complained to both the federal
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and to her GE supervisor about what
she considered serious violations of federal safety standards.
   When no corrective action was taken, she deliberately failed to
clean up radiation contamination at her work station in an effort to
prove that such contamination was not being detected by safety
inspectors.
   Although Ms. English's efforts led to corrective action, she was
disciplined and eventually fired.
   Ms. English sued GE in 1987. Her suit sought, under North
Carolina law, reinstatement with back pay and monetary damages for
wrongful discharge and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
   Despite being based on state law, Ms. English's suit was filed in
federal court because GE's headquarters are outside the state.
   A federal judge threw out the state-law suit, ruling that it was
pre-empted by ``whistleblower provisions'' of the federal Energy
Reorganization Act.
   The law bars nuclear industry employers from firing or otherwise
disciplining employees for publicly pointing out alleged safety
problems.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal of Ms.
English's suit last year. Today's decision reversed that ruling.
   The case is English vs. GE, 89-152.

   President Bush's decision to give Mikhail S.
Gorbachev the trade agreement he wanted will allow the Soviet leader
to continue his economic embargo of Lithuania, the Baltic republic's
president said today.
   The trade agreement was announced during the superpower summit in
Washington. It ended Sunday with a joint news conference, and Bush
said his decision to grant Moscow trade benefits had nothing to do
with Gorbachev easing pressure on the breakaway republic.
   ``By this agreement, he's allowed to prolong the blockade against
Lithuania,'' Vytautas Landsbergis told the Voice of America, the
U.S. government radio station.
   Moscow has slapped an embargo on the republic, halting food and
fuel supplies, in retaliation for Lithuania's March 11 declaration
of independence.
   Bush had said earlier he would not ask Congress to approve new
trade agreements with the Soviet Union until Moscow dropped
restrictions on emigration and ended its blockade of Lithuania.
   But he changed his mind after meeting with Gorbachev. Bush said
he would send the trade measure to the U.S. Congress if the Supreme
Soviet passed a liberalized emigration law. He did not mention
Lithuania.
   ``The linkage is between the emigration _ and that's it,'' Bush
said at the news conference.
   The trade agreement would be a first step toward slashing tariffs
on Soviet goods sold in the United States. It would also expand
opportunities for U.S. companies in the Soviet Union by reducing red
tape and providing greater protection against copyright piracy.
   The proposal is expected to get a cool reception on Washington's
Capitol Hill. Many members of Congress have said they would not
allow the Soviet Union to become a most-favored-nation trading
partner until Gorbachev ended his economic squeeze on Lithuania.
   The most-favored-nation designation qualifies a trading partner
for the lowest U.S. tariffs.
   The U.S. Senate passed a non-binding resolution last month
seeking to halt any U.S.-Soviet trade agreements while the crackdown
on Lithuania continues.
   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,
told NBC-TV that Bush faced ``growing unhappiness'' from
conservative Republicans. He said they see Bush's actions as too
conciliatory toward the Soviets.
   ``The pot has been stirred up even more'' by pushing trade
without obtaining concessions on Lithuania and not linking the
issues, Aspin said.
   Kazimiera Prunskiene, Lithuania's prime minister, told VOA that
Gorbachev must know ``it is a big question yet'' whether Congress
will approve the trade pact.
   ``Moscow cannot be sure of ratification while the Lithuanian
question is unresolved,'' said Mrs. Prunskiene, who has met
separately with Bush and Gorbachev in past weeks.
   She said Bush may have taken a tougher line against the blockade
in private talks with Gorbachev and that the U.S. president might
not have wanted to make that approach public.

   Tornadoes and thunderstorms throughout the Midwest killed 14
people, injured scores and left hundreds more homeless. Ten of the
dead were in Indiana, where about 50 twisters touched down.
   The most disastrous tornado tore a five-mile swath through the
southwestern Indiana town of Petersburg on Saturday. It killed six
people, injured at least 57 and destroyed more than 150 homes.
   ``It looked to me like there had been a bombing run made right
through the middle of Petersburg,'' said Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh, who
viewed the town from the air Sunday. ``I'm confident we'll rebuild,
but it will be tough.''
   Residents of the mining and farming community of 3,000 already
had been without fresh water for two weeks because of flooding that
tore through levees along the White River and severed the water main.
   Bayh, who had requested federal disaster assistance after the
floods, signed an amended request Sunday and sent it to President
Bush. Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste also asked for disaster assistance
after dozens of families in two Ohio counties were left homeless by
the storm there.
   Tornadoes also were reported in Illinois, Minnesota, Kentucky and
Michigan on Saturday.
   More deadly weather struck the Midwest on Sunday. Wind-toppled
trees killed a 21-year-old woman camper in a state park in
south-central Wisconsin and two boys, ages 6 and 8, in a town park
in the central Indiana town of Mulberry.
   In Illinois, the storm Saturday destroyed about 50 homes and
damaged more than 100, most of them in Jasper and Shelby counties.
Authorities reported one woman died.
   In Albion, Ill., a new $4 million electronics warehouse was
leveled, Edwards County Coroner Mark Curtis said.
   ``It's just total devastation,'' Curtis said. ``It's
unbelievable. Everything they tell you about tornadoes _ the roar
like a train, the wind _ is true.''
   Also Saturday, a 10-year-old boy drowned in a storm-swollen river
in Milwaukee and an 82-year-old man was killed by a wind-blown tree
branch in the northwestern Missouri town of Stewartsville.
   A tornado in Harrison, Ohio, outside Cincinnati, destroyed 20
houses and 10 businesses and damaged another 100 houses and 50
businesses, police Sgt. Carl Butler said. No serious injuries were
reported.
   Winds up to 70 mph in Kansas knocked down power lines, leaving
nearly 50,000 homes without electricity and sparking grass fires. In
Arkansas, thunderstorms dumped heavy rain, causing flash flooding
that closed roads.
   Across Indiana, officials reported eight dead and at least 150
people injured Saturday in storms that left 24 cities in 15 counties
with significant damage. Officials tracked about 50 tornado
touchdowns during a four-hour period.
   The outbreak was the worst in Indiana since a tornado barrage in
1974 killed 47 people. A series of twisters on Palm Sunday in 1965
killed 137 people in 18 Indiana counties.
   The other Indiana tornado deaths were in Bedford, in the southern
part of the state, and in Putnam County in west-central Indiana,
said Jerome Hauer, director of the State Emergency Management Agency.
   Hauer said the tornadoes were particularly devastating because
they spent long periods of time on the ground. One twister, he said,
was on the ground 38 minutes.
   More severe thunderstorms and at least one tornado raked central
Indiana on Sunday, downing trees and power lines.
   Clouds of black dust blown from freshly plowed fields created
blackouts on highways in the northern part of the state, causing an
18-car pileup on U.S. Highway 31 outside South Bend. Five people
sustained minor injuries, police said.
   At least 150 homes and 18 businesses in Petersburg were destroyed
and 120 homes and 58 businesses were damaged when Saturday's tornado
ripped through town, said Al Miller, field operations coordinator
for the State Emergency Management Agency. At least 57 people were
injured.
   There was no electricity in the town, and residents were urged to
stay away from their damaged homes after dark. State police and the
National Guard staffed roadblocks at the edge of town and used
generators to shine floodlights on Main Street.
   ``We want to keep out the sightseers and looters and people who
don't need to be here,'' said police Sgt. Norm Weber.
   Petersburg resident Mary Hall, 63, picked through the rubble of
her collapsed home early Sunday. She and her husband, Clifton, had
taken cover in the basement porch when the storm hit.
   ``The insurance man told us to save what we could, but there's
really nothing left,'' she said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said
today after a meeting with Greek Premier Constantine Mitsotakis that
U.S.-Greek relations have undergone a marked improvement since the
new government took office in Athens two months ago.
   ``What we see is a prime minister and a government who is moving
expeditiously, moving aggressively to cement and improve what have
historically been good relations between the United States and
Greece,'' Baker said.
   Baker spoke briefly with reporters at the Greek Embassy after an
hour-long meeting with Mitsotakis, the first Greek head of
government to be invited to the White House since 1964. A meeting
with President Bush is scheduled for Wednesday.
   Baker gave Mitsotakis a rundown on the discussions Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had over the weekend on the
situation in Cyprus, where Turkish troops have been deployed since
1974.
   Calling the relationship with Greece ``very much improved,''
Baker cited the recent initialing of a U.S.-Greek base agreement and
Greece's decision to establish relations with Israel.
   U.S. and Greek negotiators initialed the accord after just two
rounds of talks. It will allow the U.S. military presence in Greece
to continue, but two of the four U.S. bases in Greece _ Hellenikon
Air Force Base near Athens, and a naval communications station _
will be closed.
   The agreement fulfilled a pledge by Mitsotakis to reach a base
agreement with the United States. He leads the conservative New
Democracy Party, which has 150 seats in the 300-member Parliament.
One deputy who represents a small conservative grouping is backing
Mitsotakis' party.
   The terms of the agreement will be made public once mutually
acceptable translations are completed. Formal signing is expected in
July.
   During the Socialist government of Premier Andreas Papandreau,
the two sides were unable to conclude a base agreement despite 17
rounds of negotiations. U.S.-Greek relations were stormy during much
of Papandreau's eight-year tenure.
   As a NATO ally, Greece is slated to receive $345 million in
military aid during the next fiscal year. Both sides have refused
comment on the financial aid aspects of the new agreement.
   The visit is listed as private but Mitsotakis has a number of
meetings with U.S. government representatives. He will meet with
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, among other administration officials,
and several members of Congress.
   Mitsotakis, who was imprisoned by Nazi forces during World War II
and by the Greek military dictatorship in the late 1960s, will
attend the graduation of his son from Harvard on Thursday.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today defended the
right of Soviet Jews to live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying
Israel as a democracy could not keep new immigrants from the
occupied territories.
   Shamir's statement came after Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev threatened to limit the emigration of Soviet Jews to
Israel if they continued to settle on land seized from the Arabs in
the 1967 Middle East war.
   Speaking in Washington after the summit with President Bush,
Gorbachev said some Soviets have urged the government to ``postpone
issuing permits for exit,'' unless Israel stops Soviet Jews from
moving to the territories.
   Israeli officials said, however, that international and internal
pressures probably would keep Gorbachev from carrying out the threat.
   The occupied lands _ where Palestinians have been in revolt
against Israeli rule for 29 months _ are home to 1.7 million
Palestinians and 70,000 Jewish settlers. Arab nations don't want
large-scale settlement of Soviet Jews there.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union is at an all-time high.
About 35,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in Israel so far this year and
the figure is expected to reach as high as 150,000. About 1 million
Soviets are seeking permission to emigrate.
   Shamir told Israeli manufacturers in Tel Aviv that his
government's policy was to allow Jews to live anywhere in ``the land
of Israel,'' including the occupied Gaza Strip and West Bank.
   ``If the U.S.S.R. of President Gorbachev does not think she can
today tell her citizens where to live ... it is as clear as the sun
that we, as followers of freedom and democracy, cannot limit this
category or another of settlers.''
   Benjamin Begin, a leading member of Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc, told Israel radio that Israelis must fight for the right of
Jews to live in the occupied territories.
   Unless they do, he said, Jews would have to defend their right to
live in Jerusalem's Jewish suburbs, land annexed by Israel. Most
Western countries have not recognized that annexation.
   ``We must persuade the international community not to place in
doubt the right of any Jew to settle anywhere in his homeland,''
Begin said.
   Although Israeli officials have defended the right of Soviet Jews
to settle in the territories, they have also said few have chosen to
do so. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said only about 200 of the Jews
who have arrived this year moved to the West Bank and Gaza.
   Simha Dinitz, head of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency, which
handles immigration, said that since April 1989, 285 Soviet Jews
have moved to the territories.
   But the Hebrew daily Haaretz today quoted a Jewish Agency
document as saying that in the 12 months ending March 31, 1,300 new
immigrants, most of them Soviets, had moved to the Jerusalem suburbs.
   After Gorbachev's comments on Sunday, Israeli Absorption Minister
Yitzhak Peretz invited the Soviet leader to visit and see for
himself that no sizable numbers of Soviet refugees are settling in
the occupied territories.
   Gorbachev rejected the invitation.
   ``I will be frank, the time has not yet come to go there,'' he
said in Minneapolis late Sunday.
   Israeli officials said Gorbachev's warning that he might limit
Jewish emigration may undermine his image and credibility in the
West.
   ``The policy of free emigration, including Jewish emigration,
conforms with the Soviet Union's policy to end the Cold War,'' said
Dan Naveh, adviser to Foreign Minister Moshe Arens.
   ``It's therefore hard to imagine that Gorbachev meant to
reconsider the policy of free immigration and by that harm the trust
and appreciation that he has earned in this field in the free
world,'' Naveh said.
   Deputy Prime Minister David Levy said the Soviet Union ``is
changing direction and it cannot be that only regarding Jews it
would take a step that leads it backward and not forward, to
progress and freedom.''
   In the United States, the National Conference on Soviet Jewry,
which lobbies for Soviet immigration, strongly rejected Gorbachev's
warning as a violation of ``fundamental human rights.''
   A Soviet move curbing emigration could put Gorbachev on a
collision course with the United States and jeopardize a trade pact
signed at the U.S.-Soviet summit. Bush said the trade agreement
would not go to Congress for its required approval without
liberalized Soviet emigration laws.

   No one seems to have time to read anymore,
illiteracy is growing and censorship has become a burden, but other
than that the book business has never been better.
   That was the report from a meeting of the American Booksellers
Association, where publishers, authors and store owners are trying
to guide their difficult industry into the 1990s.
   Delegates to the 90th annual trade show insist that any accounts
of a publishing slump are premature, if not altogether wrong.
   ``The book trade in general _ from the booksellers' point of view
_ is very healthy,'' said Ed Morrow, president of the group and a
store owner in Manchester Center, Vt. ``People are responding to
serious works, looking for the soul enrichment that they're not
getting in other mediums.''
   Morrow's optimism was reflected on the crowded convention floor.
   Pre-registration for the convention, which runs through Tuesday,
was a record 24,000. That was a 47 percent increase for booksellers
and a jump of 12 percent for exhibitors over last year.
   The convention floor was a mix of the literary and the loud. In
one booth, an actor dressed as Spiderman complained about the burden
of being a superhero. Just a few aisles away, the University of
California Press touted its book, ``My Tibet,'' one of two major
titles at the show written by the Dalai Lama.
   Fans lined up 100-deep to receive autographed copies of ``Get
Shorty'' from mystery writer Elmore Leonard, and Grateful Dead
drummer Mickey Hart was busily promoting his new book ``Drumming at
the Edge of Magic: A Journey Into the Spirit of Percussion''
   For the first time, there is a special section for children's
books and a separate section called ``In Other Words: Books in
Different Languages.''
   The booksellers also organized a foundation to fight censorship,
announcing the launch just a few days after a delay in the decision
to publish the paperback version of Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   Rushdie has been in hiding since February 1989, after the late
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called his book
blasphemous and said he should be killed.

<HEAD>Lawyers May Advertise Their Specialties, Court Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
lawyers to advertise themselves as specialists in some areas of the
law.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said Illinois officials improperly
censured an attorney who said on his professional letterhead he is a
civil trial specialist certified by the National Board of Trial
Advocacy (NBTA), a private organization.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, in the court's main opinion, said
states may not ban potentially misleading information if the
information also may be presented in a way that is not deceptive.
   He was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A. Blackmun
and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall provided the fifth vote to overturn the
censure of Gary E. Peel of Edwardsville, Ill.
   But Marshall said states could take steps _ short of an outright
ban _ to assure that lawyer advertising is not misleading.
   Marshall said Peel could be required, for example, to say on his
letterhead that the NBTA is a private group.
   Dissenting were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Sandra Day O'Connor, Byron R. White and Antonin Scalia.
   The Illinois Supreme Court, which disciplines that state's
lawyers, had upheld a state rule against advertising oneself as a
certified civil trial specialist.
   The state court censured Peel, who since 1983 included the
specialist reference on his letterhead.
   The state court said Peel's use of the reference is misleading
because it makes it appear he is more qualified than other lawyers
who do the same type of work.
   Stevens said today, ``The facts stated on (Peel's) letterhead are
true and verifiable. We are satisfied that the consuming public
understands ... that a host of certificates ... are issued by
private organizations. It seems unlikely that (Peel's) statement
about his certification as a specialist by an identified national
organization necessarily would be confused with formal state
recognition.''
   In Illinois, only lawyers who specialize in patent, trademark and
admiralty law have been allowed to advertise their specialities.
   The Illinois Supreme Court said the reason for allowing those
exceptions was to help the public find attorneys who practice those
unusual specialities.
   The NBTA, based in Boston, said it uses ``rigorous standards'' to
determine whether any civil or criminal trial advocate is entitled
to its certification.
   It said it has certified more than 1,000 lawyers nationwide.
   The Supreme Court in 1977 struck down a ban on all lawyer
advertising, ruling that it violated free-speech rights. Since then,
the court has upheld some regulation of lawyer ads but struck down
other rules.
   The case is Peel vs. Attorney Registration and Disciplinary
Commission of Illinois, 88-1775.

<HEAD>Vermont Supreme Court Upholds Moratorium on Jury Trials For Civil
Cases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER GRAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice delayed is not always justice
denied, the Vermont Supreme Court said today as it upheld a
six-month moratorium on civil jury trials in the state.
   The moratorium was imposed by the court in January as a way to
cope with budget cuts prompted by the state's sagging economy. In
today's decision, the state's highest court said constitutional
guarantees to speedy trials do not mean instant ones.
   In its ruling, the court noted that the moratorium is temporary
and it provides for exceptions ``where justice requires.''
   The Supreme Court imposed the ban after it was ordered to cut
about $300,000 from its current year budget to help avert a state
deficit.
   The ban affected only civil cases _ such things as divorces,
property disputes, personal injury claims, malpractice suits and
breaches of contract. It did not affect criminal matters and will
expire July 1.
   The 220-member Vermont Trial Lawyers Association filed a
class-action lawsuit on behalf of 18 Vermonters seeking to overturn
the ban. The association's suit claimed that both the federal and
state constitutions guarantee Vermonters the right to a speedy trial.
   ``It violates the constitutional rights of everyone who has asked
for a civil jury trial in the state of Vermont,'' association
president Jerome O'Neill said. ``You can't simply decide that you're
not going to provide civil jury trials.''
   But the Supreme Court decision, written by retired Chief Justice
Albert Barney, said that ``caseloads cannot be managed on the
simplistic position that everyone is entitled to an immediate trial
whenever they are ready for one.''
   The Vermont Supreme Court decision is counter to a federal court
ruling in California that held that civil jury trials in U.S.
District Court could not be suspended because of fiscal restraints.
   But the Vermont justices said the federal ruling centered around
the length of the moratorium, not the moratorium itself, and that
Vermont moratorium delayed civil jury trials for ``a relatively
short period of time.''
   The moratorium on civil jury trials should save about $75,000,
said Lee Suskin, director of trial court administration.

   The Supreme Court today rejected a request by
an unusual coalition of religious groups that it reconsider its
decision letting states outlaw the use of illegal drugs as a
religious practice.
   The court, as expected, turned down the ``petition for
rehearing'' without comment. Such requests are almost never granted.
   Groups including the American Jewish Congress, the National
Association of Evangelicals, the National Council of Churches, the
Presbyterian Church USA, Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, American
Friends Service Committee, Americans United for Separation of Church
and State and the Christian Legal Society had joined in filing the
request.

the Native American Church have no constitutional right to take the
hallucinogenic drug peyote during religious ceremonies.
   Religious leaders said they were more disturbed by the court's
method of deciding the case than by the decision's bottom line.
   Five members of 6-3 court majority agreed that religious beliefs
cannot excuse failure to comply with ``otherwise valid laws
prohibiting conduct states are free to regulate.''
   The April decision did not require states to have a ``compelling
reason'' before forcing someone to comply with laws interfering with
religious beliefs.
   The case is Employment Division vs. Smith, 88-1213.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Masked gunmen killed a Roman
Catholic man in his home and wounded two of his sons early today,
police said, arousing fears of a new outbreak of sectarian violence.
   The attack came after the mainly Roman Catholic IRA, fighting to
end British rule of Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland, said it
was responsible for killing two British soldiers since Friday.
   In London, police investigating Irish Republican Army attacks
detained several people under the Prevention of Terrorism Act,
Scotland Yard reported. They can be held for a week without charge.
   Gunmen today killed 60-year-old Patrick Boyle when they burst
into his home near Portadown in County Armagh, 25 miles southwest of
Belfast, police said.
   One of the sons was severely wounded in the stomach and was in a
serious condition, police said. The two or three attackers escaped
in a stolen van that was found abandoned about a mile from the
family home.
   Police said none of the Boyle family was a member of the security
forces, and they knew of no motive for the attack.
   The Social Democratic and Liberal Party, the main Catholic party
in Northern Ireland, blamed the attack on Protestant extremists.
   ``There is absolutely no reason why this family should have been
singled out,'' said Seamus Mallon, deputy party leader and the local
member of Parliament. ``It was a savage and sectarian attack on a
totally innocent family.''
   More than 2,700 people have been killed since sectarian violence
erupted in Northern Ireland in 1969.
   The IRA has said members shot and killed an off-duty British army
recruit at a train station in Lichfield, central England, on Friday
afternoon. The group also said its gunmen on Saturday killed a
British soldier near a British base in Dortmund, West Germany.
   In a stepped-up campaign in England, IRA bombers attacked two
British army offices in London last month, killing a recruiting
officer at one.
   Media reports in Britain said up to six suspects were rounded up
over the past few days, some in raids in London and two on Friday as
they were about to board a ferry to the Republic of Ireland.
   The IRA is fighting to unite Northern Ireland, a British
province, with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland under a
leftist administration.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Racial-Bias Challenge to Virginia School Board
Practice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected a racial-bias
challenge to Virginia's practice of appointing, not electing, county
and city school board members.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that upheld the
appointive system even though unlawfully discriminatory motives at
times played a role in retaining it.
   Seven black Virginia residents and two groups, Citizens for a
Better America and the Virginia unit of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, sued state authorities over the appointive
system.
   The lawsuit alleged that the system unlawfully blunts the
political clout of blacks in the state.
   How the members of Virginia's local school boards are appointed
varies but the state-mandated appointive system dates back to 1870.
   U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams in Richmond found no
racially biased motive in the initial adoption of the system. But he
said racial discrimination figured prominently in the state's
decision at a 1901-02 constitutional convention to retain the system.
   The state General Assembly in 1947 passed a law permitting the
election of school board members in some counties, and voters in
Arlington County did so.
   But when the Arlington County school board voted in 1956 to
racially desegregate its school system, the General Assembly
repealed the 1947 law.
   Judge Williams found that the legislature's action was ``an
effort to impede Arlington's ability to comply with court-ordered
desegregation.''
   But the judge, upheld last Nov. 24 by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals, ruled that the appointive system's challengers had
failed to prove that racially biased motives survive today.
   The appeals court ruled that state officials ``have proved that
racial discrimination no longer motivates Virginia's decision to
retain an appointive system for selecting school board members.''
   The appeals court said that while statistics indicate some
adverse impact on black representation, the challengers had failed
to prove some discriminatory intent as well.
   ``The defendants have proved that the state does not currently
maintain the system ... for discriminatory reasons,'' the 4th
Circuit court said.
   The number of blacks serving on school boards across the state
matches their percentage of the state's population _ about 18
percent.
   But in the appeal acted on today, the justices were told that
blacks are underrepresented by at least one school board seat in 26
counties and four cities.
   Blacks are underrepresented on school boards in 20 of the state's
40 school districts where they comprise more than 30 percent of the
population, the court was told.
   There are no black members on 50 of the 136 local school boards.
   ``There is continuing overt racial discrimination in the
appointment of school boards,'' the appeal contended.
   The seven individuals who sued are Darius Irby and John S. Neal
of Nottoway County, Charles W. White of Buckingham County, the Rev.
James S. Wiliams Jr. of Prince Edward County, Cora Tucker of Halifax
County, Willie Powell and Milton Richardson in Petersburg.
   The case is Irby vs. Virginia State Board of Elections, 89-1612.

   More than one million mourners gathered today
around the gold-domed tomb of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini to mark
the first anniversary of his death, some beating their chests in a
frenzy of grief.
   ``Death To America,'' blared loudspeakers around the compound.
``Death To Israel.''
   Inside the packed shrine, mourners listened as speakers recited
verses from the Koran, the Islamic holy book. The gray-bearded
Khomeini seemed to stare sternly at the crowd from pictures hung on
the pillars.
   ``While There Is Islam, We Will Not Forget The Imam'' read one
banner. Khomeini was considered the imam or supreme spiritual leader.
   Some, including a group of Pakistanis, beat their chests in a
traditional Shiite Moslem sign of mourning as others sat under
makeshift tents.
   One group of old men in white shrouds with red-and-green
headbands, many of them toothless, also beat their breasts and
chanted Islamic slogans.
   Helicopters carried officials to the shrine.
   The event, which climaxed a four-day mourning period, gathered no
more than 3 million people around the shrine on the outskirts of
Tehran, according to foreign reporters who flew over the scene by
helicopter.
   Iran's official news media, however, said the occasion drew 8
million to 9 million people.
   A few of those arriving had official invitation cards, some
wounded veterans of the Iran-Iraq war in wheelchairs pushed by
Revolutionary Guards wearing black armbands.
   Maryam, a woman in her early 30s, lamented that ``I really loved
the imam, he was the true and only leader of this revolution.''
   Khomeini died at 10:45 p.m. on June 3 last year.
   When his death was officially announced the next day, millions
poured into the streets, pounding themselves, scratching their faces
and beating their breasts in grief.
   In a replay of those frenetic scenes, mourners thronged to his
tomb in the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery on the outskirts of Tehran on
the anniversary.
   Hundreds of people, most of them conscripts or other civil
servants who had been ordered to attend today's ceremonies, walked
for days to arrive at the tomb. A young soldier who displayed the
blisters on his feet from three days of walking said only that ``I
came last year, and I had to come again this year.''
   Two hundred thousand mourners were brought to Tehran from
villages, towns and other cities in thousands of buses, the
commander of the highway police told Iranian news media.
   Hundreds of Shiite Moslems from other countries such as Pakistan,
Bangladesh, India, Syria and Lebanon were invited to attend.
   Elsewhere, hundreds gathered inside the mosque adjoining
Khomeini's old house in the northern Tehran suburb of Jamaran on
Sunday, sobbing and beating themselves as they looked at the small,
empty balcony from which Khomeini used to address the nation.
   Only a year after Khomeini's death, many of his followers who
actively participated in the 1979 revolution that ousted Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi have become disillusioned. But many Iranians
contend that although the revolution has soured, Khomeini was
sincere in what he wanted to achieve for his people.
   There are many who are disgruntled with the country's economic
conditions, widespread official corruption and the unfulfilled
promises of the revolution.
   Most of the economic woes are due to the eight-year war with Iraq
and Khomeini's implacable anti-Western stance, which Iran's present
leaders are having a difficult time circumventing in order to get
foreign investment and Western technology.
   Khomeini's staunch followers, like his only surviving son, Ahmad,
an important figure in the so-called radical camp within the
leadership, want no deviation from his teaching.

<HEAD>Court Leaves Alabama Business Tax Intact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left intact an Alabama
tax attacked as ``grossly discriminatory'' against out-of-state
businesses.
   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that the tax
interferes unduly with interstate commerce and violates equal
protection rights.
   The Alabama Supreme Court, while acknowledging that the tax is
more onerous for out-of-state businesses, concluded that it is valid.
   ``There is no unconstitutional unequal treatment of foreign
corporations and no unconstitutional discrimination against them,''
the state court ruled last Dec. 21.
   The tax was challenged by General Motors and its subsidiaries and
by Reynolds Metals Co., which is based in Richmond, Va., and is a
producer of aluminum.
   Alabama imposes a franchise tax on all business conducted in the
state. Companies based outside the state pay a tax of $3 for every
$1,000 worth of capital in the state. In-state companies pay $10 for
every $1,000 worth of all outstanding stock.
   Lawyers for GM and Reynolds Metals told the justices that the two
methods of calculating the tax result in enormously higher taxes for
out-of-state businesses.
   ``The reason ... is that while the amount of business activity
conducted and total capital employed in Alabama means everything in
determining the foreign corporation's tax liability,'' GM's appeal
said, ``business activity and total capital employed mean nothing in
determining the domestic corporation's liability.''
   For 1982 and 1983, Alabama collected $94 million in franchise
taxes from out-of-state businesses based on 28,792 tax returns and
less than $10 million from in-state businesses based on 81,698
returns.
   Adjustments to the tax law took effect in 1984 but that year
out-of-state businesses paid $49.6 million in franchise taxes and
in-state businesses paid $14.7 million.
   Reynolds Metals paid about $1.2 million in franchise taxes for
1982 and 1983, the years for which it sued for refunds.
   GM sued over the years 1983 through 1988, in which it paid $6.3
million in Alabama franchise taxes.
   The two appeals acted on today were supported by the State Tax
Council of the State Chambers of Commerce and an organization called
the Tax Executives Institute.
   ``The broad implication of the (state) court's holding is that
... discrimination against out-of-state taxpayers will be
tolerated,'' lawyers for the Chamber of Commerce's council said.
``If interstate business is to be protected from discriminatory
state taxes, the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court must be
reviewed.''
   The cases are GM vs. Alabama Department of Revenue, 89-1574, and
Reynolds Metals vs. Sizemore, 89-1587.

   Here are excerpts from the speech of Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to a group of U.S. business
executives on Sunday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   A few hours ago President Bush and I together at our press
conference summed up the results of the Washington summit. I
personally believe that this summit will go down in history as a
summit of hope and optimism. ...
   It took us some time, a long time and a long road, to reach this
stage in our relationship. I don't know. Sometimes when we express
big hopes we have to knock on wood. Anyway, let me say that we do
have high hopes. We hope that there will be very important political
and political-military consequences of this summit and also very
positive consequences in all other spheres of relations between our
countries. ...
   The important question is what kind of Soviet Union do the
president and the U.S. people want to see? Does America want to see
a Soviet Union that lacks confidence, that is not stable, that is in
turmoil? Or does America want to see the Soviet Union as a noble
democratic state which is moving toward new forms of life within the
overall framework of humanism and democracy _ a Soviet Union that is
working with the entire global civilization, integrated in that
civilization?
   So this is the alternative, and basically the same alternative
confronts us. That is to say, what kind of U.S. do we want to see? I
have thought about that for a long time. ...
   A world that is not comfortable for the U.S. is not comfortable
for us. ...
   The president and I spent several hours together, the two of us,
during this visit. Our final discussions were in Camp David without
neckties, our sleeves rolled up, and we discussed things in a very
intensive way and I feel that as a result we have a new degree of
confidence and mutual understanding. ...
   Now my second point is about the process of change in our
economy, about perestroika in our economy. I would like to be brief.
Many of you, I think, must have visited Moscow or, I don't know,
maybe quite a few have not.
   I listened and talked to members of the Economic Council in
Moscow and I tried to tell them what we intend to do with our
economy, and how we plan to do it. The last five years is a period
that has not been simple for us.
   We had to sort things out to understand what kind of a society we
have. What are the good things that we are able to do and what are
the misjudgments that we have to abandon. We were trying to do that
in a very thorough way, and also in a very tough way toward
ourselves. In a self-critical way toward ourselves.
   And, in addition to studying ourselves, we were trying also to
test certain new elements and new forms of economic management. ...
We tried quite a few things in order to gain experience and tried to
place our management people and production units into a new
situation, new conditions, new circumstances and we have seen that
the whole process moved ahead with great difficulty.
   Why? Because of that command system that we have. The command
system in politics and in the economy. Our economic managers, many
of them very good people who know how to work, were used to a system
of commands, to a system of taking orders from above, and that
really happened (for) many, many years, many decades.
   And a certain type of individual, a certain type of economic
manager evolved, and it is very difficult to abandon those old ways,
particularly for people who are not that young. ...
   But in the same way the command system worked as regards those
who actually worked the machines, who actually drive the tractors,
who work in the research labs, all of them too basically are that
type of individual. They of course wanted freedom and economic
autonomy but once they got that, they were afraid.
   They didn't know how to use that much freedom. So this gives you
an idea of the scope of the problems. And this is how we began. ...
   Changing a system means changing people, intelligent people. It's
not just a system, some kind of layout that you see on a piece of
paper and you can just tear up that piece of paper. A system is
people, people who live, people who have their own interests, who
have their own lives and we have this conflict of interest and
really had a problem trying to move these new economic forms ahead.
And we were only able to approach that when we began a political
reform that involved the masses of the people in the political
process. ...
   If the economic reform is successful, then people will not need
rallies, demonstrations, and so on, although, of course, quite a few
rallies and demonstrations I think are going to happen before we are
successful in economic reform. ...
   We have made mistakes, this is true. There has been some damage
done to our economy. We have had some problems in management because
the old system of running the economy has become weaker and the new
economic leaders, the new economic forms of a market economy, have
not yet evolved properly.
   The entire structure of a market economy is only beginning to
evolve. So therefore we need to adopt a number of other laws and
documents that will make it possible for our economy to really work
among market principles. So I think that we are now at this
watershed when we are ready to move resolutely toward the market.
This is what we are doing now, this is I think what will be decisive
for the entire perestroika, the future of perestroika. ...
   We are having now a very crucial situation in which we would like
to hope for your cooperation and for your understanding. ...
   Those who are with us at this time have a good prospect of
cooperation in our great country, in our great market because of its
tremendous potential. But those who just stand on the sidelines, who
do not want to risk, who want to wait and see, who don't want to
risk their dollars _ well, they will remain I think observers for
years to come.
   We'll make sure that that is so. ...

   Student prayer groups must be allowed to meet
at public schools that permit other organized extracurricular
activities, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The justices, voting 8-1, said a 1984 federal law aimed at
permitting religious clubs in public schools does not violate
constitutionally required separation of church and state.
   The court overruled Omaha, Neb., school officials who refused to
approve a high school Bible-reading club.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said the
Equal Access Act of 1984 passes the court's long-standing three-part
test aimed at assuring separation of church and state.
   The law grants equal access to both secular and religious speech,
does not have the primary effect of advancing religion and does not
cause excessive entanglement between government and religion, she
said.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Ruled that police undercover agents may seek to elicit
confessions froms jailed criminal suspects without first having to
give so-called Miranda warnings.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices said jailed criminal suspects need
not be told about their right to remain silent or to get a lawyer's
help before4 being questioned by someone secretly working for the
police.
   _ Used a dispute over Haitian refugee rights to strengthen a
federal law requiring the government to pay legal fees to winning
opponents in lawsuits.
   The court unanimously rejected Bush administration arguments
aimed at limiting the attorneys' fees.
   _ Ruled that nuclear industry ``whistleblowers'' who say they
were disciplined for complaining about lax safety may sue their
employers under state personal injury laws.
   The court unanimously said such lawsuits are not pre-empted by a
federal law protecting such whistleblowers.
   _ Agreed to hear a Bush administration appeal aimed at giving
federal officials more power to deny temporary legal status to
immigrant farmworkers.
   The court, without comment, said it will review a ruling that
said the workers are entitled to various procedural protections when
applying for such residential permits.
   _ Agreed to study the government's power to lift price controls
on some natural gas, a case that has tens of millions of dollars at
stake for consumers.
   The justices said they will review federal regulations that,
among other things, allow gas producers to raise some prices charged
to pipeline companies.
   _ Agreed to decide whether passengers on international flights
may sue airlines for the emotional distress they allegedly suffer in
near-crashes that cause them no physical harm.
   The court said it will review a ruling that Eastern Airlines may
be forced to pay passeng4ers who were on a flight that landed safely
in Miami after all the plane's engines failed briefly in the air.
   In the school-prayer case, O'Connor said there is little risk
that students will view an extracurricular Bible-reading club as
indicating school officials endorse religion.
   ``The possibility of student peer pressure remains,'' she said.
``But there is little if any risk of official state endorsement or
coercion where no formal classroom activities are involved and no
school officials actively participate.''
   Congress in the Equal Access Act said public high schools
accepting federal aid must not discriminate against groups based on
``the religious, political, philosphical or other content of the
speech at such meetings.''
   The law requires access to school facilities for religious clubs
if other ``non-curriculum-related student groups'' are allowed to
meet.
   At Westside High School in Omaha, officials authorized some 30
such activities, including chess, scuba diving and photography clubs.
   The officials said the clubs are related to classroom work or
other aspects of the school curriculum. For example, they said chess
helps students learn mathematics and logic and scuba diving is tied
to the school's physical fitness program.
   The officials said the 1984 act, therefore, should not apply to
them. But they also argued that if the law does apply, it should be
declared unconstitutional as a government-sponsored establishment of
religion.
   Some groups who supported the school officials, such as the
National School Boards Assocation, said the 1984 law is a thinly
disguised move to return prayer to the public schools. The Supreme
Court in 1962 banned organized, school-sponsored prayer sessions for
students.
   The Bush administration defended the 1984 law as a legitimate
attempt to protect religious liberty for students.
   Students at Westside High sought recognition in 1985 of a
Christian Bible study club to meet after school hours on school
grounds. Officials refused to approve it, and suggested the students
meet instead at a church next door.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1989 overruled a federal
judge and said the club must be allowed to meet on school premises.
   The Supreme Court in 1981 said state-run universities cannot ban
student groups from using campus facilities for religious worship
and study. But before today, the justices had not decided whether
the same rule should apply to public high schools.
   Today, Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J. Brennan
concurred in the outcome of the Westside High School case, but
expressed some serious reservations.
   Marshall, in an opinion joined by Brennan, said schools such as
Westside must be careful to ``effectively disassociate themselves
from the religious speech that now may become commonplace in their
facilities.''
   Justice John Paul Stevens dissented. He said today's ruling could
force schools to open their doors ``to every religious, political or
social organization, no matter how controversial or distasteful its
views may be.''
   The case is Board of Education vs. Mergens, 88-1597.

   The Supreme Court today asked the Bush
administration to offer its opinions about key limitations on free
agency in the National Football League.
   The court asked Justice Department lawyers to comment on a lower
court's ruling that NFL restrictions on a player's switch to another
team do not violate federal antitrust law.
   The justices are not expected to say whether they will review
that ruling until hearing from the government lawyers, which could
take months.
   No further court action in the case is likely before October,
when the justices return from their summer recess, scheduled for
late June or early July.
   The antitrust case is an outgrowth of a 24-day strike in 1987 by
the National Football League Players Association. The walkout ended
without a new contract between the players and the league's 28 team
owners.
   But the owners continued to enforce an expired contract, signed
in 1982, containing provisions that restrict free agency.
   The provisions limit a player's ability to negotiate and sign
with a new team. The player's original team is given the right to
match a competing club's offer.
   If the original team declines to match the offer, the player's
new team must compensate the other team with draft choices.
   The provisions are called the league's first refusal-compensation
system. The NFL has a separate provision, known as Plan B, in which
teams protect 37 players and permit the rest to become free agents.
   The players association filed a federal lawsuit in 1987, accusing
the league and team owners of violating antitrust law by enforcing
the first refusal-compensation system after the expiration of the
1982 contract.
   The owners said they are exempt from antitrust law, arguing that
the old collective bargaining agreement still is valid. They said
the players union is trying to win in court what it was unable to
win at the bargaining table.
   U.S. District Judge David Doty of Minneapolis in 1988 ruled in
favor of the players, ordering a trial to determine whether the
owners were guilty of antitrust violations.
   But the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned Doty's
decision last November.
   In a 2-1 ruling, the appeals court said the league and owners
were exempt from antitrust law because of the previously negoiated
union contract.
   The players' choice now is between further negotiations or a
strike, the appeals court said. Permitting them to sue under such
circumstances would upset the ``level playing field'' created by
federal labor law, it added.
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Gerald W. Heaney said the appeals
court ruling ``permits the owners to violate the antitrust law
indefinitely.''
   The 8th Circuit court's decision was hailed by the owners as a
major victory that would spur the players to return to the
bargaining table.
   The players association responded by de-certifying itself as the
players bargaining agent, a move designed to nullify the 1982
contract and revive the antitrust suit.
   Nine current and former union officials substituted themselves
for the association in filing the appeal acted on today.
   They said the 8th Circuit court ruling amounts to ``a virtually
unlimited antitrust exemption for employers in unionized
industries.''
   Eight states supported the appeal, saying their efforts to
curtail anti-competitive behavior could be hampered by the appeals
court ruling. The states are New York, Arizona, Hawaii, Louisiana,
Michigan, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.
   The case is Powell vs. NFL, 89-1421.

<HEAD>Court Strengthens Federal Law on Legal Fees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today used a dispute over
Haitian refugee rights to strengthen a federal law requiring the
government to pay legal fees to winning opponents in lawsuits.
   The court unanimously rejected Bush administration arguments
aimed at limiting the attorneys fees.
   The justices said the government generally must reimburse winning
opponents not only for the legal fees they incur in the main
lawsuit, but also for subsequent litigation over the size of those
fees.
   The Haitian refugees sued the government in 1981 over its policy
of locking up aliens caught while trying to enter the United States
illegally.
   Until 1981, the government generally allowed the aliens to go
free on parole pending hearings on their applications for admission
to the country.
   The Haitians said they almost never were paroled before their
applications were acted upon, a process that can take longer than a
year.
   The refugees accused the government of discriminating against
them because they are black and also said the Immigration and
Naturalization Service violated federal rules by summarily adopting
harsher treatment for Haitians than other aliens.
   The refugees ultimately won an important, though not total,
victory.
   The did not win on the discrimination claim. But the government
conceded that the INS may not consider race or national origin in
determining parole and adopted new rules on refugees.
   Federal courts that reviewed the case said there is no doubt that
the Haitians won their freedom because of the lawsuit, and those
refugees later returned to custody were detained under new, fairer
rules.
   The government argued that the Haitians did not win key elements
of their lawsuit and should not be entitled to recover legal fees
under the Equal Access to Justice Act.
   The act generally requires reimbursement of legal fees for those
who prevail in suits against the government.
   A federal judge ruled against the government on the fees question
in the Haitian case and awarded more than $1 million to lawyers who
represented the refugees.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals substantially upheld the
judge's decision and ordered further hearings to recompute the
amount owed the lawyers.
   The appeals court also said the government must reimburse the
Haitians' lawyers for fees they incurred litigating the fees issue _
what the appeals court called the ``fees-for-fees'' issue.
   The Supreme Court today agreed, rejecting the government's
argument that the ``fees-for-fees'' claim should be denied because
the government's position in the fee litigation was ``substantially
justified.''
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said that since
the government lost the principle part of the case it is not
entitled to relitigate the fees issue.
   The case is Commissioner of INS vs. Jean, 89-601.

<TEXT>
   Jack Gilford, a sad-eyed comic, dramatic actor
and vaudevillian who shone in featured roles on stage, television
and movies, died at his Manhattan home this morning, a spokeswoman
said. He was 81.
   Gilford died after a long struggle with stomach cancer and had
last been at a hospital two weeks ago, according to Merle Debuskey,
a family friend and publicist. He was at his Greenwich Village home
with his actress wife, Madeline Lee, when he died about 8 a.m.,
Debuskey said.
   Gilford was twice nominated for Tony awards in Broadway musicals
_ as Hysterium, the slave who ends up in drag in ``A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' and as Herr Shultz in
``Cabaret.'' He was Hysterium again in the movie film version of
``Forum.''
   He received an Academy Award supporting-actor nomination for the
movie ``Save the Tiger,'' in which he played the partner to Jack
Lemmon's garment manufacturer. Lemmon won an Oscar for the film.
   On Broadway he was seen also in ``The Diary of Anne Frank,''
``The Tenth Man,'' ``The World of Sholom Aleichem'' and ``Romanoff &amp;
Juliet.''
   He performed as the mute king with Carol Burnett in stage and
television versions of ``Once Upon A Mattress,'' and did guest turns
on numerous TV comedy and dramatic series, including ``The
Defenders,'' ``All in the Family,'' ``Rhoda,'' ``The Love Boat,''
``Taxi,'' ``Soap,'' ``Head of the Class'' and ``Golden Girls.''
   Gilford could convulse an audience with slapstick or bring tears
with portrayals of ``little'' men overwhelmed by circumstance.
   One off-beat triumph in his 55-year career was in the non-singing
role of the drunken jailer in the Metropolitan Opera's production of
``Die Fledermaus.'' He did the part in the 1950 production and many
later ones.
   ``I also played a single act at the Palace in that same year.
There are not too many people who played the Met and the Palace in
the same year,'' he once told an interviewer.
   But work in front of cameras dried up for the versatile Gilford
during the McCarthy era, as it did for numerous show-business people
with leftward political sentiments.
   ``One day the phone just stopped ringing and I didn't do TV or
films for 10 years,'' Gilford said after the telephone resumed
ringing in the late 1960s.
   Small parts on Broadway and nightclub work saw him through.
   Among his other movie credits were ``Cocoon,'' ``Enter
Laughing,'' ``The Incident,'' ``Catch-22,'' ``They Might Be Giants''
and ``Who's Minding the Mint.''
   A commercial he appeared in for Crackerjack in the 1970s was an
award-winner at the Cannes Festival.
   In 1982 he starred in a one-hour cable television production,
``The Very Special Jack Gilford Special.''
   Born Jacob Gellman and raised in Brooklyn, Gilford began his
career in 1934 at an amateur night on a stage in the Bronx.
   He got work in vaudeville and nightclubs, toured four years with
Milton Berle and Ina Ray Hutton and began appearing in Broadway
revues in 1939.
   Gilford married Miss Lee, a producer, actress and writer, in
1949, and they had three children, Lisa, of Denver; Joseph, of New
York; and Samuel, of Montague, Mass.
   Services were to be private. In lieu of flowers, the family asked
that donations be sent to the Actors' Fund of America in Manhattan.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rebels today captured a key army
checkpoint near the international airport outside Monrovia, an
airline official said, and President Samuel Doe appealed for U.S.
help as the rebels advanced on the city.
   More than 50 U.S. Embassy workers, missionaries and their
families and hundreds of Liberians crowded another airport inside
the capital amid fears there would be a bloodbath if the rebels took
the city.
   British Airways manager David Ranger said rebels seized the army
checkpoint seven miles east of the international airport, which is
35 miles southeast of the capital.
   Ranger said his airline canceled its flights to the West African
nation for the rest of the week, but other airlines still planned to
fly.
   Four warships of the U.S. Navy's 6th Fleet, carrying 2,000
marines, were expected to arrive off the coast today or Tuesday in
case an emergency evacuation of the estimated 2,000 remaining
Americans becomes necessary.
   Doe called on ``all peace-loving nations,'' including the United
States, ``to come to the aid of the Liberian people.''
   ``It is the wishes of the people of this country that America can
do something to stop the bloodshed,'' he said in a telephone
interview from Liberia with Cable News Network.
   The U.S. State Department has accused rebel leader Charles Taylor
of receiving some support from Libya, but it also has said Marines
will not intervene in support of Doe's government.
   He has ordered his troops into their barracks because of charges
they were assaulting and killing members of tribal groups who have
supported the rebels. No defense lines were visible in the capital
or on the road to the airport.
   Doe's military commander, Lt. Gen. Henry Dubar, appeared to be
counting on the Marines to step in and save the capital.
   ``The armed forces of Liberia would not consider a Marine landing
an invasion,'' he said. ``We are very happy about them coming. It is
long overdue. The rebels are Libyan-backed so we felt the United
States should come to our aid immediately. Just the presence of the
marines here will scare the rebels away.''
   The rebels are mostly members of the Gio and Mano tribes and
invaded the country of 2.5 million people from the neighboring Ivory
Coast about five months ago.
   The State Department last week ordered all non-essential U.S.
government personnel and their families to leave immediately. About
75 Americans remained at the embassy, said spokesman David Krekke.
   At Spriggs Payne Airfield, about five miles from the city center,
about 50 Americans, 20 South Koreans and a few British and Canadians
left aboard a chartered Boeing 737 to Freetown, capital of Sierra
Leone.
   In the city, people of the Mandingo and Krahn tribes loyal to Doe
piled their belongings into taxis, trucks and buses, fleeing
reprisals by rebels threatening to attack the capital.
   ``If they come, they'll massacre us. So we're going,'' said a
father of four children as he stacked a mattress onto the back of a
truck. He and two other Mandingo families were heading for Sierra
Leone. Taxi drivers said the exodus had caused a traffic jam at the
border.
   Many of the hundreds of fleeing Liberians were families of
soldiers trying to get on two planes that have been used for the
past week to ferry people of President Doe's Krahn tribe to their
eastern Grand Gedeh County stronghold. Grand Gedeh has not been
affected by the civil war.
   Doe has been holed up in his presidential mansion in the capital.
He is protected by about 1,000 Israeli-trained troops.
   Diplomats say a high desertion rate has helped shrink the
Liberian army, which was believed to number 4,500 at the beginning
of the conflict, to roughly 3,000 to 4,000 fighters _ about as many
as the rebels.
   Rebels have killed Krahn and Mandingo civilians in retaliation
for government troop atrocities against Gio and Mano civilians.
International human rights organizations say the soldiers have
killed hundreds of civilians and the rebels scores.
   About 2,000 Gios and Manos overflowed the compound of St. Peter's
Lutheran Church in Monrovia today, where they have been put under
the protection of the International Committee of the Red Cross.
   Dozens of cars lined up for gasoline in the capital Sunday. There
were fistfights at some gas stations. Taxi drivers said there were
reports that a gas shortage would worsen because no new supplies
were expected before the end of the week.
   The government tried to end the panic in a state radio broadcast,
reassuring residents that plenty of gasoline was available.
   Doe, who seized power in 1979 in a bloody coup, announced on
Friday that he would not run in scheduled 1991 elections. The
announcement was an apparent bid to bring the rebels to the
negotiating table.
   Both Doe and rebel leader Taylor refuse to negotiate directly.
   ``It is turning into a personal conflict between Doe and Taylor
at the expense of a tribal bloodbath,'' said an expatriate who has
worked in Liberia for 20 years.
   Taylor was a close aide of Doe who headed the government agency
responsible for disbursing public funds. He fled the country after
the Liberian leader accused him of stealing $1 million from state
coffers.
   Taylor has denied the charges, but Doe says he will not negotiate
with a criminal.
   Descendants of freed U.S. slaves founded Liberia in 1822, and it
became Africa's first independent country in 1847.

<HEAD>Court Rules Against California Bar in Lawyers' Suit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers may withhold their state bar
association dues if the association uses the money to campaign for
political or social causes, a unanimous Supreme Court ruled today.
   The court said a California bar group violated the free-speech
rights of 21 lawyers who did not want their dues spent to promote
such causes as a nuclear weapons freeze and handgun control.
   ``Compulsory dues may not be expended to endorse or advance a gun
control or nuclear weapons freeze (ballot) initiative,'' Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
   Conversely, he said, the free-speech rights of lawyers are not
violated when their dues are used to help discipline members of the
bar or to propose ethical codes for the profession.
   The justices overturned a California Supreme Court ruling last
year that said the bar association was free to use the money for
practically anything but financing campaigns of candidates for
public office.
   The California court said the bar association, with power to help
license and discipline lawyers, is more like a state agency than a
labor union.
   The U.S. Supreme Court previously has limited the power of unions
to spend dues money for public-issue lobbying.
   Today, Rehnquist said the bar association is more like a union
than a typical government agency _ noting the lawyers group is
funded not by the taxpayers but by members dues.
   Also, he said, the bar association was formed primarily as an
advisory organization. Lawyers are licensed or disciplined by the
state Supreme Court with advice from the association.
   The ruling buttresses decisions by courts outside of California
that have limited the power of state bar associations to use
members' dues for ideological purposes.
   The case is Keller vs. State Bar of California, 88-1905.

   Gov. Michael S. Dukakis says the
state's fiscal woes and his defeat in the 1988 presidential election
have not quelled his optimism about the future.
   The shift toward democracy in Eastern Europe augured a promising
era for the nation's newest graduates, Dukakis said in a
commencement speech Sunday at Williams College.
   ``For someone who graduated from college in the '50s when Joe
McCarthy was terrorizing the nation and Joe Stalin was terrorizing
the world, I think the graduates of the class of 1990 are entering
an era in world history more promising, more hopeful and more likely
to reflect democratic values than at any time in this century,'' he
said.
   ``That may sound a bit puzzling, coming from someone who suffered
a very disappointing loss in the last presidential campaign, and
returned to a state that has had serious fiscal difficulties for the
past year and a half,'' he said.
   However, Dukakis sounded a warning about the health of democracy
in the United States.
   Voters in Czechoslovakia stood in line for hours to cast their
ballots and exercise their newfound democratic rights, he said. But
in the United States, voter turnouerturned a California Supreme Court ruling
last
year that said the bar association was free to use the money for
practically anything but financing campaigns of candidates for
public office.
   The California court said the bar association, with power to help

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is flying
to Copenhagen today to take up a nine-point Western plan for
resolving an impasse over the military future of Germany with Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Baker also will meet in the Danish capital with West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. The separate sessions will
be held on Tuesday amid a 35-nation conference on human rights.
   Among the ideas Baker will pursue is a possible ``political
agreement'' between NATO and the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact as one way
of reassuring Moscow, should it drop its objections to a unified
Germany joining the Western military alliance, Baker said Sunday.
   Other approaches also under discussion include a strengthening of
the 35-nation European Security Conference, which the Soviets have
demanded, and a timetable for negotiations on tactical nuclear
missiles, U.S. officials said.
   Additionally, Baker will assure the Soviets that NATO troops
would not be stationed on what is now East German territory, while
the Red Army could remain for some time, the officials told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity.
   Baker and the 15 other NATO foreign ministers, including
Genscher, will take up the difficult German problem again on
Thursday at a meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Turnberry,
Scotland.
   The human rights conference and the meeting of the Western allies
were already on the agenda before President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met for their four-day summit, which
ended Sunday in Washington.
   But the Bush-Gorbachev dispute over Germany's military future
gave Baker's trip extra significance. Baker plans to meet with
Shevardnadze again, in Berlin, later in the month.
   Gorbachev wound up his talks with Bush saying the two superpowers
would work toward a mutually acceptable solution.
   Baker said ``there are some ideas.'' One of them, he said, might
be a ``political agreement of some sort '' between the two alliances
_ the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   Baker, on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press,'' said the proposals under
study came from the United States, the Soviet Union and the NATO
allies. Among them were some previously aired: a more political,
rather than military, spin on German membership in NATO and
Genscher's proposal to keep NATO troops out of the territory that is
now East Germany.
   ``We'll keep wrestling with it,'' Baker said.
   Gorbachev, for his part, declared Sunday that ``I cannot say that
we have reached agreement, but that does not mean that our efforts
were futile. Many new arguments emerged as a result of these
discussions, and new possible perspectives.''
   ``We will continue our discussion in order to find a mutually
acceptable solution,'' Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev has repeatedly insisted that a unified Germany not be
aligned with NATO. He argues that in an era of democratic change,
his own people see the alliance as an anti-Soviet remnant of the
Cold War, and, having lost 27 million lives to Nazi Germany in World
War II, would be offended by the membership of a new, more powerful
Germany in that organization.
   Bush, at a joint news conference, said that a united Germany in
NATO ``would be stabilizing.'' He said he did not think his
differences with Gorbachev on the issue had been narrowed during the
summit.
   U.S. officials said last week that Gorbachev had proposed
creation of a new all-European council to consider military
questions arising from the impending merger of East Germany and West
Germany. Among them would be the size of the German army.
   Late Sunday, a senior U.S. official said Gorbachev was ``in full
accord'' with Bush that Germans had the right to make a decision
about NATO membership by virtue of the 1975 Helsinki agreement
signed by 35 nations.
   ``It's the first time he has done that with the president,'' said
the official, who sought out reporters while insisting he not be
quoted by name or otherwise identified.
   ``He said that he agreed that this was up to the German people to
decide,'' the official said. ``We'll have to see what that means.''

   A small, white rabbit was jailed after

police said Monday.
   A man on his morning walk Saturday spotted the bunny and alerted
local police. A patrol fetched the animal and put it in custody, a
police spokesman said.
   ``We have nowhere else to keep it, so we put it in jail. We are
just doing our duty,'' Sgt. Antero Pennanen said. Pennanen said
police officers were feeding the animal dandelion leaves.
   He said the animal is a suspected pet on the run.
   ``There have been lots of phone calls and offers to give it a
home, but we are still looking for its right owner,'' Pennanen said.
   After studying a book on pets, police concluded the rabbit was of
Russian stock.

   Scores of skinheads armed with baseball bats

arrested, the East German government news agency said Monday.
   About 100 of the young right-wing radicals gathered around houses
where they believed leftists lived, ignored a police order to leave
and attacked the officers, ADN said.
   One officer suffered a broken nose in the Saturday night clash.
Thirty of the radicals, three of them West Germans, were arrested,

   The gang of youths, their ages between 16 and 19, also threatened
passsers-by and damaged two cars, it said.
   The clash was the latest in a recent series of violent attacks in
East Germany by skinheads, youths with closely shaved heads who
espouse a hatred of foreigners, leftists and homosexuals.

<TEXT>
   Japanese wine lovers will be among the last in the
world to taste the 1990 Beaujolais Nouveau in November due to the
enthronement ceremony for Japan's Emperor Akihito.
   No chartered cargo flights into Japan will be allowed for
security reasons during a period of 10 days around the Nov. 11-12
ceremony, an official of the French Embassy said, speaking
anonymously.
   Japanese drinkers normally enjoy the privilege of being the first
to taste the Beaujolais Nouveau -- eight hours earlier than in
France.
   Consumption of the new wine is usually put on sale after midnight
on the third Thursday of November because of a marketing strategy by
the Union Interprofessionelle des Vins du Beaujolais in France.
   This year's wine will be available in Japan on Nov. 22, a week
behind the rest of the world, the official said.
   An official of Suntory Ltd., a major Japanese distiller and
importer of the wine, predicted that sales in Japan will not be
affected by the one week's delay because the company has found that
``Beaujolais Nouveau's popularity increases year after year'' in
Japan.
   Suntory imported some 58,880 cases of the 1989 Beaujolais Nouveau.
   ``Japanese won't make much fuss about being the first'' in
tasting the wine, Hisao Matsushita, manager of Foods and Beverages
for the Narita View Hotel, near Tokyo's Narita airport. Last year
the hotel sponsored wine-tasting parties to mark the beginning of
the wine season.

   Two Iraqi passenger jets overshot the

and five people were injured, the Anatolia news agency reported.
   The dispatch said the two planes, both flying from Baghdad, were

   After overshooting the runway, the planes came to a halt in a
field, Anatolia said. Five people were injured when passengers were
evacuated through escape chutes, it said.
   One plane, a Boeing 707, was carrying 155 passengers and the
second one, a Boeing 727, had 58 aboard, Anatolia reported.

   Daily Express newspaper columnist Jon Akass, a
30-year veteran of Fleet Street, died of cancer early Monday, his
editor said. He was 56.
   Akass began his career as a teaboy, or messenger, for the Glasgow
Herald. He worked for regional newspapers and came to national
attention at the Manchester office of the now defunct Daily Herald
when he was asked to write a front-page story about a plane crash at
Munich Airport.
   The crash killed 21 people, including half the Manchester United
soccer team.
   His editor admired his writing style and, at age 24, Akass was
called to the paper's head office in London to write a column four
times a week.
   ``He was a brilliant writer who had a quite unique touch and he
will be irreplaceable,'' said Daily Express editor Nicholas Lloyd.
   Akass is survived by his wife Peggy and four children: Jon,
William, Mark and Jackie.

   A bomb exploded in a second-floor hallway
of the downtown Treasury Building on Monday morning, killing a
police explosives expert who was trying to remove it, authorities
said.
   No one took responsibility for the attack.
   A treasury employee arriving for work alerted the bomb squad when
he noticed a suspicious package outside an elevator, according to an
Interior Ministry aide, Jorge Burgos.
   The building, next door to the presidential palace, was evacuated
and police explosives experts had moved in when the blast occurred,
Burgos said.
   He said a lieutenant, Fernando Toledo, was killed and a corporal,
Javier Chavez, was seriously wounded.

<TEXT>
   North Korea's ambassador to Moscow has
returned home, apparently in reaction to talks between the leaders
of South Korea and the Soviet Union, the national news agency said
Monday.
   In Moscow, however, a North Korean Embassy official said the
ambassador had gone back to North Korea to attend a meeting of the
nation's parliament, of which he is a member.
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev were scheduled to meet Monday in San Francisco for
talks on normalizing relations and easing hostilities on the divided
Korean peninsula.
   The talks would be the first between the top leaders of the two
countries, which have no diplomatic relations. The Soviet Union is
an arms provider and chief ally to Communist North Korea, an
archenemy of capitalist South Korea.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, quoted an unidentified
highly placed government official as saying North Korean Ambassador
Son Song Pil left Moscow May 25 when rumors of the Roh-Gorbachev
meeting began to spread.
   Yonhap quoted the Seoul official as saying North Korea may soon
make bold proposals concerning a summit between Roh and North Korean
leader Kim Il Sung. Roh was expected to ask Gorbachev to help set up
a summit with Kim.
   In Moscow, a second secretary at the North Korean Embassy's
protocol department, who gave his name only as Liu, said the
ambassador left the Soviet capital May 22 for a Supreme People's
Assembly session that began May 24. He said the ambassador was
expected back in Moscow next week.
   A Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman said he was unaware of any
North Korean protest that might have led to the ambassador's
departure from Moscow.

<HEAD>Court Strengthens Government's Power to Keep Withheld Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today strengthened the
government's power to keep the taxes withheld from businesses about
to declare bankruptcy.
   Voting 9-0, the justices ruled that the trustee of bankrupt
American International Airways is not entitled to recover $700,000
in taxes paid to the Internal Revenue Service.
   The airline had become delinquent by the spring of 1984 in
withholding Social Security and income taxes from employee wages and
excise taxes collected from passengers.
   The IRS then ordered the airline to file monthly, instead of
quarterly, tax returns and open a special bank account to handle the
tax deposits.
   American International filed for bankruptcy in July 1984 to try
to reorganize the business and pay off some of the money owed
creditors. That effort failed and three months later a trustee was
appointed to liquidate the company.
   The trustee sought to recover $1.6 million in taxes paid to the
IRS in the months leading up to the liquidation.
   A bankruptcy judge in Pennsylvania permitted the trustee to
recover $700,000 from the government and the IRS appealed to the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Philadelphia.
   The appeals court said the trustee may not recover the $700,000.
The balance collected by the IRS was not at issue in that ruling or
today's decision.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the high court, said the
$700,000 was not the property of American International, but rather
was being held in trust for the IRS.
   The case is Begier vs. IRS, 899-393.

   A woman who wanted to start a high school
Bible study club five years ago said a U.S. Supreme Court decision
today will send a clear message to schools that they can't
discriminate against religion.
   In an 8-1 decision, the high court ruled that student prayer
groups must be allowed to meet at public schools that permit other
organized extracurricular activities. The court said a federal law
aimed at permitting religious clubs in public schools does not
violate constitutionally required separation of church and state.
   ``I'm very glad it was an 8-1 decision. It makes it very clear
that way,'' said Bridget Mergens Mayhew.
   ``It's got to be clear to all school officials that they can't
discriminate against religion any more,'' she said in a telephone
interview her home at nearby Offutt Air Force Base, where her
husband is stationed.
   Mrs. Mayhew, now 23, was a senior at Westside High School in 1985
when school officials turned down her request to start an
extracurricular club _ something like the chess club _ in which
members would discuss the Bible.
   ``I never thought that it would go this far,'' she recalled.
``Goodness gracious, it was January 1985. I was a senior in high
school and I thought the day after I asked we would have a club
started.''
   But school officials said allowing a Bible study group to meet at
the school after class would violate the constitutionally required
separation of church and state.
   ``Naturally, we're disappointed with today's ruling but we're
unable to comment further until we have had an opportunity to study
the high court's opinion ... and see how it will affect our
district,'' said Di Saggau, a spokeswoman for the Westside Community
Schools District.
   ``Of course we will comply with the ruling, but we just want to
analyze it further to see how it affects what we have in place,''
she said.
   Mrs. Mayhew said there are still students at the 1,530-student
high school interested in starting such a club.
   ``I wish we could have had it,'' she said. ``I think it would
have changed the course of things, I think, for a lot of people. I
think it would have strengthened a lot of people.''
   Westside High Principal James Findley said today that he knew of
one student _ a senior who graduated this year _ who had been
interested in starting a Bible study club. Classes ended last week
for the school year and don't resume until August.
   ``I don't know if we'll have students interested in it or not,''
Findley said.
   Mrs. Mayhew, who was raised as a Roman Catholic but became a
member of the Assembly of God Chuch, said discussing and sharing
religious beliefs strengthens people and that is important for
teen-agers.
   ``It's a source of strength to be able to share your faith and
share what you believe. I think it's a very important part of that
age because you're a kid and you've got all these things coming at
you,'' she said.
   She said it would make an alternative available ``to all those
different things you can get involved with _ drugs or whatever.''

<HEAD>Phone Company Poll Finds Many Want Cable TV Competitors</HEAD>

   Most Americans would welcome cable television
competition, according to a Gallup Poll released Monday by one of
the telephone companies eager to get into the business.
   A majority of those surveyed also said they would like to have
two-way video services _ such as movies on demand, library services
and office-in-the-home _ that could be provided through a network of
high-capacity, fiber-optic telephone lines.
   ``This is a clear indication that the public would favor
competition and innovation,'' said Kent B. Foster, president of GTE
Telephone Operat
GTE also offers phone service.
   Burns' proposal would amend a draft proposal by the Senate
Commerce Committee staff that would allow phone companies to offer
only a ``video dial tone'' to subscribers _ to transmit video
programming, but not to own it.
   The committee was scheduled to vote on the proposals Thursday.
   A House bill by Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., also would allow phone
companies to own video programming in their service areas, but those
provisions weren't included in a draft bill offered last month by
the House Energy and Commerce Committee staff.
   However, committee chairman Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., has
promised Boucher he'll consider such an amendment, Larry Clinton,
Boucher's legislative director, said Friday.
   Most observers think it's unlikely a bill with such telephone
provisions will pass Congress this year.
   The Gallup Poll, conducted April 30-May 2 by telephone with 1,000
people, found that:
   _Sixty-eight percent of those polled thought they would benefit
if other companies provided cable service.
   _From 50 percent to 59 percent said they would use services such
as office-in-the-home, home banking and medical consultation
services; 69 percent to 74 percent said they would use classroom
instruction and library services and choose movies at any time of
the day. The survey did not tell respondents what such services
would cost.
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
   Some sources have estimated that as little 3 percent of the
nation's approximately 9,000 cable TV communities have more than one
cable TV franchise. Cable executives contend it's not economically
feasible to have more than one video wire going into homes.

   Police closed off roads leading to Beijing's
university area tonight following a protest in which hundreds of
students hurled bricks and bottles at security forces on the
anniversary of the bloody suppression of the pro-democracy movement.
   Rifle-toting police set up roadblocks near universities in
northwest Beijing and stopped most cars from entering. All foreign
journalists were turned back.
   One Western reporter saw three truckloads of riot police, armed
with shields and rifles, entering the university area. Security
forces armed with AK-47 rifles also patrolled near Beijing
University.
   About midnight Sunday, Western reporters outside Beijing
University heard glass breaking and students clapping. Students
hurled bottles and other objects at security forces on the street
beneath their dormitory windows, setting off a campus rally of about
1,000 students.
   The protest was the boldest anti-government demonstration since
troops crushed the pro-democracy movement one year ago, and it
defied the heaviest security Beijing has seen since martial law was
lifted in January. Several Western journalists were roughed up and
briefly detained by police.
   Thousands of soldiers and police were out in force throughout the
city during the day. For a fourth straight day, Tiananmen Square was
sealed off by paramilitary police to prevent any attempt to honor
victims of the June 3-4 crackdown.
   Hundreds and possibly thousands of unarmed civilians were killed
in last year's army attack, which cleared the square and the rest of
central Beijing of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Students led last spring's pro-democracy protests, attracting
workers, intellectuals and some peasants to their campaign for
reform and against official corruption. For weeks, they occupied
Tiananmen, China's symbolic center. Today, vanloads of police
guarded streets near the 100-acre square.
   At the rally at Beijing University, hundreds of student
protesters shouted, ``Get rid of Li Peng!'' The Chinese premier, of
all the leaders involved in the crackdown, is the most widely blamed
and hated.
   The Beijing University campus was quiet the rest of the day, and
students went to class. University authorities told students they
could face repercussions if they ignored orders to stay on campus.
   The great majority, cowed by a year of intimidation, obeyed. But
some students said they were prepared to join any protest that
occurred. ``We're tightly controlled, but we haven't given in,''
said one.
   Thousands of political activists were arrested nationwide in the
months that followed the June 3-4 assault, and many remain jailed
without charge.
   The government has purged Communist reformers and staged a
massive ideological campaign to stifle dissent. All students are
required to take courses in Marxism and Mao Tse-tung and a clean
political record has become key to getting a good job or a passport
to visit overseas.
   Only a few isolated protests have since been attempted, although
anger over the army crackdown remains widespread.
   The Communist Party's official People's Daily, in a front-page
editorial today, said the government's decision to use force to end
last year's demonstrations was ``absolutely correct and necessary''
to preserve stability.
   Despite the tight security, a middle-aged Chinese man attempted
to pass out leaflets near the entrance to the Forbidden City across
the street from the square, foreign witnesses said. He was quickly
taken away by police.
   A Buddhist monk and a disciple who were chanting and beating a
drum on a bridge at the entrance to the Forbidden City were also
chased off by police. It was not clear if they were detained.
   On Sunday, two people were arrested near the square for trying to
deliver protest messages to Western television crews.
   Convoys of police vehicles with flashing lights and soldiers on
foot circled the university district Sunday evening, while security
forces checked vehicles at major intersections.
   Witnesses said the Beijing University protest began when a small
group of students hurled bottles, rusty bicycle wheels and other
objects at security forces on the street beneath their dormitory
windows.
   The students then marched to other dormitories, gathering
hundreds of supporters and singing the Internationale, the anthem of
the international socialist movement.
   Several students gave speeches calling for an end to corrupt
government and respect for intellectuals.
   In one address, Li Minqi, a junior majoring in economics
management, demanded that land be returned to the peasants and
factories to the workers.
   Li was seen being led away, possibly by plainclothes police, but
students said later it was not known whether he had been arrested.
   The demonstration ended peacefully at about 1:30 a.m.
   But security forces detained about a dozen foreign journalists
who had just left the campus, and forced them to line up against a
wall, according to one American in the group.
   ``Guns were in our faces,'' the American said on condition of
anonymity. He said the security officials knocked Los Angeles Times
correspondent David Holley to the ground and hit his wife, Fumio,
before allowing the group to leave. The Holleys later were detained
again but released after 15 minutes.
   Around the world, demonstrations were held Sunday to mark the
anniversary of the military crackdown, the largest in Hong Kong
where about 100,000 demonstrated. Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule
in 1997.
   Smaller demonstrations were held in Taiwan, Japan, Britain,
Canada and the United States.

   Because of a marketing strategy by the Union Interprofessionelle

countries in the time difference.
   But no chartered cargo flights into Japan will be allowed for
security reasons during the 10 days before and after the Nov. 11-12

<HEAD>Court Makes It Easier for Prosecutors to Use Seized Items in
California Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today made it easier for
prosecutors to use items seized by police without court warrants as
evidence against criminal defendants.
   Items discovered ``in plain view'' during warrantless police
searches may be used as evidence even if the discovery was not
inadvertent, the justices said by a 7-2 vote in a California case.
   Clarifying its 19-year-old plain view doctrine, the court said
inadvertent discovery ``is not a necessary condition.''
   The two keys to whether such warrantless seizures are
constitutional, the court said, are that an item's incriminating
character be immediately apparent and police had lawful authority to
be where the item was found.
   ``Even though inadvertence is a characteristic of most legitimate
`plain view' seizures, it is not a necessary condition,'' Justice
John Paul Stevens wrote for the court.
   Justices William J. Brennan and Thurgood Marshall dissented.
Brennan wrote for the two that such seizures by police violate the
Constitution's Fourth Amendment, which bans unreasonable searches
and seizures.
   ``The court today ignores the explicit language of the Fourth
Amendment, which protects possessory interest in the same manner as
it protects privacy interests,'' Brennan said.
   The decision upheld the criminal conviction of Terry Brice
Horton, sentenced to eight years and eight months in prison for the
1985 holdup of Erwin Paul Wallaker, the treasurer of a San Jose coin
club.
   Wallaker was returning home from a coin show with two briefcases
containing $10,000 in cash and $20,000 worth of coins.
   He was accosted by two people wearing Halloween masks who stunned
him with an electrical device and robbed the cash, coins and his
jewelry.
   Wallaker told police he recognized Horton's voice, a distinct
Southern drawl.
   The police searched Horton's home and found, among other things,
two stun guns. But the court warrant authorizing the search of
Horton's home mentioned only the cash, coins and jewelry _ not the
weapons.
   While searching for the robbery's proceeds, which they did not
find, police officers found the stun guns out in plain view.
   California courts allowed the guns to be used as evidence against
Horton, and those rulings were upheld today.
   ``The items seized from (Horton's) home were discovered during a
lawful search authorized by a valid warrant,'' Stevens wrote for the
court.
   He added: ``When they were discovered, it was immediately
apparent to the officer that they constituted incriminating
evidence. He had probable cause ... to believe that the weapons ...
had been used in the crime he was investigating. The seizure was
authorized by the plain view doctrine.''
   The case is Horton vs. California, 88-7164.

   With sore knees and aching backs,
residents of this tiny resort town declared victory Monday in their
Sand Castle War with Myrtle Beach, S.C.
   ``We came, we fought, we are victorious,'' Nabiel Shawa,
administrator of this town of 1,500, said after surveyors measured a
sand castle built during the weekend.
   The castle, which included dragons and Teen-age Mutant Ninja
Turtles, measured 34,503 feet, or 6.53 miles _ enough for Long Beach
to retain title to the world's longest sand sculpture.
   A continent away, Myrtle Beach officials conceded that the sand
castle its residents had created was only 26,834 feet, or 5.1 miles.
But the South Carolina sand builders didn't take defeat lying down
on the beach.
   ``We've decided we are going to go again _ (on the) Fourth of
July,'' said Eric Eiseland, spokesman for the Myrtle Beach Chamber
of Commerce. ``All we're saying is it'll be longer than 6.5 and less
than 100.''
   Shawa said he wasn't sure Long Beach was ready to rejoin the
battle in a month. ``We might let them hold the title, at least for
awhile,'' he said. ``We're a little sore in the knee from being in
the sand, we're a bit wind-burnt and, quite honestly, tired.''

   President Bush said today U.S. allies gave the
superpower summit a ``very, very positive'' review even as he
acknowledged ``there's some problems'' that remain to be solved.
   Bush said he had conferred late Sunday by phone on the outcome of
the summit with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher and former President Reagan _ who was
meeting in San Francisco today for breakfast with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush dispatched Secretary of State James A. Baker III to
Copenhagen, Denmark, today to meet with his Soviet counterpart and
Germany's foreign minister about European security following the
unification of Germany.
   ``I am pleased with the results and I think the reception from
the American people was rather clear,'' Bush said as he began to
brief his Cabinet on the four-day meeting with Gorbachev.
   He won a sustained round of applause from the Cabinet _ the
friendliest audience in town _ as be braced for a congressional cold
shoulder over the provisional trade agreement that so pleased
Gorbachev.
   `There's some problems,'' Bush told the Cabinet at brief remarks
during a picture-taking session. ``I never said there wouldn't be.''
   The president said he talked to Reagan _ who had five summits of
his own with the Soviet leader _ to ``give him a briefing as to what
he might anticipate at his breakfast.''
   ``The mood ... from the allies so far, the ones I've talked to,
has been very, very positive,'' Bush said.
   ``We'll have to wait and see what the response is from around the
world. But so far our experts have been very pleased,'' Bush said.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said later today that
Gorbachev's threat to suspend exit visas for Soviet jews could cause
``some problems,'' suggesting it did not square with the Soviet
leader's assurances of freer emigration policies.
   Gorbachev on Sunday suggested he would consider suspending the
visas if Israel continues to settle the emigrants in occupied
territories.
   ``We view it with concern. We want open emigration,'' Fitzwater
said.
   He said the status of Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union is
one thing that Bush will consider when he makes a final judgement on
sending to Congress the trade pact he formalized with Gorbachev at
the summit.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater announced that East German Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere will visit Bush at the White House next Monday on
June 11. It is the first time an East German leader has ever been to
the White House, Fitzwater said.
   The two will discuss a number of topics related to German
unification, the spokesman said.
   The Cabinet applauded Bush before reporters were let into the
Cabinet Room. Asked what the applause was about, Bush cracked to
reporters: ``My scintillating personality, I guess.''
   Despite sharp differences remaining on the fate of the Baltics
and on the military alignment of a reunified Germany, Bush and
Gorbachev are heralding their summit gains and predicting another
1990 session to nail down arms treaties that eluded them this time.
   They ended their second summit on Sunday, speaking warmly of each
other and proclaiming the meeting a big success. ``Neither of us
tried to cover over the differences,'' Bush said.
   Bush's decision to sign a trade pact with Gorbachev without first
winning concessions on Lithuania has drawn reproach from both
parties.
   However, Bush has said he will only send the measure to Congress
if the Supreme Soviet passes a liberalized emigration law.
   And a gesture by Gorbachev in lightening up on Lithuania _ in
exchange for the prize of the trade treaty _ could quickly turn the
situation around in Congress.
   Both leaders voiced hope that they can meet again before the end
of the year _ Gorbachev invited Bush to Moscow _ to sign treaties to
cut long-range nuclear missiles and trim conventional forces in
Europe.
   Bush and Gorbachev also talked about having regular, perhaps
annual, meetings without the usual summit fanfare of 21-gun salutes,
state dinners and military bands.
   Bush said, ``We're now at a stage in the U.S.-Soviet relationship
and, indeed, in world history where we should miss no opportunity to
complete the extraordinary tasks before us.''
   Gorbachev said of his summit host, ``This is the kind of person
to do business with.''
   The two leaders made significant progress on the nuclear pact,
signing a framework agreement to cut arsenals by 30 percent and
pledging to sign the completed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty
(START) by year's end.
   ``This is the first time that we're not just limiting, but we
will be reducing the most devastating means of warfare,'' Gorbachev
said.
   But deep divisions remained between them on levels of troops and
tanks in Europe, a dispute directly related to another disagreement
over the future political and military face of a unified Germany.
   Other disputes also loomed _ in particular, the continuing
stalemate over Lithuania and the other rebellious Baltic republics.
Bush called the Baltic standoff ``one of the thorns in the side of
an overall relationship.''
   For his part, Gorbachev _ who gave no ground on Lithuania at the
Washington talks _ brushed off the topic. He repeated a favorite
recent line _ that Bush would have restored constitutional order
``within 24 hours'' had a state in the United States declared
independence as did Lithuania.
   Lack of major progress on the Baltic stalemate is building
substantial congressional opposition to the trade pact, and Bush
conceded that Gorbachev had given him no assurances that Moscow was
any closer to lifting its economic embargo against Lithuania.
   ``I'm not sure anything has changed,'' Bush said.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Monday by the Supreme Court.
   
   BIBLE CLUBS
   
   The court ruled student prayer groups must be allowed to meet at
public schools that permit other organized extracurricular
activities.
   The justices, voting 8-1, said a 1984 federal law aimed at
permitting religious clubs in public schools does not violate
constitutionally required separation of church and state.
   The court overruled Omaha, Neb., school officials who refused to
approve a high school Bible-reading club.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the court, said the
Equal Access Act of 1984 passes the court's long-standing three-part
test aimed at assuring separation of church and state.
   The case is Board of Education vs. Mergens, 88-1597.
   
   MIRANDA
   
   The court ruled that police undercover agents may seek to elicit
confessions from jailed criminal suspects without first having to
give so-called Miranda warnings.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices said jailed criminal suspects need
not be told about their right to remain silent or to get a lawyer's
help before being questioned by someone secretly working for the
police.
   The case is Illinois vs. Perkins, 88-1972.
   
   SEARCHES
   
   The court made it easier for prosecutors to use items seized by
police without court warrants as evidence against criminal
defendants.
   Items discovered ``in plain view'' during warrantless police
searches may be used as evidence even if the discovery was not
inadvertent, the justices said by a 7-2 vote in a California case.
   The case is Horton vs. California, 88-7164.
   
   LEGAL FEES
   
   The court used a dispute over Haitian refugee rights to
strengthen a federal law requiring the government to pay legal fees
to winning opponents in lawsuits.
   The court unanimously rejected Bush administration arguments
aimed at limiting the attorneys' fees.
   The case is Commissioner of INS vs. Jean, 89-601.
   
   NUCLEAR SAFETY
   
   The court ruled that nuclear industry ``whistleblowers'' who say
they were disciplined for complaining about lax safety may sue their
employers under state personal injury laws.
   The court unanimously said such lawsuits are not pre-empted by a
federal law protecting such whistleblowers.
   The case is English vs. GE, 89-152.
   
   IMMIGRANTS
   
   The court agreed to hear a Bush administration appeal aimed at
giving federal officials more power to deny temporary legal status
to immigrant farmworkers.
   The court said it will review a ruling that said the workers are
entitled to various procedural protections when applying for such
residential permits.
   The case is McNary vs. Haitian Refugee Center, 89-1332.
   
   NATURAL GAS
   
   The court agreed to study the government's power to lift price
controls on some natural gas, a case that has tens of millions of
dollars at stake for consumers.
   The justices said they will review federal regulations that,
among other things, allow gas producers to raise some prices charged
to pipeline companies.
   The cases are Mobil Oil vs. United Distribution Companies,
89-1452, and FERC vs. United Distribution Companies, 89-1453.
   
   AIRLINES
   
   The court agreed to decide whether passengers on international
flights may sue airlines for the emotional distress they allegedly
suffer in near-crashes that cause them no physical harm.
   The court said it will review a ruling that Eastern Airlines may
be forced to pay passengers who were on a flight that landed safely
in Miami after all the plane's engines failed briefly in the air.
   The case is Eastern Airlines vs. Floyd, 89-1598.

<HEAD>Referendum Invalid Due to Lack of Voter Participation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two environmentalists threatened Monday to set
themselves on fire to protest low voter turnout in a national
referendum on environmental issues, news agencies reported.
   The turnout was so low it appeared the results of the referendum
would be declared invalid.
   According to results from 90 of 95 provinces, just 42.5 percent
of voters turned out to cast ballots Sunday and Monday, the Interior
Ministry said. More than 50 percent of the 46.8 million eligible
voters had to participate for the referendum to be valid.
   Voters were asked whether they wanted to restrict hunting and the
use of pesticides in food production. Environmental groups urged
``yes'' votes. However, major political parties did not take strong
positions on the issues, and the campaign was low-key.
   In Milan, the two environmentalists blamed the turnout on ``poor
information'' by state-run television and threatened self-immolation
in front of the TV station's offices.
   As police, firefighters and ambulances arrived, the demonstrators
changed their minds, according to Italian news agencies.
   Historically Italy has had high voter participation. More than 80
percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the last national
election in 1987.

<HEAD>Feinstein Buoyed By Polls In California Campaign's Final Days</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Former San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein got encouraging news
Monday from two new polls in the California governor's race as she
and scores of candidates played out the final hours of primary
campaigns in nine states.
   In the often nasty Democratic primary campaign, Feinstein
maintained a lead over state Attorney General John Van de Kamp in
the latest statewide surveys. For months the two candidates have
attacked each other on issues ranging from abortion and crime to who
could best handled the state's fiscal affairs.
   Other new polls showed close races Tuesday for gubernatorial
nominations in Alabama, Iowa and New Mexico. In North Carolina, a
runoff between two Democrats will determine who challenges
Republican Sen. Jesse Helms, while four Montana Republicans were
vying for the chance to run against Democratic Sen. Max Baucus.
   Baucus was among seven incumbent senators facing token primary
opposition at most on Tuesday.
   The others were Democrats Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Howell
Heflin of Alabama and Tom Harkin of Iowa, and Republicans Thad
Cochran of Mississippi, Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Larry
Pressler of South Dakota.
   Except for Cochran, who will have no Democratic opponent in
November, renomination isn't necessarily a free ticket to another
term.
   Harkin faces a tough re-election race against GOP Rep. Tom Tauke,
while Heflin and Pressler also are under challenge from potentially
strong opponents. Heflin's foe in November will be Republican Bill
Cabannis and Pressler will come up against Democrat Ted Muenster.
   With his outspoken conservative views, Helms attracts both
intense support and equally strong opposition. The Democrats, who
must decide between Harvey Gantt and Mike Easley for their nominee,
hope to capitalize on the latter in the general election campaign.
   Gantt led a six-candidate field in the May 8 primary but failed
to reached the 40 percent needed to avoid a runoff. The former mayor
of Charlotte is seeking to become the first black nominated for
statewide office in North Carolina.
   The race for the Democratic nomination for governor of Alabama
was headed for a runoff, with none of the five contenders likely to
get the 50 percent needed to win outright in the first round. The
top two finishers would be on the ballot for a runoff June 26 to
decide who challenges Republican Gov. Guy Hunt.
   A Birmingham News-Huntsville Times poll published Sunday said
former Gov. Fob James had the support of 26.1 percent, followed by
state Attorney General Don Siegelman with 25.6 percent, Rep. Ronnie
Flippo 20.5 percent, teacher-lobbyist Paul Hubbert 20.1 percent and
state Sen. Charles Bishop 3.3 percent. The poll had a margin of
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   The biggest 1990 prize is the California governor's office.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian is retiring after two terms and
the GOP recruited Sen. Pete Wilson to enter the race to succeed him.
Re-elected to the Senate in 1988 with 53 percent of the vote, Wilson
became the immediate favorite to keep the office in Republican hands.
   With the 1990 Census likely to give California six new House
seats starting with the 1992 election, control of the governor's
office could determine which party draws the new district lines.
Democrats already control both legislative chambers.
   In addition to targeting the governor's race, Republicans also
are sponsoring two ballot initiatives on redistricting in
California. One would take it out of the hands of the legislature,
the other would give the governor an absolute veto over any plan.
   A new Los Angeles Times poll said Feinstein had a 13-point lead _
a gain of two points over a similar survey early in May. The poll
gave the former mayor 42 percent and Van de Kamp 29 percent. There
were 29 percent still undecided or supporting one of the nine minor
candidates on the Democratic primary ballot. The survey had a 5
percentage point margin of error.
   Mervin Field's California Poll, which gave Feinstein a slim 3
percent lead earlier this month, reported that margin had opened up
to 8 points over Van de Kamp, 42-34, in polling that concluded
Sunday. It had a 3.5 percentage point margin of error.
   A new Iowa poll in the race for the Democratic nomination for
governor was published Sunday in theDes Moines Register and said
Iowa House Speaker Don Avenson had moved into the lead with support
from 32 percent of those surveyed, compared with 25 percent for
state Attorney General Tom Miller. Former banker John Chrystal was
at 19 percent, and 20 percent said they were undecided. The survey
had a margin of error of 3.9 percentage points.
   The winner of the Democratic primary will face Republican Gov.
Terry Branstad in the general election.
   In New Mexico, a new poll published Sunday in the Albuquerque
Journal said state Senate Minority Leader Les Houston and former
legislator Frank Bond each had the support of 29.2 percent of the
registered Republicans asked their preference in the GOP
gubernatorial primary.
   On the Democratic side, former Gov. Bruce King had the backing of
42.7 percent, while state Attorney General Paul Bardacke was
supported by 31.5 percent. The New Mexico survey had a margin of
error of 4 percentage points on the Democratic side and 5 percentage
points on the GOP side.

   Capitalism reared its head at Stanford
University today, as students scrambled for the last remaining
tickets to see Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the wealthy
offered fistfuls of cash for those ducats.
   Students Erik Jorgensen, 21, and Alex Levy, 20, stood in line
from 2 a.m., hoping for a shot at tickets that had not been picked
up. A lottery had been held to distribute 1,700 seats for
Gorbachev's talk, and 6,000 other tickets to the rest of the events
on his university visit.
   ``Gorbachev probably would have felt right at home this
morning,'' said Jorgensen. ``The lines we stood in were very much
like the food lines in the Soviet Union.''
   They decided to hang on to their tickets, but a friend sold his
for $425 to a San Jose doctor, Jorgensen said.
   The university set up an official computer lottery system to
distribute the coveted tickets May 29, but free enterprise
immediately florished with talk of scalping tickets for as much as
$1,800 apiece.
   Two sophomores, Jeff Vierling and Marlowe Johnson, said they had
heard the top price was $1,800. They could only attest personally to
a $1,400 sale.
   Vierling, a 19-year-old electrical engineering major, and
Johnson, a 21-year-old international relations major, sat on a curb
today with a sign asking for serious offers only. They told those
who stopped they wanted $1,000 or more for each of their two tickets.
   ``It's airplane tickets. It's a lot of things. It's a CD
player,'' said Vierling.
   Added Johnson, who wants to finance a European trip: ``I can
probably see him better on TV.''
   Stanford officials programmed computers to randomly decide who
among the university's staff and students would attend the events.
Students accounted for about 60 percent of the winners' list, which
was published in university publications.
   However, students were allocated only 550 seats in the 1,700-seat
memorial auditorium for Gorbachev's speech. The other were divided
among faculty, staff, dignitaries and the media.
   Five thousand ticket-holding members of the Stanford community
were allowed to pass through security lines to see Gorbachev and his
wife, Raisa, greeted by Stanford President Donald Kennedy and former
Secretary of State George Shultz.
   About 550 others were allowed access to the cordoned-off lawn of
the business school to watch as the Soviet president was escorted to
the auditorium for his scheduled half-hour speech.
   Students, gawkers and Soviet security guards gathered outside
Stanford's Memorial Auditorium several hours before Gorbachev was
scheduled to arrive.
   Sonoma resident Robin Nyder said she had a pass to stand near the
auditorium _ but not to see the speech.
   ``I told my fiance if I have a choice between shaking his hand
and taking a picture, forget the photo,'' Nyder said.

<HEAD>Lithuanian President Hopes Gorbachev Softens His Stand When He
Returns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuania's president said today he hoped Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would reassess his stance toward the
breakaway Baltic state after returning from the Washington summit.
   But President Vytautas Landsbergis added in an interview with the
Voice of America radio that he did not hear any encouraging words
from Gorbachev during his meeting with President Bush.
   ``The worst would have been if Mikhail Gorbachev came out with
the impression that everything he is doing vis-a-vis Lithuania is
permitted,'' Landsbergis said in the interview, a transcript of
which was provided in English to The Associated Press.
   Landsbergis said he hoped the Soviet leader would ``thoroughly
review'' the matter when he returned home.
   He accused Gorbachev of using ``propaganda methods'' in dealing
with the republic, which declared independence from Moscow March 11
and triggered a Kremlim economic embargo of all fuel and most food
supplies.
   Gorbachev has demanded that the republic revoke the declaration
before starting negotiations on Lithuanian secession on the basis of
the Soviet constitution.
   Landsbergis today reitereated Lithuania's refusal to reverse its
declaration, saying ``I don't think we'll ever be able to take this
step,'' according to the U.S. government-run VOA.
   At the summit, Bush and Gorbachev agreed to a trade pact that
Bush said is conditioned only on the Soviet government's approval of
liberalized emigration laws. Bush previously had said Moscow also
must end its blockade against Lithuania, but he changed that
position Sunday.
   Landsbergis told VOA that if the West continues to allow
Gorbachev's ``destructive'' policies toward Lithuania, the Baltic
state would seek more support from the Russian Federation, the
largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Kazimiera Prunskiene, Lithuania's prime minister, told the VOA
that Lithuania is looking forward to dealing with ``democratic
Russia.'' She said a delegation from Russia was in Lithuania
preparing to negotiate direct agreements outside Soviet authority.
   Populist reformer Boris Yeltsin, the Communist Party maverick who
has openly challenged Gorbachev, was elected to the Russian
Federation presidency last week and promised to support Lithuania
after he forms his new government.
   Mrs. Prunskiene, who has met separately with Bush and Gorbachev
in recent weeks, said she believed Gorbachev would modify his
position on Lithuania after returning home.
   ``It's one thing to talk tough in America's forums and to disply
this firm position by the U.S.S.R. and Gorbachev himself, but it is
another thing to understand that the U.S. Congress, as well as the
situation in the Soviet Union, are unfavorable to his rigid position
...,'' she told VOA.
   The U.S. Congress must still approve the trade pact, and some
lawmakers already have said they would not allow the Soviet Union to
become a most-favored-nation trading partner until Gorbachev ends
his economic squeeze on Lithuania.
   The most-favored-nation designation qualifies a trading partner
for the lowest U.S. tariffs.

<HEAD>Jury Selection Gets Under Way as Mayor Blasts Prosecutors</HEAD>

   Jury selection began today in the drug and
perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry as the mayor blasted federal
prosecutors for using tactics more befitting a ``totalitarian kind
of society.''
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to all 14 charges against him.
Sources close to the case have said his lawyers have been conducting
plea bargain talks with federal prosecutors.
   The mayor, accompanied by his wife, Effi, entered the courthouse
through a side door without speaking to reporters. Inside the
courtroom, more than 100 potential jurors were given questionnaires
to fill out designed to gauge their fitness for the jury that will
hear the case.
   In an interview hours earlier with a local radio station, the
third-term mayor launched a pre-emptive strike against the
prosecution.
   ``Its frightening that since 1983 my family have had to go
through my mail being opened, my bank accounts checked, my tax
return looked at, my phones tapped.
   ``Can you imagine, you can't even have a conference in your
bedroom with your wife for fear that they're listening to anything
you may say? ... It's been a thing that you thought may happen in a
totalitarian kind of society.''
   The mayor also said ``a local television station has gotten a
copy of the tape from the prosecutors. They're trying to figure out
now how to show it,'' he said in an apprent reference to the
videotape that made during the FBI sting operation that resulted in
Barry's arrest on drug charges on Jan. 18.
   Judy Smith, spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens, said
the office would have no comment. The station, WRC-TV, also said it
would have no comment.
   Outside the courthouse, nearly two dozen Guardian Angels paced
silently, wearing their trademark red berets, holding aloft signs
calling for the mayor to resign. The Guardian Angels are a
self-appointed anti-crime group.
   About 125 prospective jurors began filling out a lengthy
questionaire designed to evaluate their fitness to sit on the
12-member jury, and another group of 125 was slated to fill out the
same paperwork this afternoon. The press and public were not
permitted in the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson.
   Interviews of the prospective jurors were expected to begin
Tuesday. In addition to the dozen jurors, six alternates will be
picked.
   Federal prosecutors have indicated for months that they are as
interested in getting Barry out of office as they are in winning a
jury verdict.
   Sources said Sunday that Stephens was holding out for a felony
plea and a deal that would have the mayor leave office, while Barry
was willing to consider only misdemeanors.
   A felony plea or conviction would bar the mayor from holding
office and from seeking re-election. A misdemeanor conviction would
not.
   Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession, three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his
alleged drug use, and one misdemeanor conspiracy count that alleges
he consorted with at least 10 people on 20 occasions over the past
five years to buy and use cocaine. Barry has pleaded innocent to all
charges.
   Barry attended a church rally Sunday night and called the months
since his Jan. 18 arrest ``the most difficult time in my life.''
   ``I ain't gonna waste time,'' Barry said. ``I've come too far
from where I started from.'' After a standing ovation from the
crowd, he expressed confidence that his legal crisis will not bring
him down.
   Prospective jurors were being asked to fill out detailed
questionnaires today and were expected to undergo questioning by the
defense and prosecution starting by Tuesday.
   Twelve jurors and six alternates will be picked from the pool,
and it is expected that a week or more will be needed to empanel the
group.
   While Barry has said he only needs one juror to vote against
convicting him, some of his top aides and political advisers have
indicated they are extremely reluctant to see the case come to
trial. Sources familiar with the mayor's legal situation said
Barry's attorney, R. Kenneth Mundy, and Stephens were continuing
plea-bargain negotiations that began 10 days ago.
   Barry has not publicly revealed his re-election plans, but he has
made a series of campaign-style appearances around the nation's
capital since returning in March from seven weeks of substance abuse
treatment.
   A source familiar the plea-bargain talks said Sunday the two
sides ``are still far apart,'' but that neither Mundy nor Stephens
felt pressure to strike a quick deal.
   ``There is a feeling that they have until the end of jury
selection, at least,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``They are continuing to talk, and they are not so bogged
down as to cut off the discussions.''
   The papers jurors were given to fill out asks more than 100
questions _ around their knowledge of the Barry case, their general
feelings about the mayor, the city government, and the various
federal law enforcement agencies that participated in the lengthy
investigation that led to Barry's arrest and indictments.
   At the church service, a mixture of top Barry aides and his
former civil rights colleagues paid tribute to the mayor.
   ``I wouldn't trade this evening for anything in the world,'' said
Barry, who praised his wife Effi and his mother, Mattie Cummings,
for their support.
   Restaurateur Jeffrey Gildenhorn, said afterward, ``This was a
summation of his career, all the things he's done. ... Where we go
from here, no one knows.''

   Michael Jackson was hospitalized with
chest pains today and his doctor ran a battery of tests to determine
what felled the superstar entertainer, who had been ill for several
days.
   ``He's undergoing several important tests today,'' said Jackson
spokesman Bob Jones. ``I don't think it was a heart attack. He just
experienced some discomfort. He had been feeling bad the past two or
three days.''
   Jackson, 31, was taken to the emergency room at St. John's
Hospital and Health Center about 9 p.m. Sunday, complaining of chest
pains.
   ``Michael Jackson remains hospitalized (and) his physician, Dr.
Steven Hoefflin, states that he will be undergoing several
diagnostic tests,'' hospital spokeswoman Paulette Weir said in a
hospital statement.
   No other details were released by the hospital, which referred
inquiries to Jones.
   Lee Solters, a publicist for Jackson, wouldn't comment except to
say the singer had no history of heart problems.
   Jackson was staying in the same hospital as his friend Elizabeth
Taylor, who has been recovering from a near-fatal bout of pneumonia
and complications for nearly two months.
   Catapulted into the public eye at age 5 with the Jackson Five
family pop group, Jackson went on to become a one-man phenomenon.
   He sold more than 100 million albums in the 1980s and won an
unprecedented eight Grammy Awards for his 1982 release,
``Thriller,'' the most successful album of all time with sales of
more than 40 million copies worldwide.
   His last album, ``Bad,'' released in 1987, spawned five No. 1
hits.
   The reclusive star, known for wearing one white glove onstage,
has been celebrated as widely for his eccentricities as for his
music and choreography.
   He has often gone out in public wearing a disguise, has had
repeated cosmetic surgery, owns a menagerie of exotic pets and tried
unsuccessfully to buy the bones of ``Elephant Man'' John Merrick.
   Jackson was hospitalized in January 1984 with second-degree scalp
burns after his hair caught fire when a smoke bomb misfired during
the filming of a soft-drink commercial in Los Angeles.

   When Alexander P. Russo returned from his
stint as a World War II combat artist, he couldn't bear to draw
people. He had seen too many soldiers riddled with gunfire, too many
mangled bodies.
   ``I couldn't paint a figure for years,'' said Russo, who
witnessed the Allied invasion of the Normandy beaches on June 6,
1944. ``I wanted to do landscapes. I was trying to get my mind back
to a positive focus.''
   Russo was one of eight artists in the Navy's combat art section,
which he joined after the D-day invasion. They lived with the
troops, and followed them into battle, capturing the fighting on
sketchpads and later on canvas.
   ``I think good art, or great art, captures the sense of the
situation. In this case, it was the essence of battle, the horror of
battle,'' said Russo, a retired art professor from Hood College in
this western Maryland city.
   But Russo, who taught at the Corcoran School of Art in
Washington, D.C., and chaired Hood's art department for 15 years,
does not want to be known solely as a combat artist. His
contemporary art, which bridges realism and abstraction, is in
collections and museums in the United States and Europe.
   ``I'm a functioning artist. The war was just one phase,'' he said
last week. ``It was an opportunity to be creative, but it was just a
beginning.''
   Russo was 20 when he joined the Navy in October 1942 after
completing art studies at Pratt Institute in New York City. As part
of an amphibious intelligence unit, he made shoreline drawings and
plaster terrain models.
   He sketched troops landing in Sicily, and fires raging in London
after German bombing attacks.
   Russo's ``Firefighters in London at Night,'' is part of an
exhibit at the Washington Navy Yard in the nation's capital. The
painting, in brown, black, red and orange tones depicts firefighters
dousing flames that dart from windows and roofs toward a dark sky.
   Forty-four years ago Wednesday, Russo landed with thousands of
troops on the beaches of Normandy. ``I was moved by some things that
the others were not _ subtle things like troops waiting or grave
diggers pausing,'' Russo said.
   In his work from Normandy, Russo painted ``To the Burial
Ground,'' which shows soldiers tending to the dead on a hillside.
Four soldiers rest from digging. Two carry a covered stretcher to a
cemetery studded with crosses.
   Later, as part of the combat art section, Russo spent months in
Washington developing his sketches into complete works. The unit was
founded by Griffith Baily Coale, who persuaded the Navy to let
artists accompany ships into action and record the battles in ways
that photographers and journalists could not.
   ``There was practically no color photography done during World
War II. It was too bloody expensive,'' said John D. Barnett, curator
of the Navy Art Collection at the naval yard. ``The color wasn't
(true) so they figured they were better off with black and white.''
   Russo completed 250 drawings, sketches and paintings that are
part of the Navy's historic record of the war.
   ``It was the beginning of a search for deeper values that I'm
still searching for and still trying to represent in my work,'' he
said.

   Speaker Thomas S. Foley has restored calm, even
boredom, to a House of Representatives that a year ago was torn by
the downfall of his predecessor, Jim Wright. Some Democrats complain
the price of peace is too high.
   ``It is still holding,'' Foley said of the serenity that he made
his top priority after being sworn in as speaker a year ago
Wednesday. ``I think there's a better communication and a better
feeling between the parties and the leadership on each side.''
   Few would disagree. Sparks seldom fly during floor debates in the
way they did under Wright, who was seen as imposing his agenda on
the House and squelching dissent among both Democrats and
Republicans.
   Wright resigned May 31, 1989, after being formally accused of 69
instances of violating House rules, including charges he had
circumvented limits on outside income through bulk sales of a book
he wrote and charges he had improperly accepted $145,000 in gifts
from a Fort Worth, Texas, businessman with a direct interest in
legislation.
   ``I don't have the sense that I have to fight this leadership,''
said Rep. Tim Penny, D-Minn., a maverick conservative who often was
at odds with Wright. Foley and his leadership team, Penny said,
don't feel driven to play every floor vote as if it were a fight to
the death.
   ``There is more of an attempt to be fair to all sides,'' he said.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said there is a new
atmosphere of bipartisan trust. ``We're more inclined to try and
solve any differences between the two of us, with nobody around,''
he said.
   But calm is not everything, said Penny and several others who are
either House members or close observers of the institution. As they
look ahead to congressional elections this fall, and down the road
to the 1992 presidential campaign, they see a lack of any issue that
could help define the Democratic Party.
   Under Foley's leadership, the House has in recent weeks passed
major legislation on child care, clean air and civil rights for the
handicapped. But on the year's highest-profile issue, Bush's capital
gains tax cut, Foley was defeated last September when he lost the
support of one in four House Democrats.
   No one wants to return to the debilitating last months of Wright,
when the institution was paralyzed. But griping is growing louder
that Foley _ the nation's highest-ranking elected Democrat _ is too
slow to take on a popular president and be his party's political, as
well as legislative, leader.
   ``I don't think there's a sense across America that we're doing
anything about anything,'' Penny said. ``We are too focused on
ourselves. Getting along with each other is fine. ... But what we
are communicating to the American public is that we're afraid to
make any decisions.''
   ``We want the leaders to lead,'' said Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla.,
another conservative. ``We want to know what the priorities are,
what the agenda is, and to move out aggressively on that agenda.''
   Foley and his top lieutenants, Majority Leader Richard Gephardt,
D-Mo., and Whip William H. Gray III, D-Pa., were understandably
gun-shy after watching Wright's demise and the abrupt resignation of
former Whip Tony Coelho, McCurdy said. But the team now has
established itself, and it is time to move ahead, he said.
   Wright himself, now living in Fort Worth, Texas, and doing some
speaking and writing, obviously sees some shortcomings in his
successors, but declined in an interview to go into any detail.
   ``Things are not moving with perceptible clarity and direction,''
he said. But he said Foley's conciliatory style is ``in some ways
much better'' than his own impatience and predicted, ``Tom will be
speaker for a long time.''
   In many ways, the lack of a schism between Democrats and
Republicans is the product of a political scene that goes far beyond
Foley. The Democrat-controlled Congress faces a popular president in
George Bush, and one who himself is naturally averse to
confrontation.
   ``I can't stop him from adopting Democratic ideas, endorsing
Democratic philosophies, conceding Democratic priorities,'' Foley
said in an interview. ``I can't say, `Stop. Get across the road.
Stop talking about child care and clean air and the environment and
be a Republican in the same old nasty way''' as the last president,
Ronald Reagan.
   Foley said he is well aware of the unrest in his party among
those who desire conflict. But he said times have changed.
   ``It would be a bad mistake for us as a party to sharpen the
lines by being something we aren't,'' he said. ``I think the issues
are going to define themselves. There will be differences ... but
maybe not as hard and clear as they were with Ronald Reagan, who had
an ideological cut in a different direction.''

<TEXT>
   The death of a rare white Bengal tiger was
caused by a stuffed toy that it swallowed weeks ago, officials said.
   The 2-year-old male tiger named Mwelu drowned Sunday while
apparently suffering severe stomach pains. Visitors noticed the
tiger struggling in a pool before it sank, said David Conrod, a
spokesman for Busch Gardens theme park.
   The remains of a small stuffed animal were found in the tiger's
upper intestines, said Dr. John Olsen, chief veterinarian.
   Since the tiger apparently ate the toy three to six weeks ago,
two gallstones had formed around it, further blocking digestion and
creating what must have been painful stomach attacks, Olsen said.
   ``We ask that visitors not feed the animals or put things in the
displays, but sometimes it happens,'' Conrod said. ``Sometimes
things will be thrown in that people think the animals will play
with.''
   The tiger was one of about 140 white Bengals left in the world,
all of them in captivity, park officials said.

<HEAD>Decoy Hunting _ A Crime or Entrapment?</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENSBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officer Buck has been shot six times in
the line of duty, which doesn't bother his fellow officers a bit.
The people who have shot him aren't very happy about it, though.
   Officer Buck is a decoy deer who lives _ well, exists _ to get
shot.
   The 1{-year-old decoy, which was given its nickname by officials
at the Pennsylvania Game Commission, is placed along roads to help
wardens nab people who illegally hunt from the highway.
   Critics say the ploy amounts to entrapment; game wardens consider
it a stroke of genius.
   ``He's saved a lot of deer,'' said Dale Sleasman, a state game
official. ``You'd be surprised how many guys came up to us and said,
`We saw your decoy, but we didn't shoot it.' The decoy wasn't even
there.''
   Aaron Stiffey Sr., 46, of Bolivar, and James Wagner Jr., 31, of
New Florence, recently were convicted of shooting Officer Buck from
a road in rural Westmoreland County, just east of Pittsburgh. Their
attorney is appealing their convictions, saying the fake deer is
used to entrap people.
   ``That's the only reason that deer was there _ to entice someone
to shoot at it,'' said lawyer Richard Pohl. ``This five-point rack
is a neon sign saying, `Come shoot me.'''
   Patrick Noonan, an assistant district attorney in Westmoreland
County, said Officer Buck merely gives people an opportunity to
commit a crime.
   ``This is no different than an undercover officer dressed up to
solicit prostitution,'' he said.
   Sleasman said Officer Buck once started an argument between two
men. One carried a rifle and was preparing to shoot while a friend
tried to talk him out of shooting the bogus buck.
   The unarmed man ``took off running down a hill, shouting and
clapping his hands and trying to scare it away. He must have run
about 60 yards, shouting and screaming the whole time,'' Sleasman
said.
   ``He finally got to about 10 feet of the deer and turned around
and said, `You might as well shoot it. I think it's frozen.'''

<HEAD>American Workers' Productivity Plunges at an Annual Rate of 2.7
Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American workers' productivity has plunged at a
2.7 percent annual rate so far this year, the poorest showing since
the 1981-82 recession, as labor costs have continued to increase,
the government said Monday.
   ``It's the worst of both possible worlds,'' said economist David
Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co.
   Increased productivity, or getting each worker to produce more
for each hour he or she works, is vital to increasing Americans'
standard of living without inflation, many economists say.
   ``The first quarter is a very dismal statement on that score,''
said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co.
   Donald Ratajczak, director of Georgia State University's economic
forecasting center, said poor productivity might mean Americans'
standard of living ``is going to drift backward.''
   It also weakens the nation's ability to compete internationally,
analysts said.
   While productivity was falling, unit labor costs, a key gauge of
future price inflation, shot up at an annual rate of 7 percent.
That's putting a squeeze on profits, Sinai said.
   ``Businesses can't keep on employing people at those costs with
so little production,'' he said.
   The 2.7 percent productivity drop was the worst performance since
productivity fell at a rate of 5.5 percent in the fourth quarter of
1981, the Labor Department said.
   Private analysts said much of the decline was related to the
overall slowdown of the economy and was typical of an economy at the
end of expansion.
   The gross national product _ the total output of goods and
services _ grew at a sluggish 1.3 percent annual rate for the first
quarter.
   Monday's report, which provided revised figures on the first
quarter of 1990, showed the nation's lagging productivity was far
worse than earlier reported. Original data showed productivity
falling 1 percent.
   The GNP growth of 1.3 percent had also been revised downward from
preliminary data showing 2.1 percent growth.
   The 7 percent jump in unit labor costs for the January-March
period compared with a 4.5 percent increase during all of 1989.
   Hourly labor costs _ a major inflation measure for businesses _
rose at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first quarter of 1990.
Those costs increased by 5.5 percent for all of 1989.
   The report provided one bit of good news _ productivity in the
manufacturing sector climbed 4.9 percent so far this year, a huge
improvement over the 2 percent increase during all of 1989.
   Unit labor costs in that sector dropped 1.3 percent, compared
with the 2.2 percent increase during all of last year.
   Jones said factory workers' productivity was encouraging because
it might mean ``businesses have become leaner and meaner with the
financial restructuring of the 1980s.''
   ``Maybe the one positive fallout of the takeover craze has been
the cutbacks of excessive management and layoffs of unproductive
workers,'' Jones said.
   Ratajczak said manufacturers ``are feeling the heat of foreign
competition the strongest.''
   ``We don't know what it's going to take for retailers to become
more efficient,'' he said.
   Total business productivity, including farming, fell 2.1 percent
for the first quarter compared with a 1.1 percent gain for all of
1989.
   Since 1982, productivity growth has averaged 1.8 percent a year.
While a slight improvement over the 1.2 percent average growth rate
in the 1970s, it was still far below th 3.3 percent rate of increase
posted in the two decades after World War II.
   During all of last year, productivity rose just 0.9 percent, the
poorest showing since the 1981-82 recession.
   Monday's report showed that output in the non-farm sector rose 1
percent during the first quarter of 1990, well below the 3.9 percent
increase in the number of hours worked.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Protege Elected Ukrainian Republic President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chief of the Ukraine was
elected the republic's president on Monday over protests from
legislators and demonstrators who said he would have too much power,
local activists reported.
   Volodymyr Ivashko, a protege of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, received 60 percent of the votes in the Ukrainian Supreme
Soviet parliament, according to Rukh Press International, or Rukh.
It is an arm of the nationalist Ukrainian people's front.
   Opposition members and protesters objected to Ivashko's holding
both the Ukrainian party leadership and the republic's presidency,
according to the unofficial Rukh press, which has proved reliable in
the past.
   Gorbachev also has been criticized for holding both the
presidency and the post as general secretary of the Communist Party.
   Thousands of protesters gathered outside the parliament building
Monday in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev and chanted ``Ivashko out!''
and ``Shame on Communists!'' the report said.
   Activists in the Supreme Soviet said they may boycott future
sessions and form their own ``shadow parliament,'' Rukh reported.
   The Ukraine is the second-largest of the Soviet Union's 15
republics, with 51 million people. Its extensive heavy industry and
rich soil have earned it a reputation as the ``breadbasket'' of the
Soviet Union. Like other Soviet republics, the Ukraine has a
nationalist movement that has blossomed since Gorbachev came to
power in 1985.
   Ivashko, 58, took over as Ukrainian party chief last September
from hard-liner Vladimir Shcherbitsky and was made a full member of
the party's ruling Politburo in December. He replaces Valentina
Shevchenko as president, formally known as the parliament chairman.
   Ivashko is considered a relative moderate in the Communist Party
and a protege of Gorbachev. He has spoken out against growing
nationalism in the Ukraine. That puts him at odds with Rukh, the
popular movement whose platform includes both pro-democracy and
nationalist elements.
   Ivashko won 278 of 341 votes cast in the 449-member body,
according to the Interfax News Agency, which is affiliated with
state-run Radio Moscow. He defeated academician Igor Yukhnovsky, who
had most radical deputies' support; Vladimir Grinev, also a
professor; and Kiev Communist Party official Ivan Saly, Interfax
said.
   Rukh said Communist officials predicted that Ivashko soon would
step down from his party post to defuse the controversy.
   There has also been speculation that Gorbachev may resign as
Communist Party general secretary at a national party congress in
July, although he has denied such rumors. Gorbachev says holding
both the presidency and party leadership is necessary for political
stability.

   The Mormon Tabernacle Choir will perform in
the Soviet Union for the first time, during a concert tour of Europe
next summer, church officials announced.
   The 13-concert tour will open in Frankfurt, West Germany, on June
10, 1991, and conclude with three concerts in the Soviet Union, two
at the Kremlin in Moscow and one in Leningrad.
   The tour also will include the choir's first appearances in
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Austria.
   The tour schedule was announced Sunday by Gordon B. Hinckley, a
church president who serves as counselor to the governing body of
the 7.3 million-member Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   Hinckley said planning for the tour had taken more than two
years, and included negotiations with Yuri V. Dubinin, former
ambassador to the United States, who visited Salt Lake City in April.
   The choir, whose 320 volunteer members participate without pay as
a service to the church, has gained international renown through its
radio, television and satellite broadcasts, recordings and numerous
concert tours.

<TEXT>
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco told
new graduates of MIT, his alma mater, on Monday that the world of
the future belongs not to the generals but to the entrepreneurs.
   ``It seems that the long-running match between Karl Marx and Adam
Smith is finally coming to an end,'' said Barco.
   But the 68-year-old Barco also cautioned: ``Free market policies
should not be used as an excuse for the lack of political will,
whether it is assuring justice or fighting drug trafficking or
providing basic education and health care.
   ``Free market economics is not a magic wand which somehow will
relieve us of the obligation to care for our fellow human beings.''
   Barco's 25-minute address in English was the main speech to 1,712
degree recipients and 8,000 guests. He was interrupted repeatedly by
applause for his comments on human rights, the world's new and
still-fragile democracies and the environment.
   Barco received an engineering degree from MIT in 1943. A decade
later, he did graduate work in economics. From 1970 to 1980, he
served on the board that runs the school, the MIT Corporation.
   Barco finishes his four-year term in August and is to be
succeeded by Cesar Gaviria, who won election last month after a
campaign season that was scarred by vicious drug-related violence.
   Barco said he didn't want to talk only about drug violence. His
theme was more global.
   When the postwar world concentrated its attention on East-West
tensions and the contest for military advantage, he said, the
developed world ignored oppression in Latin America.
   ``We are now able to look beyond the myopia of the Cold War,
beyond our previously clouded horizon to where a new world is
waiting ... a world where entrepreneurs and innovators will lead the
way, not the generals of yesterday.''
   On Tuesday, Barco meets with President Bush. The two men are
expected to continue discussions that arose at February's anti-drug
summit in Cartagena, Colombia.

   Nancy Reagan and Raisa Gorbachev exchanged
smiles and handshakes today and renewed a relationship that Mrs.
Reagan said had been misunderstood.
   As former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev chatted on a sofa in the Soviet counsel general's home,
their wives perched on chairs and talked.
   Afterward, Mrs. Reagan characterized her hourlong meeting with
Mrs. Gorbachev as ``very nice.''
   ``I think there's been a great misunderstanding about our
relationship,'' Mrs. Reagan told reporters. She wore a black and
white outfit, while Mrs. Gorbachev had donned a more businesslike
gray suit.
   Mrs. Reagan's kind words for Mrs. Gorbachev contrasted with her
characterization of her in ``My Turn,'' her memoir of her White
House years.
   ``From the moment we met, she talked and talked and talked _ so
much that I could barely get a word in, edgewise or otherwise,''
Mrs. Reagan wrote. ``Perhaps it was insecurity on her part, but
during about a dozen encounters in three different countries, my
fundamental impression of Raisa Gorbachav was that she never stopped
talking.
   ``Or lecturing, to be more accurate,'' Mrs. Reagan wrote.
   And the last time Mrs. Gorbachev visited Washington before this
trip, in December 1987, she irritated Mrs. Reagan by observing that
the White House was more a museum than ``a regular house.''

<TEXT>
   A neurologist who plays the trumpet
wants to know why some people have perfect pitch and others can't
carry a tune in a bucket.
   ``It is talent, or it is teachable?'' asks Dr. Louis S. Russo
Jr., a member of the First Coast Pop Orchestra.
   He's looking for clues by studying a group of professional
musicians and a group of people who have never had a music lesson.
   ``As children, we develop language and grammar skills by
listening to our parents talk,'' said Russo. ``Why is it that people
develop these (music) skills long before they go to school, yet many
people can't even hum a tune? We all listen to music, even though we
all can't play it.''
   Russo first tested eight right-handed musicians with the
Jacksonville Symphony Orchestra. All were connected to a brain
mapping device and monitored while reading a magazine article,
sight-reading music, singing a simple song from memory and while
listening to Bach piano music.
   The brain maps showed when each musician read words, the left
part of the brain was activated. Research has shown language is
processed by the left side of the brain. The right side was
activated when they sang or listened to music.
   But when the musicians were asked to sight read a piece of music,
both sides of the brain began working.
   ``So the right side of the brain is necessary in all musical
functions, but the left side is activated as the functions become
more complex,'' he said.
   Seven people without musical training were given the same test.
And while Russo is still analyzing the results from that group, he
said preliminary examinations indicate that all the non-musicians
lack is training.
   ``Everyone can be taught to learn to read music,'' he said.

Hertfordshire, England, died Friday near South Arapaho Peak west of
Nederland, authorities said.
   Another exchange student, Paul Fretwell, 19, survived the storm
and managed to hike to safety the next day, said Boulder County
Sheriff's Lt. Les Trever. Fretwell's hometown wasn't known.
   Paddon died of head injuries and Choules of exposure, said Greg
Weisbrod, medical investigator for the county coroner's office.
Fretwell suffered minor injuries.
   A storm system that raked the state with rain and wind Friday
night also brought wind-whipped snow above 8,000 feet in some areas,
officials said.
   Paddon and Fretwell attended CU as exchange students from the
University of Lancaster in England, said Pauline Coker, CU
spokeswoman.

   Foreign ministers from 35 nations open
an East-West human rights conference Tuesday, hoping to rewrite the
ground rules in Europe so they protect ethnic minorities and
guarantee the rule of law.
   Backstage, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze will press ahead with talks on
Germany's future, picking up the thread from the weekend summit in
Washington.
   The month-long conference is likely to produce a final document
endorsing principles that just one year ago were out of reach: free
elections, pluralist politics, and freedom of speech, assembly and
religion.
   More radical proposals, such as establishing a committee to
mediate ethnic disputes and possibly a security force, are likely to
meet resistance.
   ``It is still too early to say if we can find a consensus. But
all governments now agree to move ahead'' toward a human rights
declaration, said Per Fergo, who heads the host delegation.
   The chief of the U.S. delegation, Max Kampelman, said in an
interview the conference will discuss creating a mechanism to
mediate disputes involving ethnic minorities. He gave as an example
complaints of discrimination by ethnic Hungarians living in Romania.
   Foreign ministers will meet in Copenhagen for two days.
Delegations led by senior diplomats will draft the final conference
document.
   The Copenhagen conference is an outgrowth of the 1975 Helsinki
Final Act, which reduced tensions in Europe and set minimum
standards of behavior by states toward their citizens.
   The 35 signatories of the Helsinki accords form the Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe. They are the United States,
Canada and all European nations except Albania, which now wants to
join.
   The first conference was held in Paris last June and ended
without a final document. The final meeting will be held in Moscow
in 1991.
   First on the agenda for the meeting of foreign ministers is
creating a committee that will prepare for a summit later this year.
All European nations except Bulgaria were sending foreign ministers.
   The Copenhagen conference takes place in a new Europe ripe for
agreement. It also comes as new pillars are being sought to support
a reshaped Europe. Many leaders look to the conference as the
foundation of the new structure.
   Baker and Shevardnadze were to continue talks on whether a
unified Germany can be a member of NATO. President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail S Gorbachev held extensive but inconclusive talks on
the German question in Washington.
   Gorbachev, fearful of a powerful Germany on the Soviet border
fully integrated into the Western military alliance, has said he
wants the issue discussed in a pan-European council, possibly
evolving from the Conference.
   The United States also has spoken of a wider monitoring role for
the international group.

   Police with rifles blocked roads to Beijing's
university area Monday and heavy security elsewhere in the city
stifled dissent on the first anniversary of the bloody demise of
China's democracy movement.
   All gates to Beijing University, a center of last year's
political activism, were locked at 8 p.m. The public was barred from
Tiananmen Square, the center of the protests, for the fourth day.
   The few individuals who tried to protest the military crackdown
were quickly arrested.
   Outside China, people from Mongolia to Paris and Czechoslovakia
remembered the anniversary with hunger strikes, marches and
candlelight vigils. The largest commemmoration was in Hong Kong,
where tens of thousands of people jammed Victoria Park and watched
videotapes of Chinese dissidents in exile urging people not to
forget the Beijing killings.
   In sharp contrast to the dramatic reforms of Eastern Europe in
the past year, China has retreated into ideological orthodoxy since
the June 3-4, 1989 crackdown. All students are required to take
courses in Marxism and Mao Tse-tung thought, and a clean political
record has become key to getting a good job or a passport.
   Thousands who participated in last year's uprising remain behind
bars, many without being charged or tried.
   Police set up roadblocks near universities in northwest Beijing
on Monday night and would not allow foreign journalists to pass. One
Western reporter saw three truckloads of riot police, armed with
shields and rifles, entering the university area.
   Security forces armed with AK-47 rifles patrolled outside Beijing
University. Plainclothes police, many with walkie-talkies, kept an
eye on students.
   For the third night, students smashed beer bottles _ ``bottle''
in Chinese sounds much like senior leader Deng Xiaoping's name. But
there was no repetition of the campus protest Sunday night that
attracted as many as 1,000 students.
   ``Nothing will happen tonight,'' one student said. ``It would
just be a repeat of last night and it would not be meaningful.
Yesterday was the time for it to happen.''
   It was on the night of June 3, 1989 that the People's Liberation
Army stormed Beijing, killing hundreds and perhaps thousands of
people on the way to ending the occupation of Tiananmen Square by
students pressing for reform.
   Beijing University students marched around campus Sunday night
singing The Internationale _ the anthem of the international
socialist movement which became a theme song during last year's
demonstrations.
   The one speaker at the rally, 21-year-old economics major Li
Minqi, disappeared Monday and was believed to be hiding.
   Several Western journalists were roughed up and briefly detained
by police during the protest. The State Department on Monday
denounced the action and said it had advised the Chinese government
``that such actions are clearly unacceptable.''
   A few candles burned in some graduate dormitories Monday night,
possibly in memory of those killed. Several people hooted and spat
out a dormitory window when a convoy of security drove by.
   The 100-acre Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center of China, is
usually open to the public, but it was surrounded by paramilitary
police.
   A man who tried to hand out leaflets at the gate of the Forbidden
City, across from the square, was quickly seized by police, foreign
witnesses said. Western reporters saw police drag off another
person, apparently a woman, near the square.
   Some students called for a hunger strike to mark the anniversary,
but it apparently did not take place. ``Some people said they'd get
drunk,'' one student said.
   A hunger strike in May last year began the occupation of
Tiananmen Square.
   Seven protesters outside the Chinese Embassy in Paris held a
36-hour hunger strike that was to end Monday night. ``I decided to
do something concrete for the anniversary, so that we won't forget
what happened, and that political prisoners in China may be
released,'' said Yvon Thomas, 19, who wore a headband with
``Freedom'' and ``Democracy'' written on it in Chinese.
   Another gathering was held outside the Chinese Embassy in Ulan
Bator, the capital of Mongolia, which has recently undergone
democratic changes after decades of Communist rule.
   Twenty Mongolian students staged a one-hour sit-in and tried to
deliver a petition to the embassy, but they were not allowed to, the
East German news agency ADN said. They left after pasting on the
mission's wall a poster condemning the June 4 bloodshed.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported late Monday that Beijing
was stable and life was normal on the anniversary.
   ``Millions of Beijing residents peacefully spent this Monday in
busy work and pleasant rest,'' it said.
   Xinhua reported the Sunday night protest but stressed that
Beijing campuses ``were in good order today, and quiet as usual.''
   The government continues to insist that the military crackdown
was justified, saying it faced a counterrevolutionary plot to
overthrow Communist Party rule.
   The party's official People's Daily said in a front-page
editorial Monday that the suppression of the democracy movement was
``absolutely correct and necessary.''
   It said that without resolute action against the demonstrators,
``China would be in great chaos now.''

   Americans gave $114.7 billion to charity in 1989,
a 10.43 percent increase over 1988, according to a report released
Monday.
   Religious groups got the biggest chunk _ $54.32 billion, the
AAFRC Trust for Philanthropy said.
   ``Once again, Americans demonstrated the centrality of
philanthropic giving not only to our culture but to our individual
lives,'' said the report.
   The increase in giving actually was 5.5 percent when adjusted for
inflation, said the trust, an arm of the American Association of
Fund-Raising Counsel.
   The group was founded more than 50 years ago to advance
philanthropy.
   Individual donations, which amounted to 84.1 percent of the
total, increased 11.67 percent over 1988 _ or 6.7 percent, when
adjusted for inflation. They totaled $96.43 billion.
   ``For every $5 we spent on food, we gave more than 80 cents,
almost $1, to a worthy cause,'' said the report. ``For every $2 we
spent on shoes and clothing, we gave $1 to philanthropy.''
   ``Clearly, these comparisons show that philanthropy is not
ancillary to our lives, not something we do on the side.'' it said.
   Part of the generosity was attributed to an 8.9 percent rise in
personal income. The report also said a 21.1 percent stock market
upswing in 1989 probably evoked bigger gifts from the affluent. It
also cited growing awareness of AIDS, homelessness, the environment
and other concerns, and intensified fund-raising efforts.
   Two natural disasters in 1989, the San Francisco earthquake and
Hurricane Hugo, generated an outpouring of financial aid. The
American Red Cross, for example, received $155 million for both
disasters, mostly from small, individual donations.
   In all, 1989 contributions saw $6.7 billion from foundations, up
8.93 percent, or 4 percent when adjusted for inflation; $6.57
billion from bequests, the same overall but down 4.5 percent in
inflation-adjusted dollars; and $5 billion for corporations, up 4.17
percent overall, but down 0.5 percent over 1988 in
inflation-adjusted dollars.
   Overall, 47.4 percent of the year's donations, or $54.32 billion,
went to houses of worship, religious organizations and the social
services they provide. That was up 12.95 percent from 1988, or 7.4
percent in inflation-adjusted dollars.
   Catholic Charities, a coalition of 700 social service agencies,
joined a trend that has grown among secular groups. It sponsored a
credit card called ``Caritas''; one-half percent of each purchase
price is earmarked as a donation.
   In addition to religious groups, donations were divided among:
   _Human services, $11.39 billion, up 8.58 percent, or 3.7 percent
when adjusted for inflation.
   _Education, $10.69 billion, up 4.49 percent, or ``a slight drop''
when adjusted.
   _Health, $10.04 billion, up 4.8 percent, or 0.1 percent when
adjusted.
   _Arts, culture and humanities, $7.49 billion, up 10.31 percent,
or 5.4 percent when adjusted.
   _Public and society benefits _ including the environment, traffic
safety, animal rights, urban and rural development, and countless
other categories _ $3.62 billion, up 12.77 percent, or 7.7 percent
when adjusted.
   _All other uses, including overseas services, $17.13 billion, up
10.8 percent, or 5.9 percent when adjusted.
   It was the fourth consecutive year that corporate giving did not
keep pace with the rising costs faced by non-profit organizations.
   Conversely, the report said that Japanese corporations ``showed a
growing interest during 1989 in fostering their own philanthropic
efforts in this country.'' No figures were cited, however.
   A majority of the contributions from American corporations is
earmarked for education. Now, that money is increasingly benefiting
children and alternative education programs, rather than colleges.
   In 1988, 64 percent of all corporate education donations went to
colleges and universities, compared with about 70 percent in 1988.
   In 1989, Coca-Cola, General Electric, IBM and RJR Nabisco
announced education grants that will total $130 million over the
next decade. They place heavy emphasis on elementary and secondary
schooling, and higher education for minorities.

   There was more drama off-camera than on at the
1990 Tony Awards, although ``The Grapes of Wrath'' was the upset
winner for best play over ``The Piano Lesson.''
   The flap occurred during a commercial break at the televised
award show when producer Joseph Cates blasted presenter Ron Silver
for his lengthy defense of the embattled National Endowment for the
Arts and for his remembrance of the massacre in Beijing one year ago.
   ``I support the NEA,'' Cates explained to the black tie audience
at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater, but added: ``To take advantage of a
live TV show like that does us all incredible harm. This is not the
show on which to make those comments.''
   Cates' comments were met with scattered boos and some applause by
theatergoers.
   If ``The Piano Lesson,'' which had won the Pulitzer Prize and the
New York Drama Critics Circle Award, was Sunday evening's biggest
loser, ``City of Angels'' was the biggest winner. It took home six
awards including best musical. The show also won for actor-musical,
James Naughton; score, Cy Coleman and David Zippel; book, Larry
Gelbart; featured actress-musical, Randy Graff, set design, Robin
Wagner.
   ``The Grapes of Wrath'' only won two honors, including a
directing award for Frank Galati, but they were important prizes.
What counts in terms of box office is the best play award, and the
honor should help business at the stage adaptation of John
Steinbeck's epic novel about Depression-era Okies. Until now, the
play has been doing respectable but not sell-out business.
   Other highlights:
   _Best speech: Tommy Tune's second Tony of the night, a prize for
his direction of ``Grand Hotel.'' The lanky Tune strode to the
stage, smiled, waved at the audience and walked off. He also picked
up a Tony for the show's choreography. Tune has won seven Tonys
during a Broadway career that has brought him prizes in four
different categories, actor-musical, featured actor-musical,
director-musical and choreography, a Tony record.
   _Worst speech: Tyne Daly's rambling thank you in which she kept
reminding the audience that she only had 30 seconds in which to
speak and then proceeded to ignore her own time limit for several
minutes. Daly won the actress-musical award for her portrayal of
Mama Rose in a revival of ``Gypsy.''
   _Most emotional speech _ Michael Jeter's tearful plea, ``If you
have got a problem with alcohol and drugs and you can't stop and
think life can't change and dreams can't come true, I stand here as
living proof that you can stop,'' he said in accepting the featured
actor award-musical for ``Grand Hotel.'' ``It changes a day at a
time and dreams come true.''
   _Wittiest speech: Charles Durning, who picked up the supporting
actor prize for his portrayal of Big Daddy in a revival of ``Cat on
a Hot Tin Roof.'' Saying he didn't deserve the award, he added,
``but I don't deserve arthritis either.''
   _The evening's strangest omissions: No mention during the
telecast of Rex Harrison, the debonair star of ``My Fair Lady,'' who
died at age 82 Saturday, one day before the Tonys show. And the
closing of ``A Chorus Line'' didn't rate a footnote even though the
final performance of Broadway's longest running show on April 28 was
one of the highlights of the season.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on
Monday defended the right of Soviet Jews to live in Israeli-occupied
territory, saying a democracy could not limit where people live.
   Shamir was reacting to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
comment Sunday that he may limit Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel
if the immigrants settle on land seized from Jordan and Egypt.
   Speaking to Israeli manufacturers in Tel Aviv, the right-wing
Shamir said his government's policy is to allow Jews to live
anywhere in Israel, including the occupied West Bank, Gaza Strip and
east Jerusalem.
   ``If the Soviet Union of President Gorbachev does not consider
itself empowered today to dictate to its citizens where to live...
it's as clear as the sun that we, educated by democracy and freedom,
cannot impose limitations on this or another category of settlers in
the state of Israel,'' he said.
   ``We shall not create ghettos and areas of residence in this
country,'' Shamir added.
   In the West Bank settlement of Ariel, Michael Klimovitsky, a
recent arrival from Leningrad, supported Shamir's statements.
   ``Israel is a free country. It's not the Soviet Union, thank God.
In this country, a man has to decide for himself where he will
live,'' the 25-year-old computer programmer said.
   Ariel officials estimate that 200 Soviet immigrants have moved to
the settlement. It is 10 miles southeast of Nablus, the West Bank's
largest city and a focal point of the Palestinian uprising against
Israeli rule.
   Shimon Peres, head of the center-left Labor party and Shamir's
strongest political rival, said Gorbachev's statement was a result
of the government's failure to move toward a peace settlement with
the Palestinians.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
doubted the Soviet president would carry out his threat.
   ``We're not sure what President Gorbachev meant by his
comments,'' Ms. Tutwiler said a day after the Soviet leader ended
his summit with President Bush.
   ``Nothing that was said during the private summit discussions
indicated in any way that the Soviets won't live up to their
commitments to permit Soviet Jewish emigration,'' she said. ``We
expect that they will continue to do so. They know how very
important this is to us.''
   In all, Israeli officials said, fewer than 300 of the 40,000
Soviet Jews who have arrived in Israel this year have moved to the
West Bank and Gaza. This figure does not include an estimated 3,200
Soviet immigrants living in annexed areas of Jerusalem.
   Explaining his threat to limit immigration, Gorbachev said he was
under intense pressure from Arab nations, which fear settlement of
Soviet Jews on occupied land will displace Palestinians. Currently,
1.7 million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza Strip along
with 70,000 Jewish settlers.
   Immigration is at an all-time high as a result of relaxed Soviet
restrictions, and as many as 150,000 Soviet Jews are expected to
arrive by the end of the year. About 1 million Soviets are seeking
permission to emigrate.
   Ariel is home to about 8,000 Jewish residents.
   Simcha Dinitz, head of the quasi-governmental Jewish Agency,
which helps immigrants, said that since April 1989, some 285 Soviet
Jews have moved to the occupied territories.
   Dinitz's figure on those living in the occupied lands excludes
the Soviets who have moved to a ring of Jewish suburbs around Arab
east Jerusalem on war-won land that Israel annexed.
   Most Western nations do not recognize Israeli sovereignty over
the area, and earlier this year President Bush said he viewed
Jerusalem's Jewish suburbs as part of the occupied areas.
   Neighborhood council officials in the suburbs that have taken the
bulk of the Soviet immigrants told The Associated Press at least 940
Soviet families, or an estimated 3,200 people, have moved into the
areas in the wave of immigration that began in spring 1989.
   The four suburbs involved are Pisgat Zeev, Neve Yaacov, Gilo and
Ramot.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said the future of Soviet trade with
the United States could hinge on the treatment of Soviet Jews and
that this could determine whether Gorbachev carries through on his
threat.
   ``The Soviet Union knows that the trade agreement it signed with
the U.S. is conditional on free emigration from the U.S.S.R., and it
is very hard to imagine that the process initiated by Gorbachev in
the Soviet Union, with perestroika and free exit being integral
parts of this process, would undergo some change,'' he said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III headed
for Copenhagen Monday to take up a nine-point Western plan on
Germany's military future with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze. The plan would allow the Red Army to keep troops in
East Germany for now.
   Shevardnadze, in Copenhagen, said that no quick agreement was
likely and that the matter should eventually be taken to a broader
meeting of European nations.
   The U.S. goal is to induce the Soviets to drop their objections
to NATO membership for the new and stronger Germany that will emerge
when East Germany is combined with West Germany.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev registered his concerns
about the Soviets' mighty neighbor and onetime deadly foe in his
summit talks here with President Bush.
   They parted agreeing to disagree, but with the Soviet leader also
saying he had surveyed some ``new possible perspectives'' with Bush.
   Now Baker intends to flesh them out with Shevardnadze while they
are attending a conference on human rights, said U.S. officials, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Baker also will confer in the Danish capital with West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the innovative diplomat who
originated many of the ideas.
   The Western plan includes a lowering of NATO`s military profile
as East-West tensions subside and an acceleration of negotiations to
ban short-range nuclear weapons in both alliances.
   Also, the officials said, Soviet troops could remain in what is
now East German territory for some time, the West Germans would help
Gorbachev with his herculean program to pep up the Soviet economy
and the new Germany would affirm its intention to acquire neither
nuclear nor chemical weapons.
   NATO forces would not be deployed in the East German area; the
European Security Conference would be strengthened and NATO and the
Warsaw Pact would negotiate deeper cuts in troops and non-nuclear
weapons once current reduction talks in Vienna produce a treaty, the
officials told The Associated Press.
   Additionally, Baker said on Sunday that the two alliances might
exchange a political statement of assurances.
   As Baker was leaving Washington, Shevardnadze was asked about the
U.S. plan in Copenhagen.
   ``I wouldn't say that we agreed with the Americans on all
things,'' he said. ``I couldn't say it (an agreement) will be
possible already here. We didn't pretend. It is very difficult to
find a solution on the external parts of the German unity.''
   Shevardnadze said any accord over Germany's military future
should be presented to a pan-European meeting, and officials in
Copenhagen said the foreign ministers' meeting will plan
preparations for a November meeting of the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
   In Washington, a U.S. official said, ``We've had the broad
philosophical discussion at the summit,'' a U.S. official said.
``Our effort now is to try to engage them on the specifics.''
   Basically, the official said, Baker is approaching Shevardnadze
this way: Tell us what your concerns are and we'll try to find a way
of meeting them.
   But, the official said, the Bush administration would not agree
to ``discriminatory limitations on a unified Germany,''
   After the Copenhagen sessions, Baker and the 15 other NATO
foreign ministers, including Genscher, will take up the difficult
German problem again Thursday at a meeting of the North Atlantic
Council in Turnberry, Scotland.
   The human rights conference and the meeting of the Western allies
were already scheduled before Bush and Gorbachev held their four-day
summit, which ended Sunday in Washington.
   But the Bush-Gorbachev dispute over Germany's military future
gave Baker's trip extra significance. Baker plans to meet with
Shevardnadze and Genscher again, in Berlin, later in the month.
   ``We'll keep wrestling with it,'' Baker said Sunday.
   Gorbachev, for his part, declared at the summit windup: ``I
cannot say that we have reached agreement, but that does not mean
that our efforts were futile. Many new arguments emerged as a result
of these discussions, and new possible perspectives.''
   ``We will continue our discussion in order to find a mutually
acceptable solution,'' Gorbachev said.
   Gorbachev has repeatedly insisted that a unified Germany not be
aligned with NATO. He argues that in an era of democratic change,
his own people see the alliance as an anti-Soviet remnant of the
Cold War.
   Having lost more than 20 million people to Nazi Germany in World
War II, and with the East European allies now a less reliable
buffer, Gorbachev is anxious about being confronted by a stronger
Germany.
   Bush, however, at a joint news conference with the Soviet leader,
said having Germany in NATO ``would be stabilizing.''

<HEAD>Monarch Has Pneumonia After Paralyzing Stroke</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Norway's 86-year-old King Olav V, partially
paralyzed by a stroke over the weekend, has developed pneumonia,
doctors said Monday.
   The world's oldest reigning monarch suffered the stroke Saturday
while in the Oslo's Rikshospitalet. Doctors called his condition
``unsafe.''
   Earlier Monday, they said the paralysis of his left side improved
slightly but they warned of ``an approaching infection of his
lungs.'' A later statement said it was pneumonia.
   Well-wishers in Norway, a constitutional monarchy, sent a flood
of flowers, telegrams and letters to the popular monarch, often
called ``The People's King,'' said the palace in a statement.
   The king formally installs the prime minister and Cabinet but has
no real political power.
   Churches throughout Norway included prayer for Olav in services
Monday.
   Crown Prince Harald, in line to succeed Olav, stayed with his
father during the weekend. All members of the royal family visited
the king Sunday and Monday. His oldest daughter, Princess Ragnhild,
flew in from her home in Brazil Monday, despite having influenza.
   Olav had been hospitalized last Tuesday for treatment of a mild
infection of his pericardium, a membraneous sac surrounding the
heart. The stroke came one day after Olav was advised to remain in
the hospital for observation through the weekend.
   King Olav, who has ruled Norway since 1957, became the world's
oldest reigning monarch when Japan's Emperor Hirohito died in
January last year at age 87.
   A 1928 Olympic gold medalist in yatching, King Olav spent his
86th birthday last July sailing in an Oslo regatta aboard his
18-foot sailboat. He last sailed in the Oslo fjord a few weeks ago.
   
   Polls regularly rank Olav as Norway's best-liked person. About 90
percent of the 4.2 million people in this egalitarian welfare state
still favor the monarchy, according to surveys.
   
   Queen Martha, his Swedish-born cousin and wife, died in 1954. He
never remarried.
   
   The Norwegian king, born Prince Alexander Edward Christian
Fredrik of Denmark, was two years old when Norway left its union
with Sweden in 1905 to become an independent monarchy. His father,
Danish Prince Carl, took the name King Haakon VII when he was
invited to take the Norwegian throne.

   Two British lawmakers said Monday they were refused
entry into China and left stranded on the China-Macao border after
their tour bus continued on without them.
   The incident Sunday coincided with the first anniversary of
China's suppression of a pro-democracy movement.
   The lawmakers, Brian Sedgemore and Dale Campbell-Savours, both
members of the opposition Labor Party, said they would complain to
the British and Chinese governments.
   Sedgemore said the two had planned to go sightseeing after an
official visit to Hong Kong when they arrived at China's border with
Macao, a tiny Portuguese colony.
   ``To the astonishment of those traveling with us, we were forced
to leave our bus and were left stranded by the roadside on the
border'' with Macao, he said. ``This was despite the fact that we
had been told that we were on a group visa.''
   He said the two believe they were stopped because Chinese
authorities believed they might become involved in protests of the
anniversary of the crackdown.

<HEAD>Ford Says Baltic Problems Will Persist Despite Bush-Gorbachev
Friendship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The future of the Baltic republics will
continue to be a thorny U.S.-Soviet issue despite a beneficial
personal bond forged between President Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev,
former President Gerald Ford said Monday.
   ``I believe a personal relationship that is based on good faith,
understanding and kindliness makes a major difference in trying to
resolve some of these international problems,'' Ford told the
National Press Club.
   ``It's my judgment that President Bush and Mr. Gorbachev have
established that kind of rapport, and it would be my estimate that
it will pay dividends and benefits in the months ahead,'' he said in
a question-and-answer session with club members and guests.
   Ford also was asked whether he believed the Soviet economic
embargo of Lithuania, in retaliation for its March 11 declaration of
independence, would continue to be an obstacle to a U.S. grant of
most favored nation trading status to the Soviet Union.
   ``The problem of the Baltic nations _ Estonia and Latvia and
Lithuania _ is going to be a very difficult one for Mr. Gorbachev to
solve, and it will be a continuing problem between the government of
the United States and the Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Bush announced during the superpower summit that ended Sunday in
Washington that he would grant most favored nation status to the
Soviet Union if Moscow drops restrictions on emigration.
   But Bush made no mention of Lithuania. The agreement is subject
to approval by Congress.
   The United States has never recognized the incorporation of the
Baltic states into the Soviet Union after the Hitler-Stalin pact
during World War II.
   ``Our position today has to be consistent with that point of
view, and that of course is not reconcilable with Mr. Gorbachev's
problems,'' Ford said.
   The former president said he believed the United States should be
``somewhat understanding of what Mr. Gorbachev faces and how he can
handle it'' and give him ``time, in a reasonable sense'' to seek a
solution.
   As to the trade proposal, Ford said, ``The Congress, very likely,
will try to roadblock it. Whether they can or not, whether the votes
are there, I am not in a position to assess that at the moment.''
   Ford spoke after presenting the annual $5,000 Gerald R. Ford
journalism awards, sponsored by the Gerald R. Ford Foundation.
Gerald Seib of the Wall Street Journal received the award for
reporting on the presidency and Debra Polsky of Defense News was
recognized for reporting about defense issues.

<HEAD>Soviet Human Rights Abuses Still at High Level, Group Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite reforms that have won Mikhail S. Gorbachev
praise and admiration in the West, human rights abuses still abound
in the Soviet Union, a monitoring group said Monday.
   Freedom of religion, the press and emigration remain restricted;
there are as many as 188 alleged political prisoners; and refugees
from ethnic strife in various Soviet republics are forced to live in
miserable conditions, according to the International Helsinki
Federation for Human Rights.
   The group, meeting in Moscow for the first time in its eight-year
history, said it encountered no harassment or intimidation during
two days of hearings.
   But its chairman, Karl J. von Schwarzenberg, said it was denied
access to a psychiatric institute after insisting upon bringing
along Soviet human rights activists who were members of the
federation.
   ``They declined to see us, telling us our Russian members are
insane,'' von Schwarzenberg said, ``which was a remarkable
statement, I must say.''
   The federation will present its formal report on human rights in
the Soviet Union at a meeting of the 35-nation Conference on
Security and Cooperation in Europe that opens Tuesday in Copenhagen.
   The meeting is an outgrowth of the 1975 Helsinki Final Act.
Moscow will be the host next year for another such gathering, and
the federation's members viewed the weekend meetings as a test to
see whether it was possible to meet and talk about human rights in
the Soviet Union.
   ``We are not satisfied with the conditions as they exist now,''
said David Matas, a chairman of the Canadian Helsinki Committee,
when asked about the prospects for a successful 1991 meeting in
Moscow.
   But Nikolai Uspensky of the Soviet Foreign Ministry told a
separate news conference Monday that ``there is no opposition to
holding this meeting in Moscow.''
   ``At the same time, I must say that at the very beginning,
Americans and the British were cool and reluctant to hold such a
meeting in Moscow because they were afraid they would be unable to
maintain the standard of such a conference,'' Uspensky said. ``Well,
they have no doubts now.''
   Irwin Cotler, a law professor at McGill University in Montreal
and a chairman of the Canadian committee, illustrated how far the
Soviet Union had come by noting that longtime dissident Lev
Timofeyev presided at Monday's news conference for the Helsinki
federation. At a human rights meeting in 1988, Timofeyev was not
allowed to speak.
   The federation said the human rights abuses that exist today are
left over from the days before Gorbachev's reforms but added: ``The
abuses nonetheless remain at such a high level to be a cause for
great concern.''
   The federation noted there are between 50 and 188 identified
cases of alleged political prisoners and noted the case of Mikhail
Kazachkov of Leningrad, who was arrested in 1975 on charges of
treason after applying to emigrate.
   Cotler said Kazachkov has been denied the right to counsel, has
been allowed only three visits from his 88-year-old mother in 14
years, and has spent five years in solitary confinement. Kazachkov
has been given such harsh treatment, he said, because he has stood
up for the rights of political prisoners and because he is a Jew.
   ``While people are no longer imprisoned for anti-Soviet
propaganda alone, they are convicted of crimes of hooliganism for
apparent political activities,'' the federation said.
   It also said there was concern about continued detention through
abuse of psychiatry.
   Turning to the press, the federation said independent newspapers
cannot buy newsprint, use printing presses or distribute via kiosks
and have had their offices burglarized and ransacked.
   It noted what it called ``severe restrictions'' on freedom of
religion, saying the ``leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church is
in effect appointed by the Communist government.'' It also said the
state has taken property from the Ukrainian Catholic Church, which
was banned by Stalin, and that there is no legal way to return it.

<HEAD>State Officials Banter Over Tennessee Tax on Maine Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A letter from Tennessee officials
suggesting that Maine's Taxation Bureau may be subject to a new
Tennessee tax touched off a tongue-in-cheek debate over taxes and
tourism.
   The form letter from the Tennessee Revenue Department was
accompanied by a summary of the law imposing the tax on out-of-state
financial institutions that do business in Tennessee. Lawmakers
there enacted the measure this year.
   ``Financial institutions which you represent or with which you
are associated in some way, may be subject to taxation under the
act,'' reads the letter received by the Maine Taxation Bureau last
month.
   Maine State Tax Assessor John D. LaFaver realized that the tax
bureau itself could not be taxed by another state, but the
temptation to respond to Tennessee Revenue Commissioner Joe
Huddleston proved irresistible.
   ``If you have found a way to tax other states' revenue
departments, I would like to know what the secret is,'' LaFaver
wrote. He noted that Maine and other New England states were forced
to pare spending substantially this year because of an unanticipated
economic slump.
   ``Maybe we could claim that any state whose residents eat Maine
lobsters or consume our famous potatoes or enjoy our unsurpassed
scenery and hospitality would have their taxation departments
contribute their fair share to supporting the state that makes all
that possible.''
   Huddleston said Monday the letter was sent to Maine officials to
inform them about the law. ``It was not necessarily asking the Maine
department to register'' to pay the tax, he said in a telephone
interview from Nashville.
   Huddleston took good-natured issue with LaFaver's assertion that
Maine's scenery is unsurpassed, saying he was ``more than willing to
put our scenery up against Maine's.''

<HEAD>Health Care is Biggest Threat at Bargaining Table</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spiraling health care costs _ labor and
management's biggest sticking point in collective bargaining _ are
forcing companies nationwide to take extraordinary steps such as
setting up their own medical clinics or physician networks.
   Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., for instance, has three medical
clinics at plants in Oklahoma, Ohio and Alabama where workers can
visit a physician, eye doctor or pharmacist for $15. Follow-up
visits are $5.
   ``There are two ways to go _ decrease benefits and jack up
premiums for workers or find a better and cheaper way,'' says
consultant Victor Williams.
   More than a dozen Fortune 500 companies have called Williams in
the past year inquiring about Goodyear's experience in the medical
business, he said.
   Goodyear estimates it saves $1 million a year on its $163 million
health care bill. ``It just scratches the surface, but it helps,''
said spokesman Bob Mercer.
   Employees benefit as well, said J.R. Countryman of the United
Rubber Workers, which represents Goodyear workers in Alabama. ``It
sure has cut down on our costs,'' he said.
   But not all management efforts to trim health care costs are
being embraced by workers.
   In fact, union workers nationwide increasingly find themselves
trying to fend off management efforts to shift health care costs to
workers; the issue was at the heart of 78 percent of the strikes
waged last year by unions, according to one study.
   Most recently, a two-year battle to resolve health care costs in
the railroad industry proved unsuccessful _ last month President
Bush was forced to appoint an emergency board to try and prevent a
strike.
   In that dispute, the major railroads _ which for decades have
provided workers with a solid, low-cost health care package _ wanted
the 235,000 brakemen, engineers and other workers who keep the
nation's freight system moving to pay higher deductibles and make
payroll contributions.
   ``Then they have to think twice because it's not something
someone else is going to pay for 100 percent,'' said Charles
Hopkins, chairman of the National Railway Labor Conference, which
represents management in the dispute.
   Union officials contend shifting health care costs to workers
does little to solve a greater problem that merits Congress'
attention _ how to rein in runaway medical costs.
   ``To try to pin the blame on some poor worker worried about their
kid in the middle of the night is really outrageous,'' said Bob
Master of the Communications Workers of America, which fought a
health care battle for telephone workers in the Northeast last year.
   Hopkins said management has no choice but to try to shift part of
the burden to workers because ``we are being consumed by the cost of
our so-called fringe benefits.''
   Besides trying to shift premium costs to workers, companies are
also moving to restrict a worker's right to choose a doctor. Some
also are auditing patients' bills.
   Many companies are now setting up ``preferred provider
arrangements,'' medical networks that provide services to workers at
a negotiated price. Often, employers provide financial incentives
for workers to use the PPO rather than their own family doctor.
   Other companies, such as Florida Power &amp; Light, are hiring nurses
to visit hospitals to audit patients' bills to make sure money isn't
being wasted. The effort, said spokesman Michael Millhorn, is an
attempt to save money without hurting workers.
   ``We don't want to mess with the level of benefits if we can
avoid it,'' Millhorn said.
   Paul O'Neill, chairman of ALCOA, the Aluminum Company of America,
told a House panel recently that he didn't feel comfortable
intervening in workers' medical care decisions.
   O'Neill noted that employers do not have a say in what type of
car or food a worker buys.
   ``Yet here I am in the middle of personal medical care,'' he said.
   Union leaders, who have long been pushing for some type of
national health care system, hope the problems will lead business to
join them in supporting health care reform, rather than merely
trying to pass costs on to workers.
   ``That's simply a blame-the-victim strategy that may look good in
the short term and for the balance sheet. But what we should be
saying is, `Hey, let's try to get a permanent solution to this
problem,''' said Karen Ignagni, the AFL-CIO's expert on health care.
   According to a study by the Service Employees International
Union, workers' out-of-pocket expenses for health care grew faster
than wages from 1986 to 1989.
   The biggest increase was in employee contributions to premiums
for family health coverage, which rose from $14.30 to $24.12. If
current trends continue, the study found, health insurance premiums
will consume 27 percent of take-home pay by 1998.
   ``It's a national problem and must be addressed nationally,''
AFL-CIO president Lane Kirkland said recently.
   Ignagni and other union leaders said government involvement is
crucial because there's a limit to how creative labor and management
can be at reducing health care costs. For instance, she said, little
can be done at the bargaining table to bring down the cost of a $900
hospital room.
   ``The lesson of the '90s is that there is a limit to what you can
do to change the slope of the curve,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday barred Connecticut
officials from pressing drunken-driving charges against a man
acquitted of manslaughter in a fatal traffic accident.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the second
prosecution would violate the motorist's double-jeopardy
constitutional rights.
   The justices ruled in a similar case May 29. By a 5-4 vote, they
said a New York man who pleaded guilty to drunken driving and
related traffic offenses in a fatal car crash may not be prosecuted
later for homicide and assault.
   In the case acted on Monday, John Lonergan was driving a car in
Hartford on May 22, 1985, when he collided with a motorcycle driven
by Scott Sementilli.
   Sementilli died the next day from his injuries.
   Longeran was charged with manslaughter and driving while
intoxicated, and the state decided to try him only on the
manslaughter count. A judge ruled that the state had failed to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that Lonergan's alleged intoxication
caused Sementilli's death, and ordered Lonergan acquitted.
   State prosecutors then sought to try Lonergan for driving under
the influence of liquor. But a judge threw out the prosecution; that
ruling was upheld by the Connecticut Supreme Court last year.
   The state court said retrying Lonergan would violate the
Constitution's ban on multiple prosecutions for the same crime.
   ``The record clearly indicates that in the second prosecution for
operating while under the influence the state will rely on and seek
to prove the same act of operating while intoxicated that was
necessary to prove the manslaughter charge in the first
prosecution,'' the state court said.
   The case is Connecticut vs. Lonergan, 89-1295.

   Raisa Gorbachev and Nancy Reagan renewed old
acquaintances Monday, and anyone expecting a sudden frost in San
Francisco saw only warmth instead.
   As Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev chatted for an hour on a
sofa at the at the home of the Soviet consul general, their wives
talked nearby.
   ``Very nice,'' Mrs. Reagan said afterward.
   She denied suggestions that she and Mrs. Gorbachev once were
uncomfortable with each other: ``I think there's been a great
misunderstanding about our relationship,'' she said.
   ``It was a very different time,'' Mrs. Reagan said. ``We were
plowing new ground.''
   There was no sign of the irritation that Mrs. Reagan betrayed in
December 1987, when the visiting Mrs. Gorbachev observed that the
White House was more a museum than ``a regular house.''
   And there was no repetition of Mrs. Reagan's complaints, in her
book ``My Turn,'' that Mrs. Gorbachev ``never stopped talking. Or
lecturing, to be more accurate.''
   The morning meeting was the start of an eventful day for the wife
of the Soviet leader. A whirlwind tour of the city was planned,
whisking her past the War Memorial Opera House, Davis Symphony Hall
and other sights. Fisherman's Wharf also was on the itinerary, along
with a stop at the Bank of America tower.
   Mrs. Gorbachev's tour of the city was to be escorted by Tatyana
Kamenev, wife of the Soviet consul general. The wife of Mayor Art
Agnos, Sherry Agnos, also was expected to join them.
   Mrs. Gorbachev has earned respect on her own, said Patricia
Montandon, who was to visit with Mrs. Gorbachev at a Friends of
Raisa gathering after the tour. The group includes women who have
met Mrs. Gorbachev on trips to the Soviet Union to promote peace.
   ``She has a mind of her own. ... She's not just a supporter of
her husband, she's in partnership with him,'' said Montandon.
   One tourist attraction _ the Golden Gate Bridge _ was saved for
the end of the day. The Gorbachevs were scheduled to meet there just
prior to their departure for home.

   Jury selection began Monday in Mayor Marion
Barry's drug and perjury trial as Barry accused prosecutors of
pursuing him with the tactics of ``a totalitarian kind of society.''
   The mayor, accompanied by his wife Effi, went to the U.S.
Courthouse as the first of two groups of 125 potential jurors filled
out questionnaires designed to uncover any bias for or against him.
   Two of Barry's security guards and several businessmen who have
benefited from city city contracts are among those included on a
list of potential witnesses, according to the questionnaires. The
trial is expected to last about a month.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 charges of cocaine
possession, three counts of lying to a grand jury and one count of
conspiracy. The three charges of lying are felonies.
   Sources close to the case have said Barry's lawyers have been
conducting plea bargain talks with federal prosecutors, but one
source said the two sides are at an impasse.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens ``wants the mayor to plead to a
felony, but that's not likely to happen,'' said a city official who
spoke only on condition of anonymity. Barry is willing to consider
pleading guilty only to misdemeanors, the official said.
   If Barry were jailed on a felony conviction or guilty plea, he
would be barred from holding office or running for re-election to a
fourth four-year term this November.
   ``Since 1983, my family have had to go through my mail being
opened, my bank accounts checked, my tax return looked at, my phones
tapped,'' Barry said in an interview with radio station WOL.
   ``You can't even have a conference in your bedroom with your wife
for fear that they're listening to anything you may say,'' he added.
``It's been a thing that you thought may happen in a totalitarian
kind of society.''
   The mayor also said a local television station had obtained from
prosecutors a copy of the FBI videotape that sources close to the
case say shows Barry smoking crack cocaine in a hotel room Jan. 18.
   ``They're trying to figure out now how to show it,'' he said.
   Judy Smith, spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Stephens, said
prosecutors would not comment on that. The station, WRC-TV, also
said it would have no comment.
   On the list of 48 names of possible witnesses were Charles Lewis
and Rasheeda Moore as well as Barry security guards James Stays and
Fred Gaskins.
   Lewis, in a plea agreement involving drug charges against
himself, testified last November that he supplied Barry with crack
cocaine. Moore, a former model, persuaded Barry to come to the hotel
room where he was arrested.
   The questionnaires ask whether potential jurors think lying while
under oath is justifiable.
   Barry has acknowledged he suffers from alcoholism, and the
potential panelists were asked whether they think that could be used
to excuse criminal activity.
   The questionaire also included a section asking the respondents
to give their feelings about undercover sting operations, the method
used to produce Barry's arrest. In addition, they were asked whether
they thought the case agains the mayor was racially or politically
motivated.
   Barry supporters and opponents gathered outside the courthouse as
efforts began to select 12 jurors and six alternates.
   Two dozen Guardian Angels, a self-styled anti-crime group,
carried signs demanding Barry's resignation. They were taunted by
several Barry supporters who said the black mayor was the victim of
racially motivated prosecution and had been entrapped by
investigators.
   ``If anyone should be on trial it should be (U.S. Attorney)
Stephens,'' said Florence Smith of the National Welfare Rights
Organization.
   Barry attended a church rally Sunday night and called the months
since his Jan. 18 arrest ``the most difficult time in my life.''
   ``I ain't gonna waste time,'' Barry said. ``I've come too far
from where I started from.'' After a standing ovation from the
crowd, he expressed confidence that his legal crisis will not bring
him down.
   While Barry has said he needs only one juror to vote against
convicting him, some of his top aides and political advisers have
indicated they are extremely reluctant to see the case come to trial.

<HEAD>Actor Corey Feldman Pleads Innocent to Drug Counts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Actor Corey Feldman pleaded innocent Monday to
four felony drug charges.
   Feldman, 18, entered his plea before a Superior Court judge who
set a pretrial hearing for July 9.
   The actor was charged with possession of heroin for sale,
transportation of heroin, possession of cocaine and transportation
of heroin, said Deputy District Attorney Peter Cagney. Feldman
remains free on $5,000 bail.
   Feldman was arrested March 9 after police allegedly found the
narcotics in his car during a downtown traffic stop. Police said 25
balloons of heroin and cocaine were in his car.
   The actor starred in such films as ``Stand By Me,'' ``The
Goonies,'' ``Dream a Little Dream'' and ``The 'burbs.''
   During a court appearance in April, Feldman read a statement
urging children to stay away from drugs.

   The headlines proclaimed, ``Gorbachevs wow
Twin Cities crowds,'' and Gov. Rudy Perpich declared he'd had one of
the best days of his life when the Soviet leader came to town.
   ``It was almost scary things went off so well,'' said State
Patrol Chief Kevin Kittridge, who spent most of Sunday in a
helicopter hovering over the motorcade and visit sites.
   ``It was as perfect as any trip I've ever seen,'' chief Minnesota
advanceman Paul Ridgeway said Monday.
   Ridgeway said he could not estimate the cost of the Gorbachevs'
visit, but Minnesota businesses are footing most of the bill. ``I'll
tell you, whatever it was it was worth it, because it showcased
Minnesota in the best light,'' Ridgeway said.
   The Star Tribune and the Saint Paul Pioneer Press published
special sections Monday, recounting in thousands of words and dozens
of pictures the seven hectic hours that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, spent Sunday on Minnesota soil.
   ``From a `summit of hope' to a Summit Av. welcome,'' proclaimed
the Star Tribune over a full, front-page color photograph showing
the Gorbachevs waving to onlookers from the steps of the governor's
mansion in St. Paul.
   ``Gorbachevs wow Twin Cities crowds,'' the Pioneer Press said.
   The pictures and words likely were familiar to any Minnesotan who
wasn't on one of the state's 10,000 lakes fishing Sunday. Twin
Cities television and radio stations carried the visit live from
Gorbachev's airport arrival at 1:38 p.m. through his 8:38 p.m.
departure for San Francisco.
   In between were a luncheon with Perpich and his wife, Lola, at
the governor's mansion on Summit Avenue, impromptu forays into
crowds of delighted people lining the motorcade route, Gorbachev's
address to business and agricultural leaders, his talk with
employees at Control Data Corp., and Mrs. Gorbachev's visit with a
Minneapolis family and unscheduled stops at a drugstore and Mexican
food shop.
   Except for the weather, windy and wet with temperatures in the
40s, the only hitch was caused when time constraints canceled a
visit to a farm south of the Twin Cities.
   ``It was a great, great day, one of the best days of my life,''
Perpich said Monday on ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``I think the world is better off because of his visit to
Minnesota,'' Perpich said late Sunday night. ``I think he has a
better feeling about the U.S. because of the visit, the warmth of
the people.
   ``I've never seen any reception like that for a political
figure,'' he added. ``You're lucky if they don't hit you in the head
with a tomato.''
   Tangible results included an announcement by British publisher
Robert Maxwell of the creation of a research center called the
Gorbachev Maxwell Institute of Technology, to be located in the Twin
Cities area. Maxwell's North American headquarters are in the Twin
Cities.
   At his meeting with business leaders, Gorbachev noted the 150
joint ventures under way with U.S. companies and called for more.
   Kittridge said it was impossible to estimate the number of people
who lined up to catch a glimpse of the famous visitors. However, he
said, the turnout was far smaller than the thousands who jammed
streets and the Capitol mall to celebrate the Minnesota Twins' World
Series win.

   It was a high school senior's request for a
Bible study class that led to Monday's U.S. Supreme Court ruling
that allows prayer groups in public schools.
   Bridget Mergens Mayhew, who has long since graduated from high
school, rejoiced at her legal victory. She said it made her feel
better about the education awaiting her 1{-year-old daughter.
   ``I never thought that it would go this far,'' Mrs. Mayhew said
in a telephone interview from Offutt Air Force Base, where her
husband is stationed. The base is just south of Omaha.
   In an 8-1 decision, the high court ruled that student prayer
groups must be allowed to meet at public schools that permit other
organized extracurricular activities. The court said a federal law
aimed at permitting religious clubs in public schools does not
violate constitutionally required separation of church and state.
   Mrs. Mayhew, now 23, was a senior at Omaha's Westside High School
when school officials turned down her request to start an
extracurricular club in which members would discuss the Bible.
   Mrs. Mayhew said there are still students at the 1,530-student
high school interested in starting such a club.
   ``I wish we could have had it,'' she said. ``I think it would
have changed the course of things, I think, for a lot of people. I
think it would have strengthened a lot of people.''
   Summer vacation began Friday at the school. Principal James
Findley said he knew of one student _ a senior who graduated this
year _ who had been interested in starting a Bible study class.
   A spokeswoman for the Westside Community Schools District said
officials were disappointed but would comply with the high court
ruling.
   ``We just want to analyze it further to see how it affects what
we have in place,'' said the spokeswoman, Di Saggau.
   Mrs. Mayhew, who was raised as a Roman Catholic and later became
a member of the Assembly of God Church, said her 1{-year-old
daughter, Meghann, made her fight more important. The high court's
ruling makes her less fearful about Meghann's future, she said.
   ``I would like her to be active in church. I would like her to
hang onto her values when she's in high school because there's so
few kids that do,'' she said.

<HEAD>Anti-apartheid Leader Begins World Campaign To Push For Continued
Sanctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GABARONE, Botswana (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela began a world tour
Monday to urge countries not to drop sanctions against South Africa
even though the country's white-dominated government has abandoned
some racist policies.
   ``Apartheid is still alive,'' the African National Congress
leader told an overflow crowd of 25,000 people who took the
afternoon off to hear him speak in the Gabarone National Stadium.
   Mandela's 13-nation, six-week trip, which includes stops in the
United States, follows a tour last month by South African President
F.W. de Klerk.
   During the trip, de Klerk said he expected European leaders to
reduce or end some economic, social and diplomatic sanctions against
South Africa in response to the reforms his government is carrying
out.
   But Mandela, whose ANC is the main black group working to end
white rule, said, ``To stop sanctions now would be a stab in the
back.''
   Also Monday, officials at the United Nations said
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will send a team of senior
U.N. officials to South Africa on Saturday for 10 days to discuss
ending apartheid.
   The team will meet members of the South African government,
representatives of political parties, movements and other
organizations on the latest developments concerning apartheid, a
statement said.
   Mandela said he intends to give leaders in Africa, Europe and
North America ``the correct picture'' of what is happening in South
Africa. He said that despite relaxation of restrictions on political
activity and repeal of some apartheid laws, the main issue of black
voting rights and self-determination has not been addressed.
   Under apartheid, the black majority has no vote.
   While Mandela is trying to persuade world leaders to keep up the
pressure on the South African government, de Klerk is expected to be
making dramatic changes at home.
   The government has already announced that later this month, it
expects Parliament to pass a bill repealing the Separate Amenities
Act, which allows the segregation of public facilities such as
parks, libraries and restrooms.
   Sometime this week, many observers and newspapers have predicted,
de Klerk will either lift the 4-year-old national state of emergency
or repeal most of it. Ending the state of emergency has been one of
the main conditions the African National Congress has set as a
prerequisite for the lifting of sanctions and for formal
constitutional negotiations with the government.
   ``If the state of emergency is lifted, that will be a victory for
us,'' Mandela told reporters as he boarded a 12-seat, twin-engine
Botswana government plane in Johannesburg.
   ``We have been demanding the lifting of the state of emergency
which has been identified by us as an obstacle to negotiations. The
lifting was part of the agreement reached during our (May 2-4) talks
with the government,'' he said.
   Mandela told the Gabarone rally that sanctions and the ANC's
armed struggle would end when fundamental and irreversible changes
occur in South Africa.

<HEAD>Lujan, Yeutter Agree to Help Hispanics</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of Interior Manual Lujan and
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter agreed Monday to improve
recruitment and employment opportunities in their agencies for
Hispanic students.
   Lujan and Yeutter signed separate Memorandums of Understanding
with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities to
develop a ``Hispanic Serving Institutions Partners Program'' within
the two agencies.
   The agreements are a first for Hispanics. The Interior Department
already has special programs for blacks attending Historically black
land grant colleges.
   ``We must take every step possible to ensure that the full
potential of all Americans is developed, so that we can successfully
meet the complex challenges of the 21st century,'' Lujan said.
   Association President Antonio Rigual noted that President Bush
has described the low educational attainment by Hispanics ``a
crisis.''
   ``I can tell you that the consequence of the Hispanic education
crisis will affect the entire nation,'' said Rigual. ``If all of us
_ the federal government, the education associations, the private
sector and school systems _ don't begin immediately to pull together
as a team on behalf of Hispanic students and Hispanic families to
create some real remedies to the problems of Hispanic education,
then we will all suffer.''
   The documents take effect immediately and require the agencies to
provide job information, work-study programs and internships, and to
assist the association in developing relevant curricula, conduct
career fairs and other recruitment activities.
   The memorandums also call for creation of a committee to advise
the two federal agencies and the association on policies,
procedures, programs and services to improve the scope and quality
of educational programs for Hispanics.
   Lujan said a minimum of $5 million will be spent over the
four-year life of the contract and all 10 Interior bureaus will
participate.
   Rigual said similar pacts also are in the works with the
Department of Energy and Labor.
   The association, founded in May 1986 in San Antonio, Texas,
represents colleges and universities where Hispanics constitute at
least 25 percent of the total student enrollment. The 113
institutions, located in 10 states and Puerto Rico, enroll almost
one-half of all the Hispanic college students in the United States.

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev had a
warm reunion today with former President Ronald Reagan, then told an
enthuasiastic audience at Stanford University: ``The Cold War is now
behind us. Let us not wrangle over who won it.''
   The reunion in a midmorning coffee klatch with their wives gave
Gorbachev an opportunity to enlist Reagan's help in winning
conservative support for arms and trade pacts signed last week by
President Bush.
   For Reagan, Gorbachev's partner in breaking the Cold War ice in
five summits, the meeting marked one of his few moments back in the
limelight since leaving office last year.
   The two men met at the home of the Soviet consul general, where
the Gorbachevs slept after flying in late Sunday from
Minneapolis-St. Paul, and spent a few minutes at the start gazing at
a view of the Golden Gate Bridge.
   Reagan said he and Gorbachev discussed the independence drive of
the Baltic states and other issues during their 40 minutes together.
   ``We discussed the obstacles that must be overcome,'' Reagan said
as he left holding a medal Gorbachev gave him for the American
people in thanks for their help following the Armenian earthquake.
   Reagan declined to discuss specifics of their talk or comment on
the summit between Gorbachev and Bush.
   Gorbachev, who told U.S. officials he was tired and delayed the
start of the Reagan breakfast 45 minutes, left immediately afterward
for a speech at Stanford University, south of San Francisco.
   Gorbachev's 50-car motorcade reached Stanford shortly before
noon, about an hour behind schedule. He was greeted by former
Secretary of State George Shultz, university President Donald
Kennedy, and Sens. Alan Cranston and Pete Wilson of California.
   Thousands of students, cheering ``Gorby, Gorby,'' welcomed the
Soviet leader as he walked through the inner quad of the scenic
campus. Gorbachev waded into the crowd, shaking hands with the
students and smiling.
   Greeted by a standing ovation as he began his speech, Gorbachev
drew more cheers when he told his audience: ``The Cold War is now
behind us. Let us not wrangle over who won it.''
   ``Let us think about the future,'' he said. ``Our two countries
have more than enough reasons to be partners in building it.''
   Also left in his schedule were: lunch with 150 captains of
industry in oil, banking, food, entertainment, airlines, hotels,
real estate and computers; and a meeting with the South Korean
president. The Soviet president heads home from San Francisco late
today, wrapping up a seven-day North American visit.
   Former first lady Nancy Reagan bristled at a question suggesting
she and Raisa Gorbachev once had a cool relationship. ``I think
there's been a great misunderstanding about our relationship,'' she
said.
   Shortly before the meeting, about 25 demonstrators hoisted five
Lithuanian flags and banners reading ``Freedom for Lithuania'' and
``Honk for Freedom'' at the south end of the Golden Gate Bridge. A
blue-and-gold biplane flew above the residence hauling a banner
calling for freedom for Armenia.
   Gorbachev's trip already has yielded two dividends _ pacts with
Chevron Corp. and IBM Corp.
   At a meeting with business leaders Sunday in Minnesota, Gorbachev
called for more U.S.-Soviet joint ventures and warned that
executives ``who just stand on the sidelines, who do not want to
risk'' will remain on the sidelines when the Soviet economy is
prospering. ``We'll make sure that is so,'' he said.
   The Gorbachevs were welcomed to California by Gov. George
Deukmejian, who presented him with a letter from the state's
Armenian community conveying hopes for the future of the Soviet
republic of Armenia, where activists are seeking greater autonomy
from central authority.
   The governor, who is among 350,000 Californians of Armenian
descent. Many Armenians have been killed in ethnic and political
strife in the southern U.S.S.R.
   After the speech at Stanford, Gorbachev was to return to the city
to pitch perestroika and opportunities for U.S.-Soviet joint
ventures to the banquet of billionaires and millionaires.
   Trade also was expected to dominate Gorbachev's late-afternoon
summit with South Korean President Roh Tae-woo, the first meeting
between leaders of the two countries since the Korean peninsula was
partitioned. Their talks were expected to help pave the way for an
easing of tensions on the peninsula.
   On Sunday, Gorbachev stopped for seven hours in Minneapolis,
wooing street crowds and business leaders and calling for help with
his country's radical reforms.
   ``When we begin such a project, we feel we need American business
because it is so big,'' he said at an evening meeting attended by
such corporate luminaries as the leaders of Amoco Corp., Kellogg
Co., Unisys Corp. and General Mills.
   In summit discussions last week in Washington, Bush and Gorbachev
agreed to a trade deal that was the result of classic
Washington-style horse trading, in which Gorbachev proved himself as
skillful a dealmaker as Bush.
   Bush agreed to give the Soviets full, normal trade rights,
receiving in return an implicit timetable to put liberal emigration
policies into Soviet law.
   The trade pact faces an uncertain future in Congress, where many
insist it will not gain approval unless Gorbachev eases economic
pressure against Lithuania. But Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich said
today that Gorbachev won some allies in his meeting with business
leaders Sunday.
   There was ``a very clear message'' that ``the business community
... really are going to put pressure on Washington that the Soviet
Union be granted most-favored-nation status,'' Perpich said on ``CBS
This Morning.''
   In addition to being a necessary first step toward drastically
cutting tariffs on Soviet goods sold in the United States, the trade
agreement would expand opportunities for U.S. companies in the
Soviet Union by reducing red tape and providing greater protections
against copyright piracy.
   Gorbachev is perhaps more popular in the West than he is at home,
where his people face bare store shelves in a failing economy.
   He made a point, before leaving Washington, of touting agreements
signed with Chevron and International Business Machines, saying they
provided a ``solid pillar of support'' for a new era of superpower
cooperation.
   Both the Chevron and IBM agreements were examples of commercial
contacts that would be facilitated by the trade agreement signed by
Bush and Gorbachev.
   The agreement the Soviets signed with Chevron on Saturday would
grant the San Francisco-based oil company exploration rights for
development of the Soviet Union's largest newly discovered oil
field, an 8,900-square-mile region near the Caspian Sea.
   The other agreement was for IBM to sell 13,000 personal computers
for use in Soviet schools. Stock analysts said the deal could be
worth around $25 million to IBM.

   Supporters of Mayor Marion Barry said Monday
outside the courtroom that prosecuting him on drug and perjury
charges is an unwarranted invasion of his personal life.
   ``What he did, he did to himself. ... We all have some skeletons
in our closet,'' said retiree Lavergne Marshall, who came to the
U.S. Courthouse in a show of support for the mayor. His case began
with 250 prospective jurors filling out questionnaires.
   If the case concerned misappropriation of funds or some crime
against the city, ``it would be a different thing altogether'' and
she would favor aggressive prosecution, Mrs. Marshall said.
   Some Barry supporters taunted two dozen members of the Guardian
Angels, a self-styled anti-crime group which demonstrated outside
the courthouse.
   ``Barry smoked crack, We don't want him back,'' said a sign
carried by one red-bereted member.
   ``The man himself is doing drugs'' and should step down because
he is an important role model for young people in the District of
Columbia, said Unique King, a regional coordinator for the Angels.
   The focal point of the government's case is an FBI videotape that
sources close to the case say shows Barry smoking crack cocaine in a
hotel room where an ex-model, Rasheeda Moore, had persuaded him to
come.
   ``When I think of the entrapment'' used by the government ``to
bring him to his knees, I think that is wrong,'' said Mrs. Marshall.
   The process of bringing Barry to trial on 14 criminal charges is
``racist at its very heart,'' said Chukwuma Onyeije, 24, a medical
student at Howard University.
   ``I think it's a very racist act ... just because of who he is,''
Dwight Terrell, a Washington resident, said in front of the
courthouse.
   The Barry prosecution is part of ``a conspiracy against black
political leaders,'' said Donald Coble, also of Washington.

   Lithuania's president said Monday he hoped Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev would soften his stance toward the
breakaway Baltic republic after returning from the superpower summit.
   But Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis added in an
interview with the Voice of America radio station that he did not
hear any encouraging words from Gorbachev during four days of talks
in Washington with President Bush.
   ``The worst would have been if Mikhail Gorbachev came out with
the impression that everything he is doing vis-a-vis Lithuania is
permitted,'' Landsbergis said in the interview, a transcript of
which was provided in English to The Associated Press.
   He charged Gorbachev with using ``propaganda methods'' toward
Lithuania, which declared independence March 11. Gorbachev has
ordered an economic embargo of fuel and many other supplies on the
republic of 3.8 million residents.
   Soviet media reported Monday that Moscow authorities were
enforcing the embargo even on supplies Lithuania bought abroad.
   Soviet border guards turned away trucks carrying sorely needed
gasoline from Poland late Friday, said the Interfax news agency,
which is affiliated with state Radio Moscow.
   It said the Lithuanian government had bought about 1.1 million
gallons of gasoline from Poland for hard currency, but couldn't get
the shipmet across the Soviet-controlled border.
   The independent Estonian News Service reported a similar
incident. It said a train carrying gas obtained through bartering
with Poland was idled Monday in the neutral zone between the two
borders, and it was unclear whether border guards or customs
authorities were holding it.
   Gorbachev has demanded Lithuania revoke its declaration before
the blockade can be lifted and negotiations begun over secession on
the basis of the Soviet constitution.
   But Landsbergis on Monday reiterated Lithuania's refusal to
reverse its declaration, saying, ``I don't think we'll ever be able
to take this step,'' according to government-run VOA.
   At the summit, Bush and Gorbachev agreed to a trade pact that
Bush said is conditioned only on Moscow's approval of liberalized
emigration laws. Bush had been saying Moscow also must end its
blockade against Lithuania, but he changed that position Sunday.
   Kazimiera Prunskiene, Lithuania's prime minister who met with
Bush and Gorbachev separately in the past weeks, said she believed
Gorbachev would modify his position on Lithuania after returning
home.
   ``It's one thing to talk tough in America's forums and to disply
this firm position by the U.S.S.R. and Gorbachev himself, but it is
another thing to understand that the U.S. Congress, as well as the
situation in the Soviet Union, are unfavorable to his rigid
position,'' she told VOA.
   Congress must still approve the trade pact, and some U.S.
lawmakers have said they would not allow the Soviet Union to become
a most-favored-nation trading partner until Gorbachev ends his
economic squeeze on Lithuania.
   The most-favored-nation designation qualifies a trading partner
for the lowest U.S. tariffs.

   The Supreme Court assured police Monday they
may continue using jailhouse undercover agents, ruling that such
agents may trick suspects into confessing without first warning them
of their rights.
   By an 8-1 vote, the justices said jailed criminal suspects need
not receive so-called Miranda warnings about their right to remain
silent and get a lawyer's help before being questioned by undercover
agents.
   In its famous 1966 ruling, the court ruled that police must give
such warnings before interrogating suspects who are in custody.
   But writing for the court in an Illinois case Monday, Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy said, ``Miranda warnings are not required when
the suspect is unaware that he is speaking to a law enforcement
officer and gives a voluntary statement.''
   Kennedy added:
   ``Conversations between suspects and undercover agents do not
implicate the concerns underlying Miranda. The essential ingredients
of a police-dominated atmosphere and compulsion are not present when
an incarcerated person speaks freely to someone that he believes to
be a fellow inmate.''
   Justice Thurgood Marshall, the lone dissenter, said the ruling
``may well result in a proliferation of departmental policies to
encourage police officers to conduct interrogations of confined
suspects through undercover agents.
   The decision's impact is confined to jailed suspects not yet
charged with the crime about which they are questioned. The court in
1980 ruled that law enforcement officials cannot hire jailhouse
informants to elicit confessions from those already charged with a
crime or those who have invoked their right to a lawyer's help.
   Monday's ruling is a defeat for Lloyd Perkins, who unwittingly
made incriminating remarks about a murder to an undercover agent at
a Hillsboro, Ill., jail.
   Perkins later was charged with fatally shooting Richard
Stephenson on Nov. 8, 1984, in Fairview Heights, Ill.
   ``Miranda was not meant to protect suspects from boasting about
their criminal activities in front of persons whom they believe to
be their cellmates,'' Kennedy wrote for the high court, adding that
Perkins ``spoke at his own peril.''
   The decision reversed an Illinois appeals court ruling that the
statements Perkins made to Parisi could not be used as trial
evidence.

   Soviet media continued their rapturous coverage of
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's U.S. visit Monday, focusing on the excited
whoops of welcome that met the president and his wife, Raisa, in
Minnesota.
   The nightly news program ``Vremya'' devoted a half-hour out of 45
minutes to the Gorbachevs' stay in the midwestern state.
   In one segment, a reporter asked Gorbachev for his impressions of
the American midwest, and he answered: ``Terrific!''
   Soviet TV showed Mrs. Gorbachev sitting down for tea in an
American family's home, and she announced afterward that the visit
had a major effect on her.
   ``I spent one hour with that family and I love America and
Americans a thousand times more now,'' the normally reserved Mrs.
Gorbachev said while hugging one of the children.
   ``Vremya'' cameras lingered on Minnesota crowds that met the
Soviet couple with the kind of euphoric welcome they never receive
in their own country, where citizens are embittered by empty store
shelves and painful reforms.
   They zoomed in on Minnesotans wearing sweatshirts with
``Welcome'' in Russian emblazoned on them and waving ``Gorbychiefs''
_ handkerchiefs distributed specially for the visit.
   The government newspaper Izvestia devoted almost its entire front
page to the summit Monday, with one story headlined ``Gorbachev _ in
the Heart of America!''
   Soviet TV showed one potential disagreement: Gorbachev answering
an Israeli correspondent's question about the Soviet leader's
threats to limit Jewish emigration if Soviet Jews continue settling
in Israel's occupied territories.
   Gorbachev insisted that Israel ban settlement of Soviet emigres
on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Asked if he would accept an Israeli government invitation to
visit, he said frankly, ``The time has not come.''

   Middle-class black women with college educations
are twice as likely to bear low-birth-weight babies as whites of the
same income and education, a study found.
   The study of more than 100,000 births in Chicago suggests that
the effects of poverty linger for generations, the researchers said
Monday.
   Low birth weight is the most important predictor of whether
babies will die, said the lead researcher, Dr. James W. Collins Jr.,
who specializes in newborns at Children's Memorial Hospital.
   The United States, which ranks 22nd among developed countries in
infant survival, is losing its fight to reduce the infant mortality
rate, Collins said.
   He and a colleague, Dr. Richard J. David of Cook County Hospital,
examined 103,072 birth records _ about half of them for whites and
half for blacks _ for the years 1982 and 1983.
   They found that low-birth-weight babies _ those less than 5{
pounds _ were born to blacks at twice the rate they were to whites
at virtually every income and educational level.
   In households earning less than $10,000 a year, 15 percent of the
black babies were of low birth weight, compared with 8 percent for
whites.
   In households earning $30,000 to $40,000 a year, the rate was 10
percent for blacks and 5 percent for whites.
   Among mothers with less than a high school education, the rate
was 16 percent for blacks and 7 percent for whites, and for mothers
with a college ecucation the rate was 10 percent for blacks and 5
percent for whites.
   ``If you're middle class and black, despite having education,
being of optimal age (to have children) and living in a $20,000 to
$30,000-a-year household ... you still do twice as bad as whites
similar to you,'' Collins said.
   The study appears in the June issue of the American Journal of
Public Health, where the two researchers write: ``We suspect that
the persistently high rate of low birth weight infants among blacks
reflects generations of poverty.''
   The researchers added they also suspect that ``it may require
more than one generation of non-poverty and adequate services to see
an impact upon infant birth weight.''
   The researchers didn't examine specific factors that might have
caused the differences, but Collins said he believed nutrition
during adolescence may be key.
   ``I think psychosocial stress is also a factor, but it's very
hard to measure,'' said Collins. Another may be that fewer blacks
than whites seek prenatal care, even when both can afford it, he
said.
   He cited a study published in November 1988 about 31,000 largely
middle-class women in a California health maintenance organization.
   It found that prenatal care could narrow the gap between rates of
low-birth-weight babies between blacks and whites, but that blacks
sought such care less often.
   ``I don't know how much racism comes into it,'' Collins said,
speculating that some blacks may have had so many bad experiences
with medical institutions that they tend to avoid them.
   Dr. Kwang-sun Lee, a University of Chicago professor of
pediatrics and obstetrics-gynecology, said he believed none of the
factors that has been studied, such as improved prenatal care,
reduced teen-age pregnancy or improved nutrition, would eliminate
the discrepancies. Improvement in all those areas might help, said
Lee, who wasn't involved with the study.
   ``The study which has not been clearly done is what is the effect
of a stressful life situation,'' he said. ``When women in low social
classes have repeated stressful events, what happens to the womb has
not been defined yet.''
   American Indians have normal-weight babies as often as whites,
even though they are poorer than whites or blacks, Lee said,
suggesting that none of the effects of poverty usually blamed for
low-birth-weight babies appears to be affecting them.
   Lee and Collins noted that British researchers showed as long as
20 years ago that the rate of low birth weights didn't decline until
the second generation after a woman attained more affluence.
   ``It is more important how you are brought up than whether you
marry a millionaire,'' Lee said.

   Sig Rogich, the former Las Vegas public
relations man who is President Bush's chief image-maker, is a
multimillionaire with holdings in radio, real estate, advertising
and other businesses, according to his White House financial
disclosure report.
   At the other end of the spectrum, Marlin Fitzwater, the
president's press secretary, reported assets ranging from $17,005 to
$55,000 and outside income of $2,722 to $4,520. He also reported
getting a $60 pair of binoculars as a gift from West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Rogich reported assets of at least $3.9 million to $5.5 million
or more, and net income on his holdings in the range of $180,549 to
$238,544 or more. His interests included an advertising firm, radio
stations, mobile billboards and a bar in Truckee, Calif.
   The forms were released Monday by the office of White House
general counsel Boyden Gray.
   Rogich, in a telephone interview from California. where he was
lending a hand to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the final
stops of his post-summit tour of America, said he had put his
holdings in a blind trust and ordered his trustee to sell off his
stocks.
   Among the interests being sold were the bar and stock in a Las
Vegas corporation, W.C.W. Corp., which owns two casinos, the form
showed.
   Rogich, who helped put together the ads for Ronald Reagan's
re-election drive in 1984 and for the Bush campaign in 1988, became
Bush's assistant for ``special activities and initiatives'' last
October.
   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu reported on his disclosure
form that he is on leave as an associate professor of engineering
from Tufts University, but does not accept tuition breaks or other
faculty benefits for his children while he works in Washington.
   Sununu, the former governor of New Hampshire, reported assets
ranging from $422,008 to more than $1 million, and income apart from
his White House salary ranging from $15,506 to $55,000, plus $34,272
that his wife, Nancy, made working for the Republican Governors
Association, $3,269 she made from an insurance agency and $9,151 in
salary that Sununu himself earned in his final weeks as governor in
early 1989.
   Sununu also reported getting $173 in gifts from Gorbachev in the
form of a lacquered samovar, two bottles of Russian vodka and four
ounces of black caviar.
   Robert Gates, the deputy national security adviser to the
president and former career CIA man, reported assets ranging from
$33,005 to $115,000 and outside income of $2,305 to $8,000. He also
had a home equity loan ranging from $15,001 to $50,000, and reported
gifts of two dozen roses worth $100 from the ambassador from Bahrain
and a $160 vase from the Chinese ambassador.
   The forms do not require top government executives to disclose
the value of their main residence or principal mortgage.
   Chase Untermeyer, the White House personnel director, disclosed
assets of $196,013 to $560,000, and outside income ranging from
$18,519 to $43,610. Untermeyer, a former Texas state representative
from Houston, said he also had $33,218 in a leftover state campaign
fund.
   Andrew Card, the deputy chief of staff, reported assets of
$104,005 to $270,000 and outside income of $15,304 to $28,000. He
also had a mortgage on property he owns in Holbrook, Mass., of
$15,001 to $50,000, plus a home equity loan on an adjacent property
that allows him to borrow up to $170,000.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills on Monday
sought Latin American support for a U.S. effort to eliminate
barriers to agricultural trade.
   She said that Latin America had a major stake in the outcome of
the current global trade talks, due to conclude at the end of this
year, because of the dependence of many nations in the region on
farm exports.
   The United States is pushing a proposal that would eliminate all
trade-distorting agricultural subsidies over the next 10 years.
However, the 12-nation European Community is leading a fight to
preserve farm subsidies because of its network of small farms.
   In a speech to Organization of American States meeting in
Paraguay, Hills said the European Community was refusing to budge in
its opposition and she appealed for support from Latin America.
   ``If, by working together, we can cause our reform proposal to
prevail, the developing world will no longer have to compete against
the treasuries of the developed world,'' she said in remarks
released in Washington. ``We should put an end to the astronomic
export subsidies by which governments bribe the marketplace.''
   Unless there is movement on the contentious issue of farm
subsidies, many fear that the four-year round of trade
liberalization talks, being held under the auspices of the 96-nation
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, will end in failure.
   Hills was unable to make progress on the farm issue during
meetings in Paris last week with EC officials. She said the
administration still viewed reform of agricultural subsidies as
critical for achieving a successful package of new trading rules.
   Hills hailed the dramatic economic and political changes
occurring in such countries as Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia,
Chile, Costa Rica and Mexico. She said that the Bush administration
stood ready to forge a new partnership to promote economic growth.
   She said the United States had a major stake in what occurs in
Latin America because nearly 60 percent of total U.S. direct foreign
investment was concentrated in the region. Central and South America
also represented a huge market for U.S. exports, she said.
   ``The lost decade of the 1980s was not only your tragedy, but
also ours,'' she said. ``It is estimated that U.S. exporters lost as
much as $130 billion (in possible sales) in the region from 1982 to
1988. It wasn't until 1988 that our exports climbed back to their
1981 level.''
   She said the partnership she was proposing with the United States
would involve negotiating commercial agreements to liberalize trade
and investment and working to promote a ``hemispheric zone of open
trade.''
   The United States is in the process of removing all trade
barriers with Canada and there are preliminary discussions
concerning a possible free trade zone with Mexico as well.

<HEAD>Vt. Supreme Court Upholds Moratorium on Jury Trials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER GRAFF</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Vermont Supreme Court upheld a
six-month state moratorium on civil jury trials such as divorces and
said the budget-cutting measure didn't interfere with the right to a
speedy trial.
   The moratorium, intended to save $75,000 to help the state avoid
a deficit, did not affect criminal trials.
   The constitutional guarantee of a speedy trial must be considered
in context, the court said, adding that speedy need not be instant.
   The ban only affected civil cases, which usually involve
divorces, property disputes, personal injury claims, malpractice
suits and breaches of contract. It could be overriden in specific
cases by the administrative trial judge.
   The moratorium, which will expire July 1, was imposed by the
court in January as a way to cope with budget cuts prompted by the
state's sagging economy. The court was ordered to reduce its budget
by about $300,000.
   The 220-member Vermont Trial Lawyers Association filed a
class-action lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban. It said that the
federal and state constitutions guarantee the right to a speedy
trial.
   However, the court said its action was constitutional and a
prudent way to manage caseloads and resources.
   ``Our precedents do not support the absolutist view of the jury
trial right that the petitioners espouse,'' said the decision,
written by retired Chief Justice Albert Barney.
   Even with the moratorium, Barney noted, most cases will come to
trial faster than in past years.
   The petitioners' remedy of instant access to a jury ``cannot be
found in the constitutional jury trial rights on which they rely.
Caseloads cannot be managed on the simplistic position that everyone
is entitled to an immediate trial whenever they are ready for one,''
Barney wrote.
   The Vermont Supreme Court decision is counter to a federal court
ruling in California that held civil jury trials in U.S. District
Court could not be suspended because of fiscal restraints.
   But the Vermont justices said the federal ruling centered around
the length of the moratorium, not the moratorium itself. The
justices said the Vermont moratorium delayed civil jury trials for
only ``a relatively short period of time.''
   The trial lawyers' association had sought to disqualify the
entire five-member Supreme Court from the case, arguing that the
justices issued the moratorium and therefored had a conflict of
interest.
   The court disagreed, but two members disqualified themselves
because of personal relationships with some of the law firms
involved in the challenge.
   Barney and another retired justice took their places on the court.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Monday he
will have a majority in parliament to form a right-wing coalition
government and that he expects to swear in the new Cabinet next week.
   Shamir, 74, head of the Likud bloc, said he expected 61 to 65
members in the 120-seat Knesset, or parliament, to approve the
coalition.
   If his prediction proves accurate, Shamir would be sworn in next
week as premier for the fourth time since 1983.
   Shamir's aide Yossi Ahimeir said the new Cabinet would maintain
Israel's commitment to U.S.-backed peace proposals despite expected
opposition from ultranationalist coalition partners.
   Shamir has spent the past 39 days trying to forge a new alliance
with smaller religious and right-wing parties. It would replace the
national unity government with the center-left Labor Party, which
was toppled March 15 by a vote of no confidence in parliament.
   Asked when he would submit his new government for parliament
approval, Shamir told reporters: ``I cannot give you a precise date.
But it will certainly be early next week.''
   A Labor official close to Labor Party leader Shimon Peres said he
believed there was an 80 percent chance Shamir would succeed in
forming a narrow government.
   But he said since Shamir's hopes hinged on a single vote
``anything could still happen'' as it did in April when Peres lost a
bid to form a Labor-led government after a member of a religious
faction in parliament defected at the last moment.
   Shamir was expected to delay formal announcement until he irons
out details of his agreements with other factions, Ahimeir said in a
telephone interview.
   He faces a deadline of midnight Thursday when the mandate given
to him by President Chaim Herzog expires.
   Ahimeir said ``some points with smaller parties'' were still
pending negotiation and declined to elaborate. ``There is nothing
sure in Israeli politics, but at the moment we can say he has a
majority with 61 seats.''
   Likud has the support of three Orthodox factions and two
independent members who are also religious.
   Ahimeir said Likud hoped to add four members of the Agudat Israel
ultra-Orthodox party after the coalition was approved by parliament.
That would give Shamir control over 65 seats.
   Agudat Israel has conditioned support on Likud assurances that it
would ban the sale of pork in Israel and curtail public
transportation on the Jewish Sabbath.
   The deciding votes for Shamir came Monday from the two-seat
Moledet or ``Homeland'' faction that advocates expelling
Palestinians from Israeli-held territory. The party held out for
weeks, demanding control of the police ministry and cancellation of
an initiative to hold Palestinian elections in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Moledet leader Rehavam Zeevi said he would support the new
Cabinet without formally joining. Because of the differences, he
declined to sign a coalition agreement as is customary.
   Shamir's peace plan is also opposed by two other right-wing
coalition partners, the pro-settlement Tehiya and Tzomet factions.
   But Ahimeir insisted the plan would be included in the new
government's policy guidelines.
   ``We are committed to the plan without any doubts,'' said
Ahimeir. ``This (new) government, although it is called narrow and
right-wing, will work to advance the peace process.''
   Despite the tenuous agreements reached, Likud leaders feel
confident the right-wing parties would prefer compromising with
Likud rather than seeing a possible new Likud union with Labor.

   The grain agreement signed by President Bush
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev continues the principal trade
between the two countries that is nowhere near its potential, a food
processing executive said Monday.
   ``We could be doing $250 billion a year in trade,'' said George
Melnykovich, president of the Food Processing Machinery and Supplies
Association.
   Bush and Gorbachev signed a five-year agreement Friday to
increase the annual minimum shipments of U.S. grain to the Soviets
to 10 million metric tons from 9 million tons. Recent shipments have
greatly exceeded the minimums.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds, about 36.7 bushels of wheat
or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   The current pact, which has been in effect since 1983, expires
Dec. 31. Such grain agreements have existed since 1976.
   The agreement is worth roughly $6 billion to $8 billion to
farmers and exporters over the five years, said Agriculture
Department analyst Cina Radler. It's impossible to pinpoint the
exact value because of fluctuations in market price, she said.
   ``Take out the grain agreement and the rest of trade between the
two countries in infinitesimal,'' said Melnykovich. But he said the
Soviets want so much and the United States has so much to offer that
trade should mushroom.
   The main problem is money, he said. The Soviet ruble is not worth
much outside the Soviet Union, so American companies don't want to
be paid in Soviet currency.
   Melnykovich predicted that in the next five years, the Soviet
government would make the ruble a freely convertible currency that
could be used in world trade.
   Melnykovich is one of the organizers of a three-day conference in
Washington that is bringing together 55 Soviet ministers to discuss
the state of the Soviet food system and with U.S. food companies.
   ``It's an unprecedented meeting between leaders of one U.S.
industry and top Soviet officials,'' said Anthony J.F. O'Reilly,
chief ececutive officer of the H.J. Heinz Co. and conference
chairman.
   Though Germany and Japan also are probing the Soviet market,
Melynkovich said the Soviet Union would rather do business with the
United States.
   The fact that the countries were allies in World War II against
Germany and Japan is important, but also because the countries are
both geographically large and need efficient food distribution
systems.
   ``It doesn't take much to get from one point to another in small
countries like Japan and Germany,'' said Melnykovich.
   ``The Soviets are asking, `How is it that the U.S. does it?'' he
said.
   Vladilen Nikitin, the Soviet equivalent to the U.S. secretary of
agriculture, said the conference was the first step toward
increasing sale of agricultural commodities to the Soviet Union.
   As for the grain agreement, he said: ``We got what we expected.''
   He noted that Wednesday he would be signing an agreement on food
processing with Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher.
   ``We need all types of products,'' he said, speaking through an
interpreter.
   Soviet grain purchases in most years have exceeded the required
minimums. In 1988-89, for example, sales were more than double the
specified minimum.
   Much wheat _ recently all of it _ has been sold to the Soviet
Union with the help of export subsidies. A sale of 9.2 million
bushels (250,000 metric tons) in May for June delivery carried a
subsidy of 50 cents per bushel ($18.18 per ton). No. 2 red wheat now
sells for about $3.50 per bushel ($128.45 per ton) on the Kansas
City spot market.
   No other grains are eligible for the export subsidies.
   The Kremlin will have some greater year-to-year flexibility under
the new arrangement by being allowed to choose between wheat and
feed grains, although over the life of the pact the minimums will be
met, officials said.
   The Soviets will be committed to buying at least 4 million tons
each of wheat and feed grains. However, in any one year Moscow may
substitute up to 750,000 tons of one commodity for the other.
   For the first time, the pact includes barley and sorghum as feed
grains.
   Additional flexibility also was provided by giving Moscow
automatic permission to buy up to 14 million tons of grain annually
without further discussion with Washington.
   The automatic limit under the current pact is 12 million tons,
although the United States has routinely increased that to fit
Soviet needs.
   As of May 31, the Soviets had bought more than 16.7 million tons
of U.S. wheat and corn under the current agreement for delivery this
year. Last year's sales totaled a record 21.7 million tons.

   Entertainer Michael Jackson was
hospitalized in stable condition Monday and undergoing tests for
chest pains. His sister, LaToya, said he was fine and she sent him a
dozen black roses.
   The 31-year-old Jackson, who had been ill for several days,
became alarmed Sunday evening at his Los Angeles home when pain
gripped his chest. His doctor drove him to the hospital.
   ``He wasn't moaning or turning over in pain or anything, but I
could tell there was discomfort,'' Jackson spokesman Bob Jones said
after seeing the entertainer at St. John's Hospital and Health
Center.
   ``He's undergoing several important tests today. I don't think it
was a heart attack. He just experienced some discomfort. He had been
feeling bad the past two or three days,'' said Jones.
   Brother Jermaine Jackson left the hospital Monday afternoon and
said, ``He's lying in bed, resting comfortably.''
   The ailing singer received a get-well message from the White
House. ``President Bush just called to wish Michael Jackson well,''
said Jones.
   Jackson is in the same hospital, on the same floor as his friend,
Elizabeth Taylor. The actress has been recovering from a near-fatal
bout of pneumonia and complications for nearly two months.
   Miss Taylor was in stable condition on Monday, according to Chen
Sam and Associates, the New York City public relations firm
representing the actress.
   The hospital released a statement Monday saying Jackson remained
hospitalized and ``his physician, Dr. Steven Hoefflin, states that
he will be undergoing several diagnostic tests.''
   No other details were released by the hospital, and inquiries
were referred to Jackson's spokesman.
   ``I think he's fine. He just checked in because he wasn't feeling
well,'' LaToya Jackson said in a telephone interview from London.
   ``I sent him some roses, a dozen black roses. I think they are
beautiful,'' said Miss Jackson, an older sister of Michael who is
also a singer.
   She said her brother has had similar chest pains in the past that
required hospitalization and his doctor blamed the attacks on stress.
   Three flower-bearing Jackson fans spent the night outside the
hospital.
   ``We just want to know how he's doing. I'm a dedicated fan and I
just want to know he's OK,'' said Lonnell Williams, 21, of suburban
North Hollywood.
   Jackson was catapulted into the public eye at age 5 with the
Jackson Five family pop group. He later left his brothers and became
a one-man phenomenon.
   The reclusive star has been celebrated as widely for his
eccentricities as for his music and choreography.
   Jackson won an unprecedented eight Grammy Awards for his 1982
release, ``Thriller,'' the most successful album of all time with
sales of more than 40 million copies worldwide.
   His last album, ``Bad,'' sold more than 19 million copies and
spawned five No. 1 hits. It was released in 1987.
   Jackson was hospitalized in January 1984 after his hair caught
fire during filming of a Pepsi-Cola commercial in Los Angeles. The
accident caused by a misfiring smoke bomb left him with
second-degree scalp burns.

<HEAD>Report Shows Dwindling Salmon Numbers On Columbia, Snake Rivers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salmon runs on two western rivers have steadily
declined over the past 20 years and populations at some dams last
year were the lowest ever observed, a report released Monday said.
   Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., asked the National Marine Fisheries
Service and the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife to study the
runs on the Columbia and Snake rivers.
   ``Clearly, we know from this report that the runs are in trouble.
Clearly, the fish are declining. Particularly on the Snake River,
the stocks are way down,'' said Bill Calder, Hatfield's press
secretary.
   Oregon Trout, a Portland-based conservation group, has asked the
NMFS to place four salmon runs in the Columbia River basin on the
endangered species list. The four are the native runs of Lower
Columbia coho salmon as well as the Snake River's spring, summer and
fall chinook salmon.
   Hatfield said in March he wanted the report in hand to help get a
head start on the listing process and avoid some of the political
rhetoric that has surrounded the debate over whether to list the
northern spotted owl as a threatened species.
   The report provides a ``perspective on the salmon runs in
question'' but does not provide a basis for definitive judgments on
the status of the runs under the Endangered Species Act, its authors
said.
   In a letter to Hatfield, NMFS regional director Rolland Schmitten
and Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife Director Randy Fisher
said, ``We share your concern over salmon runs and other users of
Columbia River water.''
   Mark Chilcote, natural production program manager for the Oregon
Department of Fish and Wildlife, said the report basically compiled
previous studies to give an overview on the status of the fish in
the region.
   The report based its population counts primarily on escapements,
the number of fish that avoid being caught and safely return to
their spawning grounds, and redd counts, which are the easily
observable nests that female salmon dig in river-bottom gravel to
lay eggs.

<HEAD>Return To Public Office Removes Bennett From High-Earnings Course</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug policy director William J. Bennett was on
course to earn more than $500,000 last year before he returned from
private life to public office, according to financial disclosure
forms released Monday.
   During the first 2{ months before he took office March 10,
Bennett earned $80,246 from speeches and consulting work plus
$25,962 in salary as president of The Madison Center, a private
policy research group he created.
   If the $106,208 income from the early months had held up
throughout 1989, he could have earned about $550,000, not including
interest on savings.
   Instead, the government started paying him after March 10 at the
rate of $99,500 for a full year, or about $80,000 for the rest of
1989.
   Adding that salary to the earnings of the first couple of months
plus his declared interest earnings gave Bennett an approximate
income of $191,209 to $201,208 for 1989.
   His interest earnings totaled between $5,001 and $15,000.
   Bennett, known as one of the poorest members of President
Reagan's Cabinet when he was education secretary, saw his income
zoom after he resigned that job Sept. 20, 1988, thanks to The
Madison Center and invitations from across the country to speak.
   He realized before he became President Bush's director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy that his earnings would
nosedive, saying at the time, ``Well, we had a good Christmas.''
   Bennett still does not own a home, despite his few lucrative
months. He and his wife Elayne, who works for a project at
Georgetown University funded by the Bradley Foundation, live with
their two young sons in a rented home in suburban Maryland.
   His assets went down somewhat last year, according to the form,
which does not mention personal property such as automobiles and
which lists assets only in ranges.
   In 1988, Bennett's assets ranged from $301,003 to $356,002 and
up. Bennett stated his net worth in early 1989 was about $432,600,
not including cars, in a financial statement provided to the Senate
Judiciary Committee that handled his confirmation hearing.
   For 1989, Bennett's assets ranged from $150,002 to $350,000. The
form as filled out by Bennett indicated assets of $65,002 to
$150,000, but spokesman Don Hamilton, responding to a query
regarding the dramatic drop, said the form had been filled out in
error and would be amended to reflect the higher asset level.
   Even at the higher level, the maximum assets would be about
$82,600 less than they were in 1988.
   Bennett signed a contract in late 1988 with Simon &amp; Shuster
publishers to produce two books, and he received advanced royalties
of $187,500. His current financial disclosure form says he will
receive royalties from the publication of a book, yet no book has
been published.
   Hamilton said that although Bennett completed the manuscript for
one book, it will not be published until he is out of office.

   Arnold Schwarzenegger went to Mars and came back
with a $25.5 million box office for ``Total Recall,'' muscling his
way to the biggest weekend take of the year, according to figures
released Monday.
   The latest hot release of the summer movie season earned more in
three days than the $23.7 million taken in by ``Back to the Future
Part III'' in four days over the Memorial Day weekend.
   Set in the year 2084, ``Total Recall'' depicts Schwarzenegger as
an Earth laborer who signs up for a memory-implant vacation and soon
finds himself enmeshed in a civil war on Mars. The special
effects-laden movie cost an estimated $50 million to make.
   Other box-office benchmarks claimed by Tri-Star Pictures, which
released ``Total Recall'': the highest three-day opening weekend for
an ``R'' rated film and the largest opening of a Schwarzenegger film
in history, outdrawing the $12 million opening for ``Predator'' two
years ago.
   The summer movie season begins with the four-day Memorial Day
weekend; the latest figures are for the latest regular weekend of
the summer season.
   The biggest regular weekend opening ever remains ``Batman,'' with
nearly $48 million.
   ``Back to the Future Part III,'' about the final adventures of
time travelers Marty McFly and Doc Brown, was in second place with
$10.3 million, according to figures compiled by Entertainment Data
Inc. and Exhibitor Relations.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections when figures aren't immediately available.
   ``Bird on a Wire,'' with Goldie Hawn and Mel Gibson, earned $6.3
million in its third week.
   Fourth was ``Pretty Woman,'' taking $4.7 million in its 11th
week. The movie has now earned nearly $127 million.
   In fifth and sixth place were two faltering early-summer
releases, ``Cadillac Man,'' with $2.8 million and ``Fire Birds,''
with $2.6 million.
   Holdovers from spring made up the rest of the Top 10, with
``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' earning nearly $2 million for
seventh place; ``The Hunt for Red October'' with more than $1
million for eighth and ``Tales from the Darkside'' in ninth with
half a million dollars.
   In tenth place was ``Joe Versus the Volcano,'' earning more than
$400,000.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Monday as
tallied by Exhibitor Relations, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.
   Figures are based on a combination of actual box-office receipts
and studio projections where actual figures are not immediately
available.
   1. ``Total Recall,'' Tri-Star, $25.5 million, 2,060 screens,
$12,395 per screen, $25.5 million, one week.
   2. ``Back to the Future III,'' Universal, $10.3 million, 2,025
screens, $5,105 per screen, $38 million, two weeks.
   3. ``Bird on a Wire,'' Universal, $6.3 million, 1,963 screens,
$3,235 per screen, $42.2 million, three weeks.
   4. ``Pretty Woman,'' Disney, $4.7 million, 1,791 screens, $2,655
per screen, $126.7 million, 11 weeks.
   5. ``Cadillac Man,'' Orion, $2.8 million, 1,878 screens, $1,536
per screen, $19.5 million, three weeks.

<TEXT>
   Turkish Communists tried to legally
register their party on Monday despite a constitutional ban of
Marxist and religious parties.
   Two leaders of the United Communist Party, Nihat Sargin and
Haydar Kutlu, registered the United Communist Party of Turkey at the
Interior Ministry.
   The party's charter calls it a Marxist, revolutionary workers
party based on class struggle, the same words mentioned as a cause
for banning in Turkey's legal code.
   The chief prosecutor's office will now study the application,
which could make the party legal for the first time in 70 years.
   Sargin, 64, a physician who is the party chairman, and Kutlu, 36,
party secretary-general, were released from prison a month ago. They
had been arrested in November 1987 upon their arrival from exile in
West Germany.
   The two have been barred from foreign travel while their trial on
attempting to stage a Communist revolution in Turkey continues.
   Sargin and Kutlu told a news conference Monday their aim was ``a
Turkey without fear, exile or censorship'' and that the party will
advocate human rights and ethnic rights for Turkey's Kurdish
minority.
   Kurds are estimated to constitute 20 percent of the country's
total population of 56 million, but are not recognized as an ethnic
minority by the government.
   The Communist Party was forced into exile in 1920.
   For the past several years there has been a debate in Turkey on
whether the amend laws barring Marxist and religious parties.
   Legalization of such parties is considered necessary for Turkey
to succeed in becoming a full member of the European Economic
Community.

<TEXT>
   The White House said Monday President Bush will
nominate David H. Leroy, former lieutenant governor of Idaho, as the
negotiator charged with launching a new search for a palce to put
the nation's growing inventory of highly radioactive nuclear waste.
   Leroy, 42, of Boise, Idaho, will canvass governors, Indian tribal
leaders and others in hopes of uncovering a site willing to become a
temporary or permanent high-level nuclear waste repository.
   In a telephone interview from his law offices, Leroy said the
task could make him ``the most unpopular person in America.''
   But he called it an important mission that could help solve a
problem fraught with ``moral, political and scientific
ramifications.''
   He promised to mount ``an aggressive effort to search the
country'' and U.S. territories for localities that may have an
untapped interest in accepting a nuclear waste repository.
   Congress ordered the president to appoint an independent nuclear
waste negotiator in 1987 at the same time it designated Nevada's
Yucca Mountain on a nuclear weapons testing range as the most likely
site for a repository.
   The 1987 legislation ordered the Energy Department to drop work
on two other candidate sites in Texas and Washington State, and to
begin the expensive detailed subterranean geological investigation
necessary to see if Yucca Mountain is suitable for an installation
that must confine the waste for at least 10,000 years.
   Underground research has not yet begun. The state of Nevada has
refused to grant permits for it and the question is tied up in court.
   Leroy, a Republican who narrowly lost a bid to unseat Democratc
Gov. Cecil Andrus in 1986, said, ``Congress felt very strongly that
an aggressive effort should be made to determine whether there were
any locations with a technically sound repository site that might be
willing to assume a larger role'' voluntarily.
   If the search produces a willing taker, Leroy is also charged
with recommending acceptable terms to Congress. The legislation gave
the negotiator until 1991 to complete the search. Leroy said, ``A
quick start is essential.''
   If confirmed, he will operate independently from the Department
of Energy, but will not be responsible to the department. It is a
part-time post, and Leroy said he will keep up his law practice in
Boise.
   Leroy was Idaho's attorney general from 1979 to 1983 and its
lieutenant governor from 1983 to 1987.

   Despite pockets of protest, Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev charmed a university crowd of
thousands with handshakes, smiles and waves Monday to cheers of
``Gorby! Gorby!''
   Gorbachev's 50-car motorcade reached Stanford University shortly
before noon, about an hour behind schedule. The Soviet leader, who
delivered a speech on global affairs at the campus, was greeted by
former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, university President
Donald Kennedy, and California's two U.S. senators, Alan Cranston
and Pete Wilson.
   As he walked across campus, two students in the cheering audience
held up a sign reading, ``Gorby 4 President.''
   He waded into the audiences at various times, shaking hands,
clapping and clasping his own hands, smiling, and through an
interpreter telling a woman in a wheelchair with a video camera,
``You are so well-equipped.''
   ``I shook his hand. ... It was amazing. He was definitely just a
real person, but he was Gorbachev. He was leading the pack, hoping
his bodyguards could keep up,'' said Alex Levy, a 21-year-old
political science major.
   ``He was great. He came up and grabbed my hand,'' added Erik
Jorgensen.
   ``I think sometime in the future we'll all be united together in
one big team,'' said Louie Arciga.
   But hundreds of demonstrators remained immune from the
``Gorbymania'' gripping others.
   Protesters, supporting independence for Lithuania and other
Baltic states and angered over alleged human rights violations in
the republics, said they were trying to show the American public
that Gorbachev isn't a hero.
   ``People have been so much taken by their Gorbymania that I don't
think many are hearing us. The people have been taken by the charm
of Gorby,'' said Lithuanian-born Algis Zemaitaitis, who drove six
hours from Santa Monica to join the protest at Stanford.
   As the Gorbachev motorcade rolled down Stanford University's Palm
Drive, the demonstrators intensified their chants of ``Out of the
Baltic states!''
   Onlookers, disgruntled that the protesters were blocking the view
of the Soviet leader, chanted in response, ``Out of the way!''
   In the face of the Soviet leader's visit, capitalism flourished
as some students who won a lottery for tickets to see Gorbachev
traded their prizes for fistfuls of hard cash from the wealthy.
   Other students scrambled to pick up some of the remaining tickets
that went unclaimed after the official university lottery last week
for the 1,700 seats at Gorbachev's talk and 6,000 others to the rest
of the events on his university visit.
   ``Gorbachev probably would have felt right at home this
morning,'' said Jorgensen, a 21-year-old student who waited for
tickets beginning at 2 a.m. ``The lines we stood in were very much
like the food lines in the Soviet Union.''
   Though Jorgensen hung onto his ticket, other students said they
had friends who scalped theirs for up to $1,400 each. There were
rumors passes had gone for up to $1,800 apiece.
   Two sophomores, Jeff Vierling, a 19-year-old electrical
engineering major, and Marlowe Johnson, a 21-year-old international
relations major, sat on a curb at the university Monday asking for
serious offers only of $1,000 or more cash for each of their two
tickets.
   The tickets are ``worth a great deal to me, but the only value
here is sentimental. I can probably see him better on TV,'' said
Johnson, who wants to finance a trip to Europe.
   Added Vierling: ``It's airplane tickets. It's a lot of things.
It's a CD player.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush said on Monday the United States
soon will pay its $62.5 million dues to the United Nations and plans
to deal with the huge unpaid bill to the world body accumulated
during Ronald Reagan's presidency.
   The subject of U.S. payments to the U.N. came up during a meeting
between Bush and U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar.
   Afterward, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
regards money owed to the U.N. as ``solemn international obligations
made by the United States after full consultation with Congress.''
   Beginning in 1985, the Reagan administration began withholding
some of its the U.S. dues to protest what it said was the U.N.'s
anti-Western bias, inefficiency and budget overruns.
   In September 1988, Reagan announced he was pleased with the world
body's progress toward budget reform, staff cutbacks and a new
spirit of consensus and cooperation. But he left the details of
paying the arrears to Bush.
   Bush said he hopes Congress will provide money to pay off
approximately $460 million in delinquent dues.
   Bush has proposed a five-year payoff scheme to Congress. U.S.
dues to the the U.N. run about $240 million. In addition to the
regular budget, there also are fees for peacekeeping activities.

   Temperatures dipped in parts of the Midwest on Monday and could
get cooler, while the southwest simmered and the central Gulf Coast
was slapped by thunderstorms.
   Rainshowers were scattered along the northern Pacific coast,
northern New England and parts of the mid-Atlantic coast.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 108 degrees in Palm Springs, Calif.
   Warm, humid weather reigned in the east and south, with
temperatures in the 70s and 80s.
   Readings climbed into the 90s in Florida and Texas. A record high
of 94 was set in Corpus Christi, topping a 1953 mark of 93. Daytona
Beach tied its 1985 record high of 95.
   Cloudy skies and northerly winds kept temperatures in the 40s,
50s and lower 60s across much of the upper Mississippi and Ohio
valleys, as well as the Great Lakes region. Temperatures could fall
further Tuesday.
   Thunderstorms ranged from the central Gulf Coast to Florida. A
severe storm dropped dime-size hail in northern Florida.
   The low temperature for the nation Monday morning was 31 degrees,
registered in Truckee, Calif., and Marquette, Mich.
   An overnight frost advisory was posted Monday for the northern
mountains of Pennsylvania, much of western and central New York
state and parts of Michigan, where lows were expected to fall into
low 30s.
   Most of the nation was expected to be sunny or partly sunny
Tuesday, with showers likely from North Dakota to Wisconsin and
along the Oregon and Washington coasts.
   A high wind warning was posted for Rocky Mountain areas in
northern Montana, where west winds gusted to 65 mph Monday afternoon.

   People by the tens of thousands jammed Hong
Kong's Victoria Park on Monday at a candlelight vigil in remembrance
of those killed in the suppression of China's pro-democracy movement
in June 1989.
   Commemorations also were held in Mongolia, France,
Czechoslovakia, Sweden Taiwan, Japan, Canada, Britain and the United
States.
   A hunger strike in May 1989 began the occupation of Beijing's
Tiananmen Square by student activists. It ended when the army
stormed the square June 3-4, killing hundreds _ perhaps thousands _
of protesters near the plaza.
   In Beijing on Monday, police with rifles blocked roads to the
university area and heavy security elsewhere in the capital ended
the possibility of any public dissent on the first anniversary of
the suppression.
   Police estimated 80,000 people attended the Hong Kong vigil,
where demonstrators sang patriotic songs and demanded China release
jailed dissidents. Rally organizers put the figure at about 150,000.
   The British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. China pledged
to retain Hong Kong's capitalistic and legal systems for 50 years
after the takeover, but fear mounted in the territory that Beijing
may renege on its promises.
   Rally organizers laid wreaths and screened videotapes of Chinese
dissidents in exile during the three-hour rally, urging local
residents not to forget the Beijing massacre.
   Many wept at the speeches.
   Student leader Wu'er Kaixi, who escaped to the West after the
crackdown, said from Paris, ``There are many children like us who
are unable to see our parents. Please remember we have a long road
ahead.''
   In Paris, seven protesters outside the Chinese Embassy continued
to refuse food Monday after an overnight vigil. Dozens of bouquets
of white flowers were delivered to them.
   Yvon Thomas, a 19-year-old student participating in the symbolic
36-hour fast, said he was horrified by the Tiananmen events and ``I
decided to do something concrete for the anniversary, so that we
won't forget what happened, and that political prisoners in China
may be released.''
   A group of dissidents, including Wu'er, tried to deliver a letter
seeking a meeting with embassy officials but police kept them away.
   In the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, 20 Mongolian students
protested Monday outside the Chinese Embassy, staging an hourlong
sit-in to deliver a petition, the East German news agency ADN
reported. They left after pasting on the mission's wall a poster
condemning the June 4 bloodshed, ADN said.
   The official Vatican Radio marked the anniversary with a
commentary. ``A year has passed, the entire world hasn't forgotten
and still wants to have hope and faith in China,'' it said.
   The state news agency CTK said hundreds of youths in
Czechoslovakia observed the anniversary, including students who took
part in demonstrations last year that contributed to the downfall of
the nation's Communist regime.
   CTK said no incidents were reported as the demonstration wound
its way from Old Town Square in central Prague to the Chinese
Embassy, where it dispersed.
   In Stockholm, hundreds of Swedes demonstrated Monday downtown and
outside the Chinese Embassy.
   In Taiwan, organizers set up an altar for last June's victims at
a rally in a park attended by about 400 Taiwanese standing in the
rain.
   Demonstrators in Tokyo gathered in a park with wreaths and
banners saying, ``Long live freedom and democracy in Tiananmen
Square'' and ``The June 4 massacre is the world's shame.''
   Rallies were held in cities across the United States, Britain and
Canada.

   President Bush said Monday that China continues
to violate human rights a year after the Tiananmen Square massacre,
but a Democratic leader said Bush is all talk and no action on the
issue.
   Bush incurred the wrath of many members of Congress last month by
extending for a year most-favored-nation trading status under which
Beijing receives low tariffs on its goods.
   On Monday, Bush issued a statement critical of Chinese leaders,
calling on them to ``turn decisively away from repression.'' But he
did not alter his stance on trade benefits to China.
   Bush said his administration values ``good relations with the
Chinese people and government'' and is ready ``to develop this
relationship as China resumes a ... path of reform.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell also used the anniversary
to speak out on the issue, reiterating Democratic complaints that
Bush actually is lending support to Beijing by continuing it
most-favored trade status.
   ``The Chinese people must be told that the president's silence
does not represent the view of all Americans,'' Mitchell said.
   Diane Dewhirst, Mitchell's spokeswoman, said later that the
majority leader had not seen the president's statement and would
have no comment.
   Bush, a former U.S. envoy to China, praised China for reforms
undertaken from 1978 to 1988, but said he remained ``deeply
concerned by the lack of respect for internationally recognized
human rights in China today, and urge a rapid return to the more
positive course set before Tiananmen occurred.''
   He said the Chinese government, in suppressing demonstrations,
was denying its citizens ``the freedom of expression, freedom of the
press and freedom of association.''
   ``These are freedoms that are enshrined in both the U.S.
Constitution and the Chinese Constitution,'' Bush said.
   Some sanctions Bush imposed on China in the aftermath of the
Tiananmen Square crackdown, including a ban on military sales,
remain in force.
   Mitchell, who said it was a mistake to renew the
most-favored-nation status, said he would try to block the extension
when Congress returns Tuesday from its Memorial Day recess.
   ``Students in Beijing have risked their freedom and perhaps even
their lives to demonstrate their memory of last year's events,''
Mitchell said. ``Americans know that if we let this anniversary go
by unmarked, we will share in the shame the Chinese government
brought on itself.''
   More than 1,000 people reportedly were killed in the crackdown
June 4, 1989.
   Mitchell plans to meet with dissident students later this week.
   One of those dissidents, a 24-year-old woman who hid from Chinese
authorities for 10 months after leading student protests in
Tiananmen Square, appealed Monday for American and international
pressure to curb human rights abuses in her homeland.
   Chai Ling said at a news conference that she wants to meet with
Bush to tell him that his decision to renew the most-favored-nation
status disappointed the survivors of China's democracy movement.
   ``I plea to the people of the world: You must not forget those
who gave up their lives for freedom and democracy; let your words of
support be heard,'' she said.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee joined about 150 lawmakers in signing a
letter asking Chinese Prime Minister Li Peng to release jailed
protesters, halt torture, prohibit secret executions and stop using
lethal force against peaceful demonstrators. The letter was drafted
by Amnesty International
   Elsewhere, the anniversary was marked in this country with
demonstrations in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Salt Lake City. Some
200-300 people attended those rallies.
   In New York, Lu Jing-hua, a participant in the Tiananmen uprising
last year, tried without success to deliver a pro-democracy letter
to the Chinese mission to the United Nations on Monday.
   ``I've never once regretted taking part,'' she said. ``My
experience was the most significant action of my life and gave me a
taste of freedom.''

   A lawyer whose private plane crashed into
the Atlantic last year with him wounded at the controls was charged
Monday with 455 counts of securities fraud and related charges.
   A Nash County grand jury returned indictments with a total of
2,695 counts against Thomas Root, Sonrise Management Services,
Telemedia Inc. and three other men identified as co-owners of the
two businesses.
   The charges stem from claims allegedly made by Sonrise that
investors would get help applying for federal licenses for radio
stations.
   In announcing the indictment, North Carolina Secretary of State
Rufus Edmisten said only a handful of the company's investors ever
received licenses from the Federal Communications Commission.
   Root's attorney, Eugene Propper, said from Washington, D.C., he
couldn't comment in detail on the indictment, ``except to say that
my client is not guilty of any securities fraud.''
   The companies named no longer maintain offices in the area.
   Edmisten said: ``In all, 1,018 people in North Carolina
contributed more than $8 million to this organization. Nationally,
more than $16 million was invested by people from 25 states.''
   Root, a Washington-area lawyer who has been indicted on federal
charges involving his work for Sonrise, drew national attention in
July 1989 after he reported blacking out in the cockpit of his
single-engine plane on a flight from Washington to Rocky Mount.
   He was followed by military planes during the 800-mile odyssey
down the East Coast which ended when he crashed in Bahamian waters
off Florida. Rescuers pulled Root from the ocean and discovered he
had been shot in the abdomen.
   It was never determined exactly how he was injured.
   Root told investigators he could recall nothing after reporting
by radio that he was having trouble breathing. He said he did not
know how he got shot, but said the wound was not self-inflicted.
   Edmisten said his office, which regulates the securities industry
in North Carolina, had been investigating Sonrise for more than two
years.
   The others charged were SMS Chairman Ralph Savage, SMS President
Eugene White and Carl Hurlebaus, who is co-owner of Telemedia Inc.
with White and Savage.

   The mother of a slaying victim allegedly
pulled a gun from her purse in a packed courtroom Monday and fired
at her daughter's accused killer from the witness stand.
   Pearl Marie Abraham was charged with attempted murder after she
allegedly fired a single shot from a .38-caliber pistol at Stuart
Martin Elliott during the third day of his murder trial in Lincoln
County Circuit Court.
   Elliott, 25, of Hamlin is charged with killing Mrs. Abraham's
daughter and raping her 10-year-old granddaughter in September.
   Witnesses said prosecutor Jay Hoke had just finished questioning
Mrs. Abraham when she pulled the gun from her handbag. The bullet
hit the defense table and ricocheted into a door, but missed
everyone in the standing-room-only courtroom.
   Mrs. Abraham of West Hamlin was subdued by a bailiff and the
chaotic courtroom was cleared.
   The judge ordered court officials to refrain from discussing the
attack with the press; this account is compiled from witnesses
reports and the complaint filed by state police.
   Elliott suffered a twisted knee in the brief melee. He was
treated at Boone Memorial Hospital in Madison and returned to jail.
   Lincoln County Magistrate Helen McCormick released Mrs. Abraham
after she posted $25,000 bond. She was whisked away by family
members through a rear door without commenting to reporters.
   Elliott is accused of murder, sexual assault, two counts of
attempted murder and attempted arson in the death of Annette Abraham
and the attack on the girl.
   State police said presiding Judge W. Jack Stevens told officers
to refer all questions to Hoke until it could be determined at a
meeting scheduled for Tuesday morning whether the shooting would
force a mistrial.
   Hoke was unavailable in his courthouse office and his private law
office Monday afternoon.
   Elliott's attorneys contend that co-defendant Danny Ray Dotson,
43, of Carlisle, Pa., committed the crimes while Elliott watched in
a drunken stupor. Dotson is scheduled to be tried in late June.

   Mayor Jack Kinman was too busy leading
cleanup efforts Monday to mourn six neighbors and the loss of his
home in a tornado that tore through this southwest Indiana city last
weekend.
   ``We haven't had any time to worry about our loss. We just have
to think about everybody here,'' said Kinman, 70.
   Petersburg was hit hardest by weekend storms that left 14 people
dead throughout the Midwest and caused damage as far south as Texas.
All of Petersburg's 3,000 residents were without water Monday.
   President Bush on Monday authorized federal disaster assistance
to 19 Indiana counties ravaged by floods last month and tornadoes
during the weekend.
   Gov. Richard Celeste of Ohio asked for similar assistance to two
counties in his state.
   After a tour of the stricken area on Sunday, Indiana Gov. Evan
Bayh said Petersburg looked like it had been bombed.
   Saturday's tornado turned Kinman's house on its foundation and
tore off the roof. Next door, the duplex where Giles Evans and Emma
Willis lived was leveled. They were among six people in the
Petersburg area who died in the storm.
   ``Those two were wonderful people,'' Kinman said. ``I've lived
here all my life, so of course I knew them all.''
   Eight people died in Indiana as a result of tornadoes that drove
across central and southern portions of the state Saturday night.
Two boys, ages 6 and 8, died Sunday in a second wave of storms that
spawned one tornado.
   The weekend storms also were blamed for two deaths in Wisconsin
and one each in Illinois and Missouri. Tornadoes also were reported
in Minnesota, Kentucky and Michigan.
   In Indiana, the American Red Cross estimated that 824 homes were
damaged, including 240 that were destroyed. In Petersburg alone, 114
homes were destroyed and 270 sustained more moderate damage.
   In Kentucky, 47 homes were damaged and a spokesman for the state
Department of Disaster and Emergency Services said storm destruction
could total as much as $5 million statewide.
   In Ohio, at least 1,600 homes and businesses in three
southwestern counties were damaged.
   Kinman said the scope of the tragedy was difficult to comprehend.
   ``I think most people are still stunned. They're in a state of
shock,'' he said.
   About 5,000 homes and business in Petersburg and Bedford, which
also was heavily damaged, were without electric service, said Pamela
K. Chapman, a spokeswoman for PSI Energy. She said power would be
restored to most areas by Tuesday.
   For the third consecutive week, Petersburg residents were urged
to boil all drinking water once service was restored. The city lost
its fresh water supply two weeks ago when floodwater broke the main
water line.
   In Petersburg and Bedford, people sorted through rubble and
carried away debris. A steady stream of dump trucks hauled away tree
limbs.
   The Red Cross and several churches offered meals and drinking
water.
   Mark Kraner, a Red Cross spokesman in Bedford, said the agency
was making an appeal for donations.
   ``We're not asking for clothing or food,'' Kraner said. ``We want
money so the money can come back into the local economy.''
   Two radio stations in Bloomington, 60 miles to the northeast,
launched a fund-raiser for victims. Vince Garmon, a spokesman for
WTTS-WGCL, said about $10,000 had been raised.
   ``Everybody's pulling together,'' said Valerie Zimmerman of
Petersburg. ``We have to or nobody will make it.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. Mario Cuomo was nominated Monday to run
for a third term, but some at the state Democratic convention
wondered if he'd serve out the term if re-elected or take a run at
the White House.
   With the convention band breaking into ``I Love New York,'' the
57-year-old governor was nominated by acclamation.
   Cuomo, considered a potential 1992 Democratic presidential
candidate was scheduled to address the delegates Tuesday.
   Last week, New York Republicans chose Manhattan economist and
businessman Pierre Rinfret, a political unknown, to challenge Cuomo.
   Making appearances at the convention were New York Mayor David
Dinkins, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and former vice presidential
candidate Geraldine Ferraro, who spoke out for abortion rights.
   The former Queens congresswoman who ran on the 1984 Democratic
presidential ticket with Walter Mondale is considering a 1992 run
for the U.S. Senate seat currently held by Republican Alfonse
D'Amato.
   Another speaker was actor Christopher Reeve, who pressed for
greater efforts to clean up the environment.
   Most speakers stressed the party's goal of claiming majority
control of the Republican-dominated state Senate.
   Delegates nominated Lt. Gov. Stan Lundine to run again with
Cuomo. If re-elected, it would be Lundine's second term as
lieutenant governor.
   The governor, refusing to rule out a possible bid for the
presidency in 1992, announced his re-election plans Sunday. He
considered a presidential campaign in 1988, but ultimately bowed out.
   Ms. Ferraro said Democrats nationwide favor Cuomo.
   ``They believe that he can be the person who can carry the
Democrats to the White House in 1992,'' she said of party followers
she's met across the country.

   Convicted Colombian drug kingpin Carlos
Lehder Rivas says he wrote letters to Mikhail Gorbachev and
President Bush to gripe about prison conditions.
   Lehder, a onetime leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel, told
Bush the presidential dog Millie lives better than he does and urged
Gorbachev to visit the federal prison in Marion, Ill., which he
called the American ``Gulag.''
   Marion spokesman Joe Snoddy said Lehder receives the same
treatment as other prisoners at the high security prison.
   Copies of the letters, dated May 28, 1990, were mailed to The
Associated Press by Lehder.
   Lehder is serving a life term plus 135 years for smuggling more
than 20 tons of cocaine into the United States in the late 1970s.
   At Marion, he is confined to a 8-foot by 9{-foot cell and is
allowed seven hours of exercise a week, Snoddy said.
   It is the nation's only federal lockup designated a ``high
security'' prison, meaning about two-thirds of the inmates are never
allowed to mix with other inmates, Snoddy said.
   In his letter to Bush, he complained he has been ``subjected to a
constant battery of psychological torture and sensory deprivation as
a matter of official treatment here.''
   The letter to Gorbachev was mailed to the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, he said.
   ``I, Carlos Lehder, as a socio-political prisoner, knowledgable
of your paramount defense of Human Rights and the under-privileged
of the World ... wish to invite Your Excellency, and the Soviet News
Media, to visit the American `Gulag,' known as Marion,'' he wrote.
   The ``Gulag'' statement referred to the infamous Soviet system of
prisons and work camps where thousands died during the Stalin era.
   In his letter to Bush, Lehder said dogs deserve better treatment.
   ``I submit Mr. President, that if someone were to confine your
lovely dog, Millie in a solitary cell for three years; you would see
those responsible for such acts were arrested and punished for
animal cruelty,'' he wrote in the letter that bears his signature, a
Marion postmark and a prison stamp.
   Lehder was extradited to Florida in February 1987 and convicted
in May 1988 of smuggling tons of cocaine into the United States.
   He recently filed a federal suit in Jacksonville claiming prison
officials were prohibiting him from exercising, studying and
learning German.
   Snoddy said the only foreign language taught at Marion is Spanish.

<HEAD>Election Official Accuses Carter of Intervention</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior election
official on Monday accused former U.S. President Jimmy Carter of
intervening in Domincan affairs and of being partial to ex-President
Juan Bosch, who says fraud marred the May 16 elections.
   President Joaquin Balaguer held a slim, 21,694-vote lead over
Bosch in unofficial results, which gave Balaguer 669,063 votes;
Bosch, 647,369; and Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, a former Santo
Domingo mayor, 438,647.
   Carter was one of 30 international observers here for the
balloting. He was invited by Froilan Tavares, president of the
Central Election Board.
   On Monday, Tavares said Carter was ``misinformed'' by aides who
observed a review of tally sheets, carried out last week to
determine if there was fraud.
   Bosch, 80, had accused Balaguer, 83 and blind from glaucoma, of
``colossal fraud'' and said Tavares was in league with the
president, who has served five terms in this Caribbean nation of 7
million people.
   Tavares on Monday suspended the tally review, saying a survey of
60 percent of the totals showed no errors or evidence of fraud. He
said the review was not mandatory under the country's election law.
   The next step would be for the Election Board to announce an
official winner, an action that can be formally challenged by Bosch.
   Tavares said Carter was ``misinformed by his inexperienced''
representatives Mark Feierstein and Alejandro Canton, of the
Atlanta-based Carter Institute. He said the two ``met only officials
from one party and gave Carter wrong and biased information.''
   He scolded Carter for writing Balaguer a letter on May 22 that
``ignored the autonomy'' of the Election Board and was a ``virtual
intervention in the internal affairs of our country.''
   The contents of the letter were not divulged.
   Before returning home, Carter said the thin lead made it
impossible to determine a winner and recommended the tally sheets be
scrutinized for possible ``fraud or honest errors.''
   Several international observers and Dominican politicians have
accused Balaguer's Social Christian Reformist Party of buying votes
and questioned delays in vote-counting.

   Spiritual leader Ali Khamenei said Monday
that Iran will follow the path set by Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
but Iranians showed relatively little enthusiasm on the first
anniversary of the patriarch's death.
   ``Death to America!'' blared loudspeakers. ``Death to Israel!''
   Inside the shrine that marks Khomeini's grave, mourners listened
as speakers recited Koranic verses. The gray-bearded Khomeini stared
sternly at the crowd from pictures hung on pillars.
   ``While There Is Islam, We Will Not Forget The Imam'' read one
banner. Khomeini was considerd the imam, or supreme spiritual leader.
   Addressing the crowd, Khamenei said: ``The imam's line is that
same line which we pledge to follow.''
   Khomeini was 86 when he died June 3, 10 years after his Islamic
revolution toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. He was buried at the
shrine in the Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, 10 miles south of Tehran.
   The first anniversary of Khomeini's death stood in sharp contrast
to the bizarre outpouring of grief during his June 6 funeral last
year. At that time, 6 million frenzied mourners poured into the
streets, pounding their heads with clenched fists, beating their
chests and scratching their faces to draw blood.
   Monday's event, the culmination of a four-day mourning period,
brought about 3 million people to the shrine on the outskirts of
Tehran, according to foreign reporters who flew over the scene in
helicopters. That was far fewer than expected.
   Iran's official news media, however, said 8-9 million people
participated.
   Tehran, normally a hodgepodge of activity, was quiet and streets
were deserted. Many residents apparently preferred to stay home than
go to the shrine.
   At Khomeini's tomb, the atmosphere was that of a social gathering.
   Only a few mourners beat their chests in the traditional Shiite
Moslem expression of grief, although larger groups of mourners would
occasionally tap their chests in symbolic fashion.
   Inside the shrine, segregated by sex, a few people fainted in 90
degree heat and guards sprayed water to cool the crowd. At
Khomeini's funeral, about 28,000 people passed out because of heat,
dehydration or exhaustion.
   Disabled men in wheelchairs, reminders of the Iran-Iraq war, were
pushed into the shrine by Revolutionary Guards wearing black
armbands to mark the occasion.
   A young soldier with blisters on his feet from three days of
walking to reach the shrine said: ``I came last year, and I had to
come again this year.''
   Thousands of mourners were bused in from villages, towns and
other cities. Soldiers and other civil servants were ordered to
attend the ceremonies. Hundreds of Shiites also came from Pakistan,
India, Syria, and Lebanon.
   Iranian television, which broadcast live coverage of the funeral
last year, did not broadcast any of the events live.
   In commemorations elsewhere, hundreds of mourners gathered inside
the mosque at Khomeini's home in Jamaran sobbing and beating
themselves as they looked at a chair on a small balcony from which
Khomeini would address his people.
   The ayatollah had long suffered heart problems and died after
surgery for intestinal bleeding.
   A year after his death, many followers who participated in the
Islamic revolution have become disillusioned, disgruntled with high
inflation, official corruption and the unfulfilled promises of the
revolution.
   Most of the economic woes are from the eight-year war with Iraq
and from Khomeini's implacable anti-Western stance, which blocked
foreign investment and Western technology.
   Khomeini's staunch followers, such as his only surviving son,
Ahmad, an important figure in the so-called radical camp within the
leadership, want no deviation from his teachings.
   But others, such as President Hashemi Rafsanjani, have indicated
they want revolutionary fervor dampened in favor of economic
reconstruction.
   In a veiled attack on proponents of that policy, Ahmad told
ideologically committed Revolutionary Guards recently: ``Do not
deviate from the imam's path. If others do, I trust you will not let
them.''
   Meanwhile, the largest exile Iranian opposition group, the
Mujahedeen Khalq, said in asociated Press in
Nicosia, Cyprus, there were anti-government demonstrations in Iran.
   In the telex from its office in Baghdad, the group said clashes
between students and government sec telex to The Asurity forces were reported
in
Tehran, Tabriz, Esfahan and Orumiyeh. It said at least 300 students
were arrested in Orumiyeh.
   The government did not comment on the reports and there was no
immediate way to verify them.

   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney met with the 10
provincial premiers on Monday for the third time io seize buses and terminals
as the company struggled into the
fourth month of a drivers' strike.
   Officials said the filing would not affect service at the only
nationwide bus company.
   ``We have taken this action to enable Greyhound lines to continue
operation of its of its total system,'' said J. Michael Doyle,
senior vice president and chief financial officer.
   The petition was filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Texas in Brownsville.
   The filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code allows
the company to continue operating under court supervision while it
tries to reorganize its finances and pay off creditors.
   Union officials were not immediately available to comment on the
bankruptcy filing.
   Greyhound has been struggling since bus drivers walked out March
2. The company has been operating a reduced schedule, but the sliced
revenue and increased expenses of fighting the strike have siphoned
off cash needed to operate.
   The company lost $56 million in the first quarter. It has missed
more than $16 million in principal, interest and lease payments
since the end of April, putting it in default on numerous agreements
with creditors.
   ``In the past few days, there has been a lot of pressure by
creditors'' who own buses and terminals that the company leases,
said President Frank Schmieder.
   ``We tried to stay out (of bankruptcy) as long as possible,''
Schmieder said.
   ``There will be no interruption of service,'' Doyle said, adding
that the company had asked the bankruptcy court to honor tickets
already purchased.
   ``For the passengers, (bankruptcy) ought to be pretty
transparent,'' Schmieder said. ``The network is up in full and we're
going to need all the employees that we currently have.''
   Two weeks ago, the company proposed repurchasing $225 million of
its junk bond debt at a steep discount, provided it could find
enough financing to pay about $90 million for the bonds and leave
the company with about $35 million in operating capital.
   ``We have asked creditors for patience so that we could devote
all available resources to running maximum service during the peak
summer travel season,'' Doyle said.
   ``While most have been cooperative, we were faced with the threat
of a `run on assets' that could have crippled our ability to
operate,'' he said.
   ``We are highly confident we will be successful in restructuring
our debt,'' Doyle added.
   Schmieder said negotiations are continuing on financing the debt
restructuring, but ``it will take longer now because the courts will
have to approve any financial restructuring.''
   The company did not estimate when it hoped to emerge from court
supervision.
   The filing covers Greyhound and five subsidiaries including Eagle
Bus Manufacturing Co., which is based in Brownsville. The other
subsidiaries are GLI Bus Operations Holding Co., BusLease Inc.,
Trailways Commuter Transit Inc. and GLI Food Services Inc.
   Most of Greyhound's 6,300 drivers walked out over wages and job
security. The company has been operating a reduced schedule with
nearly 3,000 newly hired drivers.
   After attempts to reopen negotiations collapsed early last month,
Chairman Fred G. Currey said May 7 the strike had become
``irrelevant'' because the carrier had enough drivers to operate.
   Just two weeks later, however, the company acknowledged severe
financial difficulties and said the proposed repurchase of junk
bonds was necessary to avert bankruptcy.
   The company's total debt stood at $384 million at the end of
March. The debt is the legacy of a leveraged buyout three years ago
led by Currey that took the company private.
   Currey and other investors paid $270 million for the bus
operations of Greyhound Corp., since renamed Greyhound Dial Corp. A
few months later they paid an additional $80 million for
Dallas-based Trailways Lines Inc., then the nation's largest
operator of Trailways buses.
   Greyhound's future also was clouded recently by a finding by the
National Labor Relations Board that Greyhound engaged in unfair
labor practices by implementing its contract proposal immediately
after the strike began.
   An administrative law judge has scheduled hearings on the matter
in Milwaukee on Sept. 17. The procedure could result in the bus
company being forced to pay about $10 million a month in back wages.
Greyhound has said it is confident it will win once the case gets in
court.

   The Bronx will get its own telephone area code _
917 _ in 1992 under a plan filed Monday with the Public Service
Commission, leaving Manhattan with sole use of existing area code
212.
   The new code is necessary because available numbers in the 212
area code, now shared by the Bronx and Manhattan, could run out by
1993, New York Telephone officials said.
   The phone company said the telephone numbers in the 212 area code
are disappearing quickly because of growth in businesses that use
computers, facsimile machines, cellular telephones and pagers.

   Heaps of dead cows lay scattered in the field, with the surviving

   ``This is a very severe loss. It's just one of those things a

said National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Comeaux.

   Despite Mikhail S. Gorbachev's note of
urgency, there will be plenty of opportunities in the Soviet Union
later for companies unwilling to deploy their dollars now, one big
Soviet trading partner said Monday.
   ``It always pays one to be first,'' said Whitney MacMillan,
chairman of Cargill Inc., the giant commodities company that is the
Soviets' largest private trading partner. But, he said, ``the facts
are that the opportunities won't disappear.''
   John Block, former U.S. agriculture secretary, agreed.
   ``The first wave that goes in there is vitally important,'' Block
said. ``But that doesn't mean there won't be a second wave. They'll
need a second and third wave as the economy progresses.''
   In a 90-minute meeting Sunday in Minneapolis, the Soviet leader
told about 100 business leaders that ``those who are with us at this
time have a good prospect of cooperation in our great country.''
   Then he added: ``But those who just stand on the sidelines, who
do not want to risk, who want to wait and see, who don't want to
risk their dollars, well, they will remain, I think, observers for
years to come.
   ``We'll make sure that that is so,'' Gorbachev said.
   Robert Price, a former chief executive officer of Control Data
Corp., which has long had a relationship with the Soviet Union, said
the inability to convert rubles to dollars or other hard currency
must be overcome if Gorbachev is to win new U.S. investment in his
country.
   ``Everything is the money problem,'' Price said. ``He (Gorbachev)
can't wish it to go away. He can't and we can't.''
   Gorbachev said help from U.S. companies in management,
agriculture, transportation, medicine and computer technology is
needed to stabilize the U.S.S.R. as it moves to a market-driven
economy.
   ``I think he is just stating a true fact of human life. That
loyalty is important,'' said Dwayne Andreas, chief executive officer
of Archer Daniels Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill. ``It brings to my
mind the girl who says `I'm going to go home with the man who
brought me.'''
   Cargill's MacMillan said he did not take Gorbachev's remark
seriously. Opportunities in the Soviet Union will grow, he said, as
the decision-making process becomes decentralized _ thus reducing
the possibility of bureaucratic revenge.
   ``I took it that they are eager for investment. And I guess I
take it much as a statement of fact rather than a threat,'' said
Allen Jacobson, chief executive officer of 3M Co. ``If you don't get
in early to most places, you get left out.''
   But business leaders with less experience in U.S.-Soviet trade
were more shaken by Gorbachev's remark.
   ``They do try to keep track of who they consider their friends,''
said Winston Wallin, chairman of Minneapolis-based Medtronic Inc.,
the world's largest maker of cardiac pacemakers. ``He did say it in
kind of a humorous way, but it did have a little teeth in it.''
   Dwight Opperman, chief executive officer of West Publishing Inc.
in St. Paul, said companies that don't invest in the Soviet economy
now may indeed be left out when the country is prospering.
   ``Help him now and you may get in on the golden pot at the end of
the rainbow,'' said Opperman, whose company has never done business
in the Soviet Union. ``It's a carrot. You give him a carrot and a
whip both.''
   Curt Carlson, founder of Minnesota-based Carlson Companies, said
it would be unfair for the Soviets to discriminate in the future
against companies not ready to answer his call for help because
current conditions for trade between the United States and Soviet
Union are difficult.

   Hea Kim was at the counter of her family's
store Monday, watching television coverage of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to the San Francisco Bay area, when in
walked Raisa Gorbachev.
   ``I didn't know about it at all,'' Mrs. Kim said of the Soviet
first lady's impromptu shopping stop. ``I was surprised.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev, scrapping announced plans, suddenly embarked on
her own whirlwind tour of San Francisco, including a visit to the
New Terrace Market in the Twin Peaks neighborhood.
   Accompanied by an interpreter and several Secret Service men,
Mrs. Gorbachev spent about 10 minutes asking Mrs. Kim questions and
doing a bit of comparison shopping as her limousine drew a crowd of
onlookers.
   ``I think she was just checking the items we carry in this small
market,'' Mrs. Kim said of the store she and her husband own and
operate in an upscale neighborhood.
   ``She looked at what items we carry and how they move. Especially
the fresh and frozen foods,'' she added.
   Mrs. Gorbachev also specifically checked the market's supply of
vodka.
   ``I think she wanted to know if we carry Stolichnaya,'' Mrs. Kim
said of the popular brand imported from the Soviet Union. ``Then she
looked at the Smirnoff, the kind made in the U.S.''
   The wife of the Soviet leader wanted to know why there were only
a few bottles of Stolichnaya left on the market's shelves.
   ``I told her it was because Stolichnaya is the best-selling vodka
we have,'' Mrs. Kim said. ``She smiled.''
   Mrs. Gorbachev also was interested in bread, asking Mrs. Kim
about her customers' preferences and learning they prefer
whole-wheat to white.
   Despite her interest in the merchandise, Mrs. Gorbachev didn't
buy anything and explained through the interpreter that she couldn't
take anything from the store with her, as Mrs. Kim offered.
   But the Soviet first lady left plenty of friends behind.
   ``She was very friendly, and she's very pretty ... and she held
my hand afterward,'' Mrs. Kim said.
   Patty Corwin, who lives nearby and shops at the Kims, was about
to pick up her children from school when she noticed the limousine
outside the market. She went with a neighbor to investigate and saw
Mrs. Gorbachev leave the store.
   Mrs. Gorbachev spent a few minutes outside talking with
neighborhood residents and construction workers from nearby
condominium projects who gathered as close as security personnel
would allow.
   ``She walked around and shook my hand and shook my neighbor's
hand,'' Mrs. Corwin said, adding, ``She said something like `Pleased
to meet you' '' in English.

<HEAD>Judge Rules That L.A. County Discriminated Against Hispanic
Community</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors
violated the rights of Hispanics in 1981 by drawing voting districts
that keep them from getting elected, a federal judge ruled Monday.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon, ruling in a voting rights case,
said the board's five members conspired to ``protect their
incumbencies and that of their allies'' when they redrew the
county's five voting districts in 1981.
   In so doing, Kenyon said, the supervisors violated the 1965
federal Voting Rights Act and the equal protection clause of the
14th Amendment to the Constitution.
   Hispanics make up about 35 percent of the county's 8.7 million
people. No member of any minority group has been elected to the
board since 1875.
   The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the
American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California
expressed jubilation at the ruling and demanded the results of two
elections set for Tuesday be invalidated.
   County Counsel DeWitt Clinton was in budget hearings Monday and
unavailable for comment. But Fifth District Supervisor Mike
Antonovich, who is not up for re-election, said the ruling would be
appealed.
   MALDEF, the civil liberties group and the U.S. Justice Department
had sued in 1988, accusing the supervisors of deliberately spreading
the Hispanic population across several districts to keep Hispanics
from getting elected.
   ``This is truly a great and historic day,'' said Marc Rosenbaum,
an attorney for the civil liberties group.
   ``For 115 years, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has
been an exclusive male, all-white club. Today that club membership
is open to everyone.''
   In Washington, U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh hailed the
decision ``as a victory against discrimination in the most important
role citizens play in our democracy _ the right to vote in free and
fair elections in districts drawn without bias.''
   Representatives of both sides said it wasn't immediately clear
how the issue will be resolved.
   MALDEF officials said they would demand the immediate creation of
a largely Hispanic district.
   ``We want a remedy that encompasses a fair opportunity for our
community to represent itself and to elect representatives who will
represent its interests,'' said Antonia Hernandez, president and
general counsel for MALDEF.
   She and Rosenbaum also said new elections should be held in the
First and Third supervisorial districts, where voting takes place
Tuesday.
   Ed Edelman, who is seeking re-election in the Third District,
declined comment on Kenyon's ruling.
   In the First District, retiring Supervisor Pete Schabarum said he
had not read Kenyon's decision. ``I continue to believe, however,
that district lines should not be based on ethnic factors,'' he
said, ``and I find it incredulous that a 1981 plan can be overturned
based on 1990 demographics.''
   In his ruling, the judge concluded that Hispanics and
non-Hispanics are widely polarized when it comes to voting.
Hispanics vote in large numbers for fellow Hispanics, he said, and
non-Hispanics rarely vote for Hispanics.
   ``Given the estimated levels of polarization, including the
effects of non-Hispanic bloc voting, an Hispanic candidate is unable
to be elected to the board under the current configuration of
supervisorial districts,'' Kenyon said.

<HEAD>Woman Says She Was Charged to Say in Homeless Shelter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TRUMBULL, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who angered neighbors and got in
trouble with zoning authorities for taking in homeless mothers
charged the young women, despite repeated claims to be sheltering
them for free, a former resident says.
   Charlene Luther, a 22-year-old unwed mother, also said Donna
Russell told her to give a phony address to Bridgeport's Welfare
Department so she could continue to receive welfare checks after she
moved to Russell's home in Trumbull.
   Luther, who stayed at the house during her pregnancy from January
to March, said in Sunday's Bridgeport Post that Russell charged her
and two other pregnant residents one-third of their monthly welfare
checks and took their food stamps and other assistance.
   ``It was a requirement of living there,'' Luther said. ``We were
no more than maids who cooked and cleaned for Russell and her two
sons, and a way to pay the bills.''
   Russell on Monday denied the allegations. ``We're in the process
of preparing a rebuttal,'' she said.
   In an interview in April, Russell said she had been ``called by
the Lord'' to open her house to the homeless. She said that she was
not charging families to live with her but that they bought some of
their own food.
   Last week, on the nationally syndicated TV show ``Hard Copy,''
she said, ``Those girls have not paid five cents to live in that
house.''
   Town zoning officials, acting on a complaint from a neighbor, had
ordered her to stop taking in young homeless mothers and had
threatened her with arrest.
   The Zoning Board of Appeals scheduled a hearing for Wednesday on
Russell's request for a variance to continue using her house as a
shelter.
   The zoning law in this community of 33,000 requires that
three-quarters of the people living in a single-family dwelling be
related by blood, marriage or adoption.

   A man accused of belonging to an anti-Castro
terrorist group was arrested Monday in the 1981 bombing of the
Mexican consulate in Miami.
   Jose Ignacio Gonzalez, 48, was arrested by FBI agents at Miami
International Airport after he was expelled from Guatemala, the FBI
announced.
   Arrest warrants described Gonzalez as a leader of Omega 7, a
militant group opposed to Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   Gonzalez had been sought since 1984 in the bombing of the Mexican
consulate in Miami and other charges. He was the last member of the
group at large, the FBI said.
   Gonzalez is accused of planting the bomb that heavily damaged the
consulate Sept. 11, 1981. He is also charged with transporting a
bomb to the Nicaraguan consulate in Miami on Sept. 2, 1982, but the
device didn't explode.
   Omega 7 claimed responsibility for a bombing the same day at the
Venezuelan consulate in Miami.
   The FBI has said Gonzalez, a U.S. citizen, fled to Central
America in 1984. He was taken into custody early Monday by
Guatemalan authorities.

<HEAD>Four Top Contra Leaders Demobilize</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EL ALMENDRO, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four high-ranking Contra leaders
demobilized on Monday and became representatives in government
ministries that will help rebel fighters return to civilian life.
   The four were the highest-ranking Contra leaders to demobilize,
but it appears total rebel disarmament by the June 10 deadline is
unlikely.
   An agreement signed by the Contras and the government on
Wednesday specifies Contra representation in government ministries.
   But the agreement to disarm at least 500 Contras a day has not
been met, and even if it were, half the contras would remain under
arms by June 10, the day agreed to by the rebels following talks
with the new government of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro.
   Top Contra leader Israel Galeano blamed the limited numbers of
U.N. peacekeeping troops and Organization of American States
officials, who have been processing rebels who want to disarm, for
the slow pace of the demobilization.
   But U.N. peacekeeper Lt. Col. Luis Alejandre, who is in charge of
Security Zone Six, said many Contras show up at the zone without
their weapons and are turned back.
   Alejandre said the rebels had probably buried their weapons.
   ``You can imagine the traffic in illegal weapons there would be''
if the U.N. troops accepted rebels who did not hand over a weapon,
Alejandre said.
   He said that since Sunday the Contras have started turning in
high quality weapons.
   ``The ones before were all rusted out,'' Alejandre said.
   Galeano said the Contras had left 7,000 weapons behind in
Honduran camps before returning to Nicaragua.
   The four Contra leaders who demobilized on Monday were: Miguel
Angel Sosa, the Contra army general staff inspector also known as
Commander Emiliano; Enrique Zelaya, the medical chief of staff also
known as Commander Henry or Dr. Henry; Contra political advisor
Bernardo Pastora; and political advisor Boanerge Matus.
   Zelaya, a medical doctor, is to join the Health Ministry, Sosa
and Pastora are to go to the Repatriation Institute, and Matus is to
join the Agrarian Reform Institute.
   Of an estimated 13,000 rebels, only about 4,000 have disarmed.
Galeano said that although it was unlikely that the demobilization
would be completed by June 10, ``we have embarked on an irreversible
process.''

   A prolific Mafia hitman who allegedly killed a
mob stool pigeon as a favor to reputed Gambino crime family boss
John Gotti was arrested along with some 30 members of his gang,
federal authorities said Monday.
   Thomas ``Tommy Karate'' Pitera, a 35-year-old martial arts expert
in the Bonanno crime family, headed a gang of killers and drug
dealers who dismembered their victims, stuffed them into suitcases
and plastic bags and buried them in a Staten Island bird sanctuary,
the authorities said.
   Federal authorities accused the defendants of at least seven
murders in the last three years and said they might be responsible
for about two dozen more.
   A raid of Pitera's Brooklyn apartment yielded a library of
underground publications with such titles as ``The Hitman's
Handbook'' and ``Kill or Be Killed.''
   Law enforcement authorities say Pitera carried out the 1988
assassination of Wilfred ``Willie Boy'' Johnson, who died in a
barrage of gunfire outside his Brooklyn home.
   The ex-boxer, gambler, loanshark and longtime associate of
Gotti's crew, reportedly turned informant in 1966 and provided reams
of information to law enforcement authorities over the years under
the code name Wahoo.
   ``Mr. Pitera believed he was doing a favor for John Gotti with
the extermination of Willie Boy Johnson,'' said Andrew J. Maloney,
U.S. attorney in Brooklyn.
   Pitera apparently carried out the hit to increase his prestige
and standing within the Bonanno family, the prosecutor said.
   Pitera was arrested Sunday. The others were picked up on Sunday
and Monday.
   The defendants were charged with numerous racketeering and drug
charges and face life in prison if convicted.
   Pitera and his associates allegedly dealt in large quantities of
cocaine, marijuana and heroin. They often arranged drug
transactions, but instead ripped off the suppliers ``and left the
bodies behind,'' Maloney said.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere of East
Germany will meet with President Bush in Washington on June 11
during his trip to the United States, the government news agency ADN
said Monday.
   De Maiziere scheduled his visit this week _ his first to America
as leader of East Germany's first democratically elected government
_ to speak to Jewish leaders in New York. He will leave Thursday and
return on June 12.
   Bush and de Maiziere likely will discuss the strategic future of
a united Germany. The two German states are to combine their
economies on July 2, but the global role of a united Germany has yet
to be resolved.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is scheduled to meet Bush at
the White House on Friday to discuss the summit and German
unification, said Detlef Peters, press attache at the West German
consulate in New York. Kohl is to deliver the commencement address
at Harvard University on Thursday.
   Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev failed to resolve
their differences over German unification at a weekend summit in
Washington, but said they discussed new ways of approaching the
question.
   West Germany spearheads NATO and East Germany is part of the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact. Bush and West German leaders want a united
Germany to be in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Gorbachev
strongly opposes this.
   However, Gorbachev said he and Bush agreed that Germans had the
right to decide whether a united Germany should be in NATO, an
apparent softening of Gorbachev's stand, a U.S. official said in
Washington.
   De Maiziere has generally sided with the West and said a united
Germany could be a NATO member. But he says the military alliance
must be altered to reflect the political changes in the East bloc
and wants an eventual new European security system.

   They were based on setting countries against each other. They
divided countries and peoples much more than they united them. This
system that was perfected during the years of the Cold War ... of

<TEXT>
   The U.S. military has offered to
evacuate soldiers' families at government expense following the
recent slayings of Americans and rebel threats of more attacks, a
military spokesman said Tuesday.
   Adm. Huntington Hardisty, commander of U.S. forces in the
Pacific, has approved the voluntary return of military dependents
from the Philippines, said Lt. Col. Ron Rand, spokesman for Clark
Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila. There are more than 20,000 U.S.
dependents in the Philippines.
   Rand said servicemen at any of the six U.S. bases in the
Philippines may request their families be sent home at government
expense before the tour of duty ends.
   Communist rebels killed two American airmen near Clark Air Base
last month and vowed more attacks until all U.S. troops leave the
country. Rebels also were suspected in the shooting death of a
Marine sergeant near Subic Bay naval base on May 4.
   The Philippine government has responded to the recent killings by
increasing police protection around Clark Air Base.
   Since Friday, U.S. Defense Department civilians and military
dependents who live at the air base have been barred from leaving
because of threats from Communist guerrillas. Those living off-base
have been ordered to limit travel to essential business.
   The restrictions affect about 20,300 Americans at Clark but do
not apply to the other five bases.
   About 40,000 Americans _ servicemen, civilian workers and
dependents _ are stationed at Clark, Subic and four other American
bases in the Philippines.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez named a South Florida
lawman as his running mate Monday even though J. Allison DeFoor II
was reprimanded by the state Supreme Court in 1986 while sitting as
a county judge.
   DeFoor, now the Monroe County sheriff, was charged with
improperly taking part in other political races, using his office
for private and financial gain and establishing a policy allowing
speeders to pay double the fine to keep traffic offenses off their
driving records.
   Martinez's press secretary, Jon Peck, said the Republican
governor was aware of DeFoor's ethical run-in.
   ``The governor knew about it and didn't believe it would be a
problem for the campaign,'' said Peck.
   Martinez, who hoped a fresh face in the lieutenant governor slot
would help jump-start the first week of full-time campaigning,
described DeFoor, 36, as a ``proven performer ... uniquely qualified
to represent the Florida of tomorrow.''
   The governor's campaign manager, J.M. ``Mac'' Stipanovich, said
of the reprimand: ``We deemed it inconsequential. We don't think any
defense is required.''
   The Judicial Qualifications Commission, in 1986, charged that
DeFoor:
   _Improperly aided the candidacies of two friends, Richard J.
Fowler, who was running for circuit judge, and Randall Winter, who
was running for public defender.
   _Improperly used his office to promote an ``electronic leash,''
monitoring device in which he held a financial interest. The device
was used to keep track of probationers under house arrest.
   _Violated Florida rules by allowing speeders under 70 mph to
avoid judgment by signing a waiver and paying the clerk of court
twice the statutory fine.
   The court agreed with the commission's finding that DeFoor's
public reprimand was sufficient punishment because of his contrition
and acknowledgement of wrongdoing.
   DeFoor left the Monroe County bench and returned to private law
practice in 1987 and was elected sheriff in 1989.
   Key campaign issues, he said, include crime and the environment.

   A dead gray whale was found to have plastic bags,
rubber gloves and other manmade refuse in its stomach, but that
probably didn't kill it, an expert said Monday.
   Months of lab tests may be needed to determine what killed the
whale dubbed spot by animal lovers who tracked its movements through
Puget Sound for about 10 weeks. The 39-foot whale was found dead
Wednesday near Hartstene Island, in the sound about 35 miles
southwest of Seattle.
   Meanwhile Monday, the Coast Guard warned vessels to avoid two
other dead whales spotted in the Strait of Juan de Fuca.
   Pieces of wood, bark, plastic bags, cloth rags and two rubber
gloves were found in Spot's stomach during a necropsy Sunday, said
John Calambokidis of the Cascadia Research Collective in Olympia.
   ``Certainly nothing that we could see in that odd series of items
would account for a death threat,'' Calambokidis said.
   Analysis of tissue samples taken from Spot's carcass over the
weekend could take weeks to several months to complete, according to
a statement issued by Cascadia and the Marine Animal Resource Center
of Seattle.
   Gretchen Steiger, a Cascadia research biologist, said Spot seemed
to be behaving normally and showed no sign of distress or injury
before dying.

<HEAD>Newspapers Would Have To Use Recycled Paper Under New Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERHEAD, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's toughest newspaper recycling
law has been approved in Suffolk County on Long Island, where all
major papers will be required to use 40 percent recycled newsprint
in their editions by the end of 1996.
   The measure was approved May 29 by a 12-6 vote in the county
Legislature.
   A group representing 64 daily papers in the state criticized the
law.
   ``Any use of recycled paper should be market driven,'' said John
Kutzer, executive director of the New York Newspaper Publishers
Association. ``We feel local government is perhaps going overboard
with these requirements.''
   The law would apply to all daily and weekly newspapers printed,
sold, or distributed in Suffolk County, provided their Suffolk
circulation is 20,000 or more a week. Advertising circulars are
included if they meet the circulation requirement.
   The bill requires that newspapers be printed on stock containing
at least 40 percent recycled paper by Dec. 31, 1996. Papers that do
not comply would face a $500 fine each day.
   The publisher of Newsday, the largest circulation daily on Long
Island, plans to challenge the law in court, said spokesman Sam
Ruinsky. Newsday says it uses 17 percent recycled paper for printing.
   William K. Adler, manager of corporate relations for The New York
Times, cited a voluntary agreement approved by the publishers'
association in which they agreed to gradually increase the use of
recycled paper. That plan set a goal of 40 percent by the year 2000.
   ``Since the state has initiated a coordinated program, attempts
by individual counties to legislate their own timetables for
recycled newsprint are counterproductive,'' said Adler.
   The Times is using 8 percent recycled fiber, he said.

<HEAD>Florida Supreme Court Removes Newspaper Sales Tax Exemption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Florida Supreme Court ruled May 31
that the sales tax paid on the purchase of magazines should also be
applied to newspapers.
   The court, in a 6-0 opinion, rejected an effort by magazine
publishers to get the protection enjoyed by newspapers, and went
further, deleting the newspaper exemption.
   ``Florida's statutory differentiation between ... magazines and
newspapers for purposes of sales taxation burdens rights protected
by the First Amendment,'' wrote Chief Justice Raymond Ehrlich.
   William Hyde, an attorney who represented the Florida Press
Association, said an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is likely.
``It's making the acquisition of knowledge more difficult,'' he said.
   Laura Besvinick, an attorney representing The Miami Herald, said
Florida's largest newspaper was considering an appeal to the
nation's high court.
   ``We think that a tax on the press impermissibly burdens the
First Amendment,'' she said.
   Only magazines sold over the counter were taxed before 1987, when
the state extended the sales tax to a variety of services and to the
sale of newspapers.
   The services tax was repealed in a political firestorm a few
months later, but the status quo was not re-established. Newspapers
regained their exemption while the tax was extended to the sale of
all magazines.
   The Magazine Publishers of America, Inc., The Hearst Corp., Time,
Inc., Golf Digest-Tennis, Inc. and others went to court to challenge
the distinction.

<HEAD>Daily News Lays Off Machinists</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Daily News blamed reduced advertising revenue
May 29 in announcing the layoff of 17 machinists as it continued
bargaining over expired contracts at the tabloid.
   ``This is the beginning of the planned strategy of provoking the
unions into strike action,'' said Theodore Kheel, adviser of the
Allied Printing Trades Councils, the 10 unions negotiating with the
News.
   ``No doubt there will be more of the same sort to come.''
   The News said laid-off workers would get between two and six
weeks pay, and three months medical coverage.
   This was to be coupled with a group outplacement seminar, for a
total cost of $80,000, the News said.
   ``By terms of the existing agreements, management is permitted to
determine the manning level in this department,'' said John T.
Sloan, the News vice president of human resources.
   ``Our decision couldn't be further delayed in light of slowing
economic conditions in the New York advertising marketplace.''

<HEAD>Proposed Techs' Contract Goes to Union Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communications workers at The Associated Press
will vote on a tentative contract agreement that management called
fair but union leaders said was inadequate.
   The AP announced June 2 that it and Local 1314 of the
Communication Workers of America had reached a tentative agreement
on a contract calling for a ``managed care'' approach to control the
cost of the medical plan.
   The agreement also calls for a $23.50 weekly increase in
top-scale technician salaries in the first year and a $24 weekly
boost in the second, raising the top-scale technician salary to $612
in 1991. Similar percentage increases were proposed for all other
job classifications.
   D. Byron Yake, AP's director of human resources, called the
package fair and predicted it would be approved.
   Leaders of the CWA local agreed to submit the proposed contract
to their 300 members for a vote but said they would recommend it be
rejected.
   Jim Peecook, president of the union local, said the health plan
proposals represented ``a severe loss to those employees and their
families.'' He also said the proposed increase in pension benefits
was inadequate.
   Terms of the present contract were extended until July 2 pending
the vote, the AP said.

<HEAD>Feds Probe Florida Newspapers' Advertising Network</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Justice Department is investigating
the pricing practices at a network of 19 Florida newspapers that
have grouped together to sell space to large advertisers.
   Florida Newspaper Advertising Network Inc., with offices in
Orlando, learned of the investigation May 29 when demands for
records were sent to member newspapers.
   Alfred E. Corey Jr., president of the network, said he is puzzled
by the request because the group is just now being organized.
   ``We have never sold an ad,'' said Corey, who is advertising
director of The St. Petersburg Times.
   The Justice Department declined to discuss the case.
   The network was formed to make it more convenient for big
advertisers to reach several markets in the state.
   The newspapers, which pay membership dues based on their
circulation, have hired New York-based Sawyer, Ferguson, Walker Co.
as a third party to organize the network.
   Corey said the Florida group has planned to offer the same prices
as on the newspapers' standard rate cards.
   The Justice Department's ``civil investigative demand'' seeks to
receive by June 25 documents and information related to ``possible
price-fixing and market allocation in the sale of print advertising
in Florida.''
   The demand seeks all documents related to production,
advertising, rates, sales, discounts, distribution, pricing,
promotion or marketing of advertising inserts.
   The demand also seeks all documents related to any proposed or
actual agreement among Florida newspapers related to advertising
inserts.

<HEAD>Attorney Wins Damages From Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney was awarded $75,000 in
damages by a jury who found he had been defamed when his photograph
was published as part of a report in the Springfield Union-News on
the sentencing of reputed organized crime figures.
   A jury in Hampden County Superior Court on May 29 found that
Anthony J. Scibelli had been defamed by The Republican Co.,
publisher of the newspaper.
   Scibelli had claimed that his presence at the federal courthouse
was not properly explained in the photograph, which pictured him
with one of the defendants, or in the accompanying story, published
Dec. 11, 1987.
   Scibelli claimed mental anxiety and emotional distress in his
defamation action.
   The jury determined the newspaper was negligent and also found
for Scibelli in his claim that he had been discredited and suffered
mental anguish as a result.
   Newspaper attorney Joseph P. Pessolano said it is likely motions
will be filed asking the judge to set aside the jury's findings,
reduce the damage award or grant a new trial.
   Scibelli did not claim that he had been improperly identified or
that he had suffered any loss of income as a result of the
publication. He also did not claim that publication of the
photograph was malicious.
   Scibelli told the jury that he went to the proceedings to provide
``aid and comfort'' to his father, Anthony C. Scibelli, 75, who was
among the defendants in the racketeering and gambling cases.
   He testified he believed the publication of his photograph
without explanation ``leaves me there as a defendant.''

<HEAD>DA's Office Drops Charges Against Gonzo Journalist</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ASPEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors asked for dismissal of drug
possession, explosives and sexual assault charges against Hunter
Thompson, saying their case against the ``gonzo'' journalist was not
strong enough.
   The dismissal motions May 31 said potential witnesses had not
cooperated with investigators from the district attorney's office.
   A statement from the prosecutor's office also said a preliminary
hearing May 22 resulted in discrepancies between sworn testimony and
previous statements to investigators.
   Thompson said the decision was ``a huge victory for all of us''
and called for a ``celebratory orgy'' at his favorite hangout, the
Woody Creek Tavern in Aspen.
   Thompson, 53, earlier was ordered to stand trial June 25 on four
felony and three misdemeanor charges.
   The charges stemmed from a visit to his home in Woody Creek last
February by Gale Palmer-Slater of Port Huron, Mich., an entrepreneur
and ex-pornographic film actress and producer. She claimed that
Thompson grabbed her breast and threw a drink at her and that she
saw him sniff cocaine during her hours-long visit to his home.
   Authorities subsequently searched Thompson's home and said they
found LSD, cocaine, tranquilizers, marijuana and explosives.
Thompson claimed the drugs had been left by guests over the years
and were only turned up because his home was searched with a
thoroughness inappropriate for a misdemeanor assault charge.
   Thompson is an author and journalist known for his accounts of
political campaigns, shark hunts in Hawaii and the Hell's Angels. He
often has laced his exaggerated first-person reports with accounts
of his own drug and alcohol abuse.

   Two Saguaro High School science teachers
threatened legal action to pressure the school newspaper to withhold
an editorial exposing science department turmoil, editors said May
29.
   Editors of the Saguaro Sabercat said they decided not to publish
an editorial because of the threats.
   Principal Herman Serignese acknowledged the existence of an power
struggle in the department but would not commment on the cause.
   The paper's May 25 edition carried a headline, ``Department
Suffers from Internal Conflicts,'' above a small box reading,
``Editor's Note: Due to the controversial nature of the staff
editorial which was to appear in this space, we opted to remove it
from this issue.''
   The editorial says that younger science teachers, who instituted
creative teaching methods and organized state science tournaments,
excluded most veteran teachers from their activities.

<HEAD>Soviet Business Weekly Begins U.S. Publication</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. edition of a private Soviet business
weekly made its debut to coincide with the Bush-Gorbachev summit.
   ``The idea is to give practical information and objective
information, which is more or less unusual for the Soviet press,''
said Vladimir Yakovlev, editor-in-chief of Commersant.
   The paper, aimed at the Soviet and foreign businesses in the
Soviet Union, started publishing in Russian and English in January.
It has a domestic circulation of 350,000 and the new Soviet-American
edition is expected to attract up to 60,000 subscribers at an
introductory rate of $165 a year.
   Commersant covers topics such as the launch and failure of joint
ventures, the accurate but unofficial dollar exchange rate and
Soviet government decisions affecting business.
   One piece in the summit issue compares the Soviet economy to a
cramped leg _ ``you can move it neither forward nor backward nor can
you remain still because of the pain.''

<HEAD>Professor Tries To Take Mystery Out of Economics Through Column</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLESTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economics professor Allen Smith, worried
that people know too little about the policies that affect their
financial lives, has started a new class _ with 825,000 potential
students.
   Smith writes a common-sense economics column carried by 13
newspapers from Alabama to Oregon.
   ``People see (economics) as a very complex, mystical thing,''
said Smith, a professor of economics at Eastern Illinois Univesity.
``But, it's not that complex. Much of economics is just basic common
sense.''
   For Smith, it is a crusade. Most Americans do not understand the
fundamental rules of economics, and their ignorance is bad for the
nation, he said.
   Smith wants to affect national economic debate by teaching the
public, and he's fascinated by the potential.
   ``I think more people are interested in economics and how it
affects their future than some give them credit for,'' said Smith.
``I'm amazed at how many people you can have access to through
newspapers.''
   Smith said presidents and Congress have ignored the fundamental
rules of economics at the nation's expense.
   He blames elected officials _ Republicans and Democrats, liberals
and conservatives _ for passing faulty economic programs for
political gain and failing to tell the public the hard truth about
taxes and spending.

<HEAD>Judge Formalizes Dallas Jury Verdict; Denies Mistrial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state district judge has denied a request for a
mistrial in the Dallas Times Herald's antitrust suit against The
Dallas Morning News.
   State District Judge David West in Houston denied the request May
30 and entered a judgment against the Times Herald formalizing the
May 8 verdict of Houston jurors against the newspaper.
   During jury deliberations, and in the motion for mistrial,
attorneys for the Times Herald argued that West incorrectly defined
antitrust law in a manner that was ``tantamount to an instructed
verdict'' against the Times Herald.
   Layne Kruse, one of the Times Herald's trial attorneys, said the
formal judgment was a necessary step for any appeal.
   The Times Herald had accused The Morning News and its parent
company, Belo Corp., of violating state antitrust laws through a
transaction with Universal Press Syndicate to acquire publication
rights to 26 features and comics that were appearing in the Times
Herald.
   The Times Herald alleged that the contract was an attempt by Belo
Corp. to acquire a monopoly in the Dallas market.
   A Houston jury voted 10-2 against the Times Herald's claim.

   State Rep. Carl Pursell will propose legislation
to alter or repeal the law that allowed the joint operating
agreement between The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press, an

   Pursell plans to outline the bill at a news conference June 6,
aide Gary Cates said.
   Pursell at first supported the Detroit JOA, but later opposed
what he said could be ``a sweetheart relationship between the

   Under the Newspaper Preservation Act, JOAs let competing
newspapers merge circulation, advertising, production and other
business operations while maintaining separate news and editorial
operations. Under the act, one of the newspapers must be defined as
failing.
   Cates wouldn't discuss details of Pursell's proposed legislation,

   ``Kingsley wrote about Elvis frequently and broke many news

<HEAD>CNN Book Tells All on Turner and Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new book on the birth of Ted Turner's Cable
News Network recalls some of the most famous stories about early
days at the all-news channel.
   Author Hank Whittemore's ``CNN: The Inside Story'' was released
June 1 by Little, Brown and Company to coincide with the network's
10th birthday.
   Among the stories it tells is the time a light bulb exploded in
the CNN Washington bureau and ignited the clothing of on-camera
reporter Dan Schorr. And the time weatherman Stu Siroka was
victimized by the Chromakey process, which allows one picture to be
placed behind another. All viewers saw was Siroka's bald head,
suspended above the CNN weather map.
   Whittemore spent six months interviewing present and former CNN
producers, reporters, anchors and administrators. It's a spirited
and sometimes bizarre tale of how Turner, equipped with $100 million
and even more chutzpah, screamed, bullied, sued, cajoled and
bankrolled his way into television history by launching the first
24-hour all-news network.
   Whittemore, the author of a best seller called ``The Super
Cops,'' magazine articles and television documentaries, is on a tour
to promote the book.
   He still finds it difficult to explain Turner's complex
personality, though an encounter at an awards dinner in Kansas City
may provide some insight: ``He comes up to me and says `What are you
going to write about me? Just don't make me out to be an ass,'''
Whittemore said.
   ``Then he looks around and kind of beams, and says `Well, maybe I
was.'
   ``I felt like I was in a Harold Robbins novel,'' Whittemore said.
``The man will say the most outrageous things and you wonder `Is the
man just not thinking or is he being very calculating?'''

prosecuted for an alleged corruption scandal, filed a $20 million
libel lawsuit May 31 against WLOX-TV and its network, American
Broadcasting Companies Inc.
   The lawsuit claims Blessey was maliciously defamed in two
broadcasts: one on a national TV special titled ``Lying, Cheating
and Stealing in America'' in June 1989, and a report on the WLOX
evening news in February that said government investigators had
implicated the former mayor in a kickback scheme.
   Blessey has twice gone on trial on charges that he abused public
office as mayor. In March, he was acquitted on federal extortion and
conspiracy charges. In August a jury failed to reach a verdict in
his trial on mail fraud and conspiracy charges.
   WLOX President John Hash declined to comment on specifics of the
lawsuit, but said: ``Gerald Blessey is entitled to his belief that
he's been wronged. And we are entitled to our belief that we have
not wronged Gerald Blessey. We're sure that all the facts will come

   ABC lawyers were not immediately available for comment.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev emerged from the summit

won't do him any good until he relaxes his pressure on breakaway
Lithuania.
   In fact, a leading House Democrat said Sunday that President Bush
can expect challenges from Congress on how he handled the
U.S.-Soviet summit in general.
   ``In other words, is the Congress of the United States going to

squeeze every drop out of that lemon?'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,

the business of renewing old corporate ties and building new ones to

   Mrs. Gorbachev, meanwhile, took an unexpected shopping trip,
stopping at a Mexican deli and a drugstore, where she bought bubble
gum and macadamia nuts, but turned away a Snickers bar, saying,
``Nyet, Nyet, I'm on a diet.'' She also got some insight into the
mechanics of capitalism, questioning workers about salaries and work
policies.

   Outside China, people from Mongolia to Paris and Czechoslovakia
remembered the anniversary with hunger strikes, marches and
candlelight vigils. The largest commemmoration was in Hong Kong,
where tens of thousands of people jammed Victoria Park and watched
videotapes of Chinese dissidents in exile urging people not to
forget the Beijing killings.

   Help Wanted. Baylor College of
Medicine seeks 16 good sleepers to spend a month lying down. Salary
uncertain, but benefits include breakfast in bed _ lunch and dinner,
too.
   It sounds like a couch potato's dream, but there's a catch to the
deal being offered by researchers David Cardus and Wesley McTaggart.
   When they say the sleepers will be confined to bed, they're not
kidding. The people they select won't be allowed to get up for the
the entire month, and they'll spend part of their time spinning
around in a space-age sleep chamber that looks like something
straight out of the movie ``Aliens.''
   The experiments also will require the research subjects to be
hooked up to sensors that monitor a dozen bodily functions.

   It's raz, dva, tri strikes, ``You're out!'' at
Moscow State University, where Soviets were learning the American
national pastime while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev toured the
American heartland.
   The Soviets started playing baseball four years ago, hoping to
field a team at the Summer Games in 1992 when it will be a medal
sport for the first time.
   But hopes are not high on the Astroturf at a 1,000-seat baseball
stadium built on the university grounds last September.
   ``I don't think a Soviet team will make it to the Olympics this
time around,'' said Alexander E. Semyonov.

<HEAD>Denial of Holocaust Raises Free Speech Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK McDOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LYON, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Professor Bernard Notin wrote last year that
the Nazi gas chambers never existed. French Jews who lost relatives
in the Holocaust decided in March to teach him a lesson.
   Minutes after Notin began an evening economics lecture, about 60
Jewish leaders, students and survivors of the death camps walked
into his classroom at Jean Moulin University and took over.
   They sat Notin in the second row and informed him he could not
leave, then told the 20 students their professor had defiled the
memory of 6 million Jews who perished in Hitler's extermination
program.
   ``Look, Mr. Notin,'' an aging woman said, revealing the number
Nazi guards had tattooed on her forearm. ``How do you explain this
tattoo? We are part of the 80,000 French at Auschwitz and only 3
percent came back.''
   Notin, a leading member of Jean-Marie Le Pen's far-right National
Front, looked at his shoes. Some of his students wept, horrified by
the survivors' accounts.
   The confrontation was a high point in the ``Notin affair,'' which
has provoked debate on political interference in schools and whether
laws against bigotry restrict freedom of speech.
   A recent wave of anti-Semitic vandalism contributed an extra
bitterness. It included desecration of graves and mutilation of a
corpse in a Jewish cemetery at Carpentras, southern France.
   ``All this was bound to happen,'' said Jean Levy, a Jewish leader
in Lyon. ``The proposals of Le Pen are so racist ... his language is
the point of no return.''
   After the classroom takeover, Notin was suspended as an associate
law professor at the Lyon university and asked to resign from its
science council.
   He continued to teach economics, however. Michel Noir, mayor of
Lyon, threatened on April 19 to block the university's expansion
into a publicly owned building unless it acted against Notin.
   That prompted one of Notin's few public statements. He insisted
on ``the right of everyone to his liberty of opinion, to defy the
powers that be, to criticize and to doubt.''
   No one accused him of preaching his ideas in class, but
university officials feel he should not have lent the institution's
name to those ideas.
   On May 14, the 48-member Administration Council of Jean Moulin
University voted to begin proceedings to dismiss Notin. It also
suspended granting a doctorate to Georges Pinault, a lecturer in
Celtic languages who once described Adolf Hitler as the ``greatest
man of the 20th century.''
   ``They can't write in the name of history and academic freedom
that the gas chambers didn't exist,'' Noir said in an interview.
``These aren't opinions. They are crimes.''
   Unlike the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees free speech,
France's charter allows the government to curb expression.
   A 1972 law sets fines for racist or anti-Semitic statements. The
National Assembly recently extended it to cover ``revisionism'' _
denying the Holocaust occurred.
   Violators would be barred from public jobs or elected office for
five years. Le Pen, who has called the gas chambers ``a detail'' of
history, considers the law undemocratic.
   ``Who is charged to say what one can and cannot say in a free
country?'' he asked in an interview. As for Jews, he said, ``if they
are French, there's no problem. I'm not anti-Semitic.''
   Le Pen insists his party's main political targets are immigrants.
   Daniel Drai, 25, a soft-spoken medical student who led the
invasion of Notin's classroom, said: ``There's only a small
difference between revisionism and Carpentras. Revisionism erases
the dead. Desecration kills them all over again.''
   For him, Mayor Noir and others, a critique of the media that
appeared under Notin's name in the August 1989 edition of the
academic review Economy and Society fits the description of
revisionism.
   One paragraph says visiting concentration camps is a ``hardly
credible'' way to prove gas chambers existed, and describes accounts
of survivors as ``hearsay.''
   Indignation over the article eventually led to allegations that
many members of Le Pen's National Front were among the 400 faculty
of Jean Moulin University.
   At least 10 known members of the party teach there, including
Notin and Bernard Gollnisch, a member of the European Parliament.
   The university, which overlooks the Rhone River, is named for a
Resistance leader tortured to death in Lyon in 1943 by the Gestapo.
   It was born of tensions at the old University of Lyon II during
the 1968 student upheavals in France.
   Lyon II split in 1973. A new, left-wing school with the original
name offered social sciences, and rightist Jean Moulin took
business, finance and law, plus history, philosophy and languages.
   Critics say the university was a natural choice when the National
Front sought to broaden its intellectual base. Colette Demaiziere,
dean of French, geography, history and letters, said the criticism
was overblown and accused Noir, the mayor, of political opportunism.
   ``How can we reproach someone for belonging to a legal party?''
she asked. ``We've never been able to prove someone here
proselytized for the Front, and if they did, I'm not sure the
students would respond.''
   For students, sipping soft drinks in the university cloister, the
Notin affair took a back seat to impending final exams.
   ``We don't even think about politics,'' said Philippe Cumunel, a
23-year-old finance major. ``They've put burdens on our backs we
don't even care about.''
   Cumunel said he saw nothing wrong with firing Notin and added, to
nods from others: ``They should get the communists out of here too.
These Stalinists who deny the Gulag are no better than the Nazi
regime.''

and journalist (1880-1956).

<HEAD>Gorbachev Confronts a New Era of Soviet Political Power</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like many an embattled politician before him,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev took a crack at Congress, worked his smiling
way through crowds, counter-punched his critics and made the most of
incumbency.
   During his week in the West, the Soviet president rebuked those
who call him weak or consider his nation enfeebled by the throes of
economic change. He scolded the American Congress for double
standards and told its leaders they should not meddle in the affairs
of his legislature.
   It was a telegenic combination of grand ceremony and feisty
politics, and it would have played well for an American politician
in Moscow. That may not apply in the opposite direction.
   The overwhelming Soviet concerns are domestic and economic. It is
a time of wrenching change from communism to a market system
Gorbachev said his government is trying to build from the ground up.
It is no easy matter.
   ``It is difficult to be a politician nowadays, because a
politician used to be a guy who sat in his study and was an
analyst,'' Gorbachev told congressional leaders, ``but now one
cannot divorce himself from the populist sentiments, from the
sentiments of those who do not want to be simple bystanders.''
   Senate and House leaders can understand that. They have their
political problems, too. But for them, it is traveled territory and
they know the rules. In the changing Soviet system, it is new
terrain.
   Gorbachev talked with remarkable candor about his problems in
what he called a genuine revolution. He also warned the West against
seeking to take advantage of it, saying that turmoil in either
system will mean trouble for the other.
   When congressional leaders complained about his clampdown against
independence in Lithuania, Gorbachev countered with Panama.
   ``Why do you allow, for example, your own government, your own
administration, to invade Panama, which is a sovereign country, if
you love freedom so much?'' he demanded.
   ``Where were you when Panama was invaded, and why that double
standard?''
   It didn't match the 1959 kitchen debate with which Richard M.
Nixon, as vice president, gained political capital in a Moscow
argument with Nikita S. Khrushchev. But it had the flavor.
   More substantively, Gorbachev went home from his summit journey
Monday night with a preliminary trade agreement, a pact he sought in
his effort to ease Soviet economic problems. It is conditional and
will not take effect before the Soviet parliament passes a law
guaranteeing the right of Jewish emigration. But he got a deal,
unexpectedly.
   In the scoring system of American politics, all that should serve
to strengthen his hand at home, at least for a while. But those
rules don't necessarily apply.
   Nor can the Soviet system be measured the old way. Gorbachev and
his allies have changed it too drastically. That is both their
achievement and their problem. One product of the reformed system is
the rise of Boris N. Yeltsin, Gorbachev's leading rival, newly _ but
narrowly _ elected president of Russia, the biggest of the 15 Soviet
republics.
   Putting a Gorbachev spin on that situation, Vitaly Churkin of the
foreign ministry said in Washington that Yeltsin might actually turn
out to be an asset to the central government, helping to mobilize
popular support for radical economic reform.
   The administration position is that the United States wants
perestroika to succeed, but that American policy is not tied to
Gorbachev or any other single leader. Bush advisers keep close watch
on ups and downs in Soviet politics; trying to assess what one
called the blips and instabilities of the situation.
   While Bush has said that it is not his role to try to sort out
who should lead the Soviet Union, there is an administration stake
in Gorbachev's survival as leader of the other superpower.
   At and after the summit, Bush emphasized his personal
relationship with Gorbachev. He said Sunday they have agreed to meet
on a regular basis, perhaps annually. The Soviet reform policies the
administration supports are Gorbachev policies.
   One of Bush's top advisors said Gorbachev may be as strong as any
recent leader in terms of Kremlin politics.
   But administration analysts admit they do not have a good handle
on the relationship between the old fashioned system of Kremlin
leadership and the new era of political power in the country.
   They doubt their Soviet counterparts understand it very well,
either.

<TEXT>
   It's a tough time of year for television
executives. First, there was the May sweeps period. Now, it's time
for the network affiliates' annual conventions, where the questions
often come loaded.
   Sandwiched between were the all-important fall schedule
announcements, an event tantamount to a presidential candidate
picking a running mate _ and not one of the Big Three wants anything
in the fall lineup that gets the reception Dan Quayle got.
   So here is Robert Iger, entertainment president of No. 2-ranked
ABC, coming off his first year in his big new job. He likes it,
thank you very much, even if things are a bit hectic of late.
   And almost as much as he likes the job, it appears, Iger likes to
take chances. He calls them gambles ``where we have nothing to
lose.''
   But in the high-stakes, out-of-kilter television world, there
always is something to lose. Most of the time, it's your job.
   The 39-year-old former weatherman who now runs programming at ABC
has an affinity for the weird. This is the man who brought you
``Twin Peaks'' and is about to bring you singing police officers in
``CopRock.''
   This is the man who says, ``I don't believe in being No. 1 at all
costs.''
   Do the guys over at parent company Capital Cities know this? They
must. They put him in this position last March.
   Iger's predecessors include Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael
Eisner, producer Fred Silverman, Fox Inc. Chairman Barry Diller,
and, most recently, Brandon Stoddard.
   No, Iger says, he doesn't have a quick plan to bump off NBC as
the top-rated network. ``You don't walk in and say we're going to be
No. 1 this year.''
   Rather, Iger says, you shoot for innovative programming, for
winning certain time periods, for incremental battles that
eventually add up to winning the war.
   So how did Iger, a 15-year ABC veteran who came up through its
sports division, devise the upcoming season?
   ``There were time periods we weren't going to worry about,'' he
says.
   Such as? ``Thursdays at 8'' (when ``The Cosby Show'' is on NBC),
and ``Sundays at 7'' (when ``60 Minutes'' is on CBS).
   The time periods ABC targeted, Iger says, were Saturday and
Wednesday nights. To the former, it moved ``China Beach'' and ``Twin
Peaks.'' On the latter night will be ``The Wonder Years'' and
``Growing Pains.''
   Conversations with Iger these days tend to center on ``Twin
Peaks,'' the much-hyped nighttime soap opera created by film
director David Lynch and former ``Hill Street Blues'' writer Mark
Frost.
   Most questions about the series that gives new meaning to the
adjective ``surreal'' pertain to why it closed this season without
solving the murder of homecoming queen Laura Palmer.
   Obviously that caused some concern, Iger says in his Century City
office.
   ``I called Mark up _ that was before we had ever aired the pilot.
I wanted to maximize the show's potential. And to do that, I thought
there should be more viewer satisfaction. I was pretty forceful
about it in terms of expressing my thoughts. ... But I never told
them what to do,'' he says.
   Iger calls himself a ``Peaks freak.'' And he was the driving
force in getting the show on the network, even when some bigwigs at
Cap Cities thought it sounded crazy.
   ``Peaks'' has been picked up for fall, despite recent lackluster
ratings. Will it do better?
   ``I hope so,'' Iger says.
   The upcoming season presented a number of problems for ABC.
Namely, what do you put on after ``America's Funniest Home Videos,''
the hottest show on television? ``Elvis'' died there, as did other
programming tries.
   Iger's solution? He cloned it. In the fall, ``America's Funniest
... Part II'' will be broadcast at 8:30 p.m. EDT Sundays. And
despite a glut of home video hybrids on other networks and local
affiliates, Iger said he's not worried about his own show.
   ``I think `Home Videos' has proven to be an extremely durable
product,'' he says.
   Asked to explain how he decides when to cancel a show that is a
critical success but a ratings loser, Iger replies:
   ``It's very difficult. That's probably one of the most difficult
things we have to do. Yes, we're in this business to be No. 1 and
yes, we're in this to make money, but if a show is still successful
demographically (i.e. in certain age-group audiences), that can't be
ignored.''

<HEAD>Justin Wilson, A Man for All Seasonings, Opens New Cajun Cooking
Show</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justin Wilson, the celebrated Cajun raconteur and
cook, had just spent the day moving into his new house north of New
Orleans, across Lake Pontchartrain.
   The man for all seasonings had poured himself a dollop of merlot,
a wine he favors, to talk to a telephone caller. ``How'm I doin'?
I'm feelin' so good it mus' be illegal,'' he said, lapsing into the
famed Cajun accent thicker than file gumbo.
   Wilson has been helping make an obscure regional cuisine a
fundamental part of American cooking since his first cookbook in
1964.
   His first PBS series, ``Cookin' Cajun,'' aired nationwide on PBS
and cable for more than 10 years.
   At 76, Wilson is launching his fourth TV cooking show,
``Louisiana Cookin': Home Grown,'' showcasing the fish, game,
vegetables, spicy culinary style and anecdotes of Acadiana, his
beloved south Louisiana homeland.
   Wilson, who's appeared on commercial TV for ``Cajun flavor''
potato chips, is proud of the new show, his first in five years. It
is running or will run on more than 200 public television stations
across the country.
   ``Cajun cooking is the ability to take what you have and create a
good dish and season it right, with salt, pepper and a few good
things like mint or garlic, bay leaf, cayenne pepper, bell pepper,
onion, celery,'' Wilson said.
   ``It isn't all that hard, but so few people know how to take what
they have and put it together and season it properly,'' he said.
``It's creative cooking _ that's all it is.''
   ``Home Grown'' is not a show to watch hungry.
   The opener features brown rice pudding with meringue; other
``guest stars'' are shrimp, oysters, catfish, crawfish, rabbit,
venison, mirliton, andouille and boudin sausage, crab, okra, pecans,
'gator, greens, sweet potato and duck.
   ``I am a gourmet, but I am more of a gourmand,'' he explained.
``A gourmet is somebody that's an epicurean. But a gourmand is
somebody that's a P-I-G hog and that's what I am.''
   ``JOOS-tahn'' is more than that.
   Wilson, who has recorded 27 albums of Cajun humor, also is the
author of five cookbooks (the latest due out this month) and
co-author of two Cajun humor books and a children's book, ``Cajun
Fables.''
   At an age when many people have been retired for a decade, Wilson
makes about 200 personal appearances a year. ``I'm not slowing
down,'' he said. ``They might catch up with me.''
   A celebrated after-dinner speaker, Wilson began his career in
public speaking in 1935. A safety engineer, consultant and lecturer,
he's also taught ``human relations'' to police in six states,
including Louisiana.
   ``I met Will Rogers in 1935,'' Wilson said. ``I guess he had more
influence on me than anybody to keep telling Cajun stories. He told
me always to tell 'em clean, and always tell your audience something
serious _ or they'll think you're a complete fool.''
   Wilson calls himself a ``half-bleed'' Cajun. His father was
Louisiana's commissioner of agriculture for 32 years, and his
mother, Olivet, was Louisiana French who taught him how to cook.
   ``She was a great improviser,'' Wilson said. ``She'd cook a dish
and we'd go `Mama, w'at's this here, hanh?' And she'd say,
`Children, that's a mus-go. It mus' go down yo' t'roat.'''

   Old zombies never die, they just stagger
back for remakes.
   The flesh-eaters that grossed out movie-goers in 1969's ``Night
of the Living Dead'' and its two sequels are back, as the low-budget
black and white horror classic is remade at an abandoned dairy farm
about 45 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.
   The remake's plot, like the original's, is as simple and
slow-moving as the shuffling dead themselves:
   Boy meets girl in cemetery. Boy and girl meet zombie. Zombie gets
hungry, eats boy. Girl flees. Girl crashes Mercedes, meets other
survivors in desolate farmhouse. Many more zombies get hungry.
People in farmhouse nail boards over doors and windows. People
bicker over escape plans. Zombies descend on farmhouse and break
through boarded-up doors and windows.
   ``This is not a splatter movie. It's like film noir _ but it's in
color,'' says rookie director Tom Savini, formerly a special effects
whiz.
   The hue of choice, it seems, is blood red, according to stills
viewed at the Washington County set. One of the farmhouse-bound
survivors can't cope and eats a shotgun blast. A creature deemed
``the autopsy zombie'' wears a coroner's handiwork on his chest, and
another wanders around with a crowbar impaled in his forehead.
   Even so, special effects supervisor John Vulich says Savini is
trying to keep the gore to a minimum.
   ``We're using the idea that less blood is worth more. I think a
film's more scary if it's realistic _ like the girl next door coming
after you,'' he said.
   Vulich delights in unsettling visitors with textbook photographs
of actual gaping wounds, his best source material. He based the
makeup of one zombie on a photo of a 14-year-old who died when her
face was caught in an escalator, while another was modeled after an
emaciated survivor at a Nazi death camp.
   The original ``Night of the Living Dead'' cost $130,000 and was
shot using a crew of eight people in Evans City, another western
Pennsylvania city.
   ``We spend that much in one day now,'' producer Russ Streiner
says of the remake's $4.2 million budget and crew of 100. Filming is
scheduled for completion early this month, and a Halloween release
is anticipated for the new ``Night of the Living Dead.''
   George Romero, director of the first ``Dead,'' is keeping a low
profile as executive producer. Back to produce are John Russo, who
wrote the script, and Streiner.
   Director Savini says he's concerned the undead seen lurking on
movie and TV screens these days just don't inspire terror anymore.
   ``The living dead have become comic. Look at Michael Jackson's
`Thriller' or Joe Piscopo in the beer commercial. People laugh at
that. That's not what we want,'' he says.
   ``I don't even like the word `zombie.' It conjures up images of
voodoo and all that _ mystical stuff. If you look at our script, we
only use the word `zombie' once. We call them `the dead people' or
`the dead things.'''
   But this remake isn't without touches of comic relief. A roving
band of rednecks revels in taking potshots at the undead, blasting
off their heads.
   ``That's the only way to kill them,'' Streiner says.
   Humor pervades behind the camera, as well. Zombie extras
staggering across a cow pasture in the film's climactic scene
marched on for coffee, but quickly were rounded up for another take
during late-night shooting.
   Others plowed into a barbed-wire fence before an assistant
director could yell, ``Cut!'' Graffiti near a telephone spoofed a
recent film comedy: ``Honey, I Ate the Kids.''
   Locals and traveling horror groupies perched on car and truck
hoods, watching the filming from a nearby ridge. The crew says more
gawkers appear on Friday and Saturday nights.
   ``I've become jaded as an actor, but being out here really
rejuvenates me,'' says Tony Todd, who plays Ben, an insurance
salesman-turned-zombie killer. ``I watch these extras, and it's so
important to them. It's the most major thing they've done in their
lives, and they're putting a lot into it.''
   Enthusiasm isn't the only good quality in a ``dead thing.'' Penny
Venners, an assistant casting director who narrowed hordes of
hopefuls from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia down to 150
extras, says it helps to have hollowed-out eyes, a pale complexion
and a vacant stare.
   The ideal turned up in Charles Berry, 77, a retired paper mill
worker discovered by Savini in a Washington diner. ``He didn't even
need makeup,'' Venners says.
   Clad in a flannel shirt and overalls, his white tufts of hair
streaked back, Berry showed visitors his zombie walk, a slow-motion
version of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.
   ``My rubber legs help me,'' he says. ``I got them from dancing. I
love to dance.''
   What started as Berry's big break soon became a family plot to
get all the Berrys in the flick, including Charles' sons, Walter and
Phillip, his daughter, Ludwina, and grandson, Shawn.
   ``I've never seen a zombie movie in my young life,'' Charles
Berry says, ``but Walter told me to just go ahead and do it.''
   Tim Carryer and his wife, Babs Bailey, professors of dramatic
movement at Pittsburgh's Carnegie Mellon University, were hired to
teach the zombie shuffle to the Berrys and other extras.
   ``If you died and came back to life, you would move in a shadow
of how you once moved,'' Carryer says. ``But you're learning to work
with a brand new body, and you don't know how it operates, and
that's difficult.''
   He encouraged extras to be creative and avoid the zombie cliche
of walking with stiff legs and extended arms. Human nature made the
teaching task easy, he says.
   ``I find,'' says Carryer, ``there's a little zombie lurking
inside all of us.''

   OGALLALA, Neb. _ A sign of terrible times on an abandoned sod hut
in the 1800s on the treeless, dry, heartless heart of America:
   ``90 miles to wood, 20 miles to water. Gone back East to wife's
family.''
   A westbound migrant, aglow with his future on the High Plains:
``This would be fine country if it just had water.''
   A bitter sodbuster in reply: ``So would hell.''
   Little did they know that only feet below their dusty wagon ruts
lay an underground ocean, one of Earth's miracles. It is called the
Ogallala Aquifer.
   In its sands and gravel and strata is buried enough fresh water
to inundate all 50 states beneath almost 1{ feet. It holds as much
water as Lake Huron plus one-fifth of Lake Ontario.
   The Ogallala stretches from South Dakota and Wyoming south
through Nebraska (which overlies two-thirds of its volume),
Colorado, Kansas and Oklahoma to Texas and New Mexico.
   Once this was all dismissed as The Great American Desert. Modern
irrigation has transformed it into an 800-mile green belt made
possible by, in effect, upside-down rain.
   The Ogallala region today produces up to 40 percent of America's
beef, from 20 percent to 25 percent of its food and fiber, notably
feed grains and cotton. This output that helps feed and clothe a
nation was worth upward of $20 billion in 1989 and fuels an
ancillary economy that may reach $50 billion.
   Without irrigation, says Nebraska Sen. Loran Schmit, the state's
gross product would drop 70 percent.
   During the Dust Bowl's historic drought, haggard plainsmen
watched red-eyed as their farms and ranchland blew away in the
sleepless wind. Salvation lay but a pipe's length beneath their very
feet. But they didn't have the tools to reach it. They do now.
   Irrigation can produce as much as three to four times more than
dry-land farming. The Ogallala became found money. Pumping on a
grand scale began in Texas where the High Plains became a mammoth
cotton plantation.
   Envious farmers peered over their fences at what their irrigating
neighbors were doing and the practice moved inexorably northward. In
one region of southwest Nebraska, 111,600 acres were irrigated in
1950. By 1983, 973,000 acres were. In Yuma County in northeast
Colorado it was 11,000 acres in 1959, 446,000 in 1987. The Lubbock,
Texas, area had 3,627 irrigation wells in 1953, 46,906 in 1989.
   Between 1940 and 1980, 400 million acre-feet of the Ogallala's
3.6 billion acre-feet were pumped to the thirsty wells. (An
acre-foot covers an acre with 1 foot of water and equals 325,848
gallons.) The result was predictable.
   Water levels declined up to 200 feet in Texas, with 23 percent of
the water gone as of 1983. Kansas has pumped 38 percent of its water
by one estimate. Its farmers pumped 4.4 million acre-feet in 1985.
About 40 million acre-feet remain underground. In Kit Carson County
in Colorado, water tables have been dropping up to 5 feet annually.
   Good rainfall, dramatically rising costs of pumping fuel, state
regulation, federal farm programs and a greater awareness of
conservation have combined to stem the flood. Ground water use
declined 19 percent from 1980 to 1985.
   Many echo grain farmer Ed Ediger of Hampton, Neb.: ``Let's leave
some for our grandchildren.
   In Scott City, Kan., Keith Lebbin, state water district manager
for west-central Kansas, describes the local situation as ``bleak.''
But even something as ancient as agriculture is feeling the effects
of technology.
   New techniques, new irrigation devices are coming from, of all
places, Texas, where irrigators used to irrigate most Texanly.
Innovations there promise to set a pattern that conceivably will
make the aquifer a self-sustaining resource, or at least prolong its
future unto Ed Ediger's grandchildren's grandchildren.
   ``Today's farmer is much better educated about water,'' says Bill
Kastner, a U.S. Geological Survey hydrologist.
   It took eons for geology and climate to make this national
treasure. In less than a lifetime irrigation has pumped some of it
dry. Since World War II new technology has released a flood far, far
beyond nature's drip-by-drip ability to replace it.
   Water thickness in the Ogallala ranges from a few feet in Kansas
and Colorado to 1,300 feet in the Nebraska Sand Hills. The average
is 200 feet. Perhaps 11 percent of the aquifer has been pumped since
the late 1930s. The maximum decline by 1980 was 200 feet in Floyd
County in the Texas Panhandle. By one estimate a quarter of the
aquifer will be gone by 2020.
   The aquifer has been both mindlessly squandered and utilized with
great intelligence, foresight and self-restraint.
   In places, it is also slowly being contaminated. In 1987,
Nebraska farmers and ranchers put 775,000 tons of fertilizer on the
land. And 16,500 tons of pesticides and uncounted tons of
herbicides. Cows and hogs produced an additional 235,000 tons of
manure. Gradually quantities of this leached downward toward the
water.
   Can the Ogallala survive the onslaught of man's insatiable hand
on the spigot and chemical barrel? To be cautiously Delphic, maybe
yes, maybe no. It depends if what CAN be done WILL be done. It is
past high noon atop the Ogallala. But it is not, in most places, too
late.
   Being underground _ hence invisible _ aquifers are not readily
identified nor easily understood once discovered. A pioneer in
Nebraska Territory could, and did, hit water digging a post hole. He
can be forgiven for crediting good luck, the deity or a forked
dowser's stick. His mind-set was local, hardly geological. Wiser
heads than his had dismissed the region's potential outright.
   Maj. Stephen H. Long explored the High Plains in 1819-20 to utter
an all-time wowser in the annals of soothsaying:
   ``In regard to this extensive section of the country, I do not
hesitate in giving the opinion that it is almost wholly unfit for
cultivation, and of course uninhabitable by a people depending on
agriculture for their subsistence.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ It was once thought of as an elitist clique of
affluent young white women preoccupied with balls, bazaars and
fashion shows, ``WASP to the max,'' as one puts it. But the Junior
League these days is taking some social stands that puts it at odds
with the conservative establishment. And lobbying on Capitol Hill in
behalf of the League's 188,000 members is a black woman.

   Bone china and brooches and sterling silver for
sale. Special guest rooms at New York's Waldorf-Astoria. Cookbooks
and calligraphy and a fancy private boarding school in the Virginia
hunt country.
   It's no surprise to find these advertisements in a recent issue
of the Junior League Review. But there's another side these days to
the genteel club founded by turn-of-the-century debutantes to
improve the lot of poor children.
   More often than not, today's league members work full time.
They're crusading for ``membership diversity.'' They've got a black
lobbyist on Capitol Hill. And they're promoting things like mandated
job leaves for new parents, pitting themselves against conservatives
and corporations.
   That's not exactly the profile that comes to mind when one thinks
of the Junior League. ``WASP to the max'' is the more apt
description given by Karen Hendricks, the lobbyist.
   But she is living evidence that league membership is no longer
reserved for ``the white, upper-middle-income woman who doesn't work
outside the home, has two kids and a Volvo.''
   Nonetheless, much work remains if the group is to cast off its
image as an elitist clique preoccupied with balls, bazaars and
fashion shows.
   ``There's a lot of old baggage,'' sighs Hendricks, director of
the league's 4-year-old public policy office in Washington.
   She knows this firsthand, thanks to repeated encounters with
people who are nonplussed simply by the color of her skin.
   Once Hendricks was waiting to see a senator with two other
visitors _ a white woman and a white man. An aide arrived and
approached the white woman.
   ``You must be with the Junior League,'' the aide said. The woman
demurred. The aide next went over to the white man. Wrong again. It
finally dawned on her that, yes, a black person was representing the
league.
   The Junior League did not get its white-gloved, upper-crust image
for nothing. But members say the substance of the organization has
been ignored by society reporters less interested in service
projects than the cookbooks and cotillions that pay for them. Their
purpose, they maintain, is far from frivolous and has not wavered
since 1901.
   That was the year Mary Harriman, sister of the late New York Gov.
Averell Harriman, and her friend Nathalie Henderson founded the
Junior League to aid the slum tenement movement begun by Jane
Addams. The young women and their debutante friends were in such
demand as fund-raisers and volunteers that by 1907 their mission had
shifted to a broader goal of neighborhood improvement.
   Now there are 277 Junior Leagues with 188,000 members in the
United States, Canada, Mexico and Great Britain under the auspices
of the Association of Junior Leagues International. More than half
of the active members (as opposed to sustainers, who have
``graduated'' at age 45 to different types of community work) are
employed full time.
   Individual leagues run the gamut from two that have gone on
record in favor of abortion rights to others that stick to tea and
symphonies. Museum programs and historical preservation remain
hallmarks of some local leagues. But others pursue grittier tasks
that take them into the nation's shelters, schools, hospitals and
juvenile courts.
   They are working with AIDS babies, foster children, handicapped
children, the homeless, battered women, alcoholic women and
high-risk adolescents. They are trying to prevent teen-age pregnancy
and serving as mentors to disadvantaged young girls. They have
founded and staffed child care centers and referral networks. They
are even fighting pollution.
   Reflecting the times, the association has a special program to
help volunteers translate their skills into paying jobs. But the
greatest shifts in recent years have been efforts to broaden
membership and develop some lobbying clout.
   Since forming a diversification committee in 1978, the
association has been phasing out onerous entry requirements and
stressing the need to attract minority women.
   In the past, according to former association president Maridel
Moulton of Moraga, Calif., leagues could impose a residency
requirement of any number of years and some sought eight or nine
sponsors and letters of reference.
   The most a league can now require from a prospective member is a
year of residency and four sponsors, who usually serve now as
mentors rather than gatekeepers. Incoming members also must be under
40 and committed to voluntarism.
   There are no demographic statistics available, so it's hard to
say whether the membership is less white or wealthy as a result of
the changes. According to Moulton, black women have been members for
decades but ``the numbers haven't been there. ... You will still
probably find some Junior Leagues that have no blacks. And there are
some with a representative number from their communities.''
   Local leagues concerned about foster care prompted the
association to take its first political positions in 1978. Since
then, guided by initiatives from its grass roots, the association
has pressed the federal government on welfare reform, civil rights,
child care and other social issues.

   A staid reputation, close community ties and well-placed
corporate and political connections make the Junior League a valued
ally.
   ``They are the backbone of upper-middle class voluntarism. They
bring the stamp of approval of mainstream America,'' says Judith
Lichtman, president of the Women's Legal Defense Fund. ``Their women
represent some of the more establishment sectors of society. Very
often they have entree to members of Congress that we don't have.
They are truly non-partisan. They don't necessarily just speak to
progressives or liberals.''
   The High Point, N.C., league brought many of these qualities to
bear in a successful battle to prevent chemical dumping in a creek
feeding the city's primary water supply. At issue was a permit
sought by Ashland Chemical to build an industrial chemical
repackaging plant.
   Alerted by Water Watch, a tiny local citizens group, league
members researched Ashland's record and the effect of the chemicals
in question. They announced a hearing on the permit in a newspaper
ad, at PTA meetings and church suppers, in flyers and phone calls.
They even offered to chauffeur people who were afraid to go downtown
at night.
   ``The publicity was terribly important because most people in
town were not aware of the danger this particular plant
represented,'' says June Stackhouse, acting president of Water
Watch. ``We were a small core group of 35 or 40. They had a lot of
contacts ... a lot of connections with people with clout. They
helped us pack the hearing and it really paid off.''
   Hendricks attributes much of the league's effectiveness to ``who
people think we are, rather than what we do.'' Many leagues are at
the cutting edge of social issues, she says, despite the persistent
image of ``little ladies'' donating time to innocuous, insignificant
projects.
   One illustration of the image gap:
   In 1986, the association was pushing for bills to expand the
federal child care role and require businesses to make unpaid,
job-protected leaves available to new parents. Both measures gave
conservatives apoplexy.
   But that was also the year a Washington lecture agency advertised
in the league magazine that it specialized ``in the unique needs of
Junior League Programs'' with speakers such as Charlton Heston and
Phyllis Schlafly, both rock-ribbed conservatives.
   Which is not to say a more traditional league wouldn't welcome
speakers such as Heston and Schlafly. Maybe the one in Richardson,
Texas, for example.
   The 450-member league in a Dallas suburb cares for a historic
home, tutors illiterate adults and helps pay for and run a summer
recreation program for handicapped children. Recently it sponsored a
benefit performance by a troupe of disabled puppeteers. It also
gives money to hard-pressed community groups serving battered women,
the homeless and others.
   What pays for all of this? An annual charity ball. Last year it
netted $175,000, said league president Meredith McClure.
   McClure, 37, a part-time administrative assistant with two
children, characterized her members as ``very conservative'' and
said they are not particularly active in politics. But she says the
league is in close touch with the national association and generally
supports its positions.
   ``The one thing we can always seem to agree on is child
welfare,'' she says.
   McClure says that even includes support for the federal parental
leave bill, a favorite target of conservatives and the business
community which co-sponsors or underwrites many league projects and
with which so many members are closely associated.
   ``These women are business owners or are married to business
owners. They can do what they do because of money from business,''
Hendricks explained.
   Nevertheless, when parental leave came up in the House in May,
Hendricks was at the entrance to the chamber, grabbing members to
champion the bill _ right next to lobbyists from the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce and other business groups intent on blocking passage. They
were unsuccessful.
   League officials maintain their alliance with feminist and
medical groups on parental leave is nothing unusual, given an
89-year tradition of concern for children and families. But they do
acknowledge an evolution in tactics since the long-ago day that Mary
Harriman walked into a tenement house in New York City.
   ``You start wondering how you can change the system,'' says Sally
Orr of New York City, a member for nearly 35 years. ``The Junior
Leagues realized they had to influence the regulatory and
legislative process to get changes in their community.''
   Suzanne Plihcik of Greensboro, N.C., who became president of the
association in May, says political muscle is now very important to
the leagues' mission. Among the reasons: women have less time to
volunteer, while social problems are increasingly broad and complex.
   ``We have looked at more comprehensive and effective approaches
to doing the same things,'' Plihcik says. ``It is imperative that we
change with the world. But our basic values and goals remain the
same. Everything is aimed at community improvement.''

   Pete Fountain still has to blow his clarinet
for a living, and he blames it all on ``zaps'' from God.
   There Pete stands, coming up on age 60, short, square, with white
goatee and mustache. Bald as a peeled onion. He's fronting a
seven-man band onstage in a lush saloon and regaling a convention
crowd with smooth Dixieland jazz.
   Fountain calls it a saloon, which is his right since he owns the
joint. Nightclub might be a more accurate term.
   It's a jewel of a bandbox, crimson and black with gold trim, 500
seats, located in a thriving hotel beside the Mississippi River at
the center of New Orleans.
   Sounds like he's all set, right?
   But heck, you always got a pea under the mattress. Fountain's pea
is that he has played the stuff the crowd likes thousands of times.

Orleans,'' ``Memphis Blues,'' ``Basin Street Blues,'' ``Columbus
Stockade Blues,'' ``The Yellow Dog Blues''...and on and on.
   All grand old tunes, but enough already.
   What Fountain had rather do is be a millionaire, lounging beside
an Olympic-size swimming pool behind a plantation house, a cool
glass of sparkling water in hand (no more bourbon, please, hide that
vodka). No worries. If he plays, he plays what he likes, not what
the crowd likes.
   Pete might be relaxing by that pool right now except for a slight
flaw in character _ he can lose money faster than he can make it.
   During 30 years as a saloon owner, slaving over a hot clarinet
onstage or in a recording studio, the money rolled in _ and the
money rolled out.
   ``I've made it,'' he says, ``but I have also made some very bad
investments.''
   The worst one was the purchase of a handsome hotel overlooking
the blue Gulf of Mexico in Biloxi, Miss., some 70 miles east of New
Orleans.
   ``I thought owning a hotel would be the greatest thing in the
world,'' he says. ``Then I lost it. Down the tube.''
   A chunk of Fountain money went into the 1984 New Orleans World's
Fair. The fair wound up losing all investor input and about $100
million besides.
   Other ventures along the way included a string of convenience
stores. Zap. There was something called Pete's Wieners and Famous
Frozen Custard. Zap.
   ``I could write a book on a lot of the things that I got into,''
he said.
   ``I used to say if I had the hotel I could play just one day a
week. But, naaah. It's like, you know, you're gonna play. Any time I
try anything else God zaps me. It's like He said, `I've given you
this talent and, damn it, you're gonna DO it. You're gonna play, no
matter what.'''
   Fountain was playing with trumepter Al Hirt in a French Quarter
nightclub 32 years ago when his big break came.
   It was a call from, of all people, Lawrence Welk, a shrewd
entertainer whose square, upright musical style was a joke in the
jazz circles where Pete Fountain labored.
   Would Mr. Fountain bring his clarinet and join the Welk band as a
featured sideman? Yes indeedy.
   Maybe it wasn't jazz, but the Welk musical hour was a top
television show of that day. The audience was in the millions.
   ``You didn't get rich with Lawrence Welk but you got a lot of
exposure,'' Fountain says. ``And he loves jazz.''
   He spent two years on the show, working jazz clubs on the side.
   ``Welk always said he would make my name a household word. He
taught me a little. I used to want to play the things I wanted to
play. But I realized you have to play the things that people want to
hear you play, not what you want to hear you play.''
   Fountain has hewed to this philosophy through an output of 85
record albums, three of them achieving gold status, and 54 guest
stints on Johnny Carson's TV show.
   Fountain and his band made their fifth command performance for
the president at a state dinner in Washington on April 26.
   A popular guy around New Orleans, Fountain has one big annual
blowout that has become a fixture of Mardi Gras.
   The Half Fast Walking Club is a sight to behold as Fountain and
about 150 old buddies put on masks and fancy dress and stagger four
miles through the tremendous crowd packed along the Rex parade route.
   In addition to working at his own saloon four nights a week,
Fountain and his band do one-night stands at conventions or concerts
here and there.
   To do this, he overcame a desperate fear of flying.
   Friends said the only way you got Pete Fountain on an airliner in
the old days was to fill him full of booze, carry him on board and
dump him in his seat like a sack of potatoes.
   No more.
   You have to travel fast if you want to work fat extra gigs in
faraway places.
   Those lucrative extras are even more necessary if your hobby is
acquiring and caring for classic cars.
   ``If you want to play with the cars, the Rolls Royces and
different things, you have to fly to pay for it,'' Fountains says.
``I'm a car junkie, a car nut.''
   In giving up on getting rich, Fountain also gave up hard likker.
Maybe a little wine now and then.
   Long before he gave up booze, Fountain gave up hair. He snatched
off his toupee and threw it at the drummer during a stand in Las
Vegas 20 years ago.
   ``What happened, I wanted to keep up with the kids. I got two or
three toupees made a year. Each time the hair was a little longer.
It got down over my shoulder. I finally realized, what the hell am I
trying to do? You can't keep up with these kids. So that night in
Vegas I got rid of it. It was soaking wet with sweat. It was like
wearing a mop on your head.''

   EDITOR'S NOTE _ They are mostly descendants of the Tartars, the
``Golden Horde'' of barbarians that galloped out of the Crimea in
the 13th century to vanquish Russia and pillage Poland. Tiny
enclaves of Moslems hang on in overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Poland,
clinging desperately to their ethnic traditions.

   It is possible to face Mecca even from
this remote hamlet hard against the Soviet border.
   Two Moslem families live on here, tending a tiny wooden mosque
and a hillside cemetery where gravestones topped with crescent moons
bear names like Kozakiewicz etched in Polish and Arabic.
   The 3,000 Moslem Poles are a little-known enclave in a noticeably
homogenous nation now more than 93 percent Roman Catholic.
   But Moslems have lived in Poland for six centuries and, they say,
form the world's oldest such community in lands never ruled by
Moslems.
   Most are direct descendants of the Tartars who galloped out of
the Crimea, vanquished Russia and pillaged Poland.
   The note ``destroyed by the Tartars'' describes monument after
monument in Polish guidebooks, and Polish radio plays daily the
broken-off call of a Krakow trumpeter sounding the alarm of a Tartar
attack before being felled by an arrow to the throat.
   Every schoolchild learns the date _ April 9, 1241 _ when the
Tartars' first conquest of Poland reached as far west as Legnica,
130 miles from Berlin. The battle there left the most powerful
Polish prince, Henryk the Pious, chopped into so many pieces it is
said his mother could only identify him by the six toes on one foot.
   This onslaught of the ``Golden Horde'' left a terror of barbarian
invaders from the East that echoes through Polish political life to
this day.
   But when the Tartars did not battle the Poles, they fought
alongside them _helping defend Poland against every invader from the
Teutonic knights at Grunwald in 1410 to the Germans in 1939
   ``I am Polish, of Moslem background,'' emphasizes Ali Popluwski,
hobbled by a German bullet to his leg inflicted while the occupiers
turned the Kruszyniany mosque into a World War II field hospital.
   Popluwski is the mosque caretaker but there is no imam, or
religious leader, anymore. One comes to lead prayers on the highest
holidays from Bialystok, a city an hour away where the several
hundred Moslems hold services in an apartment living room.
   More frequent are the tourists' visits, up to 1,000 a day on
holidays. They are mainly the Middle East Arabs who, shunned
elsewhere, were particularly welcome in Poland while its Communist
regime snubbed the West.
   Some set up tents in nearby cow pastures, but most come and go in
glossy foreign cars, bumping down the single-lane dirt and cobbled
lane after leaving their Polish brethren a little money on a silver
tray.
   It is enough to keep the mosque in prayer rugs, but not to
fulfill the life wish of a 77-year-old Moslem trying to mind his
religious heritage in a village of a couple of dozen farmers without
phones or indoor plumbing 144 miles east of Warsaw.
   ``Everybody dreams of going to Mecca but you need 2,000 green
ones (U.S. dollars) to go to Mecca, not red money,'' Popluwski says.
   Still he proudly thumbs the register of visitors, many bringing
messages from the Holy City. He has seen seven thick books filled.
   ``I hope someone will maintain the tradition when I go,'' he says.
   There are only two other mosques in Poland. One is equally
remote, tiny and wooden, also dating to the 1670s, and located in
the nearby border village of Bohoniki, where five or six Moslem
families remain.
   The other opened this spring in Gdansk, made possible by the
donations of Arab students and funds raised by organizing trips to
Turkey for Poles who go to trade, not tour.
   The new mosque, the first in the country for nearly 200 years, is
less a sign of a resurgent community than of the determination of
the 120 or so Moslems who settled in the Baltic port city as postwar
refugees from Soviet-annexed eastern Poland.
   The Stalin-drawn border cut through a cluster of Moslem villages
in what had been eastern Poland, leaving all but Kruszyniany and
Bohoniki in the Soviet Union.
   Many Moslems were deported with other Poles to Siberia, but
others fled west into modern Poland. By 1947, they had held their
first registration, counting 1,100 from a prewar population of about
5,500.
   A Moslem historian who participated in the first postwar count in
Gdansk won't allow his name to be used. He's tired, he says, of
having his faith treated as an exotic curiosity in Poland. But he
speaks proudly of his people's accomplishments against the odds of
religious and political repression.
   Tartars, many prisoners of war, began to settle Polish lands
during the 15th century, becoming loyal subjects of their adopted
kings. Largely through royal reward for military service, they began
to accumulate wealth, land and the civic rights of the nobility,
writes Warsaw University's Jan Tyszkiewicz.
   But poverty set in during the 16th century when a law was passed
barring non-Christion landowners from having Christian serfs.
   Tartars had to sell off their lands. Many sought military
careers, or entered professions or trade, living on as an
identifiable community through Poland's disappearance from the map
at the end of the 18th century.
   Living under the Russians through the 19th century, Moslems
suffered with the rest of the Polish nation. In the graveyard at
Kruszyniany, the headstones of Moslem Poles who died during the
1800s are written, as required by law, in Russian Cyrillic letters.
   Many Moslem and Arabic texts, including the Koran, were
translated into Polish and Lithuanian, but the ability to speak the
Tartar tongue was largely lost.
   ``There are very big difficulties because the Moslems in Poland
have been cut off from contacts with the Moslem world for 300
years,'' the Gdansk historian said.
   In Kruszyniany, the Golden Horde Cafe is closed, and Arabic
writing on the bus ticket kiosk has been painted over. Popluwski's
granddaughter has moved with her mother to Bialystok where she can
learn Moslem traditions.
   But in Warsaw, where 150 to 200 Moslems live, a blueprint for a
mosque has been drawn and construction is to start this year, funds
permitting.
   And in Gdansk, the historian is optimistic the centuries of
Moslem tradition will continue in Poland.
   ``Unquestionably, I am convinced it will survive,'' he said.
``The traditions are very highly developed. This tradition once was
connected with noblemen and now it is more connected with ethnic
pride.''

   Dawnn Lewis, star of NBC's ``A Different
World,'' got her start on the show writing the lyrics for the theme
song.
   ``The composer, Stu Gardner, didn't know me as an actress,'' says
Lewis, who broke into show business singing jingles for commercials.
``When I auditioned for the role I didn't tell them I co-wrote the
theme until I was hired.''
   She also has been asked to sing the national anthem at the World
Series, provided the San Diego Padres win the National League
pennant first.
   That invitation came from Tom Werner, the team's new owner and
partner in Carsey-Werner, the production team that created ``A
Different World.''
   Lewis plays Jaleesa Vinson, an older, divorced student at
fictional Hillman College who got her degree at the end of the
season.
   She says she doesn't know what her graduation means for Jaleesa's
future.
   ``Whether that means I come back as a graduate student or a
teacher or get a job hasn't been decided,'' she says. ``We're
getting some new writers and we'll meet with them in the summer to
talk about our characters.''
   Lewis is the only member of the cast from the pilot who's still
with the show. It made its debut three years ago as a spinoff of
``The Cosby Show'' starring Lisa Bonet.
   Bonet, married to musician Lenny Kravitz, left at the end of the
first season when she became pregnant and has since returned to the
Bill Cosby show.
   The show also stars Jasmine Guy as a spoiled debutante, plus
Kadeem Hardison, Cree Summer, Charnele Brown, Darryl Bell, Glynn
Turman, Sinbad and Lou Myers.
   ``Jaleesa is honest, young at heart, sassy and always has
something to say about someone else's opinion,'' Lewis says. ``She
makes comments that you can't get mad about because they're true.
   ``Jaleesa's in focus. She has a game plan. She wants to be
stylish, although she doesn't always hit the mark.''
   Lewis grew up in Brooklyn, and during high school rode the subway
for an hour and 20 minutes every day to attend New York's High
School of Music and Art in Harlem.
   ``I'd get to school an hour early,'' she says. ``I'd meet my
friends for breakfast, and no matter how early I got there I was
always late for my first class.''
   She was accepted by several colleges, but chose the University of
Miami and graduated magna cum laude in 1982 with a degree in music.
   ``I applied to Brooklyn College to please my parents,'' she says.
``I graduated from high school when I was 16 and I wanted to leave
New York. The temptation to get a job was too strong if I stayed
there, so I wanted to get away. My grandmother had recently moved to
Miami, so that made it easier on my parents.
   ``I was Miami's first musical graduate,'' she says.
   ``I was the kind of kid who would figure out something and make
it work. You couldn't tell me I couldn't do it.''
   Although Lewis lives in Los Angeles, where she is active in
community volunteer work, she still considers New York her home. She
has bought a house here and is working on music for a new album.
   ``I thought when I came here that being on television would be my
biggest adjustment,'' she says. ``Just being here is the biggest
adjustment. I'm not an L.A. person. It's so different. The energy's
different.
   ``The standards are different. A 16-year-old here can have a car.
At 16 I was worried about having enough tokens for the bus and
subway.
   ``And coming here as a celebrity makes it even harder because you
have to fit into a mold. You have to drive the right kind of car,
you have to see the right people, you have to say the right thing.''

   The miracle, to hear Eileen Atkins describe it, is
that she succeeded as an actress at all.
   ``It's incredibly hard, and I don't care what anybody says, for
people from my kind of background to get into the theater and become
a classical actress,'' says the British star of ``Prin,'' currently
playing off-Broadway at the Manhattan Theater Club.
   That background refers to the British working-class. Atkins's
father read gas meters; her mother made dresses. To both her
parents, acting meant entertainment in the most lowbrow sense _ not
the meaty, wide-ranging roles that have distinguished her career.
   ``My mother wanted me to be a chorus girl because I tap-danced,''
she recalls. ``When I got to 12 and said, `I'm going to do
Shakespeare,' people thought I was crackers.''
   More than 40 years later, the joke's on them. A veteran of
Broadway and the West End, last year she won London's equivalent of
the Tony Award for her performances in Shakespeare's ``Cymbeline''
and Harold Pinter's ``Mountain Language'' at the Royal National
Theater.
   At 55, Atkins belongs to that world class of British actresses
that includes Vanessa Redgrave, Glenda Jackson, Judi Dench and
Maggie Smith. She shares with them a distinctively unglamorous
British beauty _ face sharp and angular, eyes suggesting inner
strength and wisdom.
   How did she reach the top? ``Sheer bloody obstinacy,'' she says,
and a teacher named Mr. Burton.
   ``My mother sent me with a note to school saying I would do
better if I spoke nicely, as she put it,'' Atkins recalls.
   The main drama teacher wanted 7 shillings and sixpence a week,
then about $2.50, to iron out young Eileen's Cockney accent.
   ``My mother said, `We can't afford it.' This man caught hold of
me in the corridor and said, `I'll teach you for nothing if you come
whenever I tell you to and stay for as long as I want you to, and
there's no argument about anything,''' she said.
   Atkins spent an hour after school with Mr. Burton for the next
five years, and he first took her to the legitimate theater. Today,
her voice betrays no trace of her roots. She has lost touch with
Burton, and as far as she knows, he has never come to see her on
stage.
   In ``Prin,'' by Andrew Davies, Atkins plays a lesbian
headmistress of a women's teacher training college whose exacting
idealism brings about her collapse.
   Sheila Hancock won acclaim, and an Olivier Award nomination, for
originating the role in the West End last winter, but Atkins plans a
fresh approach. ``I cannot bear playing something I have seen
somebody do,'' she says.
   She says she has heard ``Prin'' dismissed as a cross between
``The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' about an autocratic Scottish
teacher, and ``The Killing of Sister George,'' the play that broke
the taboo on portraying lesbianism on the British stage.
   But she remains fascinated by the title character's mixture of
charisma and cruelty.
   ``She only cares about standards, about going for the
truth...Some people won't like her and some people will, but I'm
certainly not going to woo the audience to like me.''
   Atkins hasn't acted in the United States since her harrowing
performance as the schizophrenic ``Mary Barnes'' at the Long Wharf
Theater in New Haven, Conn., in 1980.
   She has appeared four times on Broadway, starting with her 1966
debut in ``The Killing of Sister George,'' opposite Beryl Reid. That
role earned her a Tony nomination for best actress as did her
Elizabeth I to Claire Bloom's Mary Queen of Scots in the 1972
``Vivat! Vivat Regina!''
   Atkins has consciously eschewed stardom, preferring British
repertory to star vehicles and passing up the chance to act in
``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' the acclaimed television series that she
and Jean Marsh co-created.
   She was the producers' first choice for the part of Sarah, the
maid, which made a star out of Pauline Collins. Atkins doesn't
regret it.
   ``You get known as Hudson or Rose and then it takes you forever
to get out of it again,'' she says.
   ``I would find it boring to play the same part continuously for a
long time.
   ``To me, the interesting thing about work is finding the
character, and the rehearsal. I like licking each part, and once
you've done that, all you have left is learning it every week.''
   Film roles have included vivid supporting performances in
``Equus'' (1977) and ``The Dresser'' (1983), but she lost a part in
``Room with a View'' to her friend Judi Dench.
   ``I didn't really think about the cinema when I was young,
because if you looked like me, you weren't a film star,'' she says.
   ``I was brought up to think I was extremely plain; now I look
back and say, `You're adorable.'''
   Her self-deprecating manner drops only once, when she gloats
about finally getting a driving license.
   ``It's pretty good at 55 to learn to drive,'' she says. ``I think
I'm prouder of that than anything.''

   My father is dying.
   It is my worst childhood dread, the terror in the night come
true. I sit by his bed and hold his hand, trying to ward off my
fears. I am failing in my duty. I cannot save him.
   There is a scene in the film ``Terms of Endearment'' where the
mother stands at the nurses station and screams for another pain
shot for her terminally ill daughter. Now I, too, stand at a nurses
station and say quietly, politely: ``I think it is time for my dad's
shot.''
   They look up at me, these kids, many of them young enough to be
my own daughters, and say, ``OK, we'll get it in a minute,'' and
then go back to talking about last night's date, a friend's birthday
party.
   I feel my face contort. I have become Frankenstein. I stand there
and fidget, my hands balling into fists, my eyes welling with tears.
My eyelids are already so swollen I can hardly bear to touch them. I

   Metamorphosen; Duet-Concertino for Clarinet &amp; Bassoon; Prelude to
Capriccio, Op. 85; by Richard Strauss (CBS) _ New Stockholm Chamber
Orchestra, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen; Paul Meyer, clarinet;
Knut Sonstevold, bassoon.
   Strauss (1864-1949) wrote these works in the 1940s, during the
last decade of his life. Long gone were the years of his tremendous
success as an opera composer, his reputation as a master of
ever-increasing orchestation, his fame as a conductor and even his
decline in critical opinion into a composer of mere talent and no
longer genius.
   John Cage was in his 30s, Arnold Schoenberg was in his 60s and
70s, and music being composed at the time bore little resemblance to
the early world of Strauss, who began writing music when the giants
were Brahms, Saint-Saen, Dvorak, Tchaikovsky and Bruckner.
   In these last years, Strauss didn't change nor did the power of
his music.
   The Metamorphosen are a distillation of his swirling, lush,
Romantic style. The funeral march from Beethoven's Eroica symphony
appears throughout, and at the end of the score Strauss wrote ``In
Memoriam,'' presumably for a destroyed Germany.
   Salonen produces a sinewy, subtle interpretation of this work of
extraordinary richness and intensity. He suddenly lifts out a brief
line and puts it back in favor of another. The dynamic range is
broad, though the recorded sound somewhat dry.
   The Duet-Concertino is a rarely heard gem. Its sunny, airy
quality provides a nice contrast. The soloists play freely and with
an openness of character. The prelude to Capriccio, Strauss' final
opera, serves as a nice reconciliation of the Metamorphoses'
intensity and the duet's lightness. We are back to the style of Der
Rosenkavalier, a clear reminder of a different world.

   ``Songs For Drella'' (Sire) _ Lou Reed and John Cale
   
   Lou Reed and John Cale's ``Songs for Drella'' is the rare rock
performance that would sound more appropriate in a drawing room or
theater than on an album.
   The two former members of the Velvet Underground were
commissioned to honor Andy Warhol, their artistic co-conspirator in
the 1960s. They returned with a 15-song tribute that is part
brilliant, part aggravating and always compelling.
   It's a tribute without tears. Like theater, it works far better
as a single musical piece to be experienced in one sitting than on a
disc that can be returned to frequently.
   ``Songs for Drella'' loosely chronicles Warhol's life and the
artist's influence on the Velvets, from the explosive creativity in
the 1960s to the disillusionment of Warhol's final years. Enough
artistic license is taken for Reed and Cale to label the work ``a
fiction.''
   The best moments are the two Reed songs that bookend the disc.
``Small Town'' describes an artist's young life in a town he yearned
to escape. The album closes with Reed figuratively standing over
Warhol's grave. He admits to resentments ``that can never be
unmade,'' but expresses the universal wish he'd talked more with his
friend while he was still alive.
   Musically, the limited palette used by Reed and Cale does not
invite repeated listenings. The instrumentation is essentially
guitar and keyboard, with a few added colorings. Neither Red nor
Cale is a strong or expressive singer and their deliveries are
sometimes deadening.
   One consumer note: With records dying, here's a good example of
the type of creative CD packaging that could stop any pining for
album covers. It's a handsome grouping of words and pictures with
sharp black packaging. The CD itself is set apart as a fluorescent
portrait of Warhol. It looks terrific.

<HEAD>Star Watch: Directing Is Like Getting ``Pecked to Death''</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget all those high-flown comments about the
joys of directing movies. Now hear plain-talking Bob Hoskins: ``It's
like being pecked to death by a thousand pigeons.''
   The London actor makes his directorial bow with ``The Raggedy
Rawney,'' which drew mixed reviews in New York and now is being
released slowly across the country.
   ``It wasn't my idea,'' says Hoskins. ``I was in Australia, and
the producer, Bob Weis, was talking about ideas for films. I told
him the old gypsy legend, I think from the 100 Years War. I told him
the story and said, `This would make a good film.'
   ``He leapt up in the air and said, `Right! Give me a script.
You'll direct it. We'll do it in Czechoslovakia.' I said, `Oh? Will
we?' It all came about through nepotism. He's a close friend of
mine, and the crew was all family, close friends.''
   Hoskins and Nicole De Wilde wrote the script, concerning a young
soldier who deserts in wartime and joins a band of gypsies,
disguising himself as a ``rawney,'' a gypsy term for a half-wit with
unusual powers. George Harrison's Handmade Films provided the $5
million budget, and Hoskins and crew went off to Czechoslovakia for
the filming.
   Hoskins, who had done some directing in the theater, was not
fazed by the tight budget. ``You can film an epic if you can figure
out a way of doing it,'' he reasoned. For instance, he staged a
horse race ``in a small yard'' by carefully selecting camera angles.
   Concerning his ``pecked to death'' comment: ``Everybody's got
questions for you. They follow you into the loo (toilet), they're
banging on the door. `What pair of shoes d'ya want?' `I dunno; wear
the shoes that fit ya.'
   ``There's no break at all. The minute you get up, questions. They
go on all the time. Some can't do their job until they've had an
answer from you.''
   He partly solved the problem when the cast presented him with a
hat that was marked ``actor'' on one side and ``director'' on the
other. ``When I wore the `actor' side, the crew wasn't allowed to
ask me questions,'' said Hoskins, who plays the leader of the gypsy
band.
   ``The Raggedy Rawney'' was filmed before the ``velvet
revolution'' toppled communist rule. Hoskins and the rest of the
company came to admire the Czechs who worked on the film, but they
recognized certain barriers.
   ``My translator was a wonderful guy who translated into Czech
three words behind me,'' said Hoskins. ``Sometimes I would go on
about the regime, and he said to me, `Bob, don't say those things in
front of me. I'm supposed to report you. And if I don't, they're
going to report me.' So we figured out that every time I wanted to
say something, I'd scratch my head and we'd go for a walk.''
   One factor helped Hoskins survive the hard days of filming:
``Great beer there, wonderful beer. I asked the guy who picked the
locations: `How come there's always a really good bar near these
places?' And there was. Great beer! That's where the original
Budweiser comes from.''
   Bob Hoskins was born in Suffolk on Oct. 16, 1942, and his parents
moved to London two weeks later, just in time for a German bombing.
His life has been somewhat rambunctious ever since. He quit school
at 15, wandered from job to job until he happened into an acting
audition by mistake. He won a lead role and he hasn't stopped
working.
   While his fellow actors boast of training at drama academies,
Hoskins says, ``I actually learned from watching women. I never had
a class or was taught to act. What I realized was that women have
had to keep their mouths shut for thousands of years, but they can
express themselves very clearly without saying a word.
   ``But a guy always hides. What drama is is about the private
moment. It's very difficult for a man to show the private moment.
It's got nothing to do with femininity; it's a language. I wouldn't
say a body language. It's just a language. Telepathy maybe.''
   Hoskins has had a busy schedule. He has finished ``Mermaids''
with Cher and a thriller, ``Shattered,'' and next plays a detective
in ``Plastic Nightmare'' with Tom Berenger. Most of his work has
been in this country, but he declines to change his London base _
``I couldn't take the kids away from their grandparents.''
   He commented ruefully that his wife dislikes his many absences
and his kids Rosa, 6, and Jack, 4, ``are beginning to call me
`uncle.'''
   Though nominated for an Academy Award for his work in ``Mona
Lisa,'' Hoskins' most successful film has been the blockbusting
``Who Framed Roger Rabbit?''
   Will he be around for a sequel?
   ``I don't think they (Disney) will make one. It was wonderful, an
experience I wouldn't miss for the world. But to do it again? By the
time we finished, everyone was on their knees. Oh, that was tough!''

   These days, it's possible to find public school students getting
music appreciation lessons from Hershey's chocolate, reading lessons
from Pizza Hut, or tips on fighting air pollution from Arco.
   Alarmed at the slow pace of school reform, big business and
educators are putting aside long-standing suspicions to join in
common cause to help students become the intelligent, productive
workers the nation needs to remain competitive.
   But this ever-closer relationship is posing tough choices for
educators _ perhaps nowhere more so than in the area of curriculum.
   Scores of corporations, labor unions and other outside groups _
no one knows exactly how many _ are making tempting offers of
curricular materials to schools, either free or at a nominal charge.
   The catch is that such materials sometimes amount to free
advertising, may contain subtle propaganda, or simply do not fit the
educational goals or objectives of a given school or school district.
   Some critics worry that schools are becoming marketplaces for
commercial messages, not ideas.
   Among the most recent offerings: a curriculum on labor history by
the United Auto Workers, and a flashy educational video called ``Car
Smart'' by Atlantic Richfield (Arco) featuring stars like Olivia
Newton-John and Melissa Gilbert urging students to fight pollution
by driving less, maintaining cars carefully and traveling light.
   Another hot new offering is a brochure, ``How to Enjoy a
Symphony,'' issued by Hershey Chocolate USA designed to help
youngsters enjoy their first musical encounters.
   Not coincidentally, the brochure bears the name of Hershey's new
``Symphony'' candy bar.
   The debate intensified earlier this year when Channel One began
beaming educational newscasts into thousands of classrooms around
the country. Whittle Communications, which produced the programming,
offered schools free video equipment. Schools, for their part, had
to guarantee students would watch it, commercials and all.
   Arthur Lebowitz, principal of South Mountain High School in
Phoenix, says his school had explored using Channel One, ``but we
have been reluctant to pursue that because we have to obligate a
certain amount of class time.''
   But his school is using an applied economics curriculum plugging
the theme of free enterprise put out by Junior Achievement.
   ``There are some curricula that are downright misleading and we
have urged schools to be very, very cautious in adopting them,''
says Gordon Cawelti, executive director of the Association for
Supervision and Curriculum Development, which recently recommended
guidelines to help schools choose.
   According to ASCD, schools should be sure that any such material:
   _ ``is consistent with the values, goals and objectives of the
educational program'';
   _ ``responds to a clearly understood educational need'';
   _ ``supports and does not undermine implicity or explicitly an
existing curriculum and instruction message;''
   _ ``has been considered and assessed by groups with different
views.''
   Daniel Merenda, executive director of the National Association of
Partners in Education, which fosters school-business partnerships,
adds this caution: ``Our premise is that materials should be
developed jointly, with teachers, so that you take the question of
bias out of it.''
   Some business-generated curricula are considered excellent and
have caught on phenomenally. Pizza Hut's three-year-old ``Book It!''
is a reading incentive program for grades one through six.
   Dr. Carolyn Hughes, Oklahoma City's assistant superintendent in
charge of curriculum and program development, says the district
generally shys from using corporate-produced curricula.
   ``Just because it's free doesn't mean we're going to use it,''
she says.
   But ``Book It!'' is a welcome exception in her district.
   ``It obviously has marketing value, but it does motivate kids to
read,'' she says.
   More recently, more than 20,000 public schools have snapped up
the ``Healthy Choices for Young Americans'' curriculum offered two
months ago free of charge by the Washington state Apple Commission.
   At the 9th Street Elementary School in Los Angeles, for example,
fourth-grade teacher Mike Romero is using that curriculum to get his
pupils to keep food journals, brush their teeth after meals and do
sit-ups and other exercises.
   In Tulsa, Okla., Amoco has for years supplied local elementary
and middle schools with science curricula aimed at promoting
experimentation.
   Utility companies were early pioneers in developing curricula _
not always to universal applause.
   In 1979, a book titled ``Hucksters in the Classrooms'' by Sheila
Harty, criticized corporations, including utility companies, for
offering schools one-sided, propagandistic lessons.
   Since then, utilities have learned some lessons, says Janet
White, educational services representative of the Edison Electric
Institute in Washington.
   ``The curricula we are most proud of are developed cooperatively,
with the utility being one player, along with the state department
of education or school district,'' says White.
   For example, Pennsylvania Power and Light worked with an advisory
panel of teachers to develop a ``power concepts'' curriculum for
kindergarten through 12th grade. It includes lessons in how to
measure energy, the pros and cons of different energy options,
including nuclear energy. It's designed to fit into existing general
science curricula.
   Likewise, Puget Sound Power and Light in Washington state and
Boston Edison in Massachusetts have worked with educators to develop
environmental curricula.
   Even though such corporate-sponsored curricula have improved in
recent years, critics like Harty still counsel caution.
   ``We must take precautions now to curb commercial exploitation in
the schools, lest our schools fall farther and farther from their
intellectual and social purposes,'' Harty wrote earlier this year.
``Do we really want the Jolly Green Giant teaching nutrition, Reddy
Kilowatt teaching energy, and chemical companies teaching about the
environment?''

   Ask Marilyn Alberts what she does for a
living, and she sounds like an agent for novelists, Nobelists and
poet laureates.
   She is an English teacher who is convinced that all of her
classes are filled with the greatest minds in the world.
   ``I come to school every day and I read the greatest works that
have ever been written about the greatest ideas that people deal
with _ love, honor, death, pain, sharing, gratitude _ with people
who are interesting and intelligent and happen at the moment to be
17 years old,'' she says.
   ``I should trade this for a computer, a bank tellers' job, a set
of law books, whatever? For mere money? Please!''
   Alberts, a fast talker with a sense of humor, developed this
``formula answer'' while at a cocktail party ``when someone
discovered I was a high school teacher and was quickly looking for
an exit to find someone more interesting.''
   She teaches 11th- and 12th-grade students at Bethesda-Chevy Chase
High School in a Washington, D.C., suburb. In April, she received an
honorary doctorate of humane letters from Georgetown University,
after being nominated by 16 of her former students who are now
undergraduates there.
   ``I don't think the teacher teaches the students,'' says Alberts,
whose gray hair forms bangs that give her a youthful look. ``I think
it's `a community of scholars.' That's the phrase I like to use with
the kids at the beginning of the year.
   ``I also tell the kids at the beginning of class, `I will come to
know who you were as you grew because of what you write about' ...
but I also have a sense of who you will become. This is a continuum.
You are the whole person that is both past, present and future.'
   ``That's why it's nice when the future comes back and says
`See,''' she says of the Georgetown honor.
   Alberts began working at Bethesda-Chevy Chase in 1978 and teaches
English, advanced composition and advanced placement English. This
year, she teaches all honors classes, and she is not too happy about
it.
   ``I think it's important to teach every level in the
curriculum,'' she says. ``I don't think you should get far away from
that for longer than a year.''
   But she enjoys working with juniors and seniors.
   ``They are finally willing to be free of that early adolescent
need to be like everybody else,'' she says. ``They really are
tentatively ready to trust themselves not to do that. It's fun to
watch them come out of that.''
   And she likes ``watching people learn to express themselves''
from the class scholars to ``frankly the ones who may not make it
out of school.''
   ``I know that sometime in that semester every person will write
at least one good line of poetry,'' she says, raising her forefinger
for emphasis. ``It just has to happen. If you can speak words it's
going to happen at some point. It always does.''
   Alberts was inspired to teach by a high school English teacher
who cried over a poem during class.
   ``We were all crucified with embarrassment for her,'' she says of
that experience, which later led her to write a poem: ``But what
could I do but become an English teacher too.''
   Bethesda-Chevy Chase is one of the oldest high schools in
Montgomery County, Md., and the English curriculum is
literature-based. Classwork includes discussions of Shakespearean
plays, Greek tragedies and other classics.
   While seniors work mainly on essays and poetry, juniors focus on
drama and fiction. It is in the junior year when students learn how
to write college-quality papers, she says.
   While Alberts will not use abridgements or ``easy versions'' of
the classical works, she is working to ``expand the canon'' by
including more works by women and minorities.
   Alberts seldom uses the word ``wrong'' and often allows students
to express their opinions as long as they can thoroughly support
their view.
   Some of the best work comes from students who don't do well in
English, she says, explaining that those students usually have
trouble with sequential or logical material but are clearly
imaginative.
   ``All of a sudden he hits this class and he puts these crazy
things together _ things that in the past teachers have said, `No
that's crazy, you're not logical' _ and I say, `God that's
wonderful!'''
   Chuckling at the thought, Alberts denies that her expectations
alone spurred the student to excel. ``It's there to be discovered.''
   The biggest disappointment for Alberts is knowing ``you've lost a
few.''
   ``If reality weren't reality, you'd hope you could save them
all,'' she says. ``There is always a sense of whoever didn't become
all he or she could be and if you could have done anything to change
that.''
   Alberts grew up in Sacramento, Calif. Her mother, now 93, was a
teacher in a one-room schoolhouse in Patterson, Calif. Her father
was general secretary of the YMCA. She received a bachelor's degree
in English from the University of California at Berkeley and was a
fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities at Stanford
University in 1986.
   Over the years, Alberts' teaching style has changed.
   ``I certainly was a lot more directive as a teacher than I am
now,'' she says. ``My preferred method now is to work with a book
that I have not read or not made up my mind about. I read it at the
same time the kids do. We really do deal with it together as a
`community of scholars.'
   ``I think I'm less judgmental than I used to be. I used to say
this is what you should learn, and I will test you on it. I think
that's a means to an end now. It's not an end in itself.''

   Daniel, a California teen-ager, was performing down to
expectations when he started high school. His typical grades on
tests and report cards were Ds and a few Fs _ just what his middle
school teachers had warned his high school teachers to anticipate.
   But what they didn't look for is that on standardized test
scores, Daniel (not his real name) performed at 12th-grade level in
English and 10th-grade level in mathematics. His grades, obviously,
didn't match his intelligence.
   The school counselor was asked to step in to find out why. He
discovered that the boy's mother had a hands-off attitude about her
son's schooling and that Daniel had such low self-esteem that his
laziness and poor grades seemed to be a way of telling himself that
he was no good.
   ``Building success is really the parents' job,'' says Darryl T.
Yagi, counselor at the Casa Grande High School in Petaluma, who has
been named Counselor of the Year by the American School Counselors
Association. ``They should have expectations of the kids. A lot of
times the parents won't do this.''
   Yagi, who also serves as counseling advisor to the Sylvan
Learning Centers, says that sometimes parents think the school will
take care of all learning problems. But sooner or later, they have
to acknowledge that a problem exists.
   ``The counselor is in a really good position to help because he
can call on a body of resources,'' says Yagi. He knows how to get
help from school staff, community agencies and the parents, among
others, to identify the problems and recommend solutions. At the
same time, he serves as a non-judgmental and non-emotional
intermediary for the student.
   ``Kids respond to the counselor because he can tell them how to
recognize and deal with problems. The kids feel good about
themselves.''
   In Daniel's case, the counselor pointed out the high test scores
to him, then worked with both the youngster and his mother to raise
their expectations of his abilities. He was enrolled in a
pre-algebra class far more complicated than the general math class
he had been failing. With this more positive view of himself, he
improved his work habits and took on even more challenging
assignments.
   The counselor can be a key figure in turnarounds like this one,
and Yagi says that it usually takes only two or three visits with a
student before ``the problems tend to take care of themselves.''
   The student, whose confidences are respected, may initiate the
consultations. A request for help also might come from a teacher or
parent who's too closely involved and needs a disinterested third
party to help a child put a problem into perspective.
   The mother of a girl Yagi calls ``Tina'' was concerned about the
slipping grades of her freshman daughter because she knew she was
upset about the father's disability from a recent illness. Tina's
mother asked the counselor to intervene, without letting Tina know
who suggested it. The counselor helped Tina realize that she
wouldn't lose control of her life like her father and that she could
get on with her schooling and her future.
   School counselors usually have a background in psychology or
social sciences. Yagi says they should be good communicators and
knowledgeable about resources available in the community, at school
and at home that can be brought into play for problem solving. They
also should be able to recognize when long-term attention such as
psychotherapy is appropriate and recommend it.
   At lower grade levels, one counselor will be responsible to 500
students, and in high school the ratio narrows to one for 400.
   Yagi says most problems seem to occur at transitional points _
the first grade, the first year in junior high or high school, or
when the curricula changes. ``It's usually a combination of academic
concern, peer pressure, the family situation, and other changes. The
student is changing _ personally, psychologically, and emotionally
as he or she develops and grows.''
   Warning signs for parents include when the child has poor
self-esteem, doesn't do homework or the work at school, or gets into
the ``wrong'' crowd and drifts into behavior problems.
   Yagi wrote a pamphlet, ``How to Talk to Your School Counselor,''
for Sylvan, a national group of supplemental learning centers that
has developed tests and educational services for exceptional
students or those with learning deficiencies.

   Earth Day didn't end on April 22 for many college students around
the country.
   They continue to be conscientious about conservation because
``it's on the shoulders of my generation and those to come,'' says
Scott Moats, president of Students Concerned About the Environment
(SCATE) at Buena Vista College in Storm Lake, Iowa.
   A majority of college students believe they can do something to
protect the environment, according to a recent survey by the
National Wildlife Federation, the nation's largest conservation
organization.
   The survey of 500 undergraduates found 76 percent of those polled
said they thought there was something they personally could do to
help protect the environment, such as not littering, reducing their
use of environmentally harmful products and taking part in
environmental organizations.
   ``College students are expressing a deep concern for the
environment, and the overwhelming majority are clearly willing to do
something about it,'' said Jay B. Hair, president of the National
Wildlife Federation.
   When Oneonta, N.Y., imposed strict recycling regulations on the
community two years ago, Hartwick College devised its own program
with penalties and rewards.
   Residence halls and administrative buildings were equipped with
containers for different waste products and each floor in each
residence hall was rated. Students who didn't follow the recycling
rules were fined, up to $2 a day. Rewards, for four consecutive
ratings of 10, included dinner served by Dean of Students Donald
Brown and another dean.
   
   Some of the environmental efforts around the nation's campuses:
   _ Students at Manhattanville College, Purchase, N.Y., persuaded
the school's food service provider to choose a tuna fish distributor
who doesn't use dolphin-ensnaring nets.
   A campus environmental group known as EARTH, for Education,
Action and Resources are Tomorrow's Hope, campaigned to ban the use
of plastic foam cups at an on-campus cafe.
   _ Trashcapade II at Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H., gave students the
opportunity to see how much trash they created over a five-day
period. As a result, they persuaded one of the student dining rooms
to switch from plastic to silverware.
   _ The Refuse Derived Fuel Project at Dordt College in Sioux
Center, Iowa, was recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy
because it produces an effective, efficient fuel source for the
campus.
   _ Chemistry students at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine,
Merrimac College in North Andover, Mass., and Ramapo College in
Mahwah, N.J., are reducing toxic emissions in the laboratory and
cutting air pollution by conducting ``micro-scale'' experiments.

   The business of many American schools these days is business.
Especially international business.
   ``It is increasingly urgent that all executives have an
international orientation, whether or not they leave the United
States,'' says William Voris, president of the American Graduate
School of International Management.
   ``It's only recently that international education has caught on.
The U.S. is playing catch-up with the rest of the world,'' he says.
   The international business courses have become a part of
undergraduate as well as graduate and business schools, says Rusty
Garth, vice president of the Council of Independent Colleges, a
national service organization representing the private liberal arts
colleges. He says liberal arts colleges are integrating business and
economics with traditional liberal arts courses in foreign language
and the social sciences.
   Business from another point of view is the focus of a money
management summer camp at The Breakers Hotel in Palm Beach, Fla.,
run by the securities brokerage firm of Gruntal and Co.
   For an enrollment fee of $600, 30 future Wall Street brokers aged
12 to 15 can sign up for a week to learn about how stocks are
bought, sold and delivered; credit card use; stock market ethics,
and how to read the Wall Street Journal.
   At the end of ``camp,'' students can invest $100 of their
enrollment fee and establish their own stock portfolio.

   Pencils and a notebook apparently are no longer enough for
today's students.
   Instead of the traditional stapler or folder for those bulky
theme papers, there's now a desktop plastic binding machine. The
``No Problem'' machine from General Binding Corp. binds up to 30
pages, needs no electric power source and weighs 2 pounds.
   For the student who can't succeed without a spell checker,
thesaurus and calculator, Seiko has combined them into one hand-held
electronic instrument, the MultiPower 4.
   Other Seiko electronic gadgets for students include French and
Spanish vocabulary translators and voice station translators that
help teach pronunciation.

   Keeping good teachers is simple, say two
academics who've studied the problem of faculty turnover. Pay them
more.
   Keeping good math and science teachers is simple, too. Pay them
even more than that.
   ``The lesson is very simple. If we want good teachers,
particularly in science and math, we have to raise their salaries,''
says Randall J. Olsen, professor of economics and director of Ohio
State University's Center for Human Resource Research.
   Olsen and Richard J. Murname, a Harvard professor, were
co-authors of a study of schools in three states that appeared in
The American Economic Review. They examined records of nearly 18,000
teachers in Colorado, Michigan and North Carolina who began their
careers in the 1970s.
   They found that high school chemistry and physics teachers had
the shortest schoolroom careers. In Michigan, for example, they
stayed only an average of 4.9 years, and mathemathics teachers were
next, averaging 7.4 years in the classroom before quitting.
Elementary school teachers stayed longest: 16.4 years.
   ``Science and mathematics teachers often have better job
opportunities outside the classroom, so they're more likely to move.
Elementary school teachers and those who aren't specialized don't
always have those oppiortunities,'' says Olsen.
   The researchers say that similar results were found in Colorado
and North Carolina.
   Olsen admits that the idea of paying science and math teachers
more than others who teach social studies or elementary grades may
not be popular with teachers' unions. But he says the fact is that
science and math teachers show a greater willingness to leave
teaching for better-paying jobs in industry and are the least likely
to return to the classroom later.

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) _ That women are better students than men
is more than popular wisdom, says a King's College professor who's
made a study of their habits and academic records.
   Charles I. Brooks, a psychology professor, studied 283 women and
312 men in his introductory psychology classes over a six-year
period and found that women miss fewer classes, sit closer to the
front, and make better grades.
   He found that 71 percent of the women sat in the first four rows,
compared with 44 percent of the men; 70 percent of the women had
four class cuts or fewer during the term, compared with 54 percent
of the men; and the women made better grades, on the whole, than the
men. Women in the second row averaged close to a B while men in the
same row averaged a B-, for example.
   He says he thinks students who are more interested, confident and
competent sit toward the front.

   If you've ever been assigned a college
roommate by the luck of the draw, you know the meaning of ``odd
lots.''
   Freshmen enrolling in Wilson College sign contracts with their
roommates at the beginning of the term to avoid conflicts.
   ``The roommate contracts force students to sit down and talk
about things they wouldn't discuss otherwise,'' says Margie Taylor,
spokeswoman for Wilson, a liberal arts college for women.
   Students typically discuss how they feel about smoking, visitors,
privacy, study time, and borrowing each other's clothes. Or how the
room will be arranged, and which cleaning chores will go to whom.
   Taylor says that many students have never lived with another
person outside the family before, and they often make the mistake of
being too polite about little annoyances until the problems build up.
   ``The contracts get a lot of stuff laid out ahead of time,'' she
says.
   Students also discuss how they feel about issues like sex,
alcohol, religion, and which ``Odd Couple'' character they most
resemble _ the fastidious Felix Unger or the sloppy Oscar Madison.
They end by listing issues they agree on, topics that need further
discussion, and subjects on which they will agree to disagree.
   Kathy Boyd, a communications major who graduated last year, says
the agreement saved her a lot of grief. ``My roommate was my best
friend from high school, but I was afraid that we could destroy our
friendship by living together in college. I'm a `Felix' and she's an
`Oscar.' The contracts provided a good framework to live by.'' She
and her roommate, Angela Spahr, a fine arts major, agreed not to
share clothes but to do laundry together to save money.
   ``The success of the contract really comes down to communication
skills, and we do a lot of things in both academic and student life
to build those skills,'' says Taylor.

   Until students adopt good study habits, they're not going to
learn a thing, no matter how they stare at the book, says a Chicago
learning executive.
   ``Too many parents see their child hunched over an open book and
assume he is learning,'' says Robert Baseman, president of American
Learning Corp. ``But often just the opposite is true.
   ``He doesn't have to have the radio or television on to have his
attention drift away from his reading.''
   American Learning, a division of Encyclopaedia Brittanica Inc.,
operates Brittanica Learning Centers, which offer individualized
instruction in reading and math.
   Baseman offers some study habit tips that he says can improve
grades in school and increase the level of learning by 20 to 30
percent.
   _ Establish a goal to focus on daily, either in writing it,
reading it or saying it aloud.
   _ Set aside certain hours just for studying. Avoid late hours or
study times right after meals; morning hours or right after classes
are the best for learning.
   _ Eliminate distractions and thoughts about other interests or
activities.. Study in a quiet place. Don't study if you're hungry or
thirsty.
   _ Take rest periods. Short, five-minute breaks are good if you're
working on one set task, otherwise 10- or 15-minute breaks are
refreshing. Do something physical on your break.
   _ Chart your progress.
   _ Work as quickly as reasonable, while concentrating and focusing
on what you are doing.
   _ Re-read the notes you took in class the same day you took them,
while they are still fresh in your memory.
   Developing good study habits should be a joint effort of child
and parent, Baseman says.

   A Loyola University professor suggests that students preparing to
study abroad should also consider what it will be like to come back
home.
   More students have problems with culture shock and readjustment
when they return than when they begin their study abroad, says
Michael Cornet, professor of communications who has traveled
extensively in Europe and taught for two years at Loyola's Rome
Center campus.
   ``Tourists, especially if they're only in Europe for a short
period of time, don't generally experience the culture shock that
many students go through upon their return to the United States,''
he says.
   Part of the reason, he says, is that most other people aren't
very interested in hearing the details of the trip. ``Either their
family and friends are looking for a pat `It was nice' answer, or
they want an excuse to tell about their own European adventures,''
he says.
   The returning students often don't have anyone to share their
experience with and many realize how much they have grown up in
comparison with their peers, says Cornett.
   Still, Cornett is a strong advocate of study abroad programs.
   ``It gives students a unique opportunity to examine their own
relationships, goals and interests,'' he says.

   Back to school can often mean back to minor health problems for
children, but it's nothing parents should worry about, says the
chief of pediatrics at a New York hospital.
   ``Many school children go through a period of getting sick again
after a relatively healthy summer,'' says Dr. Joseph Abularrage, of
New York Infirmary-Beekman Downtown Hospital. ``This is because
school and day care programs put children in big groups in confined
areas, unlike their comparatively open surroundings in the summer.''
   The result is often a mild cold or other easily transmitted minor
health problem, he says.
   Abularrage says a healthy diet and plenty of rest are the best
ways to prevent minor illnesses like the common cold, but parents
should be sure to have their children vaccinated.
   Parents may also have to deal with school phobia. ``If a
youngster is extremely fearful of going to school and does
everything to resist going,'' Abularrage says, ``the best way to
handle the situation is to work out the problems of separation
anxiety very slowly with the child, perhaps using the help of a
counselor or the family doctor.''
   According to Richard Oberfield, a clinical associate professor of
child psychiatry at New York University Medical Center, there are
some common signs of ``first day jitters'':
   _ unusual clinging behavior;
   _ toilet problems;
   _ stomach aches;
   _ insomnia;
   _ new fears;
   _ any behavior that seems regressive for your child, such as
whining or crying.
   He suggests that parents go over in detail ahead of time exactly
what will happen in school and assure the child that you or a family
member will be there at the end of the school day.
   Oberfield says parents should consider their own fears as well.
Children pick up on unspoken tensions and frustrations, he says, and
it is not uncommon for parents to have mixed feelings about sending
their child off to school.
   Coming to grips with your own fears should give your child the
necessary positive reinforcement, he says.

   The images of a college education usually include ivy-covered
walls, tree-lined campuses and football Saturday afternoons. But
some see more educational values in the ``real-world surroundings''
of a big city college.
   ``A city provides cultural and intellectual resources such as
museums, theaters, great libraries and galleries, while also
maintaining itself as a center of professional and economic
growth,'' says Jim Harrison, president of the Association of Urban
Universities.
   ``Broadcast centers, newspapers, corporations, hospitals, banks
and stock exchanges are all, literally, in a city's back yard.''
   Harrison says cities also can offer a large pool of executives
for part-time teaching.
   ``The city has always been the natural place to study,'' says
Harrison, who points out that ``the university began in Athens 1,400
years ago and revived in Paris 800 years later.''
   ``Eighty percent of the American population currently lives in a
city and the urban campus is where the future workforce of our
country is and will be trained,'' says Nevin Brown, assistant
director of urban affairs, National Association of State
Universities and Land Grant Colleges.
   ``The advantages of getting an education in an urban environment
are three-fold: a city has the great economic and cultural centers;
it will provide the best job opportunities in the future; and, it
has the best representation of the population as a whole,'' says
Brown.
   Michael Gold recently transferred to the urban Columbia College
in Chicago from William and Mary College in Virginia. ``I have a
better shot at connecting with a great internship and with the right
job after graduation,'' says the 24-year-old marketing major,
``because of our faculty's expertise and involvement in the
industry.''
   He says the concept of college is changing. ``The world is
speeding up and I believe there's a need to forgo some of the
traditional college frills to compete in the marketplace and achieve
career success,'' says Gold.

   Children's television viewing habits can be an early indicator of
hearing and vision problems, say doctors at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
   ``One of the first signs of vision problems is if your child
squints while looking at television,'' says Dr. Calvin Roberts,
assistant professor of ophthamology at the hospital.
   ``Since children will not necessarily be aware of their own
problems, at the first sign of squinting, parents should bring them
to a physician for a checkup,'' he says.
   Another sign of visual problems, he says, is when children
complain they can't read the print on the TV set, a possible
indication of nearsightedness.
   ``If children have astigmatism, the signs will be different,''
says Roberts. ``They will typically mistake 3s for 8s and 8s for 3s.
Sometimes they will also confuse 4s and 5s.''
   Television viewing habits may also indicate hearing problems.
   Children may increase the TV volume, show inattentiveness while
watching their favorite shows, and say ``what'' more often when
comments are made to them, according to Dr. W. Shain Schley. ``These
signs do not automatically mean a child has a hearing loss, but they
do indicate the need for a physical examination,'' he says.
   Schley is associate professor of clinical otorhinolaryngology and
director of the Eye, Nose and Throat Service at New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.

   The lessons children learn in the school cafeteria will last them
a lifetime, says a hospital nutritionist and dietitian who lurges
parents to instill good eating pattersn in their children.
   ``The main culprit is fat,'' says Carol Sherman, director of food
and nutrition services at New York's Beth Israel Medical Center.
``If we could only teach our children to stay away from high-fat
foods, or to consume them in moderation, we would be making major
progress in the fight to prevent many health problems that affect so
many adults.
   ``We need to make sure that healthy, active kids develop the
right eating patterns now,'' she says, ``as their bodies are
forming. It's never too early to learn about healthy eating.''
   She offers these tips for parents of children going back to
school:
   _ ``Everything in moderation'' should be the rule. A plate of
macaroni and cheese is OK for lunch, provided dessert is fresh
fruit, not ice cream.
   _ Serve plenty of bread in a wide variety, but stick to whole
grain breads.
   _ Learn to read labels carefully on all foods. Look for low-fat
and low-sodium content.
   _ Urge your children to drink pure fruit juice, skim or low-fat
milk _ or water _ instead of soda.
   _ Parents who pack their children's lunch should provide a
variety of foods, such as sandwiches, low-fat yogurt, fresh
vegetables and fruits.

   A trend toward more student participation in community service is
apparent on the nation's campuses, according to several recent
surveys, leading some to refer to this college population as the
``We Generation.''
   On the national level, a study of incoming freshmen attitudes
found that levels of participation in political activism and
community service for freshmen in 1989 were greater than those of
the last 1960s. The survey was sponsored by UCLA and the American
Council of Education.
   Campus Compact, a coalition of colleges and universities
committed to providing service opportunities for their students, has
grown from 12 institutions to 230 in the five years since it was
founded in 1985.
   ``In recent reports from our members,'' says Laina Warsavage,
project coordinator at Campus Compact, ``we've seen participation up
15 to 20 percent in established programs all the way up to 300
percent for newer ones.''
   At Concordia College, a survey showed, ``Young people are more
likely to feel they have a future in their community when they are
involved in service activities and feel they are valued by the
community,'' says Paul Dovre, president of the Moorhead, Minn.,
school. The survey of 2,000 ninth and 12th-graders was conducted by
the Central Minnesota Leadership Program.
   At the University of Rochester, roughly one of every six
undergraduates is involved in some kind of public service activity,
says James Case, director of Career Services and Placement at the
upstate New York school.
   Case says much of their community service goes unheralded because
it is done quietly and through established programs instead of
carrying placards and staging marches.
   ``It's time we gave credit to today's undergraduates for taking
student activism from the picket lines into the homeless shelters,
from just marching against apartheid to raising money for
scholarship funds for South African students,'' says Marsha Duncan,
vice president for student affairs at Lehigh University in
Pennsylvania.
   She says about one-fourth of the undergraduates at Lehigh
volunteer time at charitable organizations or raise money for the
March of Dimes, Easter seals, or the Red Cross.
   ``Today's students are certainly challenging the status quo,''
says the Rev. Dr. Gary Miller, chaplain at Lafayette College,
Easton, Pa., ``but instead of storming the symbols of power and
indifference, they are attempting to build a more just and caring
future, brick by brick, meal by meal, child by child.
   ``And they are doing it with their most precious resource, their
time.''

   Teaching children about the 10-foot ``danger zone'' surrounding
school buses can be more important than teaching them about reading,
writing and arithmetic. It can, in fact, be a matter of life and
death.
   With more than half the nation's school-age children being
transported to their classrooms by bus, traffic experts say they
should be taught safety procedures by parents.
   ``The most important place to learn about safety is in the
home,'' says Gary Anderson, national driver-safety manager of
Miami-based Ryder Student Transportation Services.
   Noting that the vast majority of serious accidents involving
children and school buses occur in the 10-foot-wide area surrounding
the bus, Anderson suggests parents instruct their children to remain
at least 10 feet from an approaching bus until it has stopped
completely, and then board in a single file line.
   When leaving the bus, he says, they should walk at least 10 feet
away and wait until it has left the bus stop.
   ``Because young children can see a bus, they assume the driver
can see them,'' Anderson explains. ``So they often try to retrieve
objects they've dropped near the bus, and that's a dangerous
situation.
   ``Parents should teach their children that drivers may not be
able to see them, and that the sweaters and lunch boxes they're
running after aren't as important as their safety.''
   Ryder, which transports more than 400,000 students each school
day in 15 states, conducts safety and training programs for student
passengers, including one that utilizes a miniature robotic school
bus.
   Parents are advised their children should be at the bus stop
several minutes before the bus is scheduled to arrive, wait for the
bus in a safe place away from where the bus stops and avoid
horseplay.
   Other suggestions include:
   _ Never chase a bus after it has pulled away from the bus stop,
because even with multiple large mirrors a driver may not see a
small child who is very near the body of the bus.
   _ When entering the bus, go directly to an available or assigned
seat. Remain seated and facing forward at all times while the bus is
moving.
   _ Do not extend hands, elbows or head through the windows, or
throw or pass objects to someone outside the bus.

   An increase in two-income families and in the number of working
women with children has encouraged the growth of child care centers
across the nation, figures show.
   It is estimated that by 1995, more than 80 percent of the women
between ages 22 and 44 will be working outside the home,
representing close to 15 million preschoolers with working mothers,
according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   As a result, child care has become sophisticated, with increasing
emphasis on educational programs, says John W. Quaintance, president
of the Rocking Horse Child Care Centers of America. Parents see the
licensed and regulated child care center not as a place just to
leave children for the day, he says, but as a learning environment.

   Videos and computers in today's classrooms place even more
emphasis than in the past on schoolchildren's ability to see,
according to the American Optometric Association.
   Recommending a back-to-school eye examination, the association
says children hampered by undiagnosed vision problems have to work
harder to learn and may have so much difficulty they are categorized
as learning-disabled.
   Parents are cautioned, however, that examinations that check only
to determine if a child sees clearly may miss many vision problems
that interfere with learning, such as eye coordination, eye focusing
and eye movement.
   The examination should include tests for nearsightedness,
farsightedness, astigmatism, crossed-eyes, lazy eye and color vision
deficiencies, according to the industry trade group.

   ``Don't get into the habit of calling home once a week for more
money. College is an opportunity to be responsibly independent, to
become a mature adult, to do your own laundry.''
   That's one of the bits of advice in the booklet ``How to Survive
Your Freshman Year'' by Loyola University Chicago.
   It also suggests:
   _ ``Be extra considerate of your roommate. It's like a marriage _
learn how to give and take.''
   _ ``When traveling to and around campus, develop your `sixth
sense' and be aware of what's going on around you. If someone
bothers you, don't keep it a secret. Nothing discourages a pest
faster than the loud announcement that you want to be left alone.''

   The hiring of thousands of temporary census
workers helped push the nation's unemployment rate down slightly to
5.3 percent in May, the government said.
   The civilian jobless rate fell slightly in May from April's 5.4
percent rate, the Labor Department said Friday. But analysts viewed
the report as a sign of a sluggish economy because private sector
job growth slowed to a near standstill.
   There were 164,000 new jobs created last month, according to a
separate survey of business establishments, but the number was
artificially inflated by the federal government's hiring of 145,000
temporary census workers.

to overhaul a financially ailing trust fund designed to compensate
victims of asbestos-related diseases.
   In a joint order, a federal judge and a New York state judge on
Friday said the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust was out of
money and suggested the company advance it $200 million to $300
million so it can resume payments to victims.
   The trust was formed in Manville's 1988 reorganization, six years

   Technology junkies will have to dig deep to buy
the latest in self-tuning televisions and digital audio tape
players, but the fancy features eventually will reach middle-class
buyers, industry players say.
   The world's largest consumer electronics show offers a look at
the latest innovations including ``fuzzy logic,'' a primitive kind
of artificial intelligence that can automatically fine-tune a
television set's color, brightness, contrast and sharpness. It may
be out of reach for most consumers now, but prices could come down
fast, marketers say.
   ``You can bet that fuzzy logic will become the buzzword of the
consumer eletronics industry in the 1990s,'' says Brian Klosterman,
marketing director of Sony Corp. of America.
   ``Already there are products being introduced that contain the
circuitry,'' he said at this weekend's opening of the 1990
International Summer Consumer Electronics Show. The show runs
through Tuesday and is closed to the public.
   Among the tens of thousands of audio, video, home-office and
home-automation products on display for retailers and their
representatives are Sony's two large-screen color TV's with fuzzy
logic.
   Sony's 27-inch XBR50 (retail $1,449) and the 32-inch XBR50
(retail $2,699) contain circuitry that automatically adjusts the
picture on the screen 60 times every second.
   ``More fuzzy logic devices will proliferate across our line,''
Klosterman said.
   Such ``high-end'' televisions now represent only 1.3 percent of
all color sets purchased, but the features they contain ``are always
incorporated into the ultimate products first, and gradually come
down into core-line production,'' Klosterman said.
   Sony and Technics said over the weekend that they would bring
long-awaited digital audio tape players to the U.S. market this
year. The products, which already are sold in Japan, will cost
around $1,000 at first, but not for long, a Technics spokesman
predicted.
   ``I foresee DAT eventually replacing all of the standard cassette
business,'' said Mike Aguilar, a spokesman for Technics, a Secaucus,
N.J.-based division of Matsushita Electric Corp. of America. ``I
anticipate it following the same exact course as compact disc
players.
   ``In 1983, they cost $1,000 plus. As the market grew and
production expanded, prices came down rapidly.''
   Added Aguilar, ``It is going to be the future of home taping.''
   Don Krueger of Sanyo Securities of America, the U.S. arm of a
major Japanese brokerage, said he foresees video laser disc players
as the next hot item on the consumer electronics front.
   ``Everybody will have one of those in their homes a few years
from now, just as they have a VCR in their homes now,'' he predicted.
   Video laser discs allow higher resolution than video tape and are
virtually impossible to wear out. The devices that play the discs
already have reached ``a fairly standardized, stable technology,''
Krueger said.
   ``You'll probably see the product coming down in price. Now,
they're $600 to $700. I'll bet you'll see them at around $400 to
$500 by the end of the year.''

   The Toshiba Machine Co. admits it doesn't know what
happened to a shipment of high-tech equipment that is reported to
have gone to China in 1985 in violation of bans on sales of such
machinery to Communist countries.
   Three years later, Toshiba Machine was penalized by the United
States and Japan for exporting sensitive machinery to the Soviet
Union despite an agreement by Western countries prohibiting such
shipments to Communist nations.
   Japan got a black eye for its trading practices, from which it
has still not recovered, though regulations have been tightened.
   The revelation of the China deal appears likely to raise the
question of whether other high-tech transactions slipped through in
the years of less stringent supervision.
   Tracing such deals a half-decade later can lead to dead ends, as
an Associated Press investigation showed in following up a report in
a Japanese magazine that machinery used in manufacturing computer
memory chips had gone to China via Hong Kong.
   The Hong Kong buyers have vanished now. And there is no factory,
at least now, in the building where the equipment was sent.
   Toshiba Machine's earlier problem came from exporting, via
Norway, sophisticated milling equipment in 1984. It allegedly
permitted the Soviet Union to make submarines quieter and more
difficult to detect, and Washington was furious when the story
emerged in 1987.
   In 1988, Washington barred the parent company, the electronics
giant Toshiba Corp., which holds 50 percent of Toshiba Machine, from
bidding on U.S. government contracts for one year, and Toshiba
Machine was banned from exporting anything to the United States for
three years. Japan blocked Toshiba Machine indefinitely from exports
to Communist countries.
   The possible diversion of equipment to China is coming to light
two years after the expiration of Japan's statute of limitations for
violations of export law.
   On May 19, the new monthly general-interest magazine Foresight,
published by Shinchosha, a major book and magazine publisher,
reported that Toshiba Machine's electron beam lithography system
went to China via Hong Kong in 1985. The system is able to
manufacture vital parts for the mass production of memory chips, and
at the time it was prohibited for sale to China under Japan's export
regulations.
   The AP obtained copies of documents showing the price paid,
acceptance by the Hong Kong company and a receipt by the Shanghai
Metal Research Institute dated Sept. 11, 1985, for the EB-105 RB40
system.
   Toshiba Machine officials confirmed the authenticity of the
documents with the exception of the purported receipt by the
Shanghai Metal Research Institute, which was issued to the name of a
Chinese individual as seller.
   ``All we can say is we sold the device to a Hong Kong company
under proper procedures, but we have no way of knowing what happened
to it afterwards,'' Kinji Matsumoto, a director of Toshiba Machine,
told the AP.
   Matsumoto and other company officials said two men had tried to
blackmail the company over the transaction last year. The company
refused to pay and reported the entire incident to the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry in May 1989, Matsumoto said.
   In March this year, the ministry's export division requested a
full explanation, he said.
   ``The ministry appeared satisfied with our explanation, though
its officials were not happy to hear about such an incident,'' he
said. ``We were told we have to be more careful.''
   A Ministry of International Trade and Industry official
acknowledged today that Toshiba Machine had sold the machinery to
the Hong Kong company without completing a full check of the
end-user.
   The official also conceded that his ministry should have examined
the deal more closely.
   ``But at that point, the export control was not as strictly
enforced as it is today, and we can't really blame Toshiba Machine
or export control staff of the ministry,'' said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Exporting certain high-tech equipment to Communist countries
violates Japanese export control law and the COCOM, an international
agreement of the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export
Control aimed at keeping certain sophisticated technology out of
Communist hands.
   The regulations also require strict identification of the
end-user of such equipment in countries to which export is
permitted. But in the sale to Hong Kong, the middlemen and buyer of
record have all apparently disappeared.
   Toshiba Machine officials say they sold the equipment to a Hong
Kong company called Scientific Instruments Ltd. But such a company
does not exist at the address stated in the contract. The AP
telephoned a company by the same name, located at a different
address in Hong Kong, but officials there said their company
specializes in handling medical equipment and never had such a
machine.
   A Hong Kong trading company that financed and mediated the
transaction, Tradecity Investment, also was not located at the
address stated in the contract.
   Toshiba Machine officials said their staff in Hong Kong made
inquiries but could not find the factory where Scientific
Instruments said the sensitive equipment was to be installed.
   The officials explained that Scientific Instruments had not
prepared a suitable factory and did not permit Toshiba engineers to
install the equipment, so Toshiba Machine refused to guarantee
performance of the machinery, worth 451 million yen, then equivalent
to $2 million.
   ``Last time we saw the machine was when unopened wooden boxes
were placed in a factory in Hong Kong in May 1985,'' said Takanori
Yamada, director of the corporate planning department of Toshiba
Machine. ``We never saw the machine after then.'' There was no
further contact with Scientific Instruments, he said.
   Toshiba Machine officials said they believed the machine wouldn't
be resold elsewhere because Hong Kong authorities gave the import
permission on condition that it be used only in Hong Kong.
   ``We are quite confident that we did every possible check back
then,'' Matsumoto said. ``If you tell us today that our machine is
not in Hong Kong, all I can say is it is way beyond our control.''
   He stressed that the company had tightened its export control
system in 1987, and the Hong Kong deal ``could not have happened
under the present system, but the atmosphere back then was somewhat
looser than today.''
   Japanese law also was tightened after the 1987 scandal, and while
some COCOM violations have been reported, the severe penalties on
Toshiba Machine and Toshiba are widely thought to have had a
deterring effect.
   AP attempts to trace the machinery quickly reached a dead end.
Luo Tengjiao, an official at the Shanghai Metal Research Institute
whose name appeared on the purported receipt as one of several
people accepting delivery of the machine, denied in a telephone
interview the purchase of such equipment.
   But a Shanghai daily, Wen Hui Bao, reported the institute
succeeded in manufacturing 16-bit CPUs _ computer central processing
units _ on Aug. 14, 1986, 15 months after the machinery was shipped
to Hong Kong.

   Investors who paid about $200 million
for now-worthless junk bonds through Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan are
close to reaching a settlement with the collapsed thrift's parent,
lawyers say.
   Attorneys for Lincoln head Charles H. Keating Jr., and the
Irvine-based thrift's parent, American Continental Corp. of Phoenix,
are negotiating with lawyers for bondholders who have sued to
recover their losses.
   Nearly 22,000 small investors, many of them elderly people who
lost their life savings, purchased American Continental bonds at
Lincoln's 29 Southern California branches. The bonds became
worthless after the company went bankrupt last April and federal
regulators seized the thrift.
   The bondholders filed 10 federal lawsuits, which were
consolidated into one. The suit contends bondholders were led to
believe their investments in American Continental bonds were
federally insured, like regular deposits at S&amp;Ls.
   A settlement could be finalized as early as Tuesday, said Ken
Feinberg of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays and Handler Inc., the firm
representing Keating.
   Joe Cotchett, a San Francisco lawyer representing bondholders,
said, ``For all intents and purposes, (Kaye, Scholer) has settled.''
   Any settlement, however, is subject to final approval of federal
and state judges hearing the bondholders' lawsuit.
   Lincoln's collapse is expected to be the most costly S&amp;L failure
ever, with taxpayers footing a $2 billion bailout bill.

<HEAD>Report Says Banks Might Force Trump To Sell Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's main bank creditors are likely to
force the developer to sell part of his vast empire to help cover
his roughly $2 billion in bank debts, a newspaper reported today.
   Trump hasn't missed any interest or principal payments, but
bankers are concerned many of his properties, including the
just-opened Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J., and the Trump
Shuttle airline, aren't producing enough revenue to ensure future
payments, the Wall Street Journal said in today's edition.
   Trump recently announced 450 employee layoffs at the Taj and
another 50 to 100 at the shuttle.
   But at least one banking source told the Journal that wasn't
enough. ``He will have to trim the fat: get rid of the boat, the
mansions, the helicopter,'' the banker said.
   Unidentified bankers involved in negotiations with the Trump
Organization, told the Journal the creditors might also pressure
management changes and a more conservative operating style.
   A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization did not immediately
return a telephone call seeking comment today.
   Trump, who owes another $1 billion to bondholders, is due to make
about $30 million in payments on the bonds in mid-June. The bankers,
however, want to be assured they also will be paid before the
payment is made, the Journal said.
   One solution to Trump's reported problems would be for the banks
to lend him more money and allow him to resolve his cash flow
problems on his own.
   However, the banks reportedly have the upper hand in the
negotiations, and could take the other extreme of calling in Trump's
loans, a move that could force Trump into federal bankruptcy court.
   Negotiations between Trump executives and the banks have taken
place daily in Trump Tower overlooking Central Park, the Journal
said.
   Trump's self-promotion and tendency to emblazon his name on
everything he bought had helped him convince banks that a property's
resale value would be secure because he made properties, trophies as
he has been fond of calling them, seem special.
   The properties' cash-flow potential was irrelevant, Trump argued,
because he would be able to sell them at a profit.
   In April, Trump said he was considering selling the shuttle, but
insisted that his intention was to become ``king of cash'' so he
could buy more properties if the real estate market worsened. Trump
strongly denied he was having any cash flow troubles.

struggling to extent last week's advance to record highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .24 to 2,901.21 in

   Analysts said the market still was benefiting from catch-up
buying by money managers at investing institutions who were holding
sizeable cash reserves when stocks began their spring rally.
   It is widely presumed that these managers will be anxious to show
strong commitments to stocks when they make their midyear reports to
clients and bosses at the end of this month.
   But brokers also noted some uncertainty about what new stimulus
might appear to keep propelling stocks higher.
   The calendar for this week contains very little in the way of
statistical reports on the economy that might help push interest
rates lower.

   The number of working U.S. oil and natural gas
rigs fell by 18 to total 983, snapping four consecutive weeks of
gains that had pushed the weekly tally over the 1,000 mark, Baker
Hughes Inc. reported Monday.
   A year ago, the Houston-based company's count stood at 784.
   Last week's total of 1,001 marked the first time since January
that the widely watched industry index of drilling activity topped
1,000. It also marked the first time since 1985 that the 1,000 mark
was exceeded in May.
   The count reflects the number of rotary rigs actively exploring
for oil and gas as of last Friday, not the number of producing wells.
   Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that merged with Baker
International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept track of the rig
count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among major oil-producing states, Oklahoma this week posted the
largest decline with eight, followed by Louisiana with seven.
Colorado, New Mexico and North Dakota each dropped three.
   Among states showing gains, Texas and Wyoming each were up three
while California increased by two and Ohio by one.
   Kansas, Michigan and Pennsylvania showed no change.

<HEAD>Government Reports Lower Inflation, Tighter Financial Controls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government reported Monday that
tighter financial controls and increrased farm and industrial
production had brought down inflation during fiscal 1990.
   The Finance Ministry's Economic Survey was unveiled as a prelude
to Thursday's announcement of the national budget for fiscal 1991,
which begins July 1.
   The survey said inflation declined to 5.69 percent annually,
compared to 10.4 percent in fiscal 1989.
   But private economists disputed the government's rate,
maintaining inflation was more than 15 percent. They said the low
government figure was based on on defective and incomplete

struggling to extent last week's advance to record highs.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 80.05 points last

strong commitments to stocks when they make their midyear reports to
clients and bosses at the end of this month.
   But brokers also noted some uncertainty about what new stimulus

<HEAD>Forecast For Dry Weather Drives Grains, Soybeans Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures fell in early trading
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Weather continues to be the driving force behind the market, as
the rains forecast for the past weekend were less than expected,
said Richard Feltes, an analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   The National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast calls for
warmer, drier weather in the Midwest this week. That should allow
farmers to wrap up their planting.
   The forecast is expected to pressure corn and soybean futures.
Improved harvest conditions for the winter wheat crop is putting
pressure on wheat futures.
   However, analysts say the signing late Friday of a long-term
grain agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union could
provide support to grain futures.
   In early trading, wheat was 2 cents to 3 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.26} a bushel; corn was 2{ cents
to 3 cents lower with July at $2.72} a bushel; oats were 2\ cents to
2{ cents lower with July at $1.41} a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents
to 6 cents lower with July at $5.97 a bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Hog and pork belly futures were driven higher by beliefs that the
market was oversold after steep price declines last week.
   Cattle futures were lifted by followthrough buying from Friday's
strong close.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .33 cent higher with June at 74.67
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent to .53 cent higher with
August at 84.90 cents a pound; hogs were .13 cent to .65 cent higher
with June at 66.40 cents a pound; pork bellies were .35 cent lower
to 1.20 cents higher with July at 66.25 cents a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled higher in Friday's trading.

<HEAD>These Fifty Separate Economies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regional fortunes seem to be constantly shifting,
said Janet Norwood, labor statistics commissioner, in her monthly
employment report to Congress.
   The striking stability of the national jobless rate over the past
two years, she told the Joint Economic Committee, has disguised
substantial and important regional shifts.
   During the past 12 months, for example, the nation's official
monthly jobless rate has varied from 5.3 percent only three times _
in May 1989 and in March 1990 when it read 5.2 percent and in April
1990 when 5.4 percent was recorded.
   Remarkable stability indeed. But only when you average things
out, and averages are not what people live by.
   The jobless rate in New England, for example, had been unusually
low a year or so ago, in some communities as low as 3 percent, which
statisticians believe is about as low as you can get.
   But in the past year, unemployment in that six-state New England
region has risen 2 percentage points, bringing the situation there
close to the national average.
   The Southern region also has been closing in on the national
average, but from a different direction. Rates there, which had been
among the highest in the nation, have been improving, i.e. going the
opposite way.
   It is out of such differences that national averages come into
being. They are official. They are highly publicized and analyzed.
They produce profound documents on possible policy implications.
   But to residents of those two huge areas of America, especially
jobseekers and jobholders, those official statistics mislead.
   Generally speaking, said Norwood, ``the last year has seen some
convergence of state and regional unemployment rates, with the
worse-off areas improving and the best deteriorating.''
   This is a big country, statisticians explain, and some of them
say it is about time the differences were recognized. U.S. regional
economies, they say, are as big as the economies of major
industrialized nations.
   Geographical differences aren't the only ones. Sector differences
are just as pronounced.
   Job growth in manufacturing has been weak, but until the past few
months it had been strong in services. Health-care costs and
employment have been beating an independent path upward for years.
   It is in the geographical area, however, where the vastness of
the separate American economies is most pronounced.
   While homebuilding is off in New England, where it had been
booming, it is up in Houston, where it had collapsed. While
economies of some Rocky Mountain and Southeast states are depressed,
several Midwest states are well off.
   One well-known market research firm, Sindlinger &amp; Co., claims
that it is only a specific interpretation of statistical evidence
that keeps the Commerce Department from recognizing that a national
recession might already exist.
   It's not the first time such a situation has existed, says Albert
Sindlinger, whose research suggests there are far more states in
recession than are free of it, but that the national averages
disguise their plight.
   Vivid contrasts always can be found among geographical and
sectoral areas, and that poses an enormous challenge to those who
handle the economic levers, such as Federal Reserve officials.
   The Fed mechanism, it has been demonstrated in the past few
years, can be very sensitive to national statistics; it has used
them, for example, to skirt the fine line between economic growth
and shrinkage.
   But it is not nearly as adept at handling regional or sectoral
statistics. One of its most effective tools, for instance, is the
fine tuning of interest rates nationally, but interest rates and the
availability of funds still vary greatly from area to area.
   National economics, not microeconomics, is its specialty and,
with regional economies growing and going their independent ways,
microeconomics might be the big challenge to be met.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower in trading Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade as the weather
continued to be the guiding force of the market.
   Soybean futures were sharply lower as a result of rapid soybean
planting in recent days, said Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. The amount of rain during the past
weekend was not as great as expected, allowing planting to proceed,
analysts said.
   Corn futures were also pushed lower by anticipation that planting
will be completed rapidly because of mostly dry conditions. The
National Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast, released late
Friday, calls for dry, cool weather for the rest of the week.
   Wheat futures were boosted by reports the the Peoples Republic of
China has entered the market for the grain.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 4 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.31 cents a bushel; corn was 1
cent to 2 cents lower with July at $2.74 a bushel, oats were 1\
cents to 3{ cents lower with July at $1.42{ a bushel; and soybeans

<HEAD>Ford Tells Dealers to Perform Warranty Work on all Company Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has told its dealers that it
expects them to perform warranty service on all Ford, Lincoln or
Mercury cars, even if the car was purchased elsewhere, a company
spokeswoman said Monday.
   The new policy will take effect on September 1, said Anne
Doyle-Farrell, spokeswoman for Ford's warranty division.
   Most dealers already follow this policy, but Ford's directive
will ensure they all do, Doyle-Farrell said. It's become more of an
issue in recent years as consumers began to shop more for prices
among different dealers, she said.
   But New York state Attorney General Robert Abrams, who announced
the change, said a Ford dealer's decision to provide warranty
service on cars purchased elsewhere is the exception rather than the
rule.
   Abrams said Ford agreed to change its policy following
negotiations with his office.
   ``Car buyers will be able to shop around for the best purchase
price, while still being able to use their auto warranty at a
convenient location,'' Abrams said.
   But Doyle-Farrell said Abrams was one of several different people
to bring the policy to Ford's attention and he wasn't the key to the
change.
   ``We were already interested in changing because of customer
satisfaction,'' she said.

<HEAD>Analysts: Chevron's Soviet Deal Appears on Fast Track, But Road Is
Long</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chevron Corp. appears to be on a fast track
toward developing the huge Tengiz oil field in a joint venture with
the Soviet government, but it faces a long road before the deal is
complete, analysts said Monday.
   Chevron has agreed with the Soviet Ministry of Oil and Gas
Industry to study the feasibility of developing the field, with
reserves estimated at more than 25 billion barrels _ about 2{ times
those of Alaska's Prudhoe Bay.
   The ``protocol of intentions'' agreement signed Saturday is the
first step toward an eventual joint venture to extract the oil.
   But long negotiations are expected before any joint venture
agreement is reached. Complicating the dealmaking are the tangled
Soviet bureaucracy and a history of questionable success _ even in
cases where joint venture agreements formally are reached, only 15
percent actually go into operation.
   Nevertheless, the Soviets appear highly motivated to ensure that
the Tengiz development and similar projects actually occur. The
Soviet Union is the world's biggest oil producer, but production has
fallen in recent years, and U.S. technology and capital are needed
to reverse that trend, said Warren M. Shimmerlik, a senior oil
analyst for County NatWest USA in New York.
   ``It's clear that this is a huge resource,'' Shimmerlik said.
``And this is the kind of asset that if opened up to the West could
be very significant.''
   However, he said, success is years away. Furthermore, while
Chevron may expect to make a profit, it's unlikely to get a windfall.
   ``They will negotiate a reasonable deal,'' Shimmerlik said. ``The
Soviets want this work done, and both sides will benefit from it.''
   Eugene Nowak, who heads the energy group at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., warned that the protocol is just a first step in what could
become a significant project for Chevron. He said there appeared to
be no way Chevron could lose _ the worst that could happen is
nothing, Nowak said.
   ``Based on what company officials are saying about the timetable,
Chevron appears to be on a rather fast track,'' Nowak said.
   ``The uncertainty is that this is a new venture for the Soviets,
and it's the business side that's questionable rather than the
technical side,'' Nowak said.
   Shimmerlik said he expects the Soviets ultimately to allow
several more companies into similar projects.
   ``There will be plenty of companies doing this, and it's a
question of who winds up with the best properties,'' he said.

<HEAD>Alabama Business Tax Left Intact by High Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Monday left intact an
Alabama tax attacked as ``grossly discriminatory'' against
out-of-state businesses.
   Arguments that the tax interferes unduly with interstate commerce
and violates equal protection rights were rejected by the court
without comment.
   In other action, the court:
   _Agreed to study the government's power to lift price controls on
some natural gas, a case that has tens of millions of dollars at
stake for consumers. The federal regulations were struck down by a
federal appeals court but will remain in effect until a Supreme
Court decision is announced, likely in 1991.
   _Strengthened the government's power to keep the taxes withheld
from businesses about to declare bankruptcy. Voting 9-0, the
justices ruled that the trustee of bankrupt American International
Airways is not entitled to recover $700,000 in taxes paid to the
Internal Revenue Service.
   _Ordered a lower court to reconsider a ruling that exempted the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission from collective bargaining with its
employees over salaries. The justices said the lower court should
restudy the case in light of a high court ruling May 29 that the
Army must bargain with unions over wages and fringe benefits paid to
civilian teachers at Army-run schools for the children of military
and civilian personnel.
   _Ruled that nuclear industry ``whistleblowers'' who say they were
disciplined for complaining about lax safety may sue their employers
under state personal injury laws. The court unanimously said such
lawsuits are not pre-empted by a federal law protecting
whistleblowers.
   _Agreed to decide whether passengers on international flights may
sue airlines for emotional distress allegedly suffered in
near-crashes that cause them no physical harm. The court said it
will review a ruling that Eastern Airlines may be forced to pay
passengers on a flight that landed safely in Miami after all the
plane's engines failed briefly in the air.
   In the Alabama tax case, the state Supreme Court had concluded
that the tax was valid while acknowledging that it was more onerous
for out-of-state businesses.
   ``There is no unconstitutional unequal treatment of foreign
corporations and no unconstitutional discrimination against them,''
the state court ruled last Dec. 21.
   The tax was challenged by Detroit-based General Motors Corp. and
its subsidiaries and by Reynolds Metals Co., which is based in
Richmond, Va.
   Alabama imposes a franchise tax on all business conducted in the
state. Companies based outside the state pay a tax of $3 for every
$1,000 worth of capital in the state. In-state companies pay $10 for
every $1,000 worth of all outstanding stock.
   Lawyers for GM and Reynolds Metals told the justices that the two
methods of calculating the tax result in enormously higher taxes for
out-of-state businesses.
   ``The reason ... is that while the amount of business activity
conducted and total capital employed in Alabama means everything in
determining the foreign corporation's tax liability,'' GM's appeal
said, ``business activity and total capital employed mean nothing in
determining the domestic corporation's liability.''
   For 1982 and 1983, Alabama collected $94 million in franchise
taxes from out-of-state businesses based on 28,792 tax returns and
less than $10 million from in-state businesses based on 81,698
returns.
   Adjustments to the tax law took effect in 1984 but that year
out-of-state businesses paid $49.6 million in franchise taxes and
in-state businesses paid $14.7 million.
   Reynolds Metals paid about $1.2 million in franchise taxes for
1982 and 1983, the years for which it sued for refunds.
   GM sued over the years 1983 through 1988, in which it paid $6.3
million in Alabama franchise taxes.
   The two appeals were supported by the State Tax Council of the
State Chambers of Commerce and an organization called the Tax
Executives Institute.
   ``The broad implication of the (state) court's holding is that
... discrimination against out-of-state taxpayers will be
tolerated,'' lawyers for the Chamber of Commerce's council said.
``If interstate business is to be protected from discriminatory
state taxes, the decision of the Alabama Supreme Court must be
reviewed.''

have good business ideas but lack capital, management skills and
confidence.
   The non-profit organization's goals are equality for women in
economic development, as well as helping women achieve dignity from
financial independence.
   Michaela Walsh, a former Wall Street investment banker who helped
found WWB, said banks in many countries traditionally have had
little interest in small loans. Bankers may object to having to
perform too much paperwork for too little profit, or believe that a
lack of confidence by a loan applicant indicates they're a bad risk.
   Besides guaranteeing loans, WWB trains women to run their
businesses and publishes a trade atlas with profiles of 38
countries, explanations of transactions and a glossary of trade
terms.
   Since it backed its first small loan for a bicycle repair shop in
Cali, Colombia, in 1981, WWB has handled $12 million in loans _ some
45,000 loans averaging from $500 to $1,500 _ through 46 affiliates
in 35 countries in Asia, the Americas, Europe and Africa.
   Each affiliate is run by people from the country it serves. In
the Ghanian capital of Accra, for example, the affiliate was founded
by an appeals court judge, an economist and several manufacturers.
   Part of the work is convincing local banks to make the small
loans to women who are poor and often illiterate. WWB guarantees
half the loan, the local affiliate guarantees 25 percent, and the
local bank assumes 25 percent. The borrower pays interest at the
going market rate.
   WWB's repayment rate has been 99 percent, better than for most
banks that lend in developing countries, Ms. Walsh said.
   In some cases, the affiliates act as advocates for women within
their own families. Officers will talk to a man who controls the
family's capital, said Christine Hayanga, a Nairobi lawyer and
regional officer for WWB in Africa, during a recent visit in New
York.
   ``We tell them, `We don't want you to die of a heart attack.
Share some of your responsibility with your wife.'''
   If the woman has no male relative with money to fund her business
proposal, WWB will guide her through the borrowing process.
   ``One of the major things that attracted me to this was
discovering in 1975 that women in most countries didn't even have
credit,'' Ms. Walsh said. She said banks generally did not want to
deal with women because they lacked credit history, collateral or
legal standing.
   Ms. Walsh said she learned about the credit problem in 1975 at
the United Nations International Women's Conference in Mexico City.
She also found that women worldwide accounted for 10 percent of
income but owned less than 1 percent of assets. The answer to
changing the imbalance, she thought, was entrepreneurship.
   At the same time, she was inspired by the work of Ela Bhatt in
India, a member of India's Planning Commission, who helped start a
cooperative bank for poor women in India in 1974.
   The WWB capital fund was built up by investors and support from
the governments of Canada, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and the
United States, as well as some corporations and foundations and the
United Nations.
   WWB expects to branch out soon with larger loans through a new
venture fund with limited partners making direct investments of up
to $1 million.
   WWB also is growing through new affiliates that include Akron and
Yellow Springs, Ohio; Philadelphia; and Charleston, W.Va.

   States sometimes may be forced to pay refunds
on money collected under taxes later ruled unlawful, the Supreme
Court said Monday.
   The court unanimously ruled in a Florida case that states are not
immune from being sued for refunds on unlawfully paid taxes, and
that the states can be ordered to provide some remedy.
   But by a 5-4 vote in a case from Arkansas, the justices said
businesses are not entitled to refunds on money paid under such
unlawful taxes if state officials had no way of knowing the taxes
interfered unconstitutionally with interstate commerce.
   And the court said in the Florida case that refunds are just one
option in a panoply of remedies states may provide if successfully
sued over taxes.
   The court also stopped short of allowing full retroactivity for
court decisions striking down state taxes. Instead, it said refunds
are possible if taxed activity occurred after the tax was
invalidated or after state officials should have suspected the tax
was flawed.
   The justices were told that a highway-use tax at issue in the
Arkansas case also is a controversy in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, New
Jersey and Vermont _ with potential refunds of at least $630 million
at stake.
   But for other controversies, the effect of Monday's decisions is
unclear.
   For example, the justices last year struck down a Michigan law
that taxed the pension benefits of retired federal employees but not
the pensions of retired people who had worked for the state or its
local governments.
   The court said states must tax all government pensions or none,
but its decision left unanswered whether states must refund to
pensioners the taxes already collected.
   Lawsuits seeking refunds have been filled in about half the
states, and the potential refund liability is about $2 billion.
   The Arkansas case decided Monday was one of several in which the
American Trucking Associations challenged the validity of a state
highway-use tax. The associations sued Arkansas in 1983, attacking
the state's Highway Use Equalization Tax.
   A flat tax, it resulted in a higher cost per mile for
out-of-state truckers than for in-state truckers.
   The Arkansas Supreme Court upheld the tax, but in 1987 the
nation's highest court struck down as unconstitutional two very
similar taxes imposed on truckers by Pennsylvania. The Arkansas
Legislature then repealed its state highway-use tax.
   The state Supreme Court, however, ruled that the trucking
association's members were entitled to refunds only of the $4.9
million in taxes paid into a special escrow account created in 1987.
   About $160 million in flat-use taxes had been collected by
Arkansas before the escrow account was established in the wake of
the Supreme Court decision on the Pennsylvania taxes.
   Led by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the court Monday made clear
that its 1987 ruling in the Pennsylvania case was intended ``to
apply only prospectively.''
   ``Flat highway taxation was permissible for highway use that
occurred before the date of our decision but not after,'' O'Connor
wrote in the court's main opinion.
   She was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Byron R. White and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justice Antonin Scalia joined
in the result but for differing reasons.
   Justices John Paul Stevens, William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall
and Harry A. Blackmun dissented, voting to impose greater
retroactive liability on the states.
   The court sent the case back to the Arkansas Supreme Court for
further study.
   ``We are not in a position to determine precisely the nature and
extent of the relief to which (the truckers) are entitled for their
1987-1988 HUE tax payments,'' O'Connor said. ``That determination
... lies with the state courts in the first instance.''
   In the Florida case, the state's tax structure at one time
granted preferential treatment to alcoholic beverages made and
bottled in Florida from crops grown there.
   The state Legislature, responding to a 1984 Supreme Court
decision that struck down a similar tax setup in Hawaii, amended the
law so that it granted preferences only for alcoholic beverages made
from, among other things, citrus fruits.
   The Florida Supreme Court struck down the amended tax preference
as unconstitutionally discriminatory against out-of-state
businesses. But the state court ruled that distributors who had paid
higher taxes were not entitled to any refunds.
   The justices Monday reversed the state Supreme Court ruling, and
sent the case back for a determination of what relief is required.
   ``The state is free to choose which form of relief it will
provide, so long as that relief satisfies the minimum federal
requirements,'' he added.
   The cases are McKesson Corp. vs. Division of Alcoholic Beverages
and Tobacco, 88-192, and American Trucking Association vs. Smith,
88-325.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, getting more
mileage out of last week's advance to record highs.
   Analysts said the market still was benefiting from catch-up
buying by money managers at investing institutions who were holding
sizeable cash reserves when stocks began their spring rally.
   It is widely presumed that these managers will be anxious to show
strong commitments to stocks when they make their midyear reports to
clients and bosses at the end of this month.
   Meanwhile, interest rates declined a bit after taking a sharp
drop on Friday prompted by new signs of sluggish economic growth.
   Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $2 for each
$1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.41 percent-8.45
percent range.

<HEAD>Robert Campeau, Bank Reach Agreement on Payment Extension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Bank of Canada said Monday it has
extended the deadline by which Robert Campeau must pay 40 million
Canadian dollars to regain the Campeau Corp. stock that the bank
seized from him last January.
   The bank announced that Campeau received the reprieve after
missing a Thursday midnight deadline.
   Bank spokesman Carole Gagne would not say how long the extension
was for but published reports put it at 30 days. In Monday's
trading, the U.S. dollar was trading at about 1.175 Canadian
dollars, making the value of the payment Campeau faces worth about
$34 million (U.S.).
   The bank had seized the securities after Campeau missed payments
on about 150 million Canadian dollars in loans earlier this year.
   But Campeau, who has lost much of his personal fortune with the
plunge in the company's stock in the past year, surprised financial
circles with a deal to buy the shares back. Transfer of the
securities would return control of the Toronto-based company to
Campeau.
   Under the deal, Campeau, who is still chairman of the company he
founded, agreed to pay 80 million Canadian dollars in two equal
installments. The first payment was due last Thursday in exchange
for the securities.
   The deal, which had been disclosed in filings with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, said the second payment was due
at the end of 1991.
   Under the original agreement, if Campeau fails to make the
payments the bank can seize the securities again. The agreement also
included a provision whereby the two sides could mutually postpone
the deadline, which they have now decided to do.
   Campeau owns two extensive U.S. retailing companies operating
under bankruptcy court protection. The restructuring of the Canadian
parent has no direct bearing on the bankruptcy reorganization of
Cincinnati-based Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores
Inc.

   Students won't roam the campus of the
Gorbachev Maxwell Institute of Technology, and its initial proposed
endowment of $100 million is paltry compared with those of other
world-class research facilities.
   But supporters say the institute would bring together the world's
top scientists to solve problems ``that matter to humanity.''
   ``Everybody in the world would love to have an institute of this
kind,'' Robert H. Smith, chairman of the institute's board, said
Monday.
   Plans for the institute, which is to focus on research into
communications and the environment, were announced Sunday during
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to the Twin Cities.
British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell has pledged $50 million if
state officials raise a matching amount.
   Smith conceded that the institute's mission is vague, but said
it's premature to set specific goals until funds are raised and
scientists are recruited.
   ``You can't do the last part first,'' said Smith, who is also
vice chairman of Maxwell Communications North America, the nation's
second-largest printer.
   Minnesota Gov. Rudy Perpich, who at times has been criticized for
dabbling in foreign affairs, is credited with lobbying Maxwell to
fund the institute. Gorbachev's visit to Minnesota at Perpich's
invitation provided the momentum for the project, and the Soviet
president gave his blessing to the institute that will bear his name.
   Spokesman Robert Finn of California Institute of Technology said
the project might be difficult to get off the ground, but predicted
it would have a fair chance of success.
   ```Gorby Tech' is going to have certain advantages,'' Finn said.
``Scientists would be free of teaching responsibilities, and that's
attractive to many people. There may be freedom from one of the
things that scientists hate most _ grant applications.''
   Finn said the Twin Cities institute would likely have more
success if it focused on specific goals, such as the environment and
communications.
   ``Environmental research is not one of the most heavily funded
areas of science these days,'' he said. ``Scientists in those
specific fields might be interested.''
   Smith said he's confident the funds can be raised and the
institute opened. He predicted the initial $100 million would be
raised by the end of 1991, but said there is no firm date projected
for the facility to open.
   Maxwell wouldn't have pledged $50 million for the project if he
didn't believe it could succeed, Smith said.
   ``He is a guy who believes that communications and the ability to
transcend ethnic and nationalistic boundaries is an extremely
important idea for getting along in the world to come,'' Smith said.

   The dollar declined Monday against most major
currencies except the British pound and Japanese yen in domestic
trading after a mixed performance overseas.
   Trading volume was light because most European markets were
closed for a holiday.
   Gold prices posted minor to moderate losses.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's comments implying that U.S.
interest rates could be heading lower knocked the dollar down as
trading ended in New York. The result was that the dollar closed
near its lowest levels of the session.
   Brady, speaking at the International Monetary Conference luncheon
in San Francisco, expressed optimism that a budget agreement between
Congress and the Bush adminstration could be reached that would
reduce rates.
   Currency dealers said the impact of Brady's remarks was
exaggerated because of the low liquidy in the market. Markets in
continental Europe were closed for the Whit Monday holiday; only
London's markets were open in Europe.
   ``For the most part it was a very quiet, dull day with the dollar
stuck in a narrow range,'' said Bob Morrissey, senior currency
trader at the Bank of Boston's office in New York.
   Attention generally was focused on trading between the dollar and
West German mark. Speculation about possible intervention by West
Germany's central bank to prop up the mark restrained the dollar.
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen. But dealers in New York
and London said the gains reflected momentum from earlier Asian
buying rather than a fundamental improvement in sentiment toward the
U.S. currency.
   The dollar's trading day began in Tokyo with a gain of 0.25
Japanese yen to a closing level of 152.42 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at 152.65 yen, which was the same level as late in New
York. On Friday in New York, the dollar traded late at 151.85 yen.
   Weakness in the British pound favored the dollar. A pound fetched
$1.6745 late in London, down from $1.6840 late Friday. Sterling lost
strength in New York with a pound falling to $1.6770 from Friday's
$1.6810.
   Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with Friday's
late quotes, included: 1.6905 West German marks, down from 1.6985;
1.4340 Swiss Francs, down from 1.4375; 5.696 French francs, down
from 5.7295; 1,243.00 Italian lire, down from 1,250.375; and 1.17475
Canadian dollars, up from 1.17465.
   Other late dollar rates in London, compared with late Friday's
levels were: 1.6940 West German marks, unchanged; 1.4390 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4358; 5.7080 French francs, down from 5.7180;
1,245.50 Italian lire, down from 1,247.25; 1.9068 Dutch guilders,
down from 1.9073; and 1.1763 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1728.
   Gold prices declined.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, a troy ounce of gold for
June delivery edged down 60 cents to close at $358.60. Republic
National Bank quoted a late bid of $357.40 a troy ounce for gold
bullion, $1.35 lower than Friday.
   In London, gold fell to a late bid price of $356.05 a troy ounce
from $361.25 late Friday. Zurich markets were closed for Whit Monday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 68 cents to close at a bid of
$360.68 an ounce.
   Silver prices finished mixed. Silver for June delivery rose to
$5.049 a troy ounce on New York's Comex from $5.046 Friday. In
London, silver fell to a late bid price of $5.03 a troy ounce from
$5.05 late Friday.

   President Bush is expected to postpone new oil
drilling off the California and Florida coasts, for up to 12 years
in some areas, so additional environmental-impact studies can be
done, administration officials said Monday.
   The officials said the president appeared ready to endorse a
course that would ban new exploration off Florida until 2002, off
Northern California until 1997 and off Southern California until at
least 1992.
   Although the sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
cautioned that Bush still could change course and allow some
leasing, one official closely involved with the decision said, ``I
would be surprised'' if he did not go forward with the overall delay.
   An election-year decision to delay the leasing would play well
among Republicans in California and Florida. Many have urged the
delay, voicing concerns about a negative reaction from voters if
Bush opened any areas to new drilling before the November balloting.
   Environmentalists have argued that the threat to the environment
off both states has been shown and that new drilling should be
banned altogether.
   ``We will be very disappointed if all we're offered (by Bush) is
a delay,'' said Lisa Speer, an attorney for the Natural Resources
Defense Council. ``The public has moved far beyond where delays are
going to satisfy people. It's time to move to protect some of these
areas permanently.''
   The long-pending presidential decision was anticipated in the
next few days.
   While Bush still had a range of options before him, the consensus
among officials who have worked on the decision is that Bush will
approve a delay in leasing for all three areas, according to the
administration sources.
   Postponing new drilling would conform to conclusions of a task
force Bush appointed last year to study the problem.
   Oil activity would be banned in all the areas until at least
1992, when the Interior Department is to produce its next five-year
plan for oil leasing around the country, if Bush keeps to the
decision his aides expect. The five-year plan includes a broad
outline of what areas will be considered for leasing and how the
department will deal with leases for those five years.
   The president still had before him a variety of options ranging
from opening the coasts to new offshore oil activity to imposing a
moratorium.
   The options that the president has expressed most interest in
involve postponing any new drilling, with the possibility of
differing delay times, the officials said.
   They cautioned, however, that Bush, a former Texas oil executive,
could switch courses at the last minute and back an option that
would permit some new leasing activity.
   Bush named a task force last year, headed by Interior Secretary
Manuel Lujan, to work with the National Academy of Sciences in
studying the environmental impact of opening the three areas to oil
leasing _ off northern, southern California and the Florida keys.
   The task force, in its report to Bush in January, cited a need
for further study on the environmental and socioeconomic
ramifications of new lease sales, sources have said.
   The broadest set of options initially placed before the president
by his staff ranged from allowing immediate drilling in the study
areas to permanently barring oil companies from the regions.
   Environmentalists have long opposed oil drilling in the three
regions _ a 6.7-million acre section of ocean off Southern
California, 1.2 million acres
   off Northern California, and 13 million acres in the Gulf of
Mexico near the Florida Everglades.
   The environmentalists' concerns about damage to beaches and
endangering of wildlife from leaks intensified after the Exxon
Valdez tanker spill off Alaska a year ago.
   The Florida congressional delegation unanimously asked Bush to
bar new drilling off their state. Republican Gov. Bob Martinez, who
faces uncertain re-election prospects this year, is a strong
moratorium proponent.
   In California, the political positions are a bit more mixed, but
even conservative Republicans now call for protection of
environmentally sensitive areas from oil drilling.
   Republican Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who faces only token
opposition in the GOP primary Tuesday but a bruising campaign for
governor of California, is a strong moratorium backer who bucked the
Reagan administration's efforts to open new leasing areas off the
state's coast.
   The policy initiated by then-President Reagan's interior
secretary, James Watt, opened to drilling the entire 1.4
billion-acre Outer Continental Shelf. But leasing has been blocked
over the years by congressionally imposed moratoriums.
   In Florida, the government sold 73 leases in the affected area in
the early 1980s for $108 million. The cost of buying the leases back
could be closer to $200 million, according to some Interior
Department officials.
   Southern California is the only region of the country other than
the Gulf of Mexico where offshore oil development is underway; 22
oil platforms are operating. The current five-year lease program had
anticipated additional lease sales last September, but those sales
were put off pending the president's decision.
   The northern California leases, some 90 miles north of San
Francisco and off Eureka, had been scheduled for sale early last
year, but the sale was postponed.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade as the weather forecast continued to be

   On other markets, precious metals were mixed, energy futures were

planting in recent days, said Steve Freed, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. The amount of rain during the past
weekend was not as great as expected, allowing planting to proceed,
analysts said.
   Competition in the export market from South America also weighed
on the soybean market, with the dock strike in Brazil not expected
to last long enough to cause soybean business to shift to the United
States, Freed said.
   Corn futures were pushed lower by anticipation that planting will
be completed rapidly because of mostly dry conditions. The National
Weather Service's six- to 10-day forecast, released late Friday,
calls for dry, cool weather for the rest of the week.
   Wheat futures were boosted by reports that the Peoples Republic
of China has entered the market for the grain.
   Wheat settled 1\ cent to 5 cents higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $3.31 cents a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2\
cents lower with July at $2.73} a bushel, oats were 1 cents to 2
cents lower with July at $1.43 a bushel; and soybeans were 8 cents
to 10\ cents lower with July at $5.92} a bushel.
   Precious metals were mixed in trading on the New York Commodity
Exchange.
   The price of gold slipped, extending last Friday's late decline.
   Craig Sloane, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.,
said there were no news developments guiding the market, only
continued concern about the U.S. economy.
   Sloane said that overall, commodity prices are weak, which he
attributes to the good showing being made by the stock market, where
the Dow Jones industrial average reached another record high on
Monday. The strong stock market is also weighing on precious metals
prices.
   Other analysts said gold prices are retreating because of
continued concern over the cash flow problems of the Soviet Union,
which raise the possibility that the Soviets will sell gold to pay
for imports.
   Silver finished higher on buying by professional traders.
   Gold was 60 cents to $1.80 lower with June at $358.60 a troy
ounce; silver was .20 cent to .30 cent higher with July at $5.082 a
troy ounce.
   Energy futures settled lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange
in quiet trading.
   Crude oil was trading up about 25 cents a barrel before falling
back in the afternoon. Robert Baker, an analyst with Prudential
Bache Securities Inc. in New York, said there was an absence of news
to influence the market.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 17 cents to 43 cents lower
with July at $17.14 a barrel; heating oil was 65 cents to 1.14 cents
lower with July at 47.59 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.20
cents to 1.82 cents lower with July at 59.58 cents a gallon.
   Livestock and pork futures were higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Hog futures prices rose on professional and commercial buying
prompted by expectations of higher cash prices this week.
   Expectations of a light slaughter also was a boost to hog prices.
After the close of trading, the U.S. Agriculture Department released
a slaughter estimate of 252,000 heads.
   Pork bellies were higher due to belief that last week's drop in
prices was overdone.
   Cattle prices were higher, spurred by active boxed beef sales as
retailers restocked after brisk Memorial Day business.
   Live cattle were .10 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June at
74.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .65 cent higher
with August at 85.02 cents a pound; hogs were .08 cent lower to .50
cent higher with June at 66.25 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .57 cent lower to .25 cent higher with July at 65.30 cents a
pound.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Fall On Supply Concerns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices skidded lower Monday as
traders grew more pessimistic about the oversupply of crude on world
markets.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 36 cents to $17.14 a 42-gallon barrel
on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with other contract months also
dropping.
   Madison Galbraith, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures,
summed up the market's problems: ``There's too much crude.''
   Energy futures prices slumped last week because of supply
concerns, and Monday's decline was a continuation of that downturn,
Galbraith said.
   ``It's anybody's guess where it will end,'' he said.
   Among refined products traded on the mercantile exchange,
wholesale gasoline for delivery in July plunged 1.20 cents to 59.58
cents a gallon, with subsequent months also falling.
   And the July contract for home heating oil tumbled 1.14 cents to
47.59 cents a gallon. Later months also declined.
   Prices have been falling since the beginning of the year as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been unable to
stop some of its members from exceeding their production quotas.
   At this point, even if OPEC members do cut back their output,
bearish traders believe this will only slow, and not reduce the
oversupply of crude, Galbraith said.
   Natural gas prices were little changed Monday. The July contract
closed at $1.582 per $1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.585 on Friday.

<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Ford Motor Co. executives were killed
in a light-airplane crash this weekend, the automaker said Monday.
   The four were killed when the airplane flown by one of them
crashed about noon Sunday shortly after takeoff from Otsego County
Airport near Gaylord on Michigan's Lower Peninsula. The four were
the only people aboard the airplane headed to Oakland Pontiac
Airport.
   They were identified as Richard G. Bentley, 51, of Birmingham,
executive vice president for finance, and Robert L. Decker, 50, of
Livonia, vice president for employee relations, both with Ford Motor
Credit; James A. Hewitt, 56, of Birmingham, employee relations
manager for truck operations, and Ben Muns, 62, of Bloomfield Hills,
director of the compensation planning office at Ford Motor World
Headquarters.
   ``The employees who lost their lives in this tragedy were
outstanding men and significant contributors to the company,'' said
Ford President Philip Benton.
   A National Transportation Safety Board investigator arrived
Sunday in Gaylord to determine a cause of the crash.
   State Transportation Department records showed the plane was
registered May 17 to Tradewinds Aviation Inc. in Pontiac. Company
President Rick Nini said Bentley was one of several people who owned
the plane under a partnership. Bentley was the pilot when the plane
left Friday for Gaylord.
   ``It was just him and three buddies going up to Gaylord for a
golfing weekend,'' Nini said Monday. ``It's tragic.''
   Nini said there were no known mechanical problems with the plane,
a single-engine, Beechcraft A-36 Bonanza.
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mort Edelstein in
Chicago said the plane was making a left turn when it stalled.
Edelstein said winds, which had been gusting up to 40 mph, could
have been a factor in the crash.

   The head of NBC News conceded to affiliates
Monday ``we screwed up'' the ``Today Show'' with changes that led to
Jane Pauley's leaving in December.
   However, Michael Gartner told the annual NBC affiliates'
convention that key changes have been made, including a new
executive producer for the show, Tom Capra.
   ``Now, with the dust settled, he'll make it, we'll make it,
another winner,'' he said. The show has been second in ratings to
ABC's ``Good Morning America'' for 21 weeks.
   The affection of affiliate executives for Pauley _ succeeded on
``Today'' by Deborah Norville _ was amply illustrated when they gave
her a standing ovation as she appeared on stage at the National
Theater where Gartner spoke.
   ``I have never been happier in my work,'' said Pauley, who is
preparing a series of prime-time specials for NBC and is substitute
evening news anchor when Tom Brokaw is away.
   Gartner didn't specify the mistakes that caused the slump.
   But seeking to make amends to executives of NBC's 208 affiliated
stations, Gartner also tried to show progress on two other news
fronts.
   He said a new 24-hour news service, the NBC News Channel, will
start serving affiliates in January, providing international,
national and regional news for use in their own newscasts.
   The service won't transmit stories on a non-stop basis as does
Cable News Network. Nor will it have news anchors, as some industry
observers thought it would.
   It is intended to help NBC stations compete with CNN's newscasts,
and to ward off further encroachments by CNN on NBC stations.
   CNN says it has 216 broadcast affiliates, of which 52 are NBC
affiliates.
   Gartner also introduced the new executive producer of the
third-in-ratings ``NBC Nightly News,'' Steve Friedman, calling him a
``show doctor'' who will ``make `Nightly' sparkle.''
   Friedman is a former executive producer of ``Today'' credited
with making that show first in ratings before leaving it in 1987 to
create what turned out to be a costly, syndicated flop, ``USA Today
on TV.''
   ``Welcome to NBC News' version of `Back to the Future,'''
Friedman joked, alluding to his return and the re-hiring of Joe
Garagiola as a co-host on ``Today'' with Norville and Bryant Gumbel.
Garagiola was a ``Today'' co-host from 1969 to 1973.
   Garagiola, who is not scheduled to start on ``Today'' until June
11, appeared on stage with Gumbel, Norville, weatherman Willard
Scott, and other new additions _ anchor Faith Daniels and
correspondent Katherine Couric.
   Capra, appearing separately, said Garagiola ``will be the glue
that holds the show together.''
   In speaking of Capra's hiring last year, Gartner said: ``We know
we screwed up the `Today Show.' ... He knows what the show needs and
he knows how to provide it.''
   The usually-brash Friedman was cautious and didn't promise a fast
ratings rise for ``Nightly News.''
   However, he said there would be changes to make the newscast more
of a ratings contender. He didn't outline the changes, citing
competitive reasons.
   Newscasts ``no longer just index the day's events,'' he told an
audience of 1,100.
   ``We can't come on and say, `These are the top stories.' People
have heard them already.'''
   ``We are going to do a show of interest, not the show of
record,'' he added. ``We are going to be active, not reactive.''
   The opening of NBC's three-day session began the same day as Fox
Broadcasting's convention in Los Angeles.
   Atlhough some NBC station executives chatted among themselves
about next fall's Thursday night face-off between NBC's powerhouse
``The Cosby Show'' and Fox's cartoon hit, ``The Simpsons,'' NBC
president Robert C. Wright warned them a battle was beginning on
several fronts.
   NBC, first in prime time for five seasons, is ready for next
fall, he said. ``We've got victories in the future. But they'll be
smaller victories than the ones we enjoyed in the past.''
   Cable has become strong, ``Fox is probably even stronger than we
had anticipated'' and is rapidly moving toward a seven-night
schedule, and ABC and CBS have been rejuvenated, he said.
   To stay a financially strong network, ``we must gain an equal
footing with our unregulated competitors,'' he said. Cable was
de-regulated by Congress in 1984 but is facing some possible
re-regulation.

   Greyhound Lines Inc. filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection Monday, saying it was worried creditors would
try to seize buses and terminals as the company struggled into the
fourth month of a drivers' strike.
   Officials said the filing would not affect service at the only
nationwide bus company.
   ``We have taken this action to enable Greyhound lines to continue
operation of its of its total system,'' said J. Michael Doyle,
senior vice president and chief financial officer.
   The petition was filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the
Southern District of Texas in Brownsville.
   The filing under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code allows
the company to continue operating under court supervision while it
tries to reorganize its finances and pay off creditors.
   Union officials were not immediately available to comment on the
bankruptcy filing.
   Greyhound has been struggling since bus drivers walked out March
2. The company has been operating a reduced schedule, but the sliced
revenue and increased expenses of fighting the strike have siphoned
off cash needed to operate.
   The company lost $56 million in the first quarter. It has missed
more than $16 million in principal, interest and lease payments
since the end of April, putting it in default on numerous agreements
with creditors.
   ``In the past few days, there has been a lot of pressure by
creditors'' who own buses and terminals that the company leases,
said President Frank Schmieder.
   ``We tried to stay out (of bankruptcy) as long as possible,''
Schmieder said.
   ``There will be no interruption of service,'' Doyle said, adding
that the company had asked the bankruptcy court to honor tickets
already purchased.
   ``For the passengers, (bankruptcy) ought to be pretty
transparent,'' Schmieder said. ``The network is up in full and we're
going to need all the employees that we currently have.''
   Two weeks ago, the company proposed repurchasing $225 million of
its junk bond debt at a steep discount, provided it could find
enough financing to pay about $90 million for the bonds and leave
the company with about $35 million in operating capital.
   ``We have asked creditors for patience so that we could devote
all available resources to running maximum service during the peak
summer travel season,'' Doyle said.
   ``While most have been cooperative, we were faced with the threat
of a `run on assets' that could have crippled our ability to
operate,'' he said.
   ``We are highly confident we will be successful in restructuring
our debt,'' Doyle added.
   Schmieder said negotiations are continuing on financing the debt
restructuring, but ``it will take longer now because the courts will
have to approve any financial restructuring.''
   The company did not estimate when it hoped to emerge from court
supervision.
   The filing covers Greyhound and five affiliates including Eagle
Bus Manufacturing Co., which is based in Brownsville. The other
affiliates are GLI Bus Operations Holding Co., BusLease Inc.,
Trailways Commuter Transit Inc. and GLI Food Services Inc.
   Greyhound's parent, GLI Holding Co., wasn't included in the
filing.
   Most of Greyhound's 6,300 drivers walked out over wages and job
security. The company has been operating a reduced schedule with
nearly 3,000 newly hired drivers.
   After attempts to reopen negotiations collapsed early last month,
Chairman Fred G. Currey said May 7 the strike had become
``irrelevant'' because the carrier had enough drivers to operate.
   Just two weeks later, however, the company acknowledged severe
financial difficulties and said the proposed repurchase of junk
bonds was necessary to avert bankruptcy.
   The company's total debt stood at $384 million at the end of
March. The debt is the legacy of a leveraged buyout three years ago
led by Currey that took the company private.
   Currey and other investors paid $270 million for the bus
operations of Greyhound Corp., since renamed Greyhound Dial Corp. A
few months later they paid an additional $80 million for
Dallas-based Trailways Lines Inc., then the nation's largest
operator of Trailways buses.
   Greyhound's future also was clouded recently by a finding by the
National Labor Relations Board that Greyhound engaged in unfair
labor practices by implementing its contract proposal immediately
after the strike began.
   An administrative law judge has scheduled hearings on the matter
in Milwaukee on Sept. 17. The procedure could result in the bus
company being forced to pay about $10 million a month in back wages.
Greyhound has said it is confident it will win once the case gets in
court.

   Students won't roam the campus of the
Gorbachev Maxwell Institute of Technology, and its initial proposed
endowment of $100 million is paltry compared with world-class
research centers.
   But supporters say the institute would bring together the world's
top scientists to solve problems ``that matter to humanity.''
   ``Everybody in the world would love to have an institute of this
kind,'' Robert H. Smith, chairman of the institute's board, said
Monday.
   Plans for the institute, which is to focus on research into
communications and the environment, were announced Sunday during
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to the Twin Cities.
British publisher Robert Maxwell has pledged $50 million if state
officials raise a matching amount.
   Gov. Rudy Perpich said Monday an initial $1 million donation from
Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland Co., boosted the
state's effort to match Maxwell's pledge.
   Smith said it's premature to set specific goals for the institute.
   ``You can't do the last part first,'' said Smith, vice chairman
of St. Paul based-Maxwell Communications North America, the nation's
second-largest printer. ``Now that there's actually life and there's
blood flowing and there's excitement, it's on to that task.''
   Perpich, who at times has been criticized for dabbling in foreign
affairs, is credited with lobbying Maxwell to fund the institute.
Gorbachev's visit to Minnesota at Perpich's invitation provided the
momentum for the project.
   Perpich on Sunday compared the project with California Institute
of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   But officials of those schools said Monday they see big
differences between their institutions and the Gorbachev Maxwell
institute, which would depend entirely on private funding and would
not award degrees.
   ``That would be a sharp departure from MIT, where teaching and
research are both very important,'' said Robert C. DiIorio,
associate director of the MIT news office. ``I think it would be
apples and oranges.''
   MIT scientists conducted research projects valued at $285.7
million in fiscal 1989, DiIorio said, and the school's endowment as
of June 30, 1989, was $1.25 billion.
   Caltech spokesman Robert Finn said the project might be difficult
to get off the ground, but predicted it had a fair chance of success.
   `` `Gorby Tech' is going to have certain advantages. Scientists
would be free of teaching responsibilities, and that's attractive to
many people. There may be freedom from one of the things that
scientists hate most _ grant applications,'' he said.
   Finn said Caltech's 1989 budget for education and general
expenditures was nearly $181 million, not including a billion-dollar
budget for a separate Jet Propulsion Laboratory funded primarily by
NASA and the Department of Defense.
   Finn said the Twin Cities institute would likely have more
success if it focused on specific goals, and the environment and
communications might be good choices.
   ``Environmental research is not one of the most heavily funded
areas of science these days,'' he said. ``Scientists in those
specific fields might be interested.''
   Smith said the $100 million would be raised by the end of 1991,
but said there is no date projected to open the institute.

<HEAD>Citicorp To Cut Municipal Bond Underwriting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp said it will stop underwriting,
distribution and trading of municipal securities, cutting 35 jobs in
another sign of Wall Street's slowdown.
   Glen Sergeon, managing director of Citicorp Securities Markets
Inc., said Monday the municipal finance division would cut about
half of its 70 jobs but is trying to find jobs for displaced workers
in other areas of the big bank holding company.
   ``We are having an honest react to current market conditions,''
he said. ``The marketplace has a lot of excess capacity in it that
isn't going away quickly.''
   Sergeon said Citicorp would concentrate on creating and offering
derivative products in municipal finance rather than underwriting.
Such products typically allow issuers to hedge interest rate and
other risks.
   Citicorp is the latest of major underwriters to scale back its
business in the municipal bond field because of a slowdown in
issuing tax-exempt securities stemming mainly from the Tax Reform
Act of 1986.
   Sergeon said the market peaked in 1986 when $320 billion in
municipal bonds were issued and underwriters received $11 a bond. In
1989, the total number of issues was $118 billion and underwriters
made $7 a bond.
   ``The amount of human and capital capacity dedicated to this
marketplace has not adjusted commensurate to the size of the
market,'' he said
   Citicorp said the cuts will not affect other services to
municipal bond issuers, such as investment agreements, shorter-term
distribution agreements and various credit services.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Approves Griffin Debt Plan Statement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bankruptcy judge has approved a Resorts
International Inc. statement outlining how the company plans to shed
much of its $927 million debt, the casino company announced.
   The approval is a major step toward confirmation of Resort's
proposed financial restructuring plan, Christopher Whitney, the
company's executive vice president, said in a statement Monday.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Rosemary Gambardella, who heard
arguments on the statement last week, requested minor language
changes in approving it, Whitney said.
   The judge ordered Resorts to submit the revised statement by June
11 and Whitney said the company expects to mail the disclosure
statement to Resorts creditors in mid-June.
   Last month, committees representing two groups of Resorts
bondholders approved Resorts proposed restructuring. The plan still
must win approval of two-thirds of the bondholders in a formal vote,
Gambardella, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the
government of the Bahamas.
   In addition to Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic
City, Resorts owns casino property in the Bahamas.
   Resorts' plan, filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code, would give bondholders 78 percent of the company, dropping
Griffin's stake from 100 percent to 22 percent. In exchange, the
bondholders will swap their $927 million in bonds for a reduced
amount of debt.
   The plan also sets aside a legal kitty of $5 million to pursue a
possible ``fraudulent conveyance'' action against Donald Trump, who
swapped Resorts to Griffin for the newly opened Taj Mahal Casino
Resort next door on the Boardwalk.
