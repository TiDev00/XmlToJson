<HEAD>Mayor and City Council Members Indicted on Extortion Charges</HEAD>

   The mayor of Sweetwater three city council members
were indicted Thursday by a federal grand jury on extortion
charges, the U.S. Attorney announced.
   Mayor Irain Gonzalez and council members Carmen Menendez, Hugo
Alvarez and Antonio Duran are accused of using their public
positions to extort money from a local businessman who wanted them
to reverse a land-use restriction, said U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen.
   ``Public corruption by elected officials strikes at the heart of
democracy,'' Lehtinen said.
   ``Five of seven members of Sweetwater's city council were
involved in this extortion attempt,'' he alleged. He apparently
counted Gonzalez, who is a council member as well as mayor, and one
of two other council members not included in the indictment.
   Gonzalez, Menendez, Alvarez and Duran each face a maximum of 40
years in prison and a fine of $500,000, Lehtinen said.
   Lehtinen said he notified Gov. Bob Martinez of the indictment
Thursday and that the governor's office would decide who will run
the city of Sweetwater.
   The governor's press secretary, Jon Peck, said Martinez has yet
to make a decision on the matter. He said the governor was awaiting
written confirmation of the indictment.
   ``We're aware of the situation and our attorneys are still
looking at it,'' Peck said.
   The other two city councilmen, Manuel Avila and Lucio Cobian,
have cooperated with Lehtinen's office and have agreed to testify
on behalf of the government, he said.
   Cobian has agreed to plead guilty to one extortion charge and
Avila is an ``unindicted co-conspirator,'' Lehtinen said.
   The indictment stems from a request made by Maurice Barakat in
June 1989 asking the council to lift a land-use restriction.
Barakat, who owns the Holiday Plaza Shopping Center, had sold part
of the land, which left him with less than the five acres necessary
for commercial zoning.
   Barakat asked the city council to remove the restriction so he
could sell the additional commercial units more easily, the
indictment said. The defendants allegedly told Barakat he would
have to pay them $10,000 in exchange for a favorable council vote
on his request.
   Instead, Barakat went to the FBI.
   The councilmen voted to continue delaying action on Barakat's
request until he paid the money, the indictment alleged. Barakat
paid Menendez $5,000 with FBI agents watching, but then was asked
to pay $6,000 more, according to the indictment.
   The city officials are expected to surrender Friday through
their attorneys and make their first appearance in federal court
Friday afternoon, Lehtinen said.
   Sweetwater, known in the 1960s as a rural outpost in western
Dade County, has recently become a haven for political exiles from
Central America.

<HEAD>Federal Government Sues Nevada Over Nuclear Dump Plans</HEAD>

   The federal filed suit Thursday against the
state of Nevada, claiming the state is acting illegally in refusing
to issue environmental permits for work on the proposed nuclear
dump at Yucca Mountain.
   The U.S. District Court suit also asks that legislative
resolutions and a state law banning the dump be declared invalid
because they are pre-empted by a congressional directive to conduct
scientific studies of the site.
   State officials have adamantly opposed any plans for work at
Yucca Mountain, which Congress picked in late 1987 as the nation's
only site to be studied for a high-level radioactive waste dump. It
would be used to store spent fuel rods from commercial nuclear
reactors.
   The Department of Energy said in November it planned to file the
suit. The action asks a judge to order state officials to issue the
necessary permits within 30 days and prohibit the state from
``unlawfully interfering'' with the DOE's activities at the site.
   ``We have tried to work with the state over the years, but
unfortunately they have refused to cooperate in that area,'' said
Carl Gertz, the nuclear dump project director. ``We were forced
into filing this suit so we can move ahead with scientific
studies.''
   The Department of Justice suit was seen as unusual by attorneys,
who said it was rare that the federal government would sue a state
for trying to block federal law.
   ``Usually it's the other way around,'' said DOE attorney Dave
Gassman. ``But the federal program must prevail. It is a very basic
issue.''
   In December the state attorney general's office filed suit
claiming the state has the right to bar the DOE from following
Congress's mandate because the Nevada Legislature has passed
resolutions ``disapproving'' the Yucca Mountain site.
   The state contends it has the right under the federal
legislation to veto the site, and is also bound by a law passed by
the 1989 Legislature that makes it illegal to put a nuclear waste
dump in Nevada.
   The 21-page suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas, is
seen by DOE officials as the only way to get the much delayed
project back on track.
   In November, the agency announced it was revamping its schedule
for the controversial facility and would open it in the year 2010,
seven years later than planned.
   Gertz said the DOE needs to get the state permits and begin
exploratory drilling and other scientific work at the site by next
January to even be able to keep current with the revised schedule.
   State officials in December returned the air and water permits
to the DOE unprocessed, saying state law precluded them from
granting permits to build the dump. The DOE originally applied for
the permits in January 1988.

   Black and Hispanic inmates armed with
homemade knives brawled at an overcrowded county jail Thursday, and
12 were injured before guards restored order, officials said.
   One prisoner at the El Cajon detention center was critically
injured, said jail Commander Ben McLaughlin.
   He said the fight began about 4:30 p.m. between black and
Hispanic inmates at the jail 15 miles east of San Diego, where a
similar racially motivated fight left four inmates injured Dec. 13.
   Inmates retreated to their cells when deputies entered the
cellblock armed with electric stun guns a weapon that fires rubber
bullets. Inmates were armed with handmade knives and other crude
weapons, McLaughlin said.
   The brawl, attributed to overcrowding and racial tensions,
occurred in a cellblock designed to hold 24 inmates, but which held
100 prisoners when the riot broke out, McLaughlin said.
   Deputies saw a black inmate and a Hispanic inmate arguing
moments before their confrontation erupted into a large-scale
brawl, McLaughlin said.
   ``In this case, it was blacks vs. Hispanics,'' McLaughlin said.
``I was a racial issue, but we're not sure yet what sparked it. It
just erupted without warning.''
   One injured inmate was transported by helicopter to Sharp
Memorial Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition with
head injuries, said hospital spokeswoman Melanie Bruce. She
declined to release the inmate's name.
   Two other inmates suffering head injuries were admitted to
University of California, San Diego, Medical Center, said
spokeswoman Jane Swett. One was in serious condition and the other
in fair condition, she said, declining to release their names.
   At least nine other inmates suffering cuts, scrapes and other
minor injuries also were taken to various East San Diego County
hospitals for treatment.
   It took deputies about 15 minutes to get the prisoners into
their cells before deputies regained control of the cellblock,
McLaughlin said
   ``There is no damage to the cells. They were really injuring
themselves,'' McLauglin said.
   Deputies with guard dogs were stationed around the jail exterior
as a sheriff's helicopter with a spotlight circled overhead to
guard against any possible escapes.
   The detention facility is designed to hold 120, but housed
slightly more than 500 prisoners Thursday.

   For the sake of a 20-year-old leukemia victim,
about 9,600 people have undergone blood tests in the past three
months, hoping that they will be able to give her the bone marrow
that might save her life.
   Allison Atlas is still waiting. But as a result of her search
for a compatible donor, eight other patients have found potential
donors and a data bank that collects information about possible
donors is nearly 10,000 names richer.
   The Atlas family of Bethesda, Md., is among about 15 families
around the country who have gone public with marrow searches,
helped by a national organization.
   The families travel, talk to reporters, hold donor drives and
raise money to cover the $75 blood test fee for each volunteer they
bring in. Public relations and fund-raising pointers come from the
Life-Savers Foundation, the recruiting arm of the National Marrow
Donor Program in St. Paul, Minn.
   ``Help Save Allison's Life,'' entreats an advertisement that has
brought volunteers to synagogues and Jewish community centers in
Washington, Baltimore, Boston, New York, Harrisburg, Pa., Norfolk,
Va., and other cities.
   Each ad features a photo of the New York University business
major. Ms. Atlas, 20, sometimes appears at the blood-testing
centers, along with her parents and siblings.
   ``Several people have come up to me and said, `I hope I'm the
one,''' said Ms. Atlas. ``It's reinforced in my mind that we are
going to find someone.''
   ``It's been a very emotional experience for the whole family to
see all these people waiting in line,'' said her father, Alvin
Atlas.
   ``We're private people; it's been a very difficult thing to
do,'' said Atlas, a clothing store owner. ``But one of our goals is
to save our daughter's life. The doctors don't know how much time
we have.''
   Doctors told Ms. Atlas in August that her type of leukemia can
only be cured by a transplant to replace diseased marrow, which
produces new blood cells. Members of her family and 75,000 listings
at the National Marrow Donor Program did not match her tissue type.
   The odds of a match are usually about 1 in 20,000. It was
determined that her best chance for a match was among people who
shared her Eastern European Jewish ancestry, a group the donor pool
was largely lacking. In November, Friends of Allison started a
flurry of donor drives at Jewish institutions.
   Similarly inspired groups are working to enlarge the donor pools
for Asian-American, Greek-American and other ethnic groups.
   The family of Judie Davis in Oakland, Calif., is targeting
African-American donors. ``We're concerned because we might be
running out of time for her,'' said Liz Quam, a spokeswoman for the
donor bank.
   Dr. Rudy Brutico, a pediatrician and founder of Life-Savers,
said it helps the cause when a picture of a leukemia victim reminds
would-be donors of Mom or Cousin Joe. ``They identify with it,'' he
said.
   If a match is found between a potential donor and a patient, the
donor is asked to consent to a transplant. Doctors remove 1{ pints
of marrow from the donor's pelvic bone under general anesthesia.
The recipient gets the marrow in a blood transfusion and the marrow
cells lodge in the spongy interior of large bones.
   When the donor bank marked its first transplant on Dec. 15,
1987, ``it was then considered highly experimental,'' said Ms. Quam.
   Since then, the bank has arranged about 266 transplants. About
three-quarters had leukemia; 7 percent had aplastic anemia; and the
rest had other blood diseases. Doctors wait five to seven years
before pronouncing a cure, but all are doing well, said Ms. Quam.
   Ms. Quam said one patient has survived 19 years with a
transplant from a relative; another has lived 17 years with a
transplant from a non-relative.
   Brutico, of West Covina, Calif., founded Life-Savers in
September 1988 to help the donor bank find a match for his wife,
Diana, a mother of four who had leukemia. Mrs. Brutico found two
matches, got a transplant and no longer shows signs of the disease.
   ``My wife would be dead _ or dying in despair _ without the
goodness of some other person,'' said Brutico.
   Since then, Life-Savers has tested 50,000 volunteers, entering
their names and tissue type in the donor bank, and raised $3.5
million.
   This year, the national donor bank will begin to link up with
similar computers in other countries. The goal is a donor pool of 1
million worldwide by 1995, officials said.

   The Czechoslovakian Aviation Industry and
General Electric Co. announced an agreement Wednesday to produce a
40-passenger commuter airplane.
   Under the joint venture, the engines of the CT7-9B powered
versions of L610 turboprop plane will be manufactured in GE
Aircraft Engines' plant here. The aircraft will be built by the
state-owned Czechoslovakian company, which is known in that country
by the acronym LET.
   About 400 engines will be supplied for the plane, which will be
marketed around the world by LET, said Robert N. Salvucci, manager
of media relations for GE Aircraft Engines.
   Salvucci said the deal marked the first time a Western nation
would sell an aircraft engine to an Eastern Bloc nation for use in
a commercial venture. Czechoslovakia, like other Eastern European
countries, has undergone dramatic political liberalization in
recent months.
   ``This agreement will allow both parties to serve markets in
parts of the world that have not previously been accessible,'' said
Wallie Everest, director of GE's CT-7 turboprop program, in a
statement released by the company.
   ``We expect that well over $300 million worth of CT7 engines
will be purchased by the late 1990s and spare parts sales will add
to that business,'' he said.
   Czechoslovakian Aeronautics Industry and GE Aircraft Engines
also have agreed to develop a long-term relationship that will
include the manufacture of selected GE aircraft engine components
by LET and other Czech factories.
   ``This program will be a major step in the development of
worldwide commerce for both of our companies,'' said Frantisek
Hava, general director of OMNIPOL, a Czechoslovakian aviation
company.
   GE's CT7 turboprop engines were first used in commercial flights
in June 1984 and now power more than 190 aircraft in 16 countries.

<HEAD>Tape Transcripts Show Gotti Just After He Allegedly Assumes Mob
Power</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Reputed mob boss John Gotti was described as
``God's gift to the underworld'' in tapes secretly recorded by law
enforcement agents and played Wednesday to jurors at his assault
and conspiracy trial.
   Prosecutors say Gotti, 49, became boss of the Gambino crime
family, largest of New York's five Mafia factions, in December 1985
after then-boss Paul Castellano was gunned down in front of a steak
house.
   Transcripts of the tapes, which were released to the news media,
show Gotti concerned about keeping underlings, including lifelong
friends, in their place.
   At least once on the tapes, Gotti uses the term ``Cosa Nostra'
when he is apparently telling an unidentified man that mob soldiers
should not address him directly on business matters but should go
through their ``capos,'' or captains.
   The tapes also indicate a relationship with the Westies, a
vicious Irish-American gang that operates on Manhattan's West Side.
   The Westies are a key factor in Gotti's trial with associate
Anthony Guerrieri, 60, on charges of assault and conspiracy in the
1986 revenge shooting of John F. O'Connor, former vice president of
a Carpenters Union local.
   Gotti is accused of commissioning the Westies to shoot and wound
O'Connor because the union leader had thugs trash a restaurant
owned by Gotti associate Philip ``Philly'' Modica.
   The transcripts show at least one mention by Gotti of the
restaurant and several comments on the Westies.
   At one point Gotti says ``...they're doing something for me them
Irish guys...,'' but does not say what.
   At another point, Gotti refers to James Coonan as ``my friend''
who is ``the leader of the West Side gang, Irish guys.'' He also
says, ``He's on the payroll, and he gets it legitimately ...''
   The tapes were introduced by Edward Wright, an investigator with
the state's Organized Crime Task Force.
   Wright said the alleged mobsters, suspecting they might be under
surveillance, turned on hair dryers, flushed toilets, whispered and
used other means to try to make conversations inaudible.
   The tapes were made from listening devices placed in Gotti's
hangout in the borough of Qeens and monitored by police between
June 19, 1985, and Feb. 26, 1986.
   More than 1,000 cassettes were recorded, prosecutors say.
   One 1986 tape shows Gotti in a telephone conversation quoting
someone who praised him: ``When they say God's gift to the
underworld, you are it.
   ``He speaks with his heart,'' Gotti said on the telephone. ``He
means it. I tell ya something, I love the guy.''
   On another tape, Gotti expressed annoyance with lifelong friend
Angelo Ruggiero for his familiarity during business hours.
   ``I told Ange, `You gotta forget them liberties you take. Take
`em when we're alone,''' Gotti said.
   Gotti apparently had just made Ruggiero a ``caporegime,'' or
crew captain, according to the tape transcripts, and was not
satisfied that his friend was acting like a leader.
   Ruggiero, a defendant in the O'Connor case with Gotti, died of
natural causes last month.

   The House voted overwhelming Wednesday to
override President Bush's veto of legislation protecting Chinese
students from deportation, while Bush appealed to Republican
senators to resist and help him keep open ties to the world's most
populous nation.
   The House vote of 390-25 sent the matter to the Senate, where
both sides said the outcome of Thursday's scheduled vote was in
doubt.
   ``We've got a fighting chance,'' Bush said Wednesday night at a
state dinner for the president of North Yemen.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley declared, ``I don't think what's
most on the minds of the members of Congress is the sensitivities
of the present Chinese leadership. ... This is a leadership that
has in our judgment failed to respect the rights of its own
citizens.''
   ``On the issue of China, the president has lost his
credibility,'' said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the
House Foreign Affairs Asia subcommittee.
   Bush pinned his hopes on the Senate, where both Democratic and
Republican senators predicted a cliffhanger. The president,
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Secretary of State
James A. Baker III all were telephoning senators through the day.
   Bush was publicly appealing to GOP senators to support him in
the face of what he termed ``crass politics'' played by some
supporters of the override.
   But the chief House sponsor of the legislation, California
Democrat Nancy Pelosi, said she hoped senators would resist the
``full-court press'' by the White House.
   ``Why would he ask a senator to vote against human rights and
principles?'' she asked after the House vote.
   The legislation would affect as many as 32,000 Chinese students
now in the United States on ``exchange visitor'' visas. The bill
would waive a legal requirement that those students return home for
two years after their visas expire before returning to the United
States or going elsewhere.
   In addition, the bill would permit any Chinese student whose
visa has expired _ as many as 8,000 others _ to remain in the
United States as long as danger exists at home, and would allow
Chinese students to work while in this country.
   Bush vetoed the measure on Nov. 30 after it had passed
unanimously in the House and by a voice vote in the Senate. Chinese
student groups have lobbied hard for an override of the veto,
saying many of them would face political persecution at home
because they supported the pro-democracy demonstrations that
brought a violent government crackdown last June.
   A group made up of Chinese students hailed the House vote as
``an historic victory for human rights in China.''
   ``We are hopeful that the strong support in the Senate will be
enhanced by the House vote,'' said Haiching Zhao of the Independent
Federation of Chinese Students and Scholars, which represents
42,000 Chinese students at more than 200 U.S. colleges and
universities.
   At the time Bush vetoed the bill, he ordered government agencies
to adopt what he contends are essentially the same safeguards. The
veto was simply an effort to preserve executive branch foreign
policy prerogatives, he said, and to keep open the door for future
student and cultural exchanges.
   ``I will not break faith with the Chinese students here. ...
They were safe then, and they are safe now, and they will be safe
in the future,'' Bush told a White House news conference Wednesday.
   To the 37 GOP senators who attended a breakfast at the White
House, Bush hit hard on his contention that a veto override would
mean a total cutoff of the flow of students to the United States,
and he appeared to be winning a few converts.
   ``The price of the Pelosi bill is lost opportunity for the
Chinese scholars of tomorrow,'' the president told reporters later.
   ``The bill is totally unnecessary. The long-term policy
consequences are potentially great. And Congress, in my view, will
have only itself to blame.''
   Bush listed steps the Beijing government has taken which he said
justified his policy toward China: the lifting of martial law in
the capital; the release of jailed dissidents; a promise not to
sell medium-range missiles to Syria; acceptance of Peace Corps
volunteers, Fulbright scholars and a Voice of America correspondent
back into the country; and the muting of anti-U.S. propaganda.
   But critics have countered that the missile promise was nothing
more than a repeating of assurances given months before the
crackdown, that the effects of martial law remain in place and that
arrests, harassment and secret trials of pro-democracy agitators
continue.
   They also contend that Bush's administrative actions to protect
the students can be revoked at any time and could be subject to a
court challenge.
   Three Republican senators who attended a White House meeting
with Bush on other matters late in the day said afterward they
stood with the president on the China question and predicted his
veto would be sustained.
   Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., said, ``We expect to see that veto
sustained.''
   Asked if Bush already had the support of 34 GOP senators, Sen.
John Warner, R-Va., said, ``We're closing the gap on that question
right now.''
   ``I'm going to support the president,'' said Sen. David
Durenberger, R-Minn.
   All 25 House members who voted against the override were
Republicans: Bob Stump, Arizona; John Paul Hammerschmidt and Tommy
Robinson, Arkansas; Porter Goss, Andy Ireland and C.W. Bill Young,
Florida; Dennis Hastert, Ed Madigan and Robert Michel, Illinois;
Richard Baker, Clyde Holloway and Jim McCrery, Louisiana.; Norman
Lent, New York; Paul Gillmor, Ohio; Larry Coughlin and George
Gekas, Pennsylvania.; James Quillen and Don Sundquist, Tennessee;
Larry Combest, Tom DeLay and Lamar Smith, Texas; James Hansen,
Utah; Herbert Bateman, Virginia; Thomas Petri and James
Sensenbrenner, Wisconsin.
   Not voting were: Ronnie Flippo, D-Ala.; Don Young, R-Alaska; Jim
Kolbe, R-Ariz.; Bill Nelson, D-Fla.; Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.;
Brian Donnelly, D-Mass.; Bob Carr, D-Mich.; Guy VanderJagt,
R-Mich.; Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn.; Floyd Flake, D-N.Y.; Mary Rose
Oakar, D-Ohio; Les AuCoin, D-Ore.; Joe Kolter, D-Pa.; Austin
Murphy, D-Pa.; Joseph McDade, R-Pa.; and Charles Wilson, D-Texas.
   Voting for the override were 245 Democrats and 145 Republicans.
There are four vacancies in the 435-member House.

   A 31-year-old East German man has
been arrested in West Germany on suspicion of trying to recruit
students to work for East Germany's intelligence service,
authorities say.
   The Chief Federal Prosecutor's office on Wednesday identified
the suspect as Michael Keiser of the East German city of Halle.
   Keiser is suspected of spying for East Germany since June, the
office said in a statement. It said he had attempted to recruit
English-speaking university students and was arrested Jan. 18 in
the central city of Mannheim.
   At the time of his arrest, Keiser was carrying false
identification papers and a fake passport, the statement said.
   The statement did not specify the nature of the information
gathered by Keiser, who remains in investigative custody pending
completion of the investigation against him.
   Although the East German governmment has been dismantling the
country's secret police under growing opposition pressure, West
German officials have warned that East German agents are continuing
to spy abroad.

   Privilege in China is rarely ostentatious, and
the store at No. 32 Donganmen Street is no exception.
   The facade is ordinary brown stone, with a narrow entry for
cars. The window shades are down, and further protected by heavy
iron grills. There is no sign.
   Inside, however, may be the only food store in China with more
sales clerks than customers.
   Around the corner on Wangfujing Street, thousands of shoppers
jostled their way to counters on a recent afternoon to buy food for
Saturday's Lunar New Year, but the store at No. 32 was nearly
deserted.
   Four clerks stood idle behind a glass counter displaying China's
best-brand cigarettes, liquor, candy and canned food. Two more
women sat in the cashier's booth, and four other workers stood
nearby.
   Two men lugging a large crate of eggs out to a truck were the
only customers. Across the courtyard, another room housed freezers
of meat and fish, also with no buyers.
   ``Our store is not for the residents,'' said deputy manager Qin
Jie. ``Not everyone can come in, only those approved by the higher
authorities.''
   The store, run by the Beijing City Food Supply Center, a
wholesale food distributor, is part of China's little-publicized,
decades-old network of special privileges for top-level officials
and their families.
   Qin would not say just who can shop at the store, which opened
in 1955. The exchange went like this:
   ``A few leading comrades can come,'' he said.
   ``Who?'' he was asked.
   ``A few. The scope is set by the higher authorities,'' he said.
   ``Can the president?''
   ``Yes,'' Qin replied.
   ``The premier?''
   ``Yes,'' he said.
   ``A Cabinet minister?'' he was asked.
   ``Not necessarily,'' Qin said.
   ``Less than 10 people?''
   ``Several dozen.'' he said.
   ``How many dozen?''
   ``A few,'' Qin answered.
   A recent article in the Hong Kong-based China Market magazine
said the store originally supplied only the state chairman, premier
and president and their deputies, and the chairmen and deputies of
the legislature and Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, a high-level advisory body.
   But after these officials retired or died, their relatives
continued using the store, the magazine said, and their successors
expanded the customer list.
   In August, as part of a package of measures intended to blunt
popular resentment of official privilege, the government said it
was ending special supplies of rationed foods to top officials. Qin
said leaders had been allowed to buy extra cooking oil, meat, sugar
and eggs at subsidized prices.
   Ordinary Chinese were limited to rations, or in recent years,
could buy extra only on the high-priced free market.
   But the government did not shut down No. 32, which still offers
the rare privilege of convenient shopping.
   ``We stock many things so you can buy all in one stop,'' said
Qin. He said the store offers a wider selection and generally
higher quality of meat and fish than most markets, at slightly
higher prices.
   But a comparison found some items were cheaper: ham, for
example, went for less than 85 cents a pound, compared with $1.05
at a regular store. Maotai, China's famous fiery liquor, sold for
$18, compared with $19.50 at the ordinary shop.
   Qin said there was no contradiction in a socialist society
offering special stores for special people. ``It's convenient,'' he
said with some exasperation. ``China is a developing country and
its foodstuffs are not so ample.''
   He noted that ordinary citizens are supposed to buy their
monthly rations of state-subsidized meat, eggs and rice at assigned
stores, and said the concept was similar. ``No store could supply
all of society.''
   Annual sales to leading officials were no more than $213,000,
out of the Beijing City Food Supply Center's total sales of about
$17 million, Qin said.
   The center's main customers are hotels and two small stores for
visiting overseas Chinese and foreigners _ who, like officials,
often have special status in China. These places buy wholesale from
a large, well-marked building across the street from No. 32.
   Neither building is a place to meet top officials.
   ``As far as I know they don't come themselves. Usually it's
household servants who come. We've never encountered the wife or
relative of a (Communist Party) Central Committee member,'' Qin
said.
   ``When you come here it's like walking into any department
store,'' added Li Peiji, assistant managing director. ``We don't
ask a customer's status.''
   That's for three employees who stand near the entrance to do.
Qin said they ask customers to show a card indicating authorization
to shop there.
   But three men who walked in for cigarettes shortly before the 5
p.m. closing time said no one asked them for ID.
   ``I've been here a few times,'' said one, wearing the uniform of
a navy commander. ``They have a wide variety of goods and the
service isn't bad.''
   Asked if they were related to any high-ranking officials, the
three just laughed.
   Qin was unperturbed by the apparent breach of exclusivity.
   ``Maybe when he came before he was with someone who had
identification,'' he said of the navy commander. ``We welcome the
expansion of our service.''

   Police staged nationwide raids on the
homes of dozens of suspected neo-Nazis and confiscated reams of
right-wing extremist propaganda, officials said.
   West German police raided 40 residences in 26 cities on
Wednesday in a coordinated move to confiscate neo-Nazi material,
according to a statement by state police in Stuttgart.
   About 200 police officiers took part in the raids, which
targeted suspected members of the Action Front National
Socialists@National Activists.
   The group, officially banned in 1986 as a threat to the
constitution, was founded by former West Germany army Lt. Michael
Kuehnen in the 1970s. Police say the group has between 800 and
1,000 active members.
   Kuehnen, a self-proclaimed successor to Adolf Hitler, has been
jailed several times over the past decade for extreme-rightist
activities, including incitement of the public and publicly
preaching Nazi propaganda.
   He is currently free.
   Included in the confiscated matter was training material to
indoctrinate new members along with neo-Nazi advertising
propaganda, the statement said.
   Among the cities where the raids were staged were West Berlin,
Hamburg, Cologne, Essen and Aachen, police said.
   No one was arrested during the searches, but police said arrests
were possible after officials have evaluated the confiscated
material.
   Similar searches in West Germany were carried out against
neo-Nazis in 1988, resulting in charges against five people for
membership in a banned extremist organization.

   China's senior leader Deng Xiaoping has
predicted the downfall of Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the resurgence
of Soviet conservatives, a newspaper reported today.
   The South China Morning Post, quoting unnamed Chinese sources in
Beijing, said Deng last week told Communist Party leaders that the
ethnic turmoil and separatist movements sweeping the Soviet Union
are products of the Soviet president's reform program.
   ``After Gorbachev has fallen from power, he will be replaced by
the conservative faction,'' Deng was quoted as saying. The
85-year-old Chinese patriarch did not say when he expected the
change.
   Deng, under whose leadership China's pro-democracy movement was
crushed in June, has resigned from all his party posts to make way
for younger leaders but is still believed to be the most powerful
man in China.
   China's hard-line leaders have been alarmed by the bloody
overthrow of Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania and
democratic movements sweeping Eastern Europe.

   Non-union coal operators drove trucks
through a human barricade Wednesday after federal marshals ordered
tow trucks to haul away vehicles blocking a coal company's private
road.
   No one was injured when the three coal trucks, with steel plates
protecting their radiators, crossed a makeshift bridge leading to
the Rum Creek Coal Sales Inc. preparation plant. A female picket,
however, was shoved by a federal marshal escorting the plant's
contractor and was taken away by ambulance.
   U.S. District Judge Dennis Knapp last week issued an injunction
barring United Mine Workers pickets from blocking the road leading
to the plant and limiting the number of pickets at the site to 15.
Two union members arrested for allegedly violating the order
appeared in court Wednesday.
   The contractor, Mike Holbrook, was called to use a cutting torch
to slice through a cable that attached a car to the private bridge.
   Holbrook, wearing a blue baseball hat reading ``Scab 1,''
withstood taunts and insults while cutting the cable in front of
about 75 UMW members and supporters.
   About two dozen union miners struck in mid-August after Rum
Creek, a subsidiary of the A.T. Massey Coal Co., hired a non-union
contractor to run the plant.
   It was the third day of unrest at the bridge. Six people were
arrested Tuesday after coal trucks plowed through vehicle
barricades. Two women were injured in similar incidents Monday.
   Three cars were on the bridge at sunrise Wednesday when federal
marshals arrived accompanied by tow trucks. Two four-wheel-drive
vehicles were removed without trouble, and marshals escorted
Holbrook to the bridge to free the car. After the vehicles were
removed, non-union coal trucks slowly pushed their way past miners
in the road.
   Later, the non-union operators left their coal trucks inside the
preparation plant and left the site in four-wheel-drive vehicles
with plexiglass protecting the windows.
   When Holbrook was escorted through a group of miners to a
waiting van, a marshal knocked over the picket, Cora Ballard, who
is in her late 40s.
   ``What did she do to you? What did she deserve to get hit?''
said Kimberly Goodman, Ballard's daughter. ``She was just standing
and you had to hit her.''
   ``All she was trying to do was stand up for her man's job,''
said Kathy Justice, the wife of a miner.
   Ballard suffered bruises on both arms and hit her head when she
fell, and was treated at Logan General Hospital and released, said
her brother, John Workman.
   About 18 West Virginia State Police troopers, who are barred by
state law from taking sides in labor disputes, watched from the
side.
   Howard Green, a UMW international executive board member, and
Bernard Evans, a union strike coordinator, appeared Wednesday
before Judge Knapp and were freed on $10,000 bail each. They were
arrested Tuesday for violating the judge's order.
   Three men arrested Tuesday after allegedly plowing through the
picket line in non-union coal trucks were released on bail
Wednesday, according to Logan County Magistrate Court assistant
Tammy Hall. One of the men pleaded innocent to attempted murder, he
added.
   Rum Creek Coal Sales President Richard Zigmond swore out 90 new
complaints Wednesday seeking the arrest of pickets for trespassing
and parking other vehicles on private property, Hall said. Arrests
on those warrants are expected Thursday, she said.

   Rep. Thomas A. Luken, D-Ohio, a former
Cincinnati mayor who has served in Congress since 1976, announced
Wednesday he will retire when his term ends Jan. 1.
   Luken, 64, a lawyer who has maintained his home in Cincinnati,
is serving his seventh consecutive term.
   ``I expect that this is my swan song in elective office. You
never say never, but it's likely that I will not attempt elective

   He said he has not decided what he will do next, but indicated
he may still spend time in Washington after leaving Congress. Luken
said he is announcing his departure from Congress now to give other
potential candidates for his office time to decide whether to file
qualifying documents by the Feb. 22 filing deadline.
   Luken said he does not know who the Republicans planned to field
as a candidate and said he felt confident that he could win again
if he decided to seek re-election.
   Luken's eight children include Cincinnati Mayor Charles J.
Luken. The younger Luken, 38, said he is considering running for
his father's congressional seat and scheduled a news conference at

   ``Being a congressman is something I've wanted to do for a long

   A retired city police captain shot and
killed her husband and retarded son Wednesday, and had turned the
gun on herself when police talked her into putting the weapon down.
   Dorothea Sweeten, 66, called a minister to tell her about the
shootings, said Lt. Herman Johnson of the Knox County Sheriff's
Department. The minister notified authorities, who rushed to the
home south of Knoxville and found Mrs. Sweeten still on the
telephone, threatening to kill herself.
   ``When they arrived she had the gun under her chin,'' Johnson
said. ``It was cocked and she had her finger on the trigger.''
   Johnson said Capt. Bryan Sturgell, head of the department's SWAT
team, talked her into dropping the gun.
   Mrs. Sweeten's husband Tom, 55, and her son, Charles H. Forester
Jr., 39, were found in separate bedrooms of her house after police
were notified about 1:30 p.m.
   Sweeten was managing editor of The Knoxville Journal for 12
years before joining the Tennessee Valley Authority as a
communications manager in 1986.
   Mrs. Sweeten retired as a captain from the Knoxville police
department in 1982 after 28 years on the force. She became a
security officer for the U.S. Marshal's Service office in
Knoxville, from which she also retired.
   Johnson said Mrs. Sweeten was taken to a hospital for
observation. He said no charges were filed immediately.

<HEAD>Study: Women Smokers' Heart Attack Risk Falls Soon After Quitting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women who give up smoking lower their risk of
heart attacks quickly, just as men do, a study today concludes.
   Women who smoke face nearly four times the usual risk of heart
attacks before age 65. Earlier research has shown that the high
risk of heart attacks in male smokers goes away within a few years
of stopping. But the new study is the first to show that this also
happens in women.
   ``The present data underscore the value of smoking cessation for
women, as for men, and may give women a convincing motive to quit,
even if they have smoked heavily for many years,'' the researchers
wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   The study found that the risk of suffering a first heart attack
was 3.6 times higher among current smokers than among those who
never had smoked. However, within three years of giving up smoking,
their risk had dropped to the point where it was no higher than
that of the non-smokers.
   Smoking has fallen from favor among both sexes, although the
decline has been steeper among men. During the past two decades,
the proportion of men who smoke has fallen from 51 percent to 29
percent, while among women it has dropped from 33 percent to 24
percent.
   The latest analysis was conducted by Dr. Lynn Rosenberg and
colleagues from the Sloan Epidemiology Unit at Boston University
School of Medicine.
   The work was based on 910 women who were admitted for heart
attacks at 71 hospitals in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut
and New York. Their smoking habits were compared to those of 2,375
women who were in the hospitals for other reasons.

<HEAD>Amnesty International Accuses Somalia of New Rights Abuses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International today accused
Somalia's government of arbitrarily imprisoning, torturing and
executing its citizens without a fair trial.
   The London-based human rights organization called on the
government of President Mohammed Siad Barre to establish ``a
comprehensive program of legal and institutional reforms'' to end
the abuses.
   Amnesty pointed to what it called ``political arrests and
killings in July, 1989, and further human rights violations later
in the year.''
   It called them ``a serious setback to human rights improvements
made in the first half of 1989,'' when the government of the Horn
of Africa country released more than 1,000 political prisoners.
   With its 13-page report, Amnesty became the second international
human rights organization to sharply criticize the Siad Barre
regime this year.
   Earlier this month, New York-based Africa Watch said the Somali
military had killed between 40,000 and 50,000 unarmed civilians in
the past 19 months.
   Africa Watch said most of the victims were members of the Isaac
clan, from which a northern insurgent group, the Somali National
Movement, largely draws its strength.
   Amnesty noted that it had been allowed to send a delegation to
Somalia in June for the first time in 20 years, but said it
received ``few replies'' from the government since then.
   Shortly after its June visit, Amnesty said, ``there were new
arrests of suspected political opponents, killings of demonstrators
and extrajudicial executions.'' The organization said most
political prisoners are held under a vague security law and tried
by a court ``lacking judicial independence.''
   Amnesty said defendants can be sentenced to death for
``organizing a subversive association'' or strikes and ``exploiting
religion for creating national disunity.''
   Washington has withheld or canceled more than $50 million in aid
dating back to 1987 because of human rights abuses. Britain, France
and other Western donors also have slashed funds.
    Siad Barre, a major general said to be in his 80s, seized power
in October 1968 to prevent the election to the presidency of a
civilian opposed by the army. In recent years he has ruled a
deteriorating nation beset by tribal rebellions in the north and
south, clan warfare, and a bankrupt economy.
   Somalia became independent in 1960 after the unification of the
north and south, colonized by Britain and Italy respectively.

   The U.S. theater is superficial, says Arthur
Miller, who's in London for rehearsals of his play ``The Price,'
which opens next month.
   Contrasting unsubsidized theater in the United States with the
state-aided British theater, Miller said American theater often has
degenerated into a search for titillating ways to fill unsubsidized
and expensive seats.
   During a break at the Young Vic theater, the 74-year-old
playwright told reporters that standards in British theater could
fall if subsidies were reduced.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government
favors financing the arts by private business sponsorship.
   Miller, known for such works as ``Death of a Salesman'' and
``The Crucible,'' said unsubsidized American seat prices made an
evening at the theater so expensive that general audiences would
not go unless a critic said the production was a masterpiece, even
if the critic was wrong.
   He said that meant audiences in the United States have become a
self-serving clique and the plays appear tailored to match the
audience.

   A woman who claims she was the companion of
``Star Trek'' star William Shatner has sued him for $3 million in a
``palimony'' lawsuit.
   Vira Montes claims in her Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit
that she was Shatner's ``companion, confidante and homemaker'' from
September 1984 until early this month.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday by attorney Marvin Mitchelson, said
she gave up a career as a medical assistant in exchange for
Shatner's promise of financial support.
   Mitchelson said Shatner has remained married to Marci Shatner,
his second wife, throughout the relationship with Montes.
Mitchelson said the actor spent time with each woman.
   The lawsuit says Shatner, 58, had promised to marry her.
   Shatner starred as Capt. James T. Kirk in the ``Star Trek''
television series and subsequent movies. He also had the title role
in the series about Los Angeles policeman ``T.J. Hooker.'' He
currently hosts ``Rescue 911.''

   More than 1.9 million early retirees are
willing and able to return to work, according to a private survey
released today that its sponsors say uncovers a promising untapped
labor pool for American business.
   ``The exciting news for employers is it's a far more robust pool
than we had imagined,'' said Thomas W. Moloney, senior vice
president of The Commonwealth Fund, a philanthropic foundation that
commissioned the poll.
   ``The United States is expected to face a severe labor shortage
by early in the next century,'' he said. ``This report should
encourage business to look toward capable, committed older
Americans to fill many of these openings.''
   Moloney said the findings run counter to popular perceptions
that there are few older Americans who are available, capable and
willing to return to work in the kinds of jobs that are in demand.
   The findings are based on a 1989 national survey by Louis Harris
and Associates Inc. of 1,751 men aged 55-64 and 1,758 women aged
50-59, with 43 percent of those surveyed not working. The different
age groups for men and women were selected to catch them at the
times when more people traditionally drop out of the work force.
   The survey found the retirees' main reason for wanting to return
to work was to do something useful, cited by 71 percent. Sixty-four
percent said working keeps them feeling younger, 46 percent said
they were bored without a job, 45 percent said they needed extra
spending money and 43 percent they needed money for essentials.
   The survey data was analyzed by ICF Inc., a Washington
consulting firm, which concluded that of the 1.9 million older
people who are willing and able to work, 1.1 million are highly
committed to and capable of rejoining the work force.
   These people said they need a job for financial reasons, are
physically able to do key tasks such as driving or using a
calculator, are seeking work and have reasonable wage expectations,
are willing to work under difficult conditions such as standing up
or on weekends. They are also willing to take jobs that are in
demand such as sales, word processing, clerical positions, day care
and managerial posts.
   These retirees also had education, job skills and experience
largely comparable to those of their counterparts still in the work
force, the poll found.
   Seventy-five percent were high school or college graduates,
compared to 85 percent of those still working. Sixty-four percent
had five or more years of experience on their last job, compared to
77 percent of current older workers.
   Most also were willing to work under difficult conditions: 83
percent would take seasonal jobs, 60 percent would work standing
up, 73 percent would work alone, 60 percent would commute more than
30 minutes and 54 percent would work evenings and weekends.
   ``What we see here are capable, educated, experienced people who
want to get back in,'' Moloney said. ``These are people who
certainly should not be at the age of retirement.''
   Moloney said the study did not analyze why these people left the
work force before age 65, but they may have been forced out of
their jobs, quit because of family demands or thought they had
enough retirement income to stop working.
   He said many of the retirees have been discouraged from
rejoining the labor force by employers looking for younger workers,
but the climate is changing as labor markets tighten and employers'
attitudes toward older workers improve.
   The Commonwealth Fund said employers need to be better educated
about the abilities and availability of early retirees, older
persons should be encouraged to actively seek work, and programs
such as job banks should be established to help match jobs and
workers. The foundation said it was launching an Older Americans at
Work Program designed to change impressions about the value and
ability of older workers.

<HEAD>Virtual Collapse of Warsaw Pact a Mixed Blessing, Experts Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A generation of U.S. military officers reared
on the threat of a Soviet invasion of Europe now agree the Warsaw
Pact is dying in the wake of the revolution in Eastern Europe.
   But some regard the demise of their old enemy as a mixed
blessing.
   ``These changes in Eastern Europe reduce the Soviet Union's
confidence and capacity to wage coalition warfare,'' said Lt. Gen.
Henry Soyster, head of the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency,
an organization that historically has emphasized Soviet strengths
rather than weaknesses.
   Soviet officials have not publicly acknowledged the de facto
collapse of their alliance, declaring instead their readiness to
transform the Warsaw Pact from a military into a political
organization.
   U.S. analysts say such a transformation has little chance of
success.
   For the United States and its 15 allies in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, the collapse of their Eastern counterpart
creates some uneasiness.
   At the height of the East European revolution last fall, many
U.S. officials thought the Warsaw Pact should be preserved as a
vehicle for negotiating conventional force reductions in Europe and
as a forum for resolving potential disagreements within the Soviet
Bloc, said one administration source.
   Most policymakers now have concluded ``that there is a danger in
the artificial perpetuation of an institution that might collapse
of its own weight,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Dissenters from that view want a Warsaw Pact ``because of the
shaken confidence which would result from a sudden demise,'' the
source said.
   Soyster said the collapse of the Warsaw Pact virtually
eliminated the threat of an East-West confrontation in Europe,
which for decades was deemed the most likely starting place for a
superpower war.
   ``I believe that the Soviets would consider large scale theater
operations against NATO with only their own forces as highly risky,
if not impractical,'' Soyster testified on the first day of Senate
Armed Service Committee hearings on the Soviet threat.
   At a conference of Eastern and Western military officers last
week in Vienna, Lt. Gen. Nikolai Chervov of the Soviet General
Staff said ``there will be major restructuring of the Eastern
Bloc's military command apparatus,'' handing authority from Soviet
generals to East European elected leaders, Soyster told the Senate
committee.
   The point, Chervov and others Soviets have said, is to transform
the Warsaw Pact from a military into a political organization.
   ``The Warsaw Pact is dead as a military organization, because
the Eastern European nations are asking the Soviets to withdraw
their troops. How can they expect to keep it as a political
organization?'' said James A. Blackwell, a former Army officer and
analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in
Washington.
   Although none of the six non-Soviet nations in the pact have
withdrawn, three of them _ Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland _
have asked that Soviet troops be withdrawn from their territory. No
Soviet troops are in Bulgaria and Romania.
   Last week at the Vienna conference, Hungarian military leader
Laszlo Borsits said his nation would stay in the Warsaw Pact ``for
the time being,'' but would cut its troops by one-third.
Czechoslovakia and Poland also have announced force reductions.
   Despite the changes, Borsits said the Warsaw Pact and NATO
should remain as ``a stabilizing factor ... Their loosening would
upset the balance and would lead to incalculable consequences.''
   The unstated fear is of a unified Germany.
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger suggested in a
recent television interview that Moscow should ``maintain some
position in Eastern Europe as a safety net if ... there should be a
revival of German nationalism or expansionism.'' The unification of
East and West Germany, he said, was inevitable.

<HEAD>Gorbachev's Chances for Success Fading, Economist Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swedish economist, author of a widely
acclaimed book on Mikhail S. Gorbachev's attempts at reform, says
the Soviet leader's chances of success are fading and that he may
be pushed out of office.
   ``The Soviet Union is not only lagging, but plunging further
into a crisis that can be called an economic catastrophe,'' Anders
Aslund told a small seminar Wednesday attended by several top
administration analysts.
   The Soviets face three likely scenarios: radical reform, deeper
chaos or a ``counterrevolution'' by the military or conservative
Communist Party leaders who will seek to reimpose an authoritarian
system, Anders told a seminar at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington think tank.
   Aslund, who worked in the Swedish Embassy in Moscow in 1984-87,
attracted wide attention among administration and academic analysts
last year with his book, ``Gorbachev's Struggle for Economic
Reform.''
   Consumers are experiencing acute shortages of food and other
staples and industry faces an energy crisis. Wages are growing
faster than prices although there are fewer goods for workers to
purchase, said Aslund. He noted that the Soviet Union experienced a
5 percent drop in 1989 ``national income,'' the statistic the
Soviets use to measure their overall economic performance.
   He predicted a 10 percent drop in 1990 for national income.
   Two top administration analysts on the Soviet Union shared
Aslund's pessimism, but questioned aspects of his dire predictions.
   Both analysts, speaking on condition of anonymity, shared
Aslund's view that deeper chaos was likely, but said Gorbachev had
more support on the ruling Politburo than described by Aslund.
   Aslund said opposition is growing against the Soviet leader in
the upper echelons of the Communist Party, in the government
bureaucracies and among local party leaders.
   ``The bureaucracies are ganging up,'' he said.
   Gorbachev has only two reliable allies on the ruling Politburo,
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Aleksandr Yakovlev,
said Aslund, predicting the moderate majority might give the top
job to Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov.
   One of the senior administration analysts said Gorbachev has a
working majority on the 11-member body, including Ryzhkov and other
moderate economic decision-makers.
   ``He has to have more support. Any other explanation simply
doesn't explain what has happened,'' said the analyst. ``The
Politburo has been growing steadily more liberal'' under popular
pressure.
   But, he said, Gorbachev might be forced from his job as
Communist Party general secretary if fighting continues in and
around the southern republic of Azerbaijan or he fails to persuade
the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia to drop their
plans to secede from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev nonetheless might complete his five-year term as
president, the analyst said, adding that the Congress of People's
Deputies, which elected Gorbachev president last year, does not
have enough power to contest the military or the KGB secret police.
   The prestige of the Communist Party will decrease following
elections scheduled in February and March in the 15 Soviet
republics, both administration analysts predicted.
   Aslund said Gorbachev missed an opportunity for radical economic
reform by failing to push through a plan advanced last fall by
Leonid Abalkin, a deputy premier. Abalkin advocated rapid
introduction of market economy along lines followed by the
Solidarity-led government in neighboring Poland.
   Instead, ``what we are seeing is a complete retraction from
reform,'' as the central government attempts to reassert economic
authority, Aslund said.
   President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III are
taking the correct policy toward Gorbachev, praising his efforts
and granting him a number of economic favors at the Malta summit
last December, said Aslund.
   ``Bush and Baker are approaching this in the right way, saying
they want perestroika to succeed,'' Aslund said, using the Russian
word for the reforms. ``I think it extremely unlikely that it
will.''
   The payoff from Gorbachev's reforms could come a decade hence,
he said.
   ``I look on what is happening as a learning experience,'' he
said. The ideas pursued by Gorbachev and his radical allies will
have a better chance of success when Soviet citizens ``are more
mature,'' he said. ``I am fairly optimistic about the long-term.''

   Psychologists say teams in black are
scarier, and the Indiana Pacers believe the darker design of their
new uniforms will help make them contenders in the 1990s.
   Florence Griffith-Joyner, the Olympic sprint
champion-turned-fashion designer who raced in outlandish outfits
featuring lace, pastels and single leggings, designed the new togs,
which will be worn by next season's team.
   Navy blue replaces royal blue in a color scheme that also
includes gold and white.
   Modeling the new uniform at a ringside news conference
Wednesday, forward and co-captain Chuck Person did a bit of color
psychologizing.
   ``I think the lighter shade didn't give us the flash, the
go-get-'em attitude,'' Person said. The royal blue was a
``slower-looking color.''
   The new outfit, which also includes a V-neck and a gold triangle
on the top, ``feels great,'' Person said.
   Guard Reggie ``Hollywood'' Miller, a friend of Flo-Jo since
their days at the University of California, Los Angeles, was happy
that he would be allowed to wear the nearly knee-length shorts he
favors.
   The uniforms will make the Pacers a ``mean team,'' Miller said.
   The Pacers have earned a trip to the playoffs only once in seven
years, in 1980-81 when they finished 41-41. They were 22-18 after
Wednesday night's loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.

   The Navy secretary is defending the service's
new $1.2 billion guided-missile destroyer against congressional
charges of contracting problems and the absence of a basic test of
the ship's sophisticated computer system.
   ``These ships will be the most advanced, most powerful
destroyers ever sent to sea,'' H. Lawrence Garrett III told members
of a House Armed Services panel Wednesday that is looking into
allegations surrounding the Arleigh Burke-class ship.
   The Navy currently plans to purchase 33 of the ships at a cost
of $27 billion.
   Martin M. Ferber, director of the General Accounting Office's
National Security and International Affairs Division, said the lead
ship, under construction by the Bath Iron Works in Maine, is 17
months behind schedule and design changes have resulted in the
billion-dollar plus pricetag.
   ``Bath Iron Works is now accelerating construction to meet the
planned delivery in February 1991,'' Ferber told the subcommittee
on seapower and strategic and critical materials.
   But Garrett argued the program is ``on track to provide our
fleet the most capable destroyer ever built, within the contractor
cost the Navy estimated more than six years ago, and on a delivery
schedule which has remained constant for more than two.''
   Members of the panel largely agreed with the Navy secretary that
the program is important, focusing their criticism on the GAO, the
investigative arm of Congress, and a fellow colleague who initially
complained about the destroyer.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the chairman of the House Energy and
Commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, wrote a
letter to the Navy last September citing cost overruns and schedule
delays in the destroyer program.
   Dingell was unable to testify before the Armed Services panel
because of a scheduling conflict, but in a four-page letter to the
subcommittee said his early assessment of the program as a
``procurement nightmare'' may have been an understatement.
   Dingell complained the sophisticated Aegis computer system that
will be installed on the destroyer has never been tested against
some missiles.
   ``A specific type of missile, known as an anti-radiation missile
that is specifically targeted to home in on the Aegis' powerful
radar emissions, has never been tested against the system,''
Dingell said.
   Rep. Charles E. Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the Armed Services
panel, raised that issue with Garrett, questioning why the Aegis
hasn't been tested against the anti-radiation missile.
   ``The ARM is like any other cruise missile to the Aegis,''
Garrett said.
   But when pressed by Bennett, the Navy secretary conceded there
were some dangers involved.

   The Bush administration is assuring Congress
of strong support for a popular nutrition program for poor pregnant
women and children after a new report showed Reagan appointees
erroneously downplayed its benefits.
   Birge Watkins, deputy assistant agriculture secretary for food
and consumer services, said Wednesday the Reagan administration was
wrong to change a study on the effectiveness of the Women, Infants
and Children nutrition program.
   ``We are all aware of President Bush's strong support of the WIC
program and of its significant investment in the next generation,''
Watkins told a joint hearing of the House Select Committee on
Hunger and the Senate Agriculture Committee.
   He said the Bush administration agreed with a General Accounting
Office investigation which showed the Agriculture Department under
President Reagan inserted errors and deleted important conclusions
in a study of WIC that was released in 1986.
   ``It's simply no way to do business. We regret this whole
incident happened,'' said Watkins.
   Members of Congress were outraged.
   ``The original report did not track with the administration
ideological bent, so the findings were cooked to make them more
palatable,'' charged Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa. ``What a despicable
and insensitive action.''
   John Bode, assistant secretary for food and consumer services
under Reagan, strongly disagreed with that characterization.
   Bode, who was responsible for the administration's handling of
the study, was not invited to testify. He said in a telephone
interview after the hearing that the changes were not made for
political reasons.
   ``To assert there was willful misrepresentation to Congress is
wrong,'' he said.
   The revisions were written by Thomas Sullivan, then a special
assistant to Bode.
   Now practicing law, Bode said he believes the compendium was
wrong, but thought at the time that Sullivan and others at the
department who reviewed the study knew what they were doing.
   He said that shortly after the review, he changed procedures for
handling such matters so the same mistakes would not happen.
   Bode said the main problem was that Sullivan wrote a compendium
for the Reagan administration report on WIC in which he downplayed
the strength of the program. Bode said WIC should have gotten a
much stronger endorsement.
   Sullivan, who also has left government service, could not
immediately be reached for comment.
   Keith Fultz, of the GAO, said investigators could not pin down
the intent behind the changes.
   He said the summary written by the original researchers was
deleted and replaced by a compendium that ``did not fairly
represent what the study team found.''
   That the study took almost seven years to complete also angered
members of the two committees.
   ``The final report took six years instead of the originally
targeted 2{ years to complete, and cost $6 million, instead of the
planned $3.9 million,'' said Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, chairman of
the hunger committee.
   The WIC program was started in 1972. Congress appropriated $725
million for WIC in 1980 and increased the amount by at least $100
million each year.
   That was not always enough to keep up with inflation and has
never been enough to reach all the eligible women and children, but
was consistently higher than the Reagan budget requests, said a
member of the Senate Agriculture committee staff.
   For instance, Reagan proposed cutting the program in 1982 from
the $869 million of the previous year to $637 million. Congress
refused to go along and appropriated $948 million.
   The 1990 appropriation is $2.13 billion, serving about 4.6
million women and children, said Watkins. He said that about
two-thirds of eligible recipients are getting help through the
program.

<TEXT>
   Having a big potbelly is bad for cholesterol, and
this could explain why, when it comes to body shapes, pears are
better than apples, according to a study published today.
   ``When patients come in, we advise them to lose weight,'' said
Dr. Richard E. Ostlund Jr. ``This paper suggests that more
important than that is how the fat is distributed.''
   Researchers have long noticed that folks with big spare tires
tend to have an especially high risk of heart trouble, but the
reason was unclear. Ostlund's study, in New England Journal of
Medicine, suggests that people with beefy hips and trim waists have
higher levels of a protective form of cholesterol called HDL than
do those with potbellies and small behinds.
   The study of healthy elderly people, conducted at Washington
University School of Medicine, found that body shape alone could
account for a large portion of the differences in people's HDL
cholesterol levels.
   ``This may have tremendous importance to the average American,
because we all tend to bulge out in this way,'' said Dr. William
Castelli, director of the long-running Framingham Heart Study in
suburban Boston.
   HDL _ high density lipoprotein _ is the so-called good
cholesterol. The more people have in their blood, the lower their
chances of heart attacks. Women typically have higher HDL levels
than men. As they grow older, women also tend to put on weight
around the hips, while men are more prone to growing big tummies.
   Doctors have long suspected that differences in sex hormones
might explain the HDL disparity between men and women. However, the
new study suggests that body shape, not sex, could be the key
factor. It found that pear-shaped men tend to have high HDL, while
apple-shaped women have lower HDL.
   ``It's not how fat you are; it's where the fat's located,'' said
Ostlund. ``The fat around your hips, the good fat that women have,
is predominantly subcutaneous fat. But the fat you have in your
belly is intra-abdominal fat. The difference is where the blood
supply of those two areas drains.''
   Tummy fat surrounds the intestines, and its blood supply drains
directly to the liver, he said. ``The liver is sensitive to things
that fat cells put out. The metabolism of the liver may be changed
because of the intra-abdominal fat,'' including the liver's
production of HDL.
   The blood from hip fat, which is just underneath the skin, does
not drain directly to the liver and so has less impact on the way
it works, he said.
   The study was conducted on 77 men and 69 women, all in their
70s. To measure whether they were apples or pears, the researchers
calculated the ratio of their waist-to-hip circumference.
   They found that 32 percent of the variation in their HDL levels
could be explained by differences in this ratio.
   ``The bottom line for the middle-aged and elderly is: Don't let
that spare tire get you around the waist,'' said Castelli. ``Get
out and exercise and diet.''
   However, Ostlund said dieting is a hard way to tackle the
problem, since fat patterns may be established at birth.
   ``It's very hard to change your waist-to-hip ratio,'' Ostlund
said. ``You can do it if you lose a massive amount of weight, but
losing 10 to 20 pounds doesn't change it very much.''

<HEAD>Experts Say Government Should Turn Down the Volume</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BETHESDA, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of experts says the government must
do more to turn down the volume in the workplace and on consumer
products to save the hearing of millions of Americans.
   The panel convened by the National Institutes of Health on
Wednesday concluded that better protection for workers, noise
labeling of consumer products, limits on noise levels for some
products and an educational campaign would cut the number of people
with hearing problems.
   Of the 28 million Americans who suffer hearing loss, about 10
million of the impairments were caused at least partly by exposure
to loud noises, the panel said.
   Dr. Patrick E. Brookhouser, panel chairman and director of the
Boys Town National Research Hospital in Omaha, Neb., said although
the United States is the world leader in hearing-loss research,
``the fact that we're not continuing to implement our own
recommendations is a concern to the panel.''
   ``We know how to solve the problem. We just don't want to put in
the effort and expense for it,'' he said.
   ``Unnecessary hearing loss is occurring now because we're not
implementing what we already know are good preventive strategies.''
   Exposure to loud sounds in the workplace is the most common
cause of noise-related hearing loss and poses a danger to
firefighters, police officers, military personnel, construction and
factory workers, musicians, farmers and truck drivers, among
others, the panel said.
   Outside the workplace, hazards include loud music, recreational
vehicles, airplanes, lawn-care equipment, woodworking tools, some
household appliances and chain saws, the panel said.
   Short bursts of loud noise as in an explosion or gunfire can
damage hearing permanently, while longer exposure to less intense
but still loud noise ``exacts a gradual toll on hearing
sensitivity, initially without the victim's awareness,'' the panel
said in a statement.
   Hearing loss is irreversible when the sensitive inner-ear
structure is damaged, said Brookhouser.
   ``One of the problems is that people are losing hearing and they
don't know it because it's not painful,'' he said.
   Exposure to sounds up to 75 decibels _ which is the noise of a
dishwasher or vacuum cleaner _ are generally safe, even over long
periods of exposure, he said.
   However, sounds at levels more than 85 decibels _ which is the
noise level of a lawnmower or food blender _ for eight hours a day
over a long period of time can damage hearing permanently, he said.
The greater the noise, the shorter the period of exposure necessary
to cause permanent damage.
   Two warning signs of dangerous noise exposure are ringing in the
ears and a muffling of sounds that are heard.
   A rock concert delivers about 130 decibels of sound, which can
cause a temporary hearing loss that can take several days or a week
to recover from, Brookhouser said.
   He noted some in the concert industry have begun voluntarily to
lower the volume because they are becoming more aware of the
dangers to hearing.
   Panel members called for more such efforts in the entertainment
field and for manufacturers to design quieter products and
regulations to limit the maximum noise of certain products, such as
portable cassette players.
   The panel also called for re-establishment of the Environmental
Protection Agency's Office of Noise Abatement and Control, which
was closed during the Reagan administration in 1982.
   Julia Doswell Royster, president of Environmental Noise
Consultants Inc. in Cary, N.C., said existing EPA noise rules are
largely unenforced. The Occupational Health and Safety
Administration also has regulations covering workers, but she said
they should be stronger and better enforced.
   EPA spokesman Dave Ryan said the agency has taken no enforcement
actions since the office closed but is conducting five compliance
investigations of makers of hearing protectors.

   Japan's opposition parties remain divided by
distrust and policy disagreements as campaigning starts for next
month's election.
   Despite a long-awaited opportunity presented by the scandals and
the slumping popularity of the Liberal Democratic government,
opposition politicians concede they are far from setting up a
coalition.
   ``At this point, we have to admit it is difficult for us to come
to any sort of agreement on coalition terms before the general
election,'' said Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Japan
Socialist Party, the largest opposition group.
   ``Each party is busy worrying about its own business ahead of
the (Feb. 18) election,'' Yamaguchi said in an interview.
   Socialist chairwoman Takako Doi and the heads of three centrist
parties met Wednesday after the lower house of Parliament was
dissolved for the crucial election. They declared they were united
on three points: To oust the Liberal Democrats, scrap an unpopular
3 percent sales tax and continue coalition talks.
   It was the first time since December the four key opposition
parties had held a joint meeting.
   They started talking about coalition terms in April but have
been unable to overcome such obstacles as the Socialists'
opposition to Japan's armed forces and to the treaty under which
the United States bases about 50,000 troops in Japan and is obliged
to help defend Japan if it is attacked.
   The three other parties hold more conservative views.
   Akira Yamagishi, chairman of the Japanese Trade Union Federation
and a key mediator in the opposition talks, said it was ``quite
regrettable'' that the parties are divided when they have the best
chance in decades to oust the Liberal Democrats.
   ``To me, their policy disagreements sound like no more than
their excuses for not being able to cooperate,'' Yamagishi said.
   The Liberal Democrats have headed Japan's governments since 1955
and the only time the Socialists have been at the top since World
War II was a few months in 1947 and 1948 when they led a coalition.
   The opposition has been out of power ``for so long that they
have lost realistic aspirations to govern the country,'' Yamagishi
said.
   For the Socialists to claim the premiership for Ms. Doi, the
Liberal Democrats would have to lose at least 39 of their 295 seats
in the outgoing house, and the Socialists would have to join other
parties and assemble at least 257 seats, a bare majority in the
512-seat house.
   While polls show the Liberal Democrats could lose their
majority, they seem assured of remaining the largest party, and
there is speculation that they _ not the Socialists _ will entice
the centrists into a coalition.
   Prospects for a Socialist-led coalition of the center-left are
clouded by the Communist Party, which holds 27 seats in the
outgoing house. The Marxist-Leninist party is entirely excluded
from the coalition blueprint because of its revolutionary stances,
but it could emerge with a key block of swing seats.
   The Socialists, holding 83 seats, are more moderate than the
Communists, but there are radical factions within the Socialist
Party which adhere to its traditional stance of making Japan
neutral and unarmed, and calling for socialist revolutions.
   Leaders of centrist parties _ the Democratic Socialist Party (25
lower house seats), the Komeito or Clean Government Party (54
seats) and the United Social Democratic Party (four seats) _ say
the Socialists must modify radical policy stances to be a coalition
partner.
   ``We are talking about forming a government of the second
economic superpower of the world. We'd better be sure who we are
dealing with,'' Takashi Yonezawa, secretary-general of the
Democratic Socialist Party, which parted from the Socialists in the
1960s over policy disagreements, said in an interview.
   The Clean Government Party secretary-general, Yuuichi Ichikawa,
said, ``How can we take over the government when the leader of the
opposition camp is not ready to do so? We just have to wait for the
Socialists to become more realistic.''
   Socialist leader Doi has softened the party's positions, saying
it will acknowledge Japan's armed forces and the security alliance
with the United States.
   ``We have said our party recognizes that Japan is a member of
Western allies,'' she said in an interview last week. ``Seeking
drastic change is not what we want.''
   But Komeito leader Koshiro Ishida and Democratic Socialist
leader Eiichi Nagasue demanded the Socialists put their policy
modifications into their platform.
   Yamaguchi argued it was the centrist parties' turn to concede.
``I think it is important for each party to have its own unique
goals,'' the Socialist secretary-general said. ``As far as policy
modifications are concerned, we did all we can do.''

<HEAD>Grand Jury Indicts Four Suspected IRA Members on Arms Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four suspected members of the Irish
Republican Army are charged by a grand jury with violating the U.S.
Neutrality Act by conspiring to ship weapons, including a Stinger
missile, to Northern Ireland.
   The five-count federal indictment Wednesday also accused the men
of violating the U.S. Arms Export Control Act, which requires arms
dealers to get permission from the State Department before shipping
weapons overseas.
   Department policy is to deny permission when the weapons are
intended for use ``in connection with the sectarian conflict in
Northern Ireland,'' the indictment said. ``This is in keeping with
United States policy to encourage peaceful reconciliation in
Northern Ireland.''
   Other weapons the indictment accuses the men of conspiring to
ship to Northern Ireland include rifles, grenade launchers and
plastic explosives.
   Indictment are Kevin Joseph McKinley, 33, of Riviera Beach; Sean
McCann, 34, of Toronto; Seamus Anthony Moley, 30, of Canada; and
Joseph Martin McColgan, 39, of Dundalk, Northern Ireland. Each
faces a maximum penalty of 38 years in prison.
   U.S. Magistrate Ann Vitunac ordered the men held until trial.
Arraignment is set for Friday.
   Arms dealers are required to be licensed by the U.S. Office of
Munitions Control before shipping weapons abroad. Exporters must
tell the federal agency what weapons they wish to ship and to whom,
the indictment states.
   ``At no time did (the defendants) apply for, receive or possess
a license to export defense articles of any description,'' the
indictment charges.
   The indictment details a series of meetings between the men and
two undercover agents from the U.S. Customs Service and the Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The meetings culminated at a West Palm Beach warehouse Jan. 12,
when the two undercover agents allowed McColgan to inspect the
Stinger missile and place it in the back seat of his car, agents
said. The four men were arrested soon after the missile was
delivered.

<HEAD>Heart Association to Proceed With Labeling Despite FDA Disapproval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration took a
last-minute stand against a plan to label foods deemed safe by the
American Heart Association, but the organization says it will go
ahead anyway.
   The program, known as Heartguide, is scheduled to begin Monday.
It's an ambitious effort by the association to make consumers
smarter shoppers by identifying products low in saturated fat,
total fat, cholesterol and sodium.
   The program has been in the works for three years, but Acting
FDA Commissioner James S. Benson told the association Wednesday it
risked regulatory action if it proceeded with the plan.
   ``FDA believes that your program will increase consumer
confusion and hamper any comprehensive solution to the food
labeling program,'' Benson wrote to the group.
   The association decided to proceed.
   ``We've already talked to the companies'' participating in the
program, and ``they are in,'' said a Heartguide spokeswoman, Jamy
Poth.
   Products tested and approved by the association would, for a
fee, carry a symbol made up of a red heart and a check mark.
   Discussions have been held with the FDA throughout the past
year, said Vicki Anderson, another spokeswoman for Heartguide, and
the heart association was distressed with the last-minute letter.
   But an FDA spokesman said the agency has expressed concerns to
the association during the past year.
   ``I would think they would have been aware of them,'' said the
spokesman, Jeff Nesbit.
   In the wake of the letter, the second phase of the program _ in
which cereals, cheese, cookies, pasta, salad dressings and other
foods will be included _ has been put on hold to allow time for
further negotiations with the FDA, Anderson said.
   The FDA has no authority to act before products are sold, Nesbit
said. Once they are on supermarket shelves, however, the agency
determines whether labels are misleading.
   If it determined that the association's seal of approval was
misleading, it could order that the symbol be removed. Or it could
seek a court order to block the sale of products with the symbol,
or seize them, Nesbit said.
   The program has been criticized on the grounds that competitive
pressures would force companies to participate, and that it
promotes certain foods instead of promoting the idea of a healthy
overall diet.
   The association said its educational program will make clear
that Heartguide-approved foods should be incorporated into a diet
that is beneficial overall.
   The fees paid to the association _ up to $640,000, depending
upon a product's sales _ also have been criticized.
   ``What we see here is a realization by the government agencies
that you have a non-profit, private organization, a non-regulated
organization, trying to establish a set of rules and regulations on
labeling _ for a fee. I think that's wrong,'' said John Cady,
president of the National Food Processors Association, which has
vigorously opposed the program.
   More than 100 brands of margarine, oil, crackers and vegetables
already have been tested and approved. They include Mazola corn
oil, Promise margarine, Pam cooking sprays, Melba Toast, and
Hanover frozen vegetables.
   None of the labeled products is currently available on the
shelves. Anderson said manufacturers had begun printing containers
with the labels, but that products were not yet ready for shipment
to supermarkets.
   The makers of Mazola products had not yet decided how to react
to the FDA's action, said Gail Griffin, spokeswoman for CPC
International of Englewood Cliffs, N.J. That is the parent company
of Best Foods, which makes Mazola.
   The FDA's letter was addressed to heart association President
Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
   Benson urged the heart association ``instead to join with the
FDA and other groups in our current initiative to develop a
comprehensive revision of the food label to promote good
nutrition.''

<HEAD>Groups Ask for Phaseout of Standardized Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When A. Graham Down taught American history in
college he would ask his students such questions as ``How `new' was
the New Deal?'' or ``Should President Truman have dropped the
bomb?''
   Down says such broad questions, aimed at showing the depth of
students' understanding of subjects, should replace the
standardized, multiple-choice questions that are now used to assess
what students know.
   ``There is no right answer and that understanding of ambiguity
is surely the most important source of inspiration that informs
citizenry of a real Democracy,'' Down said Wednesday in leading a
call for reform of the widely-used standardized tests.
   Down, head of the Council for Basic Education, joined leaders of
more than three dozen national education, parent, and civil rights
organizations to urge President Bush and the nation's governors to
move toward assessments based on actual student performance.
   The groups' ``Statement on Genuine Accountability'' comes as the
administration and governors move towards setting up national
educational goals promised during an education summit last year.
One of the key issues is how to judge student performance.
   ``The testing craze has damaged the quality of our schools,''
said Monte Neill, associate director of FairTest of Cambridge,
Mass., which is spearheading the effort for reform.
   ``Low-income and minority-group children have been particularly
harmed. Teaching the narrow content included in multiple-choice
tests has prevented students from learning higher order thinking
skills,'' he said.
   The statement was signed by the leaders of 49 organizations,
including the American Federation of Teachers, the Asian Law
Alliance, Council for Basic Education, the Institute for Learning
and Teaching, National Indian Youth Council Inc., National Parent
Teacher Association, Federation of Organizations for Professional
Women, National Association for the Education of Young Children,
NAACP and the National Association of Elementary School Principals.
   Absent from the list were the National Education Association and
the National Association of Secondary School Principals.
   Gregory Anrig, president of the Educational Testing Service, the
Princeton, N.J., group that produces several standardized exams for
college-bound students, said he disagrees with the ``blanket
rejection of multiple-choice tests.''
   ``They remain a valid, efficient and inexpensive means to
measure certain important aspects of student achievement,'' he said
in a statement.
   ``To simply call for abandonment of a proven and economical
method of measurement is to go forth with one of education's hands
tied behind its back, and impede the timely progress that all
Americans desire for our schools,'' he said.
   But NAACP education director Beverly Cole said, ``America needs
measures of educational performance which provide a level playing
field for all students. Standardized exams, with their
well-documented biases and flaws, fail this basic test.''
   Barbara Willer of the National Association for the Education of
Young Children said better alternatives to standardized tests
include teacher observation, portfolios of student work, and
performances and exhibitions that are based on the curriculum.
   ``Too many young children today are retained a grade, assigned
to special classes, or held out of school based on the results of
readiness and achievement tests that have questionable predictive
accuracy.''

<HEAD>Barry Absent as Mayors Begin Meeting Opens With Drug Task Force</HEAD>

   Mayors attending the meeting of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors say the absence of their host shows how far
the ravages of drug abuse have reached.
   ``It epitomizes, it symbolizes, the extent of the drug problem
in this country,'' Boston Mayor Raymond Flynn said when asked by
reporters about Washington Mayor Marion Barry.
   Barry was in a Florida treatment center, where he had himself
admitted following his arrest last week on a charge of possessing
crack cocaine.
   Despite the national attention that's been riveted on Barry's
case in the past week, no mayor mentioned their absent host
publicly in the 1{-hour strategy session Wednesday of the mayors'
drug task force.
   Nonetheless, Barry's case dominated the talk outside the meeting
room as the nation's big-city mayors opened their three-day annual
winter meeting.
   ``It was a tragedy for the mayor, and it was a tragedy for the
District of Columbia,'' said Philadelphia Mayor Wilson Goode. ``I
don't see how it has any impact on what we do here.''
   Houston Mayor Kathryn Whitmire, president of the Conference of
Mayors, avoided mention of Barry's arrest in a speech across town
to the National Press Club.
   But when asked about it, she said Barry's arrest underscored the
need for the federal government to spend more on drug treatment to
make it available for those who need it. So long as there is a
demand for drugs, she said, no law enforcement effort will stop
dealers from meeting that demand.
   ``As we see him moving to get treatment for himself, we are
caused to realize once again how important it is that treatment be
available not only to those in high places, but to everyone who
needs it,'' Whitmire said.
   She and other mayors shied away from saying whether they
believed Barry should resign from office because of the cocaine
arrest.
   ``I'm not going to try to give any political advice to any other
mayors,'' she said.
   Flynn declined to say whether Barry should resign but said ``I'd
like to see an acknowledgement of Marion Barry's problem'' by the
mayor. He said if Barry is cured of a substance dependence problem,
he should spend ``the rest of his life as an example'' to young
people about the problems of drugs.
   Barry's appointed drug czar for the city, Sterling Tucker, sat
in Barry's chair at the drug task force meeting.
   ``Even before I came to the job I was aware there were these
allegations here (about drug use by Barry),'' Tucker said when
questioned by a reporter.
   ``We've been faced with this all along. ... There's been no
major interruption for me. We haven't missed a beat.''
   Barry is also chairman of the mayors' transportation committee.
Conference spokesman Mike Brown said another mayor would fill in
for Barry when that panel meets.
   The mayors are awaiting President Bush's latest plans for
federal anti-drug efforts and an appearance by Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.
   Bush plans to address the mayors _ most of whom are Democrats _
on Friday. It will be the first time since Jimmy Carter in 1980
that a sitting president has spoken to the organization of big-city
mayors.
   Several black mayors interviewed said they did not see Barry's
case as a particular embarrassment for black officeholders or one
that makes their anti-drug efforts more difficult.
   ``It only proves mayors are human,'' said Mayor John Daniels of
New Haven, Conn.
   Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, N.J., said he did not embrace the
suggestion of NAACP Executive Director Benjamin Hooks that the
arrest was part of a pattern of harassment of black elected
officials and a ``rising tide of racism.'' But he noted the FBI has
faced charges of minority harassment and said racism would be a
factor in law enforcement ``until we rule out racism in our
country.''
   Mayor Cardell Cooper of East Orange, N.J., said: ``I do believe
black leadership has come under, certainly, scrutiny. ... I don't
know if you'd call it undue or not.'' He said Barry ``might have
put himself in position to invite'' attention and scrutiny.

   The Brady family of television's yesteryear is
returning once again as a weekly series.
   Starting Feb. 16, one-hour ``The Bradys'' will be broadcast
Fridays on CBS at 8 p.m. EST, the network announced Wednesday.
   The clan's arrival will bump the new ``Max Monroe: Loose
Cannon'' series from the time slot. CBS said that series will have
its last Friday broadcast on Jan. 26, and return later on a night
to be announced.
   The Bradys first appeared on TV in 1969 in ABC's sitcom ``The
Brady Bunch.'' That was followed by a comedy-variety series, ``The
Brady Bunch Hour,'' dropped by ABC in 1977 after five months.
   But members of the clan were not to be denied. They returned, if
only briefly, in 1981, in an NBC spin-off sitcom, ``The Brady
Brides.''

<HEAD>GOP House Members Oppose Dole Foreign Aid Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Bob Dole's proposal to boost aid to
Eastern Europe and Panama by cutting funds from major recipients
like Israel and Egypt is ``shortsighted and detrimental'' to U.S.
interests, 22 Republican House members say.
   The House members wrote to President Bush on Wednesday to
express ``our strong opposition to the Dole foreign aid plan,''
which would slice money from Israel, Egypt, Turkey, the Philippines
and Pakistan.
   ``We believe this is the wrong approach to the burgeoning needs
of Eastern Europe,'' said the House members, led by Reps. Vin Weber
of Minnesota and Bill McCollum of Florida.
   ``To reward one ally at the expense of another would be
shortsighted and detrimental to American interests,'' they said.
   At the same time, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, Dole's Republican
colleague from Kansas, said she supported Dole and hoped his plan
would lead to ``serious review and substantive reform'' of foreign
aid.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has not taken a
stand on the issue, but he is holding meetings with Democratic
colleagues to discuss foreign aid, his aides said.
   Kassebaum, who has introduced legislation to change the way
foreign aid is divided up, criticized Congress for ``earmarking'' _
locking up _ 80 percent of the foreign aid budget.
   As a result, U.S. officials have no flexibility to deal with
unforeseen circumstances, she said in a speech on the Senate floor.
   ``With earmarking, we have set up a system that prevents us from
responding to opportunities'' like those in Eastern Europe, she
said.
   Dole suggested changing the 1990 foreign aid budget that
earmarks about $3 billion to Israel, slightly less to Egypt, about
$500 million each to Turkey and Pakistan and some $160 million in
economic aid to the Philippines.
   His plan would trim 5 percent from the big recipients, creating
about $400 million that could go to Eastern Europe and Panama.
   Many have criticized Dole's plan.
   ``It's not going anywhere. Period,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin,
D-Iowa, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Debate on the 1991 foreign aid bill is expected to start soon,
once the Bush administration unveils its requests next week.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations, has said his panel will hold
hearings ``reexamining U.S. foreign aid priorities in light of the
vast changes in the international situation.''
   ``As far as I'm concerned, every program in the fiscal 1991
foreign aid appropriation will be reviewed,'' Leahy said in a
statement.
   On Jan. 18, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin met with Bush
administration officials and later said he had ``reasons to
believe'' U.S. aid to his country would hold steady at $3 billion a
year through 1991. But he expressed concern about aid beyond next
year.

<HEAD>Post: Donation Came After Congressman Changed Position on South
Africa</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scholarship program backed by Rep. Mervyn M.
Dymally received a $34,200 donation from a New York diamond
importer two months after Dymally softened his opposition to U.S.
imports of South African diamonds, The Washington Post reported
today.
   The paper said the California Democrat later agreed to lobby his
colleagues to support other changes that Maurice Tempelsman,
chairman of the board of Lazare Kaplan International Inc., wanted
in a sanctions bill which eventually failed to pass the Senate.
   LKI, which last year had gross sales of $80 million, buys
diamonds from South Africa and other countries, many of them
through the London DeBeers syndicate, which does not distinguish
the countries of origin of its diamonds.
   Dymally, who the newspaper said declined to be interviewed, told
the newspaper in a one-page statement that he did not ``solicit
contributions from Mr. Tempelsman.''
   Tempelsman was quoted as saying ``at no time did (Dymally) hint
that a contribution from me to the foundation would affect his
position on the diamond sanctions.''
   ``I do not make charitable contributions merely because a
congressman so suggests and would not under any circumstances
consider making one in the hope of influencing his vote,''
Tempelsman said in a written response to questions. ``No vote, no
bill, no threat to my business could ever induce me to do that.''
   The $34,200 was donated to the Ana G. Mendez Foundation and used
to finance the 1988 Mervyn M. Dymally Young Minority Scholars
Program that sent 14 students from Dymally's district to Puerto
Rico for four weeks of study, according to foundation President
Jose Mendez.
   That amount was suggested to Tempelsman in a prospectus sent to
him by Amelia Parker, a Dymally aide, the newspaper said.
   A foundation document, according to the newspaper, noted that
part of the $34,200 was set aside to pay honoraria. Dymally
reported a $2,000 honorarium from the Mendez foundation in July
1988.
   The Post said that, other than the honoraria, there is no
indication that Dymally personally benefited from the Tempelsman
donation.
   Tempelsman made a second donation of $25,000 in 1989.
   According to House rules, members may not accept from a person
with a direct interest in legislation ``favors or benefits ...
under circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons
as influencing the performance of governmental duties.''
   In February 1987, Dymally introduced legislation to ban U.S.
imports of South African diamonds.
   Accepting arguments that his initial bill was unworkable, unfair
to Zimbabwe and without committee support, he proposed changes in
April 1988 to pending sanction legislation to weaken its impact on
U.S. diamond importers.
   The Post reported that Dymally's change of heart came after a
meeting with Tempelsman. Howard Marlowe, a lobbyist for Tempelsman,
said he drafted an amendment for Dymally incorporating the changes
that the Foreign Affairs Committee accepted. The House later went
along, but the Senate refused.
   Tempelsman is a prominent New Yorker who is a frequent escort of
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

   It took patience _ and some laxative _ to
recover a stolen $18,000 diamond ring that the suspect had
swallowed.
   ``I'm glad that's out now,'' said Michael J. Weatherspoon.
   Weatherspoon, 23, of St. Paul, was arrested Jan. 17 after he
took a 2{-carat diamond ring from a store manager at the National
Jewelry Co., police said.
   He was chased down and wrestled to the ground by a passerby, but
no ring was found, police said.
   Police obtained a search warrant authorizing ``proper medical
techniques, excluding surgery,'' to recover the ring.
   Sgt. Richard Nelson spent the next day in the jail with
Weatherspoon and some laxative.
   ``It took six hours,'' Nelson said.
   Nelson put the ring in a plastic bag and took it back to the
store.
   Weatherspoon was being held on $10,000 bail on a theft charge.

<TEXT>
   Charles Rothenberg began his parole in
a secret location wired with an electronic leash, while the son he
set afire seven years ago says he won't feel safe until the day his
father dies.
   Rothenberg left prison early Wednesday, beginning three years'
probation, said Tipton Kindel, spokesman for the state Department
of Corrections in Sacramento.
   At a news conference later, 13-year-old David Rothenberg told
reporters he fears his father will try to see him again.
   ``I know that he'll try,'' said the boy, who was severely
scarred by his father's arson attack seven years ago. ``If he tries
to hurt me I'll do something in self-protection.''
   David said he still keeps a BB gun by his bed just in case.
   ``I would like them to keep him in jail for the rest of his
life,'' said David, who was 6 when his father set him on fire in an
Orange County motel room.
   The boy said he could never forgive his father.
   ``If he wants forgiveness, why did he do this?'' David asked.
``He says he's sorry but he's just saying that stuff just to get
near me.''
   ``He doesn't love me. If he loved me he wouldn't do this to me.''
   ``It was cruel,'' he added.
   Asked when he thought he would feel safe, he responded
unhesitatingly: ``When Charles dies.''
   ``I want it known nationally that I don't ever want to see my
father again. I want to make it clear to him,'' said David, who
appeared at the news conference wearing a Los Angeles Raiders ball
cap.
   David lives in Orange County with his mother, Marie, and
stepfather, Buena Park police Lt. Richard Hafdahl, who helped
investigate the case.
   Kindel said a parole officer will accompany Rothenberg at all
times and the family would be notified if Rothenberg ever leaves
his restricted area. The parole will cost California taxpayers
$18,000 a month.
   Rothenberg set fire to his son in a motel room in 1983 after a
telephone argument in which his estranged wife said Rothenberg
would not be allowed to see the boy again. Rothenberg had taken the
boy on a holiday to Southern California from New York, where the
boy was living with his mother.
   David, dragged from the inferno by motel guests, suffered
third-degree burns over 90 percent of his body. He still bears
scars on his hands, face and legs from the burning and repeated
skin grafts.
   Rothenberg was convicted of attempted murder, arson and other
charges and received the maximum penalty, a 13-year prison term.
The sentence was cut in half because of good behavior in prison.
   If convicted today, Rothenberg would have faced up to life in
prison. But sentencing laws at the time required his release within

<HEAD>Meeting on Boat People Ends With No Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Vietnamese delegates to a conference on
boat people refused to accept a compromise starting date for the
forced repatriation of Vietnamese denied refugee status, and the
30-nation talks broke up in disarray.
   At stake is the future of tens of thousands of Vietnamese boat
people waiting in camps in Hong Kong.
   The United States had opposed the mandatory repatriation of
Vietnamese deemed to be economic migrants rather than refugees
fleeing persecution, but last week softened its stance and
advocated slow movement on the issue.
   Britain wanted deportations to begin at once _ before the
sailing season starts in March _ to deter a further influx of boat
people into the overflowing camps of Hong Kong, a British crown
colony.
   The Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
had tried to bridge the gap by suggesting a six-month delay in the
repatriation process. But U.S. delegates told the closed,
U.N.-sponsored meeting the proposed July 1 date was too early and
said no one should have to return to Vietnam before Jan. 1, 1991,
officials said.
   After the talks ended Wednesday, chief British delegate Robin
McLaren expressed disappointment at the failure to reach an
agreement that would have enabled UNHCR to monitor people sent back
to Vietnam.
   He said Britain now will have to consider whether to go ahead
and return more boat people against their will. Under a deal with
Hanoi, Britain forcibly sent back 51 boat people from the
overcrowded Hong Kong camps last month.
   McLaren, speaking to journalists after the meeting, said
Vietnamese officials told delegates any internationally-agreed
program of forced repatriations should not begin before Oct. 1.
   Vietnam says it needs time to prepare for any mass return of
boat people so they can be absorbed into Vietnam's stricken economy.
   McLaren noted, however, that for the first time there was
consensus that boat people deemed to have fled for economic reasons
rather than political persecution should be returned even against
their will.
   Sergio Vieira de Mello, a senior UNHCR official who presided
over the two-day meeting in Geneva, said Norway's Thorwald
Stoltenberg, the new High Commissioner for Refugees, was asked to
see if a consensus could be reached. He will negotiate directly
with relevant capitals.
   Vieira de Mello said there were no immediate plans for another
international conference. U.S. and Vietnamese delegates declined
comment after the meeting.
   Earlier, Hong Kong security chief Geoffrey Barnes warned that if
no agreement emerged, pressure would grow in Hong Kong to push
boats of asylum seekers back out to sea.
   He said Hong Kong could not cope with another influx of 35,000
boat people, the number that flooded into the colony in 1989.
   About 109,000 boat people are in camps in Southeast Asia,
including 56,000 in Hong Kong, according to UNHCR figures. The
44,000 boat people who arrived in Hong Kong after June 1988 may be
screened to determine if they class as genuine political refugees.
Arrivals before June 1988 were granted refugee status without
screening.
   UNHCR spokesman Raymond Hall said about 7,000 people have so far
been screened in Hong Kong and only 15 percent were accepted as
genuine refugees.
   He said 1,100 people have returned voluntarily since March and a
further 1,400 are registered to go back. All voluntary returnees
receive $50 from the refugee agency and qualify for a year's food
aid from Hanoi.

<HEAD>10 Killed When Farm Labor Van Runs into Canal in Fog</HEAD>

   The driver of a panel van carrying
Mexican farm workers escaped but 10 others died after the vehicle
plummeted over a curve and into a fog-shrouded canal, authorities
said.
   No charges were filed by early today, but authorities said the
driver, Rentilio Escobedo, 28, remained under investigation. Fines
were possible, too, if the vehicle is found unsuitable for
transporting laborers.
   ``It's like something out of a scary movie,'' said Fernando
Lupo, a migrant worker in La Belle, where most of the victims
lived. ``I cannot think of a worse way to die.''
   The 1979 van apparently was en route to citrus groves when
Escobedo failed to make a sharp curve in the dense fog and plowed
into the 12-foot-deep canal, surrounded by sugar cane fields about
100 miles north of Miami.
   Escobedo apparently escaped out the driver's side door, but his
wife, Manuela, died in the passenger seat. His 50-year-old uncle,
Nicolas Escobedo, managed to squeeze out the rear doors, police
said. Neither man was seriously injured.
   The van was submerged about 15 minutes before rescuers received
word Wednesday morning, police said.
   ``Some of them had stuck their arms out trying to get out, but
they just didn't make it,'' said sheriff's Lt. Bill Chamness.
``When the deputies dove in to get them, they were already dead.''
   The bodies of the nine men and one woman, ranging from age 16 to
37, were taken to Fort Myers for autopsies. Police withheld their
names early today pending notification of relatives in Mexico.
   Police initially speculated the accident occurred because of the
fog, but the driver told investigators he lost control because the
steering failed, said Florida Highway Patrol Maj. Mike Kirby in
Tallahassee.
   ``It happened very fast. We were on the road, and then the next
I knew we were under water,'' said the driver's uncle.
   The van was pulled out of the 50-foot-wide canal and has been
impounded for the investigation.

   Moslem militants fighting for Kashmir's
secession from India opened fire today on air force officers,
killing at least four, police said.
   The killings raised to at least 61 the number of people killed
in Kashmir since Saturday, when the lingering Moslem movement for
secession from Hindu-majority India flared.
   Most of the killings have occured in confrontations between
troops enforcing an around-the-clock curfew and mobs of militants
defying the curfew.
   ``The attack makes it clear that the terrorists want to make
targets of anyone who is associated with the Indian government,''
said a police official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The air force officers were waiting for a bus to take them to
the Srinagar airport when they were attacked by assailants who
drove up in a car, the police official said.
   Three of the officers were killed on the spot in repeated bursts
of fire from automatic rifles and at least four others were
wounded, two of them seriously, he said. One of the wounded died at
a hospital.
   A woman and a child walking by were also hurt, the official
said. Witnesses said they saw at least five bodies being carried
away after the shooting.
   Hundreds of troops and paramilitary police have been deployed to
halt the violence in Srinagar, famous for its lakes and tourist
resorts.
   Troops and the militants exchanged gunfire at four places in the
city during a four-hour curfew relaxation which began at 5 a.m.
today, police said. No deaths were reported although one
para-military policeman was wounded, police said.
   Under the curfew imposed Saturday, people have been ordered to
stay indoors except for brief periods when the ban is lifted to
enable people to shop.
   Islamic militants are demanding either independence for
predominantly Moslem Kashmir or union with neighboring Islamic
Pakistan. Kashmir forms the northern part of Jammu-Kashmir state
and Srinagar is the summer capital.
   The Jammu region, which lies south of Kashmir, is predominantly
Hindu.
   Claimed by India and Pakistan, Kashmir was divided into Indian
and Pakistani sectors by a cease-fire line that is monitored by
U.N. military observers.
   The dispute over the territory, which has led to two wars, began
after India and Pakistan were partitioned on gaining independence
from Britain in 1947.
   India has often accused Pakistan of aiding Kashmiri militants,
and Pakistan has routinely denied the charge.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 5 million people are
Moslems. Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of India's 880
million people and Hindus make up 82 percent.

   Czechoslovakia's communist rulers committed
three major errors contributing to their overthrow last month, says
the spokesman of the new citizens' movement.
   The first ``bad mistake by the communists'' came soon after they
took power after the 1968 Soviet invasion, and ordered ``the
country's best people to do nothing,'' by purging reform communists
and other educated people from their normal jobs, said Civic Forum
leader Martin Palous.
   Another mistake was when the communist rulers ``failed to
completely destroy'' Charter 77, an organization of dissidents
formed in 1977, he added during a Wednesday gathering at the
Capitol.
   Hundreds of thousands of victims of the 1969-70 purge had to
support themselves as night watchmen, furnace stokers and other
manual labor, ``giving them time to study and read and prepare a
good organization for humane society,'' according to Palous, who
said he stoked furnaces for five years after being sacked from his
academic post.
   People of diverse thinking such as ex-communists, Catholics,
Evangelists and socialists got to know each other for the first
time in Charter 77, even becoming friends, and turning into an
underground network, he added.
   After those two mistakes on the side of leniency, the hardline
government committed an error on the side of harshness that
outraged the nation and overnight provided massive new backing for
the underground, Palous continued. This was the crackdown in Prague
last Nov. 17 in which police beat peaceful student demonstrators.
   ``It unified their parents, even those not involved in dissident
activities, and got all sorts of people involved in a great
national movement that proved to be so strong as to change the
government in a few days,'' said Palous.
   Palous and Ivan Havel, brother and adviser to dissident
playwright Vaclav Havel, the new non-communist president elected
last month, U.S. Prague Ambassador Shirley Temple Black, the former
child movie star, and East European specialists experts attended
the Capitol meeting sponsored by the Center for National Policy, a
private, nonpartisan research group.
   Palous and Havel are an advance team for a government delegation
expected here in late February after U.S. Secretary of State James
A. Baker III's planned talks in Prague.

   A new military navigation satellite
is orbiting the Earth as part of a network of spacecraft that guide
bombers, warships, missiles and ground troops with precision
accuracy.
   An Air Force Delta rocket boosted the $65 million Navstar
satellite into space Wednesday night and officials reported 25
minutes later that it was in a successful orbit ranging out to
11,000 miles high.
   ``Everything appears to have gone well with tonight's launch,''
reported Capt. Ken Warren, the Air Force launch commentator.
   It is the sixth in a series of advanced Navstar satellites
launched during the past year from Cape Canaveral. By 1992, the Air
Force plans to have 21 orbiting the Earth to form a global system.
   Coded satellite signals guide U.S. and allied military units
such as ships, planes, submarines, tanks and land forces with
pinpoint accuracy in any weather.
   Civilian users such as planes and ships also have access to the
Navstar system through an open channel that gives them accuracies
within 300 feet.

<TEXT>
   The alleged leader of Colombia's
second-largest cocaine cartel has offered to turn himself in, just
as the government weighs how to respond to a similar peace offer
fromthe boss of the No. 1 cartel.
   The latest offer from the traffickers in Colombia's
five-month-old drug war came from Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, the
reputed chief of the Cali cartel.
   It came as Colombia's Supreme Court upheld a presidential decree
allowing the government to seize the wealth of suspected
traffickers.
   In a letter to the owners of the Bogota daily El Tiempo,
published as a front-page story Wednesday, Rodriguez said he would
be prepared to face an extradition request from the United States
but that the merits of the U.S. request would have to be judged
under Colombian law.
   That presumably means Rodriguez does not accept the validity of
a decree by President Virgilio Barco allowing extraditions, and is
hoping the extradition request would be acted upon by a Colombian
judge.
   In the last five months, the 13 Colombians extradited to the
United States were sent without judicial review, something feared
by the traffickers.
   Colombia signed an extradition treaty 10 years ago because it is
generally regarded as impossible to find a Colombian judge who
would handle such an extradition.
   It is common knowledge in Colombia that judges are often bribed
or threatened into making decisions favorable to drug traffickers.
Four judges have been killed by traffickers since the drug
crackdown began Aug. 18.
   Earlier this month, the Medellin cartel, the country's largest,
said it was willing to stop its cocaine business, give up hostages
it had kidnapped the last two months and stop all terrorism.
   The communique did not specify what the traffickers wanted in
return, but it appeared they were asking for assurances they would
not be extradited to the United States.
   Barco has sent confusing signals to the public in responding to
the communique. On the one hand he has said the government position
would not change, but he also has said the government is not
inflexible, suggesting there could be some settlement.
   Medellin cartel chief Pablo Escobar, who earlier this week sent
a letter to El Tiempo, and Cali cartel leader Rodriguez have denied
they are behind any terrorism in the drug war.
   Drug traffickers have been blamed for 262 bombings and other
terrorist acts that have claimed 209 deaths since the mid-August
crackdown.
   Those casaulties include all 106 persons aboard a Colombian
airliner that was bombed out of the sky near Bogota.
   Since the crackdown began, security forces have seized millions
of dollars worth of mansions, ranches, office buildings, planes,
yachts, cars, jewels and money belonging to suspected traffickers.

   An advertiser threatened to prosecute a paint
brush-wielding ``magician'' who made three inner-city ads for booze
and cigarettes disappear under a coat of white paint.
   The whitewasher, who uses the pseudonym Mandrake after a comic
strip magician and described himself as a 54-year-old black
professional, said he was conducting a one-man civil disobedience
campaign to erase a ``blight on the community.''
   ``I have seen over the past two years a disproportionate amount
of advertising in the black and Hispanic community,'' said
Mandrake, in a telephone interview in which he refused to give his
real name. ``I believe it was time for us to stand up and fight
back.''
   Tobacco and liquor producers were alarmed by the actions of
Mandrake, whose painting of three South Side billboards in broad
daylight last week followed a much-publicized outcry over a tobacco
company's plan to target blacks in marketing a new brand of
cigarettes.
   ``He's obviously vandalizing private property,'' said Geoff
Obrzut, a spokesman for Patrick Media, whose billboard was covered.
   A police report was filed, Obrzut said, and ``we would be
willing to prosecute if he's caught.''
   ``I'm a firm believer in the Constitution and believe the law
was broken,'' Mandrake conceded. ``But at the same time, there is a
moral obligation, a right, that must be addressed.''
   Gary Miller, a spokesman for the American Tobacco Institute in
Washington, D.C., said billboards had no effect on young people,
who as a group become smokers primarily because of peer pressures
and parental influence.
   Janet Flynn of the Distilled Spirits Council of the United
States, echoed Miller's remarks: ``We restrict our advertising to
responsible adult customers.''
   A lively debate over the ethics of aiming tobacco and alcohol
ads at minorities came to a head last week when U.S. Health and
Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan attacked an R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. plan to test-market a new cigarette, Uptown, in
Philadelphia starting Feb. 5.
   While cigarette advertising already is targeted at minorities,
Uptown apparently was the first brand to be created, named and
marketed specifically for blacks.
   Reynolds shelved its plans, but Sullivan said he would continue
to campaign against such marketing, including products aimed at
women.
   Consumer groups, alarmed at the high rates of smoking and
drinking-related illnesses among inner-city minorities, say the
producers have an obligation not to aim dangerous products at these
groups.
   Industry representatives say their advertising strategies are
protected by the First Amendment and contend that people make their
own decision about whether to light up or take a drink.
   The lung cancer rate has increased four times faster among
blacks than among whites during the past 30 years, according to
reports from the American Lung Association and the National Cancer
Institute.
   A 1987 study by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
Washington-based health advocacy group, found that black men have a
70 percent higher death rate from cirrhosis of liver than whites.
   The group contends that children are being encouraged by the
billboard ads.
   ``Children on the way to school and back home or even at recess
get the message that the way to be happy, glamorous, or athletic is
to smoke and-or drink,'' one publication by the center said.
   Obrzut said that while 50 percent of billboard advertising does
occur in the inner city, only 16 percent of the city's 2,500 ads
are alcohol- or tobacco-related.
   State Sen. Miguel Del Valle of Chicago has proposed legislation
to ban the alcohol and cigarette ads within about two blocks of
schools. That and even stronger measures are to be reviewed by a
governor's task force.

   Czechoslovakia's foreign minister promised that
the country will end its profitable arms exports immediately.
   ``Weapons just won't be sold anymore,'' Foreign Minister Jiri
Dienstbier said in an interview published in The New York Times
today.
   Czechoslovakia's arms industries ranked seventh in total exports
from 1984 through 1988, according to the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute.
   ``Czechoslovakia will simply end its trade in arms without
taking into account what the pragmatists will say: that it will be
a blow to the state coffers, that those people will get arms from
somebody else anyway if we don't supply them,'' Dienstbier said.
   Britain and other countries have charged that terrorist groups
have obtained Czechoslovak-made explosives such as Semtex, which
British authorities say was used in the bombing of Pan Am Flight
103 over Scotland in 1988.
   Dienstbier, a former dissident who two months ago was shoveling
coal in a menial boiler-room job as punishment, also said
negotiations with Moscow to remove Soviet troops from
Czechoslovakia were being complicated by the civil unrest in Soviet
Azerbaijan.

<HEAD>Five Officers Indicted in Separate Drug Cases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A police chief and two officers were among seven
men charged with ripping off drug dealers for more than $1 million
in cash, 110 pounds of cocaine and a ton of marijuana, authorities
said.
   Two other Metro-Dade officers were charged separately with
cocaine violations Wednesday.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said the indictments sent a
message that officials in south Florida were determined to root out
corrupt officers, no matter what their rank.
   ``Instead of a black mark on the Metro-Dade Police Department,''
Lehtinen said, ``it is an example of how police can uncover corrupt
officers.''
   The three officers and a former officer in the first case
pleaded innocent Wednesday before a federal magistrate and were
released on bond. The three others charged in that case were
ordered to appear for arraignment on Feb. 5.
   Defendants in the case, including a district police chief,
ripped off drug dealers of cash, cocaine and marijuana from 1981 to
1987, Lehtinen said. The defendants protected their racket by
getting honest officers transferred to other assignments, he said.
   ``They would come into the possession of information about where
drug dealers were, where illegal drugs were, and should have
engaged in proper law enforcement activities,'' Lehtinen said.
``Instead they would steal the drugs, engage in what in the street
might be called a ripoff and subsequently resell those drugs.''
   Those indicted included Maj. Roberto Gonzalez, 40, Chief of
Metro-Dade's Central Division; his 43-year-old brother, Detective
Jose Gonzalez; Detective Mario Beovides, 41; and businessmen Jorge
Luis Fonte, 38; Thomas Rivera, 33; and Manuel Rodriguez, 57.
   Fonte is a former Nevada narcotics officer who served as a
Broward Sheriff's Office deputy between 1973 and 1978. He now is
co-owner of a Miami automotive business.
   Former police officer Ernesto Sanchoyerto, currently serving a
17-year federal prison sentence for stealing drugs, also was named
in the indictment, and if convicted faces another 50 years in jail.
   If convicted, maximum sentences faced by the other defendants
range from 30 years to life in prison and fines ranging from
$250,000 to $4.5 million.
   In the second indictment, Metro-Dade patrolman Edward Orrett was
charged with conspiracy and intent to distribute cocaine. Orrett's
bond was set at $50,000, and arraignment was scheduled for Feb. 5.
   Orrett's brother, Detective Charles Orrett, who was charged with
attempting to possess more than 10 pounds of cocaine, will be
allowed to surrender.

   Chinese students in exile concede that
the bill before the Senate today to decide their future in the
United States was largely symbolic, but said it provided added
protection from deportation.
   They watched Wednesday as the House voted 390-25 to override
President Bush's Nov. 30 veto of a bill eliminating a requirement
that Chinese students return to their homeland before applying for
a visa to return to America.
   The matter moved to the Senate, where a vote scheduled for today
was expected to be a cliffhanger.
   ``People here want to make sure they stay here safely,'' said An
Wei, who works at the Chinese Student Information Center in Newton,
a Boston suburb.
   Many students were anxious about the prospect of being sent back
to China, where they faced probable political reprisals, he said.
   In Philadelphia, students also anxiously awaited the vote.
   ``We need the law to protect ourselves,'' said Wei Sun, a
32-year-old graduate student in mechanical engineering at Drexel
University. ``If the override is successful, America will send a
very strong message to the Chinese government that we cannot
tolerate what the Chinese government has done.''
   Pei Min Xin, a leader of the pro-democracy protests in Beijing
last spring, said he has learned that in China his name is on a
blacklist of students in the movement.
   If he were forced to return, he would face life imprisonment or
execution, said Pei.
   He said he felt disillusioned by the president's actions
regarding China, which has included dispatching two advisers there
last year at a time when he was pubicly condemning the Chinese
government.
   ``How can the leader of the United States be so accommodating to
people back in our own country, who tried to kill us all off, to
stamp out our legitimate demands for political change?'' said Pei,
a Harvard University graduate student in government.
   Fleeing China after the Beijing demonstrations were crushed in
June, the students in exile first gathered in Paris to form the
Front for a Democratic China, an umbrella organization of the
pro-democracy movement.
   Many, including Wu'er Kaixi, the Chinese government's
most-wanted student dissident, are studying in the Boston area and
coordinating pro-democracy activities among their peers.
   Pei is one of about 32,000 Chinese in the United States who hold
visas that require them to return to China when the visas expire
and live there for two years before they can apply for a new one.
   President Bush vetoed the bill eliminating that requirement,
saying it was unnecessary because he signed an administrative order
allowing Chinese students to stay in the United States.
   Bush, attempting to stymie override votes in the House and
Senate, said the measure could damage U.S. relations with China,
which has condemned the legislation and threatened to curtail
exchange programs if it becomes law.
   Chinese students, who have lobbied Congress on the issue, said
the override was crucial because an administrative order was not as
solid as a law. The process of revoking an order is easier, and
could happen at any time if the situation changes, they said.
   ``People would feel a lot more secure if they're staying here
because of a law,'' An said.

   Discovery of a genetic defect that apparently
causes one kind of retinitis pigmentosa may help researchers find
defects that cause other forms of the vision-robbing disease,
scientists said.
   Study of genetic defects may reveal leads for devising
treatments for the inherited condition, they added.
   Retinitis pigmentosa, which afflicts about 100,000 Americans,
gradually progresses from night blindness to tunnel vision to
blindness. Symptoms are caused by degeneration of the retina, a
delicate layer of cells at the back of the eye that detects images
and relays them to the brain.
   The newly discovered defect apparently keeps the eye from
producing a fully functional version of an important protein,
researchers said.
   The new work is reported in today's issue of the British journal
Nature by Eliot Berson, Thaddeus Dryja and colleagues at the
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston.
   It focuses on the ``autosomal dominant'' form of retinitis
pigmentosa, which accounts for perhaps 43,000 cases in the United
States, said Jeanette Felix, director of science for the
Baltimore-based RP Foundation Fighting Blindness.
   The genetic defect the researchers found may be responsible for
about 5,000 of those cases, she said. But the study's impact may go
beyond that because it focuses attention on a particular gene, and
further work may turn up more defects in that gene that cause other
forms of the disease, she said.
   In addition, the researchers wrote, the finding suggests that
other genes that play similar roles in the eye should be studied
for defects that cause other forms of retinitis pigmentosa.
   The researchers studied the gene that tells eye cells how to
make a protein called rhodopsin. This light-sensing substance plays
a major role in vision during twilight, and it is found in the
``rod'' cells of the eyes, the first to die in retinitis pigmentosa.
   The defect appeared in rhodopsin genes from 17 of 148 unrelated
patients with retinitis pigmentosa, but not in any of 102 people
without the disease, the researchers reported.
   It is unclear how the defect causes the disease, they said.
   Scientists must answer that question by introducing the
defective gene into experimental animals and studying the result,
Felix said. Once the answer is found, it may lead to experiments to
find ways to block the disease process, she said.
   Currently, scientists do not know how to stop the progression of
the disease, she said.
   The new finding allows specific diagnosis of one form of
retinitis pigmentosa and accurate genetic counseling for those who
have the genetic defect, said Meredithe Applebury of the University
of Chicago.
   Such people have a 50 percent chance of passing the
disease-causing defect on to their children, she said in an
editorial accompanying the report in Nature.

<HEAD>Ernest Borgnine Made Honorary Mayor on 73rd Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Ernest Borgnine's
swearing-in ceremony as honorary mayor turned into a rousing 73rd
birthday bash just a few steps from the pond where his old
``McHale's Navy'' TV series was made.
   Borgnine took the oath of office Wednesday in front of the
Universal Studios backlot courthouse used on ``Back to the Future
II.'' A dixieland band played ``Hail to the Chief,'' then ``Happy
Birthday.''
   Borgnine blew out the candle on a birthday cake and joined Gene
Autry and Telly Savalas in the celebration.
   ``In my long career as an actor,'' Borgnine said, ``I've been
seen by the public as a butcher, a baker and an Indian chief. I've
been a New York City taxi driver, a railroad cop and a bank-robbing
western desperado.
   ``I've held many ranks _ stockade sergeant, general and even
Navy captain. But today, I'm taking on a role I've never before
played. I've never been a mayor.''
   Past honorary mayors of Universal City, a hamlet 12 miles
northwest of downtown Los Angeles where motion pictures and
television shows are produced, include Angie Dickinson, Jerry
Mathers, Tippi Hedren and Scott Baio.
   Borgnine called the community his ``home away from home for 35
years.'' He was there for a role in the movie ``The Square Jungle''
in 1955, and the shooting of the TV series ``McHale's Navy'' in the
1960s and ``Airwolf'' in the 1980s.
   ``As our new mayor, I've been asked what I'd first like to do,''
Borgnine told the crowd of about 400 people. ``I don't know. What
do you want me to do?''
   Borgnine, who won an Academy Award for his role as the butcher
in ``Marty,'' has appeared in scores of movies including ``From
Here to Eternity,'' ``The Dirty Dozen'' and ``Escape From New
York.''

<TEXT>
   A barefoot 12-year-old's joyride in
Florida turned into a panic-fueled 625-mile drive to Tennessee
after he hit a truck with his mother's convertible, authorities
said.
   A deputy found an 85-pound boy behind the wheel of a luxury
convertible Monday night after a chase on Interstate 75 east of
Chattanooga.
   ``He seemed like a really nice kid,'' said Hamilton County
Deputy Chris Chambers. ``He was just upset, crying and scared.''
   The boy pleaded innocent Wednesday to junvile-court charges of
car theft, evading arrest and violating the Tennessee driver's
license law, authorities said.
   He was being held in juvenile detention pending his mother's
expected arrival today, said court Supervisor Richard Harter.
   The chase began when Chambers spotted the car at a service
station after receiving a report that it had been weaving on the
road.
   The driver fled north onto the highway, refusing to stop even
after the deputy flicked on his blue lights and siren. The chase
ended when two truckers helped form a moving roadblock, and
Chambers forced the car over.
   The boy, who was barefoot when he got out of the car, said he
had learned to drive by watching his mother, according to Chambers.
   The youth, whose name was withheld because of his age, told
officers he panicked after hitting the truck in Sarasota, Fla.,
earlier in the day and that he had no particular destination.
   With a half-full tank, he could have made it further had he not
been stopped. Chambers said the boy refilled the car once with $30
he had in his pocket.

<HEAD>Tape Transcripts Show Gotti Just After He Allegedly Assumed Mob
Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reputed mob boss John Gotti speaks of hiring
``them Irish guys'' in a transcript that prosecutors provided as
evidence that Gotti paid an Irish-American gang to shoot and wound
a union official.
   Gotti and an associate, Anthony Guerrieri, 60, are charged with
assault and conspiracy in the revenge shooting of John F. O'Connor,
former vice president of Carpenters Union Local 608, on May 7, 1986.
   Prosecutors say Gotti hired the Westies, a gang from the Hell's
Kitchen neighborhood, to shoot O'Connor in the buttocks because he
had thugs vandalize the Bankers and Brokers restaurant, owned by
Gotti associate Philip ``Philly'' Modica.
   O'Connor, who recovered, will not testify at Gotti's trial.
Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky told the jury
O'Connor is corrupt and has been indicted on various charges.
   Transcripts released in court Wednesday of conversations
secretly taped by the police show at least one mention by Gotti of
the restaurant and several comments on the Westies.
   At one point Gotti says `` ... they're doing something for me
them Irish guys,'' but does not say what.
   At another point, Gotti refers to James Coonan as ``my friend''
who is ``the leader of the West Side gang, Irish guys.'' He also
says, ``He's on the payroll, and he gets it legitimately ... ''
   The transcripts also show Gotti wanted to be an executive-type
crime leader whose underlings respected an underworld chain of
command.
   Prosecutors say Gotti, 49, became leader of the Gambino mob,
largest of the five New York organized crime gangs, in December
1985 after Paul Castellano, the former boss, was shot dead in front
of a steakhouse.
   On a Jan. 11, 1986, tape, Gotti tells an unidentified man: ``Me
and you may socialize, but I can't socialize with these guys. I
can't bring myself down. I'm a boss, you know what I mean?''
   His annoyance with longtime associate Angelo Ruggiero's
familiarity during business hours seems apparent on another tape
when he says, ``I told Ange, `You gotta forget them liberties you
take. Take 'em when we're alone.'''
   Gotti apparently had just made Ruggiero a ``caporegime'' (crew
captain), according to the tape transcripts, and was not satisfied
that his friend was acting like a leader. Ruggiero, a defendant in
the O'Connor case with Gotti, died of natural causes in December.
   The tapes were introduced by Edward Wright, an investigator with
the state's Organized Crime Task Force. He said the alleged
mobsters, suspecting they might be under surveillance, turned on
hair dryers, flushed toilets and whispered to try to make
conversations inaudible.
   Prosecutors say they have more than 1,000 cassettes of secretly
recorded conversations, including some where mobsters and
associates praise Gotti as ``Jesus Christ'' and ``God's gift to the
underworld.''

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Talk Show Scheduled for the Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson's syndicated talk show is on line
for next fall, and it could continue to run in most of the country
even if he became a candidate for mayor of Washington, D.C., the
show's distributor says.
   Jackson has given assurances he'll do the weekly, one-hour TV
series, ``Voices of America With Jesse Jackson,'' said Barry Stagg,
a spokesman for Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution.
   The series, to be produced by composer Quincy Jones and
Jackson's production company, would debut in September.
   The program has been picked by 82 stations covering 60 per cent
of the national audience, Stagg said by phone Wednesday from Warner
offices in Burbank, Calif.
   There has been speculation that Jackson might run for mayor of
Washington in the wake of the cocaine arrest of Mayor Marion Barry.
Jackson has refused to confirm his political plans.
   Were Jackson to seek office in Washington while his show is on
the air, the Federal Communications Commission's equal time rules
for opposing candidates would go into force, but only in the
greater Washington viewing area.
   The rules require that stations that provide air time to a
qualified political candidate must afford equal opportunity on the
air to opposing candidates who ask for the time, said Milton Gross,
an FCC official.
   No station in Washington has bought Jackson's series, Stagg
said. But the show has been purchased by WMAR-TV in nearby
Baltimore.
   Because WMAR's signal is seen in Washington, that station
wouldn't air the series _ until any election race ended _ if
Jackson sought election as Washington's mayor, said Arnold J.
Kleiner, WMAR's president.
   ``We'd like very much to run it,`` he said. ``We think it's
going to be a good show. Jesse Jackson is certainly an interesting
personality, an interesting person, one who always has something to
say.
   ``But if he runs for office, I believe we would be locked into
the equal time constraints. We would not be willing to give
(Jackson's opponents) equal time, so we probably would not run the
show.''
   Production of Jackson's series probably will start this summer
and may be done in Washington, Stagg said.

   China today strongly condemned a vote in the
House of Representatives to protect Chinese students in the United
States, and said passage of the legislation would do ``serious
harm'' to U.S.-Chinese relations.
   The House voted 390-25 Wednesday to override President Bush's
veto of legislation that would allow Chinese students, many of whom
face possible political persecution at home, to overstay their U.S.
visas.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said the House had based
its policy on rumors, ``fully revealing its anti-China position.''
   ``We express great indignation and strongly condemn this
hegemonist act of the U.S. House of Representatives,'' Jin told a
weekly briefing.
   ``Should the U.S. Senate also adopt such a bill, it would
certainly do serious harm to Sino-U.S. relations and further impair
the cultural and educational exchanges between the two countries.''
   The legislation applies to some 32,000 Chinese students, many of
whom openly criticized the Chinese government after its bloody
suppression of the pro-democracy movement last spring.
   The Senate was to vote on the bill today, and Bush was pressing
Republican senators to oppose the veto override, which needs a
two-thirds vote of both chambers to pass.
   Bush, who says it is important to maintain channels of contact
with the Chinese leadership, has initiated administrative measures
that provide Chinese students similar guarantees against forced
deportation.
   Jin did not say how the Chinese might retaliate if the student
bill becomes law, warning only that the United States must ``take
prompt and effective measures to prevent the deterioration of the
situation.''
   Nearly half of all Chinese students abroad are in the United
States, and any Chinese decision to curtail exchange programs would
affect thousands of students in China applying for overseas studies.
   Jin said Congress was trying to obstruct students from returning
``for service in their home country'' and accused U.S. lawmakers of
supporting the ``reactionary'' Front for Democracy in China and the
Chinese Democratc Alliance.
   The two groups, based in Paris and New York, are operated by
pro-democracy Chinese exiles. The front was organized by dissidents
who fled the country after the June military crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement in which hundreds of unarmed civilians were
killed.
   Jin also took a hard-line stance on two other dissidents,
astrophysicist Fang Lizhi and his wife Li Shuxian, who have been
given refuge in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since June.
   Jin said the two ``are criminals wanted by China's security
organs'' and that the United States was breaking international law
by harboring them.
   His statements echoed the stance China had taken before U.S.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft visited Beijing in
December. That vsiit appeared to set the two countries on a course
of improved relations.

   The judge in the trial of six white youths
charged in the death of a black teen-ager ruled for the second day
in a row that police had bungled procedures, and a defendant's
statement could not be used in court.
   State Judge Thaddeus Owens said Wednesday he would not allow
prosecutors to use a statement to police by defendant Joseph
Serrano because police had refused to allow Serrano to be alone
with his lawyer.
   ``Any time a lawyer can't go talk to his client without somebody
looking over his shoulder, it's a sad day for the Constitution,''
said Owens.
   Serrano, 20, is charged with murder, manslaughter, assault and
other crimes in the Aug. 23 attack on Yusuf Hawkins, who was shot
in the chest after he and three friends were surrounded by a mob of
young whites.
   Hawkins and his companions, all black, were attacked when they
went to the mostly white Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn to look at
a used car.
   On Tuesday, Owens ruled that another defendant's admission of
involvement in the crime was illegally obtained.
   Owens said detectives who took Pasquale Raucci, 19, into custody
shortly after the murder failed to advise him of his rights to
remain silent or to hire a lawyer.
   After the hearing, prosecutor Ed Boyar said there would be
separate trials for three defendants: Keith Mondello, 19, Charles
Stressler, 21, and Steven Curreri, 19.
   Curreri is not charged with murder.
   The alleged triggerman, Joseph Fama, 19, may be tried together
with Raucci and Serrano, Boyar said.
   Owens has set the first trial for March 5, but hasn't said who
would be tried first.

   A consumer group began a campaign against
disposable products today, urging environmentally concerned
shoppers to telephone their displeasure to manufacturers' toll-free
consumer lines.
   The New York Public Interest Research Group published a guide to
what it said were the worst examples of disposable, overpackaged
and non-recyclable consumer products that deplete resources and jam
landfills.
   Although it did not call for a boycott, the group urged
consumers to complain about items such as disposable diapers and
razors, plastic utensils, polystyrene foam packages and so-called
``degradable'' plastic bags.
   Given the garbage disposal crisis across much of the country,
``consumers need to send these companies a clear message that they
don't want and don't need these so-called convenience items and
overpackaged products,'' Steven A. Romalewski, the guide's author,
said in an interview.
   The guide singled out a few items as examples of the worst in
throwaway packaging, including Eastman Kodak Co.'s ``Fling''
disposable camera; Quaker Oats Co.'s ``Aunt Jemima Pancake
Express,'' which has mix for six pancakes in a disposable plastic
mixing bowl; and Heinz U.S.A.'s plastic ketchup bottles.
   The ketchup bottles are difficult to recycle because they are
made of laminated layers of plastics, the guide said.
``Juice-in-a-box'' containers, used by more than a half-dozen fruit
drink producers, pose the same problem because they contain layered
plastic, aluminium foil and paper, it said.
   While ``degradable'' plastic bags have been promoted as a
partial solution to the landfill crisis, the guide cited complaints
from environmental groups that the bags only break down into
smaller plastic particles, which remain in the environment.
   It also said they may not break down when buried, and could
weaken products made from recycled plastic.
   ``Especially at a time when industries are trying to cash in on
the green decade and this new environmentalism, they can't just try
to give the appearance that they're doing good for the
environment,'' Romalewski said. ``They have to take some tough
action.''
   Heinz spokeswoman Beth Adams, however, said her company was
``between a rock and a hard place'' because consumers prefer
plastic bottles, and only the non-recyclable kind are airproof
enough to keep ketchup from darkening.
   She said Heinz, in Pittsburgh, continues to sell glass bottles _
though they now make up only about 35 percent of its bottled
ketchup sales _ and is searching ``fast and furious'' for a
recyclable plastic bottle it can use.
   At Kodak, in Rochester, N.Y., spokeswoman Holly Walkland read a
letter prepared for customers who complain about the ``Fling''
camera, maintaining that it does not contain significantly more
material than some film cartridges.
   Quaker Oats spokesman Ron Bottrell in Chicago had no comment.
   Romalewski said boycotts seldom work unless targeted at a
specific product. But the public interest group hopes to make its
point by listing the telephone numbers of nearly two dozen
companies whose products it criticized, and urging consumers to
call.
   The 20-page guide is being distributed to consumer and
environmental groups across the country. Copies are available for
$3 from NYPIRG, 9 Murray St., N.Y., N.Y. 10007. (212) 349-6460.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto gave
birth today to a girl, her second child, Ms. Bhutto's mother said.
She is believed to be the first elected world leader to give birth
while in office.
   Nusrat Bhutto, a co-leader of her daughter's governing Pakistan
People's Party, told a news conference that Benazir Bhutto and her
daughter were both in good health.
   A name has not yet been chosen for the infant, who weighed 7
pounds, 5 ounces. She was born in Karachi's slum district of Lyari
in a private, non-profit charity hospital.
   Residents of the southern port city of 9 million said hundreds
of women began gathering at the hospital, chanting and singing, as
word of the birth spread.
   ``You can say it's a very festive mood around here,'' said
Tanvir Ahmed, a local journalist.
   In keeping with local tradition, vast quantitites of food were
served to people who gathered outside the hospital.
   Ms. Bhutto, 36, is married to industrialist Asif Zardari. Their
son, Bilawal, was born less than a month before the November 1988
elections that brought Ms. Bhutto to power.
   Ms. Bhutto's often-hostile opposition has been critical of the
prime minister's decision to have a second child.
   Abida Hussein, a key opponent, said the country would be
leaderless while Ms. Bhutto recovered. However, the prime minister
has temporarily transferred authority to her mother, an elected
member of the National Assembly.

<TEXT>
   A jury awarded nearly $1 million to three
Mexicans who claimed that sheriff's deputies used excessive force
during an altercation that was videotaped.
   The three San Bernardino County sheriff's deputies were ordered
to pay $956,000 to Auro Ruiz, Victor Serrano, and Efren Serrano.
   ``Nazi-type conduct does not go down well in the United States
and that's what the jury said,'' said attorney Stephen Yagman,
retained by the Mexican government to represent the laborers.
   Defense attorney David Lawrence said he had not decided if he
would appeal.
   The altercation occurred in June 1988 when the officers
responded to complaints about a loud party at a house in
Victorville, 70 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   The plaintiffs testified they were beaten and harassed without
provocation. But deputies said some of the men assaulted officers
when they tried to arrest them.
   The videotape, which was shown to the six-member jury, appeared
to prove the men's contentions. The deputies testified that a
segment showing them being assaulted was cut from the tape.
   The U.S. District Court jury Wednesday awarded Victor Serrano
$150,000 in compensatory damages and $150,000 in punitive damages
against deputy Mark Swagger, and awarded Serrano's father, Efren,
$60,000 in compensatory damages and $56,000 in punitive damages
against Sgt. Tim Miller.
   The panel awarded Auro Ruiz $250,000 in compensatory damages,
$250,000 in punitive damages against Sgt. John Gocke and $40,000 in
punitive damages against Sgt. Tim Miller.
   Under state law, the county will pay the compensatory damages
and the Board of Supervisors may vote on whether to pay punitive
damages as well, Lawrence said.

   Two Vietnamese men slashed themselves in the
stomach today at a detention center for boat people in what a
witness said was a protest of the policy of forced repatriation.
   The incident came a day after reports of boat people threatening
suicide to protest forced repatriation and the screening process
that determines which Vietnamese can be resettled overseas as
refugees.
   The two men, aged 36 and 39, refused medical treatment after
being taken to a hospital, where they were conscious in an
observation ward, according to a government spokesman who declined
to be identified.
   He described their condition as ``not so serious'' and said the
men were being interviewed by staff of the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees.
   An expatriate relief worker, who said he witnessed the incident,
said the two men slashed their stomaches with knives in the U.N.
agency's office at the Whitehead detention center this morning.
   ``We cannot call it suicide,'' said the relief worker. ``I think
it is their way of communication. They are trying to get
attention'' to protest forced repatriation.
   Earlier this month, two other men at the detention center
stabbed themselves in the stomach. They both survived.
   Whitehead is one of several camps housing a total of about
44,000 boat people who face repatriation against their will unless
they can prove they fled persecution in their Communist homeland.
   About one-quarter of Whitehead's 20,000 inmates already have
been classified as illegal immigrants to be repatriated. It was not
clear whether the two men who stabbed themselves were among those
whose pleas for refugee status were rejected.
   The cramped, squalid detention centers have been particularly
tense since Dec. 12, when 51 boat people were whisked onto an
airplane by security forces and forcibly repatriated to Hanoi.
   Thousands of Vietnamese in the detention centers peacefully
protested the forced repatriation policy in the following days,
although rioting erupted in one camp when security forces attempted
a check for homemade weapons.

   A 12-year-old boy allegedly raped his
5-year-old stepsister after watching a sex scene on television, and
was charged with rape and incest.
   Alameda County Juvenile Court Referee Alys Briggs on Wednesday
ordered the boy held until his Feb. 15 trial. A pretrial hearing
was set for Jan. 31.
   Police, who took the boy into custody Sunday night, said he
admitted raping his stepsister twice earlier in the day.
   ``He said he got the idea while watching TV either the day
before or earlier at his aunt's house,'' police Lt. Thomas Hull
said.
   Police didn't ask the youngster what movie or program was on, he
said.
   Doctors at Children's Hospital in Oakland, where the girl was
taken after complaining of pain, reported that she was raped. San
Leandro is just south of Oakland.
   If convicted, the boy faces a sentence ranging from probation to
a maximum of eight years in the California Youth Authority, said
Deputy District Attorney Maryann Migas.

<HEAD>Belgium Plans To Withdraw All Its Troops From West Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Belgium plans to withdraw its 25,000
troops from West Germany and has asked NATO to stop insisting that
it raise its defense budget by 5 percent, Defense Minister Guy
Coeme was quoted as saying today.
   His comments make Belgium the first NATO ally to suggest troop
cuts far beyond those now being negotiated in East-West talks in
Vienna.
   In interviews with two respected dailies, Coeme said that given
the dramatic thaw in East-West relations, it is no longer realistic
for Belgium to have troops in neighboring West Germany.
   ``The way the situation in Europe is now evolving, the
withdrawal of Belgian troops from Germany becomes likely,'' he told
De Standaard.
   In an interview with the daily Le Soir Coeme said, ``We are
moving from the era of (East-West) confrontation to that of
collaboration, of mutual respect ... How can we justify the status
quo on our side, the maintenance of our troops in Germany?''
   His remarks follow demands by Warsaw Pact members Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia for a quick and total removal of Soviet
troops from their territories.
   Belgium maintains 25,000 troops in the central West Germany at
an annual cost of $69.4 million.
   In addition to seeking the withdrawal of Belgian troops from
West Germany, Coeme said he has written NATO Secretary General
Manfred Woerner asking that Belgium no longer be required to
increase its annual defense outlays by 5 percent.
   He said NATO was reacting too slowly to events in East Europe
and added, ``It is important which signal NATO now sends to East
Europe.''
   Belgium's 1989 defense budget totaled $2.8 billion.
   In the early 1980s, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization set a
goal under which its 16 members would boost their annual defense
budgets by at least 3 percent.
   Several NATO members, notably Belgium, have long failed to meet
the target, citing financial problems. In the meantime, the target
has been raised to 5 percent for Belgium to make up for the lag.
   The NATO alliance had no immediate reaction to Coeme's comments.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The poet, writer and scholar Damaso Alonso,
director emeritus of the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language, has
died after a long illness, a family member said today. He was 91.
   Alonso, who had suffered from respiratory problems for the last
three years, died late Wednesday at his home, said the family
member, who asked not to be identified.
   A poet of the so-called ``Generation of 1927'' that included
Federico Garcia Lorca and Rafael Alberti, Alonso was also an
essayist considered among the country's leading scholars of Spanish
literature.
   In 1978, he was awarded Spain's Miguel de Cervantes Prize,
considered the highest literary prize for Spanish-language writers.
   He received honorary degrees from Oxford and the universities of
Bordeaux, Rome, Hamburg, Friburg, Lima and Costa Rica.
   Born in Madrid, he became professor of Romanesque philosophy in
the University of Valencia and later at the University of Madrid
before going on to teach at universities in South America.
   He became a member of the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language
in 1945 and served four terms as its director from 1968-82.
   His best known works included the volumes of poetry ``Pure
Poems, Poems of the City'' (1921) and ``The Sons of Anger'' (1944)
and his collected poems ``Man and God'' (1955).

   The dollar was mixed in quiet trading in Europe
this morning, supported by Wall Street's recovery at the end of the
previous day's session.
   Gold was steady at lower levels after a roller-coaster day of

average fell 60 points at the start of trading in New York, but the
index regained all but 11 points by the end of the day.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 145.30 yen, down 0.50 yen from
Wednesday's close of 145.80 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded
at 145.13 yen.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a trader with Daiwa Bank, said speculative
investors remained on the sidelines due to their concerns over the
New York stock market's performance.
   Other dollar rates at mid morning compared with late Wednesday:

<TEXT>
   Richard V. Secord, sentenced to probation for
his role in the Iran-Contra affair, is accusing former President
Reagan of not supporting the participants in the scandal.
   ``I think former President Reagan has been hiding out; I think
it's cowardly,'' Secord told a news conference after his sentencing
on Wednesday.
   ``I think that he should have stood up and taken the heat ...
just as previous presidents have done'' in failed covert
operations, Secord said. ``But instead of that (Reagan's aides)
built a wall around ... him.''
   Secord was placed on probation for two years by U.S. District
Court Judge Aubrey Robinson. The retired Air Force major general
pleaded guilty Nov. 8 to making a false statement when he told
congressional investigators he was unaware any money from the
Iran-Contra affair had benefited North.
   A focus of the three-year probe by independent counsel Lawrence
Walsh, Secord used money from the maze of offshore companies and
secret bank accounts in the Iran-Contra operation to pay for Oliver
L. North's security system.
   Secord told the judge he would regret the false statement for
the rest of his life.
   Secord also told the news conference he would mount an attack
against the federal law authorizing court-appointed independent
counsels.
   Secord said the law is ``a monster'' that is ``probably
unconstitutional'' and he hopes to encourage research on the matter
with a fundraising effort that will lead to a drive against the
statute.
   ``I have been involved in this witch-hunt for too long to stop
now,'' Secord said.
   The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Ethics in
Government Act on a 7-1 vote, but Secord said the issues in the
case were narrowly drawn. He said the independent counsel statute,
enacted in 1977 in response to the firing during the Watergate
scandal of special prosecutor Archibald Cox, should be challenged
again.
   Secord, who has met repeatedly with Iran-Contra prosecutors
since his guilty plea, may be called as a government witness in the
upcoming trial of former national security adviser John Poindexter.
   Meanwhile, North, convicted of three charges in the Iran-Contra
scandal, sent a letter recently to supporters who have contributed
to his legal defense, saying he is considering becoming the head of
a tax-exempt organization called the Freedom Alliance.
   The group would be dedicated to promoting a strong national
defense, supporting ``those who struggle for freedom throughout the
world, maintaining traditional American values'' and countering
``the left-wing dominated national media,'' said the letter.
   It also would support the anti-abortion movement and encourage
grassroots political activity, according to the letter.
   At an office where supporters of North have been raising money
for his legal defense, one North backer, Duane Ward, declined to
comment Wednesday on the matter.
   North is appealing his convictions for aiding and abetting an
obstruction of Congress, altering and destroying National Security
Council documents and accepting a $13,800 home security system from
Secord.

   Libyan authorities, apparently
retaliating for a similar action by West German police, held a
Lufthansa plane in Tripoli and detained the crew for several hours,
the airline said today.
   A statement by the West German carrier said the nine-member crew
of an Airbus 320 was detained for more than seven hours after the
plane landed in Tripoli on Wednesday afternoon.
   The plane's 86 passengers were allowed to leave the plane but
were searched, Lufthansa said. The plane was also searched and the
crew was held until midnight, when they were brought to a Tripoli
hotel.
   Lufthansa said Libyan authorities released the Airbus later
today, but that 81 passengers booked on the flight had been
transferred to other European airlines.
   On Tuesday, West German border police held and searched a Libyan
Arab Airlines Boeing 727 for several hours at Frankfurt Airport
following a tip that terrorists might be aboard.
   Three Libyan airline security guards were detained for carrying
guns without permits but were later released. The plane left for
Tripoli Wednesday morning.
   West German authorities said no other weapons were found on the
Libyan plane and the tip about terrorists proved a false alarm.

   Legislation creating a Cabinet-level
Department of the Environment is expected to move swiftly through
Congress, with sponsors saying they hope to send it to President
Bush in time for signing on Earth Day in April.
   Bush endorsed the bipartisan legislation Wednesday, saying,
``The environmental challenges that face America and the world are
so important that they must be addressed from the highest level of
our government.''
   His move drew praise from environmentalists and both Democrats
and Republicans on Capitol Hill, but several senators suggested the
president must do more than elevate the status of the Environmental
Protection Agency to deal with the world's environmental problems.
   ``It's not enough just to put an extra chair to the Cabinet
table,'' said Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., who has been a past critic of
the Bush administration's actions on such environmental matters as
global warming and atmospheric ozone depletion.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., said giving the EPA higher
visibility is ``nice frosting'' but added, ``where's the cake?'' He
accused the administration of dragging its feet in exerting
leadership in international efforts on global warming and other
environmental issues.
   But the president's decision to call for elevating the status of
the EPA _ a regulatory agency created in 1970 _ to the Cabinet
brought salutes from sponsors of the bipartisan legislation and
from many environmentalists, who said the White House support makes
passage all but certain.
   ``It's a welcomed breath of fresh air,'' said Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich., one of the cosponsors and chairman of the House Government
Operations Committee.
   Conyers said he hoped a bill could clear Congress within 90
days. The president is said to want a bill ready for his signature
as part of the Earth Day 20th anniversary celebrations April 22.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of the Senate Government
Affairs Committee, also said he would move quickly on the bill with
hearings scheduled for next month.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said today that the creation
of a Cabinet department ``is a message internationally ... that the
environment is moving now into the mainstream for a whole range of
policies _ economic policies, energy policies, foreign policies of
all sorts.''
   ``It also has another effect domestically,'' Reilly said on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program. ``When the EPA
administrator is doing his job, he is in everybody else's hair,
whether it's wetlands or water policy ... or dams or transportation
projects, energy facilities. ... this is a wonderful way of saying
... that the environment belongs at the big table.''
   While the EPA's influence is broad, the agency has toiled far
from the focus of power during most of its two decades.
   When Reilly, an environmentalist by profession, was sworn in as
EPA administrator shortly after Bush took office, it was the first
time a president had visited the EPA's headquarters in southwest
Washington.
   The agency, with 16,000 employees and an annual budget of more
than $5 billion, would become the 15th Cabinet-level department.
The Cabinet was last expanded in 1988 when the Department of
Veterans Affairs' was added.
   Congressional and administration sources said the proposal
before Congress would not change the agency significantly in
structure or size. One exception would be creation of a Bureau of
Environmental Statistics to keep tabs on environmental data.
   But elevation to Cabinet secretary would give the EPA
administrator more clout within the government and increased
prestige in dealings with other countries, say environmentalists
and congressional supporters of the change. Although Reilly attends
many Cabinet meetings, he does not as a routine sit at the table.
   ``It's a different dynamic to have a seat at the table,'' said
Frederick Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense
Fund. ``Finally we would have a secretary of the environment who
can bring things up at Cabinet meeting as well as react to the
hare-brained ideas of the secretary of defense or whoever.''
   But Michael Fischer, executive director of the Sierra Club,
cautioned: ``Elevating the EPA to the Cabinet is no substitute for
the president himself being a leader for strong environmental
legislation and worldwide environmental negotiations.''

   John J. O'Shea, an aide and speechwriter for
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and a Democratic Party leader, died
Tuesday of a heart-related ailment. He was 70.
   O'Shea's government service began after World War II, when he
became a consultant to the State Department. He helped direct the
first international observance of United Nations Day and was
President Truman's undersecretary of labor.
   He moved to Philadelphia in 1954 as executive assistant to the
chairman of Bankers Securities Corp. At that time, he also joined
the faculty of the St. Joseph's College Institute on Industrial
Relations.
   As an aide to President Kennedy, O'Shea helped draw up enabling
legislation for the Agency for International Development.
   He was president of Thomas J. LaBrum Associates Inc., a
Philadelphia-based public relations firm, from the mid-1960s until
his retirement three years ago.

   A judge today rejected an
application to free a white former police captain allegedly
involved in a secret terror network that harassed and assassinated
anti-apartheid activists.
   The suspect, Ferdinand Barnard, has been held without charge
since Oct. 31 as part an investigation into the assassinations last
year of two white activists: Johannesburg university lecturer David
Webster and Namibian lawyer Anton Lubowski.
   Pretoria Supreme Court Justice H.J. Priess rejected a bid by
Barnard's father, a retired police colonel, to have the former
narcotics detective released.
   In Windhoek, Namibia, another Supreme Court judge today set
April 18 as the start of a murder trial for Donald Acheson, a
suspected accomplice of Barnard who is accused of involvement in
Lubowksi's killing.
   Lubowski, shot and killed outside his Windhoek home on Sept. 12,
was the only white to hold a leadership position in Namibia's
independence movement, the South-West African People's
Organization. Webster, a well-known human rights activist, was shot
and killed outside his Johannesburg home on May 1.
   Police Brig. Floris Mostert, in testimony opposing Barnard's
release, said the investigation into the assassinations had
uncovered the existence of ``a secret organization ... with members
from all levels of society, which strives to terrorize left-wing
radicals with the aid of violence and intimidation.''
   Dozens of anti-apartheid activists have been the victims of
unsolved murders in recent years. Many others have had their cars
vandalized, and there have been bombings or arson attacks on
offices of militant trade unions, civil rights groups, and
opposition newspapers.
   Mostert said Barnard had been in contact with Acheson prior to
Lubowski's murder. The brigadier also said: ``I must respectfully
stress that the nature of my investigation is extremely sensitive
and that the secrecy of the information which I possess is of the
utmost importance.''
   Police say the Webster-Lubowski case is not directly related to
investigations of claims that death squads within the ranks of the
national police force killed government opponents on the orders of
high-ranking officers.
   One black ex-policeman, Butana Nofemela, has pleaded guilty to
committing a murder as part of such a death squad, and a white
former captain, Dirk Coetzee, has fled abroad after telling a
newspaper he commanded a death squad.
   Thus far, legal steps have been taken only against Nofemela and
Coetzee, not against other policemen implicated by them. This has
resulted in widespread demands for an independent judicial inquiry
and accusations that President F.W. de Klerk's government is
engaged in a cover-up.
   Some of the white officers implicated by Coetzee appeared today
at an inquest into the deaths of four young black activists in
1986. The policemen have denied allegations that the youths were
murdered, saying they were shot in self-defense by a special
counter-insurgency unit.

   A black man who claimed he was framed
for the murder of a white student during school racial turmoil in
1974 must serve his life sentence without parole, Gov. Buddy Roemer
said.
   Roemer on Wednesday rejected a pardon board recommendation that
Gary Tyler's sentence be reduced to 60 years, which would make him
eligible for parole in 1995.
   ``Gary Tyler was found guilty after a full jury trial,'' Roemer
said in a statement. ``His conviction has been reviewed extensively
by the courts over the past 15 years. Those reviewing courts have
found Gary Tyler's trial to be fundamentally fair by all legal
standards. Also, I believe his efforts toward rehabilitation have
not been sufficient.''
   At a Dec. 14 hearing, the pardon board was presented with
petitions from Amnesty International and other groups that had
collected 12,000 signatures.
   The board's vote was 3-2, with the three black members for
clemency and the two whites against. None would comment.
   Opposition came from prosecutors and from the family of the
victim, 13-year-old Timothy Weber. ``I know it had to be hard for
the governor, I'm sure, but he made my day,'' said Leah Weber,
mother of the dead boy.
   Tyler's attorney, Mary Howell, read a statement from Tyler, 31,
that said, ``This decision doesn't discourage me whatsoever in
continuing my battle to win my freedom and to show those out there
that I am innocent.''
   Tyler was a 15-year-old activist for school desegregation in
1974 when whites and blacks clashed at Destrehan High School. He
was among a group of blacks aboard a school bus that had been
surrounded by whites hurling bottles and rocks. A shot fired from
the bus killed Weber, standing with his mother across the
schoolyard.
   Witnesses said the pistol was held by a gloved hand. Tyler was
the only one on the bus wearing gloves, police said.
   Tyler's supporters say that a student who testified against him
was a known liar and that police planted a pistol found in the
stuffing of the torn seat where Tyler had sat.
   An all-white jury sentenced Tyler to the electric chair, but the
sentence was reduced to life when the Supreme Court struck down
Louisiana's death penalty law in 1976.
   Tyler's lawyer said the governor was incorrect in saying the
courts found the trial to be fair by all legal standards.
   ``The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal said the trial was
fundamentally unfair, that there was a presumption of guilt,'' she
said. ``But the court would not order a new trial because the
lawyer failed to object.''

<HEAD>Police in Minority Area Ordered to Be Alert for Unrest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top official in one of China's largest ethnic
minority areas ordered armed police officials to intensify
anti-riot training and intelligence work as a prevention against
unrest.
   ``We soberly see that some unstable factors still exist, and
must heighten our vigilance and prepare for possible
disturbances,'' said Wang Enmao, chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region's advisory committee.
   His remarks were quoted in the Jan. 19 Xinjiang Daily, which
arrived in Beijing on today.
   In other developments today:
   _China criticized Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, two
former socialist allies, over separate cases it said constituted
interference in China's internal affairs.
   _A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed that Beijing-based
foreign correspondents no longer will have to apply 10 days in
advance for press coverage of events outside the capital.
   However, the spokesman, Jin Guihua, made clear at a news
briefing that under new regulations announced Saturday, foreign
reporters still will have to receive permission from local
authorities for all trips outside Beijing.
   Regarding the ethnic minority areas, Wang indicated that the
danger existed of both ethnic unrest and politically inspired
``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' such as the government says took
place in Beijing during the spring when students demanded
democratic reform.
   ``We must strengthen training with regard to preventing and
supressing disturbances (and) ... Strengthen intelligence work in
order to promptly and accurately understand the situation,'' Wang
said. ``The armed police must stay in close contact with the
peoples of each ethnic group and obtain the support of the people
of each.'
   The report did not say if Wang's meeting with top officials of
the People's Armed Police in Xinjiang, a vast region in far
northwestern China inhabited mainly by Moslem minorities, was
triggered by the ethnic strife in the Soviet Union.
   Xinjiang's Moslems have rioted from time to time, most recently
in May when Moslems in Urumchi took to the streets in anger over a
Chinese book they said slandered their religion.
   China has refrained from any comment on the fighting between
Moslem Azerbaijanis and Christian Armenians in the Soviet Caucasus
region.
   Jin, asked at a news briefing today if Chinese newspapers had
been told not to report heavily on the Soviet riots, said it was up
to each newspaper to decide. He added, ``I believe there is no
implication for the minority nationalities in China.''
   China's official media have given the Soviet strife routine
coverage, with brief stories on the international pages of
newspapers, including the Xinjiang Daily, and reports on national
television and radio.
   As usual, the media also have carried a steady diet of reports
stressing the need for unity among ethnic groups, which China calls
``nationalities.''
   Regions inhabited by minority groups are among China's poorest.
   Regarding Czechoslovakia, Jin reproached its new president,
Vaclav Havel, for inviting exiled Tibetan spiritual leader the
Dalai Lama to visit.
   Jin said the Dalai Lama was an exile ``long engaged in
activities aimed at splitting China'' and that Havel's invitation
for the Buddhist monk to visit in February, even in a private
capacity, ``cannot but be regarded as a political action involving
gross interference in China's internal affairs.''
   Jin said the Foreign Ministry ``has made solemn and strong
representations to the Czechoslovak Embassy in China asking the
Czechoslovak side to withdraw its invitation to Dalai after careful
consideration.''
   The Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India, is deeply revered
by the people of Tibet, scene of violent pro-independence and
anti-Chinese riots over the past two years.
   China accused the Soviet Union of violating its sovereignty by
reportedly sending a delegation to Taiwan to discuss the
possibility of direct air flights. Jin, referring to the Soviet air
talks with Taiwan's China Airlines, said the Beijing government was
``resolutely opposed'' to any foreign airlines starting air service
with Taiwan.
   ``This is by no means non-governmental, economic or trade in the
ordinary sense, but rather a political issue involving China's
sovereignty.''
   He said consultations with China ``are a must'' before such a
step is taken and ``we hope that the countries concerned act with
prudence in this matter.''
   China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province. It tolerates
economic and trade relations between Taiwan and foreign countries
but strongly opposes any kind of official ties between Taiwan and
countries that have diplomatic relations with Beijing.

   A Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed today that
foreign correspondents based in Beijing no longer will have to
apply 10 days in advance to cover events outside the capital.
   Spokesman Jin Guihua, however, made clear at a news briefing
that under new regulations announced Saturday, foreign reporters
still need permission from local authorities for all trips outside
Beijing.
   Consequently, local officials still have the authority to bar
foreign reporters from covering demonstrations, natural disasters
or other breaking events.
   The 10-day rule was imposed in 1986 but generally ignored until
October 1987 when authorities in the Tibetan capital, Lhasa,
invoked it to expel foreign reporters who had gone there to cover
anti-Chinese riots.
   Lhasa has been under martial law since March, and with rare
exceptions all applications by journalists to visit the city have
been rejected.
   Jin said the ministry had ``taken into consideration the views
put forward by foreign journalists in the past concerning the
10-day rule'' and that the new regulations omitted the rule ``to
facilitate the press coverage in China by foreign journalists.''
   He stressed that the regulations require all foreign journalists
to obtain permission from local foreign affairs offices before
leaving Beijing for reporting in other parts of the country.
   Asked about clauses in the new regulations saying journalists
may lose their accreditation if they ``distort the facts, create
rumors or use improper methods to interview or report,'' Jin urged
journalists to follow the regulations.
   ``Foreign correspondents need not worry so long as they abide by
the regulations and observe their professional ethics and make
legitimate press coverage in China,'' he said. ``The Chinese
government has all along dealt with cases according to facts and
according to law.''
   After the suppression of pro-democracy protests in June, Chinese
authorities expelled two American journalists who had been based in
Beijing and ordered half a dozen reporters who had come from
outside China to cover the political turmoil to leave the country.
   The journalists were accused of violating martial law
regulations on news coverage. Under martial law, which was lifted
in Beijing earlier this month, all interviews had to be approved by
military authorities.

   Pioneering scientists George Washington Carver
and Percy F. Julian are the first blacks named to the National
Inventors Hall of Fame.
   They were among 10 people, including the founders of two of the
nation's largest computer companies and the developers of a leading
ulcer medicine, chosen for the honor.
   They ``are the real heroes of our age,'' Jeffrey M. Samuel,
acting commissioner of Patents and Trademarks, said about those
chosen Wednesday.
   ``They are the thinkers and the problem-solvers. They have
opened new doors and pioneered new frontiers in science and
technology.''
   Carver, once director of agriculture at Tuskegee Institute, was
selected for his work developing countless products from peanuts
and sweet potatoes. Julian, a Chicago chemist, was the first to
synthesize cortisone and other human hormones.
   ``He was one of the most persistent men I have known,'' Samuel
B. Massie of the U.S. Naval Academy said about Julian, a former
colleague.
   Tenacity was cited as a necessary ingredient by another man
being honored.
   Robert S. Ledley of Georgetown University said the prerequisite
skills for success include a pragmatic attitude, boldness,
fortitude ``and `stick-to-itiveness' almost to the extent of
obsession.''
   Ledley was named to the Hall of Fame for his development of the
CT scanner, a special X-ray device that allows doctors to see the
inner workings of the body in great detail.
   Honoree Herman Hollerith was described as having left behind a
motto for the generations: ``Do not fold, spindle or mutilate.''
   Hollerith invented the punch-card system that helped pave the
way to modern computers. A Census Bureau employee, he halved the
time it took to tabulate the 1890 national head count and later
went on to help found the giant International Business Machines
Corp.
   The second computer pioneer honored was Kenneth S. Olsen,
developer of the magnetic memory core for computers and founder of
Digital Equipment Corp.
   Graham C. Durant, John C. Emmett and C. Robin Gannellin were
selected jointly for their work in medical chemistry. The three
developed the drug cimetidine, which has greatly reduced the need
for surgery for ulcer victims. It is known by the trade name
Tagamet.
   Charles P. Ginsberg was named for his work leading the
engineering team that developed the first practical videotape.
Eugene J. Houdry, a French-born engineer, was honored for
developing the procedure that allows crude oil to be processed into
high-grade gasoline and aviation fuel.
   The selection of 10 new members is the most since six were
chosen in 1985, and brings total membership to 85. The Hall of Fame
was Founded at the Patent Office in Arlington, Va. A new Hall of
Fame building is scheduled to be built in Akron, Ohio.
   Thomas A. Edison was the first member. The Hall also includes
many of the nation's best-known inventors, including Alexander
Graham Bell, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Charles Goodyear, Rudolf
Diesel, Henry Ford and Philo T. Farnsworth.
   The newest members will be inducted in April.

<HEAD>Bacteria Blamed in Deaths of Seven Hospital Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A hospital closed a surgical ward and placed 19
patients in isolation after discovering a bacterium caused the
deaths of seven patients over the past three months.
   The patients were moved out of Detroit Receiving Hospital's
surgical intensive care ward Wednesday night so that it could be
thoroughly cleaned, hospital spokesman Dennis Archambault said.
   ``Our concern in evacuating the patients is that we have people
with open wounds or who are physically weak from surgeries who are
more susceptible to this kind of infection,'' he said.
   Earlier Wednesday, doctors identified the bacterium, determined
it came from within the hospital and linked it to the deaths of the
seven patients recovering from surgery, he said.
   Detroit Receiving is a 340-bed hospital that treats critically
injured patients, such as those with gunshot or knife wounds, said
spokeswoman Diane Cooper. Its only elective surgery is for burn
patients, she said. It is a unit of the private, not-for-profit
Detroit Medical Center.
   ``There are always bacterial infections in a hospital, and many
are routinely treated,'' Archambault said. ``This happens to be a
particularly virulent form of bacterium infection.''
   Archambault said the evacuated patients were exposed to or
infected by acinetobacter calcoaceticus varanitratus, or ACV. He
said the patients are receiving antibiotics and other treatment.
   Dr. Norman Hayner, chief of the disease control for the state
Health Department, said bacteria such as ACV are transmitted in a
several ways, including personal contact and contamination of food,
water, drugs, intravenous fluid and other hospital materials.

   Three opposition parties today called
on the provisional government to resign and allow a new,
broader-based caretaker government to run the country until
elections are held in May.
   The call reflected mounting dissatisfaction with the National
Salvation Front, which has reversed its original promise not to get
involved in Romania's first free elections in more than 50 years,
promised for May 20.
   The front took power in December during the bloody popular
revolt that overthrew Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was
executed Dec. 25 along with his wife, Elena. The front has had
trouble earning the peoples' trust ever since, partly because some
of its members are linked to the previous regime.
   In a communique published in the newspaper Romania Libera, the
National Peasant Party, National Liberal Party and the Social
Democratic Party of Romania called for a new interim government to
rule until the elections, and said it should include all parties,
youth, and former dissidents.
   The three opposition parties, which before World War II
dominated national politics, recently became active again in
Romania.
   In what appeared to be a conciliatory move, the front called
today on Romania's 15 new or revived political parties to hold
talks Saturday on working out an election law to pave the way for
the balloting, Bucharest radio said. ``All political parties are
invited to join the talks,'' the report said.
   A leading dissident poet, Ana Blandiana, also criticized the
front's announcement that it would field candidates, telling
Romania Libera that move was ``burdened with future dangers'' for
the country.
   ``Illusions Lasted Only One Month,'' headlined the Romania
Libera.
   ``The front's participation in the (May) elections could lead to
re-establishing a single party, under other forms, and to missing,
perhaps definitively, the chance that Romania become a really
democratic country,'' the newspaper editorialized.
   On Wednesday, 1,000 people demonstrated outside the front's
headquarters to demand it not take part in the elections.
   In response, the front again published in today's newspapers its
Jan. 3 decree outlawing demonstrations in Bucharest and allowing
them only in some parks, unless they are approved by police 48
hours in advance.
   The announcement said those taking part in illegal protests
could be sentenced to up to 30 days in jail or fined up to $250.
   The Peasant Party, which before World War II dominated Romanian
politics with 2 million members, condemned the front's decision to
contest the election, and some of its members joined the Bucharest
demonstration Wednesday.
   Today's communique indicated that the Peasant Party and two
other revived groups prominent before the 1947 Communist takeover
have formed a virtual alliance against the front.
   The three-party statement said that by deciding to take part in
the elections, the front lost the neutrality needed to administer
the balloting.
   ``What kind of elections are we talking about when the National
Salvation Front has monopolized in a totalitarian way all the key
systems of the state,'' the communique said. ``The front has funds
... and controls television, radio and the newspapers.''
   While the front has set up a nominally separate provisional
government, its executive council in fact makes all major
governmental decisions.
   The three parties accused the front of trying to usurp the
revolution that overthrew Ceausescu's 24-year rule. ``This victory
belongs to the people and cannot be confiscated by anyone,'' it
said.
   It said the front is maintaining power ``under the pretext that
some of its members were dissidents at a late hour or that they
were shunted aside by the whims of the ex-dictator.''
   It repeated opposition charges that some members of the front
were Ceausescu's henchmen and want to reinstate Communist rule.

   Jesse Jackson, who is being courted to run for
mayor of Washington, D.C., in the wake of incumbent Marion Barry's
cocaine possession arrest, says the job holds no attraction for him.
   ``The mayoralty of Washington has zero political leverage,''
Jackson was quoted by columnist A.M. Rosenthal in today's editions
of The New York Times. ``It would be, for me, a burden without
authority, a platform to address the drug problem but without
tools.''
   Business, labor and political leaders were scheduled to meet
Thursday night to develop a strategy to bring Jackson into the
mayoral race, sources in Washington have said.
   Jackson repeatedly has maintained that he would never run
against Barry. The mayor, however, was arrested on a misdemeanor
cocaine possession charge Jan. 18. Sources said he has decided not
to seek re-election to a fourth term in November.
   Jackson, a two-time Democratic presidential contender, said in
Washington on Tuesday night that he had no plans to run for mayor,
although he added that public servants ``never say never.''
   He repeated his position to the Times that he planned to devote
his energies to obtaining statehood for the District of Columbia.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias skirmished
in south Lebanon today. Christian radio stations reached a
compromise with Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun over news
coverage and ended a weeklong strike.
   Police said at least five members of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, were wounded when a tank cannon round fired by
gunmen of the mainstream Shiite Amal militia hit their position in
the southern Apple Province.
   A police spokesman also said overnight skirmishes with machine
guns occurred between Aoun's soldiers and Syrian-backed militias
across Beirut's dividing Green Line but that no injuries were
reported.
   By police count, 98 people have been killed and 286 wounded in
the latest round of Amal-Hezbollah clashes for control of the 1.2
million Shiites since it broke out in the Apple Province on Dec.
23. The more than 1 million Shiites make up the largest segment of
the 17 sects among Lebanon's 4 million people.
   The Amal-Hezbollah clashes continued despite efforts by Iranian
and Algerian envoys to stop the fighting.
   Amal-Hezbollah battles renewed Wednesday, shattering a 16-day
relative lull that had prevailed over Apple Province, the scene of
a two-year intermittent inter-Shiite war which has killed 930
people and wounded 2,753.
   Christian radio stations resumed newscasts for the first time in
a week today after the media in the Christian enclave reached a
compromise with Aoun.
   Voice of Lebanon and Voice of Free Lebanon radio stations said
the stations agreed to refer to Syrian-backed President Elias Hrawi
only as ``Mr. Elias Hrawi.'' The compromise also allows the media
to refer to Aoun only as Gen. Michel Aoun and not as interim prime
minister.
   As soon as Hrawi was elected president on Nov. 24, he dismissed
Aoun as army commander and interim prime minister. However, the
54-year-old general held out in the shell-wrecked presidential
palace and challenged Hrawi to oust him from the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
   Aoun, in a directive issued Jan. 16, banned the media from
referring to Hrawi as president and to Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem,
as prime minister.
   The directive also said the media should refer to parliament
members as former legislators, noting that Aoun had declared the
unicameral house dissolved to prevent the election of a
Syrian-backed president.
   The compromise allows the media to refer to Hoss as prime
minister and to the legislators as parliamentary deputies, said
Voice of Lebanon, which is controlled by the rightist Phalange
Party.
   Aoun's wrath was directed at the media in the Christian enclave.
He banned two daily newspapers and a newsletter from publishing for
a week each for defying his orders.
   Voice of Free Lebanon, controlled by the Lebanese Forces, the
main Christian militia, said the Ad-Diyar and Al-Bayrak papers and
Akhbar al-Yom newsletter will resume publishing after the
suspension ends.

   Four of Mayor Marion Barry's bodyguards are
being ordered to testify before a federal grand jury investigating
the mayor's ties to a convicted drug dealer, according to sources.
   The grand jury was meeting today to hear from two of the guards,
according to sources who spoke to The Associated Press on condition
of anonymity.
   The same grand jury heard testimony earlier in the week from
Rasheeda Moore, a friend of the mayor who helped lure Barry into
the FBI sting operation at a Washington hotel where he allegedly
smoked crack cocaine.
   The sources said the officers called to testify include two who
were with Barry on the December 1988 night when he met with Charles
Lewis, a former city employee, at a downtown Washington hotel.
   The federal probe of Barry began after city police aborted an
attempt to make an undercover drug buy from Lewis, who has since
been convicted of drug charges. The attempt was halted after
authorities learned that the mayor was in Lewis' hotel room in
downtown Washington.
   The sources identified two of the subpoenaed guards as city
police officers James Stays and Joseph Newman.
   Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens,
said she had no comment on whether the officers had been subpoenaed.
   Attempts to reach Stays and Newman by telephone were
unsuccessful. There were no answers at their homes.
   Meanwhile, Ms. Moore said through her lawyer Wednesday that she
would not respond to inquiries about her personal life or ties to
the mayor. Moore returned Wednesday to Burbank, Calif., where she
lives.
   Ms. Moore missed a court date on Tuesday in a drunken driving
case, the same day she was testifying before the Washington grand
jury. An arrest warrant was issued when she failed to show for her
hearing in Van Nuys Municipal Court, officials said. The judge,
however, postponed the warrant's release until Jan. 30 to give her
time to appear, a court clerk said.
   Ms. Moore was arrested on the drunken driving charge in North
Hollywood on New Year's Day, police said.
   WRC-TV reported separately that four members of the mayor's
security detail are facing departmental charges that could lead to
dismissal. The four were not identified.
   Barry is enrolled in a 28-day program at the Hanley-Hazelden
Center, a substance abuse treatment clinic in West Palm Beach, Fla.

<TEXT>
   Two researchers haven't come up with a cure for
the common cold. But they think they've discovered a link to the
cause of another common ailment, flu.
   They blame an overactive sun, marked by a peak in its sunspot
activity.
   The solar connection was proposed in a letter to the editor in
today's issue of the British journal Nature by astronomer Sir Fred
Hoyle and his colleague, N.C. Wickramasinghe.
   But an influenza researcher says he doubts that flu outbreaks
are linked to solar activity.
   There are many other attractive theories about what causes
influenza outbreaks, so ``I don't think we have to hypothesize that
they come raining down from the atmosphere,'' said Paul Glezen of
the Baylor College of Medicine.
   Sunspots are dark markings that show up periodically on the sun.
On average, the number of sunspots peaks every 11 years or so.
   The analysis of the British researchers suggests that peak
sunspot activity and flu pandemics have occurred at about the same
time unusually often from 1761 to 1893 and from 1919 to 1979.
   Solar activity peaks when the number of sunspots is at a
maximum, the British researchers said.
   ``Electrical fields associated with intense solar winds can
rapidly drive charged particles of the size of viruses down through
the exposed upper atmosphere into the shelter of the lower
atmosphere,'' possibly causing the link to influenza, they wrote.
   But Glezen, an epidemiologist at Baylor's Influenza Research
Center, said the idea ``doesn't sound too likely.''
   Influenza viruses have a fatty covering that is not very stable
outside the body, so it is ``hard to imagine that a virus particle
could be floating around for a very long time in the atmosphere and
remain viable,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Preparing $1 Billion Aid Program for Panama</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to confirm package will be announced today;
SUBS pvs 20th graf, Vice President, to confirm Quayle will take
package with him</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush will propose providing more
than $1 billion to help Panama recover from the U.S. military
invasion and years of corrupt government, U.S. officials say.
   The aid program, being announced today, will include development
aid, loan guarantees and programs to encourage investment, said one
official, who insisted on anonymity.
   About half of the program will be in cash and the remainder in
credits, the official said.
   Earlier Wednesday, Bush told a news conference he was determined
to ``try to help _ repair the wounds, repair the damage.''
   ``I mourn the loss of innocent civilians in Panama or anywhere
else,'' Bush said. ``But you have to look at the broad picture ...
and then you've got to do what's right.''
   The official said the administration hopes other countries,
including Japan and western European nations, will follow the U.S.
lead and make contributions of their own.
   The administration is still talking behind the scenes with
leaders of Congress about the Panama aid package. ``Not all of it's
new money,'' a senior administration official who asked not to be
identified said Wednesday night, confirming the $1 billion figure.
   Bush also voiced hopes Wednesday that Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev would ``Not only survive but stay strong'' in the face of
unprecedented domestic upheaval that threatens his stability.
   Regarding Gorbachev's use of Soviet troops to quell ethnic
violence in the southern republic of Azerbaijan, Bush said,
``Anytime you have a use of force and the loss of life, we are
concerned. But I don't believe I can judge that question right
now.''
   The Panama aid package will include aid to rebuild houses that
were demolished in the Dec. 20 invasion by U.S. troops, officials
said. However, they said the package is unlikely to include any
compensation for the survivors of more than 200 Panamanian
civilians who died in the invasion.
   Asked what he would say to the Panamanian survivors, Bush said
he would tell them, ``Look, you lost some Panamanian lives.
Innocent life was lost. And yet, 92 percent of the people in Panama
strongly supported the action of the United States. Isn't that
significant?''
   Damage estimates from the invasion vary widely, ranging from a
few hundred million dollars to $2 billion or more. The United
States already has released $400 million in Panamanian assets
frozen in the United States in earlier efforts to topple the regime
led by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, ousted in the invasion.
   If the program is approved, Panama would become one of the
largest per capita aid recipients in the world after having spent
more than two years as a target of U.S. economic sanctions.
   The United States suspended aid to Panama in late 1987 and began
a policy designed to starve the country economically in early 1988
after Noriega's indictment on drug-trafficking charges by two
Florida federal grand juries.
   The result of the U.S. actions was a steep decline in the
Panamanian economy, producing a crisis that was aggravated by the
U.S. invasion.
   The U.S. official said the aid proposal will require a
supplemental appropriation by the Congress for part of the money
but much of it will be paid through cuts from aid programs to other
countries.
   ``A big chunk will be out of the taxpayers' pockets,'' the
official said, predicting a tough fight in finding the money.
   He said Panama, although a small country of about 2\ million
people, requires substantial aid because successive military
governments, including Noriega's, stole a good portion of the
national treasury.
   Panama is behind on its obligations to international lending
institutions, and its total foreign debt amounts to $534 million.
   Vice President Dan Quayle will take the specifics of the plan
when he travels to Panama this weekend for talks with the new
government, a White House official said.
   Also on Wednesday, Bush presided at a full-dress military
welcome for the president of North Yemen, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and
hailed him as ``a man of extraordinary accomplishment'' at a state
dinner.
   Saleh urged Bush to prod Israel to give Palestinians in the
occupied territories the right of self-determination. Bush assured
his guest of America's commitment ``to security in the Middle East
and to the pursuit of a just and lasting peace.''

   Two men with a history of anti-homosexual
violence hunted down and killed an emotionally disturbed Vietnam
veteran because they believed the victim was gay, police said.
   Michael Taylor and an accomplice allegedly stabbed James
Zappalorti repeatedly Monday night on a beach near his home in the
Staten Island borough of New York City.
   Taylor, 20, was charged Wednesday with murder and criminal
possession of a deadly weapon, a knife that was found on the beach.
The accomplice, 26-year-old Philip Sarlo, was still at large,
police said.
   Taylor and Sarlo were convicted in an April 1986 attempted
murder of another man they believed was homosexual, police said.
Taylor was charged as a youthful offender in that case and served
18 months for the crime, as did Sarlo.
   Inspector Richard Mayronne, a police spokesman, said the two
hated homosexuals.
   ``They killed that man because they thought that he was a
homosexual,'' he said. Police said they didn't know if Zappalorti
was homosexual.
   The body was found by Zappalorti's brother Tuesday on a beach
near a small lean-to which the mentally disabled man frequented.
   The shed is across the street from the stained-glass window
business and house where Zappalorti worked and lived with his
parents. The business produces windows for many of Staten Island's
churches.
   Zappalorti enlisted in the Navy in 1962 and was discharged in
1965 with a disability after suffering a nervous breakdown, said
his mother, Mary.
   A neighbor, Owen Reiter, said Zappalorti was a kind man who
swept the street, mowed lawns and cleaned the beach without asking
for pay.
   ``He collected broken bits of bottles and made windows in the
hut'' on the beach, Reiter said. ``He was a harmless person. He
wouldn't hurt anyone.''
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Taylor
and an accomplice ``went out looking'' for Zappalorti on Monday,
and had planned to rob and kill him. His throat had been slashed
and his chest and neck had stab wounds.
   A short time after the murder, Taylor and the other suspect
allegedly used Zappalorti's house keys to burglarize his family's
home. They fled when Mary Zappalorti surprised them, but took a
pair of rosary beads said to resemble diamonds, Mayronne said.

   A popular politician who quit the Communist
Party said today that East Germany never developed its own identity
during 40 years of Communist rule and that reunification with West
Germany is ``unavoidable.''
   The East German government said it has lifted all barriers to
competition between companies and that foreign investors may buy
majority shares of enterprises here if the projects are ``in the
public's economic interest.''
   The announcement by Economics Minister Christa Luft is a major
concession to Western businesses, which had shown little interest
in joint ventures and other investments when the government said it
would limit foreign ownership to 49 percent. Ms. Luft said the
revision was made to stimulate the investment necessary to revive
East Germany's flagging economy.
   Also today, the ADN news agency said Communist Party chief
Gregor Gysi had been invited to Washington next week for talks with
President Bush on Eastern Europe. It did not say when the trip
would occur and said it was ``private.''
   The Communist Party faces growing opposition among East Germans,
in part because of its opposition to unification with West Germany.
   Wolfgang Berghofer, the mayor of Dresden, quit the party this
week. In a speech to the Dresden City Council today, the popular
leader said of unification: ``It is unavoidable that what belongs
together will grow together.''
   ``The only question is in what time frame and in what manner it
will occur,'' he said.
   ``There remain two separate rights of citizenship, but this can
no longer be compared to national identity,'' Berghofer said.
   Berghofer's defection from the Communists came on top of strikes
and mass demonstrations against the party, which has been accused
of being too slow to adopt reforms.
   A one-hour strike in Dresden on Wednesday shut down 200 of the
city's most important offices and services, and police in Leipzig
rallied in support of pro-democracy activists.
   A leading East German economist warned in a report published
Wednesday that the economy could collapse if the country doesn't
swiftly convert to a free- market system.
   Siegfried Schiller, a Communist and deputy director of Dresden's
economic research institute, said that such a collapse could come
within a year without radical reforms.
   ``The house is on fire and the government is wasting time
posturing,'' Schiller told the newspaper Die Union. ``Every attempt
to shore up a planned economy must be resisted.''
   He said he feared half-hearted reform attempts could cut off
critical supplies of raw materials before East Germany can afford
to buy them from the West.
   Economics Minister Luft also proposed the speedy introduction of
market-oriented economic reforms, a West German TV network reported
Wednesday.
   Ms. Luft suggested allowing the East German mark to be freely
exchanged for other currencies by 1992, dismantling price controls,
reducing state subsidies and introducing performance-oriented
salaries and a new taxation system, ZDF television reported.
   Ms. Luft also wants to end the state's monopoly on foreign trade.
   Some of the steps could start taking effect this year, ZDF
reported.
   However, Communist Premier Hans Modrow's government has resisted
moving toward a free-market economy, calling instead for a ``third
way'' between capitalism and communism.
   But pressure for a conversion to capitalism has built up in
recent weeks, with West Germany's powerful business community
sensing vast new opportunities.
   East Germany's inefficient, centrally planned economy has been
hard hit by the exodus of some 340,000 citizens to West Germany
last year, many of them skilled young workers.
   The migration tapered off after authorities opened borders to
the West in November. But up to 2,000 East Germans are still
fleeing daily, disillusioned about the prospects of reform despite
free elections promised in May.

<HEAD>NATO Study Casts Doubt on Chance for Success of Soviet Economic
Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A NATO study said Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's economic reform program has had little impact in the
Soviet Union, and it cast doubt on the chances of it ever
succeeding.
   The study, obtained by The Associated Press today, said the
failure of ``perestroika'' is evident in falling living standards
of Soviet citizens, and it blamed Soviet leaders for the situation.
   ``The failure of the Soviet leadership to press ahead with key
measures such as price reforms, and the half-hearted manner in
which it has approached the growing fiscal and monetary crisis, are
reflected in the continuing decline of the Soviet Union's economic
position,'' said the study.
   ``The survival prospects for economic reforms in the Soviet
Union _ now admitted by the leadership to be in a `state of crisis'
_ become increasingly doubtful,'' said the study. It was done by
economic analysts of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   The report compared economic reforms in China and the Soviet
Union, based on information up to July. It was given to NATO
foreign ministers in December.
   The analysts said no Communist nation has succeeded in
transforming a centrally planned economy to a flourishing
free-market system.
   The key reason for failure has been the conflicting interests
between the demands for economic reforms and the objectives of
Communist parties and the vested interests of their members, it
said.
   Party members want to ``safeguard the kind of economic
structures _ mostly inefficient ones _ from which substantial
benefits accrue to them,'' it said.
   ``Whenever it came to do or die in past reform efforts, the
party bureaucrats have always put their own interest first, as
reflected once again by recent events in China,'' it said.
   The economic programs in the Soviet Union and China were
hampered from the start by ``unsuitable political institutions,''
it said.
   The analysts predicted that the reform drive in China would lose
further ground.
   ``Its scope has been seriously restricted and its direction
rechanneled toward areas acceptable to the new, more conservative
and suspicious leadership in Beijing,'' it said.
   Future reform efforts would likely be limited to modernization
measures that would increase efficiency somewhat, but they would
not solve ``the deep-rooted real problems of the Chinese economy
and society,'' according to the report.
   It said the governments of Poland and Hungary offered the
prospect of severing the ties between the Communist Party
bureaucracy and its vested interest in obsolete economic structures.
   The countries have been leaders in the moves toward democracy in
Eastern Europe.
   ``Gorbachev's support for these efforts in Hungary and Poland
may be indicative of his own vision of reform,'' the study said.
   Without a political opposition, it said Gorbachev would have to
loosen the Communists' grip on economic structures by going around
the party apparatus in management decisions and giving state
organizations more power.
   It added: ``By trying to maintain the country's `socialist
achievements,' economic reforms in the Soviet Union will remain
piecemeal.''
   ``But piecemeal reforms to a centrally planned economy generate
unpredictable frictions that would not arise if other economic
variables were free to adapt to remove their sting,'' it said.

   A retired police captain has been
charged with shooting to death her husband and retarded son, who
police say may have been killed because his mother planned to
commit suicide and he needed special care.
   Dorothea Sweeten, 66, was arrested Wednesday at her home after a
SWAT negotiator talked her into dropping a pistol she had held to
her head for about an hour.
   She was charged with murdering her husband, Tom, 55, a public
relations employee for the Tennessee Valley Authority and a former
managing editor of The Knoxville Journal, and her son, Charles H.
Forester Jr., 39. She was in jail today on $40,000 bail.
   Police were called to the home after Mrs. Sweeten telephoned a
minister and said she had killed the two and was contemplating
suicide, said sheriff's Detective Mike Lett.
   Mrs. Sweeten told the minister she killed her husband because he
had abused her physically and mentally for years, and killed her
son ``because there would be nobody to take care of him,'' Lett
said.
   Sheriff's Lt. Herman Johnson said Forester lived at home, did
not work and attended a school for the handicapped.
   The minister, Coy Bays, had a secretary notify police while she
kept Mrs. Sweeten on the phone for more than an hour, Lett said.
   ``When they arrived (Mrs. Sweeten) had the gun under her chin,''
Johnson said. ``It was cocked and she had her finger on the
trigger.''
   Mrs. Sweeten retired from the Knoxville police force in 1982
after 28 years.
   Johnson said Mrs. Sweeten had written a suicide note that
claimed hospital records would show she had suffered a broken arm
and ruptured eardrum from her husband's beatings. Johnson said
police had yet to examine the records.

   Three young men were arrested on charges of
shooting an off-duty policeman in a botched attempt to steal $20 to
join a basketball league.
   Officer Troy Patterson, 27, was critically wounded and remained
in a coma from the attack Jan. 16, in which the six-year police
veteran was jumped and shot in the head as he washed his car in
Brooklyn, authorities said.
   ``We believe they were attempting to obtain some monies to
participate in a basketball game that was going to be played,''
Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said Wednesday.
   Police said the alleged triggerman, 15-year-old Tracy Clark,
needed $20 of the $37 entry fee to play in the United Brooklyn
Basketball League.
   Investigators initially discounted robbery as a motive because
the officer's wallet, gun and shield were not taken. Detectives
theorized instead that the shooting was linked to the officer's
arrests or his personal life.
   But the investigation turned around after a tipster reported the
shooting was a robbery gone awry, Borrelli said.
   ``We're pretty sure they weren't aware he was an officer,'' he
said.
   Clark was charged with attempted murder, attempted robbery,
assault and weapons possession Wednesday. Vincent Robbins, 20,
Darien ``Wimpy'' Crawford, 17, were charged with attempted robbery,
assault and weapons possession.
   On Wednesday, one of the suspects, while in custody, wore a
T-shirt that read ``United Brooklyn Basketball League.''

   A Hispanic police officer was free on bond and
predicting his vindication after receiving a seven-year prison term
for the deaths of two blacks. One critic called the sentence
``justice delayed and justice denied.''
   Officer William Lozano thanked his supporters after being
sentenced Wednesday by Circuit Judge Joseph Farina.
   ``My attorney, my family and I will continue to fight within the
system for the truth, for what is right, and at the end, we will
win,'' Lozano said.
   Because of his felony conviction, he faces the automatic loss of
his job and his state certification for police duty, the Police
Department said.
   The city's black neighborhoods, which erupted in riots after the
slayings a year ago, remained calm overnight.
   ``I think we can attribute this to the black community feeling
justice was served,'' police spokesman Raymond Lang said today.
   Lozano, 31, was convicted last month on two counts of
manslaughter for fatally shooteen longer.
   ``I see this as both a case now of justice delayed and justice
denied,'' said Marvin Dunn, a black psychology professor at Florida
International University. ``Seven years does not in fact mean seven
years in prison.''
   But Dunn, who wrote a book on Miami's 1980 race riots, said he
hoped blacks would accept the sentence with equanimity.
   ``What we have to be concerned about is whether or not the
perception of a miscarriage of justice now resurfaces in the black
community,'' Dunn said, urging a ``responsible reaction by all of
us in the black community to accept and live with the judge's
decision.''
   Defense attorneys criticized the case as an effort to ease
racial tensions in Miami rather than give their client a fair trial.
   ``If Officer Lozano was black, he never would have been charged
with a crime,'' defense attorney Mark Seiden told the judge. ``If
the two people on the motorcycle were white, he never would have
been charged with a crime.''
   Prosecutor John Hogan, who recommended a 12-year prison term,
described the sentence as a just one. Lozano could have faced a
punishment of 12 to 17 years in prison under state sentencing
guidelines.
   Miguel Degrandy, a vice president of the Spanish American League
Against Discrimination, said the judge ``fashioned a sentence that
he felt that both parties could live with.
   ``However, this is a no-win case for our community in Dade
County, and there is still going to be unfortunately polarized
reaction,'' he said.
   The shooting on Jan. 16, 1989, sparked three days of racial
violence, the fourth riot in this city in the 1980s. All were
linked to the killing of blacks by police officers, and in two of
the cases, acquittals of the white policemen sparked racial
violence.
   Lozano shot and killed Lloyd as he fled a pursuing squad car
after running a stop sign. Lloyd's passenger Allan Blanchard, 24,
died of injuries suffered in the subsequent motorcycle crash.
   Ray Fauntroy, head of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference, said he was disappointed by the sentence.
   ``We get seven years just for stealing a loaf of bread,'' the
civil rights leader said. ``This officer was just given a pat on
the back. He'll be out in two or three years.''
   The sentence was average for someone convicted of manslaughter,
said Miami police spokesman Sgt. David Rivero.
   ``This is a democratic system, and we (police officers) have to
accept that,'' he said.

   Two thousand subway passengers, used to nothing
more surprising than an occasional kazoo-playing panhandler, found
themselves headed for the wrong part of town when a novice motorman
hit the wrong button.
   The train to Jamaica became a train to Long Island City _ those
are two sections of the sprawling borough of Queens _ during the
height of the rush hour Tuesday evening.
   It happened when the unidentified motorman punched the wrong
``route request'' button at Rockefeller Center in Manhattan,
switching his train off the F line and onto the Q line. Both lines
head toward Queens, but by different routes.
   ``It's like getting off on the wrong exit on the Long Island
Expressway,'' said Robert Previdi, a Transit Authority spokesman.
   Officials said there was no danger of collision with another
train.
   The driver recognized his error at the next stop, announced it
and let passengers off to catch a train back to Rockefeller Center
to get a proper F train, Previdi said.
   He said the motorman might be given some retraining.

<HEAD>Soldiers Leaving Few Wounded, Many Dead, Refugees Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE FAUL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberian soldiers accused of killing
hundreds of unarmed civilians are leaving few survivors in their
wake as they scour the countryside looking for rebels, medical
workers and diplomats said today.
   The reports, based on harrowing accounts by refugees, indicate
that the mass killings are so thorough and indiscriminate that very
few wounded are left behind.
   ``They tell really horrendous stories of soldiers spraying
entire villages with .50-caliber machine guns,'' said a Western
diplomat who requested anonymity. Bullets from such heavy weapons
tear huge holes into bodies.
   The diplomat and Ivorian sources estimate at least 500 civilians
have been killed in Liberia's eastern Nimba county since soldiers
were deployed to halt a Dec. 24 rebel incursion.
   ``The refugees say there are not many wounded people because the
soldiers slaughtered so many,'' said the diplomat.
   He visited refugees Tuesday with Ivorian government officials,
aid workers and other diplomats from nations giving food, medicine
and money to alleviate a food shortage.
   An ongoing stream of refugees was estimated today to number more
than 60,000. Between 12,000 and 15,000 other Liberians have sought
refuge in Guinea, the diplomat said.
   At the Ivorian border village of Danane, refugees dash
desperately to hide in forests when they hear the staccato of
machine gunfire that sounds daily from across the frontier in
Liberia.
   ``They are traumatized by the combat and watching some of their
relatives being killed,'' said Claude Regnier, a French adviser to
the Ivorian government who heads a committee coordinating refugee
aid.
   ``They are still in shock. When the gunfire starts, they rush to
the forest and come out of the bush only when it stops,'' he said
in an interview.
   A Western diplomat said the killings began after rebels from the
Gio tribe stepped up attacks in an attempt to oust Liberian
President Samuel Doe, who seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that
ousted the descendants of freed American slaves who founded the
West African nation in 1847. The Gio long have felt oppressed by
Doe's Krahn people.
   ``It started with Gio rebels attacking military outposts in
their own ethnic heartland in Nimba county,'' the diplomat said on
condition of anonymity. ``The army came in and just went nuts
because everyone looks like a rebel to them. There has been some
very heavy-handed slaughter.''
   The rebels retaliated about 10 days ago by moving south into
traditional Krahn territory and began slaughtering civilians there,
according to the diplomat. That has caused a second wave of victims
to flee east into Ivory Coast and north into Guinea, he said.
   The killing continues, the diplomat said, despite a warning from
Doe on Monday that soldiers who harm civilians will face firing
squads.
   Liberian officials say Doe's execution threat is helping to
bring the situation under control.
   Initially, Justice Minister Jenkins Scott said troops killed
only armed civilians who attacked them.
   One Western diplomat conceded it might be difficult for troops
to identify rebels, who do not wear military uniforms.
   Regnier said 40 percent of refugees are women and children, 30
percent boys and youths and the remainder men.
   Doctors said refugees hospitalized in Ivory Coast include a
5-year-old girl shot in the leg.
   At Man hospital, a regional health center 75 miles from Danane,
director Dr. Maurice Kouame said his staff is treating only eight
seriously wounded Liberians.

   Long-distance telephone services that charge
the unwary $30 to $50 for information they could get for free head
a list of telemarketing scams that an anti-fraud group predicted
today will flower during the 1990s.
   The costly abuse of ``900'' area code telephone service was just
one of several increasingly popular consumer frauds compiled by the
Alliance Against Fraud in Telemarketing.
   ``Our aim is to forewarn consumers so they can forearmed against
fraud,'' said Linda Golodner, executive director of the National
Consumers League, which coordinates the alliance.
   ``While the alliance recognizes that many products and services
are sold legitimately through telemarketing, we want to warn
consumers that con artists are making these types of offers through
high-pressure sales pitches providing little concrete
information,'' she said.
   In another scam on the alliance's list, unsuspecting consumers
get official-looking envelopes that appear to be from a government
agency but actually are peddling various fraudulent schemes.
   Currently, such look-alike envelopes are not illegal, Tom
McClure of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, said at a news
conference sponsored by the alliance. ``A con artist is only
limited by his imagination,'' he said.
   The alliance is a wide-ranging coalition of more than 60
consumer groups, trade associations, state and federal agencies,
businesses, news organizations and labor unions.
   Among the scams cited by the alliance were:
   _900 phone numbers that keep callers on hold, racking up toll
charges, before giving generic information that could be obtained
for free elsewhere about how to obtain or re-establish credit.
   _Bogus health-care promotions for phony arthritis and baldness
remedies, sexual aids and weight-loss plans.
   _One-shot credit cards, good only for purchasing goods from one
specific department store or catalog although they are deceptively
promoted as an all-purpose bank credit card such as MasterCard or
VISA.
   _False claims by timeshare agents who charge up to $400 to
resell a consumer's unit, promising to pay a worthless penalty as a
guarantee if they don't sell the unit within a year.
   ``It's an epidemic. There's about $10 billion in telemarketing
fraud a year,'' Kansas Securities Commissioner Doug Mays said in a
telephone interview Wednesday.
   Mays said ``boiler rooms'' _ organized scam efforts promising
ridiculously high profits through high pressure sales tactics and
banks of telephones _ now are moving offshore.
   Mays calls such boiler rooms ``the crack houses of consumer
fraud.''
   Once based largely in Florida and later Colorado, Mays said
boiler room scams for precious metals and high-risk penny stocks
are now being phoned in to this country from Costa Rica, the Cayman
Islands, Panama and Africa.
   ``Even as far inland as Kansas, we're getting calls from Liberia
and South Africa,'' said May, who next year will be president of
the North American Securities Administrators Association, an
organization of state-level securities regulators.
   ``In order not to become victims, consumers must be able to tell
the difference between fraudulent offers that come over the
telephone and legitimate ones,'' said Ms. Golodner.
   They can do that by asking questions, getting answers in writing
and contacting consumer protection agencies when they don't know
anything about the salesperson or the product, she said.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament passed a law today that
limits the powers of the secret police. The new restrictions came
in response to reports that security services routinely spied on
legal opposition parties.
   The legislation stipulates that covert intelligence gathering
will be permitted only when ``the security of the nation, the
sovereignty of the country and its constitutional order are
endangered by secret activities.''
   The vote was 279 for, none against and 14 abstentions.
   Also, two government officials _ Interior Minister State
Secretary Zoltan Gal and Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar _ were
given responsibility for intelligence operations.
   Introducing the bill, entitled ``Temporary Regulation of the Use
of Special Secret Service Methods and Means,'' Gal told Parliament
on Wednesday that intelligence agencies had had little past
supervision when Hungary was a one-party Communist state.
   The interim legislation was hurriedly introduced following a
national uproar over revelations that the state security service
was spying on scores of people, including some members of
Parliament. Gal said a permanent and comprehensive bill governing
the activities of the security services will be presented in
Parliament in February.
   The scandal broke Jan. 5, when representatives of two opposition
organizations presented reporters with secret documents leaked to
them by a member of the secret police.
   Secret police targets of intelligence gathering included
opposition parties and personalities, writers and religious
figures, according to the documents.
   Chief Public Prosecutor Karoly Szijarto disclosed Wednesday that
the illegal eavesdropping was even more widespread than originally
thought.
   Szijarto told the legislature the internal security department
of the Interior Ministry even spied on the Socialist Party, its
predecessor, the Socialist Workers' Party and other Communist or
leftist organizations. The investigation is still under way.
   While claiming to have had no knowledge of such practices,
Interior Minister Istvan Horvath resigned Tuesday, telling
legislators that ``in a democracy that is the custom.''
   Hungary formally became a multiparty state Oct. 23, and the
first free elections since 1948 are scheduled for March 25.
Although the Socialist Party asserts it was uninvolved, the scandal
is believed to have hurt its chances at the polls because it
happened under its tenure.
   The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the biggest opposition party,
already has signaled its opposition to the idea of a future
coalition with the Socialists, in a clear indication of the party's
desire to distance itself from what it considers a political
liability.
   The interim law also changed the name of the main intelligence
agency from the State Security Service to National Security Service.
   Gal said the move was meant as a signal ``that the secret
service organs no longer serve the state organizatio, but have as
their primary aim the security of the entire nation and
constitutional order.''
   Premier Miklos Nemeth subsequently appointed Gal as interim head
of the Interior Ministry, while Parliament agreed to name Kulcsar
director of the National Security Service.

   MOSCOW (AP)_ A Baltic nationalist group said today that an
Armenian organization has accepted an invitation to attend peace
talks aimed at ending ethnic conflict with the neighboring republic
of Azerbaijan.
   There was no word on whether an Azerbaijani delegation would
attend the talks, planned Monday in the Latvian capital, Riga.
   The attempt to arrange negotiations was the latest effort to end
two weeks of violence that began with anti-Armenian riots in
Azerbaijan and has grown into a drive for secession by some
Azerbaijanis.
   Communist leaders in Azerbaijan today blamed their former leader
for the crisis and expelled him from the party. More Soviet troops
were reported killed in attacks by militants in Azerbaijan's
capital, Baku.
   At least 171 people have been killed since the unrest began Jan.
13.
   In a telephone interview today from Riga, Anda Anspoka of the
Latvian People's Front said the group received a letter of
confirmation from the Armenian People's Front to attend a peace
conference Monday.
   The Armenian group authorized its representatives to ``sign any
documents'' to end the ethnic strife, Ms. Anspoka said.
   A spokesman for the nationalist Azerbaijani People's Front, Usus
Samed Ogli, said today his group had not decided if it will attend.
   Ogli said the Azerbaijani front leaders had gone underground out
of fear they would be arrested and planned to meet in secret Friday
to decide whether to attend the talks.
   Ms. Anspoka said the talks would be mediated by leaders of
People's Front groups in the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania,
and Estonia. Like the groups in Azerbaijan and Armenia, the
People's Front groups support autonomy for their republics.
   Their causes would not be helped by nationalist unrest requiring
Kremlin military intervention, which explains in part the Baltics'
eagerness to settle the dispute. Successful mediation also would
give prestige to the Baltic People's Front groups.
   In addition, the Baltics are not interested in seeing their
young men drafted into military service to control the conflict.
   Azerbaijan's Central Committee convened at 11 p.m. Wednesday and
ousted Abdul-Rakham Vezirov, who was named party leader during
Azerbaijani-Armenian unrest in May 1988. He was given a mandate to
restore order after a long-running dispute between Azerbaijanis and
Armenians erupted.
   The conflict involves the region of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is
under the control of Azerbaijan _ a mainly Shiite Moslem republic _
but populated by Armenians, who are mostly Christians. Armenia
wants to annex the region.
   Vezirov, a former diplomat and career party official, was
expelled from the party for ``serious mistakes'' that led to the
current crisis, said Baku journalist Tunzala Kasumova. Vezirov had
been removed as party chief earlier in the week.
   Vezirov was replaced by Ayaz Mutalibov, the republic's prime
minister.
   Meanwhile, Tass said militant nationalists were continuing
attacks on Soviet troops, who entered Baku on Saturday. It said two
soldiers were killed Wednesday and one seriously wounded.
   Strikes continued in the city in defiance of a military ban, and
public transport was at a standstill, Tass said.
   Azerbaijanis have pledged not to end their strikes until Soviet
troops withdraw.
   The harbor at Baku, a Caspian Sea port of 1.8 million, was
reported calm today following reports of a harbor fight Wednesday
between military troops and Azerbaijanis blocking the waterway.
   The military commander of Baku, Lt. Gen. Vladimir Dubinyak, said
in a radio announcment today that occasional gunfire rang out
during the night at the port but that no one was killed.
   He said authorities detained more than 100 people during the
night, 68 for curfew violations.
   Leila Yunusova, an Azerbaijani activist, said 100,000 of
Azerbaijan's 380,000 Communists have torn up their party cards _
signaling growing resentment of central authorities in Moscow for
ordering the crackdown.
   On Wednesday, soldiers rounded up 43 activists and banned
rallies in Baku.
   Tass today cited Baku Radio as saying troops had detained Mamed
Ali-Zade, chairman of the Defense Committee of the Azerbaijani
People's Front.
   It said he possessed various weapons, ``symbols of the popular
front, medicines, radio equipment and propaganda materials calling
on the population to resist authorities.''
   The Communist Party daily Pravda said 400 dependents of ethnic
Russian servicemen were flown out of Azerbaijan on Wednesday night,
because of fears that Azerbaijanis angry over the troop deployment
would turn on them.
   About 100,000 ethnic Russians live in Baku.
   Pravda said the refugees were being taken to military facilities
and public buildings in Moscow and Kiev and that others are being
housed by the Black Sea fleets.
   On Wednesday, Tass reported, the Soviet military evacuated more
than 16,000 wives and children of soldiers from the region because
of increasing threats against Soviet troops.
   Anti-Armenians riots in Baku on Jan. 13 escalated into armed
clashes between groups of Azerbaijanis and Armenians. Thousands of
Armenians fled as nationalist extremists gained strength in
Azerbaijan, and militant Azerbaijanis began fighting Soviet troops
who were deployed to restore order.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today declared that Libya
remains ``an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security'' of the United States as he renewed existing sanctions
against the Tripoli government.
   Bush made the declaration in a semiannual report to Congress
required by the national emergency status that the United States
has had with regard to Libya since Jan. 7, 1986.
   The United States bans trade with Libya and bars travel by
Americans there, unless an exemption is granted by the Treasury
Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.
   ``The policies and actions of the government of Libya continue
to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national
security and foreign policy of the United States. I shall continue
to exercise the powers at my disposal to apply economic sanctions
against Libya as long as these measures are appropriate,'' Bush
said in the report.
   He said that in the last six months, the U.S. government has
issued ``a limited number of specific licenses to individuals and
corprations to permit them to engage in activities that would
otherwise be prohibited.''
   The sanctions and trade embargo were imposed by former President
Reagan, who declared Libya a terrorist nation.

   A ladle containing more than 100 tons
of molten steel crashed to the floor at a new mill, scattering
2,850-degree metal and injuring six workers, at least one
seriously, authorities said.
   ``It looked like what happens when water is dropped on a hot
skillet,'' Crawfordsville Fire Chief Dennis Weir said after
Wednesday's accident at the Nucor Corp.
   Michael Hinz, who suffered minor injuries, said he was driving a
crane, guiding the ladle, when a cable broke and the ladle dropped
30 feet.
   ``When it hit, steel splashed, knocking a hole in one wall. A
blast of heat knocked out another wall in the furnace room,'' Hinz
said. He said the concussion blew him off his seat, and slag
shattered his crane window.
   ``I thought it was all over,'' he said. ``I guess if there's a
nightmare, that's a crane operator's nightmare.''
   About 35 firefighters used extinguishers to put out burning
debris, including bags, crates, boxes and other packing materials,
Weir said.
   About 300 employees work at the $270 million plant, which
processes scrap metal such as used automobile bodies into new steel.
   Pat Major, 37, of Valparaiso, an employee of a contractor at the
plant, was in serious condition today at Methodist Hospital in
Indianapolis, where he was being treated for burns over 70 percent
of his body, a spokeswoman said.
   Another worker was listed in stable conditon at AMI Culver Union
Hospital in Crawfordsville. Four other workers were treated there
and released.
   Keith Busse, vice president and general manager of the plant,
which opened last year, said the mill would remain closed until the
weekend while siding over a 40-hole in the wall is replaced and
equipment checked out.

   Two helicopters rescued all 23 crew members
Thursday from a 7,027-ton Liberian cargo vessel that was taking on
water off western Japan, the coast guard said.
   The crewmen from Hong Kong, the Philippines, Burma, China and
Britain all were in good condition after being rescued from the
Maritime Gardenia, said Toshikazu Ito, spokesman of the Maritime
Safety Agency's regional headquarters in Maizuru, western Japan.
   The ship was in the Japan Sea, less than a mile from western
Japan's Kyoto prefecture, when it radioed for help shortly after
midnight Wednesday, Ito said.
   Waves of 10 feet were reported in the area, he added.
   Two helicopters from the Air Self Defense Force's Komatsu base
took the crew members to Komatsu, 190 miles northwest of Tokyo, Ito
said.
   The Maritime Gardenia was heading for a dockyard in Yamaguchi
prefecture in southwestern Japan after unloading Malaysian lumber
in a western Japan port, he said.

<HEAD>Queen Greeting Ceausescu Cut From Official Danish Film</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has recalled a film
from its embassies to cut out a sequence showing Queen Margrethe II
in 1980 greeting Nicolae Ceausescu, whom she later awarded
Denmark's highest honor, officials said Thursday.
   ``A Living Queen,'' a 28-minute film about the royal family, was
distributed to foreign missions as archive material for TV stations.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacob Benthien said the 90-second
sequence ordered expunged showed the queen welcoming Ceausescu
during a state visit.
   ``It's obvious that no one wants publicity for a monarchy with
such an awarding ceremony,'' Benthien said. ``No one was happy with
that clip.''
   Ceausescu, who was overthrown and executed last month, was given
Denmark's Knight of the Order of the Elephant.
   After Ceausescu was deposed, the Royal Palace announced that his
name was being stricken from the list of knights. The queen also
canceled the Order of the Knight of the Great Cross, which she gave
to Ceausescu's wife, Elena.
   Ceausescu, Romania's hard-line leader for 24 years, was looked
upon favorably by Western nations for many years because he steered
his Communist country on a path independent of Moscow. He received
honors from other Western nations, including Britain, but they were
stripped from him when he was toppled.
   Another scene from the Danish film that was cut showed the queen
smoking a cigarette while listening to a speech by Prince Consort
Henrik during a 1979 visit to China.
   The entire film will be replaced after the festivities marking
the queen's 50th birthday on April 16, Benthien said.

<TEXT>
   Western buyers are paying nearly $30,000 for
large segments of the Berlin Wall, an East German newspaper said
Thursday.
   Helge Moebius, an official of the East German foreign trade
company Limex-Bau, told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper that the
2.7-ton segments of the wall are bringing between $11,800 and
$29,400 each.
   The newspaper did not say how many pieces have been sold so far.
   The cement wall sections, each about 10 feet high and six feet
wide, are being sold to collectors from the United States, Britain,
West Germany and other Western countries, the newspaper said.
   Asked why the pieces of wall were so expensive, Ms. Moebius said
that tearing down the wall and replacing it with a six-foot-high
metal fence costs about $47,000 per kilometer, or six-tenths of a
mile.
   East German border guards began tearing down a 325-yard section
of the graffiti-covered wall Monday night near West Berlin's
Kreuzberg district in the southeastern part of the city.
   Large segments of the wall earlier had been removed from
Brandenburg Gate and the Potsdamerplatz where new border crossings
have been opened.
   Profits from sale of the wall are to be used for humanitarian
purposes, Ms. Moebius was quoted as saying, such as improving
medical facilities and care of memorial sites in East Germany.
   The Berlin Wall, built in 1961 to prevent East Germans from
escaping to the West, was opened in November.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II praised the
Christian heritage of this African nation today as he began an
eight-day tour of the impoverished Sahel region, his sixth
pilgrimage to Africa.
   The pope flew from Rome in a special Alitalia Airbus to Amilcar
Cabral international airport on the 10-island archipelago off
Africa's northwest coast. After two days in the former Portuguese
colony, he heads to Guinea Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad.
   In brief remarks in Portuguese, the pope referred to the
predominantly Roman Catholic islands as a country of ``ancient
Christianity at the gates of continental Africa'' and wished
``grace, salvation and peace'' on Cape Verdians and the many who
emigrated abroad.
   After greetings from several thousand well-wishers, the pope
transferred to a smaller plane for a 40-minute flight to Praia for
the official welcoming ceremony.
   Islanders were out all day sweeping the sand and dust from the
streets blown by strong winds gusting across the archipelago.
   The trip is the 45th foreign voyage of the pope's 11-year
pontificate.
   The countries in the sub-Saharan semi-arid region stretching
across western and central Africa are among the world's poorest,
with millions of people living on the edge of starvation.
   The pope is expected to renew an appeal he made 10 years ago for
international aid to help save sub-Saharan Africa from its chronic
problems of poverty, hunger, disease and encroaching deserts.
   ``This is the poorest part of Africa and the pope will discuss
the realities of these countries,'' said Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro.
   The visit comes at a time when African government and church
leaders are concerned that Western aid and development funds will
be redirected from Africa to the new democrtic movements in Eastern
Europe.
   ``The interest of the Western world is focused on the East, and
there is a risk of forgetting to save one part of humanity that
would fall back into misery,'' Cardinal Paul Zoungrana of Burkina
Faso said in an interview with the Italian Catholic magazine 30
Giorni (30 Days).
   ``This is not the moment to abandon Africa,'' he said. ``The
pope can use his moral strength and attract the attention of the
whole world.''
   Noting that the Polish-born pope himself comes from Eastern
Europe, the cardinal said, ``If a new problem arises, you can't
forget the old ones. And if it's a pope from the East who reminds
us, the world will take note.''
   In a special supplement on the papal trip, the Vatican newspaper
L'Osservatore Romano decried the world's ``indifference'' towards
Africa's problems.
   ``While the eyes of the world are still fixed on the
extraordinary events of Eastern Europe, the heart of the church now
looks elsewhere ... to the vast territory of suffering that is
Africa,'' the newspaper said.
   A centerpiece of the pope's trip will be a ceremony Monday in
Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso, marking the 10th anniversary
of John Paul's appeal for the Sahel in which he declared: ``I can
not remain silent while my brothers and sisters are in danger.''
   The appeal led to the creation in 1984 of the John Paul II
Foundation for the Sahel, funded primarily by contributions from
Catholics in West Germany and sponsoring agricultural and
development projects in the region.
   John Paul, who is scheduled to make another trip to Africa later
this year, is particularly interested in Africa because of the
rapid growth of Catholicism on the continent. The African church
counts more than 75 million followers today, or about 13 percent of
the total population, compared to 1 percent at the turn of the
century.
   About 90 percent of Cape Verde's population of 360,000 is Roman
Catholic, the highest percentage in Africa. However, Catholics are
a small minority in the other countries on the tour, ranging from
less than 1 percent in Mali to 9 percent in Burkina Faso.
   While Cape Verde is the most prosperous of the five nations,
more than 400,000 islanders _ greater than the current population _
have emigrated in recent decades to the United States and Europe in
search of jobs and a better life.

   A Norwegian army captain serving with
United Nations peacekeepers was killed in a car accident in south
Lebanon, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
   Capt. Gunnar Baerhim was killed Wednesday in an accident
involving his jeep and a truck in the southern village of Mari,
said spokesman Timur Goksel.
   Baerhim, 34, was a member of the 683-strong Norwegian battalion
serving with the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.
   The fatality raised the overall death toll of the peacekeeping
force to 167 since it deployed in south Lebanon in March 1978.
   The 5,800-member force, drawn from nine nations, staffs a narrow
buffer separating the Israeli-controlled sector of south Lebanon
from the predominantly Shiite Moslem region.
   U.N. records show that only 70 of the force's fatalities were
killed in action, mainly in attacks by various armed groups.

<HEAD>Judge Says Drug-Courier Profile Violates Rights of Blacks,
Hispanics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ruled that a drug courier
profile used to justify searching cars during traffic stops
violates the rights of blacks and Hispanics.
   The country can't pay lip service to the rights of blacks by
honoring Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday and then trample on
their rights through law enforcement, U.S. District Judge Jim R.
Carrigan said Wednesday.
   The traffic stops in Eagle County, west of Denver, violate the
rights of blacks to travel freely and to be protected against
unreasonable searches, he said.
   Sheriff A.J. Johnson testified that race is one of the criteria
used to target suspected drug couriers. Other factors include
having fast-food wrappers on the car floor, having no luggage,
motorists who have driven long distances nonstop and cars with
out-of-state license plates.
   The ruling means federal drug charges against reputed Los
Angeles Crips gang member Louis Laymon probably will be dismissed.
   ``So far the only casualty in the war against drugs has been the
Constitution,'' said Laymon's attorney, David Lane. ``It's nice to
see a judge like Carrigan firing a shot in its defense.''
   Laymon was arrested after Sheriff's Sgt. James Perry found crack
cocaine in his car during a traffic stop on Interstate 70 about 100
miles west of Denver.
   Lane argued that the car was stopped only because Laymon is
black and his car had California plates.
   Laymon acknowledged during a hearing to suppress evidence that
he has been a crack cocaine dealer, but he denied the cocaine found
in the car was his.
   Perry contended he stopped the car for weaving on the highway
and obtained Laymon's permission for the search.
   But Carrigan said Perry used ``trivial traffic violations'' as
an excuse to stop cars for drug searches.

   A U.S. magistrate today ordered a
psychiatric examination for a man accused of trying to hijack an
America West airliner to Cuba.
   U.S. Magistrate Stephen Capelle ordered the examination at the
request of Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Gonzalez' attorney, Bennie Ray.
   Ray said the Cuban native living in New Orleans ``can't carry on
a continued conversation with you without drifting off into a
political realm.''
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 39, is charged with air piracy and assaulting
a flight attendant in the Jan. 16 incident aboard the flight from
Houston to Las Vegas.
   Passengers said he grabbed the flight attendant, claimed he had
a bomb and demanded to go to Cuba. The pilot, saying he had to
re-fuel, landed the Boeing 737 in Austin, where Gonzalez-Gonzalez
was jumped and subdued.
   According to Ray, Gonzalez-Gonzalez believes law enforcement
officials are after him because he has a tape recording on the
death of former New Orleans mayor Ernest ``Dutch'' Morial. He died
Christmas Eve of a heart attack.

   President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia
called today for a unified Europe that incorporates Soviet bloc
countries that are adopting democratic reforms and market-oriented
economies.
   Havel, presenting his vision of a unified Europe to Poland's
National Assembly, said a joint effort to ``return to Europe''
would avoid rivalries among emerging democracies seeking admission
to the political and economic alliances of Western Europe.
   ``We should not compete in who is going to overtake whom and who
will first win a seat in some European body, but we should do just
the opposite: help each other,'' said the playwright and longtime
dissident who became Czechoslovakia's president after a peaceful
pro-democracy movement in November.
   Havel was greeted today at Warsaw's Military Airport by
Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski, senior government
officials, a full military honor guard and the diplomatic corps.
   Havel appeared uncomfortable and unaccustomed to the ceremonial
greeting.
   He seemed startled when the precision honor guard shouted in
unison at him, ``Hail to Mr. President!''
   To lawmakers, Havel said: ``Western Europe is much more advanced
in integration processes and if we were to return to Europe
individually, it would certainly take much longer and it would be
much more complicated than if we act together.''
   ``This does not only concern economics. It concerns everything
including disarmament talks,'' he said.
   Havel said a power vacuum has existed in Central Europe since
the end of World War I and that countries of the region ``until
recently colonized by the Soviets'' should unite into a new
``formation.''
   Havel said it ``is hard to forecast the institutional shape that
our East European or Central European cooperation will create.''
   He proposed that representatives of Poland and Hungary come to
Czechoslovakia to discuss the form of such cooperation. Observers
from other Eastern European countries could also attend the talks,
he said.
   Havel takes his proposal to Hungary on Friday.
   Havel was warmly received in the parliament chamber.
   The audience chuckled when he recalled a secret meeting with
Czechoslovak and Polish dissidents along the mountainous
Polish-Czechoslovak border in 1978.
   Havel recalled how he and the three Polish dissidents, who now
are lawmakers, laughed back then about being able to duck
authorities to hold the meeting.
   ``If someone had told us then that in 12 years we would be
deputies, ministers and presidents, then we would have laughed even
more,'' Havel said.
   Earlier, Havel had private talks with Jaruzelski, the only
Communist leader not ousted during the wave of revolution that
swept the Soviet Union's six East European allies in 1989.
   With Solidarity's tacit assistance, Jaruzelski was elected
president to oversee a stable transition to a fully democratic
Poland.
   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki visited Prague on
Monday in an effort to strengthen Polish-Czechoslovak ties.
   Polish politicians have argued that the two countries, situated
between a powerful Soviet Union and a potentially powerful and
reunited Germany, should cooperate to avoid domination by their
neighbors.
   During the 1980s, the Solidarity opposition that now leads
Poland's government forged close relations with Czechoslovakia's
dissident movement now in power in Prague.
   But government relations are strained by controversies over
environmental issues and restrictions on Poles at Czechoslovak
border crossings.
   In addition, there is a popular tradition of rivalry between
Poles and Czechs, neighboring Slavic peoples.

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A radical political leader was
reported missing today, five days after the military government
declared a state of siege and arrested, beat and exiled several
critics.
   Rockefeller Guerre, head of the leftist Union of Patriotic
Democrats party and an outspoken critic of Haiti's ruler, Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril, was reported missing by his wife.
   ``I haven't heard from my husband since Monday, and I am worried
because he always told me he would never go into hiding,'' Mrs.
Guerre said in an interview.
   Since declaring a 30-day state of siege Saturday, the military
government has arrested and beaten more than 50 political leaders
and militants. Most have been released, but five prominent civic
and political leaders and two radical militants were exiled to the
United States and France.
   Mrs. Guerre said she believed her husband could have been
arrested. She said the house they had lived in before recently
moving to the suburbs was plundered Sunday, and several servants
were arrested.
   At a news conference last week, Guerre characterized the Avril
government as ``excremental'' after unidentified individuals
smeared human excrement on the headquarters of several opposition
parties.
   Rumors and confusion have spread in this city of 1 million and
anxiety has risen since all independent radio stations ceased
broadcasting local news reports Tuesday after the government told
them they could only broadcast officially approved news. Radio is
the main source of news in Haiti.
   Also today, an official of the French Embassy said French
Ambassador Jean Raphael Dufour met with Avril on Wednesday to
protest the government crackdown.
   A U.S. Embassy official said Ambassador Alvin Adams met with
Avril on Tuesday to discuss American policy toward Haiti.
   Both officials spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   In Washington on Wednesday the State Department called the
clampdown ``outrageous'' and ``indefensible.''
   Antoine Izmery, a major importer, executive member of the
Chamber of Commerce and outspoken government critic, became the
seventh prominent Haitian to be banished when he was placed aboard
a Miami-bound commercial flight Wednesday night.
   The Chamber of Commerce denounced the crackdown in a statement
Wednesday, saying ``Banishment is a crime against humanity.''
   The others exiled included prominent conservative Hubert de
Ronceray; Dr. Louis Roy, considered the father of Haiti's
constitution; Communist Party deputy leader Max Bourjolly; and
leftist militants Abby Brun, Michel Legros and Max Montreuil.
   The state of siege came the day after mystery gunmen killed army
Col. Andre Neptune, his wife and a servant. Critics accused Avril
of using the assassination as a pretext to crack down on the
opposition and renege on promises to hold free elections in October.
   Haiti's 10 bishops met this morning in the capital to discuss
the crisis.

<HEAD>Electronic Darkroom to Become AP's Basic Photo Receiver</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press announced Thursday that it
is switching to electronic darkrooms as its basic photo receivers,
accelerating the conversion of the nation's newspapers to
PhotoStream, AP's picture-a-minute digital photo delivery highway.
   In the third quarter of this year, AP will begin replacing
LaserPhoto receivers at 950 newspapers that receive AP photos with
the AP Leaf Picture Desk, a microprocessor-based electronic
darkroom developed by AP and Leaf Systems of Natick, Mass., said
Louis D. Boccardi, AP president and general manager.
   ``This is a major step into the electronic future, for us and
for our newspaper members,'' Boccardi said. ``This revolutionizes
picture handling. The darkroom enormously improves photo
reproduction quality and opens the door to production efficiencies
and ultimately pagination of pictures in the nation's newspapers.''
   He said that installation of the darkrooms would be done by
region and would take two years from the start of the project.
   AP announced plans for PhotoStream in 1987 and has tested
aspects of the high-speed digital collection and delivery system at
newspapers during the past year. A prototype transmitted photos
from the World Series and the Malta summit and will be used at the
Super Bowl.
   The PhotoStream delivery network incorporates a high-capacity
satellite circuit and digital technology.
   AP's present LaserPhoto delivery system transmits black and
white photos in nine minutes and color in 30 minutes. PhotoStream
transmits black and white in less than one minute and color in less
than three.
   AP's original PhotoStream plans called for replacement of the
current nine-minute AP LaserPhoto receiver with a two-minute
receiver. Newspapers who wished to buy darkrooms could have done so.
   ``As the AP experimented further with electronic darkrooms, it
became clear that we should opt for the technology of the future,
not an updated version of the technology of the past,'' Boccardi
said.
   John Reid, AP vice president and director of communications and
technology, said that PhotoStream subscribers will have the option
of receiving an expanded photo report or the same report they
receive today. The PhotoStream report also will provide more color
and a greater selection of photos.
   If a paper chooses, it can buy the AP VAX Picture Desk, a system
that incorporates Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX computer
technology.
   Both the AP Leaf Picture Desk and the AP VAX Picture Desk
include a disk storage device with the capacity for hundreds of
images and a terminal with monitor and keyboard. The electronic
darkrooms will work with virtually all conventional scanning and
screening devices and will have the capability, with additional
hardware, of receiving the newspaper's local pictures.
   Each system is fast and easy to use, can handle analog and
digital reception and can operate as a single workstation or be
expanded _ with newspaper-purchased options _ to a network of
editing stations. Storage and ports are also easily expandable with
newspaper-purchased options. Both systems have output capability
for both receivers and pagination systems, Reid said.
   If a newspaper does not want an electronic darkroom, AP will
install its new two-minute LaserPhoto receiver. The newspaper also
will have the option of purchasing a darkroom other than the AP
Leaf or AP VAX Picture Desks.
   ``We have a flexible system here,'' said Hal Buell, AP assistant
general manager for NewsPhotos. ``It will fit the kind of picture
handling arrangement that individual newspapers want.
   ``AP's decision to use the electronic darkroom as its basic
photo receiver opens the door to the world of electronic picture
handling for our members,'' Buell said.
   The relationship between AP and Leaf Systems began in 1988 when
AP helped develop and became the exclusive distributor of the AP
Leafax 35, a portable negative transmitter.
   The two companies decided recently to collaborate on the AP Leaf
Picture Desk. The two companies also recently agreed to provide the
AP Leafspooler, which allows a photographer to store and transmit
pictures that have been processed in the AP Leafax 35.

   For the third consecutive week, ABC`s ``Good

according to A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates released Thursday.
   In what has become a tight morning-show battle since Jane Pauley
left as co-host of ``Today'' last month, ABC's show averaged a 4.4
rating, ``Today'' a 3.9, and ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.5. Each
ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   An ABC spokeswoman said the victory of ``Good Morning America''
was the first time the show had won three consecutive weeks since
fall of 1987. But a ``Today'' spokeswoman expressed optimism that
NBC's show would again be No. 1, saying ``it's only a matter of

<TEXT>
   A windstorm struck two sleeping
communities before dawn today and injured at least 24 people,
including a boy pulled from the wreckage by a passer-by who
witnesses said lifted a corner of a mobile home.
   David Coggins, county Emergency Management Agency director, said
the violent winds, described by some as a tornado, hit trailer
communities at Centenary and Fuller's Crossroads, some 40 miles
from Montgomery, about 5:30 a.m.
   About a dozen trailer homes at Centenary were torn from cinder
block foundations or ripped open. Furniture, clothes, food, dolls
and insulation were strewn about. All the reported injuries were at
Centenary.
   ``We had to take wreckers and pull off the mobile homes to get
people out,'' Coggins said. Everyone apparently was accounted for,
he said.
   Lee Helms, state operations manager for the Alabama emergency
office, said the damage appeared to have been caused by a tornado.
No tornado showed up on radar, but that is not unusual with such
thunderstorms, he said.
   Nancy Williams, a spokeswoman for Crenshaw County hospital, said
three children among the 24 injured suffered serious head injuries
and were transferred to a Montgomery hospital.
   Michael Wells, 31, was credited with rescuing several of the
injured, including a boy pinned under a trailer. Witnesses said
Wells lifted the trailer corner by himself.
   ``The boy was screaming and his head was bloody,'' said Wells,
who was hospitalized for a back injury. ``I picked it up but I
don't know how. I had to do it. Somebody had to help.''
   John Lee, administrator for Crenshaw County Hospital, said Wells
was ``instrumental in pulling several of the people out. After he
pulled them out, he collapsed.''
   Wells said he had planned to return to his hometown of Racine,
Wis., this week after working in Alabama for several months. He
said he was walking between two trailers when a tornado hit.
   ``I saw it coming and the trailers just started rolling like
toys,'' he said. Searching for the trapped victims, he said, ``all
I could do was tell the to scream so I could find them, it was so
dark.''

<HEAD>Survey: Many Older Americans Want Work and They're Not That Picky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1.9 million older Americans wish
they were back in the work force, and they aren't just interested
in ``cushy'' jobs where they can pick their hours and name their
pay, a private group reported Thursday.
   The Commonwealth Fund, a philanthropic foundation, said a
national survey of Americans ages 50-64 found there is an available
labor pool of older people that is far larger, more qualified, more
flexible and more committed than previously believed.
   ``This untapped older labor force could be one very important
answer to the future labor shortage,'' said Thomas W. Moloney,
senior vice president of the foundation. ``What we see here are
capable, educated, experienced people who want to get back in.''
   Moloney said the report should help dispel the conventional
wisdom among employers that most older Americans want only ``cushy
jobs'' and that there are few qualified workers in the group who
have realistic job expectations.
   The findings are based on a 1989 national survey by Louis Harris
and Associates Inc. of 1,751 men aged 55-64 and 1,758 women aged
50-59. The different age groups for men and women were selected to
catch them at the times when people traditionally drop out of the
work force.
   The results were analyzed for The Commonwealth Fund by ICF Inc.,
a Washington consulting firm, which concluded that 1.9 million
older Americans, about 24 percent of non-workers in the surveyed
age groups, say they are able and willing to go back to work.
   ICF identified 1.1 million of these people as highly committed
to rejoining the labor force. These people said they need a job for
financial reasons, are physically able to do key tasks such as
driving or using a calculator, are seeking work and have reasonable
wage expectations, are willing to work under difficult conditions,
and are willing to take jobs that are in demand such as sales, word
processing, clerical positions, day care and managerial posts.
   These retirees had education, job skills and experience largely
comparable to those of their counterparts still in the work force,
the poll found.
   Seventy-five percent were high school or college graduates,
compared to 85 percent of those still working. Sixty-four percent
had five or more years of experience on their last job, compared to
77 percent of current older workers.
   On the subject of work conditions, 83 percent were willing to
take seasonal jobs, 60 percent would work standing up, 73 percent
would work alone, 60 percent would commute more than 30 minutes and
54 percent would work evenings and weekends.
   Moloney said the polling data has not yet been fully analyzed to
determine why these people left the work force before age 65, but
preliminary results indicate many were forced out of their jobs.

   Lightning injured at least 11 people
trying to push snowbound cars from a factory parking lot this
morning, authorities said.
   At least two people were reported in serious condition.
   ``The bolt hit a telephone pole next to the plant. It conducted
itself through the snow,'' said Art Beck, president of Precision
Twist Drill Co. in this Chicago suburb. ``There were sparks coming
through their fingers.''
   At the time, workers were trying to help overnight employees
leave by freeing their cars from six inches of newly fallen snow.
The lightning was part of a storm that blasted northern Illinois
with rain, heavy snow and high winds this morning.
   Police said 11 people were taken to hospitals. Four were treated
for cardiac problems, said Carol Weisbruch, community service
police officer.
   Tia Zeek, a spokeswoman for Memorial Hospital in Woodstock, said
three victims were in good condition and two others were admitted
for observation.
   At Northern Illinois Medical Center in McHenry, two people were
admitted in serious condition, said spokeswoman Judith Irwin. Two
others were in the emergency room, one under observation and the
other in fair condition, she said.
   Dan McCullen, director of human resources at Precision Twist,
which manufactures high-speed drill bits, said he was in the
building at the time of the strike. ``It scared the living
daylights out of me,'' he said.
   Some of the injured complained of tingling in their necks and
hands, he said.

   A ferocious storm with winds reaching 90 mph
lashed Britain today, killing at least 18 people, paralyzing rail
and air transportation and leaving highways littered with
overturned cars, police said.
   All British Rail stations in London were closed except for
Victoria Station, Scotland Yard said. The few trains operating in
southern England were restricted to 20 mph, British Rail said.
   Several highways, including the six-lane M25 freeway circling
the capital, were blocked by overturned trucks, and service on two
subways lines was disrupted by fallen tree limbs. Scottish police
warned motorists to stay off the roads if possible.
   The dead included two children killed when the storm severely
damaged their schools _ one near Bristol in western England and the
other near Swindon, 70 miles west of London.
   Several deaths were caused by tree limbs crashing down on cars,
and two men working on the restoration of a 17th century house at
Uppark were killed when scaffolding was knocked down, according to
Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency.
   British Airways suspended flights from Heathrow airport this
afternoon. At Gatwick airport south of London, a spokeswoman said
only four flights had been affected. She said winds at Gatwick were
clocked at 70 mph.
   Ferry service across the English Channel was suspended,
according to the Coast Guard office at Dover.
   An estimated 250,000 residents of western England were reported
without electric power.
   Thames Valley police reported that at least 16 trucks had
overturned on the M4 motorway west of London.
   ``The motorway has basically closed itself,'' a police spokesman
said.
   ``How anyone considers themselves to be a professional driver
can drive ... in this weather _ we have had reports of some going
along on two wheels _ there is only one word for it: lunatic'' said
the Thames Valley spokesman, who spoke on condition of not being
identified.
   The central lobby of the House of Commons was closed briefly
after the wind dislodged a piece of masonry from the exterior, but
no injuries were reported.
   A 36-seat plane owned by Capital Airlines was knocked over on to
a wing by a gust at Lulsgate Airport near Bristol in western
England, airport authorities said. The plane had just discharged
its passengers, and the three crew members still on board were not
injured.
   The airport was closed to traffic this afternoon because of high
winds. London to Devon and Cornwall in southwestern England were
canceled after 10 a.m., and a number of trains were on the London
to Cambridge line.
   Winds shattered a window at a school near Southampton, and four
students were treated for deep cuts.
   Three people died in an auto accident Wednesday night in
Scotland, where five inches of snow fell.

   Israeli planes attacked bases belonging to
three Palestinian guerrilla groups in south Lebanon today,
apparently in retaliation for the killing of an Israeli colonel in
a guerrilla ambush, police said.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said one man was
killed and three people were wounded.
   Four jets fired 16 rockets in two attacks on bases of the
Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the Palestine Liberation Front, and
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.
   In Jerusalem, Israeli officials confirmed only an attack on a
base of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council. The military command said
in a statement that all Israeli jets returned safely to their bases.
   The bases, about 10 miles east of the port city of Sidon, are in
Kfar Jarra, the Majdalyoun Valley and Mrah el-Hbas. All are near
villages controlled by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council is led by terrorist Abu Nidal,
the Palestinian Liberation Front is headed by Talaat Yacoub, and
the Popular Front is led by George Habash.
   An official of the the pro-Syrian, Marxist Palestine Liberation
Front said the dead man belonged to his group.
   An official of Fatah-Revolutionary Council said that group
suffered no casualities.
   ``We vacated our bases Sunday in anticipation of an Israeli
attack after the heroic operation at Yaroun,'' the official said.
   The raid came five days after guerrillas shot and killed Col.
Yitzhak Rahimov in Yaroun, a city in Israel's self-proclaimed
security zone. He was the highest-ranking Israeli officer to be
killed in Lebanon since Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces in
1985.
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council claimed responsibilty for the attack
at the village of Yaron, one mile north of the international border.
   Abu Nidal split with Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of
the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1973. He has been blamed
for numerous terrorist attacks in Europe and the Middle East.
   The raid was Israel's third on Lebanon this year.
   At least seven people were killed and 18 wounded on Friday in
two raids by Israel against bases of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah and
a Palestinian radio station.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On Halloween night 1988, a man with a broken
nose strolled into a Greek restaurant and ordered a glass of red
wine and a fish dinner. ``I just killed a couple of guys,'' he
remarked between bites. ``The police are coming to get me soon.''
   Andreas Doczy, 51, was not kidding.
   In a saloon up the street, Seamus and Padraig Folan, brothers
who came to America searching for opportunity, had instead found
sudden, irrational, violent death.
   ``There was an argument over the old country,'' Doczy told the
police.
   Testimony at his murder trial, which is in its second week,
helps explain how the Folans died, but not why.
   The Folans _ Seamus, 38, and Padraig, 27 _ came to New York
looking for work. Their native Connemara, a rocky stretch of
western Ireland, has exported its young men and women for more than
150 years.
   The Folans were two of 11 children, 10 of whom came to the
United States in the last decade as the Irish economy sagged. They
found jobs as construction workers and moved into apartments in
Queens and the Bronx.
   Andreas Doczy was from Hungary. He was one of the few members of
his family to survive as the Eastern Front moved rapidly west at
the end of World War II, and he fled during the anti-communist
uprising in 1956 that was crushed by Soviet tanks.
   He later joined the U.S. Air Force and served for five years,
then started his own business. His lawyer describes him as ``very
much a Cold War guy.''
   All of which may or may not help explain what happened that
Halloween night at McGrath's Bar in Astoria, a working class
section of Queens.
   James Gasiorowski, a former policeman, was tending bar. There
were about 10 regulars around, including Doczy and the Folans, who
were drinking with a man named Tommy Hughes.
   The bartender testified last week that the Folans and Hughes
were sitting at the end of the bar when Doczy walked over.
   ``All of a sudden they started arguing with each other. The
Folan Brothers told Andy to leave them alone. ... I went over and
told them to stop arguing.''
   Doczy went to his seat, but soon he was back and the argument
renewed.
   The topics apparently included soccer and the relative merits of
Hungary and Ireland. There was a lot of cursing, and Gasiorowski
heard Doczy yell something about ``drunken Irish.''
   The brothers responded in kind. ``Witnesses say the word
`communist' was being thrown around pretty liberally,'' said
Richard Piperno, a spokesman for the Queens district attorney.
   Ireland landed the first blow when Padraig Folan punched the
smaller Doczy in the nose, knocking him down; then Seamus kicked
him twice in the ribs. The bartender broke up the fight.
   ``I asked Andy if he was OK,'' Gasiorowski testified. ``He said
he was OK and went over to his drink and he said, `I'm going to
blow those guys away.'''
   Doczy walked out, went home and came back about a half-hour
later. Hughes had left, but the Folans were still drinking. Doczy
went over to them, there was more arguing, and Doczy pulled out a
.32-caliber revolver and shot Seamus in the back of the head. Then
he turned and shot Padraig.
   Before he walked out, Doczy remarked: ``I know, I know I'm going
to jail.''
   Doczy's lawyer last week told jurors that his client did not
know he had done wrong: ``You will acquit the defendant by reason
of mental disease or defect.''
   To the Folans' sister Ann, the insanity defense offered little
consolation.
   ``What happened has changed my attitude about this country,''
she told the Daily News last week. ``It's very hard to get the
anger out of you. You keep looking for answers where there are no
answers.''

<HEAD>Barge Collision Spills Gas, Diesel into Mississippi River</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two tugboats moving 33 barges collided in the
dark on the Mississippi today, spilling more than 160,000 gallons
of gasoline and diesel fuel near intakes for public water systems,
authorities said.
   Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Ken Keane said the fuel spilled from
two barges, which were still leaking shortly before noon.
   The Orleans and Jefferson parish water systems said they were
checking water quality at the intakes.
   ``We're not having any problem with drinking water on either
side right now,'' said David Mancuso of the Jefferson water system.
   The tugs _ a 25-barge vessel carrying coal and an eight-barge
one moving fuel _ were going in opposite directions when the
collision occurred near the Huey P. Long Bridge outside New
Orleans, Keane said.
   It was not immediately clear how the accident occurred, he said.
   ``We just have two that have holes in them,'' he said. ``There's
no doubt there were others damaged.''
   The owner of the leaking barges estimated that 84,000 gallons of
fuel spilled from each vessel.
   The Coast Guard instructed barge crews to use their booms to
contain the diesel and to leave the gasoline alone, because
containing gasoline into a pocket creates a fire hazard, Keane
said. He noted gasoline evaporates quickly.
   Keane said that diesel is poisonous to fish and other wildlife
but that any fuel not contained would be diluted quickly in the
Mississippi's swift current.
   The leaking barges were owned by Chotin Transportation of
Cincinnati. Chotin Vice President Stephen Frasher said the company
was investigating the spill.

<HEAD>Postal Service Shrinking Some Overnight Delivery Areas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service is shrinking the areas in
which it promises overnight and second-day mail delivery, aiming to
provide what it hopes will be more consistent service.
   Postmaster General Anthony Frank says what customers want most
is dependability: ``Just tell me how many days ahead I have to mail
my mother's birthday card.''
   By concentrating its resources on smaller areas, the agency
hopes to better keep its delivery promises, explained Frank.
   And to keep them honest, the agency is hiring an outside firm to
measure its performance and report the results publicly.
   The effort to make service more consistent comes just two months
before the Postal Service is expected to apply for a rate increase
to take effect in 1991.
   The more concentrated service was tested on New York City over
the past year with only one complaint, Frank added. Similar plans
will be instituted across the nation between June and the end of
the year, he said.
   ``We've already done 29,000 interviews with the public,'' said
Frank of the research that led to planned changes in delivery.
   The biggest complaint? Inconsistent service.
   Sometimes a letter mailed across town would arrive overnight,
sometimes the second day. Sometimes it took a week.
   People said they want consistent delivery, Frank explained. They
know when their check or magazine or other regular mail is sent,
and they want to be confident of when it will arrive.
   ``Just tell me how many days ahead I have to mail my mother's
birthday card ... just tell me, I want to be sure it's there,''
Frank quoted as a typical complaint.
   Second, he said, was that people want their mail delivered at
the same time every day.
   ``I wouldn't have guessed that that would be No. 2,'' he added.
``They don't want to go out there and see it empty.''
   ``And the third thing they say is they want local mail delivered
overnight,'' he said.
   In general, the changes mean that areas where the Postal Service
promises overnight delivery will shrink somewhat.
   Two-thirds of all mail is local and will not be affected by the
changes, Frank said. In general, he said, between 5 percent and 8
percent of mail might be changed from overnight to second day, or
from second day to third day delivery.
   Currently the postal service manages to deliver about 95 percent
of its overnight mail on time, but ``doesn't even come close'' to
95 percent for mail it tries to deliver on the second or third day,
Frank said.
   Following the New York City tests, Frank said local and regional
postal officials are developing plans for new delivery areas. They
will seek comment and suggestions from postal customers and the
changes are expected to take place starting in the summer.
   Nevertheless, some critics have complained that mail delivery
will be slowed by the changes, with consumer advocate Ralph Nader
charging that mail standards are deteriorating.
   From Frank's point of view, the standards were simply out of
date and in need of reconsideration.
   The areas designated to receive overnight and second day
delivery were set in 1971, Frank explained. Things have changed
since then _ roads are more crowded, space is tighter on airlines
and population patterns have shifted.
   When postal officials began asking customers how large an area
they thought should have overnight delivery, it always turned out
to be less than what the agency was trying to provide, he added.
   In some areas the agency has been stretching itself to serve a
relatively few customers.
   For example, every day the Postal Service averages 200 letters
between Gainesville, Fla., and Albany, Ga.
   ``They're 190 miles apart. We give them overnight service,''
said Frank. Trying to maintain service like that strains resources.
   On the other hand, Frank said some overnight delivery areas
should be expanded. For example, Nashua, N.H., is now designated
for second day delivery from Boston and Frank thinks it should be
overnight.
   In general, Frank said, he expects to keep overnight delivery
for cities, with second day delivery aimed at the area within a
state and to adjacent states and third day for the balance of the
nation.

   A federal prison escapee has been captured
in Florida after living on the lam for more than a year by
allegedly cashing stolen checks, including some from actor Burt
Reynolds.
   Richard N. Barefoot, 36, was arrested Wednesday at a motel in
Fort Lauderdale. He also had been arrested in August by police in
Jacksonville, Fla., but escaped.
   ``This time he's staying in federal custody until we're done
with him,'' said Deputy U.S. Marshal Jennie S. Gower, the
Indianapolis case agent.
   Barefoot, a convicted forger and mail thief, was serving a
10-year sentence at the Federal Prison Camp at Terre Haute when he
escaped in September 1988.
   Investigators believe Barefoot, whose criminal record dates from
1971, collected more than $165,000 in the 16 months after his
escape by forging checks in the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida.
   In seven Florida cities alone, Barefoot allegedly stole
$125,000, including an unspecified sum he obtained with checks
belonging to Reynolds, who lives in Jupiter, Fla.
   Jennie Gower, Deputy U.S. Marshall, said Barefoot acquired the
checks by driving through affluent residential areas and pulling
checks sent by banks from mailboxes. To cash the checks, he
obtained several Florida driver's licenses, Gower said.

<HEAD>Fate of Refugees Entwined with U.S.-British Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international meeting has ended in disarray,
and the fate of thousands of Vietnamese refugees hangs on a dispute
between the United States and Britain over whether they should be
sent home against their will.
   The 30-nation conference on refugees adjourned Wednesday after
U.S. officials insisted no Vietnamese be forced to return home
before Jan. 1, 1991. That blocked consensus on a proposed starting
date of July 1.
   After only 10 days in office, the U.N. high commissioner for
refugees has been thrust into the argument.
   Thorvald Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian foreign minister, has
the task of negotiating with both on a starting date for mandatory
repatriation of Vietnamese who do not qualify for refugee status in
Hong Kong, a British crown colony.
   The U.N. refugee office had proposed the six-month suspension of
repatriations as a compromise between U.S. demands and Britain's
argument that only immediate deportations would deter another mass
influx of boat people to the overcrowded colony.
   Britain returned 51 Vietnamese to their Communist homeland in
December under an agreement reached with Vietnam last year.
   ``There is no objective justification for a delay in mandatory
repatriation, but in the interests of consensus we were prepared to
agree on a moratorium,'' said Robin McLaren, head of the British
delegation.
   Although the two-day meeting ended without agreement, it marked
the first international consensus that Vietnamese deemed to have
fled for economic rather than political reasons should be returned
even against their will.
   ``We do have agreement on mandatory repatriation,'' McLaren told
reporters. ``What we don't have is a date.''
   The United States relaxed its opposition to forced repatriations
and told the meeting it would not block international consensus on
forcible return of economic refugees, according to sources present
at closed session.
   For the first time at an international gathering, Vietnam also
agreed to take back thousands of the emigrants as part of a
U.N.-supported program. It said none should arrive before Oct. 1,
however, to allow time for preparations to absorb them into a
struggling economy.
   The U.N. refugee agency, which has opposed forcible
repatriations, said it would help monitor those deported to Vietnam
if agreement was reached in Geneva.
   McLaren, the British delegate, was clearly annoyed by the U.S.
refusal to compromise despite support for the six-month moratorium
by all the other nations except Vietnam.
   He said the Bush administration should rethink its policy on
timing and said he expected Stoltenberg to ``take soundings'' of of
the U.S. view by the end of next wek.
   An apparent contradiction in U.S. policy complicates the matter.
   Although U.S. delegates softened the stance, Washington's
officially opposes forcible return.
   ``I want to emphasize that the United States position on
involuntary repatriation has not changed,'' State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in Washington. ``The United
States remains opposed, in principle and in practice, to
involuntary repatriation.''
   McLaren said lack of an international agreement would not deter
Britain from returning boat people under last year's agreement with
Vietnam.
   Geoffrey Barnes, security chief of Hong Kong, told the delegates
Hong Kong could not cope with another influx of 35,000 people, the
number that arrived in 1989, and spoke of growing pressure to push
refugee boats back out to sea.
   About 109,000 boat people are in camps in Hong Kong, Malaysia,
Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines, according to U.N. figures.
   Slightly more than half, or 56,000, are in Hong Kong. The 12,000
who arrived before June 1988 were granted refugee status
automatically, but the others are being to determine whether they
are politial refugees.
   The U.N. agency has said about 7,000 people have been screened
in Hong Kong and 85 percent of these were classified as economic
migrants.
   About 1,100 people have returned to Vietnam voluntarily since
March 1989 and 1,400 more are registered to do so. Each person who
returns voluntarily receives the equivalent of $50 from the U.N.
agency and qualifies for a year's food aid from the Vietnamese
government.
   In pressing for postponement of mandatory repatriation until
next year, the United States argued that the voluntary program
needed more time to work.

   A junk dealer under suspicion in two
mail bomb slayings hired a lawyer today and stopped cooperating
with authorities. FBI divers, meanwhile, began dredging a pond near
his home.
   Robert Wayne O'Ferrell, who promised cooperation with the FBI
while it searched his home and business this week, hired lawyer
Paul Harden of Evergreen, who today signaled an end to the
open-door policy.
   ``I'm afraid he's been very cooperative and it concerns me,''
said Harden, who described himself as a long-time friend of the
O'Ferrell family.
   O'Ferrell, 46, has been questioned in the December bombing
deaths of a federal appeals judge near Birmingham and a civil
rights lawyer in Georgia.
   Harden spoke with reporters after divers began dredging a pond,
about 15 acres in size, across a road from O'Ferrell's home. It was
not known what investigators were seeking, although in recent days
their search focused on a typewriter.
   Federal agents spent much of the week going through O'Ferrell's
home and business before loading boxes from the business into a
truck Wednesday. They pumped out the warehouse septic tank and
emptied the septic tank beside his home.
   They also took hair samples from some of O'Ferrell's relatives.
   Federal sources speaking on condition of anonymity have
confirmed O'Ferrell is a suspect in the slayings of 11th U.S.
Circuit Judge Robert Vance and Robert Robinson, a black laywer from
Savannah, Ga.
   The FBI previously said they believed one or more white
supremacists were responsible for mailing bombs to the victims.
   Federal sources have said polygraph tests administered this week
on O'Ferrell indicated he was being untruthful in some instances.
But O'Ferrell said: ``I have not been told I am a suspect and I
have not been told I failed a lie detector.''
   Polygraph results are not always reliable and are inadmissable
in criminal trials.
   Authorities have said they were looking for a typewriter
O'Ferrell used to write a letter to the 11th Circuit in 1988. The
typewriting in that letter matched that in letters claiming
responsibility for the bombings, sources said.
   O'Ferrell wrote to the court concerning a lawsuit against his
former employer, Gulf Life Insurance Co., and said the U.S. court
system ``is corrupt.'' But none of his court documents mention
racial topics.
   Last year, a panel on which Vance served ruled against O'Ferrell
in that case.
   O'Ferrell said there were about a half-dozen typewriters at his
warehouse, but he denied that authorities had found anything
linking him to the case. He said he hoped the FBI would leave him
alone.

<HEAD>Comedian Says He's Happy, Angry Over Mayor's Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former comedian Dick Gregory says he is both
happy and angry about the FBI sting that brought the arrest of his
friend, Washington Mayor Marion Barry, on drug charges last week.
   Gregory told the Governor's Forum on Narcotics Control and Drug
Abuse here Wednesday that he is happy that ``help is on the way''
for Barry, whom he called an alcoholic.
   Barry's closest friends ``were tickled to death'' to see the
mayor had decided to seek help, said Gregory, a onetime comedian
who has been involved in civil rights and anti-drug causes.
   He said he has been a friend of Barry's for 20 years and that
Barry has been an alcoholic at least that long.
   At the same time, Gregory said he is angry that the federal
government has spent so much time and effort trying to get Barry.
   ``We, in the black community, think it's racist,'' Gregory said.
   ``The FBI spent $40 million and 12 years to get a user, and not
a pusher,'' Gregory said. ``I would feel the same way if it was the
head of the Ku Klux Klan (who had been arrested).''
   Gregory said he and Barry were together in Miami six weeks ago
and he told Barry, ``Man, they're going to get you.''
   Barry was arrested on a charge of cocaine possession last week,
and announced Sunday he was taking unspecified steps to ``heal my
body, mind and soul.'' He has since entered a substance-abuse
clinic in Florida.
   Though he was arrested on illegal drug charge, Barry's
spokeswoman, Lurma Rackley, said ``the most serious problem is
alcoholism.''

<HEAD>Fewer Firecrackers for Chinese New Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLENE L. FU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bang is gradually going out of Chinese New
Year as authorities in Beijing cut the capital's firecracker supply
for the third straight year and similar measures are being adopted
in other cities.
   Traditionally, the Chinese greet the Lunar New Year, which this
year falls on Saturday, with a long, deafening roar of
firecrackers, which are supposed to drive off evil spirits.
   But this year, roadside stalls doing a brisk business in
firecracker sales are conspicuously absent from the capital. The
official People's Daily this week reported a 23 percent decrease in
Beijing's firecracker supply from last year, although more than 1
billion fireworks are expected to be sold.
   Shanghai, China's largest city, adopted firecracker regulations
last year that include a two-fifths reduction in this year's
firecracker sales.
   Ma Zhengjia, director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau's
foreign affairs office, said Thursday that regulations on the sale,
transport and shooting off of firecrackers were enacted in 1986 to
try to reduce the number of deaths, injuries and fires caused by
firecrackers each Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, as the
holiday is called in mainland China.
   In 1987, 251 people in Beijing were killed or injured by
firecrackers, but the following year the figure was down to 26, he
said, adding that the number of fires went down from 224 in 1987 to
22 last year.
   But authorities this year may be more concerned about
controlling the holiday celebrations after hundreds of thousands of
disenchanted Chinese took to the streets last spring calling for
democracy and other changes. Martial law imposed in May was lifted
only two weeks ago.
   As before, bans have been placed on setting off firecrackers at
Tiananmen Square, site of last spring's pro-democracy protests, and
other public places that draw crowds, including the railway station
and airport. But the number of restricted areas _ 610 _ is nearly
double what it was two years ago.
   Ma insisted there was no connection between the regulations,
which he said were longstanding, and last year's pro-democracy
movement, which was crushed by troops who entered the city, killing
hundreds and perhaps thousands of people.
   ``It has nothing to do with June 3,'' he said, referring to the
night the army marched into Beijing.
   ``As you can see for yourself, our society is very stable right
now. The masses are happily preparing for the holiday, the markets
are abundently stocked with whatever you want to buy,'' Ma said.
   Store shelves in Beijing still were well-stocked Thursday, two
days before the new year.
   One little boy, just tall enough to see over the counter, stood
with his nose pressed to the glass case trying to decide whether to
get pretty fireworks like the ``flash of lightning'' or ``two kicks
of the feet'' or the traditional strings of red firecrackers that
his father impatiently told him to choose.
   The cheapest were 3-foot-long sparklers that went for about 3
cents. There were $2 bags of colorful animals and other toys that
run in circles while spraying colorful sparks when lighted. The
most expensive were strings of 1,000 firecrackers that cost about
$2.30 to $3.20.
   Buyers unhesitatingly paid between $4 and $6, and some said they
planned to buy more.
   ``I'm buying these for my two daughters,'' said a man in his 30s
after asking the clerk to show him fireworks ``appropriate for
little girls.''

<HEAD>Actress Kim Basinger Buys a Town in Georgia</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS next-to-last graf to CORRECT to grandfather sted father.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kim Basinger welcomes you to visit Braselton, the
town she bought with the help of ``Batman.''
   ``It's a perfect place for filming,'' the actress said after
signing papers Wednesday night in Atlanta to close the transaction
that gives her most of Braselton, a northeastern Georgoia town of
500 people.
   Miss Basinger, whose movies include the blockbuster ``Batman,''
said she hopes to use some of the 1,728 acres for which she paid
$20 million to build a ``major film studio'' and a ``major
recording studio,'' perhaps the biggest on the East Coast and maybe
even the biggest in the world.
   But she also has promised to keep a flavor of the old-time South.
   ``I have always dreamed that I would play a major role in
preserving a small rural Georgia town similar to the town where my
grandparents lived,'' said Miss Basinger, who attended high school
in nearby Athens.
   ``This is God's little 1,800 acres,'' she said with a chuckle.
   It was that kind of thinking that encouraged the Braselton
family _ which has owned most of the town for more than 110 years _
to sell.
   ``She stated that she would do well for the community and she
would do her best to make everybody love her,'' said H.B.
Braselton, co-manager of the family business.
   ``With her background and publicity, I think (the deal) will put
Braselton on the map _ make it a tourist attraction,'' added
Harrison W. Braselton.
   Miss Basinger now owns the community's downtown, its water and
sewer systems, a bank, a post office, a manufacturing plant and
various retail properties.
   Her plans include a 671-acre industrial park, 510 acres of
commercial and retail development and 547 acres for residential
use. The industrial park is adjacent to land where Mitsubishi has
invested $36 million for new offices and plants.
   Henry Edward Braselton, the town's mayor, said he has no
intention of leaving the city his grandfather founded in 1876.
   ``It's an historic day and there's some sadness. You don't do
something all your life and change without some sadness,'' he said.
``But we think we did the right thing. We're happy it was Kim who
decided to purchase it because she's a local person, being from
Athens, and she's real sweet.''

   The president of North Yemen said today the
U.S. news media are perpetuating the Arab-Israeli conflict by
failing to report adequately on Israeli abuses in the occupied
territies.
   President Ali Abdullah Saleh told reporters that he is convinced
``objective writing about the situation will mobilize public
opinion in support of Palestinian self-determination.''
   Unless the Palestinian people achieve this goal, ``peace will be
in danger,'' he said, blaming the situation on Israeli
intransigence.
   Saleh, speaking to reporters, denied allegations by Yemeni
opposition groups that thousands of his countrymen are being
detained and tortured for political reasons and that large numbers
of others have been executed.
   Saleh said there has not been a ``single political prisoner'' in
North Yemen since 1983.
   He invited Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
group, to visit prisons in his country. ``If they find a single
one, they can free him immediately,'' he said.

<HEAD>Woman Files Suit After School Locks Son in Closet for Three Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELMORE CITY, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman is suing a school district for
locking her 13-year-old son in a cafeteria closet for three school
days for fighting.
   Frances Allison said her son, Gary DeWayne Morris, has
nightmares and refuses to sleep without a light since the incident
last March. She is suing the Elmore City School district and a
former principal for $100,000.
   The lawsuit, filed in December, says the boy was kept in the
4-by-5-foot closet from 8:25 a.m. to 2:45 p.m., that meals were
served to him and that he had to urinate in a bottle.
   ``Imagine what they would have done to me if someone had come to
my house and noticed Gary in the closet,'' Ms. Allison said.
``They'd put me in jail and take away my kids.''
   Delbert Handke, district superintendent, said today that the boy
was allowed out to use the bathroom. He said the incident occurred
before he became superintendent.
   The school district said Ms. Allison consented to an in-house
suspension. Ms. Allison said the principal told her such a
suspension would occur in a classroom away from other students and
would be supervised by a teacher.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite easing tensions in Europe, a Cold War
still exists in Asia, where the United States and the Soviet Union
have focused on competing military forces, a Japanese scholar told
Congress Thursday.
   ``We see two products of the Cold War firmly intact: a divided
Korea and a divided China,'' said Masashi Nishihara, a professor of
international relations at the National Defense Academy of Japan.
   ``There is little dialogue between the two superpowers about how
they can resolve their confrontational force structures,'' he said.
   Nishihara was one of several scholars from overseas testifying
before the Senate Armed Services Committee. The panel is holding a
series of hearings of U.S. defense needs in light of the changing
Soviet threat.
   Overall, Nishihara said, the Soviet military poses less of a
threat to Japan that in the past, even though Moscow continues to
deploy modern ships, aircraft and other weapons in the Pacific
region.
   But he said there remain uncertainties in the region that could
cause problems for Japanese and U.S. security, including the
possible development of nuclear weapons by North Korea and the
steady build-up of the Chinese navy.
   North Korea does not manufacture nuclear weapons yet although it
has built a nuclear reactor that produced plutonium, a material
needed for a nation to have a nuclear capability, according to Gary
Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a group
that monitors the development of nuclear weapons worldwide.
   ``If they get real close (to making weapons), the South Koreans
are going to have to react,'' he said.
   Nishihara also said Japan should be consulted about any U.S.
moves to reduce its defenses in the Pacific.
   While Japan must strengthen its Self-Defense Forces, he said, he
doubted whether the United States, the Japanese public or other
Asian countries would support a much-expanded defense role for
Japanese forces, he said.
   The Japanese constitution, adopted during the post-war U.S.
occupation, curbed military spending.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A democratic, Western-style
constitution was formally presented Thursday to the Constituent
Assembly, which is expected to approve the document and set a date
for independence, probably in March.
   Unlike most constitutions in Africa, the document sets a limit
of two, five-year terms for the president, who is to be chosen
through national elections. However, to avoid the need for an
immediate election, the first president will be chosen by
Parliament.
   The constitution also says Parliament can impeach the president
by a two-thirds vote. It prohibits capital punishment.
   The first president is expected to be Sam Nujoma, leader of the
South-West Africa People's Organization. SWAPO waged a 23-year
guerrilla war against South African rule that ended in April.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia for 75 years, but has agreed to
grant independence to the semidesert territory under United Nations
supervision.
   Hage Geingob, a SWAPO official who is chairman of the
Constituent Assembly, said the committee that wrote the
constitution was ``inspired by a spirit of reconciliation, brother
and sisterhood, and commitment to the future of this great
country.''
   All seven political parties that captured seats in November's
elections took part in writing the constitution.
   The full assembly took no immediate action on the document, but
is expected to do so when it meets again on Monday.
   The document has a declaration of fundamental rights, including
freedom of movement, speech and a free press. It also envisions a
multiparty democracy, regular elections, an independent judiciary
and an executive president.
   Leftist-oriented SWAPO captured 41 of the 72 seats in the
Constituent Assembly during elections in November. But at least 48,
or two-thirds, of the assembly members must approve the
constitution.
   The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multiracial coalition that
favors a capitalist economy, has 21 seats. The remaining 10 seats
are divided among five other parties.
   Despite a hard-fought campaign and major ideological
differences, the assembly quickly worked out compromises on the
constitution after beginnning work in November.
   The more than 6,000 U.N. military and civilian personnel in
Namibia are scheduled to remain until the end of March. The head of
the U.N. contingent, Martti Ahtisaari, has said he expects Namibia
to attain independence before the U.N. forces leave.
   Under the proposed constitution, the Constituent Assembly will
be converted into the National Assembly, which will be the dominant
chamber of Parliament and have legislative powers.
   A second chamber, the National Council, will consist of members
elected on a regional basis. It will be empowered to review
legislation and to refer bills back to the assembly, but it cannot
kill bills the assembly approves again.

   Ava Gardner, the farmer's daughter who fled
Hollywood for Europe after her stormy life began to match the femme
fatale roles she played on screen, died today, a friend said. She
was 67.
   The friend, Paul Mills, told Press Association, Britain's
domestic news agency, the actress died of pneumonia at her home in
Kensington, West London.
   Ms. Gardner had been ill for some time, Press Association said.
She was hospitalized in January 1988 for more than a week with a
respiratory problem, and she suffered a stroke in October 1986.
   Ms. Gardner starred in 60 films, beginning with ``We Were
Dancing'' in 1942 and including ``The Snows of Kilimanjaro,'' ``The
Barefoot Contessa,'' ``Show Boat,'' ``The Sun Also Rises,'' ``Night
of the Iguana,'' and ``The Kidnapping of the President.''
   In one of her last roles, she appeared on the CBS-TV series
``Knots Landing'' in 1985.
   Ms. Gardner moved to London after her third divorce, from Frank
Sinatra, in 1957.
   In an interview in 1982, she said she would happily have traded
her career for one happy, long-lasting marriage: ``One good man I
could love and marry and cook for and make a home for, who would
stick around for the rest of my life.''
   ``I never found him,'' she said in the interview with London's
Daily Express. She was married to Mickey Rooney, jazz musician
Artie Shaw, then Sinatra.
   ``The trouble was that I was a victim of image,'' she said.
``Because I was promoted as a sort of siren and played all those
sexy broads, people made the mistake of thinking I was like that
off the screen.
   ``They couldn't have been more wrong. Although no one believes
it, I am pathologically shy. I was a country girl and I still have
a country girl's rather simple, ordinary values.''
   ``No one ever wanted to know the real me at all,'' the actress
said in a 60th birthday interview. ``They preferred the myths _ the
roaring lady who smashed champagne glasses and seduced
bullfighters.''
   Ms. Gardner's reputation as a sex goddess was launched in the
1946 film, ``The Killers,'' co-starring Burt Lancaster.
   She played a wild Spanish dancer opposite Humphrey Bogart in
``The Barefoot Contessa,'' and a love-hungry, hotel proprietress
chasing Richard Burton in Tennessee Williams' ``Night of the
Iguana.''
   Lancaster said from his Los Angeles home: ``She was a wonderful
lady, wonderful lady... She was a very simple lady. She used to
come down to the beach with us and cook and play with the kids.''
   ``I hope she was happy, that's all,'' he said.
   ``I think she was the last great beauty,'' said Michael Winner,
who directed Ms. Gardner in a horror film, ``The Sentinel,'' in
1977.
   ``She epitomized to an English lad the glitter and beauty of
Hollywood,'' Winner said in England.
   Ava Lavinia Gardner was born December 24, 1922, the youngest of
six children of cotton and tobacco farmer Jonas Gardner.
   He lost his farm when Ms. Gardner was two and worked as a tenant
farmer until giving up and moving the family to Newport News, Va.
to work in a sawmill. Ms. Gardner's mother, Mary Elizabeth,
operated a boarding house.
   By the time she was a teen-ager, it was clear that Ava Gardner
was an exceptionally attractive woman. When she was 18, she visited
her older sister, Bea, in New York. Bea's husband, photographer
Larry Tarr, shot dozens of pictures of her.
   He put one up in his studio. It caught the eye of Barney Dunham,
then a clerk in MGM's New York legal deparment. Durnham had Tarr
send some pictures to Hollywood, and Ms. Gardner wound up with a
screen test and a $50-a-week contract as a starlet.
   Ms. Gardner posed for cheesecake publicity shots and appeared in
bit roles in several movies, such as ``We Were Dancing'' and
``Ghosts on the Loose,'' before her career started to break when
she played the seductress in ``The Killers.''
   In the days of the Hollywood sex goddess, the auburn-haired,
green-eyed actress reigned between Rita Hayworth and Marilyn Monroe.
   Her first marriage in January, 1942 was to Rooney. He was 21 and
at one of several career peaks as the star of the Andy Hardy
movies. She was 19, an ingenue under contract to MGM. Rooney took a
studio press agent along on their honeymoon. They were divorced
after 20 months.
   She met bandleader Shaw at a Hollywood nightclub, and they were
married in October, 1945. Shaw took several books to read on their
honeymoon. Ms. Gardner later suffered a nervous breakdown, and the
marriage ended a year and a week after it began.
   Between Shaw and Sinatra, her name was linked to billionaire
Howard Hughes.
   She met Sinatra, whose career was in a slump, during a January
1950 Palm Springs party. Sinatra was married at the time to his
childhood sweetheard and wife of 12 years.
   Sinatra and Gardner were married in Philadelphia on Nov. 2, 1951.
   Ms. Gardner obtained a divorce from Sinatra in July, 1957, just
as she finished making ``The Sun Also Rises.''
   In 1958, she announced she was quitting MGM, which brought her
to Hollywood in 1941.
   ``MGM was never the right studio for me. They never bought a
property for me; they never knew what to do with me,'' she said.
``Most of the time, they loaned me out.''
   Mills said Ms. Gardner's body would be taken to Smithfield, N.C.
for burial alongside her parents, according to Press Association.

<TEXT>
   A consumer group mounted a complaint campaign
Thursday against manufacturers of disposable and non-recyclable
products, charging that wasteful packaging depletes resources and
jams the nation's landfills.
   The New York Public Interest Research Group published a 20-page
guide to what it called the worst of environmentally damaging
packaging, listing toll-free telephone numbers of the products'
makers and urging calls of complaint.
   ``Consumers need to send these companies a clear message that
they don't want and don't need these so-called convenience items
and overpackaged products,'' Steven A. Romalewski, author of the
guide, said in an interview.
   Some of the guide's examples are familiar targets of
environmentalist criticism, including disposable diapers,
disposable razors, plastic utensils, polystyrene foam packages and
so-called degradable plastic bags.
   It also faults specialized convenience products, such as Eastman
Kodak Co.'s Fling disposable camera; Quaker Oats Co.'s Aunt Jemima
Pancake Express, with mix for six pancakes and a throwaway plastic
mixing bowl; and Heinz U.S.A.'s plastic ketchup bottles.
   The ketchup bottles are nonrecyclable because they are made of
laminated plastic layers that cannot be separated easily. Juice
boxes used by more than a half-dozen fruit drink producers pose the
same problem because they contain layered plastic, aluminium foil
and paper.
   While ``degradable'' plastic bags have been promoted as a
partial solution to the landfill crisis, the guide cited complaints
from environmental groups that the bags only break down into
smaller plastic particles, which remain in the environment. It also
said they may not break down when buried, and could weaken products
made from recycled plastic.
   In interviews, spokesmen for some of the companies criticized by
NYPIRG protested that they were squeezed by conflicting
environmental concerns on one side and consumer preferences on the
other.
   ``We're between a rock and a hard place,'' said Heinz
spokeswoman Beth Adams, because consumers prefer plastic bottles
and only laminated plastic is airproof enough to keep ketchup from
darkening.
   She said Heinz, in Pittsburgh, continues to sell glass bottles,
but they now make up only about 35 percent of its bottled ketchup
sales. The company is searching ``fast and furious'' for a
recyclable plastic bottle, she said.
   Ron Bottrell, at Quaker Oats in Chicago, made a similar argument
for Pancake Express, saying the company had to balance
``conflicting concerns'' of environmentalists and of most shoppers.
   While environment groups want biodegradable packaging,
``consumers are telling us with their dollars that convenience is
the driving force in their purchasing habits,'' he said. ``The food
company is in the middle.''
   At Kodak, in Rochester, spokeswoman Holly Walkland read a letter
prepared for customers who complain about the Fling camera,
maintaining that it does not contain much more material than a
drop-in 110 film cartridge. The letter also said photofinishers
dispose of the camera ``in a manner prescribed by local
ordinances.''
   Walkland added that Kodak was ``actively exploring not just for
single-use cameras but for all of our products how they can be
recycled.''
   NYPIRG's Romalewski said such promises were not enough for his
group.
   ``Especially at a time when industries are trying to cash in on
the green decade and this new environmentalism, they can't just try
to give the appearance that they're doing good for the
environment,'' he said. ``They have to take some tough action.''
   His group decided against boycotts because it believes they work
only when targeted at a single product, Romalewski said. He said
NYPIRG instead hoped to make its point by inspiring complaint calls
to the nearly two dozen companies whose products it criticized.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today proposed a $1.1 billion
increase in federal spending for the war on drugs and said he was
committed to marshaling ``everything that works'' to combat what he
called the nation's No. 1 concern.
   Bush's $10.6 billion plan designates five regions _ New York,
Los Angeles, Miami, Houston and the Southwest border of California,
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas _ as high-intensity drug trafficking
areas eligible for millions of dollars in additional federal help
this year and next.
   ``We want to help them map out a more comprehensive, coordinated
approach to fight drugs,'' the president said in a luncheon speech
to about 75 newspaper publishers.
   He said his administration has made progress in battling drugs
in the four months since he unveiled an action plan, but added:
``Given the headlines we've seen recently, it's clear we're only
getting started.''
   He also called on Congress to broaden the definition of
drug-related crimes for which the death penalty may be applied.
   The budget proposal would spend 42 percent of the money for
domestic law enforcement, 29 percent for border interdiction and
international operations and 29 percent for demand reduction, said
John Walters, chief of staff to drug policy director William J.
Bennett.
   ``To those who say our program looks top-heavy on the
interdiction side, remember that many of the efforts to limit
supply are exclusively federal _ and inherently more expensive than
demand reduction,'' Bush said.
   ``We're willing to spend more to limit the drug supply. Simply
put, we're willing to do whatever it takes.''
   Bush made the comments as he unveiled what he called ``a
blueprint for success,'' a series of proposals that build upon the
national drug strategy he announced last Sept. 5.
   ``We're committed to the same aggressive goals and principles we
outlined last September: to reduce use, through an integrated mix
of supply- and demand-side approaches. And that means doing
everything that works,'' Bush said.
   He said illegal drugs ``remain this nation's No. 1 concern.''
   The president reiterated his earlier call for the death penalty
for convicted ``drug kingpins'' responsible for drug-related
killings, and, he said, ``even in some cases attempted killings.''
   ``We want there to be absolutely no doubt about the certainty of
punishment,'' Bush said.
   The proposal calls for allowing the death penalty for drug
kingpins even when they or their organizations have not killed
anyone; for drug kingpins who attempt to kill in order to obstruct
justice; and for federal drug felons whose offenses result in
death, such as a drug user's overdose.
   Bush also praised efforts by the leaders of Mexico and Colombia
in fighting drug traffickers in their countries, said said he would
``reinforce our support for the courageous leaders of the region''
at the upcoming Feb. 15 drug summit in Colombia.
   Bush vowed to do what it takes to see drug operations
``dismantled and destroyed.''
   ``We don't make deals with dealers,'' he said.
   Asked about arguments in favor of drug legalization, Bush said:
``I just think that it would increase, regrettably the habit and I
strongly oppose it. ... I'm just going to hold the line against
legalization.''
   The updated strategy developed by policy director Bennett
emphasizes ``the crucial role'' of state and local governments. To
that end, it calls for $2.6 billion in 1991 to be sent to the
states for law enforcement, treatment and drug prevention efforts,
a 108 percent increase over the past two years.
   Last September, Bush sought $7.9 billion for the war against
drugs in 1990, but Congress increased that to $8.8 billion. The
current proposal also is subject to congressional approval.
   Although $8.8 billion has been the universally recognized figure
for the 1990 budget, the new strategy uses new figures that take
into account other drug expenditures already being made and says
the country is now spending $9.5 billion, Walters said.
   Overall, criminal justice spending will increase 2 percent to
$4.3 billion; treatment goes up 12 percent to $1.5 billion;
education-community and workplace funding goes up 11 percent to
$1.2 billion.
   Also, international initiatives shoot up 65 percent to $690
million; interdiction efforts increase 17 percent to $2.4 billion;
research hikes 20 percent to $383 million; and intelligence efforts
zoom up 142 percent to $172 million.
   Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., told the National
Conference of Mayors that the administration has placed too much
emphasis on casual users and not enough on hard-core addicts.
   ``It's not that the administration doesn't care about hard-core
users _ they do,'' the Judiciary Committee chairman said as he
touted his rival, $14.6 billion anti-drug strategy. ``But that is
not their main emphasis.''
   Bennett told reporters earlier that the administration's plan
was in ``90 percent agreement'' with Biden's, and he wouldn't
oppose it if Congress decides to add more money for 1991 as it did
for 1990. ``I could spend any amount of money on this,'' he said.
   The Pentagon, long reluctant to enter the drug war, will
contribute about $1.2 billion in 1991, with about $638 million of
that going for detection and monitoring of traffickers trying to
enter the country with illicit drugs, according to the new
strategy. Its efforts this year total $878 million.
   Bruce Carnes, Bennett's budget specialist, said the military
drug war budget for 1991 represents the biggest dollar increase
proposed in the strategy.
   It is followed by the Department of Health and Human Services'
Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, whose budget
would increase from $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion. That includes
almost $577 million in block grant money for drug treatment
programs, an increase of $100 million in such grants.
   The third largest dollar increase is for the Agency for
International Development, moving from $48 million to $224 million,
much of that for the Andean countries where most of the world's
cocaine is produced. The fourth largest increase is for the Drug
Enforcement Administration, from $549 million to $700 million in
1991.
   The designation of the high-intensity drug trafficking areas
applies to 1990 as well as 1991, according to Walters. The current
budget allocates $25 million for those areas, plus up to $21
million more from the federal asset forfeiture fund, said Reggie
Walton, associate director of Bennett's office. And the 1991 budget
calls for $50 million for those areas.
   But Carnes said the areas actually will be receiving a total of
$1.2 billion worth of federal efforts this year, and would receive
a total of $1.4 billion in 1991, when all other federal programs
and grants are included.
   Most of the help will be in the form of money going to federal
agencies who will target those areas, not in checks to the local
governments.
   The strategy listed metropolitan areas and surrounding areas
that could be included, as well as the cities in those surrounding
areas.
   The New York City area could include Nassau County in New York
and Union, Hudson and Essex counties in New Jersey, it said. Carnes
said that area would receive $396 million worth of help in 1990 and
$436 million in 1991.
   Los Angeles could include Los Angeles and Orange counties, and
would get $151 million in 1990 and $169 million in 1991.
   Miami, which could include Broward, Dade and Monroe counties,
Fla., could get $196 million in 1990 and $223 million in 1991.
   Houston, which could include Harris and Galveston counties,
Texas, could get $168 million in 1990 and $187 million in 1991.
   The Southwest border includes 35 counties in California,
Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, would receive $330 million in 1990
and $368 million in 1991.
   The total number of federal anti-drug workers targeted to each
area is: New York, 250; Los Angeles, 300; Miami, 300; Houston, 200;
Southwest border, 700, Carnes said.

<HEAD>Welshman Anthony Hopkins to Direct Play on Dylan Thomas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anthony Hopkins, in town to film a movie and
direct a play, said Thursday he hopes to do more directing in
coming years.
   ``I always want to direct when I'm being directed badly. But
unfortunately, I've been working with some very, very good
directors these last few years,'' Hopkins said at a news conference
in Pittsburgh, where he is filming ``The Silence of Lambs.''
   The psychological thriller also stars Jodie Foster.
   Hopkins is also directing ``Dylan Thomas: Return Journey,'' a
one-man show featuring Bob Kingdom based upon the Welsh poet's
work, anecdotes and letters.
   The show makes its American debut Feb. 16 in Pittsburgh after
having played to British audiences, then goes on to New York.
   ``I'd always wanted to play Dylan Thomas myself, being Welsh,''
Hopkins said. ``When I heard Bob Kingdom was doing it, I didn't
have any resentment. I thought, `Well, I'm a bit too old to do it
now.' I thought, `At least somebody's got up and done it.' ''
   Hopkins, 52, has appeared in many Shakespeare productions and
the films ``War and Peace,'' ``The Bunker'' and ``The Elephant
Man.''

   MARIETTA, Ga. AP) _ Three Georgia Lockheed employees detained in
the African nation of Chad since Jan. 5 left for the Congo on
Thursday and a connecting flight to Paris, a Lockheed spokesman
said.
   The five were to have left Sunday but authorities in Chad
delayed them. Lockeed spokesman Dick Martin said they left late
this morning EST.
   They had been detained in a contract dispute with the government
involving destruction of a maintenance manual for a new C-130
transport plane the government had purchased from the company,
based in Marietta, Ga.
   The five had been detained at police headquarters in the Chadian
capital of N'Djamena from Jan. 5-15 and kept under house arrest at
a hotel since then.
   They are Irving Thrash, Marvin Gambill and Ernest Ruse. The
wives of two of the men who accompanied them to Chad also were
detained and were freed.

   President Bush said today that Mikhail S.
Gorbachev has done a ``remarkable job'' in handling the ethnic
unrest in Azerbaijan, and that the Soviet president ``is really the
best hope'' for continued peaceful change in the world.
   ``It's not for some president of the United States to say who he
thinks should be in that job but as I look around I think Mr.
Gorbachev is really the best hope for what our interests are,''
Bush said in a question and answer session with newspaper
publishers at the White House.
   Gorbachev has sent Soviet troops to Azerbaijan to quell the
unrest, and they have been battling local resistance for several
days.
   Bush said he wasn't encouraging the use of force ``because we
would like to see peaceful change wherever possible.''
   But he said that in the Baltics, Gorbachev ``still is talking
peaceful change and I think he's done a remarkable job.''
   ``We want to see peaceful change continue. We want to see the
democratization of Eastern Europe.''
   ``I think he has conducted himself in an extraordinarily
difficult situation very well,'' Bush said of Gorbachev. ``He
remains committed to peaceful change and I don't think anyone is
faulting him for the difficulty he has encountered.''
   ``I think Mr. Gorbachev is really the best hope for what our
interests are.''

   The family of Carol Stuart, the woman apparently
killed by her husband in an attack he blamed on a black mugger,
announced a scholarship fund today for residents of the inner-city
area where the shooting took place.
   Marvin Geller, a lawyer for the family, said the case had opened
``old scars of racial tension'' in Boston's racially mixed Mission
Hill neighborhood, where police launched a major manhunt for the
killer after the shooting.
   ``The DiMaiti family believes that Carol would not have wanted
her death to be remembered as the cause of such divisiveness,''
Geller said. ``(Carol) would not have wanted to be remembered as a
victim of a sensational murder.''
   The DiMaiti family said it had opened a bank account, and it
appealed for donations to the fund. The family's lawyers said they
donated $10,000.
   Other details, such as eligibility requirements and what the
scholarships will pay for, were not disclosed.
   The announcement came at a news conference at which Mrs.
Stuart's father made his first public comment since her killing.
   ``Mere words cannot express the terrible emptiness we feel or
how much we miss her now,'' Giusto DiMaiti said. ``All she ever
wanted to be was a good daughter, wife and mother.''
   Charles Stuart had told police that a black gunman attacked the
white couple in their car moments after they left a birthing class
Oct. 23. His pleas for help over the couple's car phone directed
police to his dying wife.
   Their son was delivered prematurely by Caesarean section and
died 17 days later.
   Stuart apparently jumped to his death off a bridge Jan. 4 after
a brother implicated him in the slaying.

   Plans are in the works for Paul
McCartney to headline two huge rock concerts for the homeless, but
they could be snagged by homeowners' concerns about noise and
traffic.
   The concerts would take place this spring at Memorial Stadium on
the campus of the University of California at Berkeley, Mayor Loni
Hancock and university spokesman Ray Colvig confirmed Wednesday.
   The promotion company Bill Graham Presents has promised the city
at least $100,000 of the proceeds to help Berkeley's homeless, said
Peggy Sullivan, a spokeswoman for Hancock. The university would get
a similar amount and divide it between homelessness and classical
music projects, said Colvig.
   UC Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman has yet to approve the
concerts, tentatively scheduled March 31 and April 1, but Colvig
said he expects a decision soon.
   Sullivan said city officials must clarify whether the concerts
would violate an understanding the university reached with
neighborhood associations to bar commercial events at the stadium.
With field seating, the stadium's capacity is about 90,000.
   McCartney has been on his first concert tour in 13 years, often
playing hits from his years with the Beatles.

   Clint Eastwood, paying tribute to Sergio
Leone at a film festival, said one of the joys of working with the
late Italian director in the 1960s was that he lacked Hollywood's
ingrained self-censorship.
   ``Sergio was not afraid to attack things that were forbidden,''
Eastwood said. ``For instance, you couldn't show a character
getting shot. Sergio didn't know that, so he went ahead and filmed
it.''
   The two met in 1963, when Eastwood accepted an offer to go to
Italy and make ``A Fistful of Dollars,'' a western modeled on Akira
Kurosawa's samurai movie, ``Yojimbo.''
   The only Italian word Eastwood knew was ``arrivederci'' and the
only English Leone knew was ``goodbye,'' the actor told movie buffs
Wednesday at the Sundance United States Film Festival. As a result,
Eastwood said, ``I just did my own thing and Sergio went along with
it.''
   One of Leone's trademarks was the extreme close-up, sometimes
framing only a subject's eyes.
   ``Actors love those tight shots,'' said Eastwood, 59. ``But I
was younger then. Now I tell them to take the camera back.''

   Loretta Young starred in dozens of films and won

come easily, she recalled in a recent interview.
   Her father abandoned her at the age of 3, but she was acting as

   She didn't attend school past the age of 12, she told Parade

   ``I hated school. One of the reasons was a learning disability,
dyslexia, which no one understood at the time,'' said Young, 76.
``I still can't spell, because I see some of the letters backward.
   ``They had a tutor at the studio for me. Didn't teach me
anything, but I learned to be on time and to know my dialogue and
to do what the director told me.''

   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel made a
sentimental visit Thursday to the Warsaw theater where his plays
were staged until the 1981 martial-law ban and then revived as
Poland turned to democracy.
   The Teatr Powczechny brought the playwright's work to audiences
last year even while Havel still was banned in Czechoslovakia.
   Havel, who was elected president Dec. 29 after Czechoslovakia's
``velvet revolution,'' included a trip to the theater during an
official trip to Poland.
   Standing amid the crates and cages that form the set for one of
his plays, Havel discussed characterizations and dialogue with the
actors.
   As Havel signed underground copies of his plays, one actor said
he hoped he would not face arrest if he performed the president's
works in Prague.
   ``Probably no,'' Havel replied. ``The foreign minister is my
close friend and he always asks me about everything.''
   Havel was greeted by the theater's director, Andrzej Wajda, an
internationally acclaimed filmmaker, who said he felt he was
welcoming the president home.
   ``This is his house, we are performing his plays, he is our
writer and that is why we consider us to be Havel's home in
Warsaw,'' Wajda said.
   The director recalled the theater gave 11 performances of
Havel's plays in 1981 before the martial-law declaration that
crushed Solidarity and the cultural outpouring that accompanied the
independent movement.
   The ``Home Theater'' now presenting Havel's works at the
Powczechny was created by actors who performed banned works,
including his, at private homes during the martial-law period,
Wajda said.

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia
proposed Thursday that his country, Poland and Hungary work in
unison to ``return to Europe'' following decades of Soviet
domination.
   He also called for an international ``peace conference'' that
would put ``the definite period mark to World War II and the Cold
War and the artificial division'' of Germany and Europe.
   The goal is clear, Havel said.
   ``We want to belong to a Europe that is a friendly community of
independent states, a stable Europe, a Europe that does not need
protection from superpowers because it is capable of defending
itself by constructing its own security system,'' he said.
   The ongoing Helsinki Treaty process and parallel disarmament
talks should be accelerated to prepare the way to the peace
conference, he said.
   ``Then both military pacts could be dissolved and the process of
all-European integration could be started,'' including the
reunification of Germany within the present borders of East and
West Germany, he said.
   The former dissident playwright, elected president last month
after Czechoslovakia's peaceful anti-Communist revolution, told the
Polish National Assembly that joint action to rejoin Western Europe
would avert rivalry among Eastern Europe's emerging democracies.
   ``We should not compete in who is going to overtake whom and who
will be first to win a seat in some European body, but we should do
just the opposite: Help each other in the spirit of that Solidarity
with which in worse times you protested against our repression and
we against yours,'' Havel told the joint session of the Polish Sejm
and Senate.
   ``Western Europe is much more advanced in integration processes
and if we were to return to Europe individually it would certainly
take much longer and it would be much more complicated that if we
act together,'' he said.
   ``This does not only concern economics. It concerns everything,
including disarmament talks,'' he said.
   Politicians in Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland support the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from their territory, but each country
has been discussing the issue separately with Moscow.
   Havel said a power vacuum has existed in central Europe since
the collapse of the Habsburg empire at the end of World War . He
said the countries of the region _ ``until recently colonized by
the Soviets'' _ should unite in a new ``formation.''
   Such a grouping would not appear to ``rich Western Europe as an
impoverished and helpless-looking amnestied prisoner, but as
someone who can also contribute something,'' he said.
   But Havel said he could not predict the ``institutional shape''
of the proposed cooperation among the three countries.
   He proposed that Czechoslovakia host representatives of Poland
and Hungary at the Bratislava Castle near the Hungarian and
Austrian borders to discuss the form of alliance. Observers from
other Eastern European countries could also attend and eventually
might join in the cooperative effort, he said.
   A Polish government spokesman, Henryk Wozniakowski, said Poland
``looks positively'' on Havel's proposition and would ``certainly''
be willing to take part in such talks.
   Havel's speech was the high point of his one-day trip to Poland,
his first since his student days in 1956. He planned to take his
proposal on European integration to Hungary on Friday.
   He was warmly received in parliament and was serenaded afterward
by members with a round of ``Sto Lat'' _ ``May He Live 100 Years.''
   The audience chuckled when Havel recalled the first meeting of
Czechoslovak and Polish dissidents in the mountains along the two
countries' border in 1978.
   He recalled how he, Jan Litynski and Adam Michnik, now both
Solidarity members of the Polish parliament, and Jacek Kuron, the
current labor minister, laughed about being able to duck
surveillance for the clandestine meeting.
   ``If someone had told us then that in 12 years we would be
deputies, ministers and presidents, then we would have laughed even
more,'' Havel said.
   In the visit's only discordant note, Havel did not meet with
Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who refused an invitation, citing
prior plans to meet shipyard workers in Gdansk and saying he did
not want to have ``hand-shaking with no results.'' Walesa instead
sent greetings to Havel.
   Havel was welcomed Thursday at Warsaw's military airport by
Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski, senior government
officials, a full military honor guard and the diplomatic corps.
   He laid a wreath at the grave of the Rev. Jerzy Popieluszko, the
pro-Solidarity priest murdered by security police in 1984. It was
the first time that an Eastern European state leader had visited
the grave.
   About 1,000 Poles turned out to see Havel, who wrote in the
guest book at St. Stanislaw Kostka Church where Popieluszko is
buried: ``I have been moved for the first time since I became
president.''
   He also visited a theater company that has been performing two
of his plays for nearly a year, when they still were banned in
Czechoslovakia.

   The Japanese now own the Publick House
inn and run the food concession at historic Old Sturbridge Village,
but the venerable Yankee institutions promise tofu and sushi won't
replace turkey and succotash.
   ``This is an institution, it's a bastion of Yankee cuisine,''
said Buddy Adler, innkeeper at the Publick House Historic Inn,
built in 1771 by a revolutionary war hero. ``It is what is. To
change it ... nobody would even contemplate that.''
   The inn, a cluster of white colonial buildings dotted about the
town common, also runs the food service concession at Old
Sturbridge Village, a living museum that recreates Massachusetts
life in the early 19th century.
   Crawford Lincoln, director of the non-profit group that runs the
village, said Thursday that he, too, doesn't expect any changes now
that a Japanese company owns the village's eateries.
   ``Indian pudding, not sushi, will be the order of the day from
the food service,'' he said.
   The changes took place earlier this week when Kyotaru Co., a
Japanese food service company, bought Restaurant Associates of New
York City for an undisclosed sum. Restaurant Associates has six
divisions with 120 full-service restaurants and generates about
$240 million in annual revenue, said company spokesman Dennis
Rhodes in New York.
   In the deal, six top managers retained 15 percent of Restaurant
Associates and will continue to operate the business. Hiroshi
Tanaka, chairman of Kyotaru, will also be chairman of Restaurant
Associates.
   The acquisition included another venerable landmark, the
84-year-old Italian restaurant Mamma Leone's in New York City,
Rhodes said.
   Although the food will remain the same, Adler said he did not
know whether Japanese ownership will have any effect on the
ambiance of the Publick House, which includes a 110-room motor
lodge and another restaurant and is listed on the National Register
of Historic Places.
   The change will mean an infusion of capital, and that could fuel
expansion, he said.
   That was welcome news to Sturbridge Town Administrator Kevin
Walsh.
   ``From the standpoint of the town of Sturbridge ... infusion of
capital probably means additional expansion and additional tax
dollars. If that's accurate that's certainly a positive note,''
Walsh said.
   Sturbridge, a small town of about 7,700 in central
Massachusetts, draws thousands of tourists each year. The
population doubles to about 15,000 during summer months.
   About 350,000 people come to see Old Sturbridge Village to
witness life in a recreated New England farm village. The main
restaurant is Bullard Tavern, whose menu features such Yankee
staples as chicken pot pie and cranberry sauce.
   ``Old Sturbridge Village is a non-profit living history that
sets forth life in rural New England in the early 19th century and
as such we will continue to hold fast to all aspects of the New
England Experience,'' Lincoln said.
   He said the change of ownership could mean more visitors from
the Far East.
   ``When visitors do arrive, they will be pleased to find we have
our map guide already printed in Japanese,'' said Lincoln.

   A former Bath Iron Works employee fired
after complaining to the Navy that some steel used in war ships
allegedly was not inspected cannot have a jury trial, Maine's
highest court ruled Thursday.
   Leon E. Bard Jr. contends in his wrongful firing lawsuit that he
lost his job for whistle blowing, but BIW said he was dismissed for
inadequate job performance.
   ``It will go to trial before a judge,'' BIW attorney Constance
P. O'Neil said after the high court ruled that Bard had no grounds
for appealing a Superior Court ruling that took his case off a list
of lawsuits to be heard by jurors.
   The justices of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court ruled
unanimously that they are able to consider appeals only when cases
have proceeded farther than Bard's case had gone.
   Ms. O'Neil expected a trial date will be set soon in Superior
Court in Augusta.
   Bard, a quality assurance inspector, was fired by BIW in
September 1986, after several years in which he had complained
about allegedly uninspected steel used in Ticonderoga class
cruisers to the Supervisor of Shipbuilding, an on-site Navy office
that keeps an eye on BIW's construction of warships in Bath.
   The Navy investigated Bard's charges, first after he made an
initial complaint and a second time when he complained again after
being fired, and found no problems with the BIW steel, Ms. O'Neil
said.
   Bard's firing had nothing to do with his whistleblowing, BIW
said.
   ``He was fired for being a less-than-adequate employee,'' Ms.
O'Neil said. ``There were others who were making the same kinds of
suggestions who are still there. If they (BIW managers) were
worried about them, they would have gotten rid of all of them.''
   There was no immediate comment from Bard; no phone number is
listed for him in the Bath area. His attorney, Elliott L. Epstein
of Lewiston, was not immediately available for comment Thursday,
according to a secretary.
   Ms. O'Neil said she was not certain what Bard was seeking in his
lawsuit, but she believed he wanted back pay and possibly
reinstatement.
   Bard initially filed a four-count lawsuit against BIW, and the
Superior Court dismissed three counts, leaving one that alleged
Bard's firing violated the Maine Whistleblowers' Protection Act.
   The lower court said that case would have to be tried by a judge
and not a jury, leading to Bard's appeal to the high court.

   Top musicians penned birthday greetings to
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, some of them poetic and some in the ``dear
Mo'' vein, in case the famous composer can somehow get the message
on his perch up in harmony heaven.
   ``From measure to measure each note is a treasure,'' rhymed the
Cleveland Quartet. ``Thank you, Mozart, for giving an unsettled
world so much joy, passion and beauty, which will enrich us
forever,'' contributed the Tokyo String Quartet.
   Mozart was born 234 years ago Saturday. The birthday messages
from the likes of Zubin Mehta, Victor Borge, and the New York City
Opera were written to mark the day and to publicize a Mozart series
planned for 1991-92 at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. They
are being displayed on a large poster in front of the center.
   Violinist Joshua Bell, 22, said, ``Dear Mr. Mozart, You have
affected my life immensely. Happy Birthday.''
   A somewhat older violinist, Glenn Dicterow, concertmaster of the
New York Philharmonic, said, ``A special thanks for your violin
concertos and `Symphonie Concertante.'''
   David Zinman, music director of the Baltimore Symphony, said
that Mozart's music ``provides me with hope and courage.''
   Mehta, music director of the New York Philharmonic, informed the
composer that he's about to become the object of ``this century's
most ambitious musical project.''
   He referred to a 19-month tribute set to begin a year from
Saturday at the performing arts center, during which all of
Mozart's compositions will be performed. The onetime child prodigy
wrote more than 800 works before he died in 1791 at age 35.
   The New York City Opera penned a ``wish you were here'' message
for its next season ``when Susanna and Figaro renew their vows.''
   Pianist Rudolph Firkusny told Mozart that he ``will always
remain young, wonderful and alive among us.''
   Some of the messages added a note of humor.
   Soprano Dawn Upshaw said, ``Thanks for saving your best efforts
for sopranos!''
   ``Even though you only wrote one piece for English horn, happy
birthday anyway,'' wrote the Philharmonic's Tom Stacy who, of
course, plays English horn.
   And comedian-pianist Borge's message read in its entirety:
``Dear Mo, As you know, I've always referred to you in my one-man
show as a `bust.' However, I consider you one of the world's most
successful busts. Please don't get plastered on your birthday.
Love, Victor Borge.''

   Balladeers of the sagebrush corralled their
dogies and rode into town Thursday to duel lyrics with bards from
Down Under about life on the open range at the sixth annual Cowboy
Poetry Gathering.
   More than 70 cowboy poets from 16 Western states and six
Australians are scheduled to trade lore about riding, roping and
the wild but dangerous thrill of taming bucking bulls and broncs.
   Elko, a 4{-hour drive to Reno and a little more to Salt Lake
City, is expected to more than double its 3,500 population through
Saturday in the gathering that has gained national attention.
   ``I think people will be surprised to find they (Australians)
basically have a parallel tradition to our cowboy poetry
tradition,'' said Hal Cannon, co-founder of the event.
   ``They have a similar stockmen tradition and their history of
settling the outback is similar to our settling the West.''
   This year's gathering is dedicated to Curley Fletcher, one of
the original cowboy poets who learned their craft sitting around a
nighttime campfire.
   Fletcher, who died in 1954, published poems about the West,
including a 1931 rhyme called Strawberry Roan, in which a wild
bronc gives the poem's cowboy a hard time in the saddle and finally
throws him to the ground.
   In the last stanza, the cowboy gives the Strawberry Roan his due:
   ``Then I knows that the hosses I ain't able tuh ride
   ``Is some of them living, they haven't all died,
   ``But I bets all muh money they ain't no man alive,
   ``Kin stay with that bronk when he makes that high dive.''

<HEAD>Mandela Says He Remains Committed to Nationalization of Banks,
Mines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Jailed black leader Nelson
Mandela on Thursday rejected reports that he has converted to
capitalism, saying he is firmly committed to nationalization of
banks, mines and monopoly industries.
   Mandela, a leader of the outlawed African National Congress, has
been jailed since 1962. He is expected to be freed within a few
weeks and to play a role in promoting talks between the government
and ANC.
   The United Democratic Front, a nationwide anti-apartheid
coalition aligned with the ANC, released a one-paragraph statement
from Mandela that said he wanted to clarify his stance on economic
policy.
   ``The nationalization of the mines, banks and monopoly
industries is the policy of the ANC, and a change or modification
of our views in this regard is inconceivable,'' the statement said.
``State control of certain sectors of the economy is unavoidable.''
   Terror Lekota, chief spokesman for the Front, said the statement
was issued because of ``innuendos in press reports that comrade
Nelson Mandela no longer subscribes to nationalization and that in
this regard he is in conflict with the external leadership'' of the
ANC.
   The statement appeared to be a response to a Jan. 14 article in
the nationally circulated Sunday Times. It quoted wealthy black
businessman Richard Mapanya as saying after a visit with Mandela:
``He did not believe in nationalization, saying it was clear that
such a policy ran counter to the need to keep South Africa
growing.''
   The ANC's exiled leadership, based in Zambia, says it envisions
a mixed economy for South Africa, but has an ideological preference
for socialism. South Africa currently has a capitalist economy
dominated by the country's 5 million whites.
   An anti-apartheid Cape Town weekly newspaper, South, on Thursday
published the text of lengthy statement it said Mandela wrote prior
to his meeting in December with President F.W. de Klerk.
   Justice Minister Kobie Coetsee said the government had no
knowledge of any such statement. Some of Mandela's colleagues said
the statement, even if authentic, might be many months old.
   The ANC ``has no vested interest in violence,'' the statement
said. ``But we consider the armed struggle a legitimate form of
self-defence against a morally repugnant system of govenrment.''
   The statement urged a negotiated settlement, saying ``an
overwhelming majority of South Africans, black and white, hope to
see the ANC and the government working closely together to law the
foundations of a new era in our country.''
   The key issue, according to the statement, would be how to
reconcile blacks' desire for majority rule with whites' desire to
avoid total domination by blacks.
   Mandela, who is serving a life sentence for planning the start
of the ANC's anti-government sabotage campaign, has been meeting
regularly with government officials and anti-apartheid leaders. A
group of five activists visited him Thursday at his quarters in a
former staff home at Victor Verster Prison Farm outside Cape Town.
   Business Day, the country's leading financial newspaper, said
Thursday the government plans to partially lift the state of
emergency and remove restrictions on the United Democratic Front.
   The Front was effectively banned two years ago, but has been
operating more or less openly since de Klerk assumed power in
August.
   The Business Day report cited unidentified government sources
who spoke to the newspaper following Wednesday's meeting between de
Klerk and his Cabinet.
   De Klerk is expected to outline his plans for reform when he
opens Parliament Feb. 2.
   Business Day said de Klerk probably will announce a partial
lifting of the 43-month-old state of emergency, which gives
authorities widespread powers to crackdown on anti-apartheid groups.

<HEAD>Israeli Planes Hit Bases Belonging to Palestinian Groups</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israeli warplanes blasted bases of three
Palestinian guerrilla groups in south Lebanon on Thursday in
apparent retaliation for the killing of an Israeli colonel in a
guerrilla ambush, police said.
   One man was killed and three people were wounded, they said.
   A formation of four jets fired 16 rockets in two sorties on
bases of the Fatah-Revolutionary Council led by terrorist
mastermind Abu Nidal, the Palestine Liberation Front and the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine headed by George
Habash.
   Israeli military officials declined comment.
   The bases in Kfar Jarra, the Majdalyoun Valley and Mrah el-Hbas
respectively, are clustered in an area about a mile away from
hilltop villages controlled by the Israeli-backed South Lebanon
Army 10 miles east of Sidon.
   An official of the pro-Syrian, Marxist PLF of Talaat Yacoub said
the dead man belonged to his group.
   An official of Fatah-RC said the radical faction suffered no
casualities.
   ``We vacated our bases Sunday in anticipation of an Israeli
attack after the heroic operation at Yaroun,'' the official said.
   The raid came five days after guerrillas shot and killed Col.
Yitzhak Rahimov in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone. He was
the highest-ranking Israeli officer to be killed in Lebanon since
Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces in 1985.
   Fatah-RC claimed responsibilty for the attack at the village of
Yaron, one mile north of the international border.
   A communique from Abu Nidal's group later said the attack was
only the first step in Israel's retaliation for the death of the
Israeli colonel.
   ``This is not the retaliation,'' the communique said of
Thursday's attack. ``This is only the beginning of the retaliation.
There will be more attacks soon.''
   Abu Nidal, the nom de guerre of Sabri al-Banna, split with
Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah faction of the Palestine
Liberation Organization in 1973. He has been blamed for numerous
terrorist attacks in Europe and the Middle East.
   The raid was Israel's third on Lebanon this year.
   At least seven people were killed and 18 wounded in Israel's
first and second attacks against bases of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, and a Palestinian radio station. Both
raids were Jan. 19.

   The State Department said Thursday that
Romania's new leaders had gone too far in banning protests in
Bucharest, and urged them to reconfirm their commitment to
democracy.
   The criticism contrasted with earlier Bush administration
support for the National Salvation Front, the provisonal Romanian
leadership that took over in December after hardliner Nicolae
Ceausescu was executed.
   There have been reports that Secretary of State James A. Baker
III might visit Romania next month in conjunction with his trip to
the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, but State Department officials
say no decision has been made about such a step. Baker arrives in
Moscow Feb. 6 for talks over the next two days with Kremlin leaders.
   ``We are deeply concerned about news reports that the decision
of the National Salvation Front has imposed restrictions on
demonstrations in Bucharest,'' said State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   The Romanian government issued its decree Jan. 3 in response to
demonstrations and reissued it after a protest Wednesday by 1,000
people demanding that the front refrain from taking part in
elections set for May. The decree outlaws demonstrations in
Bucharest and allows them only in some parks, unless the protests
are approved by police 48 hours in advance.
   ``The right of citizens to express their opinions peacefully,
including the ability to march and demonstrate, is a fundamental
human right,'' Tutwiler said.
   ``While we recognize that civil authorities may enact reasonable
regulations to ensure public safety, these restrictions appear to
go well beyond this need.''
   Some members of the front have been critical of the United
States for not providing more economic help to their country and
have asked for the restoration of trade concessions that Ceausescu
gave up.
   The State Department has indicated that any decision by Congress
and the administration on the trade concessions would depend on
steps by the Romanian government toward free elections.
   ``The NSF's latest action is all the more disturbing in view of
the front's solemn pledge to the Romanian people to build a
pluralistic democracy and respect human rights as well as to carry
out free, fair and open national elections...,'' Tutwiler said.
   ``We call upon the NSF to reassure the Romanian people and the
international community that it remains committed to moving forward
toward democracy,'' she added.

<HEAD>Pope Urges Rich Nations Not to Abandon Poor Ones</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CIDADE DE PRAIA, Cape Verde (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II began a
tour of the impoverished Sahel region south of the Sahara by asking
rich countries Thursday not to abandon poor nations in favor of
Eastern Europe.
   ``The Holy See and the pope feel allied ... with Africa and
other countries of the Third World,'' he told reporters on the
flight from Rome to this former Portuguese colony off West Africa.
   ``We must present to the rich all the needs of the poor. We must
insist on solutions. ... How can you not cry out in certain
situations?''
   On the first stop of an eight-day trip, John Paul also urged
peaceful resolution through dialogue of crises in the Soviet Union,
including the violence in Azerbaijan.
   ``These are especially painful events; we seek to participate in
the events above all with prayer,'' he said in response to the
first Soviet journalist to join one of the pope's foreign tours, a
reporter for the labor newspaper Trud.
   Asked what message he would send President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
the pontiff said: ``I would wish him above all ... the gift of good
advice.''
   John Paul referred to his historic meeting with Gorbachev on
Dec. 1, at the Vatican, and said the Soviet leader realized the
importance of spirituality in his Communist country.
   ``Perhaps I can say, without betraying any personal secret,
(Gorbachev) was very pleased with the pope's prayers. He said
prayer is certainly a sign of spiritual order, spiritual values,
and that we have a great need for these values.''
   To a question about how much violence could be justified in the
U.S. invasion of Panama and the Soviet military intervention in
Azerbaijan, he replied that violence is ``always something morally
negative ... morally bad.''
   He did not refer directly to either of the cases, but said
self-defense could be justifiable in some situations.
   ``We cannot deny the right of the so-called `just war,' to this
self-defense either of an individual community or a people when it
has suffered violence on the part of others,'' the pope said.
   His sixth voyage to Africa, the 45th foreign trip of his
11-year-old pontificate, comes at a time when African leaders worry
that their persistent need for aid will be pushed aside in the rush
to support emerging democratic movements in Eastern Europe.
   Noting the current focus on that region, which includes his
native Poland, the pontiff said developed countries ``cannot
abandon their common responsibility for the South, for the problems
of the Third World.''
   ``For this, I can thank providence that my journey is taking me
precisely to Africa. This is an act of providence.''
   John Paul emphasized that the duty to help poor nations falls on
all countries of the ``North,'' in which he included the Soviet
Union and its allies.
   Cape Verde and the other nations on his itinerary _
Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Burkina Faso and Chad _ are in the Sahel, a
region afflicted by drought, hunger, disease and encroaching
deserts.
   ``I am traveling in African countries which are the poorest,''
the pope said. ``This trip is especially dear to me because we are
going to meet the poor in the economic and material sense. In a
moral sense, poverty means wealth.''
   He touched on the same theme in his remarks at Praia airport to
President Aristides Pereira.
   The pontiff's white robes flapped in the strong wind as he
declared in Portuguese:
   ``Originally destined for all men, the goods of this world will
never reach this universal destination without the indispensable
collaboration of the international community, in the framework of a
vast solidarity which includes everyone and responds primarily to
the needs of the disadvantaged.
   ``At the same time, the recipients of aid should not become
servile, but maintain the dignity of the interdependence of
peoples.''
   Cape Verde is an archipelago of 10 islands that gained
independence in 1975. Ninety percent of the 360,000 people are
Roman Catholic, the highest proportion in Africa.
   John Paul's next stop is Guinea-Bissau on Saturday.

   A former diplomat who returned home
after 50 years in exile said Thursday he fears the gains of the
pro-democracy revolutution are being thwarted by the provisional
government.
   Ion Ratiu, who arrived Wednesday, joined opposition parties in
denouncing the decision of the governing National Salvation Front
to compete in elections in May.
   ``This is a negation of democracy in my view,'' he said.
   For the second straight night, about 300 people gathered outside
Front headquarters to demand the governing body's resignation,
despite a ban on such protests.
   The protesters, about 150 feet from the building, shouted ``Down
with the Front!'' and ``The National Salvation Front equals the
Commmunist Party of Romania!'' Between them and the building stood
two lines of police and soldiers in armored vehicles, their guns
pointed at the protesters.
   A similar rally Wednesday ended peacefully.
   In apparent response to that protest, the governing body
Thursday again published in newspapers a decree outlawing
demonstrations on Bucharest streets without police permits.
   Critics say the provisional government cannot remain neutral if
it takes part in elections that it administers, and some accuse it
of being a front for Communist rule.
   The U.S. State Department said Thursday Romania's leaders had
gone too far in banning protests in Bucharest and urged them to
reaffirm their commitment to democratic rule.
   Three opposition parties called for the Front to resign and for
a broader-based interim government to rule until the May 20
elections. The joint communique indicated the parties have formed
an alliance against the Front.
   Ratiu, 72, heads the World Union of Free Romanians, the largest
Romanian exile organization.
   Ratiu was a Romanian diplomat in Britain in 1940 and asked for
political asylum when a Nazi government took over his country that
year. He moved to Britain and became a millionaire through property
and shipping interests.
   ``I've come to this country ... after having been steeped in
Western democracy ... I've come to this country to help establish
real democracy,'' he said Thursday.
   Asked whether he was worried about losing the gains of the
revolution that ended one-party Communist rule, Ratiu said: ``I am
worried and certainly will do my best to prevent it, because ...
people sacrificed their lives for real democracy.''
   He said he was most concerned that the Front was not providing
equal access to all parties on radio, television and newspapers. He
said he plans to start a newspaper.
   Ratiu hopes to be a candidate for the National Peasant Party in
his hometown of Turda in western Transylvania.
   Asked if he would accept an offer to run for president, he
replied, ``I will accept to serve in whatever capacity they ask
me.''
   Ion Puiu, the party's vice president, on Wednesday called Ratiu
``one of the greatest figures of our party.''
   Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown in the
revolution Dec. 22 and executed three days later, and the National
Salvation Front was to rule until the elections. It first said it
would not field candidates, but it reversed itself Tuesday.
   ``Illusions Lasted Only One Month,'' read a headline Thursday in
Romania Libera.
   ``What kind of elections are we talking about when the National
Salvation Front has monopolized in a totalitarian way all the key
systems of the state,'' read the opposition parties' communique.
   It repeated allegations that some Front members were Ceausescu
henchmen who want to reinstate Commmunist rule.
   Former Foreign Minister Corneliu Manescu was quoted Thursday by
the independent Paris daily Le Monde as saying former senior
Communist officials were trying to re-establish the party.
   ``I have been asked ... several times by former officials who
perhaps have not committed the same mistakes as others to support
the creation of a `clean' Communist Party,'' Manescu was quoted as
saying. Manescu said he refused.
   He was foreign minister from 1961 to 1972 and participated in
the founding meetings of the Front after Ceausescu's overthrow.

   The government nearly doubled its
estimate Thursday of how many Ethiopians will need emergency food
this year, from 1.8 million to 3.4 million.
   In its final crop assessment, the Marxist government's Relief
and Rehabilitation Commission also raised its estimate of the food
required from 377,400 tons to 662,709.
   Most victims of the Ethiopian drought are in the northern
provinces of Eritrea and Tigre, where rebel movements are active.
   Three months ago, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization
said at least 4 million people would need 700,000 tons of relief
aid in Eritrea and Tigre.
   At the time, the Ethiopian relief commission called the
prediction exaggerated, misleading and politically motivated.
   Its latest report, however, conceded the commission's own
assessment was essentially the same.
   ``Since our estimate does not include the assistance required to
the nomadic areas, the difference is negligible,'' the government
said.
   In addition to problems caused by drought, the government said,
unseasonal rain had damaged crops in several parts of the country.
It described harvests as generally good in central, western and
northwestern Ethiopia.
   Officials told visiting church leaders from Britain, Canada and
the World Council of Churches last week the government had agreed
on a food distribution program with a consortium of Ethiopian
churches.
   Included in the consortium are the Ethiopian Orthodox Church,
Ethiopian Catholic Secretariate and the Mekane Yesus Evangelical
Church, a Protestant institution. The churches run a program called
the Joint Relief Partnership.
   Neither the government nor consortium has given details of the
plan. The churches also have not said whether they have safe
passage for relief goods from the Tigre People's Liberation Front,
which controls most of Tigre province.
   Another possible complication arose last week when the Eritrean
People's Liberation Front declared the Red Sea port of Massawa,
where supplies would arrive, a war zone. Eritrean rebels have
captured a freighter in the Red Sea and have threatened to sink any
ship found in the Massawa area.
   Eritrean rebels have fought a separatist war for three decades
in Ethiopia's northernmost province. Rebels in Tigre, just to the
south, want to overthrow the central government.

   A second prosecution to seek harsher
sentencing is unlikely for an assailant imprisoned before the man
he stabbed died after almost four years in coma, a state prosecutor
said.
   Although no formal decision has been reached, it is virtually
certain the assailant, Noel Pagan, will not be tried for
manslaughter in the May 1985 stabbing, Assistant Attorney General
Thomas Goodwin said late Wednesday.
   Pagan fought unsuccessfully last year to keep Mark Weaver, the
person he stabbed, alive on a feeding tube so he would not face
additional charges in the case.
   A judge gave permission for Weaver's feeding tube to be removed
last March, and the brain-damaged patient died eight days later at
the age of 26.
   Goodwin said the possibility that the state could obtain a
conviction against Pagan on manslaughter would not justify the use
of resources needed for another trial.
   ``At the time Pagan pled and was sentenced on the aggravated
assault charge, everyone understood that Mr. Weaver was not going
to make it,'' and the judge probably took the inevitable death into
consideration in sentencing Pagan, Goodwin said.
   Pagan pleaded guilty to stabbing Mark Weaver in the neck and was
sentenced to 10 years in prison with five suspended. With accrued
good-behavior time, he served a little more than three years and is
now on probation and living either in Massachusetts or Connecticut,
Goodwin said.
   Sylvia Lane, Weaver's mother, said she had hoped the state would
decide not to prosecute Pagan again. She said she bore him no ill
will.

<HEAD>Key Witness Confessed Before Getting Warning of Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rifleman who participated in the 1968 massacre
of Vietnamese civilians in My Lai blurted out a confession before
being told of his rights, the Army's investigator says in a memoir
published Thursday.
   The witness, Paul D. Meadlo, came to his interrogation more than
a year after the slaughter ``determined to relieve his conscience
and describe the horrors of My Lai,'' retired Col. William Wilson
writes in American Heritage magazine.
   Wilson's investigation for the Army inspector general led to the
court-martial of former Lt. William Calley, Meadlo's platoon
leader, who was to be convicted of leading a slaughter of at least
175 to 200 unarmed men, women and children in the hamlet.
   Wilson said that when he embarked on the case, it was viewed as
fact-finding rather than a criminal investigation. He said he and
Col. Clement Carney, the inspector general's counsel, not wanting
witnesses to clam up, decided not to open interviews with the
warning that incriminating statements could be used in court.
   But Wilson wrote he was shocked at how precipitously Meadlo
admitted participating in the killing.
   Meadlo, weeping, immediately described standing guard over about
80 villagers and Calley ordering ``Waste them!'' Wilson wrote.
Meadlo said Calley then opened fire on the villagers and Meadlo
joined in, spraying four or five clips of ammunition when Calley
told him to shoot.
   ``I stopped him and told him to wait outside the room,'' Wilson
wrote.
   He said he immediately called Carney, who ``instructed me to
give Meadlo his warnings and see if he would repeat the
confession.''
   ``After he was warned that anything he said could be held
against him in a court of law, he said, 'I don't care.' He repeated
his confession,'' Wilson said.
   Meadlo went public with his confession on television later that
year, but when he testified at Calley's trial it was under a grant
of immunity and a threat of being held in contempt.
   Calley was convicted and given a life sentence that was knocked
down eventually to three years of house arrest.

<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Unrest, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran has asked Moscow to withdraw troops
from Azerbaijan and expressed willingness to help settle the
dispute in the Soviet republic, Tehran television reported Thursday.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said the call was contained
in a letter from Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati to his
Soviet counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze.
   The letter was submitted to the Soviet Foreign Ministry on
Wednesday by Iran's ambassador in Moscow, Nasser Heyrani Nowbari,
the television said.
   Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani on Sunday had instructed
Velayati to ``take serious steps to solve problems, end bloodshed
and halt further violence'' in the Soviet republic that borders
northwest Iran.
   At least 171 people have been killed in ethnic violence that
broke out Jan. 13 between the republic's predominantly Moslem
Azerbaijanis and Christian Armenians living there.
   Nationalists in Azerbaijan have turned the ethnic clashes into a
call for secession.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev declared a state of
emergency in the Caucasus republic and sent in Red Army units to
quell the rebellion.
   Nowbari told the Soviet deputy foreign minister, Alexander
Bessmertnykh, that Tehran was ready to offer ``any kind of help to
solve the crisis in a just manner,'' the television said.
   It quoted him as saying that ``by supporting military
intervention in Azerbaijan the West is trying to push the Soviet
Union into deeper crisis.''
   Nowbari announced Iran's willingness to receive a Soviet Foreign
Ministry delegation for talks in Tehran about the crisis, the TV
reported.
   ``This was welcomed by the Soviet Union and it was decided that
the visit should take place soon,'' the report said.
   Iranian leaders have condemned the Red Army's crackdown on
Azerbaijani nationalists, who are predominantly Shiite Moslems, as
are most of Iran's 55 million people.
   The Soviet media have accused Iran of supplying arms to the
nationalists, a charge denied by Iran.
   Gorbachev last week blamed Moslem fanatics for triggering the
violence in Azerbaijan, echoing long-held fears that Iran's Shiite
Moslem zealots who seized power in a 1979 revolution would seek to
export their fiery brand of Islam across the border.
   In an open letter to Gorbachev, an Iranian student group
denounced ``the massacre of Moslems in Soviet Azerbaijan,'' the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   An Iranian daily Thursday accused Washington of encouraging
Gorbachev to send in troops to Azerbaijan in hopes of deepening the
crisis, IRNA reported.
   It quoted the Farsi-language Jomhuri Islamic as saying that the
United States has figured ``any military confrontation between the
Soviet government and the people of Azerbaijan ... will benefit
Washington, because it will disrepute Gorbachev and diminish his
stature as the originator of a national and international reform.''
   Iran's so-called radicals are diehard supporters of spreading
the Islamic revolution to other countries, while Rafsanjani's
pragmatic faction favors an opening to the West.
   Radio Moscow on Tuesday warned Iran that actions ``taken behind
Moscow's back'' in Azerbaijan ``will have irrevocable
consequences.''
   The warning, broadcast on the radio's Farsi-language service,
followed a call by more than half of Iran's 270 parliamentarians
for Moscow to deal with the Azerbaijani Moslems ``with compassion.''
   The radio, clearly telling the Iranians not to interfere in
Azerbaijan, declared: ``Any unconsidered nationalistic or religious
appeals would be dangerous. ... Brutal and illusory nationalistic
flights of fancy have dragged the people to the brink of
precipice.''

<HEAD>Researchers Find Compound Effective Against AIDS In Test Tube</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A synthetic compound has shown in laboratory
experiments to prevent reproduction of the AIDS virus in a way
different than AZT, the only anti-viral drug now approved for use
against AIDS, researchers announced Thursday.
   The compound, a manmade peptide called U-81749, appears to block
the final stage of a process the AIDS virus uses to reproduce
itself in human cells. AZT, or zidovudine, attacks an earlier stage
in the life cycle of the virus.
   ``It (U-81749) drastically slows down and reduces the number of
mature viral particles you get in an infection,'' said Leonard
Post, director of infectious disease research at the Upjohn Co.,
where the compound was developed.
   Post said the compound works by inhibiting the action of
protease, an enzyme used by the AIDS virus to process proteins
during the final stages of its reproduction. The result, he said,
is that the virus cannot make mature copies of itself, and this
prevents the spread of infection to other cells.
   He emphasized that the compound has been used only in test tubes
on cultured cells and that it will be years before such a compound
will be ready for human tests.
   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is caused by the
human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV. When this virus invades a
human cell, it takes over the cell's protein-making machinery to
reproduce itself. During this process, the virus directs the
creation of a number of different proteins. Protease is an enzyme
the virus uses to chop up a large protein molecule, called p55,
into several different types of smaller protein molecules needed to
make a mature HIV particle.
   Post said that by blocking the action of protease, the p55
molecule is not processed and the viral particle does not mature.
   Dr. Bernard Moss, chief of the laboratory of viral diseases at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the
Upjohn research has demonstrated a new vulnerable point in the AIDS
virus.
   ``The major significance of the work is that we are now
attacking another target in the HIV virus,'' said Moss. ``There are
only a limited number of targets in the virus and protease is one
of them. A number of companies will be trying to develop such
agents.''
   Moss said that Smith-Kline Laboratories in Philadelphia has
developed a similar compound.
   Post said study with U-81749 ``tells us we're on the right
track'' in developing a protease inhibitor. He said a whole family
of compounds such as U-81749 are now being evaluated and it may
take up to two years to determine which is the best to use in human
drug trials.
   Moss said that developing a new type of anti-viral AIDS drug to
complement AZT is an important goal in treating the disease. AZT
has not been successful with all patients and some patients develop
serious side effects from the drug.
   ``By giving a combination of drugs that work at different stages
of the life cycle of the virus it may give a better result,'' he
said.
   The U-81749 research was performed in Upjohn laboratories by a
team lead by W.G. Tarpley. A report on the study was published
Friday in Science, the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Senate Upholds Bush Veto of Bill Protecting Chinese Students</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate today upheld President Bush's veto
of a bill protecting Chinese students from deportation, handing him
a narrow foreign policy victory in his first showdown this year
with the Democratic Congress.
   The vote was 62-37, short of the two-thirds margin needed to
override a presidential veto.
   Shortly after the vote, Bush appeared in the White House
briefing room to hail the action as ``reaffirming our commitment to
Chinese students in this country as well as the goal of improving
relations with China.''
   He said that ``no student is going to be sent back against his
or her will'' and that ``we will continue to urge China to respect
the human rights of its citizens.''
   The issue, which would affect an estimated 40,000 Chinese
students studying in the United States, took on added importance as
the year's first test of strength between Bush and the
Democratic-controlled Congress and as a referendum on the
president's China policy.
   Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine said in floor debate that
he would vote against the president to uphold ``America's symbol to
a world that is struggling to throw off the chains of dictators.''
   But Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the issue was ``really
a political challenge to the president's constitutional authority.
I believe the challenge is ill-advised, works against our national
interest, and is likely to cause a further deterioration of our
relationsihp with China.''
   In the days before the vote, the White House had mounted a
fierce lobbying blitz which included telephone calls from Bush and
other top administration officials to wavering senators and
personal visits from Vice President Dan Quayle. The vice president
presided over the chamber during the vote and his spokesman, Dave
Beckwith, said that was his way of ``thanking Republican senators
when they were personally inclined to vote the other way.''
   Former President Richard M. Nixon, who laid the groundwork for
modern U.S.-China relations with a diplomatic opening in the early
1970s, telephoned some senators to say Bush's position was in the
long-term interests of the United States.
   During a lively debate, Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., said some
Democrats were guilty of political opportunism and were using the
veto-override fight to take ``a gratuitous chop at George Bush in a
partisan way.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called that ``hogwash.''
   ``I'd like to believe that there are people here who are
speaking for the freedom lobby,'' Kennedy said, his voice rising.
``We're talking about an issue of fundamental importance that has
swept the world.''
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, noted that many
Republicans had supported the bill originally, including 26 who
urged Bush in a letter not to veto it. ``Now they're being asked to
reverse themselves out of personal loyalty,'' he told reporters
before the vote.
   The House voted 390-25 on Wednesday to crush Bush's veto of the
legislation designed to shield Chinese students in the United
States from deportation and political harassment. Democrats
complained Bush's policies are too warm toward the regime that
killed pro-democracy protesters in Beijing last June 4.
   The legislation applied to as many as 32,000 Chinese students
now in the United States on ``exchange visitor'' visas. The bill
would waive a legal requirement that those students go home for two
years after their visas expire before returning to the United
States or going elsewhere.
   In addition, the bill would permit any Chinese students whose
visas expire _ as many as 8,000 others _ to remain in the United
States as long as danger exists at home, and would allow Chinese
students to work while in this country.
   Bush vetoed the measure on Nov. 30 after it passed unanimously
in the House and by a voice vote in the Senate. Chinese student
groups had lobbied hard for an override, saying many of them would
face political persecution at home because they supported the
pro-democracy demonstrations that brought a violent government
crackdown.
   When Bush vetoed the bill, he ordered government agencies to
adopt what he contends are essentially the same safeguards. The
veto was an effort to preserve executive branch foreign policy
prerogatives, he said, and to keep open the door for future student
and cultural exchanges.
   ``I will not break faith with the Chinese students here. ...
They were safe then, and they are safe now, and they will be safe
in the future,'' Bush told a White House news conference Wednesday.
   He listed steps the Beijing government has taken which he said
justified his policy toward China: the lifting of martial law in
the capital; the release of jailed demonstrators; a promise not to
sell medium-range missiles to Syria; acceptance of Peace Corps
volunteers, Fulbright scholars and a Voice of America correspondent
back into the country, and the muting of anti-U.S. propaganda.
   But critics countered that the missile promise was nothing more
than a repeating of assurances given months before the crackdown,
the effects of martial law remain in place and arrests, harassment
and secret trials of pro-democracy agitators continue. They also
contended Bush's administrative actions to protect the students can
be revoked at any time and could be subject to a court challenge.

<HEAD>Text of President's Drug Statement</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Drug Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President's Bush's
statement Thursday, announcing his drug plan, at a White House
luncheon for newspaper publishers:
   Well, please be seated and please continue with your coffee.
   But it's an honor to have you all here, and there may be no
group in American more aware of the challenges this country is
facing. So my first thought was to give you a general outline of
our agenda after our first year.
   But then I decided to focus on the first item on the domestic
agenda: illegal drugs.
   And they remain this nation's number one concern, and so I chose
this forum to announce the second phase of our fight against drugs.
This booklet is on our national drug control strategy that I hope
we can get distributed to all of you.
   As you know, last September for the first time we launched a
comprehensive, coordinated, and I think coherent national strategy
to stop the distribution and the use of illegal drugs. We've made
some notable progress in the months since the plan was unveiled,
attitudes continue to change.
   Here in Washington, the number of those arrested who test
positive for drugs has dropped dramatically over the past three
months, especially among juveniles.
   And abroad, Colombia has extradited 14 of the world's major drug
merchants to stand trial here in the United States. Given the
headlines we have seen recently though, it's clear that we are only
really getting started. And the plan we laid out last fall outlines
what we intend to do, and today I want to announce the second
phase, as I said, of our strategy which explains how we intend to
do it, agency by agency, task by task, dollar by dollar.
   And today we're releasing a -- what I think of as a blueprint
for success. Our outstanding director, Bill Bennett, Drug Control
Policy Director, will discuss the program later in depth.
   And right now I want to just sketch out if I might a few of the
highlights, and then open the floor to questions.
   Our approach remains consistent. We're commited to the same
aggressive goals and principles that we outlined last September; to
reduce use through an integrated mix of supply and demand side
approaches, and that means doing everything that works.
   Our strategy calls for about a third of its funding to go toward
drug education, prevention, treatment and research. We're calling
for more prevention programs in schools and workplaces as well as
grants for communities to set up education programs.
   In our treatment strategy, we're also emphasizing what works
with careful and constant evaluation of treatment regimes and a new
office for treatment improvements at HHS.
   We're funding new research in areas like law enforcement
technology, treatment and drug use forecasting that will help us
spot trends, and then target our resources and measure the impact
of our strategies.
   And this spring we're going to be releasing the first of an
annual state-by-state status report measuring progress.
   Rougly another third of the budget is devoted to domestic
enforcement, prosecution, incarceration.
   To help local law enforcement initiatives the '91 fiscal budget
calls for nearly $500 million for state and local law enforcement
grants, an increase of 228 percent over the last two years. We want
to get the right resources to the right people on the right level,
street level.
   Today we'll be announcing five high-intensity drug trafficking
areas; cities and areas that are already doing a great deal, but
need more support. And we want to help them map out a more
comprehensive coordinated approach to fight drugs.
   We're also increasing the number of DEA and FBI agents and
personnel as well as more funding for assistant U.S. attorneys.
   We support an increase in federal judgeships.
   We're proposing the death penalty for drug kingpins and those
responsible for drug related killings, and even in some cases,
attempted killings. We want there to be absolutely no doubt about
the certainty of punishment.
   And the final third of our budget is earmarked for border
interdiction and the international operations side. We want the
multinational criminal organizations that produce and distribute
drugs to be more than disrupted. We intend to see them dismantled
and destroyed because we don't make deals with these dealers.
   We have multilateral programs underway in many parts of the
world.
   Throughout Central and South America particularly we're engaged
in expanded and unprecedented levels of cooperation and assistance.
We applaud the efforts of President Virgilio Barco of Colombia and
also of President Salinas, our neighbor -- President Salinas of
Mexico.
   And I will reinforce our support for the courageous leaders of
the region at the upcoming drug summit at Cardagena.
   Among the steps we're taking to intensify border control, up to
an additional 1,000 Customs agents who are already on the job will
be given authority to conduct drug investigations to better assist
the DEA, the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   With interdiction in particular, coordination is absolutely
crucial and we're putting an end, I hope -- and I believe we are
putting an end to turf battles.
   I met with all our top law enforcement people the other day and
they said they had never seen better cooperation between these
powerful, in some instances, but between all the agencies.
   Our budget for all international activities has increased from
$419 million to nearly $700 million. We're creating a new national
drug intelligence center to ensure all enforcement agencies get the
strategic and organizational intelligence that they need.

   Treasury's newly created Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
will improve financial intelligence. And the Department of Defense
has been increasingly effective in its expanded detection and
monitoring roles.
   Now I imagine the news in this chapter of the war on drugs may
be its price tag. Spending understandably gets a lot of attention,
and in this case, outlays continue to increase. But I want to
emphasize our determination to win this fight without adding to the
budget deficit and, yes, I repeat, without raising taxes.
   In 1990, drug funding totaled almost $9.5 billion -- that was in
1990 -- the largest increase in history. Funding for Fiscal '91
will be expanded by more than $1 billion to over $10.5 billion and
outlays will increase 41 percent this year. In fact, with this
request the federal drug budget will be 69 percent higher than it
was when I took office in 1989.
   And to those who say that our program looks top heavy on the
interdiction side, remember that many of the efforts to limit
supply are exclusively federal and inherently are more expensive
than demand reduction.
   We're willing to spend more to limit the drug supply. Simply
put, we're willing to do whatever it takes.
   But the real issue, of course, is not how much. It has got to be
how well. And here the distinction between federal and national is
crucial.
   A truly national drug control strategy demands that we tap
resources of every description -- public and private; civilian and
military; local, state and federal; volunteer, professional and
personal.
   Let me tell you about a man that I know many of you in this room
know, but some may not -- Jim Burke, corporate leader, former CEO
of Johnson and Johnson, who's been applying the power of the media
to unsell drugs, through the Media Partnership for a Drugfree
America, the largest volunteer, private sector ad campaign since
the war bond drives of World War II.
   He's energized. And he's doing a superb job. You're all familiar
with those hard-hitting ads to discourage drug use. Many of you
already contribute space to run them. And that's supporting the
Partnership's current goal to raise $1 million a day in advertising
time and space every day for the next three years, a remarkable
goal indeed.
   And I know that some of you -- Joe Williams of the Memphis
Commerical Appeal, to take a notable example, has made a promotion
of volunteerism, an important part of the newspaper's mission. And
that's also very, very important.
   The free press has a right and a responsibility to comment and
report on a nation's problems, but your newspapers may also
contribute to the progress of the communities they serve by
pointing to solutions.
   And there may be no better outlet for America's volunteer --
volunteer effort, volunteer spirit -- than saving those being lost
to drugs.
   It's too early to tell how our efforts will be judged, but if
more concerned Americans become involved Americans, I believe we
will succeed.

<HEAD>Mayors Say Bush Drug Plan Inadequate</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's big-city mayors on Thursday
dismissed as inadequate the billion-dollar increase in the war on
drugs proposed by President Bush and said it shortchanges their
efforts to treat addicts.
   ``We can't win the war on drugs with $10.6 billion,'' said
Philadelphia Mayor W. Wilson Goode, citing the size of the federal
anti-drug effort proposed by the White House.
   ``It is woefully inadequate,'' said New York Mayor David
Dinkins, whose city was among those that would get special
attention and money as a ``high-intensity'' drug use area under
Bush's proposal.
   ``It'll make some difference, but not much,'' Dinkins said.
   The mayors were attending the winter meeting of the U.S.
Conference of Mayors, a gathering Bush plans to address on Friday.
His appearance will be the first by a president since President
Carter a decade ago.
   Goode and Dinkins, both Democrats, were joined by other
Democratic mayors and two Republicans, Richard L. Berkley of Kansas
City, Mo. and Sue Myrick of Charlotte, N.C. at a news conference
providing the organization's official response. While Bush's plan
won modest praise as a step in the right direction, none of the
mayors suggested the proposal was close to adequate.
   The president of the conference, Democrat President Kathryn J.
Whitmire of Houston, Bush's adopted hometown, said the size of
Bush's proposal suggested the drug problem is not at the top of the
nation's agenda despite political rhetoric to the contrary.
   She said mayors agree the federal government should provide
direct aid to the nation's cities, rather than through state
governments as it does now. A study released by the group this week
found only 15 percent of two key grant programs for law enforcement
assistance made it to city governments last year.
   She said mayors also believe federal anti-drug efforts must be
sufficient for cities to provide drug treatment for all addicts.
Many cities have waiting lists for treatment now.
   The mayors pointed to the $50 billion savings-and-loan bailout
package passed by Congress last year, and said if the nation is
serious about fighting drugs it should provide a similar amount to
this effort.
   ``We believe we could solve the problem if we had $50 billion,''
Goode said.
   San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor said Bush's proposal amounted
to $44 per person, with only a few pennies additional for
treatment, while the S&amp;L bailout costs $208 per person.
   ``Until we put the same amount in fighting drugs, we have not
made it our top priority,'' Whitmire said.
   Several mayors voiced general support for a $14.6 billion
alternative described to them earlier in the day by Senate
Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del.
   Biden's plan would provide immediate treatment for all pregnant
women and young children who want it, and would provide treatment
on demand by any drug abuser in four years, he said.

   Warring nationalists agreed Thursday to a
cease-fire along one of the tense battlefronts of the bloody
conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Tass said.
   The announcement came as Baltic activists, worried that the
dispute might affect their own peaceful push for independence,
offered to help mediate the blood feud between Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
   Iran, which has ethnic and religious ties to Azerbaijan, also
offered to help settle the crisis.
   There were fewer reports of fighting Thursday. Tass said life
was returning to normal in Baku, the Azerbaijani capital that was
the scene of much of the violence.
   During talks in the Armenian town of Yeraskhe, representatives
of the Armenian All-National Movement and the People's Front of
Nakhichevan agreed to lay down their weapons, the Soviet news
agency said.
   ``According to the agreement ... along the entire border between
Armenia and the Nakhichevan Autonomous region all exchanges of fire
between opposing informal groups must stop,'' Tass said.
   Nakhichevan is culturally and politically a part of Azerbaijan,
although it is physically separated from the republic by Armenia,
which lies on its northern border. It is bounded by Iran on the
south and a small section in the west borders Turkey.
   Tass did not say whether the truce was holding. It also was
uncertain whether the two organizations could enforce it.
   Martin Martirosyan, a spokesman for the the Armenian
All-National Movement, said no agreement had been reached yet on an
exchange of hostages. He said three Armenians were being held by
Azerbaijanis.
   Tass also said a truce was reached on the border of Armenia's
Idzhevan district and Azerbaijan's Kazakh district.
   Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis have been feuding
for the past two years primarily over control of Nagorno-Karabakh,
a section of Azerbaijan populated mainly by ethnic Armenians.
   The feud has exploded into a virtual civil war and has fueled a
nationalist movement to make Azerbaijan independent of the Soviet
Union.
   On Jan. 13-14, Azerbaijanis attacked ethnic Armenians living in
the Baku, killing dozens. Fighting between armed groups has killed
dozens more.
   On Jan. 19, Soviet soldiers moved into Baku to smash barricades
set up by nationalists and end the bloodshed. In less than two
weeks of violence, at least 171 people have been killed.
   The 130-mile border between Armenia and Nakhichevan has been
among the most tense in the struggle. On Sunday, a funeral was held
in Yerevan, Armenia, for an Armenian nationalist leader, Mofses
Gorgisyan, who was killed in fighting there last week.
   Witnesses said they have seen nationalists fighting there with
automatic weapons and artillery taken from Soviet soldiers.
   Tass added that a meeting of the leaders of the informal
organizations would take place Saturday to agree on further
separating the militias.
   The fighting is perhaps the biggest internal crisis that has
faced President Mikhail S. Gorbachev during his nearly five years
in power. Gorbachev's fostering of greater freedom has helped spur
the nationalist movements in several Soviet republics and in the
East bloc.
   President Bush praised Gorbachev Thursday as the ``best hope''
in the Soviet Union for the United States, and he declined to fault
him for using force to restore order in Azerbaijan.
   ``I want very much for him to succeed. I think he has conducted
himself in an extraordinarily difficult situation very well. He
remains committed to peaceful change. And I don't think anyone is
faulting him for the difficulties that he has encountered in
Azerbaijan,'' Bush said, giving his strong endorsement to the
Soviet leader for the second straight day.
   In London, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of
Commons she had ``great sympathy'' for Gorbachev as he tries to
keep his nation from unraveling.
   In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, she was quoted as
saying the reunification of Germany _ which one East German
official on Thursday called inevitable _ could topple Gorbachev.
   The pro-independence movements from the Baltic republics of
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia stepped into the dispute between
Armenia and Azerbaijan. They called for nationalist groups in the
warring republics to take part in a peace conference Monday in
Riga, the Latvian capital.
   Spokeswoman Anda Anspoka of the Latvian People's Front in Riga
said the Armenian All-National Movement confirmed it would attend.
   But the Azerbaijani People's Front was not expected to decide
until Friday whether to participate, Usus Samed Ogli, a front
director, said by telephone from Baku. Ogli said front leaders had
gone underground because they fear they will be arrested by the
KGB, but that the group would meet Friday to discuss the peace
conference.
   Political movements in the Baltic republics have been pressing
peacefully for greater autonomy, and have a strong interest in
avoiding the precedent of the military moving in to restore order.
   An airlift of families of ethnic Russian servicemen was
suspended Thursday because the danger had subsided, said Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov. More than 30,000 people
had been evacuated since the airlift began, he added.
   Tass said tensions in Baku were easing. The news agency said
stores were re-opening, a newspaper began publishing again and
transportation was resuming. Earlier, it was reported to be
paralyzed by a strike to protest the Soviet occupation.
   Azerbaijanis have pledged not to end their strikes until Soviet
troops withdraw.
   The republic's Central Committee convened late Wednesday, after
a nighttime curfew began, and ousted Abdul-Rakham Vezirov from the
party, less than a week after he was removed as party chief. He was
accused of making ``serious mistakes'' that led to the crisis.
   Gerasimov said military forces arrested 20 people after boarding
two merchant ships that led a blockade of the Baku harbor that was
broken Wednesday.
   Tass cited Baku Radio as saying troops had detained Mamed
Ali-Zade, chairman of the Defense Committee of the Azerbaijan
People's Front.

<HEAD>Army Officer Pleads Innocent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Army officer pleaded innocent
Thursday to an assault charge for allegedly flipping his wife over
an eighth-floor railing at a hotel.
   The plea was entered for Maj. David Schneider, 34, at a hearing
in Platte County Circuit Court. Judge John Yeaman set a June 11
trial. Schneider remained free on $25,000 bond.
   Schneider stood in uniform with his hands behind his back as his
lawyer, Dick Fickle, waived a formal reading of the charge and
entered the plea. Schneider did not speak.
   The government contends Schneider tried to kill or seriously
injure his 34-year-old wife, Deborah, by flipping her over an
eighth-floor railing at the Embassy Suites Hotel near Kansas City
International Airport on Nov. 4.
   Schneider had told authorities earlier that he had picked up his
wife in a romantic gesture and lost his grip.
   Mrs. Schneider suffered multiple fractures to her legs and
pelvis in the 80-foot fall. She has undergone physical therapy and
uses a walker. Prosecutors said Mrs. Schneider, who has said she
does not remember the circumstances of her injuries, no longer
lives with her husband.
   A 15-year-old girl testified at a hearing last week that she saw
Schneider place one hand on his wife's chest and his other hand on
her back before her fall. The girl said she was standing about 100
feet away on another section of the eighth floor.
   The assault charge carries sentences ranging from 10- to 30-year
prison terms to life in prison.

<HEAD>Tanker Khark 5 May Be Leaking Again, Environment Ministry Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crippled Iranian tanker Khark 5 may again be
leaking crude oil off the Cape Verde Islands in ``a serious
manner,'' said a statement released Thursday by the Environment
Ministry.
   Attempts to transfer 53 million gallons of oil remaining on the
Khark 5 to another tanker are threatened by rough seas near its
position off West Africa, the statement said. The ministry listed
no source of information and there was no independent confirmation
late Thursday from other countries of a leak.
   The Dutch salvage company Smit Tak, which is heading operations
to save the ship and shift its cargo of crude to the Iranian tanker
Shir Khooh, has consistently said all leaking has stopped.
   The Khark 5 lost 19 million gallons of Iranian light crude after
a Dec. 19 explosion ripped a hole in the vessel's hull. Before
drifting seaward, the resulting oil slick threatened Morocco's
fisheries and beaches but authorities said warm offshore waters
helped break up virtually all of the slick.
   Smit Tak hopes to transfer the remaining oil in international
waters about 300 miles from the Cape Verde Islands. After the
blast, Spain, Portugal, Morocco and Cape Verde barred the Khark 5
from entering their 200-mile territorial waters for fear of
pollution.
   Rough winter weather has prevented the salvors from beginning
the three-day pumping operation.
   The explosion, which occurred in stormy weather 400 miles north
of Las Palmas in the Canary Islands, began a fire that forced the
Khark 5's crew to abandon ship. Nobody was injured in the incident,
the cause of which has not been determined.

<HEAD>Costs to Employers Jumped 5 Percent in 1989</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans' wages, salaries and other benefits
rose 5 percent last year, the government said Thursday in a report
that economists took as a sign that high labor costs may worsen the
nation's inflation problems.
   The Labor Department said its Employment Cost Index, considered
one of the best gauges of inflationary wage pressures, showed an
increase equal to the 5 percent rise in 1988 in employment costs.
Rising health care costs, in part, pushed the index forward both
years, the agency said.
   The increases in compensation showed that labor costs are
failing to moderate despite a slower economy, some analysts said.
That's because the slowdown has not pushed the unemployment rate
much above its 15-year low of 5 percent last March. The jobless
rate was 5.3 percent last month.
   ``The slowdown has been too mild to rein in compensation
costs,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust
Co. of Chicago. ``While this is good in the short-term for the
worker, it raises the question that inflation is going to
increase.''
   Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Co., called the
report disappointing because ``it's very hard for me to believe
that overall inflation will come down much.''
   Benefit costs jumped 6.1 percent in 1989, compared to a 6.8
percent gain in 1988. But the 1988 increase was attributed in part
to a 5 percent increase in the employer's Social Security tax rate.
Escalating health insurance costs last year kept the cost of
benefits high even without a big change in the Social Security tax,
the Labor Department said.
   Before 1988, benefit costs had grown consistently for the past
three years at about 3.5 percent.
   ``It's going to be a steady fight to bring that down,''
economist Cynthia Latta of DRI-McGraw Hill said of the 6.1 percent
hike in benefit costs. ``They're trying to pass this on to workers,
and that's going to take a while.''
   While overall employment costs rose, wage and salary increases
lagged behind inflation for the third straight year. They grew by
4.2 percent in 1989, under the year's 4.6 percent inflation rate.
In 1988, wages and salaries were up 4.1 percent while inflation was
4.4 percent.
   According to the Labor Department, employment costs for state
and local government workers rose 6.2 percent, up from 5.6 percent
in 1988.
   It cost private industry employers 4.8 percent more last year to
pay wages, salaries and benefits than it did in 1988, the
department said, compared with a 4.9 percent gain in 1988 over
1987. Federal government costs are not included in the report.
   Sales workers, whose pay is heavily influenced by commissions,
experienced a 7 percent wage jump in 1989, compared with a 6.6
percent gain in 1988 and just a 1 percent gain in 1987.
   Workers in the rapidly expanding service sector of the economy,
where the tight labor market is felt, experienced a 4.5 percent
wage gain, while those working in goods-producing industries saw
their pay increase on average by 3.9 percent.
   For the sixth straight year, non-union workers in private
industry received greater wage and salary increases than did their
unionized counterparts, with the increases averaging 4.1 percent
and 3.1 percent, respectively.
   State and local government workers received on average a 5.3
percent pay gain in 1989, up from the 4.8 percent increase of 1988,
with the increase in that sector highest among hospital workers,
who averaged 6.1 percent pay raises.

   Helmeted police firing into the air charged the
Azerbaijan government office in Moscow late Thursday and briefly
detained three people, witnesses said.
   Police broke a side window of a sedan driven by one Azerbaijani
man, Mekhti Sadirov, as it pulled up to the downtown office and
dented it by hitting the car with the butts of their automatic
weapons, the witnesses said.
   Three men who recently had arrived in Moscow from Azerbaijan,
where unrest has been wracking the region, were taken to a police
station for verification of their documents, said one witness,
Sabinir Shabanov.
   Sadirov, whose car was damaged, was not among those detained.
   The three were released within minutes without charge, Shabanov
said. No one was hurt, and polce provided no immediate explanation.
Police Lt. Col. Dmitri Lyubimov was said to be meeting after
midnight behind closed doors and was not available to discuss the
incident.
   The office serves as headquarters for the government of the
Azerbaijan republic in the Soviet capital, but has been the scene
of news conferences by the Azerbaijan People's Front political
movement and a center for Azerbaijani protests in Moscow.
   Azerbaijan is involved in a violent dispute with neighboring
Armenia over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Soviet
soldiers crashed through barricades of buses and trucks set up in
Baku, the Azerbaijani capital, on Saturday to take control of the
city from armed nationalists.

   President Bush's plan to spend about $10.6
billion on the war against drugs in 1991 sticks to a
heavy-on-law-enforcement theme, with almost four-fifths of the
money devoted to enforcement at home and abroad.
   At the same time, the proposed drug war budget _ up almost 12
percent from this year's spending of $9.5 billion _ would hike
treatment funds by 12 percent to $1.5 billion, and education,
community and workplace use-prevention funds by 11 percent to $1.2
billion.
   The breakdown comes to 42 percent for domestic law enforcement,
29 percent for border drug interdiction and international
operations and 29 percent for demand reduction, said John Walters,
chief of staff to drug policy director William J. Bennett.
   ``To those who say our program looks top-heavy on the
interdiction side, remember that many of the efforts to limit
supply are exclusively federal _ and inherently more expensive than
demand reduction,'' Bush said in a speech to newspaper publishers
as he unveiled the updated version of the strategy announced in
September.
   ``We're willing to spend more to limit the drug supply. Simply
put, we're willing to do whatever it takes.''
   If Congress goes along with Bush, local and state officials will
get their hands on $2.6 billion, or about one-fourth of the total,
through grants for law enforcement, treatment and prevention
efforts, a 108 percent increase over the last two years.
   The five regions designated as high-intensity drug-trafficking
areas _ New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston and the Southwest
border of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas _ will benefit
from total federal efforts of about $1.2 billion this year and, if
Congress approves, $1.4 billion in 1991.
   The agency that would get the largest chunk of the $10.6 billion
is the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration, part
of the Department of Health and Human Services, which would be
given $1.4 billion. Of that, $577 million would be for block grants
for drug-treatment programs, an increase of $100 million.
   The agency that would receive the second largest amount is the
Pentagon with $1.2 million, of which $638 million would go for
detection and monitoring of drug traffickers crossing the U.S.
borders and $227 million would be for operational costs such as
flying and sailing time, Walters said.
   The State Department's Agency for International Development
would get $224 million, up from $48 million. Much of the money
would go to aid the Andean countries, where most of the world's
cocaine is produced.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration would get $700 million, up
from $549 million, to raise the number of DEA personnel from 5,224
to 5,601. Elsewhere in law enforcement, the budget envisions money
for about 410 additional federal prosecutors, an additional 100 FBI
workers and 75 new federal judges.
   Overall, criminal justice spending would increase 2 percent to
$4.3 billion; international initiatives would shoot up 65 percent
to $690 million; interdiction efforts would increase 17 percent to
$2.4 billion; research would rise 20 percent to $383 million; and
intelligence efforts would zoom up 142 percent to $172 million.
   In other areas, the drug strategy:
   _Calls for almost doubling funds for eradication of domestic
marijuana production, to $35 million in 1991. This was done in
part, Walters said, to show foreign governments urged by the United
States to stamp out their drug production that the U.S. government
is serious about wiping out domestically produced supplies as well.
   _Envisions spending $400 million in prevention and treatment for
pregnant women who use drugs and for their children, part of an
effort to combat the problem of ``cocaine babies'' and those born
addicted to other drugs.
   _Continues the Andean strategy, launched last September, by
spending $2.2 billion over five years in drug law enforcement and
economic development funds for Colombia, Peru and Bolivia. The
proposed budget would increase from $217 million in 1990 to $423
million in 1991, including $50 million in additional aid for
Colombia, Walters said.
   The five areas of the country designated as high-intensity
drug-trafficking areas appear on the surface to be slated to
receive only $25 million this year and $50 million next year.
   But they actually will receive help worth a total of about $1.2
billion this year and, presuming Congress agrees, $1.4 billion next
year. Most of the aid would be in the form of additional federal
agents assigned to those areas to enhance law enforcement and
interdiction efforts. But some of that money will come in the form
of block grants similar to those being given out nationwide.
   According to Bruce Carnes, Bennett's budget specialist, the New
York City area, which could include Nassau County in New York and
Union, Hudson and Essex counties in New Jersey, would receive $396
million worth of help in 1990 and $436 million in 1991.
   Los Angeles, which could include Los Angeles and Orange
counties, could get $151 million in 1990 and $169 million in 1991.
   Miami, which could include Broward, Dade and Monroe counties,
could get $196 million in 1990 and $223 million in 1991.
   Houston, which could include Harris and Galveston counties,
could get $168 million in 1990 and $187 million in 1991.
   The Southwest border, which could include 35 counties in
California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas, could receive $330
million in 1990 and $368 million in 1991.
   The total number of federal anti-drug workers targeted to each
area is envisioned as: New York, 250; Los Angeles, 300; Miami, 300;
Houston, 200, and the Southwest border, 700, Carnes said.

   Law enforcement officials in President Bush's newly designated
high-intensity drug-trafficking areas said they were pleased with
the prospect of more dollars and more attention focused on their
regions.
   ``We certainly need more people down there,'' said Jim Piatt,
regional commissioner for the U.S. Customs Service based in
Houston. ``We need more people looking at cars coming across the
border. We need more officers looking at cargo. We need more canine
teams. ... We need more technology.''
   The president Thursday proposed a $1.1 billion increase in
drug-fighting funds on a wide variety of fronts, including new
spending in five high-priority areas: New York, Miami, Houston, Los
Angeles and the Mexican border area from Texas to California.
   Piatt said the mere designation of Houston and the border as
drug target areas was very important.
   ``What that's going to do is beyond whatever additional money
Houston gets with this drug strategy, what it's going to do is add
focus. All the various federal agencies are going to realize
they're going to have to put more resources into these areas to
work on this drug problem. So I think there are going to be a lot
of spinoff benefits.''
   He called Houston ``a conduit for smuggling across the border.
... There's a lot of drug drug money that's floating around. To the
extent that we can work on joint money laundering projects, a lot
of that money can go right back to the city.''
   On the technology side, he suggested that ``There's got to be a
way we can X-ray vehicles and trucks. That would certainly make us
far more effective than we are now.''
   In Miami, Customs Commissioner Carol Hallet said she was
``delighted'' with the new initiative.
   ``We are in this war to win it and Customs, the Coast Guard and
the DEA will help us see an end to this scourge that is a global
problem.''
   ``We will study the high intensity areas to see what needs to be
done.''
   The new federal funds includes increases for education and
treatment, but the focus in the Miami region will continue to be on
halting drug shipments, Ms. Hallet said.
   Customs, she said, will ``continue to be the lead agency when it
comes to interdiction on the land. We will be adding not only
agents but additional inspectors and K-9 teams.''
   Miami Mayor Xavier Suarez said he has always been pleased with
federal help in anti-drug efforts in the region, but wished the new
money would give local officials had more say in how it was spent.
   ``We'd like to have some discretion on the use of the money,''
he said.
   Two Southern California congressmen said the declaration of Los
Angeles County as a high-intensity drug trafficking area was a long
overdue step.
   Rep. Mel Levine said the Bush administration ``seems to
understand the seriousness and magnitude of the drug problem facing
Los Angeles County'' but must allocate even more resources to the
area.
   ``The resources announced today are woefully inadequate and need
to be dramatically increased,'' Levine said in a statement.
   Rep. Howard Berman, who like Levine is a Democrat, said the
administration should have taken the step a year ago and in the
meantime much ground was lost.
   ``I hope the administration realizes that, excellent as this is,
it's jut a start,'' Berman said.
   In New York, Mary Cooper, a spokeswoman for the New York region
of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said officials in her
office were meeting Thursday to discuss the anticipated extra funds.
   And New York City police Sgt. Ralph St. Just said if any of the
funds make it to the local level, that's when NYPD will decide.
``We've got to have it in our possession before we decide what
we're going do with it,'' said St. Just.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem factions fought
shelling duels in south Lebanon on Thursday and President Elias
Hrawi's government endorsed a plan that would ban militias in
Moslem west Beirut.
   Christian radio and television stations ended a week-long
newscast strike after a compromise was worked out with Gen. Michel
Aoun, leader of a renegade Christian army, on the titles of rival
government leaders.
   Police said at least five fighters of the pro-Iran Hezbollah, or
Party of God, were wounded when a tank cannon fired by the
mainstream Shiite Amal militia blasted their position in Iqlim
al-Tuffah.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing
regulations, said Amal and Hezbollah were reinforcing their
positions and massing fighters in an apparent preparation for
resuming ground offensives.
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll to 98 killed and
286 wounded since Dec. 23, when the latest round of Amal-Hezbollah
clashes for control of the 1.2 million Shiites broke out in the
province.
   The Shiites are the largest community in Lebanon, which has a
population of 4 million people belonging to 17 sects.
   Renewal of the Amal-Hezbollah confrontation after a 16-day
relative lull underlined the failure of Iranian and Algerian
mediations to halt the intermittent, 2-year-old conflict that has
killed 930 people and wounded 2,753.
   Police said renewal of the Amal-Hezbollah hostilities led to an
exodus from disputed villages of the mountain regions, east of the
southern provincial capital of Sidon.
   ``The few civilians who had returned to their homes during the
lull left late Wednesday,'' the police spokesman said.
   Meanwhile, Hrawi's government announced that it approves a new
security plan banning militias from operating in Beirut's western
sector.
   Soldiers of Gen. Emile Lahoud's 22,000-strong army loyal to
Hrawi are to carry out the new security plan ``soon,'' the
statement said. It did not set a date.
   The statement said the Lebanese soldiers are to deploy in west
Beirut in ``coodination with the Syrian forces.'' It did not
disclose further details.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the new
security plan covers the western edge of south Beirut, but not the
slums that are a traditional Hezbollah stronghold.
   ``The Lebanese army will not move into Bir el-Abed and the other
Hezbollah districts in south Beirut,'' the source said without
further elaboration.
   Some of the 18 Western hostages are believed held by
Hezbollah-affiliated underground factions in the slums of south
Beirut where the Syrians do not maintain any presence.
   The security plan, reached earlier this week during three days
of talks between Hrawi and Syrian President Hafez Assad in
Damascus, appears to be similar to one applied by the Syrians when
they moved into west Beirut to end three years of militia anarchy
Feb. 22, 1987.
   Leftist and Moslem militias were then banned by the Syrians from
operating in west Beirut and Hezbollah maintained its control over
the city's southern slums.
   However, leftist and Moslem gunmen re-emerged in west Beirut
last summer during a six-month artillery confrontation between the
Syrians and Aoun's 20,000 troops. The Syrians made no moves to
prevent the militias from returning to the capital.
   Aoun has vowed to drive the Syrians from Beirut and has refused
to recognize or take part in the Christian-Moslem government headed
by Hrawi and formed last year with Syrian support.
   Christian radio stations resumed newscasts Thursday after media
in the Christian enclave reached a compromise with Aoun.
   According to the compromise, reported by Voice of Lebanon and
Voice of Free Lebanon radio stations, Hrawi will be referred to
only as ``Mr. Elias Hrawi.''
   The compromise also allows the media to refer to Aoun only as
``Gen. Michel Aoun'' and not as interim prime minister.
   Hrawi, immediately upon his election as president Nov. 24,
dismissed Aoun as army commander and interim prime minister.
   Aoun on Jan. 16 banned the media from referring to Hrawi as
president, recalling that he had declared Parliament dissolved to
prevent the election of a pro-Syrian head of state.

   This is the text of President Bush's Thursday
news conference on the Senate vote to uphold his veto on
legislation affecting Chinese students in the United States:
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Well, I have two subjects I'd like to address
myself to. First, I want to acknowledge the vote in the Senate
upholding my veto this afternoon and reaffirming our commitment to
Chinese students in this country as well as the goal of improving
relations with China. No Chinese student in this country is going
to be sent _ sent back against his or her will. And we will
continue to urge the People's Republic of China to recognize the
human rights of its citizens to participate in the affairs of the
world community.
   And I do want to express my personal thanks to the leadership of
the Republican Party in the Senate _ Sen. Dole, Sen. Simpson _ who
led this effort with courage and determination. And a special
thanks to all of those members who voted for the values of justice
and human freedom that I believe were at stake in this question.
   Secondly, this morning, I called President Endara of Panama to
assure him of our continuing support of his efforts to establish
democracy in Panama. Now part of this effort involves the
establishment of a healthy economy, and I am deeply impressed with
his commitment to reform Panama's economy. And based on this
commitment and the report I received from Larry Eagleburger and
John Robson with us here, I informed President Endara that we'd
arrived at an economic assistance package to help assist Panama in
its economic recovery.
   Our plan, valued at about a billion dollars, includes 500
million in humanitarian assistance for housing, emergency public
works, business assistance, loans, guarantees and export
opportunities, and then a $500 million _ in addition _ assistance
package for balance of payment support, public investment and
economic restructuring. The vice president will review the details
of this plan with President Endara on his visit to Panama. And
we're going to work closely with the Congress on this package to
ensure its prompt implementation. The economic challenges that
Panama faces are great, but we will work with the people to build a
prosperous democratic nation.
   I've just met again with Secretaries Robson and Eagleburger and
they believe, given the history in Panama, the business side, that
this economic assistance can indeed result in the short-run, in a
very _ in a vastly improved economic situation. Helen?
   Q: Mr. President, isn't it about time that you told the American
people what were the results of two secret missions to China,
whether you got any kind of promise from Beijing for losening up
and becoming a more tolerant society? And will this victory lead
now _ lead you to try to lift the sanctions against China?
   A: Well, I think I addressed myself to that yesterday, but let
me repeat, I was very pleased at their lifting of martial law, I
was very pleased at the release of 573 people from jail in a kind
of an amnesty. I've said that these weren't all the steps that need
to be taken. I'm very pleased that they've stopped harassing the
United States mission there, our embassy in Beijing. I'm very
pleased that they've lightened up on the areas where I think we can
really move things forward, and that is the Peace Corps and the
Fulbright exchanges.
   So, this was all part of the debate on the Hill. And I must say
that I think that _ the fact that they had made those moves carried
some weight with some of the senators.
   Q: Well, is that the promise that you were given? And they say
now that martial law is still _
   A: No promises. I'm looking for action; not words.
   Q: How about the sanctions?
   A: That's a third question. And _ what sanctions? Which part of
the sanctions?
   Q: The military technical assistance _
   A: Well, we're looking at the whole performance scale, and I
expect they are, too. So _ but I'm very, very pleased with the
results on the Hill today. Yeah, Terry?

<TEXT>
   President Gen. Ibrahim Babangida signed a
decree Thursday reducing the military government's power to detain
people without charge from six months to six weeks.
   The decree, imposed in 1984, permitted senior government
officials to order the detention without charge of people deemed to
be security threats. The detention orders allowed detention of up
to a half-year, and could be renewed.
   The new decree limits detentions to six weeks, at which time
they can be renewed but must be reviewed by a panel made up of
government officials, religious leaders, a retired judge, a
representative of the Nigerian Bar Association and others.
   The decree also authorizes only the general chief of staff of
the military to order detentions. Previously the minister of
international affairs and inspector general of police also had the
power to authorize detentions.
   In announcing the amendments, Justice Minister Bola Ajibola said
the government was bowing to demands for a relaxation of the decree
from human rights groups and the bar association.

   Q: Mr. President, there are 535 members of Congress; 62
supported you on this veto. Do you view that as any kind of a _
(aside to other reporter) _ no, overall _ (returning) _ do you view
that as a mandate for your policies _
   A: Yeah. Because you've got to give disproportionate weight to
how the Executive Branch feels. We're an equal branch. So you add
to that the support on the Hill; we come out more than equal.
   Q: And does it give you any support for new initiatives toward
China?
   A: It gives me _ the thing I like about it, given the mournful
predictions of some a couple of weeks ago, is that it gives me the
confidence that I'm going to go forward the way I think is correct
here. And I've had a lot of chance to talk to people that voted
with us and some that didn't. And I understand their sensitivities,
and I vow to do a better job of informing them as these things
develop as to what it is we're intending. But I'm very, very
pleased with the results _ for reasons that I'm sure everybody out
here can understand. Yeah, Brit. And then Charles.
   Q: Mr. President, back to the Chinese students for a moment.
Does your commitment that no Chinese student would be sent back
against his or her will _ does that run absolutely or is that
something that will run until such time as you feel that China has
changed its ways in some way that meets your approval?
   A: ``Against his will _ his or her will'' is the controlling
statement, yeah. Yeah, Charles?
   Q: Mr. President, on the aid to Panama, some assessments say 1
billion is only a fraction of what it will need to restore the
effects down there. What is your assessment? And what are people
saying? Is this what you're hearing?
   A: Well, I'm basing my judgment on what President Endara said
and on the recommendations of the economic mission that went there.
And President Endara seemed very pleased at this. I said to him,
``If there's additional categories where we can _ in which we can
be helpful, please let me know.'' But I think he was very pleased.
And I think both Larry and John feel that it is a very good step;
whether it's the last step or not, I don't know. We've got to see
how that private sector responds, and how _ you know, how the
economic recovery goes forward. But I wouldn't say this is the end
of the road in terms of what we can do to help them.
   Q: Is there a full assessment of what the total cost will be?
   A: Well, I think they feel that this is ``Let's go here, see
what happens, and then take another look.'' Some may come up with
higher figures, but this is what we think is a good and full
program to give them the help they need right now. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, have you been personally briefed on the exact
number of people left homeless as a result of the US invasion of
Panama, and when, specifically sir, can they expect to get new
homes to replace those _
   A: I think these programs will give instant _ or as close as
instant relief as we can hope for here. In fact, there's a
provision _ I'd like to ask Larry and John to take a couple of
questions after I bail out on this that will address themselves in
more specificity, because I don't have the exact number there, but
I would like to help as best I can with the reconstruction. Yes,
John?

   President Bush, vowing ``to do whatever it
takes,'' proposed a $1.1 billion increase Thursday for the war
against drugs, targeting more money for a Pentagon attack on
cocaine traffickers and urging the death penalty for drug kingpins.
   Overall, Bush's package would total $10.6 billion and boost the
cost of the nation's drug-fighting strategy in fiscal 1991 by 11.6
percent over current spending of $9.5 billion.
   A rival plan from the chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., would cost $14.6 billion,
give the president's drug policy coordinator Cabinet status and
outlaw semiautomatic weapons.
   Bush said he expects the Senate will try to approve a higher
budget than he is asking, but said, ``We do sense a desire on the
part of the Congress to cooperate. ...
   ``In terms of the objectives of this strategy, we're in pretty
close accord with both Democrats and Republicans on the Hill, so I
think we can get early action,'' Bush said. Early congressional
reaction split predictably along party lines.
   Calling drugs ``this nation's No. 1 concern,'' Bush announced
his proposal in a White House speech to newspaper editors.
   The plan is the second phase of the drug war strategy unveiled
in September and targets five areas for intensified federal
drug-fighting efforts.
   While claiming progress in the drug war, Bush said, ``Given the
headlines we've seen recently, it's clear we're only getting
started.''
   In response to a question, Bush said he felt ``great sadness,
great tragedy'' over the arrest of District of Columbia Mayor
Marion Barry on misdemeanor cocaine charges.
   ``My thought went to the kids, kids in the schools. It's a
matter of sadness, and Barbara (Bush's wife) shares my view on
this.''
   The president also vowed ``to hold the line'' against proposals
to legalize drugs.
   ``We're willing to spend more to limit the drug supply,'' Bush
said, calling his package ``a blueprint for success.''
   ``Simply put, we're willing to do whatever it takes,'' he said.
   His plan designates five regions _ New York, Los Angeles, Miami,
Houston and the Southwest border of California, Arizona, New Mexico
and Texas _ as high-intensity drug-trafficking areas.
   Federal anti-drug efforts in those areas will benefit from
millions of dollars in additional federal help this year and next.
   The current budget allocates $25 million for the worst-afflicted
areas, plus up to $21 million more from the federal asset
forfeiture fund, said Reggie Walton, associate director of
Bennett's office. The 1991 budget calls for $50 million for those
areas.
   Bush said one-third of his drug-control budget would go toward
education, prevention and treatment programs; another third to
domestic enforcement and the final third for border interdiction
and international operations.
   Bennett's office, however, said that 29 percent of the money
would go for education and other demand-reduction efforts, 42
percent for domestic enforcement and 29 percent for border
interdiction and international efforts.
   The largest spending increase would go to the Pentagon to expand
its drug-fighting role. It would receive $1.2 billion, up from
about $878 million in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
   About $638 million of the Pentagon funds would be earmarked for
detection and monitoring of traffickers trying to enter the country
with illicit drugs.
   Moreover, the plan envisions ``ship- and aircraft-detection
activities in the Caribbean Sea in concert with foreign
governments.''
   ``Our approach remains consistent ... to reduce use through an
integrated mix of supply- and demand-side approaches. And that
means doing everything that works,'' Bush said.
   The second-largest increase would be for the Department of
Health and Human Services' Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health
Administration, which would have its budget increased from $1.2
billion to $1.4 billion.
   That includes almost $577 million in block grant money for
drug-treatment programs, an increase of $100 million.
   Bush said he was proposing an increase in FBI and drug
enforcement agents, as well as 75 new federal judges.
   ``We are proposing the death penalty for drug kingpins and those
responsible for drug-related killings, and even, in some cases,
attempted killings,'' Bush said.
   ``We want there to be absolutely no doubt about the certainty of
punishment,'' he said. Currently, the maximum penalty for ``leaders
of continuing criminal enterprises'' is life imprisonment.
   ``We want the multinational criminal organizations that produce
and distribute drugs to be more than disrupted _ we intend to see
them dismantled and destroyed because we don't make deals with
dealers,'' Bush said.
   He also praised efforts by the leaders of Mexico and Colombia in
fighting drug traffickers and said said he would ``reinforce our
support for the courageous leaders of the region'' at the Feb. 15
drug summit in Colombia.
   Congressional reaction to the president split largely along
party lines, with Democrats saying more money is needed to get to
the root of the drug problem and Republicans lauding Bush for
seeking $1.1 billion more for the drug war.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. and chairman of the House Narcotics
Committee, said the Bush plan failed to address lack of education
and unemployment, which Rangel said must be faced as part of the
drug battle.
   Biden said Bush should target casual users less and hard-core
addicts more.
   But Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., said Bush's plan ``signals the
kind of get-tougher approach that the public is crying for. ...
   ``When the mayor of the capital city of the free world is
arrested for crack use, the American public knows that the drug
situation in this country has gotten out of hand.''

<TEXT>
   Q: I know you're talking about foreign policy, but may I ask you
a drug question since you were talking about that today, though?
   A: Yes, sir?
   Q: Given the fact that in your inaugural address you talked
about the promise to stop the scourge of drugs and given the fact
that today you told the newspaper publishers that drugs was at the
top of your agenda, is this going to be the primary test for your
administration in its first four years, at least, in its primary
domestic phase, assuming the economy doesn't fall apart? Is this
the big one?
   A: I think it's the big one, and I think it's a test not for the
administration, but for every community in the country, every
state, every local _ local government, for the people. And somebody
asked me if you had to set goals, changes in the education system
or _ but where could you most readily hope to see results, I would
say in the anti-narcotics fight. I think it's really that kind of
priority. Yes, Dave?
   Q: Mr. President, can you _
   A: You're next, Michael.
   Q: Going back to China, you gave us an accounting of why Gen.
Scowcroft went in December, but I wonder if I could ask you to go
back to July. Could you give us an accounting of that trip? What
happened? What did you learn? Why did you send him then?
   A: To see _ to make clear to the Chinese leadership that the
relationship is important, but that it could not go forward until
certain changes were _ had taken place, and that, in sum, is what
it was about.
   Q: Was it your initiative or theirs, sir?
   A: Mine. My initiative. Yeah?
   Q: Back to the override vote. Does this suggest to you, your
victory today, that, if you can win here, you can win on anything
with Congress?
   A: No, because I think we had very good case here. If I took a
case up there that wasn't any good, well, I'd probably get beat.
But this one, I think people, you know, were willing to listen,
some that had been positioned opposed to it, opposed to my
position. And I think when they heard the full argument, I think
they decided, ``Well, we should support the President on this one.''
   Q: Could you expand a little bit on that, Mr. President? Given
that you've pointed out repeatedly that you have done
administratively what Congress sought to do legislatively _
   A: Yeah.
   Q: _ why was it so important to win this vote?
   A: Well, I said yesterday, I mean for several reasons. One
reason, I think there was a political ingredient in it and nobody
likes to get (unintelligible) on that. And also I think, from a
foreign policy standpoint, I think it's better to do it this way. I
think there is a trust factor that hopefully will result in changes
that are satisfactory to the American people and to me _ a trust
factor in the administration. And I hope that I can use that,
having won this now, to further the kinds of things that I think
will help move China forward.
   See, just as _ back _ I think that the unilateral decision by
President Nixon to send Kissinger on a secret mission to establish
contact in days when they were far darker in China's U.S. relations
was a good decision. And I think the decisions I've made are good
decisions. I can understand the controversy and I can understand
why there wasn't _ excuse me _ a unanimous endorsement, but I view
this _ I'm not _ I view it as a very good step. I will pledge right
here to work with the Congress. I love the way the debate ended
with both Sens. Mitchell and Dole saluting each other for the way
in which the matter was discussed, and I think that's a good signal
for the political fights that may lie ahead. And _ Michael?
   Q: If I could follow up on David's question _
   A: Yeah.
   Q: _ you said that Mr. Scowcroft's trip in July, the Chinese
were told certain things had to happen for the relationship to go
forward. Could you elaborate on those things _
   A: No, I can't do it.
   Q: _ tell us what happened?
   A: No, because I think that we've seen China take certain steps
and in diplomacy, I don't think you make progress by throwing down
a list of things telling somebody else how to behave. I do think
you adhere to your own principles and I think sometimes you have to
undertake the kind of diplomacy that I engaged in here to reiterate
principles and to explain the severity of problems to people. But
if you do it publicly all the time and you do it so you're painting
somebody into a corner, I don't think you get results and that's
why I did what you've done.
   Q: Is the status of Mr. Fang one of those things that needs to
be resolved?
   A: I hope they _ it certainly is a matter that's on _ that I
would like to see resolved. Yes? Yeah, Jim?

   Ava Gardner, who lived a Hollywood siren's life of
fast cars, failed marriages and heated affairs but failed to find
happiness in love or in her 60-film movie career, died Thursday at
her west London home. She was 67.
   Paul Mills, a long-time friend who announced the death, said she
had been ill with pneumonia.
   The dark-haired, green-eyed actress, born a farmer's daughter,
fled Hollywood for Europe in the 1950s.
   She complained, ``The image I seem to have, that I'm a
loudmouthed, temperamental, oversexed, sultry siren, sometimes
terrifies me.''
   Miss Gardner was married briefly to actor Mickey Rooney and to
big band leader Artie Shaw, and for six years to singer Frank
Sinatra.
   ``I loved them all,'' she said of her husbands, ``but I never
understood any of them, and I don't think they understood me.''
   ``She was a wonderful lady, wonderful lady,'' said Burt
Lancaster, who starred with her in ``The Killers,'' the film that
launched her sex goddess image in 1946.
   ``She was a very simple lady. She used to come down to the beach
with us and cook and play with the kids,'' Lancaster said from his
home in Los Angeles.
   ``She was probably the most beautiful woman I ever met ... sheer
enchantment,'' said Donald Sinden, who appeared with her in 1953 in
``Mogambo.''
   The film, which also starred Clark Gable and Grace Kelly,
brought Miss Gardner her only Academy Award nomination.
   The star of such films as ``On the Beach,'' ``Night of the
Iguana,'' ``Show Boat,'' ``The Barefoot Contessa'' and ``The Snows
of Kilimanjaro'' regarded herself as a simple country girl who
would have traded all the glitter for one happy, long-lasting
marriage.
   ``That's what I grew up hoping to find: One good man I could
love and marry and cook for and make a home for, who would stick
around for the rest of my life,'' she said in an interview with
London's Daily Express in 1982.
   ``I never found him.''
   She also had well-publicized romances with billionaire Howard
Hughes, actors George C. Scott and Robert Mitchum, Spanish
bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguin, Cuban playboy Porfirio Rubirosa
and Italian comedian Walter Chiari.
   After leaving Hollywood in 1958 she was sometimes seen dancing a
passionate flamenco in Madrid, and survived two road accidents in
the high-power cars she raced down narrow Spanish roads.
   Ava Lavinia Gardner was born Dec. 24, 1922 in Grabtown, N.C.,
the youngest of six children of cotton and tobacco farmer Jonas
Gardner.
   Her father lost the farm when she was 2 and later he worked in a
sawmill in Newport News, Va., where her mother Mary Elizabeth ran a
boarding house.
   When she was 18, she visited her older sister, Bea, in New York.
Bea's husband, photographer Larry Tarr, shot dozens of pictures of
her and displayed one in his studio.
   Barney Dunham, then a clerk in MGM's New York legal department,
urged Tarr to send some pictures to Hollywood. The result was a
screen test and a $50-a-week contract.
   Her first film role came in ``We Were Dancing'' in 1942, the
year she married Rooney. He was 21 and she was 19. The union lasted
20 months.
   ``My heart is broken with the loss of my first love,'' Rooney
said in a statement released in Los Angeles.
   She met Shaw at a Hollywood nightclub. They married in October
1945. Shaw took books to read on their honeymoon. Miss Gardner
later suffered a nervous breakdown, and the marriage ended a year
and a week after it began.
   In 1950 she met Sinatra, who was married and mired in a career
slump. They were married in November 1951 and divorced in July 1957.
   Each was an only child, she said of her husbands. ``And each one
was basically a musician. Highly talented and, uh, highly strung.''
   Then, rolling her eyes, she added: ``That's putting it mildly,
baby.''
   She moved permanently to London in 1968.
   ``I'm one Hollywood broad who hasn't taken the sleeping tablets,
tried to slash my wrists or kick a cop,'' she told one interviewer.
``London gave me back my sanity.''
   She complained to an interviewer on her 60th birthday, ``The
trouble was that I was a victim of image. Because I was promoted as
a sort of siren and played all those sexy broads, people made the
mistake of thinking I was like that off the screen.
   ``They couldn't have been more wrong. ... I am pathologically
shy. I was a country girl and I still have a country girl's rather
simple, ordinary values.
   ``No one ever wanted to know the real me at all. They preferred
the myths _ the roaring lady who smashed champagne glasses and
seduced bullfighters.''
   That was her role, hard-living Lady Brett in the 1957 film
version of Ernest Hemingway's novel, ``The Sun Also Rises.''
   Joseph Mankiewicz, who directed her as the wild Spanish dancer
in ``The Barefoot Contessa,'' said in Los Angeles Thursday, ``I
don't think Ava ever put body and soul into her performance. She
put body and soul into living a life.'' Miss Gardner said in
announcing in 1958 she was quitting MGM, the studio that brought
her to Hollywood in 1941:
   ``MGM was never the right studio for me. They ... never knew
what to do with me. Most of the time, they loaned me out.''
   In one of her last roles, she appeared on the CBS-TV series
``Knots Landing'' in 1985.
   Mills said Miss Gardner's body would be taken to Smithfield,
N.C. for burial alongside her parents.
   He said Miss Gardner had not felt completely healthy since
suffering a stroke in 1986, and for three months had been unable to
take her Corgi dog for walks in Hyde Park.
   ``She was joking last night,'' Mills said. ``My wife is one of
her oldest friends. They were on the phone talking last night, and
she was a little bit sad because she wanted to be better.''
   A sister, Myra Pearce of Winston-Salem, N.C., said Miss
Gardner's housekeeper called her early Thursday to say the actress
had died in her sleep.

<HEAD>Cheney Sending Congress Sweeping Base Hit List</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is sending
Congress a sweeping list of proposed military base closures and
reductions in moves President Bush pledged on Thursday will not
``cut the muscle of our defense.''
   While Bush and Cheney have both declined to outline the exact
number or scope of the changes, Pentagon and congressional sources
said the suggestions target dozens of installations.
   ``I have a three-inch folder on my desk'' outlining the changes,
said one Pentagon official.
   Last week, Cheney promised that the hit list would be
``extensive,'' above and beyond the 86 domestic bases that Congress
agreed last year would be closed. A blue-ribbon panel made that
recommendation, a device widely expected to be resurrected in order
for Congress to swallow any of the proposed changes.
   Cheney is slated to formally unveil the list on Monday, but
officials have already begun notifying congressional delegations of
the proposed shut-downs and changes, congressional sources said.
   The Pentagon and congressional sources, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, warned that last-minute changes could be made, given
the volatile political nature of the suggested cuts.
   The sources said the list of suggested closures and reductions
has targeted, among others:
   _The Philadelphia Naval Shipyard, a shipbuilding and repair
center which has 9,000 military and 20,000 civilian workers.
   _In California, San Francisco's Treasure Island Naval Station,
the Alameda Naval Air Station, the Oakland Naval Supply Center and
the Oakland Naval Hospital, as well as the Long Beach Naval
Shipyard.
   _The Army's Fort Monroe, a training center in Hampton, Va.
   _The Army's 2nd Armored Division at Fort Hood, Texas, which
would be disbanded under the plan. About 10,000 soldiers,
one-fourth of Fort Hood's troop population, are connected with the
armored division at the base, the largest military installation in
the free world.
   Part of the division is stationed in Europe and Pentagon
officials stressed that any reduction in forces there would be
along the lines of superpower arms control reduction pacts.
   _Fort Ord, Calif., would be closed, and the 7th Infantry
Division stationed there would be transfered to Fort Lewis, Wash.
   _The 9th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis is slated to be sharply
cut back.
   _Besides the reductions in Europe, several military
installations in the Pacific are also on tap for closure, the
sources said.
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he could neither confirm nor deny
speculation that besides Fort Hood, Bergstrom Air Force Base and
the Red River Army Depot might be affected.
   Gramm said he did not believe any ``hard and fast decisions''
had been made and that the speculation of targeted bases could be
nothing more than ``trial balloons'' being floated by the Pentagon.
   As the reports surfaced, accusations and denials of partisanship
surfaced.
   One Pentagon source argued that officials weren't being
political about the changes because ``some of the best friends of
the military,'' such Rep. Marvin Leath, D-Texas, a member of the
Armed Services Committee, had bases in their districts that had
been targeted.
   However, Leath _ whose district contains Fort Hood _ has
announced that he will retire at the end of this year.
   ``If we were really partisan, we'd be going into (Rep.) Patricia
Schroeder's (D-Colo.) backyard,'' he said. ``Really, this is all
designed to make military sense.''
   But some of the congressional sources contended that liberal
Democrats' districts were being targeted under the plan.
   Another Pentagon source noted that such proposals are always
bound to produce complaints and that Cheney fully expects it.
   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg,'' the source said of the
reported closures. ``There's a whole lot more coming.''
   ``We've warned all along that reductions in the military budget
are going to be painful,'' added one military official.
   Bush, asked about the affect such closures might have during a
session with newspaper publishers, said the Defense Department was
``wrestling with this whole concept of what facilities will remain
as fully funded in the future as they have in the past.''
   The president admitted that the issue was a hot potato
politically _ and one he himself has been guilty of battling
against.
   ``We're all familiar with what happens _ everybody says cut and
then when somboedy has to make the call, they say, `Please, cut in
this other guy's district, don't cut in mine. Mine's absolutely
essential.'''
   ``And I was guilty of the same thing when I was a member of
Congress and so I understand it,'' Bush said. ``I think we can come
up with a formulation of where we have to cut, doing it in a way
that we don't cut into the muscle of our defense.''

<HEAD>Bush Calls Arrest of DC Mayor `Great Tragedy'</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-Drug Plan</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 3 grafs more Bennett comment</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday said that the
arrest of District of Colombia Mayor Marion Barry on a cocaine
charge was a ``great tragedy'' that made him think of the impact on
schoolchildren.
   The mayor was arrested by federal agents at a local hotel last
week and charged with one misdemeanor count of possession of crack
cocaine.
   Asked his reaction, Bush told newspaper publishers Thursday,
``Great sadness. Great tragedy ... My thought went to the kids, the
kids in the schools. It's a matter of sadness. Barbara shares my
view on that.''
   He declined to comment further, saying, it ``would be most
inappropriate for a president to prejudge a matter that is in the
court.''
   Asked whether the mayor should resign, he said, ``I don't want
to get into the case because I think it would be inappropriate.
Let's let the system work. I think the city is capable of making
that determination.''
   Later Bush's drug policy director, William Bennett, said the
Barry case might be ``one of these watershed kind of events'' that
changes people's attitudes on drugs.
   Bennett refused to comment directly about Barry but said his
government had been a barrier to a concentrated federal effort to
help the city deal with its drug problem.
   ``We threw a rope to a city drowning and we found a lot of knots
got tied, but there wasn't enough pulling to get up,'' Bennett said.
   ``Every American has to ... weep a little bit for this city and
for the fact that it's the murder capital of the country,'' Bennett
added.

<HEAD>Liberian Soldiers Leave Few Alive in Hunt for Rebels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE FAUL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberian soldiers accused of
massacring civilians are leaving few survivors in their relentless
search for rebels near the Ivory Coast border, diplomats and
medical workers said Thursday.
   ``They tell really horrendous stories of soldiers spraying
entire villages with .50-caliber machine guns,'' a Western diplomat
said. Bullets from such heavy weapons tear huge holes in bodies.
   The diplomat and Ivorian sources estimated at least 500
civilians had been killed in Liberia's eastern Nimba region since
soldiers were sent to stop rebel attacks that began Dec. 24.
   ``Refugees say there are not many wounded people because the
soldiers slaughtered so many,'' the diplomat said. He visited
refugees Tuesday with Ivorian officials, aid workers and other
diplomats from nations donating food, medicine and money.
   Officials fear an outbreak of disease because of a stream of
refugees estimated Thursday to number more than 60,000. About
12,000 to 15,000 other Liberians have sought refuge in Guinea, the
diplomat said.
   At the Ivorian border village of Danane, refugees tell of
dashing to safety in the forest when they hear the daily
machine-gun fire across the frontier.
   ``They are traumatized by the combat and watching some of their
relatives being killed,'' said Claude Regnier, a French adviser to
the Ivory Coast government who heads a committee coordinating aid
to the refugees.
   ``When the gunfire starts, they rush to the forest and come out
... only when it stops,'' he said in an interview.
   A Western diplomat said the killing began in Liberia after
rebels from the Gio tribe increased attacks in an attempt to oust
President Samuel Doe, who seized power in 1980 from the descendants
of freed American slaves who founded the West African nation in
1847. The Gio long have felt oppressed by Doe's Krahn tribe.
   ``It started with Gio rebels attacking military outposts in
their own ethnic heartland in Nimba county,'' the diplomat said,
also speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The army came in and
just went nuts because everyone looks like a rebel to them. There
has been some very heavy-handed slaughter.''
   The rebels retaliated about 10 days ago by moving south into
traditional Krahn territory and slaughtering civilians there, he
said. That caused a second wave of victims to flee east into Ivory
Coast and north into Guinea, he said.
   Killings of innocent people continue despite a warning from Doe
on Monday that soldiers who harmed civilians would be executed, the
diplomat said.
   Doe told reporters Thursday the army was having difficulty
containing the situation in Nimba because the rebels used
hit-and-run tactics, and that it was hard for his soldiers to
identify rebels wearing civilian clothes.
   He added, however, that security forces had been cautioned to
distinguish more carefully between civilians and rebels.
   Initially, Justice Minister Jenkins Scott said soldiers killed
only armed civilians who attacked them.
   Regnier said 40 percent of the refugees were women and children
and 30 percent boys or youths. Doctors said refugees hospitalized
in Ivory Coast included a 5-year-old girl shot in the leg.
   Dr. Maurice Kouame, director of Man Hospital, a regional health
center 75 miles from Danane, said his staff was caring for only
eight seriously wounded Liberians. He said people with light wounds
were treated at a clinic in Danane.
   Among the eight was a man whose arm had been hacked off, Kouame
said in a telephone interview.
   According to Regnier, refugees have crowded into a 30-mile
stretch along the Ivorian side of the border and have been taken in
by villagers of the same language and culture. He said many were
related.
   ``They are sleeping 40 to 50 in a hut,'' Regnier said.

   Q: Mr. President, on capital gains, you pointed out on several
occasions that because of parliamentary rules you've been thwarted,
you've asked that Congress give the majority the right to exercise
their will by passing capital gains.
   A: Yeah.
   Q: Now in this case, you technically won on this veto because of
parliamentary rules, but the vast majority voted against you on
this. Don't you believe that that is, in fact, a repudiation of
your Chinese policy?
   A: No, I don't see a parallel. This is Executive Branch. You're
equal with the Legislative Branch. The whole ball game is entitled
to have the veto process. Part of the election is about the veto
process. It's not a question of whether _ but when you have a
majority of senators up there doing one thing, that's fine,
provided the president agrees with it. But that's what I'm saying.
I mean _
   Q: But I'm talking specifically about what Congress did over the
last couple of days.
   A: Surprised you, didn't it?
   Q: The majority of congressmen in both the House and the Senate
voted against you on this issue. Do you that that's a repudiation
by Congress of your Chinese policy?
   A: No, they're entitled to do the thing and the Executive is
entitled to do its thing and it worked. And we're going to stay
right on track and I think the process worked very well. I don't
view it as a repudiation at all. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, I understand that Transportation Secretary
Skinner was among those making calls on the vote.
   A: I hope so.
   Q: Well, that's just a little pork barrel persuasion as well.
But was there something more than just the pure merits of this?
   A: Highways in China? What are you talking about? (Laughs.)
   Q: Well, I mean, was it just the pure merits of the case that

   A: I think there was some politics in it. I think there was
politics in it.
   Q: On both sides?
   A: Yeah, both sides. I'd say _ yeah, because some of them said,
``Look, let's stand with the President,'' some that may have had a
slight difference of emphasis on our side. And clearly there was
plenty on the other side when you don't see one single vote come

   Q: _ help on any other issue?

   Q: Mr. President, you've spoken of a trust factor _
   A: (Responding to an off-mike comment.) (Inaudible) _ a great
big, fat one coming over the pike. Excuse me.
   Q: On the trust factor, I wonder if I can apply that to the
American people, sir. What can you say to convince the people that
the missions to China weren't secret simply to avoid the
overwhelming public opposition to them?
   A: I say I think what I'm doing is correct, and I say I think I
was elected to do in foreign policy what I think was correct. And
you have the checks and balances of the Congress. They had a shot
to say that it wasn't correct in this instance. And so I say that I
feel encouraged that the process worked out this way, and I point
back to the original relationship with China. And I don't believe
you'd have ever had it if there hadn't been some secret diplomacy.
Yeah?

   Storms brought snow, thunder and high wind to the Great Lakes on
Thursday, rain fell along much of the East, and a new storm spread
rain and snow over the Northwest.
   In Alabama, a tornado touched down about 21 miles west-southwest
of Troy during the early morning, ripping through a mobile home
park and injuring at least 24 people.
   Wind blowing at 40 mph whipped up to 9 inches of snow across
southeastern Wisconsin, snarling traffic, closing schools and
airports at Milwaukee and elsewhere and forcing a small plane to
crash-land. The pilot of the plane that crash-landed walked away
without injury.
   Wisconsin Electric Co. reported more than 60 electrical wires
were downed by the wet, heavy snow, cutting power for about 10,000
customers in Milwaukee, Kenosha and Racine counties.
   The storm whipped up near blizzard conditions in Illinois north
of Chicago, the National Weather Service said. Up to 9 inches of
snow fell overnight while wind gusted to 60 mph. The cover of new
snow ranged from 6 to 10 inches from Moline to Chicago by noon.
   Northwestern Lower Michigan was covered with up to 8 inches of
new snow at noon.
   At midday, snow was falling across northern Lower Michigan,
Upper Michigan, Wisconsin, the northern two-thirds of Illinois,
central Indiana, and east-central Minnesota. Earlier, snow also
fell across parts of Iowa, with 3 inches at Burlington.
   Precipitation from that storm turned to showers and
thunderstorms from south-central Lower Michigan across western Ohio
into northeastern Kentucky.
   Thunderstorms caused scattered wind damage in Michigan, the
weather service said, with gusts to more than 50 mph at Ann Arbor.
   In the Northwest, winter storm warnings were posted over the
Washington Cascades and Olympics and the Oregon Cascades. Winter
storm watches were posted into Friday across west-central and
southwestern Idaho and a snow advisory was issued for northwestern
Wyoming.
   Snow was scattered over western Wyoming and the Idaho Panhandle.
Rain fell across much of Washington state and northwestern Oregon.
   Wind gusted during the morning to 55 mph at Bellingham, Wash.,
and to 58 mph at Livingston, Mont.
   In the East, rain was falling at noon from southern Maine across
northern Delaware, from New York state across western Virginia,
eastern West Virginia, western North Carolina, western South
Carolina and the northern half of Georgia.
   A flood watch was in effect into Friday morning over western
Vermont and eastern New York state.
   In Florida, Jacksonville reached a record high of 83 and Palm
Beach hit a record high of 84.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 10 degrees below zero
at Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 15 at
Warroad, Minn., to 85 in Florida at Barton, Lakeland and Fort Myers.

<HEAD>Spiritual Leader of Maine Shakers Dead at 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW GLOUCESTER, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sister R. Mildred Barker, the
spiritual leader of Maine's tiny Shaker community, died Thursday
after an extended illness. She was 92.
   Her death leaves just eight Shakers in the last active Maine
community of the Protestant faith, said Leonard Brooks, director of
the Shaker museum in Gloucester, where the group has its 1,900-acre
farm.
   A religous sect that flourished in the 19th century, Shakerism
practices celibacy and a communal life revolving around worship and
farming.
   Sister Mildred was put in charge in 1931 of the Shaker's jelly
and jam industry, as well as a candy-making business. She made
sales trips as far away as Boston and sold eggs in Portland, Maine,
the Shakers said in a statement.
   In 1950, she was chosen trustee of the community, overseeing
business and financial matters. The community raises sheep and
grows apples and herbs.
   Sister Mildred was born in Providence, R.I., on Feb. 3, 1897,
and at age 7 after her father died her mother placed her among the
Shakers, Brooks said.
   Brooks said former President Ronald Reagan recognized Sister
Mildred in 1983 for her expertise in singing old Shaker songs, many
of which were recorded on four albums.
   ``Sister Mildred's single greatest delight was singing the
beautiful old Shaker hymns that had been taught to her in her
youth,'' the statement said. ``She personally knew thousands of
songs and sought to preserve them.''

   Q: If I could ask the question again, sir, what _
   A: You might. You'll get the same answer if you ask the same
question.
   Q: Were the missions not kept secret to avoid the overwhelming
public opposition to them?
   A: No. The missions were kept secret because I believe this is
the best way in dealing with China to effect change, positive
change. Yes?
   Q: Mr. President, as you're aware, China issued an angry
statement overnight over the House action yesterday referring to
their vote as interference in China's affairs. You warned yesterday
about China's action if your veto was not sustained. What I don't
understand is why China would _ since you've promised to do the
same things administratively that the Pelosi bill would have done,
why _
   A: Yeah.
   Q: _ China would regard that as interference, but you doing it
they wouldn't.
   A: I think they would see it as a further public slap at a time
when they feel some steps have been taken that are positive. And I
think that is probably what _ but let there be no mistake about it,
they _ I'm sure they're not very happy with my executive order. I
mean, they're entitled to their view and we're entitled to ours.
And I have a mandate to protect these students, and China, as you
know, has a very different view on it. But I think that's the only
thing I can think of. Yeah?
   Q: May I ask on a different topic _ on the Middle East? You've
had three press conferences in two days now, and there's been no
questions at all about the Middle East. Is this a signal that your
administration and that the American public as a whole is disgusted
with the slow pace of events towards the peace process?
   A: No, because I don't write the questions for the press
conference. I mean, I can't help it if they had no questions. But,
I don't think there should _ anything in the status quo should be
interpreted as a lack of interest in trying to be helpful on the
talks going, if that's what you mean. In fact, there is discussion
going on. We had discussions with our most recent visitor,
President Salih. I've just concluded a meeting with Senator Specter
who is just back from Syria and from Iraq. And there's a lot going
on.
   I wish I could tell you I felt that there was demonstrable
progress. But, no, please don't assume because I've addressed
myself in the statements to the China question and the question of
Panama or the question of our domestic agenda that we have lost
interest in trying to be a catalyst in the Middle East.
   Q: Do you think one side is being more recalcitrant than the
other?
   A: I don't think it would be helpful to quantify recalcitrance.
I think what we ought to do is what Jim Baker is trying to do right
now and that is to facilitate the talks to get them started. Yeah.
   Q: Mr. President, with this victory in the Senate, do you
anticipate sending Gen. Scowcroft or perhaps some other envoy back
to China to talk again perhaps in the open this time?
   A: I'm not sure Scowcroft and Eagleburger want anymore grief
like this _ (laughs). There's no plans to do _ (laughs). You know,
there's no _ (laughing) _ let me be very clear, this again _ and
I'm not dodging the question _ one, there are no plans for anything
of that nature. Secondly, this was my idea, for good or for bad.
And these are seasoned diplomats and seasoned people in national
security, and we talk about these matters. And when the President
makes a decision, why they _ they do what I suggest here.
   And so, I don't want to be doing anything other than expressing
total confidence in them and in their mission. And I know it's been
controversial, but I'm not _ I'm not somebody that's always looking
for a way to do something in secret. When I see though, back to the
question I was asked, that in my judgment a quiet conversation
might lead to progress, I hope I will continue to feel I have the
flexibility to pursue such a conversation. Yeah _

get an answer to that.
   A: Yeah. Let me get you an answer, because we're not seeking to
do some clever parliamentary maneuver to have people have to vote
on this question, when I, you know, would rather have seen the
matter lie dormant. Yeah, in the middle?
   Q: You indicated in the beginning of your statement that you
feel you do have a mandate now on this China policy. A lot of
people have criticized it as a secret policy. You also indicated
that perhaps you might do more to keep Congress informed. Why not
keep them informed of these secret missions, and what do you plan
to do in terms of keeping them informed?
   A: Well, I think we do, we bend over backwards to keep people
informed in the Congress. And I think, once in a while, there is
something that is done quietly, and then, when it is proper, why,
we'll give a thorough and full briefing. And I think in this one,
when this matter was disclosed by us, we immediately briefed
Congress on what it was we were _ had intended to do, why we did
it. And so, I don't think there's any real lack of consultation. In
fact, I pride myself on the fact that we have had outstanding
consultation. And I've had these leaders down here over and over
again, bipartisan, and I'm going to continue to do that.
   Q: The July trip, Mr. President, it was six months before
Congress found out about it.
   A: That's right. That's right.
   Q: Why not inform the people _
   A: Because we were working on some initiatives, and in my
judgment it was better that it be quiet. And I've cited some
examples in history, particularly the China trip, opening to China,
that I think was best served by the way it was done. Yes?

   Authorities raised the death toll from
flooding this week to at least 24, with another 32 people missing
and thousands homeless, the official news agency TAP reported
Thursday.
   The torrential rains that struck the North African country on
Monday slackened Thursday as the United Nations and foreign
countries responded to a government appeal for food, tents, water
pumps and other emergency aid.
   Floodwaters receded in central and southern Tunisia, normally
arid regions that were hit hardest by the storm, and overland links
were reestablished with the communities of Sidi Bouzid, Gafsa,
Gabes, Tozeur and Kasserine, TAP reported.
   About 14,000 homes were destroyed in the flooding, TAP said, and
thousands of homeless people sought shelter in schools, mosques and
public buildings. The Health Ministry issued a statement saying
there appeared no risk of an epidemic.
   The news agency earlier reported a riot Wednesday by Islamic
fundamentalists in the central city of Sidi Bouzid, where 13 people
died, TAP said.
   About 800 sympathizers of the outlawed fundamentalist movement
An Nahda hurled rocks at government buildings and burned a parked
car as they paraded around the body of a person they said had died
in the floods, TAP reported.
   Police arrested 26 people in the demonstration.
   TAP said the protesters expressed their hostility toward the
Tunisian educational system ''without any relationship to the
situation brought on by the flooding.''

<HEAD>FDA Criticism Criticized</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration's warning
against an American Heart Association food-labeling plan was
criticized Thursday by a consumer group and at least one food
company wanting to display the plan's seal of approval on its
products.
   The association said it will begin ``Heartguide'' on Monday,
despite the FDA's warning that participating companies could face
enforcement action if their products are found to be mislabeled,
and will stick to its plan to extend the labels to more foods.
   The Heartguide program puts an association ``Heart Healthy''
seal on approved products.
   Two of the nine companies with Heartguide-approved products said
they will remain in the program, though their packaging with the
Heartguide seal won't go on sale until mid-Febrary or March. The
other companies either had not yet decided how to react to the
warning or did not return telephone calls.
   Bruce Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in
the Public Interest, an advocacy group that frequently seeks
tougher food and drug regulations, said that while he shares some
of the FDA's concerns about Heartguide, the agency's action is
``premature and unfortunate.''
   ``The federal government has defaulted on its obligation to
control misleading health claims by food manufacturers, and the
heart association's plan does represent an attempt to provide some
reliable health information to consumers,'' he said.
   He said the FDA has been trying for several years to adopt a
regulation restricting health claims that food manufacturers can
put on their labels.
   The agency has also been criticized for moving too slowly to
revise requirements for food labeling in general. The FDA held
hearings last fall on food labeling and plans to draft a proposal
by summer, a spokesman said.
   In a letter to the association Wednesday, the FDA expressed
concern that the Heartguide program will increase consumer
confusion and could lead to endorsement of some margarine and oil
products that ``do not represent the kinds of foods that ought to
be promoted to achieve healthy hearts.''
   Silverglade said he shares that concern and added that the
association ``may be giving out the seal a little to generously and
that their standards were not strict enough.''
   For the first phase of the program, more than 100 brands of
margarine, oil, crackers and vegetables have been tested and
approved. They include Mazola corn oil, Promise margarine, Pam
cooking sprays, Melba Toast and Hanover frozen vegetables.
   Companies pay a fee _ up to $640,000 depending on sales _ to
participate in the program.
   In the second phase, which initially was put on hold after the
FDA letter but put back on track Thursday, the seal will be offered
to other products, including cereals, cheese, cookies, pasta, salad
dressings and other foods.
   The FDA has no authority to stop the program, but it could take
companies to court if it finds their labels misrepresent their
products.
   One of the companies in the program said it intends to advertise
its seal of approval, despite the FDA warning.
   ``I don't think I'm afraid of it because I think there will be a
resolution to the problem,'' said Bob Maier, chairman of California
&amp; Washington Co., a San Francisco-based company that markets frozen
vegetables. ``I think both groups are trying to do best for the
consumer.''
   He noted that other third-party endorsements, including the Good
Housekeeping seal of approval and the American Dental Association,
are being used now to guide consumers in other markets.

<HEAD>Bush Budget Will Aim to Improve Government Statistics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The budget President Bush will propose Monday
will include about $50 million to improve government statistics
affecting most Americans, ranging from cost-of-living wage
increases to prices of stocks in which pension funds invest
heavily, the president's chief economic adviser said Thursday.
   Contending that the U.S. statistical system is among the finest
in the world, Chairman Michael J. Boskin of the Council of Economic
Advisers admitted it still has serious problems, especially in the
rapidly changing areas where accuracy is most needed.
   ``The economic statistics are important because of their large
impact on the economy,'' Boskin said at a news briefing on Bush's
initiative to improve economic statistics.
   ``Private orders and contracts, cost-of-living adjustments, the
federal budget and monetary policy are all based on the economic
information produced by the federal statistical system,'' he added.
   Boskin said various government agencies are expected to report
in about three months on how they plan to implement 25
recommendations already made by the presidential Economic Policy
Council's working group to improve the system.
   Boskin, who heads the group, said the most serious problem
facing the government's statistics-gathering operation is
estimating quality change in many important sectors.
   ``When we as a nation produced mostly things like steel and
wheat, output was easy to count _ tons of steel and bushels of
wheat,'' he said.
   ``Today a larger share of output is in sectors where better
performance means quality and improved convenience,'' he continued.
``Consider the impact of 24-hour automatic teller machines, and the
changes in desktop and laptop computers.''
   As an example of the need to examine measurement problems,
Boskin cited price indexes that should adjust for quality change.
   ``When the Commerce Department recently introduced a new
computer price index that only partially adjusted for quality
change, it raised real GNP (gross antional product) growth from 3.8
to 4.1 percent (a difference reaching $70 billion by 1988) and
lowered the rate in inflation (as measured by the GNP price
deflator) from 3.6 to 3.3 percent between 1982 and 1988,'' he said.
   Boskin also said the government's statistical system has not
kept up with changes in the economy, including airline
deregulation, which he said produced lower fares and widespread
discounting, causing passenger miles to increase by over 60 percent
in the 1980s.
   ``Yet the price index is still heavily based on full-fare
tickets, which now account for only 10 percent of tickets'' he
noted.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dynamite attack on the country's main
petroleum pipeline Thursday caused an oil spill covering nearly two
square miles and leaked thousands of barrels of crude into a
mountain stream, the state petroleum company Ecopetrol reported.
   An Ecopetrol communique did not say who was responsible for the
attack outside Teorama, but authorities believe it was almost
certainly perpetrated by leftist guerrillas belonging to the
National Liberation Army, known as the ELN.
   The ELN has claimed responsibility for 115 attacks against
Colombian petroleum facilities since 1986 in an effort to force the
government to nationalize the industry.
   The group called a halt to the attacks in the second half of
1989 but renewed them this year to protest a hike in the domestic
price of gasoline.
   The Ecopetrol communique said the blast near Teorama would have
serious ecological consequences because thousands of barrels of
spilled crude flowed into a pristine stream that feeds the
Catatumbo River.
   Teorama is 260 miles north of the capital Bogota.
   Thursday's attack was the third this year against the pipeline
running from the Cano Limon oil field on the border with Venezuela
to the Caribbean port of Covenas, near Cartegena.
   Ecopetrol said it was stopping the flow of crude through the
pipeline until a team could repair it.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ... done. Yes?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, as you analyze the outcome today and the vote
itself, how much of it was a vote on the Chinese student issue, and
how much of it do you perceive to be a vote on your overall
approach to China?
   A: I _ or on the political side, I don't know. I don't know how
you measure it, but I do think this: As I had an opportunity to
discuss it with individuals and as our team did, I think there was
much more understanding of the merits than had been granted
originally. And I think we'd all agree, everybody here, that a
couple of weeks ago, there was just _ it just was kind of written
off as _ and getting pounded on the merits as well as on the
politics.
   So the consultations and the discussions to try to get support
for this, I think, have increased understanding even by those that
didn't vote for me. At least I think they understand that there
were some merits to what I was trying to do. They may have
disagreed with it. Some may have agreed with what is the thrust of
some of these questions, on the secrecy question. Some may have
felt that legislation is better than the, you know, executive
branch authority doing it. But I think I was given the benefit of
the doubt by some in terms of knowledge of the importance of the
relationship with China.
   I think I hopefully dissuaded some in terms of some of the
propaganda on the other side that I didn't care about human rights.
So, it was an interesting development here, taking a project that
many had considered extraordinarily difficult and then seeing it
resolve itself in this way. But there is no _ you know, there is no
intention on my part to crow about it. I mean it was a very close
vote, and it worked out better than many had felt it would and now
we've got to go forward. Tomorrow it's something else. I am not
going to live there on this thing forever.
   Q: If I may follow? Was there not a broader issue in regard to
China policy here than just the situation with the students?
   A: What? I don't want to _ I am not sure I _
   Q: Was this not a congressional mandate or a Senate mandate on
the way you handled the overall China policy, more than just the
student issue?
   A: Well, some of it was. Some of it was political, some of it
was _ we'd already accomplished by executive order what the Pelosi
Bill was going to do, so some of it was a feeling that maybe it'd
be better to lock it in on legislation. Some of it was they wanted
to make a statement. There's a lot of _ you have to just ask those
who voted as they did. Yeah?
   Q: Mr. President, a lot of the emotion over your China policy
had to do with the famous Scowcroft toast on videotape. It angered
a lot of people to see him toasting people responsible for the
Tiananmen Square massacre. Would you say that at least that part of
it was a mistake, that it _
   A: No, because when you go to China, that is _ I don't know of
anybody that's been there that doesn't engage in that activity. And
if you read the full context of what was said, I think it was a
very unfair shot. But I agree with you, some people used that as
something that was outrageous, but they ought to go over to China
and just understand how it works and _
   Q: If it had not been televised, do you think the public
reaction _ if people had only known that he went over there and
that he had had talks, do you think the public reaction would have
been different than it was when they saw him toasting on television?
   A: No, I think the people that are outraged by it and expressed
themselves were concerned about my whole approach to it. I think,
but I can't say that that _ I think that it may have affected one
or two, I don't really know the answer to that one. Michael, did I
answer or did you get the question? (Inaudible cross-talk.)
   A: Okay. No, I _

<HEAD>Bush Calls Gorbachev America's `Best Hope' in Soviet Union</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Updates throughout to reflect second news conference</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush praised Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
Thursday as the ``best hope'' for the United States in the Soviet
Union and declined to fault him for using force to restore order in
the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan.
   The president also hailed a Senate victory on his China policy,
calling it a ``good signal for the political fights'' ahead.
   Bush gave a new strong endorsement to the embattled Soviet
president, telling a luncheon audience of 75 newspaper executives:
``I think we have a lot at stake in continuing to deal with this
man.''
   ``I want very much for him to succeed,'' Bush said. ``And I
don't think anyone is faulting him for the difficulties that he has
encountered in Azerbaijan.''
   The president used the luncheon to unveil his latest anti-drug
strategy, but he also fielded questions on a range of other
subjects. Then, after the Senate vote upholding his veto of a bill
to prohibit the deportation of Chinese students, Bush bounded to
the White House briefing room to applaud the vote.
   ``Surprised you, didn't it?'' he said of the Senate outcome.
   He called the vote ``a good signal for the political fights that
may lie ahead.''
   Asked whether the victory with which he had started the year
would transfer to other issues, Bush said:
   ``I'm not in a mode of talking about momentum or something of
that nature. I do think, because of the way it worked out, it's
going to be helpful in reaching accommodation in the Senate and in
the House on certain of our objectives.''
   ``I don't come in here with any sense of gloating,'' he said.
   ``Excuse me if the adrenalin flew,'' he said as he conducted the
day's second half-hour news conference, at which he also announced
a $1 billion aid package for Panama.
   Bush was asked at the session with newspaper executives about
Gorbachev's use of military force in an effort to put down the
separatist rebellion in Azerbaijan. ``You see blockades of your
ports, and the man has to respond,'' Bush said.
   ``I'm not encouraging that course, because we would like to see
peaceful change wherever possible.'' Overall, he said, Gorbachev
has done ``a remarkable job.''
   Asked about contentions of some analysts that Gorbachev's
political position was precarious, Bush said he ``wouldn't
speculate on the totality of survival.''
   ``It's not for some president of the United States to start
saying who he thinks ought to be in that job,'' Bush continued.
``But, as I look around, I think Mr. Gorbachev is really the best
hope for what our interests are.''
   ``We want to see peaceful change continue, we want to see
democratization of Eastern Europe, we want to see openness, bring
about market-force economies inside the Soviet Union. And all of
these things are in our interest.''
   On other subjects, Bush said at either the session with
newspaper executives or the later news conference in the briefing
room:
   _ He did not wish to point a finger at any party for the
apparent impasse in Middle East peace talks and promised that the
United States would ``continue to be a catalyst'' in trying to
bring Israel, the Palestinians and Egypt to the bargaining table.
   _ There have been ``some very ugly incidents'' among recent
bombings and racial violence but, ``I'd like to think there is not
a rising tide.''
   _ He will tell Americans in his State of the Union address next
Wednesday that he has a ``feeling that the country is going to be
in pretty good shape.''
   _ ``A strong and vigorous economy'' is the best answer for
helping communities affected by military base closings to recover.
He plans to send a list of proposed base closings to Congress on
Monday when he submits his fiscal 1991 budget. Bush said that in
the past, private business had often moved in and provided jobs in
areas that lost government installations.
   _ His position ``has not changed on gun control. ... I think the
thing is to enforce the laws on the books.''
   _ ``While the matter is in the courts'' he would not comment on
whether he would consider pardons for former Reagan White House
aides Oliver North or John Poindexter. North is appealing his
convictions and Poindexter is awaiting trial.
   _ He hopes to be able to do more in the coming months to combat
the problem of homelessness, saying that ``when you go upstairs and
look out that window you see some pretty heart-rending sights.'' He
was referring to homeless people who sleep on heating grates within
sight of the White House.

   Q: Back to Panama, sir. The election last May is the one that
never really resulted in a full count, because of General Noriega.
Yet that's the same election on which the Endara government is
basing its legitimacy. Is it time, sir, for another election in
Panama?
   A: Well, I think that, fortunately, the Endara has been endorsed
by the electoral commission. They kind of were a little diverted
from their normal course of business by Mr. Noriega a while back,
but I think that's a matter for the Panamanians to decide. I think
it would be a little bit outrageous for us to come charging in and
tell them when they ought to have an election. Way in the back?
   Q: But what is your opinion?
   A: You're not way in the back. You're in the middle. Huh?
   Q: What is your opinion on this?
   A: Well, I'm not going to have an opinion. I want this to be the
Panamanian system. The emphasis from now on ought to be Panama's
democracy, Panama determination. Let Panama figure out and then
we'll try to help, or if they ask for criticism or suggestions,
fine. But I don't want to be appearing that we are trying to _ to
run the new democracy in Panama from up here. That would the worst
thing we could do. Way in the middle and in the back.
   Q: On another topic, several key Democratic senators say they no
longer _ they don't believe that President Cristiani has control of
the military any longer. What is your response to that? They are
also drafting legislation which would kill future military aid. Do
you think you will be as successful in defeating that passage as
you were today?
   A: I hope so because Cristiani is trying hard and I think that
there is some evidence that he doesn't control all his military.
The very fact he is trying to bring some to justice who at least
have been accused of wrongdoing demonstrates that. But the man was
elected, certifiably free elections. He is trying very hard. He has
taken some extraordinarily courageous and tough steps and he has my
full support. Jessica and then Ellen _ these three in this triangle
here and then I'm going. Jessica, you lead off.
   Q: My question is about Mexico and Venezuela and other countries
in South America that have been offended by the invasion in Panama.
   A: Yes.
   Q: I wonder if _ could you have spoken with their leaders and
used some of your personal diplomacy to convince them that you
didn't intend any offense and won't be invading any other countries
any time soon. (Laughter.)

   The revised national drug control strategy
unveiled Thursday by President Bush carries a price tag of $10.6
billion for 1991, up $1.1 billion from the current $9.5 billion in
spending. Here, at a glance, are the main features of the proposal,
most of which needs congressional approval.
   _Of the total spending, 42 percent would be for domestic law
enforcement, 29 percent for drug interdiction at the borders and
international operations and 29 percent for demand reduction,
including prevention and treatment.
   _Treatment funds would increase by 12 percent to $1.5 billion;
anti-drug education and community and workplace programs to prevent
drug abuse would get $1.2 billion, an 11 percent increase. Research
would increase by 20 percent to $383 million,
   _Criminal justice funds would increase by 2 percent to $4.3
billion; interdiction efforts would increase by 17 percent to $2.4
billion; international initiatives would rise by 65 percent to $690
million, and intelligence budgets would go up by 142 percent to
$172 million.
   _The strategy calls for expanding the circumstances under which
drug kingpins could face the death penalty, including cases in
which they or their organizations have not killed anyone, when they
try to kill in order to obstruct justice, or when their offenses
result in death, such as a drug user's overdose.
   _About $2.6 billion of the total budget would be distributed to
state and local governments in the form of block grants for law
enforcement, drug treatment and anti-drug education programs.
   _Five areas are designated as high-intensity drug-trafficking
areas _ New York, Los Angeles, Miami, Houston and the Southwest
border of California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Although the
budget specifically mentions spending $25 million extra for those
areas this year and $50 million next year, officials said total
federal anti-drug spending in the five regions would be $1.2
billion this year and $1.4 billion next year.
   _The Andean strategy of buttressing the drug-fighting efforts of
the main cocaine-producing countries of Colombia, Peru and Bolivia
with $2.2 billion in drug law enforcement and economic development
aid over five years continues, increasing from $217 million in 1990
to $423 million in 1991, including $50 million in additional aid
for Colombia.
   _Pregnant women who use drugs and their drug-addicted babies
would be targeted with $400 million in prevention and treatment
funds.
   _New attention is focused on eradicating domestic marijuana
fields, with a virtual doubling of federal funds, to $35 million.
   _The Pentagon takes a much more significant role in the drug war
with a budget of $1.2 billion, up from $878 million this year, with
$638 million to be used for detection and monitoring of drug
traffickers crossing the U.S. borders.

   President Bush on Thursday announced he will
offer an aid package of more than $1 billion to help Panama recover
from the U.S. military invasion and achieve ``as close to instant
relief as we can expect.''
   ``The economic challenges that Panama faces are great, but we
will work with the people to build a prosperous, democratic
nation,'' Bush told a news conference.
   His package, much of which needs congressional approval,
includes:
   _$42 million in humanitarian assistance for housing, emergency
public works, small business rehabilitation for looting victims and
technical assistance to the government.
   _$400 million in Export Import Bank guarantees to finance sales
of American products to Panama.
   _$15 million in Agency for International Development lending to
private sector borrowers.
   _$50 million in Overseas Private Investment Corporation programs
to support U.S. private investment in Panama.
   _$30 million in Agriculture Department programs.
   _$28 million to restore Panama's suspended sugar quota for 1989
and 1990.
   Another $500 million would go to balance of payment support,
public investment, economic restructuring and development needed in
the wake of the invasion and two years of economic starvation due
to U.S. economic sanctions against the regime of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   That sum will include $150 million toward helping Panama pay its
foreign debt of more than $500 million, officials said.
   That $500 million needs congressional approval as a supplemental
appropriation, while the other monies will come from reprogramming
of existing funds, they said.
   Bush said foreign aid would have to be cut from other countries,
but did not specify which ones. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger told reporters Bush had not made that decision yet.
   The package will go toward repairing damages estimated at up to
$2 billion stemming from the Dec. 20 invasion.
   ``These programs will give as close to instant relief as we can
expect here,'' Bush told reporters in a hastily called news
conference where he also claimed victory in the Senate vote
upholding his veto of Chinese-students legislation.
   Bush said he called the U.S.-installed president of Panama,
Guillermo Endara, on Thursday morning ``to assure him of our
continued support of his efforts to establish democracy in Panama.''
   ``Part of this effort involves the establishment of a healthy
economy,'' he said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, who visits Panama this weekend, will
review details of the plan with Endara, Bush said.
   ``We're going to work closely with the Congress on this package
to ensure its prompt implementation,'' Bush said.
   He predicted a short-run ``vastly improved economic situation.''
   Bush also said he told Endara that if he has further needs for
aid, ``please let me know'' but that Endara seemed pleased with the
$1 billion package. Bush added, ``I wouldn't say this is the end of
the road in terms of what we can do to help them.''
   But Endara said in Panama that the proposed $1 billion package
was about half what his government had requested.
   Endara said in a statement that the aid would help create jobs
and revitalize the international banking system, which was once the
backbone of Panama's economy. But he also said the government would
require a ``substantial reduction of its payroll.''
   Bush also did not offer any compensation for the families of 202
civilians killed in the fighting, which the Panamanians have
insisted upon.
   In the Senate, leading members of the Foreign Relations
Committee, including Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and
Republican Richard Lugar of Indiana, indicated they generally
backed aid to Panama. ``I applaud that effort,'' said Pell.
   Several liberal Democrats, however, were more cautious and
expressed concern that Noriega associates would benefit. ``My
concern is that we are changing the name, changing the uniform, but
they are still the same people,'' said Sen. Christopher dodd,
D-Conn.
   The administration will encourage other nations to also help
Panama clear its debt and seek ``an early and generous rescheduling
of Panama's debt to foreign governments'' under the auspices of the
so-called Paris club of major lender nations.
   The United States already has released $400 illion in Panamanian
assets frozen in the United States in earlier efforts to topple the
Noriega regime.
   The program, if approved, would make Panama one of the largest
per capita aid recipients in the world.
   Panama, which has 2.2 million residents, is behind on its
foreign loan repayments, owing $534 million.
   Bush also said that it should be up to the Panamanian people to
decide whether to have a new election instead of accepting Endara,
a candidate in last year's election who was installed when Noriega
fled in the face of the U.S. invasion.
   ``I don't want to be appearing that we are trying to run the new
democracy in Panama from up here. That would be the worst thing we
could do,'' Bush said.
   Asked whether other Latin governments, upset about the Panama
operation, should be worried about future invasions, he quipped:
   ``I haven't given them my invasion list.''
   But he said that he believes the Latin nations, upset over the
invasion, now understand the U.S. position. Especially given the
U.S. history in the region, Bush said, ``Anytime you undertake an
engagement like I authorized, you've got to assess what the
downside is because there is a history.''

   A modified jumbo jet
carried space shuttle Columbia and a rescued satellite out of
California on Thursday for a two-day piggyback flight to Florida's
Kennedy Space Center, NASA said.
   The Boeing 747 shuttle carrier aircraft, with Columbia mounted
on top, took off about 7:30 a.m. PST.
   ``It was a pretty sight,'' said Don Haley, a spokesman for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ``The sun was just
up and it was glistening in the air.''
   The plane landed for a refueling stop at Davis-Monthan Air Force
Base near Tucson, Ariz., about 1{ hours later and at Kelly Air
Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, about 3:10 p.m. for an overnight
stop.
   If weather permits, the plane will refuel again Friday at Eglin
Air Force Base in Florida before returning to the space center at
Cape Canaveral.
   One extra refueling stop was added to each day of the trip from
California to Florida because of extra weight added by the
satellite the shuttle is transporting, NASA spokeswoman Pat
Phillips said in San Antonio.
   During the San Antonio stop, cool air will be blown on the
shuttle to keep the cargo within specified temperature ranges, she
said.
   Columbia, the oldest shuttle, landed at this Mojave Desert
military base at 1:35 a.m. PST Saturday after a record 10-day,
21-hour mission.
   The shuttle's five-member crew deployed a Navy communications
satellite then retrieved the 11-ton, 30-foot-long Long Duration
Exposure Facility, a science satellite that soon would have burned
up in Earth's atmosphere if it had not been plucked from its
decaying orbit.
   The LDEF will be removed from Columbia's cargo bay after arrival
at Kennedy Space Center. NASA will begin work immediately to
prepare Columbia for its next launch, scheduled May 3.
   The next shuttle mission is scheduled to start Feb. 22, when
Atlantis is to be launched on a classified Defense Department
mission. Atlantis was moved to its Cape Canaveral launch pad
Thursday.
   Sources close to the project report the secret payload to be
deployed by Atlantis' all-military crew of five is a spy satellite
capable of snapping super-sharp reconnaissance photos and
eavesdropping on military communications.
   Discovery will be launched no earlier than April 19 to place the
powerful Hubble Space Telescope in orbit.
   During its next mission in May, Columbia is scheduled to deploy
Astro-1, which is an orbiting ultraviolet telescope, and the Broad
Band X-ray Telescope.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: ... soon. (Laughter.)</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A: Well, I haven't given them my invasion list _ (laughter) _
but I have _ I have _ no, but seriously, it's a very important
question diplomatically. It's a good question and I _ I _ first
place, as of today, because of what's happened since the fighting
began, things are better. Some of it may be just that time heals.
   Secondly, I think that they have been informed, some by me _
mail, phone calls when these actions took place, and by many other
_ our State Department and our representatives as to what our
intention was, what the cause was, what we're doing. They've seen a
lot of forces come out now, which I think is helpful. There is a
history. And any time you undertake an engagement like I
authorized, you've got to assess what the downside is because of
the history.
   But, Jessica, I am _ I am pleased with where we are now and I
have not engaged in the last week or so in a lot of diplomatic
activity with my friends, but I've sent enough communications that
I think they know what my heartbeat is on this and I think they _ I
hope now when they saw what happened with the Panamanian people
that they made profound impression on them. And they've seen Endara
go forward, and they've seen the stamp of approval given to that _
his democracy. And they see that now, as of today, that we're
determined to help, not just with rhetoric but with the means of
recovery.
   So things are better and, I think, in _ given the action that I
authorized _ in pretty good shape. I'm not suggesting I have no
diplomacy ahead. Yeah?
   Q: Yes, Mr. President, a surprise victory to start the year.
Will this transfer to other issues? And is this what someone once
called the ``big mo'' _ momentum starting off 1990? (Laughter.)
   A: Hey, listen, I learned a lesson, not to talk about that, and
I learned it the hard way; took it right on the chin. And I'm
coming in here in a spirit of cooperation. And excuse me if the
adrenalin flew in one or two of the questions because, you know,
things didn't look too bright just a little while back.
   But, no, there's no point in _ this is too serious a business,
especially as it relates to this China policy. And _ so I'm not in
a mode of talking about momentum or something of that nature. I do
think because of the way it worked out it's going to be helpful in
reaching accommodation in the Senate and in the House on certain of
our objectives. And by that I mean, I'm _ offer out that hand of
cooperation.
   But it is a two-way street. I simply cannot accept legislation
that is _ that is opposed to principles I believe in. So, I don't
know where it will fall out, but there isn't _ I promise you, I
don't come in here with some sense of gloating or anything of that
nature at all. It was too tough a vote for a lot of my friends on
both sides of the aisle. Yeah, Ellen, last one.
   Q: Mr. President, in announcing $1 billion for Panama, that's an
awful lot of money. So who _ what countries are going to get less
money as a result of our generosity to Panama?
   A: Well, there will be offsets and we will, at the appropriate
time, which is fairly soon, tell the Congress where we think those
offsets should come from. But let me reiterate my _ my
philosophical approval for the Bob Dole position, which is to give
the President more flexibility on this concept of earmark. I've _
I've _ I've _ I've boycotted the back benches, so we're going to
end with this one right here.
   Q: Mr. President, do you agree with the NAACP, and other
organizations, that there is a rising tide of racism in this
country?
   A: I had a long talk with some of the executives of the NAACP
the other day and they expressed to me their concerns, and I share
their concerns. But whether it _ I like to think that there isn't a
rising tide, I think that there are some very ugly incidents, and
if I can use this platform, the White House, to speak out against
that bigotry and against that ugliness, perhaps it will help. I
don't _ but I will tell you that several of those leaders felt that
there was a growing pattern of racism and, as you _ you know, your
question said ``a rising tide.'' I don't know that I agree with it,
but I do agree there are some very ugly incidents lately, and we
all ought to do what we can to make clear that is not the American
way.
   Thank you. I really do have to go. Thank you all. You guys have
been stiffed, but I'll get you next time, I promise.

<TEXT>
   The American Federation of Teachers said
Thursday it will help educators in Eastern European countries and
others emerging from dictatorship teach the principles and
practices of democracy and the operation of teachers' unions.
   The project, named ``Education for Democracy-International,''
will begin immediately in Poland where a delegation will hold a
seminar Sunday for Teachers Solidarity to give advice on collective
bargaining and negotiating.
   Albert Shanker, president of the union, said that the Polish
efforts will be a pilot program that can be repeated in other
countries. Requests already have arrived from union leaders and
educators in Hungary, Chile, South Africa and Czechoslovakia, he
said.
   ``People in Romania, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, East Germany,
Hungary, Poland and elsewhere are not only trying to recover from
years of political and economic repression but they also are trying
to build democratic states.'' Shanker said. ``We owe it to them to
do whatever we can to help.''
   Diane Ravitch, a professor at Teachers College of Columbia
University in New York City, said the two one-week sessions will
try to give more than 50 leading teachers and union leaders the
opportunity to decide for themselves what democratic structures
will best serve their members.
   ``We don't come pushing ourselves or anything that we do,''
explained Ms. Ravitch. ``We will deal with questions like `How to
run a trade union meeting. How to bring a question to a vote.' It's
not a matter of delivering answers but to share the problems too.''
   To help American teachers instruct students about the liberation
of Eastern Europe from dictatorship and about democratic principles
in general, the AFT's U.S. Education for Democracy Project will
provide materials to American teachers.
   The first information kit will deal with Czechoslovakia and will
be available in February.
   The two projects also will sponsor ``classroom-to-classroom''
programs linking U.S. schools with counterparts in Hungary and
Poland, Shanker said.

<HEAD>Ag Scientist: Corn Probably Escaped Contamination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department scientist said
Thursday the 1989 corn crop probably escaped high levels of
contamination by aflatoxin, a natural cancer-causing chemical that
plagued growers in 1988.
   Microbiologist Donald T. Wicklow of the department's
Agricultural Research Service said the weather conditions necessary
for unusually high aflatoxin levels generally were not present on a
national scale last year. He said none has been reported since last
fall's harvest.
   Wicklow works for the agency's northern regional research center
in Peoria, Ill. His comments were released here by the agency.
   Aflatoxin is a poisonous chemical produced by two soil fungi,
Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. Wicklow said A. flavus has
been found most commonly in peanuts and corn, especially in hot,
dry weather as in 1988.
   Corn will not necessarily be contaminated simply because it was
grown in a field that previously produced aflatoxin-tainted corn,
Wicklow said. Neither will it pick up aflatoxin from being stored
in bins that previously held tainted corn.

<HEAD>5 Accused in Illegal Nuclear Exports to Pakistan, India, SAfrica</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HANAU, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five West Germans have been accused
of exporting components to Pakistan that could be used to make
nuclear weapons and of shipping reactor material to South Africa
and India, officials said Thursday.
   The case is the worst export scandal to hit West Germany since
accusations last year that West German companies helped build an
alleged chemical weapons plant outside Tripoli, Libya.
   The five suspects are accused of violating West Germany's laws
for the control of war weapons and its export regulations, said a
statement by the prosecutor's office in Hanau, near Frankfurt.
   According to the statement, the suspects are Rudolf Ortmayer,
former head of the Neue Technologie GmbH company of Gelnhausen; a
former business partner, physicist Peter Finke; chemist Heinrich
Weichselgartner; and two unidentified businessmen.
   From 1981-88, Ortmayer and Finke allegedly sent Pakistan
equipment and components for producing nuclear fuel rods without
obtaining the necessary permit, the statement said.
   The prosecutors also said the two unidentified men and
Weichselgartner are suspected of illegally shipping tritium gas to
Pakistan in 1985-86, as well as shipments of equipment for
collecting and purifying the gas.
   Tritium can be used in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
   Ortmayer was additionally accused of exporting to India material
for two atomic reactors, and a test device for measuring fuel rods
to South Africa, in both cases without the necessary permits, said
the statement.
   Both Ortmayer and Finke were additionally charged with failing
to pay about 5 million marks ($2.9 million) in taxes, the statement
said.
   The statement said arrest warrants for the suspects were
``carried out'' but it did not say if all five were in custody.
   The investigation was launched in November 1987, and the case
has been the subject of special parliamentary hearings.
   The suspects could face up to 18 years in prison if convicted.
   The case follows last year's scandal triggered by U.S.
accusations that West German firms helped build an alleged poison
gas plant in Libya. The West German government at first rejected
the reports, but later German prosecutors launched an investigation
that is continuing.
   West Germany, embarrassed by the Libya scandal, toughened up its
export laws last year and vowed to crack down on violators.

   Raising unemployment taxes now would prevent
painful increases during a possible recession, sponsors said
Thursday as they introduced legislation to raise an extra $2.6
billion a year from those taxes by 1993.
   The plan by three House Democrats comes at a time when many
members of Congress are discussing a cut in the Social Security
payroll tax, which would provide millions of workers with a tax cut.
   One of the sponsors, Rep. Tom Downey of New York, chairman of
the Ways and Means subcommittee on human resources, said the two
issues should not be linked because Social Security funds are
``flushed at the current time'' and unemployment accounts are not.
He said workers have historically supported unemployment programs
because they stand to benefit from them.
   The AFL-CIO supports the plan, said a spokeswoman.
   Downey, noting President Bush's no-new-taxes campaign pledge,
defended the measure as merely an expansion of an old tax that has
not kept pace with increases in the amount of benefits paid to
unemployed Americans.
   The White House has not reviewed the legislation or taken a
stand, said spokesman Stephen Hart.
   The measure would make other changes in unemployment
compensation law such as allowing ex-military personnel to receive
benefits for 26 weeks, just like civilians out of work, instead of
the 13 weeks now permitted.
   Downey said there is now an $11 billion shortfall in federal
unemployment compensation accounts, including the fund used for
making loans to states so they can make payments.
   Without some change, nearly half the states would run out of
funds to pay benefits if another recession hits, he predicted.
   ``We can pay additional unemployment taxes now during good
economic times, or we can pay more unemployment taxes later when we
have another recession,'' Downey said.
   Under current law, the federal government taxes employers 0.8
percent on the first $7,000 paid to each employee. Businesses also
pay state unemployment taxes on top of that.
   Though businesses write checks to the government, many
economists believe workers shoulder the actual burden through
smaller wage increases.
   Downey's measure would increase the federal wage ceiling to
$10,000 by $1,000 a year for the next three years.
   The current 0.8 percent tax rate includes a 0.2 percent surtax
that is set to expire at the end of 1990. Downey's measure would
allow the surtax to expire.
   States must set their taxable wage base at least as high as the
federal ceiling. An increase in the federal ceiling to $10,000
would cause $3,000 increases in 17 states and smaller increases in
another 18 states.
   The other sponsors are Reps. Sander Levin of Michigan and Don
Pease of Ohio.

   The Medellin cocaine cartel freed the
fifth captive Thursday since announcing defeat by the government
last week, and said the man was its last kidnapping victim.
   Juan Camilo Pelaez, a wealthy merchant, was found chained to a
window grating of a house in residential section of Medellin, two
radio networks reported. He was abducted Jan. 10 in Medellin, hub
of Colombia's cocaine trade.
   ``Mr. Pelaez is the last of our hostages,'' said a statement
from the cartel, which declared a week ago that the government
anti-drug campaign had won and it would end a terror blitz of
bombings, kidnap and murder.
   Caracol radio said the traffickers gave Pelaez the document and
told him to carry it to the press.
   Authorities said 15 people abducted in the last two months
remained in the hands of the traffickers. The cartel denied it held
other hostages in Antioquia state, which includes Medellin, but
said it knew who did.
   ``Next week, we will publicly denounce the gang that has the
rest of the kidnapping victims in its power in our state,'' the
statement said. It accused police of abducting and massacring 12
people, including 10 hired assassins, last week in Gomez Plata, a
town 55 miles north of Medellin.
   Last Sunday, authorities announced the discovery of 12
bullet-riddled bodies at a tourist ranch near Gomez Plata.
   Antioquia state police identified the victims as two managers of
the ranch and 10 Medellin youths who may have belonged to a gang of
hired killers. The police said they were investigating the motive.
   The Medellin cartel leaders said in the statement they would
provide evidence and testimony to prove members of the Bogota
police force were responsible if the government gave guarantees in
return. They did not specify the guarantees.
   Thursday's message carried the slogan of the Extraditables, a
name the Medellin traffickers adopted when they became subject to
extradition to the United States. The slogan is: ``We prefer a tomb
in Colombia to a jail cell in the United States.''
   Since President Virgilio Barco's government declared war on the
traffickers in mid-August following the slaying of a popular
presidential candidate, bombings and other attacks attributed to
them have taken 209 lives.
   The cartel said in its capitulation last week it would free all
hostages, and also would abandon the cocaine trade in return for
``constitutional and legal guarantees,'' which officials
interpreted to mean an end to extradition.
   Barco said he would wait until the traffickers fulfilled their
promises before responding to their requests.
   His government has extradited 13 Colombians wanted on drug
charges in the United States.

   President Bush announced Thursday that he will
nominate former New York state legislator John R. Dunne to the top
civil rights job in the Justice Department, a post that has been
vacant for more than a year.
   Bush's first choice for the job, William Lucas, failed to win
Senate confirmation last year.
   The job has been vacant since December 1988, when William
Bradford Reynolds stepped down as assistant attorney general for
civil rights. Reynolds provoked controversy by opposing
affirmative-action programs that involved racial preferences.
   Dunne, who will turn 60 on Sunday, has a sparse background on
civil rights. A former chairman of the New York State Senate
Judiciary Committee, he is a graduate of Georgetown University and
Yale Law School.
   Colleen O'Connor, a spokeswoman for the American Civil Liberties
Union, said the New York chapter had for years studied Dunne's
record on civil rights and found it lacking.
   ``I think it's fair to say these questions are going to come
up'' when Dunne is examined by the Senate Judiciary Committee, she
said. ``Because he has not built a solid record that I think will
please the civil rights community.''
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, said he did not know enough
about Dunne to have formed an opinion.
   ``We wait to see what this man's record is and we will be
looking at it,'' Hooks said.
   After initial reports in November that Dunne was in line for the
civil rights post, he resigned from the all-male Garden City Golf
Club, which he had belonged to for 32 years. His hometown is Garden
City, N.Y.
   During most of his 24 years as a state legislator, a part-time
post, Dunne lived in Albany at the Fort Orange Club, which until
1988 barred women.
   The White House announced the Dunne nomination shortly after
Bush finished a news conference at which he was asked whether he
agrees with NAACP leaders that there is ``a rising tide of racism''
in the country.
   Bush said he does not view it as ``a rising tide,'' but said,
``There are some very ugly incidents.'' Bush said he shares the
concerns of the civil rights leaders about the recent wave of
racial bombings and threats in the South.
   The Lucas nomination was scuttled by intensive lobbying by civil
rights groups troubled by Lucas's lack of legal experience and his
views that Supreme Court rulings had not eroded civil rights
protections under the law. The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected
his nomination Aug. 1.
   Lucas, a onetime Michigan sheriff and Wayne County executive, is
now a public liaison official at the Justice Department, a post
that did not require confirmation.
   Dunne, in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday,
said he had reviewed videotapes of the Judiciary Committee's
grilling of Lucas to prepare for his own hearings.
   ``I looked at that video again over the weekend and it was a
very tough spot they put him in,'' said Dunne.
   ``It's an altogether different ballgame in Washington. Gosh,
they play for keeps,'' said Dunne.
   He acknowledged, ``I haven't had as much experience as I'm sure
many civil rights activists perhaps would like to see.''
   But Dunne said he has been sufficiently involved in civil rights
to have ``an understanding and a sensitivity and caring'' about the
issue.
   Dunne has the backing of Democratic Rep. Charles Rangel, an old
friend and the most powerful black member of New York's
congressional delegation. Dunne is white.
   ``If the president has to pick a Republican, he couldn't pick a
more decent person than John Dunne,'' Rangel said in a recent
interview.
   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, in a Jan. 2 letter to Bush, called
Dunne ``an honorable and conscientious public servant, an able
lawyer dedicated to the rule of law, a committed family man and a
very decent person.'' Cuomo is also a Democrat.
   Dunne resigned his legislative seat last September after losing
a contest for majority leader in the Republican-controlled state
Senate. He is a partner in a Uniondale, N.Y., law firm.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, a longtime friend of Dunne's,
noted that Dunne was called to Attica State Prison in 1971 by
rioting prisoners to help negotiate the end of a stalemate with
state authorities.
   Dunne ``has devoted most of his professional life as a public
servant dedicated to matters relating to the administration of
justice, including the rights of institutionalized persons and
increased access by the public to legal services,'' Thornburgh said.

   Barbara Bush, saying she wants to keep the
White House as ``the first house in the land,'' launched a drive
Thursday to raise a $25 million endowment fund for the upkeep and
improvement of its famed public rooms.
   Ms. Bush, announcing the membership of the new White House
Endowment Fund, called it ``truly a celebration ... for this
splendid house.''
   ``Throughout our history the White House has always held a
special place in the hearts of Americans, even those 19th century
miscreants who cut little pieces of the curtains as souvenirs,''
Mrs. Bush said.
   The aim is to create an endowment to ensure ``the best care and
upkeep of all of its splendid public rooms,'' Mrs. Bush said.
   The fund-raising effort will be spearheaded by Dorothy M. Craig
of Midland, Texas, a friend from the Bushes' days in the oil
business.
   The White House Endowment Fund will be a subsidiary of the White
House Historical Association that Jacqueline Kennedy helped create
back in the 1960s to produce a guide book and educational materials
about the mansion where every president except George Washington
has lived.
   The Historical Association includes such prominent Washington
figures as lawyer Clark Clifford and J. Carter Brown, director of
the National Gallery of Art. They were among three dozen people who
joined Mrs. Bush in the State Dining Room to announce the
fund-raising drive.
   ``As Clark Clifford told me, Jackie Kennedy said the White House
should be the first house in the land, and that's what we're hoping
to keep it,'' Mrs. Bush told reporters.
   The move comes 12 years after an attempt during the Carter
administration to raise a $20 million preservation fund failed.
   Over the years, money has been raised privately from benefactors
to buy furniture, paintings and other appointments for the White
House, but it has never had an endowment. Just this week the White
House announced installation of a new rug, drapes and other
furnishings in the Oval Office at a cost of $62,000.
   Mrs. Craig, whose husband Earle M. Craig Jr. is a retired
oilman, said she is hoping to raise the $25 million ``within 2{ to
3 years.''
   Mrs. Craig has been part of past preservation efforts at the
White House, and also helped raised about $200,000 for refurbishing
of the vice presidential mansion when the Bushes lived there. She
also played a role in raising funds for the new Oval Office rug.
   ``Some of my friends at home think I'm going to redecorate the
White House. That is not the case,'' she told reporters. ``I'm
simply a fund-raiser.''
   ``We are starting from scratch,'' she said.
   Nancy Reagan helped win formal museum status for the White
House's public rooms, including the State Dining Room, the East
Room, the Green Room and the Blue Room, which tens of thousands of
visitors troop through each year.

<HEAD>Barry Made Sexual Advances to Woman Before Arrest, Sources Contend</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The night he was arrested on a cocaine
possession charge, Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. made repeated sexual
advances to the woman reported to have helped the FBI lure him to
the room, law enforcement sources said Thursday.
   Barry, who the FBI says was videotaped buying and smoking crack
cocaine, kissed and touched Rasheeda Moore during his visit to her
hotel room, the law enforcement sources said.
   She rebuffed him, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   According to an FBI affidavit filed in connection with the
misdemeanor drug possession charge, agents used a surveillance
camera located in an adjacent room during Barry's 45-minute visit
to Ms. Moore's room at the hotel Thursday night.
   During the visit, the mayor spoke in a decisive voice while
conducting city business on the telephone, said one source.
   The account of sexual advances was first published Thursday in
The Washington Post.
   Barry on Monday checked into a rehabilitation center in West
Palm Beach, Fla., after turning over his duties to city
administrator Carol Thompson.
   In developments Thursday:
   _ Prosecutors delayed the appearance of two of Barry's
bodyguards before a grand jury. A scheduling conflict with federal
prosecutors investigating Barry's ties to a convicted drug dealer
forced the postponement, a source familiar with the probe said.
   Four members of the mayor's security detail, who are assigned to
the mayor on a round-the-clock basis, have been subpoenaed to
testify about whether they have knowledge of any Barry drug use,
said law enforcement and city government sources.
   _ Business, labor and community leaders were meeting Thursday
night to discuss plans to encourage Jesse Jackson to become a
candidate in the November mayoralty election. Meanwhile, however,
Jackson complained in comments in The New York Times that the
mayor's position had ``zero political leverage.''
   _ Former comedian Dick Gregory, who spent several days
immediately following Barry's arrest at the mayor's residence, said
in Las Vegas that Barry's closest friends were ``tickled to death''
to see that he was seeking help. However, Gregory said at a Las
Vegas meeting that he was angry that the federal government has
spent so much time and effort in arresting the mayor.
   _ Bush administration drug policy coordinator William J. Bennett
said Barry's arrest ``might be one of these watershed kind of
events that changes peoples' attitudes and makes people really
realize they have to do something.''
   Law enforcement and other sources say Ms. Moore, 38, had a
longstanding romantic relationship with the mayor but began
cooperating with the FBI's investigation several weeks ago
following her arrest on a drunken driving charge near her home in
Burbank, Calif.
   She had been told by the FBI not to have sexual relations with
Barry during Thursday night's sting operation, law enforcement
sources said. She also was instructed not to smoke any crack or to
make any suggestion about using illegal drugs, to avoid any
subsequent defense claim of entrapment, the sources said.
   Barry himself raised the subject of drugs, and purchased a small
quantity of crack cocaine from an FBI undercover agent posing as a
friend of Ms. Moore, according to a court affidavit and sources.
   Ms. Moore began cooperating with the FBI after her arrest in
North Hollywood, Calif. Jan. 1. The FBI, which had lodged a
``material witness warrant,'' was put in touch with her,
authorities in California said.
   She agreed to cooperate in the sting operation after being
confronted with grand jury testimony she gave last spring during
which she denied using cocaine with the mayor, sources said.
   They said she told investigators that she and Barry used drugs
on repeated occasions over a number of years, including a March
1988 weekend trip to the Virgin Islands.
   Her story corroborates testimony by convicted drug dealer
Charles Lewis, who said he used cocaine with Barry during the
Virgin Islands trip and at a downtown hotel in the nation's capital.
   Law enforcement sources say prosecutors are trying to build a
perjury case against the mayor, who denied in sworn grand jury
testimony that he ever used illegal drugs.
   The grand jury has called additional witnesses, including
members of the mayor's security detail.
   A native of Washington, Ms. Moore graduated from modeling school
here and has posed in the past for such national magazines as
Essence. She was employed by the city government as a social worker
in 1987 and 1988, according to a statement this week by the mayor's
office.

Tuesday. No pickup</NOTE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A minority party in East Germany's
Communist-led government resigned its three Cabinet posts late
Thursday and called on other coalition partners to do likewise.
   The withdrawal by the Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
effective Feb. 9, heightened the crisis of confidence faced by the
Communist government of Premier Hans Modrow.
   The official ADN news agency also said Modrow has been invited
to visit Moscow on Tuesday for talks with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev. It said the trip would be a ``working visit,'' but
gave no details.
   The government was forced earlier Thursday to agree to major
concessions to encourage free enterprise because of growing
pressure for market reforms and reunification with West Germany.
   CDU leader Lothar de Maiziere said the three CDU ministers would
serve in the 27-member Cabinet until Feb. 9, effectively setting a
deadline for Modrow to build a new Cabinet that includes
pro-democracy opposition groups.
   ADN quoted de Maiziere as saying his party took the step to
``make way for negotiations with new parties and groups'' toward
formation of a new government, and ``assumes other parties in the
government will take the same steps.''
   Communists now hold 16 ministerial posts, Liberal Democrats
four, Christian Democrats three, and the National Democrats and
farmers' party two each.
   De Maiziere is a deputy premier. The two other CDU Cabinet
members are Construction Minister Gerhard Baumgaertel and Post
Minister Klaus Wolf.
   The CDU threatened on Jan. 17 to pull out of the government to
protest the Communists' tight grip on power.
   The non-Communist Cabinet members are all from officially
recognized parties once aligned with the Communists. All have tried
to distance themselves from a party now disgraced and stripped of
authority.
   Modrow has agreed to include opposition forces in his Cabinet
until free elections are held on May 6, but the pro-democracy
groups like New Forum, Democratic Awakening and the Social
Democrats disagree among themselves how large a role they should
take on.
   The parties would also be taking on partial responsibility for
the disastrous state of the East German economy and the uncertain
political situation.
   Earlier Thursday, a leading politician, Dresden Mayor Wolfgang
Berghofer, told his city council that German unification is
inevitable because East Germany never developed a separate national
identity.
   Germany was split into Communist East and capitalist West after
Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime was defeated in World War II.
   ``It is unavoidable that what belongs together will grow
together,'' said Berghofer, who quit the Communist Party on Sunday.
   ``The only question is in what time frame and in what manner it
will occur.''
   Modrow will visit Bonn on Feb. 13-14 to meet with West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to discuss the dire economic and political
problems in East Germany, Kohl chief of staff Rudolf Seiters
announced.
   On Thursday, Economics Minister Christa Luft told a news
conference the government has scrapped plans to limit foreign
ownership of joint ventures to 49 percent, a concession to Western
business executives who spurned the earlier conditions.
   East Germany also will lift all restrictions on competition
among private industry and crafts people, effectively opening the
national economy to free enterprise, government spokesman Wolfgang
Meyer announced.
   The steps embracing capitalism illustrate the heightened fears
among East German leaders that the nation is headed toward economic
collapse.
   Statistics this week showed a sharp drop in production, and Ms.
Luft confirmed that about 2,000 East Germans are fleeing the nation
each day.
   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans fled last year. Growing
street protests toppled the hard-line regime of Erich Honecker.
   New Communist leaders opened the Berlin Wall and promised free
elections to placate the masses. But the exodus West apparently has
not been halted.
   Seiters said more than 42,500 East Germans had moved to West
Germany since Jan. 1.
   The exodus has robbed East Germany of vital labor strength and
undermines economic recovery efforts.
   Communist officials tried unsuccessfully beginning last fall to
adopt an economy combining socialism and capitalism, but pressure
for more radical change forced the Communists to yield to Western
business demands.
   Majority foreign ownership of East German businesses will be
allowed for any small and medium-size firms, and for any projects
``in the public's economic interest,'' Ms. Luft said.
   Ms. Luft suggested that the condition of ``public economic
interest'' would be loosely defined to ensure interest among
Western investors.
   She also confirmed that East Germany has accepted West German
promises of $3.5 billion in aid _ an offer initially rejected on
the grounds that Bonn's demands for a freer East German market were
unacceptable.
   The conditions involved changing the East German economy, such
as competition among enterprises and favorable tax laws and other
incentives for foreign investors.

   Three U.S. minesweepers operating in the
Persian Gulf will return to the United States because of a reduced
mine threat in the waterway, the Pentagon announced on Thursday.
   The ships _ the USS Esteem, USS Enhance and the USS Conquest _
are expected to return to their home ports on the West Coast, the
Pentagon said in a statement.
   The redeployment ``in no way reflects a decrease in the U.S.
commitment to the area,'' the statement said.
   ``The U.S. is firmly committed to promoting the stability of the
Persian Gulf region. The free flow of oil through the Strait of
Hormuz and the principle of freedom of navigation are vitally
important to our country,'' the statement said.
   In mid-1987, there was a massive U.S. naval buildup in the
Persian Gulf in the wake of the Iran-Iraq war, during which some
540 commercial ships were damaged or sank.
   The U.S. sharply increased its forces in the gulf to protect
U.S. shipping, as well as to escort Kuwaiti-owned tankers
registered under the Stars and Stripes.
   Although Pentagon officials declined to say exactly how many
U.S. ships were operating in the gulf, they said some 20 U.S. ships
were operating in the vicinity of the Indian Ocean.

   The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday
cautioned consumers against buying potentially dangerous
L-tryptophan dietary supplements distributed nationally by a
California company.
   The company _ NutriCology Inc. of San Leandro, Calif., which
also markets under the name of Allergy Research Group _ has not
complied with an urgent FDA recall request, the agency said.
   A woman answering the company's telephone refused to relay
repeated calls to an official of the company or a supervisor in
charge.
   The agency said 334 other manufacturers, repackers and
distributors have complied with the Nov. 17 request for recall of
products that would result in a total dietary intake of 100
milligrams or more of L-tryptophan a day.
   The FDA requested the recall because L-tryptophan, an amino
acid, has been linked to eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, which is
marked by severe muscle and joint pain, swelling of the arms and
legs, skin rash and sometimes fever.
   The Centers for Disease Control has reports of 1,143 cases of
the syndome, including nine deaths _ one of which has been
confirmed to have been ``clearly associated'' with L-tryptophan.
Cases have been reported in all 50 states, the District of Columbia
and Puerto Rico.
   Public health experts have not been able to identify a specific
lot, brand, manufacturer or supplier of the supplement as the cause
of the outbreak. They also have been unable to identify a specific
chemical or microbial contaminant that could be responsible, the
FDA said.
   The L-tryptophan products made by the company are:
   _L-tryptophan capsules, 500 milligrams, 100 capsules to a
bottle, under the Allergy Research Group label.
   _Tryptophan P.R.N., 350 milligrams, 30 capsules to a bottle
under the NutriCology and Allergy Research labels.
   _Free Aminos, 750 milligram capsules, and Free Aminos without
cystine and cysteine, both in 100-capsule bottles, and Free Aminos
powder in 50 and 100 gram bottles, all under both labels.
   The FDA said the company responded to the November recall
request by saying they ``may recall'' their products, but that
company officials have refused to furnish the agency with any proof
they have begun a recall.

<TEXT>
   Guillermo Endara, installed as
president by the United States during last month's invasion, called
the proposed $1 billion U.S. aid package for Panama ``generous
support'' but said it was about half what his government had
requested.
   Endara said in a statement that the aid would help create jobs
and revitalize the international banking system, which was once the
backbone of Panama's economy. But he also said the government would
require a ``substantial reduction of its payroll.''
   Endara had asked for nearly $2 billion in a letter to Bush two
weeks ago, saying his country required that much in assistance and
rebuilding following the Dec. 20 invasion by 26,500 U.S. troops
that ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega from power.
   ``Although the amounts announced do not reach the total we
wished, the total sum constitutes a generous support and the
quickness with which it was announced is very timely,'' Endara's
statement said.
   U.S. officials in Washington said the asssitance would include
developmental aid, loan guarantees and programs to encourage
investment in a country that until recent years, as Noriega took
complete control of Panama, was a thriving center for foreign banks.
   Bush said the package, which requires congressional approval,
includes $500 million in humanitarian assistance for housing,
public works and business assistance, and the balance for
outstanding debts and economic restructuring.
   A spokesman for Endara said further details of how the aid would
be channeled to Panama would be made public next week during a
goodwill visit by Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Panamanians have insisted the United States must also provide
compensation to families of the estimated 202 civilians killed in
the fighting and for losses from three days of looting of
businesses.
   Estimates of the looting losses range as high as $700 million.
Local insurance companies have refused to cover the looting, saying
it was the result of acts of war.
   The aid package includes assistance to enable Panama to obtain
$400 million in loans from international lending agencies.
   The Panamanian government last week announced a $1.5 billion
reconstruction program that includes a job creation fund.
   Unemployment is estimated at 35 percent of the labor force.
Panama has a population of 2.2 million, about half of it in Panama
City.
   Thousands of residents in El Chorrillo, a poor neighborhood near
the Panama Defense Forces headquarters, lost their homes when the
downtown area was bombed and set on fire during the invasion.
   According to international observers, Endara was leading the May
7 presidential elections by a 3-1 margin over Noriega's handpicked
candidate when Noriega annulled the vote.

<HEAD>NATO Doubts Soviet Economic Reforms Will Succeed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic reforms initiated by Mikhail
S. Gorbachev have had little impact so far in the Soviet Union and
appear unlikely to succeed, NATO believes.
   A NATO study obtained Thursday by The Associated Press called
the failure evident from the decline in Soviet living standards.
   The report, based on information up to July, compared economic
reforms in China and the Soviet Union. Economic analysts of the
16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization compiled the study and
handed it to NATO foreign ministers in December.
   It said, ``The failure of the Soviet leadership to press ahead
with key measures such as price reforms, and the half-hearted
manner in which it has approached the growing fiscal and monetary
crisis, are reflected in the continuing decline of the Soviet
Union's economic position.
   ``The survival prospects for economic reforms in the Soviet
Union _ now admitted by the leadership to be in a `state of crisis'
_ become increasingly doubtful.''
   The report said no Communist nation has succeeded in
transforming a centrally planned economy to a flourishing
free-market system, mainly because of the conflicting interests
between demands for economic reforms and the goals of Communist
parties and the vested interests of their members.
   The analysts found, ``Whenever it came to do or die in past
reform efforts, the party bureaucrats have always put their own
interest first, as reflected once again by recent events in China.''
   It said that from the start, economic programs in the Soviet
Union and China were hampered by ``unsuitable political
institutions,'' and predicted the reform drive in China would lose
more ground. The study said reform has been ``rechanneled toward
areas acceptable to the new, more conservative and suspicious
leadership in Beijing.''
   Poland and Hungary, leaders in the moves toward democracy in
Eastern Europe, offered the prospect of cutting ties between the
Communist Party bureaucracy and its vested interest in obsolete
economic structures, the study held, adding:
   ``Gorbachev's support for these efforts in Hungary and Poland
may be indicative of his own vision of reform.''
   The NATO report said, ``By trying to maintain the country's
`socialist achievements,' economic reforms in the Soviet Union will
remain piecemeal.
   ``But piecemeal reforms to a centrally planned economy generate
unpredictable frictions that would not arise if other economic
variables were free to adapt to remove their sting.''

<HEAD>Four Suspected IRA Members Charged in Missile Purchase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four men suspected to be members of
the Irish Republican Army were accused by a federal grand jury of
buying a Stinger missile for the outlaw group's terrorist campaign
in Northern Ireland.
   Arraignment was scheduled Friday before U.S. Magistrate Ann
Vitunac on the indictment issued Wednesday charging the four with
conspiracy and violations of the Neutrality Act and the Arms Export
Control Act.
   The suspects allegedly contracted with an undercover agent and
bought the shoulder-fired missile for the militant Provisional IRA
for use against British military helicopters in Northern Ireland, a
government affidavit said.
   Roger Colton, an attorney who appeared for three defendants at a
bond hearing last week, said he expected the defense to concentrate
on a ``concerned citizen'' mentioned in court as a catalyst for the
undercover sting.
   Charged were Seamus Anthony Moley, 30, a resident of Canada;
Kevin Joseph McKinley, 33, who carries an Irish passport and lives
in Riviera Beach, Fla.; Joseph Martin McColgan, 39, of Dundalk,
Northern Ireland; and Sean McCann, 34, of Toronto, who has a
Canadian passport.
   Each faces up to 38 years in prison if convicted on charges of
conspiracy to violate the Arms Export Control Act, actually
violating the act, attempting to export the Stinger missile and
conspiracy to violate Neutrality Act.
   The defendants earlier were ordered held without bond as
possible flight risks, and two were considered possible threats to
the community. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge
Jose Gonzalez for trial, with the date to be set after the
arraignment.
   Moley was accused of placing $47,500 in a bank safe-deposit box
opened jointly in his name and that of an undercover agent posing
as an arms dealer.
   McColgan then checked out the 5-foot-long surface-to-air missile
at a West Palm Beach warehouse Jan. 12, ``said it was fine and it
was placed in a car,'' the government affidavit alleged.
   In several meetings with undercover agents since Nov. 20, the
four said they also were looking for rifles, explosives and grenade
launchers to pierce newly developed British armor, the affidavit
alleged.
   McKinley allegedly boasted that ``his people'' were responsible
for the Oct. 12, 1984, bombing of a hotel in Brighton, England,
which killed five people during a Conservation Party conclave.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was a target of the attack but
escaped unharmed. Five IRA members were jailed for life in that
bombing and other plots.
   The outlawed IRA is fighting for an end to British rule over
Northern Ireland and its unification with the Irish Republic.

   Three defense analysts Thursday urged the Bush
administration and Congress to cancel or defer a dozen weapon or
other military projects they said the United States no longer needs
in a time of a diminishing Soviet threat and budget constraints.
   ``If we aren't careful about our hardware choices today, we
won't have the funds to buy them efficiently or to spend on other
defense needs,'' Gordon Adams, director of the Defense Budget
Project, told reporters at a news conference.
   Adams was joined by Dr. William Kaufmann and Lawrence Korb of
the Brookings Institution.
   The Defense Budget Project is somewhat left of the center of the
political spectrum. Brookings is closer to the center, but its
staff frequently advocates liberal positions. Kaufmann, a retired
professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and often a
consultant to the Pentagon, is co-author of an annual report on the
defense budget that in recent years has advocated less spending.
Korb served as an assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan
administration.
   The experts said buying the dozen weapons will cost $124 billion
in current dollars from 1991 to 1995, and $342 billion by the time
they are completed.
   The defense budget that President Bush will unveil Monday for
the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, the 1991 year, will be about $303
billion.
   Among the weapons the three analysts slated for deferral are the
AMRAAM Missile, the Army Tactical Missile, the A-12 Advanced
Tactical Aircraft, the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the C-17
transport aircraft, the LHX helicopter and the Seawolf attack
submarine.
   The urged cancellation of the anti-satellite missile, the B-2
stealth bomber, the rail-car mobile basing of the MX missile, the
SRAM-T tactical short-range attack missile and the MILSTAR
satellite system.
   ``A revolution in military affairs could be in the making, at
least in part because of the economic distress in the Soviet Union
and the changes in the Soviet leadership,'' Kaufmann said. ``But
one thing is clear: The revolution will not progress much further
without initiatives from and cooperation by the United States.''

<HEAD>U.S. Army Fighting Crime Wave In Panama City</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has increased its
military patrols in an effort to check a crime wave sweeping the
capital and surrounding areas, a spokesman for the U.S. Southern
Command said Thursday.
   ``There was already some talk of setting up vigilante groups.
The additional U.S. security should stop that,'' he said.
   The spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said measures
include additional checkpoints in Panama City, but did not say how
many more soldiers were on the streets or give additional details.
   Gunmen have been roaming the streets at night and breaking into
homes.
   William Joyce, an American working for the Panama Canal, was
killed Tuesday night in what appeared to be a burglary.
   Masked men entered his home in a supposedly safe residential
area and shot him. They stole jewelry and three rifles from a gun
collection. Joyce was president of the Rod and Gun Club.
   Another Panama Canal Commisison employee was held up a few days
earlier.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon, who is also government
and justice minister, met with commanders of the newly formed
Public Force to discuss crime figures and ways of battling the
crime wave, a force spokesman said.
   ``The minister is going over the figures so we cannot release
them,'' he said.
   Business and other leaders have asked President Guillermo
Endara's government to increase security.
   Alfredo Maduro, president of the Panamanian Chamber of Commerce,
said, ``We know there has been an increase in criminal activities.
We have asked that the Public Force and the U.S. Army increase
security in Panama City and in Colon,'' the No. 2 city in Panama.
   ``If there is no security, there could be additional instances
of looting.''
   Maduro was referring to three days of widespread looting
following the Dec. 20 U.S. military invasion that deposed dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``For businessmen it is imperative to have a Public Force that
can be trusted, is respected and inspires security,'' he added.
   Noriega now is in Miami where he is awaiting trial on U.S. drug
trafficking and money laundering charges.
   Endara's government, with U.S. backing, succeeded the Noriega
administration hours after the invasion began.
   American military patrols were heavy following the invasion, but
were reduced last week.

<HEAD>Belgium May Withdraw All of its Troops from West Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Belgium said Thursday it may withdraw
some or all of its 25,000 soldiers from West Germany because of the
political changes in Eastern Europe, but will consult with its NATO
allies first.
   An aide to Defense Minister Guy Coeme confirmed published
comments by Coeme that the thaw in East-West relations made the
action appropriate.
   ``The way the situation in Europe is now evolving, the
withdrawal of Belgian troops from Germany becomes likely,'' Coeme
told the daily De Standaard.
   He said he had asked ``the chiefs of staff to develop several
scenarios for the withdrawal.''
   Coeme also said NATO was not reacting quickly enough to the new
situation and should plan for lower defense expenditures.
   His aide told The Associated Press privately that Belgium might
make a ``partial troop reduction'' and left open the possibility of
a full withdrawal.
   The defense minister told the Belgian news agency Belga on
Thursday that any troop withdrawal would be made in consultation
with the Western allies.
   Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens said in Amman, Jordan, such
withdrawals must be ``agreed on by our allies. We are members of an
alliance and you have to take into consideration the position of
your colleagues in the alliance.''
   In an interview with the daily Le Soir, Coeme said: ``With the
decrease in the Warsaw Pact's combat capacity, how can we justify
the status quo on our side, the maintenance of our troops in
Germany?''
   A NATO source said Coeme's remarks were ``not helpful'' and were
politically inspired, a reference a five-day visit to the Soviet
Union the minister will begin Saturday.
   Coeme's aide said Belgium did not seek to ``provoke'' its allies.
   A NATO statement said troop reductions must be made under an
accord being negotiated with the Warsaw Pact in Vienna on
conventional forces in Europe.
   ``Arms control commitments will bind Gorbachev and whoever
succeeds him, since intentions or leadership may change'' in
Moscow, the statement said, referring to President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   About 200 ethnic Albanians
demonstrated in a Kosovo town Thursday and activists called for a
general strike to demand the lifting of a state of emergency from
the restive province.
   On Wednesday, riot police used tear gas and water cannons to
disperse about 40,000 ethnic Albanians who demonstrated in
Pristina, the provincial capital, against alleged human rights
abuses.
   Police used clubs and attack dogs Thursday to stop the
demonstration by ethnic Albanians in Urosevac, about 25 miles south
of Pristina. Police sources said several officers were injured by
stones and two squad cars were damaged.
   During both demonstrations, people chanted ``Traitors!
Traitors!'' and demanded the resignation of Rahman Morina, the
province's Communist president and former police chief, whom they
blame for the alleged abuses.
   Activists said a general strike was called for Friday by ethnic
Albanians, who make up about 90 percent of the 1.9 million people
in Kosovo, an impoverished southern province adjacent to Albania.
   At Wednesday's demonstration, protesters made eight demands,
including a halt to ``political trials and police brutality'' and
release of ``political prisoners.''
   They also demanded that ``anti-Albanian discrimination'' stop
and free elections be held in Kosovo.
   At least 28 people were killed in ethnic violence last year
after consitutional changes limited the province's autonomy and
gave Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, near-total control.
Kosovo is part of Serbia.
   Hundreds of ethnic Albanians were jailed in a police crackdown
that followed the unrest, and a partial state of emergency remains
in effect.

   An Israeli businessman reportedly linked to
mercenaries who trained Medellin drug cartel gunmen was found dead
at the airport here, stuffed into the trunk of a car, police said
Thursday.
   The body of Arik Afek, who had been interviewed recently by
Secret Service agents preparing for President Bush's visit to
Colombia, was discovered Wednesday after police received complaints
of an offensive odor coming from a car in the Miami International
Airport parking garage.
   The cause of death wasn't immediately announced, but was
definitely a homicide, said police spokeswoman Lizette Williams.
   ``We are looking for anyone who can give us information on the
case,'' she said, adding that detectives hadn't revealed if they
have suspects.
   The body was found in a beige Buick Regal, but Ms. Williams said
she had no information on the car's ownership.
   The Dade County Medical Examiner's office, where the body was
taken, referred questions to the Metro-Dade police, who were
awaiting autopsy results and declined to reveal whether the body
had any marks or wounds.
   ``They're not releasing that, but you realize the body was in a
trunk for several days,'' said Ms. Williams. She said police
wouldn't speculate on the cause of death because of the body's
decomposing condition.
   In Washington, a U.S. official who spoke on condition on
anonymity said Afek gave several different accounts of his
activities to Secret Service agents who interviewed him within the
last two weeks.
   The agents have been trying to determine if the Medellin drug
cartel has access to anti-aircraft missiles or other weapons that
could be used against President Bush during his visit to Colombia
next month for a drug summit.
   The Secret Service found out about Afek through news reports of
his activities in Colombia, said an administration source, also
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Last year, Colombian authorities accused Afek of helping reserve
Israeli army Lt. Col. Yair Klein escape from Colombia amid reports
Klein was training the guards of drug lords there. Klein later said
he thought he was training farmers to fight guerrillas.
   In September, Colombian authorities issued arrest warrants for
both Klein and Afek.
   At the time, Diva Rojas, a spokeswoman for Colombia's Department
of Security, identified Afek as a civilian who had an arms business
in Israel and flower shops in the United States. Miami police said
he had a home south of the city.
   The two Israelis were wanted for violating laws against
conspiring, teaching and enlisting civilians in military operations
without the approval of the Defense Ministry, Ms. Rojas said.
   The two men were believed to have entered Colombia in August
1988 and to have left in mid-1989 after reports surfaced that
foreign mercenaries were training hit squads for the Medellin and
Cali drug cartels.
   Reached in Tel Aviv on Tuesday, Klein denied he fled Colombia,
saying he left normally, and showed reporters a passport stamp.
Israel has refused to extradite Klein, saying the charges aren't
covered by extradition treaties.
   Israeli television claimed Thursday that Afek was being
investigated by the CIA, which had given him a U.S. passport in
return for information on Israeli activity in Colombia.

   A tornado swept through a trailer home
park early Thursday, injuring 24 people, including a boy who
witnesses said was freed by a man who managed to lift the corner of
the mobile home that had pinned him down.
   No deaths were reported from the tornado that hit about 5:30
a.m., when most people were sleeping in this community 40 miles
south of Montgomery.
   Nancy Williams, a spokeswoman for Crenshaw County hospital, said
24 people were hospitalized with injuries, three of them children
with serious head wounds who were transferred to a Montgomery
medical center.
   One of the three, 7-year-old Erik Thompson, later was taken to
Children's Hospital in Birmingham, where he was listed in critical
condition.
   David Coggins, director of an emergency services agency, said
several people were rescued from wrecked trailer homes. ``We had to
take wreckers and pull off the mobile homes to get people out.'' he
said.
   About a dozen trailer homes were torn from cinder block
foundations or ripped open, with furniture, clothes, food, dolls
and pink insulation strewn about. The tangled wreckage made it
impossible to tell how many homes once had been standing in the
community off a dirt road.
   Witnesses credited Michael Wells, 31, with lifting a remnant of
a trailer home and pulling eight people out of the wreckage. One
victim was a boy trapped under a corner of the trailer.
   ``The boy was screaming and his head was bloody. I picked it up
but I don't know how,'' said Wells. ``I had to do it. Somebody had
to help.''
   John Lee, the hospital's administrator, said Wells was
``instrumental in pulling several of the people out. After he
pulled them out, he collapsed.''
   Wells, who was hospitalized with a back injury, said he was
walking between two trailers when the storm hit.
   ``I saw it coming and the trailers just started rolling like
toys,'' he said. He said that as he searched for the trapped
victims, ``all I could do was tell them to scream so I could find
them, it was so dark.''
   Another twister paralleling the Centenary tornado struck nearby
Fuller's Crossroads, where several trailer homes and chicken houses
were destroyed, but no injuries were reported.

<HEAD>USDA, EPA Differ On Pesticides</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and EPA
chief William K. Reilly expressed differences Thursday on the need
to regulate pesticides found in ground water _ Yeutter saying no,
Reilly saying yes.
   ``I don't think farmers need to be regulated in this area,''
Yeutter told the Senate Agriculture Committee, which is beginning
work on the 1990 farm bill.
   Yeuetter, who was taken to task by the committee chairman for
alleged anti-environmentqal remarks, later backtracked a bit to
concede that some regulation is inevitable.
   ``Farmers are not deliberately damaging the environment and have
never done so,'' he said. ``They are sometimes innocent victims of
environmental degradation, but they are not the culprits.''
   He said farmers need instead to be ``informed, stimulated and
encouraged'' to engage in sound practices.
   Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Reilly said at the
same hearing that the agency is evaluating old and new pesticides
for ground water contamination potential.
   ``Based on these and other data the Agency will decide whether
to use nationally applicable restrictions to regulate pesticides
posing widespread national concerns,'' he said. Examples would
include allowing only licensed applicators to use the chemicals or
imposing regional bans on use.
   He said his department is developing a ground water pollution
control strategy that would include pesticide regulations.
   The proposed strategy calls for states to develop management
plans based on local conditions and needs.
   He gave as one example a proposed decision on aldicarb, under
which the pesticide could be used only if states operate pesticide
management plans for it.
   But the proposal also includes national restrictions that would
ban use within 300 feet of wells, restriction of use to qualified
applicators and monitoring requirements.
   Reilly, whose agency regulates pesticides but not fertilizers,
said his agency must ``closely coordinate'' with the Agriculture
Department.
   ``We understand and are sensitive to the many objectives which
the farm bill must achieve, and that environmental protection is
only one of these,'' Reilly said.
   Although EPA is concerned about growing ground water
contamination by nitrate compounds from fertilizer and animal
wastes, ``the options available to farmers are generally limited to
reducing use or changing basic farming practices to reduce the
likelihood of contamination,'' he said.
   The hearing heated up briefly when Committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., rapped Yeutter for remarks critical of
environmentalists.
   ``It is wrong to claim that environmentalists are forcing
needless and unwanted regulation on farmers,'' Leahy said.
   When Leahy asked him whether he planned to end the criticism,
Yeutter responded: ``Provided that it is responded (to) in kind by
folks who place themselves in the category of environmental
advocacy. It takes two to tango, and I expect sensible, reasonable
rational proposals to emanate from the so-called environmental
community if there is to be an olive branch from me or anyone
else.''
   When asked what he meant by ``so-called,'' Yeutter mentioned the
groups who raised concerns over Alar in apples and ``a statement
from a particular group that indicate that group, which I will not
identify, would like to eliminate the use of all agricultural
pesticides by 1995.''
   The chief group involved in Alar was the Natural Resources
Defense Council.
   Under questioning from Sen. Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., Yeutter
said he may have ``oversimplified'' his position on regulation.
   ``Some regulation in ground water is simply invevitable,'' he
said, calling it ``secondary'' to what can be done outside the
regulatory arena.
   Yeutter's remarks Thursday further irritated one environmental
group.
   ``We know of no environmental group involved in this area of
policy that has made such an outrageous proposal'' to ban
pesticides, said Maureen Hinkle, director of agricultural policy
for the National Audubon Society. ``Secretary Yeutter is escalating
his anti-environmental rhetoric. If he wants to know what
environmental groups think about the farm bill, why won't he meet
with us to discuss the matter?''

<HEAD>Bulgarian Communists Meet in Unexpected Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Central Committee of Bulgaria's
ruling Communist Party met in a hurriedly called evening session
Thursday following demands in Parliament by Communist deputies that
attacks on their party end.
   The parliamentary session was due to last through Friday and to
decide on sorely needed economic reforms, but was abruptly broken
off Thursday night and will not resume until Feb. 8, the official
news agency BTA said.
   Speculation spread that divisions between party reformers and
conservatives were deepening, five days before the party is to hold
a national congress that could cast out holdovers from the Todor
Zhivkov era.
   Zhivkov is under arrest for abuse of office during 35 years in
power. He was ousted Nov. 10 in the reforms that washed over
Eastern Europe and was replaced by his former foreign minister,
Petar Mladenov.
   Mladenov, who took over as party chief and Bulgaria's president,
has pledged to hold multiparty elections by May. But opposition
groups now holding talks with the Communists on power-sharing and a
new election law have charged that the Communists seek to keep
control in Bulgaria.
   Usually well-informed sources said the policy-setting Central
Committee would discuss Mladenov's keynote speech to the party
congress and documents to be voted on at the congress.
   Although senior party ranks have been purged of Zhivkov's best
known supporters, many orthodox Communists in the provinces kept
their positions of power.
   Conservative Communists were strongly in evidence at Thursday's
session of the National Assembly, or parliament.
   Construction Minister Petar Petrov vigorously defended himself
against demands for his resignation by a group of citizens in the
ecologically scarred northern town of Ruse.
   He won support from a majority of deputies, including Defense
Minister Dobri Dzhurov, an influential figure said to have played a
key role in Zhivkov's overthrow.
   Dzhurov was loudly applauded as he urged a halt to ``attacks on
the Communist party.''
   BTA said said the legislature ``decided to let him keep his job
and to sue his slanderers.''
   ``Although indirectly, this gives satisfaction to many other
leaders at all levels around the country, who are not the targets
of invective,'' said BTA.
   Bulgaria has also been hit the past week with labor stoppages.
   BTA said the legislature asked for an end to all strikes until
June, when the government plans to review salaries and revamp the
social security system.

<TEXT>
   The Senate on Thursday narrowly upheld
President Bush's veto of a bill protecting Chinese students from
deportation, leaving his China policy intact and giving him a
victory in the year's first test of strength with the
Democratic-controlled Congress.
   Senators voted 62-37 to override Bush's veto, four short of the
two-thirds necessary.
   The action came a day after the House had voted overwhelming to
reject Bush's veto, and followed an intense White House lobbying
blitz that included telephone calls from Bush and former President
Richard Nixon.
   In a televised appearance just after the vote, Bush said, ``We
will continue to urge China to respect the human rights of its
citizens.'' He hailed the vote as ``reaffirming our commitment to
Chinese students in this country as well as the goal of improving
relations with China.''
   Bush then invited the 37 Republican senators who voted with him,
and the 25 House Republicans who stood with him on Wednesday, to
the White House for beer and pretzels.
   Haiching Zhao of the Independent Federation of Chinese Students
and Scholars, which represents Chinese students studying in the
United States, said he was ``gravely disappointed'' by the vote.
   In Newton, Mass., Harvard graduate student Xiaxia Gong said,
``How can we believe someone who has already cheated and sent
high-level officials to China when he said he would not?''
   Before the Senate roll call, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, said that while Bush has voiced support for
democratic reform in Eastern Europe, ``this veto sends a contrary
message to the millions of students and workers in China who are
struggling for democracy in their country.''
   But Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the minority leader, said the
congressional showdown was the equivalent of ``throwing out the
first ball'' of the 1990 election season and was being used by
Democrats to force GOP senators to cast ``a tough political vote''
to support the president.
   ``It's not China policy, it's American politics,'' Dole said.
   Just before the vote, Bush had publicly renewed his promise that
the 40,000 Chinese students in the United States would be fully
protected even without the legislation. ``No student, as long as
I'm president, will be sent back,'' he said.
   The 390-25 House vote on Wednesday prompted immediate criticism
from the Chinese foreign ministry in Beijing. A spokesman there
said the House was ``fully revealing its anti-China position'' and
was risking damage to relations between the two countries.
   But Sen. William Armstrong of Colorado, a Republican who opposed
Bush, said, ``The House put itself squarely on record in support of
human freedom ... and made it clear it is not willing to be
accomplices'' to repression of dissent.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior Foreign Affairs Committee
member, said the vote was ``clearly ... a general report card on
the president and China.'' But the narrowness of Bush's win
signaled likely continued sparring over U.S. policy toward the
world's most populous country.
   During the vote, Vice President Dan Quayle presided over the
Senate. His spokesman, Dave Beckwith, said the gesture was to
``thank Republican senators who were personally inclined to vote
the other way for giving the president the benefit of the doubt.''
   Senators who supported the override said it was important to
maintain U.S. leadership for human rights and to demonstrate
disapproval of the Chinese government's bloody crackdown on
pro-democracy demonstrators last June 4. Hundreds and perhaps
thousands of demonstrators were killed in Beijing.
   Beyond protecting Chinese students from being sent home to face
possible persecution, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said the bill
represented ``America's symbol to a world that is struggling to
throw off the chains of dictators.''
   Another Republican, Sen. Slade Gorton of Washington, said that
letting the veto stand sends ``the signal that they can get away
with what they have done and retain their power. And I think that's
wrong.''
   But Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., said, ``The issue is whether the
Senate will vote today to repudiate the leadership of the
president.'' Lawmakers should instead help ``assure our foreign
policy is coherent and predictable, and that our president is given
the standing to articulate that policy in his dealings as our
spokesman with the leaders of the world,'' he said.
   Bush, under heavy pressure from Congress, imposed limited
sanctions on China following the crackdown but has begun to lift
them in recent months. Among the concessions have been White House
permission to ship communications satellites to China and the
sending of top-level envoys on two secret missions to Beijing.
   Congressional opponents have strongly criticized the moves,
saying Bush was ``kowtowing'' to the aging leaders of a brutal
regime and abandoning those who are pressing for democratic reform.
   The immigration bill that was the subject of the fight was
passed unanimously by the House and on a voice vote in the Senate
last year. Bush vetoed it on Nov. 30.
   It was designed to ensure that students in the United States
would not be forced to return home to possible political reprisals
when their visas expire, and to allow them to work while in this
country. Many of the students spoke out in favor of the
pro-democracy movement.
   When Bush vetoed the bill, he ordered government agencies to
adopt what he says are essentially the same safeguards. The veto
was an effort to preserve executive branch foreign policy
prerogatives, he said, and to keep open the door for future student
and cultural exchanges.
   Thursday's day-long debate grew intense at times. At one point,
Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy's voice rose as he compared Bush's
China policy to the U.S. ``constructive engagement'' stance toward
South Africa's white minority apartheid government.
   ``You're wrong at the top of your lungs,'' shot back Sen. John
Chafee, R-R.I. ``This is a nation of a billion people. The senator
from Massachusetts says, `Put them over in the corner by
themselves.' That's nonsense. The president knows a good deal more
about relations with the People's Republic of China than either of
us.''

   A fierce storm with torrential rains driven by

England and into Europe on Thursday, killing at least 62 people in
five countries.
   A reactor chimney was blown down at the Paluel nuclear power
plant in France. State-owned Electricite de France said the plant
was shut down immediately and any possible hazards would be
monitored.
   The Dutch coast guard reported a Soviet fishing vessel with 56
people aboard in trouble off the north coast. The Defense Ministry
in the Netherlands said three navy helicopters and two lifeboats
were in the area to offer help.
   The casualty figure was highest in Britain, where police said 39
people had been killed. Elsewhere, authorities reported 11 killed
in the Netherlands, six in France, five in Belgium and one in West
Germany.
   Those killed in Belgium including a woman and her child who died
near Brussels when a tree crashed on their car. A bicycle rider was
killed after he was swept under a truck in Torhout, western
Belgium, in winds that peaked at 105 mph, authorities said.
   Elsewhere in Belgium, where sea, train and road traffic was
either halted or seriously hampered by the storm, a 72-year-old man
who climbed on his roof to estimate damage was blown to his death
in Sint Niklaas. A 56-year-old man died from a heart attack after
he also climbed to his roof in Horion-Hozemont.
   Winds caused severe damage in West Germany, particularly in
coastal Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony states. A 53-year-old
man was swept off his bicycle near Aurich in Lower Saxony and run
over by a car, police said. The man was rushed to a hospital but
died of his injuries.
   Police said they feared the death toll in southern England would
rise by dawn as the full extent of the damage comes to light. Winds
of 90 mph snarled rail, subway and road traffic.
   Lashing rain smashed windows in central London, tore off roofs
and knocked down scaffolding and billboards. Pedestrians clung to
one another to keep their feet. Electricity went off for 250,000
people in western England.
   The death toll was much higher than in October 1987, when
Britain's most destructive storm in centuries killed 17 people.
   Only one British Rail station in London was open Thursday
afternoon and subway service was disrupted by fallen tree limbs on
surface sections.
   Some highways, including the six-lane M25 freeway circling the
capital, were blocked by overturned trucks.
   Several people were killed when tree limbs crashed onto them or
their cars, two children died when parts of their schools collapsed
and two men restoring a 17th century house were killed by
wind-blown scaffolding.
   A man was lost overboard from the Liberian-registered freighter
Serica about 200 miles off southwest Britain.
   Among the injured were Gorden Kaye, a television comedian
critically hurt when the wind hurled a plank of wood from a
billboard through the windshield of his car.
   Ferry service across the English Channel was suspended and
disrupted between Scotland and Northern Ireland, the Coast Guard
said.
   ``These are the worst weather conditions I have ever seen in
well over 20 years of service,'' said Capt. James Martin, skipper
of the channel ferry Pride of Kent. ``The conditions out here are
atrocious.''
   The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew, which lost thousands of fine
old trees to the hurricane-force winds of October 1987, lost 100 on
Thursday, including 200-year-old cedars.
   Six people were reported killed in France, including a
12-year-old girl crushed when wind blew down a wall in a school
courtyard, and 11 in the Netherlands.
   Dozens of people were reported injured along France's northern
coast and hundreds of thousands were left without power.
   Police said winds that reached 110 mph blew roofs away, tore
down power lines, chimneys and silos, and blocked roads with the
rubble.
   Dutch television said one of the victims in Holland was a man
killed in Binnenmaas village while trying to secure his windmill
against the storm.
   Klaas Wilting, spokesman for the Amsterdam police, described the
city as ``a madhouse.''
   He said dozens of cars were crushed by falling trees and one of
two tunnels connecting the Dutch capital to its northern suburbs
was closed when pieces of concrete blew onto feeder roads.
   The wind blew a dozen trucks onto their sides, causing major
traffic jams, Wilting said.
   The British government's Meteorological Office, responsible for
weather forecasting, said the winds abated as the storm moved into
the North Sea Thursday night but that high winds were expected
again for much of Britain on Friday.

   A woman implicated in the slayings of her
two baby girls apologized to her husband for not giving him a son
when her first child was born, she told jurors Wednesday, but she
denied killing her children.
   ``I loved my daughters and I still do,'' Paula Sims, 30,
testified at her murder trial. ``I had lots of plans for them, but
they are all gone.''
   The defense rested after the testimony by Mrs. Sims, who has
told police her daughters were taken by masked gunmen who broke
into her home last year and in 1986. Closing arguments are
scheduled for Monday.
   Mrs. Sims _ sometimes weeping, sometimes angry _ told the
Madison County Circuit Court jury and a packed courtroom that
prosecution witnesses had been terribly mistaken when they said she
didn't like female babies.
   She said she was extremely happy and proud at the birth of her
first daughter, Loralei Marie, on June 1986, although she was upset
she didn't have a boy for her husband, Robert Sims, 37.
   ``I wanted to give Robert a son to carry on the Sims name,'' she
testified. ``I was a little disappointed ... and I apologized to
him for not giving him a son.''
   Mrs. Sims is on trial for first-degree murder in the death of
her second daughter, 6-week-old Heather Lee, who disappeared last
April 29. The infant was suffocated and her body frozen before
being stuffed in a trash barrel in neighboring Missouri, police
said.
   The mother also has been implicated in the 1986 slaying of
13-day-old Loralei.
   Asked by defense attorney Donald Groshong if she had killed
either girl, Mrs. Sims replied, ``No, I did not.''
   The most heated exchange occurred when prosecutor Donald Weber
accused her of hiding Heather's body in her parents' freezer.
   ``No, I didn't,'' Mrs. Sims replied. ``No, I didn't.''
   Mrs. Sims, who had a son after Loralei's death, recounted the
exact birth times, weights and lengths of all three of her
children, but answered more than 30 prosecution questions with ``I
don't know'' or ``I don't remember.''
   She said that on June 17, 1986, the night Loralei disappeared,
she was in the basement of the couple's former home in the rural
southwestern Illinois town of Brighton when she saw a gunman.
   ``I noticed a man coming down the stairs and I thought, `What's
he doing here?''' she said. ``He pointed a gun at me and told me to
lay down on the floor for 10 minutes or he'd kill me.''
   She said she followed his instructions and jumped up only when
she heard the front door slam. She then noticed Loralei's bassinet
was empty.
   ``I yelled `Loralei! Loralei!' and ran up the stairs as fast as
I could,'' Mrs. Sims said, crying.
   But when she got outside, the gunman was gone, she said.
   After her son was born in 1988, Mrs. Sims said she hoped to have
another girl because she'd lost her first daughter.
   She said a similar masked gunman attacked her at their home in
Alton near the Mississippi River on April 29, knocking her
unconscious and taking Heather.
   Upon regaining consciousness, she discovered Heather was missing.
   ``I stood there in shock and panic,'' Mrs. Sims said.
   Robert Sims was working at the time of the disappearances. He
faces no charges in either case and has custody of the couple's
son, Randy, who turns 2 next week.
   Mrs. Sims faces trial in Jersey County on charges of obstruction
of justice and concealment of a homicide in Loralei's death.

<TEXT>
   Federal agents seized the wounded cousin of a
Mexican drug lord and 14 armed men acting as his bodyguards after
he checked into a border city hospital, the attorney general's
office said Wednesday.
   Office spokesman Arturo Antelmo said Rigoberto Campos Salcido
had been sought for questioning and his apprehension in Mexicali
could help police find his cousin Manuel Salcido, long wanted by
authorities.
   Campos Salcido was reported barely unconscious Wednesday in the
hospital's intensive care unit and agents were unable to question
him.
   He was admitted with extensive wounds in both arms, which he
said were the result of an accident with a drill at one of his
ranches, Antelmo reported.
   The agents were acting on a tip when they raided Almater
Hospital in Mexicali, capital of Baja California state across the
border from Calexico, Calif., the office reported, but it did not
say when the men were captured.
   The spokesman said, ``The Attorney General's office has been
searching for (Manuel) Salcido for about six years. That's why this
is important. Now there will surely be a lead on him.''
   Antelmo said the 14 heavily armed men accompanying Campos
Salcido identified themselves as friends who were there to protect
him, Antelmo said.
   A news release from the attorney general's office said federal
authorities seized two houses and two ranches belonging to Campos
Salcido.
   It said that in subsquent raids on various hideouts, agents
seized a hand grenade, automatic weapons, ammunition, radio
communications equipment, three vehicles, aviation fuel, 815 pounds
of marijuana and two ounces of cocaine.
   Campos Salcido was being held for questioning but was not
immediately charged, Antelmo said. The 14 others were charged with
drug trafficking and illegal possession of firearms.
   One of the men, Magdaleno Coronel Villarreal, told federal
officers he and two of the others had been smuggling marijuana to
the United States since 1985, the news release said.
   Coronel Villarreal was imprisoned at Tijuana state penitentiary
from 1977 to 1984 for drug trafficking.

   Ethiopian rebels said Wednesday they
killed or wounded more than 8,000 government soldiers in a
north-central province this month.
   A news release issued by the Tigrean People's Liberation Front
said its forces and allied guerrillas repelled a government
counteroffensive in Wollo Province from Jan. 14-17.
   The front maintains an office in Khartoum. Its statement could
not be independently confirmed and Ethiopia's Soviet-backed
government of President Mengistu Haile Mariam has claimed its own
recent battlefield successes in Wollo.
   The statement said the Ethiopian army had attempted to recapture
a ``liberated'' area near Kutaber, about 60 miles north of the
capital of Addis Ababa.
   In the four days of fighting, the statement said, 2,637
government soldiers were killed, 4,274 wounded, including the
division's commander, and 270 captured.
   The rebels said they captured two tanks and destroyed three
others and seized six pieces of heavy artillery along with hundreds
of small arms.
   In earlier fighting in eastern Wollo, the statement said, 1,340
government soldiers were killed or wounded and 27 taken captive.
   The rebels swept out of their home province of Tigre in late
August and moved southward and westward into the provinces of Wollo
and Gonder, joining forces with the much smaller Ethiopian People's
Democratic Movement.
   Although dominated by the Tigreans, the combined force calls
itself the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front.

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Thursday passed a law
reining in the once all-powerful security services as the result of
a national scandal involving illegal spying by secret police on
opposition parties.
   Among the scores of people being spied on were some members of
Parliament. The new law spells out that covert intelligence
gathering is allowed only when ``the security of the nation, the
sovereignty of the country and its constitutional order are
endangered by secret activities.''
   As further supervision, Interior Minister State Secretary Zoltan
Gal and Justice Minister Kalman Kulcsar were made responsible for
intelligence operations.
   The measure also changed the name of the main intelligence
agency from the State Security Service to National Security Service.
   Gal said the law was meant to signal ``that the secret service
organs no longer serve the state organization, but have as their
primary aim the security of the entire nation and constitutional
order.''
   The bill became law by a vote of 279-0, with 14 absentions.
   Gal told Parliament in introducing the bill Wednesday that
intelligence agencies underwent little supervision in the past when
Hungary was a one-party Communist state.
   He said a permanent and comprehensive bill governing the
activities of the security services will be presented in Parliament
next month.
   The political spying scandal broke on Jan. 5 when
representatives of two opposition organizations handed reporters
secret documents leaked to them by a member of the secret police.
   Secret police targets for spying included opposition parties and
personalities, writers and religious figures, according to the
documents.
   Chief Public Prosecutor Karoly Szijarto revealed Wednesday the
illegal eavesdropping was even more widespread than originally
thought.
   He told the legislature the internal security department even
spied on the Socialist Party; its predecessor, the Socialist
Workers' (communist) Party and other communist or leftist
organizations. The investigation is still under way.
   Interior Minister Istvan Horvath resigned Tuesday, though he
claimed to have had no knowledge of such practices. He told
legislators that ``in a democracy that is the custom.''
   Hungary formally became a multiparty state Oct. 23. The first
free elections here since 1948 are scheduled for March 25.
   Despite its assertion that it was not involved, the scandal is
believed to have hurt the chances of the Socialist Party at the
polls.

<HEAD>New Program Pays Death Benefits to Terminally Ill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 9th graf, `Current policyholders...,' to add that
program affects all types of life insurance.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By FRED BAYLES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top life insurer plans to allow terminally ill
policyholders and those permanently confined to nursing homes to
tap into death benefits while they are still alive, providing them
cash to cover the enormous cost of dying.
   Insurance experts say the move by the Prudential Insurance
Company of America could bring big change to the industry and
advance new solutions to the growing crisis in long-term care.
   ``It's going to encourage other companies to follow,'' said John
Booth, vice president and chief actuary with the American Council
of Life Insurance. ``Lots of people have been talking about this
kind of policy, but no one has acted.''
   Prudential's new ``living needs benefit program,'' to be
announced on Friday, is the first mass market plan to allow life
insurance policyholders access to their death benefits before they
die.
   It will be available initially to current policyholders in 10
states where regulators have already approved the program: Alabama,
Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Kentucky, Montana, New
Jersey and West Virginia.
   The insurer hopes to expand the program to 3 million
policyholders throughout the country, although in some states, that
would require changes in state law.
   Metropolitan Life, the nation's second-largest insurer, is
considering a program similar to Prudential's, said Gerry
Goldsholle, chief brokerage executive for Metropolitan Life
Brokerage, a subsidiary that markets the company's living benefits
policy.
   ``It is under study,'' he said.
   Under Prudential's program, which affects all types of life
insurance, current policyholders with death benefits of $25,000 are
automatically eligible. New customers with policies of $50,000 can
also qualify. There will be no additional cost.
   Prudential will pay nearly the face value of a policy if a
doctor certifies the policyholder has less than six months to live.
   Policyholders in nursing homes for at least six months with no
hope of leaving can also elect to receive their own death benefits,
either in a lump sum or in monthly payments.
   Prudential President Joseph Melone said the company wants to
help policyholders facing huge medical expenses.
   ``The world is changing in many ways,'' he said. ``People are
living longer and the medical treatment that is keeping them alive
is getting expensive. These are real market needs that should be
met.''
   Melone said the company will assess each claim, figuring in the
amount of interest it would have made on the policy and deduct it
from the face value of the policy.
   For example, the company is now looking into the case of a
57-year-old art director with terminal cancer and an insurance
policy worth $29,834 at the time of his death. The new program
would pay him $29,183.
   ``Payments are made to the policyholder and can be used for any
purpose,'' said Robert Hill, Prudential's senior vice president and
actuary.
   Hill said before the program, the man's only other way of
getting money from his policy was to cash it in for interest
accrued _ in this case only $2,948.
   Similarly, a hypothetical policyholder in a nursing home with a
policy that would pay $229,340 at the time of his death could
collect the money in 60 monthly payments of $3,810, for a total of
$228,600.
   If the same person cashed in the policy, he would receive only
$163,989.
   ``This is certainly not the total solution to catastrophic
care,'' said Melone, ``but if we should survive to an older age and
run into troubles, this will give us added support.''
   Prudential's move follows years of discussion about living
benefits. Prudential's Canadian subsidiary experimented with a
program last year, providing advanced payment to 14 policyholders,
many of them suffering from AIDS.
   In December, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners
adopted guidelines for accelerated payment of benefits. Several
companies already offer limited riders to insurance policies that
provide for early payments. But those types of policies cost more.
   ``Up until now, people have been saying that anyone who wanted
this benefit would have to pay up front for it,'' said Booth.
``Prudential is offering another way that only charges those who
actually use the accelerated benefit. This means there would not
have to be an extra premium for the policy.''
   Prudential still faces obstacles. In some states, like New York,
insurance laws must be rewritten to allow the plan. There are no
taxes on death benefits, but it is uncertain whether that would
apply to early payment of those benefits.
   But the largest test will be whether Prudential's new program
brings in additional customers.
   ``If this gives Prudential new sales and hurts their
competitors, the competitors are sure to run out and do the same
thing,'' said Booth.

   Kim Basinger has bought herself a town.
   Papers were signed Wednesday night in Atlanta closing the
transaction that gives the actress most of Braselton, a community
of 500 in northeast Georgia, said H.B. Braselton Sr., a member of
the family that has owned most of the town for more than 110 years.
   ``I have always dreamed that I would play a major role in
preserving a small rural Georgia town similar to the town where my
grandparents lived,'' said Miss Basinger, who attended high school
in nearby Athens.
   The 1,728 acres were bought for about $20 million by
Braselton@Basinger Ltd. Partnership, a group consisting of Miss
Basinger and an institutional investor represented by Salomon
Brothers Inc. in New York, according to a statement from Miss
Basinger's publicist.
   ``She stated that she would do well for the community and she
would do her best to make everybody love her,'' said Braselton,
co-manager of the family business.
   The land includes the community's downtown, its water and sewer
systems, a bank, a post office, a manufacturing plant and various
retail properties.
   Braselton said the family was given ``a certain length of time''
to dispose of the inventory of a shopping mall included in the
deal. He said that should be done within 60 days.
   He said the actress, who starred in last year's hit movie
``Batman,'' did not provide any more details on what she will do
with the property, but ``we assume that's coming.''
   He said Miss Basinger was at the closing Wednesday, but he did
not know when she next plans to visit her town.
   Miss Basinger's statement said her plans include a 671-acre
industrial park, 510 acres of commercial and retail development and
547 acres for residential use. The industrial park is adjacent to
land where Mitsubishi has invested $36 million for new offices and
plants.
   ``The personality of the area is simply a mirror of its people.
I intend to share my development ideas with the community and to
solicit their responses to my proposals,'' Miss Basinger said.
   Charles L. Morris of Charles L. Morris Realty Inc. in Braselton,
which handled portions of the sale, has said Miss Basinger's plans
include revitalizing the downtown with upscale shops.

<HEAD>President's Son Refuses to Negotiate With Thrift Regulators</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's son Neil announced Thursday he
was refusing to accept a settlement with federal thrift officials
in the collapse of a savings and loan he served as a director.
   The younger Bush disclosed that the Office of Thrift Supervision
had proposed a so-called cease and desist order, which would have
barred him from certain practices if he were to become a thrift
officer in the future.
   Bush, who resigned as a director of Silverado Banking, Savings
and Loan Association of Denver two weeks after his father got the
GOP presidential nomination, said accepting the order would wrongly
make it appear he did something improper.
   ``In my view, a settlement agreement would leave an implication
that I misbehaved as a director of Silverado,'' Bush said in a news
release.
   ``As I have said in the past, I have nothing to hide and I have
done nothing wrong,'' the release continued. ``Therefore, I have
refused to consent to any agreement with the Office of Thrift
Supervision and if they choose to bring action against me, I will
fight the matter in court.''
   Bush, 34, served as a director of Silverado from 1985 until
August 1988.
   The collapse of Silverado, now operating as part of Columbia
Savings, the largest thrift in Colorado, is expected to cost
taxpayers up to $1 billion.
   Karl Hoyle, senior deputy director of the Office of Thrift
Supervision, said in Washington that lawyers for Bush had told the
agency Bush intends to contest the allegations made by thrift
regulators.
   Consequently, the office intends to ask an administrative law
judge to review allegations that Bush had conflicts of interest
while serving as a director of Silverado and to recommend a
cease-and-desist order to the director of the office, M. Danny Wall.
   Hoyle said the agency wouldn't seek a more severe penalty which
would ban Bush from working for a federally insured financial
institution. Asked why, he said the office didn't believe it had
grounds to seek the more serious penalty, which has been imposed on
some former Silverado officers.
   In a related matter, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
is considering whether to sue Silverado officers and directors,
including Bush, for damages for losses to the taxpayers in the
bailout.
   The federal agency said examiners had expressed ``grave
concern'' about Silverado's operations, particularly its heavy
investment in Colorado's ailing commercial real estate market.
   They also have focused their investigation on what they said was
``an exceptionally large number of problem transactions'' between
Silverado insiders and borrowers.
   Bush, who was a partner in an oil exploration firm, JNB
Exploration, had business deals with two of Silverado's major
borrowers, developers Bill L. Walters and Ken Good.
   On Thursday, Bush also addressed those questions.
   ``Bill Walters had a passive 6.25 percent limited partnership
interest in JNB Exploration,'' Bush said. ``Because I did not
benefit directly or indirectly from any loan or transaction between
Silverado and businesses controlled by Bill Walters, as an outside
director I voted in 1986 with the other directors in unanimously
approving the Walters loans and transactions brought to us by
management.
   ``I voted because there was no conflict of interest under the
federal banking laws and regulations or under the laws of
Colorado,'' Bush said.
   Good, according to Bush, had a more active interest in the
financing and management of JNB Exploration, and ``as a result, I
abstained on all votes concerning Good. The other board members
unanimously approved the transactions with Good,'' Bush said.
   He said both Walters' and Good's relationships with Silverado,
as borrowers and preferred shareholders, were established before he
became a director.
   ``Their relationships with my company, which began in 1983, also
preceded my Silverado board appointment,'' Bush said.
   A former federal S&amp;L examiner, James Moroney, has alleged that
regulators dragged their feet on Silverado because of Bush's
presence on the institution's board and other political
connections. But regulators in Washington have said they
investigated Moroney's allegations and found them invalid. Bush has
said he never sought to use his political connections and wouldn't
have if asked.
   Former Silverado chairman Michael R. Wise and former vice
chairmen Richard K. Vandapool and Robert M. Lewis have agreed to
civil penalties stemming from their relationships to Silverado. W.
James Metz, majority stockholder in Silverado, also accepted a
lifetime ban on working for a federally insured financial
institution.
   Russell M. Murray, former executive vice president, consented,
without admitting guilt, to an order banning him from working for a
federally insured financial institution without permission from
regulators.

   The entertainment industry mourned Thursday's
death of actress Ava Gardner, the sexy Hollywood glamour queen of
the '40s and '50s whose personal life sometimes matched her femme
fatale screen roles.
   ``My heart is broken with the loss of my first love,'' said her
first husband, Mickey Rooney, after stepping off a plane in
Orlando, Fla. He was 21 when he married the 19-year-old Miss
Gardner in January 1942.
   ``The beauty and magic of Ava will forever be in all of our
hearts,'' Rooney said.
   The star of 60 motion pictures, including ``The Barefoot
Contessa'' and ``Night of the Iguana,'' died of pneumonia in
England at her home in Kensington, West London. She was 67.
   Miss Gardner and Rooney divorced in late 1943. She was also
married to bandleader Artie Shaw for a year and to Frank Sinatra
for 5{ years. Her last marriage ended in 1957.
   ``Ava was a great lady, and her loss is very painful,'' said
Sinatra, whose remarks were relayed by his Los Angeles publicist.
   Gregory Peck, her co-star in ``On the Beach'' in 1959, praised
Miss Gardner's acting.
   ``She was much better than she thought she was,'' Peck said from
his home in Beverly Hills. ``She had no vanity about her talent,
but she will stay in the minds of millions. ... She did nothing
that lowered her standards as an actress or as a lady.''
   A floral display from the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce was
placed over Miss Gardner's sidewalk star along the Hollywood Walk
of Fame.
   Miss Gardner's reputation as a sex goddess was launched in the
1946 film ``The Killers,'' which also catapulted the fledgling
career of co-star Burt Lancaster.
   ``She was a wonderful lady, wonderful lady,'' Lancaster, 77,
said from his Los Angeles home. ``I did my first picture with her.
She was a very simple lady. She used to come down to the beach with
us and cook and play with the kids.''
   ``I think she was the last great beauty,'' said Michael Winner,
who directed Miss Gardner in a horror film, ``The Sentinel,'' in
1977.
   ``She epitomized to an English lad the glitter and beauty of
Hollywood,'' Winner said in England.
   ``Ava was a great star who gave us all so many wonderful moments
on the screen,'' former President Ronald Reagan said from his
Century City office. ``She was a dear friend who Nancy and I will
miss.''
   Victoria Principal, who worked with Miss Gardner on ``The Life
and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' in 1971 and ``Earthquake'' in 1973,
said the actress influenced her career.
   ``Ava Gardner was my ideal and in many ways my role model. And
to have made two films with her was my privilege,'' Miss Principal
said from her Beverly Hills home. ``She was beautiful, talented,
spirited and uniquely her own person, and for as long as there are
films she will exist.''
   Beverly Hills attorney Paul Caruso, a longtime friend, knew Miss
Gardner as an unassuming woman who was unaffected by the Hollywood
publicity mill.
   ``She never thought she was a movie star, (she) thought she was
a lousy actress,'' Caruso said. ``She thought she was a little
country girl from North Carolina.''
   Director Joseph Mankiewicz, who directed her in ``The Barefoot
Contessa,'' praised her earnestness.
   ``If something came along she did it and she enjoyed it,''
Mankiewicz said. ``I don't think Ava ever put body and soul into
her performance. She put body and soul into living a life. That was
as happy as she wanted it to be.''
   Larry Kasha, a longtime friend of Miss Gardner who is also
co-executive producer of CBS-TV's ``Knot's Landing,'' persuaded the
actress to appear on 10 episodes of the show in 1985.
   ``She was so right for our show, a terrific addition to our
show,'' Kasha said. ``I'm very sad about the loss of a very special
lady. She was wonderful, and I think she was much more talented
than she was given credit for. She really understood what she was
doing.
   ``But the nicest thing I liked about Ava was she was a great
animal lover. She used to worry about her dog all time. She asked
me to bring my dog to the set so she could walk him and visit with
an animal. She loved animals.''
   One of Miss Gardner's sisters, 74-year-old Myra Pearce of
Winston-Salem, N.C., spoke with the actress by phone this week
because her husband, B.C. Pearce, had died.
   ``She was my sister, and I just thought she was wonderful,''
Mrs. Pearce said Thursday.

   The Rum Creek Valley was quiet Thursday
after three days of confrontation as members of the United Mine
Workers union stepped aside and allowed non-union trucks to enter a
coal processing plant.
   Five pickets had been arrested in the three days of battles with
non-union workers and federal marshals outside the Rum Creek Coal
Sales Inc. plant where the union has been on strike for six months.
Four company truck drivers also have been arrested.
   ``I think the union leadership is looking at the situation,''
said Jesse South, a chief deputy U.S. marshal. ``I don't know of
any plans they may have.''
   The union is under federal court order to refrain from blocking
the private road leading to the plant and limit the number of
pickets at the site to 15.
   ``We want to maintain the peace and try to keep the violence
down,'' said Roger Nelson, a UMW strike organizer. ``If I can clear
the men out to meet the conditions of the judge's order, we can
avoid having a repeat of yesterday.''
   Three pickets were arrested Wednesday, two for assaulting a
federal officer.
   ``We didn't have violence until yesterday when the marshals came
down here and started shoving people around,'' Nelson said. ``These
people are frustrated with the way things are being handled. That's
why we had the violence.''
   By coincidence, Thursday's calm came on the 100th anniversary of
the UMW's founding.
   Miners picketing the Rum Creek plant have blocked the road with
cars and trucks. On Monday and Tuesday, company coal trucks with
steel plates protecting their radiators plowed the vehicles out of
the way. On Wednesday, federal marshals had them towed away.
   About two dozen miners struck Rum Creek in mid-August after Rum
Creek hired a non-union contractor to run its plant in southern
West Virginia. Before then, unionized employees had worked the
plant, where coal is sorted and prepared for sale.
   The UMW was formed Jan. 25., 1890, in Columbus, Ohio, by the
merger of two rival coal miners organizations.
   Last year, its resources were strained by a 9-month strike _
tentatively settled Jan. 1 _ against the Pittston Coal Group Inc.
The tentative settlement has not yet been submitted for
ratification by the rank and file.
   UMW members staged wildcat strikes last summer to show support
for striking Pittston miners. At the height of that action, 43,000
miners in 10 states were off their jobs.
   On Jan. 16, in the first fatality linked to labor violence in
the coal fields since 1985, one union member was killed and two
others wounded in a West Virginia shootout between picketing miners
and gunmen.
   The slaying was unrelated to the Pittston strike or the actions
at Rum Creek.

   Cuba said Thursday it temporarily suspended
pulling its troops out of Angola until it gets a ``satisfactory
explanation'' for an attack by a U.S.-backed force that Cuba said
killed seven of its soldiers this week.
   A Foreign Ministry statement, quoted by the Cuban government
news agency Prensa Latina, said the UNITA attack last Sunday also
killed three Angolan soldiers. It said Cuba took its action jointly
with the Angolan government.
   The dispatch from Havana was monitored in Mexico City.
   The statement said the United States was providing expert advice
to UNITA forces, which it called ``armed terrorist bands.''
   It said Cuba will not let these bands ``attack Cuban military
personnel and sabotage the accords so laboriously worked out among
Cuba, Angola and South Africa'' to end the Angolan conflict.
   In a statement issued Thursday from their bush headquarters at
Jamba, southeast Angola, the rebels said that they did not know
Cubans were guarding the position under attack. They said Havana
failed to distribute information on its troop positions.
   Cuba called it ``a deliberate act of terrorism, with the full
knowledge that Cuban personnel were there.''
   According to a Cuban diplomat in Luanda, capital of Angola, who
spoke on condition of anonymity earlier Thursday, only Cuban
civilians and no soldiers left the country in the previous 24 hours.
   An estimated 50,000 Cuban troops supporting Marxist Angola in a
15-year civil war with the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola began a U.N.-monitored withdrawal in January
1989 under the accord signed in New York.
   About half of Cuba's forces had been withdrawn so far, per
schedule, and all were due to leave by mid-1991.
   In return, South Africa agreed to halt support for the rebels
and grant independence to Angola's southern neighbor, Namibia.
   UNITA was not a party to the New York accords but pledged not to
attack the Cubans as they withdrew.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said in
Washington the administration is making inquiries of Cuba to
clarify the situation.
   She said, ``Failure to continue the troop withdrawal in
accordance with the schedule established by the accords will call
into question the commitment of ... Cuba and ... Angola to the
search for peace in southwest Africa.''
   Assistant Secretary Herman Cohen said Thursday he would try to
speak to all sides involved in the incident in the next few days.
   Thursday's Cuban statement said five Cuban soldiers and six
Angolan soldiers also were wounded in UNITA's attack at a water
purification plant in the Hanha Valley, about 155 miles south of
Luanda, and 13 Angolan civilians were killed and 27 wounded.
   Members of the U.N. monitoring force said earlier the attack
killed four Cubans and wounded seven.
   Angola has been embroiled in civil strife since it became
independent from Portugal 15 years ago, with UNITA waging an
effective bush war against the Popular Movement for the Liberation
of Angola _ or MPLA _ the Marxist party in power.
   Cuba sent troops in 1976 to help Angola fight the UNITA
guerrillas, who were backed by the United States and South Africa.
   Cuban Politburo member Jorge Risquet said two years ago that
1,000 Cubans had died, mostly from disease, accidents and
``terrorist attacks'' rather than combat. Western estimates are
that 5,000 Cubans died in Angola and UNITA says the figure is
higher.
   There are 1,000 Soviet military advisers involved in planning
and supervising combat operations, according to Western estimates.
   The United States and the UNITA rebels have contended that
government forces launched a major offensive a month ago to try to
capture a strategic rebel stronghold.

   President Bush is refusing to rule out a
Republican plan that would ultimately make the Social Security
system private, as the battle sharpens over a Democrat's bill
slashing the retirement system's payroll tax.
   Bush told reporters Wednesday that a plan by Rep. John E.
Porter, R-Ill., and the No. 2 House Republican leader, Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, to place workers' retirement payments into
private accounts ``has some interesting ingredients to it'' and is
worthy ``of consideration, of some study.''
   But he added, ``I'm not prepared to endorse that.''
   The president cautioned that his 1991 budget proposal _ which he
unveils Monday _ will contain a different plan for addressing the
huge Social Security surpluses.

   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration took a
last-minute stand against a plan to label foods deemed safe by the
American Heart Association, but the organization says it will go
ahead anyway.
   The program, known as Heartguide, is scheduled to begin Monday.
It's an ambitious effort by the association to make consumers
smarter shoppers by identifying products low in saturated fat,
total fat, cholesterol and sodium.
   The program has been in the works for three years, but Acting
FDA Commissioner James S. Benson told the association Wednesday it
risked regulatory action if it proceeded with the plan.
   ``FDA believes that your program will increase consumer
confusion and hamper any comprehensive solution to the food
labeling program,'' Benson wrote to the group.

   Barry was in a Florida treatment center, where he had himself

<HEAD>Bolivian Cocaine Traffickers Loosen Ties to Colombian Cartels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN NOBLET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Bolivia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocaine traffickers operating in the
hinterlands of Bolivia are loosening ties to the powerful but
besieged Colombian cartels, looking upon them now as bad business
partners, anti-narcotics officials say.
   Since late August, when the Colombian government declared its
anti-drug war, the Colombian cartels have often failed to show up
for deals or make promised payments for wholesale purchases from
the Bolivians, the officials say.
   ``They are not paying up,'' Gen. Lucio Anez, commander of
Bolivia's 1,040-man anti-narcotics police force, told in an
interview here. ``They've got debts in arrears.''
   The Bolivians are doing more refining and smuggling on their
own, Anez and other officials said.
   The Colombian cartels traditionally have bought up most of
Bolivia's often crudely processed cocaine. It was shipped to cartel
laboratories for refining into pure cocaine chlorhydrate and
smuggled to the United States and other wealthy user countries.
Bolivia, a coca-growing country, supplies an estimated one-third of
the world's cocaine.
   Santa Cruz, a tropical city 355 miles east of La Paz, is a
center for trafficking and a frequent calling point for Colombian
wholesale buyers.
   With the buyers now less dependable, the Bolivians evidently are
doing more refining on their own.
   ``There is an increase in processing,'' Anez said. ``We're
seizing more (refined) drug.''
   According to statistics prepared by the U.S. Embassy in Bolivia,
2,288 pounds of refined cocaine hydrochloride were seized in 1989,
compared to just 453 pounds the previous year. Seizures of
less-refined cocaine base dropped from 2,950 pounds to 2,013 pounds.
   Anez said his forces also had detected more Bolivian cocaine
moving through alternate smuggling channels.
   ``The routes have shifted a little toward Brazil and Argentina,
in that order,'' he said.
   ``I'm not trying to say that they've stopped shipping to
Colombia,'' which remains the principal partner.
   A U.S. anti-narcotics official working in Bolivia, who spoke on
condition that he not be identified, said his office also had
received information that the Colombians were having trouble making
payments.
   ``Business has been disrupted,'' he said.
   He added that he was not sure the increased processing in
Bolivia was directly tied to the drug war in Colombia. He said it
might be a result of increased consumption of cocaine in Europe, a
market that Bolivia supplies.
   However, he expressed the belief that the disruption in
Colombian operations clearly was stinging Bolivian coca farmers.
The price for 100 pounds of coca leaf had slumped from about $85 in
August to as low as about $20 in December, he said.
   The price drop gave a dramatic boost to a program to get coca
farmers to switch to other crops. In December, a record 1,303 acres
of coca were voluntarily destroyed, according to the U.S. Embassy.
   Nonetheless, the total number of acres dedicated to coca farming
increased from 84,000 in 1985 to 130,000 last year. Coca farming is
legal in Bolivia, but processing it is not. The coca leaf has been
chewed, somewhat like tobacco, by the Bolivian Indians for
centuries.
   The United States is focusing more of its military, police and
economic aid on cracking down on processors. It plans to help the
Bolivian government build a new base, where U.S. military and
police trainers will be stationed, in the tropical lowland region
called the Beni, where scores of clandestine labs and air strips
are operating.
   The Beni base would be a launching point for raids on the labs,
using 12 Huey helicopters on loan from the U.S. military.

   The battle of the burgers is heating up in London
as restaurateurs lure diners with American fare and the salad days
of rock 'n' roll.
   The Hard Rock Cafe still appears to top the charts, but four
newcomers are hoping to unseat the progenitor of rock restaurants.
   For the first time in its 18-year history the Hard Rock, with
its well-known T-shirts and legendary lines of customers snaking
along Piccadilly, is not listed in the popular ``Good Food Guide.''
   Editor Tom Jaine refused to say why the Hard Rock was omitted
from the 1990 edition but said that generally restaurants are
dropped after a change in ownership or chef, or if patterns of
taste change.
   Hard Rock's chef of 13 years, Dermot Lehane, was lured away by
Sticky Fingers, the restaurant opened by Rolling Stones guitarist
Bill Wyman last May.
   ``I think a lot of American tourists are bored with queuing up
at the Hard Rock, and they are crazy about Sticky Fingers,'' said
manager Lorraine Angliss, in a recent interview at the restaurant
in Kensington, west London.
   ``Without a doubt our food is superior,'' Angliss said as she
picked at a bunless hamburger, explaining that she was dieting.
   Sticky Fingers, named after the Rolling Stones album, displays
250 pieces of Wyman's rock 'n' roll memorabilia, including his
certificate of honorary citizenship of Mobile, Ala.; his late
bandmate Brian Jones' green Gretsch guitar; and photos of very
young Rolling Stones surrounded by psychedelic flowers and old
covers of Beat Magazine.
   ``It's Bill's personal collection,'' Angliss said. ``He had
originally wanted to open a museum but he took it one step
further.'' Wyman himself has joked that eating is boring, and
customers need additional entertainment.
   The Rock Garden at Covent Garden, which began as a live music
club and helped discover stars such as the Police, U2 and Joe
Jackson, has also gone into the restaurant-and-memorabilia
business. But marketing man Henry Weinreich bristles at comparisons
with the Hard Rock.
   ``We're not borrowing a history. It's our history that's
happening every day. We guard it jealously,'' he said. ``If you
want to see a museum, go there. If you want to be around young
Londoners and out of a tourist trap, then come here.''
   The upstairs walls are lined with first contracts of those who
made it big: a $700 fee for two shows on Aug. 10, 1977 by Talking
Heads, and a $100 payment to Dire Straits for a Feb. 11, 1978 gig.
   The promotional material asks diners ``not to be too uncool'' if
a rock superstar sits next to them. But Paul Lyons, editor of the
Time Out restaurant guide, warns customers to have no illusions.
   ``Rock stars go to small French or Japanese restaurants,'' he
said in an interview. ``Why would they want to go to restaurants
that are pampering to the whims of a small, adolescent to early-20s
market?''
   Down the street from the Rock Garden is Lennon's, opened 13
months ago by the first wife of the late Beatle John Lennon.
Although Cynthia Lennon is no longer involved with the restaurant,
its walls feature black and white photographs of the Beatles and
other rock 'n' rollers.
   The latest entrant into rock 'n' roll dining is the Rock Island
Diner in the Piccadilly Arcade, which offers imported Hebrew
National hot dogs, flecked formica table tops and a live deejay
from New Orleans who plays 1950s rock.
   ``For the older generations this place is pure nostalgia,'' said
operations manager Catherine Trant. ``They remember going to the
hop, and for the younger generation the '50s are trendy because
it's a great era.
   ``The English are nervous about being the first to dance or
sing, but they love it as long as they're not the first. You should
see some of the people we've had shaking their tail fins here.''
   The Hard Rock Cafe reacts with confidence to its challengers.
   ``Comparisons only make us proud,'' said spokesman Nick
Wiszowaty. ``They're all trying to emulate us.''

<HEAD>Bologna, a Communist Showcase, Turns to Private Enterprise</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If cCommunists had a heaven, it might look
like Bologna.
   Orange buses glide through a huge historic district closed to
other traffic. Senior citizens take government-subsidized vacations
on the Riviera. Half the city's youngsters attend low-cost day-care
centers.
   ``The Red Disneyland,'' as the Italian press calls it, has long
been considered the showcase of communism Italian-style. So when
the government recently suggested turning city services over to
private enterprise, it left many Italians in shock.
   ``The proposal coming from Bologna is, in some measure,
revolutionary,'' columnist Miriam Mafai wrote in the national
newspaper La Repubblica.
   ``All previous ideas are being erased from the slate, not only
for the Italian Communist Party, but for all the left.''
   The proposal put forth for the northern Italian city is
considered symbolic of the new directions being pursued by the
Italy's national Communist Party, the largest in the West, as it
seeks to overcome an electoral decline and the specter of
cCommunist failure in Eastern Europe.
   ``I don't want to be reduced to a souvenir of a past era,'' said
Bologna's 45-year-old mayor, Renzo Imbeni, an energetic Marxist
with a bushy black mustache.
   ``I want to be here when the history of tomorrow is written. The
change stems from this need.''
   With a population of 417,000, Bologna is the biggest city in the
Italian ``Red Belt,'' a communist-governed region that has become
one of the country's wealthiest areas.
   After World War II, when voters turned to the party that helped
lead the anti-fascist resistance, Bologna became Italy's first
large city to elect a communist administration.
   It earned national fame for its ``do-it-all governments'' which
set up pharmacies in poor neighborhoods, paid the rent for
low-income elderly citizens and offered free bus transportation
during rush hours.
   When buildings decayed in the portico-lined historic district,
the government spent millions of dollars to restore them _ then
moved the working-class residents back in.
   To help women work, it set up a day-care system that even today
charges the equivalent of only $65 to $150 a month for children up
to 5.
   ``There is a rather high level of social protection,'' Mayor
Imbeni said in an interview in the Communal Palace, a 15th-century
building surrounded by bulletin boards featuring the communist
daily newspaper, L'Unita.
   ``But it's not written anywhere that we will be able to
guarantee this also in the future.''
   He noted that the welfare-state system had deteriorated in many
countries due to stagnant revenues, an increase in the number of
needy and a shrinking pool of young people _ all problems in
Bologna.
   ``Because of this, the choice was made ... for a requalification
and a renewal of the welfare state we have locally,'' Imbeni said.
   What Bologna is proposing to do is sell off its slaughterhouse
and 21 city pharmacies and transfer such services as the cleaning
of schools, provision of student lunches and street maintenance to
a mixed public-private concern. It also is discussing private
management of the hundreds of city-owned offices and apartments.
   The money saved would be devoted to priority areas such as the
increasing number of elderly and Third World immigrants and the
environment.
   The plan has won praise from business executives, average
citizens and the national Communist Party, which is Italy's
second-biggest party. The main critics are rival political parties,
which charge the project is merely a maneuver to win votes in
municipal elections this coming May.
   ``If it's real and concrete, this is an interesting, stunning
new initiative _ an initiative that will be taken as an example by
other city governments,'' said Gianandrea Rocco di Torrepadula,
head of the local Industrialists Association.
   ``In comparison to other cities, this one is run OK,'' said
Marco Bassi, 46, who owns a newsstand in the working-class Little
Bologna neighborhood. ``But things always go better in the private
sector.''
   Imbeni insists that the communists are not doing an about-face.
   ``People say the concept of state ownership is part of the
communist culture,'' he said. ``But for the communists of Bologna,
this isn't true. And for the Italian communists, that was years
ago.''
   Indeed, Bologna and the rest of the ``Red Belt'' are known for
their citizens' entrepreneurial spirit, illustrated by the network
of cooperatives _ most linked to the communists _ which do
everything from producing Parmesan cheese to running restaurants.
   The national Communist Party is hailing the Bologna plan an
example of its own ``new course.'' The party has long embraced
parliamentary democracy but has been kept out of the government for
four decades.
   In line with its new program, the party has called an
extraordinary congress for March to decide whether to become a new
leftist umbrella group _ and perhaps even drop the communist name
and hammer-and-sickle symbol.
   While the Bologna proposal was described as a ``revolution'' in
national newspapers, it will leave many city services intact.
   The government refuses to privatize the day-care system and the
vast bus network, although it has abolished the free rush-hour
rides.
   The low-income elderly will still have a taxi service, domestic
helpers, 32 social centers and subsidized vacations on the Italian
Riviera.
   The government will also continue to provide low-cost study
vacations for teens in England and on the French Riviera.
   ``We don't want to change because there's a black spot on the
soul of our past,'' Imbeni said. ``We must change because we want
to be here in the year 2000 ... with the name we have today or
another. I want to be here.''

<HEAD>Action Films Highlight 1990 Movie Lineup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lights! Camera! Action-adventure! That seems
to be the movie ticket for the winter and spring as the film
industry moves into 1990 with hopes of another record-breaking year.
   Comedy is king this summer, and drama plays a strong role in the
Oscar-conscious fall and holiday season. The first five months of
the year (Memorial Day is the official opening of the summer
season) brings a host of action-adventure from the major studios.
   There will be cop movies galore, and the streets of Los Angeles
will again be littered with cars demolished in high-speed chases.
Among this season's officers: Jamie Lee Curtis, Brian Dennehy,
Steven Seagal, Tom Berenger, Lou Diamond Phillips, Gene Hackman and
Dan Aykroyd.
   ``White Hunter, Black Heart'' is also likely to draw attention.
It is based on Peter Viertel's novel about an adventurous film
director (obviously John Huston) on location in Africa. It's an
offbeat role for Clint Eastwood, who also directed.
   The most eagerly awaited adventure is ``The Hunt for Red
October,'' the first of Tom Clancy's novels to be filmed. Sean
Connery stars as the Russian sub commander and Alec Baldwin is the
CIA analyst probing why the sub is approaching the eastern U.S.
seaboard.
   The police sagas include: ``Loose Cannons,'' Hackman as a
hard-boiled cop and Aykroyd as his partner, who switches
personalities under stress; ``Hard to Kill,'' Steve Seagal as a
detective who seeks revenge after seven years in a coma; ``The Last
of the Finest,'' Brian Dennehy as a suspended cop who uncovers drug
millions; ``Love at Large,'' Tom Berenger and Elizabeth Perkins as
two detectives who fall in love; ``The First Power,'' Lou Diamond
Phillips in pursuit of a serial killer; and ``Blue Steel'' with
Jamie Lee Curtis also in pursuit of a serial killer.
   Adventure of a more exotic sort will be offered with ``Mountains
of the Moon,'' about the search for the origins of the Nile by two
19th-century explorers.
   Want to be scared? Paramount Pictures is presenting ``Tales From
the Darkside: The Movie,'' with stories by Stephen King, Arthur
Canon Doyle and others. ``Roger Corman's Frankenstein Unbound''
marks Corman's first direction in 20 years. William Friedkin (``The
Exorcist'') returns to horror with ``The Guardian.''
   Robert De Niro is back in the Mafia scene in ``Good Fellas.''
Arnold Schwarznegger finds action in the year 2075 in ``Total
Recall,'' directed by Paul Verhoeven (``Robocop'').
   Among the comedies, ``I Love You to Death'' holds promise with
stars Kevin Kline, Tracey Ullman, William Hurt and River Phoenix.
The latest ``Saturday Night Live'' comic to join the movies is Dana
Carvey, the Church Lady, who plays his own gender in ``Opportunity
Knocks.'' SNL alumnus Bill Murray co-directs himself and Geena
Davis in ``Quick Change.''
   Marlon Brando resumes with the Mafia in ``The Freshman,'' as a
mobster who befriends student Matthew Broderick. Dudley Moore stars
with Daryl Hannah in ``Crazy People,'' a comedy about the ad world.
There is Southern Gothic humor in ``Daddy's Dyin' (Who's Got the
Will?)'' with Tess Harper, Beverly D`Angelo and Beau Bridges. Tom
Hanks and Meg Ryan star in a romantic comedy with the unlikely
title of ``Joe Versus the Volcano.''
   Two added attractions are ``Ernest Goes to Jail'' and ``The Gods
Must Be Crazy II.''
   The long-delayed ``The Two Jakes'' will certainly draw attention
among the dramas. It's Jack Nicholson's followup to ``Chinatown,''
also starring Harvey Keitel and Meg Tilly.
   Bette Midler revives the old Barbara Stanwyck tearjerker
``Stella Dallas'' in ``Stella.'' Hot star Kevin Costner courts
trouble in ``Revenge'' when he falls in love with the wife of a
powerful Mexican (Anthony Quinn). In ``Texasville,'' Peter
Bogdonavich traces the later history of ``The Last Picture Show''
people.
   Jane Fonda and Robert De Niro fall in love when she teaches him
to read in ``Stanley and Iris.'' Jessica Lange learns to cope with
widowhood in the big city in ``Men Don't Leave.'' Nick Nolte and
Debra Winger get involved in murder and corruption in ``Everybody
Wins.''
   More drama: Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in ``Pretty Woman'';
Gabriel Byrne and Albert Finney in ``Miller's Crossing''; a young
cast in a new version of ``Lord of the Flies.''
   The season seems to offer films for every taste; there's even a
movie about volleyball, ``Side Out.'' Except for ``The Hunt for Red
October'' and ``The Two Jakes,'' none of the films seems to have
the smell of a sure winner. But then, neither did ``Dead Poets
Society,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Look Who's Talking,''
the unlikely hits of 1989.

   Soft classical music plays from an
overhead sound system in the offices of Mind Communication Inc.,
while telephone operators take orders for the company's subliminal
self-help audio and videocassettes.
   They may be hearing Mozart, but the 40 employees are willing
guinea pigs for the company's theory that what you can't hear is
perhaps more important than what you can.
   The music masks subliminal suggestions _ inaudible messages
supposedly perceptible only to the subconscious _ motivating
employees to overcome procrastination and increase production. The
messages include ``I do it today'' and ``I take action now.''
   ``I've had it in for two weeks and I've seen a huge
difference,'' chiropractor and company president Paul Tuthill says
from his office in the Grand Rapids' suburb of Wyoming. ``The good
people have improved immensely and the people who are marginal or
shirkers quit.''
   Mind Communication, which reported sales of $3.5 million in
1989, is one of of only a few companies in the $50 million
self-help tape industry. Two competitors also are based in
Michigan: Potentials Unlimited Inc. of Grand Rapids and Midwest
Research Inc. of Walled Lake, a Detroit suburb.
   The industry's premise is that we can recognize information
presented below our threshold of awareness. Even though the
listener hears only soothing music or the sound of ocean waves on
an audio cassette or sees images of nature on a video, the
subconscious mind can detect the hundreds or thousands of
speeded-up, underlying subliminal suggestions, manufacturers say.
   Mind Communication offers about 300 titles by direct mail,
ranging from weight loss and improving sex _ two of the biggest
sellers _ to controlling spending habits and becoming a better
bowler. There are tapes designed for children to build self-esteem
or stop bedwetting.
   Subliminals have been raising eyebrows since the 1950s, when it
was reported that by flashing ``eat popcorn'' during a movie,
theater owners prompted patrons to rush for the concession stand,
unaware they had been subliminally persuaded.
   In recent years, it appears millions of consumers have brushed
aside the diabolic connotations associated with mind control and
comparisons to Big Brother while they plunk down $10 to $40 for
what manufacturers market as a shortcut for solving problems and
breaking bad habits.
   The 60-minute tapes, most of which provide a script of their
messages, are prominently displayed near self-help books in
national bookstore chains. Such publishing companies as Simon &amp;
Schuster, Random House and Bantam Books recently have devised their
own versions.
   Many respected researchers accept the validity of subliminal
perception but claim there is no proof these self-help tapes work.
   ``They're a waste of time and money,'' said Howard Shevrin, a
University of Michigan psychologist who has been involved in
subliminal research for more than 30 years. Shevrin said even if
there was a behavioral change in some people it would be impossible
to trace it to the tapes.
   Shevrin suggests the possibility of harmful side effects in some
people, a theory with which Tuthill agrees.
   ``Theoretically, they could be harmful with forced prolonged
exposure,'' Tuthill said. ``If the message is noxious or contrary
to what you want, people have actually developed some bizarre
symptoms.''
   Tuthill said he has seen a smoker develop headaches and heart
palpitations when exposed to a stop-smoking tape. The symptoms
stopped when the person stopped listening to the music. Tuthill
even puts warning labels on his weight- loss tapes because of
reports from pediatricians that children inadvertently exposed to
the tapes were losing weight.
   Barrie Konicov, owner of the 14-year-old Potentials Unlimited,
has among his 200 titles Bust Enlargement and Birth Control (``If
you create a thought that you will not get pregnant, you will not
get pregnant,'' is one message.)
   A 1981 raid by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration forced
Konicov to soften his medical claims. He stands by his tapes, 1
million to 2 million copies of which sell each year worldwide in
such bookstore chains as B. Dalton, WaldenBooks and Barnes &amp; Noble.
   ``Look, it's a $10 tape,'' he said, adding that the company
offers a money-back guarantee. ``Nobody questions what we do.''
   Though the field is largely unregulated, the Texas attorney
general's office confirmed it is investigating claims made by
several such companies.
   The use of such tapes by retailers to cut shoplifting or by
employers to increase production of unsuspecting employees has
raised ethical questions. Tuthill's biggest customers are
retailers, but he said he has turned down requests from auto
dealers and political candidates.
   While many of the companies cite self-conducted studies, little
independent research has been done in the area of self-help
subliminals. Most of the companies point to individual testimonials
as proof of their effectiveness.
   Two Canadian psychology professors who have done independent
research call the tapes a health fraud.
   Timothy Moore of York University's Glendon College in Toronto
said some of the tapes he has studied apparently contain no hidden
message at all.
   Philip Merikle of the University of Waterloo in Ontario said an
analysis of tapes made by several companies found there is no
identifiable signal on them that could penetrate the subconscious.
   He likened the amazing success stories to placebos.
   ``We've known for hundreds of years that effective treatments
are ones that people believe are going to work,'' he said. But
subliminal tapes, he concluded, ``are clearly health fraud.''
   ``It's not inconceivable that 20 to 30 percent of these people
could report real improvement, but not for the reasons used by the
manufacturers,'' he said. ``But if 25 percent of the people who
listen to these tapes stop smoking, that's great. That's also the
irony of it.''

<HEAD>Bush Poll Ratings Don't Sway Congress</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is dealing with the reconvened
Democratic Congress from a position some of his predecessors would
have used to get votes or get even. It doesn't seem to work that
way for Bush.
   Lyndon B. Johnson twisted congressional arms to gain support for
his proposals, and called it reasoning together. Ronald Reagan said
that if Congress didn't see the light, his way, he would make them
feel the heat.
   Their hardball lobbyists offered political rewards, threatened
punishments, using the popularity of their presidents and warning
that straying members might pay at the polls.
   Bush opens the 1990 campaign year with job approval ratings that
surpass the first-year standing of those predecessors and that
haven't been matched since John F. Kennedy. But so far, at least,
his personal popularity has not been convertible into lobbying
clout in Congress.
   Bush has the poll numbers, but he doesn't have the coattails
Reagan showed in his first presidential election. Reagan had
grounds to claim a mandate for major change in government, and he
had a conservative movement behind it. That gave his lieutenants a
network that could apply pressure from home districts on wavering
congressmen as the administration built its coalition of
Republicans and conservative Democrats in the House.
   Reagan also had the most saleable of issues in his first year _
the income tax cut that had been a centerpiece of his campaign.
Enacting it and pruning down the size and power of government were
his mandate.
   Bush was elected to carry on, to make it all work despite giant
budget deficits left in part because taxes were indeed cut but
government shrank little, if at all, under Reagan.
   Bush has a leftover tax cut to push, a capital gains reduction
that is likely to be passed this year. But he also is confronted
with the risk of a runaway toward the Social Security tax cut
proposed by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   His State of the Union address on Wednesday night is likely to
restate familiar proposals and priorities rather than seek new
ones, and to be coupled with a renewed call for bipartisanship.
With neither the money nor the inclination to undertake major new
programs at home, Bush is sure to emphasize successes abroad as he
keynotes the election-year congressional session.
   Seeking to head off the inevitable pressure for peace dividend
cuts in the defense budget, Bush said in advance that he will soon
present a new military plan of his own, ``to restructure America's
defenses in the wake of the dramatic changes that are taking place
abroad.''
   The defense budget he will present on Monday seeks an increase
in Pentagon spending, but Bush said it will begin ``the transition
to a restructured military, a new strategy that is more flexible,
more geared to contingencies outside of Europe while continuing to
meet our inescapable responsibility to NATO and to maintaining the
global balance.''
   Bush also will ask Congress to promote the Environmental
Protection Agency to Cabinet rank. That will be the 15th seat at
the Cabinet table.
   Overall, it is a manager's agenda, not a script for dramatic
change or a catalog of Republican issues for the campaign year.
Bush said going in that his agenda was not one of drastic change
but of building on eight years of Republican administration under
Reagan.
   The major arena of change in 1989 was outside his reach,
although it certainly worked to his benefit. The administration and
Congress could only react and respond to the largely peaceful
revolution that undid communist dominance in Eastern Europe.
   For a while, Democratic leaders criticized Bush, saying he was
too timid and too passive. But the issue didn't take.
   Republicans are trying to make Eastern Europe into a 1990 issue
on their own terms, contending their military and foreign policies
created the conditions for change.
   ``Freedom and democracy are breaking out across this entire
planet,'' Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater told party
leaders. ``I guarantee you that would not be happening today if it
were not for a decade of leadership by Ronald Reagan and George
Bush.''
   The guarantee is debatable, but there is no question that Bush
has been buoyed by those changes and by public support for his
intervention in Panama.
   For all of that, there is no sign that his current popularity
will enable the administration to move many votes, or to build a
Reagan-style coalition in Congress.
   That has more to do with the last election than with the latest
polls. In winning the White House, Bush saw his Republican ticket
lose strength in Congress. Democrats gained three seats in the
House, one in the Senate.
   A winning presidential candidate usually leads his party to
congressional gains, but Bush did not. He ran weaker than
congressional candidates in 389 of the 435 House districts.
Off-year elections historically are difficult for the president's
party. The White House party hasn't gained House seats in an off
year since 1934.

   Richard Gordon Darman is in the unenviable
position of trying to reduce an enormous federal deficit that many
say he helped create during the Reagan administration. Congress and
the nation will get a long look at Darman's handiwork on Monday,
when he lays out President Bush's first full-fledged budget
proposal.

   George Bush says he slumps into about ``60
minutes of gloom'' every time Dick Darman drops by the Oval Office.
Still, the budget director wins more presidential blessings than
most anyone, even as some people think he's as much culprit as
savior for the ill message he bears.
   Even within the administration, Darman, past servant of six
federal departments and four Republican presidents, is the White
House insider everyone loves to hate. By the half-serious account
of other Cabinet officers, he is an unreformed Scrooge, one who
arises from his nocturnal visions ready to turn, not his own, but
somebody else's leaf.
   Drug czar William Bennett put it this way last month: ``It's
that time of year. Christmas, and arm-wrestling with Dick Darman.''
   Darman, 46, is far more than George Bush's budget planner. He's
a thinker and a tinkerer, whether it's over a nickel-and-dime
change in a presidential speech or a multibillion-dollar shift in
the basic institutions of government.
   At his office, Darman, for weeks, has been honing a 1991 budget
which, by law, must reduce deficit spending in the next fiscal year
to $64 billion _ a cut of about $40 billion from the 1990 shortage,
and which, by presidential promise, can't be achieved with a tax
increase.
   Most every night, the 5-foot-9, 180-pound Darman has been
doodling. Before crawling into bed, he puts the finishing touches
on a dream scheme for himself, half letter, half diagram, with
squiggles and arrows and all sorts of code words related to the
next day's challenge. Then he props it on his nightstand, ready for
further jottings if some economic wraith strikes in his sleep.
   ``I may be crazy, but I think I get a lot of work done while I'm
sleeping,'' he has said. ``My mind ... will make linkages, and at 3
or 4 or 5 in the morning or whenever I'd naturally wake up, I've
suddenly got three or four ideas that fit right in as the logical
next bits of work.''
   The president, of course, is the final arbiter of Richard Gordon
Darman's handiwork, but, by all accounts, the budget director wins
most disputes with his Cabinet colleagues. Bennett lost hundreds of
millions in the internal debate over how much to spend on the drug
war; Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, who himself cut billions from
the Pentagon budget in the wake of the global collapse of hard-line
communist governments, lost an additional $5 billion to Darman's
arguments. Cheney wanted at least $297 billion next year; Darman
proposed $290 billion; Bush made it $292 billion.
   Darman is ``the repository of all the hard decisions,'' said
John H. Sununu, White House chief of staff. ``When you have to say
the either-or, you can't get two people to do that. You have to get
one person, and it's Dick Darman.''
   ``I've got enormous budget problems,'' Bush recently told a
group of reporters. ``I feel very strongly about it, because Darman
just walked out _ and when you see him walking out, I go through a
period of about 60 minutes of gloom before I refocus on what else
is happening out there.''
   No budget director is expected to be the life of the
presidential party. But Darman lately has been spreading woe of a
variety quite beyond that of the parent denying Junior an increase
in his allowance.
   Last summer, in a speech variously greeted as courageous or
disingenuous, Darman stood before the power-lunch crowd at the
National Press Club and decried what he called the ``Now-nowism''
abroad in the land. That word, one of several invented by Darman
over the years, he defined as the nation's self-indulgence, ``our
collective short-sightedness, our obsession with the here and now,
our reluctance to adequately address the future.'' He added: ``In
our public policy _ as, to some degree, in our private behavior _
we consume today as if there were no tomorrow.''
   Now, hold on. This, from a man who took a little stroll in the
White House parking lot nine years ago, and told then-Budget
Director David Stockman to indulge Ronald Reagan's tax cuts, even
as he agreed they would produce budgetary chaos? This, from a man
whose imprint is upon virtually every other consumption- and
debt-driving feature of Reaganomics, including the Tax Reform Act
of 1986? This, from a man, when asked last year how long the
president would abide by his no-new-taxes pledge in the face of
burgeoning debt, replied: ``As a starting position, I would say we
might as well assume forever.''
   In his book ``Triumph of Politics,'' Stockman wrote that Darman,
in their parking-lot conversation on the prospective tax cut back
in 1981, said that ``I don't know which is worse _ winning now and
fixing up the budget mess later, or losing now and facing a
political mess.'' In the end, Stockman said, Darman decided: ``We
win it now; we fix it later.''
   Later is now, and it has fallen to Darman, like nobody else, to
fix it. Few question his technical credentials. He is said to know
budget arithmetic as well as Stockman; and so far, with one notable
setback _ heading Bush's abortive drive last year for a cut in the
capital gains tax _ he has been the better salesman. And many
predict he will win the capital gains fight this year, just as he
engineered the compromise income-tax overhaul in 1986 when it
appeared that effort, too, was dead in the water.
   Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, are awaiting the 1991 budget
blueprint with some consternation. Last year, Darman drew up the
Bush ``revisions'' to Reagan's final budget submittal. While the
new administration talked a soft, cooperative line with Congress,
it resorted to a fair amount of accounting gimmickry to meet the
Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction target. Moreover, it proposed cuts
only in broad terms, leaving the onus for trimming specific
programs on Congress itself.
   Now, some fear Darman may be giving Bush more room to duck and
hide on the budget, because he has ordered a major structural
change in the way it is presented. The information that used to be
spread across seven hefty volumes has been whittled into a single
book. Darman promised no loss in specificity, but others, knowing
Darman's skills for cloaking controversy in ambiguity, are
suspicious.

   Though largely unsung, Darman was a top economic policymaker in
the Reagan adminstration, moving from the White House to the
Treasury Department as the No. 1 deputy to James A. Baker, who is
now secretary of state. He quit to join a Wall Street firm for 19
months late in the Reagan years, but Bush recalled him, this time
to the OMB post.
   Against that background, some find it startling, at the least,
that Darman should be crying wolf these days about the nation's
economic shortsightedness. Robert Greenstein, director of the
Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said he ``was a little
distressed at the columns that played Darman as a hero for having
the courage to give the (press club) speech, whereas the reality is
he's one of the principal culprits.''
   ``Look at the budget he helped create last February, the Bush
budget in which they tried to camouflage the cuts so nobody would
criticize the administration for cutting Program X and Program Y.
It was the ultimate feel-good budget, the ultimate no-guts budget.
Even Ronald Reagan had the guts to tell you what he wanted to
cut,'' Greenstein said.
   Conservative political analyst Kevin Phillips said: ``Here's
somebody whose been involved in the trade deficit, the budget
deficit, the rise of the United States as the world's leading
debtor _ all of these things were aspects of an economy of which he
was an architect. And, of course, the 1986 tax reform, which is
generally regarded as promoting consumption. And that's what ...
(Darman was) complaining about.''
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, said, ``It's a little bit like the fox in the chicken
coop yelling `There's a fox in the chicken coop.'''
   For his part, Darman acknowledges that not all his past
stratagems have been unqualified successes. ``But what is the
appropriate standard?'' he asked. ``All those programs are much
better than none.''
   He prides himself as a pragmatist and compromiser. ``I am a
long-term idealist and a short-term realist,'' he said. ``I really
like to look at what works and what's feasible.''
   ``Dick loves ... the machinations,'' said Kenneth M. Duberstein,
former Reagan administration lobbyist. ``He has this way of
focusing way ahead, seeing the obstacles, the hurdles, and figuring
how to jump them.''
   Darman compares the process of compromise to a game of pinball.
``You put a ball in play with a ballistic shot and now your world
is filled with all kinds of bumpers and random possibilities,'' he
once said. ``But the important thing is, the flippers are in your
control. It's bump and flip, bump and flip, a convoluted approach
to the goal.''
   Rarely does he take a day off, other than weekends. He routinely
gets to the White House at dawn, ready for a 7:15 a.m. meeting with
Sununu, his chief ally at the executive mansion. Baker, his former
boss in the Reagan years, is another fierce supporter.
   On a personal level, there are two Richard Darmans. One has
repeatedly charmed the Congress _ aside from the capital-gains
stumble _ and earned plaudits from the severest administration
critics. House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., talks of his
``unfailing good humor and ... easy and pleasant manner.'' Pete V.
Domenici of New Mexico, the Senate Budget Committee's senior
Republican, raves about him as ``a strategic thinker second to
none.'' The House budget chairman, Panetta, acknowledges that
``we've enjoyed each other's company.''
   He has a fast and mischievous wit, but some members of his staff
_ widely credited as the brightest within the administration _ find
him quirky, cutting and arrogant. ``How could anyone think that
way?'' he has been known to demand of aides, sometimes sending them
off in tears.
   Others, too, have found him abrasive. And Howard Baker of
Tennessee, the former Senate Republican leader and Reagan's last
chief of staff, coined an adjective _ ``Darmanesque'' _ which is
now part of Washington's lexicon. It means, said Baker, ``too
clever by half.''
   Darman, the son of a textile industrialist, was born in
Charlotte, N.C., and raised in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. He
is thoroughly a Harvard man, having earned his B.A. in 1964, and
his master's in business administration three years later. He
taught at Harvard's Graduate School of Government during the Carter
administration.
   His government service started with the Nixon administration in
1970, when he was recruited by then-Health Secretary Elliot
Richardson, his best friend to this day, and who rates Darman as
``at the top of all the bright young people I've worked with.''
When Richardson was named attorney general as the Watergate scandal
brewed, Darman followed him to the Justice Department. There, he
served on the strategy team that negotiated the felony conviction
and resignation of Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, enabling a
credible successor _ Gerald Ford _ to be sworn in before Watergate
brought Nixon down. ``It was creative problem-solving,'' said
Darman.
   In that period, Darman got what he calls his one ``pure shock''
in his government career, the famed ``Saturday Night Massacre''
that led Richardson, himself and others to resign when Nixon
ordered the attorney general to fire the Watergate prosecutor. ``So
weird,'' he told The New York Times. ``Leaving government for doing
what you think is right, like some political prisoner ... It seemed
so totally un-American, like a parody of a police state.''
   Darman returned under President Ford, when he hooked up with
Baker, then an undersecretary at the Commerce Department. Their
careers have been intertwined ever since.
   Still, Darman professes disinterest in the Washington power
chase. ``It's too easy to get caught up in the notion that this
culture tends to reinforce, that we really are as powerful as some
people choose to pretend,'' he has said.
   His wariness doubtlessly stems, in part, from the Watergate
experience. And friends say it derives, too, from the influence of
his wife and mother of his two sons, Kathleen Emmet, a cultural
historian and, reportedly, a closet critic of the administration.
The two shun the Washington social mill, preferring the quiet life
at their home in McLean, Va.
   Then to sleep, perchance to dream of pinball and yet another
convoluted path to his goal. The next ballistic shot, the 1991
budget of the United States, is due Monday.

   On the corner of Dr. David Page's desk
rests a foot-high stack of newly published genetics textbooks. They
matter-of-factly describe the location of the sex-determining
factor, the single gene that settles the question of whether a
fertilized egg will be a boy or a girl.
   The gene was Page's discovery. Its rapid rise to the status of
accepted wisdom is hardly a surprise, for when he revealed it at a
news conference, the announcement was a major event in the world of
genetics.
   Isolating the gene was a milestone in basic biology, the prize
in an exhausting race and the kind of achievement on which
distinguished careers are built, clearly a breakthrough in a field
that uses the word sparingly.
   Or so it seemed.
   The story was simple: One tiny bit of genetic code rules gender.
If we have it at the moment we are conceived, we will be male. If
not, we'll be female.
   Just two years after Page's announcement, the precise location
of the sex-determining factor is a mystery again. The gene he
found, while interesting and probably important, is almost
certainly not it.
   The case illustrates the skittish and often whimsical way
science moves. Rather than flowing forward in a neat, sane way,
facts _ and theories cobbled together to fit them _ emerge in a
jerky tango of discovery and setback. A new set of lab results can
turn breathtaking insight to smoke.
   Page is a staff scientist at the Whitehead Institute, an elite
center for genetics research across the street from Massachusetts
Institute of Technology. While still in training at MIT, he used to
smile at a cartoon on a biology professor's door: ``Theory, like
mist on eyeglasses, obscures vision.''
   Page's theory, accepted by many, is now in shambles. But it's
not the first time people have been wrong about the location of the
sex-determining factor. A decade ago, many believed it was a gene
called H-Y, and some textbooks still state this unequivocally.
   Page's quest to find the sex switch began in 1982. Like others,
he tried to track it down by a process of elimination.
   Everyone is born with 46 strings of genes called chromosomes.
Two of these, called X and Y, are the sex chromosomes. Women have
two X's, while men have an X and a Y. Scientists reason that the
gene that makes men different from women must be located someplace
on the Y.
   Page and others have concentrated on apparent exceptions to the
rule, so-called XX males. To all outward appearances, these people
are physically normal men. But their cells contain the double X's
of women. Through a genetic mix-up, one of their X's contains a
tiny fragment of Y, enough to make them men.
   Among those he studied was an XX man with just half of 1 percent
of a Y chromosome. Within this bit of DNA he found a gene that was
shared by other XX males. He postulated this was TDF,
testis-determining factor _ the sex switch.
   His description of the gene and his idea of what it did were
published in December 1987 in the journal Cell. It was a depressing
moment for Dr. Peter N. Goodfellow at the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund in London, whose team was just a few months from making the
same discovery.
   Page was almost certain he had correctly identified TDF, but
remembers feeling uneasy when colleagues flashed slides during
lectures that confidently called it that. ``You try as hard as you
can to say that something is a working hypothesis, and it gets
boiled down, even in a textbook, to established fact.''
   To be on the safe side, he named his gene ZFY, or Y-linked zinc
finger protein, a reference to the kind of chemical structure it
makes. Then he and other scientists searched for evidence that ZFY
is TDF. But when new pieces of the puzzle emerged, they didn't
quite fit.
   ``If you get something that is right, more and more things start
clicking into place,'' said Goodfellow. ``What happened with the
ZFY story is that it didn't get stronger and stronger.''
   Among the conflicting details:
   _Page knew from the start that there was a related gene on the X
chromosome. But when its structure was decoded, it was
disquietingly like ZFY. If ZFY is uniquely male, why would females
have a very similar gene?
   _All mammals have their own version of ZFY. But among the
marsupials, such as kangaroos, the gene isn't on the Y chromosome
at all; it lies on one of the non-sex chromosomes that presumably
has nothing to do with sex determination.
   _Other XX males turned up who did not carry ZFY.
   _In mouse embryos, the gene did not seem to be doing anything at
the time when sex is determined.
   _Efforts to transplant ZFY into female embryos didn't produce
male mice.
   Alone, any of these tidbits could be explained away. Maybe the
male mouse embryos weren't producing the ZFY protein because
scientists were looking for it after the gene had already turned
itself on and off. Maybe marsupials and their distant relatives
among placental mammals have simply evolved different means of sex
determination. Together, though, the tidbits raised doubts.
   ``As the data accumulated, it seemed to be more and more
puzzling how it could be the sex-determining gene,'' said Benajmin
Lewin, editor of Cell. ``That is quite a common situation. One sees
an assumption, a model is proposed, and then more data accumulate
that are not consistent with the model, and then the model breaks.''
   The breaking point for this model came with a paper in December
in the journal Nature. Goodfellow had found four XX males who
carried a bit of the Y chromosome, but not the part with ZFY on it.
He argued that somewhere in the fragment they shared was the true
sex-determining factor.
   While Page was unmoved by the earlier skepticism over ZFY,
Goodfellow's discovery was a shock. ``It hit me, sure, in part
because I did not know this was coming until it was published.'' He
could dismiss the other evidence as circumstantial, but Goodfellow
had used precisely the same line of reasoning to attack ZFY's role
as Page had used to support it.
   ``This makes it clear that ZFY is not the only sex-determining
function on the Y,'' Page said. ``It's possible that ZFY has
little, if anything, to do with sex determination.''
   Goodfellow isn't gloating. If he had found ZFY first, he said,
he would have written the paper Page wrote. ``A lot of people have
said to me, `It shows that David Page got it wrong.' Everyone likes
to see a hero fall.
   ``It's not really like that. Yes, his interpretation was
incorrect. But if you go back and look at it, he put forward what
seemed to be the best hypothesis at the time.''
   Now Goodfellow and Page are back where they were, competing to
find the sex trigger gene.
   ``I'm not in the position of wanting to stand up and crow,''
Goodfellow said. ``We are testing the most likely hypothesis. That
may be wrong, or maybe David will publish finding a gene in this
region tomorrow.''

   Human tests will begin soon on a device
that supplies oxygen to the bloodstream while removing carbon
dioxide, a sort of artificial lung that developers say could help
tens of thousands of people each year.
   The IntraVascular Oxygenator, can be used up to seven days,
satisfying as much as half the body's needs, developers say. It
isn't a lung replacement, but a life-saving boost to see a patient
through a crisis.
   ``This device does not heal the lung,'' said Dr. Terry Clemmer,
chief of critical care medicine at LDS Hospital. ``This device buys
us some time ... to create an environment more conducive to healing
the lung.''
   The IVOX, developed by Dr. J.D. Mortensen, is inserted into the
inferior vena cava, the large vein carrying blood to the heart,
through an incision in the neck or groin. A bundle of tubes in it
carries oxygen to the blood; carbon dioxide passes through fiber
walls into the tubes and out of the body. It uses new membrane
technology to provide as much oxygen as larger, external devices.
   The surface area of the human lung is roughly that of a tennis
court, said Dr. John Watson, chief of cardiovascular devices at the
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md. The IVOX
is ``nowhere near the size of a tennis court, but he's certainly
been able to squeeze a large surface area into a relatively small
device. And that's by using these hollow fibers.''
   The clinical evaluations are expected to show that a patient
suffering acute respiratory failure can be supported more safely
and at lower cost with IVOX than with current methods, Mortensen
said. In animal tests lasting up to 19 days, it didn't damage the
blood or organs in 150 sheep and dogs.
   The first phase of human tests will involve 10 patients and will
begin once they're chosen. It is intended to confirm the animal
results and IVOX's safety; a second, broader, study of its
effectiveness could begin this summer.
   In addition to LDS, medical centers in the first phase are Penn
State's Hershey Medical Center, the University of Michigan Medical
Center in Ann Arbor and the Los Angeles County-University of
Southern California Medical Center. The Hershey and LDS teams
received the first devices three weeks ago.
   IVOX was developed and manufactured at CardioPulmonics, a Salt
Lake City-based firm specializing in the development of gas
permeable membranes and specialized critical care devices.
Mortensen, CardioPulmonics chairman, had produced an earlier
version that didn't exchange enough gases.
   In September, the Food and Drug Administration approved an
investigational device exemption that cleared the way for limited
human testing; after both phases are complete, the data will be
reviewed by the FDA.
   IVOX could be used in situations where a patient is breathing
oxygen through a nasal mask or an endotracheal tube and ventilator
that aren't working well, Mortensen said. It also could help
patients recover from acute episodes of respiratory failure
resulting from inhalation of smoke or noxious agents, drugs, severe
pneumonia and scores of other ailments. He said it could help tens
of thousands of people each year.
   ``As far as its clinical benefit, that's still to be
determined,'' Watson said. ``Basically, this type of step forward
sort of opens the door.''
   Patients who would qualify during phase one must be extremely
sick, near death and require pure oxygen, Mortensen said. Most will
see benefit in two to five days, when they can change to a regular
ventilator.
   Those who don't improve would present an ethical dilemma, though
Mortensen and Clemmer maintain such cases would be unusual.
   ``If they become dependent on the device to avoid death, that is
one of my greatest fears because it's only approved for seven
days,'' Clemmer said. In a case like that, he said, hospital
officials and the patient's family would have to decide whether to
leave the patient on the device past the test period.
   Before IVOX, the only support for patients with respiratory
failure has been mechanical ventilation, in which oxygen at varying
concentrations is blown into the lung under pressure. However, the
pressure and high concentrations can damage already weakened lungs.
By reducing the time a patient is attached to a respirator,
developers say, costs and mortality can be reduced.

   Mr. Yuk, whose putrid green face has peered
from poisons for almost two decades in America, is now warning
European children.
   While the look is the same, the name has changed because
feminists in Liverpool, England, think the courtesy title is, well,
yukky.
   Yuk, plain and simple, is far more palatable.
   ``There was some sensitivity about the `Mr.' We've never had
that problem anyplace in the United States I know of,'' said
Richard Garber, director of the Institute of Education
Communications at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   The bright green sticker with the stuck-out tongue and squinting
eyes, touted as ``a face only a parent could love,'' made its
international debut in Liverpool in late October. There was some
speculation as to whether Yuk should be replaced by some other
distasteful term because Yuk is a common surname in Liverpool's
Asian community. But ethnic groups said they weren't offended.
   None of the 46 U.S. poison centers using Mr. Yuk has altered the
name. Each center's phone number encircles the sticker copyrighted
by Children's Hospital.
   Garber, a former teacher and guidance counselor who helped
create Mr. Yuk, isn't miffed over the missing ``Mr.'' ``I'd like to
keep Mr. Yuk because that's the way we started really. But Mr. Yuk
does not have to be a mister.''
   Experts say the need for Mr. Yuk _ by whatever name _ is as
great as when it was introduced in 1972 as an alternative to the
skull-and-crossbones.
   About 70 of the 130 centers that pool data got 1.3 million calls
about toxic exposures in 1988, the most recent figures available,
said Dr. William Robertson, president of the American Association
of Poison Control Centers Inc. Two-thirds involved children. In
all, the death toll was 545, 26 of them kids.
   Experts agree most poisonings occur at home and can be
prevented. The 46 centers in the Mr. Yuk program expect to
distribute 3 million sheets of stickers in 1990, free of charge, as
part of that prevention.
   ``People really don't know what a poison is,'' Garber said.
``Most people will think of a poison as something that's ugly, that
kills bugs, that cleans drains and things like that. ... The
products the kids are getting into are products used in the home
every day, attractively packaged and scented.''
   Pharmaceutical items like aspirin and cough medicine are the
main attraction for children, followed by cleaning substances,
plants, and health care and beauty products, according to Garber.
   Youngsters usually swallow such substances at mealtime, he said.
``Kids are hungry, they're thirsty, and mom is busy.''
   Mr. Yuk strips away most if not all of the appeal, according to
Robertson, and being instantly recognizable helps.
   Telephone polls in the Seattle area show more than 95 percent of
the public is familiar with Mr. Yuk, said Robertson, who serves as
medical director of the Washington Poison Network and the Seattle
Poison Center. Other warning labels _ Officer Ugh, a rattlesnake

<HEAD>Late-Talking Toddlers May Need Therapy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many toddlers who are slow to speak fail
to outgrow the problem by the time they reach age 3, suggesting
treatment should be considered to expand their vocabulary, a
scientist says.
   ``Traditional wisdom has counseled a wait-and-see attitude for 2
year olds with delayed language development,'' said Rhea Paul, an
associate professor of speech and hearing sciences at Portland
State University.
   But while some such toddlers improve spontaneously, many who
show early signs of trouble expressing themselves may experience
``long-term difficulty in language and school achievement,'' she
said.
   Paul's study involved 42 toddlers with language considered
normal, and 36 considered ``language delayed,'' producing fewer
than 10 intelligible words at 18 to 23 months, or fewer than 50
words or no two-word combinations by 24 to 34 months. Of the
2-year-olds who were ``language delayed,'' 41 percent couldn't
express themselves as well as they should have by age 3, Paul
found. And more than half of the 3-year-olds showed delays in their
ability to understand.
   Paul said slow development of language ability may be linked to
immature or underdeveloped abilities to socialize with other
children. If so, treatment by a specialist should emphasize the use
of language in daily conversation and social situations, she said.

<HEAD>Bacteria Can Detoxify Cancer-Causing Vinyl Chloride</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have isolated natural soil
bacteria that can detoxify cancer-causing vinyl chloride and
related pollutants.
   ``Our work should lead to practical biological methods for
cleansing the environment of these toxic chemicals in the near
future,'' said Charles Castro, a chemist at the University of
California, Riverside.
   Vinyl chloride, which the Environmental Protection Agency says
causes cancer, is used for making polyvinyl chloride pipes and
insulation. PVC, which isn't considered carcinogenic, also is used
in floor tiles and upholstery.
   Vinyl chloride and other related chemicals called organic
halides _ including fungus-killing EDB and DBCP _ reach the
environment as pesticides or manufacturing byproducts. EDB and DBCP
have been found to pollute groundwater in some areas.
   The bacteria isolated by Castro produce enzymes that break
chemical bonds responsible for the toxicity of vinyl chloride and
other organic halides. The breakdown products further decompose to
create non-toxic substances such as carbon dioxide, simple alcohols
and organic acids, the university said.
   Castro said his research is aimed at making it commercially
possible to use the bacteria to detoxify the pollutants. He said
research first must show exactly how and how quickly the process
works.

<HEAD>Inflamed Sinuses Can Cause Toothaches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Infected, inflamed sinuses can masquerade
as a dental problem by causing a toothache in the upper molars,
says an association of ear, nose and throat doctors.
   ``Patients should be suspicious that they have sinusitis and not
dental problems if their pain is combined with nasal discharge or
stuffiness and if the tenderness is localized in the upper jaw
area, said Dr. David W. Kennedy, of the American Academy of
Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.
   Moira DeWilde, the group's spokeswoman, said the academy decided
to publicize the problem after a staff member rushed to her dentist
in acute pain, only to find the problem was with her sinuses, not
her teeth.
   The maxillary sinus cavity above the upper jaw has membranes
that can be inflamed and swollen by infection, causing pain and
tenderness in the upper jaw and teeth. The condition, acute
sinusitis, usually happens after a cold, flu or allergy attack
causes swelling of membranes in the nose. The swelling blocks tiny
openings from the sinuses to the nose, allowing mucus to build up
in the sinuses and causing a feeling of pressure.
   Dental X-rays may not reveal sinusitis, which can be treated
with antibiotics to fight the bacterial infection and with
decongestants to reduce swelling and help the sinus drain.
Recurrent or persistent sinus infections sometimes require surgery.

   Exxon Corp. said its fourth-quarter profits
plunged more than 40 percent because of continued huge costs of
cleaning up its Alaska oil spill, which by year's end totaled
nearly $2 billion.
   Exxon said Wednesday it took a $500 million charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to cover its estimated out-of-pocket
expenses for the spill.
   That provision is on top of charges totaling $880 million in the
first and second quarters and more than $400 million in insurance

<HEAD>Exxon Takes $500 Million Charge; Fourth Qtr. Earnings Tumble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp. said the cost of cleaning up the
Alaska oil spill has reached about $2 billion and cautioned that
the final tab could climb higher still.
   The company on Wednesday reported taking a $500 million
after-tax charge for the fourth quarter to cover expenses for
cleaning some 1,000 miles of Alaska shoreline soiled when the Exxon
Valdez ran aground last March. The charge contributed to a 40
percent drop in earnings in the period.
   Previously, Exxon took charges of $880 million in the first and
second quarters for the cleanup. The company also has said it
expects to have ``in excess'' of $400 million in insurance proceeds
to help pay for the spill.
   William Randol, analyst with the investment firm First Boston
Corp., said he was surprised by the size of the latest provision.
   ``That's a lot of money,'' Randol said.
   Bernard Picchi, analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc., said the
provision might include money for environmental costs other than
the Alaska spill, as well as potential legal costs.
   ``There might be more there than meets the eye,'' Picchi said.
``If it does include any provision for lawsuits I can guarantee
they won't say it.''
   Exxon officials refused to specify in detail how the $500
million in the latest charge had been spent, but they said the
funds covered only cleanup costs and were not being set aside for
potential legal liabilities.
   ``It would be interesting to see a breakdown showing exactly
where the money went,'' said Dennis Kelso, Alaska's commissioner of
environmental conservation.
   ``They've certainly been spending a substantial amount of money
on spill response, but I don't have any way of evaluating whether
that's an accurate assessment,'' he said, referring to the $2
billion figure.
   Company spokesman Bill Smith hinted that more charges could
follow in 1990.
   ``We've spent about $2 billion on the cleanup,'' Smith said.
``This is our best judgment on what it will cost. We don't know if
it will be more.''
   Exxon halted cleanup for the winter and has said it would survey
the area after the spring thaw to determine whether additional
treatment is necessary.
   In the three months ended Dec. 31, Exxon said its net earnings
were $785 million, or 61 cents a share, down 43 percent from $1.4
billion, or $1.06 a share, in the comparable 1988 period. Revenue
rose 15 percent to $26.6 billion from $23 billion.
   The world's largest oil company said fourth-quarter earnings
would have been $1.3 billion, or $1.01 a share, if not for the
cleanup charge.
   In keeping with the industry trend, Exxon said higher crude
prices in the fourth quarter helped boost its exploration and
production earnings, while refining, marketing and chemicals
earnings declined.
   For the year, Exxon's earnings fell 28 percent to $3.8 billion,
or $2.98 a share, from $5.3 billion, or $3.95 a share, in 1988.
Revenue rose about 9 percent to $96.1 billion from $88.6 billion.
   The Alaska spill occurred last March 24, when an Exxon tanker
ran aground in Prince William Sound and spilled some 11 millions
gallons of oil.
   The nation's worst oil spill occurred last March 24 when an
Exxon tanker ran aground in Prince William Sound and spilled some
11 million gallons of crude oil. Environmentalists and government
officials criticized the company harshly, saying it responded too
slowly to contain the spill.
   ``The financial effect of the Exxon Valdez accident was clearly
the major reason for lower net income in 1989,'' Exxon Chairman
Lawrence G. Rawl said in a news release.
   Exxon said the latest spill-related provisions still do not
cover the cost of potentially damaging lawsuits that number more
than 150 so far and could take years to settle.
   The provisions also do not cover costs associated with Exxon's
latest pollution incident _ a Jan. 2 pipeline rupture that left
567,000 gallons of heating oil floating in the Arthur Kill waterway
between New York City and New Jersey. Exxon has offered to cover
the costs of environmental studies and cleanup of that spill, which
has generated lawsuits of its own, including one by the state of
New Jersey.
   Exxon said its full-year results also reflected an accounting
change that boosted earnings by $535 million in the first quarter.

<HEAD>Home Satellite Industry Continues Slow Rebound</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM DAHLBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Satellite television industry officials say
sales of home dishes are making a slow comeback four years after
signal scrambling sent the market into a tailspin.
   But with half of the nation's estimated 2.8 million dish owners
still receiving their signals through illegal decoders, officials
are planning a crackdown on piracy to try to boost their industry's
image.
   ``Piracy not only keeps some legitimate businessmen out of our
business, it keeps consumers from buying because of the stigma they
perceive,'' said Chuck Hewitt, president of Satellite Broadcasting
and Communications Association, the industry's trade group.
   ``One of the reasons we believe 1990 will be a good year is we
believe we can bring piracy under control.''
   Delegates attending the trade group's winter convention here
this week were generally upbeat over projections that some 350,000
home satellite television dishes would be sold in 1990.
   That's about even with 1988 and 1989 but well above 1986. Sales
in that year plummeted to 200,000 units from 750,000 in 1985 after
major broadcasters began to scramble their signals.
   ``We're making a gradual comeback but we don't see big growth
until 1991 or 1992,'' Hewitt said.
   Officials are pinning their growth hopes on a variety of
subscription packages now being marketed nationally that are
generally cheaper than cable television.
   Consumers with satellite receivers equipped with legitimate
descramblers _ which nearly all new systems now have _ can call
toll-free numbers and order just about any scrambled stations they
want, including pay stations such as HBO, Showtime and the Disney
Channel.
   That's in addition to some 75 other unscrambled channels that
are available free to dish owners.
   ``We are slowly overcoming the confusion among consumers about
scrambling,'' Hewitt said. ``By ordering these packages, consumers
are paying the programmers but can still get two pay services and
14 to 16 channels for under $20 a month.''
   Hewitt said his organization is starting to crack down on
illegal descramblers with investigations and legal action against
dealers who sell illegal decoders and people who use them. With as
many as half of all current dish owners using illegal devices, some
potential customers shun buying a dish because they think they will
be doing something under the table, he said.
   ``Our message is we've got a great value here already and
there's no reason not to pay for legitimate programming services,''
he said. ``We've got some people who could buy eight or nine years
of legitimate services for the money they pay for a descrambler
trying to get it illegally.''
   Although the industry touts its programming prices as lower than
cable, the average satellite system remains costly.
   Dealers at the show were hawking receiver@dish combinations
beginning at about $2,000, with some fancier systems running
several thousand dollars more.
   ``Even the basic units give you remote control and compact disc
quality sound, though,'' Hewitt said. ``And the picture quality is
better than you can get anywhere.''
   Unlike previous industry shows, this year's convention space was
40 percent rented by programming packagers, including HBO, which is
marketing its own station along with Cinemax and 20 other stations
for $21.75 a month.
   ``We don't release subscription figures, but we're very pleased
with our sales,'' said Bob Caird, an HBO vice president. ``A
considerable number of home satellite owners prefer receiving their
favorite channels in one neat package.''
   Hewitt said about 630,000 satellite dish owners nationwide now
buy programming from various sources, with total spending of about
$150 million a year.

   Chrysler Corp.'s incentives kept working in
mid-January and helped boost sales of North American-made vehicles
3.7 percent over the same period last year, the automakers say.
   The cash rebates and low-interest loans announced Dec. 15
appeared be working best on the No. 3 automaker's popular minivans
_ the Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town and Country.
   ``I think the big boost to Chrysler overall is that discount on
the Caravan and the Voyager,'' said auto analyst Charles Brady of
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York.
   A Chrysler-Plymouth dealer in Houston said Wednesday he and his
sales staff were hustling.
   ``If there was any more traffic I would die of a heart attack,''
said Alan Helfman, general manager of River Oaks Chrysler-Plymouth
of Houston.
   ``There's an incredible number of people coming through for
these Voyagers with not enough Voyagers to handle it,'' Helfman
said. ``It's just average action on the rest of the cars.''
   The effect of Chrysler's rebates was evident in the sales
numbers. Chrysler's mid-January truck sales, which include
minivans, soared 35.6 percent over the same period last year while
car sales dropped 8.8 percent.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. also offer rebates, but
to a lesser extent.
   Overall, the eight major U.S. automakers said they sold cars and
trucks at an average daily rate of 29,677 vehicles during the Jan.
11-20 period, compared with 28,619 during the same time last year.
   Car sales were even and truck sales shot up 9.4 percent.
   ``We think these (figures) were in line with expectations as
opposed with early January which we thought was abnormally high,''
said analyst Steven Girsky of PaineWebber Inc. of New York.
   For the first two selling periods of 1990, car and truck sales
were up 13.6 percent, with car sales up 12.6 percent and truck
sales up 15.1 percent.
   During mid-January, the Big Three lost ground in the North
American-made car market to cars made in ``transplants,'' or
factories owned in part or outright by Japanese companies. The Big
Three's share fell to 87.6 percent in the period from 93.1 percent
last year.
   Chrysler's combined car and truck sales were up 14.1 percent
during the mid-January period, and up 20.5 percent for the first
two selling periods combined.
   Ford reported its vehicle sales were down 6.1 percent in
mid-January, with car sales dropping 10.4 percent and truck sales
up 0.2 percent. For the first 20 days of the year, Ford's vehicle
sales were up 2.5 percent.
   GM said its mid-January car and truck sales were up 1.1 percent,
with a 5.9 percent increase in truck sales being diluted by a 1.5
percent decline in car sales. So far this year, GM's vehicle sales
are up 16 percent.

   The nation's top stock and bonds policeman
wants federal law changed to prevent savings and loans from selling
their own securities.
   ``If a customer walks in with a Social Security check, we don't
think they should be able to walk out with a junk bond,''
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard C. Breeden said.
   The comment, made Wednesday in a speech to a meeting of the
Securities Regulation Institute, referred to Irvine-based Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan Association, whose failure is expected to cost
taxpayers $2 billion.
   Lincoln is fighting a class-action lawsuit on behalf of 23,000
investors who bought now-worthless unsecured bonds of Lincoln's
parent, American Continental Corp., at Lincoln branches.
   The sale of the high-risk, high-yield junk bonds was permitted
under federal and state laws.
   But the investors, many of them elderly Californians who lost
their life savings, contend they were led to believe the bonds were
federally insured, like savings accounts.
   Breeden said allowing the sale of such bonds inside savings and
loan branches was an invitation for fraud.
   Meeting with reporters separately, Breeden said long-term
investors would be making a mistake to flee the stock market
despite its recent losses and volatility.
   He acknowledged that small investors might be scared by stories
of computer trading and ``corrections'' that now drive prices down
sharply in hours instead of days or weeks, but said they would do
well to hold on for the long haul.
   ``For the individual investors who bought securities on Jan. 1
last year and held them until Dec. 31, they had an aggregate gain
of 31 percent last year,'' Breeden said.
   ``I would think it would be a shame for people who are saving
for the long term, to buy a house or pay for a college education,
to give up a 31 percent return for a bank CD at 7 percent.''
   He made clear he was not guaranteeing the performance of any
given stock.
   Breeden also urged Congress and the Bush administration to knock
down a variety of domestic hindrances to the free flow of money,
saying that an economically deregulated Europe in 1992 would
otherwise overcome America's competitive edge as an attractive site
for investment.
   ``The Europeans are systematically removing the barriers among
their 12 nations,'' standardizing disclosure regulations, takeover
rules, banking laws, he said.
   He urged Congress to allow banks to set up affiliated securities
companies, something that is banned now under the Glass-Steagall
Act.
   Breeden also called on Congress to remove barriers to stock
market trading of ``hybrid'' securities that have elements of
futures.
   A federal court recently banned trading of a stock-index future
on the Philadelphia and American stock exchange because of
restrictions limiting such products to commodities exchanges.
Similar securities are available to investors on the London and
Toronto stock exchanges.
   At a separate session, former SEC Chairman David S. Ruder, who
presided over the SEC during two years that included the October
1987 stock market crash and the Wall Street inside trading
scandals, called for a major SEC study of wide-ranging securities
industry reforms, like one undertaken in 1962.
   ``There should be a study not only of volatility, but of
little-known problems in the industry ... and we need to assess
whether the crazy-quilt regulation we have in the U.S. over the
banking and securities industries is the right one,'' Ruder said.
   Breeden agreed that having separate regulators for stocks and
bonds, commodities and banking had led to problems in an
increasingly interconnected financial world.
   But he said there is too little time to undertake a major study
like the one in 1962, which took two years.
   ``I'd like to see Congress and the administration get on with
the task of reforming the securities market,'' he said.
   Ruder said he felt Congress would be forced to re-evaluate
scrapping the Glass-Steagall Act to allow banks to underwrite
securities.
   ``Our financial institutions are going to be at a severe
competitive disadvantage in the world if they cannot engage in
banking and securities transactions at the same time,'' he said.

<HEAD>Exxon Says It Will Not Return To Valdez In Force</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon will not set up a large base in
Valdez next spring, whether or not it decides to continue its
cleanup work on Prince William Sound shorelines blackened in the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Exxon will keep its spill headquarters in Anchorage, Otto
Harrison, head of the company's cleanup effort, said Wednesday. The
Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation is expected to do
the same, and the Coast Guard already has moved to Alaska's largest
city.
   Exxon Corp.'s fourth-quarter profits plunged more than 40
percent because of the nearly $2 billion it spent cleaning the
spill, the company announced in New York.
   In the three months ended Dec. 31, Exxon's net earnings were
$785 million, or 61 cents a share, down 43 percent from $1.4
billion, or $1.06 a share, in the same period in 1988, the company
said. Revenue rose 15 percent to $26.6 billion from $23 billion.
   Valdez City Manager Doug Griffin said Exxon's decision would
give his hard-hit port community a needed breather this summer.
   ``We kind of lost the year in some respects because of the oil
spill,'' he said.
   Exxon moved its operation from Valdez to Anchorage late last
year as the cleanup wound down. Harrison said the company
considered several factors in deciding to keep its headquarters in
Anchorage.
   ``When you take in all the locations we're looking at _ Valdez,
Seward, Cordova _ your flying conditions are better out of
Anchorage than out of Valdez,'' Harrison said.
   If the company decides to resume its cleanup in the spring, it
likely would send small teams to far-flung locations. ``Valdez is
not central to supplying that kind of operation,'' Harrison said.
   Environmental Conservation Commissioner Dennis Kelso said Exxon
talked with his agency last week about the switch to Anchorage.
   ``I don't see it as a problem for us,'' he said. ``As long as
the job gets done, that's our main concern.''
   The Exxon Valdez rammed Bligh Reef on March 24, spilling about
11 million gallons of thick crude oil that coated the sound and the
Gulf of Alaska. After a stuttering start, Exxon pressed thousands
of workers into the cleanup.
   The huge cleanup turned Valdez into a boomtown, with garbage,
sewer and housing problems. The crime rate soared, and Exxon
received several calls from people concerned about tourism and fish
processing, said company spokeswoman Christina Stevens.
   Harrison said Exxon would not be taking up much hotel or office
space this summer.
   ``We should not be providing any disruption to the citizens for
their normal business,'' he said.
   No decision has been made about the cleanup effort, Harrison
said.
   After an intensive survey in the spring, the Coast Guard will
determine what needs to be done, he said. Plans will be formulated
in March and a decision on whether to proceed with a cleanup will
be made in April.
   The cleanup, if it occurs, would not begin until May, Stevens
said.

<HEAD>Coalition Wants Feds to Keep Bovine Hormone From Public</HEAD>

   Debate over a synthetic hormone that makes
cows give more milk is heating up with a renewed demand by a group
of farm and consumer advocates to keep milk from test herds from
going into the consumer market.
   The group argues that if the Food and Drug Administration
refuses to suspend sales until the agency makes a final decision on
the drug, the agency should at least require labels on milk and
other dairy products that originate from test cows treated with
bovine growth hormone, or BGH.
   A similar request for halting distribution of milk from test
herds was made last August, but the FDA did not respond, Brian
Ahlberg of the National Farm Coalition told a news conference.
   The genetically engineered hormone is bovine somatotropin and is
usually called BST by the Agriculture Department and the chemical
companies that make it. The hormone also occurs naturally in a
cow's body.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said last week in
discussing the hormone that ``unenforceable labeling laws have been
proposed that would attempt to enforce mandatory labeling by
farmers and processors.''
   Yeutter told the Milk Industry Foundation and International Ice
Cream Association meeting in Palm Beach, Fla., that safety for
consumers, animals and environment is the ``only one criterion'' on
which the use of the hormone should hinge.
   ``Thus, BST measures up on all these counts,'' he said. ``And if
it continues to do so it should ultimately receive approval ... for
commercial use, just as should any product that the FDA deems to be
safe.''
   Jeremy Rifkin of the Foundation for Economic Trends, a longtime
critic of the synthetic growth hormone, said his organization is
preparing a petition asking the FDA for ``a full, thorough,
internal investigation'' into allegations the agency worked with
drug companies and has been hiding test results from the public.
   Rifkin said the hormone ``has no redeeming social value'' and is
bad for farmers, cows, taxpayers and ultimately, perhaps, consumer
health.
   However, during questions, coalition spokesman Ahlberg said the
group was not claiming adverse health effects from milk produced by
hormone-treated cows.
   Rifkin also accused FDA of promoting the growth hormone before
the agency has given it final clearance.
   ``This is outrageous,'' Rifkin said. ``This is activity that
should have been condemned a long time ago.''
   Rifkin said if FDA approves commercial use of the drug, his
group will seek court action to ban it.
   ``We are determined that this product will never reach the
marketplace in the United States and Europe,'' he said. ``We will
litigate, will inform consumers with the mass media, will do
whatever is necessary.''
   The FDA did not return calls for comment on Rifkin's allegation
that the agency has been actively promoting the drug prior to its
final approval.
   Speakers said they had no information from the FDA about the
extent of testing or how much milk is entering the U.S. consumer
pipeline, although Rifkin and others have said they thought the
percentage is quite small.
   They said producers include herds maintained by land-grant
universities and private farmers. The common practice is to sell
milk from test herds to local dealers, who then mix it with other
milk for distribution.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, has asked the General Accounting Office to investigate
allegations by Dr. Richard Burroughs, a fired FDA veterinarian,
that tests of the chemical were inadequate.
   Burroughs has accused the FDA of toning down criticism of
research on the hormone at the request of the chemical companies.
   The FDA has said the hormone-treated milk is safe to drink.
   The hormone is manufactured by Monsanto, Eli Lilly, Upjohn and
American Cyanamid, who have said the FDA review has been the most
thorough of any study of animal drugs. And the FDA says it has not
made any exceptions in its drug-testing standards.

   A quarterly report by the Agriculture
Department shows cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13
leading beef states totaled 9.94 million head as of Jan. 1, up 3
percent from a year ago but 2 percent fewer than two years ago.
   Increases from a year ago were reported Wednesday in California,
Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and Texas. South Dakota
was unchanged, and decreases were reported for Arizona, Idaho,
Illinois, Minnesota and Washington.
   Marketings of feed cattle for slaughter during October, November
and December totaled 5.36 million head, down 2 percent from the
same period of 1988 and 5 percent below 1987, the report said.
   Further, the placement of new cattle and calves on feed during
the fourth quarter of the year totaled 7.32 million head, up 10
percent from 1988 and 7 percent from 1987.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 5.69 million head
during January, February and March, up fractionally from last
year's first quarter but 3 percent below 1987, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of Jan.
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

   President Bush is refusing to rule out a
Republican plan that would ultimately make the Social Security
system private, as the battle sharpens over a Democrat's bill
slashing the retirement system's payroll tax.
   Bush told reporters Wednesday that a plan by Rep. John E.
Porter, R-Ill., and the No. 2 House Republican leader, Newt
Gingrich of Georgia, to place workers' retirement payments into
private accounts ``has some interesting ingredients to it'' and is
worthy ``of consideration, of some study.''
   But he added, ``I'm not prepared to endorse that.''
   The president cautioned that his 1991 budget proposal _ which he
unveils Monday _ will contain a different plan for addressing the
huge Social Security surpluses.
   But he said, ``People are concerned about Social Security, so
when you have innovative thinking of that nature, I don't want to
just gun it down. I'm not going to support it.''
   Porter and Gingrich want to gradually divert Social Security
taxes, which are paid by workers and their employers, into a sort
of mandatory Individual Retirement Account.
   As workers' IRAs grow, their claims on Social Security would
decline. When today's workers are retired _ about 50 years from
now, Porter estimated _ Social Security would be fully privatized.
   Seldom since Republican nominee Barry Goldwater's losing 1964
presidential campaign has a national GOP figure spoken publicly of
even the remote possibility of replacing Social Security with
private retirement plans.
   The Porter-Gingrich plan looms as the major GOP alternative to a
plan advanced last month by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   Moynihan, considered one of Congress' experts on Social
Security, has proposed scaling back the system's payroll tax, once
immediately and again next January.
   He has argued the surplus the Social Security system is banking
_ $66 billion this year and growing _ is cloaking the true size of
the federal deficit, rather than being banked to pay future
retirement benefits to Baby Boomers.
   Bush called Moynihan's plan ``a disguise for increased taxes
around the corner'' and a ``sleight of hand operation.'' He
referred to a separate bill proposed by Sen. Ernest Hollings,
D-S.C., that would replace the monies lost by a Social Security tax
cut with a new federal sales tax.
   Moynihan counterattacked on the Senate floor later in the day.
   ``There is no sleight of hand whatsoever,'' Moynihan replied,
``and I do not see that there was any need to make such a
characterization.''
   He also questioned Bush's characterization of the
Porter-Gingrich bill of ``innovative thinking,'' asking ``Was it
innovative thinking after 50 years of steady payments to start
dismantling Social Security? I don't think so.''
   Also on Wednesday:
   _Bush said Congress should wait to see his own proposal to
gradually take Social Security surpluses out of the federal deficit
calculation. That long-range plan, starting in 1993, would require
that a growing portion of the surplus be used to retire publicly
held debt.
   _House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he has serious
reservations about Moynihan's proposed tax cut, which would require
Congress to find an additional $55 billion for deficit reduction
this year. He said he fears that instead of raising taxes or
cutting spending to make up the loss, Congress and the president
would opt for increased borrowing.
   _Reps. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., and Richard Durbin, D-Ill.,
proposed to roll back only this year's increase in the Social
Security tax rate _ which rose from 7.51 percent to 7.65 percent of
the first $51,300 of wages. Congress then could use the rest of
this year to devise a plan for ensuring that Social Security taxes
are used solely for Social Security.

   Robust domestic sales pushed Japan's motor vehicle
production to a record high of 13,025,741 in 1989, up 2.6 percent
from the previous year, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers
Association said Thursday.
   JAMA officials attributed the surge to brisk domestic sales
totaling 7,256,669 vehicles, up 8 percent from a year earlier.
Domestic sales set a record for the eighth consecutive year.
   Exports, however, fell an estimated 3.6 percent to 5.89 million.
It was the fourth consecutive year of declining exports.
   The association is scheduled to release exact 1989 export
figures at the end of January. Overseas shipments have been
diminishing in part because many Japanese manufacturers now are
producing automobiles abroad.
   Passenger car output climbed 10.4 percent to a record 9,052,406
in 1989, while production of trucks dropped 11.5 percent to
3,931,261. Bus production dropped by 26.7 percent to 42,074.
   Strong personal spending, the removal of a commodity tax on cars
and the introduction of new models helped boost domestic sales,
JAMA officials said.

   The Energy Department is proposing holding its
nuclear weapons contractors liable for environmental fines and
other costs resulting from their own negligence.
   The proposal, announced Wednesday by Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins, marks the department's most substantial effort to improve
work at the weapons plants, which are plagued by mismanagement,
safety lapses and environmental problems.
   ``This proposal reflects my goal of safeguarding the public and
protecting the environment,'' Watkins said in a statement.
   The 17 major weapons production plants and research laboratories
are owned by the department but operated under long-term contracts
by private companies. Since the start of nuclear arms production in
the 1940s, the plant operators have enjoyed virtually complete
protection from financial liability for their mistakes.
   Federal auditors last year reported that the Energy Department
had paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in environmental fines
incurred by weapons contractors, plus related legal costs that
totaled about twice as much as the fines.
   Under the new system, contractors would have to pay fines they
could reasonably have avoided, plus legal costs. They also would be
charged for expenses resulting from damage to government property,
although not in all cases.
   The department is expected to announce soon a related proposal
for increasing the amount of bonus money that the contractors can
earn for excellent performance. That would partly offset the
increased financial liability.
   The Watkins proposal is subject to change based on comments
received during a 30-day public comment period.
   Reaction on Capitol Hill was mixed.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who sponsored legislation last year to
increase the weapons contractors' liability for environmental
violations, said in an interview Wednesday that he was not
satisfied that Watkins' proposal was tough enough.
   ``It is just full of potential loopholes and, I think, dangerous
hedging,'' Wyden said. He noted, as an example, a provision that
would set a ceiling on the amount of damages for which the
contractors would be liable.
   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., whose district includes the Rocky
Flats weapons plant, issued a statement calling the proposal ``a
real victory for common sense.'' He said it offered new hope for
improving the contractors' performance.
   ``Now their own money will be at stake, and that's a strong
incentive for contractors to do the job right,'' he said.
   Steven Wakefield, the department's general counsel, said the
weapons contractors had been briefed on the outlines of the
proposal. He said some didn't like certain provisions of the plan
but that none had threatened to quit.

<TEXT>
   Union leaders are predicting easy approval of a
three-year contract offer giving Boeing Co. engineers 9 percent
more in annual bonuses than an offer they rejected last month.
   Daniel M. Mahoney, general counsel of the Seattle Professional
Engineering Employees Association, said the leadership was
recommending acceptance after taking no position on the earlier
offer.
   ``We're all happy, the negotiators,'' Mahoney said. ``We view
this as quite an achievement.''
   Mahoney said ballots would be mailed to the 9,276 members of the
union's professional unit on Monday, with a count set for Feb. 7.
   ``We are pleased that an tentative agreement has been reached,''
said Paul Binder of Boeing.
   The settlement, which would replace a three-year contract that
expired Dec. 1, was negotiated in a 3{-hour meeting Wednesday
involving the two sides and federal mediator Ben Youtsey.
   It was the second bargaining session since a three-year offer
without any general pay raises or bonuses after the first year was
rejected on a 69 percent vote Dec. 18. A recess to review positions
on each side followed a meeting Jan. 10.
   The revised offer includes a 3 percent pay increase in the first
year and productivity bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay in the
first year, 5 percent in the second and 4 percent in the third.
   In addition, money equal to 2 percent of all salaries in the
unit is reserved for additional, selective pay increases every six
months, with the entire pool to be spent.
   In rejecting the initial offer, many engineers noted that Boeing
production workers won three years of bonuses and general wage
gains in a 48-day strike last fall.
   The company offer was increased by some $56 million after ``our
general management met with the engineering management'' and
considered ``the feedback that we received from engineers,'' Binder
said.
   Union leaders cited a survey of 100 companies by the engineering
trade magazine Design News that showed Boeing engineers generally
earned $32,000 to $35,000 after five years, one of the lowest pay
levels among the major companies covered in the report.
   Binder questioned whether the survey considered regional
variations in living costs and other factors.
   The union, which claims to be the largest representing engineers
and technicians outside the AFL-CIO, has no strike fund and has
never called a walkout. Strike authorization was rejected in the
same balloting in which the initial offer was rejected.
   The professional unit represents 15,245 engineers, scientists
and other highly educated employees, nearly all in the Seattle
area, with an average salary of $39,683.
   The 8,317 members of the union's other unit, which represents
12,796 technicians with an average salary of $28,079, voted Dec. 18
to accept a three-year contract with pay hikes of 3, 2 and 2
percent; bonuses of 10, 5 and 4 percent, and a selective pay pool
of 2 percent a year.
   Following a 48-day strike, Boeing members of the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers voted Nov. 18 to
accept a contract with pay raises of 4, 3 and 3 percent; bonuses of
10, 5 and 4 percent, and a boost in the cost of living formula from
86 percent of inflation to nearly 100 percent.
   The Machinists represent 57,800 production workers, including
43,300 in the Puget Sound area, and the strike virtually halted
work at Boeing plants in Seattle; Wichita, Kan., and Portland, Ore.

   An aggressive expansion program that for
years drained Empire of America Federal Savings Bank's profits
ultimately backfired when the state's third largest savings and
loan was placed under federal control.
   Customers were left uneasy by the government's move Wednesday to
take over financially strapped Empire and transfer control to the
Resolution Trust Corp., a federal agency created in August to
dispose of all failed savings institutions.
   ``I'm very disappointed,'' said Empire customer Jenny Plotar
outside a bank branch here. ``We've dealt with them for 40 years
and I felt so safe and secure. Now I don't.''
   But Curt Reid, an RTC official at the bank's headquarters,
stressed that it will be business as usual for depositors. ``They
can continue to deposit and write checks and, most importantly,
their money will continue to be federally insured.''
   Analysts were hopeful that the move would result in an infusion
of capital.
   ``There are many positivies,'' said Rosemarie Ligotti, a vice
president at Prescott, Ball and Turben. ``A stronger company will
come in and merge'' with Empire.
   Empire, New York's third-largest savings and loan, has been
losing millions since it swallowed up 13 failing S&amp;Ls with the
support of federal regulators. Late last year, the thrift announced
it was insolvent and asked for federal help.
   ``They've experienced losses for quite some time,'' said Robert
Albanese, senior deputy director for the New York district of the
Office of Thrift Supervision. ``At this point, we don't see any
ability for the institution to be recapitalized without government
assistance.''
   The Resolution Trust Corp. has installed a managing agent and
removed the board of directors, but the bank's officers will
remain, Albanese said.
   Empire of America has 125 branches in New York, California,
Florida, Michigan and Texas. In June 1989, it was the 12th largest
bank in the United States and the third largest in New York, with
$11.3 billion in assets, according to Sheshunoff Information
Services Inc., a Texas firm that rates banks.
   However, Albanese said that the bank's assets had dropped to
$8.8 billion at yearend. Still, he said, the thrift was among the
five largest seized by federal regulators to date. RTC has taken
control of about 280 thrifts and has disposed of more than 30
nationwide.
   The problem was Empire had tried to expand in a hurry. As it
bought these sickly S&amp;Ls between 1981 and 1986, Empire found that
the thrifts' liabilities _ which mostly consist of deposits and can
be withdrawn any time _ exceeded the value of their assets by $926
million.
   To make its accounts balance, Empire added $926 million of
``goodwill'' to its assets. In accounting, goodwill is a non-cash
asset, but it must be written off over a number of years as a
charge against the company's income. Empire found that goodwill was
draining $95 million to $110 million from its profit each year.

   Nearly 33,600 General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor
Co. workers will be laid off for at least a week in the latest
series of layoffs blamed on slow sales or too-high inventory.
   Aside from the layoffs announced Wednesday, effective in the
next five weeks at nine car and truck assembly plants, the Big
Three automakers have announced indefinite layoffs at 11 assembly
plants affecting more than 13,500 employees.
   Other layoffs in supplier and component plants are likely
because of the assembly plant shutdowns. It is difficult to track
those plants because of their numbers and the possibility that they
will continue production and build inventory despite the shutdown
of an assembly plant they supply.
   GM said Wednesday that car assembly plants in Atlanta and
Doraville, Ga.; Fairfax, Kan.; Lansing, Mich., and Linden, N.J.,
along with a van plant in Lordstown, Ohio, and a Truck &amp; Bus Group
plants in Baltimore; Shreveport, La., and Pontiac, Mich., would be
down for at least a week apiece in late January through
mid-February.
   The production cuts will affect about 27,600 workers.
   Ford said the new layoffs would involve 5,600 workers at plants
in Edison, N.J.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Louisville, Ky., and come in
addition to 5,600 layoffs previously announced for the company's
car and truck plants in Lorain, Ohio.
   Chrysler Corp. spokesman Doug Nicoll said Wednesday the No. 3
automaker had no new temporary plant closings to announce. Through
mid-February, Chrysler will temporarily idle six plants for at
least a week each, resulting in 21,600 temporary layoffs.

<HEAD>Collective Bargaining Contracts Provided Wage Increases of 3.3
Percent</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contracts settled through collective
bargaining last year provided workers average annual wage increases
of 3.3 percent over the life of the pacts, the government said
today.
   The Labor Department said 1989 was the first time since 1981
that negotiated settlements provided larger wage adjustments than
the contracts they replaced. The last time parties to 1989
settlements negotiated, usually in 1986 or 1987, average wage rate
adjustments were 2.4 percent over the contract term.
   Wage restorations in steel and other industries, as well as wage
gains for nurses, accounted for the difference, the agency said.
   Last year's 3.3 percent wage gains also were up from the 2.4
percent average wage gains contained in collective bargaining
agreements settled in 1988.
   The collective bargaining report, like the Labor Department's
broader Employment Cost Index report, showed workers in the
fast-growing service sector winning larger wage gains than
manufacturing workers. Service workers received an average of 3.5
percent hikes over the life of the contracts while manufacturing
workers received 3.2 percent raises.
   The Labor Department said the 459 collective bargaining
agreements it analyzed covered about 1.85 million workers. The
government tracks agreements covering bargaining units with at
least 1,000 workers.
   The government said 114 such contracts covering 743,000 workers
had been expired or reopened in the last quarter but had not been
settled or ratified by Dec. 31. About half of those workers are
employed in railroads.

   The stock market staged a moderate rally today,
bidding to reverse its sharp decline of the past three weeks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.66 to 2,612.16 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 2 in nationwidyPzrading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 721 up, 285 down and
419 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.49 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said several worries that had been weighing down the
market showed signs of easing today.
   Prices rose in the Japanese stock market, after a series of
recent selloffs that had unsettled other markets around the world.
   Interest rates in the U.S. government securities market,
meanwhile, backed off a bit from their abrupt rise of late. Yields
on long-term Treasury bonds dropped to the 8.38 percent-8.40
percent range, against 8.44 percent-8.45 percent at one stage on
Wednesday.
   Brokers said those developments were enough to encourage
``bargain hunting'' in many stocks that had been under selling
pressure since early this month.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up &rsqb; at 41|; Philip Morris, up &lsqb; at 38&lsqb;; American

   Georgia-Pacific Corp., currently involved in a
bitterly opposed attempt to acquire a rival paper products company,
today reported sharply higher earnings for the final quarter and
all of 1989.
   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Georgia-Pacific said net income
jumped 21.7 percent to $157 million, or $1.84 a share, from $129
million, or $1.36 a share in the year-ago period.
   Net sales, however, slipped 8 percent to $2.4 billion, from $2.6
billion in the final quarter of 1988. Declines occurred both in
Georgia-Pacific's building products and pulp and paper segments.
   For the year, net income totaled a record $661 million, up 41.5
percent from $467 million in 1988. Earnings per share amounted to
$7.42, compared with $4.76 a share in 1988.
   For the year, net sales rose 7 percent to $10.2 billion, from
$9.5 billion in 1988.
   ``Despite a substantial decrease in housing starts for the third
consecutive year, our building products segment showed strong
performance and increased operating profits,'' said Georgia-Pacific
Chairman T. Marshall Hahn.
   Demand for structural panels decreased toward the end of the
year, Hahn said.
   Georgia-Pacific launched a bid to buy out Norwalk, Conn.-based
Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. on Oct. 31. The offer, opposed by
Great Northern, now stands at $3.8 billion, or $63 a share.

   Sales of existing homes edged down in
December, bringing the 1989 total to 3.43 million units, or 4.6
percent less than the previous year's sales, a real estate trade
group reported today.
   The National Association of Realtors said December sales totaled
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.55 million units, down 1.1
percent from 3.59 million units in November.
   The Realtors attributed part of the last month's decline to
severe weather conditions in the Northeast and South and to a large
drop in the West from an extremely high November level.
   For the year, sales were down from the 1988 total of 3.59
million units which the Realtors said was the strongest year of the
decade.
   The national median price for existing single-family homes in
December was $92,500, 4.3 percent above the December 1988 median of
$88,700. The median price for the year was $93,100, also up 4.3
percent from 1988.
   The median price means that half of the homes cost more and half
less.
   Realtors President Norman D. Flynn called last year's sales
``healthy'' and said that while they declined in 1989, the decline
was from the highest resale volume since 1979.
   ``Last month's resale pace indicates a stable market,'' Flynn
said. ``With plenty of homes available at good prices, and
relatively low mortgage rates, it is really a `buyer's paradise'
right now,'' he said.
   Sales in the Northeast totaled 570,000 units on an annual basis,
down 3.4 percent from November. For the year, the resale pace was
585,000 units, 13.1 percent below that of 1988.
   The Northeast median price was $143,100 in December, up 0.1
percent from December 1988. The 1989 median price was $145,200, 1.5
percent higher than 1988.
   ``The essentially unchanged median home prices in the Northeast
reflect a continuing slump in many of the large metropolitan
areas,'' said John A. Tuccillo, NAR chief economist.
   The resale pace in the West was 600,000 units, down 6.3 percent
from November. The 1989 total was 605,000 units, 5.l8 percent below
the 1988 total. The median price in December was $135,300, 5.1
percent higher than December 1988, while for the year it was
$139,900, up 12 percent from 1988.
   Sales in the South slipped 3.5 percent in December to 1.38
million units. For 1989, resales totaled 1.31 million units, 2.9
percent below those of 1988. The median price in the South was
$83,200 in December, 6.4 percent above that of December 1988. For
the year, the median price was $84,500, 2.8 percent above 1988.
   The Midwest posted the only sales increase in December, rising
3.1 percent to 990,000 units. For the year, the total was 926,000
units, 0.3 percent below the 1988 total. The median price was
$72,100 last month, 6.5 percent above December 1988. The 1989
median price was $71,200, 4.1 percent above 1988.

   An official of the agency overseeing the
savings and loan bailout today defended it against complaints from
Democrats that it is dragging its feet in establishing a program to
provide housing to poor people.
   ``The (Resolution Trust Corp.) is moving forward to quickly
develop a program,'' said Stephen S. Allen, director of the
agency's low income housing.
   However, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House
Banking Committee, said earlier testimony from Allen's superiors
``did not demonstrate a commitment to making lower income occupancy
of these properties a reality.''
   In bailout legislation enacted in August, Congress instructed
the RTC to give poor people and low-income housing groups a 90-day
right of first refusal on low-priced housing the government is
inheriting from failed S&amp;Ls. The law gives the agency the option of
cutting the price on the property, but the RTC is not doing that
for now.
   Allen acknowledged that only 700 properties are being offered
initially in the low-income housing program, out of a total of more
than 26,000 residential properties.
   However, he said about 10,000 properties eventually will be
moved into the low-income program, with most of them, 5,174, in
Texas; 968 in Oklahoma; and 881 in Louisiana.
   Republicans on the panel said the housing program could increase
the cost of the bailout to taxpayers. The properties should be sold
as soon as possible to reduce carrying costs, they said.
   ``We can't tell the RTC that time is of the essence ... and then
hamstring them. ... We have to keep focused on cleaning up the mess
in the S&amp;L industry,'' said Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis.
   Meanwhile, in testimony Wednesday, a top regulator edged closer
to admitting what private analysts have been saying for months _
that President Bush's $50 billion savings and loan bailout doesn't
provide enough money.
   L. William Seidman, nicknamed the bailout czar for his dual role
as chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the RTC,
stopped just short of acknowledging taxpayers need to make a second
installment on the cleanup.
   ``Someone will be back to ask for more money one of these days.
I think that's a high probability,'' Seidman said.
   Panel members reacted with dismay, but Seidman assured them the
crunch would likely come after congressional elections this
November.
   Seidman resisted several efforts to pin him down to a new loss
estimate, but figures in his testimony suggest losses in the range
of $74 billion to $82 billion.
   As of Jan. 16, the RTC had seized 333 institutions with assets
totaling $136 billion. The loss on those is about $42 billion, he
said. The remaining $8 billion would be enough to cover the losses
at additional S&amp;Ls with assets of $40 billion.
   However, the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision
is predicting the failure of another 225 to 295 institutions, with
assets of $160 billion to $200 billion. And, Seidman said his
agency found ``no reason to question'' that estimate.
   If the S&amp;Ls yet to fail have losses in the 20 percent range _
the level in the most recent thrift takeovers _ total thrift losses
would be at least 50 percent higher than the $50 billion provided
in legislation enacted in August.
   ``The thought of more dollars having to be spent on the S&amp;L mess
sends shudders down the spine of every congressman,'' said Rep.
Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   Seidman replied, ``Probably the shivers will be there. Maybe we
can get them past the election.''
   His assessment was the most pessimistic yet from a government
official. A day earlier, Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson
conceded it was possible that $50 billion is inadequate, but said
it was too soon to know for certain.
   On another subject, Seidman defended his agency from charges it
is moving too slowly. It has disposed of only 40 S&amp;Ls since August.
He said the cumbersome bureaucracy created by the bailout bill
``guarantees a slower process.''
   Employees of Seidman's FDIC, an independent regulatory agency,
are doing the bailout work. However, the policy and pursestrings of
the bailout are controlled by an administration oversight board
headed by the treasury secretary.
   ``Where does the buck stop in this process? ... It's almost
impossible to tell,'' Seidman said.
   Daniel Kearney, president of the oversight board, disputed that.
``We're certainly not slowing down the resolution process. ...
Seidman has a free hand on that except for funding and we've given
him the funding,'' he said in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>New York Partnership Files Reorganization Plan for AI</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investment firm Japonica Partners has made
a second takeover offer for Allegheny International Inc. as the
small appliance maker struggles to emerge from bankruptcy
protection.
   New York-based Japonica wrapped its proposal into a formal
reorganization plan filed late Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
just before today's hearing on Allegheny International's proposal
for emerging from Chapter 11 protection.
   Japonica issued only sketchy details of its latest plan, which
it said would involve a $650 million, all-cash deal that is about
$34 million lower than one it proposed in November. The offer
includes a $120 million cash infusion and $375 million in bank
financing.
   Allegheny International, based in Pittsburgh and known for its
Sunbeam and Oster small appliances, sought protection from
creditors in February 1988.
   Robert Sable, lead attorney for AI's bondholders and other
unsecured creditors, hadn't seen the plan but said he suspected it
is loaded with conditions.
   ``As far as my committee is concerned, there's only one plan on
the table, the company's,'' Sable said.
   A Japonica spokesman conceded the group's financing hinges on a
condition that caused one of AI's previous reorganization plans to
collapse.
   Japonica also said it would pay holders of AI's publicly held
securities premiums of 25 to 75 percent more than current market
prices, amounts it said top the payouts called for in AI's plan.
   AI has proposed repaying virtually all of its creditors other
than trade suppliers in new stock.
   AI spokesman Edward M. Romanoff said the company had no comment
on the offer.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
extending the previous session's losses amid concerns about the
slow pace of export sales.
   Analysts said one reason for the slack foreign demand was a lull
in buying by the Soviet Union, where ports are jammed with nearly 3
million metric tons of imported grain because of a shortage of
unloanding and distribution equipment.
   Forecasts for wetter-than-normal weather across the United
States next week also prompted selling of grain futures.
   The wheat and soybean markets posted the greatest early losses.
Corn futures were off fractionally.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1} cents lower
with March at $3.89} a bushel; corn was { cent to 1{ cents lower
with March at $2.40 a bushel; oats were } cent to 1 cent lower with
March at $1.38\ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 1} cents lower
with March at $5.64} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The live cattle market defied
predictions for a lower opening based on Wednesday's quarterly
Agriculture Department cattle-on-feed report, which showed
fewer-than-expected marketings of cattle off of feedlots during the
last three months of 1989.
   Live cattle futures were .05 cent to .72 cent higher with
February at 79.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .43 cent higher with January at 84.47 cents a pound; live hogs
were .10 cent lower to .15 cent higher with February at 49.30 cents

with February at 55.15 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Wednesday.

   Union Carbide Corp. on Thursday reported a
71 percent plunge in fourth-quarter net income partly because of
shutdown and personnel costs resulting from the restructuring of
its industrial gas subsidiary.
   The company said net income totaled $47 million, or 33 cents per
share, in the final quater, which included a $56 million after-tax
charge associated with the restructuring. That compared with
profits of $161 million, or $1.17 per share, for the same period in
1988.
   Fourth-quarter results in 1988 included a $58 million charge for
the $470 million settlement to the India government for the 1984
Bhopal gas leak.
   Net sales for the fourth quarter of 1989 totaled $2.08 billion,
down 3 percent from $2.14 billion in the last quarter of 1988.
   Union Carbide said $45 million of the charge taken last year
covered facility shutdown costs as well as severance and relocation
benefits paid to employees. The company said it undertook the
restructuring to reduce overhead and operating costs and make its
industrial gas component more competitive.
   The company said $11 million of the charge was associated with
costs incurred in realigning its core business and subsidiaries and
in restructuring a carbon products facility in Canada.
   For the full year, Union Carbide's net income dropped 13
percent, from $662 million or $4.66 per share, in 1988 to $573
million or $4.07 per share.
   Sales for the year rose 5 percent, from $8.32 billion in 1988 to
$8.74 billion last year.

   A U.S. division of Dutch electronics giant
Philips NV said today it will join a joint venture of NBC-TV and
the American arm of France's largest electronics company to
research advanced television systems.
   Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc., the U.S. operation of Thomson
SA of France, and Philips Consumer Electronics Co. announced the
joint venture at a news conference at NBC headquarters.
   The venture eventually is intended to lead to a high-definition
television system, which would provide picture quality vastly
improved from today's best sets.
   ``We want U.S. consumers to have access to advanced TV services
as quickly as possible,'' said J. Peter Bingham, vice president of
technology for Philips Consumer Electronics.
   Philips, which makes the Magnavox, Sylvania and Philco brands,
has said it is working on an improved television system called
High-Definition System for North America.
   NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co., has been
cooperating with Thomson at the David Sarnoff Research Center in
Princeton, N.J., to develop advanced television systems.
   NBC and Thomson, which owns the former GE and RCA television
lines, are working on a system called Advanced Compatible TV, which
would provide an improved picture on TV sets being developed by
Thomson while allowing continued use of conventional sets.
   Advanced Compatible TV would require only minor, low-cost
adjustments to equipment at local TV stations, Thomson and NBC said.
   Last April, NBC and Thomson tested the system during a news show
on NBC's New York station, WNBC. The improved picture was viewed by
reporters and others on a special TV set at the non-profit Sarnoff
center. NBC said it was the first commercial broadcast of an
improved TV signal.
   But development of the true HDTV system would require a
reallocation of broadcasting signals by the Federal Communications
Commission because it would use two channels to broadcast both the
HDTV signal and a signal compatible with convention TV sets, said
James Tietjen, president of the Sarnoff Center.
   Several Japanese companies are working on HDTV systems of their
own. In addition, Zenith Electronics Corp., the last major U.S. TV
manufacturer, has joined with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. to
develop an HDTV system.
   Like the NBC-Thomson system, Zenith's system would provide full
HDTV pictures while remaining compatible with conventional TV sets,
although these existing sets would not receive an improved picture,
said Zenith spokesman John Taylor.
   Thomson in 1987 traded its medical equipment business and cash
for the GE and RCA television lines plus the rest of General
Electric's consumer electronics businesses.

<HEAD>HP Offers Extra Money As Early Retirement Incentive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hewlett-Packard Co. will offer about
2,400 longtime workers early retirement incentives.
   ``We're offering this ... as part of HP's continuing efforts to
balance the work force and to slow the growth of expenses,''
President and Chief Executive John A. Young said in a statement
Wednesday.
   Hewlett-Packard estimated that 800 to 1,000 of its 60,000
employees in the United States will take advantage of the voluntary
program, which will be available to workers at least 55 years old
and with 15 or more years with the company.
   About 780 employees chose early retirement after the computer
and scientific instrument maker offered a similar program in 1986.
   Employees can start signing up for the program starting Feb. 1,
and participants will retire on or before March 30.
   HP, which expects no significant growth in its worldwide
workforce of 95,000 in 1990, said it also is retraining and
reassigning some of its workers.
   ``The redeployment of employees is necessary because of
manufacturing efficiencies, plant consolidations and widely
differing growth rates among HP's broad product lines,'' Young said.

   More than $17 million is being provided by the
Agriculture Department this year to help improve water quality in
specified watershed areas in 36 states and Puerto Rico, Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced today.
   Yeutter told a Senate Agriculture Committee hearing the areas
were selected from recommendations submitted by USDA and several
other federal agencies, including the Environmental Protection
Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and U.S.
Geological Survey.
   A number of other projects also are on tap, he said, including
eight additional projects ``to demonstrate farmers' willingness to
adopt newly developed conservation measures'' to more effectively
manage the use of fertilizers and pesticides, which can be sources
of water pollution.
   ``Other assistance will be targeted to regional programs that
address multi-state water quality problems, such as the Great
Lakes, Puget Sound, the Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay and the
Tennessee River,'' Yeutter said.
   The $17 million in assistance will be provided cooperatively by
several USDA agencies, he said.
   About $7 million will be in the form of cost-sharing of
improvements such as animal waste-control facilities, sod
waterways, water management systems and integrated crop management.
The Extension Service will provide $4.55 million in education
assistance; the Soil Conservation Service, $5.36 million in
technical assistance; and the Economic Research Service, $150,000
for evaluation of projects.
   The hydrological units, or watershed areas, were chosen
primarily from those identified in assessment reports prepared by
states in response to requirements of the Water Quality Act of
1987. The areas are:
   Alabama _ Sand Mountain-Lake Guntersville.
   Arizona _ Casa Grande-Coolidge.
   Arkansas _ Moore's Creek.
   California _ Westside San Joaquin Valley.
   Connecticut _ Housatonic River.

   The stock market was mixed today, attracting
only spotty support after its sharp decline of the past three weeks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 205.65 points from
Jan. 2 through Wednesday's close, slipped another 5.63 to 2,598.87
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 741 up, 563 down and
476 unchanged.
   Analysts said several worries that had been weighing down the
market showed signs of easing today.
   Prices rose in the Japanese stock market, after a series of
recent selloffs that had unsettled other markets around the world.
   Interest rates in the U.S. government securities market,
meanwhile, backed off a bit from their abrupt rise of late. Yields
on long-term Treasury bonds dropped to the 8.38 percent-8.40
percent range, against 8.44 percent-8.45 percent at one stage on
Wednesday.
   But brokers said that apparently wasn't enough to allay fears
that the risks were increasing of a persistent slump in economic
growth and corporate profits.
   DuPont ranked among the volume leaders, down 2 at 37&rsqb;. On
Wednesday the company reported fourth-quarter earnings of 71 cents
a share, barely topping the 70 cents a share it posted for the
comparable period a year earlier.
   Procter &amp; Gamble, which also posted virtually flat quarterly
profits, slipped | to 65|.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up | at 41~; Philip Morris, up \ at 38\, and American
Express, up &lsqb; at 30}.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.15 to 182.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .79 at 355.46.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 75.99 million shares at
noontime, down from 111.98 million at the same point Wednesday.

   Texas Air Corp.'s stock lost nearly 16 percent of
its value the same day a large portfolio manager revealed it had
sold its investors' interest in the nation's largest airline
company.
   Loomis Sayles &amp; Co., an investment firm based in Boston, on
Wednesday sold off its stake in Texas Air, the parent of Eastern
Airlines and Continental Airlines. Last summer, Loomis Sayles
controlled 12.3 percent of the company.
   ``I sold every share I owned,'' said Ken Heebner, Loomis Sayles'
portfolio manager. ``If I had other airlines, I would have sold
them.'' He said airline stocks no longer seem attractive.
   Some 6.67 million shares _ nearly 17 percent of the 40 million
Texas Air shares outstanding _ changed hands Wednesday, making it
the most actively traded issue on the American Stock Exchange.
   Texas Air stock dropped 1&rsqb; to close at 7&rsqb;. Last August, when
Loomis Sayles revealed its Texas Air holdings, the stock was
trading at $18 a share.
   Texas Air spokesman Art Kent declined to comment on Wednesday's
action.
   Officials of Eastern were scheduled to meet with the airline's
major creditors today in New York to present a revised
reorganization plan for the carrier, according to sources close to
the situation. Miami-based Eastern has been rebuilding under
bankruptcy court supervision since last spring, when it was hit by
a strike by its three unions.
   Heebner would not say how much Texas Air stock Loomis Sayles
sold Wednesday or how much it paid for its stake, which once
exceeded 4.9 million shares.
   When Loomis Sayles began buying up the company's stock last
summer, Heebner said he thought at the time that Texas Air would
begin making money in 1990.
   But Heebner has revised his estimates and now expects the
company will continue to lose money for another year and a half to
two years.
   Texas Air has not yet reported its fourth-quarter results.
   But Heebner did not blame Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo for
his decision to sell the stock. Instead, Heebner called Lorenzo a
``courageous man.''
   Loomis Sayles is owned by New England Mutual Life Insurance Co.
With offices in 10 U.S. cities, the company has about $20 billion
in assets under management.

<HEAD>UAL Unions Propose Buying 75 Percent Of Stock</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: UPDATES with earnings, trims, no pickup</NOTE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s board of directors has a new option
to consider: a proposal by its three unionized employee groups for
workers to buy 75 percent of the airline company's stock and leave
the rest in public hands.
   Meanwhile, UAL today reported a 67 percent plunge in
fourth-quarter profit and 71 percent drop in annual net income.
   United Airlines' pilots, flight attendants and Machinists
outlined their employee stock ownership proposal in a letter
Wednesday to parent company UAL's board, which is meeting today.
   The letter offered few details of the plan. Nevertheless, the
development marks a distinct change in attitude on the part of the
Machinists union, whose opposition to employee ownership and
increased corporate debt helped scuttle a pilot-management bid for
the company last year.
   And it offers a chance for resolution of the 6-month-old
cliffhanger that has preoccupied United, the nation's
second-largest commercial carrier, while rival American Airlines
steadily has strengthened its industry-leading position.
   ``We are unified as never before in our view that majority
ownership of the company is the only acceptable means to resolve
the issues that plague United,'' concluded the group's letter.
   The proposal also drew a positive response from a major UAL
shareholder that had been pushing for a recapitalizatin to boost
the stock price.
   The group's letter was signed by John F. Peterpaul, vice
president of the Machinists union; Frederick C. Dubinsky, chairman
of the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association and Diana
Robertson, president of the United chapter of the Association of
Flight Attendants.
   The union leaders said they were prepared to negotiate as a
group for the acquisition of stock by all UAL employees, including
non-union workers, through one or more employee stock ownership
plans or ESOPs.
   They offered wage concessions and long-term contracts in return.
   An ESOP typically buys stock with borrowed money and pays it
back over a number of years with dividends on the shares.
   The letter contained no details on how the employees proposed to
structure or finance the purchase of 17 million of UAL's 22.6
million shares, or what price the workers would pay. The plan would
cost about $2.7 billion at Wednesday's closing stock price of
$161.50.
   Nor did the letter describe how the stock would be divided among
the four employee groups. Union leaders did not return telephone
calls seeking such details.
   ``All we have here is a statement that the unions are agreeing
between themselves that they want to own United,'' said airlines
analyst Samuel Buttrick of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   ``The apparent concordance among the unions ... is a positive,''
Buttrick said, ``but the notable lack of specifics on structure and
financing indicates that only minimal progress has been made on an
ultimate resolution.''
   Separately, UAL said net income totaled $6.8 million, or 31
cents a share for the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with
$20.9 million, or 97 cents a share, for the same period of 1988.
Revenue totaled $2.4 billion, up from $2.2 billion in 1988.
   For all of 1989, UAL reported net income of $324.2 million, or
$14.96 per share on revenue of $9.8 billion, compared with profits
of $1.1 billion, or $37.87 per share on revenue of $9 billion in
1988.
   UAL said 1988 earnings included a $393 million pre-tax gain from
the partial sale of its Covia automated reservations system and a
$523.9 million gain from the January 1988 sale of Westin Hotel Co.
   In the fourth quarter, expenses of $60 million related to last
year's failed buyout bid were partially offset by a $40.7 million
gain from stock appreciation rights also keyed to the buyout
attempt. These items combined depressed fourth quarter earnings by
$11.6 million.
   A 34 percent increase in jet fuel expenses also depressed
earnings, UAL said.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf called the results ``disappointing''
even without buyout related effects.
   At today's board meeting, UAL directors had been scheduled to
consider a recapitalization urged on the Chicago-based company by
the Coniston Partners investment group, holder of an 11.8 percent
stake.
   But in an interview Wednesday evening, Coniston principal Keith
Gollust praised the ESOP proposal as ``a giant step forward'' and
said he and his partners were backing away from their insistence on
a recapitalization to boost the value of UAL shares.
   He said a recapitalization, which likely would involve new
borrowing by UAL to make a payout to shareholders, ``ought to
remain as a backup alternative.''
   UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins declined comment on the ESOP proposal.
   In return for a majority stake in the company, the employees
said they were prepared to make ``significant investments,''
including accepting lower wages, and sign five-year contracts.

<HEAD>SCI Television Says Bondholder Group Reps Back Revised Debt
Exchange Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   SCI Television Inc. said Thursday
representatives of two major bondholder groups that own most of its
$507 million in outstanding publicly traded bonds have agreed to
support a revised exchange offer for the securities.
   The privately held company, which owns six television stations,
has been negotiating with its public bondholders over the exchange
offer since it was proposed last October after the company ran into
problems repaying its debts.
   The company is controlled by media entrepreneur George N.
Gillett Jr. A group led by the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. is a major equity holder.
   Under terms of the revised exchange offer, public bondholders
would end up with a 39 percent equity stake in the company.
Gillett's 54 percent stake would be reduced to 41 percent and the
Kohlberg Kravis-led group's stake would be cut to 15 percent from
46 percent.
   Banks, which have $650 million in outstanding loans to SCI,
would get a 5 percent equity stake under the exchange offer.
   SCI said in a statement that the bondholder reprsentatives
agreed on certain technical modifications to the exchange offer at
a meeting Wednesday.
   As a result, SCI said the representatives would unanimously
recommend to their groups that they tender all bonds under SCI's
exchange offer.
   The offer was to have expired at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, but SCI
said it was extending the expiration until 12:01 a.m. Thursday.
   The offer requires that at least 95 percent of each of three
public debt issues be tendered.
   Three holders of a small amount of SCI bonds have asked a
federal bankruptcy court to force SCI to liquidate, and SCI has
asked that the request be denied. SCI said a hearing that had been
scheduled for Thursday in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware has
been postponed until next Tuesday.

   Existing home sales, dragged down by high
interest rates, slumped 4.6 percent last year, to the lowest level
since 1985, but were rebounding as the year ended, a real estate
trade group reported Thursday.
   Sales of existing homes totaled 3.43 million units, compared
with 3.59 million in 1988, the strongest year of the decade,
according to the National Association of Realtors. They reached
3.21 million in 1985 after rising from the 1982 recession-year
total of 1.99 million.
   Sales ended the year totalling a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.55 million units in December, down 1.1 percent from the
previous month partly because of severe weather over much of the
country, the association said.
   Nevertheless, the organization's chief economist, John A.
Tuccillo, said that, ``last year, existing home sales totaled
nearly 3.5 million units, which would be the fourth consecutive
year in which home sales reached or exceeded that level.''
   ``With the gradual decline in interest rates expected in 1990,
we should continue to see a healthy market this year,'' he added.
   Home sales had plummeted by midyear as the housing industry was
hammered by high mortgage interest rates forged by tight credit as
the Federal Reserve sought to slow the economy and contain
inflation.
   Sales, which had reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.55 million units last January, plummeted to 3.21 million in May.
   But the central bank began at midyear to gradually allow rates
to drop and the pace of housing sales began to pick up.
   Despite the overall 1989 sales decline, association president
Norman D. Flynn described last year's pace as ``healthy,'' and
said, ``Last month's resale pace indicates a stable market.''
   The 1989 median price of an existing home was $93,100, up 4.3
percent from 1988. The median in December was $92,500. The median
price means half of the homes cost more, half less.
   Despite the severe weather, the Midwest posted the only sales
increase in December, rising 3.1 percent to 990,000 units at an
annual rate. For the year, the total was 926,000 units, 0.3 percent
below the 1988 total.
   Tuccillo called the December improvement a signal that the
market in the Midwest is turning around and ``is expected to
continue growing in the 1990s.''
   Sales in the Northeast totaled 570,000 units on an annual basis,
down 3.4 percent from November. For the year, the resale pace was
585,000 units, 13.1 percent below that of 1988.
   The resale pace in the West was 600,000 units, down 6.3 percent
from an eight-month high in November. The 1989 total was 605,000
units, 5.18 percent below the 1988 total.
   Sales in the South slipped 3.5 percent in December to 1.38
million units. For 1989, resales totaled 1.31 million units, 2.9
percent below those of 1988.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration says a
House report recommending a criminal probe into the firings of
Chicago air-traffic controllers was ``seriously flawed'' and
repeated allegations already resolved by the courts.
   The FAA's comments, contained in a document filed with a federal
workers' board, are the agency's first formal response since
members of Congress accused officials of lying and doctoring time
sheets to justify the 1981 firings.
   ``Many of the report's findings are premised upon conjecture,
theory or speculation,'' the FAA said, referring to a report
released by a House Public Works and Transportation subcommittee in
September.
   ``The report does not contain new ... evidence regarding the
reliability of the timekeeping records and its conclusions are
seriously flawed,'' the agency said in the document, which was
obtained Wednesday.
   Lawmakers spent three years investigating how FAA officials at
the Chicago Air Route Traffic Control Center in Aurora, Ill.,
prepared to defend the firings before the Merit Systems Protection
Board.
   In their report, lawmakers concluded that attendance records
were in such poor condition that officials decided to create
documents to bolster the case against controllers who joined a
nationwide strike.
   The report also said FAA officials may have committed perjury
during appearances before the merit board, which considers appeals
from fired federal workers.
   Armed with the subcommittee's report, attorneys for the
controllers are now asking the board to overturn the firings.
   But the FAA cites several reasons why the board should not
reopen the case:
   _The allegations are not new. The agency said the board in 1985
and a federal appeals court in 1987 upheld the dismissals after
considering similar complaints about time sheets.
   _The board cannot reopen a case that has been decided in court.
   _The subcommittee made errors and its report should not be
considered.
   ``The report not only ignored significant evidence and sworn
testimony, but revealed a significant misunderstanding as to the
... procedures which were used in the removal process,'' the FAA
said.
   FAA officials acknowledged that some records had been amended,
but maintained the changes were made to ensure accuracy, not to
cheat controllers.
   There was no ``scheme to alter and manufacture evidence which
did not exist at the time of the strike and which was not prepared
in the ordinary course of business,'' the FAA said.
   Scot Imus, staff director of the Public Works and Transportation
investigations subcommittee, was not immediately available for
comment Thursday, an aide said.
   During their investigation, members of the subcommittee said
they were not judging the merits of the 1981 strike, which led to
the firings of approximately 450 controllers in Chicago and
thousands more across the country.
   Rather, they said they were concerned with the actions of FAA
officials who were defending the firings before the MSPB.
   The subcommittee sent its report to the Justice Department,
suggesting possible criminal misconduct. Prosecutors, however, have
asked the Transportation Department inspector general to review the
findings.

<HEAD>Cable Group Says `Free TV' Ads Are Misleading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable TV executives are seeing red over a
promotional campaign that tells viewers ``free TV'' may one day be
a thing of the past.
   The executives asking the Better Business Bureau to look into
the series of 30-second ads, running this month on televisions
stations nationwide, that show future generations of youngsters
expressing amazement that TV programs once could be had without
paying a subscription fee, a cable TV official said Wednesday.
   In one ad, a little girl stands next to a blank TV screen at her
grandmother's house, turning the knobs in a vain attempt to get the
set to work.
   ``Grandma, how come we can't watch TV at your house?'' the girl
finally says as the message ``sometime in the future'' slips onto
the screen.
   ``Honey, I just can't afford the programs,'' her grandmother
answers.
   ``Dad said when he was a little boy, TV was free. Is that true?''
   ``It sure was. Back in the 1990s we watched free TV all the
time.''
   In another of the ads, which are being produced and distributed
to TV stations by the National Association of Broadcasters, a
little girl and her grandfather discuss a ``rabbit ears'' TV
antenna shown in a vintage 1990 picture in an old photo album.
   ``Rabbit ears?'' she asks.
   ``Yeah, TV was free then. Me and your dad watched movies, local
news, the Super Bowl right off the air,'' the grandfather says.
   An announcer ends the segment with: ``Free TV should never be
just a memory. Call this station for more information.''
   Cable TV executives say viewers are being duped. Broadcast
television is not free, they argue, claiming that consumers
eventually get soaked for the $27 billion that U.S. businesses
spend on TV advertising each year.
   ``That's a little bit like telling people that all the rides at
Disneyland are `free,''' Community Antenna Television Association
President Stephen Effros said in a complaining letter this week to
the Better Business Bureau. ``The rides may be free, but you have
to pay to get into the park.''
   Effros, in his letter to Ronald Smithies, vice president of the
bureau's national advertising division in New York, said the ads
are false and misleading and are ``attempting to lull American
consumers into the belief that they don't pay a dime for all of
those `free' programs on their television sets.''
   He said the cost of TV advertising simply is passed on to
consumers to the tune of about $298 per TV household _ ``whether we
watch `free TV' or not.''
   NAB spokesman Walt Wurfel on Wednesday said Effros was
``ignoring a number of studies over the years that make it clear
that advertising is a service to consumers that adds competition
and helps them make the wisest buy and tends to hold costs down.''
   Smithies said his office, if it determines that the cable group
is raising a legitimate truth and accuracy question, will contact
NAB officials and ask them to substantiate their ``free TV''
campaign claims.
   Negotiations then would take place, he said, in hopes that
either the cable group will accept the ads as truthful or the
broadcasters will change the ads.
   The BBB, which published the conclusions of its investigations,
has no legal enforcement power, Smithies said.

   Stock prices rose modestly in dull trading on
London's Stock Exchange Thursday.
   Shares raced higher at the outset on scattered bargain-hunting
and mild optimism over performances on international stock markets.
   But a sluggish start on Wall Street spoiled the enthusiasm,
dealers said. At the close of the London session, the Dow Jones
industrial average had advanced just 3.16 points to 2,607.66.
   Trading slowed during the afternoon as many brokerage firms
closed early because of a windstorm that swept through the city.
   At London's close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was up 11.3 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,289.9 points.
   The Financial Times 30-share index rose 6.9 points to close at
1,835.5. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 8.11 points to
1,251.49 at the close.
   Volume came to a moderate 462.2 million shares, compared with
531.1 million shares Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Cosmetics heir Ronald S. Lauder and
U.S. Ambassador Mark Palmer on Thursday announced the founding of a
Central European investment company formed to take advantage of the
lifting of the Iron Curtain.
   The Central European Development Corp., made up of U.S. and
Canadian investors, bought a 50 percent interest in the Hungarian
General Banking and Trust Company Ltd. for $10 million, a company
release said.
   Lauder, the son of Estee Lauder and a Republican outsider in
last year's New York mayoral race, is the chairman of the new
venture. Palmer, the ambassador to Hungary, will serve as president
and chief executive officer.
   Palmer plans to resign from the State Department and end his
diplomatic career following Hungarian general elections in late
March, the release said.
   Lauder, a former U.S. ambassador to Vienna, said the company
would initially concentrate on business opportunities in Hungary
and Czechoslovakia.
   Company headquarters, now at Lauder's New York City office, will
be moved to Budapest in the future.

<HEAD>Writers and Directors Reach Creative Rights Accord</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Hollywood labor unions reached a creative
rights accord that gives script writers input into the movie-making
process and television directors a bigger role in TV series.
   ``We believe this cooperative venture will enhance the creative
input of both writers and directors,'' Writers Guild of America
executive director Brian Walton said Wednesday.
   ``It portends a new beginning,'' said Glenn Gumpel, Directors
Guild of America executive director. ``I think if directors and
writers work together, you're going to see from a creative
standpoint the emergence of another interesting base in the
community.''
   Directors and writers have long been at odds over the issue of
creative control of movies and TV shows. In the movie-making
process, the director has long been creative king, while in
television the producer, usually a WGA member, reigns.
   The plan calls for the guilds to avoid confrontation on the
creative rights issue during bargaining and to create a joint
committee that would develop guidelines governing the roles in
creativity areas. The plan asks the guilds not to interfere in each
others' creative authority in collective bargaining proposals but
for each side to review them prior to submission.
   DGA president Arthur Hiller said collaboration will lead the
guilds toward ``fulfilling our creative destinies.''
   ``This will make creative bargaining easier. We've had
conflicting claims to various creative rights,'' said J. Nicholas
Counter, president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers, which represents major studios.

<HEAD>Phillips Reports Fourth-Qtr Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. reported a net
loss of $255 million in the fourth quarter, due largely to a $280
million after-tax charge for its offshore California investments,
the company said Thursday.
   The write-down amounted to a loss of $1.04 a share in the final
quarter of 1989, the company said.
   For the same period a year earlier Phillips had net income of
$135 million, or 55 cents a share. Revenue totaled $3.03 billion,
up about 6 percent from $2.86 billion a year ago.
   For the year, Phillips' net income plunged 66 percent to $219
million, or 90 cents a share, from $650 million, or $2.72 a share,
in 1988. Revenue totaled $12.49 billion, up 9 percent from $11.49
billion.
   Phillips Chairman C. J. Silas attributed the fourth-quarter loss
and the decline in yearly earnings mainly to the $280 million
writedown for ``protracted delays in gaining regulatory approval to
begin production of the Point Arguello field'' off the southern
California coast.
   Texaco Inc. and Chevron Corp. also have recently taken
write-downs on the Point Arguello field.
   Silas said lower refining and marketing earnings stemming from
higher crude oil costs and an Oct. 23 explosion that destroyed its
Houston Chemical Complex also had a negative impact on the
company's results.
   The explosion, which killed 23 workers and injured more than 100
others, destroyed the company's U.S. polyethylene capacity.
   Silas said chemicals earnings also declined in the fourth
quarter and Phillips paid a $50 million deductible for its business
interruption insurance.
   In keeping with the industry trend, the company's exploration
and production businesses posted higher earnings for the fourth
quarter due to higher crude prices.

   Procter &amp; Gamble Co. said Thursday its
second-quarter earnings rose by 8 percent to $350 million from $325
million in the same 1988 period.
   The laundry, cleaning and food products manufacturer said
earnings for the quarter ended Dec. 31 were 98 cents per share, up
from 96 cents the previous year.
   Worldwide sales totaled $6.02 billion, up 14 percent from $5.27

   The quarterly earnings included a $91 million gain from the
previously announced sale of the Crush soft drink business, and a
$174 million charge to form a reserve to finish consolidating some
worldwide manufacturing operations.
   For the six months ended Dec. 31, P&amp;G reported earnings of $914

   Worldwide net sales for the six months were $11.7 billion, up 11
percent from last year's $10.5 billion.
   The cost of the consolidations reserve was offset almost
entirely by revenue from sale of the Crush business and from
settlement of litigation P&amp;G filed to protect its Duncan Hines
cookie business.
   P&amp;G said it accounted for its Nov. 30 merger with Noxell Corp.
as a pooling of interests and included Noxell's results beginning

<HEAD>Wheat, Soybean Futures Down Sharply On Slack Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices of wheat and soybeans fell sharply
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a late selloff linked to
improving crop weather and slack demand for feed grains both
domestically and abroad.
   Corn and oat futures also closed lower.
   A flurry of grain and soybean buying late last year and earlier
this month has filled delivery pipelines, resulting in a demand
lull.
   Ports in the Soviet Union are reportedly jammed with nearly 3
million metric tons of imported grain waiting to be unloaded
   In the wheat market in particular, ``the chance for doing any
significant business is limited and we're in a liquidating
market,'' said Jerry Zusel, manager of trading floor operations for
the brokerage Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Meanwhile, a change this month to warmer weather patterns in the
United States and Europe has eased feed-grain consumption, while
recent precipitation in the nation's midsection has raised soil
moisture levels in winter wheat areas and replenished water
supplies in the Corn Belt.
   At the same time, rains in the South American soybean belt have
gotten the crop there off to a good start, analysts said.
   At the close of trading, wheat futures were 2\ cents to 6{ cents
lower with the contract for delivery in March at $3.85 a bushel;
corn was 1\ cents to 2{ cents lower with March at $2.39\ a bushel;

<HEAD>Investors Seen Dumping U.S. Securities for Japanese Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAYTON NAFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising interest rates have made Japan's government
bonds ``the most attractive paper on earth'' at the moment, but
forecasts of a mass exodus of funds from U.S. investments may be
overblown, some experts say.
   World markets were unnerved this week when a U.S. offering of
bonds to finance the savings and loan bailout did not attract the
usual active interest among the Japanese.
   That incited fears in the United States because the Japanese
have been eager buyers of U.S. government securities over the last
several years, helping to finance the federal budget deficit and
hold down interest rates.
   One broker, Joan Anway of W.I. Carr's Tokyo office, proclaimed
Japanese bonds the world's most attractive, but others say the
factors adding to their allure could be temporary.
   U.S. analysts pinned the rise in Japanese interest rates to
inflation fears in Japan, where the rate more than doubled last
year to 2.5 percent and where workers are seeking wage increases of
6 perent.
   For Japanese investors, the ability to obtain a high return
without risk ``is bound to be remarkably attractive,'' said Seiichi
Kaneko, manager of research in the international asset management
division of Asahi Mutual Life.
   The yield on benchmark 10-year Japanese government bonds was
quoted at 6.57 percent Thursday compared to about 8.40 percent for
a similar U.S. Treasury issue. The Japanese bond is up from about
5.5 percent at the start of the year.
   Although the gap between the rates offered on U.S. and Japanese
securities is definitely narrowing, Kaneko predicted there would
not be ``any massive exodus of money from the U.S. over the course
of the year.''
   He said stock portfolio managers may liquidate some U.S.
holdings to take profits and offset recent losses in the Tokyo
stock market. But after the new Japanese fiscal year begins April
1, Kaneko expects managers to reinvest in the United States.
   An indication of the extent to which Japanese investors are
fleeing the United States will come from the U.S. Treasury
Department's next refunding auction in early February.
   Kozo Nogami, manager of international securities investment for
the largest Japanese insurer, Nippon Life, said his firm still has
a ``strong interest'' in U.S. Treasury bonds.
   Nogami said Nippon Life stayed out of Tuesday's bond auction to
finance the savings and loan bailout only because ``the term was 40
years, too long for us.''
   ``We haven't sold any U.S. bonds lately ... and we'll continue
to buy,'' he said.
   But Nogami added that with Japanese interest rates rising,
``Japanese bonds are fairly attractive,'' especially since they
carry no currency exchange risk for Japanese investors.
   The central bank has raised its official discount rate _ the
interest it charges commercial banks _ three times since last May,
bringing it to 4.25 percent from 2.5 percent, in moves aimed at
bolstering the yen and heading off inflation.
   In turn, the yield of government bonds, calculated on the basis
of price plus interest rate in secondary trading, has shot up.
   But world market turmoil and the political climate at home have
kept Japanese funds from being repatriated in large sums, said
Richard C. Koo, senior economist at the Nomura Research Institute,
an arm of the Nomura Securities Co.
   Money leaving U.S. stocks and bonds appears to have been parked
abroad, leaving the yen vulnerable in the short run, he said.
   ``The markets are in such a mess that very few people are
tempted to move funds home,'' Koo said.
   He said that after Japan holds elections next month and if the
stock market settles down, the foreign exchange market will
respond, strengthening the yen. Still, broker Anway believes funds
already are flowing out of the United States into Japan.
   ``If people weren't buying yen to get out of the U.S., the
dollar would be at 165 (yen) right now. That's where it should be
if everyone is really nervous about Eastern Europe,'' she said.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo Thursday at 145.30 yen, indicating no
strong demand for dollars, which investors need to make U.S.
investments.
   American analysts said that if Japanese investors do move money
from the United States back home, they may not be tempted to
re-enter the U.S. market immediately.
   ``If they're going to leave because of the interest rate
differential it could be difficult for them to come back without
our rates moving higher,'' said Kevin Flanagan, a money market
economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.

<HEAD>Administration Showing a More Aggressive Stand on Antitrust</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Gillette Co., a household name in the
shaving business, said it would acquire part of the Wilkinson Sword
blade and razor line last month, it looked like a good deal.
   Too good, if you ask the Bush administration.
   Gillette already had an estimated 64 percent of the U.S. blade
and razor market, and the company's plan to take over Wilkinson's
1.8 percent share set off alarms in the Justice Department's
antitrust division _ alarms that were largely muffled during the
Reagan years.
   Analysts expect more bells to sound. A year into George Bush's
presidency, they say there are signs the government is taking a
more aggressive stance on enforcing antitrust rules than the
laissez-faire approach of the Reagan administration.
   ``I am clear in my mind that the Bush administration will be
less lenient, less lax in merger enforcement,'' said Robert
Pitofsky, a Georgetown University law professor who described the
Reagan administration as ``more lenient about merger policy than
anyone has been since the late 1930s.''
   Lawrence J. White, a New York University professor who was chief
economist in the Justice Department's antitrust division during
Ronald Reagan's first term, agreed: ``I just have a sense both from
the rhetoric and the actions (of Bush administration officials)
that a tougher line is being taken.''
   The rhetoric White referred to was in the form of statements by
James Rill, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division and
Janet Steiger, who chairs the Federal Trade Commission.
   Rill, in one of first declarations of Bush administration
antitrust policy, said last November, ``The fact is that antitrust
is critical to the well-being of the American economy, and plays a
vital role in the governing process.''
   Meanwhile, Ms. Steiger, who appeared with Rill at a Harvard
University lawyers conference, said the FTC would be more vigilant
in examining proposed mergers than it was during the Reagan
administration.
   Rill's division is now challenging Gillette's plan to buy
Wilkinson's blade and razor business outside of Europe on the
grounds the deal would reduce competition in this country. It has
asked both companies to submit information and documents about the
planned acquisition by Jan. 29.
   But not all observers believe there's been a big change in
government policy under Bush.
   ``Put the noise aside, there's nothing substantive,'' said Sam
Pelzman, an economics professor at the University of Chicago
Graduate School of Business. However, he added, ``You hear that
it's toughening up. It's probably a signal.''
   Pitofsky, who was an FTC commissioner during the Carter
administration, predicted that under Bush there would be ``far more
investigations of mergers than was the case a few years ago ...
(and) challenges to the kinds of cases that sailed through'' the
Reagan administration.
   The shift in policy comes as no surprise _ in fact, it was
anticipated in 1988, the year that takeover activity reached its
peak. Analysts said then that many corporate acquirers wanted to
get their deals done before the more permissive Reagan
administration left office.
   The changed takeover environment, with mergers and acquisitions
slowed considerably by a virtual halt in junk-bond financing, may
also make it easy for the administration to appear more activist.
   But it's not just heavily leveraged buyouts that the Bush
administration is looking at.
   White, the NYU professor, pointed to the Justice Department's
opposition last spring to Eastern Airlines' plan to sell gates at
Philadelphia International Airport and some of its routes to USAir,
which already had a large presence in the Philadelphia market.
   He also noted the department had scotched plans by Delta Air
Lines and American Airlines to merge their computer reservation
systems.
   ``It would have been a tougher call'' for the Reagan
administration to make, White said.
   The professors predicted that as time goes on, the new attitude
will become even more apparent.
   ``It takes some time for a change of policy to work itself
through the pipeline,'' said Pitofsky. But he added, ``Most lawyers
who work in this field believe that the rules are going to be
tightened.''

<HEAD>Unisys Profit Down; Blumenthal Retiring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unisys Corp. said Thursday that W. Michael
Blumenthal, its chairman and chief executive officer, will retire
in April to join the investment banking firm Lazard Freres &amp; Co. as
a limited partner.
   Blumenthal, 64, will remain chairman of the Unisys board, the
company said.
   Meeting in Detroit, the company's board of directors chose
President James A. Unruh, 48, to assume the additional duties of
chief executive officer after Blumenthal's retirement.
   ``After almost two decades of managing major industrial
companies and 10 years at Burroughs and Unisys, the times has come
for my long-planned retirement,'' Blumenthal said in a statement.
   Blumenthal, who engineered Burroughs Corp.'s 1986 takeover of
Sperry Corp. to form Unisys, was treasury secretary in the Carter
administration. He indicated last year he planned to retire shortly.
   At New York-based Lazard Freres, Blumenthal will serve as
co-chairman of a new international investment group, his statement
said.
   Unisys also announced its fourth-quarter profit fell 84 percent
as a weak U.S. market offset strong international business growth
and previously announced layoffs took a toll.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company reported net
income of $34 million, or 5 cents per fully diluted common share,
compared with $218 million, or $1.05 a share, in the same quarter
of 1988.
   Revenue for the fourth quarter totaled $2.97 billion, up 2
percent from $2.91 billion a year earlier.
   Decreases in defense business and U.S. commercial computer
orders offset double-digit growth in international orders, Unisys
said from its headquarters here. The U.S. business was hurt
temporarily by a $230 million restructuring, charged against
third-quarter earnings, that included the layoff of about 8,000
employees and consolidation of factories, the company said.
   But the restructuring helped the company return to profitability
and a positive cash flow from operations after a $648.2 million
loss in the third quarter, Unisys said.
   For all of 1989, Unisys reported a loss of $639.3 million, or
$4.71 a share. In 1988, the company reported a profit of $680.6
million, or $3.27 per share.
   Revenue for the year rose 2 percent to $10.10 billion from $9.94
billion.
   Unisys said inventories were cut $216 million during the quarter
to $1.8 billion, bringing the year's reduction to $723 million. The
company had set a goal of reducing inventories by $500 million
after they rose $628 million in 1988 to $2.5 billion.
   ``We are encouraged by the very early results from our
fundamental cost structure initiatives,'' Blumenthal said in a
statement. ``Our program is on schedule. Benefits are expected to
accelerate gradually with the full impact to be realized in the
latter part of this year.''
   Unisys will seek to reduce debt by $600 million to $800 million
in 1990, in part through the sale of non-strategic and idle assets,
Blumenthal said.
   ``Overall, 1989 was a difficult and disappointing year,'' he
said. ``We believe we have made progress against problems unique to
Unisys, such as the high inventory position entering 1989. And we
moved decisively to adapt to the rapidly emerging new economic
model for the industry in the 1990s. These actions will facilitate
additional progress in the implementation of our strategic plans.''

in which 256,151 cars and light trucks were produced, the trade
journal said.
   U.S. automakers were scheduled to make 120,820 cars this week,
compared with 83,560 a week ago and 161,350 in the same week in
1988.
   Light truck production for the week was scheduled at 75,585,
compared with last week's 51,967 and last year's 94,801.
   Canadian automakers were to build 19,740 cars this week, up from
13,090 a week ago and down from last year's 20,792.
   Canadian light truck production was scheduled at 16,624,
compared with 16,624 a week ago and 13,464 in the same week last

   The race to develop high-definition television
heated up Thursday with the announcement that the U.S. divisions of
two European electronics giants have joined NBC-TV to research
advanced TV systems.
   Philips Consumer Electronics Co. said it will join an existing
research venture of Thomson Consumer Electronics Inc. and NBC.
Philips is part of NV Philips of the Netherlands, while Thomson is
the U.S. division of Thomson SA of France.
   The venture faces stiff competition from research efforts under
way in Japan and Europe into high-definition television, which
promises picture quality as crisp as photographs and crystal-clear
sound.
   In addition, Zenith Electronics Corp., the last major TV
manufacturer in the United States, has joined American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co. to develop a HDTV system.
   The new three-way alliance of Philips, Thomson and NBC drew
praise from several industry observers.
   ``I think it's a fairly wise, competitive decision,'' said Pat
Hill Hubbard, a vice president of the American Electronics
Association. ``Research is very costly in this field.''
   Laura J. Lederman, an analyst with the Chicago investment firm
Duff &amp; Phelps Inc., said the combination of manufacturers and
broadcasters was critical.
   ``If you have companies that build a set but you don't have
broadcasters you're missing some of the pieces,'' she said.
   Together, Philips and Thomson control almost 40 percent of the
U.S. television-set market. Philips makes the Magnavox, Sylvania,
Philco and Philips brands, while Thomson owns the former General
Electric and RCA lines.
   NBC, which is owned by General Electric Co., has been
cooperating with Thomson for several years at the David Sarnoff
Research Center in Princeton, N.J., to develop advanced television
systems.
   NBC and Thomson are working on a system called Advanced
Compatible TV, which would provide an improved picture on new
wide-screen TV sets while allowing continued use of conventional
sets.
   Advanced Compatible TV would require only minor, low-cost
adjustments to equipment at local TV stations, Thomson and NBC said.
   Philips on Thursday endorsed the Advanced Compatible TV system.
   ``We want U.S. consumers to have access to advanced TV services
as quickly as possible,'' J. Peter Bingham, vice president of
technology for Philips Consumer Electronics, said at a news
conference at NBC's headquarters.
   Philips has been working on its own improved-TV systems in this
country, and said it would merge its efforts with those of NBC and
Thomson.
   The consortium, which invited other companies to join its
effort, said it hoped to have the advanced TV system operating and
the sets on sale by 1993. The companies said they expected the sets
would sell for $500 to $1,000.
   At the same time, the consortium said it will pursue a true
high-definition TV system, which would provide even sharper
pictures.
   The HDTV system being considered would require a reallocation of
broadcasting signals by the Federal Communications Commission since
it would use the blank channels that now separate the channels in
use in any one area.
   The system would transmit an HDTV signal on one channel and a
conventional signal on a second channel to meet an FCC requirement
than any HDTV system not make conventional sets obsolete.
   Ms. Hubbard, of the American Electronics Association, said the
trade group was pleased that the consortium joins three companies
``who are trying to keep the technology base in this country.''
   Asked whether Zenith would consider joining the consortium,
spokesman John Taylor said, ``We're very pleased with the progress
that we have been making in the development of our own system.''
   Each of the groups developing high-definition TV systems in the
United States hopes its version is picked as the nation's standard
by the FCC, which is scheduled to start testing proposed systems
soon.
   In addition to their U.S. venture, Thomson and Philips are
involved in a European government-industry consortium to develop
HDTV there.
   Japan has been researching HDTV for more than two decades and is
considered by many experts to have the lead.
   Some experts say the nation that wins the HDTV race will have an
enormous advantage in the broader electronics market.

<HEAD>Money Funds Rose $1.64 Billion in Latest Week, Fourth Consecutive
Record</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Interest rate figures reported by Donoghue's Money Fund
Report are for week ended Tuesday. All other figures are for the
week ended Wednesday.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 490 money market mutual
funds climbed $1.64 billion in the latest week to a record high for
the fourth consecutive week, the Investment Company Institute said
Thursday.
   The rise to $383.07 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday followed a revised $5.61 billion increase in the funds'
assets to a revised $381.44 billion the previous week, according to
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   The institute had reported last week that assets had risen $5.29
billion to what was then a record $381.11 billion.
   Over the past four weeks, money fund assets have climbed more
than $17 billion as investors have evidently sought a refuge from
declining prices in the stock market. The pace of the increases has
slowed, however.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 243 general purpose funds rose $1.16 billion to $128.08
billion and assets of 98 broker-dealer funds increased $771.8
million to $162.58 billion. But it said assets of 149 institutional
funds slipped $294.2 million to $92.41 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.70 percent from 7.74 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield also fell to 7.83 percent from 7.88
percent, Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
41 days, up from 38 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts held
steady at 6.32 percent as of Wednesday, unchanged from a week
earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, also was unchanged from the previous week at 5.07
percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.87
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 7.93 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 7.92
percent; 7.91 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 7.89 percent; and
7.93 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 7.91 percent.

<HEAD>Slack Demand And Wetter Weather Pummel Wheat, Soybean Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices sank to four-month lows Thursday and
soybean futures reached their lowest levels since mid-October in a
sell-off linked to wetter weather and slack demand for feed grains
both domestically and abroad.
   Corn and oat futures also retreated in active trading on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures rose; sugar futures were
up sharply; pork bellies soared while livestock futures were mixed;
and precious metals were mixed.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents to 6 cents lower with the contract
for delivery in March down 6 cents at $3.85{ a bushel, the lowest
settlement of a near-month wheat contract since Sept. 20.
   Soybeans ended 7{ cents to 8\ cents lower with March down 7} at
$5.58\ a bushel, the lowest daily settlement for near-month
soybeans since Oct. 17.
   Corn futures settled 1\ cents to 2\ cents lower with March at
$2.39\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to 2 cents lower with March at
$1.37 a bushel.
   A flurry of grain and soybean buying late last year and early
this month has filled delivery pipelines, resulting in a demand
lull, analysts said.
   Ports in the Soviet Union, for example, are reportedly jammed
with nearly 3 million metric tons of imported grain waiting to be
unloaded.
   In the wheat market in particular, ``the chance for doing any
significant business is limited and we're in a liquidating
market,'' said Jerry Zusel, manager of exchange floor operations
with the brokerage firm Balfour Maclaine Corp.
   Meanwhile, a change this month to warmer weather patterns in the
United States and Europe has eased feed-grain consumption, while
recent precipitation in the nation's midsection has raised soil
moisture levels in winter wheat areas and replenished water
supplies in the Corn Belt.
   At the same time, rains in the South American soybean belt have
gotten the crop there off to a good start, analysts said.
   Petroleum futures finished mostly higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, supported by a strong cash market for crude
oil and worries that a ferocious storm in Britain could disrupt
North Sea oil production as it moves offshore.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures climbed 38 cents to 65
cents with February settling at $22.24 a barrel; heating oil
futures were .05 cent lower to .33 cent higher with February at
59.77 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.22 cents to 1.5 cents
higher with February at 60.60 cents a gallon.
   Sugar futures surged on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange amid rumors of Soviet sugar purchases on the world market.
Further buying was sparked by the Brazilian government's estimate
of Brazilian sugar production for the 1989-90 crop year at 6.9
million tons, down from 8 million a year earlier.
   Sugar futures settled .31 cent to .43 cent higher with March at
15.16 cents a pound.
   Pork belly futures finished sharply higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, strongly supported by Wednesday's monthly
Agriculture Department cold storage report showing lower supplies
of frozen bellies than the market had expected.
   Cattle futures were mixed with strong cash markets offsetting a
bearish quarterly USDA cattle-on-feed report, which was also
released on Wednesday.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent lower to .80 cent higher with
February at 79.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent lower
to .25 cent higher with January at 84.50 cents a pound; live hogs
were .28 cent lower to .15 cent higher with February at 49.25 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .37 cent to 1.25 cents higher
with February at 56.10 cents a pound.
   Gold futures slipped on New York's Commodity Exchange after two
days of sharp gains. Silver futures also retreated.
   Gold settled $1.40 to $1.70 lower with February at $416.30 a
troy ounce; silver was .3 cent to 1.2 cents lower with March at
$5.253 a troy ounce.

<TEXT>
   An investment group led by the former head of
Macmillan Inc. said Thursday it had agreed to acquire the assets of
International Thomson Transport Press Inc., which publishes
material for the shipping, rail and trucking industries.
   K-III Holdings LP, which is headed by former Macmillan chairman
Edward P. Evans, declined to disclose terms of the proposed
transaction.
   Thomson Transport Press is a New York-based subsidiary of the
publishing giant Thomson Corp., which is based in Toronto.
   Charles G. McCurdy, executive vice president of K-III Holdings
and the former chief financial officer at Macmillan, said the
purchase is ``part of our continuing program to build the K-III
group of companies through acquisitions and product development.''
   He said the deal is expected to be completed in February.
   K-III Holdings was formed last February in association with the
investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. to acquire and manage
publishing businesses.
   Last summer, K-III made its first acquisitions, paying $310
million for Interterc Publishing Corp., a publisher of trade
magazines and technical books, and Macmillan Books Clubs, a direct
marketing operation.
   Evans had headed a Macmillan management group backed by Kohlberg
that lost a bitter takeover struggle for Macmillan in 1987.
   Macmillan was acquired by Britain's Robert Maxwell for $2.5
billion, and Evans left the company shortly after the takeover.

<HEAD>Money Supply Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply were mixed in the week ended Jan. 15, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,218.3 billion from $3,216.1 billion the previous week.
   But an even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,038.7 billion from $4,042.2 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a
seasonally adjusted $791.1 billion from $794.0 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.6 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 2.1 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,203.5 billion, a 7.4
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,031.6 billion, up 3.2 percent, while M1
rose 6.4 percent to an average of $792.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at major New York City banks fell $329 million in
the week ended Jan. 17.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $347 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$198 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $299.4 billion in the two-week period ended
Jan. 10, up from $295.7 billion two weeks earlier.

   Stormy weather in the North Sea helped boost
energy futures Thursday amid concerns about possible supply
disruptions.
   ``The main story was the rough weather in the North Sea and the
impact it could have on the Cadillac crudes _ Brent and WTI _ and
on gasoline,'' said Peter Beutel, energy analyst with Elders
Futures Inc.
   Brent and West Texas Intermediate are the main crude oils of
Britain and the United States, respectively. They are light crudes
and preferred by refiners for making gasoline.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the key grade of U.S. crude oil, jumped 65
cents to $22.24 a 42-gallon barrel after losing a penny on
Wednesday.
   April WTI advanced 49 cents to $21.41 a barrel and May added 44
cents to $20.97.
   Among refined products, regular unleaded gasoline for February
delivery ended 1.22 cents higher at 60.60 cents a gallon. The March
contract rose 1.33 cents to 61.61 cents a gallon and April moved up
1.29 cents to 62.47 cents.
   Heating oil for February, which gained 0.29 cent in the previous
session, added another 0.20 cent to close at 59.77 cents a gallon.
March rose 0.33 cent to 57.69 cents and April ended up 0.09 cent at
55.27 cents. Later contracts were mixed.
   Analysts said bad weather in the North Sea raised concern about
possible disruptions of Brent oil shipments.
   ``People are worried about possible loading problems in the
North Sea,'' said Nick Fujita, energy broker for Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Fujita said the energy markets also are concerned about the
impact of possible oil supply cutbacks by Russia to Eastern
European countries. The Spviet Union is the biggest supplier of oil
to Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Reports Big Gain in Fourth Quarter, Year; Nynex Earnings Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T reported sharply higher earnings Thursday
for the 1989 fourth quarter and the year, calling it the best
annual performance for the telephone giant since the breakup of its
monopoly six years ago.
   Meanwhile, Nynex Corp., one of the ``Baby Bells'' spun off from
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., reported a loss for the fourth
quarter and lower earnings for the year.
   AT&amp;T said its improved results partly reflected a $6.7 billion
charge it took in 1988 to modernize and streamline the nation's
biggest long-distance phone network that drastically lowered
earnings that year.
   AT&amp;T said it earned $705 million, or 65 cents a share, in the
three months ended Dec. 31, vs. a loss of $3.34 billion, or the
equivalent of $3.11 a share, a year earlier. Quarterly revenue
totaled $9.3 billion vs. $9.21 billion.
   For all of 1989, the company earned $2.70 billion, or $2.50 a
share, on revenue of $36.1 billion. In 1988, the company reported a
loss of $1.67 billion, or $1.55 a share, on revenue of $35.2
billion.
   Excluding the 1988 charge, AT&amp;T's 1988 results would have been
$593 million, or 55 cents a share, for the fourth quarter and $2.27
billion, or $2.11 a share, for the year. When compared with those
results, the company's 1989 fourth quarter and yearly earnings both
rose 19 percent.
   ``It was a year of excellent earnings _ our strongest since
divestiture six years ago,'' Chairman Robert E. Allen said in a
statement. ``It was a year in which AT&amp;T became a trimmer, more
responsive and more aggressive competitor.''
   Allen said key events that shaped AT&amp;T's performance last year
included a reorganization into more focused business units, more
freedom from federal regulatory constraints and a trimming of the
work force. More than 21,000 jobs were eliminated, leaving the
company with 283,500 employees by yearend.
   One industry analyst said AT&amp;T turned in improved results
despite the increased competition it faces both in long-distance
services and the telephone and computer equipment it sells.
   ``The numbers were pretty good. To me it indicates a continuing
of their progression toward better earnings,'' said Pat Jurczak of
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Jurczak said he believed AT&amp;T would increase
its dividend in March.
   Nynex, which provides local phone service in New England and New
York state, said it lost $43.7 million, or 22 cent per share, in
the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $342 million, or
$1.74 a share, in the 1988 quarter.
   Revenue totaled $3.4 billion, compared with $3.2 billion in the
1988 quarter.
   Nynex blamed the loss in part on one-time charges totaling $325
million after taxes it took in the quarter. The charges related in
part to a four-month strike against the company.
   Nynex Chairman William Ferguson also blamed the loss on a soft
regional economy, a downturn in the financial services industry and
increased competition.
   For the year, Nynex earned $808 million, or $4.10 a share, down
from $1.32 billion, or $6.63 a share, in 1988. Revenue totaled
$13.2 billion compared with $12.7 billion in 1988.

   A federal jury on Thursday ordered Bear, Stearns
&amp; Co. to pay more than $215,000 to a former vice president who sued
the brokerage house for age and sex discrimination.
   The 50-year-old woman, Edith Wulach, claimed she was denied
consideration for a partnership and then was forced to resign in
September 1985 when she was stripped of her duties and given menial
assignments like stuffing envelopes.
   A jury of five men and one woman in U.S. District Court ruled in
Wulach's favor and awarded her $215,283.94 in back pay and damages.
   Wulach was vice president of Clearance Accounting Services at
Bear Stearns from 1979 until her resignation.
   Paul T. Williams, an attorney for the company, said he was
surprised and disappointed with the verdict. ``The company did not
do anything improper or discriminatory in this case.''
   Among the witnesses who testified for the brokerage house was
Bear Stearns chief executive officer, Alan Greenberg.
   ``It wasn't a case for money. It's a matter of principle,''
Wulach said. She is now a private consultant who does accounting
work for mutual fund and money market companies.

   Allied-Signal Inc. said Thursday
that fourth-quarter earnings rose 11 percent, largely because of
cost-cutting and strong performance from its aerospace division.
   The company also said weak U.S. car sales hurt its automative
parts division, and the performance of its third major area of
business, engineered materials, changed little.
   Earnings rose to $115 million, or 78 cents a share, from $104
million, or 70 cents a share a year earlier. Sales for the three
months ending Dec. 31 were $3.06 billion vs. $3.01 billion.
   For the year, Allied-Signal earned $528 million, or $3.55 a
share, on sales of $11.94 billion. In 1988, it earned $463 million,
or $3.10 a share, on $11.91 billion in sales.
   An unusually low tax bill helped the bottom line in 1988.
Allied-Signal's tax liability was eased by credits from over-paying
taxes on the sale of businesses, and a favorable tax rate in Brazil
for operations there, said spokesman Michael Ascolese.
   The company paid $176 million in taxes in 1988 and $241 million
last year.

<HEAD>Ingersoll Sells Five Dailies to Thomson Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ingersoll Publications Co. on Thursday announced the sale of
five daily newspapers in Indiana, Ohio and Wisconsin to
Toronto-based Thomson Newspaper Corp. for $270 million.
   Ingersoll said it had signed a letter of intent to sell the
Anderson Herald-Bulletin of Anderson, Ind.; The Tribune-Star of
Terre Haute, Ind.; the News Journal of Mansfield, Ohio; The Tribune
Chronicle of Warren, Ohio; and The Sheboygan Press of Sheboygan,
Wis.
   As part of the deal, Ingersoll said it is buying the
Thomson-owned Geauga Times Leader in Chardon, Ohio, a suburb of
Cleveland.
   ``This transaction completes the sale of the last of our
newspapers in areas which are not in or adjacent to major
metropolitan centers,'' Ingersoll President Robert M. Jelenic said
in a statement.
   ``As we have previously announced, our strategy for the 1990s is
to concentrate exclusively on urban properties in the United
States, Ireland and the United Kingdom and on the development of
new urban markets in the United States and Europe,'' he said.
   Ingersoll last September began publishing a new daily tabloid,
The St. Louis Sun.
   Ingersoll, based in Princeton, N.J., owns more than 25 daily
newspapers and more than 150 weekly newspapers in the United
States. Thomson Newspaper, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Thomson
Corp., owns more than 100 newspapers in the United States and more
than 50 in Canada.

   The dollar closed mostly lower Thursday as a
variety of rumors heightened trader fears about foreign investment
in the United States. Gold prices were mixed.
   The U.S. currency suffered its largest drop against the Japanese
yen after reports that Japanese institutional investors were
selling large amounts of dollars, said Robert Ryan, senior trader
at Bank of New York Co.
   Reports that the Federal Reserve was selling dollars against the
yen also took a toll, Ryan said.
   The dollar slumped to 143.925 yen in New York from late
Wednesday's 145.715 yen. In earlier Tokyo trading, the dollar fell
0.50 yen to 145.30 yen, and in London, it was quoted late in the
day at 144.40 yen.
   Ryan said the dollar was also hurt by a report that Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan was calling for a withholding tax on foreigners
investing in the United States. Such a move would drive down
foreign investment in this country, and in turn, foreign demand for
dollars.
   In fact, Greenspan cautioned Congress in testimony Thursday
against placing any new impediments on foreign investment, saying
it would force interest rates higher and ``probably curb economic
activity.''
   There also were rumors in the market that the Group of Seven _
the United States, Britain, Japan, France, West German, Italy and
Canada _ would meet informally over the weekend, Ryan said.
   ``The dollar's been all over the place,'' Ryan said.
   In Europe, the dollar was mixed in directionless trading. Volume
grew thinner throughout the afternoon because of a severe storm,
which disrupted transportation and forced many London banks to
close early.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6570 from $1.6555 late
Wednesday. In later New York dealings, the pound rose to $1.6600
from $1.65255.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's prices, included: 1.6850 West German marks, down from
1.6912; 1.4850 Swiss francs, down from 1.4965; 5.7255 French
francs, down from 5.7465; 1,253.75 Italian lire, down from
1,258.75; and 1.18755 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18535.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday
included: 1.6870 West German marks, up from 1.6855; 1.4870 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4975; 5.7305 French francs, unchanged; 1.8975
Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,254.75 Italian lire, down from
1,255.75, and 1.1903 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1852.
   Gold prices were mixed in New York. On the Commodity Exchange, a
troy ounce of gold fell $1.20 to $416, but Republic National Bank
later quoted a bid of $417 a troy ounce, up 40 cents from Wednesday.
   Gold fell in London earlier to a late bid price of $416.25 a
troy ounce from $421.50 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal
fell to a closing bid of $413.50 from $420. bid late Wednesday.
   The Hong Kong gold market was closed Thursday for the Lunar New
Year holidays. Trading will resume on Jan. 30
   Silver prices fell. A troy ounce of silver fell 0.3 cents to
$5.212 on the Commodity Exchange. In London, silver fell to a late
bid price of $5.22 a troy ounce from Wednesday's $5.34.

<TEXT>
   After limited success pursuing a claim
of worldwide conspiracy by giant Japanese electronics firms, a
small Scottsdale company has dusted off the allegation in a new
federal lawsuit.
   Go-Video Inc., which says it is counting on sales of its
patented, dual-deck videocassette recorder for survival, filed the
complaint Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Phoenix against six
of the companies and their U.S. subsidiaries.
   It alleges that Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. and its
Panasonic division; Victor Co. of Japan Ltd. and its JVC Corp.
subsidiary; Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd.; Sony Corp.; NEC Corp.; Sharp
Corp.; and Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. tried to monopolize markets and
prevent introduction of Go-Video's VCR-2.
   The defendants did not immediately respond.
   The new complaint expands on a conspiracy claim Go-Video first
leveled in 1987.
   The company plans to introduce the dual-deck VCR on March 28
with a $995 suggested retail price.
   In its first suit, Go-Video alleged that the six Japanese
companies and others conspired to block marketing of the VCR-2
because they had been unable to develop a machine that has the same
capabilities _ playing two movies at one time or recording from one
tape to another.
   The new suit repeats the allegations and alleges the formation
of a cartel to control the consumer-electronics market, including
conventional VCRs, digital audio-tape recording equipment and
high-definition television.
   ``Since we filed our first lawsuit, we have uncovered facts we
believe suggest the existence of a conspiracy that is much more
extensive than what we knew about or suspected when we started the
first case,'' said Joseph M. Alioto, an antitrust attorney for
Go-Video.
   Alioto spent several weeks last year investigating and taking
depositions from executives of Japanese electronics manufacturers
and others about their role in the alleged conspiracy against
Go-Video.
   Some of the defendants have reached out-of-court settlements
with Go-Video, paying the company a total of $1.9 million. The
company has spent about $700,000 on litigation.

<HEAD>Workers Rally Outside Plant to Close in a Week</HEAD>

   Hundreds of autoworkers chanting ``Lay off Lee''
rallied in the rain Thursday outside a Chrysler Corp. plant
scheduled to close next week.
   The United Auto Workers protest, with its pointed references to
Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca, comes amid a deepening slide in the
auto industry that has resulted in thousands of layoffs around the
country in advance of talks on a new UAW contract later this year.
   The closing of Chrysler's Jefferson Avenue plant on Feb. 2 is
part of a series of plant closings or indefinite production cuts
scheduled at General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
plants nationwide.
   The 1,700 people who will lose their jobs at the Jefferson
Avernue plant are among 13,500 workers at 11 GM and Chrysler plants
who will get indefinite layoff notices between January and March.
   Another 33,600 workers will be idled for at least a week at 20
GM, Ford or Chrysler assembly plants.
   The layoffs are being blamed on slow sales, high inventory and
shrinking orders from auto dealers.
   The two-hour demonstration was organized by an ad hoc group made
up mostly of UAW dissidents belonging to the so-called New
Directions movement.
   One of New Directions' leaders, Don Douglas, president of UAW
Local 594 in Pontiac, Mich., called the closing of the Jefferson
Avenue plant ``another broken promise.''
   GM plans to idle its Lakewood assembly plant in Atlanta in
mid-March. GM and Chrysler also are trimming production rates at
other plants in response to slumping sales.
   Ford so far has avoided large-scale, indefinite shutdowns by
temporary plant closings and eliminating overtime. In 1988, when
Ford was posting record profits, the company was building up to 15
percent of its new cars on overtime.
   ``It's going to be tough,'' Pete Kelly, president of UAW Local
160 at GM's Technical Center in Warren, Mich., said of the coming
negotiations, which are expected to focus on the issue of job
security.
   ``I think there is as much dissension among salaried employees
as among hourly,'' Kelly said at the rally.
   Each of the UAW's contracts with the Big Three has language
restricting plant closings, mostly to those whose products aren't
selling. Chrysler said the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon
subcompact cars aren't selling well enough to support the Jefferson
Avenue plant, and used that to justify the closing.
   The UAW is challenging that claim and has suggested to Chrysler
that the Omni and Horizon continue to be built and sold only in
areas where the model has proven to be a success.
   Many of Thursday' marchers came from GM or Ford locals, and
waited for the end of the only shift at the plant to swell their
ranks. But the parade didn't grow appreciably after the workers
inside the factory came outside.
   One worker, Al Jones of Detroit, said he wasn't sure what he
would do after the closure of the plant where he's worked for 22
years.
   He and other members of UAW Local 7, like other laid-off
autoworkers, are eligible for benefits from a variety of funds
which could pay them as much as 95 percent of their normal wage.

   New studies show fees at check-cashing outlets
nationwide continue to climb and a majority of Americans support
forcing banks to offer basic services to low-income families,
consumer advocates and civil rights groups said Thursday.
   The organizations and a congressional backer said they will push
for passage of legislation in the Senate to require banks and
savings and loans to provide low cost banking services to the
working poor and recipients of government aid.
   ``Many low-income and elderly persons can't even find a
financial institution to cash their government checks,'' said Sen.
Howard H. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, at a news conference to release the
consumer studies.
   However, ``Many institutions ... don't normally maintain the
cash level that could handle that sort of a mandate,'' said Jim
Grohl, spokesman for the League of Savings Instititutions.
   ``Banks are businesses,'' said Donald G. Ogilvie, executive vice
president of the American Bankers Association, in a written
statement. ``They price their services in a competitive
marketplace.''
   Ogilvie said more than half the nation's banks offer a basic
banking account and a majority of them already will cash a
government check for a non-customer.
   ``It's a checkmate,'' for the working poor, said Peggy Miller, a
researcher for the Consumer Federation of America.
   A CFA survey conducted between Oct. 3 and Dec. 1, 1989 showed a
general increase in the rates for cashing payroll checks and in the
number of outlets entering the payroll check-cashing market.
   A four-state study released Thursday by the U.S. Public Interest
Research Group, showed only 14 percent of the financial
institutions surveyed in New York, New Jersey, Oregon and
California offer low-cost accounts.
   Only 31 percent of the banks surveyed would cash government
checks for non-depositors.
   The Public Interest Research Group collected data from 499
financial institutions in the 1989 study.
   Metzenbaum argued that fees for basic services and minimum
deposits and balances required by many institutions for
check-cashing privileges are too high for low-income, elderly and
minority people.
   Metzenbaum's legislation suggests $2 be the minimum required
balance for basic accounts at banks and savings and loans.
   ``This country's older and poorer residents are being denied
something that many people take for granted _ the ability to have a
basic bank account,'' said Francisco Carranco, a member of the
board for the American Association of Retired Persons, a lobbying
group for the elderly. AARP backs Metzenbaum's legislation.
   The National Urban League, the NAACP and the Association of
Community Organizations for Reform Now joined the consumers groups
in backing the senator's proposals.
   A Gallup poll released Thursday by AARP said that a majority of
Americans _ 73 percent of those surveyed _ believe financial
institutions should offer some basic banking services to low-income
people.
   Sixty-nine percent would support a law that required financial
institutions to offer ``no-frills'' checking account to low-income
consumers at a price set by the government, the AARP survey said.
   The survey also found 17 percent thought the institutions should
restrict their services to those most profitable for their business.
   Gallup conducted telephone interviews with 2,008 adults from
Oct. 9-18, 1989. The margin of error for the Gallup study was plus
or minus 3 percent.

<HEAD>Board Issues Statement Opposing Campbell Soup Sale; Analysts Wary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of directors of Campbell Soup Co.
said Thursday it would maintain the food makers' independence
despite efforts by some members of Campbell's founding family to
sell the company.
   In a statement, the board said it had given ``careful
consideration'' to a move announced last month by an investor group
that it would push to sell the entire company.
   The dissident group, which includes relatives of Campbell's late
chairman John T. Dorrance Jr., said it was putting its 17 percent
stake in the business up for sale and planned to seek ``a price per
share significantly in excess of current market value.''
   But the company's board reaffirmed its intention to resist
pressure to put Campbell on the auction block.
   ``We have concluded that now is not the time to pursue a sale or
merger of the company,'' the board said. ``We are convinced that
maintaining the company's independence is the superior means of
maximizing the wealth of the company's shareholders over the long
term.''
   The board, holding its regular monthly meeting at the company's
corporate headquarters in Camden, endorsed a plan ``designed to
leverage the extensive brand power of Campbell Soup Co. and to
deliver the financial results needed to build long-term shareholder
wealth.''
   Campbell provided no specific details. David Hackney, a company
spokesman, declined to elaborate.
   Signs of disagreement within the Dorrance family, which has
controlled Campbell for nearly a century, has fueled speculation
that some major stockholders want to sell the company. Earlier this
month, Campbell named David W. Johnson its new chief executive, in
part to squelch such rumors, and analysts predicted the selection
would bring stability to the company.
   ``Today's statement was an aim to quell takeover rumors and try
to get the investment community to believe that Mr. Johnson is
going to be running this company for a long time and that he's
going to be able to show dramatic improvement over the next couple
of years,'' said Marvin B. Roffman, of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
in Philadelphia.
   Last week, two branches of the Dorrance family, told the board
they would not oppose a tax-free merger transaction. Dorrance's
three children, who own about 31 percent of the company's 129.6
million outstanding shares, have said they intend to hold their
shares and keep the company independent.

<HEAD>Top Partners Reportedly Concerned by Greed, Changing Values</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top partners at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., the
largest private partnership left on Wall Street, have expressed
concerns about the greed of some employees, changing values within
the firm and a failure to promote women and minorities, a newspaper
reported.
   The views were expressed in a study surveying 11 current and
former top partners of the firm, a copy of which was obtained by
The New York Times. The study included excerpts of executives'
comments but did not name the individuals making them, the
newspaper reported.
   The study quoted one partner as saying, ``In the old days, when
you became a partner, you would feel free to give your wallet to
another partner to hold for safekeeping. I do not think it is that
way today.''
   The partners also expressed frustration over the firm's
inability to keep some of its brightest stars, the Times reported.
They attributed the defections to factors like the 1987 stock
market crash and the growth of small boutique investment firms that
raid larger houses for talent, the newspaper said.
   One partner was quoted as saying, ``We've seen a lot of change
within the firm _ growth, international business, bringing in
people from the outside, etc. It's brought a lot of things with it.
Things like more backbiting, comments made about other people and
other activities, and they affect what it's like to work here.''
   Some partners also expressed concerns about the firm's record of
hiring women and minorities, the newspaper said.
   ``We have to do a better job of selection and need to get more
people into the process,'' one partner was quoted as saying.
``We've hire too many blacks and females from places like Harvard
and Stanford. They don't turn out to be as successful as those from
other schools (like Villanova) who have struggled more and are more
street smart.''
   One partner expressed doubt that the firm would add a second
woman to its roster of 128 partners any time soon, the Times said.
   The study, believed to have taken several months and been
completed in December 1988, was conducted by the Delta Consulting
Group, a small consulting firm, with assistance from two Harvard
Business School professors, John J. Gabarro and Jay W. Lorsch, the
Times said.
