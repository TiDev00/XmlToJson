<HEAD>What Gets a Media Mogul's Attention? A Regular Old Chain Letter</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   It seems that some of America's most powerful
media barons _ the biggies whose outlets influence public opinion
and public policy _ can themselves by influenced by the anonymous
warnings of a simple chain letter.
   A few of the moguls are sheepishly passing along a chain letter
that has been circulating through broadcast and newspaper executive
suites in Washington and New York since early this year.
   The anonymous letter, which purportedly originated in the
Netherlands and claims it ``has been passed around the world at
least 20 times,'' promises good luck in four days to every
recipient who sends it immediately to five friends.
   ``The one who breaks the chain will have bad luck,'' warns the
letter, which is accompanied by photocopies of cover messages
written by those who kept the chain unbroken.
   Arthur Sulzberger Jr., deputy publisher of The New York Times,
sent copies of his letter to five friends, including Random House
executive Peter Osnos.
   ``You'd think I would have more courage than to send it on to
you,'' Sulzberger wrote.
   ``A man will do anything out of fear,'' wrote Benjamin Bradlee,
executive editor of The Washington Post, who once tangled
fearlessly with President Nixon over his newspaper's Watergate
exposes.
   Bradlee received his letter from Shelby Coffey III, editor of
the Los Angeles Times, who passed it along with a brief note
asking, ``How can it hurt?''
   Syndicated humor columnist Art Buchwald sent his copy to five
woman friends, including Cosmopolitan publisher Helen Gurley Brown
and columnist Ann Landers.
   ``I've been asked to send this chain letter on to my five
dearest friends,'' Buchwald wrote. ``This is the best sex I ever
had.'' He added a warning that ``the last person to break this
chain was seated next to (talk show host) Morton Downey Jr. at a
dinner party.''
   Buchwald had gotten his copy from Pierre Salinger of ABC News in
London, who wrote in June: ``Having received this letter on my 65th
birthday, I have no choice but to send it on as ordered. I am
getting too old to take a chance of breaking the chain.''
   Albert R. Hunt, Washington bureau chief of The Wall Street
Journal, attributed his complicity in the chain to his
superstitious nature.
   ``I don't fly on Friday the 13th,'' Hunt wrote his friends. ``I
don't walk under ladders; when my favorite baseball team, the
Philadelphia Phillies, are winning I don't change my underwear
(thank God they've had a string of losing seasons) and I'll be
damned if I'm going to break a chain letter.''
   One of Hunt's recipients was Tim Russert, the NBC News bureau
chief in Washington. ``Keep Hunt and his voodoo journalism away
from me!'' he wrote.
   ``Look,'' Newsweek magazine's Howard Fineman pleaded with his
five friends, ``I know you've already gotten one of these and you
threw it in the wastebasket. But take pity on a guy near the end of
the food chain. Besides, it's August. What else is there to do?''
   Fineman's letter was dated Aug. 1. His journalistic dog days
ended the very next day, when Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait.
   At least one media heavyweight has been brave _ or foolish _
enough to break the chain.
   Jack Nelson, Washington bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times,
said he received the chain letter from two friends, but was too
busy covering the Persian Gulf crisis and writing a book to pay any
attention.
   ``So far my luck's been pretty good,'' he said. ``Maybe it's
working the other way for me.''

   Gilbert Lesser, one of the country's most
prolific theatre poster creators and former promotion director of
Life, Time and Money magazines, has died of cancer. He was 55.
   Lesser, who did posters for shows including ``Equus,'' ``The
Elephant Man,'' ``Frankenstein'' and ``Morning's at Seven,'' died
at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center's Milstein Hospital on
Tuesday, said John Toland, a longtime friend.
   Eighty of Lesser's posters were displayed at the Louvre in Paris
in the summer of 1987 and the new Design Museum in London in
December 1989. The collection included his logo for the Manhattan
disco Studio 54 as well as designs for the Martha Graham and the
Jose Limon dance companies.
   Lesser, who lived in Manhattan, also designed costumes and stage
sets for ``Threepenny Opera,'' ``Zoo Story'' and ``The American
Dream'' at the Berkshire Playhouse.
   He was also responsible for several promotional programs for
Charm and Mademoiselle magazines and the Smithsonian Institution.
   Lesser in 1987 established the Gilbert Lesser INCR Inc., an
international group to help organizations create and plan special
events.
   Lesser, born in Baltimore, graduated from the Maryland Institute
College of Art and from Johns Hopkins University.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Death Sentence, Rejects Psychiatric Claims</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death sentence of Robert Alton Harris,
the man closest to San Quentin's gas chamber, was upheld Wednesday
by a federal appeals court.
   Harris, now 37, was convicted of the July 1978 murders of two
San Diego teen-agers whose car he used in a $3,000 bank robbery. He
sought a new penalty trial on the grounds that the psychiatrists
who assisted his trial lawyer were incompetent for allegedly
failing to detect a longstanding brain disorder.
   Judge John Noonan of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
stayed Harris' execution March 30, four days before he was to die.
He said Harris may be entitled to a hearing to determine if his
constitutional rights were violated.
   But over Noonan's dissent, the appeals court ruled 2-1 Wednesday
that Harris' claims were meritless.
   The majority ruled in the prosecution's favor on every disputed
issue, at least two of which are important for future cases.
   The justices said courts aren't required to evaluate the
competence of a defense psychiatrist's performance. And they said a
defendant such as Harris, whose first round of appeals was rejected
before the U.S. Supreme Court established the right to psychiatric
assistance in 1985, cannot even raise the issue under federal law.
   ``A judicial evaluation of a psychiatrist's opinion or advice is
not essential to the accuracy and fairness of the criminal
process,'' and if applied to past trials ``would frustrate the
legitimate goals of the criminal justice system,'' said the opinion
by Judge Melvin Brunetti.
   ``Harris cannot now obtain a `second bite at the apple' because
he believes a new group of psychiatrists would offer a different
defense,'' the opinion said.
   Defense lawyers can ask for reconsideration by an 11-judge panel
of the court, a procedure the court has used several times recently
in capital cases from other states. It can be authorized by a
majority vote of the court's 27 active judges.
   After that, Harris' only remaining appeal is to the U.S. Supreme
Court, which has ruled against him four times in the past. No new
execution date has been set.
   Out of 286 prisoners on California's Death Row, Harris' case is
the only one to advance beyond the first stage in federal court
review, which commonly lasts several years. No one has been
executed in California since 1967.

   Daniel M. Jones was buried with full
military honors Wednesday as friends and family grieved for the
second member of the armed forces to die since the Persian Gulf
crisis began.
   Jones joined the Navy after graduating from high school in 1988
because ``he wanted money for college, to serve his country, and
most of all, to have everybody be proud of him,'' said Christina
Russell, a friend.
   Nearly 300 mourners, attended morning services at the First
Baptist Church in Wakefield, about 13 miles north of Boston.
   After a 21-gun salute, the body of Jones, an electrician's mate,
was buried in nearby Forest Glade cemetery.
   Leith A. and Arlene Jones were too overcome with emotion at the
gravesite to accept the American flag taken from the casket of
their 19-year-old son. Jones clung to his sobbing wife, while
another mourner accepted the flag for the family, which includes
Jones' four brothers and two sisters.
   Jones was electrocuted Aug. 21 aboard the USS Antietam while
performing routine maintenance on the ship's ventilation system.
The ship had been sent to the Persian Gulf as part of Operation
Desert Shield, which was deployed to counter Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Report Details Effects Layoffs Would Have on USDA, Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen B. Dewhurst is one of many Agriculture
Department employees who were notified this week that they would be
taking an unpaid furlough later this year.
   In all, some 2.4 million federal workers are being told of the
layoffs that will come if Congress and the White House fail to
solve the government's budget problems.
   Dewhurst is USDA's budget director and feels closer to the
technical aspect of the problem than most.
   But a report Tuesday by his office showed the plan to save money
under a ``sequester'' plan to cut spending would have far-reaching
effects.
   There would be lower subsidies for major commodities, and needy
farmers would have less of a chance to get housing and operating
loans, the report said.
   Perhaps as many as 90,000 USDA employees, roughly 90 percent of
the department's permanent work force, would be affected one way or
another by the layoffs.
   It would affect chicken inspectors and economists, scientists
and file clerks, highly paid executives and those at the bottom of
the scale, the report warned.
   The layoff notices and other measures are in the works just in
case Congress and the Bush administration don't come up with an
11th-hour rescue for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
   Citing the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law, the White House
has ordered an across-the-board cut of federal spending to begin
Oct. 15 if no budget agreement is reached.
   About $22.9 billion of USDA's projected outlays would be
affected. Food stamps and child nutrition programs generally are
exempt from the cuts.
   The USDA study anticipates cuts of 31.9 percent, or $7.3 billion
from affected programs.
   ``Farm price support payments and many other USDA loan and grant
programs would be severely reduced,'' the report said.
   The report added: ``The necessity to lay off employees would
disrupt USDA services throughout the world and especially at USDA
county offices throughout rural America. Producers and industries
dependent on the availability of USDA programs and services would
be severely affected.''
   For example, so-called deficiency payments to farmers for next
year have been projected at about $3 billion; a 31.9 percent cut
would be more than $900 million.
   Dairy farmers would be assessed approximately 8.7 percent per
100 pounds of milk marketed, which would reduce cash receipts by
nearly $130 million.
   In state and county offices of the department's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, where the programs are
administered, salaries and expenses would be reduced by the same
percentage. More than 20,300 employees of the county offices would
be furloughed. Offices would be closed Mondays and Fridays.
   Dewhurst said he and others in the USDA budget office had
received letters that they would be furloughed three days out of
every 10.
   ``You can get a 50-50 bet, I suppose, from people who think it
won't happen at all and those who think (cuts) will be 40
percent,'' he said.
   The Office of Management and Budget has already boosted its
estimate of spending cuts to 32.4 percent, and Dewhurst said that
could balloon further.
   Only about $600 million of the $23 billion in food programs
would be subject to the cuts.
   Food stamps alone account for around $16 billion or so. But the
current food stamp law runs out in 1991.
   ``If, as everybody expects, the food stamp program is
reauthorized, it will drive federal spending up,'' Dewhurst said.
``You'd see the (cuts) go to somewhere between 38 and 40 percent.''
   That would put a further bite on commodity price support
operations, the Farmers Home Administration, food aid to foreign
countries, conservation, research and the other eligible programs.
   According to the report, using the ``planning'' cut of 31.9
percent, farmers also would see their government checks for price
support loans reduced by that amount.
   The loans are commonly made at harvest time so farmers have
operating money to tide them over. If market prices rise later,
farmers usually pay off the loans and then sell their products for
cash.
   If the cuts are carried out, it will mean about $1.8 billion
less for farmers taking out crop loans next year, according to 1991
budget projections.
   ``A 31.9 percent sequester would greatly complicate program
administration and would introduce instability into commodity
markets,'' the report said.
   In the case of meat and poultry inspection, where most USDA
spending is vested in the salaries of employees, a 31.9 percent
spending cut was said to ``result in the absence of inspection
services during a furlough of about 137 days,'' effectively
shutting down the slaughtering and processing industries for that
amount of time.
   ``The economic loss from a shutdown would result in the loss of
billions of dollars to the American economy,'' the report said.
   Further, it said, the limited inspection that would be available
would not be sufficient to prevent an erosion of ``the high level
of safety'' in the nation's meat and poultry products and ``would
focus public criticism on the federal government.''

   The Persian Gulf crisis has created a thirst
for news that has lifted the ratings of everything from ``Face the
Nation'' to ``60 Minutes.''
   CBS' ``60 Minutes'' was the most-watched show on prime-time
television for the second consecutive week, its first back-to-back
No. 1 victories since 1983, when it was the top-rated show for the
year, the A.C. Nielsen Co. said Tuesday.
   Viewership of six Sunday news and information programs _ ``Face
the Nation'' and ``Sunday Morning'' on CBS; ``This Week with David
Brinkley'' and ``Business World'' on ABC, and NBC's ``Meet the
Press'' and ``Sunday Today'' _ rose 27.7 percent since Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait, Nielsen reported.
   Last Sunday's ``60 Minutes'' featured a Dan Rather interview
with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a segment on chemical
warfare and a report from the Soviet Union by Morley Safer.
   The weekly ratings also showed high marks for NBC and its early
fall preview week. The premieres of ``Ferris Bueller'' and
``Parenthood'' _ both spun from feature films _ landed in sixth and
seventh place, respectively.
   Fox Broadcasting Co. fell flat with its impertinent move to put
``The Simpsons'' up against NBC's ``The Cosby Show.'' The sugary
Cosby family and ``Unsolved Mysteries'' tied for No. 3. The
squabbling Simpsons were No. 54.
   NBC won the overall ratings race with a 10.5 average to ABC's
9.4 and CBS' 9.1. Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   The most-watched nightly network news program belonged to ABC
and Peter Jennings, with a 10.4 average. CBS and Dan Rather were
second with 10.2 and NBC and Tom Brokaw dragged into last with 8.9.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``60
Minutes,'' CBS, 16.5; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 15.4; ``The Cosby Show,''
``Unsolved Mysteries, NBC, (tie) 15; ``Empty Nest,'' NBC, 14.9;
``Ferris Bueller,'' NBC, 14.2; ``Parenthood,'' NBC, 14.1; ``The
Golden Girls,'' NBC, 13.9; ``Matlock,'' NBC, 13.8, ``Roseanne,''
ABC, 13.6.

   Air Force reservists making round-the-clock
cargo flights to the Persian Gulf said Tuesday the trips are
tiring, sometimes frightening journeys into a hot, strange place.
   ``The glare off the sand flying over it is ... almost
blinding,'' said Staff Sgt. William Salter. ``You almost get the
impression you're flying over another planet.''
   Salter and other volunteer reservists from the 433rd Military
Airlift Wing at Kelly Air Force Base have flown supplies to the
Middle East aboard giant C-5 cargo planes for Operation Desert
Shield, the U.S. response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Early Wednesday, a C-5 flown by a crew of 17 crashed and burned
at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany, reportedly killing 10 people.
   Eight crew members and two maintenance personnel from the 433rd
were aboard the plane, said Maj. Donna Pastor, spokeswoman at
Kelley. The other seven were from other Air Force installations,
she said, adding that she didn't know which bases. She didn't know
how many of the dead were from the 433rd.
   The reserve wing at Kelly has not been activated, but volunteer
reservists have been working beside active-duty Air Force crews.
   ``We've probably had in excess of about 200 people (from the
433rd) help out,'' said wing commander Col. Michael J. Quarnaccio.
``We've had more volunteers than can be used right now.''
   The 15 C-5s operated by the 433rd at Kelly have flown to other
bases, where they were loaded with supplies, Quarnaccio said. They
then fly to Europe and on to Saudi Arabia. The trip takes up to 27
hours.
   Quarnaccio and airlift wing reservists refused to discuss
specific destinations or details of their trips, but some said Air
Force and Army troops were aboard their planes.
   ``What they're actually hauling, we don't know,'' Quarnaccio
said.
   Maj. Dennis Means, a C-5 reserve pilot who has made three trips
to the Middle East under Operation Desert Shield, said the crews
sometimes were apprehensive.
   ``There is a fear factor when you do go into a situation where
there could be combat,'' said Means, a pilot for Southwest Airlines
who has taken unpaid time off to fly the missions.
   Crew members said one of their biggest problems was battling
fatigue during the trips, which sometimes included stopovers in
Saudi Arabia as short as six hours.
   ``It's tough. You're just real tired,'' said Means.
   Staff Sgt. George Hernandez said his job was to make sure the
C-5s were in good shape. That meant overcoming obstacles like sand
and searing heat.
   ``Where ever it's flying, you still have to check the tires, the
oil,'' he said. ``Going into any extreme weather _ whether it be
hot or cold _ it's going to have its effect on an aircraft.''

<HEAD>Journalistic Question Raised Again: Do You Edit Saddam Hussein?</HEAD>

   Once again, Saddam Hussein met with some of the
Western ``guests'' he holds hostage, an Iraqi TV crew in tow.
   And again, Cable News Network aired the Iraqi satellite
transmission live, enabling CNN viewers to watch along with the
Iraqi public.
   So again, a journalistic debate emerged. Should news operations
give Saddam live access to American television?
   ``We would not do that under any circumstances,'' said Bob
McFarland, NBC deputy director of news. ``We made that decision the
first day they pumped it out. We decided it was pure propaganda.''
   None of the big three American networks _ NBC, ABC and CBS _
aired the Iraqi transmission live on Tuesday, as CNN did. Instead,
they showed portions somewhat later.
   CNN said the meeting was important enough to show as quickly as
possible.
   ``We make these decisions on a case-by-case basis,'' said CNN
spokesman Steve Haworth, adding that CNN understood that Saddam
would be speaking with American hostages. ``There was no question
in our minds this would be newsworthy.''
   CNN explained to viewers that the broadcast was an Iraqi TV
feed. And afterward, CNN featured a debate over the wisdom of the
decisions it had made.
   It's a decision the other networks see differently.
   At NBC, ``we would not put Iraqi TV on the air without first
knowing what it was,'' McFarland said. ``We took every frame of it
into the house, looked at it, and then selected two or three
bites.''
   ``Wherever there is a hostage videotape, a captive videotape,
it's a decision we don't take lightly,'' said Sherrie Rollins, ABC
director of news information. The president of ABC News has to
approve the use of such video, she said.
   When Saddam appeared on television on Thursday with Western
hostages, ABC joined the Iraqi satellite feed live for a few
moments after first viewing the transmission to gauge the content
of the material.
   ``We did air the material; we did feel it was newsworthy,'' Ms.
Rollins said.
   But when Saddam appeared with hostages again Tuesday, ABC taped
the material and showed only a brief portion during a special
report by anchorman Peter Jennings, she said.
   After Tuesday's coverage on CNN, Pati Heath of Detroit, the
sister of an American hostage, called the Atlanta-based network to
say she had seen her brother on TV.
   CNN then put her on television, too.
   ``I'm just happy to be able to see my brother's face,'' she
said. ``I hope Hussein sees me talking right now.''
   During Tuesday's meeting between Saddam and the hostages _ whom
he calls ``guests'' _ a woman with a British accent was heard
asking Saddam why he was using foreign children ``in something they
can't understand.''
   He responded with a long answer about the threat to his nation
from Western troops. But later Tuesday, the Iraqi News Agency
reported that women and children held in Iraq would be free to go,
and that Saddam had changed his mind because of the concern
expressed by the foreign families during the meeting.
   ``I don't think it's coincidental,'' Haworth said.

<HEAD>Countdown Begins for Columbia Launch</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The countdown started today for this
weekend's launch of Columbia, NASA's first attempt to send up a
shuttle since the fleet was grounded by hydrogen leaks.
   The newly repaired shuttle is scheduled to blast off on an
astronomy mission at 1:17 a.m. EDT Saturday. Columbia's seven-man
crew arrives at Kennedy Space Center tonight.
   ``There's an extra sense of anticipation, that we're anxious to
begin flying again,'' said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham. ``It's
been a dry summer.''
   Columbia's nine- to 10-day flight will be the first shuttle
mission since April, when Discovery carried the flawed Hubble Space
Telescope into orbit. That's the longest gap between missions since
flights resumed after the 1986 Challenger accident.
   Leaking hydrogen kept Columbia from lifting off with the $150
million Astro observatory in May, then grounded Atlantis. The leaks
are believed to be in different spots.
   NASA also has been haunted this summer by Hubble's defective
mirror and the malfunctioning Magellan spacecraft. The space agency
on Tuesday delayed Magellan's mapping of Venus until late September
to find out why the spacecraft keeps losing touch with Earth.
   NASA plans to roll Discovery out to another launch pad after
Columbia lifts off.
   Discovery must be launched with the sun-probing Ulysses
satellite between Oct. 5 and Oct. 23 because of the alignment of
Earth, the sun and Jupiter, whose gravitational field will
slingshot Ulysses back to the sun. Otherwise, the $750 million
mission must be delayed 13 months.
   Columbia was supposed to have gone up May 30, but the launch was
called off because of leaks detected during fueling. A month later,
hydrogen also was found to be escaping from Atlantis, prompting
NASA to ground all three shuttles.
   NASA replaced Columbia's leaky plumbing. Atlantis' secret
Pentagon mission has been rescheduled for November.
   Columbia's flight will be the first shuttle mission in five
years devoted entirely to scientific research. Four astronomers on
board will operate the Astro observatory, which will remain on
board.
   Astro's three ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope
will probe some of the hottest objects in the universe. The
approximately 150 targets include a supernova and Comet Levy, which
is making its first pass through the solar system in recorded time.
   Scientists have had to revise Astro's observing schedule
numerous times because of the delays. The mission originally was
scheduled for March 1986 but was postponed after the Challenger
disaster.

would provide a formidable test of an American ground war strategy
that relies on a combination of Vietnam-era weapons and costly,
ultra-modern systems never tested in combat.
   Should the desert standoff come to blows, U.S. military planners
believe the American forces would win but only after a bloody fight.
   It is also a fight they would rather wage at night.
   Until Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the U.S. military had
never trained with Iraq as its mock opponent. But the weapons and
tactics of Iraq would not be unfamiliar _ its tanks are Soviet-made
and it has adopted the Soviet tactic of massing huge numbers of
tanks and supporting them with heavy artillery.
   ``We've trained since the beginning of the Cold War for this
fight,'' an Army source said recently. ``The only difference now is
we'd fight it in the Saudi Arabia instead of Germany, against Iraq
and not the Russians.''
   Iraq's strengths are its sheer numbers _ roughly 5,500 tanks _
its familiarity with the terrain and experience from eight years of
war with Iran.
   The United States, outnumbered on the ground, is said to have
superior missiles, air power, and ground-level sighting, guidance
and weapons systems.
   The troops and weapons that make up the United States' tank war
arsenal have been arriving gradually since the U.S. deployment
began three weeks ago but much of the force is now in place.
   The Army's heavy M-1 tanks began arriving Tuesday and are being
sent into the northeastern desert, where several anti-tank units
already are in place.
   In a tank war with Iraq, the United States would seek to counter
Iraq's greater numbers with a massive air assault, first targeting
Iraqi ground-to-air missile systems, according to dozens of
commanders, pilots and tank crews interviewed over the past two
weeks.
   Iraq has modern, Soviet-made anti-aircraft systems, but U.S.
planners are confident they could be significantly damaged by
American, British and Saudi planes.
   The next phase in the air, according to the interviews, would
involve the Air Force's A-10 tank killer jets and the premiere
American anti-tank weapon, the new AH-64 Apache attack helicopter.
   The A-10 flys as slowly as 100 knots, carries missiles and a
30mm seven-barrel cannon. It is vulnerable to enemy fire but has
several redundant systems to keep it flying after hits and also a
titanium tub around the cockpit to protect the pilot during what
one A-10 commander, Col. Sandy Sharpe, refers to as ``air to mud''
warfare.
   The Apache carries up to 16 Hellfire laser-guided missiles, like
its carrier untested in combat but said to be highly accurate. It
also has two 19-rocket pods and an anti-tank gattling gun.
   ``The Hellfire will destroy any known armor in the world,'' said
Lt. Col. Don Vinson, an Apache pilot and commander.
   Apache's are considered an ideal tank killer at night, when they
can sit back well beyond Iraqi range and fire missiles.
   ``They can't see us, but I can see and kill them,'' said Armt
Lt. Col. Dick Cody.
   Army and Marine Cobras, Vietnam-era choppers that have been
refitted with new weapons and electronics, also could be called
into any large tank war. Cobras are armed with Tow missiles and
gattling guns.
   The major cog in the ground strategy, the 24th Infantry
(Mechanized) Division, began rolling its M-1 tanks northward into
the desert on Tuesday.
   In an all-out battle, the untested M-1s and their 105mm cannons
would be riding into the desert accompanied by Bradley armored
infantry carriers, which has a 25mm gun and slots through which
passengers can fire their M-16s.
   Despite their size _ an M-1 weighs 60 tons _ the tanks can
travel at speeds of up to 45 mph or more.
   The other tanks in the U.S. arsenal, the M-60As belonging to the
7th Marine Expeditionary Brigade and the M-551 Sheridans deployed
with the 82nd Airborne Division, both date back to Vietman.
   The Sheridans, which carry Shillelagh missiles, saw combat duty
then and when dropped into Panama during the December U.S.
invasion. The M-60s date back to Vietnam, but never have been
tested in combat.
   Iraq's huge tank army is led by modern Soviet-made T-72s, which
are considered by many experts a rival to the Ameican M-1.
   ``Make no mistake about it _ they've got more tanks than us and
they've got some damn good tanks,'' a U.S. tank commander said.
U.S. military planners are counting on their superior air power.
   The triple-digit heat and terrain of the Saudi desert would be a
factor in any tank fight.
   There are some high dunes but for the most part it would be
difficult for any great number of tanks to hide.
   ``Tow heaven'' responded one weapons specialist when asked about
the desert. ``We'll seem them coming for miles.''
   The ships carrying U.S tanks were asked to bring additional
filters for the M-1s, which need to be cleaned frequently. And
higher viscosity oil was put on supply lists because of the heat's
wear and tear on the equipment.
   ``It will make it a lot tougher out there in the heat,'' said
Sgt. Ronald Ruff of Hinesville, Ga. ``But when you're cleaning or
changing a filter or something in combat you learn to speed up a
little.''

<HEAD>Furlough Warnings Sent to FBI Agents, Other Justice Workers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI agents, federal prosecutors, prison guards
and other Justice Department crime fighters are being told they
could be furloughed if Congress and the White House don't agree on
a budget.
   The Justice Department is notifying most of its 80,000 employees
that they could be furloughed up to 22 days in the coming fiscal
year if automatic spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law take effect Oct. 1.
   The Office of Management and Budget has ordered a 32.4 percent
spending cut from the government's operating budget in the 1991
fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, if lawmakers and the Bush
administration fail to agree on other ways of reducing the budget
deficit.
   Officials at various federal law enforcement agencies said the
furloughs could make operating extremely difficult.
   Running the nation's federal prisons on a reduced staff would be
``incredibly challenging _ that's a euphemism,'' said Douglas
Lansing, assistant director of the Bureau of Prisons. ``We don't
think we could do it.''
   The furloughs could affect all 9,800 FBI agents, including those
assigned to investigate foreign spies, said FBI spokesman Carlos H.
Fernandez. No decision has been made whether to furlough agents
working on undercover investigations, he said.
   ``We will try to do our duty as best we can, but to say if won't
affect operations would be a mistake,'' Fernandez said.
   Furloughs at the U.S. Marshals Service ``would have a serious
effect, probably a drastic effect'' on the agency's ability to
chase fugitives, transport prisoners and seize assets from accused
criminals, said spokesman Bill Dempsey.
   ``We would continue the vital life-or-death functions of
providing security for the federal judges all over the country and
protecting government witnesses,'' but the other activities would
have to be curtailed, he said.
   The furloughs of 3,800 federal prosecutors in 94 U.S. attorneys
offices will have to be juggled to accommodate trial schedules,
officials said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, FBI Director William Sessions
and other presidential appointees, such as assistant attorneys
general, would not be affected.
   The notices sent to employees this week raised the possibility
of additional layoffs if Congress and the White House don't reach
agreement. A memo sent to employees of the Justice Department's
management division said the unit would have to lay off each
employee 70 days during fiscal 1991 if the automatic spending cuts
are not restored.
   The Bureau of Prisons plans to furlough each of its 18,500
employees for 3{ days per two-week pay period, Lansing said.
   Similar arrangements are being made at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which employs 4,082 Border Patrol agents
and 1,400 investigators.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration has no plans to furlough any
of its 3,000 agents but will stop paying overtime, cut out all
non-essential travel and purchases and stop hiring new employees,
said spokesman Bill Ruzzamenti.

<TEXT>
   Facing a tobacco shortage that has produced street
protests and rioting in some cities, Moscow's City Council decided
Tuesday to ration cigarettes starting Sept. 1.
   When Moscow residents pick up their monthly coupons for sugar,
which is already rationed, they will also get coupons for five
packs of cigarettes per person, the newspaper Vechernaya Moskva
said.
   That means Muscovites officially will be limited to just over
one pack a week _ not nearly enough to satisfy the cravings of many
Soviets, a nation of chain-smokers.
   However, nicotine addicts with money will be able to buy more
cigarettes on the thriving black market, where a medium-quality
brand that officially sells for 30 kopeks (about 50 cents) a pack
goes for up to $8. Higher-quality foreign cigarettes fetch up to
$32 per pack.
   Tobacco coupons apparently will be issued in the same
indiscriminate manner as sugar coupons, which means that every
resident _ including children and non-smokers _ will get the same
amount.
   People who don't use their coupons will be able to give them to
friends, sell them on the black market or trade them officially the
following month for an extra 4.4 pounds of sugar.
   The cigarette shortage, which began in early summer and
accelerated this month, has forced Muscovites to queue up for hours
_ even in driving rain _ at tobacco kiosks.
   Irate smokers have blocked traffic in Moscow's central
Revolution Square, and street protests also have been reported in
Leningrad, Gorky and Yaroslavl.
   Young people demanding more tobacco, food and alcohol rioted
Friday in the Siberian city of Chelyabinsk, smashing shop windows
and throwing gasoline bombs, according to the Soviet news agency
Tass.
   Authorities have announced price increases that will triple the
official cost of most cigarette brands starting next month, but
Moscow is believed to be the first city to resort to rationing
tobacco.
   Official spokesmen have blamed the shortage on factory
breakdowns, hoarding by black marketeers and the near-depletion of
the nation's reserves of foreign currency, which has forced the
Soviet Union to buy 5 billion fewer cigarettes from Bulgaria this
year than it did last year.
   The shortage was predicted months in advance by an American
expert, Laura R. Davis. In a March report for the U.S. Agriculture
Department, she said demand for tobacco was rising in the Soviet
Union, which now has an estimated 70 million smokers, and harvests
were not keeping pace.
   She predicted that this year's Soviet tobacco crop would be only
215,000 tons, unchanged from 1989 and down about one-third from the
peak of 350,000 tons in 1985.
   Although the Soviet Union is the world's third largest tobacco
grower, topped only by the United States and China, it imported
about 55 billion cigarettes in 1988, with more than 95 percent
coming from Bulgaria.

   The death toll from typhoon Yancy, which lashed
China's southern coast last week, has climbed to 216, an official
newspaper said today.
   The paper, the China Daily, said latest reports reaching Beijing
also indicated that 59 were missing in the wake of the typhoon. It
said direct economic losses caused by the typhoon were estimated at
$170 million.
   The report did not give a breakdown by region. Earlier reports
said 111 people had died in Fujian province, many of them crushed
by buildings that collapsed under torrential rains.
   The reports said the typhoon slammed into the province's coast
three times in 24 hours last week. The region had already been hit
by four destructive typhoons in the past two months.

   The Persian Gulf crisis appears to be taking a
toll on some weak-hearted Israelis.
   Shahal, a private company that operates a 24-hour telephone
emergency service for Israelis suffering from heart conditions, on
Tuesday reported a 20 percent increase in the number of calls since
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``When subscribers call Shahal we don't ask them their political
opinion on the situation, but it is difficult to give another
reason to what is happening,'' said Erez Alroy, deputy head of the
company, which has more than 15,000 subscribers in the Tel Aviv and
Haifa areas.
   ``We see an apparent link between the situation and the anxiety.
Part of their release of tension is by calling the hotline,'' Alroy
said.
   He said Shahal has received 170 calls compared to the average of
140 daily and that intensive care units have been sent out 25 times
a day as compared to the usual 20.
   He could not say how many people had suffered heart attacks but
noted that 70 percent of those treated by intensive care units were
taken to hospitals, an increase of 10 percent.

   Tornadoes ripped through several
northern Illinois towns Tuesday, blowing residents out of apartment
buildings and leveling at least 100 homes and a school. As many as
26 were reported dead and the death toll was expected to rise.
   Local hospitals said at least 290 people were being treated for
storm-caused injuries.
   The tornadoes touched down at least four times just after 3:30
p.m. CDT along a seven-mile southwesterly path from the community
of Plainfield to Joliet, about 40 miles southwest of Chicago,
Illinois State Police said.
   In Crest Hill, on the outskirts of Joliet, eight people were
killed when the twister flattened an apartment complex, said
Lockport Fire Chief Dave Martis. Four bodies, including that of a
4-month old baby, were lying in a cornfield next to the complex,
and four others were pulled from the collapsed buildings and a car.
   ``When the storm went through, some of the buildings
disintegrated,'' Martis said. ``High winds blew some of the people
into the corn field.''
   Guy Allton, 16, watched the storm from his house near Plainfield
High School.
   ``We went outside, and there was picnic tables flying past our
faces and stuff,'' Allton said.
   Afterward he helped pull people from nearby houses, including
two badly hurt babies.
   ``Everything was messed up,'' Allton said. ``Lots and lots of
people hurt.''
   Officials' counts of the dead varied from 20 to 26, and some
said they expected to find more bodies when searching resumed
Wednesday.
   Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster Agency spokesman Lynn
Bobo said late Tuesday that 26 people were killed.
   The Will County coroner said 20 bodies had been brought to a
central morgue as of 11:45 p.m. CDT. Others might be in transit,
but some may have been counted twice, said coroner Duane Krueger.
   Five people died in Plainfield, said John Watson, ambulance
services chief for the Plainfield Fire Department.
   Four people were killed in Joliet, including three in a
subdivision under construction, said Police Chief Dennis Nowicki.
   ``I'm not confident the death toll won't rise,'' said Will
County Executive Charles Adelman, noting that it wasn't known how
many people were inside the heavily damaged Plainfield High School.
   There were several arrests for looting, Adelman said.
   It wasn't immediately clear where the others of the 23 were
found.
   The National Guard was called out Tuesday evening to help state
police prevent looting and control crowds in the area, said Ms.
Bobo, the emergency services spokeswoman.
   Commonwealth Edison spokesman John Hogan reported 17,000
customers without power in the area hit by the storms.
   Judi Mack, a spokeswoman for St. Joseph Hospital in Joliet, said
the hospital had received 157 storm victims. Only 25 were admitted
with injuries ranging from minor to severe, she said.
   Thirty-five people were taken to Silver Cross Hospital, where
they were in serious to fair condition, said spokeswoman Susan
Larson. Several other hospitals also reported treating storm
victims.
   Plainfield High School was destroyed and some teachers and
students were injured, said Steve Schernerhorn, who with other
teachers and student athletes crouched in the halls as the roof was
blown off.
   ``We had some very short warnings. We immediately took cover,''
he said in a telephone interview. He said about 25 houses near the
school were destroyed.
   Dozens of athletes were in the gym shortly before the tornado
hit, but coaches moved them to another part of the school just
before the gym roof collapsed onto the floor.
   Principal Jim Waldorf said as many as 175 people were in the
school at the time of the storm, and a number of them suffered
minor injuries.
   Teacher Mike Salisburg said some cars in the school parking lot
were thrown as far as several hundred yards.
   Major damage was also reported at St. Mary's Elementary School
nearby.
   Eric Curtis, 24, who lives a half-mile northwest of the high
school, said he was at home when the twister hit.
   ``I felt real bad pressure in my head,'' Curtis said. ``I saw my
dad running toward the house.''
   The Curtis house suffered only minor damage, but others in the
neighborhood were wrecked.
   Michael Hejka, 28, arrived at his friend's house five minutes
before the tornado hit.
   ``I saw trees bending, and I said to my buddy, `It's a
tornado!''' Hejka said. ``I said, `Jump into the bathtub.' He
jumped in, and I jumped in right on top of him. The whole house
lifted up, and then came down.''
   Phone lines into the area were jammed; many were reported down.
   At least nine emergency shelters were set up by local disaster
agencies and the Red Cross.
   The Red Cross was supplying clothing, toiletries and food.
   Will County is part of a frequently hit ``tornado alley,'' the
National Weather Service said. A tornado hit Plainfield Township in
April 1984, injuring six people and demolishing 14 homes. In June
1976, a twister hit Lemont, 10 miles northeast of Plainfield,
killing three people and injuring as many as 40. That tornado
damaged 375 houses and businesses.
   Commonwealth Edison spokesman John Hogan reported 17,000
customers without power in the area hit by the storms.
   State Police spokesman Robert Fletcher said at least 50 houses
were leveled, about 30 of them north of Plainfield and 20 or 30
near the Louis Joliet Mall just outside Joliet.
   Other State Police officials reported 15 to 20 houses damaged in
unincorporated areas of Will County.
   Watson, of the Plainfield Fire Department, said emergency
workers found 40 homes flattened southeast of the city.
   At least six people were injured in pileups on Interstate 55
caused by violent winds, said State Police Lt. Clifford Mann. The
interstate at U.S. 30 was down to one lane of traffic because of a
semi tractor-trailer rig blown over, he said.
   Crops were flattened west and north of Joliet.
   Many roads were blocked by trees, and toppled electric towers
and downed lines sparked fires in Joliet, Mezera said.
   In Plainfield, a dumpster was lodged in the upper branches of a
tall tree, an empty dump truck was on its side and an empty van was
found after it fell off a bridge into the DuPage River. Seachers
were combing the banks of the debris-clogged stream.

   Israel is trying to maintain a restrained
stance on the Persian Gulf crisis despite growing fears its own
interests will be undermined if Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is not
toppled.
   A low-key posture is not easy for Israel, and strong rhetoric
keeps cropping up from military analysts _ often voicing leaks from
the government _ and from officials themselves, sometimes followed
by hasty reversals.
   The dilemma for Israel is that it is the United States'
best-armed and closest ally in the Middle East but has been
sidelined in this crisis by political necessity.
   Washington does not want its friendship with the Jewish state to
undermine the coalition of moderate Arab states it has brought
together in response to Saddam's Aug. 2 lightning seizure of Kuwait.
   Stuck on the sidelines, Israelis are increasingly uneasy that
diplomatic efforts to end the crisis and political maneuvering by
Saddam will lead to a military stalemate.
   ``There is concern building here that somehow Saddam may get
away with his aggression,'' Eytan Gilboa, a professor of
international relations at Hebrew University, said Tuesday. ``That
leaves us still facing his military machine.''
   A similar view was expressed by the Hebrew daily Yediot Ahronot,
which said in an editorial that ``A diplomatic compromise for the
Kuwait crisis ... would mean that we would remain here alone with
Saddam and his mad ambitions, only four minutes away from his
missile launchers and chemical bombs.''
   Saddam, an implacable foe of Israel, has a million-man army and
has threatened to turn his chemical weapons against the Jewish
state.
   He also has championed the goal of Palestinians to form an
independent state in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
sparking pro-Saddam rallies in the territories and neighboring
Jordan.
   Fear of Iraq's potential military menace prompted reserve army
Gen. Avigdor Ben-Gal, a hero in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, to
advise that the United States turn its ``tactical nuclear weapons
against Iraq.''
   Ben-Gal told Israel radio: ``I think the Americans made a
mistake by not acting quickly and taking chances. ... Those who
want to take minimum risks could find themselves in a situation
where they cannot act even though they are ready.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has tried to keep the lid on,
saying that Israel has no intention of getting involved with Iraq
unless it is attacked.
   He reacted angrily on Tuesday to allegations in U.S.
publications that Israel was using its alliance with President Bush
to war-monger.
   ``Who are we to push the biggest superpower in the world?''
Shamir told a Parliament hearing. ``We are not pushing the United
States to any war.''
   Still, it was Shamir himself who caused a storm last week when
he hinted that a pre-emptive Israeli strike against Iraq was
possible.
   He told a gathering of American Jewish donors that ``In the
circumstances, our major task is to prevent war, or to pre-empt it
and if, heaven forbid, these two fail, and there is no alternative,
we have to win quickly and decisively.''
   Under questioning from reporters, Shamir quickly qualified his
statement and said Israel's aim was ``to prevent any military
involvement of our country.''
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens, too, has retracted hawkish
statements.
   On Monday, Arens told Israel television that Israel would not be
pleased by a solution that left Saddam in power. On Tuesday,
standing before two U.S.-made F-15 jets during an air base news
conference, he denied he called for Saddam's ouster.
   ``We're not involved in managing this crisis and we're not
setting the conditions for how to handle it,'' Arens said.
   Yet the question of whether Israel is or should advise the
United States to go to war is being widely discussed by Israelis.
   Mordechai Gur, a former army chief of staff, told state
television Tuesday that Israeli officials should be careful of what
they say because some Americans consider their remarks provocative.
   ``If we would not go to war, let us not send other children to
war and let us not bereave other families,'' Gur said. ``It's their
right to try to end the crisis by political means.''
   The Israeli government has already stated its own ``red lines''
for war _ a direct strike or entry by Iraqi forces into neighboring
Jordan, which serves as a buffer between Israel and Sadddam's army.
   Israel, America's largest aid recipient at $3 billion annually,
also made it clear that it is concerned with the advanced American
weaponry being supplied to Saudi Arabia and other Arab states
confronting Iraq.
   ``Israel is against the sale of arms to countries which refuse
to enter the peace process with Israel,'' said a Foreign Ministry
official, who insisted on anonymity. ``Israel wants to remind (the
United States) of the necessity of preserving a qualitative edge.''

<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has altered
the dynamics of President Bush's inner circle, bringing three top
advisers to the forefront and diminishing the role of others.
   Bush's key advisers of the gulf crisis are National Security
Adviser Brent Scowcroft, Defense Secretary Richard Cheney and Gen.
Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   These are the three men with whom Bush consults over and over
each day as he monitors the Iraqi stalemate _ whether vacationing
here at his oceanfront home or on forays back to Washington.
   All three are old Washington hands with whom Bush worked in
previous administrations _ a familiar pattern for the president.
   Scowcroft is a constant golfing and fishing companion _ the one
aide Bush sees the most frequently at work and at play.
   And, although Scowcroft has told friends he sometimes has
trouble keeping track of the names of the first family's multitude
of grandchildren, insiders says he has in recent months evolved
into almost an auxiliary member of Bush's family _ and possibly his
most trusted adviser.
   By contrast, Chief of Staff John Sununu, who in other times is
constantly at Bush's side, has faded into the background in recent
days. Sununu's strong suit has always been domestic policy, not
foreign or military affairs.
   Sununu's role in the current military and diplomatic crisis has
been so minor that his presence wasn't even needed this week when
Bush returned to Washington for two and a half days.
   He's heading a delegation of White House officials who are in
Moscow helping show Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev how to
administer an executive office.
   Early in Bush's administration, there was speculation that
Scowcroft, a soft-spoken retired Air Force general who was
President Ford's top national security aide in the 1970s while Bush
was CIA chief, was unhappy with his job and wanted out.
   The speculation went that Scowcroft felt a diminished role in
light of the fact that Bush himself was deeply interested in
foreign policy and had made one of his oldest and best friends,
James A. Baker III, his secretary of state.
   However, a Scowcroft departure never came to pass. And today, he
has evolved into an adviser many White House officials suggest is
closer to the president, in some ways, than even Baker.
   Oddly, Baker's role over the past few weeks in the Persian Gulf
crisis has been largely behind-the-scenes.
   Until Tuesday, Baker had been on a vacation of his own in
Wyoming. Administration officials said Baker worked privately to
rally support in the United Nations after the United States called
for a full blockade of Iraqi ports, and to coordinate U.S. actions
with the Soviet Union.
   But otherwise, his profile has been a low one _ while Scowcroft
more and more was the official that the White House selected to
appear on television talk shows to elaborate on gulf policy.
   Baker cut short his Wyoming vacation to meet with the president
at the White House on Tuesday.
   ``He (Baker) is back and you can believe he's not going anywhere
now,'' said one administration official.
   Bush also had a previous working relationship with Cheney and
Powell. Cheney was former President Ford's chief of staff while
Bush was CIA chief. Powell was former President Reagan's national
security adviser when Bush was vice president. The two talked
almost daily.
   Scowcroft ``bridges both worlds,'' serving as an intermediary
between Powell and Cheney, said one key aide.
   While Bush talks with Baker on the phone _ sometimes several
times a day _ he's constantly with Scowcroft. The national security
adviser has an office close to the Oval Office in the White House,
and the two drop in on one another frequently.
   Scowcroft's emerging high profile has much to do with the fact
that the U.S. operation in the gulf is primarily a military one.
But aides say that it also reflects Bush's trust in him.
   ``Over the past few months, there's a special affinity that's
developed between the president and Brent,'' said a White House
aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Both share the same
kind of philosophy. And over the past year or so, the relationship
has developed a lot closer.''

   Judging by the nervous commotion inside the
Iraqi Embassy, the 36 diplomatic employees and their families
ordered to leave the country probably won't be ready to move until
close to the Thursday deadline.
   Inside the orange-brick embassy Tuesday, about a dozen
Arabic-speaking men gestured excitedly, shuttling in and out of
several rooms. In the reception area, a small knot of people
watched an Iraqi television broadcast relayed by CNN.
   The sparsely furnished room was dominated by two huge portraits
of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein: one in military uniform with a
beret, the other in a blue suit.
   There were no apparent signs of papers or other effects being
moved at the embassy Tuesday evening.
   Earlier in the day, a request to interview some of the departing
diplomats was denied.
   Security at the embassy appeared lax. An Associated Press
reporter entered the front door, rang the buzzer next to the inner
locked door and was let in without identifying herself. A mailman
went in with an Express Mail package from California.
   For the 36 embassy personnel and their families who were ordered
to leave, the Persian Gulf crisis has been reduced to one
overwhelming imperative: packing up, and fast.
   ``It's a hell of a problem now,'' said Ahmad Alkiassiy, an Iraqi
consultant helping the envoys with the move. ``Seventy-two hours,
it's just impossible.''
   On Monday afternoon, a U.S. diplomatic message was delivered to
Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed Al-Mashat, serving notice that the 36 must
be gone from the United States within 72 hours.
   The move was in retaliation for a series of Iraqi actions,
especially the ``illegal order'' for the closure of the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said.
   The 19 Iraqis permitted to remain at the embassy, including
Al-Mashat, reflect the number of Americans still working at the
U.S. embassies in Iraq and Kuwait.
   For the diplomats ordered to leave, the U.S. message meant they
had to feverishly stuff their belongings into boxes. Alkiassiy said
the embassy had to rent three large trucks to haul between 200 and
300 boxes of possessions to New York for shipment to Iraq.
   The abrupt move is taking an emotional toll on some of the
diplomats, said Alkiassiy, an Iraqi citizen who lives in Washington
and describes himself as a friend of the embassy trying to help out.
   ``Some of them are sad because they're used to it here,'' he
said.
   Outside the embassy, an officer in the Secret Service's
Uniformed Division stood on the sidewalk in the 90-degree heat,
chatting with a city policeman.
   ``At least it's not as hot as Saudi Arabia,'' the Secret Service
officer quipped to a reporter.
   About a dozen photographers and television cameramen maintained
a vigil. They tensed at the slightest movement, snapping to each
time someone emerged from the embassy.
   It seemed they might have a long wait to see a caravan of
departing diplomats. The disorganized atmosphere at the embassy
gave the impression that the complicated move would come at the
last minute, close to the deadline.
   ``It's hell getting out, believe me,'' Alkiassiy said.

   The Environmental Protection Agency says it
has added 106 hazardous waste sites, including 23 federal
government facilities, to its national priority cleanup list.
   Tuesday's action brings the total number of sites on the list to
1,187, including 116 federal facilities, mostly Defense Department
installations.
   Another 20 sites _ all non-federal _ have been proposed for
listing, with decisions expected within a few months, the agency
said.
   Placement on the list makes non-federal sites eligible for
cleanup aid under the federal Superfund law.

   Altovise Davis, widow of Sammy Davis Jr.,
says there is no truth to rumors circulating in Hollywood that the
entertainer died a pauper.
   British and American tabloids have said Mrs. Davis and her
14-year-old son, Manny, were to be evicted from their home by the
Internal Revenue Service.
   ``If you were to believe the alternative press, the IRS is
sweeping down on her (and) Altovise is emotionally very
disturbed,'' her lawyer, Visilios Choulos, said at a news
conference Tuesday. ``All of those things are totally untrue.''
   Mrs. Davis did not attend the news conference.
   Choulos estimated the Davis estate, consisting of a mansion,
antique guns, books and jewelry, is worth $6 million to $8 million.
David died of throat cancer May 16.

   Oscar-winning actress Diane Keaton will debut
as a prime-time TV director in an episode of ABC's ``China Beach.''
   The network Tuesday said Keaton will oversee an installment
about the return home from Vietnam of nurse Colleen McMurphy, the
show's lead character. Keaton will report to the set for eight days
of work on Sept. 5.
   In the episode, McMurphy, played by Emmy-winning actress Dana
Delany, comes home to Kansas after the war and grapples with
civilian life and a drinking problem.
   Keaton's directing credits include the feature film ``Heaven''
in 1987, a music video and a CBS Schoolbreak Special.
   The actress, who has appeared in a number of Woody Allen films
as well as ``Looking for Mr. Goodbar'' and ``The Godfather,'' won
the Academy Award for best actress in 1977 for Allen's ``Annie
Hall.'' Her newest film, ``The Lemon Sisters,'' opens Friday.

   Fans at a Toto concert over the weekend
were infuriated when they discovered the band was not the
Grammy-winning group whose hits included ``Rosanna'' and ``Africa.''
   Singer Bobby Kimball, who left the group in 1984, and a few
other musicians performed at The Starry Night club, said Ellen
Lynch, a spokeswoman for Toto's management company.
   Toto currently features guitarist Steve Lukather, brothers Jeff
and Steve Porcaro and David Paich. All are original members.
   Lynch said Monday that Kimball has used the band's name before.
   ``We've gotten reports all over the country, from Florida and
now the Northwest and Europe,'' Lynch said. ``As far as I know, he
doesn't own any rights to the name. It's now become a huge legal
matter.''
   Kimball's whereabouts were not immediately known.
   Club owner Larry Hurwitz said he will offer refunds or tickets
for another show to those at Saturday's performance.
   ``I feel like I was slightly deceived by Kimball and his
manager,'' Hurwitz said. ``We had 900-plus people and within the
first three songs we had 100 people leave.''

   A random sampling of Saudi female
opinion indicates it's unlikely GIs will be taking home ``Desert
Shield'' brides: they'd need permission from Saudi parents and the
government first.
   And that assumes an American would ever meet a Saudi woman in
this regulated society where females usually cover their bodies,
heads and faces in black, don't drive or drink, never go to
nightspots and often accept arranged marriages.
   Oh yes, and the groom would have to be Moslem.
   Three women _ all professional, full-time workers who have
studied abroad _ said in interviews Tuesday that they accept the
strictures on their conduct as part of their culture and religion.
   ``You might think that we are not free, but the definition of
freedom is different,'' said Nahed Al-Omari, 26, a computer
specialist.
   The women, all of whom were older than the typical unmarried
Saudi, live with their parents or relatives.
   Nahed, dressed in Western clothes and spiked heels under her
abaya, said she would like more freedom _ particularly to drive and
travel _ but was confident the rules would loosen up in the future.
   The women in this male-dominated society did not think the
presence of thousands of American soldiers of both sexes _ the
Desert Shield defense against Iraqi forces in neighboring Kuwait _
would spark broad cultural changes.
   ``Will it have an impact on my life? No,'' said Soulafa
Al-Nasser, 22, a management trainee.
   The women said they would not dare mount a public protest
against the customs for fear it would bring shame on their families.
   ``You could bring the whole family down with you,'' Soulafa said.
   Despite the restricted environment, the women said they resented
the image of all Saudi females as appendages of their men.
   ``Most Saudi females are educated,'' said Nahed. ``Education is
becoming essential for all women.''
   As in the United States, many women continue working after they
have married and had children, the women said. They frequently keep
their own names and have their own bank accounts.
   Finding a husband is the goal of most women, they said, even
though they might have to share the man with his other wives. The
Moslem faith allows men to have four wives.
   But the women doubted strongly they would ever marry an
American. Mixed marriages _ for men and women _ require approval of
the minister of interior.
   But Laila Al-Kholari, a 30-year-old librarian, said she and her
friends might get special treatment because of their age.
   Though their culture is alien to most Americans, the women said
there are benefits to their way of life. Their families were
close-knit, and men viewed their women as ``precious,'' said Laila.
   ``If you could take the best of our culture and the best of
yours, you would have the perfect woman,'' she said.

   Burglars, spies and cheating spouses, beware!
They're plotting your doom at Security Expo.
   Some 350 purveyors are showing off their security devices
through Thursday to a projected 9,000 customers at the trade show,
including corporate security directors, law enforcers and home
security installers.
   Homeowners are the marketing target of Mastervoice of Los
Alamitos, Calif. The company's Butler in a Box offers security and
a whole lot more.
   ``As you wish!'' ``Right away!'' and ``Yes, Master,'' responds
this model of good, old-fashioned electronic servitude, dubbed
Alexander by sales and marketing administrator Linda Zazueta.
   Tell Alexander it's ``party time'' and he'll turn on the porch
lights, hot tub and CD player. Remind him it's ``bedtime'' and
he'll lock up and shut off the lights _ even let the cat out, if
there's an electronic pet door.
   In the morning, he'll start the coffee and turn on the
sprinklers. If burglars enter the house, Alexander asks to ``hear''
their voices. They don't sound familiar, an alarm goes off.
   The butler can be programmed to answer to any name _ and in a
variety of voices. Whimsical homeowners may have their orders taken
by a cowboy or wicked witch. It can understand any language and
recognize commands from up to four people.
   The system, which costs about $5,000 installed, is also a boon
to handicapped people, said Zazueta. About 6,000 to 7,000 were sold
worldwide last year, she said.
   Other customers saw how Surveillance Technology Group, of
London, Paris and Rye, N.Y., hides a ``micro-miniature'' camera
lens in a car or TV antenna, allowing ``totally discreet,
undercover photography and videotaping of virtually anyone or
anything.''
   Carol Products Co. of Ocean, N.J., puts its closed-circuit
cameras inside exit signs, radios, smoke alarms and clocks.
``Please allow one of Carol's video design experts to assist you in
choosing the hidden camera and accessories that best serve your
surveillance needs,'' beckons Carol's glossy, silver-and-lavender
catalog.
   Then there's Communication Control Systems' Security Blanket, a
$200 ultra-bright flashlight ``strong enough to immobilize and
allow you time to escape, yet gentle enough to cause only temporary
blindness,'' its literature says.
   The light is actually a small-ticket item for CCS. The Port
Chester, N.Y., company sells to law enforcers, security firms,
consumers and corporate users who need bulletproof cars or
``discreet recording devices'' hidden in the lid of a leather
briefcase.
   The company's display case contained a 6-inch plastic device
labeled Voice Stress Analyzer. Translation: lie detector.
   ``It's meant to be used covertly,'' mostly by corporate types,
said CCS' Gregg Graison. But, then again, it might fit handily into
a pocket or purse at a singles bar.
   International Electronics Inc. offered a door unlocker that can
record the voices of up to 500 people. It costs $1,200 to $1,400
installed. Enter an ID number, then speak. If it recognizes the
voice, it will open the door.
   But don't tell it to ``Open, Sesame.'' Commands must be three or
four syllables.
   Robert Fuller and Harold Patrick were selling EyeDentify. The
device won't unlock the door unless it recognizes the blood vessels
in the back of the user's eye. Its memory holds up to 1,200 eye
patterns; everyone's is different.
   The company has installed about 500 units worldwide in six years
_ including at the Defense Ministry in Kuwait, said Patrick. The
list price is $4,995 plus installation.

   A judge nearly wept as she gave the Roman
Catholic Church permission to exhume the remains of a former
Haitian slave who has been proposed for canonization as the first
black American saint.
   Acting state Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob on
Tuesday granted the request from the Archdiocese of New York to
exhume Pierre Toussaint's body for identification by a pathologist
and church officials.
   ``It is rare that this court has an opportunity to participate
in such a historic event, if only tangentially,'' the judge said.
   Church records show Toussaint, who died a free man in 1853 at
87, was buried at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   Court papers referred to him as ``a model of charity'' who is
considered the founder of Catholic Charities because he helped the
needy for 66 years when no formal systems of assistance existed.
   Gangel-Jacob said that Toussaint had lived ``a long and
apparently virtuous life,'' giving money to the poor and nursing
the ill during the yellow fever plagues that swept New York City
before antibiotics.
   ``In those times the only consolation may have been the miracles
of faith and trust,'' the judge said, her voice breaking.
   ``Indeed, for the thousands of victims of the scourge of AIDS,
Alzheimer's disease, melanoma and other currently incurable
diseases, the same may be true today.''
   Monsignor Robert O'Connell said the church is investigating two
miracles attributed to Toussaint: a Haitian man's claim he was
cured of lung and stomach cancer by praying to Toussaint, and a
Miami woman's claim he cured her breast cancer.
   The Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome, which is
responsible for canonization, will hold investigations and a
hearing that could take years, O'Connell said.
   Toussaint was born into slavery in Haiti in 1766. At 21, he was
brought to New York by a Frenchman and his family. After the
Frenchman's death, the master's family fell into poverty. Toussaint
secretly supported them for 20 years until the widow remarried and
repaid him by arranging for his freedom.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange dropped
sharply Wednesday after three consecutive trading days of
increases. The dollar closed higher.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 815.97
points, or 3.17 percent, to close at 24,894.79.
   The dollar closed at 144.35 yen, up 1.15 yen from Tuesday's
close of 143.20 yen. After opening at 143.10 yen, the currency
ranged between 142.98 yen and 144.45 yen.
   Securities dealers said the Nikkei index moved lower with local
news reports Wednesday that the Bank of Japan has started
discussing an official discount rate increase with the Finance
Ministry.
   A spokesman for the central bank refused to comment on the
reports.
   The Asahi Shimbun newspaper said the central bank is considering
an increase in its key lending rate by a range of 0.75 to 1.0
percentage points to stem inflationary pressure because of rising
oil prices caused by the Middle East crisis.
   The bank is expected to decide on the rate increase possibly by
early next month. The discount rate, the lending rate the central
bank charges on loans to commercial banks, stands at 5.25 percent,
among the lowest of industrialized countries.
   Higher interest rates tend to make a country's currency more
attractive to investors, but discourage stock investment.
   On the currency market, the dollar slipped in early trading on
speculation about the interest hike but later the currency regained
ground on a market rumor that the central bank did not plan to
raise the discount rate, said Toru Umemoto, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was valued at
$26.50 to $26.80 a barrel, compared with $26.68 dollars a barrel
quoted in London late Tuesday.
   In bond markets, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond slid to 82.18 points, down from Tuesday's
finish of 82.68. The yield stood at 8.310 percent, up from 8.190
percent.

   A huge Air Force plane ferrying equipment to
U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf crashed on takeoff early Wednesday
at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany, and officials said at least
12 people on board were killed.
   Air Force spokesman Doug Moore said the C-5 cargo plane, which
had 17 military personnel aboard, was part of the round-the-clock
deployment of U.S. troops and supplies to Saudi Arabia and the gulf
to deter Iraqi aggression.
   He said 10 on board were killed.
   Air Force officials said later that one of the five people
hospitalized had died of injuries and that they had found the body
of one of two soldiers who had been unaccounted for.
   The plane's cargo included food, medical supplies and aircraft
maintenance equipment, according to Moore. The cause of the crash
was under investigation.
   Ramstein, the largest U.S. Air Force base in Europe, has been a
stopover point for the steady stream of U.S. planes headed to and
from the gulf.
   Another Air Force spokesman, Capt. Ed Worley, said the cargo
plane, headed for Frankfurt's Rhein-Main base, crashed and burned
after takeoff, one-quarter mile from the runway at 12:30 a.m.
Wednesday.
   ``It crashed in a field right off the west end of the runway,''
Worley said by telephone from Ramstein, about 300 miles southwest
of Berlin. ``We don't expect any civilian casualties.''
   Worley said the C-5 belonged to the 60th Airlift Wing at Travis
Air Force Base in California. He said it was flown by a crew from
Kelly Air Force Base in Texas.
   At Kelly, base spokeswoman Maj. Donna Pastor said 10 reservists
with the base's 433rd Military Airlift Wing were aboard the C-5 _
eight crew members and two maintenance personnel. She said the
other seven on the plane were from other Air Force bases in the
United States.
   The 433rd had not been called to active duty, but some
reservists with the wing were voluntarily participating in
Operation Desert Shield after arranging time off from their
civilian jobs.
   The C-5 is the largest transport plane in the Air Force fleet
and costs about $148 million. A military reference book, Jane's All
the World's Aircraft, says the C-5 can carry up to about a
quarter-million pounds of cargo.
   Under Desert Shield, begun after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, the United States and other Western and Arab countries have

<HEAD>Need for Repeat Caesarean Deliveries Questioned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The traditional view that women who have given
birth by Caesarean section must always deliver that way is being
challenged in a new survey.
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said it
found in a survey of 2,213 physicians that 63 percent of women who
attempt vaginal delivery after a previous Caesarean section
succeed. Results of the study were released Tuesday.
   ``Strides certainly have been made'' to persuade women and their
doctors that vaginal deliveries are safe, successful alternatives
to repeat Caesareans, said Dr. Mary Jo O'Sullivan, secretary of the
organization.
   However, O'Sullivan said, because about 42 percent of the
patients surveyed chose to have another Caesarean, ``there is a
need to further educate women'' about the benefits of vaginal
deliveries.
   O'Sullivan, associate chairwoman of obstetrics at the University
of Miami in Florida, said vaginal deliveries are less risky than
Caesarean sections mainly because the latter is a surgical
procedure.
   In addition, she said, vaginal births are less expensive and the
patient spends less time in the hospital _ an average of $4,334 and
two or three days compared with $7,186 and four or five days for a
Caesarean, according to 1989 data from the Health Insurance
Association of America.
   The rate of Caesarean deliveries rose from 5.5 percent of all
U.S. births in 1970 to 24.7 percent in 1988.
   But O'Sullivan noted that the increase from 1986-87 and from
1987-88 was 0.3 percent, the smallest rise in five years.

<HEAD>Federal Court Overturns Eyeglass Ruling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court says the Federal Trade
Commission lacked authority to prohibit states from banning
shopping center stores that combine optometric practice with
eyeglass sales.
   The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on
Tuesday ruled that the FTC had ``acted beyond its statutory
authority'' in its March 1989 ``Eyeglasses II'' ruling last year.
   ``An agency may not exercise authority over states as sovereigns
unless that authority has been unambiguously granted to it,''
Circuit Judge James Buckley wrote in a ruling agreed to by Chief
Judge Patricia Wald and Circuit Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg.
   FTC attorney Lawrence DeMille-Wagman said the commission had not
yet decided whether to appeal.
   The FTC's ruling never took effect because the California State
Board of Optometry and others sought and received a stay from the
appellate court moments after the ruling would have become
effective last Sept. 1, said California Deputy Attorney General
Thomas S. Lasar.
   The states had imposed restrictions that the court said ``tended
to discourage the `commercial practice' of optometry _ such as
partnerships between optometrists and laymen, use of trade names,
and chain operations combining the practice of optometry with the
sale of eyeglasses in shopping centers _ in favor of `traditional
optometric practice' typified by sole practitioners operating in
professional office buildings under their own names.''
   The FTC began investigating the restrictions in the mid-1970s
and in findings published in 1980, ``indicated that these
restrictions resulted in higher prices and reduced the quality of
eye care available to the public,'' Buckley's opinion noted.
   Nine years later, the FTC adopted ``Eyeglasses II,'' even though
FTC Chairman Daniel Oliver voted against it ``based on principles
of federalism and his view that the FTC was without authority to
promulgate it.''

<HEAD>Senator Urges Contacts With Vietnam, Cambodia</HEAD>

   The United States should consider reopening
commerce with communist Vietnam and Cambodia as a prelude to United
Nations-sponsored Cambodian elections, Sen. Richard Lugar says.
   ``We ought to sketch conditions for easing restrictions on
commerce with Vietnam and Cambodia,'' said the Indiana Republican,
who added that developmental loans for Vietnam could be a first
step.
   Lugar, who spoke Tuesday with reporters, has just returned from
a two-week, seven-nation trip to East Asia. In Vietnam, he met with
foreign minister Nguyen Co Thach, who sought to highlight market
reforms made in his country's economy.
   Lugar said he was assured by Thach that all Vietnamese forces
have been withdrawn from Cambodia, where they had fought to push
the feared Khmer Rouge from power.
   He said Vietnam supports current United Nations peace efforts
and would accept any government installed in Cambodia through free
and fair elections. He said also that Vietnam would agree to
continued non-lethal U.S. aid to the non-communist resistance now
fighting the Vietnamese-installed regime of Hun Sen in Phnom Penh.
   Lugar said he found a clear interest among American business
interests in Thailand, Hong Kong and Seoul in reopening commerce
with the two countries, and said other nations already are quietly
doing so.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. David Boren trounced two challengers in Oklahoma's
Democratic primary Tuesday, taking the first step towards
re-election to a third term.
   In the Democratic primary for governor, the Oklahoma's House
speaker and a businessman were locked in a tight battle for first
place. A restaurant chain owner held a strong lead in the five-way
contest for the GOP nomination.
   Republican Gov. Henry Bellmon is stepping down.
   Alaska voters also narrowed the field of candidates seeking to
replace a retiring governor, and Republican Sen. Ted Stevens won
his party's nomination for his fourth full term.
   In Oklahoma, Boren drew 124,237 votes, or 84 percent, with 780
of 2,359 precincts reporting. Perennial candidate Virginia Jenner
had 16,435 votes, or 11 percent, and newcomer Manuel Ybarra had
7,091, or 5 percent.
   Boren will face Republican Stephen Jones, a lawyer.
   In the Democratic gubernatorial primary, House Speaker Steve
Lewis of Shawnee had 54,733 votes, or 34 percent, to 51,704, or 33
percent, for Oklahoma City businessman David Walters, the 1986
nominee, with 815 precincts reporting.
   U.S. Rep. Wes Watkins of Ada, who'd been considered the
front-runner, had 40,319 votes, or 25 percent.
   In the GOP race, restaurant chain owner Vince Orza led with
36,694 votes, or 38 percent, with 806 precincts reporting. Former
U.S. Attorney Bill Price of Oklahoma City had 24,197 votes, or 25
percent, and former Human Services Commission Chairman Burns Hargis
had 17,897, or 19 percent. Truck stop operator Jerry Brown of
Oklahoma City had 12,751 votes, or 13 percent.
   Two other Democratic candidates and one Republican candidate had
5 percent or less of the vote.
   Runoffs will be held Sept. 18 unless one candidate of each party
gets a majority.
   Gambling and marijuana were issues in Alaska, where Democratic
Gov. Steve Cowper declined to seek a second term. The top
Democratic contenders were Lt. Gov. Stephen McAlpine and former
Anchorage Mayor Tony Knowles. Among Republicans, state Sen. Arliss
Sturgulewski was heavily favored to win her second consecutive
nomination.
   Stevens had 22,448 votes, or 71 percent of the vote, with 168
precincts, or 38 percent, counted. He was opposed by Bob Bird, a
high school teacher and anti-abortion activist, who won 8,992
votes. A Democratic primary pitted Tom Taggert, a Hyder resident
who supports legalizing cocaine and Alaska secession, against
perennial candidate Michael Beasley of Eagle River.
   In Oklahoma, Watkins raised a record $1.7 million to help win
the front-runner tag.
   Watkins and Walters accused each other of mudslinging and
negative campaigning. Lewis sought to take advantage of their
fighting with television ads saying he had taken the high road.
   Watkins ran an ad spotlighting newspaper headlines about a
controversial campaign loan Walters made in 1986.
   In his television ads, Walters stressed that he was not ``a
career politician'' and endorsed a state question to restrict
legislators to 12 years in office.
   Walters also chided Watkins for sitting on a pillow during a
televised debate, saying Watkins did that to make himself look
taller.
   Watkins responded that he was ``shocked that Mr. Walters is so
sensitive about his height'' and said the pillow was to ease his
back.
   Alaska is one of three states with an open primary in which all
candidates appear on one ballot regardless of party. Voters are
free to vote in one party in one race and another party in another
race.
   McAlpine tried to paint Knowles as soft on drugs because of the
former mayor's opposition to a measure on the November ballot that
would restore criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of
marijuana. Alaska is the only state that has no criminal penalties
for possessing less than 4 ounces of marijuana at home.
   Two initiatives were on the Alaska ballot: Measure 1 would
change the way the state-owned Alaska Railroad is operated, and
Measure 2 would allow local-option casino gambling. There was
virtually no campaign in support of the gambling measure, and a
poll conduced last week showed voters opposing it 2-to-1.

   Relatives of about 3,000 Americans trapped in Kuwait and Iraq
said they were encouraged by Saddam Hussein's promise to release
women and children today, but they had doubts about whether he
would keep his word.
   ``I'll believe it when I see them home in this state. Until
then, I'm just praying,'' Margaret Nuzum of Hutchinson, Kan., said
Tuesday. Her daughter, son-in-law and their two young children last
got a call through from the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait on Aug. 19.
   Shortly after Saddam's televised meeting Tuesday with foreign
hostages, he decreed that women and children would be free to leave
Iraq today.
   Some Americans said Saddam's TV appearance was a propaganda ploy.
   ``I would love to see my husband,'' said Patricia Hale of
Spring, Texas, whose husband, Edward, is trapped in the Middle
East. ``In another way, I wish they would quit showing them
(American hostages) because it's just propaganda and we're playing
into Hussein's hands.''
   Saddam's vow broke the monotony for relatives who have kept a
monthlong vigil for Americans caught in Iraq or Kuwait. News of
those trapped has been hard to come by since Iraq overran Kuwait on
Aug. 2.
   Kathy Majerek was dealing with housework and two young children
when the television flashed her brother, hostage Kevin Bazner, face
to face with Saddam.
   Just then the State Department called to tell Majerek: Sorry, no
news. ``I told them to take a look at their TV,'' she said from
Ogden, Utah. ``Kevin had the mike for about three minutes. It was
hard to hear, but he said something about a peaceful solution.''
   In the Detroit suburb of Farmington Hills, another of Bazner's
sisters, Patricia Heath, said, ``We're waiting with bated breath
now.''
   She said the family had not heard from Bazner since Aug. 14.
``Hearing him and knowing he is safe and comfortable, of course
that makes me feel good,'' she said.
   When the Gerards of New Harmony, Ind., heard of Saddam's vow,
they reined in their emotions. ``I don't want to be a downer, but
he's said things before. ... He said he was going to let all the
diplomats go,'' said Pauline Gerard. ``Everything hinges on this
... and I don't want to be crushed.''
   Mrs. Gerard had been waiting for good news since her pregnant
sister got trapped while visiting Kuwaiti in-laws. ``I don't want
to get my hopes up too much because I don't want to fall down too
far if it doesn't work out,'' she said.
   Michael Saba, founder of the Coming Home Committee, was more
effusive.
   ``It's just an excellent sign,'' said the Champaign, Ill.,
businessman, who escaped Iraq shortly after the invasion.
   ``Whether the men are soon to follow or whether that's something
that has to be worked out isn't clear, but I'd say the signs are
good,'' he said. ``I think we're seeing some signs that say there's
some ... interest in de-escalating the situation.''
   Saddam also agreed Tuesday to talk to President Bush and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher about ending the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Despite the conciliatory gestures, Baghdad hardened its position
on Kuwait, declaring it a 19th province of Iraq. That concerns Jo
Ellen Buehler, whose sister is married to a Kuwaiti air force
officer.
   ``I'm going to stay excited and keep everyone's spirits as high
as I can because that's all we have to clutch onto,'' Buehler said
from Memphis, Tenn. ``(But) I don't want to jump the gun.''
   Buehler said she's worried that Saddam means only to free the
estimated 500 Americans trapped in Iraq. ``He didn't say anything
about Kuwait,'' said Buehler, who hasn't heard from her sister
since Aug. 3 when she and three young nephews were among about
2,500 Americans stuck in the annexed country. ``What about Kuwait?''

   Students romped in a gym one minute and
huddled in fear for their lives the next as a deadly tornado tore
their school away around them.
   Plainfield High School was razed in the path of a cluster of
tornadoes Tuesday that killed more than 20 people in a eight-mile
swath in northern Illinois.
   At least 175 students were at the school when the tornado
struck. Classes were to have begun today.
   ``All of a sudden we heard a big boom on the roof and then
everybody got down and the roof came off the small gym,'' said
Shawn Mazzoni, who was inside with dozens of students practicing
for fall sports.
   The crash was the only warning for the teachers and students
preparing for the school year. In minutes, winds ripped the
school's roof off and toppled the outside walls.
   Hail and whipping winds were precursors to the tornado, said
Principal Jim Waldorf, who was in the school. Students and teachers
suffered minor injuries, Waldorf said.
   ``I was inside, and things went flying by the window
horizontally,'' one teacher said. She did not give her name.
   Steve Schernerhorn, the soccer coach, said he and a group of
teachers and student athletes crouched in the halls as the roof was
blown off.
   ``We had some very short warnings. We immediately took cover,''
he said. He said about 25 houses near the school were destroyed.
   Cars were flipped over around the school. The roof was scattered
in pieces across the campus. A few interior walls teetered without
support. Broken glass littered the hallways.
   The spot where Mazzoni huddled for cover may have been the only
area left standing. ``The whole big gym fell down,'' he said.
``There was stuff flying all at us. The place where we were at was
the only thing standing still.''

   Hundreds of University of Florida
students left school or demanded answers from police on how to
protect themselves from a serial killer preying on young men and
women in their off-campus apartments.
   ``I don't feel safe here. I'll be back when this is over,'' said
Shirley Sapp as she and a roommate left their apartment Tuesday.
   Police said the victims _ four women and a man attending either
the university or Santa Fe Community College _ were slain in three
attacks since Sunday.
   Police Chief Wayland Clifton said only that the evidence
indicated the slayings were the work of one or two killers. ``I
feel there is a good chance the individual or individuals may still
be in town,'' he said.
   Students armed themselves with pistols, stun guns and Mace, went
home to their parents or took shelter with friends.
   ``My father bought me a gun,'' a student confided, refusing to
give her name out of fear. ``I'll stay for awhile, but I'm thinking
of dropping out for a semester.''
   University President John Lombardi said officials ``thought long
and hard about canceling classes'' but decided not to because those
who didn't go home would be left without ``the safety and support
of the university.''
   Lombardi said all penalties for non-attendance would be
suspended.
   No university official could say how many students had left or
planned to leave, but they did not dispute reports of several
hundred.
   Out of the university's 34,000 students, only about 9,000 live
in university dorms and married-student housing. The rest live
off-campus, most of them in apartments within four or five miles of
the university.
   Student body president Mike Brown joined school officials in
trying to reassure students that they would be safe if ``we just
stick together.''
   ``Be tough. Stay safe by staying in groups,'' he said.
   More than 1,200 students jammed an auditorium to hear Lombardi,
the police chief and others explain what had happened and what
precautions they should take.
   The chief came under fire for holding back information on the
killings and refusing to say whether they were the result of
break-ins.
   ``At least tell us that so we can know what we should do,'' said
Karyn James. ``Here we are, buying all kinds of locks and
deadbolts, and we don't even know whether we should.''
   While some students who live in Florida or nearby were going
home, others expressed concern because they could not.
   Carol McCormac of Scio, Ore., said she and her boyfriend had
moved in with friends of his in Gainesville. ``I just arrived a
week ago,'' said the graduate student in forestry. ``Welcome to
Gainesville.''
   All students, particularly women, were told to call home to
assure their parents they were all right. The school offered
counseling to anyone needing it.

<HEAD>American Journalist Escapes After Being Trapped In Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington Post reporter Caryle Murphy
willingly traveled to Kuwait in late July to cover an unfolding
international news event. She escaped a month later, holding
preciously to her stories and her life.
   When Murphy arrived in Kuwait City, Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein was amassing thousands of troops from his million-man army
along the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border, but still promising he would take
no military action against his tiny neighbor.
   However, in the early morning hours of on Aug. 2, a week after
Murphy's arrival Iraqi soldiers quickly rolled over Kuwait.
   One failed escape attempt and 25 days later, Murphy arrived in
Saudi Arabia after a tense journey across the bleak desert.
   The journalist related her trials in a lengthy article published
in today's Washington Post.
   Despite the turmoil in Kuwait after the invasion, Murphy said
she hadn't expected to be trapped.
   ``... Like most foreigners, I assumed that in a few days time
the borders would be open for those who wanted to leave, and that
the exodus would start. But it never happened,'' she wrote in the
first-person account of the ordeal.
   Murphy recalled that she and two other Western journalists spent
the first week after the invasion conducting interviews on the
streets, in hospitals and over the telephone, ``as if we were
covering any story.'' However, she soon discovered that there was
no way to dispatch material to her newspaper.
   After leaving her hotel to live with an American family, Murphy
decided to flee the country as the two other journalists already
had done.
   Murphy and two other Americans set out by car on the morning of
Aug. 14. They were back in Kuwait City 90 minutes later after being
turned back by Iraqi soldiers.
   But Murphy decided to try again after she learned of a convoy
that was planning to leave at 9 a.m. Monday.
   ``I decided in a minute, mostly by instinct. I reasoned that the
worst that could happen was that I would be detained if the Iraqi's
spotted me,'' she wrote.
   Nearly seven hours later, Murphy arrived at the Saudi border.
Once there, she learned from a U.S. diplomat that she was the first
American to arrive at the outpost in eight days.

   Manuel ``Manny'' Taboada, 23, attended Santa Fe Community
College and planned to transfer to the University of Florida to

   The 6-foot-2 Carol City resident had been a guard on the
football team at American High School in the Miami area, where he
also was a member of the National Honor Society. He graduated in
1984.
   He attended Miami-Dade Community College from 1984 to 1989.
   Taboada, whose father died several years ago, had one older
brother. His mother, Gladys, lives in Miami.
   ``He was just the kind of son that every mother would love to

High.
   Taboada and another victim, Tracy Inez Paules, were friends for

   Miss Paules had been a member of the National Honor Society and
played for the girls' soccer and softball teams at American High.
   ``I talked to her mother one month ago and she said (Tracy)

sang in the church choir and worked in the church's day-care center.
   Her goal was to operate her own day-care center after graduation.
   ``She told me she was going to be sitting in my desk one day,''
said Gail Guyton, First Baptist director of childhood ministries.
   Miss Larson, who graduated with honors from Ely High School in
Pompano Beach, had tried to get into a dormitory at the university

   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 815.97
points, or 3.17 percent, closing at 24,894.79 in light trading. The
index rose 569.00 points on Tuesday after gaining 976 points on
Monday and another 428.13 points Friday.
   Dealers said the Nikkei index began dropping at the start of the
day's trading because of local news reports that the Bank of Japan
would increase its official discount rate, possibly early next
month.
   Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno told a news conference this
afternoon that the central bank was not discussing a discount-rate
hike at the current time with the Finance Ministry.
   The newspaper Asahi Shimbun reported the bank was considering a
hike in its key lending rate by 0.75-1.0 percentage points to stem
inflationary pressures caused by rising oil prices due to the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Prices remain stable at the present time, but higher oil
prices are a new factor in the situation, which must be watched
closely,'' Mieno said at his first news conference since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Mieno said there would be no immediate changes in monetary
policy.
   The central bank governor said he does not expect the rise in
oil prices to undermine Japan's three engines of economic expansion
_ strong spending for housing, capital investment and personal
consumption.
   Japan's discount rate, the interest rate the central bank
charges on loans to commercial banks, now stands at 5.25 percent,
one of the lowest among major industrialized nations.
   Higher interest rates tend to make a country's currency more
attractive to investors, but discourage stock investment.
   But dealers said Mieno's comments would not necessarily boost
stock prices.
   ``The governor's denial of an interest rate hike will not become
a buy factor because the market environment itself remains bad''
because of the stalemate in the Middle East situation, said
Kazuhiro Nomura, a trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   In foreign exchange trading, the dollar closed at 144.35 yen, up
1.15 yen from Tuesday's close of 143.20 yen. After opening at
143.10 yen, the currency ranged between 142.98 yen and 144.45 yen.
Spot volume was about $6.4 billion.
   The dollar slipped in early Tokyo trading on speculation about
the interest rate but later was bought back by a reported denial of
the hike by financial sources, exchange dealers said.
   ``Then the dollar moved higher on short covering, coupled with
cross trading'' in which investors buy European currencies by
selling the yen, said Shigeru Tamaki, a dealer with the Industrial
Bank of Japan.
   In bond trading, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese
government bonds closed at 82.33 points, down from Tuesday's close
of 82.68. Their yield stood at 8.275 percent, up from Tuesday's
8.190 percent.
   Meanwhile, North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was
valued at $26.50 to $26.70 a barrel, compared with $26.68 a barrel
quoted in London late Tuesday. An official at a major Japanese
trading company said today's oil market remained quiet.

<HEAD>Persian Gulf Initiative Thrusts U.N. Chief into Spotlight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
known more for discretion than dynamism, suddenly stepped forward
this week and seized world headlines with a bid to personally
mediate the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The U.N. chief often goes weeks on end without attracting much
notice outside the glass facade of U.N. headquarters, relying on
low-keyed diplomacy to solve conflicts.
   Then came his weekend announcement that he will meet Iraqi
Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz in Amman, Jordan, on Thursday to try to
bring an end to Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and free all the
foreign hostages caught by the Aug. 2 invasion.
   He followed up with a rare news conference Monday and capped
that with live interviews with U.S. television networks on the
evening newscasts.
   Diplomats and U.N. officials pondered this unprecedented
outburst by an official who is fond of the French saying: ``The
melody makes the song, not a loud voice.''
   Up to now, his style has been a study in understatement as he
labored quietly to bring recalcitrant enemies into peace
negotiations.
   He was Peru's ambassador to the United Nations in 1971-75 and
special U.N. representative to Cyprus from 1975-77. In 1979, he
became undersecretary-general for special political affairs.
   U.N. insiders say that as special representative to Afghanistan
in 1981, Perez de Cuellar sketched the framework for the superpower
settlement that led to Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan,
completed last year.
   Perez de Cuellar spent many hours with the Iraqi and Iranian
foreign ministers in 1988 to solidify the U.N.-mandated cease-fire
in their war. The relationship he established with Aziz may prove
useful on Thursday.
   Another long conflict, the guerrilla war in Western Sahara,
appears headed to an end soon after years of unobtrusive U.N.
mediation.
   The new cooperation between the superpowers is the key to the
United Nations' recent successes; Perez de Cuellar owes thanks to
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev for taking the first steps to
end the Cold War.
   For years, East and West tested each other in proxy wars among
their client states and used their veto power in the United Nations
to block effective diplomacy.
   During the ``lean years'' from 1982 to 1986, Perez de Cuellar
could only lay the groundwork for future successes, Brian Urquhart,
the former chief U.N. peacekeeping offical, said in a 1988
newspaper interview.
   In Perez de Cuellar's first year as secretary-general, Argentina
and Britain fought their 74-day Falkland Islands war.
   While that conflict was still going on, Israel invaded Lebanon,
defied Security Council demands for a cease-fire and withdrawal,
and bypassed the 7,000-member U.N. peacekeeping force in southern
Lebanon.
   ``The years 1982 to 1986 were awful; nothing was going right,''
Urquhart said. ``But he used that time to build up a negotiating
position in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq and all those places. When the
climate changed, he was in a position to go forward quickly.''
   U.N. insiders also credit Perez de Cuellar with recruiting a
small, but highly effective circle of key aides to draft U.N.
policy in Cambodia, Latin America, the Middle East, Afghanistan and
other trouble spots.
   He doesn't upstage them by launching unexpected initiatives,
which is why his move this week caught so many U.N. observers off
guard.
   Iraq had dug in its heels, rejecting Security Council
denunciations and calling the world body the ``pawn'' of the United
States. The U.N. chief was away on a South American tour.
   Many wondered why he didn't rush back to headquarters during the
crisis.
   After the Security Council voted Saturday to allow military
force to enforce the economic blockade on Iraq, Perez de Cuellar
suddenly announced his peace initiative and returned to New York.
   While supporting Security Council resolutions demanding
immediate Iraqi withdrawal, he carefully drew a distinction between
his role and that of the council.
   The Security Council, composed of 15 nations, cannot mediate in
a crisis; only the secretary-general can do that, he said.
   Perez de Cuellar was not in his usual seat at the council table
when it passed five resolutions faulting Iraq for its actions. Now
he could offer himself as an honest broker to Iraq.
   Some officials and diplomats believe Perez de Cuellar's new,
higher profile paves the way for his successor to be a more active
international mediator after his term ends in 1992. Perez de
Cuellar has said he will not stand for re-election.

<HEAD>Fighting in East, Army Inches Foreward to Besieged Fort in North</HEAD>

   Troops and helicopter gunships killed
34 Tamil rebels in the east while government troops in the north
inched forward along a heavily mined causeway toward a
rebel-besieged fort, officials said today.
   By the eighth day of the government's offensive against the
Tamil Tiger guerrillas, the army was about two-thirds of a mile
from Jaffna Fort, where 250 soldiers and police have been
surrounded by rebels for 10 weeks, the military officials said.
   They said progress had been slow because the Tigers had blown up
three culverts on the causeway leading across Jaffna lagoon to the
star-shaped fort, located on the northern tip of this Indian Ocean
island nation.
   Government troops have moved about one-fourth of the way up the
causeway, according to the officials, who cannot be identified
under briefing rules.
   In the east, fighting was reported in several areas as the
Tigers pressed their 7-year-old campaign to carve a Tamil state out
of the predominantly Sinhalese island nation.
   Gunships killed 14 Tigers preparing an attack on a Sinhalese
village in the Ampara area, the military officials said. They said
the rebels had already killed a soldier and wounded two other
soldiers and three policemen when the gunships opened fire.
   Nine more Tigers were killed in a government ambush in the
northeastern port city of Trincomalee, the officials said. In
addition, 11 Tigers, one Tamil civilian and one soldier were killed
in a series of clashes along the east coast, they said.
   The government did not indicate whether there had been new
casualties in the north. The Jaffna reports could not be verified
since communications with the north were cut after the Tigers broke
a 13-month-old cease-fire on June 11.
   The Tigers themselves issue statements only periodically,
usually from exile offices in Europe.
   The government offensive to break the siege of Jaffna Fort has a
far greater symbolic value than any practical military application.
   Even before the siege started, the government garrison inside
the fort was not free to move into Jaffna town, the chief
stronghold of the Tigers.
   Except for a couple other isolated government posts, the entire
Jaffna peninsula is held by Tigers.
   About 850,000 Tamils live on the peninsula 185 miles northeast
of Colombo, the capital.
   At least 14,000 people have died in the Tamil insurrection,
which began in 1983.
   Tamil militants say they need a separate homeland because they
are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who control the Sri
Lankan government and the military.
   Sinhalese make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people;
Tamils comprise 18 percent. Most other Sri Lankans are Moslems, who
trace their descent from Arab seafarers.

   Syrian troops have put down violent
pro-Iraqi demonstrations in cities along the eastern border with
Iraq, killing dozens of people, Arab diplomats and security sources
reported today.
   Diplomats described a massive deployment of troops _ perhaps
more than 50,000 _ to maintain tense order in the southwest along
the border with Iraq.
   Western embassies in Damascus, the Syrian capital, could not
immediately be contacted by telephone. Syria's state-controlled
media has made no mention of any trouble.
   But the sources, speaking on condition they not be named, said
crowds of Syrians poured into the streets of eastern towns on
Sunday to protest President Hafez Assad's stand against Iraq.
   People waved Iraqi flags and huge portraits of President Saddam
Hussein, Iraq's strongman.
   Assad and Saddam have been locked in a bitter ideological feud
for more than a decade. The two countries are ruled by rival wings
of the Baath Socialist Party.
   Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2, Assad has sent at
least 1,100 troops to join an Arab expeditionary force gathering in
Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom from the Iraqis.
   Saddam's army is confronting a major buildup by U.S. and other
forces in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region.
   The diplomats said some of the weekend demonstrators demanded
that the eastern sector of Syria separate from Damascus to be
merged with Iraq.
   ``Troops tried all day to stop the demonstrations and reports
from our Damascus embassy said dozens of people were killed,'' a
senior diplomat said.
   By Monday, the rioting had been put down, but the mood remained
explosive, he said.
   Diplomats and intelligence sources from other Arab states
confirmed the information.
   Assad postponed a scheduled trip to Egypt on Sunday without
explanation, but he flew to the Egyptian city of Alexandria Tuesday
for a day of talks with President Hosni Mubarak.
   The violence appears to be the worst outbreak of political
unrest in Syria since February 1982, when Assad mercilessly crushed
a Moslem Brotherhood uprising in the city of Hama, north of
Damascus.
   Assad's troops razed parts of the city in three weeks of
fighting in which thousands of people were killed.
   The sources regarded the outbreak of violence in Syria as a
serious threat to Assad, a former air force commander who has held
a ruthless grip on the country since he seized power in November
1970.
   The diplomats also saw the trouble as evidence of Saddam's
growing appeal to the Arabs generally in favor of his stand against
U.S. and allied forces in the Persian Gulf.
   Travelers arriving in Jordan from Syria reported clear signs of
high tension. But none who had visited the turbulent eastern part
of the country was prepared to speak with reporters.
   ``I know nothing. I can't say anything,'' one trucker said,
hurrying away, visibly frightened.

   Iraqi tea drinkers may soon be looking
at empty glasses.
   Bangladesh, adhering to a U.N.-ordered ban on trade with Iraq as
punishment for its invasion of Kuwait, has barred Iraqi agents from
its tea auctions.
   Sri Lanka, which wants to continue selling tea to its biggest
customer, says Iraq made only minimal purchases at Monday's tea
auction and none at all on Tuesday.
   Tea, sipped sweet and dark from small glasses, is the most
popular drink in Iraq.
   Bangladesh barred Iraq from participating in Tuesday's tea
auction at the port city of Chittagong, a Tea Board official said
today, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Iraq is Bangladesh's fourth-largest tea customer and normally
buys about 10,000 tons of the country's crop each year.
   In Sri Lanka, which welcomes Baghdad's tea trade, Iraq purchased
only 100 tons at Monday's auction _ one-fifth its usual level _ and
made no bids on Tuesday, Tea Board Chairman Sepala Illangakoon
said. This prompted fears the Iraqi market may be drying up.
   Iraq, said to be feeling the effects of the international trade
embargo, purchased 30,000 tons of Sri Lankan tea last year.
   Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are among Iraq's biggest tea suppliers.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Praise Handling of Gulf Crisis, But No `Blank Check'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are praising President
Bush's handling so far of the Middle East crisis, but some who
interrupted their summer break for a presidential briefing are wary
about the future.
   ``I don't think there's a question of a blank check here'' for
the president, said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. But
during an hour-long meeting Tuesday with Bush and top aides,
``there were really no overall reservations'' by the 170 or so
lawmakers present, he said.
   Both Democrats and Republicans were effusive about Bush's
diplomacy: the garnering of international support for an economic
boycott of Iraq, the winning of United Nations backing for military
enforcement of the blockade and his enlistment of Arab military
forces in the regional show of strength.
   ``For the moment, among professional politicians, there is a
sense of awe at how brilliantly Bush has handled this,'' said Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House minority whip.
   Congress will continue to support Bush's actions ``provided that
we do not get into a protracted struggle where the goals are not
clear, where there's loss of life and there does not seem to be an
opportunity for victory,'' said House Majority Whip William Gray,
D-Pa.
   But there were worries, as well. ``There was concern about where
the line in the sand is,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich. ``There
is no sense of how long it will last.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said merely getting Hussein and his
forces out of Kuwait will not be enough. ``I think that leaves us
in a very unsatisfactory situation,'' Lugar said on ``CBS This
Morning.''
   ``We are left at that point with Saddam Hussein building
potential nuclear weapons, having chemical capability which he has
used before, an enormous army that could be a threat once again
very rapidly. It seems to me important that Saddam Hussein must
either leave or be removed. Likewise, those nuclear facilities and
the chemical facilities should be destroyed,'' Lugar said.
   Others said Bush avoided the crucial question of whether the
Iraqi president can remain in power in his own country even if he
pulls out of Kuwait, which his forces overran on Aug. 2.
   ``I am concerned about what it is that we want to leave there,''
said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J. ``What happens when all this is
over? I think it's very important that (Iraq's) military machine be
rendered inoperative before we can call this mission a success.''
   Other lawmakers said they believe the administration intends to
wait for Saddam's own people to overthrow him, or that the world
will rely on a long-term multinational peacekeeping force to rein
in Iraq.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said he worries about the lopsided
nature of the international force in Saudi Arabia.
   ``The Germans think they have constitutional problems in sending
troops outside the NATO area. The Japanese just send cash,'' said
Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations foreign operations
subcommittee. ``If we don't watch it, we'll have a 90 or 95 percent
share of the on-the-ground troops. I don't think that's politically
sustainable at home.''
   Some participants in Tuesday's briefing _ noting that the
Pentagon doubled its estimate of the cost so far of the troop
deployment to at least $2.5 billion from $1.18 billion _ said money
was a growing factor.
   ``As time goes on, there's going to be a strain,'' said Rep. Amo
Houghton, R-N.Y., a member of the House Budget Committee.
   But Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said on CBS that ``the price tag
of not doing what we're doing would have been even greater, both in
lives as well as money.''
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Congress and
the president may have to scale back by as much as $15 billion the
amount they hope to shave from the budget deficit next year.
   Some of that cost must be shouldered by U.S. allies who are even
more dependent on Middle Eastern oil than the United States _ Japan
and West Germany in particular, they said. Bush told the lawmakers
he was working on just such a cost-sharing arrangement,
participants reported.
   Another concern, voiced during the closed-door meeting by Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee, was that Bush has failed to articulate a national energy
policy that can cope with the uncertainty the gulf crisis creates.
   Dingell said the country has no plan to encourage domestic oil
production, no program to increase conservation and alternative
energy sources and no standby rationing plan. ``I must say, the
president's response on that wasn't the strongest,'' said Rep. Norm
Dicks, D-Wash.
   Foley said Congress will expect to be kept informed of
developments in the region, and it became clear that lawmakers will
take a more active role in the crisis in the coming weeks.
   Two bipartisan delegations, one from the House and one from the
Senate, are preparing to leave Friday for visits in Saudi Arabia,
Egypt and other Middle Eastern countries to review the U.S.
military deployment firsthand.

   President Corazon Aquino today
reversed a long-held policy and said she was willing to negotiate
cease-fires with Communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have
staged coup attempts.
   Mrs. Aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks,
including her most outspoken critic, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile.
   Manila has been rocked by almost daily explosions. Although no
one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the government has
blamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppled
Mrs. Aquino in coup attempts.
   The Communist rebels have been waging a 21-year rebellion to
establish a Marxist state. The last cease-fire with them collapsed
in early 1987.
   Sen. Wigberto Tanada called for a truce between the government
and the Communist rebels after a major earthquake in the
Philippines on July 16, but Mrs. Aquino rejected the proposal.
   On Tuesday, a pro-Aquino senator, Orlando Mercado, urged Mrs.
Aquino to put aside differences with her political foes and begin
to discuss the nation's security problems and economic woes.
   Enrile said he was willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, who
fired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coup
attempt in November 1986.
   Mrs. Aquino said in a statement today that Mercado and Enrile
are welcome to join discussions now being held by a committee of
Cabinet members.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos has adamantly refused any
cease-fire with the Communist guerrillas since November 1986 when
the Aquino government negotiated with the rebels during a 60-day
truce.
   Ramos, a member of the Cabinet committee, has been credited with
crushing six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino.
   Communists have accused him of whipping up threats of another
coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino so that the civilian leadership
would become indebted to him. Ramos has denied all allegations.
   The last cease-fire with the rebels collapsed in January 1987
after troops fired on farmers demonstrating outside Mrs. Aquino's
office for land reform.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Import Ban over Dolphin Kill</HEAD>

   A federal judge has ordered a ban on
imports of tuna caught by five nations until they can show that
they are not killing more dolphins than U.S. law allows.
   U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson on Tuesday said the Bush
administration had given foreign fleets too much time to comply
with a 1988 federal law requiring an embargo of any nation whose
dolphin-killing rate was more than twice the rate of the U.S. tuna
fleet.
   The law provided for an embargo at the end of 1989 unless the
Commerce Department had determined that a nation's dolphin kill
rate was under the limit, Henderson said. The department contended
it was entitled to evaluate figures submitted by each nation from
1989, an assessment that has not been completed.
   ``Under the agency's interpretation, it is the dolphins and
domestic fishermen, not the foreign governments, who bear the
burden of the foreign governments' late production of evidence,''
Henderson wrote.
   ``The continued slaughter and destruction of these innocent
victims of the economics of fishing constitutes an irreparable
injury to us all.''
   August Felando, president of the American Tunaboat Association,
the largest group of U.S.-flagged tuna boats, said the embargo
could have serious consequences.
   ``What it can do is really disrupt the supply of tuna to the
U.S. canners,'' Felando said. ``The U.S. fishermen cannot supply
all the tuna that's required for the U.S. market.''
   He said foreign boats caught 46 percent of the light-meat tuna
canned by U.S. companies last year, and all of the foreign-canned
tuna, which made up about a third of the U.S. market.
   The embargo affects the nations whose boats use nets to catch
yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific _ Mexico, Panama, Venezuela,
Ecuador and the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu.
   Some commercial fishing fleets deliberately drop their nets on
dolphins, which swim above yellowfin tuna. To limit the deaths of
dolphins caught in the nets, U.S. law requires posting of observers
on tuna boats to monitor preservation efforts.
   U.S. law cannot directly regulate foreign fishing practices in
international waters. The law, amended most recently in 1988,
forbids imports of tuna caught by nations that do not meet
prescribed limits for their dolphin kills: twice the U.S. rate by
the end of 1989, and 1.25 times the U.S. rate by the end of 1990.
   A National Marine Fisheries Service official testified to
Congress last month that foreign dolphin kills last year rose by
over 40 percent to 84,000, while U.S. kills dropped to 12,643.
   The Commerce Department argued that the law required it only to
compile information from foreign governments, which was submitted
by a July 31 deadline, and decide whether each country met the
legal standard.
   But an environmental group called the Earth Island Institute
contended the law required an embargo of any nation that had not
shown it met the limit by the end of last year, and Henderson
agreed.
   Henderson said an embargo should have gone into effect at the
end of 1989, to be lifted only as the Commerce Department
determined, based on documentary evidence from each nation, that
its dolphin kill rate was below the limit.
   The United States, the only country that regulates dolphin
mortality in connection with fishing, allows a maximum of 20,500
deaths and stations observers on board all U.S.-flagged vessels to
verify the number of deaths.

   The Montana Supreme Court on Tuesday upheld
the drunken driving arrest of a man who was stopped while pushing
his disabled motorcycle down a street.
   Although Ronald D. Turner was not driving the bike and its
engine was not operating, he was in control of the vehicle and
subject to the law requiring motorists to submit to a breath test,
the court said in its unanimous ruling.
   Turner, 36, was on his way home from a bar in Lewistown last
Sept. 19, and pushing a motorcycle with a broken clutch when he was
arrested. He did not get on the bike or start the engine, but did
turn on the headlight, the court said.
   A police officer said he refused to take a breath test by only
blowing half-heartedly into the machine. His license was suspended
for three months.

   Hurricane Gustav continued losing strength over the
open Atlantic this morning, with top winds down to 80 mph a day
after boasting 105 mph gusts, the National Hurricane Center
reported.
   ``It's getting weaker, we're looking at a little change, perhaps
a slight weakening the next couple of days,'' said Ray Fagen, a
hurricane specialist at the center in suburban Coral Gables.
   ``Right now, Gustav's heading generally towards Bermuda,'' he
said. ``But that's four days away, and it's too soon to know what
the effect, if any, there'll be on Bermuda.''
   There was only ``a remote chance'' the hurricane would veer
towards the U.S. East Coast during its trek northward, Fagen said.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Gustav's center was located near 23.6 degrees
north latitude and 57.6 west longitude, or about 750 miles
southeast of Bermuda. It was moving northward at about 10 mph and
was expected to hold that course and speed for the next 24 hours.
   Earlier in the week, Gustav skirted the Leeward Islands in the
northeastern Caribbean, where hurricane warnings posted during the
weekend were dropped Monday.
   Tropical storm Hortense, about 1,000 miles apart in the
mid-Atlantic, also posed no threat to land.
   At 6 a.m., Hortense was moving northwest near 10 mph and had
winds of 60 mph. The storm was centered near 24.5 degrees north
latitude and 46.8 degrees west longitude, or about 1,450 miles
west-northwest of the Cape Verde islands.
   The storm was expected to lose strength over the next two days,
according to the hurricane center.
   Hortense, the eighth named storm of the Atlantic season, and
Gustav were born as tropical depressions near the Cape Verde
archipelago off West Africa.
   Tropical depressions become named storms when their sustained
top winds reach 39 mph. Tropical storms become hurricanes at 74
mph. The Atlantic hurricane season runs through November.

   A chameleon that starred in a
political commercial was worked to death, the director of an
animal-rights group contends.
   Peter Hamilton, head of Lifeforce, said Tuesday the reptile was
treated ``callously'' during an eight-hour shoot. The chameleon
died after playing the feature role in a pre-election ad sponsored
by the Socred party.
   In the ad, intended to show inconsistency in the New Democratic
Party, the chameleon changes color with each conflicting NDP
statement.
   The Socreds say the reptile's death probably was unrelated to
the commercial.
   ``We were told that the animal had some sort of health
problems,'' said Jess Ketchum, Socred director of operations.
Ketchum estimates the animal spent only about 15 minutes under the
lights.

<HEAD>New Appeal for Bombing Convicts; Discrepancies in Police Records</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing new questions about police evidence, the
government today ordered the Court of Appeal to review the
convictions of six Irishmen serving life sentences for bombings
that killed 21 people.
   It was a victory for the so-called Birmingham Six in a prolonged
campaign to prove they were unjustly convicted of the 1974 Irish
Republican Army bombings.
   The Home Office said apparent discrepancies were found in police
notes of an interview with one of the convicts, Richard McIlkenny.
Scientific tests indicated that some pages were written at
different times, it said.
   Home Secretary David Waddington, the Cabinet minister
responsible for law enforcement, ordered all six convictions
referred to the Court of Appeal, according to a Home Office
statement.
   ``This is very good news,'' Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey
said in Dublin. Relations between Britain and Ireland have been
strained by the Birmingham Six and other British court cases
involving IRA activities.
   Five of the six men were arrested Nov. 21, 1974, a few hours
after the bombings, as they were about to board a ferry to Belfast,
Northern Ireland for the funeral of an IRA man.
   McIlkenny, Johnny Walker, Patrick Hill, Hugh Callaghan, Gerry
Hunter and Billy Power were convicted of murder for bombing two
pubs in Birmingham, killing 21 people and injuring 162. All six
were jailed for life in 1975.
   They were refused the right to appeal in 1976 and failed in a
1977 lawsuit against investigating officers for assault. A decade
later the government acknowledged the doubts about their
convictions by referring the case to the Court of Appeal, but the
verdicts were in 1988.
   ``Let's hope this time it works for us,'' said McIlkenny's wife,
Kate, who lives in Birmingham.
   ``I hope that the court will deal with the case speedily in
order that this great scandal may be brought to an end as soon as
possible,'' said Chris Mullin, a member of Parliament who wrote a
book about the case.
   Mullin, of the opposition Labor party, claims he has met IRA
members who admitted carrying out the Birmingham attack.
   The bombings were the deadliest ever by the IRA in England in
its campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland.
   The Birmingham Six case is the last of three major trials of
suspected IRA guerrillas from the 1970s to be returned to the
appeal courts following vigorous public campaigns claiming their
innocence.
   Three men and a woman convicted of killing six people in
bombings in Guildford and Woolwich in 1975 were freed by the Court
of Appeal in October. Six other people convicted in a related case
of operating an IRA bomb factory are awaiting an appeal hearing,
after Waddington announced in June that the convictions were
``unsafe.''
   In March, Waddington asked the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary
to investigate certain undisclosed points raised by defense
attorneys.
   As part of that investigation, the police carried out
electrostatic deposition tests on records of the West Midlands
police force, whose detectives investigated the Birmingham bombings.
   A year ago, West Midlands Chief Constable Geoffrey Dear
suspended two detectives and reassigned 53 members of the Serious
Crime Squad after electrostatic deposition tests indicated that
records had been falsified in cases going back to 1986.
   The appeal by the Guildford and Woolwich defendants also hinged
on questions about police documentation. Prosecutors admitted that
officers had lied about the timing of a statement by one of the
defendants.
   Supporters of the Birmingham Six argue that their confessions
contradict one another, that police tampered with logs to make
statements appear consistent, that forensic evidence was flawed and
that there was no witness who testified to seeing any of the men in
the two pubs.
   Their cause had been taken up by Amnesty International, the
Irish government and leading Irish and British political and
clerical figures.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today that Japan
will not transport soldiers or weapons to aid the international
force in the Persian Gulf, but he pledged money, medical personnel
and non-military supplies.
   Japan's assistance package, unveiled in a nationally televised
speech, appeared to fall short of the aid level sought by the
United States, which has deployed tens of thousands of troops to
Saudi Arabia since the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Although Japan quickly joined the trade embargo against Iraq,
further response was slowed by debate over what action was
permissible under Japan's post-World War II constitution, which
bars the use of force in settling international disputes.
   Under the plan, Kaifu said Japan will use civilian airplanes and
ships to transport food, water and medical supplies to the gulf.
Japan also promised to send about 100 medical personnel.
   Turkey, Egypt and Jordan were singled out for ``substantial
economic assistance,'' according to a copy of the package. Tens of
thousands of foreigners fleeing Kuwait and Iraq have made their way
to Jordan.
   The only specific amount mentioned was $10 million to aid
refugees who have fled to Jordan. The package did not give a
timetable for the aid.
   The package did not include increased funding for U.S. troops in
Japan.
   There was no immediate reaction from the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo
on the annoucement.
   But U.S. officials have indicated President Bush is hoping
allies such as Japan will help share the cost of the military
buildup in the gulf.
   In comments to Japanese reporters Tuesday night, U.S. Ambassador
to Japan Michael H. Armacost urged Tokyo to help transport soldiers
and weapons, said the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the country's leading
economic newspaper.
   Earlier today, Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto said
there was no link between the aid package and about 440 Japanese
being detained in Iraq.
   He told a news conference that holding the captives was ``a
sheer violation of international law.''
   Iraq and Kuwait together supplied Japan with about 11 percent of
its oil in the first quarter of 1990. Japan, which imports
virtually all its oil, relies on the Middle East for about 70
percent of its needs.

   Rescue workers alternated between
exhilaration at finding the living beneath beams and shattered
glass and despair over holding dead children in their arms as they
dug through the rubble left by tornadoes.
   ``It will be many nights before I have a good night's sleep
again,'' said Will County Executive Charles Adelman, who helped
comb a cornfield next to the Crest Hill Lake apartment complex.
   At least eight died at the complex Tuesday as tornadoes skipped
through several northern Illinois towns, killing at least 24 people
in Joliet, 40 miles southwest of Chicago, neighboring Crest Hill,
and Plainfield to the Northwest. At least 293 people were treated
at hospitals.
   Four of the dead, including a 4-month-old baby, were found flung
into the cornfield next to the nine-building apartment complex.
   ``People were literally blown out of the building,'' said Crest
Hill Mayor Don Randich. Two of the dead were found in cars nearby
and two others were found in the building's rubble.
   Six of the apartment buildings were gutted and three had parts
of their roofs blown away. Clothing, cars and appliances were
strewn across the landscape.
   ``When the storm went through ... some of the buildings were
disintegrated,'' said Lockport Fire Chief Dave Martis, who was in
charge of the rescue effort at the site.
   At least 150 volunteer rescue workers rushed to the site,
including officers from more than 30 area police and fire
departments, said Plainfield Police Chief Don Bennett.
   Rescuers went from apartment to apartment, throwing rubble off
of the three-story buildings with shovels _ or just their hands.
   Workers searched each building twice, sifting through debris
until well after dark.
   Volunteers aided by dogs, floodlights, cranes and bulldozers
looked for bodies. A National Guard helicopter shone a floodlight
on the cornfield.
   Though some workers wanted to keep looking through the night,
Martis called off the effort at 9:30 p.m. He said it was too dark
and dangerous to continue.
   National Guardsmen and fire officials resumed the search today.
   In Joliet, four people died, including three in a subdivision
where some houses were still under construction, said Joliet Police
Chief Dennis Nowicki.
   ``I had a little baby die in my arms ... and a little girl,''
said a Joliet paramedic who did not identify himself. ``The last
thing she said was she wanted her mommy, and her mommy was laying
there next to her dead, too.''

<HEAD>Sales of New Homes Fell 2.3 Percent in July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sales of new homes fell 2.3 percent in July,
giving up half of their gain the previous month, the government
said today in a report showing continuing weakness in the housing
industry.
   The Commerce Department said new home sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 548,000 after advancing a revised 4.7
percent in June. The department originally reported June sales up 8
percent.
   The continuing weakness was further illustrated by the
department's downward revision in the May sales figure as well _
last month's reported 2.3 percent gain was reduced to just 0.6
percent today.
   Until May, new home sales had declined for five straight months.
For the first seven months of the year, they have fallen 12.4
percent below the pace of 1989.
   The department also said inventories of new homes showed a
7.8-month backlog at the July sales pace. It had been 7.7 months in
June.
   Analysts have attributed the weakness in the industry to high
interest rates, consumer caution because of adverse economic news
and a glutted market.
   The National Association of Realtors reported on Monday that
sales of existing homes, which represent about 80 percent of the
housing market, rose 3.3 percent in July after advancing 0.9
percent in June.
   But the June advance had been the first in seven months and
analysts predicted more declines because of rising mortgage rates
resulting from the Mideast crisis.
   After peaking at 10.67 percent in March, fixed-rate, 30-year
mortgages fell to 9.98 percent by the end of July, according to the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. But by last Friday, rates had
moved up to 10.29 percent.
   Commerce said the median price of a new home fell 4.7 percent in
July to $121,000. The median price means half of the homes cost
more and half less. The median price of an existing home that month
was $98,400, according to the Realtors.
   Sales in the Northeast, which have been sluggish for more than a
year, fell 10.1 percent to an annual rate of 80,000 units. The
department also revised the June increase downward, from 36.9
percent to 25.3 percent.
   Sales also fell in the West, down 4.9 percent to 135,000 units
while they were unchanged at 237,000 units in the South.
   Sales rose 2.1 percent to 96,000 units in the Midwest.

   Mail service to Iraq and Kuwait has been
suspended, the U.S. Postal Service announced today.
   Mail service was halted because of transportation problems in
reaching the two countries since the Iraqi invcaion of Kuwait,
officials said.
   Until further notice all international mail destined for the two
countries will be returned to the sender marked ``service
temporarily suspended,'' postal officials said.
   People who receive returned mail can file applications for a
refund of postage.
   Mail service to military personnel deployed in Saudi Arabia and
mail to other areas of the Middle East continues as normal.
   To date, postal officials say, they have moved 110,000 pounds of
cards and letters to service personnel in the region. That would
amount to about 1.5 million cards and letters.

   Up to 50,000 people who bought microwave
ovens thinking they were new when they weren't can get refunds from
the Maytag Corp.
   U.S. District Judge Robert B. Propst gave initial approval to
the Maytag offer, but set an Oct. 19 hearing to allow any
objections from the buyers of the Magic Chef ovens.
   Since January 1987, Maytag's Anniston plant has repackaged or
reconditioned ovens that customers had returned. The company then
sold the ovens as new for $80 to $160.
   In the agreement, Maytag, parent company of Magic Chef, denied
any liability but agreed to halt the practice and to offer refunds
of $35 to people who bought the ovens, primarily through Wal-Mart
stores. The refunds would be cash payments of $25 and a $10
certificate toward the purchase of a Magic Chef product.
   Maytag also agreed to pay $100,000 to the Alabama attorney
general's office, which filed one of the three lawsuits, and up to
$200,000 to the Birmingham law firm that filed two others.

<TEXT>
   The government today expelled two Iraqi
officials in retaliation for Iraq's decision to close Morocco's
Embassy in Kuwait, move its diplomats to Baghdad and hold them as
hostages.
   Morocco's action came two days after the United States ordered
the expulsion of 36 Iraqi diplomats in Washington and limited the
travel of the 19 allowed to remain.
   Deputy Foreign Minister Ahmed Cherkaoui told the Iraqi Embassy
in Rabat that the two officials of Iraq's ruling Baath political
party were no longer welcome in this North African country, the
official MAP news agency reported.
   The Iraqis are Issa Salmane Hamid and Hicham Hassan Ahmed, both
attached to the Iraqi Embassy and responsible for the Baath Party's
African affairs desk.
   Cherkaoui expressed the government's ``profound displeasure''
over the treatment of Morocco's diplomats in Kuwait, MAP reported.
   On Tuesday, Morocco said diplomats at its embassy in Kuwait were
physically forced to leave their mission, taken to Baghdad and
detained. The Foreign Ministry said it considered the diplomats
hostages.
   Iraq last week ordered all embassies in Kuwait to shut down,
saying the emirate _ which it overran on Aug. 2 _ is now part of
Iraq. Many foreign governments, including the United States, have
defied the shutdown order, saying that would be a step toward
recognizing the annexation of Kuwait.
   Along with Egypt, Morocco has spoken out strongly against the
conquest of Kuwait and has sent ground forces to Saudi Arabia as
part of the multinational military effort to deter further Iraqi
aggression.

   Forty-seven women and
children from the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait are back in the United
States, their joy at a safe homecoming mixed with anxiety for sons,
husbands and fathers held hostage in Baghdad.
   ``God bless America,'' one of the embassy wives said as the 20
women and 27 children stepped down from a chartered jet on Tuesday.
Many of the children clutched stuffed bears.
   Luz Marina Colwell, wife of the U.S. consul in Kuwait, William
Colwell, choked back tears on the tarmac at Andrews Air Force Base
near Washington as she told how the group stuck together on its
desert odyssey.
   ``During the present crisis we learned to know each other, to
care for each other and we became a big family,'' she said.
   ``But our hearts are left in Kuwait and Baghdad (Iraq) with all
our husbands, members of our families, our private American
citizens and members of the international community left behind,''
said Ms. Colwell, the only member of the group to speak to
reporters on hand for the plane's arrival.
   ``We had to keep being strong and keep our hearts very high. God
bless America,'' she said.
   The weary group boarded buses bound for a local hotel.
   Earlier Tuesday, the State Department said Iraqi authorities had
taken nine more Americans into custody.
   Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said six Americans were
arrested in Iraq and three in Kuwait since Monday, bringing the
total to 70 _ 48 in Iraq and 22 in Kuwait.
   Iraq told the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that a 56-year-old
American man died of a heart attack in the port city of Basra.
Iraqi officials also told the embassy they plan to expel an
unspecified number of American diplomats in response to the State
Department decision to order 36 Iraqi Embassy staff members out of
the United States by Thursday.
   The U.S. action was prompted by an Iraqi demand that the United
States and other countries close their embassies in Kuwait.
   The dead American, who was not immediately identified, was in
Iraqi custody at the time he died. Ms. Tutwiler said Iraqi
officials have agreed to conduct an autopsy, and U.S. officials
wanted a physician chosen by the embassy to be present.
   The death ``underscores the barbaric nature of Iraqi policy
towards foreign nationals in Iraq and Kuwait, and makes a lie of
Iraq's claim that they are all well treated and in no danger,'' the
spokeswoman said.
   Tuesday's arrival at Andrews ended a frightening voyage that
began last week in Kuwait, when most of the embassy's staff and
dependents drove to Baghdad. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and a
skeleton staff remained behind in the face of President Saddam
Hussein's order that all foreign missions in Kuwait be closed.
   Baghdad was to be just a point of transit for the group, but
Iraqi authorities ordered all the men to stay behind. Women and
children were allowed to drive in a 13-car convey to Turkey, where
they arrived late Sunday after a 20-hour crossing of desert and
mountains.
   At the border, three sons of U.S. diplomats were turned back by
Iraqi officials because they were over 18.
   Five of the 52 who arrived at the border did not make the flight
to Washington. A State Department official said the five dropped
off en route and went to other destinations, presumably in Europe.
   The Washington Post today quoted an attendant on the flight from
Paris, Alex Kreth, as saying the passengers cried when they left on
the final flight home, cheered when they were told they had crossed
into U.S. airspace and hugged each other when the plane landed.
   The Post said one woman who returned from Kuwait had brought
home a 7-month-old girl but had to leave her husband behind. Her
sister-in-law was quoted as saying, ``You have mixed feelings.
You're happy to have her back, but sad that she left her husband.''
The family did not give its name.
   For the second day in a row, Ms. Tutwiler said the State
Department had received reports of more Americans fleeing Iraq and
Kuwait.
   Two weeks ago, the department estimated that there were 2,500
Americans in Kuwait and 500 in Iraq who were not free to leave.
Those numbers are out of date, but the department has refused to
provide new figures or say how many have escaped.

   A wine festival should be upbeat, say
its sponsors, so Mothers Against Drunk Driving can't parade images
of death.
   MADD's display was to have featured car parts, alcohol
containers and mounds of dirt topped with headstones for the Sept.
8 parade of the Michigan Wine and Harvest Festival.
   The MADD float was turned down for the second straight year
because its sobering theme wasn't consistent with the rest of the
parade, Chairman Brian Caplan said.
   ``I really don't care if the whole audience at the festival gets
drunk,'' said Michael Hughes, president of the Kalamazoo County
MADD chapter. ``I'm worried about when they get behind the wheel.''
   Hughes ``was told this is a festival to celebrate the wine and
harvest, not to offend people,'' Caplan said. ``If MADD believes
this is effective, they can do it on their own. It's not
appropriate for a parade.''

<TEXT>
   A presidential committee
investigating the death of an army commander during a heroin
``sting'' operation cleared three U.S. drug agents today but
recommended that four police officers be prosecuted.
   The July 10 slaying of Col. Rolando de Guzman and two other men
increased tensions between the military and police, with the armed
forces labeling the killings ``cold-blooded murder.''
   In a 120-page report submitted to President Corazon Aquino, the
panel said de Guzman had tried to sell illegal drugs to police. The
committee cautioned military and police ``not to play with fire''
by attacking each other.
   The military, claiming the alleged drug sale was a setup and the
killings were deliberate, had filed criminal charges against the
U.S. drug agents and 13 policemen, including police Capt. Reynaldo
Jaylo and National Bureau of Investigation Deputy Director Epimaco
Velasco.
   Velasco and Jaylo resigned in protest, claiming the military
wanted to cover up drug trafficking among its officers. Mrs. Aquino
refused to accept their resignations.
   U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents Philip Needham,
Andrew Fenrich and Jake Hernandez were cleared in the case because
they left the scene before the shooting started, the report said.
   The committee said the killings were not premeditated, but
recommended that Jaylo face civilian prosecution because no
evidence was found to back his claim that he shot de Guzman in self
defense. Three other policemen also should stand trial, it said.
   ``It was an unjustified killing. That was our finding,'' said
Francisco Villa, a military prosecutor and committee member.
   In addition to de Guzman, deputy chief of the northern Luzon
command, an ai9de, Maj. Franco Calanog, and a military informant
were also killed. Police said they resisted arrest.
   The report said Needham told National Bureau of Investigation
Director Alfredo Lim on July 2 that de Guzman, posing as a
businessman, wanted to sell 22 pounds of heroin. The agent helped
arrange the ``sting'' operation at a parking lot in suburban Makati.
   The three DEA agents left the country after the shootings. The
agents submitted a detailed account of the operation, but chairman
Magdangal Elma deplored their failure to appear before the
committee.
   The presidential committee asked Mrs. Aquino to waive
court-martial proceedings against Jaylo and the policemen also
charged by the military. It also recommended that police be trained
how to properly conduct arrests and urged that soldiers be relieved
of of drug enforcement duties.
   ``Transgressors of the law in any guise, whether drug
traffickers or killers ... should be unmasked,'' the committee
said. ``Their wrongdoings must not be countenanced.''

   PLO chief Yasser Arafat today proposed that U.S.
and other foreign forces withdraw from the Persian Gulf region and
be replaced by a multinational force under the U.N. flag.
   Arafat, one of the few Arab leaders to support Iraq after its
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, also accused the United States of using
the gulf crisis to further American and Israeli interests.
   The statement was delivered the speech on Arafat's behalf at a
U.N.-sponsored meeting of human rights groups on Palestine.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization leader said the U.N. force
would be an interim measure until a political solution could be
reached.
   Arafat urged an end to international sanctions against Iraq.
However, in a clear reference to Israel, the statement called for
sanctions against ``any state that refuses to withdraw from the
territories that it occupies.''
   Nabil Ramlawi, the PLO's ambassador in Geneva, said this did not
apply to Iraq because it was assumed that an Arab solution to the
gulf conflict would make sanctions unneccessary.
   Ramlawi told The Associated Press the statement represented the
PLO's latest position on the gulf crisis.
   The statement said the PLO was acting as a ``mediator'' in the
conflict and did not side with one party against another.
   Arafat's public stance against Western intervention in the gulf
and friendship with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has prompted
widespread criticism of the PLO in the West and among Arab allies
of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
   The PLO is concerned that the crisis has diverted attention away
from the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   In his statement, Arafat accused the United States of ``acting
to bend the United Nations and international will to serve its own
national interests as a superpower, and the interests of its ally,
Israel.''
   Washington suspended an 18-month-old dialogue with the PLO in
June after Arafat failed to condemn a raid on an Israeli beach by a
Palestinian extremist group.
   The U.N. Security Council has denounced Iraq's invasion,
declared an embargo on Iraq and backed a U.S-led blockade.

   Scores of police took up the hunt in
this terrified college town today for the ``maniac on the loose''
who killed five students, mutilating three. Students armed
themselves or fled to their parents.
   ``We slept with steak knives last night,'' said a tearful Stacie
Green, a 19-year-old junior from Jacksonville. ``I had to call my
mom. This is unreal.''
   The victims _ four women and a man attending either the
University of Florida or Santa Fe Community College _ were stabbed
in three attacks at off-campus apartments since Sunday. Police said
three victims were mutilated. A newspaper said one was decapitated.
   The killer used an open door, open window or sliding-glass door
to enter the victims' apartments, which are within about two miles
of each other, Police Chief Wayland Clifton said today.
   ``At first that was not real clear in our cases because we
thought he might be gaining entry by disguising himself in some way
and winning the confidence of the occupants,'' he said. ``We do not
now think that that happened in any of the three cases.''
   The FBI has prepared a psychological profile of the killer but
authorities do not plan to make it public, Clifton said.
   Police checked out several reports of suspicious people around
the city overnight but made no arrests, Alachua County sheriff's
Lt. Sadie Darnell said this morning.
   ``It's clear this part of the country has some maniac on the
loose,'' said University of Florida President John Lombardi. ``It
reminds us of a natural catastrophe. The killer is selecting
victims by criteria that are not clear to us.''
   Gov. Bob Martinez ordered in dozens of state troopers and other
law enforcement agents. Out-of-state experts on serial killers were
called in. Local police tripled their patrols.
   ``You'll see more police coverage than you've ever seen in any
city you've ever lived in,'' Clifton said.
   The buildup was scant comfort for the thousands of students
living off campus in the town of 90,000, where the slayings have
stirred memories of serial killer Ted Bundy. He died in the
electric chair last year after murdering two Florida State
University sorority sisters in Tallahassee in a 1978 rampage.
   Hundreds of students bolted their doors, fled to emergency
shelters, went home to their parents or angrily demanded details on
the slayings and how to protect themselves. Many armed themselves
with pistols, stun guns and Mace.
   ``My father bought me a gun,'' said a junior from Tallahassee
who refused to give her name. ``I'll stay for awhile, but I'm
thinking of dropping out for a semester.''
   Said one Miami father who flew into Gainesville to pick up his
daughter: ``She's going to go back with Mace and knowing how to
shoot a gun.''
   Student Mark Andreozzi said he and a roommate armed themselves
when a carpet cleaner turned up unexpectedly Tuesday. ``I had an ax
and he had a bat. We're going to get guns after this,'' Andreozzi
said.
   The university offered lodging for students afraid to return to
off-campus apartments. Fraternity and sorority houses, churches and
community groups and faculty members also offered to put students
up.
   Lombardi said the university decided against canceling class
because students who couldn't go home would be left without ``the
safety and support of the university.'' But he said all penalties
for non-attendance would be suspended.
   Parents and friends flooded the phone lines with anxious calls,
and students confronted the police chief with questions about how
the killer got in.
   ``At least tell us that so we can know what we should do,'' said
Karyn James, one of more than 1,200 students who jammed the student
union to hear the chief, school president and others explain what
precautions to take. ``Here we are, buying all kinds of locks and
deadbolts, and we don't even know whether we should.''
   Two bodies were found in one apartment on Sunday, one was
discovered Monday and two were found together Tuesday. The
Gainesville Sun, citing unidentified sources, said one woman was
decapitated, but authorities would not confirm that.
   Slain were Tracy Inez Paules, 23, and a 23-year-old rommmate,
Manuel R. Taboada. Taboada had been a student at nearby Santa Fe
Community College and was planning to study at the University of
Florida. Ms. Paules was a senior at the university.
   Also slain were University of Florida freshmen Christina Powell,
17, of Jacksonville, and Sonja Larson, 18, of Deerfield Beach, and
18-year-old Christa Hoyt, a Santa Fe Community College student and
records clerk at the sheriff's office.

   The Register of Orange County, Calif., on a Gulf crisis federal
surtax:
   We've seen this before. In 1968, Lyndon Johnson imposed a
10-percent surtax on incomes to pay for the Vietnam War and his
Great Society domestic welfare boondoggles. The result: the end of
the prosperity sparked by President Kennedy's 1963 tax cuts, and a
decade of stagflation. ...
   In the same way, President Bush, if he joins the surtax mania,
would risk giving us renewed stagflation, perhaps leading to his
own defeat at the polls in 1992. ... But the president could by
himself act to retard, or even prevent, an economic implosion.
First, the president could announce that tax hikes are simply
beyond consideration. ...
   He could declare a moratorium on all new regulation, such as the
economy-killing Clean Air Act. He could order all cabinet
departments to reduce, by 10 percent, paperwork foisted on the
public. ... He could order a hiring freeze for all federal agencies
to last until the end of his term of office in January 1993. ...
   Such actions to reduce the federal bureaucracy would send an
important message: When the economy gets in bad shape, and familes
must tighten their belts while businesses cut back, government,
too, should institute economy measures and pare down. ... (T)he
president, as the main molder of policy and opinion, should take
action to make sure government does its part to lighten the added
burden now carried by all Americans.

   The Courier-News, Bridgewater, N.J., on the Persian Gulf:
   For George Bush and the U.S. armed forces he is massing there,
Saudi Arabia, normally a sandy locale, suddenly has turned into a
forbidding place of rocks and hard places.
   Some pleasant and some nasty surprises have turned up. Praise
Allah, troops from Morocco, Egypt and Syria are standing with us in
the desert against the fellow Arab who aspires to conquer and lead
them all.
   On the down side, Soviet military advisers reportedly are still
giving Saddam Hussein's divisions the guidance and technical
support that helped them defeat the Iranians. So much for
U.S.-Soviet solidarity in opposing Hussein's aggression.
   Hussein knows that if he can knock out the Saudi oil fields, the
loss of that oil, together with the trade embargo on Iraq and
Kuwait, could drive the industrial world into a deep recession. So
does the hardline Soviet general said to be advising Hussein.
   For Arab and Western nations alike, Hussein threatens more than
the Gulf's oil supplies. So, if there is ever to be peace in the
region, Saddam must go. And there is no easy, painless way to
dispatch him. But before U.S. military power is unleashed, Bush
should try to squeeze Hussein harder _ by getting Soviet advisers
out of Iraq and more Arab troops in Saudi Arabia.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on the Persian Gulf:
   We didn't buy it, did you?
   We hope most people around the globe who saw videotape of the
``friendly'' Butcher of Baghdad's disgusting manipulation of
innocent children and others he's holding hostage weren't fooled.
We hope they responded with revulsion and an increased
determination to rid the world of Saddam Hussein's imperialistic
terror.
   This unscrupulous kidnapper and killer _ who has unleashed the
horrors of chemical weapons upon young and old; who condemned a
million people to death in the war with Iran that he initiated; who
shamelessly raped and robbed Kuwait; who declared a ``holy war''
against the United States and who is now shielding Iraq against an
angry world's response by holding innocent people as prisoners at
military installations _ has miscalculated once again if he thinks
intelligent and sensitive human beings believe he loves children or
has any respect for life.
   Using his government-controlled media as propaganda weapons, he
hopes to paralyze the West, especially Britain and the United
States, from responding decisively.
   He is trying to terrorize us and make us feel guilty. Well, we
will not be made to tremble and we have nothing to feel guilty
about. Harm inflicted upon Saddam's thousands of ``guests'' being
held against their will at gunpoint will be on his head. He and his
army will be held accountable.
   The little British lad whose head Saddam and his military goons
caressed didn't buy the lying leader's ugly display of insincerity
and neither, we hope, did the rest of the world _ just as the
civilized world didn't buy images of a smiling Josef Stalin patting
the head of a peasant girl while sending her parents to the gulag
or of an affable Adolf Hitler strolling along flower-strewn paths
while trying to bring the world to its knees.
   In our view, Saddam's sickening stunt has only served to
strengthen our resolve that he must be stopped and that his machine
of war and destruction must be dismantled.

   Mohawk negotiators met with government officials
today in an effort to end a standoff between troops and Indians
after the army announced it was bringing in hundreds more soldiers
to dismantle barricades.
   Quebec Native Affairs Minister John Ciaccia said the talks were
under way at the request of the Mohawks and that he had briefed
Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa Tuesday night.
   Ciaccia said he wasn't calling the talks to end the 7-week-old
standoff ``formal negotiations'' and the army's intention to
dismantle the barricades had not changed.
   Negotiators declined to comment as they entered a hotel room in
Dorval.
   Canadian fighter jets on Tuesday swooped over the Oka area near
Montreal where heavily armed Mohawks have dug in at a road
barricade in a dispute over a planned golf course addition that
they say would encroach on ancestral soil.
   About a dozen miles away just south of Montreal, Mohawks backing
the Oka protest have barricaded a commuter bridge in sympathy.
   The Mercier Bridge blockade has angered many people who use the
bridge to commute to Montreal, and about 500 people stoned Mohawk
families leaving the adjacent Kahnawake reservation on Tuesday.
   Some injuries were reported.
   Brig. Gen. Armand Roy, tactical commander of the soldiers moving
in on the two sets of barricades, told a news conference late
Tuesday that ``military operations will cease only when the armed
warriors lay down their weapons and surrender without conditions.''
   Roy added that he has ordered his soldiers to move closer to
Indian positions in preparation for a move to dismantle the Mohawk
barricades at the Kahnawake and Oka reservations.
   Oka is 18 miles west of Montreal. The Kahawake reservation lies
between the Mercier Bridge and suburban towns that depend on the
bridge to cross the St. Lawrence River to get to Montreal.
   Early today, the army announced that 675 more men, 136 wheeled
vehicles and 50 tracked vehicles would be deployed to the outskirts
of the Kahnawake reservation. Before Tuesday, about 2,500 combat
soldiers were positioned outside both reservations.
   The number of Indian fighters is believed to be in the hundreds.
The army says Mohawks at the barricades have at least 170 automatic
weapons and an intricate network of trenches, bunkers and strong
points.
   Lt. Gen. Kent Foster said Tuesday that soldiers would use three
unarmed, 42-ton Leopard tanks equipped with a bulldozer front to
remove the barriers. He would not say when dismantling would begin.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney blamed Mohawk negotiators for the
crisis.
   He went on national TV on Tuesday and challenged Mohawks to take
down the barricades themselves before the army does. He said the
federal and Quebec governments had dealt with the land dispute in
good faith, but Mohawk bargainers advanced ``unrealistic
conditions'' and then demanded acceptance.
   ``We cannot overlook the illegal activities of an extremist
minority,'' Mulroney said, referring to the Mohawks' Warrior
contingent.
   Mohawk negotiator Billy Two Rivers said one more day of talks
should break the impasse and open Mercier Bridge and the roads
leading to it.
   ``We are in a process of achieving through negotiation what the
army was mandated to do by force,'' he said after Tuesday's
session. ``We're positive that in the next 24 hours things can be
resolved.''
   But Mulroney said he consulted Quebec authorities and that a
settlement ``doesn't appear to be within reach.''
   Foster said there were plans to evacuate people from military
zones if necessary and that those that live in surrounding areas
will be told to stay in their basements.
   Many local residents have complained bitterly about the
barricading of the Mercier Bridge, which has led to lengthy
commuting detours and meant lost business.
   Hundreds of people hurled rocks and construction material at a
convoy of 60 or more cars carrying Mohawk families out of Kahnawake
reservation by the bridge on Tuesday.
   Police said there were some injuries but that no one appeared
badly hurt.
   The armed confrontation in Oka began after a Quebec policeman
was killed on July 11 when police tried to tear down a Mohawk
barricade at the reservation and a gun battle erupted. Blame in the
death has not been fixed.
   On Monday, Bourassa said he was through with talks and was
asking the army to remove the barricades.

   The Register-Guard, Eugene, Ore., on natural resources:
   New evidence that a substance extracted from yew trees can be
used as an effective treatment for certain types of cancer
transforms a low-grade natural resource into a potentially
important one. It also teaches important lessons. Today's weed tree
may be tomorrow's miracle, and what once was wasted may soon be
developed as a valuable resource.
   The Pacific yew grows in small quantities over a broad range in
the Northwest. Its uses are ancient but limited _ the longbows that
defended England against Viking raids were made of yew, but it has
never been a major commercial species. Today, yew wood is still
used for bows as well as canoe paddles, fence posts and decorative
veneers. The market is so limited, however, that loggers usually
ignore yew in favor of Douglas fir, hemlock and other trees better
suited as saw timber.
   That may change with the discovery that taxol, a compound found
in the bark and other parts of trees of the yew, or taxus, genus,
holds promise as a treatment for ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer
kills 12,400 women a year in the United States. Efforts to
synthesize taxol have so far been unsuccessful. ...
   The potential emergence of what one dendrology book describes as
a small, bushy, untidy tree as a treatment against a common type of
cancer underscores the fact that there are no unimportant species.
Judging a tree or a bird or a flower to be of no significance says
more about the limits of human understanding than about the species
in question. Every form of life has value of some kind _ but the
true worth of many has yet to be discovered.

   The Oshkosh (Wis.) Northwestern on BGH:
   If bovine growth hormone (BGH) were eventually proven to be able
to grow hair on a billiard ball, remove warts without surgery, and
suppress the common cold, it would still have its detractors crying
that that's not enough.
   The Food and Drug Administration has declared that BGH increases
milk production in cows with no health risk to consumers.
   ``But we need more study,'' cry the critics. ``What about 10
years from now?''
   Ten years from now, of course, the critics will still be asking
for more study. That's the easy way of scuttling anything new.
   Studies by the FDA and by American Medical Association
researchers have been reassuring that the hormone poses no risks.
   Some critics take a different tack, to be sure. Some cite the
economic and sociologic aspects of introducing BGH into the dairy
industry.
   But that is an absolute dead issue if the hormone is safe. It is
just as logical to argue that the combine doomed the family farm
concept as it is to blame BGH.
   Milk producers use every possible strategy to boost milk
production with improved feeds and breeding programs. BGH is just
another tool in that quest for more production for less cost.
   The evidence of science mounts that the hormone can benefit
mankind, in much the same way, but more dramatically, than better
bovine nutrition.
   Let it come.

   ``It appears at this point it's a mercy-killing type thing,''
Police Chief Frank Pomeroy said of the shooting at Community
Memorial Hospital.
   Names of the victims were not immediately released and police
said they did not know the reason for the shootings.
   The woman was shot in her bed, then the husband sat in a chair
and killed himself, Pomeroy said.
   There were no other injuries reported. Police said they found
the gun on the floor next to the man.
   Authorities did not immediately report the nature of the woman's
illness.
   Shortly after the man entered his wife's room, nurses reported
hearing two gunshots, he said.

   A smoky fire this morning in the basement of the
New York Hilton forced the evacuation of 1,000 people from the
45-story hotel. No injuries were reported.
   Fire Chief Ellsworth Hughes said people were evacuated because
the fire, which was contained in an electrical switching room,
knocked out the 2,000-room hotel's power.
   Firefighters ushered people out of the lobby, warning them
through bullhorns, ``Do not breathe the smoke.''
   Thousands of conventiongoers were caught in the smoke, including
Kathleen Booth of Norwalk, Conn., who said, ``The fumes were really
intense.''
   Hughes and Con Edison electric company spokeswoman Pat Richardi
said the fire did not affect any transformers, so there was no
danger from burned PCBs. Polychlorinated biphenyls, used as
insulation in electrical equipment, cause toxic smoke when they
burn.
   Con Ed shut off the power and the hotel resorted to emergency
power. Full power was to remain off until sometime in the afternoon
for repairs.
   The 1,000 people who were evacuated were not ordered out of the
hotel _ they were simply advised to leave as a precaution, Fire Lt.
Jim Powell said. It was not known how many people remained in the
hotel.
   Twenty-three firefighting units were sent to the hotel. Side
streets were closed and hundreds of people lined the sidewalks as
acrid smoke filtered out of the hotel on Manhattan's Avenue of the
Americas between 53rd and 54th streets.
   Booth's marketing convention was switched to another hotel, and
other conventions were expected to do likewise.

   Het Parool, Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Saddam Hussein's
televised meeting with Western hostages:
   Baffling images from Baghdad. With his revolting TV appearance
..., in which, as a well-meaning uncle, he let himself amiably be
photographed with a powerless family of British hostages, Saddam
Hussein has hopefully lost the credit he still had, especially in
the Arab world. ...
   This Saddam Hussein is a dangerous lunatic, nothing more, but,
most of all, nothing less, and he must be driven off stage as fast
as possible. The threat emanating from his latest TV show _ I'm
here and I do what I want _ is too big to allow him to carry on
further. ...
   Precisely in this context it is promising that the five
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council agreed
unexpectedly fast to a draft resolution which gives the military
force that has already collected around Iraq the right to use force
if necessary to stop the Iraqi dictator.

   The only hope of averting a major military collision in the
present situation lies in President Saddam Hussein showing that his
proclaimed desire for peace talks is not meant to trap the rest of
the world into coming to terms with Iraqi seizure of Kuwait in any
sense.
   If, however, he is only looking for a face-saving device to
restore the status quo, there is no dearth of diplomatic skill to
make this possible.

   The Sunday Correspondent, London, on the Persian Gulf:
   The release of Brian Keenan after his four-year incarceration in
Beirut would, in normal times, be a cause for unfettered delight.
... Yet, in the context of the mass seizing of hostages by Saddam
Hussein, the matter takes on another, and less happy, aspect.
   If our Western societies are so worried about the fate of a
single citizen, how are they to cope with the fate of thousands?
Will we become obsessed by Saddam's human shield? Will our human
concern for the individuals involved paralyze our efforts to curb
Saddam?
   If Jimmy Carter as president of the world's largest power could
be brought down by his failure to rescue a handful of hostages in
Iran, does not George Bush face certain humiliation as a result of
the present, much larger problem?
   Much that is happening makes such an outcome more likely. ...
(But) we have soberly to appreciate that some causes are important
enough to be worth the sacrifice of human life.
   We have to recognize that, in this crisis, the side that blinks
first is lost. We have to be aware that appeasement to save those
individuals in peril, could easily threaten the lives of others
whom Saddam might use as pawns in future.

   Business Times, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, on the Persian Gulf:
   Whatever the outcome of the peace process and even if the status
quo before Aug. 2 is restored _ that is the complete withdrawal of
Iraqi forces from Kuwait and the restoration of the al-Sabah family
_ the scenario in the Gulf area will never be the same again.
   The crisis will be the watershed marking the beginning of the
end of the old order in the area.
   Just as the winds of change have blown across the Soviet Union
and Eastern Europe, they have now moved down into the Persian Gulf.
   The writing is already on the wall for the absolute monarchies
there.
   If they value their continuity, the monarchies will have to meet
the new challenges by instituting fundamental changes to bring in
democratic processes in their administrations by allowing greater
citizen participation.
   The process for change has been simmering underground for some
years and though President Saddam (Hussein) is nowhere near a role
model for democratic participation, his actions will nevertheless
act as a catalyst for the transformation of the old order in the
Gulf.
   The mere presence of U.S. forces which include women and Jews in
such a closed society as Saudi Arabia will definitely have
repercussions on Saudi society and put further pressures for
modernization.
   For the U.S. and the Western powers, they will also have to come
to terms with legitimate Arab demands vis-a-vis the question of
Arab interest which definitely also includes the interest for the
Palestinians who are no less Arabs than the Saudis or the Kuwaitis.

   Western Straits Times, Singapore, on developments in Burma:
   Burma's rulers are still trying to reconcile the irreconcilable.
They want the outside world's approval, expressed in aid and
investments, but are unwilling to take the steps the world demands
as a precondition for loosening its purse strings.
   Trade has been liberalized since 1985 and, in the past few years
especially, foreign businessmen and potential investors have been
actively courted. But the colonels and generals who rule Burma seem
intent on ensuring that their version of glasnost and perestroika
is confined strictly to a narrowly-defined economic sphere. ...
   Three months after holding free elections, the first in 30
years, the military is refusing to hand over power to the civilians
who won 80 percent of the available seats. Worse, it is not even
saying when it might do so. The population, having overwhelmingly
rejected military rule, is not surprisingly resentful and there
have been reports of scattered demonstrations in several cities. ...
   Like most of its factories and vehicles, which date to the
1950s, if not earlier, the economy is slowly but inexorably falling
apart. The rulers have to make a choice: They either accept the
verdict of the people and the need for real change or find
themselves presiding over a ruin, not a country with a once-proud
history.

   Voters have elected to retain the death
penalty in Bermuda, according to official results Wednesday.
   Nearly 11,000 people turned out Tuesday to vote in the island's
first national referendum, which asked whether capital punishment
should be abolished.
   Almost 79 percent voted to retain the death penalty for
premeditated murder. The result is not binding on the Bermuda
government.
   The ballot asked voters just one question: whether they were in
favor or against retention of the penalty. Abolitionists opposed
the referendum's style, saying voters should also have been asked
if they support life imprisonment without parole for first-degree
murder.
   The last time the North Atlantic island's gallows were used was
on Dec. 2, 1977, when murderers Larry Tacklyn and Buck Burrows were
put to death.
   The double hanging sparked civil unrest across the British
colony. British troops were called in to restore order.
   Several people have been convicted of first-degree murder. In
February and March, the governor, Sir Desmond Langley, commuted the
death sentences of two people sentenced to death. There is no one
on death row now.
   Britain abolished the death penalty in 1965. Bermuda, an island
of 70,000 people, has been a British colony since the 1500s.

<HEAD>Dallas Police Chief Charged with Perjury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors filed seven perjury charges against
Police Chief Mack Vines, reportedly for statements he made to a
panel investigating a police officer's fatal shooting of an unarmed
Mexican national.
   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance today announced the
charges and said they will be reviewed by a grand jury next week.
They are third-degree felonies, each carrying a maximum 10-year
prison term and fines of up to $10,000.
   ``This office intends to seek indictments and prosecute any
person who has committed crimes involving acts of official public
corruption, regardless of who it may be,'' Vance said in a
statement.
   Vance said details of Vines' statements will be made available
``upon the returning of indictments.''
   Vines' attorney, Kim Wade, is ``not speaking with the media,'' a
woman who answered the phone at Wade's office said this morning.
   The charges stem from Vines' testimony before a panel reviewing
the 1989 dismissal of Officer Patrick LeMaire.
   The panel had confronted the chief with accusations that he
tried to influence the testimony of an assistant chief regarding
the speed of the internal investigation of LeMaire.
   Vines fired LeMaire 17 days after he killed Jose Hilario, an
unarmed Mexican national, on June 27, 1989. The chief said LeMaire
violated the department's policy by failing to take steps that
would have avoided a confrontation.
   Vines first said, ``no'' when asked whether he had talked to
anyone about the panel's investigation, but changed his answer upon
further questioning, according to sources familiar with the
transcript of the hearing, The Dallas Morning News reported.
   The chief then acknowledged that he talked to Assistant Chief
Greg Holliday before Holliday testified. Vines has denied trying to
influence him.
   Both Vines and Holliday have been on indefinite leave with pay
for about three weeks.
   Saying she was speaking on behalf of her husband, the chief's
wife said Tuesday night he had no comment when asked about stories
in the News and the Dallas Times Herald that Vines' case would go
to a grand jury.
   An administrative law judge ruled last month that LeMaire should
be reinstated, saying the city failed to justify his dismissal.
   An internal affairs detective testified during the
administrative hearing that his initial report on the shooting was
later altered.
   Ms. Hart appointed a special panel to review the allegations.
The panel found no wrongdoing in the LeMaire case by Vines and his
staff, saying that the altered report was the result of poor
procedures in the internal affairs division.
   But the panel brought up allegations of perjury and witness
tampering that prompted Ms. Hart to place Vines and Holliday on
indefinite paid leave.
   Sources say no charges will be filed against Holliday, the News
reported.

<HEAD>Experts Predict U.S. Would Strike Remote Iraqi Bases, Missile
Sites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. military's first strike will be
against remote air bases, missile sites and chemical weapons
installations if the Persian Gulf standoff turns into a shooting
war, experts on the Middle East and national security say.
   An attack on the presidential palace in crowded Baghdad is also
seen as a possibility.
   American officials in Saudi Arabia say an all-out assault on
Iraq is highly unlikely unless the Iraqis fire first. They have
discussed contingency plans, but Pentagon ground rules forbids
disclosure of specific targets.
   Experts here also were reluctant to pinpoint exact locations
they thought might be targeted, but indicated the initial focus
would be on Iraq's air force and missiles.
   ``To destroy the Iraqi air force on the ground will be the No. 1
priority, and to prevent them from firing missiles,'' said Barry
Rubin, senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy, a private research group.
   Other targets, Rubin predicted, would be supply depots and
supply lines and places that produce chemical weapons.
   Asked to be specific, he said: ``I don't think it would be
useful to go into that. But we know where the chemical
installations are, and satellites take very nice pictures.''
   William B. Quandt, a National Security Council official in the
Nixon and Carter administrations who is a senior fellow with the
Brookings Institution, listed much the same priorities.
   ``I think their first concern would be to neutralize
surface-to-surface missile capability and then to establish air
superiority without any question,'' Quandt said.
   He said military officials would be likely also to pinpoint
``anything they know about chemical depots _ not so much the plants
but where they store the stuff.''
   ``And then there is the kind of notion that we ought to sneak in
and drop a bomb on the presidential palace on top of it all,''
Quandt said. ``I am sure somebody is thinking about hitting the
so-called command and control centers.''
   Such an attack would strike at the heart of Baghdad, a city of
more than 3 million people.
   ``I am not sure you could take anything without taking out
civilian populations; not around Baghdad, that's for sure,'' said
Joyce R. Starr, a Washington consultant and expert on Middle East
conflict who served in the Carter White House.
   ``I think if they really decide to go for broke there will be
civilian casualties,'' Quandt said.
   Rubin said the military installations, unlike the presidential
palace and other government buildings, are remote from population
centers.
   ``They are not necessarily in the desert, but they are not in
the middle of cities, either,'' he said.
   According to a forthcoming book by Leonard S. Spector and
Jacqueline R. Smith of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, Iraq has been conducting work on uranium enrichment, a key
process in making fuel for nuclear weapons, at a plant near Baghdad.
   The book concludes that Iraq has apparently launched a nuclear
weapons program, but will not be able to build such arms on its own
until late in this decade.
   Rubin said the nuclear plant would not be an important target
because, for the short run, Iraq has no nuclear capability.
   After the Air Force and the missile sites, he said, the
principal aim ``would have to be at the war-making capacity, not at
civilians or even at the industrial capacity.''
   The State Department has said it had credible reports that Iraq
was moving foreigners trapped within its borders to industrial
sites that might be targets of attack.
   Quandt said he assumed the U.S. military would take that into
account ``up to a point, but I think once they have decided
something is really a high priority target, they will go after it
with or without the presence of American civilians.''

<HEAD>Nancy Reagan Has Cancerous Tumor Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former first lady Nancy Reagan today had
a small cancerous tumor removed from just beneath her left nostril,
a family spokesman said.
   The basal cell carcinoma was discovered during a routine
dermatological examination at the Mayo Clinic and was removed by a
plastic surgeon at St. Marys Hospital, said Mark Weinberg,
spokesman for Mrs. Reagan and former President Reagan.
   In 1987, doctors at Bethesda Naval Hospital removed Mrs.
Reagan's left breast and adjoining lymph glands after a cancerous
tumor was found.
   The Reagans arrived at the Mayo clinic on Monday for what
Weinberg said were routine physical examinations as part of their
annual checkups.
   Physicians found the Reagans in otherwise excellent health and
they planned to return home to Bel-Air, Calif., today, Weinberg
said.
   Weinberg issued a statement on Mrs. Reagan's condition and did
not return a phone call seeking further information. A Mayo Clinic
spokeswoman said all information would have to come from Weinberg.
   The Reagans were scheduled to visit Germany, Poland and the
Soviet Union on a trip beginning Sept. 10, Weinberg said Tuesday.
It was not known if Mrs. Reagan's surgery would affect that
schedule.
   Reagan, 79, was at the Mayo Clinic last September, when doctors
performed neurosurgery to remove a pool of blood that formed on his
brain after a fall from a horse.

<HEAD>Scientists Produce Sunlight That Outshines The Sun</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A solar collector has produced a tiny beam of
sunlight that outshines the sun. It's 15 percent brighter than the
glow at the sun's surface.
   In a brief note in Thursday's journal Nature, Dave Cooke and
colleagues at the University of Chicago said they used a sapphire
``light funnel'' to produce sunlight 84,000 times as bright as the
sunlight striking the Earth.
   The researchers, having beaten the sun at its own game, boasted
that they had done more than set a world record. They produced the
highest concentration of sunlight in the solar system.
   Two years ago, the group reported that it had produced sunlight
56,000 times as concentrated as sunlight at the Earth's surface.
   The concentrator uses a parabolic mirror like those used in
reflecting telescopes, and a ``non-imaging concentrator'' made of
sapphire. The mirror reflects light to the broad end of the
cone-shaped concentrator, which acts like a funnel, the researchers
said.
   Light is directed inside the concentrator to emerge in
concentrated form at the tip of the cone, the researchers said.
   The bright beam of concentrated sunlight emerged from a
1-millimeter aperture at the tip of the concentrator. (One
millimeter is about one-twenty-fourth of an inch.)
   Refinements of the technique could lead to the development of a

   Apparently wishing to let his music
speak for him, guitar master Eric Clapton performed without mention
of blues comrade Stevie Ray Vaughan and other friends killed in a
helicopter crash.
   He went through the show Tuesday night at Sandstone Amphitheatre
seemingly like any other rock 'n' roll performance, although he had
been on stage with Vaughan 48 hours earlier in Wisconsin.
   Gus Fasone, general manager at Sandstone, said Clapton refused
all interviews and demanded that reporters and camera crews be
barred from backstage.
   ``The people around him, it's like they are in shock,'' Fasone
said. ``Backstage, it's like they aren't functioning, they're going
through the motions.''
   Little of that showed to the more than 16,000 fans at the
outdoor theater, about 20 miles west of Kansas City, Mo.
   ``I think (the band) did an extremely brave thing,'' Fasone said.
   The helicopter crashed in dense fog early Monday, a few hours
after a blues jam featuring Clapton, Vaughan and guitarist Robert
Cray at Alpine Valley Music Theatre near East Troy, Wis.
   ``When I heard the radio I almost cried,'' said Mark Petitt, a
25-year-old Kansas City, Mo., man wearing a Stevie Ray Vaughan
T-shirt. ``I said, `Man, why him?' Especially after he cleaned up
his life. I don't understand it, but I think his music will live.''
   Petitt said it was the tradition of rock to play on after the
tragic deaths of stars.
   ``I think Stevie Ray Vaughan would have wanted him to go on,''
Petitt said.
   Clapton, 45, and Vaughan, 35, made their careers leading bands
with guitar-driven rocking blues _ Clapton beginning in his native
England and Vaughan in Texas.
   Both fell victim to drugs and alcohol, but each overcame
problems to advance their careers. This year, Vaughan won a Grammy
for the album ``In Step,'' referring to the ``12 Steps'' program
used by recovering alcoholics.
   The others killed were agent Bobby Brooks of Los Angeles,
bodyguard Nigel Browne and tour manager Colin Smythe, both of
London, and pilot Jeffrey W. Brown, 42, of East Chicago, Ind.

<TEXT>
   President Bush today called the Persian Gulf
crisis ``one of the toughest military missions in modern memory,''
and the White House said Iraq had not yet made good on its promise
to free foreign women and children.
   ``I have no evidence ... indicating that people have been
allowed to leave.'' White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk told
reporters. He said the government was ready to look into ``any
means that will facilitate their departure,'' once Iraq's President
Saddam Hussein fulfills his Tuesday pledge to allow departure from
Iraq of foreign women and children.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat, went
to the State Department today to notify the United States of the
decision to let women and children go. He said Americans will be
allowed to leave through Jordan or Turkey, but gave no timetable
for their departure.
   Popadiuk refused to confirm or deny a report that the
administration had received a message from Saddam Hussein, offering
to pull out his invading troops from Kuwait with conditions.
   The spokesman said that a Western physician would observe an
autopsy of an American man who died while a hostage of Iraq. Iraqi
officials said he had an apparent heart attack, and U.S. officials
have said nothing to indicate they believe otherwise.
   ``In a situation wehre there's a war going on and people are
being detained, there's all kinds of stress and who can say what
might happen,'' Popadiuk said.
   The president this morning gave a radio pep talk broadcast over
Armed Forces Radio to troops in Saudi Arabia, but most U.S.
soldiers in the gulf did not hear it because the radio network does
not have a transmitter in Saudi Arabia.
   In Dhahran, Navy Capt. Mike Sherman said trancripts and tape
recordings of the speech will be distributed to each unit stationed
in Saudi Arabia, a process which, including delivery time, would
take a week.
   Popadiuk said the White House knew about the transmission
problem ahead of time and anticipated the tape distribution. He
said the only ones who heard it live were troops on ships and in
Bahrain.
   Bush spoke by telephone this morning with Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu, whose government unveiled a package of
money, medics and transportation for the multinational effort
against Iraq.
   Bush also spoke Tuesday night to United Nations Secretary
General Javier Perez de Cuellar and wished him well in his Thursday
negotiations with Iraqi officials, aimed at finding a solution to
the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In his radio speech, Bush told the troops, ``You stand on the
front line against aggression and international lawlessness.''
   ``We have never sought conflict nor do we hope to chart a course
for other nations, but at the hands of injustice in the face of
aggression, ours is a once reluctant fist now clutched
resolutely,'' he said.
   ``It is your presence, your skills, your talents, your judgment
that bring America's principles to life and give them strength and
meaning,'' Bush said.
   ``You're now in one of the toughest military missions in
memory,'' Bush added. ``As tough as it is, know this: thanks to
you, nobody's feeling the heat more than the government in
Baghdad.''
   The president's pep talk came a day after he received a strong
vote of confidence from a large, bipartisan contingent of members
of Congress.
   While they voiced overall support for his policy, some said they
wanted to see other wealthy nations share the cost.
   The Bush administration is trying to allies to help pay for it,
administration officials and lawmakers say.
   Members of Congress briefed by Bush on the Persian Gulf
situation Tuesday said they received indications that the United
States was pressuring the international community to provide money.
   ``The question of burden-sharing was brought up and discussed in
a variety of ways,'' said Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., chairman of
the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ``It's being carefully
studied. Since it is an international effort, the burden falls on
all countries. I would think that shortly here there would be
clarification.''
   While Bush got a message of strong support for his Persian Gulf
strategy during the meeting with about 170 members of Congress,
several voiced concerns about the cost and said other wealthy
nations should shoulder some of the burden.
   ``Obviously people are concerned about the cost,'' said Rep.
David Bonior, D-Mich. ``They want to know what the Japanese and the
Germans and others are doing to share this burden.''
   The Pentagon projected Tuesday the U.S. cost for the buildup
will reach $2.5 billion by the end of September.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Bush sought
to assure the lawmakers he did not intend to put the entire cost on
the strapped U.S. Treasury, ``especially with precarious
deficit-reduction talks in progress between the administration and
Congress.''
   The United States has about 80,000 troops either in Saudi Arabia
or en route.
   Twenty-two countries, including the Soviet Union, Britain,
France and Egypt, have either dispatched troops and equipment or
have promised to do so.

<TEXT>
   Some 1990 U.S. coin proof sets that sell for
$11 are worth more than 100 times that because of a missing mint
mark on a penny, according to dealers.
   The penny in the 3,555 sets is missing the ``S'' all proof coins
normally bear. That makes them unusual and valuable to collectors.
   The sets of highly polished coins were struck and issued before
the error was discovered, U.S. Mint spokeswoman Hamilton Dix
confirmed Tuesday.
   ``I stuck my neck out when these things showed up and predicted
that by the end of the decade these things will be worth $10,000,''
said Alan Herbert, who broke news of the error in the Aug. 7
edition of Numismatic News newspaper of Iola, Wis.
   ``We have talked with a collector who had ordered five sets from
the Mint and all five of those sets were missing the mint mark,''
said Beth Deischler, editor of Coin World newspaper in Sidney, Ohio.
   ``At that time, he wasn't considering selling at any price.''
   ``The errors are a prize, because there are so few of them,''
Ms. Deischler said.
   Coin dealer Harry Forman of suburban Cheltenham paid $1,400 each
last week for four sets and is now offering $1,700 per set.
   The proof coins are made by using polished blanks and dies. The
flat surfaces are mirror-like and the relief portions look frosted.
The $11 five-coin set contains a penny, nickel, dime, quarter and
half dollar. A six-coin prestige set adds a proof dollar and sells
for $46.
   Proof coins are struck at the San Francisco Mint and thus should
bear an ``S'' under the date. Dies for striking the coins are made
at the Philadelphia Mint. The Philadelphia Mint puts no mark on
pennies it strikes, but they all go into general circulation.
   ``We're investigating to find out exactly what happened,'' Miss
Dix said. ``We are taking steps to ensure this does not happen
again.''
   Similar errors were made on proof nickels in 1971 and proof
dimes in 1968, 1970, 1975 and 1983, Herbert said.

   National Guardsmen and fire officials
searched a muddy cornfield today for more victims of tornadoes that
flattened scores of homes and killed at least 24 people.
   The dead included at least nine people found near a demolished
apartment complex where six residents were missing, Lockport Fire
Chief Dave Martis said today.
   At least 306 people were treated at hospitals after the cluster
of tornadoes touched down in four spots Tuesday afternoon, cutting
an eight-mile trail of destruction leading to the northern Illinois
city of Joliet. At least 11 people were listed in critical
condition today.
   In nearby Plainfield, residents began returning to the rubble of
their homes.
   ``It was like an eggbeater went through the inside of the
house,'' said 41-year-old Bruce Marshall as he tried to fashion a
makeshift cover for his roofless home.
   Gov. James R. Thompson declared Will County a state disaster
area, and requested that President Bush declare the area a federal
disaster to provide additional relief.
   ``Nothing in my personal experience ... compares with this,''
Thompson said during a tour of Plainfield today.
   Illinois Treasurer Jerry Cosentino announced that the state will
provide at least $25 million for low-interest loans to tornado
victims.
   Elsewhere in the Midwest, thunderstorms Tuesday halted power to
70,000 customers in central and western Ohio. A tornado touched
down south of Tecumseh in southern Michigan and storms that ripped
through northern Indiana left at least one person dead. Pat Jones,
27, was killed when the house he was building in South Bend
collapsed.
   At least two tornadoes were spotted in northwestern
Pennsylvania, but no injuries were reported.
   Preliminary tallies made in the dark from the tornadoes in
Illinois suggested more than 100 houses were destroyed, in addition
to the apartment complex and a high school. The storms blacked out
17,000 homes and businesses, tossed trucks like toys and flattened
crops.
   ``Cars were flying all over the place,'' said Tony Aloisio, who
was driving by and stopped to help. ``It happened so fast that all
I could do was sit there and watch. Then 15 minutes later the skies
got blue like it had never even happened.''
   About 30 Guardsmen took up positions in the three affected
communities overnight and 150 were to arrive later in the day to
search for victims and provide security, said Col. Phil Becker, a
National Guard brigade commander.
   At least four people were arrested for looting, and five others
were taken into custody for interfering with rescuers, authorities
said.
   ``I saw everything out there,'' said Will County Executive
Charles Adelman. ``Refrigerators, TV sets, washing machines, cars
stacked three high.''
   The twisters _ experts were unsure exactly how many _ hit
Joliet, 40 miles southwest of Chicago, neighboring Crest Hill, and
Plainfield to the northwest.
   Crest Hill Mayor Don Randich was among the first firefighters to
arrive at the apartment complex. ``There were people wandering
around, dazed,'' he said. ``Automobile horns were blowing, but
there was no one in the cars. It was total confusion.''
   Martis said the bodies of nine people were found near the
apartment complex. Seven bodies, including that of a 4-month-old
baby, were lying in a cornfield, some of them 400 feet from their
apartments, and two were found in a car nearby, Martis said.
   Rescuers went from apartment to apartment, throwing rubble off
of the three-story buildings with shovels or just their hands.
   The death toll was unclear. There were 24 confirmed fatalities
as of 8:30 a.m. today, and there may be 30 dead, said John Plunk,
acting director of the Illinois Emergency Services and Disaster
Agency.
   The Red Cross said about 600 people left homeless were given
shelter.
   Michael Hejka, 28, was at a friend's house in Plainfield, a
community of 4,500, when the tornado hit. ``I saw trees bending,
and I said to my buddy, `It's a tornado!''' Hejka said. ``I said,
`Jump into the bathtub.' He jumped in, and I jumped in right on top
of him. The whole house lifted up, and then came down.''
   Plainfield High School was demolished and some of the 175
students and teachers inside were hurt. Catastrophe was averted
because coaches rushed dozens of athletes from a gym before the
roof collapsed.
   ``We had some very short warnings,'' said teacher Steve
Schernerhorn. ``We immediately took cover.''
   Teacher Mike Salisburg said cars in the parking lot were thrown
hundreds of yards.
   Will County is part of a frequently hit ``tornado alley.'' A
tornado hit Plainfield Township in 1984, injuring six people and
demolishing 14 homes. In 1976, a twister hit Lemont, 10 miles from
Plainfield, killing three people and injuring as many as 40. That
tornado damaged 375 houses and businesses.

<TEXT>
   A proposal to declare crack cocaine houses health
hazards has been dropped and a regulation requiring health and
safety plans for them has been repealed by the King County Health
Board.
   After nine months of grappling with the issue, the panel voted
2-1 Tuesday to leave enforcement of cocaine and other drug laws to
police.
   Board member Greg Nickels, who also serves on the County
Council, said anti-crack regulations ``put the Health Department in
this (law enforcement) role, I believe, inappropriately.''
   He said health inspectors lack the training, experience and
temperament to do police work.
   The regulation requiring crack house health plans was proposed
in December. It was adopted Jan. 3, shortly before a change in
board membership, and took effect July 1.
   But it never was enforced, largely because of concern that it
gave the appearance of sanctioning illegal drug operations.
   Prosecutors drafted extensive amendments to establish a civil
process for declaring premises where crack cocaine is made, sold or
used to be health hazards. The declaration made owners and
operators subject to heavy fines, closure and potential loss of the
property.
   Assuming adequate police drug enforcement efforts, the health
hazard plan would ``give us two stones at one bird,'' said deputy
prosecutor John Cobb.
   ``I think the board felt at the time we should use whatever
tools we have to fight crack houses,'' Hill said.
   The regulation drew fire from civil rights advocates and
advocates for low-income renters and the homeless at a July 24
hearing.
   Opponents noted that health inspectors could enter a dwelling or
apartment house without a search warrant and, if they found drugs,
the landlord could evict everyone, including law-abiding occupants
who might lack access to other housing.
   Authorities said they never expected to get health and safety
plans but hefty fines for failure to file the plans would be a
means to attack crack houses.
   Landlords, tenants and others found responsible could have faced
fines as high as $1,000 for each day a crack house remained in
operation.
   The proposals would not have affected Seattle, where police have
relied on a state law allowing civil abatement proceedings to close
and condemn crack houses after owners fail to end drug operations.

<TEXT>
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq is
expected to declare federated self-rule for Kuwait in a bid to ease
the gulf crisis and the United States to withdraw in partial
victory, senior Arab military officials said Wednesday.
   The idea, already floated to the Soviet Union and the United
States, the sources said, may figure in talks Thursday between
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar in Amman.
   The officials, who spoke on the understanding that neither they
nor their countries be identified, said Saddam was likely to
announce the move before the end of September.
   Under a plan being considered, they said, Kuwait might have
autonomy _ perhaps with a bloc of parliament seats and positions in
the Iraqi national Cabinet. Saddam would accept a timetable and
conditions to protect U.S. interests in the Persian Gulf, the
sources said.
   Such a plan would have little appeal to the Kuwaiti government
now in exile in Saudi Arabia. Saddam's centralized government is
not likely to allow much political or economic leeway.
   According to the officials' analysis, neither Saddam nor
President Bush can withdraw from the lines they have drawn in the
desert sand. Both are buying time until some flexibility can be
found.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2. Six days later, Saddam annexed
Kuwait despite universal condemnation and an American military
buildup in Saudi Arabia. On Aug. 28, he declared Kuwait as Iraq's
19th province.
   The officials said Iraq was still working on the details of its
federation plan which, presumably, would provide a different
statute for Kuwait.
   The idea was passed to Soviet officials who, in turn, relayed it
to Washington, the Arab sources said. Perez de Cuellar is expected
to sound out Aziz and report to Washington.
   ``Iraq's move will take some time,'' one official said. ``But
there should be a surprise from Baghdad in three to four weeks.''
   Bush has repeatedly rejected out of hand any solution but the
withdrawal of Iraqi forces and restoration of the Kuwaiti
government. U.S. officials have made no public acknowledgement of
flexibility.
   But the Arab sources said that privately the Americans are
looking for some compromise which would make their point, assure
stability in the gulf oilfields and allow an honorable
disengagement.
   ``The Americans must bear in mind that Iraq will never let go of
Kuwait,'' one official said.
   If no solution could be negotiated, the others agreed, Kuwait
would have to be retaken by force.
   The officials considered the next three weeks to be crucial to
Washington. U.S. forces can wait until late September when desert
temperatures cool; when more units and heavy weapons, particularly
tanks, arrive; and when troops are acclimatized to the terrain.
   But after that, Saddam's message of Arab unity, along with his
linking of Kuwait to the Israeli-occupied territories, will bolster
his support in the Arab world. Facing off a superpower would
impress the undecided in the Arab world.
   Saddam's strategy appears to be that the longer he can be seen
to be defying, single-handedly, the United States' military might,
the more he will be viewed as the champion of the Arabs.
   Diplomatic sources and intelligence officials in Amman Wednesday
reported that pro-Saddam demonstrations had even erupted in Syria,
Iraq's long-time Arab rival.
   The senior military officials agreed that if Bush does not
strike by the end of September, his administration will be seen to
have failed in a dramatic attempt to rescue Kuwait.
   They felt that Bush is reluctant to test Iraq's ability to
counter-attack.
   ``All diplomatic moves are pushing this way,'' one senior source
said. ``All parties have the conviction that they should not
escalate tension in the gulf while they explore for a peaceful
solution.''
   Iraq offered a form of autonomy to the Kurdish territory of
northern Iraq in 1970. If the Kurdish experience is any model,
federation within Iraq would require difficult bargaining, the
officials acknowledged. Iraq's 3.5 million Kurds have bitterly
resisted rule from Baghdad for decades.
   The Kurds accepted autonomy, with some parliament seats and
positions in the national Cabinet. But two years later, the Kurds
accused Baghdad of reneging and fighting broke out again.
   Saddam, then vice president and strongman of the regime, offered
only limited autonomy. Full-scale guerrilla warfare broke out in
1974. It was crushed a year later when Iran withdrew its support of
the Kurds in exchange for rights in the Shatt-al-Arab waterway on
the border with Iraq.
   In 1980, the Kurds aided Iran in its with Iraq. After the August
1988 cease-fire, Saddam's army killed thousands of Kurds with
poison gas.

   A paraplegic who fought for years to protect the
disabled was hospitalized after a fire that authorities said was
started on the wheelchair ramp he needed to get to his door.
   James Lundvall, 46, was found unconscious in the front bedroom
of his smoke-filled duplex early Tuesday after neighbors saw flames.
   He was in critical condition at Porter Memorial Hospital,
suffering from smoke inhalation.
   Fire investigators believe Lundvall was a random victim of an
arsonist who poured gasoline on the 40-foot wooden wheelchair ramp
at the back of the duplex, then ignited it.
   Whoever set the fire ``kept pouring all the way down the ramp.
They doused it,'' said Fire Capt. Gregory Taft.
   The back of Lundvall's home caught fire and smoke spread quickly
because interior doors had been removed to allow Lundvall to move
through the house in his electric wheelchair.
   ``It doesn't appear he ever woke up,'' said Taft.
   Taft said a car was set afire about six blocks away earlier in
the morning, and investigators were checking for possible links.
   Lundvall was disabled by an auto accident when he was a
teen-ager. He has only limited use of his arms, cannot speak and
communicates with a word board.
   His girlfriend, Debbie Tracy, was killed several weeks ago when
her wheelchair was struck by a car.
   Lundvall has been a champion for the rights of the disabled,
participating in a lawsuit to win the right to live independently,
and in demonstrations across the country to gain handicapped access
to transportation and other services.
   ``He's been a fighter,'' said Wade Blank, a longtime friend and
co-director of the Atlantis Community, an advocacy group for the
disabled.
   Blank recalled that Lundvall pulled his wheelchair in front of a
bus during a 1978 demonstration in Denver and crawled up the steps
of the nation's capital earlier this year to support the rights of
the disabled.
   Lundvall was bothered by youths who stole his television set
about a year ago, but had no recent problems with crime, Blank said.

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait proves that the
world remains a dangerous place despite the reduction of East-West
tensions, Vice President Dan Quayle told veterans at the American
Legion national convention today.
   ``As the Cold War comes to an end, the Free World may be less
burdened with fighting communist aggression. But there's a new
evil: lawlessness and terrorism,'' Quayle said.
   Quayle called Iraq ``an outrageous violator of decency and
civilized international behavior.''
   ``And it falls to America to play a critical role, an
indispensible role in upholding global standards of civility and
decency.''
   Quayle urged congressional support for increased military
spending ``because only a strong America can help bring peace to
the world.''
   Quayle, a former senator from Indiana whose National Guard
service during the Vietnam War became a campaign liability, was
greeted warmly by the Legionnaires. They interrupted his speech
frequently with applause.
   On the opening day Tuesday of the weeklong 72nd American Legion
convention, participants said the GIs sent to the Persian Gulf are
better trained and equipped than ever and have greater public
support than at any time since World War II.
   ``We've got the world on our side as well as the American
public,'' said John Brieden, a 40-year-old Vietnam-era veteran from
Brenham, Texas.
   Brieden said the issues surrounding the Persian Gulf crisis are
better understood than those of Vietnam. ``As a result of that,
they are supporting the current position,'' he said.
   ``During World War II everyone was behind the GI, more than in
Korea or Vietnam,'' said Dick Carrignan, 72, of Fitchburg, Mass., a
paratrooper in France and Germany during World War II. ``People can
see why we're going there just the same as in World War II.''
   Willie M. McLaughlin, a 63-year-old Korean War veteran from
Greenwood, S.C., said troops today are professional soldiers with
at least a high school education, while in Korea many draftees were
in boot camp just a few weeks before seeing action.
   ``They are more mobile now. They can get into action much
quicker,'' said George Cornish, a 61-year-old Korean War veteran
from Canandaigua, N.Y.
   Several vets drew an analogy between the current deployment and
World War II, arguing that in both cases an aggressive nation had
to be held in check.
   ``In the beginning of World War II there were isolationists who
didn't want for us to get into it,'' said former seaman Richard
Ramage, 65, of Franklin, N.J. ``Now, I think probably a lesson was
learned. We waited then and had to mobilize that much quicker to go
and stop Hitler.''
   The veterans expressed optimism that diplomacy would settle the
conflict.
   ``I just hope they don't jump in too fast and pull the trigger
too soon,'' said Cornish.

<HEAD>Leading Indicators Stalled in July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government's main economic forecasting
gauge stalled in July, indicating to analysts that the nation might
have been limping toward recession even before the Middle East
crisis.
   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that its Index of Leading
Economic Indicators was unchanged after posting a barely
perceptible 0.1 percent gain in June.
   The index is designed to forecast economic conditions six months
to nine months in the future.
   ``Essentially, it's another indication of a slumping economy,''
said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a new
York securities company. ``In all likelihood, it'll be down sharply
next month,'' reflecting the oil price shock and uncertainty caused
by the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Gordon Richards, an economist with the National Association of
Manufacturers, said that while the July figures don't point to a
recession, ``the sharp rise in world oil prices has made a downturn
almost inevitable.''
   Three successive declines in the index have often _ but not
always _ signaled a recession in the past. However, some economists
believe the economy already is in a recession.
   In a second report illustrating the weakness in the economy, the
department said new home sales in July posted their fifth decline
in seven months, down 2.3 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual
rate of 548,000 units.
   New home sales so far this year are 12.4 percent below those of
the first seven months of 1989.
   Only three of the 11 indicators in the leading index made
positive contributions: an increase in orders for new plants and
equipment, an increase in the price of raw materials and an index
measuring consumer confidence.
   Analysts said the consumer confidence component, which is
compiled by the University of Michigan, would plummet in the August
index.
   ``Initial reports ... indicate that the consumer's first
reaction to the Iraqi invasion was near panic,'' said economist
Mark M. Zandi of Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa.
   Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity and economists worry that a major cutback could halt
economic growth altogether and push the nation into recession.
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Co.
in Chicago, noted that plant and equipment orders, one of the
positive indicators, usually are a barometer of business investment
plans.
   ``The question now is, how much of that will be held down now by
not knowing what's going to happen and being unwilling to make
decisions?'' he asked.
   Economist Richards suggested that ``because capital is
energy-intensive, the oil price shock points to some scaling back
of investment spending.''
   Negative contributors were: faster business delivery times, a
decline in the money supply, a drop in manufacturers' unfilled
orders, a shorter average work week, a drop in building permits, an
increase in weekly unemployment claims and a decline in the stock
market.
   Daryl Delano of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass., said stock
prices had continued to decline since the Iraqi invasion and,
noting lackluster home sales, said building permits would remain a
negative in the August report.
   One of the July components, orders for consumer goods, was
unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 146.1 percent of its 1982
base of 100 and up 1.4 percent from its level a year ago.

<HEAD>Sandy, Annie's Dog in Broadway Production, Dies at 16</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HADDAM, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sandy, the stray mutt that was rescued from
the pound and went on to star in the Broadway smash ``Annie,'' died
Wednesday in his sleep. He was 16, or 112 in dog years.
   Sandy, a mix of Airedale and Irish setter, originated the role
of Annie's faithful dog in the Goodspeed Opera House's 1976
production in Connecticut. He then played the entire Broadway run,
from 1977 to 1983, said William Berloni, Sandy's owner and trainer.
   It was Berloni, then an 18-year-old apprentice at the Goodspeed
with no experience as an animal trainer, who rescued Sandy from the
Connecticut Humane Society the day before the animal was to be put
to sleep.
   Berloni had been told to find a dog for the production. After
looking at 500 dogs he found Sandy and bought him for $8.
   ``He had been abused, he was frightened of people,'' Berloni
said. ``So when we treated him with kindness and love and
affection, he really responded. That made him easy to train.''
   Sandy won the hearts of theatergoers as the dog that befriends
Annie after she runs away from an orphanage. The two are separated
and spend much of the musical looking for each other until they are
reunited for a happy ending.
   ``It's interesting how one animal touched so many lives,''
Berloni said. ``People liked to believe in fun things and Annie and
Sandy, wherever they went, really brought a lot of joy to people.''
   Sandy had to perform more than 20 stunts during the show,
including barking on a hand signal to protect Annie from the police
and walking across the stage by himself, looking left and right in
search of Annie.
   After the show closed, Sandy retired to Connecticut, but made
occasional guest appearances.
   Sandy suffered in recent years from degenerative arthritis and
bone spurs on his spine that brought on paralysis and general
weakness.
   ``Working dogs ... when they can't do their jobs any more, they
really give up and die,'' Berloni said. ``He decided his time was
up.''

<HEAD>Lawsuit Charges NEA With Subsidizing Anti-Religious Art</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer sued the National Endowment for the
Arts on Wednesday, alleging that its $15,000 grant for an artist's
controversial exhibition displayed ``open and notorious hostility
toward religion'' and violated the Constitution.
   The lawsuit was filed against the NEA and its chairman, John E.
Frohnmayer, in U.S. District Court by the Rutherford Institute, a
non-profit legal services organization, on behalf of David Fordyce.
   Fordyce, a lawyer, was described as a ``devout Christian'' from
Los Angeles.
   The suit cited the NEA's grant last year for ``Tongues of
Flame,'' an exhibit of works by David Wojnarowicz of New York that
was organized by University Galleries at Illinois State University.
   The Fordyce suit alleged that the NEA-supported catalog for the
Wojnarowicz show includes an image depicting Jesus Christ as an
intravenous drug user. It said the catalogue also refers to Roman
Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York as a ``fat cannibal''
and ``the world's most active liar about condoms and safer sex.''
   Fordyce said NEA support for the catalog conveys ``a message of
hate and animosity toward institutionalized religion'' sponsored by
the federal government in violation of the First Amendment's
provision for separation of church and state.
   He asked the court for a permanent injunction prohibiting the
arts endowment from ``funding, sponsoring and endorsing works which
promote blasphemous and sacrilegious hate material.''
   The endowment, an independent, $171 million federal agency that
underwrites a wide variety of artists and arts organizations, had
no immediate comment on the lawsuit.
   The NEA is embroiled in a controversy over art, obscenity and
freedom of expression stemming from allegations by religious
fundamentalists and conservative lawmakers led by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., that it has subsidized obscene and sacrilegious works.
   The endowment already is the target of two other federal
lawsuits in New York and Los Angeles challenging Frohnmayer's
requirement that grant recipients sign a pledge of compliance with
a congressional ban on using federal funds for works that may be
deemed obscene.
   Wojnarowicz could not be reached by telephone for comment. But
Barry Blinderman, director of the Illinois gallery, accused the
lawsuit's sponsors of ``hypocrisy'' and angrily defended the
artist's work against charges of sacrilege.
   ``Before these people condemn the NEA, they should remember that
it was the so-called holy men who didn't accept Christ and turned
him in,'' Blinderman said. ``Jesus said `judge not,' and I
recommend that these people follow the precepts of the God they are
proclaiming.''
   The ``Tongues of Flame'' exhibit opened at Blinderman's gallery
earlier this year and is now appearing at the Santa Monica Museum
of Art in California.
   John W. Whitehead, founder and president of the Rutherford
Institute, told a news conference here that the NEA had
``unconstitutionally used taxpayers' funds to engage in actions
which are hostile toward religion and religious persons.''
   ``The government should not become the patron of hate art
against some of its citizens,'' Whitehead said. ``Religious people
must no longer be the personal targets of cannon fire from National
Endowment projects.''
   Wojnarowicz previously had filed a federal lawsuit in New York
against the Rev. Donald Wildmon and his conservative American
Family Association.
   In late June, a New York federal judge ruled that Wildmon's
group probably had misrepresented Wojnarowicz's works by including
fragments of them in a pamphlet titled ``Your Tax Dollars Helped
Pay for These `Works of Art'.''
   The judge said the pamphlets, which were mailed to members of
Congress, religious leaders and media outlets, probably had damaged
the artist's reputation and the value of his works. He issued an
injunction forbidding further publication of the pamphlet.

   Residents of an area swept by a man-caused
blaze that killed two firefighters can return to their homes today,
but they still will be without power.
   About 300 homes near this alpine community 30 miles east of Salt
Lake City had to be evacuated because of the Wasatch Mountain fire,
which destroyed 19 homes and burned through a 2,970-acre area.
   Andy Gray, Bureau of Land Management fire information officer,
said 680 firefighters completed fire lines around the blaze this
morning. The fire was expected to be declared officially under
control by 8 p.m.
   ``We're looking real good,'' said John Shive, incident commander
of the Interagency Fire Team coordinating firefighting efforts.
``You're still going to see smoke up there for a few days, but
we're in good shape.''
   Power has been off to the Swiss Oaks area since Sunday and will
likely remain off for another week, although Utah Power &amp; Light Co.
has more than 250 workers in the area, Shive said.
   The fire, propelled by 60 mph winds, exploded in tinder-dry oak
brush and pine trees Sunday afternoon. Shive said investigators
believe an ember from a smaller blaze _ ignited by an apparently
illegal campfire _ drifted over fire lines and started the deadly
inferno.
   Officials have not determined who started the blaze.
   Sheriff's Deputy Blake Wright, 39, and county road crew worker
Ralph Broadhead, 65, died Sunday night when apparently overcome by
smoke as they were building a fire break on a ridge.
   Funerals for the two men will be Thursday.

<HEAD>NASA to Get Outside Advice on Long-term Space Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the biggest names in the U.S. space
program have been named as senior members of a group developing a
strategy for long-term American involvement in space.
   Thomas P. Stafford, a retired Air Force lieutenant general and
former astronaut who flew four missions in space, heads the
Synthesis Group which is screening ideas from the general public,
science and industry for new and more efficient ways to explore and
use space.
   He was named to the job by NASA, which has come under pressure
to seek outside advice for its long-range plans.
   Among the 22 senior members whose names Stafford announced
Wednesday are retired Lt. Gen. James A. Abrahamson, former director
of the Strategic Defense Initiative; Edward C. Aldridge Jr., former
Secretary of the Air Force; Chris Kraft, a major NASA figure in the
Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs and Eugene Covert, a member of
the Challenger commission.
   The group was formed to explore alternative ways of meeting
President Bush's goal of establishing a permanent manned base on
the moon and sending missions to Mars.
   ``The president's Space Exploration Initiative is really a
manifesto for this nation in the next century,'' Stafford told a
news conference. ``Through an extensive SEI outreach program,
creative ideas on how best to approach the space frontier have been
gathered.''
   The Bush proposal did not fare well in its first test in
Congress. The House, in approving NASA's 1991 appropriations bill,
eliminated the entire $309 million requested by the administration
for its moon-Mars plans. The vote was 355 to 48.
   Stafford said the group, which will be broken up into teams,
expects to make its recommendations next February to NASA
administrator Richard Truly.

   Syrian military forces killed dozens of
demonstrators backing Saddam Hussein in protests near the Iraqi
border, Arab diplomats and security sources reported Wednesday.
   As many as 50,000 troops were deployed along the Iraq-Syria
border after the army quelled violent protests Sunday and Monday,
according to officials who spoke on condition they not be named.
   Crowds of Syrians poured into the streets of eastern towns
Sunday to protest President Hafez Assad's stand against Iraq, the
sources said.
   A Syrian information ministry official, reached by telephone
from Amman, denied there were any demonstrations and said he had no
knowledge of troop movements. He declined to be named.
   The outbreaks of violence in Syria could become a threat to
Assad, a former air force commander who seized power in November
1970. Assad and Saddam have waged an ideological feud for more than
a decade. Syria and Iraq are ruled by rival wings of the Baath
Socialist Party.
   During the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, Assad was Tehran's main Arab
ally.
   Diplomats and Arab officials in Amman said their embassies in
Damascus, the capital of neighboring Syria, reported scattered
uprisings.
   ``Troops tried all day to stop the demonstrations and reports
from our Damascus embassy said tens of people were killed,'' one
Arab diplomat said. Others reported similar death tolls.
   Demonstrators surged into the streets, carrying huge portraits
of Saddam, chanting slogans and waving Iraqi flags, the reports
said. Some demanded separation from Syria to merge with Iraq.
   Eastern Syria is predominantly Sunni Moslem. Assad and most of
his ruling faction are from the minority Alawite sect, centered in
western Syria.
   The rioting is believed to be the worst violence in Syria since
Assad crushed a Moslem Brotherhood uprising in Hama, north of
Damascus, in 1982. Tanks ringed Hama and pounded it, razing much of
the ancient city and killing thousands.
   During the Hama violence, Syrian officials flatly denied any
disturbances until four days after riots began and the death toll
was already in the hundreds.
   Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2, Assad sent at least
1,100 troops to join an Arab force gathering in Saudi Arabia to
protect the kingdom.
   Assad postponed a scheduled trip to Egypt on Sunday without
explanation, but flew to Alexandria Tuesday for a day of talks with
President Hosni Mubarak.
   Travelers from Syria reported tensions were high, but none who
had visited the turbulent eastern part of the country would confirm
reports of violence.
   ``I know nothing. I can't say anything,'' one trucker said,
hurrying away, visibly frightened.

   Cars keep rolling in for a Chrysler
Corp. employee whose loyalty to organized labor led her to refuse
to accept a Honda she won on a televised lottery game.
   Pamela Richards, of Risingsun, Ohio, got the keys Tuesday to a
white, 1990 Plymouth Acclaim from Chrysler Motors President Robert
Lutz.
   That's the third Chrysler product she's gotten as a result of
her rejection.
   Ms. Richards, an employee of Chrysler subsidiary Toledo
Precision Machining, won a $17,000 Honda Accord as part of a
televised Ohio lottery game earlier this month.
   But she said: ``I don't want that Honda. I am union.''
   Honda Accords are made in Marysville, Ohio, by workers
unaffiliated with any labor union.
   Since then, the AFL-CIO has given her a Dodge Dakota pickup
truck and a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership in Huntington, W.Va.,
loaned her a Chrysler Imperial to use for a year.

   The daughter of 1960s LSD guru Timothy
Leary was again ruled incompetent to stand trial for attempted
murder in the 1988 shooting of her sleeping boyfriend.
   Superior Court Judge Terry Smerling said Tuesday that Susan
Martino, 42, was unable to understand the charges against her and
committed her to a state psychiatric hospital until she could be
found fit.
   In 1989, a judge found Martino unable to stand trial on the
charges. She could be held for up to 14 years if she does not
recover.
   Martino, also known as Susan Leary, was charged with shooting
Joel Ruben Chavira in the back of the head as he took a nap on a
couch in their apartment in Glendale, about 10 miles north of Los
Angeles. She has pleaded innocent.
   Chavira has said that he awoke to a loud explosion in the back
of his head on Dec. 18, 1988. He felt blood and the went into the
kitchen and confronted Martino who was holding a gun.
   Deputy District Attorney Carol Rash said Wednesday that Chavira
underwent skull reconstruction and was released from the hospital
about a month after the attack. She said he was not left seriously
disabled.
   At the time of the shooting, Timothy Leary issued a statement
saying: ``I am extremely distressed about this tragic event. I am
praying for the young man's continued recovery.''

   Actor Johnny Depp, baby-faced star of TV's

   In the 20th Century Fox film ``Edward Scissorhands,'' directed

   The Rap group Public Enemy released a
video with actual footage of the violence at last year's Greekfest
riots just in time for this year's Laborfest. And city officials
aren't happy about it.
   The video version of the song ``Brothers Gonna' Work It Out''
shown on MTV last week ``has grossly misrepresented what Virginia
Beach is trying to do relative to Laborfest,'' city spokeswoman Pam
Lingle said Tuesday.
   ``In fact, it is a disservice to the many black people who are
working so hard to make Laborfest 1990 an enjoyable experience,''
she said. The festival is planned for Labor Day weekend.
   The video showed staged scenes of actors portraying ``redneck''
state troopers and ``insensitive'' bureaucrats with footage of
police kicking and clubbing blacks. It does not show the rioting
and looting by young blacks that preceded the police action, city
officials said.

have been better.
   Organizers blamed the poor turnout partly on Mayor Carmen Bunch,
who refused to allow the Beach Boys to play in Isle of Palms,
citing the traffic headaches the concert would cause. The concert
was held about 20 miles inland, at Ladson.
   Ms. Bunch said Tuesday she wished she had never heard of The
Beach Boys.
   She said the event was not worth all the turmoil, and believes
islanders couldn't afford the tickets.
   ``It was risky business to begin with,'' she said.

   Moviegoers know actress Kym Karath as one of
the Von Trapp kids in ``The Sound of Music,'' but living room video
buffs might not be acquainted with her.
   ``The girl at the edge was always cut off (in the video
version), and I was always on the edge,'' said Miss Karath, who
played Gretl Von Trapp a quarter-century ago.
   Five actors who played Von Trapp youngsters joined last week for
``The Sound of Music'' 25th anniversary celebration and a big
screen redo.
   ``It's thrilling to think that my children are going to see the
movie'' in theaters, said Heather Menzies, who played Louisa Von
Trapp. ``There's a couple of generations of people who haven't seen
it the way it should be seen.''
   Participants in the movie family reunion included Duane Chase,
Charmain Carr and Debbie Turner as well as Miss Karath and Miss
Menzies. Angela Cartwright and Nicholas Hammond couldn't make the
reunion.

<HEAD>Arab-American Organization Petitions For Release Of Hostages In
Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major Arab-American organization began a
nationwide petition campaign Wednesday urging Saddam Hussein to
release all foreign nationals being held hostage in Iraq and Kuwait.
   James Abourezk, chairman of the American-Arab
Anti-Discrimination Committee, said he hoped to personally present
the petition to the Iraqi president in Baghdad.
   Abourezk, a former senator from South Dakota, said the Iraqi
Embassy in Washington had not replied to the committee's request to
send a delegation to Baghdad.
   He said he didn't know whether the petition would sway Saddam to
release foreign hostages, ``but it would be remiss on our part not
to try.''
   The appeal says the release of those held against their will
would lessen the ``extreme tension'' in the Middle East and could
lead to a resolution of the crisis.
   ADC's Washington headquarters is sending the petition to all
25,000 of its members in 70 nationwide chapters. It hopes to obtain
tens of thousands of signatures from Arab-Americans and other
American citizens. There are about 2.5 million people of Arab
origins in the United States.
   Iraq has detained thousands of foreigners, including about 3,000
Americans, since its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Some of the
foreigners have been moved to key installations to act as human
shields against an attack from the United States or other foreign
forces.
   The petition campaign coincides with the group's efforts to
combat what it calls a disturbing increase in anti-Arab
discrimination in the United States since the gulf crisis began.
   The committee has chronicled several dozen cases of
Arab-Americans being threatened or attacked in the United States.
It also blamed the media, particularly radio talk shows, for
stirring up anti-Arab sentiments through racist or discriminatory
remarks.
   ``We are trying to do away with an incredible amount of
stereotyping and racism,'' said Abdeen Jabara, outgoing committee
president.

   The main fundamentalist Moslem movement in the
occupied territories on Wednesday urged Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait, saying that Palestinians ``are aware more than others of
the meaning of losing a homeland.''
   It was the strongest anti-Iraq statement to date in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, where Palestinians have shown strong
support for Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein since his Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   The appeal came in a leaflet issued by the Hamas, or ``zeal,''
movement.
   In a separate leaflet, the underground leadership of the
Palestinian uprising repeated its opposition to the deployment of
U.S. forces in the gulf.
   The underground leaders, backed by the Palestine Liberation
Organization, urged Saddam ``not to respond to provocations or take
measures that could be seen as reasons for (the U.S.) launching an
aggression against Iraq.''
   Both leaflets called for the withdrawal of foreign forces from
the gulf and their replacement by Arab peacekeepers.
   The position taken by Hamas was a shift from its last leaflet,
which focused on aggression by ``America and all its devilish
allies'' but said nothing about Iraq's move against Kuwait.
   Moslem fundamentalists here, who want an Islamic state, are wary
of Saddam because he has been an advocate of secularism. Hamas has
been a leading force in the nearly 33-month-old Palestinian
uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
   In its latest leaflet, Hamas said: ``We are aware more than
others of the meaning of losing a homeland and the pains of exile.
We are aware of the agony of the Moslem Kuwaiti people.''
   The leaflet called for Kuwaiti self-determination along with
negotiations to resolve Iraqi-Kuwaiti tensions.
   ``Any solution must include the withdrawal of foreign forces
from the region and the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait,''
Hamas said.
   Meanwhile, Israel's Interior Ministry banned Palestinian
professor Ghassan Khatib from traveling abroad. Khatib, an
economist at the West Bank's Bir Zeit University, was the fourth
Palestinian blocked from attending a convention in Switzerland on
grounds it would endanger Israeli security.
   ``I think this is part of new restrictions they (Israel's
government) are using right now, taking advantage of the gulf
crisis to put more pressures on Palestinians,'' Khatib said. ``They
know the world is focused on the gulf and will not pay any
attention to their measures.''
   Also Wednesday, the body of a Palestinian suspected of
collaborating with Israeli authorities was found near his home in
the Tulkarem refugee camp in the West Bank. The victim was
identified by Arab reporters as Faisal Mansuri, 35.
   The death raised to 254 the number of Palestinians killed by
fellow Arabs in the uprising. At least 728 Palestinians have been
killed by Israeli soldiers or civilians, and 47 Israelis have died
in the violence.

   Police used birdshot, batons
and tear gas Wednesday to disperse student marches against fighting
in black townships. Three blacks died in new violence, raising the
toll to 518 in less than three weeks.
   Also Wednesday, delegations linked to the African National
Congress and the conservative Inkatha movement met in Natal
Province to discuss the violence, according to news reports.
   The independent South Africa Press Association reported a member
of the ANC's national executive committee, Jacob Zuma, took part.
   Inkatha, who are supported by the Zulus, have been at war with
ANC-affiliated groups since the mid-1980s in Natal. Battles erupted
in the townships around Johannesburg on Aug. 12.
   Low-level delegations from Inkatha and the ANC have met
previously, but ANC leaders have refused to meet Zulu leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi. They contend Inkatha spread the conflict to
the Johannesburg area this month to broaden its constituency.
Inkatha accuses the ANC of terrorizing other black opposition
groups to try to consolidate power.
   Inkatha and the ANC both oppose apartheid, South Africa's system
of racial separation, but they differ on ways to fight it.
   Buthelezi reiterated his call Wednesday for a meeting with ANC
deputy president Nelson Mandela. He also said in a statement the
ANC should end, instead of merely suspending, its armed struggle
and stop calling for sanctions to push South Africa to end
apartheid.
   The violence around Johannesburg has eased markedly since the
initial days of fighting, when dozens of blacks were killed daily.
But protests against the fighting and allegations of police bias
toward Inkatha have continued.
   In Cape Town on Wednesday, police fired tear gas and birdshot at
students from the University of the Western Cape, near Cape Town,
who were protesting the recent violence, witnesses said.
   Police Maj. Gys Boonzaaier told the independent South Africa
Press Association the students were throwing rocks at police and
passing vehicles.
   Separate protests against the fighting also were held in
Johannesburg and Pretoria.
   Police used batons and tear gas to disperse a march by students
from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, SAPA
reported. Forty-six students were arrested and two police officers
slightly injured, police said.
   Later, students from several organizations held a protest along
a downtown street to protest the police action.
   Riot police in Pretoria halted a march by students of the
Medical Univerity of South Africa, police and the university's
rector said. The students said they had not sought permission for
the march.
   In the township violence, two men were hacked to death and set
alight at a migrant workers hostel in Tembisa, northeast of
Johannesburg, while another died at a hostel in Katlehong,
southeast of the city, police said.
   Some anti-apartheid leaders have blamed police for fueling the
fighting in the townships.
   President F.W. de Klerk told Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu
and other church leaders Tuesday he would investigate charges that
police sided with Inkatha.
   De Klerk has previously said individual officers may have acted
improperly but that the police force as a whole followed orders to
be impartial.

<HEAD>Zinc Research Could Help Develop AIDS Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE SAKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CATONSVILLE, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chemist says he has determined that
zinc plays a key role in the spread of the AIDS virus, which could
lead to a vaccine or drugs to combat the disease.
   Michael Summers, a chemistry professor at the University of
Maryland Baltimore County, said Tuesday he had found that zinc is
the glue that binds one protein critical to the virus' duplication
to the genetic material that makes the virus infectious.
   Zinc is present in the body. If researchers can develop a drug
that alters, eliminates or masks the zinc, the infectious material
won't exist when new virus cells are formed, Summers told reporters.
   ``This research has important implications for the development
of an AIDS vaccine,'' Summers said. He said healthy people could be
injected with non-infectious virus to make them develop an immunity
to the infectious form.
   He emphasized that a vaccine was still a long way off, but said
the research provides another avenue for pharmaceutical companies
developing drugs against AIDS.
   Summers' findings were published Tuesday in Biochemistry, a
weekly journal of the American Chemical Society.
   He said the results are similar to those that led to the
development of the AIDS-fighting drug AZT. AIDS attacks the body's
immune system, rendering it helpless to fight disease.
   A biochemist at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
agreed that the findings are an important, albeit small, step.
   ``It really does present a new avenue of research which had been
at least underappreciated if not completely unrecognized,'' said
Jeremy Berg, who suggested zinc as a molecular glue in certain
viruses four years ago.
   Wayne Koff, an AIDS vaccine researcher at the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., called the findings
interesting.
   ``In addition to potentially being an approach for development
of vaccines, this research has provided potentially another target
for drug development,'' said Koff.
   Summers said scientists at the National Cancer Institute in
Frederick have begun work on a drug based on his research, but
cautioned that there's no known way to alter the zinc.
   Berg said that even if Summers' research leads to a vaccine, it
may not be effective in all cases.
   ``There are so many different forms of the virus and it changes
so quickly, even if you were immune to one type of the virus, you
probably wouldn't be immune to other types,'' he said.

   The State Department said today that Iraq's
promise to allow all foreign women and children to leave the
country is a ``significant step in the right direction'' if it is
carried out.
   It said the Iraqi announcement could affect about 1,000 American
women and children.
   ``This announcement of Saddam Hussein, if implemented, is a
significant step in the right direction. We have heard statements
like this before, and we hope Saddam Hussein will have the human
decency to live up to his word,'' said department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler.
   She said that about a third of the approximately 3,000 American
citizens in Kuwait and Iraq are women and children. She said there
are about 500 women in Kuwait, 25 of whom are pregnant; 350
children, ages 3 to 18; and 60 infants under 3 years of age. She
did not have a precise breakdown for Iraq.
   Ms. Tutwiler said the United States would prefer that the
Americans be evacuated via charter aircraft from Kuwait City and
Baghdad.
   She spoke after the Iraq ambassador formally notified the State
Department of Saddam's decision, announced Tuesday.
   Ambassador Mohamed Al-Mashat told reporters after meeting with
department officials that the Americans will be allowed to leave
through Jordan or Turkey but gave no timetable for their departure.
   ``It is not possible administratively that everybody go on the
same day,'' Al-Mashat said. He said he did not know whether the
Iraqi government would provide aircraft to facilitate the
departures.
   Al-Mashat said once the United States gives assurances ``that
they are not going to strike Iraq, and attack Iraq or aggress upon
Iraq, then we are going to let even men out.''
   In response, Ms. Tutwiler said the United States rejects the
notion that ``there should be any conditions attached to the
immediate safe departure of all foreign nationals, including
Americans who wish to depart from Iraq and Kuwait.

   A religious cult leader was convicted
today of killing a family of five last year and burying them on a
farm where his group lived.
   A Lake County Common Pleas Court jury deliberated three hours
and 15 minutes before rendering the verdict against Jeffrey
Lundgren.
   He showed no emotion when the verdict was read by Judge Martin
O. Park.
   Lundgren could be sentenced to death. A sentencing date was not
announced.
   Earlier today, Lundgren's wife was sentenced to five consecutive
life prison terms for the murders that she blamed on her husband.
   Alice Lundgren, 39, appeared calm during her sentencing before
Lake County Common Pleas Judge Paul H. Mitrovich.
   But outside the courtroom, with sheriff's deputies at her side,
Mrs. Lundgren wept as she read a statement of remorse.
   ``I am not a cold-blooded murderer. He is,'' Mrs. Lundgren told
reporters, referring to her husband.
   ``I, too, was numbered on the list (of intended victims),'' she
said. ``I am not the `Angel of Death.' I am the mother of four.''
   Mrs. Lundgren was convicted Aug. 1 on all counts against her _
five each of conspiracy and complicity to commit aggravated murder
and five counts of kidnapping.
   Lundgren, 40, was charged with five counts each of aggravated
murder and kidnapping in the deaths last year of Dennis Avery, his
wife and three young daughters, whose bodies were found buried on
the Lundgrens' rented farm in nearby Kirtland, 30 miles east of
Cleveland.
   All five had been bound, gagged and shot to death, then dumped
into a common grave. Their bodies, heaped with some personal
belongings and debris, were found in early January.
   During her trial, Mrs. Lundgren testified that her husband
sometimes hit her or threatened her by pointing a loaded gun to her
head if she disputed him or balked at his orders.
   She also said Lundgren had spoken of killing the Averys, whom he
criticized as being less zealous in cult beliefs, as a sacrifice so
that cult members could see God. But she said she disregarded his
talk ``because he'd come up with these wild-haired plans all the
time and he didn't carry through.''
   Three cult members who pleaded guilty in the case testified
during her trial that Mrs. Lundgren got favors over the other cult
women, by virtue of being the leader's wife, and that she urged the
other women to obey him as a prophet.
   The prosecution said Mrs. Lundgren willfully helped her husband
kill the Averys and should have warned authorities of his talk or
told them after the fact.
   Lundgren had been a lay minister for the Reorganized Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, in Kirtland, but was defrocked
in 1988 for inappropriate conduct and later formed his own sect,
church officials said.
   The Lundgrens' 19-year-old son, Damon, also was among the 13
cult members arrested in January. He faces the same charges as his
father and awaits trial.

   California was the most populous of the states. New York
retained its grip on second place, with Texas a close third as the
last four state population reports were made public.
   The new figures issued show both Illinois and Pennsylvania
declining from 1980, to put Florida in fourth place.
   The reports for New York, Texas, Illinois and Pennsylvania
completed the listing of all 50 states in the bureau's first round

   New York was up slightly from 1980 to 17,626,586 while Texas
jumped sharply to 16,824,665.
   Illinois dropped slightly to 11,325,247 and Pennsylvania also

<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission warned consumers
Wednesday to be leery of energy saving schemes, saying the public
can be duped by get-rich proposals and devices claiming to save
gasoline.
   ``Unscrupulous individuals often attempt to exploit situations
like the present one by taking advantage of consumers,'' said FTC
chairman Janet Steiger.
   The FTC was joined in the warning by the National Association of
Attorneys General.
   Attorney General Mary Sue Terry of Virginia, president of the
association, noted that with the Labor Day weekend ahead
``consumers should stay away from devices or fuel additives that
claim to significantly increase fuel mileage.''
   Rising energy prices and concern about future oil supplies is
likely to unleash an array of fraudulent schemes ranging from the
sale of phony gas-saving devices to oil and gas investment frauds,
the FTC said.
   Among the things the FTC warned consumers about were:
   _ Phony investment schemes involving oil or gas partnerships,
gold and silver mining or oil drilling that promise much higher
rates of return than normally might be expected.
   ``When Wall Street is jittery, all kinds of investment scams
appear,'' warned the FTC.
   _ Energy saving devices such as surge suppressors or furnace
``duty cyclers'' that may be costly without providing significant
energy savings.
   _ Home improvement scams including the sale of improper solar
energy systems, storm windows, siding or insulation. In some cases
the promised energy savings may never be achieved, the agency said.
   ``If the savings claims appear unrealistic, they probably are,''
said the FTC.
   _ Gadgets or gasoline additives that are supposed to improve
automobile mileage. ``None of these products has been found to
significantly increase fuel economy,'' said the FTC.
   The agency suggested the best ways to save gasoline is to
inflate tires to their proper pressure, remove excess weight from
the car's trunk and make sure the car is properly tuned. It also
advised against use of high octane gasoline unless it is
recommended in the automobile manuel. Higher octane gasoline is
more expensive and often does not improve car performance.
   The FTC also warned the public to be aware of telemarketing
techniques that offer ``great bargains'' because of the oil crisis
and reminded that calls to ``900'' numbers often cost from $2 to
$45 a minute.
   ``Telemarketing techniques themselves are not deceptive, indeed,
many reputable companies use them. But in the hands of unscrupulous
individuals, they can hurt consumers,'' said the FTC.

   The U.S. ambassador to Jordan waited at the Iraqi border today
to see if Saddam Hussein would make good on his promise to release
Western women and children held in Iraq.
   The State Department called the Iraqi offer Tuesday a
``significant step in the right direction'' if it is carried out.
It said the Iraqi announcement could affect about 1,000 American
women and children.
   Iraq's ambassador to the United States today refused to give a
timetable for their departure but said Iraq would also free the
detained men after getting assurances from the United States that
it would not attack.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk told reporters: ``I have no
evidence ... indicating that people have been allowed to leave.''
   The spokesman also refused to confirm or deny a report that the
administration had received a message from the Iraqi president,
offering to pull out his invading troops from Kuwait with
conditions.
   In another development, OPEC voted to increase its oil
production to make up for shortages caused by the embargo on Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil.
   Japan promised to send money, medical personnel and non-military
supplies to the Persian Gulf, but not soldiers, weapons or other
military supplies. However, the aid package also will allow Japan
to pay other countries chartering ships and planes to carry
military cargo to the gulf.
   Thirteen people who were part of the U.S. mobilization died
today when a giant C-5A cargo plane en route to the Persian Gulf
region crashed on takeoff from Ramstein Air Base in West Germany.
There were four survivors.
   President Bush today delivered a pep talk to U.S. troops
broadcast over Armed Forces Radio. He said their assignment in
Saudi Arabia and elsewhere in the gulf is ``one of the toughest
military missions in modern memory.''
   ``You stand on the front line against aggression and
international lawlessness,'' Bush said. ``We have never sought
conflict nor do we hope to chart a course for other nations, but at
the hands of injustice in the face of aggression, ours is a once
reluctant fist now clutched resolutely.''
   Many in the region apparently did not immediately hear it
because the radio network does not have a transmitter in Saudi
Arabia. The only place it could be received there is at permanent
U.S. barracks on Saudi military bases.
   Saddam announced Tuesday that the women and children among the
thousands of foreigtn hostages in Iraq could leave today.
   However, no Western hostages had crossed the Jordanian border by
mid-afternoon, and reports from Baghdad said their departure was
stalled because they did not have the required exit visas.
   In Washington, Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed Al-Mashat told reporters
after meeting with State Department officials that the Americans
will be allowed to leave through Jordan or Turkey but gave no
timetable for their departure.
   Al-Mashat said once the United States gives assurances ``that
they are not going to strike Iraq, and attack Iraq or aggress upon
Iraq, then we are going to let even men out.''
   A handful of Westerners today arrived from Baghdad on a Iraqi
Airways flight to Amman, the Jordanian capital. But none appeared
to belong to the hostage group of women and children who were told
they are free to leave Iraq.
   Ambassador Roger Harrison traveled to the Jordanian border post
of Ruweishid, 210 miles northeast of Amman, to supervise the
reception of any American women and children arriving there, the
embassy said.
   American diplomatic officials have manned the border
round-the-clock for two weeks in case any U.S. hostages were freed.
Harrison's presence suggested new arrivals were imminent.
   British officials told Iraq today they are ready to send
aircraft to Baghdad to pick up Western women and children. But they
also said they doubted the sincerity of Saddam's offer.
   ``It is a cat and mouse game _ now a little mercy, now some more
ruthlessness,'' Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in London.
``His purpose, as far as one can tell, is to keep the human shield
policy but divert attention by little acts of mercy from the main
and totally unacceptable policy.''
   A senior Jordanian official at Ruweishid said by telephone that
he expected a number of freed Westerners to pass through the border
point today, but he was unsure when they might arrive.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today that Japan will not
transport soldiers or weapons to the Persian Gulf, but he pledged
money, medical personnel and non-military supplies. The assistance
package, unveiled in a nationally televised speech, fell short of
the aid sought by the United States.
   U.S. Ambassador to Japan Michael H. Armacost on Tuesday night
had urged Tokyo to help transport soldiers and weapons.
   While Japanese craft would not be used to ferry military
personnel or weapons, the package will allow payment to other
nations chartering transportation carrying such cargo. The
constitution Japan drew up with U.S. help after World War II bars
Tokyo from sending troops overseas.
   In Vienna today, OPEC oil cartel ministers approved a deal
permitting increased production by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and some
other nations to help offset losses arising from the shortfall
caused by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The embargo against Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil removed about 4
millions barrels of oil a day from world markets, driving up the
price of heating oil and gas.
   Meanwhile, the buildup of troops and hardware showed no sign of
letup on either side of the Saudi-Kuwait border.
   The Pentagon said Iraqi troop strength in and around Kuwait has
increased to 265,000, and dozens of heavy U.S. tanks arrived in
Saudi Arabia on Tuesday and wheeled northward into the desert.
   On the diplomatic side, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar was to hold talks Thursday in Jordan with Iraq's foreign
minister on the crisis that began with Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
oil-rich Kuwait.
   Saddam's promise to free all the foreign women and children came
in a statement from Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council. The move
came hours after Iraqi television showed Saddam meeting captive
foreign families and hearing them express concern for their
children.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said the decision was made ``to
preserve the Arab humanitarian image.''
   The Iraqi News Agency said the foreigners could leave starting
today. It was not known how many women and children were among the
hostages in Iraq or whether the decree also applies to foreigners
in Kuwait.
   Saddam has detained 21,000 Westerners. About 3,000 Americans
were in Kuwait and 500 in Iraq during the invasion, but an
undetermined number have escaped.
   British and U.S. officials say Iraq has moved more than 150
Britons and more than 60 Americans from Kuwait to strategic
locations for use as human shields against a possible attack.
   Iraq's troop strength in and near Kuwait has increased to
265,000 soldiers, supported by larger numbers of tanks and
artillery, the Pentagon said Tuesday.
   ``There's been a general trend in the past several days of these
numbers increasing,'' said Pete Williams, the Defense Department
spokesman.
   Last week, Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said 160,000 to
200,000 Iraqi troops were in Kuwait and southern Iraq together with
an estimated 1,000 tanks.
   About 60,000 U.S. troops backed by dozens of planes and dozens
of warships have assembled in the Persian Gulf region since the
Iraqi invasion.
   It was unclear how many troops in the region heard Bush's
message. Armed Forces Radio has some satellite receiver stations in
the area, but they are not fully operational, Maj. Lon Oakley said
from McDill Air Force Base in Florida.

<HEAD>Three Charged With Adultery in Connecticut</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Adultery charges have been filed
against two women and a man in separate incidents in southeastern
Connecticut.
   In New London, police arrested Bobbie Jo Johnson, 19, around
dawn Tuesday, and charged her with adultery _ a misdemeanor
punishable by up to one year in prison.
   Her husband, 32-year-old Clarence Johnson Jr., saw her
``involved with'' another man, according to the police report.
Clarence Johnson was arrested earlier Tuesday morning on breach of
peace charges in what police described as a domestic disturbance.
   Also Tuesday, Richard R. Wasik, 36, was charged in East Lyme.
The woman with whom Wasik was allegedly involved, Debra J. Darling,
35, was arrested four hours later on the same charge, police said.
   Wasik's wife, Virginia B. Wasik, 32, filed the adultery
complaints June 15, stating that her husband and Ms. Darling
admitted to the affair. Ms. Wasik said the affair began in August
1989.
   She said she followed the couple to a house in Niantic, and then
filed the complaint with East Lyme police.
   ``I just want to put our lives back together,'' she said. ``I
feel bad I had to do this to him.''
   The rarely enforced adultery law surfaced in June when Dawn
Jakubowski, wife of Norwich Board of Education member James R.
Jakubowski, was arrested on the charge. The case is pendin$2.5 billion
through September.
   Japan pledged money, medical assistance and non-military
supplies, but said it would not provide soldiers or weapons.
   _ The administration confirmed it had asked Congress to approve
a $2.2 billion dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia, including 24 F-15
warplanes, 150 M-60 A-3 tanks, 200 shoulder-fired Stinger missiles
and 50 launchers and several thousand rounds of anti-tank
ammunition.
   Other arms deals were being considered, the administration said.
   As for the proposed release of women and children, about 1,000
Americans could be affected.
   ``We hope Saddam Hussein will have the human decency to live up
to his word,'' State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   Popadiuk said, ``I have no evidence ... indicating that people
have been allowed to leave.''
   Yet, Iraq's ambassador to the United States, Mohamed Al-Mashat,
went to the State Department to formally notify the United States
of the decision to let women and children go. He said Americans
will be allowed to leave through Jordan or Turkey, but gave no
timetable for their departure.
   Al-Mashat said that once the United States gives assurances
``that they are not going to strike Iraq, and attack Iraq or
aggress upon Iraq, then we are going to let even men out.''
   From the Oval Office, Bush offered words of appreciation for the
U.S. forces in the gulf.
   ``Our troops around the world are providing the kind of strength
and security that makes this mission possible,'' Bush said. ``And
with the support of friends and family and the admiration of this
great nation, you're proving that you'll do what it takes at any
hour, anywhere, to contain aggression and keep freedom's light
alive.''
   The message was beamed live over Armed Forces Radio but was not
heard by most U.S. soldiers because the radio network does not have
a transmitter in Saudi Arabia. The White House said it was heard on
ships in the area.
   In Dhahran, Navy Capt. Mike Sherman said transcripts and tape
recordings of the speech will be distributed to each unit stationed
in Saudi Arabia, a process which, including delivery time, would
take a week.
   Bush encouraged the troops to ``stand strong'' despite many
hardships.
   He told them, ``You stand on the front line against aggression
and international lawlessness.''
   ``We have never sought conflict nor do we hope to chart a course
for other nations, but at the hands of injustice in the face of
aggression, ours is a once reluctant fist now clutched
resolutely,'' he said.
   ``It is your presence, your skills, your talents, your judgment
that bring America's principles to life and give them strength and
meaning,'' Bush said.

   A novice pilot with a ``Top Gun'' fixation
buzzed a swimming pool and performed acrobatic stunts before
crashing a plane into a car, killing himself and the car's driver,
according to a lawsuit.
   Brian Knox, 18, of Auburn, N.H., had made his first solo flight
the day before the fiery crash Aug. 3 in Northampton County, says
the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit was filed Tuesday in Northampton County Court by
Rella and Anthony Sisonick, parents of Jonelle Sisonick, 23, whose
car was struck as she backed out of a driveway.
   The defendants included Knox's estate and the American Flight
Academy of Allentown, which owned the Cessna 150L airplane and
taught Knox to fly.
   The suit contends the academy gave substandard instruction and
failed to recognize and correct Knox's hazardous attitude. It seeks
compensatory and punitive damages for the loss of Miss Sisonick's
potential lifetime income and the pain that preceded her death.
   Knox, who was scheduled to enter aviation engineering studies at
the University of New Hampshire, had seen the Tom Cruise hit movie
``Top Gun'' about Navy pilots 50 times, according to the lawsuit.
   Knox took off from Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton Airport and
performed acrobatic maneuvers for an hour over the Palmer Lions
Pool and his grandparents' house, according to the suit.
   The academy's operations manager, Eric Zupolski, said he could
not comment on pending litigation.

   Eighteen cars of a 103-car Conrail freight
train derailed early Wednesday, tearing up tracks in both
directions and forcing Amtrak to reroute two passenger trains.
   The Conrail cars, carrying lumber and retail goods, left the
tracks midway between Latrobe and Greensburg about 6 a.m., said
Conrail spokeswoman Pat Linskey. The train was en route from
Pittsburgh to Baltimore.
   Conrail said the wreckage was expected to be cleared and the
tracks repaired by Wednesday night.
   Amtrak rerouted its eastbound Chicago-to-New York Broadway
Limited, which stops in Pittsburgh, and its Pennsylvanian, which
originates in Harrisburg and Philadelphia en route to New York.
   The rerouting forced the Broadway Limited to miss its usual
Greensburg stop and an overall two-hour delay in its run to New
York was expected, said Cliff Black, an Amtrak spokesman.
   The eastbound Pennsylvanian missed stops in Latrobe and
Greensburg and its trip was expected to take 1{ hours longer than
usual, he said.
   The cause of the derailment, which occurred in a wooded valley
three miles west of Latrobe in Unity Township, was under
investigation, Ms. Linskey said.

<TEXT>
   Armenia's parliament put the republic under
emergency rule, banned a nationalist paramilitary group and blocked
roads around the capital Wednesday after a string of attacks left
an Armenian legislator dead.
   The central Soviet government was not involved in the decision.
A curfew from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. was imposed throughout the
republic, and an Interior Ministry officer said troops with armored
vehicles were guarding all roads to Yerevan, the capital, allowing
passage only by special permit.
   Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan appealed in a radio
broadcast for calm. ``I assure you that we, the Armenian
authorities, are in a position to eliminate the danger posed by
this armed organization,'' Ter-Petrosyan said. ``There should be no
panicking.''
   Alexander Arzumanyan, a spokesman for the Armenian National
Movement, and Raffi Hovannisian, a Yerevan representative of the
Armenian Assembly of America, said in telephone interviews that the
attacks began early Wednesday.
   According to their description of events, members of the
renegade Armenian National Army attacked a gas station and shot and
wounded three people.
   An Armenian legislator, Viktor Aivazian, was then shot to death
as he approached the headquarters of the Armenian National Army to
investigate the gas station incident. Also killed in the shooting
was Gehavnik Manukyan, an officer of armed Armenian National
Movement troops loyal to the republic's government.
   Later Wednesday, members of the Armenian National Army attacked
the headquarters of the Armenian Nationalist Movement with
automatic weapons, according to the official Tass news agency. Tass
said the attack lasted about an hour. No casualties were reported.
   Also Wednesday, another member of Armenia's parliament, Rafael
Ishkhanian, was run over by a vehicle without plates and was in
critical condition, Hovannisian said.
   It was unclear if Ishkhanian was hit deliberately. But
Hovannisian said the parliament stood for a moment of silence for
both Aivazian and Ishkhanian before unanimously adopting the state
of emergency.
   Parliament also banned the Armenian National Army, which was
formed in January and claims to protect Armenians from attacks by
armed groups from the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan. However,
ANA members have attacked police stations and gasoline depots in
Armenia to seize the weapons and fuel they need to fight
Azerbaijanis.
   Armenia, which is mostly Christian, and Azerbaijan, which is
mostly Moslem, have been engaged for more than two years in a
bloody dispute for jurisdiction over Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely
Armenian enclave that lies within Azerbaijan. At least 300 people
have been killed in the fighting.
   At times, Armenian officials have appeared to tolerate the
Armenian National Army, which is believed to have several hundred
hard-core fighters and many more sympathizers. But on Wednesday,
the republic's leaders formally outlawed the vigilante group.
   ``The people's patience has run out,'' Ter-Petrosyan said in his
radio address. ``They can no longer bear the adventurism of these
armed detachments which endanger both the security of our citizens
and the formation of our statehood.''
   Parliament demanded that members of the Armenian National Army
turn in their weapons by Wednesday night and hand over the
buildings and vehicles they have seized. It said members of the
group who comply would receive an amnesty and that those who
resisted would be detained and punished ``with the strict severity
of the law.''
   The Armenian legislators _ themselves ardent nationalists who
have declared independence from the Soviet Union _ said the state
of emergency would be imposed solely by police and troops under
their control, not by Soviet forces.
   An Interior Ministry duty officer in Yerevan, who declined to be
identified by name, said all vehicles trying to enter the city
would be turned away unless they had permits from local
authorities. He said this was to prevent more Armenian National
Army units from reaching the city.
   He also said Azerbaijanis had shut off the only natural gas
pipeline to Yerevan, leaving most of the city's 1.2 million
residents without cooking fuel.
   The state of emergency in Armenia is different in key respects
from one declared in Azerbaijan on Jan. 15. In Azerbaijan, Soviet
authorities imposed the emergency after gangs in the capital, Baku,
attacked Armenians and 25 people were reported killed.
   It has been lifted throughout the republic except in Baku and
along the Armenian border.
   Armenia's parliament passed a declaration of independence last
week, becoming the fifth Soviet republic to vote to sever from the
central Soviet state. Armenia, which borders Turkey and Iran, has
3.3 million people.
   The independence declaration calls for creation of Armenia's own
armed forces to safeguard the border, which last week was the scene
of violent conflict with Azerbaijanis. The declaration also calls
for Nagorno-Karabakh to become part of Armenia.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev issued a decree last month
ordering illegal paramilitary groups to disarm and disband. The
decree was his latest attempt to end the violence along the
Armenia-Azerbaijan border. It was largely ignored.

   Vice President Dan Quayle said Wednesday
that the threat to peace posed by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
vindicates the Republican-led U.S. military buildup of the past
decade.
   And he said it proves more than ever the need for the Strategic
Defense Initiative.
   Addressing the 72nd annual meeting of the American Legion,
Quayle said the lessening of East-West tension has not diminished
the need for a strong national defense, including the SDI space
shield against nuclear weapons.
   ``As the Cold War comes to an end, the free world may be less
burdened with fighting communist aggression. But there's a new
evil: lawlessness and terrorism,'' Quayle told the veterans.
   ``There are still brutal dictators who prefer the rule of the
jungle instead of the rule of law,'' he said.
   Saddam Hussein has used chemical weapons on his own people,
supports terrorism, and uses Americans and others as human shields,
Quayle said.
   Quayle said President Bush will not be satisfied until Iraq
withdraws all of its forces from Kuwait and ensures the security of
Saudi Arabia and the rest of the oil-rich gulf region.
   ``Make no mistake about it. What is at stake in the Persian Gulf
is nothing less than the shape of tomorrow,'' Quayle said.
   ``This is the first international crisis in the post-Cold War
era. If Saddam Hussein's aggression remains unchecked, new and more
terrible aggression will surely follow,'' the vice president said.
   Quayle criticized Congress for recent cuts in defense programs
that would leave U.S. military forces with fewer options and less
preparation to deal with sudden crises such as the current one in
the gulf.
   He said he was grateful for the general military buildup that
has occurred under Bush and former President Reagan, and he called
for new investment in research and development and in the SDI
system, sometimes referred to as Star Wars.
   Iraq and other regional powers are gaining ballistic missile
capability, he said.
   ``That's why the president thinks strategic defense makes more
sense in the 1990s than ever before,'' Quayle said. ``That is why
we will continue our work to slow and stop the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them.''
   Quayle, a former Indiana senator whose own National Guard rather
than regular military service became a campaign liability two years
ago, was interrupted frequently with applause and by two standing
ovations.
   That contrasted with the cool reception he received during a
1989 speech to a Veterans of Foreign Wars meeting.
   Quayle drew chuckles when he refered to President Bush's
celebrated campaign gaffe before the Legion two years ago, when he
said Pearl Harbor Day was Sept. 7, 1941, instead of Dec. 7.
   ``I was with the president this morning to ask him for a few
tips of what I ought to say today. He told me the exciting time he
had talking to you two years ago, but that I should be especially
careful if I start talking about Pearl Harbor.''

   This volleyball game, like those on
California beaches, is played in the sand. But there's no ocean in
the Saudi desert, and the troops at play are wearing boots and
bulky uniform pants.
   Several miles away, at another camp for American troops, the
helicopter mechanics are just getting up as the sun goes down _ if
they were lucky enough to catch some sleep during the scorching hot
day.
   Further down the road, some Marines are adopting an Arab custom,
covering their heads and necks, mostly with T-shirts, to block the
sun.
   To beat the heat and the boredom, American troops are sleeping
during the day, working at night and trying to organize
recreational activities to make a far-away place a bit more
bearable.
   The helicopter mechanics are among a growing number of troops
who do their work at night to escape the heat of day, which often
reaches 120 degrees. One maintenance worker, 35-year-old Gary Stutz
from MacGuire Air Force Base in New Jersey, says he and his
co-workers slowly are adjusting.
   He says the Air Force is helping by getting the men desert
uniforms and lighter boots, with a cloth upper body instead of
leather.
   Air Force Sgt. David Klunker's solution to the heat is to take
off his shirt, but he's been told it's against the rules.
   Three weeks into the deployment of U.S. troops here, some say
they're geting used to the heat. Others say they never will.
   Air Force Sgt. Alan Wagner of Davenport, Iowa, is among those
who say they are beginning to get used to it.
   ``It was unbearable at first,'' he said. After arriving, Wagner
said he worked 40 hours and nearly passed out. ``I don't normally
sweat, but I was getting dizzy,'' he said.
   Military hospitals and medics are treating dozens of people a
day for heat-related ailments, mostly minor cases of dehydration.
   Some troops are out in the desert during the day, training under
the hottest sun to get acclimated.
   Others are taking some steps to ease the load on the weary
troops.
   At the 82nd Airborne camp, physical exercises _ primarily walks
and jogging _ are done in the early morning and late afternoon.
   ``We found that water consumption went way down when we started
doing it that way,'' said Maj. Baxter Ennis, the division's public
affairs officer. ``We've learned to adjust, to get the guys used to
the climate but then to try to do most of the other work at times
other than the middle of the day.'
   They may be split over their tolerance to the heat, but troops
visited this past week were unanimous in saying there was a need
for more recreational activities.
   ``We train and sit, train and sit,'' said one Army lieutenant on
condition of anonymity. ``How can you not be bored?''
   At the 82nd Airborne Division's camp, the volleyball game is a
big hit _ some of these paratroopers have been here for three
weeks, with little or no contact from home and instructions not to
venture into Saudi cities
   The 82nd, among the first units into Saudi Arabia, is also
leading the effort to improve recreation activities for the troops.
   In addition to volleyball, touch football games are now a staple
at the 82nd's camp. Some of the later arrivals even have shorts and
running shoes.
   ``The guys who packed up on a minute's notice have to tough it
out in boots,'' said Ennis.
   He commandeered a box of books for the unit and was in town
Wednesday seeking to bargain with the U.S. consulate for a major
prize _ a movie projector.
   ``We've got one on the way from Fort Bragg,'' Ennis said. ``But
the guys could use one now.''

   Multinational forces in Saudi
Arabia have ironed out a relationship allowing troops to stay under
their national command while conducting joint training exercises.
   The system seems to be working, but Saudis and Americans are
deliberately vague about who would take charge if hostilities break
out with Iraqi forces.
   Lt. Gen. Khalid Bin Sultan, head of the joint Arab Islamic Task
Force, refused to answer questions about plans for combat, saying
he didn't want to tip his hand to the enemy.
   ``The standard answer is that all command relationships are
still being worked out,'' said Lt. Col. John Olsen, a spokesman at
the U.S. Central Command headquarters in Saudi Arabia.
   The consensus is the United States, with the largest military
force in the country and its array of weaponry, would call many of
the shots in a combat situation, consulting with the Saudis because
of their sovereignty.
   The Saudis' total military force, with a predominance in the Air
Force, numbers about 65,000.
   ``We are not going to do anything unilaterally,'' said one
American official on condition of anonymity. ``If we do anything in
that area it will be by agreement with the Saudis.''
   Any decision to attack Kuwait or Iraq would need approval at the
highest levels, meaning King Fahd and President Bush, officials
from both nations said.
   Meanwhile, officials are trying to coodinate the air, land and
naval operations in which at least 22 nations say they are involved
or will join.
   The difficulty in bridging language, cultural and political gaps
has caused some frustration among the military officials, said Air
Force Lt. Gen. Charles Horner, the first on-site American commander
and now the No. 2 man.
   Learning to be patient and adapt to the Saudi style of doing
business was difficult when ``you're charging and trying to get the
job done,'' he said.
   The air defense system, based at a huge air base here, is
running smoothly after some initial kinks, officials said.
   ``Communications were under some pressure'' at first, said
British Defense Secretary Tom King.
   The Saudis, the Americans and the British keep their planes near
each other, but separate.
   Saudi pilots fly both American-built F-15s and British-built
Tornados. The British have dispatched their own squadron while the
Americans have a tactical wing here.
   ``Everything is done jointly,'' said Prince Turki Bin Nasser,
head of the air base.
   The operations are meshed on a day-to-day basis, with each
service responsible for a geographic area, officials said. The
coordination is easy because the Saudi pilots have either trained
in the United States or in Britain.
   American military officials have said the U.S. forces are under
strict orders to avoid initiating combat in response to actions by
Iraq that fall short of actual combat or a clear-cut invasion of
Saudi Arabia.
   On the ground, the Saudis have put about 2,000 men in front-line
positions a short distance from its borders with Iraq and Kuwait,
so that they _ not Americans _ would take the first hits if a
ground war erupted.
   ``The Saudis felt they had to be at the front,'' one American
said.
   The Saudis are directing a combined Gulf Cooperation Council
force in the northeastern part of the country near the Kuwait-Saudi
border.
   The gulf nations' force _ from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman,
United Arab Emirates and Qatar _ numbered 10,000 before Iraq's Aug.
2 of Kuwait, and will be increased, officials said.
   Some 2,000 Egyptians, 1,200 Moroccans and 1,000 Syrians also are
on the ground. But they are removed from the front line and do not
intermingle.
   In the Persian Gulf, warships remain independent and under their
own flag. They try to avoid conflicts with each other by notifying
one another about actions.

   A giant Air Force cargo jet loaded
with supplies for U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf crashed and
burned shortly after takeoff today. Officials said 13 people on
board were killed.
   Air Force spokesman Doug Moore said the Lockheed C-5A had 17
military personnel aboard, most of them reservists who had
volunteered for the round-the-clock deployment aimed at
discouraging further Iraqi aggression.
   The plane, which can lift about a quarter million pounds,
crashed in a field a quarter mile from the Ramstein Air Base runway
at 12:30 a.m., said Capt. Ed Worley, another Air Force spokesman.
   He said the jet was headed for Frankfurt's Rhein-Main base,
about 90 miles to the northeast, and then on to the Persian Gulf.
   The aircraft cut a deep swath for about half a mile, broke apart
and burned. Twisted chunks of wings, landing gear, fuselage and
other debris were scattered over a wide area.
   Firefighters were still dousing the smoldering sections of
wreckage 12 hours after the crash.
   Late today, the Air Force released the names of those who were
aboard the plane. No hometowns were listed.
   Nine of the 13 dead were from the 433rd Military Aircraft Wing
at Kelly Air Force Base in Texas. The four others were stationed at
Ramstein or at nearby Hahn Air Base.
   Listed as dead from the 433rd were Maj. John M. Gordon, pilot;
Maj. Richard W. Chase, pilot; Sgt. Rosendo Herrera, flight
engineer; Sgt. Carpio Villarreal, flight engineer; Sgt. Daniel G.
Perez, loadmaster; Sgt. Edward E. Sheffield, loadmaster; Maj.
Richard M. Price, first pilot; Sgt. Lonty A. Knutson, crew chief;
and Sgt. Daniel Garza, crew chief.
   Also killed were Capt. Bradley Schuldt and Sgt. Rande Hulec of
Ramstein and Sgts. Samuel Gardner and Marc Cleyman of Hahn.
   Listed as injured were Lt. Col. Frederick Arzt and Sgt. Dwight
Pettit, both of McChord Air Base in Washington state; Capt. Cynthia
Borecky of England Air Base, Louisiana, and Sgt. Lorenzo Galvan Jr.
of the 433rd.
   Cathy Cox, an Air Force spokeswoman, said the injured were in
stable condition at the U.S. Army's nearby Landstuhl hospital.
   No civilian casualties were reported.
   Col. Brian R. Fullerton, an Air Force spokesman, said the plane
was carrying no hazardous cargo.
   The plane's cargo included food, medical supplies and aircraft
maintenance equipment, according to Moore. The cause of the crash
was under investigation.
   Ramstein, the largest U.S. Air Force base in Europe, has been a
stopover point for the steady stream of U.S. planes headed to and
from the Middle East.
   Worley said the C-5A belonged to the 60th Airlift Wing at Travis
Air Force Base in California. He said it was flown by a crew from
Kelly Air Force Base in Texas.
   The 433rd had not been called to active duty, but some
reservists with the wing were voluntarily participating in
Operation Desert Shield after arranging time off from their
civilian jobs.
   The C-5A and C-5B are the largest transport planes in the Air
Force fleet and each costs about $148 million.
   Under Desert Shield, begun after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait, the United States and other Western and Arab countries have
sent troops, equipment and warships to the gulf region to protect
Saudi Arabia from Iraq and to pressure Baghdad into withdrawing
from Kuwait.
   The crash today occurred a day after the second anniversary of a
collision during an air show at Ramstein that killed 70 people. On
Aug. 28, 1988, three Italian planes crashed during maneuvers and
flaming wreckage flew into the crowd of spectators.
   The crash of a C-5A on April 4, 1975 in Saigon killed more than
200 people, including more than 100 orphan children being flown to
the United States in the evacuation from South Vietnam.

   Defense lawyers in the racially tinged case of
a Marine facing the first military execution in 29 years argued
Wednesday that sections of the military death penalty are
unconstitutional.
   Murder defendants in military trials don't have the same
protections as civilians in state courts, attorneys for Lance Cpl.
Ronnie Curtis told the U.S. Court of Military Appeals.
   The court appointed lawyers, Lt. Cmdr. John B. Holt and civilian
Robert Morin, also argued that President Reagan abused his
executive privilege in 1984 by signing an order outlining whom the
military may sentence to death.
   ``Congress has not decided. Congress has not delegated this
power to the president,'' Holt told three civilian judges of the
military appeals court.
   Curtis, who is black, contends racial taunts drove him to kill
Lt. James Lotz and Lotz's wife, Joan, at Camp Lejeune, N.C., on
April 13, 1987.
   Curtis, who confessed to a state trooper and to investigators,
was sentenced to death after being convicted in a military trial.
He is being held at Fort Leavenworth, Kan.
   The appeals court allowed television cameras to broadcast the
proceedings live for the first time on the C-Span cable network.
Curtis did not attend the hearing.
   The case is seen by attorneys on both sides as a test of the
military death penalty in murder cases. Among the many intervenors
is the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which said Curtis'
court-martial was tainted by racial bias.
   ``In civilian courts, a lot of issues relating to capital
punishment have been considered for years,'' Ronald Wright of the
Wake Forest University law school said in an interview. ``This is a
chance for the military to ask if its system measures up.''
   Wright filed a friend of the court brief in the case.
   The court is considering the appeal in two stages. A ruling is
expected by late September on the constitutional challenge. If
Curtis loses that, he will be permitted a second appeal that could
consider the composition of the military jury and other racial
issues, lawyers said.
   Curtis, the adopted son of a working-class couple from Wichita,
Kan., could take his case to the U.S. Supreme Court if he loses his
appeals.
   A key element of the appeal is that Curtis was sentenced by a
nine-member court-martial panel, even though all states with death
penalties require 12-member sentencing juries in capital cases.
   Military law requires only five panelists, a provision Morin
said could deprive defendants of ``substantial input and
consideration.''
   The government says the Constitution does not require a
12-person panel, and that defendants can get fair sentences with
fewer members.
   Curtis, then 21, was convicted of fatally stabbing Lotz, a
Scranton, Pa., native who was his section officer, then stabbing
Lotz's wife and sexually abusing her as she lay dying in her home.
   Curtis' lawyers said in appeal papers that Lotz, who was white,
antagonized Curtis by imitating what he believed were black
mannerisms and by calling Curtis ``Bebop'' and ``Shoo-be-do.''
   ``You wanted a dog, you snapped (your) fingers, you called me
names, you wanted a dog, here's your dog right here,'' Curtis said
at the court-martial.
   The military said Lotz did call men by nicknames, but that the
trial record showed that the use of the names was ``not racial and
that the lieutenant was not racist.''
   The court-martial panel of nine enlisted men and officers
included three blacks. The NAACP said the military judge allowed
prosecutors to ``evoke racial bias'' by permitting such evidence as
Mrs. Lotz's blood-soaked underwear, which prosecutors said was
relevant to their case.
   Curtis' lawyers argued Wednesday that Congress never granted
authority for Reagan's 1984 executive order defining who is subject
to capital punishment in the military.
   But the government said Congress gave the president power for
the order by creating a military conduct code in 1950.
   The last military execution was in 1961 when a soldier was
hanged for rape and attempted murder. The military has built a
chamber at Fort Leavenworth designed for lethal injections.

   Riot police wielded batons and fired
tear gas Wednesday to disperse thousands of ethnic Albanians
awaiting a U.S. Congressional delegation to complain about alleged
human rights abuses.
   But a statement by Yugoslavian President Borisav Jovic, issued
after earlier talks with the seven Republican senators, said the
ethnic Albanians in the southern Kosovo province have ``far greater
rights'' than minorities in other European countries.
   In Pristina, riot police dispersed an estimated 10,000 people
who chanted ``Freedom! Freedom!'' and ``U.S.A.! U.S.A.!''
   A Belgrade television station reported 46 people were arrested
and more than 20 were injured, including seven police officers. Two
squad cars and several passenger vehicles were demolished.
   The delegation, headed by U.S. Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas,
arrived under heavy police escort about three hours after the clash
with protesters, some of whom pelted police with rocks and bottles.
   ``The senators will see for themselves what kind of police
repression we live under,'' said Ibrahim Rugova, head of the
500,300-member Democratic Union, the largest ethnic Albanian
political party in the region.
   Rugova and other ethnic Albanian leaders spent nearly seven
hours with the senators, who were accompanied by U.S. Ambassador
Warren Zimmermann.
   Later, the group met with representatives of the rival Serbian
community and the Serbian Orthodox church.
   Earlier Wednesday, the senators met in Belgrade with Jovic and
other senior officials. The national news agency Tanjug quoted
Jovic, an ethnic Serb, as rejecting claims of human rights abuses
in Kosovo.
   Ethnic Albanians have ``far greater rights than are generally
accorded to national minorities'' in other European states, he was
quoted as saying. ``The crux of the problem in Kosovo lies in the
attempt to secede from both Serbia and Yugoslavia.''
   Ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of the 1.9 million
people in Kosovo province, an administrative district of Serbia.
Kosovo has been the scene of tension since Serbian officials began
to restrict the province's self-government last year.
   Several Yugoslav and international human rights organizations,
including Amnesty International and the Vienna-based Helsinki
Watch, this year criticized Serbia for its treatment of Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians.
   The region's sole Albanian-language daily was banned in July,
and several Kosovo independent trade union activists have been
jailed for calling for a general strike for Sept. 3.
   Serbian authorities in Kosovo have said they will keep ethnic
Albanian political parties from taking part in the province's
multiparty elections, expected to be held by the end of the year.
   Accompanying Dole on the trip are Sens. John Warner of Virginia,
Jake Garn of Utah, Don Nickels of Oklahoma, Alfonse D'Amato of New
York, Steven Symms of Idaho and Connie Mack of Florida.
   The senators left late Wednesday for Zagreb. They are scheduled
to visit Bulgaria and the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Army, Florida Sign `Bellwether' Agreement to Find Civilian Jobs
For Soldiers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JACKIE HALLIFAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Florida and the Army have
agreed to work together to find civilian jobs for soldiers put out
of work by the end of the Cold War.
   Despite the current deployment of thousands of U.S. soldiers in
the Mideast, the 764,000 active duty forces will be pared down
during the next few years, and could see annual cuts of 35,000,
according to Michael Stone, secretary of the Army.
   ``It is what becomes of those 35,000 soldiers per year that
we're talking about today,'' Stone told Gov. Bob Martinez and the
Cabinet on Tuesday.
   The project involves finding soldiers jobs as teachers,
truckers, health care workers and law enforcement officers. The
state plans to send out brochures and offer a hotline number
promoting job counseling services for out-of-work soldiers.
   ``Florida will become the first state in our country to
implement programs that will help ... military personnel with
education, training and job placement services,'' Education
Commissioner Betty Castor said.
   Although Stone said it was not inappropriate to make plans for
the future of the Army with the unfolding Persian Gulf crisis, he
said personnel cutbacks would be put on hold until the
confrontation is resolved.
   But he thanked the state for its ``willingness to be out front
in such an important project.''
   The Army has not yet worked out similar agreements with other
states because it had concentrated on negotiating a ``bellwether''
agreement with Florida, Stone said.
   ``Florida stood up and said `Yes, we'll work with you in the
Army,''' he said.
   Tom Heath, vice president for ComCar Services, an
Auburndale-based trucking company, has recruited veterans on his
own and will also participate in the project.
   ``The more of these people we get, the better off we're all
going to be,'' he said.
   Stone said soldiers have many appealing qualities for
prospective employers.
   Ninety-five percent of the Army's soldiers have high school
diplomas and many have college education going up through graduate
work, according to Stone. Teaching was the first field Stone said
would be a good match, particularly taking into account the need
for minority educators. More than 28 percent of the Army is black,
including 11 percent of the officers, according to Stone.
   Stone also cited law enforcement and industrial fields that
require expertise in maintenance, electronics and transportation as
areas that will find good employees in the pool of former soldiers.
   Although the agreement was officially signed Tuesday, publicity
the project has received during the past several weeks has
generated about 200 phone calls and letters from service personnel.
   Two recently retired captains, one from the Army and one from
the Navy, have been hired as teachers by school districts.

   The five young people who were slain
here this week were remembered by peers and professors alike as
bright, dedicated students who excelled in school.
   The four women were attractive, brunette, and petite. The lone
man was a strapping, 6-foot athlete.
   But aside from the women's physical similarities, which may have
been a factor if authorities' theory of a single killer is correct,
little else linked the victims, who were slain in three different
apartments.
   Tracey Inez Paules, 23, was a prelaw student. Roommate Manuel
Ricardo Taboada, 23, was a natural athlete and aspiring architect.
Christa Hoyt was a biochemistry major by day and a sheriff's
records clerk by night. Christina Powell studied architecture, and
her roommate Sonja Larson was a church volunteer who wanted to
teach.
   The latest victims, found Tuesday, were Miami high school pals
Paules, a University of Florida senior, and Taboada, a Santa Fe
Community College student who planned to transfer to a university.
   Paules was a class president, homecoming queen and cheerleader
in high school and a prelaw senior at the University of Florida.
She was a National Honor Society member and had played soccer and
softball in high school.
   ``They were dream kids,'' said Fred Bertani, principal of their
alma mater, American Senior High School. ``The kind every parent
wanted their kids to be.''
   Taboada, a varsity football player all through high school,
``was a nice boy who helped his family and put himself through
college,'' said American night-school principal Art Stevens.
Taboada and Paules were not romantically involved, friends said.
   ``They're both great kids,'' Stevens said. ``You talk about a
loss, I mean this truly is a loss for anyone who knew them.''
   Hoyt, an 18-year-old sophomore, was an honor student on a full
scholarship at Santa Fe. She had been a student council member and
band member in high school. She was described as security conscious
because of her work at the sheriff's department and membership in a
sheriff's youth group.
   By chance, she was briefly living alone. Ex-roommate Bridgette
Toombs had moved out last week, and Hoyt's cousin had not moved in
yet, Toombs said.
   Stepmother Diana Hoyt described the girl as a warm, loving
person, but ``very timid and afraid to be on her own.'' Harry
Conner, her high school principal in nearby Newberry, said, ``She
was well-liked by everyone. She always wore a smile.''
   Powell, 17, and Larson, 18, came from strong religious
backgrounds. Powell attended an Episcopal high school in
Jacksonville; Larson sang in her Baptist church choir in Deerfield
Beach. Both were attending the university's summer school to enter
fall classes as second-semester freshmen.
   Powell, the youngest of eight children, ``was going to build
housing for low-income people,'' said Ted Pina, a high school coach
for the softball and volleyball player. ``She was excited about
life. She wanted to improve the world.''
   Sunday-school teacher Larson had worked in her church day-care
center for the past three summers and planned to major in
elementary education.
   She had sought a dormitory room on the campus, but the
University of Florida and its fraternities can only house about a
fourth of the 34,000 students. She had been put on a waiting list
and was living in the apartment with Powell. Their bodies were
found there Sunday.

   Freed hostage Brian Keenan had an
emotional reunion Wednesday with his 69-year-old mother, who had
her first drink in 11 years to toast his release.
   Minnie Keenan was driven to Dublin from her home in Belfast to
see her only son, who is resting and undergoing medical tests at
Mater Private Hospital.
   The 39-year-old university lecturer was freed Friday after 4{
years as a hostage in Lebanon.
   Mrs. Keenan laughed and joked with her son, who looked healthier
than in recent days as he sat on his hospital bed surrounded by
cards and flowers from well-wishers.
   After the two-hour reunion, during which she sipped from a glass
of Guinness, Mrs. Keenan was too emotional to speak to reporters.
   ``She enjoyed meeting Brian so much and even had a glass of
alcohol, her first one in 11 years,'' said family friend, Frank
McCallam. ``She has had a ball.''
   Keenan was presented with a cake depicting a bearded man lying
in a hospital bed with two nurses. He appeared on Irish state
television reading the book ``Friendship,'' sales of which will
boost the Friends of John McCarthy fund.
   McCarthy, a British journalist, was kidnapped in Beirut on April
17, 1986 and is still a hostage.
   Keenan told doctors he and McCarthy were held in a small, hot,
mosquito-infested room. He also said he was beaten and poorly fed.
He said he didn't want to leave without McCarthy but was forced to
go by his captors.
   There are 13 Westerners held hostage in Lebanon. The hostage
held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for
The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

   Friends and relatives were in mourning
Wednesday because of the deaths of nine Kelly Air Force Base
reservists in a military plane crash in Germany.
   ``The mood is very solemn, and many people are sad because of
the incident. It really was a shock to a lot of people,'' said Lt.
Mike Franco, spokesman for the 433rd Military Airlift Wing based at
Kelly.
   The nine members of the 433rd were among 13 killed when a C-5
cargo plane crashed Tuesday at Ramstein Air Base in West Germany.
The huge plane was carrying food, medical and aircraft supplies for
the U.S. military buildup in the Middle East.
   One of the four survivors of the crash also was from the 433rd.
   It wasn't immediately known when their bodies would be returned,
officials said.
   ``Everybody's in shock at the wing. It's been quite a blow to
everybody here,'' said Maj. Meade C. Warthen, public affairs chief
for the reserve unit.
   The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron from
Travis Air Force Base in California and was en route to Rhein-Mein
Air Base in West Germany, authorities said.
   The reservists were volunteers who had arranged time off from
their civilian jobs to help in Operation Desert Shield. The airlift
wing, which includes 3,700 members stationed in Texas and Oklahoma,
has not been called to active duty.
   Wing officials invited reporters to Kelly on Tuesday to tour a
C-5 and interview reservists just back from missions to Saudi
Arabia. The reservists described their trips as tiring and
sometimes frightening, but said they were committed to carrying out
the job.
   Several 433rd reservists said they made quick turnarounds in
Saudi Arabia, sometimes only stopping for six hours to unload.
   The 433rd operates a fleet of C-5 aircraft, described by the Air
Force as the free world's largest plane.
   The cause of the crash was under investigation.
   Members of the 433rd among the dead were Maj. John M. Gordon,
pilot; Maj. Richard W. Chase, pilot; Sgt. Rosendo Herrera, flight
engineer; Sgt. Carpio Villarreal, flight engineer; Sgt. Daniel G.
Perez, loadmaster; Sgt. Edward E. Sheffield, loadmaster; Maj.
Richard M. Price, first pilot; Sgt. Lonty A. Knutson, crew chief;
and Sgt. Daniel Garza, crew chief.
   Among the injured was Sgt. Lorenzo Galvan Jr. of the 433rd.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of angry farmers battled police, blocked
roads and railways and let imported livestock run free Wednesday in
a nationwide display of frustration at falling meat prices.
   Tear gas and water cannons were used to break up demonstrations.
   Farmers want government protection against foreign competition,
but officials say they cannot afford to subsidize French livestock
to bolster sagging prices, or block imports.
   The protests signaled a worsening in the 2-month-old movement to
keep out foreign animals, which livestock herders say undercut
domestic prices.
   Clashes between riot police and farmers broke out in Evreux,
Normandy where bout 1,000 farmers hurling stones tried to break
into government buildings, police said. Six officers were injured,
along with three firefighters hurt while trying to douse bonfires
set under effigies of public figures.
   Riot police fired tear gas to break up a crowd of about 400
violent demonstrators in front of government buildings in Rouen,
Normandy. There were no reported injuries.
   Farmers in Normandy earlier intercepted two trucks carrying
Irish sheep and British calves and turned the animals loose in the
streets of Saint-Lo.
   Police used a water cannon to disperse 1,000 farmers
demonstrating at government buildings in Angers, western France.
Police filled the streets with tear gas later when a crowd of 2,000
assembled.
   Farmers threw rocks and police answered with tear gas at
Lons-le-Saunier near Switerland. The farmers had driven tractors
and herded about 400 sheep to the city hall before trying to break
into the building, police said.
   ``Farmers are fed up and have no more patience,'' said Joseph
Daul, president of the national beef-raisers union. ``I fear yet
more violent actions.''
   Daul, speaking at a roadblock on the Bridge of Europe in
Strasbourg, along France's border with Germany, claimed that cheap
meat imports from Eastern Europe will flood the 12-nation European
Community through East Germany once the Germanys unite.
   At Macon in the Burgundy region, farmers threw hay bales on
tracks carrying high-speed trains from Paris. Barriers held up one
train for 30 minutes, rail officials said.
   Farmers parked tractors or built barricades of burning tires and
trash at 55 spots on main roads in the Vendee region of western
France, police reported.
   About 200 farmers blocked the main north-south highway near
Dijon, causing traffic jams more than six miles long in both
directions.
   Other barricades were set up around Ille-et-Villaine,
Meurthe-et-Moselle and Metz-Nancy regions. In some places,
motorists who tried to break through had their tires slashed.
   At La Rochelle, western France, about 200 farmers broke into the
main regional government buildings early Wednesday and occupied
them throughout the morning.
   In the popular Dordogne vacation region, about 30 farmers
intercepted a truck carrying carrying gooseflesh from Bulgaria
ready for processing into pate. They threw the meat products into
the road and burned them.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Wednesday threw out a civil racketeering
lawsuit that claimed Leona Helmsley illegally took millions of
dollars from her ailing real estate tycoon husband.
   The complaint in Manhattan's federal court was filed last
September by a former Helmsley company executive who said Mrs.
Helmsley's actions had reduced the size of his commissions.
   The suit had contended that Mrs. Helmsley, with the help of a
former personal aide, fraudulently transferred to her possession
things like a $16 million apartment building, a corporate jet and
more than $90 million of bearer bonds.
   The scheme was part of an effort to circumvent a prenuptial
agreement between the Helmsleys, the suit claimed. It said the
transfers were accomplished ``by taking advantage of Mr. Helmsley's
declining mental facilities.''
   U.S. District Judge Kenneth Conboy ruled that the lawsuit had no
standing under the civil racketeering law because the plaintiff,
William R. Miller, was an ``indirect secondary victim of these
alleged frauds.''
   Miller was president of a Helmsley real estate subsidiary, Brown
Harris Stevens, until April.
   The suit claimed that Miller lost out on commissions and bonuses
from Brown Harris Stevens because the alleged scheme deprived the
company of profits.
   Miller also said Mrs. Helmsley had charged him with theft and
forced his resignation from the company.
   Calls to attorneys for Mrs. Helmsley and Miller were not
immediately returned.
   Mrs. Helmsley, 70, who is president of Helmsley Hotels, was
convicted in August 1989 of federal tax fraud charges and was
sentenced to four years in prison and fined $7.1 million. She is
free pending her appeal.
   Her 81-year-old husband, Harry, also was charged in the criminal
case but was found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
   The civil lawsuit had named Mrs. Helmsley, several top Helmsley
executives and Helmsley Enterprises and 11 subsidiaries.

   Nine reservists helping in the
U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf were among the 13 people
killed in the crash of U.S. military cargo plane in West Germany,
military authorities said Wednesday.
   The crash early Wednesday of the huge C-5A transport was the
first major accident in the nearly 3-week-old, round-the-clock
deployment of U.S. personnel and equipment to the gulf.
   ``I don't want to speculate on the cause of this mishap,'' said
Brig. Gen. Richard Swope of the 316th Air Division. ``We don't have
any indication as to what the cause of the accident was.''
   Four of the 17 people aboard the cargo plane were injured when
the massive aircraft tumbled into a field early Wednesday after
taking off from Ramstein Air Base, a stopover for many U.S.
military flights bound for the gulf region.
   The plane was bound for Frankfurt carrying medical supplies,
food and aircraft maintenance equipment for U.S. troops sent to
Saudi Arabia following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, U.S.
Air Force officials said.
   Late Wednesday, the Air Force released the names of the victims.
No hometowns were listed.
   Nine of those killed and one of those injured were reservists
with the 433rd Military Airlift Wing from Kelly Air Force Base in
San Antonio. The four others were stationed at Ramstein or at
nearby Hahn Air Base.
   Listed as dead from the 433rd were Maj. John M. Gordon, pilot;
Maj. Richard W. Chase, pilot; Sgt. Rosendo Herrera, flight
engineer; Sgt. Carpio Villarreal, flight engineer; Sgt. Daniel G.
Perez, loadmaster; Sgt. Edward E. Sheffield, loadmaster; Maj.
Richard M. Price, first pilot; Sgt. Lonty A. Knutson, crew chief;
and Sgt. Daniel Garza, crew chief.
   Also killed were Capt. Bradley Schuldt and Sgt. Rande Hulec of
Ramstein and sergeants Samuel Gardner and Marc Cleyman of Hahn.
   Listed as injured were Lt. Col. Frederick Arzt and Sgt. Dwight
Pettit, both of McChord Air Base in Washington state; Capt. Cynthia
Borecky of England Air Base, Louisiana, and Sgt. Lorenzo Galvan Jr.
of the 433rd.
   The four were hospitalized and reported in satisfactory
condition, said Sgt. Rourk Sheehan, spokesman for the Landstuhl
Army hospital nearby.
   The 433rd had not been called to active duty, but some
reservists with the wing were voluntarily participating in
Operation Desert Shield after arranging time off from their
civilian jobs.
   The plane was from the 60th Military Airlift Squadron from
Travis Air Force Base in California and was en route to Rhein-Mein
Air Base near Frankfurt, authorities said.
   It left the Ramstein air base at about 12:30 a.m. and clipped
the tops of trees before crashing and breaking apart.
   Twisted chunks of wings, landing gear, fuselage and other debris
were scattered over a wide area. Firefighters were still dousing
smoldering sections of wreckage 12 hours after the crash.
   The weather was hazy but visibility was about one mile, said
Swope.
   He said the aircraft was just over 20 years old, which he said
is not uncommon for the C-5.
   The accident occurred about six miles from Miesau, where U.S.
military authorities have been removing a cache of chemical weapons
under an agreement with the West German government.
   The West German Defense Ministry said in a statement Wednesday
the crash posed no danger to the operation.
   Ramstein, the largest U.S. Air Force base in Europe, is 90 miles
west of Frankfurt.
   The C-5 is the largest transport plane in the Air Force fleet
and costs about $148 million.
   It was the first crash of a C-5 in 15 years. On April 4, 1975, a
C-5B carrying Vietnamese orphans crashed shortly after takeoff near
Saigon, killing 172 people.
   The crash Wednesday occurred a day after the second anniversary
of a collision during an air show at Ramstein which killed 70
people.

   Parents and students may be ``prematurely
slamming the door on college'' by inaccurately estimating costs and
failing to tap all available sources of financial aid, Sen. Edward
M. Kennedy said Wednesday.
   Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor and Human Resources
Committee, commented on a General Accounting Office report that
said a review of nine studies and a GAO analysis found students in
grades 10 through 12 knew little about federal financial aid.
   Generally, the studies showed parents had little idea of about
college costs. Most parents greatly overestimated costs or offered
unrealistically low estimates, ranging from a low of $2,000 to a
high of $60,000 a year.
   The College Board said total available student aid in 1989-90
amounted to $27.9 billion. After adjusting for inflation, total aid
increased 10 percent over the 1980-81 level.
   In 1980, only 12 percent of all high school sophomores thought
the Pell Grant program was available in their schools and only 8
percent believed Stafford Loans, a government-backed program, were
available.
   Pell grants, the largest aid program, are available to all who
qualify. But a 1988 study by the Council for Advancement and
Support of Education found 49 percent of the high school students
polled incorrectly thought they were ineligible for aid to attend
an expensive private school if their parents could afford a state
school.
   One-third of those polled also incorrectly believed financial
aid is set aside solely for minority students, and almost a quarter
incorrectly believed that students with average grades don't
qualify for financial aid.
   The study found that more than half the high school graduates
who didn't enroll in college cited affordability, finances and the
need to work as reasons.
   A 1983 study by the Pennsylvania Association of Colleges and
Universities, found that 59 percent of ninth graders reported
receiving no information about financial aid from their schools.
   The GAO report also found that high school students
knowledgeable about financial aid were more likely to enroll in
college than students less familiar with such aid.
   ``It seems likely that lack of knowledge and misconceptions
limit students' and parents' understanding of postsecondary
options: At worst, such ignorance may lead to specific decisions
about high school courses that close the doors on some future job
and school possibilities,'' the GAO said.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge And Guerrilla Allies Accept U.N. Proposal For Cambodia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Khmer Rouge and its two non-communist
guerrilla allies said Wednesday they support a United Nations plan
to place Cambodia under U.N. control until a new government can be
elected.
   Vietnam and the government it installed in Cambodia have not
responded to the proposal made Tuesday by the five permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council. Talks on Cambodia resume
Friday in New York between U.S. and Vietnamese diplomats.
   Analysts in Bangkok, Thailand, say the Cambodian government
wants to retain interim power and limit the U.N. role to organizing
elections.
   On Tuesday, the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council _ the United States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and
France _ announced a proposal calling for a cease-fire in Cambodia
and for the United Nations then to ``supervise and control ... if
necessary'' five key Cambodian ministries: defense, foreign
affairs, finance, public security and information.
   It would be an unprecedented U.N. operation to solve a regional
conflict, costing the United Nations up to $5 billion over one or
two years and involving as many as 10,000 peacekeeping troops and
10,000 civilian personnel, a U.S. diplomat said.
   ``We have gone as far as we can as the five permanent members,''
said a U.S. diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``The
question is, can the four Cambodian factions agree?''
   He referred to the Chinese-backed Khmer Rouge, its two
U.S.-supported non-communist guerrilla allies, and the government
in Cambodia that gets funding from Moscow.
   ``It really comes down to how much influence the (Security
Council) members can have on the factions,'' Suvit Yodmani, a
spokesman for Thai Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, said in
Bangkok Wednesday. The Thai leader has been active in recent
mediation efforts.
   The Cambodian factions are to meet in Jakarta, Indonesia next
month.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said that he
hopes ``the Cambodian parties will accept this framework so that we
can move forward to a restoration of peace in Cambodia.''
   The Cambodian resistance groups announced their acceptance of
the proposal in a statement released at the United Nations.
   ``All the parties of the Cambodian National Resistance,
including the Democratic Kampuchea Party (Khmer Rouge), have
repeatedly expressed their full support for the works of the Five
Permanent Members of the United Nations Security Council and viewed
that the documents successively adopted by them should constitute
the framework of a comprehensive political settlement of the
Cambodian conflict,'' it said.
   ``The fundamental stumbling block which has undermined a
political settlement of the Cambodian problem is ... Vietnam's
duplicity on the role of the United Nations,'' said the statement.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 to oust the Khmer
Rouge, blamed for the deaths of up to 1 million Cambodians by
executions and starvation after they took power in 1975.

<TEXT>
   The FBI soon will field-test kits that enable
police officers to wipe your palm and determine within minutes
whether you've been handling drugs or explosives recently.
   ``It's a much less intrusive method of testing for drug use than
the traditional urine test,'' and does not require hours or days of
work by laboratory technicians, said Dr. Dean Fetterolf of the
FBI's forensic science research unit in Quantico, Va.
   Fetterolf described the new test gear for drugs and explosives
for a news conference at a meeting of the American Chemical Society.
   The new test uses antibodies, produced in laboratory animals, to
detect the presence of micrograms _ millionths of a gram _ of the
target substance on skin, desk tops or other surfaces. The
antibodies trigger a color change in an indicator chemical if the
target is present.
   The tests are calibrated so that they will not pick up the tiny
but detectible amounts of cocaine on virtually all the $20 and $50
bills in circulation, Fetterolf said.
   Antibodies are specific to the triggering substance and the test
should not be triggered by other chemicals, he said.
   Such ``false positives'' are a bane of many current tests. Some
urine tests, for example, indicate drug use if the subject has
eaten a lot of sesame seeds.
   The first drug test kits, 200 for cocaine and 200 for heroin,
should be delivered next month for FBI field tests, and future kits
might also be used for amphetamines and phenylcylidine, PCP, he
said.
   The drug kits are being developed under a $50,000 contract by
Bio-Metric Systems, Inc. of Eden Prairie, Minn. A similar kit for
certain explosives is being developed for $35,000 by Westinghouse
Corp. of Baltimore.
   ``Taking laboratory technology from a three-hour analysis with a
trained technician down to a 30-second analysis that can be done by
someone who's not trained as an expert in chemistry or science is
not a trivial task,'' Fetterolf said.
   A sample test kit displayed by Fetterolf and other FBI agents
consisted of three tiny tubes of liquids and a
smaller-than-a-matchbook plastic container.
   Dr. Patrick Guire, Bio-Metric's vice president for research and
development, said the company is ahead of schedule and may even
ship the kits early.
   Guire said the kits will be mass produced and sold either by
Hycor Biomedical of Garden Grove, Calif., with which his company
has a licensing agreement for other antibody tests, or by
Bio-Metric itself.
   Fetterolf predicted each one would cost $7 to $8, but Guire said
he expected the cost to be about $5 once mass production begins.
   The FBI soon will receive a prototype of the antibody test kit
for explosives, Fetterolf said.
   ``It's very well documented in the scientific literature that
... someone (who) handles explosives and then picks up a briefcase,
will transfer the explosives from the outside of their hand to the
briefcase,'' he said.
   The kits can detect TNT in traces as small as one part per
billion, and in the last few weeks, an antibody has been developed
for PETN, a major component of plastic explosives, for as little as
30 parts per trillion, he said.

<HEAD>`Shocking' Lead Exposure in California Workers Reflects `National
Scandal'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On-the-job lead poisoning is rampant in
California, two state-run studies reveal. A medical journal
editorial called the findings shocking and said they reflect a
national scandal.
   A third study, yet unpublished, estimated at least 2,500
California children under age 17 have potentially toxic levels of
lead in their blood because they live near factories that use lead
or in homes with lead-based paint.
   The research by California's Department of Health Services shows
that ``you literally have thousands of people exposed to an agent
that's been known to be toxic for centuries,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Kizer, the department's director and co-author of two of the
studies.
   ``We can now verify there are substantial numbers of people who
are being poisoned,'' Kizer said during a phone interview from
Sacramento.
   Lead, a toxic metal, is widely used in battery manufacturing
plants, brass foundries, construction, radiator repair shops, gun
firing ranges and pottery and ceramics plants.
   Lead poisoning can cause anemia, high blood pressure, stomach
upset, constipation, headaches, infertility, miscarriages, possible
nervous system and brain damage, joint pain, kidney damage,
convulsions and coma.
   The two studies of adult workers were published in the August
issue of the American Journal of Public Health.
   They demonstrate ``there's an epidemic of occupational lead
poisoning in California,'' said Neil Maizlish, chief author of one
of the studies and a state epidemiologist in Berkeley.
   ``These data, combined with (earlier research) data from Texas,
New York and New Jersey collectively show there is an epidemic of
occupational lead poisoning in the United States.''
   The editorial accompaning the studies said: ``The continuing
overexposure of American workers to lead and the persistent
occurrence of occupational lead poisoning is a national scandal.''
   The editorial's author, Dr. Philip Landrigan of New York's Mount
Sinai Medical Center, described the studies' results as shocking
and said on-the-job lead poisoning ``is entirely preventable.''
   Jerome Smith, executive director of the Lead Industries
Association in New York, said he hadn't seen the studies and
couldn't comment. But he suggested California officials overstated
the problem by considering lead a health threat at levels lower
than the government standard.
   Landrigan called the standard too weak.
   The studies blamed California's on-the-job lead-poisoning
problem on employers' ignorance of lead exposure laws, company
doctors' ignorance of how to recognize and treat lead poisoning,
and weak enforcement by overburdened state and federal occupational
health agencies.
   The first study found that, as of 1987, only 2.6 percent of
California's lead-using industries conducted legally required tests
of airborne lead in the workplace, while only 1.4 percent regularly
tested lead levels in workers' blood.
   The second study and more recent state-collected data revealed
that by the end of July, even the relatively small number of tests
that were conducted showed at least 5,000 California workers have
elevated, potentially toxic blood lead levels. One-sixth of those
workers had levels that can produce lead-poisoning symptoms,
Maizlish said.
   The two studies show ``there is a significant lead poisoning
problem out there, and that many if not most of the cases are going
undetected,'' said industrial hygienist Jeffrey Jones, a study
co-author.
   Based on the studies, Maizlish said his department estimates
205,000 of the 230,000 Californians exposed to lead at work are
employed by companies where airborne lead levels aren't tested.
   ``The bulk of the problem is in the mom-and-pop operations,''
Kizer said.
   The studies of on-the-job lead exposure stemmed from a state law
officials hoped would detect lead poisoning in children. It took
effect in 1987, and required medical laboratories to report to
Kizer's agency the results of blood tests that found elevated lead
levels in anyone tested.
   Ninety-five percent of the early reports covered adult workers,
indicating doctors tested few children for lead exposure.
   So the department conducted the third study by testing blood
lead levels in children in Oakland, Sacramento, Wilmington and
Compton neighborhoods that had homes with lead paint or were
located near lead-using industries. Based on the findings, the
researchers estimated at least 2,500 California children have
potentially toxic blood lead levels.
   The other studies found 81 percent of the employees with
elevated blood lead levels worked in Los Angeles County _ the
state's manufacturing center _ and 44 percent were Hispanic, even
though Hispanics make up only 24 percent of California's population.
   ``Whoever is at the bottom at the socioeconomic ladder tends to
do this kind of work,'' Jones explained.

   Rikers Island inmates on Wednesday detailed a
night of horror in which they said guards lined them up in a prison
corridor and battered them with nightsticks, splashing blood all
over the hallway.
   ``I got hit with a nightstick so hard they nearly tore my finger
off,'' said Ronald King, 30, showing his bandaged right hand to
reporters touring the jail for the first time since the Aug. 14
riot.
   A state watchdog panel in Albany backed up the prisoners
Wednesday, ruling the officers used excessive force in the uprising.
   ``Correction officers used force that was far in excess of what
was reasonable and necessary to establish control of inmates and
defend themselves,'' said William McMahon, chairman of the state
Commission on Correction, which oversees all local jails in the
state.
   ``The numbers of officers and inmates injured, and the nature of
their injuries, are grossly disproportionate,'' he said.
   McMahon said 144 inmates were injured, including two or three
requiring neurosurgery and others with defensive injuries like
broken arms and rear skull damage.
   Eighteen guards also were injured.
   Correction officials also said Wednesday that a shakeup in
command followed the episode. A new warden and deputy warden were
brought in last week at Rikers Island's Otis Bantum Correctional
Center, where the confrontation occurred.
   Correction officers claimed they struck the inmates in
self-defense after the riot, but the inmates _ shouting through
glass partitions to reporters _ told a different story.
   Charges that inmates destroyed property were trumped up to
explain the injuries the prisoners suffered, members of the inmate
council said.
   Inmates handed reporters copies of their infraction notices from
that night _ forms filled out by officers detailing alleged inmate
wrongdoing. An inmate charged with smashing windows was subdued
with ``batons, body holds, punches ... all parts of body,'' one
form said.
   King said on the night of Aug. 14, he was standing with his
hands on his head when a guard smashed him with the stick. The
inmates had been forced from their beds on an upper floor that
night by tear gas and the officers, he said.
   ``I saw the aftermath _ the stitches, the black eyes. There was
blood everywhere, through the whole bottom corridor,'' said William
Whitaker, a member of the inmates council.
   The council chairman, Victor Lantey, said there was ``a massive
amount of blood in the corridors.'' Four members of the council met
the reporters in the jail chapel.
   ``It was horrible, horrific, brutal,'' said Lantey, 50, who has
been at Rikers for 11 months. ``I saw heads busted, eyes swollen
up, ribs broken. It was excessive.''
   The hallway was clean Wednesday and freshly painted.
   Whitaker, 35, said the first indication the inmates had of an
impending assault was when guards began moving through the cells
taking blankets and coats from them _ things they could use to
absorb any blows.
   The incident followed a settlement between the officers' union
and the city that ended a two-day blockade of the bridge leading to
the jail. A report of a riot came in as the deal was made public,
and guards quickly poured across the bridge and onto the island.
   Inmates, however, said they were only barricading themselves in
because they anticipated violence after correction officers union
head Phil Seelig announced a rule had been eliminated that
restricted the circumstances under which a guard could use force.
   City officials later said the rule was simplified, not
eliminated.
   Corrections Commissioner Allyn Sielaff, who took over the
troubled city jail system in March, said in Albany that he could
not comment on the allegations of brutality because the riot is
under investigation by the city Department of Investigation.
   ``There's an independent, objective investigation going on,
which I'm thankful for,'' said Sielaff. ``I'm not privy to the
details of that investigation.''
   McMahon said Sielaff's ignorance about the incident disturbed
him.
   ``I'm very surprised,'' McMahon said after talking with Sielaff.
``I can see where he's coming from ... but he's facing some serious
problems that he should be looking at. He can't just sit back.''

   A lawyer sued the National Endowment for the
Arts on Wednesday, alleging that its $15,000 grant for an artist's
controversial exhibition displayed ``open and notorious hostility
toward religion'' and violated the Constitution.
   The lawsuit was filed against the NEA and its chairman, John E.
Frohnmayer, in U.S. District Court by the Rutherford Institute, a
non-profit legal services organization, on behalf of David Fordyce.
   Fordyce, a lawyer, was described as a ``devout Christian'' from
Los Angeles.
   The suit cited the NEA's grant last year for ``Tongues of
Flame,'' an exhibit of works by David Wojnarowicz of New York that
was organized by University Galleries at Illinois State University.
   The Fordyce suit alleged that the NEA-supported catalog for the
Wojnarowicz show includes an image depicting Jesus Christ as an
intravenous drug user. It said the catalogue also refers to Roman
Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York as a ``fat cannibal''
and ``the world's most active liar about condoms and safer sex.''
   Fordyce said NEA support for the catalog conveys ``a message of
hate and animosity toward institutionalized religion'' sponsored by
the federal government in violation of the First Amendment's
provision for separation of church and state.
   He asked the court for a permanent injunction prohibiting the
arts endowment from ``funding, sponsoring and endorsing works which
promote blasphemous and sacrilegious hate material.''
   The endowment, an independent, $171 million federal agency that
underwrites a wide variety of artists and arts organizations, had
no immediate comment on the lawsuit.
   The NEA is embroiled in a controversy over art, obscenity and
freedom of expression stemming from allegations by religious
fundamentalists and conservative lawmakers led by Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., that it has subsidized obscene and sacrilegious works.
   The endowment already is the target of two other federal
lawsuits in New York and Los Angeles challenging Frohnmayer's
requirement that grant recipients sign a pledge of compliance with
a congressional ban on using federal funds for works that may be
deemed obscene.
   In a telephone interview from New York, Wojnarowicz lamented the
NEA's ``awful track record'' in supporting works by minority
artists, including homosexuals and lesbians.
   ``If this kind of heat comes from cult or extreme conservative
religious groups over the few coins that finance minority
expression, then this country is in pretty bad shape,'' he said.
   Barry Blinderman, the Illinois gallery director, accused the
lawsuit's sponsors of ``hypocrisy'' and angrily defended
Wojnarowicz's work against charges of sacrilege.
   ``Before these people condemn the NEA, they should remember that
it was the so-called holy men who didn't accept Christ and turned
him in,'' Blinderman said. ``Jesus said `judge not,' and I
recommend that these people follow the precepts of the God they are
proclaiming.''
   The ``Tongues of Flame'' exhibit opened at Blinderman's gallery
earlier this year and is now appearing at the Santa Monica Museum
of Art in California.
   John W. Whitehead, founder and president of the Rutherford
Institute, told a news conference here that the NEA had
``unconstitutionally used taxpayers' funds to engage in actions
which are hostile toward religion and religious persons.''
   ``The government should not become the patron of hate art
against some of its citizens,'' Whitehead said. ``Religious people
must no longer be the personal targets of cannon fire from National
Endowment projects.''
   Wojnarowicz previously had filed a federal lawsuit in New York
against the Rev. Donald Wildmon and his conservative American
Family Association.
   In late June, a New York federal judge ruled that Wildmon's
group probably had misrepresented Wojnarowicz's works by including
fragments of them in a pamphlet titled ``Your Tax Dollars Helped
Pay for These `Works of Art'.''
   The judge said the pamphlets, which were mailed to members of
Congress, religious leaders and media outlets, probably had damaged
the artist's reputation and the value of his works. He issued an
injunction forbidding further publication of the pamphlet.

   The former mayor of Anchorage and a Republican state senator
turned their attention to their general election battle for
governor Wednesday after a primary election in which voters folded
an effort to legalize casino gambling.
   In Oklahoma's gubernatorial primary, voters Tuesday narrowed
crowded fields in both parties but failed to give any candidate a
majority, setting up two Sept. 18 runoffs.
   And in Cripple Creek, Colo., voters threw three City Council
members out of office in a dispute over a state ballot initiative
to bring low-stakes gambling to three depressed former mining towns
on the slopes of Pike's Peak. The recalled council members, Mike
Altman, Roy Carico and June Sylvain, said voters were angry because
they oppose the proposal to allow slot machines, poker and
blackjack.
   Alaska state Sen. Arliss Sturgulewski, who almost became the
state's first woman governor four years ago, brimmed with
post-primary enthusiasm after winning the GOP nomination.
   ``I feel very, very strong about victory in November,'' said
Sturgulewski, who has represented Anchorage in the state senate for
12 years. ``We have a plan and we're ready to start.''
   Tony Knowles, claiming victory in the Democratic primary, said:
``This is just the first step. I'm going to change my watch from
primary time to general time.''
   In other races, Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska won his
party's nomination for his fourth full term. With 98 percent of the
vote in, he had 70 percent to 30 percent for Bob Bird, a high
school teacher and anti-abortion activist. Stevens faces
businessman Michael Beasley, the Democratic nominee with 57 percent
of his party's vote.
   In Oklahoma's Democratic primary, Sen. David Boren steamrolled
to victory in his bid for a third term with 428,921 votes to 55,561
for his nearest opponent. Boren will face Republican Stephen Jones,
a lawyer who ran unopposed.
   Alaska's casino measure, which would have allowed blackjack and
other forms of gambling, lost 65 percent to 35 percent.
   Supporters had said gambling would generate revenue. Opponents,
including retiring Gov. Steve Cowper, argued gambling would
increase crime, create few jobs, cost too much to regulate and
undermine the state's image as a wholesome wilderness paradise.
   In the Oklahoma governor's race, restaurateur Vince Orza, a
political newcomer, will face former U.S. Attorney Bill Price in
the Sept. 18 runoff for the Republican nomination. With all votes
counted, Orza finished first with 76,046 votes or 40 percent, and
Price was second with 51,421 votes or 27 percent. Three other
candidates divided the rest. Incumbent Republican Gov. Henry
Bellmon decided not to run for another term.
   ``I feel great,'' said Orza. ``My expectations were that we had
a chance to win if we played hard and we played fair.''
   In the five-way Democratic race for governor, Wes Watkins, a
seven-term congressman, and businessman David Walters finished on
top. Watkins had 174,575 votes or 32 percent, Walters had 171,675
votes or 32 percent and House Speaker Steve Lewis finished third
with 159,995 votes or 30 percent.
   In Alaska, with 98 percent of precincts reporting, Knowles had
32,157 votes or 56 percent and Lt. Gov. Stephen McAlpine had 24,943
votes or 43 percent after what pollsters had predicted would be a
tight race turned into a landslide.
   In the GOP race, Sturgulewski had 24,317 votes or 36 percent,
businessman Jim Campbell had 21,387 votes or 32 percent of the vote
and state Sen. Rick Halford had 20,561 votes or 31 percent.
   Complete returns for Alaska weren't expected Wednesday because
vote-counters in some bush precincts were still traveling to
communities with telephones so they could report.

   The massive deployment of U.S. Navy warships
and support vessels to Saudi Arabia has been ``putting a strain''
on the service, a senior Navy official said on Wednesday.
   ``We're strained at the level (where) we are. We'll just have to
operate that way for a while,'' said the official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The official said that the deployments of some major warships _
such as the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower and its battle group _
have had to be extended for a time because of the crisis, but the
Navy leadership is committed to getting its long-absent sailors
back home as soon as possible.
   The Eisenhower and its guardian ships have been at sea since
March, and six-month deployments are about ``what people can
endure'' away from home and family, said the official.
   Four U.S. carriers, each bristling with dozens of warplanes,
have been deployed to Middle East waters in response to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   The Navy also has been moving some 45,000 Marines onto Saudi
soil and aboard amphibious assault ships near the Arabian peninsula.
   Tens of thousands of soldiers have been flown into Saudi Arabia
and the military's fast sea lift ships have gotten the Army's first
heavy tanks in place in recent days to defend the Saudi oil fields.
   But some problems have arisen with meeting deadlines for
transporting cargo with the Ready Reserve Fleet, the official
acknowledged.
   Those ships are mothballed and only put into service in times of
emergency, so some snags and delays were expected to occur, the
official said.
   The Navy's Military Sealift Command provides ships to the other
services for transport purposes.
   There are 96 ships in the Ready Reserve fleet. Of the 41 ships
requested for service, about 27 weren't ready for loading on time,
with delays ranging from one to 20 days, Pentagon officials said.
   Even so, the military has been able to move ``an enormous amount
of cargo'' in a very short time with little warning, the Navy
official said.
   ``We've moved more stuff in three weeks than we did in the first
three months of the Korean War,'' the official said.
   ``You're always going to have problems with sealift, because ...
when you have a conflict like this, you have to use ships that have
been tied up for some time,'' the official said.
   The massive transportation effort has ``played out about like I
expected it to _ it wouldn't all be perfect, but we'd get the cargo
moving _ and it is moving,'' the official said.

<HEAD>Report: Iraq Makes Secret Offer to U.S.</HEAD>

   Iraq has told the White House it would withdraw
from Kuwait and allow foreigners to leave if certain demands were
met, Newsday reported Wednesday.
   In its secret offer, Iraq said it wants United Nations sanctions
lifted, guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf and sole control of
an oil field that dips into Kuwait, Newsday's Washington bureau
reported.
   The newspaper said an unidentified, former high-ranking U.S.
official confirmed that he had delivered Iraq's message to National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft last Thursday.
   In Washington, a White House official confirmed Wednesday that
the message was delivered to Scowcroft but said it was ``basically
a nonstarter.''
   ``Our position has always been that Iraq must withdraw from
Kuwait. Anything that seeks to circumvent the U.N. resolve does not
provide great optimism for movement,'' he said, commenting only on
condition of anonymity.
   White House deputy press secretary Roman Popadiuk refused to
confirm or deny the existence of the message but said ``we're aware
of many initiatives that are being undertaken by various bodies.''
   He said it would be ``self-defeating to start singling out one
proposal or one putative proposal or initiative at the expense of
others.'' He said the main point is that the United Nations has
``spoken as one voice'' in demanding that Iraq pull its troops out
of Kuwait.
   In Baghdad, Iraq's official news agencey said no such proposal
was made.
   Newsday said that the former official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said he was unsure whether the proposal was a serious
offer or ``floating something to see whether you're going to bite
or not.''
   However, Newsday quoted an unidentified administration official
who specializes in Mideast affairs as saying that the proposal was
serious and that the package was ``negotiable.''
   That official said it was significant that Iraq made no mention
in its proposal of a precondition that the United States pull its
troops out of Saudi Arabia.
   The official said earlier Iraqi proposals had contained what he
described as ``impossible demands,'' such as linking a pullout from
Kuwait with an Israeli withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and
Gaza.
   Newsday said an unidentified White House spokesman, when asked
to comment, reaffirmed President George Bush's stated precondition
that Iraq pull out of Kuwait, allow the restoration of its
government and release all hostages before any negotiations begin.

<HEAD>Attacks on Academic Freedom Rise, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Censorship attempts ranging from book bannings
to protests of AIDS education made 1989-90 the worst year on record
for academic freedom in the public schools, an advocacy group said
Wednesday.
   People for the American Way, a liberal organization that focuses
on constitutional liberty issues, said it documented 244 attacks on
freedom to learn _ up from 172 incidents it cited in 1988-89.
   This year's total was the highest since the group began its
annual survey in 1982, but it probably represents only a fraction
of all the incidents that occurred, the report said.
   ``The censorship movement in America is flourishing,'' said
Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way.
   ``From novels to television programs to fine art to music to
movies to textbooks, we are witnessing an explosion of censorship,
an explosion sparked by the match of far right and religious right
intolerance,'' Kropp said.
   But the report also said only about one-third of the censorship
attempts succeeded this year, while the others were rejected by
principals, school boards or other officials.
   In 1988-89, about 50 percent of the attempts succeeded.
   Thirty-nine states had at least one documented incident, but 114
of the incidents _ 46 percent _ occurred in the West.
   California led with 70. Oregon was second with 16, followed by
Washington and New York with 14 each, Michigan with 13 and Florida
and Texas with 12 each.
   The report attributed California's total to activities by
right-wing religious groups waging a campaign to change
state-approved curricula and reading lists.
   Those groups have focused on Impressions, a reading series for
kindergarten through sixth grade published by a subsidiary of
Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.
   The series features stories, poems and literary excerpts,
including writings by Martin Luther King Jr., C.S. Lewis and Laura
Ingalls Wilder. There also are fantasy stories, some dealing with
witches and goblins.
   Educators have praised Impressions, but critics say the books
promote Satanism, witchcraft and rebellion against parents and
other authority figures, Kropp said. Others describe the material
as violent and depressing.
   Many of the California incidents in the People for the American
Way report involve Impressions. The series was removed from
classrooms in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. An attempt to ban the books in
Redondo Beach, Calif., failed. A court battle is under way in
Dixon, Calif.
   The Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, chairman of Traditional Values
Coalition of Anaheim, Calif., which opposes the series, said it
contains some good literature. But some of the writings promote a
``New Age'' religion, he said.
   ``It has stories and characters that demean and denigrate
traditional values and beliefs,'' Sheldon said.
   Harcourt Brace Jovanovich said in a statement: ``We are not
going to be intimidated by self-appointed guardians of local
reading standards.''
   The Impressions series provides ``instructional experiences that
build and strengthen reading ability while allowing students to
experience overall enjoyment and excitement in reading,'' the
company said.
   Meanwhile, efforts continued from Florida to Colorado to require
that textbooks give the biblical account of creation and downplay
evolution, People for the American Way said.
   Book bannings were sought across the nation for use of offensive
words, the report said. Among works critics sought to be removed
from school libraries and classroom reading lists were Mark Twain's
``The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,'' Maya Angelou's ``I Know Why
the Caged Bird Sings,'' and Shakespeare's ``Romeo and Juliet.''
   Sex education and AIDS instruction were attacked in Alabama, New
York and South Carolina, the report said.
   In several Texas communities, students were prohibited from
wearing jewelry, clothing or symbols thought to be associated with
Satanism.

   Motorists in 27 states will face sobriety
checkpoints during the Labor Day weekend, a private group said
Wednesday after it surveyed authorities nationwide.
   The setting up of roadside checkpoints follows a Supreme Court
ruling in February that allowed random checks for drunken drivers.
   The American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities, a new
group that supports the idea of checkpoints, said it contacted
public safety officials in every state by telephone. The
organization had written all governors urging a start of the
program this weekend.
   The 20 states without plans for sobriety checks said they would
step up patrols to catch drunken drivers during the weekend, said
Roger Conner, alliance president. Three states _ Hawaii, Iowa and
Nebraska _ failed to respond to the survey, he said.
   Four states _ Louisiana, Michigan, Oregon and Vermont _ have
ongoing litigation or court rulings based on state constitutions
that prohibit checkpoints, Conner said.
   Police checking motorists for drunkenness generally have to
delay a driver for only about 90 seconds, he said.
   The court ruled that the minimal intrusion for law-abiding
motorists is outweighed by the benefit of preventing drunken
driving. Alcohol figured in about half of the 46,000 traffic
fatalities last year.
   Of the 27 states which said they would set up the checkpoints,
24 said the programs are the result of both state and local law
enforcement efforts, the survey said. In three states _
Connecticut, Georgia and North Carolina _ the programs reportedly
were set up only by some local police agencies.
   States planning the checkpoints statewide, according to the
survey, include Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois,
Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine,
Missouri, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, Nevada, New
York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Virginia
and West Virginia.

   California, the main source of U.S.
pistachios, is producing a record crop of the nuts this year, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Production was estimated at 115 million pounds, an in-shell
weight, almost triple last year's harvest and 22 percent more than
the previous record of 94 million pounds in 1988.
   ``The large increase is primarily due to the alternate bearing
cycle of the pistachio crop,'' the report said. ``Bearing acreage
also increased 6 percent from 1989 to 51,500 acres.''
   An alternate bearing cycle means large production one year and a
smaller harvest the next.

<HEAD>Historic Hotel Burns Two Days After Closed By Bankruptcy Trustee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARRE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The historic Hotel Barre was destroyed by a
suspicious fire Wednesday two days after the 101-year-old inn,
recently restored to its Victorian elegance, was ordered closed by
a bankruptcy court.
   ``A business tragedy has become a human tragedy,'' said David M.
Nickless, a Fitchburg lawyer who was appointed trustee for the
property Monday. ``The town has lost something that it had put its
whole heart and soul into. The restoration of the hotel had become
the rebirth of the town.''
   The state fire marshal's office was investigating the blaze and
Nickless said he would ask federal officials to join the inquiry.
Fire Chief Raymond Howard termed the fire suspicious, and said the
building was supposed to have been empty.
   The stately three-story hotel on the town common was engulfed in
flames when firefighters arrived, said Howard.
   More than 100 firefighters from 10 towns battled the blaze,
which lit the night sky for miles in central Massachusetts,
northwest of Worcester.
   By 7 a.m. scores of stunned residents began gathering on the
common to watch as firefighters worked on the smoldering ruin.
   ``This is a horrible loss to Barre,'' said state Rep. Steven
Brewer, a Barre resident. ``The town will never be the same.''
   ``The hotel brought people from all over the world to Barre,''
said Selectman Duk Demetroupoulos.
   Built in 1899 in a style that suggested a Mississippi River
steamboat, the inn had 36 guest rooms, 11 fireplaces and an elegant
dining room decorated with murals. Guests had included presidents
Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Calvin Coolidge.
   It was purchased in 1985 for $265,000 by the Kenneth and Nancy
Lee Wright and Douglas Merrifield, who recreated its lavish
Victorian atmosphere. Before its shutdown, the hotel had 68 full
and part-time workers.
   Wright, who had managed the hotel, declined to comment on the
fire.
   The owners sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy law protection in
February 1989 citing assets of $2 million and liabilities of $1.8
million. On Monday, a federal bankruptcy court judge ordered the
liquidation of the hotel at the request of its largest creditor,
the Worcester County Institution for Savings.
   Nickless said the hotel was covered by an $800,000 insurance
policy.
   It had been listed for sale in 1987 with an asking price of $2.6
million unfurnished, or $3.6 million furnished.

<HEAD>Farm Cash Income Up</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farm income prospects have brightened
significantly despite rising energy costs prompted by the Mideast
crisis, an Agriculture Department report showed Wednesday.
   ``The Iraq situation pushed the price of crude oil up sharply,''
the report said. ``If a price increase of $10 a barrel is
maintained for the remainder of the year, agricultural fuel
expenses in 1990 will be 10 percent higher than in 1989.''
   Earlier, the department's Economic Research Service had forecast
a 5 percent increase in 1990 fuel costs.
   But the report also showed that ``net cash income'' of farmers
this year is expected to be record high, in the range of $59
billion to $63 billion, up about one-tenth from 1989. The previous
high was $57.2 billion in 1988.
   The forecast for net cash income had been in the range of $55
billion to $59 billion in recent months.
   As used by the agency, net cash income ``measures the value of
commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments, less
out-of-pocket costs.'' Some commodities sold actually may have been
produced in earlier years and stored until marketed.
   In another method of accounting, the report said ``net farm
income'' may be in the range of $47 billion to $52 billion,
compared with the previous forecast of $47 billion to $51 billion.
Last year's was about $47 billion, a downward revision of $2
billion from previous 1989 estimates.
   Net farm income is used to measure the value of agricultural
production, whether sold or stored, in a calendar year plus
government payments, minus all costs, including depreciation and
other allowances.
   The report said 1990 cash receipts for crops and livestock are
expected to climb 6 percent to 8 percent from last year. Direct
government payments are down somewhat from 1989, however.
   Cash expenses were forecast to be up 1 percent to 3 percent from
1989. Those include higher costs of fuels, marketing, storage,
transportation and farm rents.
   Overall, the report said, the 1990 balance sheet ``reflects a
strong position for U.S. agriculture'' with rising asset values _
mostly land _ and steady debt.
   The rise in energy prices will have negligible effect this year
on the farm cost of fertilizer and other chemicals ``but will
probably be more pronounced in 1991 because most application is in
the spring.''
   Analysts said the performance of the general economy will be
strongly influenced by how long the Middle East crisis continues
and how high oil prices climb.
   ``Current conditions point to dampening demand, slower growth
and higher inflation, a situation that would be aggravated by
extended oil price hikes,'' the report said.

<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson arrived in Baghdad
Wednesday to interview Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for a
syndicated U.S. television show.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said
Jackson was met at Baghdad's airport by officials from the foreign
ministry. The agency did not give their names.
   On Tuesday, in Amman, Jordan, the civil rights leader and former
Democratic presidential candidate told reporters that he hoped to
help keep adversaries talking in order to avoid war in the Middle
East.
   ``If (leaders) keep talking and keep acting the worst scenario
can be avoided,'' he said. ``It is better when people talk, talk,
talk rather than fight, fight, fight.''
   Jackson has stressed that he would be making the trip as a
journalist to interview Saddam, senior Iraqi officials and American
hostages in Baghdad, and would not be engaged in any diplomatic
negotiations.
   Jackson is scheduled to interview Saddam for the syndicated
television show ``Inside Edition,'' said Allyson Kossow, a
spokeswoman for the show.
   She said on Monday that no date had been set yet for the
broadcast of Jackson's interview with Saddam, whose Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait touched off the Persian Gulf crisis, which has brought
thousands of U.S. soldiers to Saudi Arabia.
   Ms. Kossow said Jackson isn't being paid for the interview, nor
will the interview appear on Jackson's own show, which is
syndicated by Warner Bros. in Los Angeles. ``The Jesse Jackson
Show'' is scheduled to premiere next month.
   ``Inside Edition,'' which is syndicated by competing King World
   Productions, is paying for the travel and production expenses of
Jackson's group, and ``we retain complete editorial control'' of
interviews, Ms. Kossow said.
   Jackson, an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988, traveled to Syria in 1984
to arrange the release of a U.S. Navy pilot held there.

   The aircraft carrier used to train the Navy's
sailors and pilots _ the USS Lexington _ will be decomissioned in
mid-1991, the Navy announced Wednesday.
   The USS Forrestal, which is homeported in Mayport, Fla., has
been named to replace the Lexington as the service's training
carrier.
   The Lexington was the site of a major accident last fall, when a
jet pilot making his first landing crashed into the deck, killing
himself and four others.
   In a statement issued at the Pentagon, the Navy said it had
opted to retire the 47-year-old carrier rather than perform an
overhaul to extend its service life.
   Since 1962, the Lexington has been used to qualify thousands of
naval aviators, and it has recorded more than 490,000 aircraft
landings on its flight deck.
   The Lexington was launched in 1942. During World War II, its
crew destroyed more than 1,000 enemy planes and sank 300,000 tons
of shipping, earning it the nickname ``The Blue Ghost'' and the
reputation that it couldn't be sunk.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A series of murders near the campus of a
Florida university shows Americans have been too slow to recognize
a plague of violence against women, Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. said
Wednesday.
   ``It should not take such a grizzly and horrifying incident for
us to act,'' said Biden, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee. ``We already know that young women are
disproportionately victimized by violent crime.''
   He said the five slayings discovered in recent days near the
University of Florida in Gainesville ``dramatize just how
vulnerable America's young women are as they return to campus.''
Four of the Florida victims were women.
   The comments came at the start of a Judiciary Committee hearing
at which two women pleaded for congressional action to combat what
they said was a spreading problem of ``acquaintance rape.''
   Philadelphia paralegal Christine Shunk, 25, told the committee
that she was raped twice, the first time when she was a college
freshman and being escorted home from a fraternity party by a man
she believed to be a friend. Two years later she was raped at
knifepoint by a stranger.
   ``I have already been raped twice and I have survived,'' she
said. ``I do not know how I would survive a third assault mentally.
You see, being raped is like having your whole world turned upside
down.''
   The committee released results of a study done on behalf of the
American Psychological Association that said the chances of any
woman being raped in her lifetime were one in five. It said the
odds of being raped by an acquaintance were one in six.
   ``We are here to debunk the myth that real rape only happens
when a man jumps out of the bushes and attacks an unsuspecting
victim,'' said Biden, D-Del. ``In fact, rape by someone the victim
knows _ usually referred to as acquaintance rape _ is real rape and
it is far more common and may be even more devastating to its
survivors.''
   Biden said support is growing for legislation that would direct
more federal resources to combatting violence against women.
   Ms. Shunk, of Coatesville, Pa., said she was plagued by guilt
after the first attack because she had agreed to accompany the
young man to his dorm room to pick up his jacket before he took her
home.
   In the first case, Ms. Shunk said, she didn't realize at first
that she'd been raped. A counselor she consulted didn't ask the
name of her assailant but merely advised her to keep her grades up
so that she could transfer to another school.
   Nicole Snow, 21, of New Canaan, Conn., told the committee that
the summer before her junior year in high school she was raped by a
boyfriend she at first ``thought was my dream.''
   ``I thought he was a popular, caring, wonderful football player
and he seemed crazy about me,'' she said. ``My dream was quickly
shattered. A month after our first date ... he changed my life
forever by brutally raping me.''
   She said that afterward she pretended it hadn't happened.
   ``I continued my life robotically, striving socially,
academically and athletically _ but inside there was a crying young
girl,'' she said. ``It took three and a half years until I got the
courage to seek therapy.''

<HEAD>Court Ordered to Review IRA Bombing Convictions; Evidence in Doubt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Wednesday ordered an appeals
court to reopen the cases of six Irishmen convicted of murdering 21
people in a pair of IRA pub bombings in 1974, saying police may
have tampered with evidence.
   Though doubts were raised only about evidence against one
defendant, Home Secretary David Waddington ordered the Court of
Appeal to review all six cases.
   ``It is good news, but I'm keeping my feet firmly on the
ground,'' said Hugh Callaghan, one of the so-called Birmingham Six,
who have maintained their innocence for 16 years.
   Their convictions were affirmed by the Court of Appeal in 1988.
   The explosions in two pubs in Birmingham on Nov. 21, 1974, were
the deadliest attack ever mounted in England by the outlawed Irish
Republican Army in its campaign against British rule in Northern
Ireland. The explosions killed 21 people and injured 162.
   Scientific tests of police notes of an interview with convict
Richard McIlkenny indicated that some pages were written at
different times, the Home Office said.
   Waddington said the interview with McIlkenny implicated one
other defendant, but fairness required a review of all six cases.
   ``It's very, very difficult to disentangle the significance of
evidence like this for the case of one defendant as compared with
its significance for the case of the other defendants,'' Waddington
said in an interview with BBC radio.
   Chris Mullin, a member of Parliament who wrote a book arguing
the innocence of the six, said it was likely that much additional
new evidence would be presented to the court.
   ``For the first time, I detect that there is a will on the part
of many of those in authority to bring this great scandal to an end
once and for all,'' said Mullin, a member of the opposition Labor
Party. ``It's casting a blight upon our whole legal system not only
at home but around the world.''
   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey said the new appeal was
``very good news.'' Relations between Britain and Ireland have been
strained by the Birmingham Six case and others in Britain involving
IRA suspects.
   Five of the six men were arrested a few hours after the
bombings, as they were about to board a ferry to Belfast, Northern
Ireland, for the funeral of an IRA member.
   McIlkenny, Callaghan, Johnny Walker, Patrick Hill, Gerry Hunter
and Billy Power were convicted of murder in 1975 and sentenced to
life in prison.
   They were refused the right to appeal in 1976 and failed in a
1977 lawsuit alleging that they were assaulted by investigating
officers. A decade later the government acknowledged doubts about
their convictions by referring the case to the Court of Appeal,
which affirmed the convictions.
   The Birmingham Six case is the last of three major trials of
suspected IRA guerrillas from the 1970s to be returned to the
appellate courts following vigorous public campaigns proclaiming
the defendants' innocence.
   Three men and a woman convicted of killing six people in
bombings in Guildford and Woolwich in 1975 were freed by the Court
of Appeal in October. Six other people convicted in a related case
of operating an IRA bomb factory are awaiting an appeal hearing,
after Waddington announced in June that the convictions were
``unsafe.''
   In March, Waddington asked the Devon and Cornwall Constabulary
to investigate certain undisclosed points raised by attorneys for
the Birmingham Six.
   Devon and Cornwall police conducted electrostatic deposition
tests on records of the West Midlands police force, whose
detectives investigated the Birmingham bombings. The test can
determine when a document was written and whether any alterations
have been made to it.
   A year ago, West Midlands Chief Constable Geoffrey Dear
suspended two detectives and reassigned 53 members of the Serious
Crime Squad after the tests indicated that records had been
falsified in cases going back to 1986.
   Supporters of the Birmingham Six argue that their confessions
were contradictory, that police tampered with logs to make
statements appear consistent, that forensic evidence was flawed and
that no witness testified to seeing any of the men in the two pubs.

   Here, at a glance, are Wednesday's developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials rushed to Jordan's border with Iraq to greet
Americans fleeing from Iraq, but there was no sign that Saddam
Hussein had carried out his pledge to free Western women and
children.
   No members of that hostage group were aboard the two Iraqi
Airways flights that arrived in Amman, Jordan, from Baghdad.
   Cable News Network quoted unidentified Iraqi officials as saying
an Iraqi Airways plane filled with Westerners will leave Baghdad
for Amman on Thursday.

   Nine reservists helping in the U.S. military buildup in the
Persian Gulf were among the 13 people killed in the crash of U.S.

   President Bush called the Persian Gulf crisis ``one of the
toughest military missions in modern memory,'' and told U.S. troops
they are bringing America's principles to life.
   Bush's pep talk to U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia was broadcast
over Armed Forces Radio, but many troops apparently did not hear it
because the radio network does not have a transmitter in Saudi
Arabia.

   Iraq has told the White House it would withdraw from Kuwait and
allow foreigners to leave if certain demands were met, Newsday
reported. In its secret offer, Iraq said it wants United Nations
sanctions lifted, guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf and sole
control of an oil field that dips into Kuwait. A White House
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the offer was
received but rejected. Iraq's official news agency said no such
proposal was made.

   OPEC oil ministers approved a plan allowing Saudi Arabia,
Venezuela and other member countries to pump more oil and help hold
down crude prices. One OPEC minister predicted the agreement could
replace 3 million of the 4 million barrels of oil the day that
disappeared from the world market because of the embargos on Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil. That shortfall caused oil prices to skyrocket.

   After days of discussion, Japan announced it will supply money,

   Soviet authorities sent home a Chinese pilot and
his MiG-19 fighter Wednesday, four days after he flew to
Vladivostok and announced he wanted to go to the United States.
   Senior Lt. Van Baoshi was put on a passenger plane that the
Chinese government sent from Beijing to pick him up, the Soviet
government newspaper Izvestia reported.
   His fate in China was uncertain, but he could be tried for
desertion, theft of state property or even treason, which carries a
possible death penalty.
   The Tu-154 plane carrying Baoshi took off just behind his MiG-19
fighter, flown by another Chinese pilot, Izvestia said.
   Both Izvestia and the Communist Party newspaper Pravda said
Baoshi had nearly collided with a passenger plane taking off from
Vladivostok Airport when he landed. They said he arrived at the
eastern Soviet city near the Chinese border on Saturday.
   Baoshi, 28, told Soviet investigators he had wanted to fly to
the United States but didn't have enough fuel, Izvestia reported.

<HEAD>FCC Official: TV Stations May Have to Give Jackson Opponents Equal
TIme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington-area TV stations may have to offer
equal time to political opponents of Jesse Jackson if the stations
show him conducting interviews in the Middle East, a federal
official said Wednesday.
   Jackson hopes to interview Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, along
with American hostages, this week for the syndicated TV series,
``Inside Edition,'' which is broadcast on the local NBC-owned TV
station.
   Jackson is running in the District of Columbia for a ``shadow''
seat in the U.S. Senate, an unpaid lobbyist post for D.C.
statehood. He reportedly is being paid about $125,000 to work as a
journalist, although officials at King World Productions, which
syndicates ``Inside Edition,'' have said they're only picking up
Jackson's expenses.
   News programs can claim exemption from federal equal opportunity
_ commonly known as equal time _ rules if candidates are the
subjects of bona fide newscasts, documentaries or other types of
legitimate news events.
   But because Jackson will be an interviewer and not an
interviewee, a station probably could not claim such an exemption,
said Milton Gross, chief of the Federal Communications Commission's
fairness-political programming branch.
   Gross said he gave such an opinion informally to someone who
called him on behalf of the NBC-owned station in Washington,
WRC-TV, which broadcasts ``Inside Edition.'' He would not identify
the caller.
   ``The subject of the news would be exempt, but not the
interviewer,'' Gross said.
   He added that ``Inside Edition'' had not sought an equal time
exemption as a news program, as have some other shows such as
``Hard Copy'' and ``Entertainment Tonight.''
   Gross based his opinion on a Supreme Court ruling involving a
California newscaster who also was a political candidate. The
newscaster had argued that the equal time rules were depriving him
of his livelihood. But the court said station employees could not
claim the exemption, Gross said.
   Jackson's appearance on ``Inside Edition'' would not be exempt
if the Supreme Court's decision were applicable, Gross said.
   The FCC official said he did not know if the equal time rules
would apply to a Washington station that used portions of Jackson's
``Inside Edition'' appearance on its regularly scheduled news
programs.
   He said he could give a definitive ruling only if a Jackson
opponent demanded equal time and a station refused.
   WRC-TV vice president-general manager Allan Horlick said he felt
his station could broadcast Jackson's interview without being
subject to any equal time claim.
   ``We anticipate certainly broadcasting the show and we will be
in full compliance with anything coincidental to the fact he is
running for a shadow Senate position,'' Horlick said.
   Jackson also has a new syndicated program, ``The Jesse Jackson
Show,'' due to debut next month nationwide, but it will be blacked
out in the Washington area until after the November election.

   After leaving a note saying ``we decided we
don't want anymore,'' an 82-year-old man shot and killed his
80-year-old, cancer-stricken wife in her hospital room Wednesday,
then killed himself, police said.
   ``It appears to be a homicide-suicide, mercy-type killing,''
Police Chief Frank Pomeroy said.
   Jane Harbrecht had been at Community Memorial Hospital for about
two weeks awaiting surgery and was told Tuesday she had colon
cancer that had spread to the lymph nodes, Pomeroy said.
   Her husband, Raymond Harbrecht, had previously been married to
another woman who died of cancer. ``A lot of financial and
emotional concerns came from that,'' Pomeroy said.
   Harbrecht entered the hospital around 6:20 a.m., spoke to a
receptionist and then went to his wife's second-floor room. He shot
her once in the head with a .38-caliber revolver, then sat in a
chair and shot himself, Pomeroy said. Both died immediately.
   Harbrecht left a note to his son-in-law that read, in part:
   ``Dave, sorry to do this, but we decided that we don't want
anymore. You are free to do anything you wish because we know it
will be right. Mom and Dad. P.S. Give car to Nick. Pop.''
   The note was dated Wednesday, Pomeroy said. It was found at the
couple's home about a mile south of Winona, a city in southeast
Minnesota.
   Pomeroy didn' disclose the son-in-law's full name and said he
didn't know Nick's relationship to the family.
   Hospital officials had no indication of what was going to
happen, Pomeroy said, adding he didn't know what Harbrecht said to
the receptionist before entering his wife's room.
   Harbrecht apparently hid the gun in his pants when he entered
the hospital, Pomeroy said. Police found the weapon on the floor
next to Harbrecht.

   A photo taken by the Hubble Space Telescope
shows a galaxy seen only as fuzzy ball by telescopes on Earth is
actually so tightly packed with stars that it may harbor a black
hole at its center, NASA said Wednesday.
   The picture, which an official said was taken ``to prove to the
public that the Hubble is not broken,'' shows a galaxy 400 times
more tightly packed with stars than the sun's own Milky Way galaxy.
   Scientists said the Hubble photo captured more detail of the
galaxy than is possible by Earthbound telescopes and was thus able
to determine that the stellar group had many more stars than
expected.
   The picture was taken by the wide field-planetary camera on
Hubble, one of the instruments officials said was seriously
affected by a focusing flaw manufactured into the telescope but not
discovered until after it was launched.
   Officials also released a photo taken with another Hubble camera
that shows a ring of matter encircling a supernova, a star that
exploded in the southern sky in 1987. The ring of material had not
been spotted before by telescopes on Earth.
   Tod R. Lauer, an astronomer with the National Optical Astronomy
Observatories, said the compact galaxy of stars discovered by the
Hubble ``is vastly denser than we expected this galaxy to be.''
   He said ground-based photos of the galaxy showed a smooth blob
of light and gave no suggestion that it contained so many stars.
   ``We've never been able to study any galaxy outside of our local
group (two dozen galaxies near the Milky Way) at this resolution
before,'' Lauer said.
   The galaxy, called NGC7457, is 40 million light years away and
contains about 30,000 stars within an area of only about nine light
years.
   Hubble chief scientist Ed Weiler said that one explanation for
such a dense galaxy would be the presence of a black hole.
   ``We're not claiming that this is a black hole,'' he said at a
news conference. ``It is not inconsistent with a black hole,
however.''
   Astronomy theory holds that a black hole can be formed when
stellar matter collects in such a mass of such density and of such
a high gravitational force that even light cannot escape.
   There have been no confirmed black holes found in the universe,
but Weiler said that if one existed it might take on the appearance
of the galaxy photographed by the Hubble.
   Weiler said the galaxy will be further studied by Hubble
instruments to determine if it does contain a black hole.
   The other photo released showed a glowing ring encircling
supernova 1987A, an exploded star 160,000 light years from Earth.
   The picture was taken by Hubble's faint object camera, an
instrument made the European Space Agency for the space telescope.
   Nino Panagia, a ESA scientist, said the photo shows that matter
ejected from the star years before its explosion was compacted and
then set aglow by the burst of light when the star blew up. He said
the ring will be blow apart within a few years when the blast wave
from the exploding collides with the material in the ring.
   NASA took the pictures as part of a campaign to demonstrate that
the Hubble is a valuable telescope even though it has flawed optics.
   Eric Chaisson, educational director of the Space Telescope
Science Institute in Baltimore, said he wrote memos in recent weeks
calling for a campaign to change the perception of the public and
of the science community about the problems with Hubble.
   In a memo obtained by the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News,
Chaisson said action should be taken to change the public image of
the $1.6 billion observatory.
   ``Unless a dramatic campaign is mounted to share with the
American public the technical truth with a positive spin,''
Chaisson wrote, ``then we should prepare ourselves for an endless
stream of newspaper cartoons, late-night TV talk-show jokes and
blistering post-mortems by columnists the world over.''
   He added: ``We shall continue to see an erosion of public
support for NASA's ambitious space program.''
   Reached by telephone, Chaisson confirmed that he had written
such a memo, noting that the pictures of the galaxy and supernova
were taken in part because of his efforts.
   ``We needed some science to prove to the public that Hubble is
not broken,'' he said. ``I don't apologize for it. What I was
trying to do (with the memo) was to jerk the system around so it
would do a little science.''
   Since Hubble has been launched, it has been in a shakedown
operation designed to test it capabilities. Since the focusing flaw
was found, engineers have been operating the Hubble to find out the
precise nature of the malfunction.
   Chaisson said his memo helped persuade NASA to interrupt the
engineering checkout and take some pictures of scientific value.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev chewed out five top
officials on Wednesday for the cigarette shortage that has led to
street protests across the nation and rationing in Moscow.
   ``The discussion showed that managing officials acted
irresponsibly, neglected their duties and have not taken necessary
measures to resolve the problem concerning millions of people,''
Tass reported.
   The official Soviet news agency said Gorbachev demanded an
explanation of the tobacco shortage from the officials and found
their responses ``unconvincing and unsound.''
   The meeting came one day after the Moscow City Council voted to
begin cigarette rationing, at just five packs a month per person,
starting Saturday. Authorities have also announced price increases
that will triple the official cost of most cigarette brands
starting next month.
   The tobacco shortage, which has lasted all summer, has forced
Soviet smokers to spend hours waiting in lines at kiosks to buy
cigarettes.
   Hundreds of irate nicotine addicts have rallied in Moscow,
Leningrad, Gorky and other cities, and young people demanding more
cigarettes, alcohol and food rioted in the Siberian city of
Chelyabinsk.
   The officials summoned by Gorbachev to provide explanations for
the shortage were Soviet first deputy prime ministers Vladilen
Nikitin and Lev Voronin, Russian Republic prime minister Ivan
Silayev, Russian Republic first deputy prime minister Gennady Kulik
and deputy minister of trade Suren Sarukhanov.
   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov also attended the session, Tass
said, but he apparently did not suffer Gorbachev's wrath.
   Official spokesmen have blamed the shortage on factory
breakdowns, hoarding by black marketeers and the near-depletion of
the nation's reserves of foreign currency, which has led to reduced
cigarette imports from Bulgaria.

<HEAD>Population Gains to Give Sunbelt States More Seats in Congress</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts new 6th graf with 1980 population</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The flow of Americans to California has pushed
the Golden State far ahead of all rivals in population and will
give it a record 52 seats in the 1992 House of Representatives, new
census figures indicate.
   Preliminary 1990 population figures show California picking up
seven House seats, followed by Florida with four, Texas three and a
handful of other warm-weather states with one each.
   New York hung on to its No. 2 ranking in population behind
California in the new figures _ with Texas and Florida closing fast
in third and fourth places _ but will lose three seats in Congress
because its population rose only slightly in the 1980s.
   Four Northern industrial states _ Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania _ lost population during the decade and will have two
fewer seats each.
   The Census Bureau estimated a national count of just under 246
million, including 29.3 million in California, 17.6 million in New
York, 16.8 million in Texas and 12.8 million in Florida. Wyoming
was last, at just under 450,000, passed by Alaska, which had the
smallest population in 1980 but grew to almost 546,000 in 1990.
   The total population count in 1980 was 226,545,805.
   House seats are redistributed among the states after each
Census. Because the number is limited to 435 seats, when a growing
state gains a seat some other state must lose one.
   New York's slight population gain was quickly disputed by state
officials, who had predicted repeatedly that the state would be
undercounted.
   ``I don't believe it,'' Gov. Mario Cuomo said in Albany. ``Do
you really, honestly believe that everybody who should be counted
has been counted? The answer is of course not. My mother had
trouble; she didn't want to answer.''
   New York Mayor David N. Dinkins called the city's estimated
slight decline ``unadulterated nonsense'' and promised to pinpoint
where he said the government had made errors.
   Overall 19 House seats will change states according to the
figures, which could change significantly before the final report
is issued Dec. 31.
   The widely noted movement of Americans to the Sun Belt was
documented anew in the Census Bureau figures. Besides California,
Florida and Texas, states gaining a House seat each were Arizona,
Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington.
   Besides the two-seat losers _ Illinois, Michigan, Ohio and
Pennsylvania _ there will be one less seat each for Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Montana, New Jersey and West
Virginia.
   Overall, the preliminary Census figures show the United States
with a population of 245,837,683 residents. That's somewhat below
the 250 million that the bureau had estimated earlier this year.
   However, 4 million or more may be added as the Census Bureau
conducts follow up counts and completes tabulations before the
final reports are made public. If those are added in only a few
states, some of the seats allocated in the preliminary tally could
shift again.
   For example, a study by the private firm Election Data Services
showed Kentucky and Mississippi neck and neck for the last seat
allocated. Mississippi got the seat, but a shift of 3,000 people
could shift it to Kentucky.
   Kimball Brace, head of EDS, stressed that the figures are
subject to change.
   In addition to changes made after local officials assess the
preliminary figures, there is a chance that the final report could
be adjusted next summer.
   The bureau has been criticized for undercounting minorities in
the past and is conducting a post-census check on its count this
time. If officials determine that some group has been missed a
decision could be made to statistically adjust the final numbers.
   That ruling will be made by the Department of Commerce in
mid-July 1991.
   The national total was completed Wednesday with the reports for
the final four states _ New York, Texas, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
   Census officials emphasize that the figures are provided to
allow local governments to question the results in the event people
were missed or overcounted.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met with his chief
rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, for several hours on Wednesday and they
discussed their nation's crumbling economy and relations with
Japan, a spokesman said.
   The meeting was the first between the two since they clashed
earlier this month over the attempt by Russia, the Soviet Union's
largest republic, to seize control over its vast natural resources
from the central Soviet government.
   Yeltsin is president of the Russian republic. Gorbachev issued a
presidential decree last week nullifying the Russian move.
   ``This was a very good and a very constructive discussion,''
said Gorbachev's new spokesman, Vitaly Ignatenko.
   Ignatenko said the two talked about matters relating to Russia,
the entire Soviet Union and international topics including Europe
and relations with Japan.
   He provided few details on the discussion, but he said the
Soviet economy was a central theme.
   ``The situation in the country is such that we are on the
threshold of major decisions,'' Ignatenko said. ``We have
approached such a decisive stage when we are speaking about a real
change in economic structures and new relationships within the
union itself.
   ``Old structures are becoming a thing of the past, but the new
structures are still emerging. This gives rise to a certain
instability, to heated discussions and this situation cannot easily
be kept under control.''
   Gorbachev and Yeltsin have jointly appointed a commission to
study making the transition to a market economy. Another
commission, led by Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, is also
drafting plans for the economic switch.
   Gorbachev favors a gradual approach to avoid the shock of sudden
price increases. Yeltsin wants to make the transition quickly,
arguing that the ailing economy needs urgent measures.
   Yeltsin has accused Ryzhkov of duplicating his work, and said if
more than one plan were presented to the national parliament, the
Russian republic would go its own way.
   Ignatenko said Gorbachev would convene a joint meeting of his
Presidential Council and the Council of the Federation on Thursday.
Gorbachev has invited Yeltsin and other leaders of the Soviet
republics and autonomous regions to attend.
   This meeting also will focus on the economy and the unrest in
the republics, Ignatenko said.
   ``Today our leadership is expressing only one wish: to stabilize
the situation, to protect the new economic policy by exercising its
powers to defend perestroika,'' he said. ``The coming few months
should be decisive in many ways.
   ``I hope that this political line will be protected.''
   Ignatenko, whose appointment was announced Tuesday, told a room
crowded with journalists that he planned to hold weekly news
conferences.

   Classes were supposed to start here
Wednesday, but after a few howling minutes of chaos there was no
class, no school, and for many residents, no home.
   The twisters that tore into this northern Illinois community and
several neighboring towns Tuesday killed at least 24 people and
injured more than 300. As they flipped cars and tore roofs off
houses, the tornadoes also threatened to bury hundreds of lives.
   ``Life in Plainfield, Crest Hill, Joliet and surrounding towns
will never be the same,'' said an editorial in Wednesday's Joliet
Herald-News. ``It has only been a few hours since the tragedy
struck. It will take days, weeks and years to recover.''
   Scores of residents were left homeless. Some residents who had
been planning a new beginning were suddenly faced with nothing.
   Jerry O'Shea, a new teacher, was getting ready for the start of
classes and left Plainfield High School minutes before the twisters
hit. He returned Wednesday to a school in ruin.
   ``This was going to be my first day teaching,'' O'Shea said.
``Welcome to Plainfield.''
   In the Warwick subdivision of Joliet, about 35 miles southwest
of Chicago, new homes finished in the last six months were reduced
to their foundations in minutes. Joliet officials had to explain to
a touring Gov. James R. Thompson that it wasn't a construction zone.
   ``All these homes were occupied,'' said Joliet Alderman Warren
Dorris. ``We lost 31 (homes) and we had three fatalities here. It's
just a shock.''
   There were even more homeless at a seven-building apartment
complex in Crest Hill, near Plainfield. Parts of the complex were
destroyed, and authorities were only allowing people into
relatively undamaged buildings to retrieve personal belongings.
   Norm Treonis, chairman of the company that owns the apartment
complex, said he was working to put displaced residents into some
of the company's other vacant apartments, rent-free, for up to two
months.
   Workers also were issuing checks on the spot to reimburse
residents for security deposits and rent. By late morning Treonis
had issued checks to more than 100 people for amounts ranging from
$200 to $600.
   Most storefronts along Plainfield's main thoroughfare, Lockport
Street, were shuttered Wednesday. But two insurance agencies were
doing a brisk business.
   ``We've had three dozen calls since eight o'clock this
morning,'' said Mike Hull of Plainfield Insurance Agency Inc.
   In Plainfield Township people also hurried to clean yards and
what was left of their homes.
   ``We're just waiting for the insurance guy to come out,'' said
Jim Schmidt, owner of a frame house that suffered extensive damage
in the storm. ``Obviously it's going to be a while.''
   The American Red Cross had three shelters for the homeless.
While providing for immediate needs such as food and clothing, the
organization was also concerned about the long-term mental impact
of the disaster.
   The Red Cross will provide ``someone to talk to and some stress
counseling,'' said spokeswoman Michele McCrillis.
   ``A lot of people _ it hasn't hit them yet,'' she said. ``The
full shock isn't going to hit them probably for a little while.''
   The flat area southwest of Chicago is sometimes referred to as
``Tornado Alley.'' On June 23, 1976, three people were killed when
a twister passed through nearby Lemont. A 1969 tornado killed 33
people in Oak Lawn, a southwest Chicago suburb.

<HEAD>Record Heat Continues From Plains to South Atlantic Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wednesday was another scorcher from the lower half of the Plains
to the southern Atlantic coast, and rain spread through the Ohio
Valley.
   Record high temperatures were recorded in Jonesboro, Ark., at
102; Macon, Ga., 102; and Tupelo, Miss., 102, and tied in Augusta,
Ga., 100; Cape Hatteras, N.C., 91, and Jacksonville, Fla., 99.
   Humidity with the 99 degrees at Jacksonville brought the heat
index to near 110 degrees.
   In Alabama, state health officials issued a heat alert, warning
people to stay indoors as much as possible. Alabama farmers fear
continued hot, dry weather that has parched pastures and fields
will severely reduce harvests of cotton and peanuts.
   In Washington County, Arkansas, record heat killed thousands of
chickens.
   Bob Justice, a spokesman for Tyson Foods Inc. in Springdale,
said the company's growers have lost 25,000 birds in the last few
days.
   Afternoon showers and thunderstorms extended over Kentucky,
Tennessee, western North Carolina, parts of West Virginia, northern
Ohio, southern Indiana and southern Illinois.
   Showers and storms also were scattered along the Gulf Coast, the
coast of the Pacific Northwest, northeastern California,
north-central Iowa and northern Maine.
   A record low temperature for the day was recorded in Hollywood,
Fla., at 69.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 31 at Truckee, Calif.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 58 at
Bremerton and Oak Harbor, Wash., and San Luis Obispo, Calif., to

   Lockheed Corp.'s contender in the
competition to see which defense contractor will build the nation's
21st century fighter jet was unveiled Wednesday, a fierce-looking,
twin-tailed, stubby-winged craft.
   Air Force generals at the ceremony said the Middle East crisis
demonstrates the need for such a plane.
   Lockheed's YF-22 prototype of the Advanced Tactical Fighter was
rolled out at its Palmdale manufacturing plant to the strains of
Wagner's ``The Ride of the Valkyries'' in the background.
   ``This is a great day for the evolution of tactical aircraft,''
said Lockheed chairman Daniel M. Tellep.
   Lockheed's plane will compete against a Northrop model YF-23,
which was rolled out and taken for a test flight Monday.
   Lockheed teamed with the Boeing Corp. and General Dynamics to
build the YF-22. Northrop teamed with McDonnell Douglas to build
its prototype.
   Both planes have smooth contours to reduce their radar
reflections and are built of advanced composite materials.
   The Pentagon wants a fighter plane that can fly twice the speed
of sound without using fuel-guzzling afterburners. But it must also
be highly maneuverable for dogfights with other planes and use
radar-evading stealth technology.
   The Lockheed plane resembles the Navy's FA-18 Hornet
fighter-attack aircraft, with stubby wings.
   The Northrop plane is longer, with a cigar-like fuselage and a
wingspan that, from overhead, looks like a kite.
   The Lockheed YF-22 stayed on the ground after its rollout
ceremony and officials refused to say when it would be flown.
Tellep said it doesn't matter that Northrop got its aircraft up
first.
   ``It is not he who flies first, it is he who flies best,'' he
said.
   The ATF program faced fading prospects for approval in Congress
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, but the crisis has
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense projects.
   The contract calls for 750 fighter planes for the Air Force and
approximately 500 for the Navy at a cost of $51 million apiece. The
price tag is about twice the cost of the F-15 Eagle, the current
front-line fighter deployed in the Middle East.
   The F-15 will have been in service nearly 30 years when the
first ATFs enter military service in the year 2002.
   Air Force Gen. Ronald W. Yates Jr. recalled the Munich crisis of
1938, in which Adolf Hitler's military might forced appeasement by
Britain's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. He compared it to
today's standoff with Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   The difference is the support of a strong military armed with
the most advanced weaponry, said Yates, commander of the Air Force
Systems Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base near Dayton,
Ohio.
   Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph W. Ralston said he is optimistic
about congressional funding for the ATF program in spite of recent
defense spending cuts.

<HEAD>Perjury Charges Filed Against Police Chief; Interim Chief
Appointed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Seven perjury charges were filed Wednesday against
suspended Police Chief Mack Vines as a result of an investigation
into his testimony to a special panel that looked into the shooting
of a civilian by an officer.
   ``It's sufficient to note that we found in that investigation
... seven separate counts of aggravated perjury,'' said District
Attorney John Vance. ``I think the chief made two appearances
(before the panel), but we can't go into what is alleged in each of
those because that is still pending before the grand jury.''
   Vance said the charges would be presented to the grand jury on
Sept. 10. A third-degree felony carries a maximum 10-year prison
term and fines of up to $10,000.
   City Manager Jan Hart, said Vines, 51, would remain on
indefinite suspension and named a new acting chief.
   Vines' attorney, Kim Wade, was ``not speaking with the media,''
a woman who answered the phone at Wade's office said Wednesday.
Vines in the past has denied wrongdoing and has refused to resign.
   Some city council members said the charges alone are enough to
cost Vines the job he has held since July 1988. During his tenure,
Vines has angered some veteran officers while winning the support
of some leaders of minority groups. ``I think it would be nearly
impossible for Chief Vines to lead this police department with the
confidence of the city into the future. Humpty Dumpty is broken and
I don't think there's any reasonable way of putting that all
together again,'' said Councilman Jerry Bartos.
   Dallas Police Association President Monica Smith, who has been
critical of Vines in the past, said she believed Vines ``is
entitled to and will receive a fair review of the facts presented
to the grand jury by the district attorney's office.''
   The developments stem from the fatal shooting last year of an
unarmed Mexican national by officer Patrick LeMaire. Vines fired
LeMaire 17 days after the killing.
   LeMaire was reinstated last month by an administrative law judge
who said Vines failed to justify the firing. During the
administrative hearing, an internal affairs detective testified
that his initial report on the shooting was altered.
   That led the city manager to appoint a three-member panel to
look into the internal affairs officer's allegations, and the speed
with which LeMaire was fired.
   Ms. Hart suspended Vines and Assistant Chief Greg Holliday with
pay on Aug. 3 after Holliday told her Vines had called him at home
and tried to persuade him to de-emphasize in his testimony the
speed of Vines' firing of LeMaire.
   Ms. Hart asked Vance to investigate the charges.
   The panel decided the haste ``created a frenzied atmosphere
conducive to mistakes'' and said that cast suspicion on LeMaire's
suspension.
   Vance said Holliday was helpful in the investigation, and Ms.
Hart said, ``there is no indication that Chief Holliday was not
truthful to the panel.'' She lifted his suspension Wednesday and
said he would return to work immediately.

<TEXT>
   Rescuers on Wednesday started hauling
to the surface the bodies of 150 miners killed in the country's
worst mining accident. Officials said the death toll could
eventually reach 180.
   Mining inspectors said too many miners were allowed in the Kreka
coal mine shaft at the time of Sunday's blast, although they did
not say how many miners should have been allowed.
   Inspectors also said mine officials broke regulations by
allowing relatives of the miners to work in the mine without being
officially assigned there. The mine is located 90 miles west of
Belgrade.
   Rescuers in recent days found the bodies of 150 miners and
started bringing them up early Wednesday with a conveyor system
repaired after the blast, according to Bosko Zelic, a member of the
mine's managing board.
   Rescue teams working in round-the-clock shifts were still trying
to clear away rubble blocking access to remote parts of the
nine-mile maze of underground corridors, officials said. They also
were striving to ventilate all corridors to eliminate the
possibility of a new explosion.
   The management issued an updated casualty list with the names of
180 miners instead of the 170 previously thought to have been
working underground at the time of the explosion.
   The blast is thought to have been caused by a buildup of coal
dust or methane gas. An investigation is under way.
   Officials said a funeral ceremony will be held on the main
square of the nearby town of Tuzla once the bodies of all victims
are recovered.
   Yugoslavia's worst previous mining disaster occurred in 1965,
when 128 miners were killed in a mine explosion in Bosnia.
   Ninety miners were killed in an explosion at a coal mine south
of Belgrade in November.

<HEAD>Authorities Say Manager of Failed Credit Union Has Recovered</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former manager of a failed credit union
has recovered from a mental illness enough to understand fraud and
tax charges against him and help in his defense, federal medical
authorities said.
   Lawrence E. King Jr., former manager of the Franklin Community
Federal Credit Union, will be allowed to return to Omaha from the
U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Rochester, Minn., U.S.
Magistrate Richard Kopf said in an order filed Tuesday.
   King is ordered to report Friday to a pretrial services officer
in the U.S. Probation Office in Omaha, Kopf said.
   Kopf ordered the report sealed but said in his order:
   ``In pertinent part, the certificate provides that Mr. King has
recovered from his mental disease or defect to such an extent that
he is able to understand the nature and consequences of the
proceedings against him and to assist properly in his defense.''
   The judge gave defense attorneys 10 days to study the
psychiatric report. A federal court hearing will be held later to
determine whether King is now competent to stand trial on charges
facing him, Kopf said.
   King, a prominent businessman who sang the national anthem at
the 1984 Republican National Convention, is awaiting trial in U.S.
District Court on 40 counts charging conspiracy, fraud and filing
false tax returns stemming from the November 1988 failure of
Franklin.
   King's wife, Alice, is charged with 12 counts of conspiracy and
fraud.
   Federal authorities said $39 million was missing from the credit
union, which had been established to help north Omaha's poor, when
it was closed on Nov. 4, 1988.
   King was sent to the Rochester center April 5 for four months of
examination and evaluation after being found incompetent to stand
trial. He had been diagnosed as suffering from ``delusional
paranoid disorder, grandiose type'' by the chief psychiatrist at
the U.S. Medical Facility at Springfield, Mo.
   King's court-appointed attorneys, Steven Achelpohl and Marilyn
Abbott, did not challenge the competency finding in March. A third
attorney appointed to represent King's personal interests in the
case, Alan Stoler, said King thought he was competent and resisted
the evaluation and treatment.
   King and his wife were indicted by a federal grand jury in May
1989.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government
said Wednesday the two Germanys will likely sign within two days a
treaty providing the formal basis for unification, although
differences remain over abortion.
   In East Germany, an estimated 90,000 public employees in at
least 20 cities held a second day of warning strikes over fears
their jobs will be endangered by unification with West Germany.
   About 10,000 nurses, garbagemen, bus drivers and others stopped
working for two hours in East Berlin.
   Strikes of up to two hours were also reported in Erfurt,
Potsdam, Leipzig, Gera and several other cities. Fire trucks and
garbage trucks blocked several streets, and the airport in Leipzig
was temporarily closed.
   In Bonn, West Germany's capital, Interior Minister Wolfgang
Schaeuble said a treaty to serve as the document formally merging
the nations on Oct. 3 and meshing their laws is near approval.
   Closed-door talks among government and opposition officials
continued into the night in an effort to clear up the remaining
difficulties. But Schaeuble said no difficulties were expected in
getting the approval of all sides.
   Parties within Kohl's coalition had already signaled they would
yield to the opposition Social Democrats' insistence no West German
women be prosecuted for seeking abortions in East Germany after
unity.
   The left-of-center Social Democrats had threatened to veto the
treaty over that issue.
   But late Wednesday another disagreement arose in the abortion
dispute _ how long after unity the two Germanys would keep their
widely differing abortion laws.
   East Germany's abortion law is far more permissive than West
Germany's.
   The major political parties had already agreed the two Germanys
should keep their respective abortion laws for an interim two-year
period until an all-German parliament can choose abortion statutes
for a united Germany.
   But the Social Democrats insisted Wednesday night that there
should be a three-year extension if the all-German parliament fails
to agree on a new abortion law. Lawmakers from Kohl's coalition
said the more restrictive West German abortion regulations should
automatically extend to what is now East Germany at the end of two
years.
   Earlier Wednesday, Schaeuble expressed confidence that all major
obstacles to the treaty would be worked out.
   Schaeuble also said Kohl's government and West Germany's 11
states agreed that Oct. 3, the chosen date of unity, will be
written into the treaty as an all-German national holiday.
   The interior minister told reporters the treaty will likely be
signed Friday in West Berlin at a ceremony in the Reichstag, the
former Parliament and one of Germany's most important landmarks,
``if everything goes according to my own desires.''
   He said the two German governments will hold one final round of
negotiations on the treaty Thursday.
   Schaeuble made the remarks after Kohl met with governors of the
11 West German states, most of whom belong to the opposition Social
Democrat Party.
   The conservative chancellor needs a two-thirds parliamentary
majority to ratify the treaty and thus the support of the Social
Democrats, the second-largest party in West Germany.
   The Social Democrats had given Kohl until Wednesday to reverse
his earlier decision on abortion. During the past two days, he had
given strong signals he would do so rather than jeopardize the
treaty.
   Approval of the treaty was not essential for unification. But
leaders of both nations considered it imperative that they
negotiate such a document rather than allow West German law to
simply take effect automatically in East Germany.
   But there were intense differences _ even within Kohl's
coalition _ over his earlier decision that West German women be
legally barred from seeking abortions in East Germany.
   In another issue threatening to block the treaty, West Germany's
states were afraid they might get unfair treatment when it comes to
divvying up sales tax revenues with the five soon-to-be-resurrected
East German states.
   Under the draft treaty, East German states will get a smaller
proportion of the revenues than West German states because of their
smaller economies.
   Nonetheless, the treaty will pave the way for more assistance
than the East German states now receive from West Germany.

   A district judge has released eight Indians
accused of participating in a drug cult that allegedly killed about
30 people, a lawyer for a government advocacy group said Wednesday.
   The action by Judge Jose Cuevas Zavala in Tepic, 400 miles
northwest of Mexico City, represents another blow to the
spectacular case launched by federal police in July.
   In comments to reporters last month, the judge ridiculed police
allegations that the Indians had killed about 30 people in satanic
rituals.
   Prosecutors in neighboring Durango state, where the killings
allegedly occurred, refused to press charges in connection with the
alleged deaths.
   No human remains were found, and senior church officials in the
area denied the existence of a satanic cult.
   The National Indian Institute, a government organization to
protect Indians, joined the case to help Tepehuano Indian
defendants it said were being mistreated by police.
   The Institute attorney, Carlos Puga Quiroga, said the judge on
Tuesday ordered the eight released on their own recognizance. They
still face the only charges filed against them _ cultivating
marijuana in their remote villages.
   In addition, Puga said five minors held in the case have been
cleared of any charges and will be released to their parents.
   Only one man, Olayo Soto Soto, remains imprisoned in the case.
Puga said Soto is accused of owning the land on which police found
a small marijuana patch, while the others were accused only of
helping cultivate the crop.
   In July, federal police in Tepic claimed Soto was the chief
sorcerer of a cult that worshipped an idol called ``El Amigo,'' or
``The Friend,'' that had sacrificed 30 or more people to gain
protection for their drug activities.
   Members of the group initially confessed to the allegations
during police questioning. But they recanted before the judge,
saying the confessions had been beaten out of them.
   Soto told reporters he is a traditional Indian healer, but he
denied practicing any sorcery. The Institute also has appealed for
his release.
   In an earlier drug-cult case, police in April 1989 found 15
bodies buried on a ranch near the northern city of Matamoros across
the U.S.-Mexico border from Brownsville, Texas. Among those slain
21-year-old University of Texas student Mark Kilroy.
   
   Police claimed those victims were slain by drug smugglers who
believed human sacrifices would protect them from police.
   Group leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo and his bodyguard died of
gunshot wounds as police closed in on them in a Mexico City
apartment in May 1989. Ten people still face charges in connection
with the case.

   Cuba on Wednesday announced sweeping
energy-saving measures to compensate for a 2-million-ton deficit in
oil deliveries from the Soviet Union.
   The supply of gasoline by private vehicles was cut by 30 percent
and unspecified cuts were instituted in the delivery of diesel fuel
to state enterprises.
   The measures were announced on state television; a text was made
available through a U.S. government monitoring service. The Cuban
news agency, Prensa Latina, later carried the announcement,
according to monitoring in Mexico City.
   The account said the Soviet Union had not been able to make
deliveries of supplies, including fuels, for some time.
   ``So far, almost 2 million tons of oil and derivatives have not
been delivered,'' the broadcast said. ``It is impossible that such
a high deficit, a fifth of the fuel that should be received, does
not have serious effects in the functioning of the economy and the
life of the country.''
   According to the broadcast, the Soviets are making every effort
to fulfill their commitments and Cuba will continue will its export
delivery schedule to the Soviets.
   It said the gasoline delivered through a voucher system would be
cut by 50 percent, but did not say what percentage of consumption
is accounted for by that system.
   Production at a nickel plant is being halted because of that
industry's high energy consumption, the report said.
   Families were encouraged to reduce the average monthly
consumption of electric power by 10 percent. If there is no such
reduction, households in areas of maximum demand would be forced to
do without electricity one day a week, the broadcast said.

<HEAD>Government Drafts Law To Open First Postwar Stock Exchange</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A law has been drafted to open the first
stock exchange in postwar Poland, a government spokesman said
Wednesday.
   The law on securities and the stock market represents the next
step in Poland's legislative drive toward introducing capitalism.
Last month, the Parliament passed a statute on selling state-owned
industries to private owners.
   Jan Buchacz, a spokesman for the government committee
established to reform Poland's laws on ownership, said the draft
law on the stock exchange is ready for public discussion.
   ``We want everyone to add his opinion and see if there is no
essential discrepancy in it,'' he said.
   He said the law could be passed by Parliament within the next
few weeks.
   Creation of the stock exchange is fundamental to Poland's
economic reform program, which is aimed at transforming the
centralized economy to a market-driven system. Under the
privatization law, all citizens are to be given bonds which can be
exchanged for stock in the previously state-owned companies.
   The draft law provides a legal framework for the functioning of
the stock market, establishing a state-controlled stock exchange
and a committee to grant licenses for issuing and selling shares,
the government daily Rzeczpospolita reported Wednesday.
   ``I treat it as a continuation of the privatization law _
another push, another expression of that law,'' Buchacz told The
Associated Press.
   The government committee studied international stock markets and
followed ``various solutions and experiences, especially of the
British and American systems,'' Buchacz said.
   ``But we also watched closely what was happening in Hungary,''
he said, referring to the first stock exchange in the East bloc,
which opened in Budapest on June 21.
   Rzeczpospolita observed that implementation of the stock
exchange law will mean creation of a new professional group _
brokers _ who will receive licenses from the stock committee and
will be expected to form an association.
   Buchacz said his committee is preparing training programs and
examinations for brokers, a profession virtually unknown in Poland,
and hopes that the first brokers will receive licenses in October
or November.
   ``After this law is passed, we will need only a lot of wise
heads,'' he added.
   Poland had a stock exchange until 1939, when Nazi Germany
invaded. The Soviet-backed Communists who consolidated power after
World War II did not reopen it.

<BYLINE>Army Depots Work Overtime To Meet Crisis Needs
^By RICH KIRKPATRICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW CUMBERLAND, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials at two key Army supply
depots said Wednesday their staffs were working around the clock to
outfit troops sent to Saudi Arabia, despite layoff announcements
that some say have affected morale.
   The officers at the New Cumberland Army Depot and the
Letterkenny Army Depot in Chambersburg, Pa., took reporters and
photographers on a tour of their bases.
   Col. John K. Joseph, commander of the New Cumberland depot, said
his employees' dedication to the Desert Shield mission had overcome
dismay over a layoff announcement that came Aug. 8, just as the
buildup was getting underway.
   ``My impression is the troops are OK,'' he said at a briefing.
``They are pretty patriotic folks and they're dedicated. They're
down there supporting the soldiers that are over there and they're
proud to do it.''
   The depot has been working two shifts, seven days a week in the
wake of the American response to the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, Joseph said. In some areas, three shifts are going, he
said. Most of the employees are civilians.
   At Letterkenny, Col. David Gordon, director of supply, said the
supply and ammunition depots have gone to either 12-hour shifts or
three eight-hour shifts. People have been generally willing to work
overtime, he said.
   ``The attitude's been real good,'' Gordon said.
   Faced with budget cuts, the Army Materiel Command announced
three weeks ago that 365 of the 2,500 employees at New Cumberland
and 450 of 3,400 at Letterkenny would be laid off Oct. 12.
   Steve Lightfoot, a 12-year employee who works in the shipping
section at New Cumberland, said the layoffs are ``a sore subject
everywhere.''
   With the Middle East crisis, the work load is increasing, ``but
morale is so far down because they know they're losing their jobs
and it's hard to do the job,'' said Lightfoot, not among those who
have received pink slips.
   Some employees facing layoffs are working hard but others
aren't, he said.
   Joseph said the reductions were based on assumptions and budget
decisions before the Iraqi invasion.
   ``This action in the desert changed all that,'' he said. ``The
Department of the Army is looking at how to fix that ... I
personally hope they do change it.''
   New Cumberland, an 850-acre base across the Susquehanna River
from the state capital, supplies 88 percent of the goods the Army
ships to overseas posts. Its $3.5 billion inventory includes
307,569 items ranging from clothing to spare parts and tools.
   The items are loaded onto trucks for shipment to ports in
Baltimore or Bayonne, N.J., or to Air Force bases at Dover, Del.
and other East Coast locations.
   At the 19,000-acre Letterkenny depot, four shipping crews of
four to five people work shifts of about 12 hours moving ammunition
to Desert Shield and other units. About 15 truckloads a day have
been going out since early August, said Frank Van Hatten, director
of ammunition operations.
   The depot stores ammunition ranging from small arms bullets to
2,000-pound bombs and some conventionally armed missiles in 902
earth-covered igloos and 10 warehouses.
   Workers were loading boxes of .50-caliber bullets and smoke
grenades from one igloo as reporters watched.
   Van Hatten said about 1 percent of the depot's ammunition stock
has been drawn down since the American force was deployed to Saudi
Arabia.
   At a truck painting and rehabilitation building, workers were
putting tan paint on military vehicles. Gordon said they've run out
of desert sand color and are getting low on tan as well.

<HEAD>Saddam Must Die, Former Israeli Intelligence Chief Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES RICHARDS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel's former spy chief said Wednesday that
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein must die, for the sake of Arabs as
well as Jews.
   ``For the survival of all the Arab states, Saddam Hussein has to
be destroyed ... Someone has to find him in his bunker and kill
him,'' Maj. Gen. Shlomo Gazit told delegates at the biennial
convention of B'Nai B'rith International in Dallas.
   ``If Saddam Hussein is not destroyed, he definitely will
continue with his nuclear armament goal,'' he said. ``It has to be
done only by the Iraqis themselves, and I'm not sure they are ripe
enough, mature enough to do it.''
   Gazit, who headed Israeli military intelligence in the 1970s,
voiced the concerns of many Israelis that Saddam could turn the
Arab-Iraq conflict into an Arab-Israeli conflict. Another worry is
the survival of Jordan's King Hussein, a moderate in terms of
Israeli-Arab politics.
   ``If this conflict is not resolved quickly, this could mean the
end of King Hussein's reign in Jordan,'' Gazit said. He spoke
during a panel discussion during the convention of the world's
largest Jewish organizaiton.
   Seymour Reich, president of the Conference of Presidents of
Major Jewish-American Organizations, said Jewish leaders in the
United States are solidly behind President Bush's deployment of
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf, even though it means U.S. forces
are protecting an Arab country.
   ``We believe it is essential that the governments of Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait be maintained, and we told President Bush we
fully support the actions he has taken,'' Reich said in an
interview.

   Rescuers on Wednesday searched a
tornado-devastated swath of northern Illinois for the missing and
the dead, while folks began salvaging belongings from homes the
twisters shredded ``like an eggbeater.''
   At least 24 people died and more than 300 were injured Tuesday
by the tornadoes, which steamrolled across a region known as
``Tornado Alley,'' about 35 miles southwest of Chicago.
   Scores of people were left homeless. Others spent the day
cleaning their yards, hammering on temporary roofs, sifting through
rubble, piling up belongings in pickup trucks lining the streets in
neighboring Plainfield. Offers of aid have poured in, including one
from the Soviet embassy in Washington.
   Theresa Rabaduex, a 23-year-old school bus driver who lived in a
complex ripped apart by the storm in Crest Hill, said tenants in
her building were being moved to free lodging ``but that doesn't do
you any good if you don't have any of your things. I don't even
have a bed.''
   She walked through the debris, trying to find her three black
cats. ``That's all that really matters to me,'' she said.
   ``It was like an eggbeater went through the inside of the
house,'' Bruce Marshall said as he tried to fashion a makeshift
cover for his roofless home in neighboring Plainfield.
   The storms struck virtually without warning Tuesday afternoon
along an eight-mile path. Hit hardest were the small towns of Crest
Hill and Plainfield. Portions of Joliet also were damaged,
including a new subdivision of houses torn down to their
foundations just a few months after they were built.
   Gov. James R. Thompson said he's seen a lot of disasters during
14 years in office, but ``nothing in my personal experience ...
compares with this.''
   ``Anything that is still standing is pure luck,'' he said after
touring the stricken area Wednesday.
   ``All I can say is thank God the death toll is not in the
hundreds. We are very, very lucky.''
   President Bush declared the region a disaster area. The Soviet
officials called the governor's office seeking information on how
to help, Thompson said.
   Illinois will provide at least $25 million in state deposits for
low-interest loans to tornado victims, said state Treasurer Jerry
Cosentino.
   There were 24 fatalities confirmed Wednesday, and toll could
reach 30 dead, said John Plunk, acting director of the Illinois
Emergency Services and Disaster Agency. Officials said another
Plainfield man died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator
he used when power was lost in his home.
   More than 300 people were treated at hospitals, and authorities
said more than 70 remained hospitalized Wednesday. At least 11 of
them were listed in critical condition.
   Wednesday's weather, sunny and cool, gave the area some relief,
and the forecast called for fair skies the rest of the week.
   National Guardsmen in Crest Hill used dogs, foot patrols and
infrared photography to search for more victims in a muddy corn
field, but found none. Six people were believed missing from a
seven-building apartment complex next to the field.
   The infrared scan from a helicopter was intended to detect
differences in temperature that might lead them to victims.
   At least nine of the storm's deaths occurred near the
apartments, where some victims were blown 400 feet out of the
building, said Chief Dave Martis of the Lockport Fire District,
which includes Crest Hill.
   Downed power lines were scattered across several streets and
nearly 7,000 customers remained without power Wednesday in Joliet,
Plainfield and the Aurora area.
   The smell of fresh wood permeated the air as residents used
chain saws to remove trees tossed like matchsticks across their
yards.
   ``I've got lots of family members helping, and some four or five
guys from surrounding towns,'' said Don Kinley, 53, of Plainfield,
who lost most of the second floor of his home.
   ``I don't know them _ they just want to help,'' said Kinley,
tears running down his cheeks.
   Mike Thomas, owner of a Naperville wiring company, said he
decided to take the day off to help Kinley and other people because
``They'd probably do it for me.''
   Night clothes hung from trees that had leaves ripped from
branches. Cars remained in front yards, where they were dumped by
the storms. A garbage bin was impaled high in a tree.
   Mike Dehler, a 26-year-old restaurant manager sifted through the
debris outside what used to be his third-floor apartment.
   ``There's my water bed,'' Dehler said, pointing to a deflated
silver mattress. ``Hopefully I'm going to find some clothes in
these dressers. All I have is what I have on.''

   Big Ben's bell is back in business, tolling the
hours as it has done for 131 years.
   The famous, booming tone of the 13{-ton bell resumed at 10 p.m.
Tuesday for the first time since March 26, the Department of the
Environment said.
   Inspectors found earlier this year that the hammer which strikes
the bell was suffering metal fatigue, so repairs were made.
   Big Ben, named after Sir Bejamin Hall, a government works
commissioner, first sounded May 31, 1859. It is normally silenced
twice a year when the hands of the four-faced clock are moved
foward in the spring for daylight savings time and back again in
the fall.
   Big Ben properly is the name of the bell, but it has become the
nickname for the entire 20-story tower of the Houses of Parliament.

   A young man who calls himself a pornographic

   Michael Kelly, 20, was charged with second-degree murder,
first-degree robbery and criminal possession of a weapon in the

   The officer accused Kelly of robbing Frank, an acquaintance, of
an undetermined amount of money and killing him in Frank's

   At the time of his arrest Tuesday, Kelly identified himself as a

   An electrical fire beneath the 45-story New York
Hilton led to the voluntary evacuation of 1,000 people Wednesday,
interrupted business meetings and snarled rush-hour traffic.
   No injuries were reported.
   Hilton spokeswoman Lola Preiss said the hotel has 2,039 rooms,
but she didn't know how many were occupied because the hotel
computers were down after power was cut.
   Fire Lt. Jim Powell said the blaze, put out within two hours,
was confined to a switching room one level below the street.
   Guests were evacuated because the fire knocked out most of the
hotel's power, including air conditioning and lights, authorities
said.
   The blackout lasted from 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
   ``We're telling the occupants of the building that there is no
danger; if they want to leave, they can,'' said Assistant Fire
Chief Matthew Murtaugh of Manhattan Central Command. An emergency
generator kept one elevator running.
   It wasn't clear how many guests decided to stay.
   The lobby was filled with the acrid smell of burning electrical
cable.
   The fire was contained to a room of electrical switching gear
and did not affect any transformers, so there was no danger of
released PCBs, said Fire Chief Ellsworth Hughes and Con Edison
spokeswoman Pat Richardi. PCBs are a toxic chemical formerly used
in some cooling and insulating applications.
   Hundreds of people lined the sidewalks outside the hotel on
Sixth Avenue between 53rd and 54th streets. Side streets around the
hotel were closed for most of the morning, and traffic slowed to a
crawl on Sixth Avenue.
   The Red Cross handed out beverages outside the hotel and Preiss
said flashlights were given to guests who chose to remain in their
rooms or lobby. She said the emergency generators provided dim
lighting, but not enough to read by.
   Among those who left the hotel was Bill McKay of Stamford,
Conn., who was having breakfast with colleagues in a lower level
restaurant, near the switching room, when the fire broke out.
   McKay heard two ``booms,'' about five seconds apart. The lights
flickered. Then smoke began to fill the area.
   As patrons made their way upstairs, ``We could barely see the
escalator,'' said McKay.
   ``We were wondering, `Are we going to get a free meal out of
this?' '' he joked.
   They did.

   Masked Mohawks on Wednesday helped soldiers tear
down barricades set up seven weeks ago to block the Mercier Bridge
to the island of Montreal, avoiding a bloody confrontation.
   But other Mohawks said the dispute remains unsettled and
barricades will stay up at nearby Oka.
   After a meeting in front of one barricade leading to the
community of Chateauguay and the Kahnawake reservation, army
officers and unarmed members of the Mohawks' Warriors Society began
tearing down the Mercier Bridge barrier with heavy equipment.
   They then began dismantling a barricade near Chateauguay on a
highway blocked since July 11, when Mohawks at Oka fought a gun
battle with provincial police in a dispute over land the community
of Oka earmarked as a golf course. The Indians said it was
ancestral land.
   A police officer was killed. Responsibility in the death has not
been fixed.
   Other Indians shut down Mercier Bridge in sympathy with the Oka
natives, infuriating commuters and local businesses and leading to
outbreaks of violence. The bridge blockade has meant long commuting
hours for residents across the St. Lawrence River from Montreal.
   Residents had thrown rocks and bricks at police who responded
with tear gas. On Tuesday, they hurled stones and bottles at cars
full of Mohawks leaving the reservation in anticipation of a
confrontation between Warriors and soldiers.
   Dan David, a Mohawk spokesman at the Kahnesatake community in
Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal, said the barricades there will
remain. He said the agreement in Kahnawake affects only that
reservation.
   ``This place holds the key to everything,'' David said.
``Everybody knows this is where everything started and this is
where everything must end.''
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney cautioned at Meech Lake, Quebec,
after an inner Cabinet meeting: ``It's an encouraging sign but the
problem is not solved yet. Hopefully that . . . very positive
attitude will be contagious.''
   Native leaders applauded Wednesday's developments.
   In Winnipeg, Phil Fontaine, leader of the Assembly of Manitoba
Chiefs, said ``We're really very pleased and relieved. The Mohawks
have done us proud.''
   Earlier Wednesday, trucks, front-end loaders and two armored
personnel carriers moved toward Mohawk barricades near the bridge.
Reports said a government ultimatum to Indian negotiators warned:
settle or face army guns.
   A Mohawk spokesman, Jack LeClaire, said Wednesday at one
barricade, ``The decision was taken to avoid bloodshed. We have
reached an honorable settlement between the military and the
community of Kahnawake.''
   Kahnawake leaders were negotiating with army and government
representatives when news came that the barricades at the bridge
were being destroyed.
   Just before dismantling began, two soldiers got out of a truck,
advanced to the barricade, went behind and emerged with two masked
members of the Mohawk Warriors group.
   A Mohawk in civilian clothes operated a mechanical shovel one
side of the barricade while two army bulldozers worked on the other
side to bring it down. About 20 masked but unarmed Warriors helped
with the dismantling.
   At the same time, the army began filling in a large trench in
front of the barricades.
   LeClaire said, ``The bridge will be inspected. If the Quebec
Department of Transport says it is passable, we hope it will be
open by the weekend.''

   More than 100 supporters of ousted
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto have been arrested in the latest
crackdown against ethnic violence in her home province, police said
Wednesday.
   A Moslem leader said he will join forces with the ousted leader
to compete in October elections and fight a mounting

   A week of raids across southern Sindh Province began after Aug.
22-23 sniper shootings in Karachi killed at least 31 people, police
said.
   The military-backed caretaker government that replaced Ms.
Bhutto's government three weeks ago blamed her Pakistan People's
Party for the attacks. It has not provided proof of the allegations.
   Ms. Bhutto's supporters say many People's Party activists,
including members of the former Sindh provincial government, have
gone into hiding.
   The former prime minister has accused the caretaker government
of trying to force her out of politics before the Oct. 24 general
elections. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto and her
government Aug. 6, citing a variety of charges that included
inability to curb ethnic violence in Sindh.
   More than 500 people have been killed since late May in gang
warfare between native Sindhis belonging to the People's Party and
members of the militant Mohajir Qami Movement, or Refugee People's
Movement. The army has been called out to restore peace and
maintain order.
   The Mohajir Movement represents Moslem Indians who immigrated to
Pakistan following the 1947 partition that ended British colonial
rule of the subcontinent. It aligned itself with the People's Party
in the November 1988 elections and helped Ms. Bhutto become prime
minister. But Mohajir members withdrew their support a year later,
claiming Ms. Bhutto had reneged on a variety of promises.
   In Islamabad on Wednesday, Malik Qasim, head of a small renegade
faction of the conservative Pakistan Moslem League, said, ``There
is a dangerous polarization taking shape in the country.''
   While opposing Ms. Bhutto on many ideological points, Qasim said
he would ally his small faction with Ms. Bhutto's left-of-center
People's Party in order to see that she gets a fair chance in the
elections.
   He said the caretaker government is ``based on partisanship.''
   Many analysts say the military could seize power during the
political uncertainty. The military had ruled for 25 of Pakistan's
43-year history.
   Qasim also questioned judicial tribunals set up last weekend to
investigate charges of widespread corruption under Ms. Bhutto.
   Ms. Bhutto has said she will boycott the tribunals and accused
her successors of launching a witch hunt against her party and her
husband, Asif Ali Zardari.
   Qasim said the allegations cited to justify Ms. Bhutto's
dismissal could apply to her opponents, some of whom now sit in the
caretaker government.
   ``This caretaker government cannot run fair elections,'' he said.

   The West African force sent to
Liberia to end the 8-month-old civil war there appealed Wednesday
to international donors to send food and medicine to help the
residents of Monrovia.
   The Ghana News Agency, which has a reporter with the 3,000
soldiers of the five-nation force, said its commanders also want to
restore electricity, water and communications to the Liberian
capital.
   Troops from Ghana, Nigeria, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Gambia
landed in Monrovia on Friday. They have been welcomed by President
Samuel Doe and the rebel group led by Prince Johnson, who together
control most of Monrovia.
   The biggest rebel force, led by Charles Taylor, has attacked the
West African troops, but so far have been outgunned and driven off,
the Ghana said.
   Taylor, whose forces control most of Liberia, opposes the West
African intervention and accuses Nigeria and Guinea of supporting
the embattled Doe.
   Monrovia has been without basic services and cut off from
deliveries of food and other supplies since rebels surrounded the
capital more than two months ago.
   The task force commanders urged donors to contact
representatives of the 16-nation Economic Community of West African
States to offer aid.
   The civil war has left 5,000 people dead, mainly civilians
slaughtered for their tribal affiliations. The war began in
December when Taylor's forces invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast,
accusing Doe of corruption and mismanagement. Johnson later split
with Taylor.
   About 400,000 Liberians from the nation of 2.3 million people
have fled to neighboring countries to escape the fighting.

   Mohawk Warriors at Oka were waiting behind a
barricade with automatic rifles on Wednesday for a confrontation
that didn't take place.
   An electric surge raced through the scene as word spread that
the army had set a 2 p.m. deadline for a signed agreement or an
assault at the Mercier Bridge farther down the St. Lawrence, south
of Montreal.
   A masked member of the Mohawk Warrior Society puffed up the
blacktop road to the barricade of logs and wrecked car bodies to
spread the word and alert the Indian forces facing the Canadian
army 325 feet farther down the hill.
   ``Shake ratttle and roll,'' muttered one of the men on the
barricade, armed with an automatic weapon.
   Moments later, Mohawk spokeswoman Kahn-Tineta Horn drove up to
brief a band of reporters with what she said was information from
secret, last-ditch talks at a suburban Montreal hotel. An army
officer had interrupted the talks and announced the deadline, she
said.
   ``It appears the army and (the provincial police) have gone out
of control,'' she said, adding that a human rights observer was
working to get the assault called off.
   A gray-haired Indian in a camouflage poncho pulled up in a golf
cart.
   ``Don't do nothin' drastic,'' he told the fighters who huddled
around him. ``You've all got minds of your own.''
   Two o'clock passed with no word of an assault. Three o'clock.
Three-thirty.
   ``We're going to be here when they get here,'' said a Mohawk
Warrior who calls himself Hunter.
   ``We're not going to fire first.''
   Hunter is a 20-year-old American Mohawk, a former student at the
University of Minnesota.
   What will he do if the army rolls up and starts pushing down the
barricade with tanks fitted with bulldozer blades?
   ``It's going to be decided on the spot, the decision on how we
react,'' he said.
   The army said it would not shoot first. The Mohawks, who first
threw up a barricade March 11 and repulsed an assault by the
provincial police on July 11, said they would not shoot first.
   So what would happen if the army marched up the hill, not
shooting, and that barricade suddenly started moving backward?
   ``That's gonna be wild, huh?'' said a Warrior known as Black
Jack, smiling.
   ``A bulldozer? Then we'll have to put a bulldozer on them,
right? You can't give up.''
   The original dispute at Oka over the proposed expansion of a
golf course onto land claimed by the Indians was solved. The
federal government bought the land and is ready to turn it over to
the Mohawks.
   But the standoff, now seven weeks old, has gone far beyond a
mere golf course in this tranquil village along the shores of the
St. Lawrence River. The Indians seized the occasion, and public
attention, to air the whole range of their grievances.
   The situation at Oka was less dramatic than at the Mercier
bridge near Chateauguay, where thousands of suburbanites have been
cut off from their jobs in Montreal, forced to make long detours to
get into the island city.
   There, anger rose steadily and the considerable capital of
public sympathy for the Mohawks and their cause burned up fast,
leading to numerous violent incidents.
   Down the hill, the army waited. And waited.
   ``All is calm,'' said a corporal on the forward-most army
sandbag bunker. ``We're just waiting. We're just like you, watching
the television.''
   ``It's long,'' said another soldier. ``Waiting for something.''
   Will they really attack?
   ``It's hard to believe. I'm just waiting for something here,''
he said, picking up up a radio handset.
   Capt. Yvon Desjardins, army spokesman in the Oka area, said that
after the order from Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa to tear down
the barricades, the army continued to patrol and carry out aerial
surveillance.
   Oka is nearly a ghost town. A few residents remain, but not many.
   ``That's gonna be wild, huh?'' another Warrior known as Black
Jack said, smiling.
   ``A bulldozer? Then we'll have to put a bulldozer on them,
right? You can't give up.''
   Black Jack, wearing fatigues, a baseball cap and peering through
blue sunglasses, didn't look too worried about imminent danger.
   ``We're a military force,'' he said, ``not a bunch of
terrorists. We're here until the final minute.
   ``The women are strong. They'll be here (when the assault
comes). If the men get shot, we die here, the women will pick up
the guns. The women are warriors, too.''
   But as the day wore on, there was no sign of army movement
against the Mohawks at Oka. The warriors at the barricade sat back
and sipped cold Pepsis.
   ``We're just waiting.''

<TEXT>
   A U.S. master sergeant on trial for
killing a Panamanian prisoner shot when the prisoner made a
threatening gesture, a medic testified Wednesday.
   Army prosecutors rested their case in the court-martial of
Master Sgt. Roberto Bryan, 42, who is charged with unpremeditated
murder and could face life in prison if convicted.
   The Army alleges that Bryan, a 19-year veteran member of the
82nd Airborne Division, shot the Panamanian without provocation on
Dec. 23, 1989 _ three days after the United States invaded to oust
Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega.
   Bryan led troops who stopped five Panamanians at a roadblock.
The Panamanians were being searched when a grenade exploded,
wounding 10 American soldiers. The soldiers opened fire, killing
four of the Panamanians.
   The fifth man was injured and lying on the ground when Bryan
shot and killed him. Testimony in the case has centered on whether
Bryan had good reason to do so.
   Staff Sgt. James Miller, a medic, testified Wednesday that he
was caring for an injured U.S. soldier in the area and saw the
surviving Panamanian making a motion. Miller said there were
several grenades lying in the area.
   ``I perceived it as a threat,'' Miller said. He was unarmed at
the time and yelled that the man was alive.
   Miller said Bryan ``identified what I was pointing at, raised
his weapon and fired. Just perfect infantry skills. Just textbook.''
   Several soldiers have testified that Bryan didn't get along with
Lt. Brandon Thomas, the Army's chief witness, who helped bring
charges against Bryan.
   Thomas testified Tuesday that he was stationed elsewhere when
the gun battle broke out and drove to the area in time to see Bryan
shoot the injured Panamanian.
   He said he approached Bryan, grabbed his M-16 rifle and said,
``What the hell are you doing? He was almost dead anyway. You
didn't have to empty a magazine (row of bullets) into him.''
   Bryan stepped back with a startled look on his face and said,
``He injured my people,'' Thomas testified.
   An eight-member military panel is hearing the case in a tiny
base courtroom.
   Two soldiers have testifed that a civilian told them a day
before the shooting that his yellow Daihatsu four-wheel drive
vehicle had been stolen. The five Panamanians were driving such a
car, and the soldiers said they believed the men to be
non-uniformed members of the Panamanian Defense Force.
   The military has never identified the Panamanian whom Bryan
killed; no forensic inspection was done.

   A cult leader was convicted Wednesday
of killing a family of five and burying them on a farm where his
group lived, and his wife was sentenced to life in prison for her
role.
   A Lake County Common Pleas Court jury deliberated a little more
than three hours before convicting Jeffrey Lundgren, 40, of five
counts each of aggravated murder and kidnapping. He could be
sentenced to death.
   He showed no emotion when the verdict was read by Judge Martin
O. Parks.
   Earlier in the same courthouse, Lundgren's wife, Alice, 39, was
sentenced to five consecutive life terms. She was convicted Aug. 1
on five counts each of conspiracy and complicity to commit
aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping.
   Defense lawyers admitted that Lundgren shot Dennis Avery; his
wife, Cheryl, and three daughters ages 7, 13 and 15.
   Each victim was lured to a barn in April 1989 at the Lundgrens'
rented farm in Kirtland, 30 miles east of Cleveland, and gagged,
shot and dumped in a common grave.
   Authorities searching the barn found the bodies in January.
   The Lundgrens' 19-year-old son, Damon, also was among 13 cult
members arrested early this year. His trial on the same charges as
his father is pending.
   Five other cult members have pleaded guilty and are awaiting
sentencing, and five more are awaiting trials.
   Lundgren had been a lay minister in Kirtland for the Reorganized
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He was defrocked in
1988 for inappropriate conduct and later founded his own sect.
   Parks set a sentencing hearing for Sept. 10. Jurors are to
consider which of three sentences to recommend to the judge: life
in prison with parole eligibility after 20 years, life with parole
eligibility after 30 years, or death.
   Prosecutor Steven LaTourette said he expected the verdict.
   He noted that Lundgren appeared calm when the verdict was read.
   ``I noticed Mr. Lundgren was smiling _ sort of a
day-at-the-beach attitude,'' he said.
   Lundgren did not comment on the verdict. Authorities led him out
of the courtroom.
   Defense lawyer Charles Grieshammer said he was not surprised
with the verdict. He said he was looking forward to the hearing to
argue for a sentence other than the death penalty.
   ``Now it's time to move on to our part of the trial,'' he said.
   Lundgren did not testify, and defense lawyers did not call any
other witnesses.
   Mrs. Lundgren smiled an talked with her lawyers before her
sentencing and appeared quiet and still during the proceedings.
   After Mrs. Lundgren was sentenced, she read a statement to
reporters criticizing the prosecution's portrayal of her as cold
and an active player in the killings.
   Instead, she said she was abused by her husband and stayed with
the group out of fear for herself and her children.
   ``I'm not a coldblooded murderer. He is,'' she said, referring
to her husband.
   ``I, too, was numbered on the list (of intended victims). I am
not the `Angel of Death.' I am the mother of four. ... I was found
guilty of a crime I had no knowledge would occur,'' said Mrs.
Lundgren. She testified she was not at the farm when the Averys
were killed.
   Other cult members testified that Mrs. Lundgren attended regular
prayer meetings at which the pending murders were discussed.
Testimony also indicated she prepared a final meal for the victims
and looked through their belongings to see what might be taken.
   The cult members left the Kirtland farmers shortly after the
murders for wildness homes in West Virginia and Missouri. The
Lundgrens were arrested in January in a motel near San Diego.

<TEXT>
   Edmund North, the Oscar-winning
co-author of ``Patton'' and a lifelong crusader for the Writers
Guild of America, has died from complications following surgery. He
was 79.
   North died Tuesday at St. John's Hospital and Health Center,
said guild spokeswoman Cheryl Rhoden.
   With James Gow, North wrote his first movie, ``One Night of
Love'' starring Grace Moore, at the age of 21. It was voted one of
the best-written films of the year by the newly former Screen
Writers Guild, a union with which North would have a productive
relationship.
   In a career spanning 60 years, his credits included ``The Day
the Earth Stood Still,'' ``Sink the Bismarck,'' ``Cowboy,'' ``Young
Man With a Horn'' and ``Damn the Defiant.''
   Born in New York City to stage performers Robert North and
Stella Maury, North's first writing jobs were at Fox and RKO. His
early films were ``I Dream Too Much'' with Henry Fonda and Lucille
Ball; ``All the King's Horses,'' ``Murder on a Bridle Path,''
``Bunker Bean'' and ``I'm Still Alive.''
   He served in the signal corps in World War II.
   Upon his return to Hollywood, North was president of the guild's
screen branch, president of the pension fund and frequently
chairman of the contract negotiating committee. In all, he served
on more than 40 guild committees.
   ``For many of us, Eddie was the guild, the most beloved of all
our members,'' said David Rintels, a former president of the WGA
West. ``He was the fairest-minded man I ever met. A man of great,
old-fashioned virtues.''
   North's other film credits include ``Dishonored Lady,''
``Flamingo Road'' (dialogue only), ``Colorado Territory,'' ``In a
Lonely Place,'' ``Only the Valiant,'' ``The Outcasts of Poker
Flat,'' ``Destry,'' ``The Far Horizons,'' ``The Proud Ones'' and
``The Fiercest Heart.''
   In 1982, North wrote and produced ``Race to Oblivion,'' an
anti-war film made for Physicians for Social Responsibility. He
also served on the board for the National Captioning Institute, a
group created in 1979 to provide closed captioning for television
programs.
   North co-wrote 1970's ``Patton'' with Francis Ford Coppola.
Starring George C. Scott as the flamboyant World War II general,
the film won Oscars for best picture, best actor for Scott, best
director for Franklin Schaffner and best script.
   North is survived by his wife Collette, daughters Bobbie and
Susan and two grandchildren.
   A memorial service is pending.

   A man with a shotgun killed five people
Thursday in an apartment building, police said. A suspect
surrendered after buying cigarettes and a soft drink at a nearby
store.
   A police spokesman said four victims were killed instantly in a
public housing building in the Sydney neighborhood of Surry Hills.
The fifth died after being taken to a hospital.
   All five were believed to be residents of three apartments in
the building. Police Executive Chief Superintendent Alf Peat said
it appeared the gunman, in his early 30s, had walked into the
building and killed a young woman relative.
   The man then turned his shotgun on other residents, firing
indiscriminately, Peat said.
   Neighbor Annette McDonald said she heard three or four shots as
she was walking out of her apartment. ``It was just the shots _ no
screaming, no arguing,'' she said.
   Police received the emergency call around 9 a.m. Ambulance
station officer George Smith said he found three men and two women
lying on the ground and first floors of the building.
   Four were already dead from single gunshot wounds to the head,
Smith said. The fifth was unconscious with head wounds.
   Don Bryson, storekeeper at a local grocery store, said a young
man who appeared ``really nervous'' came in the shop just after a
resident mentioned the shootings.
   Bryson said the man bought cigarettes and a soft drink before
leaving the store and walking to police cars, which had just
arrived.
   A police spokesman said on condition of anonymity that the man
was taken into police custody. He was not identified.

   A navy tribunal fined and revoked
the license of the owners of a cruise boat that sank on New Year's
Eve in 1988, killing 55 people.
   The tribunal ruled the Bateau Mouche Rio Turismo Ltda. company
was negligent in operating the boat, which was overloaded and in
open sea when it sank. The flat-bottomed boat was licensed to
operate only in Rio's Guanabara Bay.
   The Bateau Mouche IV, with a capacity of 62 passengers, was
carrying about 150 revelers when it sank in 65 feet of water
minutes before midnight on Dec. 31, 1988.
   The company was banned from all maritime activity and ordered to
pay $1,320 in fines. Mechanic Edson Goncalves de Carvalho,
responsible for the boat's pumps, was fined $130 and lost his
ship's pilot license.
   Charges were filed against six navy officers and two sergeants
for ``negligence and laziness'' in inspecting the boat.

   The Supreme Court on Wednesday found
former President Leon Febres Cordero innocent of embezzling
$150,000 in public funds, ending a dramatic case that riveted
Ecuadoreans.
   Febres Cordero had no immediate reaction. However, he has denied
the accusation in the past, saying he is the victim of political
enemies who want to smear his reputation.
   ``Since the crime of embezzlement was not proved, the case is
declared closed,'' Justice Jorge Gonzalez told a news conference
Wednesday.
   The charge, leveled in January, accused Febres Cordero of
embezzling $150,000, stunning this small Andean nation of 10
million people.
   It dates back to Febres Cordero's actions in 1987, when his
private secretary and son-in-law Miguel Orellana received $150,000
in cash from Ecuador's Central Bank. Orellana later said the money
was used to pay an Israeli anti-terrorism expert for advice in
fighting a small leftist guerrilla group.
   Febres Cordero said the case against Orellana was meant to
embarrass him politically and assumed responsibility for the
spending of the money.
   The judge said Wednesday's ruling cleared both Febres Cordero
and his son-in law. ``We consider them both innocent,'' Gonzalez
said.
   He said the ruling cannot be appealed.
   Febres Cordero, a 59-year old archconservative with a fiery
temper, governed from 1984 to 1988. He was regarded as a favorite
of the Reagan administration because of his outspoken defense of
free-market economic policies.
   President Rodrigo Borja, a moderate leftist and bitter foe of
Febres Cordero, had said he did not believe the money was paid to
an Israeli anti-terrorism specialist.
   For his part, Febres Cordero accused Borja and Osvaldo Hurtado,
another former president, of being behind the embezzlement charge.
   Borja denied his government was involved. He said it was a
judicial case.

   Plans for a new U.S. sale of weapons to Saudi
Arabia were revealed Tuesday, as congressional leaders expressed
support _ at least for now _ of the Bush administration's
intervention in the Middle East.
   The United States intends to sell nearly $3 billion in new
weapons to Saudi Arabia, including 24 F-15 fighter planes and 150
M-60 tanks, congressional sources said.
   The administration notified Congress of the plans as about 170
lawmakers returned from a summer break for their first face-to-face
briefing from President Bush since he began sending troops to the
Persian Gulf three weeks ago.
   ``So far, so good,'' said House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., reflecting near unanimous congressional backing
for the military moves and wariness about the future.
   ``There is a sense of awe at how brilliantly Bush has handled
this,'' said House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.
   Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., the third-ranking House leader, said
the nation will continue to support the presence of U.S. troops in
Saudi Arabia ``provided we do not get into a protracted struggle
with loss of life, with no prospect for victory.''
   ``I am convinced that no matter how this ends, we will have an
added presence there for a long time, and I think the American
people need to be made aware of that,'' said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis.
   During the hour-long meeting other lawmakers said they expressed
concern that the nation lacks an energy policy to cope with oil
shortages. Some also said U.S. allies must bear a bigger share of
the military and financial burden in deterring Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   The Saudi military sale would include 15,000 rounds of depleted
uranium antitank ammunition and 200 stinger antiaircraft missiles.
Those items cannot be sold to Riyadh unless Bush certifies it is in
America's national security interest.
   The arms package is designed to bolster Saudi defenses against
neighboring Iraq and further sales are possible, said the sources,
who requested anonymity.
   Those sources did not detail what the future possibilities are.
The Washington Post said in Wednesday editions that a second sale
of 24 F-15s was planned for 1991. The 48 additional F-15s would
bring the total sold to Saudi Arabia to 110 compared with the
current congressionally imposed limit of 62.
   Saudi Arabia has welcomed Bush's troop deployment and has agreed
to increase oil production to help offset losses from Iraqi oil
fields.
   In opening remarks to about 170 members of Congress who returned
to Washington from their summer recess for the briefing, Bush
appealed for support and added: ``Let no one at home doubt my
commitment to work with the Congress, and let no one abroad doubt
our national unity or our staying power.''
   Bush also said Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait. But he did not
publicly address a question on the minds of some lawmakers _
whether Hussein himself must be deposed.
   In advance of the White House briefing, Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., said that was a clear requirement for settling the crisis.
   Lugar, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, also said
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has demonstrated the United States is the
world's lone remaining superpower with the military and political
clout to find a solution. He also urged President Bush to spell out
the costs of what could be a long-term military commitment.
   Military force probably will be needed to force Saddam from
power, Lugar said. ``He does have to leave the leadership of the
country, and many of the forces he has aggregated have to be
removed as a threat,'' he said.
   Bush met briefly first with a group that included Sen. George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash.,
Gephardt, and Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill. That was
followed by a briefing for other members of Congress, including
those on the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and
Appropriations committees.
   Also briefing the members were Defense Secretary Dick Cheney,
CIA Director William Webster, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
_ who cut short a Wyoming vacation _ and Joint Chiefs of Staff
Chairman Colin Powell.
   Afterward, Gephardt said the increased cost of the deployment _
$2.5 billion through September, and possible more for a longer stay
_ will affect budget talks between Congress and the White House.
The first-year savings target of $50 billion may have to be scaled
back to $35 billion or so, but the overall five-year total savings
should still reach the original $500 billion goal, he said.
   Two separate bipartisan congressional delegations, one from the
House led by Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and one from
the Senate led by Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committe, will leave Friday on an inspection trip
to Saudi Arabia, returning Monday.

   Vice President Dan Quayle's wife,
Marilyn, fell into the Colorado River during during a whitewater
rafting expedition through the Grand Canyon over the weekend, a
park spokesman said Wednesday.
   She was thrown from the raft when it hit Lava Falls rapids, one
of the roughest stretches in the river, said Chuck Lundy, spokesman
for Grand Canyon National Park.
   John Reed, assistant superintendent for the park, pulled Mrs.
Quayle back into the raft, Lundy said, adding that she was
uninjured and was wearing a life jacket at the time as required.
   The Quayles were accompanying a U.S. Park Service patrol on a
rafting expedition of several days, said Lundy, who didn't know if
the mishap occurred Saturday or Sunday.
   Lava Falls is about 60 miles west of park headquarters here.
   Lundy said there were about four or five rafts on the trip.

   A crew resumed work Wednesday on an access
road to the site for the University of Arizona's Mount Graham
observatory, after a federal judge rejected environmentalists'
pleas to stop the project.
   The National Audubon Society called on Arizona's congressmen to
halt work on the $200 million telescopes until a new biological
study can be conducted of its effects on the endangered Mount
Graham red squirrel.
   A contracting firm, which last summer began building the
two-mile access road on Emerald Peak, resumed work on the final 200
feet of the road Wednesday.
   A university crew on Thursday was to begin transplanting several
hundred tiny trees from the construction site on the 10,500-foot
peak, said university spokesman Steve Emerine. Later, larger spruce
and fir trees will be cleared from the site.
   The site to be cleared will be used for the German Max Planck
Institute's Sub-Millimeter Telescope, the first of three telescopes
to be built in the Mount Graham forest.
   Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Alfredo C. Marquez refused to issue
a temporary restraining order to halt the project.
   Chuck Stury, the Forest Service manager for the telescope
project, said Friends of the Earth had requested a group camping
permit for 50 people from Friday to Monday near the observatory
site, and he hoped there wouldn't be trouble.
   ``I thought maybe there'd be a protest or something going on; I
haven't heard of anything,'' he said.
   Six women calling themselves Wrathful and Outraged Mothers for
Biodiversity (WOMB) staged a theatrical demonstration at the Tucson
office of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. They carried basketballs under
their clothing to give the appearance of pregnancy _ the symbolic
result, they said, of the federal rape of the environment.

<TEXT>
   The killings of five people in
Gainesville this week evoked memories of another Florida campus
nightmare _ the fatal bludgeoning of two sorority sisters by serial
killer Ted Bundy 12 years ago.
   ``Everybody knows that it happened here,'' Kim Ewing, a
sophomore at Florida State University, said Tuesday. ``It's kind of
the first thing you associate with killings like this.''
   This week's killings occurred near the University of Florida
campus about 2{ hours to the southeast.
   A chill swept through the state capital when Margaret Bowman and
Lisa Levy were found slain on Jan. 15, 1978, at the Chi Omega
Sorority house. Three other women students were severely beaten
with an oak limb.
   Lt. Jack Handley of the Florida State University Police
Department, who was on the force when it happened, said people had
trouble accepting that such a crime happened in quiet Tallahassee.
   ``If you're looking for one way to describe it, I would say it
was total disbelief,'' Handley said. ``These things just are not
supposed to happen in a college community.''
   Bundy was executed in Florida's electric chair Jan. 24, 1989,
for the February 1978 killing of 12-year-old Kimberly Leach, who
was abducted in Lake City about a month after the Chi Omega murders.
   Crowds cheered outside the Florida State Prison when the switch
was thrown.
   Bundy also received the death penalty for the sorority slayings,
and authorities believe he was responsible for three dozen other
killings across the country.
   Diane Cossin, now an executive assistant to U.S. Attorney Dexter
Lehtinen in Miami, was a member of Chi Omega and was awakened by
the sounds of her two friends being killed. She comforted one of
the victims before she died and later was a witness at Bundy's
trial.
   ``What I remember was an enormous feeling of loss, of the
shattering of the safety you felt. It was like being in a crisis,''
she said. ``Fear is elevated. A great amount of anxiety was felt by
everyone.''
   Cossin had to put off law school while the trial was held, and
when she returned she decided to shift her focus from family to
criminal law. When Lehtinen was in the Florida Legislature, she
helped him draft legislation expanding rights of crime victims.
   ``I think it played a big part in what I do now. You can either
avoid something or you can get in there and try to do something
about it,'' she said.
   Rhonda Lee, a sophomore from Cape Coral, said the most
frightening thing about Bundy was his seeming normalcy. The
one-time law student was an intelligent, good-looking man few would
identify as a murderer.
   ``He looked like kind of a nice guy. He could be anybody you
might meet. He could be the guy across the hall or the guy next
door,'' she said.
   Security was beefed up Tuesday at Florida State and other state
college campuses.
   Handley said authorities had received dozens of calls from
parents and students worried that the Gainesville killer or killers
might come to Tallahassee.
   ``I'm trying to control the rumor factor, but people are very
concerned,'' he said. ``I've had quite a few mention Ted Bundy.''

   In a crowded refugee center, Ghulam Hussain
Ali thought about the job he lost in Kuwait and how he may support
his two sons if he returns to impoverished Pakistan.
   He raised his palms to Allah.
   ``Nobody here knows what he will do,'' said the 28-year-old
former port guard. ``There is no work. Too many people in
Pakistan.''
   Each day, Asian workers fleeing Kuwait and Iraq join thousands
already in the refugee centers, where Jordanian officials provide
limited services while urging governments to aid in repatriating
the often destitute and desperate people.
   Some officials estimate the potential Asian rufugee wave could
swell into the hundreds of thousands. About 250,000 foreigners,
including Arabs, have fled to Jordan since the Iraqi invasion of
neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``We expect an avalanche,'' said Sofi Ullah, the Bangladeshi
consul in Abu Dhabi who came to Jordan to supervise repatriation.
He said 600 were flown home and 9,000 remain. ``This is the best we
can do,'' he said.
   Most of the workers, who came to the Persian Gulf seeking better
jobs, fled nearly penniless with whatever they could grab: a small
radio, a few shirts, a Koran, a soup spoon.
   Egyptians and Sudanese are flown out directly from Aqaba,
Jordan, but Bangladeshis, Pakistanis, Indians, Sri Lankans, Thais,
Filipinos and Nepalese wait for word from their governments.
   Jordanian volunteer committees provide food, tents and basic
essentials.
   But a senior Jordanian official who spoke on condition of
anonymity stressed that resources are limited.
   ``No one will be allowed to stay in Jordan,'' he said. ``We
don't want to push governments, but we expect cooperation soon. We
will not allow a refugee problem here.''
   ``At the rate they are taking us home, it will be six months,''
said Mosharof Hussain Khan, a Bangladeshi refugee from Kuwait.
``After six months in this place, a man will die four times.''
   Khan sat on a mat among other refugees at an Amman exhibition
hall, forbidden to go outside because neighbors complained they
were begging and relieving themselves in public.
   ``We have 22,000 people living here, and toilets, maybe 10,''
Khan said. ``You can think about that.''
   Ullah said 70,000 Bangladeshis worked in Kuwait, with another
7,000 in Iraq.
   Khan and his friends assailed Bangladeshi authorities, saying a
consular officer visited the Amman International Fair camp but
refused to talk to anyone.
   ``One plane every other day, this is impossible,'' Mujibar
Rahman said.
   ``We have extremely limited resources,'' Ullah said. ``We wish
that some friendly country or charitable organization will make
available a Hercules (transport plane) or a jumbo (jet) or a ship
to help us.''
   At a separate center, nearly 5,000 Pakistanis await flights
home. More arrive than leave.
   Refugees sprawl listlessly on mats, wait in water lines or sit
and brood. At lunchtime, they stand hours in line for a piece of
bread, a tomato and a thin slice of salami.
   ``Everyone wants to do something good, but we don't know where
to start,'' said Hind Talib, a nurse who is helping with sanitation
at the center.
   Early on Tuesday, one Bangladeshi attacked another with an iron
bar in a quarrel over mattress space.
   Yet the refugees worry more about the future.
   At the Amman International Fair, a crowd of 40 Bangladeshis
gathered around a reporter who stopped to talk. One asked out loud
in Bengali if anyone had even a faint prospect for a job back home.
``No!'' all shouted in unison.
   Others, left with no choice, are calmer.
   Manop Kraiwan, a stocky Thai driver in an electric blue jogging
outfit, took in the scene with a stoic smile. He has been in Kuwait
almost five years supporting a young son he has never seen.
   ``I don't know where to look for work anymore,'' he said.
``Things change, but I'm trying.''

multinational force in the Persian Gulf:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   UNITED STATES: Officials say more than 100,000 troops, including
those aboard ships, are in the Persian Gulf region or on the way.
Deployments could go as high as 250,000. The troops include
elements of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, the 24th
Mechanized Infantry Division, the 11th Air Defense Artillery
Brigade and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment, and other units. They
also include a contingent of 45,000 Marines.
   The American fleet in the gulf and Arabian Sea waters
immediately outside it totals about 30 ships, including three
aircraft carriers, a battleship armed with Tomahawk cruise
missiles, more than a dozen missile cruisers, destroyers, supply
ships and an undisclosed number of submarines. Two hospital ships
are sailing for the gulf. Another seven ships are expected in the
Mediterranean.
   The Pentagon has also sent 22 Stealth fighter-bombers and dozens
of other aircraft.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BRITAIN: Has a flotilla permanently in the gulf and has
contributed three warships: a destroyer armed with Sea Dart
missiles and two Frigates armed with Exocet and Seawolf missiles.
They are accompanied in the Gulf by a Royal Fleet auxilliary
vessel. Soon to join them will be three Royal Fleet auxiliary
ships: one supply vessel, one fleet tanker and one forward supply
vessel.
   Three minesweepers and one support vessel are en route, but the
minesweepers are expected to stay in the eastern Mediterranean.
   Also dispatched were two squadrons of Tornadoes and one squadron
of Jaguar fighter-bombers. A squadron totals 12-16 planes. The F3
class Tornado fighter-interceptors is based in Saudi Arabia. The
Jaguars are at Thumrait airbase in neighboring Oman. The second
squadron of Tornadoes, which are IDS-type interdictor strike
planes, are expected to arrive within the week from a base in West
Germany. There are also three Nimrod maritime reconnaisance
aircraft stationed in Oman.

<HEAD>Venus Mapping Delayed Again by Magellan Trouble</HEAD>

   Magellan's mission to map Venus has been
delayed again, until late September, while NASA tries to figure out
why the spacecraft keeps losing touch with Earth.
   ``Have patience with us. We're going to make it work,'' Tony
Spear, Magellan project manager at the space agency's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, said Tuesday.
   Magellan's radio link to Earth failed for 14 hours starting Aug.
16 and for 17{ hours beginning Aug. 21, while the craft was in
orbit around Venus.
   Spear said he organized a team of 40 engineers from the lab and
from Martin Marietta Corp., which built Magellan in Denver, to
determine what is wrong with the spacecraft and fix it.
   Before Magellan started malfunctioning, NASA planned for it to
make pictures and maps of Venus on a regular basis starting
Saturday. Last week, Spear said engineers hoped to have Magellan
working properly by mid-September.
   Now, he said, ``We're targeting for the last week in September
to start mapping.''
   Mapping is being delayed not only to fix Magellan but also
because the craft's troubles have left engineers ``mentally and
physically exhausted,'' Spear said. ``We've decided to give the
team three days off around Labor Day.''
   Magellan's $744 million mission is to use radar to peer through
Venus' thick clouds and make the best pictures and maps yet of the
planet's surface. The spacecraft was launched from space shuttle
Atlantis in May 1989.
   Pictures made during an Aug. 16 test showed quake faults, vast
solidified lava flows, cinder cones, a lava-filled meteorite impact
crater and countless valleys and mountain ridges on Earth's nearest
planetary neighbor.
   Magellan functioned almost flawlessly during the 15 months it
traveled a looping, 948-million-mile route to Venus. One major
theory is that something went wrong when the craft went into orbit
around Venus on Aug. 10, Spear said.
   NASA also has been troubled by the temporary grounding of the
shuttle fleet and a focusing flaw on the Hubble Space Telescope.
   Spear said engineeers will try to determine if previously
unknown electrical fields or particles around Venus are disrupting
Magellan's electronics.
   The engineers will also examine a computer that ran amok during
the communications failures and look at changes in Magellan as it
went into orbit, including the possibility of short circuits.
   Spear ruled out the possibility, raised Friday, that Magellan's
braking rocket may have failed to separate from the spacecraft
after it went into orbit.

   A spokesman for Prince Turki bin Abdul
Aziz of Saudi Arabia would like you to know the prince is a fairly
regular guy.
   Even if he owns several homes and palaces, has a staff of 4,000
and belongs to the second-richest family in the world.
   With an entourage of nearly 100 people and a tractor-trailer
filled with luggage, that's a tough sell when you pull into a hotel
_ as the royal family did here four weeks ago _ at a cost of about
$10,000 a day.
   Fact and fantasy quickly become blurred.
   Take, for example, the story of a Cambridge police officer on
the special security detail who said that Turki ordered the air
conditioning turned off on the two floors he took over on arriving
at the Charles Hotel in Harvard Square.
   ``They like to keep it like it is in their country. All the cops
working up there are dying,'' said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``A kid told us they even had a space
heater up there.''
   For Mustapha Aziz, the prince's political adviser and spokesman,
the reaction is typical to princes from oil-rich nations such as
Saudi Arabia, under scrutiny since American and other troops were
sent there following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``No, the air-conditioning is not off,'' Aziz said. ``That kind
of stereotype is too much.
   ``Everyone thinks we are coming here with many wives, that kind
of thing. It does not apply to this family. ... He is out of that
picture of greedy princes.''
   Still, the 53-year-old prince's penchant for frequent travel and
long stays at expensive hotels is unusual.
   The youngest of King Fahd's six brothers, Turki has no business
dealings, lives off his inheritance and does largely philanthropic
work. He travels with a staff of 60 to 100, including seven cooks.
The costs of about 40 to 50 rooms at the Charles to house workers
and set up offices with facsimile machines, telephones and a
satellite dish may exceed $10,000.
   Aziz said that is not a big entourage for a member of the Fahd
family, which is worth $18 billion and is the second richest-family
in the world, according to Fortune magazine. ``We have three full
shifts,'' he said.
   Another police officer said the prince, who has his own security
detail, also hired two dozen Cambridge officers at $200 per day.
   ``That's for each man,'' said the officer, who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``And he's got about eight Harvard cops and
some other guys.''
   The officer said when the prince's 11-year-old son wanted to
play video games one day, he was escorted to an arcade by four
police officers.
   ``The kid had $300 in quarters with him,'' he added.
   Aziz could not confirm or deny those reports. Nor could he hide
his irritation.
   ``The prince does not like to show off. He gives hundreds of
donations every month, but he refuses to be identified as the man
who gave it. His is not the Trump style,'' said Aziz.
   Aziz said that had the Iraqi invasion not occurred, few would
have known he was in town to discuss contributions to Harvard and
have his three children get medical checkups.
   At a recent news conference to discuss events in the Mideast,
the prince was affable but unassuming. But the breakfast he offered
for reporters was certainly one befitting a prince.
   There was cheese _ brie, camembert, saga blue and port salut; a
dozen fruits; six fruit juices; smoked salmon with caviar; petit
filet mignon; Belgium waffles; poached eggs on pumpernickel muffin
with basil hollandaise; two preparation stations for egg dishes,
and a full Mideast menu.
   Waiters presented a long-stemmed red rose to each woman in
attendance. And it was all set off by 750 orchids.
   Like her husband, Princess Hend wore Western clothes.
   She made headlines years ago when she got in a melee with police
checking out reports of mistreatment of workers at the prince's
home in Florida. That's the house where the family created a stir
with a lavish birthday party for his son that included a cake
topped off with live flamingos.
   At one point in the news conference, the princess, whose English
is good, interrupted to say the translator had mangled the exchange
between a reporter and the prince. He tried again.
   ``Her royal highness is the type who likes to speak her mind.
Everyone in the media try to harm this image,'' said Aziz. ``She is
the type of woman for our future.''

   Members of Congress are praising President
Bush's handling so far of the Middle East crisis, but some who
interrupted their summer break for a presidential briefing are wary
about the future.
   ``I don't think there's a question of a blank check here'' for
the president, said House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. But
during an hour-long meeting Tuesday with Bush and top aides,
``there were really no overall reservations'' by the 170 or so
lawmakers present, he said.
   Both Democrats and Republicans were effusive about Bush's
diplomacy: the garnering of international support for an economic
boycott of Iraq, the winning of United Nations backing for military
enforcement of the blockade and his enlistment of Arab military
forces in the regional show of strength.
   ``For the moment, among professional politicians, there is a
sense of awe at how brilliantly Bush has handled this,'' said Rep.
Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House minority whip.

   The United States and the four other
permanent members of the Security Council want the United Nations
to run Cambodia until a new government is elected, but the warring
parties have yet to agree.
   The proposals adopted Tuesday by the five nations call for the
world body to ``supervise and control ... if necessary'' five key
Cambodian ministries _ defense, foreign affairs, finance, public
security and information.
   It would be an ``unprecedented'' U.N. operation to solve a
regional conflict, one U.S. diplomat said _ costing the United
Nations up to $5 billion over one or two years and involving as
many as 10,000 peacekeeping troops and 10,000 civilian personnel.
   ``We have gone as far as we can as the five permanent members,''
said a U.S. diplomat involved in the talks, which also included
Britain, France, China and the Soviet Union.

   FBI agents, federal prosecutors, prison guards
and other Justice Department crime fighters are being told they
could be furloughed if Congress and the White House don't agree on
a budget.
   The Justice Department is notifying most of its 80,000 employees
that they could be furloughed up to 22 days in the coming fiscal
year if automatic spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law take effect Oct. 1.
   The Office of Management and Budget has ordered a 32.4 percent
spending cut from the government's operating budget in the 1991
fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, if lawmakers and the Bush
administration fail to agree on other ways of reducing the budget
deficit.
   Officials at various federal law enforcement agencies said the
furloughs could make operating extremely difficult.

   A judge nearly wept as she gave the Roman
Catholic Church permission to exhume the remains of a former
Haitian slave who has been proposed for canonization as the first
black American saint.
   Acting state Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob on
Tuesday granted the request from the Archdiocese of New York to
exhume Pierre Toussaint's body for identification by a pathologist
and church officials.
   ``It is rare that this court has an opportunity to participate
in such a historic event, if only tangentially,'' the judge said.
   Church records show Toussaint, who died a free man in 1853 at
87, was buried at Old St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   Court papers referred to him as ``a model of charity'' who is
considered the founder of Catholic Charities because he helped the
needy for 66 years when no formal systems of assistance existed.

<TEXT>
   Orthodox worshipers climbed the Holy
Mountain last month in their annual pilgrimage, but the wooden
chapel that greeted the faithful for nearly three centuries was
gone, burned to the ground.
   The tiny chapel and its priceless icons were destroyed July 12.
A month later, the joy of the annual pilgrimage to Grabarka was
cloaked with grief and suspicion.
   A convict on a five-day leave from prison was charged with
setting the fire because he could not break into the chapel to
steal a gold cross.
   Priests and their followers are troubled not only by the
destruction of the Orthodox faith's holiest shrine in Poland, but
by fear that the motivation was darker than robbery.
   ``It was a blow at the heart of Orthodoxy . . . aimed to destroy
us,'' said one priest, who would not give his name. ``Most people
think the only religion in Poland should be Catholic.''
   There have been several attacks on Orthodox churches in Poland,
a nation of 38 million people that is 93 percent Roman Catholic.
   St. Mary's was the sixth Orthodox church burned in five years,
the government newspaper Rzeczpospolita reported.
   Keston College, a British organization that monitors religious
freedom, also has expressed concern about attacks on Orthodox
institutions in Poland.
   Orthodoxy holds many tenets similar to Roman Catholicism, but
rejects the primacy of the pope. It is Poland's largest religious
minority, with an estimated 800,000 followers, many of them ethnic
Byelorussians from the eastern provinces.
   During the three-day Orthodox pilgrimage, up to 60,000 people
climbed to this village 75 miles west of Warsaw and 15 from the
Soviet border.
   The spring-fed waters of the Holy Mountain, in reality a small
hill, are supposed to have cured a prophet's followers of plague in
1710.
   Pilgrims, some climbing on their knees, carried wooden crosses
to be planted on the hilltop amid the thousands of weathered,
moss-covered offerings of previous years, many of which were
charred by the fire.
   ``This is a special year, one when we are all living through
this great loss,'' said Eugeniusz Zabrodski, a priest from nearby
Drohiczyn.
   ``Looking at the burned wood, and the altar where I used to say
Divine Liturgy, I could only wonder how anyone could do this,'' he
said.
   On Sunday, Aug. 19, the observances culminated in the
consecration of the cornerstone of a new church.
   Collection boxes for the building fund dotted the hill.
Donations from around the world totaled $8,420 and the Polish
Senate, which condemned the arson, contributed $5,260.
   There is controversy about what kind of church to build.
   ``Some think it should be wood just like it was, but others want
to take advantage of the opportunity and build something much
larger,'' Zabrodski said.
   For now, services are conducted on a makeshift wooden altar
dwarfed by towering pines with singed branches.
   The happy chatter of pilgrims washing in the waters below
reached the hushed reverence of the shrine. Elderly women, their
heads covered by scarves in the Orthodox tradition, circled the
altar on their knees.
   Many faithful spent the night kneeling in prayer. The Divine
Liturgy, in Old Church Slavonic, was conducted virtually without
cease from 6 p.m. Saturday until Sunday afternoon.
   Poland's Orthodox Church is independent of Russian Orthodoxy, to
which it lost an estimated 4.5 million followers after World War
II, when the Soviet Union annexed eastern Poland.
   Both churches descend from the Orthodox faith that developed in
Constantinople after the Great Schism of 1054.
   At Grabarka, worshipers and clergy communicated in a polyglot of
Polish, Russian, Byelorussian and Slovak, reflecting the mix of
peoples who feel the tug of the shrine year after year.
   ``We came here to get our strength, because this is where the
Orthodox are,'' said Ania, a 20-year-old law student from Bialystok.

<HEAD>Vietnam Vets Write ``Medal of Honor'' Specials</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This Labor Day weekend, as the Persian Gulf
crisis and the U.S. military buildup in Saudi Arabia continue, a
special called ``Medal of Honor'' will air on TV stations around
the country.
   It is possible that the debut date _ the show is the first of
six one-hour specials about the men who earned the nation's highest
military honor for bravery _ may strike some cynics as just too
coincidental.
   Yes, ``I'm a little worried that people will take it the wrong
way, that we're trying to cash in on'' on public support of U.S.
forces, says Pat Duncan, co-author and director of the specials.
   But its premiere date is a coincidence, nothing more. The show
was announced well before the Gulf crisis began, ``and we've been
working on these specials for 18 months,'' he said.
   Unlike many film and TV folk who in recent years have tackled
war (and specifically Vietnam) as a topic, Duncan and his ``Medal''
co-author, retired Marine Capt. Russ Thurman, know whereof they
write in combat matters.
   Each is a Vietnam veteran with grunt time in that war, Duncan
with the Army's 173rd Airborne Brigade and Thurman as an enlisted
man who after the war became a ``mustang,'' an up-from-the-ranks
officer.
   Duncan's experiences helped him create the Home Box Office
anthology series, ``Vietnam War Stories,'' and the much-praised
``84 Charlie Mopic,'' a documentary-style film drama about a
long-range Army patrol in Vietnam.
   The ``Medal of Honor'' specials _ all are narrated by Cliff
Robertson _ are produced by U.S. News &amp; World Report. The first
will be shown on at least 124 stations on Labor Day weekend, the
producers said.
   Filled with combat footage, along with home movies or still
photographs of each subject, the specials aren't dramatic
re-creations, save in one respect. It uses actors' voices _
including that of Thurman in one segment _ to depict those of the
men in combat stories told.
   Each special is to air on a patriotic holiday, with the final
one on July 4th. The first three are about Medal of Honor
recipients in World War II, and the fourth about those in Korea.
The last two cover the Vietnam War.
   A total of 20 receipients are profiled, three to four per show.
   (One of them, Army Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady, a medivac helicopter
pilot in Vietnam, has a double distinction: His story was told last
year in ``Heroes,'' a cable series shown on the Arts &amp;
Entertainment Network.)
   The idea of ``Medal of Honor,'' Thurman said, is (a) to show the
personal side of each recipient, his life before his war and after
it, if he survived, and (b) explain what earned him the medal.
   ``We hired a whole platoon of researchers,'' he said. ``My task
was to go through the immense amount of material we had, to
separate the wheat from the chaff, because a lot of research turned
up overly written articles from early era men's magazines that
embellished everything.
   ``The idea was to get down to the hard-core facts, using
interviews and other eyewitness documentation to recapture the
event.''
   The work at times could be difficult, he said, ``because we
found out that the eyewitnesses to the event, if you ask them today
what happened, tend to embellish. But the recipient, if he's alive,
tends to downplay.''
   Is there a common thread in the way those interviewed talk about
their war?
   ``Most of them say they were just doing their job,'' Duncan
said. ``They're all pretty humble about it. Pat Brady, who went
through three helicopters and saved 51 men one day, is a good
example.
   ``He said, `I had days when I saved more men, 125, and days when
I went through more helicopters. There just happened to be somebody
around recording things' '' on the day his medivac flights into
Viet Cong and North Vietnamese ground fire earned him the Medal of
Honor.
   The general portrait that emerges of these men, Thurman said, is
not of hard-chargers bent on proving their courage or risking their
lives for an abstraction called their country.
   Most proved to be ordinary Americans, ``who for a moment,
sometimes a very brief moment, did extraordinary things,'' he said.
``Very few times did they ever do it for their country.
   ``Most of the time they did it for the guy next to them.''

<HEAD>Annuities: New Life In An Old Idea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In this era of turbulence and innovation in the
world of personal finance, not all the hot ideas are new ideas.
   Consider that venerable vehicle known as the annuity _ a simple
form of contract which provides investors with a steady stream of
income that is designed to keep flowing until they die.
   True, the basic idea may have been invented by ancients who rode
to work on horseback and kept their ledgers with a goose-quill pen.
But the annuity 1990-style boasts many features of the computer age.
   And the powers-that-be have given annuities tax advantages that
rank them right up there competitively with more modern
contrivances like individual retirement accounts and 401(k) savings
plans.
   If you wish, you can choose among fixed annuities, variable
annuities, single-premium, annual-premium and flexible-premium
annuities, annuities with or without an early bailout clause.
   While the list of options may require some extensive study,
financial advisers say there is a common set of questions to ask
and standards to apply in evaluating annuities in all their forms.
   Most annuities offered today are ``deferred'' annuities _ that
is, they provide for payments starting some time, perhaps many
years, after the first premiums are paid.
   In the interim, the money is put to work for either a fixed
return spelled out in the contract or a variable return that
depends on the performance of a mutual fund.
   As in an IRA or 401(k), the earnings build up free of income-tax
obligations until withdrawals begin.
   ``The deferred annuity offers investors two attractive features
in one package _ tax deferral and growth potential,'' observes
William Brennan, a specialist in financial planning matters at the
accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young.
   ``And, unlike IRAs or pension plans, there is no limit to the
amount that can be deposited each year,'' says Henry Montag, a
financial planner writing in the current issue of the newsletter
The Moneypaper, published in Mamaroneck, N.Y.
   Payments of annuity premiums aren't eligible for any tax
deduction at the time they are made. But when annuity payments
begin, only the portion of those payments that represents
investment earnings is subject to income tax.
   ``The amount of the payments will depend upon the amount of
premiums paid, the earnings over the years, the investor's age and
the insurer's annuity payout rates,'' Brennan notes.
   By its very nature, an investment in a deferred annuity tends to
be a long-term proposition. For one thing, it takes time for
tax-free compounding to work to your benefit.
   For another, annuity issuers typically impose surrender charges
or other fees on withdrawals in the early years of the contract. As
with IRAs, the government collects a 10 percent penalty tax on
withdrawals before you reach age 59{.
   Financial advisers say investors should check thoroughly into
such fees before they commit themselves, and understand what
provisions the contract makes for them to withdraw their money and
move it elsewhere.
   In a variable annuity, for example, annual fees can reduce the
return you might realize from what you could get in a conventional
mutual fund investment.
   ``An investor should consider how long it would take for the
potentially lower annual yield of the annuity to be overcome by the
benefit of tax-deferred compounding,'' Brennan says.
   ``As a general rule, to make the investment worthwhile an
investor should plan to let his or her money accumulate in the
annuity for at least 10 years.''

<HEAD>Cost of Military Buildup Piddling When Compared to Wasteful
Spending</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The enormous, sudden, costly American military
buildup in the Mideast gives an idea of the magnitude of some other
big numbers, such as budget deficits.
   It is a measuring stick, that is, for budgetary and other
financial items so large as to be almost meaningless to many
people, simply because they have no way of matching those numbers
against other expenditures.
   Now they have a vivid picture of what can be done for a few
billion dollars.
   Through September, according to the Pentagon, American
operations in the Persian Gulf will add about $2.5 billion to
normal military operating costs, a figure big by any method of
calculation.
   For that price, the military will transport and make
battle-ready more than 100,000 personnel and thousands of fighter
planes, bombers, tankers, transports, helicopters, radar, tanks,
artillery, rockets, ammuniton . . .
   That sum pays for aircraft carriers, hospitals, hospital ships,
medicines, minesweepers, destroyers, amphibious tracked vehicles,
food, kitchens, fuel, equipment, living quarters, special clothing,
intelligence operations . . .
   The cost of the entire incredible, almost inconceivably
intricate operation is peanuts, however, when matched against the
way America can waste money. As in the savings and loan fiasco, and
in routine, everyday waste by government.
   Six years ago, for example, the President's Private Sector
Survey on Cost Control, chaired by business executive J. Peter
Grace, recommended a three-year program of spending reductions and
efficiencies totaling $424 billion.
   Instead of cutting, Congress in the very next year raised
federal spending by $94.5 billion, or nearly 38 times the estimated
cost of the first two months of the Mideast military buildup.
   Late last year, the General Accounting Office issued its
congressionally mandated annual report on federal financial
management. It found more than $150 billion in program waste, fraud
and financial mismanagement.
   ``The problems that exist are not limited to a few agencies or a
few programs,'' said Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher.
``Rather, all of the major agencies have serious problems.''
   Each year, the Congressional Budget Office must recommend budget
options for Senate and House Budget Committees. This year it
suggested reforms to yield $60 billion in savings during the first
year. Agreement hasn't been reached.
   Unlike the Mideast buildup, funds budgeted by government
sometimes serves no national purpose and produce no practical
results.
   Scott Hodge, a fellow of the conservative Heritage Foundation,
says he has identified more than $130 billion of spending cuts and
budget savings that could be made without harming basic and
necessary social programs.
   But Congress, he says, has an addiction to creating programs and
to pork barrel spending. Individually, many of these programs might
seem innocuous, and thus escape criticism, but when they
proliferate the costs do, too.
   Here are a few added to the budget in recent years: Creation of
a national center for the study of weeds, subsidies to develop the
commercialization of New Mexico wildflowers, a removal of the
$250,000 limit on honey subsidies.
   Murray Weidenbaum, former chief economic adviser to President
Reagan, recently completed a book on the subject of budget deficits
and congressional spending. He thinks $100 billion should be cut
from the budget right now.
   Such thinking, however, doesn't seem to constitute practical
politics, at least the way the game is played these days.
   Weidenbaum, now director of the Center for the Study of American
Business at Washington University in St. Louis, would begin by
lopping $25 billion from farm subsidies, but he seems to think it
won't be done.
   ``At present, we have to admit that there is little public
support for budget cuts,'' he says, explaining that ``all the
average citizen reads or hears about are the pleas of the spending
agencies and their beneficiaries.''
   What agency or interest group, he asks, ``is going to pay for an
ad to proclaim that its pet program is wasteful or even funded too
generously?''
   Measured against the $150 billion in program waste, fraud and
financial mismanagement, as found by the General Accounting Office,
the Mideast buildup seems like a bargain.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Decline in Priests May Be Useful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Signs of the times may be telling American Roman Catholics that
they don't need so many priests and that lay people should take
over more church responsibilites, an analyst of the situation says.
   The theory is put forward by the Rev. Eugene Hemrick, research
director for the nation's Catholic bishops, in the face of a new
study indicating the priesthood is headed into a steep decline.
   ``Maybe we had too many priests in the past,'' he said.
``There's much more relying on lay people than before, which could
be a good thing. That may be why all this is happening.''
   The study projects that in 15 years the number of active
diocesan priests will have shrunk to 21,030 in this country. That
would be a 40 percent drop from a peak of 35,070 in 1966.
   ``There's no doubt about it, we're in for a dramatic drop,''
said Hemrick, who works in Washington, D.C.
   The drop in priests looms as the number of American Catholics
increases, from the current 57 million to an estimated 70 million
by 2005. At the same time, parishes without priests are
multiplying, now numbering more than 1,000.
   Many parishes now are run by lay ``pastoral administrators'' or
nuns filling that role. With that practice spreading, the bishops
issued guidelines last fall for Sunday worship without priests.
   Richard Schoenherr, a sociologist at the University of Wisconsin
who oversaw the study on the priesthood, suggested lifting the
requirement of celibacy for priests might slow the decline in
numbers.
   ``A growing majority of priests themselves and the Catholic
people say they would welcome a married priesthood,'' he said.
   Since a priest is required to consecrate the bread and wine of
Holy Communion, people are beginning to complain that their
participation in that sacrament is being lost, Schoenherr said.
   However, Henrick disagreed that would happen.
   He said consecrated elements can be reserved and taken for
distribution to congregations without priests, or perhaps
circuit-traveling priests can consecrate and reserve elements for
subseqeuent use by such congregations.
   ``We have lay ministers who administer communion,'' he said.
``That's one of the new movements in the church. Lay eucharistic
ministers distribute the sacrament. They take it to people in
hospitals and prisons.
   ``Before, this was the role only of priests.''
   The clerically centered and priest-run parish is changing, he
said. ``Lay people are working side-by-side with the pastor. There
is much more sharing in major decisions than before and involvement
of lay people.''
   Noting that this was one of the objectives of the Second Vatican
Council of 1962-65 in defining the church as the ``people of God,''
he said:
   ``I say let the trend of fewer priests go on and see where it
takes us. Maybe God is calling us to it. If it doesn't stand the
test of time, we can go in another direction.''
   Hemrick said that allowing ``optional celibacy'' for priests
might boost their numbers but ``it would create more problems than
it would solve.''
   ``The idea of beefing up numbers, getting more priests by hook
or crook, is a throwback to the way things used to be,'' he said.
``It's almost like flouting the movement that is taking place now
of fewer priests working more closely with the laity.''
   Hemrick said there is some resistance from church members to the
changes wrought by the lack of priests and it is likely to
increase. ``It's hard to change people's perceptions. They want to
hold on to tradition on which they were brought up,'' he said.
   But the study, which was commissioned by the U.S. bishops,
points clearly to a continued decline and ``to a very slim
priesthood'' in the future.
   The 165-page report, prepared by researchers at the University
of Wisconsin and Brigham Young University and financed by the Lilly
Endowment, has not been made public, but a copy was provided to
Catholic News Service.
   It quotes the report as saying that ``the decrease in priestly
ordinations is the most significant factor in the overall clergy
decline _ far more significant than resignations, retirements or
other factors.''
   Bishop Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh, chairman of the bishops'
committee on priestly life and ministry, says the findings will be
considered by the bishops' administrative committee that is to meet
in Washington Sept. 11-13.
   Although Schoenherr said Catholics are worried about being
deprived of communion by lack of priests, Hemrick said history
shows that when the numbers of priests have been reduced, by
persecution, for example, ways are found to keep communion
available to everyone.
   ``That was the case in Eastern Europe,'' he said, where priests
had to go underground but kept celebrating communion in homes or
secluded places. ``But they survived.''

   Relaxed relations with the
Soviet Union have allowed the North American Aerospace Defense
Command to shift more of its resources to another threat: South
American drug smugglers.
   But NORAD's commander, Gen. Donald J. Kutyna, believes that
every time the United States ups the ante, the cocaine cartel will
counter with money and stealth.
   ``The way you're going to stop the drug war is at the user
level, you're not going to stop it at the interdiction level,''
said Kutyna, a four-star general and Vietnam veteran who assumed
command of NORAD in April.
   ``Remember the Ho Chi Minh trail? Well, we bombed them (the
North Vietnamese), we napalmed them, everything else in the whole
world. We still couldn't stop them.
   ``The druggie is always going to find an innovative way to get
in. We're going to make it tougher for them, we're going to make it
more costly, we're going to deter some by putting them in jail. But
the price of that stuff is high enough that they're (smugglers)
going to keep trying.''
   NORAD is a joint United States-Canadian command headquartered at
Peterson Air Force Base and inside the top-secret Cheyenne Mountain
global eavesdropping complex, both at Colorado Springs. Their
listening posts span the globe and extend into space.
   In a recent interview, Kutyna said that involving his troops in
the drug war has boosted morale and sharpened skills.
   ``It gives us a lot of good practice that we weren't getting
before,'' said Kutyna. ``Before, we had to hire Lear jets or T-33s
to fly as enemy intruder targets. Now we've got real targets out
there who are really trying to evade us as if their life depends on
it, they're a lot more motivated.
   ``So our crews are scrambling at them, several scrambles a day
... something like 51 actual intercepts this year. It's keeping
(our crews) sharper. Sitting at alert for hour after hour, day
after day, is kind of dull,'' he said.
   ``It's very good for morale. I think probably my highest morale
troops are the guys involved with drug interdiction, from the
intelligence segment to the pilots flying intercepts to the guys
working in radar, because we're really doing something worthwhile.''
   Among its assets in the drug war, NORAD has 41 ground radar
sites in the continental United States and 13 in Alaska; tethered
Aerostats (radar balloons) in Florida and the Southwest; about 60
fighter planes at 30 alert locations, and a fleet of E-3 Airborne
Warning and Control System (AWACS) planes.
   Before Iraq invaded Kuwait, 42 percent of the Air Force's AWACS
missions were flown against potential drug smugglers. Nearly three
weeks after the invasion, a NORAD spokesman said that percentage
was still ``about the same.''
   ``That's a very costly way of chasing druggies,'' said Kutyna,
who favors a broader, ground-based overlapping radar net _ the
experimental Over-the-Horizon Backscatter Radar system.
   ``I can't get Congress to fund it. I don't know if it's
politics, or just a matter of money, but they have declared that
the drug war is over, we don't have to worry about it anymore and
therefore we don't need it.''
   Kutyna said drug smugglers have switched their main route into
the United States from the Caribbean to Mexico.
   ``Sixty to 70 percent of the drug traffic now coming into the
States is through Mexico,'' said Kutyna. ``At first they used to
fly right up through Mexico and across our border. We've precluded
that with AWACS patrols there, we've got radar on balloons. So
we've kind of shut down the border, much better than it was before,
though they can still sneak through every once in a while.''
   The 1989 National Defense Authorization Act assigned the Defense
Department as the front-line agency in the fight against the drug
barons. Initially, the Pentagon resisted involvement in the
domestic ``war,'' but as the Cold War wound down, the military
increasingly warmed to the new battle front.
   This fiscal year the Defense Department will spend an estimated
$450 million against drug smugglers; next year, $1.2 billion is
budgeted.
   Still, they have their work cut out for them. Military experts
estimate that about 220,000 tons of cocoa leaves are grown in
Andean rain forests every year, and that between 3,000 and 5,000
sea trips and up to 3,500 aircraft flights annually bring cocaine
to as many as 3 million American users.
   Federal law prohibits the military from arresting smugglers or
firing upon them; the NORAD crews can intercept planes and force
them to turn back, or track them until they land and tip off other
law enforcement agencies as to their whereabouts.
   ``We weren't sure it was our mission from the beginning, and
then we got to flying and people said `Yes, that is our mission,'
and we take it on with great enthusiasm now, and we certainly
believe it is right. I wouldn't call it a military threat, but
drugs are certainly a threat to our national well being, our
national security.''

   In the twilight of the typewriter, as IBM sells
its Selectric division and secretaries trade their trusty electrics
for word processors, the old man known as Mr. Typewriter is all
keyed up.
   ``We're getting more work than we can handle!'' says Martin
Tytell, 76, whose Tytell Typewriter Co. and Questioned Document
Laboratory has identified, made and repaired typewriters for
everyone from the FBI to Alger Hiss.
   The other day a tribe of Indians in British Colombia asked him
to make the first typewriter in their language, and in the past
month he's sold eight Romanian typewriters. A Japanese company
opening a plant in a region of China with irregular electrical
power wants 20 manuals in phonetic Japanese.
   There are calls from companies trying to track down the authors
of anonymous memos, from lawyers wondering if a will typed out on a
proportional spacing electric could really have been drawn up in
1950.
   Tytell and company _ his wife Pearl and their 45-year-old son
Peter _ are ready for virtually any typographic challenge.
   They have the world's largest collection of type _ about 2
million pieces _ representing 145 different languages and dialects,
including Syriac, a virtually dead language that dates from the
time of Christ, and Old English.
   They have about 400 assembled typewriters in various languages,
including several in Hindi and Siamese, ready for sale.
   They have a type and typewriter reference library that helps
them to determine, sometimes for the information of the police, if
a document could have been typed on a particular typewriter on a
particular date.
   But their greatest asset is their experience. They can tell a
Selectric II from a Selectric III by the length of the underscore
line. They know that if the dot on an ``i'' is slightly to the
left, it was typed on an L.C. Smith manual, that an ``8'' with a
small projection at the top came from an Underwood Model 8.
   He has made or repaired machines for Dwight Eisenhower, Adlai
Stevenson and Andy Rooney. He has made a typewriter for one-armed
typists, and a machine with nothing but question marks for a client
who, Tytell recalls, ``may or may not have been sane.''
   Martin Tytell's interest in typewriters dates back to high
school; he would regularly take apart the old Underwood in the
physical education office, and the repairman would regularly have
to put it back together. Finally, the expert let Tytell in on a few
secrets, and soon the youngster could reassemble the machine
blindfolded.
   He started his own repair shop before World War II, and hired
Pearl, who became his wife five years later. When Martin was
drafted the Army put him to work making typewriters in the many
languages used in the war's many theaters. The war ended, but not
the need for unusual typewriters.
   In 1950 Tytell was hired to buttress a claim by accused spy
Alger Hiss that he was the victim of ``forgery by typewriter.''
Hiss' lawyers posed the ultimate challenge: Duplicate the famous
Woodstock N230099 on which documents that incriminated Hiss had
been typed.
   For the then-enormous sum of $7,500, Tytell worked for months to
create such a machine. In the end, a judge ruled that Tytell's
effort was less than a perfect duplicate _ a verdict the machine's
creator questions.
   By the late 1950s Tytell's fame was such that the Post Office
routinely delivered mail addressed merely ``Mr. Typewriter, New
York'' to his dusty, cramped office-lab-warehouse-workshop near
Wall Street.
   There, steel shelves reaching to the 11-foot ceilings are filled
with typewriters, spare parts, boxes of type, and equipment ranging
from microscopes to blowtorches.
   Three years ago the floor began to collapse, so the Tytells
rented another space around the corner. The family collection
extends uptown to Peter's one-bedroom apartment, which shelters
about 130 typewriters _ ``but a lot of them are portables,'' he
explains.
   On a recent morning the clan gathered to discuss their favorite
subject. Martin's long white lab coat matched his moustache and
hair; Pearl wears her hair wrapped around her head in a braid;
Peter looked scholarly with his wire-frame glasses, droopy
moustache and necktie decorated with type faces.
   They are three intelligent, experienced and informed people who
love their work and love to talk about it _ usually all at once.
   When Peter, who launched into a history of the typewriter,
mentioned that Queen Anne granted the first patent for ``a writing
machine'' in 1714, his father jumped in to correct the date (1713,
he said) as well as the patent number.
   The interview was suspended as father and son began pulling
reference and history books from the shelves; finally Peter located
a history of typewriters in German that proved him right and ended
the argument.
   So it went for several hours: Martin began a story, Pearl broke
in to elaborate; he wandered off in search of some book to buttress
his own point; Peter cut in on his mother, who also headed off to
photocopy some relevant document. Eventually Martin returned to
interrupt Peter and pick up the thread of the conversation.
   Here, distilled, is one of their favorite typewriter cases:
   Anonymous typewritten letters were being sent to the residents
of an affluent Long Island suburb, accusing a young doctor of
running an abortion mill. The doctor's practice suffered;
associates and acquaintances cut him off; his daughter was insulted
at school.
   Tytell knew he could identify the typewriter, because in each
note the ``i'' key slanted to the left and the ``u'' was dented,
and he suspected the notes were the work of a former nurse.
   Posing as a typewriter repairman and offering a free,
introductory machine cleaning, Tytell talked his way into the homes
of several suspects, but did not find the right typewriter.
   As the Tytells reread the letters, however, Mrs. Tytell had a
hunch. The writer had accused the doctor's wife of being a poor
housekeeper. That, Pearl decided, sounded like a jealous relative.
   The next day Martin went to the office where the doctor's sister
worked as a stenographer. There, sitting on her desk, was the
machine. The letters stopped after she was confronted with the
evidence.
   But today the computer printer is replacing the typewriter as
the favored instrument of white-collar crime, extortion, ransom and
blackmail.
   The explosion in printer production and technology has sent
Peter scurrying around the country to printer manufacturing plants
and computer sales shows, filled his apartment with stacks of
computer journals and periodicals, embroiled him in a work week
that often stretches to 75 hours.
   To the forger or poison pen, the printer offers new
possibilities. Where once typewriter sleuths could realistically
hope to match a typewritten document to a typewriter with a unique
typeface and key stroke, now a laser printer has several
``resident'' typefaces and accepts a cartridge with additional ones.
   Computer printers also are harder to ``read'' than typewriters,
because they don't deteriorate as quickly and develop distinctive
flaws, and because they tend to shut down entirely when a problem
does develop.
   In his more sanguine moments, Peter tells himself the printer is
merely ``another cycle, another swing of the pendulum,'' and that
the basic laws of document identification haven't changed. But, he
adds, `If I don't take that attitude I'll be reduced to a mass of
Jell-o.''

   Four months ago, someone painted a small,
rusty-red swastika on a stone pillar a few steps from the Israeli
ambassador's home.
   He drives by it every day, neighbors walk dogs past it, children
play nearby. No one has tried to obliterate the ugly symbol.
   Graffiti and other signs of anti-Semitism are being seen again
in Poland, even though it is nearly bereft of Jews, and the
prejudice of the streets has begun to infiltrate politics.
   Some rightist politicians are fanning nationalist emotions and,
with a seeming inevitability, anti-Semitism.
   On the other side, prominent anti-Communist figures like Adam
Michnik, editor of the newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, and Zbigniew
Bujak _ both leaders of the pro-government Democratic Action party
_ have been sounding the alarm.
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa, indignant at suggestions of
bigotry on the part of himself or some of his followers, declared:
``Lech Walesa is not and will not be anti-Semitic.''
   In a resolution July 29, Walesa's national Citizens Committee
condemned both prejudice and the use of unfounded charges of
anti-Semitism to smear political opponents. Members of the
committee have accused foreign journalists of exaggerating the
extent of anti-Semitism in Poland.
   The late sociologist Aleksander Hertz, a Polish Jew, said
anti-Semitism grew in the 19th century in response to Poland's
humiliating partitions, Russian influences and the prosperity of a
burgeoning Jewish population, which both the declining aristocracy
and impoverished peasants resented.
   In politics, anti-Semitism peaked just before World War II, when
it was a major tenet of the popular National Democrats. University
students hounded Jewish colleagues and anti-Semites organized
boycotts of Jewish businesses.
   Three million Polish Jews were killed by the Nazis. Some of the
half-million who survived owed their lives to Poles who hid them,
but others were betrayed by Polish acquaintances.
   Polish Jews who lived through the Holocaust were traumatized by
it and feared trying to reclaim homes and property from Christians,
particularly after a pogrom in 1946 that took 48 lives in Kielce.
Most of them emigrated to Israel or the United States.
   An official Communist purge of ``Zionists'' prompted the last
big wave of emigration in 1968, reducing the number of Jews to
5,000-15,000 in a nation of 38 million people.
   For the first time in centuries, Poland is without a large
Jewish population, and profound changes have resulted.
   Before the war, Jews were about 10 percent of the population,
concentrated in towns and cities, and made up a large part of the
middle class. The landed aristocracy disdained commerce and
peasants stuck to their farms, so much of the small business, trade
and industry were left to Jews.
   Half a century after Nazi occupation, Poland still has not come
to grips with the loss of its Jewish population. Any discussion of
Jews is likely to provoke strong emotions, often defensive.
   Poland's only rabbi, Pinchas Menachem Joskowicz, said he had
noticed more anti-Semitism recently. He used to find respect and
friendliness when he walked the streets in his traditional orthodox
garb, Joskowicz said, but now encounters hostility.
   ``Two weeks ago, I had guests from Israel and we went for a
walk,'' he said in an interview. ``Then youths, maybe 21, maybe
younger, started shouting `Jews to Palestine' and other slogans,
too. I did not pay any attention, let them shout.
   ``But when we walked a few meters they approached us and started
hitting one of the guests.''
   Joskowicz said he now avoids walking at night and does not know
what to tell Jews from abroad when they ask him if it is safe to
visit Poland.
   There is a tendency to blame Jews for the nation's troubles.
   ``I keep hearing that a gang has gotten to the feeding trough,
they are probably Jews and they are destroying us,'' Walesa told a
meeting of his national Citizens Committee on June 24.
   He said such remarks do not mean anti-Semitism is increasing,
but that the government must do a better job of explaining itself
to the people.
   Farmers who occupied the Agriculture Ministry in June, demanding
guaranteed prices, were heard muttering about the ``Jewish
government.''
   That government is led by a devout Roman Catholic, Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who identifies with
Christian-Democratic politics and sometimes is accused of being too
solicitous of the church.
   Allegations that Jews run the government rest on the fact that
some prominent Solidarity politicians are Jews. Two examples are
Michnik and Parliament member Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the
Citizens Parliamentary Club, who are of Jewish descent but do not
practice the religion.
   Communist functionaries used such information in the past in the
vain hope of discrediting Solidarity.
   In August, the National Party, a far-right group based in the
southern city of Krakow, said it was unfair for an ethnic minority
to have dominance in the government. The Grunwald Society, created
by nationalistic Communists, contended recently that ``German and
Jewish chauvinists'' were the greatest threats to Polish
sovereignty.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska, who wrote a
book on the remaining Jews in Poland with her husband, a
photographer, said anti-Semitism is coming to the surface in the
more liberal atmosphere since Communist rule.
   ``Now everything is free,'' she said. ``Many good things have
come out, but also some bad things.''
   Some anti-Semitism is present in all countries, she said, and
``I hope it will be marginal in Poland too for the future. Because
it's visible, it can be fought.''

<HEAD>Ecuador's President Has Problems Halfway Through Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARLOS CISTERNAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>QUITO, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Rodrigo Borja, halfway through
his term, has not convinced the people he can solve Ecuador's
economic problems and faces the added burden of a hostile Congress.
   Annual inflation of 50 percent spurs discontent and many
analysts say Borja's last two years may be a time of paralyzing
political confrontation. His Democratic Left party lost its
congressional majority in June.
   ``I greatly fear the new legislature will devote itself to
waging war on the government, which in turn will defend itself like
a wounded animal, with every weapon available,'' Alejandro Carrion,
a respected columnnist, wrote in the magazine Vistaso.
   All is not bleak, however. Ecuador exports oil, and higher
prices resulting from the Middle East crisis could produce an
``economic bonanza'' for the government, said Fernando Santos,
energy minister under Borja's right-wing predecessor, Leon Febres
Cordero.
   Oil is a government monopoly and provides nearly 50 percent of
public revenue in Ecuador, a small Andean nation of 10 million
people. Borja based this year's budget on an average price of $15 a
barrel, but fluctuating prices since Iraq occupied Kuwait on Aug. 2
have reached more than twice that.
   Borja took office in August 1988, three months after winning a
runoff with populist Abdala Bucaram. Febres Cordero could not run
again because presidents are allowed only one term in Ecuador.
   Febres Cordero left a stagnant economy and record annual
inflation of 88 percent. For most of the 1980s, inflation had
averaged less than 30 percent.
   The new president pledged to cut inflation in half before the
end of his first year, but the figure dropped only to 54.7 percent.
   This year, he renewed the promise to halve inflation, but the
annual rate continues to run above 50 percent. Independent
economists predict it will level out at 40 percent by year's end.
   Experts blame Borja's restrictive spending policies for slow
economic growth. The Central Bank says the economy grew only 0.4
percent in 1989.
   His government rejected a ``shock'' antt-inflation program of
the type favored by the International Monetary Fund, preferring
gradual measures like small currency devaluations and energy price
increases introduced weekly.
   Analysts say the repeated increases in gasoline and electricity
prices contributed to the governing Democratic Left's crushing
defeat in the June 17 congressional elections.
   It retained only 14 of its 30 seats and lost the majority it had
forged in the one-house legislature through an alliance with a
minor party.
   Among the parties gaining ground was Febres Cordero's
conservative Social Christian Party, which increased its membership
in the 72-seat chamber from seven to 16.
   Bucaram's Ecuadorean Roldosista Party won 13 seats, an increase
of five, and the Socialist Party, a Marxist group, doubled its
presence to eight.
   Bucaram and Febres Cordero have promised Borja will face tough
going in the new Congress, which convened Aug. 10 and immediately
demanded that seven of his 12 Cabinet members resign.
   Among those on the list was the agriculture minister, blamed by
the opposition for recurring food shortages, and the education
minister, accused of embezzling funds from a literacy campaign.
   Andres Vallejo, a former interior minister appointed Central
Bank president in July, is another target. The opposition claims he
persecuted critics while in charge of the Interior Ministry, which
controls the police.
   By recent Ecuadorean standards, Borja's first two years were
tranquil.
   Febres Cordero, his fiery-tempered predecessor, had to battle a
hostile Congress with a leftist majority led by Borja's party.
   He put down two attempted coups in 1986 and, a year later, was
kidnapped by air force paratroopers and forced to pardon the air
force commander, who led the coup attempts.
   Congress then tried to impeach him, without success.

<HEAD>The `$500,000 Student': A Special Education Tragedy</HEAD>

   When 40 million youngsters return to
public school this fall, it will cost an average of $5,638 each to
educate them.
   You might call Beth Ann Brown the ``$500,000 student.''
   Beth Ann _ a profoundly handicapped 21-year-old _ her parents,
and Wilson County school district outside Nashville are locked in a
tragic legal duel to decide who should pay for her phenomenally
expensive care, and whether that care is really medical, or
educational.
   If she wins, as she well might, the county will owe her a sum
equal to more than one-fourth of its entire special education
budget of just under $2 million, which serves nearly 1,300
handicapped children.
   It would also add to a recent string of court decisions
mandating more special education spending _ cases which a growing
number of educators say threaten to squeeze regular education
budgets and erode support for educating the nation's 4.3 million
handicapped children.
   Beth Ann's sad case also points up failures of state governments
to share responsibility with local districts, and the mounting
consequences of the federal government's refusal to provide funds
it promised for special education services it mandated 15 years ago.
   Beth Ann Brown, a slight young woman with short brown hair,
uncertain gait and frightened eyes, was born brain damaged on March
9, 1969. She was left with a speech defect, cerebral palsy, and an
emotional disability so severe that normal school has been all but
impossible most of her life.
   From kindergarten on, her behavior grew more bizarre and
unmanageable. She was given to unpredictable and violent outbursts.
She swallowed hairspray, thumbtacks and clothing, banged her head,
used profane language, and engaged publicly in inappropriate sexual
behavior, according to court records.
   Tests show she is borderline retarded, says her lawyer, Gary
Buchanan.
   For years, Beth Ann's parents and Wilson school officials had
worked hard and until recently, amicably, searching for an
appropriate place for her.
   She spent much of her life in seven different psychiatric
hospitals or mental health centers in Tennessee and Pennsylvania.
Her father's insurance picked up 90 percent of the cost; the school
district paid the rest.
   She made no progress and in fact worsened, according to her
parents.
   Since 1985, she has run away from two centers; spent three
heavily drugged months at a psychiatric hospital; received
homebound instruction; attended classes at a vocational training
center. Nothing worked.
   Beth Ann's last 18 months have been happier _ but at a
staggering cost.
   Since Feb. 15, 1989, she has led a sheltered life at Cedarbrook
Academy, a lush, $690-day residential center specializing in
brain-damage victims in Gallatin, Tenn., about 20 miles northeast
of Nashville. Drugs and psychotherapy add as much as $700 to $800
more to her monthly costs.
   Her parents and behavior therapists now say that for the first
time in her life she's making progress controlling her outbursts.
   Her curriculum includes music, recreation therapy, speech,
language arts, math, social interaction skills and health
education. In June, she received grades of ``C'' in language arts,
and ``D's'' in math, social skills and health. But her report card
noted overall progress ``somewhat higher than the grades would
indicate.''
   Her attention span has increased from about three minutes to as
much as 30 minutes. She is learning to count change. She is even
learning to type, though her speed is only about one word per
minute.
   She herself says she's finally learning to get a grip on her
volatile emotions _ enough, she hopes, to attend regular school
someday.
   ``I really like it here,'' she told a visitor. ``What I like
best is the people. They don't just look at you professionally.
They really care about you.''
   Despite her retardation, she can be articulate, curious and
assertive in calm moments. She talked animatedly about the rock
group ``New Kids on the Block,'' and her special fondness for
country music singer Gary Morris. She admits to occasional
homesickness.
   But her volatility still requires therapists to be at her elbow
virtually 24 hours a day.
   And her life at Cedarbrook has been clouded ever since her
father's group insurance plan switched carriers some 18 months ago.
The new carrier decided that the care Beth Ann was getting at
Cedarbrook was educational, not medical. They stopped paying.
   The Browns turned to Wilson County to pick up the tab. The
county refused, offering Beth Ann more homebound instruction
instead.
   Beth Ann and her parents sued.
   ``We were doing everything for Beth Ann we possibly could,''
said Mike Dover, Wilson County's director of special education.
``But with this last placement I finally said `no.' These
placements simply weren't working. We felt she had a mental health
problem.''
   But Middle Tennessee district court Judge Thomas A. Higgins
sided with Beth Ann. He issued a summary judgment on April 18
ordering Wilson County to pay $313,428.34 for her care at
Cedarbrook, retroactive to May 1, 1989.
   Wilson County's bill would exceed $500,000 by June 1, 1991 when
Beth Ann is 22 and no longer qualifies for special education.
   Under recently enacted special education rules, the district
would also have to pay Beth Ann's legal bills, currently amounting
to $13,128.30.
   The county is appealing. If it loses, county taxpayers _ already
incensed over an accumulated $1.5 million school budget deficit _
may face a tax increase, Dover said.
   The core issue raised by Beth Ann and thousands like her across
the country isn't whether they're legally entitled to such intense
and costly care.
   The real dilemma is, who should pay?
   At the heart of the matter is the increasingly murky legal
distinction between what is ``educational'' and what is ``medical.''
   The 1975 federal ``Education for All Handicapped Children Act''
which established the right of disabled five-to-22-year-olds to a
``free, appropriate public education,'' also required public
schools to provide what are called ``related services.''
   Such non-classroom services are meant to redress handicaps that
directly interfere with learning. They commonly include special
modes of transportation, speech therapy, and physical and
occupational therapy.
   But recent court rulings have greatly expanded the range of such
services to include virtually any medical procedure that does not
clearly require a doctor to administer them. A landmark 1984
Supreme Court ruling requires schools to provide catheterization to
a child with spina bifida, for example.
   A decision last November further stretched the bounds of special
education _beyond all reason, some educators contend.
   In Timothy vs. Rochester, N.H., the U.S. Supreme Court let stand
a ruling obligating school districts to provide education to all
children regardless of the potential benefit.
   The ruling compelled the Rochester school district to pay
$15,000 a year to educate a 14-year-old who was blind and deaf, had
cerebral palsy, was virtually immobile, and was so mentally
impaired that the only apparent evidence of intellectual potential
was that he responded to bright light, smiled when happy and cried
when sad.

   Educators, previously afraid of sounding heartless, now openly
warn of a possible taxpayer backlash as regular education budgets
are pinched by mounting special education costs, forcing tax
increases.
   ``Cases like this bring about a schizophrenia. Our hearts tell
us to do something. But our common sense tells us that there are
limits,'' said Thomas A. Shannon, executive director of the
National School Boards Association, which filed a brief in support
of the Rochester school district.
   According to a cost analysis done for Congress last April by the
National Association of State Directors of Special Education, total
education spending in New York State rose 90.1 percent from
1980-88. But special education spending increased by 186.4 percent.
In 1980, special education accounted for 11 percent of all
expenditures. In 1988, it had increased to 16.6 percent.
   Other states surveyed reported similar figures. In Florida,
total education spending rose 125.4 percent, compared with 210.2
percent for handicapped youngsters. In 1980, special education
amounted to 8.1 percent of all education spending, but rose to 11.2
percent eight years later.
   And new costs are just around the corner.
   In 1986, Congress passed a law entitling handicapped
preschoolers as young as 3 to public education. Starting in 1991,
any state that doesn't provide such services risks losing federal
special ed funds.
   Special educators accuse the federal government of being quick
to heap ever-greater responsibilities on school districts, but slow
to fund them.
   The 1975 act envisioned that the federal government would pay 40
percent of the total bill. But Washington never provided more than
14 percent, and has contributed less than 10 percent throughout the
1980s.
   The law also called on state mental health, social service,
vocational rehabilitation and education departments to cooperate in
funding and providing special education services.
   A few states, notably Maryland and Illinois, are pooling
resources from various state agencies to help fund services for
handicapped kids. But such cooperation remains rare, said William
Schipper, executive director of the National Association of State
Directors of Special Education.
   Adding to the fiscal strain on local districts, the current
trend of de-institutionalization has placed thousands of youngsters
once consigned to state mental hospitals into the care of public
schools.
   ``School districts wind up holding the bag, getting little or no
help from state agencies,'' said Melinda Maloney, managing editor
of ``The Special Educator,'' a semimonthly journal that tracks
special education cases.
   ``Until a child is 22, the other state agencies can say to
school districts, `Tough, it's your problem.' And the judges don't
care who is paying. They just enforce the law,'' she said.
   Dover says Wilson County officials have pleaded with various
state agencies for financial help for Beth Ann _ so far to no avail.
   Buchanan, Beth Ann's attorney, says he is confident she will win
the right to stay at Cedarbrook at public expense.
   ``What's the alternative? Throw Beth Ann Brown out on the
street?'' he asked. ``In all honesty, there was just no
alternative.''

<HEAD>First Big Wave of Drug-Exposed Youngsters Enter Kindergarten</HEAD>

   The bells that toll to open American schools
this month also proclaim the arrival of something new and
troublesome _ the first big wave of children exposed to crack in
the womb.
   Many of these kids _ now entering preschool and kindergarten
classes _ have special needs, and most schools are not ready to
deal with them.
   With few exceptions, ``I don't think that schools are prepared
to handle this issue.... I'm thinking program-wise as well as
financially,'' said Samuel Sava, head of the National Association
of Elementary School Principals.
   Children who were exposed in utero to crack, other forms of
cocaine and other drugs can exhibit a wide range of symptoms,
including tremors, hyperactivity, listlessness and the inability to
organize their thinking.
   Many do not fit any special education or disability category,
and health professionals fear teachers are not being equipped to
handle their neurological, emotional and learning problems.
   All agree that their exposure to drugs, coupled with unsettled
home lives, mean that these children need help.
   If ``solid early-childhood education'' is not provided, ``these
children may not survive,'' said Joan Altshuler, an education
diagnostician with the Hillsborough County, Fla., schools, which is
working to teach these children.
   Each year, an estimated 375,000 American children are born
having been exposed to cocaine and other drugs while in the womb.
Of those, about 200,000 are believed to have traces of crack in
their system at birth.
   No one knows exactly how many of these kids are about to enter
school. When the incoming kindergarten and preschool class was
born, the numbers of crack babies were smaller _ the epidemic was
in its early stages.
   But educators say it is clear that the number of crack kids is
about to take a quantum leap, and those numbers will escalate in
coming years.
   ``We are just now beginning to recognize how we must work with
these children,'' said Sava, noting that studies show drug-exposed
youngsters may soon comprise 40 percent to 60 percent of inner-city
school populations.
   Some districts are preparing. Educators in Fulton County, Ga.,
spent the summer providing teacher training workshops focused on
these children.
   Ohio has formed a special task force on drug-exposed infants
with the goal of completing a resource center by 1992. Los Angeles
has a pioneering special education program in place for
drug-exposed kids.
   Hillsborough County intends to educate these kids in regular
classes. Kindergarten teachers will attend workshops to help them
identify drug-exposed youngsters and to learn how best to teach
them.
   Teachers are taught to use masking tape to create work spaces on
tables, glue footprints on the floor to show line up areas, and
tack a calendar at a child's eye-level so children can know what
activities to expect.
   Altshuler said most drug-exposed youngsters are not well
organized and can be easily confused by having too many things
going on at once. They require structure to overcome the chaotic
and transient nature of the drug environment in which many still
live.
   Care also must be taken not to overstimulate them because they
might misbehave or be ``too overwhelmed to focus in on any one
task.''
   Teachers are asked not to put too many things on the walls, to
limit the number of books and games piled on shelves and to have
activities planned for virtually every minute of the day.
   ``These children can't wait. They need to know what to do. It
may be `get a book and look at it, and then we'll go to lunch.'
They can't have any lags in their day. Teachers have to be `on' at
all times,'' Altshuler said.
   She acknowledged ``there's nothing earthshaking about these
suggestions,'' and that the techniques would not adversely affect
other students.
   ``Philosophically, we want these children to stay in regular
education. We're not talking about children with tremendous
physical, neurological and mental disabilities,'' she said.
   Sam is one of those children _ he has eye problems and trouble
retaining what he has learned. One day he will count; the next day
he will forget how.
   He is 5 years old, and he is one of seven students in the
graduating class at the Operation PAR Child Development and Family
Guidance Center in St. Petersburg. Sam is energetic. He loves the
center, and he responds eagerly to the staff's quick hugs and ready
smiles.
   At first, it's difficult to tell that Sam and his 5-year-old
friend Tom _ who has difficulty controlling his emotions _ have
developmental problems that will require them to spend some time in
special education after graduation.
   Many of the kids have learned the alphabet and numbers through
music. Sam and Tom bounce right along to the reggae beat of the
blaring music as teacher Alice Bradley sings out the numbers
printed on cards they hold.
   ``These children aren't different than any other children,
except for the mood swings,'' said teacher Eula Hollaway.
   The center opened in June 1988, mainly to provide free child
care for women seeking help with drug addiction. But it soon became
a vital part of these children's lives, and program director
Shirley Davis worries about their future once they enter public
schools.
   ``Florida has the highest dropout rate in the country, as it is.
We're going to send them off to school and I'm not sure we're going
to put them in places where people will really attend to the
problems that these kids have and that they will really work on
these children,'' she said.
   Teachers may ``hear the words `cocaine baby' and they have this
preconceived notion that these children cannot learn and therefore,
we don't teach them.''
   ``Sometimes I get really upset when educators come to us and
say, `What do they look like?' '' Davis said. ``When you see these
children, they look like everybody. They are our children. ... We
want them to look like Quasimodo so we can label them and put them
over in the corner.''
   Operation PAR President Shirley Coletti, who founded the program
20 years ago when she learned one of her four teen-agers was
experimenting with drugs, says it's important ``to talk about
hopefulness, instead of hopelessness.''
   There is reason to believe that in time, whatever disabilities
these children have will subside, she said.
   ``I think it's going to require a tremendous amount of training
on the part of the pre-kindergarten, kindergarten and first-grade
teachers. We must have research dollars to do some longer-term
studies ... Otherwise, I think you're going to see a lot of
terribly discouraged teachers,'' she said.
   Money is a major concern. The Florida Department of Human
Resources estimates that it would cost $40,000 per child per year
to provide all the services each child needs up to school age. And
no one has estimated the cost once the children are in school.
   Altshuler stressed that the government and other policy-makers
must take steps to reduce classroom size and provide other
assistance. For those teachers and educators who gripe about the
responsibilities, she has a simple message:
   ``It's your job to teach the child. It's your job to accept
them, the positives and negatives, and concentrate on the strengths
of the child and go from there. We can't put everybody in special
education. So we better find what we're going to do in our
classrooms.''

<HEAD>Donna Mills Returns to Comedy After 9 Years as `Knots Landing'
Vixen</HEAD>

   Donna Mills sheds her vamp image in a CBS
movie in which she plays a successful lawyer who loses so many
secretaries to wedding bells that she finally hires a man for the
job.
   Of course, she ends up seeking her own wedding bells after she
falls in love with him.
   ``The World's Oldest Living Bridesmaid,'' to be shown Friday,
Sept. 21, is the first of a four-movie deal between CBS and Miss
Mills, who spent nine years as temptress Abby Ewing on CBS'
``Knot's Landing.'' She left the series last season.
   ``She's been a bridesmaid in so many weddings,'' Miss Mills said
of her character in the CBS movie. ``She's never been married, and
until now she hasn't ever wanted to get married. Finally, she meets
the right guy and falls in love. The problem is he's on a lower
social and economic order and he's younger.
   ``He has no problem dealing with that, but she does. He works as
a secretary because he's an artist and sculptor who's never sold
anything. I go to London to try an international case and take my
secretary with me _ that's where the romance begins.''
   Joe Scanlon directed the movie on location in Toronto and London
from a script by Janet Kovalcik. It co-stars Ann Magnuson and Brian
Wimmer, a regular on ABC's ``China Beach.''
   ``I was known as a vamp primarily from `Knots Landing,''' Miss
Mills said. ``I didn't do any movies like that. I didn't want to
get typecast as the vixen. But I think most people know me from
`Knots.' They know that I can do that well. But they don't know if
I can do other things. I hope to prove it.''
   Miss Mills said she has had talks about doing another series,
and would prefer to do a half-hour one.
   ``People forget I used to do comedy,'' she said. ``Larry Hagman
and I did `The Good Life' on NBC in 1971-72. After that, I was
offered only comedy. I didn't want to get typecast as a comedy
actress, but then I was typecast as a dramatic actress.''
   Miss Mills credits Burt Reynolds with launching her career. She
did a guest part on his series ``Dan August'' and his
recommendation to Clint Eastwood got her a role in ``Play Misty For
Me.''
   The other movies she has in development for CBS are ``Runaway
Father,'' ``Lipstick on His Collar'' and ``Into the Darkness.''
   She's also working on a television movie titled ``West End,''
which would focus on three women in an emerging cable television
empire _ a young anchorwoman, a talk show hostess and an ambitious
television news producer. The latter character would be played by
Miss Mills.
   If that's not enough, she's involved in a number of other
projects _ on both sides of the camera.
   She currently is raising money for a six- to eight-hour
miniseries she wants to produce called ``A Pride of Royals.''
   ``We'll film it in Russia in a co-production with the Soviet
Union,'' she said. ``They'll provide services such as hotels,
transportation, the cameras, the horses and equipment. They're very
anxious to do that sort of thing.
   ``It's based on a novel by Justin Scott about an attempt by King
George V of England and Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany to get Czar
Nicholas II out of Russia before the Communist Revolution. It's a
real adventure story. The only American in it will be a Naval
commander. He falls in love with a Russian ballerina.
   ``I don't think it will go to a network,'' she said. ``They're
not very big on costume drama.''
   Miss Mills may take a role in another miniseries, to be based on
a book by Barbara Taylor Bradford and filmed in Europe. She turned
down the lead because it would require three months overseas, she
said.
   In addition, the actress is developing a television series
called ``Riverside Drive'' in which she would not appear.
   ``We'll shoot it in New York because the look is important to
the story,'' she said. ``It's about five families who live on
Riverside Drive and are linked together by their Hispanic maid.
They'll all be from different economic levels.''
   On the domestic front, Miss Mills is busy having her house
painted to look like Claude Monet's home in Giverny, France.
   ``It's pink with green shutters and white trim,'' she said.
``It's a very country house. It was white, and it needed to be
painted. One of my hobbies is doing over houses.''

   By morning, the storm had passed, and the parking lot filled
with people for the dedication ceremony. The black plastic covering
the monument was gone, replaced by red, white and blue bunting. The
speakers' platform groaned under the weight of dignitaries, and the
23rd Army band played rousing military tunes.
   Paul Tibbets rose to speak, and the crowd gave him a standing
ovation. At 75, he is hard of hearing and walks stiffly, but he
held their respect as if he still were their commanding officer.
   Be not ashamed for bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he told those
gathered. Nuclear weaponry has ``caused peace to reign ... for 45
years,'' he said.
   The United States was fighting a war against an entrenched
enemy, he said. If Allied forces had been forced to invade Japan,
perhaps a million lives would have been lost, he said, compared
with the estimated 180,000 who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   Americans today often don't appreciate the sacrifices that
ensured our present good fortune, he said.
   ``They don't want to exercise their brains by reading about what
happened in those days. Well, that leaves some of us to tell them
what happened. Hopefully, they will remember it,'' he said.
   Then Tibbets unveiled the memorial, a 16-foot granite obelisk
supporting a bronze replica of the Enola Gay. Below was a plaque
with the logo of the 509th Composite Group, a lightning bolt and
the phrase ``First Atomic Bombardment.''
   For a peace monument, it was strikingly martial. But then, so
was the ceremony. Little mention was made of the victims. A
Japanese author had been scheduled to speak, but he was quickly
un-scheduled the previous night _ along with the Japanese national
anthem _ after suggesting Japan might have surrendered without the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings.
   The Rev. William B. Downey, 509th chaplain, closed the ceremony
with a dedicatory prayer:
   ``We thank thee, God, for the atom bomb, through which peace
came to our world.''
   A squadron of jet fighters thundered overhead and the band
struck up another tune. Tibbets and other crew members of the Enola
Gay were corraled for pictures in front of the obelisk.
   Suddenly, Richard Sherwood was there, too, smiling and shaking
Tibbets' hand. Sherwood shouted a few words, but Tibbets could not
hear above the crowd. He gave Sherwood a puzzled look, then turned
again toward the cameras.
   For a moment, the hawk and the dove stood together. Despite
their differences, they have a common bond in their conviction that
the world must never forget the lessons of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   But just what is that lesson?
   Peace comes through strength, says Tibbets.
   Peace comes through understanding, says Sherwood.
   It is clear which message won this day. Tibbets was the hero.
Sherwood was in the way. A camera-toting woman shouted, ``The crew,
just the crew,'' and Sherwood retreated into the crowd, an observer
once again.

<HEAD>`Today' Chief Optimistic, but `Good Morning America' Still No. 1</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As millions of viewers grumble their way back
from summer vacations, NBC's ``Today'' show, armed with Faith, hope
and a new set, will attempt to rebound from The Great Debacle of
1989-90.
   The new set, featuring a kitchen and large transparent
photographs of various American scenes, premieres Monday.
   As for the show, its executive producer, Tom Capra, thinks the
worst is over and the ratings slide halted since the June additions
of Faith Daniels as news anchor and ``Today'' returnee Joe
Garagiola as a third co-anchor working with Bryant Gumbel and
Deborah Norville.
   But not even Capra predicts a quick return to the No. 1 ratings
status ``Today'' lost to ABC's ``Good Morning America'' in January
after the exit of the popular Jane Pauley and the arrival of
Norville.
   ``I think it'll take quite a while,'' said the producer, who was
brought in last January with seemingly simple marching orders:
``Fix it.''
   But nothing is simple in the world of the Morning Wars, where a
few ratings points can mean millions of dollars in losses or
profits, where revolving-door casting has jolted NBC and CBS into
the headlines, where ABC glories in its resurrection while
brandishing a new weapon _ a geography correspondent.
   ``Today'' hired Garagiola to give the show a feeling of
``family'' again. But even with the avuncular former catcher,
``Today'' suffered a summer week it would prefer to forget _ a 2.9
rating, its lowest in seven years.
   It has edged upwards since then. Still, ``Today'' ratings for
the period from January to mid-August are down 17 percent from last
year, according to Nielsen. Those of ``Good Morning America'' rose
by 10 percent, and third-place ``CBS This Morning'' also went up
slightly, by 4 percent.
   One week in May, CBS' show _ traditionally the morning doormat _
even beat ``Today'' in New York, the nation's largest TV market.
   ``Today'' had begun to slide in the ratings last summer before
the elevation of Norville, first as the show's news reader, then in
January as co-anchor with Gumbel. The perception by some viewers
that the 32-year-old Norville had somehow muscled the 40-year-old
Pauley aside made things worse.
   In June, NBC affiliates heard a frank ``we screwed up'' from NBC
News chief Michael Gartner. A month later, he admitted the ratings
slide may cost NBC $10 million and its affiliates an equal amount
by year's end.
   When would ``Today'' recapture the Nielsen championship from its
ABC rival? ``It's going to be many months,'' Capra said.
   He grinned. ``You can lose an audience a lot faster than you can
gain one. We certainly have have proved that. But we seem to have
stopped the (ratings) hemorrhaging here.''
   With Gumbel last month spending a week in Saudi Arabia,
anchoring his part of the show as part of NBC's coverage of the
Persian Gulf crisis, ``the ratings have settled out and are
creeping ahead a little,'' Capra said.
   But in the opinion of Betsy Frank, senior vice president of
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Advertising, the worst isn't over yet for
``Today.''
   ``It doesn't seem to have recovered,'' she said. Yes, she says,
the ratings rose in recent weeks, as they have for the show's two
network rivals, but that is largely due to public interest in the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   She says ``The particular drama of what happened on the `Today'
show last winter should have passed by now. Yet its ratings have
continued to decline while those of `Good Morning America' continue
to grow.''
   Erik Sorenson, executive producer of ``CBS This Morning,''
smells ``Today'' blood. ``We're very much in striking distance and
in some markets we're actually beating them,'' says Sorenson.
   His show debuted in November 1987 with the anchor team of Harry
Smith and Kathleen Sullivan. Although but a tyke compared to the
38-year-old ``Today'' and 15-year-old ``Good Morning America,'' the
CBS show already has had its shakeups.
   The major one was the replacement of Sullivan by ABC graduate
Paula Zahn last February. But the show also has added six new
contributors, including film reviewer Gene Siskel and sports
reporter Greg Gumbel, older brother of you-know-who.
   The show now has ``more diversity in the segments than there
used to be,'' Sorenson says. ``There are more entertainment
segments, more celebrity segments, and more pieces from
contributors.''
   Interestingly, there's been some change over at ``Good Morning
America.'' There are fewer celebrity interviews, even though the
show is produced by ABC's entertainment division, not its news
division.
   ``We still do them ... but not tve done it in
the past,'' says Jack Reilly, GMA's executive producer.
   The reason: A star blur of sorts that has come with o the degree we'the
growth
of cable, where celebrity interviewees are often found when not
being grilled by Connie Chung, Barbara Walters or a producer from
``Entertainment Tonight.''
   Star interviews used to be ``much more exclusive to morning
television'' 10 years ago, Reilly said.
   But ``now you hear that Arnold Schwarzenegger has a new movie
and you go, `Where did I see him? I don't know if I saw him on
``Good Morning America'' or ``Entertainment Tonight'' or CNN's

   Oil prices rebounded from their tumultuous
slide, rising almost $1 per barrel as traders speculated on
diplomatic efforts to resolve the Middle East crisis.
   Traders also were monitoring OPEC discussions Tuesday that could
lead to higher crude production, offsetting the shortfall caused by
the international boycott of Iraq and Kuwait.
   The price of light sweet crude, the benchmark U.S. grade of oil,
rose 97 cents to $27.88 per barrel for October contracts on the New
York Mercantile Exchange.

<HEAD>As Air Bag Use Rises, Automakers Find Drivers Care About Safety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN L. ADLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whether just the latest advertising strategy or a
genuine concern for driver safety, U.S. automakers are touting air
bags, motorized seat belts and anti-lock brakes in selling cars.
   Europeans carmakers have used safety as a sales pitch for years.
Now that the federal government is ordering passive restraint
systems in all U.S.-built cars, automakers believe it pays to
advertise safety.
   ``Initially, it was tough getting customers to talk about
safety,'' Chrysler Corp. spokesman Tony Cervone said Tuesday. ``It
becomes a discriminating factor in buying a car now.''
   Chrysler, which has trumpeted the planned production today of
its one millionth air-bag equipped car, hits safety hard in radio
advertisments calling the air bag ``an incentive that just might
save your life.''
   Air bags are standard in all model 1990 U.S.-built cars at
Chrysler, the first of the Big Three to commit to the device. Air
bags for Chrysler's popular minivans are about two model years
away, Cervone said.
   General Motors Corp. announced Monday it will equip all
U.S.-built passenger cars with driver's-side air bags by the fall
of 1995, but the company has yet to work them into safety-related
advertising.
   Donald Postma, spokesman for GM Technical Staffs, said the
upscale Cadillac division is expected to be the first to promote
air bags.
   Ford Motor Co. has air bags in about half its U.S.-built
vehicles, but the company doesn't go to lengths to promote them or
motorized passive restraint seat belts.
   Under federal law, all cars made in the United States after
Sept. 1, 1989, must have either an air bag or automatic seat belt
for drivers and front-seat passengers. GM's announcement to go with
air bags reversed initial plans to install motorized seat belts in
most of its cars.
   According to Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in
Arlington, Va., air bags were equipped in 1 percent of the
estimated 10 million 1987 model cars sold in the United States,
including imports sold here. By 1996, 90 percent of cars are
expected to have air bags, the institute said.
   European carmakers Mercedes Benz, BMW and Volkswagen long have
incorporated safety promotion into advertising, in part because
buyers of their more expensive vehicles could be counted on to ask
such questions.
   ``When you deal with a small market niche such as ours is in the
United States, you have to be very attentive to what customers say
they want in a car,'' said John Chuhran, a spokesman for Mercedes
Benz of North America in Montvale, N.J.
   In one 30-second television commercial, Mercedes, which sells
about 75,000 cars a year in the United States, promotes its
standard safety features.
   ``Of course you want a safe car for your family. But what is
safe? Well, only your authorized Mercedes-Benz dealer offers (a) .
. . system with driver's-side air bag and anti-lock brakes on every
new model. Standard. That's safe,'' the announcer says.
   Postma said GM's initial objection to air bags was based on
research showing that drivers would ignore manual seat belts, which
must be used in conjunction with an air bag to make the device
effective.
   ``What we are looking at now is that air bags have come of
age,'' Postma said. ``People indicate they want them. We have
worked on them enough so we know that they are reliable.''
   An air bag, usually concealed in the steering wheel or beneath
the driver's side dashboard, inflates upon a head-on impact or one
30 degrees to the left or right of center of the steering wheel.
   Chrysler doesn't emphasize seat-belt use as a major part of its
air bag promotion. But Cervone said: ``An air bag is a supplemental
safety device. It's there in all the (advertising) copy. It's not
going to be the headline.''
   Mercedes Benz's Chuhran said: ``In terms of advertising, safety
is a relative term. There is no such thing as an absolutely safe
automobile.''

<HEAD>Futures Regulators Consider Rules Changes After Stotler Collapse</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Following the collapse of Stotler Group Inc.,
federal futures regulators are going to look into new ways for
handling the liquidation of a brokerage's customer accounts.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Tuesday it would
develop procedures for how to handle bulk transfers or liquidations
of customer accounts in unusual circumstances such as the cessation
or suspension of a brokerage's business.
   Such a rapid decline came last week as Stotler Group Inc., a
firm once linked with former Chicago Board of Trade Chairman
Karsten ``Cash'' Mahlmann, announced it was filing for liquidation
under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
   Previously, Stotler Group was forced into involuntary bankruptcy
reorganization by some of the commodity funds it managed. Those
funds claimed Stotler owed them millions of dollars in unredeemed
loans and investments.
   On July 31, the CFTC filed fraud charges against a Stotler
subsidiary, Stotler Funds Inc., accusing it of misusing $5 million
customer funds by lending it to the cash-strapped parent company.
   A day later Mahlmann resigned as head of Stotler Group and as
chairman of the world's largest futures exchange. He has not been
accused of any wrongdoing.
   Last week, the CFTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which oversees the stock and bond markets, filed separate
administrative actions against another Stotler subsidiary, Stotler
and Co.. They accused the subsidiary of failing to maintain enough
net capital, the minimum amount of cash and assets to offset risks.
   Stotler and Co. settled the CFTC action and late last week said
it was offering to settle with the SEC without admitting or denying
any wrongdoing.
   In a statement Friday, Stotler President Thomas M. Eagan said it
was ``now in the best interests of all creditors that the further
administration of these companies' affairs be handled in an orderly
manner by the bankruptcy court.''
   The CFTC's trading and markets division, which will research how
such situations should be handled in the future, is scheduled to
present its findings next year.
   The proposed rules change was announced at a regular CFTC
meeting to consider quarterly objectives.

   When they ask if you want ``light sweet'' in the
oil trading business, they're not talking about a coffee break.
   Light sweet is a generic term that can be used for a variety of
crude oils traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a leading
petroleum market, although traders often erroneously refer to the
mix as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, the benchmark U.S. crude.
   The Mercantile Exchange has sought to change this entrenched
habit, partly by insisting that traders use ``light sweet'' instead
of WTI. But old ways die hard.
   ``It's WTI,'' said John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation in New York. ``WTI is the oil traded
on the Merc. Practically speaking, it is WTI.''
   Advised of the Merc's position on what the oil should be called,
Lichtblau said any label used by the exchange is ``sort of
irrelevant,'' because traders in that market are only speculating
on which direction oil prices will go.
   Like traders in other futures markets, oil traders rarely take
delivery of the actual oil, but gamble on its price by buying and
selling contracts for delivery in upcoming months.
   These oil-futures contracts are commonly called ``paper''
barrels. Real oil, on the other hand, comes in what the industry
calls ``wet'' barrels.
   Regardless of what they're called, Merc traders have been buying
and selling barrels of oil since 1983, when the exchange first
offered a market in crude oil futures.
   Initially, the Merc listed 13 grades that it classified as light
sweet crude. The menu is now down to seven domestics and three
foreign oils.
   Merc officials say the the most commonly traded light sweet
crude was WTI. Eventually, the contract for other crudes also
became known as WTI.
   Confusion over what is sold has led to problems, Merc officials
say. Some buyers who thought they were getting WTI have discovered
they were getting a different grade.
   The errors have become a bigger headache for the Merc officials
recently, as the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices into wild
gyrations that thrust the Merc into a larger-than-usual public
spotlight.
   In an effort to clear up any misunderstanding, the Merc sent
members a memo this week asking that they refer to light sweet
crude instead of WTI.
   WTI has for years been used as a reference point for measuring
other crudes, partly because it once was the most important grade
of crude in the lower 48 states, extracted from the Permian Basin
in West Texas. But the industry's shifting exploration to other
areas has made other grades just as prominent.
   ``Today, Alaskan North Slope crude is the most important,'' said
Bernard Picchi, a Salomon Brothers Inc. managing director who
follows domestic oils. ``A lot of people think WTI is losing
whatever relevance it once had in the industry, because we're just
running out of the stuff.''
   The foreign oils that can be included in a Merc contract are
Brent Blend, Bonny Light and Oseberg. The domestic crudes, other
than WTI, are Mid Continent Sweet, Low Sweet Mix (Scurry Snyder),
New Mexican Sweet, North Texas Sweet, Oklahoma Sweet and South
Texas Sweet.
   ``Sweet'' refers to a crude's low sulphur content, which is
desirable because it's less polluting and more cheaply refinable
than so-called high-sulphur ``sour'' grades.
   ``Light'' refers to a higher proportion of hydrogen compared
with carbon, with ``heavy'' oil often requiring an infusion of

   For anyone confused by all of this, the Merc will soon have
another item on the menu. Merc officials plan to begin trading on a
sour oil contract in about a year.

<HEAD>FTC To Appeal Ruling Clearing Way for $568 Million Deal</HEAD>

   Parties to Meredith Corp.'s planned sale
of its printing business to R.R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co. say they are
disappointed with continued government challenges to the nearly
$570 million transaction.
   A federal judge this week rejected a Federal Trade Commission
request for an order blocking the sale pending an antitrust hearing
by the FTC. The FTC then said it would appeal.
   The government raised the antitrust challenge after Meredith and
the Burda family of West Germany agreed last December to sell their
jointly held Meredith-Burda printing business to Donnelley, the
leading commercial printer in North America.
   ``Donnelley was disappointed to learn that the FTC is appealing
the court's decision,'' the company said in a statement.
``Donnelley continues to believe that the acquisition is legally
proper.''
   Donnelley, with 1989 sales of $3.12 billion, has about 6 percent
of the U.S. market for the magazine, catalog and newspaper insert
business. Meredith-Burda has about 1 percent.
   ``We continue to believe the transaction is both proper and
legal,'' Meredith President Jack Rehm said.
   Meredith and the Burdas agreed to sell the printing business for
$487.5 million in cash. Donnelley also agreed to assume $80 million
in Meredith-Burda debt.
   In July, the FTC asked U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris in
Washington to issue an order blocking the sale pending the outcome
of an antitrust hearing before the regulatory agency. Harris on
Monday refused to issue the preliminary injunction. The FTC then
said would appeal.
   Meredith has interests in publishing, broadcasting and real
estate and is best known for its Better Homes and Gardens and
Ladies' Home Journal magazines.
   Donnelley prints and binds many national publications, including
Time, Newsweek and TV Guide. It also prints telephone books,
encyclopedias and school and religious books.
   Meredith-Burda was founded in 1969 and generated just over $10
million in earnings for Meredith in the fiscal year ended June 30.
Meredith finished the the year with a $26.4 million loss,
reflecting one-time losses from the sale of discontinued television
advertising and real estate businesses.
   If the sale had been completed as planned, Meredith's share of
the proceeds would have offset the loss. Meredith said late last
year it wanted to focus on its core businesses by expanding and
strengthening its magazines, TV stations and real estate holdings.
   Meredith-Burda has printing plants in Des Moines; Newton, N.C.;
Lynchburg, Va.; and Casa Grande, Ariz. Its photo preparation
centers are in Lynchburg and at Hickory and Greensboro, N.C.

<HEAD>UAW Picks GM as Primary Target as Talks Shift Into High Gear</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National contract bargaining shifts into high
gear after the United Auto Workers union picked General Motors
Corp. as its primary target.
   Negotiators for the union and the world's largest and most
profitable automaker are working under a 17-day deadline to arrive
at a new three-year contract. About 300,000 GM workers are covered
by the contract.
   While negotiations continue on their contract, talks between the
union and Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. will creep ahead. In
all, more than 450,000 active workers are covered by the three UAW
contracts, all of which expire Sept. 14.
   GM spokesman John Maciarz said Tuesday the company was happy
with the UAW's selection and that the bargaining pace would speed
up now. He said the union and the company are close to agreement on
some non-economic issues.
   UAW President Owen Bieber said Tuesday the UAW chose GM as its
target because the automaker had more to offer the union than the
other two companies.
   Spokesmen for Ford and Chrysler said they were disappointed that
the UAW passed them over, but subcommittee meetings would continue
while talks proceed between the union and GM.
   If everything goes according to the union's plan, a contract
reached with GM will be used as a pattern for agreements with Ford
and Chrysler.
   Automakers seek to be the union's bargaining target so they can
reach an agreement more tailored to their needs. The selection of
GM as the target had been anticipated.
   One of the things analysts said may have contributed to pushing
the UAW toward choosing GM was Robert Stempel taking over as
chairman on Aug. 1. Employees hailed the selection of Stempel
because he came up through GM's engineering and marketing ranks and
is perceived as understanding them better than former chairman
Roger Smith, an accountant.
   Stempel made several upper-level management changes immediately
after taking office that shortened the lines between top executives
and GM's car- and truck-making divisions.
   When he took over, Stempel said GM was on the road back to
regaining lost market-share profitably.
   For the first half of this year, GM reported it earned $1.6
billion, down 47 percent from last year, but better than the $1.4
billion earned by Ford, down 57 percent, and the $251 million
earned by Chrysler, down 64 percent.
   Bieber said major factors in picking GM included that the
company was the only one to present a full contract proposal,
delivered last Thursday, and reports from the union's vice
presidents in charge of its GM, Ford and Chrysler departments.
   Union and company officials have declined to discuss any
company's proposal, but GM's reportedly included a 2 percent
increase in the base wage in the first year and 2 percent lump sum
payments in the next two years.
   Perhaps more important, the proposal contains no changes in
health-care coverage, a major union concern, and the company said
it was willing to discuss job security, the union's primary aim in
this set of negotiations.
   This is the first year the UAW has had common expiration dates
with all three automakers in 11 years. In 1988, the union bargained
only with Chrysler.
   In 1987, the UAW chose Ford as a target company and reached an
agreement without a strike. The last UAW walkout over a national
contract occurred in 1985, when the union staged a 12-day strike
against Chrysler.

<HEAD>Apple Plans To Introduce Cheaper Macintosh Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. plans to introduce a
lower-priced line of Macintosh personal computers in October, but
some of the machines won't be widely available until early 1991.
   John Cook, spokesman for Apple's products division, said Tuesday
that the company plans large production of the new line and wants
to ensure supply levels before market introduction.
   In introducing the new Macintoshs, Apple won't completely
discontinue its existing cheap Macintosh computers, the Macintosh
Plus and the Macintosh SE _ a move that could leave computer owners
with obsolete machines.
   ``One of the things we haven't done since 1984, when we first
introduced Macintoshes, was to obsolete anything,'' Cook said.
``You can buy a 1984 Macintosh and with a couple of upgrades run
the present software. Customers demand this.''
   Computer analysts say Apple, one of the most popular personal
computer makers, could lose market share if it doesn't get enough
of the new lower-cost machines in stores during the prime computer
buying time, November through January.
   Apple executives have been saying for months that one of their
top priorities was introducing cheaper versions of the Macintosh,
the company's mainstay product.
   But analysts have said the Cupertino-based company waited too
long to make the move. They say the company has been losing sales
to cheaper personal computers based on International Business
Machine Corp. models.
   Apple's Cook wouldn't comment on the details of the new
Macintosh line.
   According to the San Francisco Chronicle, the cheapest of the
new machines will be called the Macintosh Classic and will have a
built-in black-and-white monitor similar to that on the Macintosh
Plus and SE.
   The Mac Classic is expected to be priced between $1,300 and
$1,400, according to industry sources quoted in the article. That
compares with the $1,799 list price for a Mac Plus, the current
lowest-price Mac.
   Apple also will introduce a new low-cost color-screen model that
will be called the Macintosh LC. The color monitor will be made by
Sony Corp.
   The LC is expected to have a list price of $2,800, compared with
$4,669 for the current cheapest color Mac.
   The LC also will have room for a chip board that Apple will
introduce to allow the machine to run software designed for the
Apple II computer, which can be found in more than two-thirds of
school classrooms that are equipped with computers.
   Industry analysts have said Apple needs to find a way to allow
software written for the millions of Apple IIs to be used on the
newer Macintosh line. Otherwise, Apple II users will be reluctant
to upgrade to Macintoshes.

<HEAD>New Merv Griffin Casino Chief Faces Tough Road</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HENRY STERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Trump executive Jack O'Donnell
takes over the helm of Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel at a
time when the casino is emerging from bankruptcy and this city's
gambling market is flat.
   But O'Donnell, who quit as Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino
president in April, said he is challenged by his appointment
Tuesday as Resorts' executive vice president and chief operating
officer.
   O'Donnell replaces Al Luciani, who resigned to pursue other
interests, said David Hanlon, president and chief executive officer
of Resorts International, the casino's parent. Luciani, who leaves
office Friday, could not be reached for comment.
   Resorts, which recently reorganized under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code, has a strong future, O'Donnell said, pointing to
the casino's refurbishment and his expectation of a resurgence in
flat gaming profits in Atlantic City.
   ``Many people in this town are beginning to suffer a financial
crunch,'' O'Donnell said. ``We're starting to emerge out of it and
we're well positioned.''
   O'Donnell, who left the Trump Plaza in a difference of opinion
about Donald Trump's ``style of running the company,'' did not
appear to enjoy his former boss's recent financial troubles.
   After failing to make a payment to bondholders in June, Trump
sought permission from state gambling regulators for an emergency
$65 million bailout package. This month, the state Casino Control
Commission approved the rescue loan but threatened to revoke
licenses for Trump's three casinos unless he can demonstrate by
October proof of financial stability.
   ``Donald Trump is faced with a unique set of problems that he's
going to have to sort through in the next couple of years,''
O'Donnell said. ``I don't take any gratification from it. I'm not
out to compete against Trump.''
   Resorts is located next to Trump's Taj Mahal Casino Resort, and
Resorts officials had hoped to lure away some of the Taj clientele
after the casino's glitzy April 2 opening. O'Donnell said the
presence of the Taj Mahal could attract customers to Resorts but is
not essential to its profitability.
   ``There will be some benefit as we improve our product,'' he
said. ``People dissatisfied with the Taj Mahal will find us as an
alternative.''
   The appointment comes after the commission and U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Rosemary Gambardella on Aug. 17 approved Resorts
International's proposed restructuring of its massive debt.
   Under the plan, Resorts bondholders holding $911 million in
bonds are to receive 78.5 percent of Griffin's ownership and $434
million in new notes.
   The plan also includes a $5 million fund for bondholders to
pursue a lawsuit against Trump, if they should desire.
   Bondholders claim Trump left Resorts in poor shape when he
traded it for the Taj Mahal in 1988. Trump says Griffin bears the
responsibility for the company's indebtedness.
   For the latest quarter ending June 30, Resorts' Atlantic City
property recorded a net profit of $2.7 million on gross revenue of
$59.2 million. Overall, Resorts International posted net earnings
of $803,000 on revenues of $109.1 million for the second quarter.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Sides with RTC in Arkansas Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court says the Resolution
Trust Corp. can override an Arkansas banking law to sell insolvent
thrifts and their branches to banks. An RTC attorney said the
ruling has nationwide implications.
   On Tuesday, a three-judge panel from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals ruled 2-1 to overturn a lower court ruling that the sale
of Independence Federal Savings Bank of Batesville to Worthen Bank
and Trust Co. of Little Rock would violate Arkansas's
branch-banking law.
   That law prohibits banks from having branches outside their home
counties.
   The RTC, a government agency created to clean up insolvent
thrifts, argued that it was granted broad rule-making authority by
Congress in its mission to maximize returns and minimize the losses.
   RTC attorney Dorothy Nichols said the case had nationwide
implications because 26 states have similar laws.
   The RTC's authority to override state laws has been challenged
in New Mexico and Colorado, RTC spokesman Steve Katsanos said. A
district court judge in New Mexico sided with the RTC earlier this
year, he said.
   In Colorado, a hearing on the case is scheduled Sept. 5,
Katsanos said. The District Court there has issued a restraining
order to keep the RTC from going ahead with any transaction that
would involve overriding Colorado state law.
   Tuesday's appeals court ruling was welcomed by Worthen President
and Chairman Curt Bradbury.
   ``We consider today's ruling to be a significant victory for the
taxpayers of the United States,'' he said.
   ``We are strongly committed to assisting in the resolution of
the S&amp;L crisis in Arkansas and consider our opportunity to purchase
Independence to be a beneficial stabilizing force for the
financial-services segment of our economy,'' Bradbury said.
   The acquisition would bring assets of Worthen's parent company,
Worthen Banking Corp., to $2.1 million, according to a news release
from Worthen. That would make it the largest bank holding company
in the state.
   In arguments before the appellate court, the RTC's Nichols
argued that most of Independence's branch offices would be shut
down by the RTC if the institution were sold piecemeal.
   ``The most valuable assets of S&amp;Ls in dire straits aren't their
loan portfolios,'' she said. ``The most valuable asset of a failed
thrift is its branches.''
   Arkansas State Bank Commissioner Bill J. Ford argued that the
state's 1988 branching law, which would permit statewide branches
gradually over 10 years, was necessary to ensure fair competition.
   Ford and the Arkansas Independent Bankers Association had filed
suit June 28 to block the proposed sale to Worthen.
   Tuesday's opinion overruling a decision by U.S. District Judge
Stephen M. Reasoner of Little Rock was written by Circuit Judge
John R. Gibson for Circuit Judge Frank J. Magill.
   Senior Circuit Judge Gerald W. Heaney dissented. He agreed with
Arkansas officials that the RTC's regulation referred only to the
ability of the savings associations to operate branches and not to
the ability of a bank to retain and operate branches.
   At issue is an RTC regulation that permits banks making
emergency acquisitions of insolvent thrifts such as Independence to
operate the branches of the thrift as bank branches. Independence
has 20 branches in 15 counties.

<HEAD>FundAmerica To Challenge $8.2 Million Fine For Alleged Violations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>IRVINE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FundAmerica Inc. said it was challenging
an $8.2 million fine for alleged securities violations levied by
the Florida comptroller.
   The Irvine-based buying club accused of operating a pyramid
scheme also said Tuesday it has filed court papers challenging the
Florida attorney general's decision to stop it from conducting
business in that state.
   ``We want to move to get both these actions into the courts as
quickly as possible,'' said Mitchell G. Blumberg, the company's
president and chief executive.
   ``The serious nature of the charges made by the Attorney General
and Comptroller deserve to be heard in a court, where we will have
an impartial forum and all the legal remedies and rights available
to us under the law,'' he added.
   FundAmerica said it had filed papers with the Florida State
Circuit Court in Miami challenging the state attorney general's
motion to forbid FundAmerica from doing business in Florida.
   Florida officials have accused FundAmerica's founder, Robert T.
Edwards, of allegedly bilking $8.2 million from Florida members of
the buying club. Edwards and FundAmerica have denied the
accusations.
   FundAmerica has about 100,000 members.
   But critics say its discounts on goods and services are
available free through other channels or are subsidized by its
membership fees and complain it uses high-pressure tactics to sell
memberships.
   FundAmerica announced Monday it had overhauled its sales
procedures to curb alleged sales abuses and had begun talks with
regulators in two of the eight states in which it has conducted
business.
   ``We are trying to sort out our problems and resolve the
regulatory, legal and business challenges we face,'' Blumberg said.
``New management is committed to making sure we are or are getting
into compliance in the states in which we operate and to resume
operations as soon as practicable.''
   On Aug. 17, FundAmerica filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection from creditors. That action followed a $150 million
class-action lawsuit against FundAmerica filed July 24 in federal
court in San Francisco.

   The stock market was little changed in light
trading today as traders awaited developments in the Persian Gulf.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 2.47 to 2,612.38
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   But gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 630 up, 548
down and 468 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 35.50 million shares at
midmorning.
   Over the last couple of days, analysts say, stocks appear to
have found an equilibrium level pending further events in the
showdown that has followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed on increased production quotas to compensate for
the absence of shipments from Iraq and Kuwait.
   The news initially sent oil prices lower. But it was unclear how
much lasting effect that might have on the worldwide oil market.
   Doubts persisted, too, about the outlook for the domestic
economy. The Commerce Department reported that its index of leading
economic indicators was unchanged in July.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose &lsqb; to 45&lsqb;;
General Motors gained &rsqb; to 40|; American Express lost &lsqb; to 23{, and
McDonald's was down { at 27&rsqb;.
   Long Island Lighting added &rsqb; to 19{. The company raised its
quarterly dividend from 25 cents a share to 37.5 cents a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks dropped .10
to 176.36. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laura Ashley Holdings PLC will sell a 15 percent
stake in itself to a Japanese retailing group for $58.3 million,
the company Wednesday.
   The British retailer said it would sell 35.2 million newly
issued shares of its stock to the Aeon Group of Japan for 29.9
million pounds. The price represented a 73 percent premium over
what its shares closed at Tuesday.
   The agreement is being carried out through Aeon's British
subsidiary Jusco Co. Ltd.
   Laura Ashley will also sell 53 percent of its equity in its U.S.
retailing subsidiary, Revman Industries Inc., the companies said.
   Aeon will take 48 percent and Revman management 5 percent. The
deal values the whole of Revman at $35 million, they said, and
leaves Laura Ashley with a 47 percent stake.
   Laura Ashley lost 4.6 million pounds, or $8.97 million, before
taxes for the year ended Jan. 27. It also reported debts of about
100 million pounds, or $195 million, and did not recommend a final
share dividend.
   Jusco Chairman and Chief Executive Takuya Okada said the Aeon
Group's stake ``will contribute to the improvement of Laura
Ashley's financial position and to the stabilization of the
business.''
   Aeon will pay 85 pence, or $1.65, a share in cash for the 15
percent stake in Laura Ashley. This represents a 73 percent premium
over Tuesday's closing price for the stock on the London Stock
Exchange.
   The two companies agreed to extend their Japanese and Asian
retail joint venture, Laura Ashley Japan Co. Ltd.
   Aeon will increase its stake in the joint venture to 60 percent
from 50 percent, although Laura Ashley will retain control of brand
names and receive increased royalties.
   Laura Ashley Holdings has 171 shops in Britain and total of 460
worldwide. It also manufactures furniture, wallpaper and other
furnishings, and much of the clothing it sells.

   Grain and soybean futures were mixed in early
trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders say there is not much news to spur movement in the
market in either direction. Recently, the market has been heavily
influenced by the crisis in the Middle East and by the fortunes of
the energy and precious metals markets.
   The hot, dry conditions in the fields are putting pressure on
corn and soybean futures. The weather is seen as beneficial to
those crops.
   Wheat prices are getting some support from news the U.S.
Agriculture Department will boost the amount of wheat in the food
security reserve.
   In early trading, wheat was 1 cent lower to 2 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in September at $2.80 a bushel; corn was
a { cent lower to a \ cent higher with September at $2.54} a
bushel; oats were a { cent to } cent lower with September at $1.20{
a bushel; soybeans were } cent lower to a { cent higher with
September at $6.19} a bushel.
   Livestock futures were down and pork futures were mixed in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were pushed lower by sluggish retail beef
demand.
   Pork futures were pressured by lower-than-expected cash hog
prices, along with expectations of increased hog marketings. Pork
belly prices were pushed lower by lighter-than-expected drawdown of
frozen belly stocks last week.
   Live cattle were .10 cent to .60 cent lower with October at
76.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .40 cent lower to .08 cent
higher with August at 88.65 cents a pound; hogs were .05 cent lower
to .22 cent higher with October at 48.57 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .08 cent to .30 cent higher with February at 52.45

   The government said today its main forecasting
gauge of future economic activity was flat in July, indicating
widespread weakness in the U.S. economy even before the Persian
Gulf crisis increased the chances of a recession.
   The Commerce Department said the lack of any change in the Index
of Leading Economic Indicators followed revised gains of 0.1
percent in June and 0.6 percent in May.
   But analysts said they expected a steep drop in August because
of the oil price spike and consumer jitters spurred by fears of war
in the Middle East following the Aug.2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Typically, three consecutive declines in the index are viewed as
a fairly reliable, although not infallible, signal that the economy
is headed for a recession.
   Following Iraq's invasion, many economists believe a recession
is looming, as an already sluggish U.S. economy falls victim to
rising inflation and consumer worries about a possible war.
   In another economic report today, the Commerce Department said
sales of new homes fell 2.3 percent in July, giving up half of
their gain the previous month. The government said new home sales
totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 548,000 after
advancing a revised 4.7 percent in June.
   While the leading index normally forecasts economic activity six
to nine months in advance, some analysts believe the next recession
may start sooner, with the most pessimistic believing the country
may already be in a downturn.
   Already, the stock market, one of the components which makes up
the index, has staged a sharp retreat and consumer confidence is on
the skids.
   ``Initial reports from the University of Michigan (which
measures consumer sentiment for Commerce) indicate that the
consumer's first reaction to the Iraqi invasion was near panic,''
according to economist Mark M. Zandi of Regional Financial
Associates in West Chester, Pa.
   ``The sentiment index fell 15 points (more than after the 1987
stock market crash) to a level consistent with previous
recessions,','' he said. ``Although sentiment has likely improved
in recent days ... the risks of a consumer retrenchment are
rising.''
   Since consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's
economic activity, many analysts fear the Persian Gulf crisis could
cause further retrenchment leading to a recession.
   However, after falling in May and June, the consumer index rose
slightly in July. Other positive contributors to the index were an
increase in orders for new plants and equipment and an increase in
the price of raw materials.
   Negative contributors were faster business delivery times, a
decline in the money supply, a drop in manufacturers' unfilled
orders, a shorter average workweek, a drop in building permits, an
increase in weekly unemployment claims and a decline in the stock
market.
   One of the components, orders for consumer goods, was unchanged.
   The various changes left the index at 146.1 percent of its 1982
base of 100 and up 1.4 percent from its level a year ago.
   If a recession can be avoided through November, the economic
expansion, already the nation's longest in peacetime, will have
reached its eighth anniversary.
   But it has been growing sluggishly for two years and some
analysts contend that, if the economy is not in a recession now, it
soon will be.
   ``The U.S. economy was stagnating well before the Persian Gulf
crisis,'' Merrill Lynch economists wrote in their Weekly Economic &amp;
Financial Commentary. They noted the economy grew at a meager 1.2
percent annual rate in the second quarter and said third-quarter
indicators so far ``have been uniformly weak.''
   ``For July,'' they said, ``employment declined, industrial
production was flat, retail sales did not keep pace with inflation,
and housing starts dropped to the lowest level since 1982 _ and
that covered the period before the Persian Gulf crisis.''
   Consumer spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity and economists worry that a major cutback could halt
economic growth altogether and even push the nation into recession.
   Even before the invasion, many analysts were citing consumer
concerns over rising interest rates, a lack of job growth, high
levels of debt, the savings and loan crisis and other adverse
economic news.
   ``Consumer spending is only up about 1 percent year over year,''
said Merrill Lynch's Bruce Steinberg. ``That is typical of a
recession.''
   Since then, numerous polls have shown consumers growing even
more cautious. Just Monday, the New York-based Conference Board
reported its survey of 5,000 households nationwide showed
confidence plummeted nearly 18 points to a seven-year low of 83.8
in August. The index had remained virtually unchanged at 101.7 in
July.
   ``A war situation causes consumer confidence to fall'' explained
Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.
``People become unwilling to take on major responsibilities like
buying a new house.''
   In addition, the surge in oil prices forces individuals to spend
more for gasoline and heating costs and leaves them with less
discretionary income for such items as cars and refrigerators.
   And with major sectors such as automobiles and housing already
weak, analysts say it would not take much of a shove to force the
economy into a decline.

   The stock market eked out a small gain in light
trading today as traders awaited developments in the Persian Gulf.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.24 to 2,616.09 by
noontime on Wall Street.
   But gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 5 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 732 up, 515
down and 511 unchanged.
   Over the last couple of days, analysts say, stocks appear to
have found an equilibrium level pending further events in the
showdown that has followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Most oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed on increased production quotas to compensate for
the absence of shipments from Iraq and Kuwait.
   The news initially sent oil prices lower. Crude oil futures for
October delivery fell more than $1.50 a barrel to just above $26 on
the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   But it was unclear how much lasting effect the OPEC plan might
have on the worldwide oil market.
   Doubts persisted, too, about the outlook for the domestic
economy. The Commerce Department reported that its index of leading
economic indicators was unchanged in July.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose &lsqb; to 45&lsqb;;
General Motors gained &rsqb; to 40|; American Express lost \ to 23&rsqb;, and
McDonald's was down { at 27&rsqb;.
   Long Island Lighting added &rsqb; to 19{. The company raised its
quarterly dividend from 25 cents a share to 37.5 cents a share.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed stocks rose .56 to
176.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was
up .89 at 322.67.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 53.56 million shares at

   OPEC's oil ministers today approved a
plan allowing Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other member countries to
pump more oil and help hold down crude prices during the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   Iran refused to back the deal, and Iraq and Libya did not show
up for the meeting of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita predicted the
agreement could free up to an additional 3 million barrels of oil a
day.
   An international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude has wiped 4
million barrels a day off world markets and caused oil prices to
skyrocket. The U.N. sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The extra oil from OPEC ``should be primarily directed toward
the countries of the Third World which are those that will be most
immediately and adversely affected by any supply disruption,'' the
cartel said in a statement.
   Oil prices, which soared last week above $30 a barrel, have
dropped slightly in anticipation of greater OPEC production.
   In late morning trading today on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, October contracts for light sweet crude dropped $1.83 to
$26.05 per barrel. Futures contracts for other months were also
down.
   Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the finance minister for the Kuwaiti
government-in-exile, said the added flow of oil should help
stabilize prices.
   ``We simply cannot accept that the countries that came to our
help in the gulf should suffer,'' he said.
   ``We cannot accept that prices go up because of Iraqi aggression
and occupation of our country,'' said the official, who was his
government's oil minister until July.
   In opposing the deal, Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh
said Western industrialized nations must draw down some of their
oil stocks before seeking help from the cartel.
   ``After that we can do something,'' he said.
   He said Iran, one of OPEC's leading producers, will not increase
output above its quota of 3.1 million barrels a day. Analysts say
it's unclear how much more Iran could produce because of the heavy
damage inflicted on its oil industry during an eight-year war with
Iraq.
   But Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, the United Arab Emirates and a few
others were expected to take steps immediately to help fill the oil
gap.
   Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer left shortly after the
meeting and did not announce his country's plans.
   But earlier he said the nation will boost output by 2 million
barrels a day. Some sources say the Saudis have already lifted
production beyond its OPEC supply quota of 5.4 million barrels a
day.
   Venezuela's oil minister, Celestino Armas, said his country
could initially add an extra 300,000 barrels a day to its ceiling
of 1.9 million barrels.
   ``We are taking the position to supply another 200,000 barrels
(a day) by the end of the year,'' he said.
   The United Arab Emirates was expected to raise production by as
much as 500,000 barrels a day above its quota of 1.5 million
barrels.
   In July, all 13 nations agreed on a limit of 22.5 million
barrels a day in an effort to boost prices to $21 a barrel.
   In a statement, the cartel said it decided to ``increase
production, in accordance with need, in order to maintain'' market
stability and a regular flow of crude to consumers.
   It also urged major oil-consuming nations to draw down some of
their oil inventories.
   Ten of the 11 nations worked out the agreement early Tuesday but
delayed endorsing it to give Iraq and Libya time to act.
   Sources requesting anonymity said Iraq claimed the meeting was
held on too short notice and questioned its legality.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Toyota to Triple Non-Automotive Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's largest automobile
manufacturer, plans to triple the sales of its non-automotive
divisions by 1994, the company said Wednesday.
   Executive Vice President Masami Iwasaki made the disclosure at a
news conference where he also reported Toyota's consolidated profit
had risen 27.4 percent in its latest fiscal year.
   Iwasaki said Toyota will raise the output of its non-automotive
divisions from roughly 2 percent of its sales to 6 percent.
   Though small in percentage terms, 6 percent of Toyota's total
domestic sales would be 479.9 billion yen, or $3.1 billion, based
on the company's latest annual sales figures.
   In addition to cars, Toyota also produces industrial vehicles
such as forklifts and shovel loaders, builds homes and manufactures
factory automation equipment.
   Toyota and other Japanese automobile manufacturers have
traditionally devoted a much smaller part of their operations to
non-automobile sectors than their European or American
counterparts. The move is thought to represent Toyota's decision to
begin diversifying away from automobiles as world demand for cars
shrinks and competition intensifies.
   It also comes at the same time that American auto makers have
been selling off their non-automobile subsidiaries.
   Iwasaki said Toyota would revise its charter to permit the
company to enter new fields such as aerospace, medical equipment
and ceramics. But he said it expected greatest growth in housing,
industrial vehicles and factory automation.
   The company also announced Wednesday that its consolidated net
profit rose 27.4 percent to 441.3 billion yen, or about $2.85
billion, in the fiscal year ended June 30 from 346.3 billion yen a
year earlier.
   Its pre-tax earnings were up 33.9 percent to 837.8 billion yen,
or $5.5 billion, from 625.7 billion yen the previous year. The
consolidated statement includes 39 subsidiaries and related
companies.
   Consolidated sales totaled 9.19 trillion yen, or $60.0 billion,
up 14.6 percent from 8.02 trillion yen in sales last year.
   The manufacturer said robust domestic sales, coupled with
moderate expansion in Southeast Asia and steady growth in North
America underlined its strong showing.
   Unconsolidated exports fell 11.0 percent to 1,608,484 vehicles
for the year, while overseas production rose by 83.5 percent.
   Toyota said intensifying competition within Japan, an expected
slowdown in growth of automobile demand in the United States plus
any impact from the Middle East crisis might make it more difficult
to achieve similar results in the future.
   Nevertheless, the car maker said it plans to increase vehicle
sales within Japan by 4.0 percent and exports by 7.6 percent during
the next fiscal year.

<DATELINE>MILAN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian finance officials proposed Wednesday
to freeze prices of petroleum products for three months to fight
inflationary fallout from the Gulf crisis.
   Treasury Minister Guido Carli, Finance Minister Rino Fomica and
Budget Minister Paolo Cirino Pomicino will ask the cabinet Friday
to approve a price freeze that would go into effect from September
through November.
   The freeze is aimed at buffering the Italian economy, which is
highly oil dependent, from the impact of the higher oil prices
caused by the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   According to preliminary industry estimates, the jump in oil
prices could add a half percentage point to the inflation rate,
depending on the level of the dollar.

<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. said Wednesday that Johnathan Rodgers,
vice-president and general manager of CBS-owned WBBM-TV in Chicago,
has been named as the new president of its television stations
division.
   In that post, he will oversee CBS' five TV stations.
   Rodgers, 44, is a former news executive who has been at WBBM-TV
since March 1986. He succeeds Eric Ober, who last week became CBS
News' president after the forced resignation of David Burke. Burke
had held the job for two years.
   Rodgers, who will remain in Chicago, will be the highest-ranking
black executive at any of the three major networks. He joined CBS
in 1976 as assistant news director at WBBM.
   He worked at what now is KCBS-TV, a CBS-owned station in Los
Angeles, from 1978 to 1983, serving successively as an executive
news producer, news director and then as the station's manager.
   He later became executive producer of CBS News' ``Nightwatch,''
and then was executive producer of the ``CBS Morning News'' in 1985
before rejoining WBBM.
   Before joining CBS, Rodgers was a reporter for WKYC-TV in
Cleveland, and a news producer at WNBC-TV in New York.
   CBS Broadcast Group president Howard Stringer said in a
statement that Rodgers ``has proven himself throughout his career
at CBS to be an outstanding manager, competitor, strategist and
programmer.''
   In addition to WBBM and KCBS-TV, Rodgers will be responsible for
WCBS-TV in New York, WCIX-TV in Miami and WCAU-TV in Philadelphia.
   A native of San Antonio, Texas, he is married to former ABC News
correspondent Royal Kennedy. The couple has two children.

   Share prices finished slightly lower on London's
Stock Exchange Wednesday in quiet trading.
   Traders had expected Wall Street to drift downward during the
course of London dealing. But an about-turn in early New York
trading helped the London market to its flat finish, dealers said.
   A lack of genuine buying interest was again a main feature,
traders said.
   ``The market is in for a long stalemate,'' one trader said,
adding that volume is unlikely to pick up soon.

<HEAD>Volvo Profits Decline, Work Force to be Reduced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Swedish car maker Volvo said
Wednesday it is cutting 5,000 jobs this year and next because
profits during the first six months of 1990 have declined by half.
   A reduction in demand for cars and trucks in North America was a
major cause of the profit decline, according to Volvo's interim
report, released Wednesday.
   An 11 percent decline in domestic demand and a 17 percent drop
in the British market also contributed to the lower profits, the
report said.
   Profits dropped from 4.2 billion kronor, or $744 million, in the
first six months of 1989 to just over 2 billion kronor, or $359
million, this year, the interim report said.
   The company has already dropped 1,000 employees in the car and
truck sector this year, and plans to reduce the work force by
another 4,000 through 1991.
   The major cuts in the number of employees will be made in
Sweden, the company's executive Christer Zetterberg said in a radio
interview.
   ``It is due to the development of the cost of production in
Sweden that has not been favorable for several years now and it has
been difficult to increase the production in a way that compensates
for the increase of salaries,'' Zetterberg said.

   The Kuwaiti-based United
Arab Shipping Co., jointly owned by six Gulf Arab countries
including Kuwait and Iraq, has shifted its base to Dubai, shipping
executives said Wednesday.
   The company's board of directors has completed a plan to
continue operations from the southern gulf port city, said the
shipping executives, who spoke on condition that they not be named.
   The UASC is a gulf shareholding company established in 1976 by
the governments of the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Iraq, Saudi
Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar.
   All 48 of its vessels, including 15 container ships, were out of
Kuwait waters when Iraq invaded the country on Aug. 2, the
executives said.
   The company was trying to sort out its critical position
following the invasion and resulting embargo against oil from Iraq
and Kuwait, said the executives. Issues facing the company after
the invasion included the status of Iraqi shares and the shifting
of company headquarters from Kuwait, which means reflagging the
vessels.
   The sources said that with Dubai as the company's base, ships
could be registered under the U.A.E. flag to avert the dangers of
embargo enforcement they would encounter under the Kuwaiti flag.
   The company would not violate the United Nations embargo on
goods to Iraq or occupied Kuwait.

   Litton Industries' fourth-quarter
earnings fell 2 percent despite increased sales, the conglomerate
said Wednesday.
   Litton's shipbuilding division reported higher sales and
profits. Results also improved at its Resource Exploration
Services, which compiles and sells data on oil and gas reserves,
Litton said.
   But its defense electronics and automated assembly line
businesses suffered from tightening military spending and softness
in the automotive market.
   For the quarter ending July 31, Litton earned $45.5 million or
$1.91 per share, compared to $46.6 million or $1.86 per share
during the 1989 period.
   The company said per-share earnings rose because a stock
repurchase program reduced the number of shares. Litton plans to
continue the stock buyback, purchasing another 2.5 million of its
common shares, the company said Wednesday.
   Quarterly revenue rose 7 percent, from $1.3 billion to $1.4
billion.
   For the year, earnings rose fractionally, from $178.3 million or

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, with aggressive commodity
fund selling late in the session.
   The sharp selloff was attributed to the continuing good growing
conditions in the Midwest and the perception that crop yields will
be larger than predicted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
said William Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   ``There is also the perception that the Soviet Union will not
enter the U.S. market for grains and soybeans until October,''
Biedermann said.
   Also contributing to the fall in prices was the diminishing of
inflationary pressures as indicated by a drop in energy futures
prices.
   Biedermann said the light volume of trading on the Board of
Trade allowed the selloff to begin and accelerate toward the close
of business.
   At the close, wheat prices were 3 cents lower to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.79{ a bushel;
corn was a \ cent to 2} cents lower with September at $2.53{ a

   The stock market showed a broad gain today,
encouraged by falling oil prices.
   Trading was relatively quiet, however.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 23.52 to
2,638.37 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,020 up,
467 down and 456 unchanged.
   Over the last couple of days, analysts say, stocks appear to
have found an equilibrium level pending further events in the
showdown that has followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Most oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed on increased production quotas to compensate for
the absence of shipments from Iraq and Kuwait.
   The news sent oil prices lower. Crude oil futures for October
delivery fell more than $2 a barrel to the neighborhood of $25.70
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   But enthusiasm over that development was muted by uncertainty
over how much lasting effect the OPEC plan might have on the
worldwide oil market.
   Doubts persisted, too, about the outlook for the domestic
economy. The Commerce Department reported that its index of leading
economic indicators was unchanged in July.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Boeing, up 1&lsqb; at 49;
Bristol-Myers Squibb, up 1{ at 60~; Philip Morris, up | at 45|, and

   Lockheed Corp. on Wednesday unveiled its
version of a futuristic fighter proposed for the 21st century, as
Air Force officials cited the Middle East crisis as the need for
such a craft.
   The Lockheed YF-22 prototype of the Advanced Tactical Fighter
followed Monday's launch of a prototype made by Northrop Corp. The
two designs are competing for a multibillion-dollar contract.
   The plane Lockheed unveiled at its Palmdale manufacturing plant
was much more compact than the Northrop version.
   Both planes have smooth contours to help them evade radar and
are built of advanced composite materials. The Lockheed aircraft
has stubby wings, while the Northrop plane is longer, with a
cigar-like fuselage and a wingspan that looks like a kite.
   A music system blared Wagner's ``Flight of the Valkyries'' as
the Lockheed plane was rolled out, although unlike its competition,
the YF-22 stayed on the ground after its rollout. Officials would
not say when it would be flown.
   Lockheed chairman Daniel M. Tellep said it will not matter that
Northrop got its aircraft up first.
   ``It is not he who flies first, it is he who flies best,'' he
said.
   The contract calls for 750 fighter planes for the Air Force and
approximately 500 for the Navy at a cost of $51 million apiece. The
price tag is about twice the cost of the F-15 Eagle, the current
front-line fighter deployed in the Middle East.
   The ATF program faced fading prospects for approval in Congress
before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, but the crisis has
enhanced prospects for approval of major defense projects.
   Air Force Maj. Gen. Joseph W. Ralston said he is optimistic
about congessional funding for the ATF program desspite recent
defense spending cuts.
   In building the YF-22 prototype, Lockheed teamed with the Boeing
Corp. and General Dynamics Corp. Northrop teamed with McDonnell
Douglas Corp. for its test version of the futuristic fighter.
   The winner must give the Pentagon a fighter plane that can fly
twice the speed of sound, is highly maneuverable and uses
radar-evading stealth technology.
   If Northrop gets the contract, ATF planes will be built in
Southern California. Lockheed has said if it wins the competition,
the fighters will be made in Marietta, Ga.

   New homes sales in July fell for the fifth
time in seven months, the government said Wednesday, and industry
observers said rising mortgage rates linked to the Mideast crisis
will compound the decline in months ahead.
   ``We will be facing a few months of significant weakness because
of the runup in rates,'' said Robert Villanueva, forecasting
director for the National Association of Home Builders.
   ``At least for the remainder of the year, it's difficult to be
optimistic,'' said James Nelson, president-elect of the Mortgage
Bankers Association and chief executive officer of Eberhardt Co., a
Minneapolis mortgage banking company.
   The Commerce Department said new home sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 548,000 units, down from 561,000 units in
June and 741,000 in July 1989.
   At the same time, the department offered evidence of even more
sluggishness earlier, revising downward the sales totals in both
May and June.
   It said sales edged up just 0.6 percent in May rather than the
2.3 percent reported last month, and 4.7 percent in June instead of
the 8 percent in the earlier report.
   For the first seven months of the year, sales have fallen 12.4
percent below the pace of 1989.
   The department also said inventories of new homes showed a 7.8
month backlog at the July sales pace. It had been 7.7 months in
June.
   Analysts had expected a pickup in sales in July as fixed-rate,
30-year mortgage rates continued to slide from their 1990 peak of
10.67 percent in May to 9.98 percent by the end of the month.
   But Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National
Mortgage Association, said consumer confidence was waning even
before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait because of uncertainty
over the economy.
   ``When that happens, they tend to postpone purchases of
high-priced things,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, sales of existing homes did rise in July, up 3.3
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.44 million units,
according to the National Association of Realtors.
   John A. Tuccillo, the association's chief economist, said sales
of existing homes advanced because of their lower prices.
   The median price of a new home was $121,000 in July, Commerce
said. That was down 4.7 percent from June but still $22,600 more
than the $98,400 median price for an existing home in the Realtors'
survey. The median price means half of the homes cost more, half
less.
   But analysts also expect resales to drop as mortgage rates
increase. By last Friday, the average rate was 10.29 percent,
according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
   New home sales in the Northeast, which have been sluggish for
more than a year, fell 10.1 percent to an annual rate of 80,000
units. The department also revised the June increase downward, from
36.9 percent to 25.3 percent.
   Sales fell in the West, down 4.9 percent to 135,000 units, while
they were unchanged at 237,000 units in the South.
   Sales rose 2.1 percent to 96,000 units in the Midwest.

   The Citizens and Southern Corp. and Sovran
Financial Corp., which on Saturday plan a merger creating the
nation's 13th largest bank, have named a nine-member management
team for the new company.
   C&amp;S Chairman Bennett A. Brown will serve as chairman and chief
executive officer. Dennis C. Bottorff, currently president of
Sovran, will become president and chief operating officer.
   Other top officials in the new company include Albert B. Gornto,
chairman of the executive committee, and Hugh M. Chapman, vice
chairman.
   The new company, to be called C&amp;S@Sovran Corp., will have more
than 1,000 banking offices in seven states and Washington, D.C.,
and total assets of $50.3 billion. C&amp;S@Sovran will have dual
offices in Atlanta and Norfolk, Va., the home bases of the former
separate companies.
   The merger, which was announced last September, cleared its last
major regulatory hurdle in July when the Federal Reserve Board
approved the deal. It had been challenged earlier by a community
group in Atlanta which argued that C&amp;S was not fulfilling its
obligation to serve poorer customers.
   C&amp;S and Sovran operate banking offices in Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Maryland, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and
Washington, D.C.
   Local banking offices will continue to operate under either the
C&amp;S or Sovran name, Brown said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. will enter
the supercomputer market with a low cost ``mini supercomputer''
specially designed for scientific applications, a company spokesman
said Wednesday.
   The computer, to be test produced this year and marketed within
a few years, will cost about $1.04 million, or one-tenth the price
of supercomputers on the market today, the spokesman said.
   In addition to being less expensive, Matsushita's machine, at
one cubic meter, will be between one-tenth and one-twentieth the
size of current supercomputer systems since it won't require a
massive cooling unit, the spokesman said.
   With a speed of 25 gigaflops, or 25 billion operations per
second, Matsushita's model will be among the fastest
supercomputers, the spokesman said.
   Supercomputers typically are used for operations such as weather
forecasting and computer simulation that require huge numbers of
calculations.
   The machine's applications will be limited compared with more
expensive models, the spokesman said. But he said the company is
studying the possibility of adding more versatile models.
   Universities and research centers will be the prime market for
Matsushitas machine.
   The current leaders of the supercomputer market in Japan include
Cray Research Inc. of the United States and Fujitsu Ltd., Hitachi
Ltd. and NEC Corp. of Japan.
   Matsushita, which quit the computer business in 1964, has
re-entered the field over the last two years, emphasizing
workstations and personal computers.
   The company is best known in the United States for its Panasonic
and Quasar brand consumer electronics.

   The stock market posted a moderate gain today,
encouraged by falling oil prices.
   Over the last couple of sessions, analysts say, stocks appear to
have found an equilibrium level pending further events in the
showdown that has followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Most oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed on increased production quotas to compensate for
the absence of shipments from Iraq and Kuwait.
   The news sent oil prices lower. Crude oil futures for October
delivery fell more than $2 a barrel to the neighborhood of $25.70
on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   But enthusiasm over that development was muted by uncertainty
over how much lasting effect the OPEC plan might have on the
worldwide oil market.
   Doubts persisted, too, about the outlook for the domestic
economy. The Commerce Department reported that its index of leading
economic indicators was unchanged in July.

   The makers of One-A-Day vitamins have agreed to
stop advertising that its product can reverse the effects of air
pollution, stress and strenuous exercise, New York's attorney
general announced Wednesday.
   Attorney General Robert Abrams said there was no conclusive and
scientific proof that any vitamins could protect people from such
ill effects.
   ``One-A-Day's claims are patently false and only create an
unfounded belief in the benefits of the product,'' Abrams said in a
statement.
   Television and radio ads for the vitamins say: ``Defending your
lungs against air pollution requires vitamins A, C and E. Daily
stress can chip away at your B vitamins. And rigorous physical
training can lower your body's supply of essential minerals. That's
why One-A-Day vitamins are uniquely formulated to put back what
your world takes away.''
   In addition to discontinuing the disputed commercials, Miles
Inc. of Elkhart, Ind., paid $10,000 each to New York, California
and Texas as part of the settlement. Miles is a subsdiary of the
big West Germany pharmaceuticals concern Bayer AG.
   Dionn Tron, a spokeswoman for Miles, said the company had
stopped airing the commercials in April due to a change in
marketing strategy.
   ``We continue to believe that the ads were not misleading and
the claims in them were well substantiated,'' she said.

<HEAD>FDIC Prevents S&amp;Ls from Leaving Home Loan Bank System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said
Wednesday it has issued a ruling effectively barring
state-chartered savings and loan associations from withdrawing from
the Federal Home Loan Bank System for at least 18 months.
   The action eases concerns that the FDIC might be on the verge of
allowing a giant exodus of S&amp;Ls from the system _ which would
cripple the system's ability to finance the savings and loan
bailout.
   The action came on a request by the Wauwatosa Savings and Loan
Association of Wauwatosa, Wis., which had asked if it could
maintain its federal deposit insurance if it pulled out of the
Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago.
   In a statement, the FDIC said it could ``make no assurances at
this time to Wauwatosa that it would be able to retain its deposit
insurance should it withdraw from membership in the Federal Home
Loan Bank System.''
   Because both banks and S&amp;Ls depend on federal deposit insurance
to operate, the FDIC decision effectively blocks any exodus by
state-chartered institutions out of the S&amp;L system.
   The FDIC said its action, which was taken at a closed board
meeting on Tuesday, was based on recommendations made by the Office
of Thrift Supervision, the agency which regulates the S&amp;L industry.
   The OTS said that the withdrawal of S&amp;Ls from the home loan bank
system would pose safety and soundness concerns.
   The FDIC did agree to review the matter in 18 months. It said
that would give the OTS time to draw up regulations clarifying the
situation. The OTS is expected to propose a regulation that would
require state-chartered S&amp;Ls to belong to the Federal Home Loan
Bank System.
   Of the 2,505 savings and loans still operating, about half of
them are federally chartered and the other half have state charters.
   Both state and federally chartered S&amp;Ls were members of the
Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., the now-defunct agency
which provided insurance of up to $100,000 per deposit at S&amp;Ls.
   The S&amp;L bailout legislation passed by Congress last year made it
clear that federally chartered S&amp;Ls must maintain their membership
in the S&amp;L system even though their insurance fund was being
administered by the FDIC. However, the legislation was less clear
about the status of state-chartered thrifts.
   The home loan bank system is required to contribute up to $300
million annually as its share of the S&amp;L bailout, a burden which
some S&amp;Ls have complained adds to their cost of operation and makes
it difficult for them to compete with commercial banks.
   However, Bush administration officials contended that if the
FDIC allowed state-chartered S&amp;Ls to leave, it would make it
difficult for the home loan bank system to come up with its
required contribution to the bailout.

   The stock market staged a moderate advance
Wednesday with encouragement from falling oil prices.
   Trading remained light, however.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 17.58 to 2,632.43.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
972 up, 508 down and 512 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 134.24 million
shares, against 127.65 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 165.67 million shares.
   Over the last couple of days, analysts say, stocks appear to
have found an equilibrium level pending further events in the
showdown that has followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Most oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed on increased production quotas to compensate for
the absence of shipments from Iraq and Kuwait.
   The news sent oil prices lower. Crude oil futures for October
delivery fell nearly $2 a barrel to just under $26 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   But enthusiasm over that development was muted by uncertainty
over how much lasting effect the OPEC plan might have on the
worldwide oil market.
   Doubts persisted, too, about the outlook for the domestic
economy. The Commerce Department reported that its index of leading
economic indicators was unchanged in July.
   Energy stocks were steady to mostly higher despite the oil price
drop. Mobil gained | to 63~; Atlantic Richfield 1| to 135}; Texaco
{ to 63\, and Schlumberger 1&lsqb; to 64&rsqb;.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Boeing, up ~ at 48};

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up &rsqb; at 32{, and General Motors, up
&rsqb; at 40|.
   By contrast, many prominent technology issues in the
over-the-counter market came under renewed selling pressure. MCI
Communications fell 1| to 31}; 3Com Corp. 3~ to 8}; Intel | to 35,
and Microsoft 2&rsqb; to 60{.
   The drop in 3Com was attributed to negative appraisals of the
company's prospects following a conference-call meeting with
analysts Tuesday.
   Wyle Laboratories, traded on the Big Board, rose 1&lsqb; to 12&lsqb;. The
company said it expected higher earnings for its fiscal second half
and for the full fiscal year ending Jan. 31.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000

0.63 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

<HEAD>Central American Nations Ask Oil Discount; Venezuela Boosts
Capacity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five Central American countries
have asked Mexico and Venezuela for relief from the increase in oil
prices prompted by the Middle East crisis.
   ``The military invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, which deeply concerns
our people, will affect the world petroleum market and will bring
inevitable political and economic consequences for Central
America,'' President Rafael Leonardo Callejas told The Associated
Press.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, Venezuela said it planned to increase oil
production capacity, and Brazil said it would receive more oil from
Iran to make up for shortages due to the embargo on oil from Iraq
and occupied Kuwait.
   Under the 10-year-old San Jose Agreement, five Central American
countries have been buying Venezuelan and Mexican oil for an
average $17 a barrel, paying 80 percent in cash. Mexico and
Venezuela allow the other 20 percent to be used as loans for
development projects, or to finance imports from Venezuela and
Mexico.
   Under the proposal by Honduras and four other nations, the
countries would pay 70 percent of their oil bills in cash as long
as prices remain high, Callejas said. The other 30 percent would be
covered as credits for purchases of Mexican or Venezuelan goods and
services, or as loans for development projects.
   The other four nations are El Salvador, Costa Rica, Nicaragua
and Guatemala. The San Jose Agreement also covers Belize, Panama,
Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Barbados.
   Meanwhile, Venezuela plans to increase its oil production
capacity to 2.86 million barrels per day in 1990, a 60,000-barrel
increase, Petroleos de Venezuela said Wednesday.
   Venezuela is actually pumping only about 2 million barrels daily
and has said it intends to bring up to 500,000 more by the end of
the year to make up for the oil lost by the embargo.
   And in Brazil, Iran's ambassador told reporters his country will
increase oil sales to Brazil by 200,000 barrels a day to cover the
loss of imports from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Mahmoud Movahedi said Iran would sign a deal with the Brazilian
government oil monopoly Petrobras for the sale of an extra 100,000
barrels of oil a day.
   Weeks before the Gulf crisis, Petrobras had agreed to buy
100,000 barrels daily from Iran at below-market prices.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher in U.S.; Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar moved mostly higher in U.S. trading
Wednesday after a mixed performance overseas as currency dealers
began adjusting their holdings ahead of the long holiday weekend in
the United States.
   Gold prices gained modestly in domestic dealings. On the
Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled
at $385.30 a troy ounce, up 30 cents from Tuesday. Later, Republic
National Bank quoted a bid of $386 for an ounce of gold bullion,
$1.50 higher than Tuesday's 4 p.m. EDT bid.
   Domestic currency dealers said the dollar's advance came as a
byproduct of trading in German marks and Japanese yen, which
captured most of the attention.
   Dealers sold marks and bought yen. The buying interest in the
Japanese currency coincided with an OPEC agreement to increase oil
output to compensate for lost exports from Iraq and Kuwait.
   At a meeting this week in Vienna, Austria, the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries decided on the action in response to
the international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
   Earlier this month, dealers had dumped yen amid speculation that
Japan's heavily oil import-dependent economy would suffer due to a
disruption in oil supplies caused by the Middle East conflict.
   A nervous tone continued to prevail in foreign exchange markets
as traders awaited developments in the Persian Gulf. Most financial
markets have been volatile since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Michael Schaufler, a currency trader at the Bank of Boston's New
York office, said foreign exchange markets were preparing for the
three-day U.S. Labor Day weekend. Efforts are being made to balance
currency holdings in case any market-moving developments occur
while U.S. trading is closed.
   European foreign exchange dealers similarly reported that with
prospects uncertain for a diplomatic solution to the Persian Gulf
crisis, trading focused more on consolidating accounts before the
end of the month.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.35 yen, up 1.15 yen from
Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 143.65
yen. In New York the dollar closed at 143.55 yen, down from 143.75
yen on Tuesday.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.9475 late in London, up from
$1.9470 Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.94575 to buy one pound,
more expensive than Tuesday's $1.9429.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late quotes included: 1.55925 German marks, up from 1.5560; 1.28875
Swiss francs, up from 1.2860; 5.2300 French francs, up from 5.2175;
1,155.00 Italian lire, up from 1,149.25; and 1.13865 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1416.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late
Tuesday's levels, were: 1.5562 West German marks, up from 1.5525;
1.2740 Swiss francs, down from 1.2815; 5.2170 French francs, up
from 5.2065; 1.7525 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7470; 1,151.50
Italian lire, up from 1,149.25; and 1.1385 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1416.
   Gold bullion prices were mixed overseas.
   In London, gold was quoted at a late price of $385.25 a troy
ounce, up from late Tuesday's bid of $383.
   In Zurich, the late bid was $384.25, up from $382 late Tuesday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold dropped $3.25 an ounce on Wednesday,
to close at $389.34.
   Silver prices moved lower here and abroad. It traded late in
London at $4.83 a troy ounce, slightly below the late bid of $4.85
on Tuesday. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery settled at $4.826 a troy ounce, down from Tuesday's
settlement of $4.840.

   Wholesale prices of crude oil, heating oil and
unleaded gasoline dropped sharply Wednesday on news of higher OPEC
output and trader speculation that peace finally seemed possible in
the Persian Gulf.
   Light sweet crude, the benchmark grade, fell $1.96 to $25.92 per
barrel for October contracts on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a
leading market for petroleum.
   ``Right now, we've gone from war-time psychosis last Friday,
when the price was $32, back to no war,'' said David D. Hale, chief
economist with Kemper Financial Services Inc. in Chicago.
   Contracts for crude-oil delivery in later months also fell
following word that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries had approved a plan allowing Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and
other producers to boost output.
   The international boycott of crude from Iraq and Kuwait has kept
about 4 million barrels per day off the world markets, which last
week jacked oil prices up to the highest level in five years.
   Sources in Vienna, where the OPEC officials met, estimated the
new OPEC oil might come to 3 million barrels per day, making up
most of the shortfall.
   ``The only real thing that has happened is it looks like OPEC
has kind of blessed the increasing of output by producers,'' said
Stephen Smith, an analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co. ``It's still
looking like no hostilities for the time being, and no extreme
shortage of oil.''
   Home heating oil fell 7.88 cents to 71.64 cents per gallon on
September contracts traded on the Mercantile Exchange. Unleaded
gasoline dropped 3.81 cents to 84.72 cents per gallon on September
contracts.
   Both products were also down for other future months, with
heating oil futures for October through January dropping their
maximum limit of 6 cents per gallon. The limit, which offers
traders on the Merc a degree of protection, applies to all contract
months except the nearest, or spot month.
   Natural gas was up from $1.500 to $1.505 per 1,000 cubic feet on
October contracts. Other natural gas futures months were down.
   A Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. trader, Ed Kevelson, said investors
were responding partly to reports that the Iraqi leader, Saddam
Hussein, might take a softer stance on his claims to Kuwait during
a meeting Thursday with U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar.
   ``We just heard the story that Hussein is supposedly going to
propose federated self-rule for Kuwait,'' Kevelson said.
   Traders were not quite sure what type of rule that would be for
the oil-rich nation seized by Iraq Aug. 2. Kevelson said he doubted
anything would come from such a proposal, but nonetheless it helped
depress petroleum prices.
   ``People tend to focus now on the bearish news and the OPEC news
instead of the tension,'' Kevelson said.
   ``The possibility of peace, that's it,'' said Sal Gilbertie, a
trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
   Despite cheaper wholesale oil traded on the Merc and elsewhere,
gasoline prices were rising at the pump, figures from the American
Automobile Association showed.
   Self-serve regular unleaded averaged $1.307 a gallon nationwide,
an increase of 3.3 cents over Friday, the AAA reported Wednesday.
Retail gasoline prices have risen 23.2 cents per gallon since Aug.
1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait, AAA said.

<HEAD>Saudi Production Increase, Iraqi Overtures Send Oil Prices Lower</HEAD>

   Another round of selling pushed energy futures prices lower
Wednesday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, as OPEC ministers
agreed to suspend production restraints and allow members to boost
the flow of oil.
   On other markets, precious metals were steady; grain and soybean
futures fell; and livestock and pork futures closed mixed.
   Light sweet crude settled 33 cents to $1.96 lower with the
contract for delivery in October at $25.92 a barrel; heating oil
was 5.39 cents to 7.88 cents lower with September at 71.64 cents a
gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2.50 cents to 5.82 cents lower with
September at 84.72 cents a gallon.
   Initial selling of energy futures was set off by reports that
Saudi Arabia was already producing 7.5 million barrels a day, said
Michael Rothman, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Captial Markets Inc.
in New York.
   He said indications are Saudi Arabia will boost output to 8
million barrels by the end of September and 8.5 million barrels by
the end of the year.
   Further selling pressure came on reports that Iraqi said it
would pull out of Kuwait if the United Nations sanctions were
dropped and the country was guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf
and sole control of a Kuwaiti oil field.
   The United States has refused to confirm or deny the report,
which Rothman said set off another round of peace selling.
   In Vienna, ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries agreed to boost oil production by 3 million to 3.5
million barrels a day to offset the loss of 4 million barrels due
to the embargo of Iraq.
   Precious metal futures halted their plunge on New York's
Commodity Exchange, largely disregarding plunging energy futures
prices.
   Trading volume fell from Tuesday's level due to increased
margins on gold and silver contracts demanded by the exchange. The
move makes trading more expensive and dampened market enthusiasm,
said Don Tierney, an analyst with Stanley Bell &amp; Co. in New York.
   Tierney said selling hit the market early in the session as
energy prices fell. But moderate buying by speculators and
investors in London helped stablize prices.
   After losing over $30 in recent trading sessions, gold is coming
out of its oversold condition, with some new buying beginning to
support the market, Tierney said.
   Gold was 10 cents lower to 30 cents higher with August at
$385.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1.6 cents to 1.8 cents lower with
August at $4.826 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures prices were lower on the Chicago Board
of Trade, with aggressive commodity fund selling coming late in the
session.
   The sharp selloff was attributed to the continuing good growing
conditions in the Midwest and the perception that crop yields will
be larger than predicted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
said William Biedermann, an analyst with Allendale Inc. in Chicago.
   ``There is also the perception that the Soviet Union will not
enter the U.S. market for grains and soybeans until October,''
Biedermann said.
   Also contributing to the fall in prices was the diminishing of
inflationary pressures as indicated by a drop in energy futures
prices.
   Biedermann said the light volume of trading on the Board of
Trade allowed the selloff to begin and accelerate toward the close
of business.
   Wheat was 4 cents to 6 cents lower with September at $2.75} a
bushel; corn was 2 cents to 5} cents lower with September at $2.50
a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3} cents lower with September at
$1.04} a bushel; soybeans were 7 cents to 16\ cents lower with
September at $6.05\ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were lower and pork futures mostly higher on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Cattle prices were pressured by light retail demand for beef and
expectations of a decline in cash prices.
   Pork futures were higher on ideas that demand for pork products
will increase.
   Live cattle were .13 cent to .58 cent lower with October at
76.07 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .20 cent
higher with August at 88.77 cents a pound; hogs were .02 cent to
.37 cent higher with October at 48.82 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .22 cent to .35 cent higher with February at 52.60
cents a pound.

<HEAD>Report: Tandy, Matsushita To Produce PCs Jointly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. of Japan
and Fort Worth-based Tandy Corp. will produce personal computers at
a Texas plant under a joint venture, according to a newspaper
report Wednesday.
   The size of the planned investment was not known, The Dallas
Morning News reported.
   Tandy Corp., the parent of the Radio Shack chain, had no comment
on the report, spokesman Tony Magoulas said Wednesday.
   A factory to be built in Tarrant County, west of Dallas, will
produce desktop and portable computers for Tandy and Matsushita,
the Morning News reported.
   Tandy already makes a full line of desktop and portable
computers, including models it sells to Matsushita for sale under
its Panasonic name. Tandy also sells under its name a laptop
computer that is made by Matsushita.
   Cooperation between the two companies dates back to at least
1988.
   Japanese and American industry sources told the newspaper that
the latest agreement, reached in the past few weeks, has not been
formalized.
   ``We have had discussions with Tandy on a number of matters,''
said Justin Camerlengo, chief spokesman at Matsushita's main U.S.
subsidiary. ``There is a genuine interest in doing things with
Tandy. But we have no announcements to make.''
   Sources told the Morning News that production at the plant
largely will be based on manufacturing processes that Matsushita
developed. The company already makes computer workstations at a
plant in Illinois.

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The repaired and renamed ship that caused the
country's worst oil spill left San Diego Bay for sea trials
Wednesday after a multimillion-dollar repair job to its mangled
hull.
   The rebuilt Exxon Mediterranean, formerly named the Exxon
Valdez, got underway at 6:45 a.m. as tugboats pulled the ship from
a pier and guided it through the harbor.
   There were no protesters trailing the ship as there were when
the 32,000-ton tanker, with its severely damaged hull, was towed
into harbor from Alaska 13 months ago.
   Workers at National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. replaced 3,000 tons
of steel in the mangled hull during the 11-month, $30 million
repair job. The 987-foot-long tanker was floated out of dry dock
last month and underwent dock trials at a NASSCO pier.
   The ship, which was built at NASSCO and delivered to Exxon in
1986, will head for international waters about 100 miles from the
San Diego coast and some 25 miles past San Clemente Island, said
NASSCO spokesman Fred Hallett.
   Officials from NASSCO, the Coast Guard and the American Bureau
of Shipping will be aboard the ship during the sea trials, which
are expected to last between a week and 10 days, Exxon spokeswoman
Carrie Chassin said Wednesday.
   ``All the structural work has been approved, but this sea trial
is to make sure everything is in perfect operating condition,''
Chassin said. ``They will be testing all the systems of the ship,
the steering, a comprehensive review until everyone is satisfied.''
   During sea trials, the crew will run the tanker at full speed,
make maximum turns and test machinery and equipment, Hallett said.
   ``Typically, when we repair a ship, we don't put it through a
shakedown,'' Hallett said. ``But because of the extensive repairs
and the problems it had, Exxon will put it through a shakedown as
if it were a new ship.''
   Exxon officials deny that the tanker's renaming in July was
related to the spill of nearly 11 million gallons of oil when the
ship ran aground on Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989.
   Officials say the tanker will transport crude in the
Mediterranean. The vessel holds nearly 1.4 million barrels of
crude, and is too big for any U.S. Pacific ports when fully loaded,
Exxon officials have said. They also say tankers that big aren't
needed for West Coast shipping routes because of declining
production from Alaskan oil fields.
   Coast Guard Lt. Bill Uberti certified the ship's seaworthiness
after testing its machinery and engines. He will be aboard during
the sea trials.
   After the trials are finished, Chassin said the ship and its
20-member crew will return to San Diego for supplies before sailing
to Singapore.
   ``In Singapore, it will take on additional fuel and provisions
and then go to Egypt and the Middle East, load crude and then
unload in France, the United Kingdom and Rotterdam,'' Chassin said.
``It will not load Iraqi crude in Turkey.''

   OPEC ministers Wednesday endorsed higher
crude production to make up most _ but not all _ of the shortfall
caused by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The accord, worked out during four days of discussions,
temporarily suspends the cartel's quota system to permit higher
output by nations with spare capacity.
   An agreement worked out last month by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries had set production at 22.5 million
barrels per day. But an embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil imposed
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait four weeks ago has reduced supply
by about 4 million barrels.
   The shortfall has led to increased prices for crude oil on world
markets as well as hefty hikes for gasoline and heating oil sold on
the retail level.
   Analysts predicted the surge in output of about 3 million
barrels of crude by heavyweight Saudi Arabia and other producing
nations could help hold down prices in the next few weeks.
   But they cautioned prices could shoot even higher with a further
escalation of hostilities in the Gulf and stronger demand for oil
as winter approaches.
   ``The market may pull back some, but the trend continues to
remain on the up side as long as the military option in the Gulf
remains a viable one,'' said Michael Rothman, an energy specialist
at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York.
   Peter Bogin, associate director for oil markets at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates in Paris, said gasoline prices at the
pump should hold steady as long as crude prices do.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the average price of a
gallon of unleaded regular gasoline in the United States has
increased by more than 23 cents at the pumps, according to a survey
released Wednesday by the American Automobile Association.
   The price of light sweet crude for October delivery was $25.92
on the New York Mercantile Exchange Wednesday, down $1.96 a barrel
from the day before.
   Sheikh Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, the finance minister of Kuwait's
government-in-exile, pressed for the agreement by the 13-nation
OPEC.
   ``We simply cannot accept that countries that came to our help
in the Gulf should suffer (from high prices),'' said the official,
who was his government's oil minister until early July.
   Iran opposed the deal, arguing that Western nations should
release oil from their inventories before asking OPEC for more.
``If they do something, after that we can do something,'' said the
nation's oil minister, Gholamreza Aqazadeh.
   Iraq and Libya never showed up for the meeting, which Iraq said
was held illegally.
   Indonesia's oil minister, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, predicted that
OPEC nations would pump an additional 3 million or more barrels of
oil a day into the market.
   But, he said, ``OPEC production will not be able to meet the
loss.''
   In a final statement, the ministers said they decided to
``increase production, in accordance with need, in order to
maintain'' stable markets.
   The extra oil from OPEC and consuming countries, they said,
should go primarily to developing countries that would be hurt most
by a disruption in supplies.
   They called on consuming nations to ``actively participate'' in
calming the markets and urged them to draw down some of their
stocks.
   Saudi Arabia's influential minister, Hisham Nazer, left
immediately after the meeting. But he has said his country's output
will increase by 2 million barrels a day.
   One OPEC source, demanding anonymity, said the kingdom's
production has already risen to more than 7 million barrels a day,
well over its cartel quota of 5.4 million barrels.
   Iran, a leading producing nation, has no plans to boost
production, Aqazadeh said.
   Venezuela's oil minister, Celestino Armas, said his country
initially could add 300,000 barrels a day to its ceiling of 1.9
million barrels.
   ``We are taking the position to supply another 200,000 barrels
by the end of the year,'' he said.
   The United Arab Emirates was expected to raise production by as
much as a half million barrels a day above its quota of 1.5 million
barrels.
   Jibril Aminu, the Nigerian oil minister, said his country, if it
wanted, could produce 250,000 to 280,000 barrels a day beyond its
limit of 1.6 million barrels.
   Libya could increase production about 100,000 barrels a day over
its cap of 1.2 million barrels, analysts say.
   It takes about four to six weeks for oil to work its way onto
the market.
   The OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Oil Embargo Doesn't Affect Many Ships That Already Left</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Despite the embargo against Iraq and
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, crude oil from those Persian Gulf nations is
still reaching the United States, and will be for probably another
few weeks.
   Jonathan Cogan of the Energy Information Administration, an
independent statistical branch of the Energy Department, said
Wednesday that ships loaded with oil prior to the U.S. trade
restrictions have until Oct. 1 to arrive in the United States.
   When President Bush enacted the embargo on Aug. 2, the day Iraq
invaded Kuwait, the government exempted from the restrictions
delivery of crude that was already en route.
   ``It was kind of unfair for those refiners who ordered this
crude, and perhaps already paid for it, to not receive it,'' Cogan
said.
   Authorities believe they have provided enough time for the
grandfathered tankers to complete the journey, which can take a
month or more.
   But any tanker that misses the deadline will be barred from
unloading its oil, Treasury Department spokeswoman Barbara Clay
said.
   An Energy Department spokesman, Philip Keif, estimated that 40
million to 45 million barrels of Iraqi crude were already in the
pipeline at the time of the embargo.
   ``A lot of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude was loaded right up to the
invasion,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``The second week of September,
that's when we're going to feel the crunch.''

   Gasoline prices at the pump have risen more than
23 cents to crack $1.30 per gallon since the Middle East crisis
began, the American Automobile Association said Wednesday.
   The AAA said a nationwide spot-check of service stations found
that the price of self-serve regular unleaded gasoline increased
3.3 cents per gallon between last Friday and Wednesday.
   Retail prices have jumped by 23.2 cents to $1.307 per gallon
since Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait, sending world
petroleum prices shooting up, the AAA said.
   In the most recent spot-check, gasoline prices rose the most,
6.4 cents per gallon, in the Southwest. Prices were up 3.7 cents in
the Midwest, 3.6 cents in the Southeast, 2.4 cents in New England,
2 cents in the West and 0.1 cent in the Great Lakes region.
   No change was noted in the Mid-Atlantic region, the AAA said.

<HEAD>Troubled Developer Unveils Homesite Incentive Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BETH DUFF SANDERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Development Corp., the developer accused of
swindling thousands of people out of homesites, Wednesday unveiled
a comprehensive plan designed to keep customers and help rebuild
the company.
   The developer, which pleaded guilty to fraud conspiracy in a
March and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April,
presented its plan to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge A. Jay Cristol.
   The plan would create a land trust to give deeds to customers
who pay off their contracts; financial incentives for homesite
buyers to continue making payments; and a lot transfer program in
which homesite owners of undeveloped lots could swap their sites
for developed lots.
   ``I for one am favorably impressed,'' the judge said after the
presentation by Gordon Pfersich, senior vice president of land
operations for General Development.
   ``What the customer really wants to know is, `If I keep paying,
am I going to get anything?' '' Pfersich said. ``We say yes.''
   Robert Roth, an attorney representing the city of Palm Bay, was
not as sure. ``I think it's very pretty ... and very well
presented,'' he said. ``But it doesn't give me enough substance.''
   General Development has offered the state of Florida and cities
and counties involved undeveloped lots in most cases in return for
settling development obligations. The company also is turning over
the utilities it operated to the cities and counties.
   The plan would offer 35,300 purchasers with contracts on
undeveloped lots the option of transferring their lots to developed
ones at no additional cost.
   ``Our problem is we don't know which lots they're talking about
and in which cities, so we can't evaluate the plan,'' Roth said.
``We have our doubts about whether these lots are as developed as
they are saying.''
   General Development has about 13,000 unsold, developed lots to
which customers could be transferred, many in retirement
communities, company officials said.
   The 54,600 purchasers with contracts for developed lots would be
offered financial incentives to keep paying on their contracts,
such as a 5 percent cut on the original selling price, which would
lower monthly payments.
   General Development believes its current portfolio, taking into
account historical cancellation of contracts, is worth about $648
million. Subtracting accounts sold to investors, its portfolio is
about $434 million.
   But taking into account the number of homesite buyers who were
continuing to make payments as of July, the company estimates its
share of the entire portfolio is worth about $126 million.
   Company officials believe that by assuring customers they will
get a deed to a developed homesite, along with providing financial
incentives, the company could more than double the value of its
share of the accounts to about $279 million.
   Last month, the percentage of more than 77,000 people still
owing on properties but who have stopped making payments jumped to
51 percent.

<HEAD>Commodity Exchange Plans For 21st Century</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chicago Board of Trade should develop an
electronic trading system, create new products, and attract new
members and capital as it heads into the 21st century, an report
released Wednesday said.
   ``As the world continues to change and competition in our
markets increases, the Chicago Board of Trade will face many new
challenges and opportunities,'' Board of Trade Chairman William F.
O'Connor said.
   ``As an institution, we must be prepared to act boldly to meet
the changes head-on,'' he said.
   The report was prepared by a task force headed by Robert S.
Hamada, deputy dean of the University of Chicago business school.
   It said the Board of Trade must pursue a diverse set of new
futures _ contracts to buy or sell everything from orange juice to
wheat to securities at a specific date _ because of advantages in
launching a product and intense competition.
   The study said that despite the introduction of a number of new
trading products in recent years, 51 percent of the exchange's
volume comes from Treasury bond futures.
   The study also concluded that paperless trading is essential to
the future of pit trading and recommended pursuing new technology
to that end.
   The Board of Trade should use electronic systems that most
closely duplicate the open outcry auction trading, the study
concluded. The task force contended that the auction system adds to
the liquidity of the market.
   Although the Board of Trade is negotiating with the rival
Chicago Mercantile Exchange to join in the Globex trading system
developed by the Merc, the task force said that should not
interfere with experimentation with the Aurora trading system being
developed by the CBOT.
   The task force also recommended better incentive systems to
attract members and capital to new products. The study concluded
that a mix of capital pools, permits, fee rebates and electronic
trading systems should be developed and used to accomplish the goal.
   The study also concluded that the current trading floor for
financial futures is overcrowded, and that the exchange should
remedy the problem.
   The report comes as the exchange battles some present-day
problems. The Board of Trade and the Mercantile Exchange received a
black eye when an investigation into illegal trading activity
resulted in the indictment of 48 people.
   The exchange is also faced with a desire by regulators in
Washington to increase federal oversight of the commodities
industry. Industry leaders say that could reduce the
competitiveness of U.S. futures market as foreign competition
increases.
   The task force recommended the exchange delegate authority to
allow it to make quicker decisions. The study said such a move
would allow exchange leaders to focus on broad policy issues, not
operational details.

<HEAD>Government Agrees To Hear New Anti-Dumping Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government decided Wednesday to
investigate whether some Japanese-made electronic equipment are
imported at less than fair value into the United States,
threatening the domestic industry.
   The International Trade Commission ruled 4-0 that there is
reasonable indication that imports of some electronic display
screens used in computers and their subassemblies materially injure
U.S. industry.
   The finding means the Commerce Department will conduct an
anti-dumping investigation with hearings. A preliminary decision is
due Dec. 28, the ITC said.
   The procedure could result in import duties on the Japanese
products representing the margin of underpricing.
   The equipment, known as high-information content displays,
display in color or black-and-white text, graphics or images the
