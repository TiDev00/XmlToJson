<HEAD>Richards Blasts Uattributed Drug Charge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ann
Richards on Thursday denounced an unattributed allegation that she
was in a restroom where several women appeared to be smoking
marijuana almost 11 years ago.
   ``Do you think this country has reached the point now ... that
unsubstantiated people can say what they want to and suddenly it
takes on the vein of truth by appearing on television and in the
newspapers?'' Ms. Richards said at a campaign stop in Dallas.
   The state treasurer blamed her runoff opponent in Tuesday's
primary election, Attorney General Jim Mattox, for spreading rumors
about drug use.
   Mattox has said he possesses sworn statements from people who
say they know Ms. Richards used illegal drugs in the past. But
Mattox repeatedly has refused to reveal the names of those people
or offer any other evidence to back up his accusations.
   The Houston Post on Thursday quoted a woman it didn't identify
as saying she had seen Ms. Richards with a group of women in the
restroom of an Austin hotel during the National Association of
Women in Construction convention in 1979.
   The woman, who refused to tell her story unless guaranteed her
name not be used, told the Post, ``When you walked in the door you
could smell the definite aroma of marijuana.
   ``When I walked in (Ms. Richards) put her hand behind her and
held it. The girl on the end, who I did not know, had a roach or a
joint that had been smoked down in her hand,'' the woman told the
newspaper.
   The Post report said the woman felt compelled to recount the
incident after watching Ms. Richards refuse during televised
debates to answer yes or no to the question of whether she had ever
used illegal drugs.
   Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, has said she has not had
an alcoholic drink nor a mood-altering chemical in 10 years.
   Asked about the alleged 1979 incident, the state treasurer said,
``I have no idea what they're talking about.''
   Ms. Richards said Thursday she was shocked the allegations had
been reported. ``The surprising part is that now people are willing
to put it in print, with no substantiation at all. That's not what
this country is all about,'' she said.
   At a Thursday campaign stop in Lubbock, Mattox said he promised
confidentiality to people who alleged Ms. Richards has used drugs.
   He also refused again to release his income tax records, as Ms.
Richards has requested, unless she releases her medical records.
   When asked why, he said, ``Because I intend to win this
campaign, and I choose the playing fields and I choose the methods
by which we are going to play this game. That just happens to be
the way politics work.''
   Mattox has repeatedly said he expects to win the runoff and face
Republican Clayton Williams in November. Releasing his income taxes
when Williams hasn't done so would give Williams a signficant
advantage, Mattox said.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Proposes Unusual Plan To Repair Eastern Europe's
Environment</HEAD>

   An unusual financial arrangement devised to
promote conservation in the Third World could help Eastern Europe
begin to repair its badly damaged environment, a U.S. lawmaker says.
   Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y., has proposed in a letter to President
Bush that the United States initiate so-called debt-for-nature
swaps with Eastern Europe to clean up what LaFalce said could be
``the final and longest lasting legacy of the Stalinist period.''
   Under his proposal, the Eastern European countries' debts to the
United States would be forgiven in exchange for their commitment to
redirect the savings to cleaning up their environment.
   LaFalce also proposed that a multinational environmental trust
fund be set up for Eastern Europe.
   ``The problems seem to be very severe,'' said Peter Preuss, a
toxicologist at the Environmental Protection Agency who recently
visited Poland and Hungary.
   Preuss explained, for example, that the water in the Vistula
River at Krakow, Poland is not only undrinkable, it's too dirty for
industrial use.
   ``It is so salty and acid that the industries along the river
can't even use it for cooling water,'' Preuss said.
   Levels of air pollutants are ``many times higher, tens of times
higher'' than anything found in the United States, he said.
   In the small blackened town of Copsa Mica, Romania, every
building, tree and patch of ground is covered with soot and dust
from factories that dye rubber and produce nonferrous metals.
   In January, LaFalce, a senior member of the House Banking
Committee and chairman of the House Committee on Small Business,
led a congressional delegation to Yugoslavia, Poland, East Germany,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
   The plan was to discuss trade, investment and business with
Eastern European officials, but ``intruding into our discussions of
all these issues was the problem of environmental degradation,''
LaFalce said.
   ``On our trip to central Europe we saw great hope and great
expectations,'' he said in his letter to the president. ``But we
also saw polluted rivers and the dull, gray, hazy hues of polluted
skies ...
   ``Indeed, the problems are daunting and can barely be
exaggerated,'' he wrote.
   In the Upper Silesia region of Poland, researchers have observed
an increase in mental retardation because of metal particulates in
the air.
   Life expectancy is decreasing in Hungary, and mothers are
protesting about the respiratory problems that polluted air is
causing their children, LaFalce said.
   LaFalce's staff said legislation to provide for the debt swaps
and the trust fund, to be administered by the new Central European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, will be introduced in
April.
   Debt swaps for conservation have been used to encourage Third
World countries to establish nature preserves and to devote
resources to conservation.
   The first such swap was executed in July 1987 by a Washington
environmental organization called Conservation International, which
purchased and forgave $650,000 of Bolivia's foreign debt in
exchange for the establishment of a wildlife preserve. The
arrangement has been widely imitated by other environmental groups.
   Poland's foreign debt is about $40 billion, of which $3 billion
is owed to the United States. Poland has not made any payments on
the debt in recent years, LaFalce said.
   Hungary, on the other hand, owes most of its outside debt to
commercial banks, not governments, LaFalce said. If governments
forgive debt to finance environmental clean-up projects, banks
might do the same, he said.
   He has proposed that up to $20 billion be put into an
environmental trust fund under the auspices of the Central European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. About 10 percent of that,
or $2 billion, would come from the United States.
   The encouragement of environmental clean-up projects in Eastern
Europe could benefit American business, LaFalce said.
   ``Businesses in the United States have the experience and
technology needed to deal with these problems,'' he said.
``Therefore, they could expect to play a leading role in
establishing the necessary water and sewage treatment and other
facilities required to solve the problems.''

   A private school as negligent in the death
of a teen-age student during a school-sponsored climb of Mount Hood
in 1986 that claimed nine lives, and should pay the boy's father
$500,000, a jury decided Thursday.
   But the Multonomah County Circuit Court jury cleared mountain
guide Ralph Summers of negligence for his part in helping lead the
13-member Oregon Episcopal School party up the mountain.
   Sixteen-year-old Richard Haeder Jr. was one of the nine who died
after the group became lost in a blizzard during the May 1986
climb. Summers was among the four who survived.
   The verdict on the lawsuit by Haeder's father, Richard, came
after about five hours of deliberations.
   ``I'm happy to have justice done,'' the elder Haeder said after
the verdict. ``If nothing else comes out of this, it is that my son
did not die in vain.''
   Haeder said much of the $500,000 award would go toward creating
scholarships or other funds to honor his son. ``It isn't the
money,'' he said ``I wanted everyone to know those deaths were
needless.''
   Neither Summers nor representatives of the school would comment.
   The lawsuit accused the school and Summers of negligence in
planning and carrying out the trip.
   The climbers tried to reach the top of the 11,235-foot mountain
in deteriorating weather, got lost in the blizzard as they
retreated and had to build a snow cave for shelter as the sun set.
   The next morning, Summers and a student hiked to safety and
notified authorities. The snow cave wasn't marked, however, and
authorities searched for two days before they found it. Of the nine
students and two faculty members inside, only two teen-agers
survived.
   The jury began deliberating about 2 p.m. after closing arguments
in the case.
   Haeder's attorney, Paul Luvera, told jurors, ``They were leading
a group of schoolchildren up a mountain for no good reason. This
wasn't a group of mountain climbers; they were schoolchildren.
   ``Richie was crying; he wanted to go back and they kept going,''
Luvera said. ``And then he died a horrible painful death with
people dying all around him in a tomb made of ice.''
   Calling the lawsuit Richard and Judith Haeder's ``final eulogy''
to their son, Luvera asked that jurors award them $2.76 million.
   Luvera said evidence and testimony in the case showed Summers
didn't follow a correct compass bearing or use a map while
descending the mountain through a snowstorm.
   ``They were lost coming down, lost when they dug the snow cave,
and lost the next day when they went for help,'' he said.
   He also said Summers told inconsistent stories about who was
leading the climb, he or the Rev. Thomas Goman. Both men failed to
adequately respect the weather, and went too far up the mountain,
he said.
   Attorney Mark Wagner, representing Summers and the school, told
the jury to remember the storm that struck the mountain was three
times stronger than had been predicted.
   ``People died because a storm came in before our people got off
the mountain,'' he said. ``In the real world, accidents do happen
and it doesn't mean people are negligent or at fault.''

<HEAD>Abortion Issue Surfaces With a Twist in Pennsylvania Governor's
Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID MORRIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pennsylvania governor's race is
tipping conventional political wisdom on its ear when it comes to
the issue of abortion.
   Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey is an unyielding foe of
abortion, contrary to his national party platform. Casey's chief
Republican challenger, state Auditor General Barbara Hafer, is
firmly pro-choice, a position that puts her at odds with the GOP
national platform.
   While leaders of both parties say they can accommodate people on
both sides of the issue, a Casey-Hafer contest could test the
loyalties of many rank-and-file members in both parties.
   ``It's a difficult one for me,'' said Natalie Schmoyer, a
marketing consultant and pro-choice Democrat from suburban
Philadelphia. ``I feel very strongly about the choice issue, but
I'm also a Democrat who votes for Democrats. ... It's a hard
choice.''
   Casey's and Hafer's views on abortion have attracted two more
candidates to the gubernatorial race, an anti-abortion Republican
and a pro-choice Democrat campaigning almost exclusively on the
abortion issue.
   The Republican, 34-year-old Marguerite Luksik, has done little
campaigning but said she felt compelled to run because no one else
came forward to challenge Hafer's pro-choice stand.
   ``Sometimes I think that not defending your principles is the
worst thing you can do,'' said Mrs. Luksik, who runs a home day
care program for single parents. ``Then it looks like you really
don't believe in them.''
   Pro-choice Democrat Phil Berg, a 45-year-old lawyer, said
Casey's opposition to abortion is the only reason he decided to
challenge the governor. Berg, who calls himself ``the conscience of
our party,'' thinks Hafer will have a good shot at becoming
governor if she and Casey face off in November.
   ``We're in uncharted territory,'' said G. Terry Madonna,
director of the Center for Politics and Public Affairs at
Millersville University of Pennsylvania.
   Madonna expects Casey, 58, and Hafer, 46, to win their
respective primaries on May 15, but he said the contests could
become a barometer of public sentiment on abortion.
   ``The test will be whether the pro-life supporters can energize
their forces for Luksik,'' Madonna said. ``There's no doubt that
the pro-choice people have galvanized and energized their forces.''
   While Casey signed into law one of the nation's most restrictive
abortion laws last year, and the state Legislature is
overwhelmingly anti-abortion, surveys show many voters lean the
other way.
   A recent poll commissioned by Hafer found 50 percent of those
surveyed felt a woman should have the right to have an abortion,
while 9 percent said abortion should be illegal in all cases.
   About 14 percent of the respondents favored abortion only if the
mother's life was in danger and another 26 percent said abortion
should be allowed if the mother was in danger and in cases of rape
or incest.
   The telephone survey of 800 registered voters was done in
mid-March by Michigan-based Market Opinion Research and had a
margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
   Patrick Killian, Hafer's campaign manager, said the results were
encouraging because they indicate abortion will be ``the wild card
in the race.''
   Killian's counterpart in the Casey camp, James Carville, said
the results could not be interpreted as support for Hafer because
not all pro-choice voters would support her. Carville said the same
caveat applied to the pro-choice candidacy of Berg in the
Democratic primary.
   ``I believe in Pennsylvania the vast majority of Democrats and
the vast majority of Republicans see abortion as only one issue,''
Carville said. ``It isn't going to be just an election on
abortion.''
   The abortion issue aside, Casey is a popular first-term
incumbent who is credited with keeping his state's finances stable
while many neighboring states run deficits.
   Hafer's campaign has gone through a rough stretch in which she
was criticized for calling Casey a ``redneck Irishman from
Scranton,'' antagonizing blacks with her comments about a black
state prisons chief and charging personal and political expenses to
the state.

<HEAD>Greyhound Strike Not Grabbing Much Attention in Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor's traditional allies in Congress are
steering clear of the Greyhound strike because bus passengers don't
carry political clout and lawmakers are skittish about taking sides
in the violent dispute, legislators and others say.
   ``Members of Congress fly in airplanes _ they don't ride buses.
These passengers tend to be poor folks who are not active
politically,'' said Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y.
   Democrats who sometimes take the lead on labor issues also said
President Bush's hands-off approach to such disputes _ he vetoed a
union-backed plan to help settle the Eastern Airlines strike _ has
inhibited lawmakers from jumping into the fray.
   Congress historically has sat on the sidelines for months before
injecting itself in labor-management disputes, and neither
Greyhound nor striking drivers who walked out five weeks ago has
asked Congress to intervene.
   Still, there has been no flurry of floor speeches on the strike,
which has been marked by shootings and bomb threats and has choked
transportation in small communities around the country. One House
member's call for hearings has gone unheeded.
   Several lawmakers have written to Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole
and Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner asking for help. Last
year, Mrs. Dole intervened in the Pittston coal strike by
appointing a ``supermediator'' who helped reach a settlement for
Appalachian miners.
   Mrs. Dole believes her involvement in the Greyhound walkout
would be premature because federal mediators are working on the
matter, said spokeswoman Dale Tate.
   Greyhound's 6,300 drivers and about 3,000 of its office and
maintenance workers walked out March 2 over wages and job security.
The company, which operates the only nationwide bus system, has
been running on a reduced schedule since then, using replacements
and union members who cross picket lines.
   Officials of both Greyhound and the striking Amalgamated Transit
Union say Congress might be paying closer attention if middle- or
high-income Americans used buses.
   ``If this were happening to airplanes, it would be in every
politician's speech, in every headline,'' said Greyhound Chairman
Fred G. Currey.
   Added union spokesman Jeffrey Nelson: ``These people aren't
spending their spare time writing letters to the editor; they're
not making long distance phone calls to Congress demanding action.''
   Nelson said that although the strike isn't on the top of
Congress' agenda, lawmakers helped persuade the director of the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, Bernard E. DeLury, to
personally involve himself in negotiations.
   ``This is the best we can expect from the government at this
point,'' Nelson said, adding that ``arm waving and standing on
desktops'' wouldn't accomplish a resumption of talks. The company
has refused to return to the bargaining table until a week goes by
without any acts of violence.
   Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va., has called for the House Public Works
and Transportation Committee to hold hearings on the strike, but
without success.
   ``There should be a higher level of consciousness about it,''
Rahall complained. Hearings would ``put pressure on both sides to
sit down and engage in collective bargaining and work toward an
agreement ... I think we should discuss overall safety concerns and
say, `Hey, we are in an emergency here.'''
   Downey said the violent nature of the strike also has kept
lawmakers quiet. Along with sniper attacks, bomb threats and
brick-throwing incidents, one striker was crushed to death by a bus
driven by a replacement driver. On Wednesday night in Boston, a
suspicious fire destroyed a bus, and later its doors were found to
have been welded shut.
   ``There's a level of violence out there no one wants to be
associated with,'' Downey said.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., blamed Congress' reluctance on the
tone Bush set with his Eastern veto. An override attempt in the
House last month failed.
   ``I would be willing to have Congress enter tomorrow, but our
entry would only create thunder'' and accomplish nothing, given the
administration's stand, Williams said.
   ``As with Eastern, the delay by the White House and the Labor
Department benefits management and not the workers. Workers are
going bankrupt daily, unions are being broken and management''
seems to be surviving, Williams said.

   A horde of Hubbles, Hubbells and
possibly even a couple of Hubbels will descend on Kennedy Space
Center next week, drawn by the shuttle launch of a space telescope
that's named for one of their own.
   They are all relatives of the late astronomer Edwin Powell
Hubble, whose discovery in the 1920s that the universe is expanding
gave rise to the big-bang theory of creation.
   The $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope, due to lift off Tuesday
aboard Discovery, is a tribute and memorial to Hubble.
   ``Edwin's being honored by NASA, and it gives us an excuse to
get together and learn a little more about things and to pass the
heritage on to the next generations,'' said Harvey Hubbell IV, 60,
a distant relative and retired businessman from North Palm Beach
who is organizing the affair.
   Nearly 200 descendants of Richard Hubball, a 17th-century
immigrant from England, are expected to begin to arrive this
weekend. The Hubball name has changed over the generations.
   It doesn't matter whether someone is a cousin once, twice or
even thrice removed from the astronomer; everyone is welcome, said
Robert L. Hubbell, 71, president of the Hubbell Family Historical
Society. The retired foreign service officer from Falls Church,
Va., is bringing two grandchildren.
   The family reunions, held every two years (this is an off year),
have tended to attract only the older generations, Hubbell said,
but ``this is catching the interest in the younger generation.''
   Edwin Hubble, who died at age 63 in 1953, studied the stars and
galaxies during the 1920s from Mount Wilson Observatory in the San
Gabriel Mountains above Pasadena, Calif. His survey revealed a much
larger universe than anyone imagined.
   He concluded galaxies were moving away from Earth at velocities
proportional to their distances, supporting the concept that the
universe originated 15 billion or so years ago in a cosmic
explosion known as the big bang.
   There were other noted family members.
   Harvey Hubbell's grandfather, Harvey Hubbell, invented the
pull-chain electric socket and the conventional duplex wall socket.
The factory he started in 1888 in Connecticut has grown into
Hubbell Inc., a Fortune 500 company.
   There was Carl Owen Hubbell, the Hall of Fame pitcher who played
for the New York Giants from 1928 through 1943. John Lorenzo
Hubbell established his first trading post on the Navajo
reservation in northeastern Arizona in 1876.
   The nearly 400 members of the Hubbell Family Historical Society
aren't the only ones with reason to be proud. Relatives from Edwin
Hubble's mother's side also plan to attend the reunion and launch.
   Lena James Jump, 75, a third cousin on his mother's side, will
be there with her three sisters.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration representatives
will meet with the family Monday. The next morning, chartered buses
will take the group to a special viewing area at Kennedy Space
Center, provided the launch is on time.
   A pool party is planned for Tuesday afternoon, followed by a
tour of the space center on Wednesday and a luncheon at nearby
Patrick Air Force Base on Thursday.
   The astronomer's closest living relatives _ two sisters _ aren't
coming.
   Helen Hubble Lane, 91, and Betsy Hubble, 85, are in ill health
and will be watching televised coverage from their homes in El
Paso, Texas.
   The astronomer's wife, Grace, died in 1974, and the couple had
no children. Three other sisters and two brothers are dead.

   Tiananmen Square reopened to the public today,
but police remained on guard to stop any attempt to mourn
protesters killed last year when soldiers stormed the square to
crush the pro-democracy movement.
   The vast plaza was cordoned off on Thursday for the Qingming
festival, an annual holiday when Chinese honor their dead.
   Overseas dissidents, through facsimile transmissions and mailed
leaflets, had urged Beijing residents to stroll through Tiananmen
on Qingming in memory of those killed in the military crackdown
last June.
   But officials cordoned off the square and held ceremonies in
which 13,000 young people paid homage to China's revolutionary
heritage and pledged allegiance to its socialist system.
   Officials also closed the square for official ceremonies on
April 1, another day targeted by overseas activists for silent
protest marches through the symbolic center of last spring's
democracy movement.
   Schools and factories have warned young people to stay away from
Tiananmen and told them they face punishment if caught involved in
any kind of protest.
   Police continued to maintain a heavy presence around the
100-acre square today. Police vehicles were parked at strategic
points, and dozens of officers were on patrol.
   The monument to revolutionary martyrs in the center of the
square, normally open to the public, was closed. About a dozen
police officers stood around the monument's perimeter and on its
steps, and another 10 officers sat nearby.
   The next key anniversary will be April 15, the day former
Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang, a popular reformist, died.
   His death touched off the demonstrations for democratic reform
that continued until the June 3-4 military attack on the city that
left hundreds, and perhaps thousands, dead.

   Seventeen Soviet lawyers who have watched the
upheaval in their country from afar for the past seven months are
heading home today with plenty of ideas for more changes.
   Some want to help handicapped children and improve Soviet
justice. Another hopes his Soviet rock star client will make
American audiences forget Madonna.
   The 17 are the first to participate in an American Bar
Association program that placed them as interns in U.S. law firms,
law schools and government offices.
   ``We believe these 17, each selected for having a spark of
idealism, will be among the leading players in the continuing
debate on Soviet reforms,'' said Steven Raikin, the program's
director.
   The Soviet visitors, in their early 30s, said there is a lot to
like here but found flaws in the American system they do not want
to duplicate back in the Soviet Union.
   After declaring that the adoption of children in the United
States ``works 10 times better than in the Soviet Union,'' Olga
Djujeva frowned while assessing the American juvenile court system.
   ``It works badly because it is structurally and financially
weak,'' she said. ``This is not how we are going to do it in the
USSR.''
   Ms. Djujeva, a Moscow State University teacher who specializes
in family law and children's rights, said her experiences at the
law schools of Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., and Valparaiso
University in Indiana have given her ``a renewed commitment to
change things.''
   ``We have no foster parenting in the Soviet Union. We someday
will. And handicapped children _ we do not see them because they
are in special institutions. In this country, handicapped children
are part of your open society.''
   The ABA program, funded by the New York-based Soros Foundation
and other private donors, was created in anticipation of the
growing opportunities for joint Soviet-American business and to
foster mutual understanding between lawyers in both countries.
   ``We learned as much about the Soviet system as these 17 kids
learned about ours,'' Raikin said. ``Historically, Soviet lawyers
have not occupied a major role in their society. In the last couple
of years, however, there's been an explosion of interest among
Soviet lawyers to play a larger role.''
   Raikin added: ``The next couple of years will be crucial.
Everything's up for grabs right now, the whole legal reform
agenda.''
   Up for grabs also are potentially lucrative business contacts
between East and West, a fact not lost on Valentin Blueger, who has
tried to steer his practice in Latvia to entertainment and
international law.
   Blueger spent his time with the Nashville law firm that
represents the Grand Ole Opry, an experience he says will help him
better represent Soviet rock star Laima Vaikule.
   ``She's like your Madonna,'' Blueger said of the singer who has
sold 20 million records in the Soviet Union and is trying to make
her mark in the U.S. market.
   ``The potential is great,'' says Blueger with a laugh at the
mention of several Soviet athletes now playing in the National
Basketball Association.
   Raikin said the Soviet economy ``is in desperate need of foreign
investment, but not many Soviets know how to facilitate such deals.
Valentin is a natural deal-maker.''
   Irene Mashlenko, an employee of the Soviet Ministry of Justice
in Moscow, split her time in the United States between the staffs
of a state attorney in Montgomery County, Md., and a defense lawyer.
   ``After seeing both sides, I now think that your system of
punishment is very severe, the terms of imprisonment for
non-violent crimes are too long.''
   But one of the most recent criminal trials Mashlenko sat through
ended in acquittal, giving her ``the best evidence that the U.S.
system of justice is really a just system.''
   Nearly 200 Soviet lawyers applied for the program, and more than
100 U.S. law firms and law schools applied to become hosts.
   A new competition will begin in June, ending with the selection
next fall of 30 new interns.

   An Amazonian nature reserve the size of
Connecticut could become an important tourist attraction, helping
to show Third World countries they can make more money saving
forests than logging them, conservationists say.
   The Tambo Pata-Candamo Reserve in a remote, nearly uninhabited
Amazon valley has among the highest numbers of rare and exotic
birds and animals of any area in the world, said Charles Munn, an
ornithologist with Wildlife Conservation International in New York.
   Set aside as a reserve, the park could help promote
``ecotourism'' as a means for Third World nations to profit from
their wilderness areas without destroying them, Munn said.
   Before being declared a park Feb. 17, the area covered by the
3.7-million-acre reserve had been drawing about 9,000 tourists a
year, generating $2 million annually for Peru.
   ``This area can be self-sustaining immediately if they enact a
gate fee of even $5 a day per visitor,'' Munn said. ``This is
unusual. It could simply live off of gate receipts.''
   About one out of every eight species of birds in the world is
found in Tambo Pata, Munn said in an interview Tuesday.
   ``In three square miles of southeastern Peru, you can see 560
species, which is a world record,'' he said. ``You can see 330 in
one day. Which is not bad.''
   All of Canada and the United States have only about 830 species.
   Among the Peruvian birds are eight species of brightly colored
macaws, the world's largest and most endangered parrots. They
congregate in great wildlife spectacles around ``macaw licks,''
where they eat clay to help digest their food.
   The reserve is also home to the endangered, 6-foot-long giant
otter, which travels in family packs and eats anacondas, among
other delicacies. The park has ``white-water rafting that will
knock your socks off,'' Munn said.
   Peru announced last month the establishment of a 1-million-acre
reserve, Kugapakori-Nahua Indian Reserve, to protect the Kugapakori
and Nahua Indians, who remain out of contact with civilization,
Munn said.
   ``If you go in there, they kill you,'' said Munn. ``So you don't
go in there.''
   The two new reserves are near the Manu Biosphere Reserve, an
even larger park roughly the size of Massachusetts.
   This area of Peru is not among those affected by guerrilla and
cocaine trafficking violence, Munn said. ``I take my family down
with me, including two young children,'' he said.
   ``Peru has a fantastic system of parks and reserves on paper,''
said Adrian Forsyth, a tropical ecologist with Conservation
International in Washington, D.C. ``If they can just get the
support needed to have them operate, I think conservation in Peru
will be in pretty good shape.''
   The Tambo Pata-Candamo Reserve, located north of the city of
Puerto Maldonado, about 500 miles southeast of Lima, covers a
varied landscape in the Andes foothills ranging from lowland
tropical rain forest to mist-shrouded cloud forest at elevations up
to 10,000 feet.
   Besides its spectacular bird population, it contains half again
as many trees as any other region in the Amazon, Munn said. And it
is virtually untouched.
   ``The important thing here is there are basically no people
living in this entire area,'' said Munn. ``It is the last big
valley in entire western Amazon that has no people living in it.''
   Peru is also considering setting aside several million
additional acres of rubber and brazil-nut forest in the area
adjacent to the part of Brazil where Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes, an
environmental activist and rubber tapper, was murdered in December
1988, Munn said.

   Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, and six Democratic colleagues are off to the Soviet Union
today for talks with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Lithuania is sure to be on the agenda when the senators see
Gorbachev and other Soviet officials.
   While the group intends to talk with leaders of the Baltic
republics in Leningrad before they head to Moscow, Mitchell said
they won't try to cross into Lithuania, which is trying to secede
from the Soviet Union.
   Mitchell said Thursday that he and Senate Minority Leader Bob
Dole, R-Kan., had been assured by visiting Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze that the Soviets want to solve the Lithuanian
situation by negotiation and dialogue.
   ``They have concluded as a matter of policy that a process that
does not involve the use of force is in their best interest,''
Mitchell said.
   Dole said the senators warned Shevardnadze that Congress might
retaliate against Moscow with trade sanctions and other economic
pressures if Gorbachev uses further military force in seeking to
quell the Lithuanian independence movement.
   ``I've got to believe they clearly understand there's going to
be a big gap here in our relationship if something happens in
Lithuania or Estonia or any other republic,'' Dole said.
``Congress, if anything happens, is going to go off on its own.''
   And Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., urged President Bush to take
action in support of the Lithuanians and to ``make the U.S.
position clear'' to Shevardnadze.
   Mitchell said the congressional delegation will travel to Berlin
before going to the Soviet Union. The group returns April 14.
   Traveling with Mitchell are Democratic Sens. Bill Bradley of New
Jersey, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, Wyche Fowler of Georgia, John
Glenn of Ohio, Jim Sasser of Tennessee and Paul Sarbanes of
Maryland.
   Meantime, Dole is taking four Republican senators and a lone
Democrat _ Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, on a swing through the
Middle East.
   The contingent intends to visit Syria, Egypt, Jordan and Israel
during the congressional Easter recess that ends April 18.
   Dole, who recently angered the Israelis with calls to reduce the
amount of money they receive in aid from the United States, said
his message will be ``Let's get some peace in the Middle East.''
   ``Everywhere else in the world, peace is breaking out except in
this troubled region,'' he said. ``We want to see more progress and
we want to see more talking and negotiations.''
   Meetings are planned with President Hafez Assad of Syria, top
Israeli leaders Shimon Peres and Yitzhak Shamir, President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan.
   Others on the trip are Sens. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.; James
McClure, R-Idaho; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; and Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska.

   Taxpayers could elect to check off $3 instead
of the current $1 on their income tax returns to finance federal
election campaigns under a new public funding proposal by three
Democratic senators.
   Sens. John Kerry of Massachusetts, Joseph Biden of Delaware and
Bill Bradley of New Jersey, all seeking re-election this year,
introduced a bill Thursday to expand public financing of
presidential campaigns to congressional races as well.
   Kerry acknowledged that the proposal, to be offered as an
amendment to a campaign reform bill already approved by the Senate
Rules Committee, faces ``an uphill fight'' when the legislation is
considered by the full Senate, most likely next month.
   Democratic leaders in both the House and Senate and public
interest groups such as Common Cause have all but abandoned hopes
of winning passage of public campaign financing in the face of
intense opposition from President Bush and other Republicans.
   But Kerry, Bradley and Biden said taxpayer financing is the only
way to fully reform a system discredited by politicians raising
campaign dollars from individuals and groups who then expect
special treatment from the government.
   ``We are engaged in what I fear is moderate reform,'' said
Biden. ``I fear that moderate reform is somewhat like moderate
chastity. The mere existence of money means to some that the entire
process is tainted.''
   If advertised and promoted by the Internal Revenue Service and
the Federal Election Commission, Kerry said, the checkoff could
raise an estimated $60 million for every two-year election cycle
despite a recent decline in its use by taxpayers for presidential
campaigns.
   ``The tail-off has been a reflection of the fact there has been
no push to get people to do it ... and the increased cynicism of
the public _ they don't want to contribute their dollars to a
system they don't think is sensitive to them,'' he said.
   When Senate Democrats last tried to pass a public campaign
financing law two years ago, they were unable in eight attempts to
break a Republican filibuster.
   Since then, many Democrats, after reaping large contributions
from labor and corporate political action committees in recent
years, also have become wary of public financing.
   ``If we need to have another filibuster, then let's have another
filibuster,'' Kerry said. ``Just because you fail once doesn't mean
you shouldn't come back and test whether there's a change in
consciousness.''
   On a strict party-line vote, the Senate Rules Committee last
month approved a bill by Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
and Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., that would impose voluntary spending
caps ranging from $1.6 million to $9.2 million on individual Senate
candidates.
   But Democrats acknowledged that was just a starting shot to
force the start of serious negotiations.
   Both Mitchell and Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas have
somewhat embraced the recommendations of a bipartisan task force
they appointed calling for ``flexible'' spending ceilings, no
public financing and a diminished role for PACs and out-of-state
contributors.
   In the House, there has been little progress in narrowing
disagreements between the two parties and within each party.
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., and Republican leader Robert H.
Michel of Illinois met for 40 minutes on the issue Wednesday but
agreed only to meet again when Congress returns April 18 from a
spring recess.

   Justice Department official Michael Boudin,
the son of noted civil liberties lawyer Leonard B. Boudin, is under
consideration for a federal judgeship by the Bush administration,
according to sources familiar with the selection procedure.
   Boudin, 50, a deputy assistant attorney general for antitrust,
is being considered for a vacancy on the U.S. District Court here,
said the sources, who spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity.
   The FBI is conducting a background check and the American Bar
Association's judicial screening committee is interviewing lawyers
to assess Boudin's qualifications.
   The possible nomination by a Republican president is interesting
because Boudin's father was long associated with left-wing causes
and his sister, Kathy Boudin, is an imprisoned radical.
   But Michael Boudin is a quintessential member of the legal
establishment who has a reputation as an outstanding appellate
lawyer.
   He was graduated first in his class from Harvard Law School in
1964, clerked for Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan II and
became a partner at the prestigious Washington law firm of
Covington &amp; Burling.
   An administration official said Boudin's name has been cleared
with conservatives who might be expected to raise opposition
because of the notoriety of his family. Boudin is highly regarded
by conservatives, the official said.
   The nomination, if made by Bush, would be subject to Senate
confirmation.
   Leonard Boudin, who died last fall, was a respected civil
liberties attorney who represented actor-singer Paul Robeson as
well as anti-war activists Daniel Ellsberg and Benjamin Spock. He
also represented Cuban government interests in this country.
   The elder Boudin's most famous legal victory was a 1958 Supreme
Court decision that held the State Department could not revoke
passports for political reasons.
   Michael Boudin's sister, Kathy, is serving a 20-year prison term
for murder arising from her involvement in a 1981 armored truck
robbery in Rockland County, N.Y., in which a guard and two police
officers were killed.
   Previously, Ms. Boudin, 46, had been a fugitive wanted for
questioning about a 1970 explosion in a Greenwich Village townhouse
in New York City that killed three members of the Weather
Underground.

<TEXT>
   Parent groups leery of rock song lyrics about
sex and violence are pinning their hopes on a new music industry
labeling plan and are asking state lawmakers to end their drives to
require warning stickers.
   ``We are asking state lawmakers to give the voluntary system a
chance to work,'' Tipper Gore, president of the Parents' Music
Resource Center, said Thursday at a news conference.
   She and Ann Lynch, president of the National PTA, said an
industry-wide voluntary system is a better answer to parents' needs
than mandatory labeling.
   ``We can accommodate the rights of artists to express themselves
freely with the rights of parents, of consumers, to know, for
example, if the music their kids want to buy says suicide is a good
idea,'' Gore said.
   She said legislators in 13 states have agreed to abandon
attempts to pass or revive bills to require warning labels on
recordings. She urged a similar course in the six states where such
measures are still pending.
   Six major record companies _ Warner Brothers, MCA, CBS,
Capitol-EMI, RCA and Polygram _ said last week that they plan to
create an industry-wide standard for warning labels.
   Gore's group and the PTA, among others, have expressed concern
about music they believe encourages violence, suicide, drug use,
sexual promiscuity, bigotry and Satan worship.
   Gore and Lynch said they were confident the uniform standard
would result in better compliance than a 1985 agreement that called
for voluntary warnings or printed lyrics on albums the companies
determined to be violent or explicit.
   ``We take the industry on good faith that they really do mean to
seriously address the problem. We take them at their word and we
believe they will do the job correctly this time,'' Gore said.
   It still will be up to recording companies to decide which music
merits a warning label, she said. But she said the commitment to
create a standardized label shows the industry ``is willing to
provide the tools to make a voluntary system work. Now it is up to
parents to use that tool wisely.''
   Tom Susman, a member of the West Virginia House of Delegates,
said he had withdrawn a mandatory labeling bill inspired by a local
disk jockey's concern.
   ``We hope for a positive outcome,'' Susman said of the latest
music industry scheme. ``If not ... then it will be up to the
legislators to look at this issue again.''
   Record merchandising industry executives indicated last week
that pressure from state legislatures was at least partly
responsible for their decision to standardize and try to broaden
the labeling system. The music industry has been lobbying hard in
state capitols to kill legislation to require warning labels.
   States where lawmakers have promised not to pursue or revive
mandatory labeling bills include Arizona, Iowa, Maryland, Oklahoma,
West Virginia, Alaska, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, New Mexico, New
York, Tennessee and Rhode Island, Gore's group said.
   Measures sponsored by others are still alive in New York and
Rhode Island, according to the National Association of Recording
Merchandisers. Bills also are pending in Missouri, Florida,
Delaware and Pennsylvania.

   The United States lands in the middle of the pack
in rankings of life expectancy and death rates in 33 developed
nations, according to new figures from U.S. health officials.
   Atop the list: Japan.
   In the United States, the average life expectancy is 75 years,
trailing Japan by 4.1 years, but beating the lowest of the 33,
Hungary, by more than five years, the national Centers for Disease
Control reported Thursday.
   The average Hungarian lives 69.7 years, the CDC said.
   The United States also ranked near the middle of the 33 nations
in death rates from all causes: 828.4 deaths are reported for each
100,000 people each year. Japan was best at 628.8; Romania worst at
1,242.
   The leading cause of death in the United States, heart disease,
hits harder here than in other countries. The U.S. mortality rate
from heart disease was 382 per 100,000 per year for men and 214 for
women, compared with 339 and 206 in the other 32 developed
countries.
   Throughout the 33 countries, heart disease accounted for 30
percent of deaths, with cancer causing 21 percent and stroke
causing 14 percent.
   Fourteen percent of deaths in the 33 countries _ about 1.5
million a year _ are attributed to smoking, the CDC said.
   Fewer Americans smoke, compared with the other countries; 31
percent of U.S. males and 26 percent of American females smoke,
compared with 41 percent of men and 29 percent of women in the
other countries.
   ``The large number of deaths attributable to cigarette smoking
indicates that reduction of this risk factor would substantially
increase life expectancy in the developed world,'' the
Atlanta-based CDC said.
   The CDC study included countries defined as developed according
to a 1963 U.N. standard pegged to reproductive rates: countries
where the average woman has fewer than two daughters who,
themselves, survive their childbearing years.
   Such areas include the United States and Canada, the Soviet
Union, most of Europe, some Latin American nations, Japan and
Australia.
   The CDC study cited life expectancies and death rates in the
latest available statistics for each country, from 1984 to 1987.
   Life expectancies for the 33 countries: Australia 76.3 years,
Austria 75.1, Belgium 74.3, Bulgaria 71.5, Canada 76.5,
Czechoslovakia 71.0, Denmark 74.9, East Germany 73.2, Finland 74.8,
France 75.9, Greece 76.5, Hungary 69.7, Iceland 77.4, Ireland 73.5,
Israel 75.2, Italy 75.5, Japan 79.1, Luxembourg 74.1, Malta 74.8,
Netherlands 76.5, New Zealand 74.2, Norway 76.3, Poland 71.0,
Portugal 74.1, Romania 69.9, Spain 76.6, Sweden 77.1, Switzerland
77.6, United Kingdom 75.3, United States 75.0, U.S.S.R. 69.8, West
Germany 75.8, Yugoslavia 71.0.

   Just as smallpox was wiped out in the 1970s, two
other debilitating diseases, polio and guinea worm, could be wiped
out in the near future, global health advocates say.
   The International Task Force for Disease Eradication said
Thursday, in a report published by the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control, that eradication of guinea worm disease, which strikes 10
million people a year, largely in the Third World, ``is feasible,
if the necessary commitment and resources can be mobilized.''
   And worldwide polio eradication ``is technically possible'' by
2000, the task force said.
   But three other global maladies _ measles, tuberculosis and
leprosy _ are ``not now eradicable,'' the task force said, citing
the need for better measles vaccine, improved tests for TB and
leprosy and the ``social stigma'' surrounding the latter.
   The benchmark in disease eradication came in 1977, when smallpox
was eliminated from the planet, with efforts spurred largely by the
United States.
   People around the world continue to be plagued by guinea worm
and polio, and ``public and political awareness'' along with
``increased national and international commitment'' will be needed
to eradicate them, the task force reported.
   ``Whatever priority countries might give to these diseases, the
matter of resources, to the countries concerned, is often very
great,'' said Dr. Donald Hopkins, project director for the task
force.
   ``The ideal situation,'' he said, is one in which ``the more
affluent countries have a direct national stake in seeing that a
disease is eradicated, and are helping less affluent countries to
get rid of it.''
   The task force, launched at the Carter Center of Emory
University in Atlanta, includes representatives from the World
Health Organization; the United Nations Children's Fund, or UNICEF;
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and other agencies.
   The task force's assessment on eight worldwide diseases:
   _Guinea worm disease: Infects 10 million a year. Eradication is
feasible with commitment and resources. The Carter Center last week
announced that American Cyanimid Co. donated enough of a
guinea-worm fighting chemical to make eradication possible within
five years.
   _Polio: Kills 25,000 a year. Eradication is technically
possible, improved vaccine would help. Goal: to eliminate in
western hemisphere by year's end.
   _Onchocerciasis: Blinds 340,000 a year. Eradication of disease
not now feasible, but associated blindness could be eliminated
through control of carrier worms.
   _Yaws-endemic syphilis: Strikes 2.5 million a year. With
``political and financial inertia,'' eradication not feasible now.
   _Rabies: Kills 52,000 a year, albeit virtually none in the
United States. Eradication not feasible; no vaccine for wild-animal
populations.
   _Measles: Kills 2 million a year. Not now eradicable; virus very
infectious, and vaccine not effective in youngest infants. Hopkins
said he remains somewhat optimistic for the eradication of measles,
which was believed almost wiped out in this country before a
comeback in the last few years. ``Sooner or later, an improved
vaccine is going to be developed,'' he said.
   _Tuberculosis: Kills 2 million to 3 million a year. Eradication
not feasible; need improved tests, chemotherapy and vaccine.
   _Leprosy: Strikes more than 11 million a year. Eradication not
now feasible; need for improved tests and chemotherapy and
overcoming of ``social stigma'' surrounding the disfiguring disease.

<TEXT>
   There is a ticking time bomb in the upcoming
superpower summit between President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev: the status of Lithuania.
   While U.S. officials say they hope the May 30-June 3 summit will
produce major arms agreements, a deterioration of the situation in
the secessionist Baltic republic could have explosive impact on the
summit _ and on future U.S.-Soviet relations.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III spelled this out clearly
in a three-hour private session with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze on Wednesday night, according to both U.S. and Soviet
officials.
   Gennadi Gerasimov, the glib Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman,
had no trouble slipping into American slang when characterizing the
tone of Baker's message.
   ``There was a serious, hardball, exchange of opinions on this
subject, yes sir,'' Gerasimov told a reporter.
   Bush has come under considerable pressure from Congress for not
speaking out more assertively in behalf of Lithuanian independence.
Some lawmakers have threatened the Soviet Union with sanctions if
force is used to thwart Lithuanian freedom.
   ``We are obligated to do whatever we can to encourage the
Soviets to grant the Baltic nations their freedom. What does
America stand for if we don't stand for freedom?'' asked Sen.
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.
   Pro-independence Lithuanian activists have been demonstrating in
front of the White House daily. If the summit is held in
Washington, these demonstrators are likely to provide a noisy and
constant backdrop to any Bush-Gorbachev talks.
   Just hours after the superpower summit was announced on
Thursday, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., suggested that
the current level of tension in Lithuania makes holding the summit
``a little more difficult.''
   If Moscow escalates its crackdown in Lithuania or moves with
force in the other Baltic republics of Estonia or Latvia, Congress
could react angrily ``about trade or anything else dealing with the
Soviet Union,'' Dole said.
   He said he was less certain whether ``it would spill over into
arms control agreements.''
   To date, Bush's approach has been cautious and nonjudgmental _
voicing general support for the self-determination rights of
Lithuanian citizens but declining to criticize Gorbachev for the
steps he has taken so far.
   Bush has urged restraint on both sides and a peaceful resolution
of the crisis that began March 11 when the Lithuanian parliament
declared independence from Moscow.
   ``Lithuania makes the summit all the more important,'' said
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. He suggested ``tough love''
tactics would be in order for dealing with the Soviet leadership.
   Bush no doubt had Lithuania on his mind when he commented on the
first superpower summit of his presidency on U.S. soil: ``This is
time for a lot of dialogue and a lot of discussion.''
   At this point, no one knows just how the Lithuania wild card
will be played.
   U.S. officials say the existing situation in Lithuania is not
such that it would interfere with summit planning.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, who begins a five-day
visit of the Soviet Union today as part of a six-member Democratic
Senate delegation, applauded Bush for deciding to go ahead with the
superpower meeting.
   After he met with Bush on Thursday, Mitchell was asked if
Lithuania was casting a cloud of uncertainty over the summit.
   ``The answer to that requires the development of further
events,'' Mitchell said.
   ``We don't know what events may occur in Lithuania,'' Mitchell
added. ``It is my hope that there will be a peaceful resolution of
the situation in Lithuania and that the United States and the
Soviet Union will reach meaningful, fair, balanced and verifiable
agreement on arms.''
   The United States has never recognized the 1940 forced
incorporation of the three Baltic republics into the Soviet Union.
But neither has it extended diplomatic recognition to the new
government of Lithuania formed March 11.
   Moscow has repeatedly said force won't be used against Lithuania
_ and Shevardnadze reiterated that view in his meetings with Baker
this week.
   Furthermore, in recent days both sides have shown they may be
willing to negotiate a compromise.
   Even so, any change for the worse could threaten to make the
upcoming summit even more turbulent than the storm-tossed session
Bush and Gorbachev experienced at their shipboard Mediterranean
summit in December at Malta.

   The government said it will seek a
change in the constitution after King Baudouin was restored to
power following a two-day suspension that allowed him to avoid
signing an abortion bill into law.
   At the request of Baudouin, a devout Catholic long opposed to
abortion, the government suspended him Wednesday, then passed the
abortion bill itself and asked the legislature to restore the king.
   Parliament, by a 245-to-0 vote, restored the king as head of
state Thursday. However, 93 lawmakers abstained and 58 were absent.
   Prime Minister Wilfried Martens told lawmakers that ``to prevent
a recurrence of similar problems in the future, the government ...
intends to propose a structural change'' in the constitution.
   He did not elaborate. But his center-left government will likely
seek to curtail the king's already largley ceremonial powers even
further, possibly by removing the need for the king's signature
before a bill can become law.
   The suspension set off a debate about the role of the king and
his already largely ceremonial powers.
   Legal experts say the king cannot cast aside his constitutional
role on moral grounds, only if he is physically or mentally unable
to rule.
   Vatican Radio in Rome praised the king, calling his stand a
``noble and courageous choice'' that was dictated by his ``very
strong moral conscience and his undisputible sense of statehood.''
   Parliament adopted the abortion bill March 29. It allows
abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if a doctor deems his
patient to be ``in a state of distress.'' Until now, abortion was a
criminal offense.

<HEAD>Study: Most Women Don't Suffer Post-Abortion Mental Health
Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Some women may feel regret, sadness or guilt,
but most do not develop mental health problems from legal,
voluntary abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy, according
to a study published today.
   The study in Science magazine said some women may experience
emotional distress, but for the vast majority, ``legal abortion of
an unwanted pregnancy in the first trimester does not pose a
psychological hazard.''
   Olivia Gans, director of American Victims of Abortion, called
the study ``a manipulation'' and a ``rehash'' of data from earlier
studies.
   ``When you look at these studies, you can twist them any way you
need to to get whatever conclusion you want,'' she said.
   The new study was commissioned by the American Psychological
Association, which asked six experts to examine all current
research and determine if a valid conclusion could be drawn about
post-abortion psychological effects.
   Nancy E. Adler, a University of California-San Francisco
professor of psychiatry and lead author of the report, said the
panel surveyed more than 200 studies and found only ``about 19 or
20'' that met solid scientific standards.
   Once those studies were examined, she said, the conclusion ``was
really quite clear.''
   The APA convened the panel in 1988 after then-Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop said studies were inadequate to draw final conclusions
about the effects of abortion on women's mental health.
   In the Science report, the authors said case studies have shown
that some women do experience ``severe distress ... after abortion
and require sympathetic care.''
   But for most women who have voluntary abortions, ``severe
negative reactions are infrequent in the immediate and short-term
aftermath,'' the study said, while the greatest distress ``is
likely to be before the abortion.''
   ``Severe negative reactions after abortions are rare and can
best be understood in the framework of coping with a normal life
stress,'' the study said.
   ``I feel comfortable about the conclusion that there is little
psychological hazard for women,'' Adler said in a telephone
interview. But she noted that there is a need for scientific
studies that would compare the effects of abortion with that of
other stressful events in life, such as divorce or death of a
family member.
   Adler said studies of the psychological effects of a death have
shown that if there is no negative mental health response within a
few months, there is little likelihood that one will develop later.
   As a result, she said, ``there is reason to believe that there
will be very little long-term effect'' from abortion. But she
added: ``As a scientist, I really can't say anything beyond two
years.''
   ``Two years is not enough,'' said Gans, who said she had an
abortion in 1981. ``I know many years later you still have to deal
with emotional debris of that experience.''
   She said the effects can show up five to 10 years later and she
described them as similar to the post-traumatic stress disorder
experienced by combat veterans.
   Gans' organization, American Victims of Abortion, is associated
with the National Right to Life Committee.
   Other findings of the Science report include:
   _Most women report feelings of relief and happiness after a
first trimester abortion. One study showed that 76 percent of women
reported feeling relief two weeks after an abortion and only 17
percent reported guilt.
   _A study of 360 adolescents seeking pregnancy tests compared
those who were not pregnant, those who were pregnant and sought
abortion and those who carried their babies to term. After two
years, the study said, ``the abortion group showed, if anything, a
more positive psychological profile than either of the other two
groups.''
   _Women obtaining second trimester abortions, according to one
study, experienced more distress than those getting abortions in
the first three months of the pregnancy. Those having difficulty
deciding on abortion are also more apt to experience negative
effects afterward, the study said.
   In addition to Adler, the coauthors of the Science study were:
Henry P. David of the Transitional Family Research Institute in
Bethesda, Md.; Brenda N. Major of the State University of New York,
Buffalo; Susan H. Roth of Duke University, Durham, N.C.; Nancy F.
Russo of Arizona State University, Tempe; and Gail E. Wyatt,
University of California, Los Angeles.

   A deadly Ebola virus outbreak among imported
laboratory monkeys apparently isn't harming people, as evidenced by
four animal handlers who have become infected, but not sick.
   The virus, related to the deadly Ebola virus of Africa, has
turned up in monkeys from three Philippine importers since fall.
The licenses of three of the nation's largest monkey importers have
been revoked amid concerns about the virus's spread.
   Researchers with the national Centers for Disease Control said
Thursday that four workers at Hazleton Research Products of Reston,
Va. _ the first laboratory where the virus appeared _ have now been
infected. But unlike African Ebola virus, which attacks suddenly
and produces serious and often fatal illness, the virus from the
Philippines isn't making humans sick.
   ``In nobody's book can this virus be considered the same,'' said
Dr. Susan Fisher-Hoch, a CDC specialist in Ebola virus. ``It's not
as pathogenic, that's for sure.
   ``You would expect them to be ill within a few days of
exposure.''
   She said researchers have no idea why this latest virus, which
has killed numbers of monkeys, is not affecting the humans it
infects.
   ``We don't know,'' Ms. Fisher-Hoch said, adding that the virus
does have ``a high rate of transmission.''
   The four infected workers were among five animal handlers at
Hazleton who had what the CDC termed ``a high level of daily
exposure'' to the infected animals.
   In a 1976 epidemic of Ebola virus in Zaire, it is believed that
98 percent of the people infected became ill and the fatality rate
among patients was 88 percent.
   Inspectors from the CDC are continuing to check the three large
primate importers who were shut down last month, as well as other
importers. No decision has yet been made regarding when the three
might resume business, Ms. Fisher-Hoch said.
   CDC researchers suspect that the Philippine virus _ which is
closely related to African Ebola, but not identical _ does not
reproduce itself well once it infects a person.
   One of the animal handlers who became infected showed high
levels of antibodies to the virus, but tests to detect the actual
virus in his blood were unsuccessful, Ms. Fisher-Hoch said.
   ``He had cut himself, so we knew he was most definitely
inoculated with the virus,'' she said. ``But he never developed a
high load of virus in the blood.
   ``That's an indication _ in one case _ that the virus does not
replicate very well.''

   The assailants who massacred six men and boys in
a reputed crack house may have been stoned on drugs or seeking
revenge for a deal gone bad, officials said.
   City Councilman Gilbert Hill, former head of the police
department's homicide division, said he saw little difference.
   ``Most of the time it's not a turf battle, just thugs robbing
each other,'' Hill said. ``Some of these guys walking around with
Uzis and .44 Magnums, they have the brain of an ant. I don't think
it's part of any organized conspiracy.''
   The Wednesday night attack was the worst multiple murder in
Detroit since June 1971, when seven members of a heroin ring were
found shot to death in a west side apartment.
   No arrests had been made by Thursday night, Officer Thomas
Martinelli said.
   The victims ranged in age from 15 to 32.
   According to accounts from witnesses, a woman and two men burst
into the house, forced the victims to lie on the floor and started
shooting them.
   Four of the dead were found on the second floor of the bungalow.
Each had been shot in the head, Buck said.
   The two other victims, one of whom died shortly after arriving
at a hospital, were shot trying to run downstairs and were found in
the basement.
   Buck declined to discuss a possible motive, and calls to the
department's homicide, narcotics and special crimes units weren't
returned.
   A neighbor said the bungalow where the shootings occurred was
one of a number of crack houses in the area.
   ``It's a drug deal gone bad,'' said Alonzo Johnson, 26. ``They
are dealing drugs on every other house on every other street in
this neighborhood. It's bad.''

<HEAD>Clean Air Bill Heading to House Floor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A far-reaching clean air bill goes to the
House floor after clearing a committee by a lopsided 42-1 vote,
moving Congress a step closer to enacting tougher air pollution
controls.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee approved the complex and
costly clean air package late Thursday after resolving the thorny
issue of helping Midwest utilities cope with tougher acid rain
controls.
   The acid rain compromise, approved 39-4, aims to help Midwest
states pay for cleaning up pollution caused by utility plants by
providing a ``pollution allowance'' system and a one-year extension
for initial compliance in some cases.
   Critics of the measure have said it would cause electric rates
to jump. Legislation passed by the Senate earlier this week
includes a similar provision.
   Pleas from some Midwest congressmen for a nationwide energy fee
or tax were rejected.
   The compromise ``allows us to recoup some costs,'' said Rep.
Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, although indicating he would like to have
seen more aid for the region. ``This is a tough, tough bill for my
part of the country and we're going to feel it for a long time.''
   ``A lot of blood was spilled in these debates,'' said Rep. Jim
Cooper, D-Tenn., who vigorously opposed proposals such as a tax or
energy fee to help the Midwest.
   Only Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., voted against the House
measure.
   Like the Senate bill approved 89-11 on Tuesday, the House
legislation calls for sweeping emission controls on automobiles and
industry, including a requirement that electric utilities cut
annual sulfur dioxide emissions by 10 million tons, or roughly in
half.
   Sulfur dioxide, especially from Midwest electric power plants
that use high sulfur coal, is the source of the acid rain that has
caused problems with lakes and streams in much of the Northeast and
mid-Atlantic states.
   The Bush administration has estimated the Senate legislation
would cost the economy $21.5 billion a year when all provisions go
into effect.
   The House bill has been said to be slightly cheaper.
Environmentalists say much of that cost will be offset by lower
health costs.
   House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., has indicated he wants to
begin floor action on the clean air bill by early May. The House
and Senate versions then would have to be worked out in a
conference committee.
   Several congressmen have indicated they intend to pursue
additional amendments on the House floor. But congressional sources
suggested Thursday that it is unlikely that major changes will be
made in light of the one-sided committee vote.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the panel chairman, said the
legislation was ``significantly better'' in protecting the
environment than the Senate version.
   Dingell's committee tackled the most controversial aspects of
the legislation _ including the acid rain issue _ behind closed
doors. Private committee negotiations last week produced
compromises on controlling urban smog and releasing toxic
industrial chemicals.
   More than 150 lobbyists, representing everything from
environmental groups to oil and chemical companies, gathered
outside the closed committee hearing room Wednesday and Thursday as
committee members and their staffs worked out the acid rain
agreement.
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., for years a leading advocate in
Congress for tougher air pollution controls, noted it had been
eight years since the full committee tackled clean air legislation.
   ``This legislation is long overdue,'' agreed Rep. Gerry
Sikorski, D-Minn. ``It's a real victory for our lakes, lungs and
resources.''
   Meanwhile, the latest survey by the Environmental Protection
Agency released Thursday showed that, using 1988 figures, smog
continues to plague more than 100 cities and affect about 121
million people.

<HEAD>Measure Would Make Ag Secretary King of Compost</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some in Congress want to create the job of
compost czar and think Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter should
wear the title.
   A House Agriculture subcommittee headed by Rep. George E. Brown
Jr., D-Calif., approved by voice vote Thursday an amendment to the
1990 farm bill that would require Yeutter to designate a 15-member
Compost Task Force, which he would head.
   The measure, if it became law, would require a study of methods
used to make compost out of agricultural waste. Evaluations would
include wastes from ``the production, processing and distribution
of food, fiber, forestry, livestock and fish products.'' Compost is
a mixture of decomposing vegetable refuse used for soil
fertilization.
   Officials at the Agriculture Department were apparently caught
off-guard by the compost amendment.
   Kelly Shipp, Yeutter's press secretary, said she had not been
aware of a move to create a compost bureaucracy. Until there was an
opportunity to study the proposal, Ms. Shipp said, there would be
no Yeutter position on the matter.
   But surely, she joked, this wouldn't mean that everybody would
have to bring their grass clippings to USDA just because Yeutter
was the nation's compost czar.
   ``What are we, up to about $30 billion by now for what everybody
wants in the farm bill?,'' she said. ``If we put together all the
task forces and special offices they want us to have, we'd probably
have to go out and buy another building as big as the two we have
now.''
   The Brown amendment, which now goes before the full House
Agriculture Committee, said that the composting of agricultural
wastes can help prevent contamination of water supplies and
alleviate waste removal burdens on farmers.
   Further, it said, compost can be ``a safe and useful soil
additive which can help to stabilize and enrich the soil'' and
reduce the use of chemical fertilizers.
   ``The Department of Agriculture is uniquely qualified to
research appropriate uses and markets for compost,'' the proposal
said.
   Among its provisions, the amendment would require Yeutter to
establish standards for compost quality, and come up with
definitions for processing, handling and using compost.
   Further, it would require USDA to ``initiate extension efforts,
including seminars, demonstration projects and dissemination of
materials, to inform the agricultural community'' about the
benefits of compost.

   Low-income families on food stamps will come
out substantially ahead under the new federal minimum wage law,
according to a senior Agriculture Department official.
   ``Every case is different, but most food stamp recipients will
keep at least 64 cents in benefits for each dollar they gain in
wages,'' said Assistant Secretary Catherine Bertini, who oversees
USDA food and consumer services.
   ``The food stamp program is not an alternative to work,'' she
said Thursday in a statement. ``We want to encourage people to
work, earn money and support themselves and their families.''
   The federal minimum wage rose to $3.80 an hour on April 1 from
$3.35 and will rise again next April 1 to $4.25 an hour.
   Food stamp benefits are allocated on the basis of several
factors, including household size and net income as determined by
deducting expenses for such items as housing, utilities and day
care.
   Bertini cited an example of a family of three claiming the
maximum deduction for housing, earning $580 per month in wages and
receiving $207 in food stamps. Under the new minimum wage law, the
family's earnings would increase by $78 to $658 per month, while
food stamp benefits would be reduced by $19 per month.
   That would total $787 per month under the old minimum wage and
$846 under the new law, a net gain of $67 per month, she said.
   ``The gain in wages more than makes up for the loss in food
stamps,'' Bertini said. ``In fact, for each new dollar earned with
the new minimum wage, this household would keep 76 cents in food
stamp benefits.''
   More than 19 million people get benefits under the food stamp
program, which is estimated to cost $14.8 billion this year.

   Be polite, prompt and keep promises if doing
business internationally, says an Agriculture Department report.
   It also helps when traveling to a prospective new market to
learn in advance as much about the country's culture.
   ``For example, when in Mexico, it is customary to inquire about
a colleague's wife and family, whereas in many Middle Eastern
countries it is taboo,'' the report said. ``Patting a U.S.
colleague on the back for congratulations is a common practice. In
Japan, however, this behavior would be discourteous.''
   The suggestions were include in the April issue of AgExporter
magazine by the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   ``Keep promises,'' the report said. ``A good way to lose
customers is to break promises. The biggest complaint from foreign
importers about U.S. suppliers is a failure to ship as promised.''
   Other important consideration involve religious and national
holidays. Trying to conduct business in the United States on the
Fourth of July would be difficult, if not impossible. Likewise,
different dates have special meaning in various countries.
   ``A little research and observance in cultural behavior can go a
long way in international commerce,'' the report said. ``Likewise,
a lack of sensitivity to another's customs can stop a deal in its
tracks.''

   A House bill, created in response to an
alleged rapist's acquittal by jurors who said the woman ``asked for
it,'' would bar evidence from court concerning the rape victim's
clothing.
   A Fort Lauderdale jury last year acquitted Steven Lamar Lord,
26, of Lawrenceville, Ga., after his attorneys introduced as
evidence the victim's miniskirt and testimony that she wasn't
wearing underwear. The defense used the clothing to challenge the
woman's character and attempt to show she was looking for trouble.
   ``It was not relevant at all to whether the person on trial
actually committed the crime,'' the bill's sponsor, Rep. Elaine
Gordon, said Thursday. ``It only had to do with an attack on the
character of the victim.''
   The bill passed a subcommittee of the Criminal Justice Committee
6-0. It will be considered next by the full committee.

   The head of the Social Security Administration
says the agency has erected mind-boggling obstacles to poor,
homeless and disabled people who need its help.
   Far too many people aren't receiving Supplemental Security
Income benefits because they don't know about them, don't
understand them or can't figure out how to apply, Social Security
Commissioner Gwendolyn S. King told the House Select Committee on
Aging on Thursday.
   ``It's more than a little hard,'' she said of the 15-page
application form. ``It boggles the mind.''
   The Supplemental Security Income program provides monthly cash
benefits to poor, aged, blind and disabled people. It provides up
to $386 a month per individual or $579 a month per couple for those
who meet strict and complex rules that take into account ordinary
Social Security payments and other income.
   About 4.6 million people receive the benefits, but studies have
concluded that as many as 50 percent of those eligible for SSI are
not participating.
   A 1988 survey conducted for the American Association of Retired
People found that nearly one-fourth of those over 65 living near or
below the poverty line had never heard of it, and only 22 percent
received its benefits.
   King said that when she took the job last year she found the
program of SSI benefits ``an absolute maze, a patchwork of
information and instructions that confused me.''
   The agency has a moral obligation to find eligible people and
help them apply and will increase its outreach efforts, but no
large new appropriation is needed, she said.
   Maria Foscarinis, director of the National Law Center on
Homelessness and Poverty, a private advocacy group, criticized the
Social Security Administration, saying the government failed to get
benefits to homeless people ``suffering the most extreme
deprivation imaginable.''
   Bills in the House and Senate would require the Social Security
Administration to regularly visit shelters to explain benefits,
help homeless people apply and provide other assistance.
   Congress authorized the agency to conduct outreach demonstration
projects in 1987 but the agency never conducted them, arguing no
money was appropriated. Congress provided $3.5 million for research
into outreach programs and demonstration projects in the current
budget.

<HEAD>Rare Navy Biplane Recovered from Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has recovered the only surviving
example of a pre-World War II fighter from the Pacific bottom where
it sat for almost 50 years.
   Probes had shown the plane was in near-perfect condition for
most of the time it was underwater. But a fishing net recently
damaged the plane, which was pulled out of the ocean Wednesday,
officials said.
   The F3F-2 fighter, a biplane made by the Grumman Corp., was
discovered more than a year ago in about 2,000 feet of water some
10 miles off the coastline.
   The salvage effort, funded by the San Diego Aerospace Museum,
was coordinated with a Navy effort to recover a helicopter that
crashed in the same area last year.
   Robert Rasmussen, director of the naval museum, was upset the
plane was damaged before it could be recovered.
   ``It was on the bottom for 49 years and was in absolutely
perfect condition when it was found and then to come back and find
it's been torn apart by a fishing net ... it's very disappointing,
extremely disappointing,'' Rasmussen said.
   Sometime during the past several months, a fishing net snared
and dragged the plane several hundred feet across the ocean. The
plane's two right wings and the pilot's canopy were torn off and
the tail severely damaged.
   The plane was ditched Aug. 29, 1940, when the pilot, Robert
Galer, was unable to reach the aircraft carrier Saratoga.
   Galer, a 76-year-old retired brigadier general, returned to see
the salvage operation Thursday.
   ``I just wanted to get it down, then worry about being sorry,''
Galer said about his 1940 flight. ``It's nice to see an old friend
after so long, but I hate to see it so beat up.''
   The plane will be restored at the San Diego Aerospace Museum and
then shipped to the National Museum of Naval Aviation in Pensacola,
Fla. It is the only surviving example of the Navy's pre-war fighter.
   A similar, civilian version of the plane is on display at the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

   Steven Curtis Chapman, who has been
making records for just three years after giving up his ambition to
become a doctor, has been voted gospel music's artist of the year
and top male vocalist.
   He won the two top honors and three others Thursday night at the
Gospel Music Association's 21st annual Dove Awards presentations.
   ``My prayer and desire is to represent Christian music to honor
my peers and the one to whom we all sing for: our Lord, Jesus
Christ,'' he said after the show.
   The 27-year-old Chapman's other awards, presented during a live
broadcast on cable's The Nashville Network, were songwriter of the
year and songwriting honors for the tunes ``His Strength Is
Perfect'' and ``I Can See the Hands.''
   Sandi Patti, who has dominated gospel music awards for much of
the past decade, was chosen best female vocalist for the ninth
straight time. She also received a Dove trophy for ``The Friendship
Company,'' voted top children's music gospel album.
   ``It's a privilege to travel around the country and remind
people they are not losers in heaven's eyes,'' Miss Patti said
during the 90-minute ceremony at the Tennessee Performing Arts
Center.
   She had been voted top artist in 1987 and 1988 and was a
finalist this year in the category that Chapman won for the first
time.
   ``I'm so proud of Steven,'' she said about the rising Christian
music star whose No. 1 gospel hits include ``His Eyes'' and ``My
Turn Now.''
   The Winans, a brother-sister duo from a well-known gospel music
family in Detroit, won four awards to add to the two Grammy honors
they won in February in Los Angeles. The four awards: best group;
No. 1 contemporary black song for ``With My Whole Heart''; and top
contemporary album and best contemporary recorded song, both for
``Heaven.''
   ``The Lord has appointed us for this time,'' CeCe Winans, the
sister in the act, said about the duo's recent achievements.
   Amy Grant, a traditional big winner in gospel music, received
one award when her ``'Tis So Sweet to Trust in Jesus'' won for best
country-gospel song.
   The winners were chosen by the 3,000 members of the
Nashville-based gospel association, mostly singers, songwriters and
musicians.
   Actor Clifton Davis and Miss Patti were the show's hosts.
   The honors are called the Dove Awards to signify the bird
mentioned in the Bible.

<HEAD>Americans' Impact on World Environment Enormous, Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TARA BRADLEY-STECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990s may be a do-or-die decade for
important aspects of the world's environment, an expert on
overpopulation says.
   ``If we don't see some real action in this decade, it will
probably be too late to avert some very serious problems,'' Anne
Ehrlich, who with her husband wrote the current book ``The
Population Explosion,'' told a conference Thursday on solving
global environmental problems.
   Those problems include inadequate food production, global
warming, species extinction and deforestation, said Mrs. Ehrlich,
associate director for the Center for Conservation Biology at
Stanford University.
   ``At the moment the rich countries are doing most of the
environmental destruction of the planet, but the poor countries are
getting to be bigger and bigger players,'' said her husband, Paul
Ehrlich, Stanford University professor of population studies.
   Carbon dioxide, believed to contribute to global warming, was
one measure of environmental deterioration that the Ehrlichs and
other scientists discussed at the conference attended by about
1,200 students, teachers, garden-club members and corporate
executives.
   The United States, with about 5 percent of the world's
population, produces 25 percent of the world's output of carbon
dioxide, said Peter Raven, professor of botany at Washington
University in St. Louis.
   ``Chicago puts out as much carbon dioxide as China,'' he said.
``It's a peculiar world. The people at the top are consuming far,
far more than a vast number of people at the bottom. It's much too
unequal, and it's unequal in a way that affects the sustainable
productivity of the world.''
   Erlich said the current world population of 5.3 billion is 1.8
billion more than in 1968 when he first prophesied the problems of
overpopulation in his book ``The Population Bomb.''
   At a worldwide growth rate of 95 million people per year, ``we
are driving the Earth into impoverishment,'' said George Woodwell,
president of the Woods Hole Research Center in Woods Hole, Mass.
   ``We are living on its capital,'' he said. ``We're eating up the
standing stocks of trees and nutrients and soil in the process of
feeding the current 5.3 billion people on Earth. In doing that, we
make the Earth less capable of supporting people in the future.''
   The most serious population problem in the world is in the
United States, Erlich said. One American causes 20 times more
destruction than one person in the Third World, and one rich
American causes 1,000 times more destruction, he said.
   ``It's not how many people you have but how those people
behave,'' he said. ``The most common misperception of the
population problem is that it's a problem of poor Indians who don't
know how to use condoms. Actually, the problem in the world is that
there are too many rich people.''
   The Ehrlichs based their figures on 1987 statistics compiled by
the United Nations on per capita commercial energy consumption, an
index used by environmentalists to measure damage to the Earth.
   Citizens of highly developed nations can help stop the spiral by
practicing conservation and, when necessary, accepting a lower
standard of living, Ehrlich said.
   But that does not mean the citizens of wealthy nations have to
resort to living like peasants, he said.
   In highly affluent Sweden, for instance, the average person uses
about 60 percent of the energy as consumed by the average American
and enjoys a comparable standard of living, he said.
   ``The idea of perpetual economic growth is insane, and yet it's
an insanity that grips our entire culture,'' Ehrlich said. ``When
you hear people say we have to favor economics over the
environment, that's like saying we've got to favor eating over
breathing.
   ``There is no way you can keep the size of the economy growing
without destroying the environment and killing off your society.''
   But, Ehrlich said: ``The bright side is we know societies can
change very rapidly when the time is right.''
   Frederic Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense
Fund, said he sees signs Americans are beginning to rally behind
the ``green movement'' and demand biodegradable products, energy
efficient appliances and sound environmental policies.

<HEAD>Study: Two-Thirds of Felony Suspects Released Pending Court Action</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two out of three defendants charged with
felonies in 39 of the nation's largest counties were released from
police custody pending court action, says a Justice Department
study.
   The sampling released Thursday of 11,063 felony cases filed in
February 1988 showed that 66 percent of the defendants were freed
on bail, bond or their own recognizance while awaiting trial or the
dispositions of their cases.
   Thirty-one percent were held in jail pending trial because they
were unable to post bail and 4 percent were ordered held without
bail following their arraignments, the study said.
   The statistics, gathered from local courts by the Justice
Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics, were intended to be a
sampling of the disposition of felony charges in 75 of the nation's
largest counties.
   The study tracked the felony cases from initial filing to
disposition in courts in 39 local jurisdictions, including the
District of Columbia.
   The suspects' crimes included murder, rape, and drug sales and
possession.
   Bail is requested by prosecutors to guarantee that a defendant
will appear in court for subsequent proceedings and does not
necessarily reflect the seriousness of the charges against the
defendant.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author E.L. Doctorow has won the PEN-Faulkner
Award for best American fiction published in 1989 for his eighth
novel, ``Billy Bathgate,'' the Folger Shakespeare Library announced.
   Doctorow, 59, a professor at New York University, will receive a
$7,500 cash prize at an awards ceremony May 12 at the library,
which administers the awards. Four finalists will receive $2,500
each.
   Doctorow's award-winning novel is about a young man from the
Bronx who becomes the protege of the infamous 1930s gangster, Dutch
Schultz. Doctorow previously had won the National Book Critics
Circle Award for ``Billy Bathgate'' and ``Ragtime'' and the
National Book Award for ``World's Fair.''
   The PEN-Faulkner Award was founded by American writers 10 years
ago to pay tribute to novelist William Faulkner, who used his Nobel
Prize money to encourage other writers. The award is associated
with the American branch of PEN, the international writers'
organization whose name is an acronym for poets, playwrights,
editors, essayists and novelists.
   The four other nominees who also will be honored at the May 12
ceremony are Russell Banks, Molly Gloss, Josephine Jacobsen and
Lynne Sharon Schwartz.

<HEAD>President to Visit South America</HEAD>

   President Bush will visit five South American
countries later this year, the White House says.
   The final itinerary and dates have not been set, but Bush
``hopes to visit Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Venezuela''
sometime ``after the summer,'' presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater announced Thursday.
   Bush said recently that he hoped to visit South America. There
have been widespread reports the trip would take place in
mid-September.
   Asked if Bush would stop in Nicaragua, Fitzwater said,
``Anything could happen. We could add a lot of countries before
this is over.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle recently returned from a trip to five
South American countries and the Caribbean island of Barbados. It
was Quayle's sixth trip to Latin America.
   Bush visited Costa Rica for a Latin summit last October and
Colombia for a drug summit in February.
   Brazil and Chile inaugurated new presidents last month.

<HEAD>Study: One in Three American Adults Has Had Psychiatric Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new survey says one-third of American adults
say they or someone in their family have sought help from a
psychiatrist or a psychologist.
   But the survey released Thursday also found widespread
opposition to putting any kind of mental health facility or housing
for people with mental illness in their neighborhoods.
   Miles Shore, director of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's
program on chronic mental illness, said he was encouraged that
nearly 90 percent describe mental illness as a serious health
problem, and many believe it can be treated.
   But he said the survey points out a contradiction in what he
called the ``not-in-my-back-yard,'' or NIMBY, phenomenon.
   ``On the one hand, people do object to siting these facilities
in their `back yard.' On the other hand, over half recognize that
mental illness can improve and that keeping up a normal life _
which includes community living _ will help with that
improvement,'' he said.
   The survey found that 74 percent of those polled believe
correctly that anyone can become mentally ill and that mental
illness can be cured, and 53 percent believe that keeping up a
normal life in the community will help a person with mental illness
get better.
   But two in three believe there is a lot of stigma attached to
mental illness, according to the survey commissioned by the
foundation.

<HEAD>Concern Over Possible Assassination Attempt Increasing In U.S.

<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are varying routes to
work and guards have been reinforced around some American homes
because of intelligence reports that Communist rebels plan to kill
another American, U.S. sources say.
   The U.S. Embassy refuses to comment on details of increased
security for the more than 40,000 American troops, diplomats, aid
workers and dependents stationed in this former American colony.
   Privately, however, American officials admit they are concerned
that the New People's Army _ the armed wing of the outlawed
Communist Party of the Philippines _ will strike again, perhaps
before talks on the future of U.S. military bases begin next month.
   The rebels oppose the bases and have frequently threatened to
attack Americans allegedly involved in counterinsurgency, despite
U.S. denials of any such role.
   ``We're looking over our shoulder,'' said one diplomat, who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``There are intelligence reports
that they may try something.''
   During the past year, rebels have killed five Americans,
including Army Col. James N. Rowe, a Vietnam War hero slain last
April 21 on his way to the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group in
suburban Quezon City.
   Last September, two American civilians working at an air base in
Tarlac province were gunned down on the day Vice President Dan
Quayle arrived in Manila.
   Two American civilians not employed by the government were
killed earlier this year in separate incidents on the islands of
Bohol and Masbate. Police believe one of the Americans was killed
by mistake and the other refused to pay protection money to the
rebels.
   Last month, Brig. Gen. Gerardo Flores, intelligence chief of the
Philippine Constabulary, predicted the rebels would try to kill an
American ``to dramatize opposition to the bases.''
   The lease on the bases expires next year, and U.S. and Filipino
officials are expected to begin talks on a new agreement next month.
   Opposition to the bases is growing within the urban classes,
which see them as an infringement on sovereignty. U.S. and Filipino
officials fear the rebels will seek to exploit that opposition by
staging an attack on an ``imperialist.''
   To cope with the threat, some U.S. diplomats and military
officers are varying their routes to work and are staggering office
hours to avoid travel during rush hour, the favorite time for urban
attacks.
   Extra security guards have been stationed at the homes of some
American officials, according to sources within the diplomatic
community. Children of some military officers have been told not to
report their addresses to private schools they attend.
   At the Subic Bay naval base, 50 miles west of Manila, the U.S.
Navy has banned most non-essential travel to the capital by the
6,000 sailors.
   Airmen stationed at Clark Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila,
have been ordered not to travel to and from Manila at night and
have been discouraged from visits to much of the country.
   The Far East Network, which broadcasts television programs to
the U.S. military community, airs frequent announcements urging
viewers to think security. They include warnings against wearing
uniforms off post or answering the telephone with a military rank.
   ``Everyone is a little jittery,'' said one source in the
diplomatic community, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``They're all waiting for something to happen, they just don't know
when or where.''
   Communist rebels claim they will not target the estimated 80,000
to 100,000 American civilians residing in the country.
   ``Our main target are the U.S. occupation troops and all U.S.
personnel who are involved in `counterinsurgency,''' said rebel
commander Romulo Kintanar in a recent statement to news
organizations. ``We differentiate between the American people who
are not our enemies and their imperialist government which is
colonialist and oppressive.''

<TEXT>
   Donald Trump rubbed a genie's lamp
and lasers lashed the sky to herald the opening of the Taj Majal,
his glitzy new casino.
   But the billionaire real estate developer will need more than
electronic miracles for the city's newest and grandest gambling
emporium to break even in an industry whose growth has slowed
lately, analysts said.
   At the grand opening for the billion-dollar, 1,250-room,
51-story casino-hotel, Trump came on stage Thursday night and
touched an Aladdin's Lamp, setting off a green laser that shot up
to a red ribbon along the hotel's outside, cutting the bow in two.
   A Max Headroom-type genie appeared on a giant screen flanking
the stage and said Trump was ``master'' for making this casino of
``princes and princesses'' and ``genies and magic.''
   Then the fireworks began, watched by thousands of Boardwalk
spectators and celebrities including former heavyweight champion
Michael Spinks.
   Trump was introduced by entertainer Merv Griffin, who in
November 1988 swapped the Taj Mahal with Trump for the adjoining
Resorts Casino Hotel.
   Resorts has since filed for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   Griffin teased Trump about the gossip swirling around who he
would bring to the ceremony _ his estranged wife, Ivana, or his
alleged paramour, Marla Maples. Trump brought neither.
   ``He brought his father, he brought his mother ... But most of
all he brought me along and I'm very appreciative,'' said Griffin,
whose bankruptcy plan includes a $5 million legal kitty for unhappy
Resorts bondholders who might want to sue Trump.
   Optimists believe Trump's glamorous, gilded casino will attract
more gamblers to Atlantic City. But some analysts were saying the
industry could not support the addition of a casino that requires
an unprecedented $1 million a day to break even.
   Gov. Jim Florio, led by Trump on a tour, said he hoped the Taj
wouldn't drive out Atlantic City's smaller casinos. ``Hopefully,
(the industry) will continue to expand,'' he said.
   The games began Monday at the Taj Majal, and packs of bused-in
gamblers looked up from the craps and slots _ 3,000 machines are
packed in a single room _ to see Trump pacing the premises with his
security guards running interference.
   Women in plumed helmets and short skirts carried drinks and
$2.75-a-pack cigarettes around to the gaming tables. Telephone
operators received incoming calls saying, `Thank you for calling
the Trump Taj Majal, where wonders never cease.''
   The New York Times architecture critic described the resort as a
``themed'' casino, ``one part Las Vegas and one part Disneyland.''
   The Taj Mahal will employ 7,200 people, bringing the city's
casino workforce to 50,000. But city officials have complained
recently that the self-contained casinos have done little for the
depressed city's economy.
   The marble Jacuzzi in the $10,000-a-night Alexander the Great
Suite at the Taj has a vaulted ceiling with three crystal
chandeliers _ and a panoramic view of the burned-out shells of
abandoned buildings that encroach on the casino district.

   The City Council unanimously passed a
measure to crack down on drivers who park illegally in spaces
reserved for the disabled.
   The bill, approved Thursday, would raise the fine for the
violation from $15 to a steep $100. Mayor W. Wilson Goode is
expected to sign it.
   Councilman W. Thacher Longstreth, who introduced the bill, said
he believes increased fines are the best way to ensure the spaces
are kept available for those who need them.
   The Pennsylvania Legislature also took a step this week toward
increasing penalties for the unauthorized use of the reserved
parking spaces.
   The House on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a bill that would
add $50 to municipal fines for parking illegally in spots for the
disabled. The bill now moves to the Senate.

   A healthy baby girl was born to a couple who
conceived the child to serve as a bone marrow donor for their
cancer-stricken daughter.
   Abe and Mary Ayala revealed eight weeks ago that they had
conceived the baby, named Marissa Eve, as a last resort to save the
life of their 18-year-old daughter, Anissa, who is dying of
leukemia.
   The baby weighed 6 pounds, 4 ounces at birth Tuesday night at
Queen of the Valley Hospital in suburban West Covina, the couple's
niece, Lydia Sanchez, said Thursday.
   ``She's beautiful, she looks just like Anissa,'' Sanchez said.
   The Ayalas chose Eve as a middle name ``because Eve means
life,'' she said.
   Fetal tests have shown the baby's marrow is compatible with
Anissa's and doctors said the transplant could occur in six months.
The chance the transplant will cure Anissa has been reported as
between 70 and 80 percent.
   Anissa's leukemia has remained stable, said Dr. Patricia Konrad,
who will perform the surgery. The wait is planned primarily so the
baby will grow and enough marrow can be taken from Marissa Eve to
give her older sister a fighting chance.
   The case drew considerable attention as medical ethicists voiced
qualms about creating one child to save another. They said the baby
was not concieved as an end in itself, but for a utilitarian
purpose.
   The middle-aged couple said they were hurt by such talk, and
that they would love the baby even if it proved to be an
incompatible bone marrow donor for their stricken daughter.
   Almost 24 ounces of marrow would be taken from an adult donor,
if one was available. Konrad said she would be lucky to get half
that amount even after freezing the umbilical cord to use its cells
to supplement the marrow transplant.
   The baby faces little risk, Konrad said. The procedure requires
the infant to be put under general anesthesia to block pain while a
needle is inserted, usually twice, into the hip bone to remove the
marrow.
   Leukemia, a cancer of white blood cells, typically is treated by
killing blood-producing cells with chemotherapy or radiation.
Marrow from a matching donor, usually a sibling, is then
transplanted into the leukemia patient so the healthy stem cells
can produce healthy blood cells.
   After waiting almost two years, the couple said the National
Marrow Donor Program had failed to find a suitable living donor for
Anissa, with the odds reported to be about 1 in 20,000.
   Abe Ayala told The Associated Press in February, ``We just can't
stand idly by and do nothing about it and wait for Anissa to die.''
   The odds were even longer when the Ayalas, who are in their
mid-40s, decided to gamble in the fall 1988 by trying to have
another child.
   Ayala had to undergo an operation to reverse a vasectomy he had
16 years earlier, with about a 50 percent chance of success; women
of Mrs. Ayala's age have a 73 percent chance of conception and
there was only a 25 percent chance the baby would prove to be a
compatible donor.
   Abe told reporters in February, ``This is our miracle baby.''
   The Ayalas live in the Los Angeles suburb of Walnut with Anissa
and a 19-year-old son, Airon.

<HEAD>Law Students Strike To Protest Lack of Minorities, Women On
Faculty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Students at some 40 law schools nationwide held protest rallies
to demand more aggressive recruitment of blacks, Hispanics and
women for their faculties.
   The protesters included students from Harvard, New York
University, Columbia, and University of California campuses at Los
Angeles and Berkeley, as well as schools in Texas, Oregon and
Washington state.
   ``Because our society is not made up of 87 percent white males,
we don't feel we're getting a full education, when that is the only
perspective we're getting,'' said Marie Arnold, a second-year law
student from Union, N.J., who helped organize Thursday's strike at
Harvard.
   Five percent of Harvard's 61-member tenured faculty are black
men, while women comprise 8.3 percent, according to school figures.
Of the school's assistant professors, 40 percent are minorities and
none are women.
   At the University of California-Berkeley Law School, strike
organizer Susan Szabo said about 135 students boycotting classes
with her were putting a lot on the line.
   ``The students are taking a risk because the professors make
recommendations for jobs and the dean picks who should be clerks
for Supreme Court justices,'' Szabo said. ``But the struggle was
waged 15 years ago by other students, and the only reason we're
here is because they took risks for us. You have to take risks to
succeed.''
   The strikers demanded the hiring of five professors who would
add to the diversity of the 96 percent white, 90 percent male
faculty of 55 tenured professors.
   In New York City, about 130 Columbia University Law School
students, chanting ``no diversity, no peace,'' walked out of
classes and staged a sit-in.
   There are two blacks and four women on the school's 50-member
faculty.
   About 200 people gathered to hear professors and students speak
at a rally at the University of Texas School of Law in Austin.
   At Harvard, about 275 students gathered in front of Harkness
Commons, and some later picketed in front of the building which
houses the Harvard Law Review. A group also stormed the office of
Dean Robert C. Clark, who was out.
   ``The administration of the Harvard Law School shares the
concerns for diversity among students and faculty,'' the law school
said in a statement. ``We are proud of the diversity we have
already achieved. We expect to make further progress.''
   Harvard issued figures Thursday that suggested there were few
women and minorities in the national pool of lawyers to whom the
school could offer faculty positions.
   Of lawyers licensed to practice as of 1980, 8.1 percent were
women, while about 4 percent of all employed lawyers were
minorities, the school said. Among the pool of potential assistant
professors, people who graduated from law school four to six years
ago, 38 percent were women, and 8.8 percent were minorities.

<HEAD>Colombia Police Defuse Truck Bomb</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police defused a truck bomb containing
more than a half-ton of dynamite they said drug traffickers had
planted in hopes of destroying several blocks of a wealthy Bogota
neighborhood.
   Military armor and patrols filled the streets Thursday morning
minutes after the bomb was found.
   Interior Minister Horacio Serpa, who police said walked by the
truck minutes before the bomb was found Thursday, called an
emergency meeting of the National Security Council. He is acting
president while President Virgilio Barco is in Europe on a state
visit.
   Federal Sen. Federico Estrada, 63, who was kidnapped by drug
traffickers Tuesday in Medellin, was released unharmed Thursday in
that northwestern Colombian city, home of Medellin's cocaine cartel.
   The traffickers had threatened to murder him if police did not
release four of their associates. Police have denied detaining the
four, and the reason for Estrada's being freed was not clear.
   Police said gunmen working for drug traffickers killed another
policeman Thursday in Medellin, bringing to 15 the number of
officers killed there since Monday.
   The city's police chief, Col. Carlos Alberto Otalora, says
cocaine lords are paying $4,300 for each slaying of an officer.
   There has been a surge of violence since last week, when the
government extradited another drug suspect to the United States.
Drug lords said at the time they would kill police officers and
explode a bomb in a wealthy section of Bogota in retaliation.
   Most of the violence has been in Medellin, and police on
Thursday sent 600 reinforcements to the city to try to stop the
bloodshed.
   Police officers patrolling a main avenue in northern Bogota
Thursday morning saw two men hastily abandon a truck with its motor
running.
   In the back of the truck police found about 1,100 pounds of
dynamite buried under a load of toilet paper and hand soap, a
police lieutenant on the scene said.
   The lieutenant, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Serpa's apartment is 1{ blocks from the site and that the interior
minister passed by the truck minutes before police discovered the
bomb.
   ``If the bomb had gone off, it would have wiped out two square
blocks,'' he said.
   Two private schools with a total of 2,000 pupils are within two
blocks of the site.
   Other major figures live in the neighborhood of luxury
high-rises, embassies and consulates, including former President
Alfonso Lopez Michelsen, presidential candidate Cesar Gaviria and
the chief of Colombia's secret police, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez.
   In one of several attempts to kill Maza, traffickers last
December exploded a 1,100-pound truck bomb at the secret police's
Bogota headquarters. The blast killed 63 people.
   The attack was part of the terrorist campaign meant to force the
government to abandon its policy of extraditing drug traffickers.
   Barco revived the policy in August as part of a U.S.-backed
crackdown after drug traffickers killed a leading presidential
candidate.
   Bombings and other terrorist actions ended in January when the
drug lords declared a truce, but they announced last week they were
resuming their campaign when the government extradited another drug
suspect.

<HEAD>Global Influences At Week's Designer Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buyers, reporters and others who swoon for
fashion found a variety of global influences at work during a
whirlwind jaunt through this week's designer shows in New York.
   American folk art inspired Bob Mackie's collection. Isaac
Mizrahi displayed an interest in China and tossed in some American
Indian elements. And Mary McFadden paid tribute to her recent
voyage to Venice.
   Martin Price, designer for the Giorgio di Sant'Angelo
collection, stayed closer to home, sticking to the late designer's
red hot sexy look.
   Louis dell'Olio, for Anne Klein, crossed time zones, blurring
distinctions between day and evening wear.
   Spurred on by ``the real men and women that forged the
wilderness,'' Mackie delivered up a collection that reeked of
Daniel Boone, with fringe leather vests, Indian blanket coats, and
short evening jackets embroidered with the Liberty Bell.
   Mackie's Americana influences included quilted skirts and
Pennsylvania Dutch quilt designs, but the elaborate gold beaded
headdresses with head-to-toe feathers, which Cher could wear with
equanimity, were Hollywood all the way.
   Announcing that he was ``encouraging men to take more liberties
with their style of dressing,'' Mizrahi Thursday night displayed a
gray cotton raincoat with a yellow alpaca lining.
   For those seeking to experiment gradually with fashion, there
was a richly colored bottle green silk padded blazer, an ash blue
silk trench coat and a suit with varying shades of orange.
   Mizrahi introduced twists on fashion such as a charcoal
double-breasted suit in wool jersey, a dressy white ruffled shirt
combined with a casual leather jacket and a gold brocade dinner
jacket with a bronze satin cardigan shirt.
   For women, Mizrahi was typically playful, with teeny skirts with
one button at the waist (``I call them placemats because that's
what they look like on the table'') and Indian-inspired fringe
ponchos with shawl dresses. Also, there were plenty of kimonos and
dressy ankle-length full skirts with Oriental embroidery.
   Continuing with his trademark color combinations, Mizrahi showed
a creamsicle alpaca and beaver pea coat with a pink cardigan
sweater.
   Meanwhile, dell'Olio introduced interchangeable, eminently
wearable pieces that work for day or night, a collection both basic
and elegant. His outfits were easy and monochromatic, in navy,
coffee, and magenta, in wool crepe, cashmere, and suede.
   For evening, dell'Olio showed luxurious tapestry, panne velvet
and damask in simple silhouettes.
   McFadden zeroed in on 16th century Venice, with lots of gold and
pewter metallic lace, metallic handpainted panne velvet and
embroidered velvet. Appliqued riding jackets, full-sleeved poet's
blouses and ankle-length slender evening gowns with double tiered
quilted jackets completed the look.
   The di Sant'Angelo collection, named ``Seduction,'' featured
bright colors on a parade of steadily smashing models swathed in
body-hugging gauze, chiffon, and mousseline. Bodysuits, bikinis,
unitards, and saris were among the sizzling looks.

   Trinity Episcopal Church is hawking
``Sign of the Dove'' fertilizer _ the legacy of pigeons that have
lived in the church bell tower for 80 years _ to help pay for
fixing its organ.
   About the time they got hit with a $110,000 repair bill last
fall, church officials discovered 1,200 pounds of bird droppings
when they went to clean the 90-foot bell tower.
   The Rev. William J. Eakins, the church rector, saw the droppings
as a sort of manna from heaven.
   When state agricultural tests confirmed the droppings were rich
in organic matter and nitrogen, Eakins suggested selling them in
3-pound bags for $3 each to help raise the $35,000 in repair costs
not covered by contributions.
   The assistant rector, the Rev. Hope H. Adams, is handling
marketing. She named the product ``Sign of the Dove'' and gave it a
plug in Sunday's church bulletin.
   ``Our house brand fertilizer has been produced over the years by
the pigeons who have called the tower home,'' she wrote.
   Adams says about 82 bags have been sold since the fertilizer was
offered for sale a few weeks ago.
   ``Just as Jesus used the things of nature in his own ministry,
we hope to use this to meet our need,'' she said.
   ``The Lord works in mysterious ways.''

   State lawmakers got their first glimpse of
an $8 million renovation that restored the century-old House
chamber to its original appearance _ for better or worse.
   Wall colorings included teal and gold, and a shade somewhere
between mauve and rose.
   ``It's salmon in case you're wondering,'' House Speaker Lewis
Dodak said as he greeted a senator sneaking a peek. ``That's the
color that was here 100 years ago.''
   Since last fall, lawmakers have convened in a renovated
printshop in a building just north of the Capitol. They'll move
back into the House chamber when they return from spring break on
April 24. Representatives visited it briefly Thursday to select
seats.
   ``It's nice to be home,'' said Rep. Curtis Hertel.
   ``It's a beautiful showcase. It is just terrific work,'' said
Rep. Kirk Profit.
   Others were less impressed by the ostentatious decor.
   Putting her hands over her face, Rep. Margaret O'Connor grieved,
``I think it's so busy, do you feel the same way?''
   ``It sort of gives you a circus feeling,'' said Rep. Richard
Young.
   The Senate chamber was renovated earlier, and one representative
felt something was missing in the House.
   ``It's nice, but are we going to get computers like the
Senate?'' asked Rep. David Honigman.

<HEAD>Lithuanians Draft Mild Reply to Gorbachev Over Troops</HEAD>

   Lithuanian lawmakers took a conciliatory tone with
Moscow in seeking talks on independence, but the Kremlin continued
its hard-line position as Soviet troops took over another
government building in the Baltic republic.
   Soldiers dressed as police invaded the Lithuanian prosecutor's
offices Thursday, forced employees outside and took over the
building, witnesses and spokesmen for the republic's Parliament
said.
   On Wednesday Lithuania's secessionist government accused Moscow
of backing forces seeking its overthrow, but a day later the
legislators were conciliatory.
   In a message to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the lawmakers
wrote they ``value highly your efforts aimed at the peaceful
solution of problems,'' but think talks ``should not be accompanied
by the willful actions of your armed forces.''
   Lithuania, forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union with the
Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia in 1940, declared independence
on March 11 and has been in a confrontation with the Kremlin ever
since.
   Estonia is cautiously following Lithuania's lead. On March 30,
its new Parliament declared Estonia under Soviet occupation and set
an indefinite transition period for independence. On Thursday,
Estonian leaders decided to stand firm on their demands for
independence despite Gorbachev's wrath, informed sources said.
   Latvia also appeared headed toward independence. Its Communist
Party congress was due to open today.
   In Lithuania, there was apparent movement toward common ground
with Moscow, including a possible referendum on independence. That
could bring Lithuania closer to compliance with a new Soviet law on
secession.
   Edward Tuskenis of the Lithuanian Parliament's information
office called the lawmakers' message a ``diplomatic and
conciliatory'' response to Gorbachev's demand that Lithuania
renounce its independence declaration.
   The message addressed Gorbachev as ``deeply esteemed
president,'' and said the Parliament ``reiterates its readiness to
begin a dialogue and to discuss measures to establish new relations
between our states.''
   Late Thursday, however, about 50 armed men entered the
prosecutor's office, site of a previous Soviet attempt to seize
power from officials appointed by the new Lithuanian government.
   Henrika Pocei, secretary to Lithuania's chief prosecutor, said
from Vilnius the men ``fully occupied the building, and there are
six or eight paratroopers on each floor dressed as policemen.''
   The chief prosecutor is the republic's highest law enforcement
authority.
   At the same offices last week, Moscow officials tried to remove
Lithuanian-appointed Chief Prosecutor Arturas Paulauskas and
install their own man.
   Employees refused to obey the Moscow loyalist, and soldiers were
posted in the building on March 30 in the first occupation by
Soviet troops of a Lithuanian government building. Soldiers earlier
took control of at least five Communist Party buildings.
   The occupations were attempts by the Soviet government to assert
control over the republic.
   Tuskenis said the lawmakers' message to Gorbachev is ``saying
that we can appreciate Moscow's point of view'' and pushes for
negotiations.
   But Tuskenis said parliamentary leaders still ruled out
Gorbachev's demand Saturday that Lithuania renounce independence so
talks could begin.
   In London, Lithuania's de facto spokesman, Algis Cekuolis,
expressed a willingness to agree to other concessions, including a
continued Soviet military presence, retention of current economic
ties with Moscow and a referendum on independence.
   The announcement was the first such public offer from the
Lithuanians.
   Tuskenis said such a position had not been not fully approved by
the Lithuanian government. But he said Lithuanian President
Vytautas Landsbergis has said he may agree to a referendum.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III held a second day of
talks Thursday with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in
Washington.
   Soviet TV, reporting late Thursday on Shevardnadze's trip,
showed pro-Lithuanian demonstrators in Moscow. The report said the
protesters ``tried to complicate the visit'' but that superpower
goodwill outweighed tension over Lithuania.
   President Bush and Gorbachev will meet for a summit in the
United States beginning May 30, U.S. and Soviet officials said
Thursday.

<HEAD>Jury Rejects Deli Owner's Claims Against Actor Paul Newman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A deli owner who lost a lawsuit against
Paul Newman and his food companies says the court battle was a
mismatch because of the actor's status as a movie screen idol and
philanthropist.
   But members of the jury said they spent their time gazing on the
evidence, not at the star, and Newman called Westport deli owner
Julius Gold's remarks ``sour grapes.''
   Juror Gail McCulley said all but one of the six jurors began
deliberations convinced that Gold's claims were without merit.
McCulley and juror Beverly Willis agreed that Newman's celebrity
status didn't influence them.
   ``It made no difference who he was. We treated him just like we
would you,'' Willis said. ``He was just another guy there, just
another person.''
   The Superior Court jury deliberated five hours over two days
before deciding Thursday afternoon that Newman never promised Gold
8 percent stock in his businesses, Newman's Own Inc. and Salad King
Inc.
   The Academy Award-winning actor was cheered as left the
courthouse and quickly surrounded by a crowd of about 200 reporters
and spectators.
   ``All right, Cool Hand Luke,'' yelled one well-wisher.
``Congratulations Paul,'' shouted another, as a couple of motorists
tooted their horns.
   Gold, the owner of a Westport deli, claimed he was owed the
stock for helping Newman start the businesses in 1982 and 1983.
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Gold said. ``I brought the case because I
thought I was wronged. I realized I was dealing with an uphill
battle, going against a celebrity of world status.''
   Newman said he felt sorry for Gold, but he said the suggestion
he was helped by his fame was ``sour grapes and a lot of whining.''
   ``It's just tragic all of this energy and time could not have
been spent in more charitable pursuits, but that's the nature of
the beast,'' Newman said.
   A.E. Hotchner, who is chief operating officer of Newman's
companies, was also a defendant. The jury found in his favor,
concluding that Gold had not reached an ``implied contract'' with
either him or the Newman companies.
   Newman and Hotchner started Newman's Own on a whim, beginning
with salad dressing that Newman originally made in the basement of
his Westport home. The product line was later expanded to include
spaghetti sauce, popcorn and lemonade.
   All profits _ $28 million to date _ have gone go to charity. The
Westport-based companies had a record $42 million in sales last
year, up from $36 million in 1988.
   Gold testified that he, too, would give any proceeds to charity
if he won the case.

   The museum under attack for an exhibition of
sexually graphic photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe is
finding an upsurge in community support a little overwhelming.
   More than 3,000 people were expected to attend the show's
opening tonight, said Dennis Barrie, director of the Contemporary
Arts Center _ three times more than the largest crowd ever to fill
the small downtown museum.
   ``We're going to have to regulate the flow into the gallery,''
Barrie said.
   Before the big party, Barrie may learn whether a local court
believes that the exhibit violates local community standards.
   Hamilton County Municipal Judge Edward L. Donnellon was set
today to hear the museum's request for a jury verdict on whether
the exhibit is obscene. The museum sought the verdict after local
law enforcement agents threatened to shut the exhibit.
   About 400 people have paid $25 to $150 each to become museum
members in the last 10 days, a period when the museum usually might
sign 10 members, Barrie said.
   Tickets to tonight's opening were available only to the Arts
Center's patrons. The exhibit opens to the public Saturday.
   The 175-photograph exhibit includes nine controversial pictures
that portray nude children or homoerotic and sadomasochistic sex
acts. The museum is putting the photos in a separate room that
minors are prohibited from entering.
   The exhibit of the work by Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS March
1989, prompted Congress to limit funding to the arts after Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., declared the photographs obscene.
   They were exhibited without incident at private museums in
several cities before coming to Cincinnati.
   ``I think, sadly, Cincinnati will get a bit of a black eye from
this,'' Barrie said. ``But the real story is that while there's a
vocal minority, there's a majority that says `We support freedom.'''
   The museum says the exhibit is constitutionally protected
because it is art, despite the sexually graphic pictures.
   In a supporting affidavit, Bruce H. Evans, director of the
Dayton Art Institute, said the exhibit demostrates Mapplethorpe's
skill as a photographer as well as the range of emotional reaction
his works produce.
   ``It can be, for example, the breathtaking sense of simple
beauty of a human figure or floral still life or ... a
gut-wrenching sense of disgust to acts of human sadism,'' Evans
said.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Try To Waive Attorney-Client Privilege in Stuart Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The right of attorney-client privilege is being
tested in the Stuart murder case as prosecutors try to pry
information from the lawyer for the man who apparently killed
himself after he became a suspect.
   Prosecutors trying to unravel Charles Stuart's alleged plot to
kill his pregnant wife asked a judge Thursday to lift the privilege
that has silenced Stuart's former attorney.
   The courts have ruled both ways in previous cases in which
lawyers have been asked to disclose what they were told in
confidence, legal experts said.
   ``There's always going to be a temptation that this is an
important case and you need that information,'' said William J.
Genego, a law professor at Boston University.
   Suffolk Superior Court Judge James Donohue took the case under
advisement after the hearing Thursday, which was closed because of
a grand jury investigation.
   The motion centers on a conversation Stuart had with his
attorney, John Dawley, before he died on Jan. 4.
   Dawley has refused to reveal the details, but it is believed
Stuart disclosed his role in the Oct. 23 shooting death of his
pregnant wife, Carol.
   Paul Leary, an assistant district attorney, said his office was
asking the court to allow prosecutors to get information from
Dawley.
   ``We will pursue every avenue to get to the truth,'' Leary said.
``This may be one of them.''
   Another key witness in the case is Stuart's younger brother,
Matthew, who provided the dramatic revelations that led to Charles
Stuart's suicide.
   Prior to January, authorities believed Stuart's tale that he and
his wife were attacked by a mugger. But Matthew told police that
his brother instructed him to be at the murder scene, where Charles
gave him some of his wife's belongings and a revolver.
   Matthew Stuart was called before the grand jury last week, but
he reportedly refused to testify to avoid self-incrimination. His
attorney, Nancy Gertner, attended Thursday's court hearing,
representing the Stuart estate.
   ``We believe the attorney-client privilege extends past death,
period,'' Gertner said.
   Deborah Ramirez, a visiting law professor at Northeastern
University, said judges can order an attorney to disclose
privileged information from a dead client. But some courts have
ruled in the other direction, she said.
   ``If I were a judge, I would find a way to order that the
privilege not apply,'' she said. ``But I think I'm in the
minority.''
   Legal experts disagree over whether the power to waive the
privilege can transfer to the client's heirs. In this case,
Stuart's mother is the administrator of his estate. Her attorney,
Richard Clayman, said, ``even if she can waive it, she won't waive
it.''

   Savage new fighting between
black factions broke out today in Natal, leaving at least 10 people
dead despite an accord by President F.W. de Klerk and Nelson
Mandela to resume peace talks.
   The new violence shattered a two-day lull and came after de
Klerk and Mandela agreed in Cape Town Thursday to talks on ending
white-minority rule and sharing power with South Africa's 28
million disenfranchised blacks.
   Both leaders said a date for new talks would be announced
shortly.
   They hailed the agreement as a breakthrough and called for an
end to the black factional fighting that has left hundreds dead in
recent weeks. The political violence is believed to be the worst
since the mid-1980s.
   De Klerk said late Thursday the two leaders discussed the
fighting ``frankly and clearly ... I had the impression that there
is a general agreement that violence had to come to an end and that
there was a need for creating an atmosphere in which normal
political processes could take place.''
   But rival Zulu war bands armed with guns, knives and sticks
clashed around Pietermaritzburg in southeastern Natal today, police
said. War bands set fire to homes and fought in the hillsides
around black townships. They also clashed with police.
   At least one black man was killed when police opened fire on a
large crowd near Ladysmith, according to the state South African
Broadcasting Corp. Among other attacks, police patrols were shot at
when they tried to separate the fighting groups, and one officer
was killed and three injured in various incidents, authorities said.
   The fighting broke out after two days of relative quiet in the
region. At least 67 people have been killed in the area since last
week.
   The new fighting appeared to spread from the Edendale area,
where the clashes had been concentrated, police said. Heavily armed
army troops were helping police restore order.
   More than 12,000 refugees, mostly women and children, have fled
their homes to escape the fighting between rival Zulu factions of
the conservative Inkatha movement and the United Democratic Front,
which is allied with the African National Congress.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, but differ over tactics and plans
for a future South Africa.
   The government has warned that the violence sweeping South
Africa poses a major threat to political stability and to
negotiations on ending white rule. De Klerk's meeting with Mandela
and a decline in violence in recent days stirred hopes the unrest
was subsiding.
   The Citizen newspaper reported today that de Klerk and Mandela
agreed to start formal talks April 25 on removing obstacles to
full-scale negotiations. Government officials could not be reached
for comment.
   The ANC had pulled out of such talks planned for April 11 to
protest police firing on black demonstrators March 25, killing
nine. The ANC is calling for an end to the state of emergency and
other measures before it agrees to full-scale talks.
   De Klerk also said Thursday he objected to the ANC pressuring
tribal homeland leaders not to meet with the government.
   Mandela said ``nothing could be further from the truth'' than
charges of ANC intimidation.
   In addition to Mandela, de Klerk had been scheduled to meet with
six homeland leaders, but four did not show up. De Klerk said some
of the leaders were pressured not to come and ``that choice was not
voluntary in any sense of the word.''
   Mandela and other ANC leaders have called for unity among all
black political factions in order to present a solid front.
   But the ANC does not recognize the homeland governments. It says
the division of black South Africans into 10 tribal areas deprives
blacks of citizenship, land ownership and work rights, leaving most
of the country for whites.
   Meanwhile Thursday, the military of the nominally independent
homeland of Venda overthrew the government and said the area should
be reincorporated into South Africa, radio reports said. There were
no immediate reports of fighting or casualties.
   There are four nominally independent homelands in South Africa,
and there have been military coups in three in the last 2{ years.
The four leaders of the independent homelands were not invited to
the talks.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and other outlawed black opposition
groups in February shortly before Mandela was released from jail.
The president says he wants to share political power with blacks
and end all judicial forms of racial segregation.
   Mandela was released from jail in February after 27 years. He is
the de facto leader of the ANC while the guerrilla movement's
president, Oliver Tambo, recovers from a stroke at a Swedish clinic.

   Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas cleaned up damage from severe
thunderstorms, while springtime snow dusted parts of the upper
Great Lakes region and northern New York state today.
   Several tornadoes were reported late Thursday night in western
and northern Texas. At least two people were reported injured as
stormy weather tore through Abilene, Texas, one by flying glass and
the other by a wind-blown dumpster.
   A clerk at an Abilene convenience store that lost its roof said
a twister caused the damage.
   ``All of a sudden, the doors blew open and it sounded like a
freight train,'' said Elizabeth Proctor. ``I just hunkered down by
the cash register. I didn't seen anything but the roof flying.''
   Hailstones 2 inches thick broke many windows in Fort Worth,
Texas. Golf-ball sized hail also fell near Cumberland, Okla.;
smaller hail was reported in many other places in the state
Thursday.
   High wind gusts from thunderstorms knocked over trees and
damaged buildings in parts of Arkansas and Texas.
   Snow fell this morning in northern Michigan and northern New
York state. Snow also fell Thursday night in parts of Minnesota,
Kansas and Colorado.
   Rain fell across souther Colorado and northern New Mexico, as
well as in scattered places throughout the Midwest and Southeast,
in the Mid-Atlantic states and in eastern Nevada and Northern
California.
   High temperature for the Lower 48 states Thursday was 90 degrees
at Borrego Springs, Calif.

   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded
sharply today as the dollar declined against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed the week
at 29,278.78 points, up 1,029.72 points, or 3.65 percent.
   It was the index's fourth-largest single-day advance. Its
largest gain was on Oct. 21, 1987, after the worldwide Black Monday
stock market crash, when it surged 2,037.32 points.
   Securities dealers said today's gain followed an improvement in
market mood Thursday afternoon when major institutional investors
began actively buying shares to support the falling market. The
move helped the Nikkei index wipe out most of a 1,088.94-point
morning loss to close the day Thursday down only 193.88 points.
   ``The market has entered on a rebounding phase as domestic
demand-related issues and large-capital stocks, including steel
issues, were bought briskly,'' said Masaya Hashizume, an analyst
with Nikko Securities.
   ``The relatively large trading volume of 800 million shares
signals the beginning of a market turnaround,'' he said.
   On Thursday, 650 million shares changed hands on the market's
first section, following weeks of sessions in which typical trading
volume was less than 500 million shares.
   Other dealers said many participants, including institutional
investors, believed the index has reached its bottom.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed the week at 157.47 yen,
down 0.43 yen from Thursday's close. After opening at 156.90 yen,
it ranged between 156.55 yen and 157.65 yen.
   Many market players were reducing long, or overbought, dollar
positions against the yen prior to a weekend meeting of finance
ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations in Paris,
said Takeo Suzuki, a dealer with Yasuda Trust and Banking Co.
   Suzuki said the yen ``now is under less selling pressure against
European currencies, including the West German mark, because their
value (against the yen) have risen enough.''
   Other exchange dealers said they expect some policy initiatives
to defend the yen against the dollar in Saturday's meeting of
monetary authorities from the United States, Japan, West Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   Yasuda's Suzuki said the yen's relative stability also was
partly due to ``progress to some extent'' in Thursday's agreement
in trade talks between the United States and Japan in which both
pledged to make structural reforms in their economies.
   The preliminary agreement in the so-called Structural
Impediments Initiative, reached after several months of discussions
between U.S. and Japanese negotiators, is intended to remove
structural causes of their $49 billion trade imbalance.
   In the bond market, the price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese
government bonds closed at 86.38 points, down from Thursday's
finish of 86.55. Their yield was 7.275 percent, up from the
previous day's 7.240 percent.

   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today the broad
trade reforms approved by the United States and Japan could be
painful but will improve living standards.
   Consumer groups said the changes could hurt community
development and go against with cultural values, however.
   Speaking at a news conference, Kaifu said Japan must carry out
its end of the accord, announced Thursday in Washington, ``as a
responsible member of the international community.''
   The agreement, reached after four days of discussions, sets
forth complex proposals aimed at lowering America's huge $49
billion trade deficit with Japan.
   ``I ask for the understanding and cooperation of the people of
my country,'' Kaifu said.
   In the end, he said, the reforms will improve the lives of the
Japanese.
   The talks were unprecedented because they aimed not at boosting
sales of specific foreign products but at easing barriers to trade
in both countries.
   But the Federation of Specialty Stores Associations said in a
statement it would do its best ``to prevent the decisions from
being enforced by keeping close ties with other groups and
promoting consumer awareness and cooperation.''
   It focused its attack on the most controversial of the proposed
Japanese reforms _ revision of a law that protects small retailers
by restricting the opening of large department stores, a process
that takes about 10 years.
   The United States sought abolition of the law, contending larger
stores are more likely to sell foreign products.
   Kaifu said effects of the revision would be ``severe.'' But, he
added: ``I believe it is important for me and all of you to think
of the viewpoint of consumers' interests.''
   The association's statement said, however, ``the decision will
do nothing but weaken minor retailers, devastate shopping districts
and slow economic and cultural development of the community.''
   The association claims a membership of 50,000 small retailers
nationwide. The trade ministry says Japan has 1.6 million retail
shops with fewer than 50 employees, and 800,000 tiny
``mom-and-pop'' stores.
   The talks on barriers to trade, known as the Structural
Impediments Initiative, began last July. Until this week, they had
made little headway.
   Japan said the United States contributed to the trade imbalance
with its large budget deficit, low savings rate, short-term
corporate planning and weak education system. U.S. negotiators
promised to remedy these problems.
   U.S. officials have argued the changes sought in Japan would
benefit Japanese consumers, who pay some of the world's highest
prices as a result of a complex distribution system and numerous
government restrictions.
   Japanese consumers, however, have not formed strong
organizations to press for change, and many Japanese identify their
own interests with those of their companies.
   Larger is not necessarily better, said Naokazu Takeuchi, head of
the Japan Consumers Union, one of the nation's largest consumer
groups.
   ``It is not cheap pricing that we consumers want,'' he said.
``We have to take many elements _ cultural aspects, community
relationship _ into consideration before making decisions.''
   Kaifu said the promised package of reforms would benefit not
only the United States and Japan, ``but also the whole world, serve
to prevent the rise of protectionism and thus contribute to the
steady development of the world economy.''
   ``The Japanese measures included in the interim report have been
attained after undergoing a difficult domestic process, and their
implementation may, in some cases, be painful,'' Kaifu said. ``It
is my conviction, however, that they are essential in furthering
Japan's own national interest.''
   Among Japan's pledges was one to spend more on public works such
as housing, sewers, parks, airports and port facilities.
   The United States, believing such spending will boost Japan's
demand for foreign goods and services, sought a spending target,
but Japan said it will decide expenditures annually to avoid
overheating the economy.
   On the retail store law, which the United States wanted
abolished, Japan said it will improve how the law works, revise it
next year and then review it again in another two years.
   If by then it still takes 10 years to open large stores,
specific areas of the country would be exempted from the law,
Japanese officials said.
   ``Because the agreement said `specific areas,' the law will not
be abolished,'' an official of the Ministry of International Trade
and Industry said on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   An East German leftist party and a
conservative alliance cleared away some ideological differences in
efforts to build a broad coalition government, the ADN news agency
said today.
   Christian Democratic leader Lothar de Maiziere, whose party
holds the most seats in Parliament, was asked to try to form a
government during Thursday's inaugural session of the new
legislature.
   De Maiziere is trying to resolve differences over reunification
and build a broad coalition from the 11 parties represented. His
success would speed the merger of the German states, the principal
issue in the country's first free elections on March 18.
   The Christian Democrats are part of a conservative alliance that
also includes Democratic Awakening and the German Social Union. The
alliance has tried to ally with the left-leaning Social Democrats,
despite serious ideological differences between that party and the
Social Union.
   Those two parties were able to put aside some differences in a
late-night meeting, according to East Germany's ADN news agency.
   ADN quoted Social Democrat chief Markus Meckel as saying there
are still ``differing views'' between the two parties, but ``no
obstacles that can't be overcome.''
   De Maiziere needs a broad coalition to ensure the two-thirds
vote needed to enact constitutional changes required for
unification.
   Members of the conservative alliance follow the policies
espoused by their like-minded colleagues in Bonn, led by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   Kohl said again today his countrymen will not face a tax
increase to finance the heavy costs of German unification.
   ``A tax increase would unnecessarily brake the economic upswing
and have a counterproductive effect,'' Kohl said in the West German
city of Ludwigshafen.
   Unification was a prominent theme of Thursday's inaugural
session of the 400-member Parliament, and the lawmakers formally
dismantled the Communist system that ruled for four decades.
   Despite differences over how to proceed with unification, East
German political parties together oppose a proposal by the West
German Central Bank to trade East marks for West marks at a 2-1
exchange. Thousands of East Germans rallied nationwide Thursday to
demand a 1-1 rate, which would offset unemployment and inflation in
East Germany once the countries unite.
   However, West Germany said Thursday it was moving ahead with
plans to replace the nearly worthless East German currency with the
mighty Western mark by summer.
   The East German lawmakers chose Christian Democrat Sabine
Bergmann-Pohl to serve as Parliament president. He said he hoped
the legislators do ``justice to our responsibilities and that we
soon sit in a common German Parliament.''
   The Parliament also created the office of president, a
ceremonial head of state, and abolished the Communist collective
body, the Council of State.
   Dr. Bergmann-Pohl will serve as head of state until the
lawmakers elect a president. De Maiziere will likely be chosen
premier.
   Running the country now is the Communist-led caretaker
government headed by Premier Hans Modrow, who took over after
hard-liner Erich Honecker was ousted in October.
   The Alliance for Germany favors rapid reunification while the
left-leaning Social Democrats favor a gradual merger.
   Hundreds of thousands rallied nationwide Thursday to protest the
proposed 2-1 exchange rate and demand West German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl live up to his promises of prosperity for East Germans. Kohl
campaigned hard for de Maiziere.
   About 50,000 people rallied in East Berlin and another 50,000
marched in Leipzig, the state news service ADN said. Rallies also
were reported in the cities of Halle, Neubrandenburg, Magdeburg,
Dresden, Gera, Potsdam and Cottbus, the government news agency ADN
reported.
   Despite the uproar, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
confirmed newspaper reports that under the proposed currency union,
East Germany would relinquish control of monetary policy to the
West German central bank, Bundesbank.
   Waigel said government ministers were studying a 50-page draft
proposal for replacing the East German mark. He said West Germany
would like basic agreement by next month and establishment of the
common currency sometime this summer.
   ADN also said 40,000 East Germans lost their jobs in March. East
Germany's many inefficient and obsolete industries are having
difficulty competing with the flood of Western products now
available to East Germans.

<TEXT>
   A jury convicted and sentenced
to prison 23 islanders for torturing and burning to death six
people in a frenzied witch hunt that terrorized their tiny atoll in
the South Pacific.
   The seven-man, two-woman jury at the Tribunal of Papeete handed
down the penalties late Thursday. They ranged from three to 14
years imprisonment for those who particiapted in the 1987 slayings.
Prosecutor Raymond Morey had recommended penalties ranging from
five to 20 years.
   The defendants, mostly fishermen and farmers from the atoll of
Faaite, showed no reaction when the sentences were read. Another
suspect, a minor, will be judged in a separate proceeding.
   ``I find these penalties very heavy,'' said Roman Catholic
Archbishop Michel Coppenrath, the highest-ranking church official
in French Polynesia. ``The repentance of the accused is sincere.''
   The heaviest sentence, 14 years, went to farmer Francois Mauti,
25, on convictions of murder, complicity in murder and inflicting
mortal blows. He led a band of disciples that organized the
violence in Sept. 2-4, 1987.
   ``I had a spirit under the spell of the devil,'' Mauti told
Judge Marcel Bihl. ``I lost my head, but I believed I was on the
holy path, shunning the evil fighting within me.''
   During the nine-day trial, the court heard defendants speak of
being swept away by demons or religious frenzy as they hunted down
and killed neighbors they thought were possessed.
   The terror had roots in August 1987 visit by three women who
arrived from Tahiti, 300 miles to the west. The women claimed to
represent the Roman Catholic-affiliated movement Christian Renewal,
but church authorities deny they had any official role in the
movement.
   The group already had a strong following on Faaite, a sunny
atoll of white sand that is home to about 180 people. The women,
regarded as ``priestesses'' by the islanders, took over the
community's whitewashed church and replaced the lay preacher as the
religious authority.
   The trio's leader, Alexandra Silvia, conducted services in a
trance and told frightened islanders of her visions that God would
abandon Faaite, the defendants said.
   Miss Silvia suggested demons were in their midst, defendants
said, and the population began viewing with suspicion fellow
islanders who failed to attend her daily services.
   ``My words were misinterpreted,'' testified Silvia, a
55-year-old dental secretary who was not charged. ``I only gave
prayers that cured those who were sick.''
   But the defendants said the mood of the once-placid atoll swung
between ecstasy and dread inspired by Silvia and her assistants.
The trio left Faaite in late August and anointed seven disciples to
continue their work.
   A few days later, a 14-year-old boy reported a vision that the
devil had possessed his aunt. The islanders gathered in nightlong
prayer and finally pronounced the demon exorcised.
   They repeated the ritual with two other people. But Ioane
Harris, the assistant mayor, publicly denounced the women on Sept.
2. Maddened villagers twisted a cord around his neck, beat and
drowned him, and threw his body on a bonfire built before the
church.
   ``It was necessary to purify him,'' one defendant said. ``It was
necessary to purify the village.''
   Five more people were killed over the next two days.
   Most islanders took no part in the carnage, but it was Sept. 4
before anyone established contact with Papeete, the capital of
French Polynesia, and reported trouble on the atoll.
   The mayor, who had been on vacation, and a Roman Catholic priest
arrived the next day with police, in time to prevent four more
executions.
   Psychiatric experts testified the emotional charismatic
Christianity, mixed with ancient Polynesian beliefs in the
supernatural, produced a dangerous mass hysteria on an isolated
island lacking institutional authority. The three women were not
put on trial since they had left Faaite before the murders.

   Celebrity visits have boosted the spirits of
Ryan White's family while the teen-age AIDS victim remains
unconscious and in critical condition with a lung infection.
   ``Jeanne (White's mother) had wondered whether their travels and
all they've done to educate people about AIDS had had any effect,''
said Carrie Van Dyke, family spokeswoman and director of health
promotions for the state Health Board.
   ``She feels now they did have an impact. The visits helped the
family tremendously,'' Van Dyke said Thursday.
   White, 18, has been in the intensive care unit at Riley Hospital
for Children for a week.
   Dr. Martin B. Kleiman said during a daily briefing Thursday
there had been no perceptible change in White's condition and he
remained on life-support systems. This morning, the hospital said
his condition was unchanged.
   Kleiman said he had been impressed by pop singer Elton John and
other celebrities, who have called and visited White's family at
the hospital.
   ``I've seen nobody trying to advance their personal careers.
They've come as private individuals, and they've been very honest
and very sincere in their concern for Ryan and the family,''
Kleiman said.
   Hospital switchboard operators said about 1,000 calls a day have
come in from celebrities and others expressing hope and concern for
White. A record of each call has been passed to the family.
   The callers have included Vice President Dan Quayle, Sen. Edward
Kennedy, and entertainers Michael Jackson, Carol Burnett, Lionel
Richie and Phil Donahue.
   One of the visitors was John, a long-time friend of White's who
passed out $500 worth of toys to other patients at the hospital
Thursday.
   John, who has been at the hospital since Monday night, went to a
toy store to buy gifts for White and other young patients.
   ``He bought stuffed animals, pretty much _ Minnie Mouse, Mickey
Mouse, lions and tigers,'' Eddie Birchel, a toy store spokesman
said. ``He signed a few autographs, and he joked around with some
people.''
   John has spent many hours with White's mother and sister,
16-year-old Andrea. He has declined requests for interviews.
   Clayton Archer, 18, a patient at Riley Hospital and a former
classmate of White's, said John's visit Wednesday made his day.
   ``I was always a pretty good fan of his,'' said Archer, who's
being treated for pneumonia. ``I never got to see him in concert;
so I'm really glad he came up, and I'm glad I got to see him.
   ``He gave me some tapes, his whole collection plus some other
stuff. I think he gave the toys to the kids in ICU who couldn't get
a lot of things.''

Strangeways Prison, including the self-professed leader of this
week's disturbance, remained on the loose inside the jail today in
a sixth day of defiance.
   News reports said the rebellious prisoners have been repeatedly
changing clothes with each other in a bid to confuse authorities
about the exact number involved. Some are masked, adding to the
uncertainty.
   Ivor Serle, chairman of the local chapter of the Prison Officers
Association, said those still refusing to surrender included 13 who
have been identified by authorities.
   He said 10 other inmates remained unaccounted for in the riot
that began Sunday at the overcrowded, Victorian prison. Officials
say a prisoner was fatally injured and 49 other people were hurt.
   Prison governor Brendan O'Friel told reporters on Thursday that
a search of most areas of the prison had found no bodies. But he
said he ``could not rule out the possibility of fatalities.''
   Some prisoners from Strangeways who have been transferred to
other prisons reported seeing bodies inside the prison, and reports
persisted Thursday of prisoners being hanged and tortured by fellow
inmates after the riot broke out.
   Prisoner Derek White, 46, died in North Manchester Hospital on
Tuesday of injuries he received at the hands of other inmates when
the riot began. He was in the prison in the northern city of
Manchester awaiting trial on charges of indecently assaulting three
children.
   Child molesters, together with convicted policemen and some
other groups, are regarded with particular loathing by other
inmates in English prisons.
   A prison guard, Walter Scott, 46, died in a hospital Thursday,
apparently after suffering a heart attack on Monday, the Home
Office reported. The Home Office _ which is responsible for
prisons, among other things _ said Scott was on duty when the riot
began but was not involved in combating it.
   Paul Taylor, self-professed leader of the disturbance, in a
speech which he shouted to reporters Thursday from the roof of the
prison, said the inmates had not intended to cause the riot.
   Shouting to be heard over the din of a police helicopter which
hovered overhead trying to drown him out, Taylor said a sit-in at
the jail's chapel was the plan Sunday when he grabbed the
chaplain's microphone and urged others to take action.
   ``At no time did anyone have any willful intention that we would
develop into a riot situation,'' Thomas, 28, shouted through a
makeshift bullhorn.
   At the height of the riot, rampaging inmates started fires in
various parts of the prison, smashed fittings and hurled down
slates from the roof.
   The government said Thursday it has ordered a major inquiry
headed by a senior judge, Sir Harry Woolf, into the violence.
   Inmates' relatives say tension at the facility was increased by
overcrowding, with up to three prisoners sharing cells designed for
one when the prison was built in 1868, unsanitary conditions, and
rules that allowed inmates to be locked in cells for up to 23 hours.
   Strangeways was built to hold 970 men. It had 1,648 prisoners on
Sunday. It contains inmates of all categories, from extremely
dangerous to low risk.

<HEAD>Attorney for Missing Moscow Circus Clown Says His Client Wants to
Defect</HEAD>

   A Moscow Circus clown who disappeared after
the troupe ended a two-month engagement here wants to defect, his
attorney said.
   ``He's applying for political asylum because he fears reprisals
from expressing his political views,'' attorney Michael Ross said
Thursday by telephone from Southern California.
   Ross wouldn't discuss the specific political views Sergei Uhanov
advocates that could get him into trouble, but intimated that many
Soviets still don't feel free to express their views despite
President Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness.
   ``Have you talked to many Soviets lately?'' Ross asked. ``It's
not that good over there.''
   Uhanov's last performance with the Moscow Circus at Bally's
Resort Casino-Reno was Sunday night. When he didn't show up for a
bus to the airport Monday, his friends checked his hotel room and
found that all of his possessions were gone, Bally's publicist
Brian Lawson said.
   A missing persons report was filed with Reno police on
Wednesday. Ross said he notified police Thursday that his client
was well.
   David Ilchert, a spokesman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service office in San Francisco, said it is the
agency's policy to neither confirm nor deny if his office had been
contacted by Uhanov.
   ``It's up to the person to make it public if they're seeking
asylum,'' Ilchert said.
   Uhanov, 28, is being sequestered pending approval of his
application for political asylum, Ross said. The attorney would not
reveal where the application would be filed or his client's current
location.
   However, Uhanov was spotted in a San Francisco restaurant this
week.
   ``He's been in here two of the last three nights with a couple
of attorneys, but he doesn't want much publicity because he's
trying to defect,'' said Lloyd Wiborg, owner of Scott's Restaurant.
``He's terrified that somebody is going to catch him and send him
back to Russia.''
   Ross said Uhanov wouldn't make any public statements until after
his asylum application is processed, possibly by next week.
   The rest of the Soviet troupe flew to New York City, where the
more than 100 circus performers are staying for a few days before
flying back to the Soviet Union, Lawson said.

   A sister ship to the tanker Exxon
Valdez, carrying more than 1.2 million barrels of crude, ran
aground in Long Beach Harbor but no oil was spilled, authorities
said.
   The 950-foot Exxon Long Beach scraped an ocean ridge as it was
leaving a harbor anchorage Thursday, said Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Jim
Milbury.
   The vessel was refloated in about 30 minutes and taken to a
harbor anchorage where a diver found no damage to its hull, a Coast
Guard statement said.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Chris Desmond said the ship was traveling
slowly when it struck the ridge.
   ``It's not a terribly unusual occurrence,'' he said.
   The Long Beach was carrying Alaskan North Slope crude for
off-loading at a harbor terminal.
   The 211,000-ton tanker is a sister ship to the Exxon Valdez,
which spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Alaska's
Prince William Sound in March 1989.

<HEAD>Pope Receives Arafat and Urges Israeli-Palestinian Negotiations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II met with PLO leader Yasser
Arafat today and urged Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate a
settlement allowing them both to live in peace.
   The pope reaffirmed that Palestinians, as well as Jews, have a
right to a homeland.
   The two men met for 20 minutes in the papal library in an
audience described by the Vatican as ``private.''
   It was their third meeting in eight years. John Paul had
previously received the Palestine Liberation Organization chairman
at the Vatican in 1982 and 1988, drawing protests from Israel and
Jewish groups.
   During this visit, the Israeli Embassy said it was ``mystified''
that Arafat was being treated by Italy and the Vatican as a ``man
of peace.''
   The papal meeting came on the second day of Arafat's two-day
visit to Italy. He has met with Italian government and political
leaders, seeking European support to force Israel to the bargaining
table.
   Israel's coalition government collapsed March 15 in a dispute
over a peace plan that called for preliminary meetings between
Israeli officials and Palestinians to discuss proposed elections in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, where the Palestinian
uprising began 27 months ago.
   Arafat's PLO helps direct the uprising, and Israel's government
has banned talks with Palestinians loyal to the PLO.
   In a statement after the talks, Vatican spokesman Joaquin
Navarro said the pope had agreed to meet Arafat to encourage ``any
positive attitude in the search for peace and especially to
strengthen the will for dialogue as the only valid way to find
adequate solutions for conflicts.''
   The statement noted that John Paul had often spoken out against
the recourse to arms and ``especially violence carried out by
terroristic means and by reprisal.''
   Navarro said the pope noted that this is the season of important
religious holidays: the Christian Easter, the Jewish Passover and
the Moslem Ramadan.
   ``The pope expressed the strong hope that Almighty God wishes to
listen to the pleas of so many faithful, and in particular of those
people of the Middle East, and grants them the so-desired peace in
justice and security,'' Navarro said.
   The pope, according to his spokesman, stressed that Israelis and
Palestinians must show a willingness for mutual understanding and
the respect for the rights and fears of each other in order to open
the way to negotiations.
   He said this would lead to a ``path which brings an end to the
sufferings and which allows each to live in peace, freedom, dignity
and calm in a homeland of one's own, open to collaboration with all
peoples of the region.''
   Navarro said the two also discussed the crisis in Lebanon, with
the pope stressing that the use of arms would not succeed in
bringing dignity and sovereignty to that country.
   The Vatican sought to emphasize that the Arafat visit did not
have an official status. The PLO leader was identified simply as
``Mr. Yasser Arafat,'' and a pool of journalists organized to
witness the pope greeting Arafat was canceled.
   The Vatican has no formal diplomatic ties with Israel. It has
cited Israel's unsettled boundaries, the contested status of
Jerusalem and the Palestinian question as the reasons for the
absence of relations.

   Actors Judd Nelson, Howard Hesseman and
Elizabeth Pena canvassed passers-by at a subway stop as part of a
nationwide campaign by Hollywood stars to register voters who favor
abortion rights.
   ``I walked right by Judd Nelson,'' said Joyce Cunha, associate
director of MassChoice, an affiliate of the National Abortion
Rights Action League.
   She described him as ``a typical brat packer ... wearing dark
glasses and a suit jacket. I just sort of stopped and said `Hey,
that's great.'''
   Nelson, who has starred in several of the films for Hollywood's
younger set, including ``The Breakfast Club'' and ``St. Elmo's
Fire,'' passed out pamphlets that read ``Join The Breakfast Club.
Register to vote pro-choice.''
   Hesseman stars in the TV sitcom ``Head Of The Class.'' His
leaflet urged: ``Go to the head of the class. Register to vote.''
   Ms. Pena appeared in the TV miniseries ``Drug Wars: The Camarena
Story'' and the short-lived series ``I Married Dora.''
   Between 40 and 50 people registered during the Thursday morning
effort, Cunha said.
   The actors were emissaries from the Hollywood Policy Foundation
Center, the non-profit arm of the Hollywood Women's Political
Action Committee.

   Soldiers and police cleared city halls in
Michoacan state of leftist opposition supporters who staged a
four-month sit-in to protest elections they said the governing
party stole from them.
   The security forces, backed by armored vehicles on Thursday
retook the 21 buildings closed since the disputed municipal
elections held Dec. 3 in the region, a stronghold of the opposition
Democratic Revolutionary Party.
   ``We won't allow any political force in the state to put itself
above the law,'' Interior Secretary Fernando Gutierrez Barrios said
of the crackdown.
   Wilbert Rosas, spokesman for the opposition party, said
authorities used tear gas and water hoses to disperse protesters in
this western state and that more than 100 people were detained.
   Police said at least 17 people were arrested, most for illegal
possession of firearms, but that no injuries were reported.
   ``There hasn't been even one blow nor one drop of blood,''
Attorney General Enrique Alvarez del Castillo told the private
Televisa TV network.
   The government news agency Notimex reported late Thursday that
army troops and police were sent to oust the activists.
   Sixty police officers were sent to Michoacan ``to guarantee
peace,'' said Fernando Arias, spokesman for the attorney general's
office. He said the local government requested the forces. It was
not clear how many soldiers were dispatched.
   The activists warned there could be a ``bloodbath'' in the state.
   At least seven people died in February and in March in
neighboring Guerrero state during protests of alleged election
fraud.
   The Revolutionary Democratic Party says the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has been in power for 61
years, cheated it out of victory in the Dec. 3 elections in both
states.
   Television news showed armored vehicles patrolling the streets
of Michoacan. Witnesses said the vehicles began arriving Wednesday.
   The fraud protests have brought Michoacan to the edge of
``anarchy,'' Gov. Jaime Genovevo Figueroa Zamudio said in a letter
published in Mexico City newspapers Thursday.
   ``The city halls have been taken over by armed people who have
intimidated the population, who have created illegal police forces
and tried to collect for public services,'' a high government
source said on condition of anonymity.
   Michoacan has been a thorn for the governing party since the
1988 presidential race, when founder Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a former
Michoacan governor, ran second to President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari in an election still clouded by allegations of vote fraud.
   Cardenas, in a speech Thursday, urged his supporters to avoid
violence.
   Nearly half of Michoacan's city halls were occupied by Cardenas'
supporters after the national elections.
   There were more occupations after the July 2 state elections in
which the governing party claimed a majority in the state
legislative races.
   Official results from the December balloting show the governing
party won local elections in 56 municipalities, the Democratic
Revolutionary Party in 52, the conservative National Action Party
in three and the leftist Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution
in one.
   The Democratic Revolutionary Party alleges it won at least 20
more elections.

<HEAD>Orthodox Jew Stabbed in Old City of Jerusalem</HEAD>

   An Orthodox Jew was stabbed in the back today
as he wheeled his 1-year-old son in a carriage through the Moslem
Quarter of Jerusalem's walled Old City, police said.
   The baby carriage overturned, but the child was not injured. The
victim, Danny Robbins, pulled out a pistol and fired three times in
the air to summon police help, said police inspector Rahamim
Comfort.
   Robbins, 35, was reported in satisfactory condition at Hadassah
Ein Kerem Hospital.
   Police closed off all gates to the Old City and rounded up about
100 Palestinian suspects after the stabbing, Comfort said on Israel
radio.
   Police at the scene said the attacker apparently was a
Palestinian with a political motive. The bespectacled Robbins was
wearing the skullcap of a religious Jew at the time of the attack.
   The stabbing occurred mid-morning on a dark, narrow street
covered with a vaulted ceiling. The street is like many in the Old
City, a busy area often crowded with shoppers and tourists.
   Robbins said on the radio that he lives in the Moslem Quarter
and was on his way to the grocery store when he was attacked. He
complained that no one tried to stop his assailant.
   ``Nobody chased after him. They saw him, they saw him very well,
but nobody tried to chase him,'' Robbins said. ``He was not armed
except for the knife that remained in my back.''
   Robbins is only one of a handful of Jews living among the 20,000
Arabs of the Moslem Quarter.
   In August, the Jerusalem Post quoted a spokesman for Atara
Leyoshna, a Jewish organization dedicated to buying houses from
Arabs in the Moslem Quarter, as saying 25 Jewish families have
moved into the area.
   There have been several stabbings of Jews in the Old City during
the 27-month Palestinian uprising against Israel's occupation of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   At least 672 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during
the uprising in the occupied territories. Another 202 Palestinians
have been killed by their fellow Arabs, accused of cooperating with
Israel and 43 Israelis have died in the violence.
   The most recent attack in Jerusalem was the January stabbing of
a woman soldier in the Moslem Quarter.
   In September, a Jewish seminary student was stabbed with a
screwdriver and moderately injured in the Moslem Quarter.
   Most of the city's major tourist attractions are amid the narrow
stone streets within the walled city, which is part of the area
annexed by Israel after its capture from Jordan in the 1967 Middle
East war.
   These include the Western Wall, the last remnant of the ancient
Jewish Temple, the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques, and the
Church of the Holy Sepulcher.

<HEAD>China and U.S. Agree to Resume Fulbright Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has agreed to resume the Fulbright scholar
exchange program with the United States, but on a smaller scale, a
U.S. Embassy official said today.
   China abruptly canceled the 1989-90 program in August in anger
over U.S. criticism of the military suppression of the student-led
movement for democratic reform.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a formal
agreement was reached Wednesday with the State Education Commission
for the 1990-91 academic year starting in the fall.
   Sixteen American professors will come to China, and 16 Chinese
scholars will do advanced research at U.S. universities, he said.
   The 1989-90 program had called for an exchange of 24 scholars
from each side, with 12 graduate students and 12 research fellows
representing China. It had been one of the largest Fulbright
programs, which exchange American and foreign scholars around the
world.
   The Chinese government has sharply curtailed approval of
overseas studies for undergraduates and most graduate students
since its crackdown on political dissent last spring.
   The government, while insisting it will continue overseas study
programs, is now limiting scholarships mainly to older scholars in
technical fields for short-term programs.
   The reasoning is that such scholars will be less likely to
become involved in politics while abroad and will be less tempted
to join the thousands of Chinese students who have failed to return
home after completing their programs.
   The U.S. Embassy, in a statement, said the Fulbright program
``fills a need not addressed in other exchange programs'' and the
agreement was ``a positive step toward the resumption of this
important program.''
   It added: ``We hope the Chinese will resume the participation of
Chinese graduate students in the near future, and will take steps
in other areas that will be conducive to reform and to China's
opening to the outside world.''
   The exchange of 16 scholars on each side roughly returns the
program to its size during the 1984-85 academic year.
   Discussion on resuming the exchanges began after President Bush
dispatched National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft to Beijing in
December for talks aimed at easing bilateral tensions.
   No progress has been made in other areas deemed crucial to
improved relations.
   China is believed to still be holding without trial thousands of
people who participated in last year's democracy movement, and it
has taken a hard-line position on the release of astrophysicist and
political dissident Fang Lizhi.
   Fang and his wife, Li Shuxian, took refuge in the U.S. Embassy
after the military crackdown in June and have since been charged as
counterrevolutionaries.
   Negotiations on their safe passage out of the country have
apparently stalled, with China continuing to insist the two give
themselves up to Chinese authorities and ``admit their guilt.''
   The Fulbright program was established in 1946 under legislation
by former Sen. J. William Fulbright, D-Ark. More than 167,000
people, including 58,000 from the United States and 109,000 from
abroad, have participated.

   An animal rights activist turned down a
plea bargain that would have allowed her to serve only one year in
prison on an attempted murder charge because the agreement did not
include visits with her dogs.
   Fran Trutt, who is charged with attempted murder, possession of
explosives and bomb manufacturing, will go to trial for planting a
bomb at a company that demonstrates surgical staples on dogs in
1988. She faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.
   Plea negotiations in which Trutt would have pleaded no contest
to at least one of the three charges broke down Thursday when
prison officials refused to grant her permission to see her pets,
said John Williams, Trutt's lawyer.
   ``She was willing to allow herself to be incarcerated for a
crime she did not commit in order to see her dogs immediately,''
Williams said. ``She would do anything to see her dogs. The only
thing you could compare it with is a mother seeing a child.''
   Michael Donahue, a spokesman for the state Department of
Correction, said: ``Our policy has been and remains that for
safety, health and security reasons, canines are not allowed to the
facilities to visit those who are incarcerated.''
   Trutt is being held at Connecticut Correctional Institution in
Niantic on $500,000 bond and has not seen her dogs since her arrest
in November 1988.
   Williams said Trutt was distraught because she will have to wait
months with no possibility of seeing the dogs. Her trial is
expected to last into the fall.
   Trutt was arrested for allegedly planting a remote-controlled
pipe bomb near the corporate parking space of Leon Hirsch,
president of U.S. Surgical in Norwalk.
   Trutt has said she planted the bomb to scare Hirsch and protest
the company's use of about 1,000 anesthetized dogs annually in
training physicians to use surgical staples in place of stitches.
The dogs are then destroyed.
   Williams last month filed a civil lawsuit against the state in
U.S. District Court in New Haven charging that Trutt's
constitutional rights are being violated because she is not
permitted to see her dogs.
   The state has until Monday to respond.
   In January, Trutt was sentenced to 14 months in prison after
pleading guilty to charges of illegally possessing two bombs in her
New York City apartment. She already has served that time.

<HEAD>Seventh Woman Found Strangled in Kansas City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A young woman has been found strangled
in the same area where six other bodies have been discovered since
September, fueling fears that the deaths are the work of a serial
killer.
   It was the seventh time in as many months that a black woman in
her 20s or 30s has been found dead in or around Gillham Park, said
Sgt. Greg Mills of the Kansas City Police Department.
   All the women had been strangled, Mills said, and none of the
killings has been solved.
   He would say only that police are investigating the possibility
of a serial killer.
   The latest victim was discovered Thursday morning by a woman
walking her dog, Mills said. The victim was identified as Michelle
Mitchell, 22, of Kansas City.
   The Jackson County medical examiner's office determined she had
been strangled, and police said she had been dead four to six hours
before her body was discovered.
   The unexplained killings began in September when the bodies of
three women were found over 10 days. Two more women were found dead
the next month. The latest victim before Thursday was that of a
23-year-old woman found in Gillham Park on Jan. 18.
   Police began considering the possibility of a serial killer
after the October deaths.
   ``We are not in a position to say it is, but the similarities
have not escaped us,'' Mill said.
   ``We don't have one definite thing that ties all of them
together conclusively, and until then, it would be irresponsible to
say they were all committed by one person,'' he said.
   Gillham Park is located in a residential neighborhood in the
city's Midtown area, south of downtown.

<HEAD>Last Of Original Preservation Hall Jazz Musicians Dead At 87</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Funeral services will be Monday for jazz
trombonist Louis Nelson, the last surviving musician from the
original Preservation Hall bands.
   Nelson, 87, died Thursday from injuries suffered in a car
accident 10 days earlier.
   ``He was someone who played with the musicians of the last
century and played almost into the next one,'' said jazz historian
Dick Allen.
   Nelson's last performance was two weeks ago at the Palm Court
cafe in the French Quarter with his Louis Nelson All Stars. He had
been scheduled to perform this weekend at the French Quarter
Festival but complained he had not felt well since another driver
had collided with his vehicle after running a red light.
   Although he did not appear seriously injured from the accident,
he collapsed Wednesday night and was rushed to a hospital, where he
never recovered.
   A funeral will be held Monday.
   ``He was the last personal link to the original tailgate
style,'' Allen said. ``That's the way trombonists used to play in
New Orleans _ sitting on the tailgate of the wagon as they
advertised dances.''
   Nelson was playing with the Kid Thomas band in 1961, when
private jam sessions at a French Quarter art gallery became so
popular that the place was opened as Preservation Hall, dedicated
to keeping the old-time music alive.
   Nelson became an indefatigable international star, touring South
America, Australia and Europe. He was booked for a tour of Japan in
August.
   At the time of his death he was still playing Preservation Hall
twice a week with the Kid Sheik band, as well as leading his own
band on Saturdays.
   His style ranged from the unbridled energy of traditional New
Orleans jazz to the sweet, lyrical sliding melodies of the swing
era.
   Nelson was born in New Orleans on Sept. 17, 1902, but grew up in
Napoleonville. His mother was a mathematician and a graduate of the
Boston Conservatory of Music; his father was a physician.
   In the 1920s he played with the Kid Harris Dixieland Band and
Kid Rena. He was a member of the famed Sidney Desvigne's band for
15 years, including five years playing on a Mississippi riverboat.
   During the Depression, he was in the Works Progress
Administration's big band and during World War II he was in the
Naval Band. After the war, he joined Kid Thomas at Specks' Moulin
Rouge in Marrero, where their hard-driving band acheived instant
fame.
   Since then he has played with numerous bands, including George
Lewis, Kid Howard and Billie and DeDe Pierce, and made records all
over the world.
   Nelson is survived by his daughter, Anna Tircuit of New Orleans;
seven grandchildren; 14 great-grandchildren; and three
great-great-grandchildren.

   AIDS cases reported worldwide increased 6.5
percent last month to more than 237,000, with Zaire and the Ivory
Coast more than doubling their figures, the U.N. World Health
Organization said today.
   As of the end of March, 237,140 cases of the immune-stripping
disease were reported, the organization said, up from 222,740 the
month before.
   Zaire last month listed 11,732 cases as of Jan. 31, up from
4,636 reported at the end of 1988.
   Ivory Coast listed 3,647 cases, against 1,010 reported last
October.
   Most other African countries did not file new reports during the
month and 11 have not sent in updates for more than a year.
   Congo's latest report dates Dec. 9, 1987, when it listed 1,250
cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.
   With the new figures, Zaire replaced Brazil as the country with
the second highest total, trailing only the United States, which
still accounts for slightly more than half the global total. It
reported 124,182 cases on March 31, up from 121,645 reported at the
end of January.
   Brazil listed 10,058 cases in February, compared with 9,555
reported by the end of last year.
   The statistics, including 153 countries, were included in the
latest issue of WHO's Weekly Epidemiological Record.
   Dr. Jonathan Mann, who resigned last month as director of WHO's
AIDS program, has said the real number of AIDS victims may have
already been as high as 600,000 by the end of last year, including
an estimated 300,000 fatalities.
   Dr. Mann predicts that 6 million AIDS cases may occur by the
year 2000 and has warned that if HIV infection accelerates,
especially in Asia, even this estimate will be too low.

   Moslem separatists today kidnapped a
leading industrialist and a university official and threatened to
kill them unless three jailed militants were freed, police and a
telephone caller said.
   Soldiers tightened security throughout the troubled Kashmir
Valley and blocked off roads in and out of Srinagar, where the
kidnappings took place.
   Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said soldiers
killed six separatists who tried to cross into neighboring Pakistan
on Thursday to seek training and weapons.
   The telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were
holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24
hours after a Monday afternoon deadline for the release of three
jailed militants.
   The telephone caller claimed to speak for the Students
Liberation Front, a branch of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front
fighting for autonomy in the predominantly Moslem state in mainly
Hindu India.
   Both the caller and police sources said the vice chancellor of
Kashmir University, Mushir ul-Haq, and the general manager of
Hindustan Machine Tools Co., L.M. Khela, had been abducted.
   The telephone caller, who didn't give his name, claimed Mushir's
private secretary also was being held hostage, but that could not
be independently confirmed.
   Moslem separatists had warned officials in the Indian government
to leave Jammu-Kashmir state by the end of March or ``face the
consequences.''
   The border incident took place Thursday in the Kupwara district,
where at least 20 separatists were trying to sneak into Pakistan to
receive military training and buy weapons, police said. No further
details were immediately available.
   India claims Pakistan trains and arms the militants, but
Pakistan has denied the claim. The two countries have fought two
wars over the region since 1947 when both nations won independence
from British colonial rule.
   At least 255 people have died in Jammu-Kashmir since Jan. 20,
when the Indian government launched a crackdown on the separatist
movement. Most of the victims have been Moslem protesters defying
curfew or militants killed in gunbattles with security forces.
   Kashmiri militants had earlier demanded union with Islamic
Pakistan but now seek independence and the status of a neutral
country.
   India's Jammu-Kashmir state, which includes the scenic Kashmir
valley in the north and the plains of Jammu in the south, is
India's only state with a majority of Moslems.
   About 64 percent of the state's 6 million people are Moslems.
Nationwide, Moslems comprise 12 percent of india's 880 million
people. Hindus account for 82 percent.

<HEAD>Many Greeks Trek to Their Hometowns for Election Vote</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Athenians left today for
their voting districts in the provinces and on Aegean islands to
cast ballots in the country's third national elections in 10 months.
   Police reported traffic delays at toll booths on the national
highway leading out of the capital.
   Olympic Airways, the national carrier, offered extra domestic
flights and chartered planes from Balkan-Bulgarian airlines to
accommodate the expected travel overflow. State-run buses and
railways offered discounts on fares as an incentive to Greeks to
return to their hometowns to vote in Sunday's election.
   Many Greeks who moved to big cities from the provinces over the
years have never changed their voting districts in order to avoid
the bureaucracy of re-registering and to maintain ties with their
hometowns.
   Greece has 8,050,658 registered voters among its 10 million
population. Over one-third of the population leaves in or near the
capital; about 600,000 live in Salonica, the nation's second
largest city.
   Voting is compulsory for people between 18 and 70.
   Sunday's general election is the third in 10 months. Two earlier
polls ended inconclusively with no one party winning an absolute
majority in the 300-member, single-chamber Parliament. Two
coalitions failed to resolve the country's pressing social
problems, prompting another vote.
   Opinion polls forecast another political deadlock when the
ballots are counted after polls close Sunday night.
   The exodus to the provinces was expected to peak later today
when shops and private businesses closed for the weekend.
   Most government agencies closed at noon today. Civil services
were not expected to return to normal until Tuesday because the law
provides for three days' travel time for voters who are registered
out of town.

   Jurors in John Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial
resumed deliberations today for a fifth day with no indication they
were approaching a verdict soon.
   On Thursday, jurors sent out a note asking for a dictionary,
triggering a brief flurry of activity as U.S. District Court Judge
Harold Greene and lawyers in the case debated whether they should
fill the request.
   The judge and lawyers for both sides were against providing a
dictionary, and the jurors subsequently said they didn't need one,
anyway.
   ``The next thing you know they will look up `conspiracy' and
then they will know more about it than we do,'' Greene quipped.
   Poindexter, former White House national security adviser, is
charged with conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two
counts of making false statements.
   Prosecutor Dan Webb said he has experience with dictionary
requests from other trials. He suggested the judge find out what
word the jurors wanted to look up, and then possibly send the
definition to them.
   If it's a legal term, it wouldn't be appropriate to give the
definition, since the judge already had instructed the jurors on
the law, Webb suggested. If it's not a legal term, it would be
proper to illuminate the jurors, he added.
   Greene agreed that a response of some kind should be sent the
jurors, saying ``I hate to ... tell them, `No, go away, don't
bother me'.''
   Defense attorney Richard Beckler had no objection to the plan.
   Greene sent a note to the jurors asking them about the word.
   Ten minutes later, laughter erupted in the courtroom as Greene
climbed to the bench and read the note from jurors, which said,
``Thank you. The definition we requested before is no longer
needed.''
   Poindexter, who was national security adviser to former
President Reagan, is accused of covering up Oliver North's military
assistance to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua and the U.S. role in a
November 1985 shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Iran.
   The jurors were sequestered Tuesday after news reporters
contacted two jurors.
   The eight women and four men are in the care of U.S. marshals.
Under a court order, the marshals transport them between the
federal courthouse and a hotel and provide them with meals and up
to two alcoholic beverages a day.

   A college student was either out of her mind
or lying, attorneys told jurors who began deciding whether she
should be imprisoned for life in the drowning of her newborn in a
dormitory toilet.
   If convicted of first-degree murder, 18-year-old freshman Claire
Moritt would be ineligible for parole until she's 43 under
mandatory sentencing guidelines.
   ``Be certain you can live with it the rest of your life, because
Claire Moritt will,'' defense attorney B. Anderson Mitcham warned
the jury before it began considering its
   The 12 jurors met for about three hours Thursday and were
sequestered for the night before resuming deliberations this
morning.
   A full day of closing arguments Thursday focused on the defense
argument that Ms. Moritt was temporarily insane and had no memory
of being pregnant or giving birth.
   ``The excuse `I don't remember' may just be the biggest lie of
all,'' said Assistant State Attorney Stephen Crawford. ``It keeps
you from having to explain all the other inconsistencies in your
story.''
   Crawford recounted in detail the morning of Oct. 23, 1989, when
the Hillsborough Community College student from Hollywood gave
birth in her dorm room. He claimed she made a conscious decision to
kill her baby son.
   Using a chalkboard, diagrams and a photograph of the dead
6-pound, 9-ounce infant, Crawford began by describing how a
roommate awoke to the sounds of a baby crying.
   ``It's nothing. I'm having my period. Go to bed,'' was Ms.
Moritt's explanation, according to court testimony.
   When Ms. Moritt went into the bathroom and her roommate noticed
blood on the floor and more crying sounds, other friends gathered
outside her door for nearly an hour asking her what was wrong.
   ``Her roommates were going to come in and find her. She had to
do something,'' Crawford told the jury.
   When roommates finally did get inside, the found Ms. Moritt
kneeling next to the toilet, where later in the day they discovered
the baby stuffed headfirst, wrapped in bloody towels and sheets.
   Mitcham emphasized during his final arguments that nine
psychiatrists and psychologists had testified Ms. Moritt suffered
from a dissociative disorder in which she mentally denied the
existence of the pregnancy and the events surrounding it.
   ``Claire fits the dissociative disorder perfectly,'' Mitcham
said, noting that one expert even planned to use the case as an
example in his medical school classes. ``You're going to have to
decide whether she knew what she was doing or not.''
   But prosecutor Crawford blasted the defense psychiatrist and
psychologist testimony as ``psychobabble,'' saying that nobody can
tell what was in a person's mind five or six months ago.
   ``There's a difference between denying something and flat-out
lying,'' Crawford said, adding that Ms. Moritt variously explained
her apparent pregnancy to her friends an ulcer, tumor and ovarian
cyst.
   ``Down through the ages criminals have tried to flee,'' Crawford
said. ``She attempted to flee _ not physically but mentally _ from
the scene of the crime. Don't let her do it.''

<TEXT>
   An unemployed man, described by
police as confused, sprayed Rembrandt's famous painting ``The Night
Watch'' with an unidentified chemical today, but museum officials
said damage was minimal.
   It was the second attack on the priceless art work in nearly 15
years, and the third this century.
   Dutch Television said the spray was concentrated sulfuric acid,
but museum officials would not confirm the report.
   Immediately after the attack, a museum guard applied a
neutralizing agent, and the damage to the 1642 masterpiece appeared
limited to surface veneer, Rijksmuseum spokesman Piet van Thiel
said.
   Museum guards seized the attacker and handed him over to police,
according to another museum spokesman, Frans van der Avert. The
painting is guarded around-the-clock by an unarmed security company
worker.
   Police said they did not know what prompted the attack.
   Spokesman Klaas Wilting said the 31-year-old suspect was a Dutch
national from The Hague, the capital of the Netherlands. The man
was not identified by name in line with police policy and was being
held on suspicion of vandalism.
   ``He is confused and not telling us anything at the moment,''
Wilting said shortly after the attack.
   Barry Olshen of Toronto, Canada, said he was standing among a
group of museum visitors and right next to the man, who was wearing
a long, hooded tan coat.
   The vandal pushed his way through the crowd to a steel barrier
about two yards in front of the painting.
   Suddenly he took a ``little spray pump he had been concealing in
his hand'' and sprayed the painting, Olshen told The Associated
Press.
   The chemical dripped over an area of almost a square yard,
covering it in white splotches.
   The damage ``doesn't seem to be too bad,'' Van Thiel told
reporters at the national museum. He said the chemical failed to
eat its way through the painting's veneer to the delicate paint
layer.
   ``Immediately after the attack, the guard slapped the bottle out
of his hand (and) sprayed the painting with a benign chemical
substance that is always there,'' Van Thiel said.
   He said the painting would be taken to a secret location for
restoration but would probably be on display again in about two
weeks.
   Van Thiel said a new veneer layer would take several months to
dry, during which the painting would be kept behind glass to
protect it from dust.
   He said there were no plans to put the painting, which yearly
attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world,
behind a protective shield.
   The painting has been under permanent guard since 1979, when it
was put back on diplay after a four-year restoration period that
followed a knife attack on Sept. 14, 1975.
   A Dutch schoolmaster claiming to be on a divine mission made
several deep slashes in ``The Night Watch.'' He was never tried but
committed to a mental asylum, where he later committed suicide.
   During World War I, an unemployed shoemaker made several knife
slashes in the art work to protest his inability to find work.
   ``The Night Watch'' measures 12 feet by 14.5 feet and shows a
gathering of 17th-century militiamen. It is believed to commemorate
celebrations surrounding the 1638 visit to the Dutch capital by
French Queen Maria de Medici.
   It is considered a prime example of Rembrandt's skilled handling
of light and dark. Its most noteworthy artistic element is a beam
of light which illuminates a richly dressed woman in the foreground.
   The museum has never valued ``The Night Watch,'' which is not
insured, in line with Culture Ministry policy.

<HEAD>Woman Says Husband Committed Suicide Over Fight With IRS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A North Carolina woman told a Senate panel
today that her husband was so distraught from a lingering fight
with the Internal Revenue Service that he killed himself so she
could use his insurance money to continue the battle.
   The courts eventually ruled that Kay Council of High Point,
N.C., owed nothing and ordered the IRS to cancel a lien on her
property. However, she told the Senate Finance oversight
subcommittee, she has spent $70,000 in legal fees, she had to sell
her home, her credit rating is stained and ``I was cheated of
growing old with the man I love.''
   ``We just got caught up in the middle of a big IRS screw-up,''
Mrs. Council said, ``and we couldn't get out of it.''
   Mrs. Council's story highlighted a subcommittee hearing into how
the IRS is implementing the so-called Taxpayer Bill of Rights, a
1988 law designed to protect taxpayers in disputes with the agency.
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr., who preceded Mrs. Council
to the witness stand, was not asked about her story. She has
refused to sign a waiver of her privacy rights and the IRS is thus
prohibited from discussing the case.
   On the whole, Goldberg said, ``we are indeed making a great deal
of progress'' in seeing that taxpayer rights are respected. He
acknowledged that mistakes are made, and pleaded for tax
simplification and a budget big enough to train the IRS's 120,000
employees.
   ``What the American public resents is complexity, uncertainty
... hassles with the IRS that take month after month after month to
resolve,'' Goldberg said.
   Questioned by Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., the subcommittee
chairman, Goldberg denied the IRS has a quota system for rewarding
collections officers or a bounty system for businesses that snitch
on cheating competitors.
   ``I think that is reprehensible,'' Goldberg said after Pryor
read a second-hand account from a businessman who reported
attending a meeting in which an IRS agent implied a lower tax bill
for those who turned in cheats. ``We're not going to let it
happen,'' the commissioner said.
   The Councils' problems with the IRS began after their attempt to
write off a $70,000 tax-shelter loss on their 1979 tax return was
rejected. Mrs. Council said she and her husband had been prepared
to pay the tax shortage resulting from that denial, but that the
IRS never informed them of the deficiency.
   In 1983, she said, the IRS sent a bill for $183,021 taxes and
interest, but it was not until two years later that the notice of
deficiency arrived _ four years late. The agency was slow in
admitting the mistake, although it turned out that the original
notice had been mailed to the wrong address.
   After years of fighting in the courts, Mrs. Council said, she
came home one evening in June 1988 and found a note from her
husband.
   ``I have taken my life in order to provide capital for you. ...
It's purely a business decision,'' the note read. ``You will find
my body on the lot on the north side of the house.''
   Mrs. Council pleaded with Congress to ``control the IRS, to keep
it from destroying people's lives.''

<HEAD>Oregon Episcopal School Found Negligent in Mount Hood Tragedy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The father of a 16-year-old boy who died
climbing Mount Hood says he'll use part of a half-million-dollar
jury award to create a memorial fund for his son.
   ``It isn't the money. I wanted everyone to know those deaths
were needless,'' Richard Haeder said after a jury ruled the Oregon
Episcopal School was negligent in his son's death.
   But the same jury found no negligence by Ralph Summers, the
guide hired by the private school to help lead the ill-fated climb
up Oregon's highest peak in May 1986.
   Haeder's son, Richard, was among nine who died on the climb,
including its leader, the Rev. Thomas Goman. Summers was the only
adult to survive, along with three students.
   Neither Summers nor Oregon Episcopal School officials would
comment.
   It was the first suit stemming from the tragedy to come to
trial. Parents of at least five of the victims settled with the
school out of court.
   The Multnomah County Circuit Court jury delivered the verdict
shortly before 8 p.m. Thursday following about 5{ hours of
deliberation.
   Haeder said that he and his wife, Judith, hope the verdict will
encourage safer climbing and prevent other parents from having to
``endure the anguish we've had to.''
   He declined to comment on the jury's decision not to find
Summers negligent.
   His attorneys claimed during the trial that Goman and Summers
forced the students up to near the summit of the 11,235-foot
mountain despite bad weather and signs of hypothermia.
   The party got lost in a blizzard as they retreated from the
summit and were forced to dig a snow cave for shelter as the sun
set.
   The next morning, Summers and a student hiked to safety and
notified authorities. The snow cave wasn't marked, however, and it
took two days of intensive searching to find the bodies of Goman,
another adult and seven students.
   Two other students were found alive.
   In closing arguments, Haeder's attorney, Paul Luvera, reminded
the jury that Haeder's son pleaded to return.
   ``Richie was crying; he wanted to go back and they kept going,''
Luvera said. ``And then he died a horrible, painful death with
people dying all around him in a tomb made of ice.''
   Attorney Mark Wagner, representing Summers and the school, said
the storm that struck the mountain was three times stronger than
had been predicted.
   ``People died because a storm came in before our people got off
the mountain,'' he said. ``In the real world, accidents do happen
and it doesn't mean people are negligent or at fault.''

<HEAD>Caucasus Republic's Party Chief Replaced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party officials meeting in the troubled
Caucasus republic of Armenia today replaced their party leader
Suren Arutyunyan, the Tass news agency said.
   Arutyunyan was appointed in May 1988 after the first wave of
ethnic violence between Armenia and neighboring Azerbaijan over
control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.
   But the violence only has gotten worse. Hundreds of people have
been killed in the past two years and hundreds of thousands more
have been forced to flee their homes.
   Tass said the Central Committee of the Amenian Communist Party
replaced Arutyunyan at his own request so he could be transferred
to other work. It did not say what new job the former party leader
would take up.
   He was replaced by V.M. Movsisyan, a first deputy premier and
head of the republic's agricultural-industrial complex.
   Arutyunyan was replaced a couple of months after the Azerbaijan
Communist Party chief, Abdul-Rakhman Vezirov, lost his job and was
expelled from the party. He was blamed for serious mistakes that
led to bloodshed in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku.
   Anti-Armenian riots broke out in Baku on Jan. 13 and Soviet
troops stormed into the city a week later. By official count about
200 people were killed.
   Vezirov and Arutyunyan were picked to run their republics on the
same day, May 21, 1988. But the party organizations in both
republics have been criticized for failing to control the unrest
and increasing calls for the two republics to gain more freedom or
even leave the Soviet Union.

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 of the nation's newspaper editors
met here this week to talk shop and look over some political
leaders. Footnotes from the meeting of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>``Catching the News''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   At a time of stagnant newspaper circulation, editors worried
about the challenge of producing a newspaper that simultaneously
appeals to two groups: loyal readers, who like to read and are
deeply interested in the world; and the often-younger readers _ or
non-readers _ who grew up on television, have little love of
reading and chiefly want news that will affect their lives.
   Researcher Kris McGrath, who helped write a report on ``How
Readers Look at Newspapers,'' put the distinction this way:
   ``In this nation of specialists, the daily newspaper habit
appears to be declining. People speak of `catching' the news rather
than keeping up with it. The preferred way to `catch' the news
often is while doing something else _ listening to the radio while
driving or watching TV while exercising. It's hard to do something
else while reading a newspaper other than drink a cup of coffee _
and coffee consumption is down, too.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Stealing from the Communists</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, former player for the professional
Buffalo Bills football team, former congressman and former
candidate for the 1988 Republican presidential nomination, gave the
editors a speech full of the usual Kemp evangelism.
   He was introduced as a ``bleeding-heart conservative'' and in
his speech used the term ``capitalism with a human face.'' An
editor accused Kemp of benign plagiarism, swiping the catchword of
Czechoslvakian communist reformers who were suppresed by Soviet
tanks in 1968.
   Said the editor: ``You speak of `capitalism with a human face.'
That actually is a paraphrase of Euro-communism, which was
`communism with a human face.'''
   Replied Kemp: ``I'm not troubled at all by phrases. I can defend
liberal democratic values in a Republican convention. ... So
phrases don't bother me at all, whether I'm a bleeding-heart
conservative or a progressive conservative or a Jeffersonian
democratic Republican. ... So I'm not afraid at all to say that I
would support the idea of capitalism with a human face or a
socially responsible capitalist economy.''

   One of the meeting's most dramatic moments occurred when Leroy
Aarons, senior vice president for news at the Oakland (Calif.)
Tribune, ended a report to the editors on the views of homosexual
journalists by publicly revealing his own sexual orientation.
   In a paragraph scribbled at the end of his typewritten text and
read hurriedly in a choked voice, Aarons said:
   ``I want you to know that the doing of this report has had
tremendous impact on gay and lesbian journalists across the nation.
It has given them hope and new optimism. It has enhanced their
respect for this organization. I, as an editor and a gay man, am
proud of ASNE.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Using Homosexuals' Expertise</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Aarons reported that the 205 gay journalists who took part in a
survey felt that ``coverage of gay and lesbian issues _ other than
AIDS _ is at best mediocre.''
   He said newspapers failed to take advantage of the expertise
that their homosexual staff members could provide.
   ``We don't have to prime the supply pump to get gay and lesbian
expertise on our staffs _ it is already there,'' he said. ``They
may be hiding, but they are there, eager to be heard.
   ``The point to emphasize here is the link between workplace
issues and coverage. A newsroom in which gay and lesbian staff
people feel safe and accepted is one in which they will come
forward and make their case on coverage. A workplace is which gays
and lesbians know they can aspire to management roles, even though
it is known they are gay, will be one with enhanced sensitivity to
these issues in our communities. A newsroom where insulting remarks
are forbidden also becomes a newsroom in which sensitive
terminology is encoded and enforced.''

<HEAD>Feeding the Habit</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   David Halberstam, former Pulitzer prize-winning newspaper
reporter, told the editors the way to retain readers is to improve
their papers. He lectured on the danger of paying more attention to
the bottom line than the printed word.
   ``A newspaper is like an addiction,'' Halberstam said. ``You
have to have it. You have to read the sports, this section, that
section. If you start shrinking it, you cut down the addiction.''

   The chief of the city Housing Department police
admits he committed a .38-caliber boo-boo in his office and now, as
judge, jury and executioner, will punish himself.
   Chief Louis Raiford Jr. said he inadvertently fired one of his
two handguns as he sat at his desk Thursday. The bullet went
through a wall to the adjoining office, where it lodged in the coat
of Assistant Chief Peter Cummings, who luckily was in shirtsleeves
at the time.
   Raiford's offense is formally called failure to safeguard his
weapon, which calls for disciplinary action _ by the chief.
   ``I'm fully qualified to make the decision,'' Raiford said.
   He said he was considering options ranging from forfeiting five
days pay, nearly $2,000 at his $100,000-a-year salary, to scolding
himself.
   Raiford said the accidental firing occurred after he cleaned his
two guns in preparation for later target practice.

<HEAD>Gasoline Additive Spill Causes Waterway Closing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,500 gallons of a lightweight
petroleum distillate spilled into a busy waterway between New York
and New Jersey this morning, closing it to traffic, officials said.
   The liquid, naphtha, has the consistency of lighter fluid and
was expected to evaporate rapidly, said Lt. Cmdr. Paul Milligan at
Coast Guard headquarters on Governor's Island, N.Y.
   ``It will probably dissipate quicker than we can get equipment
to clean it up,'' Milligan said. ``We may just let the environment
handle itself, just let it evaporate.''
   A three-mile section of the Arthur Kill waterway was closed at
6:45 a.m. but reopened before noon.
   Reports indicated the spill was not harming two bird sanctuaries
in the area, Milligan said.
   The additive, called naphtha, spewed into the waterway when a
gasket blew out as workers at the General American Tank Storage
Terminal in Carteret pressurized pipelines in preparing to load a
vessel.
   ``Apparently they had a bad seal and it blew out,'' Milligan
said.
   The waterway was hit Jan. 1-2 by a spill from a break in an
Exxon pipeline that leaked 567,000 gallons of heating oil.

   The once glittering hilltop of
Ashrafiyeh, home to some of the oldest and richest Christian
families, smoldered Friday as rival Christian forces battled for
control of the district.
   Fighting in various sectors of the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave killed 11 people and wounded 29 on Friday, police said.
   The battle over the enclave, a mere 10th of Lebanon, has killed
866 people and wounded 2,354 since it broke out Jan. 30 between
army units under Gen. Michel Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia
run by Samir Geagea.
   Shells opened gaping holes in the residential buildings of
Ashrafiyeh, a militia stronghold. Smoke billowed from apartments as
explosions echoed across the city.
   A 130mm howitzer shell fired by Aoun's gunners scored a direct
hit on a militia ammunition depot in the Karantina port district,
police said. The area at the base of Ashrafiyah's hills is near
Geagea's shell-shattered war council headquarters.
   The hit ignited a huge fire and a chain of powerful explosions.
A cloud of smoke hung over the district.
   Thick smoke also billowed from the district's coastal strip,
controlled by Geagea's militiamen, as well as from the wooded
slopes of the Aoun-held Metn province northeast of the capital.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said the two sides hammered each other at the rate of
10 shells a minute at times.
   Firefighters ventured out despite the intensity of the shelling
to combat the blazes in Ashrafiyeh and other areas.
   Sixteen cease-fires have been called since Jan. 30, when Aoun
made his first move against Geagea. The truces have been worked out
by a three-man Christian mediation committee and Maronite Catholic
clergymen headed by Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir.
   Geagea has proposed handing his garrisons over to the 22,000
predominantly Moslem troops loyal to President Elias Hrawi. Aoun
refuses to recognize Hrawi's authority.
   The president was elected in November under terms of an Arab
League-brokered accord intended to end Lebanon's 15-year-old civil
war. Aoun refuses to accept the accord because it does not include
a timetable for the withdrawal from Lebanon of Syrian troops.
   A government source, speaking on condition of anonymity,
stressed that ``the government will not send its troops into the
enclave to become a party to the present conflict.''

<HEAD>Man Stabbed While Walking With Baby; Palestinian Shot to Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Jewish man wheeling his son in a baby
carriage was stabbed in the back Friday by an Arab in Jerusalem's
Old City, police said. In the Gaza Strip, soldiers shot to death a
Palestinian teen-ager, hospital officials said.
   The stabbing victim was identified as Danny Robbins, 35. He was
hospitalized in fair condition.
   Robbins told police he was walking to the grocery store when he
was attacked. The bearded Robbins was wearing a Jewish skullcap
when attacked.
   Police Inspector Rahamim Comfort said Robbins pulled out a
pistol and fired three times in the air to summon police.
   Robbins was pushing his 1-year-old son in a carriage when he was
assaulted, police said. The stroller overturned but the child was
unhurt.
   Robbins is a seminary student who lives with a small community
of Jews in the Moslem Quarter. Jewish efforts to buy property and
move into the quarter have created tensions in the area.
   Police at the scene said the attacker was a Palestinian and the
assault apparently was politically motivated.
   Police briefly closed the gates to the Old City, and Israel army
radio said more than 170 Palestinians were detained for questioning.
   Robbins complained on Israel radio that no one tried to stop the
assailant.
   ``They saw him, they saw him very well, but nobody tried to
chase him,'' Robbins said.
   ``He was not armed except for the knife that remained in my
back,'' Robbins added.
   Radio reports said an Arab doctor gave Robbins first aid, but
Robbins said he received no care until an ambulance arrived.
   There have been several stabbings of Jews in the Old City during
the 27-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation.
Another Jewish seminary student was stabbed in the Moslem Quarter
last September. He recovered from his wounds.
   The clash in the Gaza Strip occurred outside the Great Mosque in
Khan Yunis. Soldiers said it was a hotbed of uprising activity and
welded it shut Wednesday.
   Arab reporters said Palestinian youths gathered outside the
closed building to pray Friday, the Islamic holy day, and a
stone-throwing confrontation with troops broke out.
   The victim was identified as Ali Suleiman Urbiya, 17, of the
Khan Yunis refugee camp. Officials at Nasser Hospital in Khan Yunis
said he was hit with a single bullet in the chest.
   Hospital officials said six other Palestinians were treated for
wounds from rubber-coated steel balls.
   An army spokesman confirmed there was an incident in Khan Yunis
but had no details.
   The death raised to 673 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians since the revolt against Israeli
occupation began in December 1987.
   An additional 202 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty-three
Israelis have been slain in the uprising violence.

sell ``The Swimming Hole,'' a painting by 19th century American
artist Thomas Eakins, a newspaper reported.
   The painting, which was purchased for $700 in 1925, could bring
millions of dollars at auction.
   Owned by the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, the painting of
six nude men and a dog has been on loan to the nearby Amon Carter
Museum since January 1988.
   Carter Museum director Jan Keene Muhlert said Wednesday the
painting was removed from display on Monday for shipment to New
York.
   An auction date of May 24 has been set at Sotheby's in New York,
sources told The Dallas Morning News.
   Modern Art Museum director E.A. Carmean Jr. would not comment on
the reported sale.
   Eakins is regarded as one of the most important 19th century
American painters.

   Soviet border guards today refused Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato entry into Lithuania, which has been locked in a
war of wills with the Kremlin since the Baltic republic declared
independence.
   After being turned away at the small border crossing in
northeast Poland, D'Amato denounced what he called the Soviet
Union's ``psychological warfare'' on Lithuania, whose Parliament
approved the independence declaration March 11.
   D'Amato wanted to enter Lithuania on a Lithuanian visa to
demonstrate what he called Congress's solidarity with the republic.
Instead, the New York Republican, who was invited to the capital of
Vilnius by Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, was
instructed to apply for a Soviet visa at a consulate.
   ``The sooner the United States wakes up to what is taking place
and becomes realistic, the better,'' D'Amato told reporters at the
border crossing.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev says one thing and does another. He talks about
freedom and yet denies access to a free country. That is wrong.''
   D'Amato flew to Poland on Thursday, planning to challenge the
Soviet land blockade of Lithuania.
   Accompanied by Lithuania's foreign minister, Algrinas Saudragis,
D'Amato and a half dozen aides traveled by chartered bus the 200
miles from Warsaw to Ogrodniki, Lithuania's only direct border
opening to the outside world.
   They arrived at the crossing on a country road around 2 p.m.
today, and Polish soldiers let them pass the first barrier on the
Polish side.
   But another 100 yards down the road they came to a red-and-white
barrier marking the Lithuanian frontier and guarded by Soviet KGB
troops.
   Through an interpreter speaking Lithuanian, D'Amato asked Soviet
Maj. Vitas Buchis for permission to enter the country. Buchis, a
native Lithuanian serving in the Soviet border force, said he had
to check by telephone with Moscow.
   After returning, Buchis told D'Amato that passage was forbidden.
``I am sorry but rules are rules. I am just following orders,'' he
said.
   Saudragis then crossed into Lithuania alone.
   Extending his arm to D'Amato's across the frontier, Saudragis
said: ``We shake hands over this border that divides us. But your
support is strengthening our spirit.''
   He also thanked the United States for never recognizing the
forced incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   The Soviet government since Tuesday has closed the Ogrodniki
crossing to most traffic, permitting only Polish and Soviet
citizens to use it to return home.
   Even in normal times, citizens of other countries are not
allowed to pass the pair of wooden gates on the narrow rural road.
The main international crossing between Poland and the Soviet Union
is about 95 miles to the south, at Brest in the Soviet Byelorussian
Republic.
   On Thursday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of
D'Amato's trip: ``We're always concerned about members of Congress
and others getting too involved in foreign policy. But on the other
hand, he is a senator who has an important message to deliver. He
represents a broad constituency and has every right to make that
trip and deliver his message.''
   Congressmen, including D'Amato, have been urging President Bush
to give Lithuania more support. Some U.S. politicians have
suggested sanctions if force is used against the republic.
   D'Amato is the junior Republican on the Senate Intelligence
Committee and also serves on the Appropriations Subcomittee on
foreign operations. He is not considered one of the Senate's
leading voices on foreign relations.
   Before he left Wednesday, D'Amato tried to deflect suggestions
that the trip was designed to counteract problems at home.
D'Amato's public opinion ratings have slipped dramatically since
the Senate Ethics Committee began looking into allegations he used
his influence to steer federal Housing and Urban Development money
to friends and political supporters.
   ``Now, if every time I do something that's not associated with
HUD, you're going to say `Oh, you're doing that because it's not
associated with HUD,' that's silly,'' he told reporters Wednesday.

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire swept through a residential hotel
this morning, killing at least three people, injuring 18 and
sending scores of mostly elderly residents running into the street,
officials said.
   Fifteen people were unaccounted-for after the 3 a.m. fire at the
Fontana Hotel was brought under control in about five hours, said
Assistant Fire Chief John Reed. The hotel is on famed Collins
Avenue north of the beach's trendy art deco district.
   ``It was incredible,'' said one resident, Joe Marcello, who
jumped to safety from a second-floor window. ``Flames were shooting
40 feet in the air.''
   Mayor Alex Daoud said the intensity of the three-alarm fire led
investigators to suspect arson, but fire officials said the report
was speculative.
   ``We have all the fire units of the city of Miami Beach working
on the fire, attempting to get it under control,'' police Detective
Jim Hyde said earlier. ``This is definitely the worst I've seen.''
   Up to 200 residents of the three-story Fontana Hotel and 175 to
200 in the adjacent Prince Michael Hotel, which was threatened for
a time, were evacuated, police said.
   By early afternoon, authorities were conducting a room-to-room
search of the burned building and checking crowds outside the
hotel, hospitals and a community center to narrow the list of
missing tenants.
   Residents said the fire broke out near the elevator shaft in the
front of the Fontana, and Hyde said the two bodies were found in
the lobby area. He put the number of people injured at 18.
   ``They're not able to get inside yet _ it'll be all gone,''
police Sgt. Jim Scarberry said three hours into the fire.
   Many of the residents were elderly and infirm, according to
Myrtle Jackson, 35, a yearly tenant on the second floor of the
Fontana. She said she escaped out the back door after the
building's managers ran through the hallways knocking on doors.
   Ms. Jackson said the smoke was too thick and there was no chance
to help anyone else _ ``no time to be a hero tonight.''
   Marcello, her roommate, said he heard his smoke alarm, which was
installed to comply with a city ordinance requiring an electronic
alarm in every hotel room.
   But he said he didn't realize the situation was serious until
Olimpia Mihai, one of the owner-managers, started knocking on
doors. By the time he gathered his passport and other papers, he
said the hallway was too smoky to risk escape down the stairs.
   ``I started panicking. I ran back to my room and knocked the
window out and just jumped down,'' said Marcello, 32. ``When I dove
out the building, there were four cars engulfed in flames.''
   He said another second-floor resident broke her window, dropped
her baby to a man on the ground and jumped out herself.
   About five hours after the blaze began, the building's roof had
collapsed and burning cinders showered down from the remnants of
the roof.
   Smoke arched hundreds of feet in the early morning sky,
partially obscuring oceanfront condominiums.
   Long-time residents said the hotel housed between 100 and 200
residents, most of whom rented by the week, month or year. A few
vacationers also were believed in the building when the fire broke
out. The American Red Cross was busing scores of residents to a
nearby shelter.
   Spokeswomen at St. Francis, Mount Sinai and South Shore
hospitals said 18 people were taken to their emergency rooms, and
four were expected to be admitted. Many were suffering from burns
and smoke inhalation.
   ``I have all people who have lost everything in the fire,
including their medication, so we're treating them for whatever
there individual needs are,'' said South Shore emergency room
supervisor Carol Perlaza.

<TEXT>
   Attorney General Jim Mattox, who has been
harassing his Democratic runoff opponent with claims she used
drugs, today flatly denied claims by two men that they saw him
smoking marijuana in the 1970s.
   Mattox, the attorney general, vigorously denied reports today in
Dallas and Houston newspapers.
   ``I'll tell them that they are liars to their faces,'' he said
at a news conference.
   Mattox has criticized election opponent Ann Richards for
refusing to answer yes or no when asked if she ever used an illegal
drug, and has accused her of smoking marijuana in the 1970s. He
said he was willing to take a lie detector test to dispute the
allegations about him.
   ``I will,'' he said. ``And I want you to get Ms. Richards
strapped in beside me when we do it.''
   Houston lawyer Jim Sharp and former Dallas police officer Edward
H. Lowe signed affidavits that they saw Mattox smoke marijuana on
separate occasions.
   Lowe said he saw Mattox smoke marijuana in a Dallas apartment
during an undercover investigation in the early 1970s, when Mattox
was a Dallas lawyer. He said he didn't arrest Mattox because he was
investigating a separate matter.
   Sharp said Mattox and he shared a marijuana cigarette in 1974
while in a car after the Democratic state convention in Austin.
   ``I've never used any marijuana or dangerous drugs, period,''
Mattox said about the accusations, which Sharp and Lowe made in the
Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News.
   The incidents the two men described ``absolutely did not take
place,'' Mattox said today.
   ``I've never been in a car where there has ever been any
marijuana smoked, by me or anybody else,'' Mattox said.
   The drug use issue first was presented at a debate before the
March 13 primary. Mattox and former Gov. Mark White denied ever
using illegal drugs, but Ms. Richards, the state treasurer, refused
to answer the question.
   Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, later said she has not had
an alcoholic drink or a mood-altering chemical since leaving an
alcohol recovery program in 1980.
   The issue has dominated the Democratic campaign, particularly
since the primary that vaulted Mattox and Ms. Richards into the
runoff. Mattox has said a former drug user could not effectively
lead the state's efforts to end illegal drug use.
   Ms. Richards has not accused Mattox of drug use.
   Earlier this week, Mattox said he had affidavits signed by
people who saw Ms. Richards use drugs in the 1970s. But he has
refused to release the documents, citing the confidentiality of the
people who made the allegations.
   On Thursday, The Houston Post quoted a woman it didn't identify
as saying she had seen Ms. Richards in a restroom with other women
who appeared to be smoking marijuana at an Austin convention in
1979.
   The Dallas Morning News, in today's editions, said the same
woman confirmed her allegation in a polygraph examination paid for
by the paper.
   ``I have no idea what they're talking about,'' Ms. Richards said.

   Thieves made off with an entire house,
right down to the kitchen sink, and police are red-faced because
they provided an escort.
   Murray D. Ladner, owner of Young's House Movers of Pass
Christian, owns the 14-by-20-foot cottage and had planned to move
it Thursday.
   ``The cottage had been jacked up on blocks and was ready to
go,'' said Ladner, who is in the hospital recovering from back
surgery. ``But when my brother-in-law took the equipment there to
haul it away, it was gone.''
   Ladner said it was taken late last week.
   ``I bought three of the cottages and had already sold two and
moved them to new locations,'' Ladner said. ``This was the last and
the lady who bought it was expecting it to be delivered Thursday
afternoon. She was really surprised when I called and told her what
had happened.
   ``She said, `You mean, it's been stolen?'''
   Ladner said he was surprised the theft went so smoothly.
   ``They had to have a permit for the police to escort them,'' he
said. ``So apparently, they used an old moving permit, whited out
the old stuff and put in new.''
   Police Chief George Payne confirmed that officers had escorted
the house out of town, and said the case was under investigation.
   Ladner said he suspects who the culprits are and has given their
names to the police.
   ``People are really going to be surprised when they find out who
took it,'' he said. ``They must be crazy because they know I know.
They're already in enough trouble.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Group Says Three Europeans Will be Freed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A radical Palestinian group led by
terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal said today that preparations were
under way to free at least three French and Belgian hostages it
holds.
   The group said in a statement that the action was in response to
an appeal by Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   ``I am pleased to announce the acceptance of our movement in
response to (Gadhafi's) appeal,'' Walid Khaled, Beirut spokesman
for Fatah-Revolutionary Council, said in a statement issued in
Beirut.
   ``I am also pleased to declare that the contacts and
arrangements under way now include Mrs. Jacqueline Valente, her
boyfriend, Fernand Houtekins, and their baby, Sony Houtekins.''
   The statement, delivered to the offices of a Western news
agency, added that the group ``hopes that this will draw the
attention of the Belgian government that it should fulfill its
pledges ... and curb Zionist activities against the revolution of
our people.''
   On Thursday, Abu Nidal's group said an effort was under way to
free at least one of the hostages it holds.
   The group has acknowledged holding Valente, a 32-year-old French
woman; her two daughters born in captivity; and five Belgians. The
previously reported names of the two girls were Liberte and
Palestine.
   On Wednesday, Gadhafi called for the release of Ms. Valente as a
compassionate measure on the occasion of the Moslem holy month of
Ramadan, which ends in late April. Gadhafi's call was carried by
the official Libyan news agency JANA.
   Abu Nidal is backed by Libya and believed to be living in
Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council said on Nov. 8, 1987, that it had
seized the hostages aboard the French yacht Silco off the Gaza
Strip. It claimed they were collaborating with Israel's Mossad
secret service. But friends denied the charge and said the hostages
were Roman Catholics on a holiday cruise.
   Because the boat hostages are believed to be in Libya they are
not listed among the 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon, including
eight Americans. Most of them are believed to be held by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem factions.
   American journalist Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, is the longest-held Western
hostage. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   Two other daughters of Ms. Valente were freed after Libyan
intervention on Dec. 29, 1988. Daughter Marie-Laure was 6 at the
time, and Virginie, 5. They were returned to their father, Pascal
Betille, who had divorced Ms. Valente.
   The Belgians are Emmanuel Houtekins, in his 40s; his wife,
Godlieve Kets, age unknown; his son, Laurent, in his late teens;
his daughter, Valerie, a teen-ager; and his brother Fernand, in his
40s.

<HEAD>Thai Fishermen Kill and Kidnap Vietnamese Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>

   Thai fishermen armed with knives
and iron rods attacked a boat carrying 191 refugees from Vietnam,
stabbing to death three refugees and kidnapping six of the women,
U.N. officials said Friday.
   Eleven other refugees were missing and presumed drowned, said
the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
   It was the first known case this year of piracy against boat
people off Malaysia's coast.
   The U.N. statement faxed to The Associated Press said that of
the 191 boat people, only 171 escaped. They had left Camau, in the
southern tip of Vietnam, on April 1 and were attacked the following
day, the statement said.
   Those who escaped reached an American Exxon oil rig off the
Trengganu coast in the South China Sea on April 3, the U.N. agency
said.
   They were in a refugee camp awaiting resettlement.
   The statement did not identify the pirates, but officials said
information given by the refugees identified the attackers as Thai
fishermen.
   The incident ``underlines once again the importance of granting
safe haven as soon as possible to Vietnamese asylum seekers in
accord with all humanitarian and maritime obligations,'' the U.N.
High Commissioner said in its statement.
   According to the account provided by the U.N. group, the pirates
were in four boats. One pulled up alongside the Vietnamese vessel
and offered the refugees ice and water. The other boats then
approached from different directions and surrounded the targeted
vessel.
   Three men armed with knives boarded and took watches, jewelry,
money and the boat's compass. They attempted to abduct a
20-year-old female. When she resisted, one of them stabbed her to
death and threw her body into the sea.
   At that point, six or seven men with knives, iron rods and
hacksaws boarded the Vietnamese boat and began looting it. They
threw all the food overboard, took the battery and most of the
fuel, then abducted six women and left.
   One boat later returned and rammed the Vietnamese boat at full
speed, causing 20 to 30 people to fall overboard. At least two
Vietnamese were stabbed to death when they attempted to grab on the
ropes hanging down from the pirate's boat.
   The survivors managed to start up their battered boat again and
steered it in the direction of the oil platform, which could be
seen in the distance.
   The last major piracy attack on the boat people off the
Malaysian coast occured in August 1989. Seventy-one people drowned
when pirates looted and sank their boat. Thirteen survivors were
picked up by Exxon boats.

   Margaret Polk, the ``Memphis Belle'' whose
romance with a B-17 bomber pilot became a celebrated World War II
love story, has died of cancer. She was 67.
   Ms. Polk died Thursday at her home.
   Robert K. Morgan, who was widely credited with being the first
B-17 pilot complete 25 missions over Nazi-occupied Europe, named
the plane ``Memphis Belle'' in honor of Ms. Polk.
   The romance generated international headlines and helped the War
Department when Morgan began a war-bonds tour in 1943.
   He said his long separation from Ms. Polk during the tour cooled
the relationship.
   ``She was a courageous lady, and I'd like for her to be
remembered as an upbeat person who never had a bad word for
anybody,'' said Morgan, now 69, of Asheville, N.C.
   After the romance ended, Ms. Polk returned to college and later
became an airline flight attendant.
   A 1946 inheritance from her father left Ms. Polk independently
wealthy and she devoted much of her time to working with alcoholics
and raising funds for the preservation and restoration of the
plane, which is now a Mud Island tourist attraction.
   A memorial service will be held Saturday.

   Police opened fire on 200,000
pro-democracy demonstrators marching toward the royal palace today,
and at least 35 people were killed, witnesses said.
   At least nine more people were killed in clashes with police
during similar demonstrations in other parts of the country,
witnesses said.
   The violence occurred immediately after King Birendra dismissed
the government and promised talks with pro-democracy activists.
   Opposition leaders rejected the offer and vowed to continue
their nearly 2-month-old struggle for a multiparty political system.
   In Katmandu, the capital, bands of angry protesters calling for
greater democracy in this Himalayan monarchy tried to set fire to
government buildings and the houses of politicians loyal to King
Birendra.
   Gunshots and automatic weapons fire echoed throughout the city.
   At sundown, the city was plunged into darkness as an
opposition-planned blackout took effect. Clouds of tear gas fogged
the streets.
   Soldiers holding automatic weapons were seen patrolling in
trucks and on foot.
   The mostly deserted streets were littered with bricks, shoes and
slipper, and there were piles of burning tires.
   In Washington, the State Department urged Nepal to restore calm
without further violence. ``The U.S. government deplores the deaths
which have occurred and the violence which has taken place,'' said
spokesman Mark Dillon.
   ``The United States urgently calls on the government of Nepal to
exercise restraint in restoring order,'' Dillon said. ``As a step
toward this goal we urge that a dialogue with opposition leaders
begin immediately.''
   Witnesses said police first shot tear gas and beat demonstrators
with sticks when they came within 500 yards of the royal palace.
The protesters were waving flags and chanting anti-government
slogans.
   When that failed to turn back the protesters, police opened
fire. One witness said he saw at least 200 demonstrators fall to
the ground, but accounts of the number of casualties varied.
   Another witness, speaking from a hotel in the city's center,
said he saw 35 corpses at Bir Hospital, the city's largest.
   ``There are hundreds more wounded. It's a bloody mess,'' said
the witness, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A doctor at Bir Hospital, who also spoke on condition of
anonymity, said a British man was among the dead. He also said
another British man and a Dutch man were among the wounded. Their
identities were not released pending notification of relatives.
There was no immediate word on American casualties.
   Doctors at Bir Hospital and at the Teaching Hospital said they
had a total of 9 bodies and 150 wounded people. But they charged
that soldiers had been carting away corpses from the city.
   ``Bodies were in taken trucks for disposal by the army,'' said
the doctor at Bir Hospital. ``At least 200 to 300 people must have
died.''
   Another witness contacted by telephone said that he saw 30 young
men gunned down as he watched the demonstration from a hotel window.
   ``The people were unarmed and the government just started
shooting,'' he said. ``A whole line of demonstrators fell.''
   He said security forces carried away some of the wounded but
others were left lying in the street.
   A Western diplomat, contacted by phone from New Delhi, said
exact casualty figures were difficult to confirm, ``but there's
been lots of bloodshed,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   In the town of Butwal, 120 miles west of Katmandu, witnesses
said security forces killed seven people and wounded scores. Two
others were killed in clashes in Pokhara, 160 miles northwest of
the capital, other witnesses said.
   Witnesses speaking from Janakpur said police fired on crowds in
that city, but there were no reports of casualties.
   King Birendra said on state-run radio today that a new
government will be formed by Lokendra Bahadur Chand, a former prime
minister regarded as more moderate toward political opposition than
former Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha.
   Prior to today's violence at least 16 people had been killed in
clashes between demonstrators and the police since the banned
Nepali Congress party and a coalition of left-wing groups began the
protests on Feb. 18.
   Hundreds of people have been arrested, and human rights
activists have charged that many detainees have been tortured.
   Birenda said Shrestha's government had failed to maintain law
and order during the 47-day-old campaign for multiparty democracy
and he promised that the new government would ``consult people
holding different political views.''
   The king also said committees would be formed to make
recommendations on constitutional reforms and investigate
accusations of police abuses against the demonstrators.
   Major opposition leaders rejected the offer and vowed to
intensify protests by the pro-democracy movement.
   ``The royal proclamation has given a slap in the face to the
countrywide call for democracy,'' the leader of the Nepali Congress
party, Ganesh Man Singh, said in a statement from his hospital bed.
   ``The people's demands can only be reflected in a multiparty
system,'' Singh said. ``Hollow consolations of reforms made in the
royal proclamation can not deter the people's aspirations.
Therefore, the people's movement will be carried on with even
greater intensity and even more extensively.''
   Singh has been under house arrest since the pro-democracy
campaign was launched by his Nepali Congress and a coalition of
left-wing groups.
   Radha Krishna Mainali, a leader of the United Left Front, also
said the king's response was inadequate.
   `The royal proclamation has not fulfilled the demands of the
people,'' Mainali said in a written statement. ``Instead of
preparing a new constitution to pave the way for a multiparty
system, there is talk, including reforms, within the previous
constitution, which is unacceptable.''
   The protesters are demanding the withdrawal of a 1961 royal
decree banning political parties and separate platforms in the
Rashtriya Panchayat, or national assembly.
   Power in Nepal is technically shared between the assembly and
the king, but the monarch nominates one-fifth of the assembly's 140
members and, according to political observers, approves the
nominations of others standing for election.
   Nepal's two-year experiment with a Western-style democracy ended
in 1961 when King Mahendra, Birendra's father, dismissed the
government of the Nepali Congress party, accusing it of corruption
and inept administration.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Launch Counteroffensive, Claim to Seize One Town</HEAD>

   Thousands of Cambodian guerrillas
launched major attacks Friday in a bid to recapture territory
seized by government forces in recent weeks, senior guerrilla
officials said.
   A spokesman for the Khmer People's National Liberation Front
said the guerrillas seized Don Noi late Friday as the
counteroffensive got under way.
   ``We have launched a large scale counteroffensive involving all
our forces,'' said Ok Serei Sopheak, a senior official of the
National Liberation Front. He said the objective was not only to
recapture lost territory but to take Sisophon, a major town in
western Cambodia.
   The front is one of three guerrilla groups allied in a loose
coalition to fight the Vietnam-backed government in Cambodia.
Others in the coalition are the communist Khmer Rouge, and
followers of the former Cambodian head of state, Prince Norodom
Sihanouk.
   The non-communist National Liberation Front is reeling from
government attacks in which it lost much of 2,000 square miles of
territory it had held since last fall.
   The embattled territory is in western Cambodia near the Thai
frontier, where the guerrilla coalition has most of its bases.
   The latest blow to the guerrillas occurred Tuesday when
government troops retook the district capital of Thmar Puok. This
town, along with Kok Mon, Sisophon and Don Noi, appear to be the
prime targets of the guerrilla counteroffensive.
   ``We will show the world that we are still strong,'' Ok Serei
Sopheak said. He said new shipments of ammunition from China in
recent days had given the guerrillas the means to retake the lost
ground.
   Thousands of civilians have fled into forests and other areas in
recent days to avoid the fighting.
   The 11-year-long Cambodian war has taken the lives of thousands
of civilians.
   Western analysts at Aranyaprathet, a key Thai border town, said
it appeared the guerrillas had ``bounced back'' from recent
defeats, but it remained to be seen whether they were disciplined
and strong enough to hold territory.
   The guerrillas claim Vietnam has sent back several thousand
troops to bolster the Phnom Penh side and that this had largely
accounted for the guerrillas' recent defeats.
   Vietnam claimed all its forces had withdrawn from Cambodia in
September, and it denys any soldiers have returned.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 to oust the Khmer Rouge
and set up a pro-Hanoi government in Phnom Penh.
   The guerrillas and independent analysts say the monsoon season,
which gets under way at the end of April, will probably give the
guerrillas a major advantage. The government employs tanks and
large artillery pieces, which will be difficult to move over
rain-soaked areas.

<TEXT>
   For the third time in less than a year,
Greece is holding an election aimed at breaking a deadlock that
left temporary coalitions running the country since the
scandal-ridden Socialists were thrown out.
   Opinion polls indicate Sunday's parliamentary election will fail
to produce a one-party government, resulting in another coalition
administration with small parties in a powerbroker's role.
   Frustration has led to violence. Leftist terrorists calling for
an election boycott have set off scores of bombs, and clashes have
erupted between conservatives and Socialists.
   The leading conservative New Democracy party led by Constantine
Mitsotakis is hoping that this time around, it will win an absolute
majority in the 300-member unicameral Parliament. It came close in
June and November elections.
   The conservatives won 146 seats in June and improved to 148
places in November, three short of a majority. The Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (PASOK) of former Prime Minister Andreas
Papandreou was a close second.
   The conservatives and the small Communist-led Coalition of the
Left and Progress teamed up after the June vote, which ousted
Papandreou after eight years in office.
   The short-lived alliance, with Mitsotakis as prime minister,
presided over the indictment of Papandreou and some of his
ministers for alleged involvement in financial scandals and illegal
wiretapping of political opponents. No trial date has been set.
   In November, another alliance comprised of the conservatives,
Socialists and Communist-dominated Coalition collapsed in February
after it was unable to confront growing economic problems or stem a
resurgence of urban terrorism.
   Prime Minister Xenophon Zolotas, 86, a former governor of the
Bank of Greece, remains caretaker until a new government is chosen.
   The country faces 17 percent inflation and a $15 billion budget
deficit. The European Community has said Greece is in danger of
bankruptcy and the EC will not bail it out because Greece violated
austerity requirements of a 1985 loan.
   Papandreou, 71, has failed to clarify his party's platform,
promising only stability and progress. Mitsotakis, also 71, pledges
private investment in the ailing economy which would create 100,000
new jobs.
   Conservatives and Socialists disagree over U.S. bases. New
Democracy says the bases and NATO membership are essential for
defense, while the Socialists say any future bases agreement should
be put to a referendum.
   Coalition leaders offered nothing new in their party platform,
renewing their often repeated pledge to protect workers' rights.
   In November's election the conservatives got 46.19 percent of
the vote, the Socialists received 40.68 percent for 128 seats and
the Coalition dropped to 10.97 percent and 21 seats. The
Environmentalist-Alternative party and two independents took the
other three seats.
   Respected pollster Panayote Dimitras expects Sunday's results
will ``more or less'' be the same as in the previous vote.
   ``I see all parties falling slightly. But the Coalition could
fall a little more because of protest votes that may go to the
Environmentalist-Alternative party or blank ballots,'' said
Dimitras.
   He said that if the Environmentalist-Alternative party, which
won one seat in the last election, gains one or two more seats,
``they could also become the key to power.''
   The collapse of communist regimes in Eastern Europe and social
reforms in the Soviet Union could also have a negative effect on
the left.
   Campaigning was low-key with more debates and interviews on
nationwide television than in past elections. Gone were the many
colorful fiestas and fireworks where each major party drew tens of
thousands of supporters at outdoor rallies.
   Urban terrorist groups claimed responsibility for scores of
bombings in an attempt to intimidate the country's 8 million voters.
   The Revolutionary Popular Struggle underground guerrilla
organization called on voters to boycott the election _ describing
it as a ``political farce.''
   Some minor clashes occurred between conservative and socialist
supporters in various parts of the country. One clash in Iraklion,
Crete, resulted in the shooting death of a socialist follower and
the wounding of four other people, including a journalist and
member of the conservative party.

   You may not be able to get borscht as fast
as you could a Big Mac at Red Square. But some customers at the
first Soviet-American fast-food eatery in this country just love
the piroshkis.
   Others are wondering ``Where's the beef?''
   ``I had to come and try it,'' said Robert Foxhall of Chesapeake.
``I always try to eat a different variety of food. This is
wonderful ethnic fare.''
   Foxhall left the stand at the Waterside Festival Marketplace
with a dozen piroshkis _ which look like elongated egg rolls _ for
co-workers at his office.
   Danny Crocker of Norfolk found the piroshkis a bit greasy, but
``so are french fries and I love french fries.''
   In January, McDonald's opened its first franchise in the Soviet
Union and is serving up to 50,000 people a day. The restaurant
here, named Piroshkis, a joint venture between Soviet and American
investors, opened this week on the Norfolk waterfront.
   The Soviet partner is Tomak-Kiev. Mark Aynbinder, a Soviet
emigre and president of the American partners, described the
company as the largest Soviet manufacturer of food processing
equipment.
   Local officials and Aynbinder say the joint-venture is the first
of its kind in the United States between investors from the two
countries in recent memory. The U.S. Department of Commerce said
they had no records to indicate otherwise.
   The eatery was established in Norfolk partly because sailors
from Soviet navy ships that visited last summer got a warm welcome
from the community. Also, Aynbinder initiated contacts with friends
in the Ukrainian city of Kiev that got the venture off the ground.
   Piroshkis takes its name from the staple finger food of the
Soviet Union. It is a pastry stuffed with potatoes and mushrooms,
or beef and rice, or jam, or beef and fish, and deep fried.
   The restaurant also offers Russian pancakes, Russian donuts,
Russian coffee and Russian tea.
   Ellen Landrum of Norfolk said she came to try the fare out of
curiosity.
   ``Well, there wasn't enough beef in the piroshki. But the
pancakes are good and the tea is wonderful,'' she said.
   She said the service tended to follow a Russian stereotype. ``It
was a little bit slow and I thought I had to wait longer than I
ought,'' she said.
   The 600-square-foot stall is on one end of a food court where
vendors also sell seafood, gourmet coffee, ice cream, barbecue,
hamburgers, and Chinese, Filipino, Mexican and Italian dishes.
   Piroshkis had more than its share of customers.
   E.W. Michaels of Norfolk polished off four piroshkis and
announced himself satisfied. ``One of the nice things about this
country is that we have a touch of everything,'' he said. ``I'll
never get to Russia. It's nice to know about other things, other
people.''
   The Russian accents behind the counter piqued the curiosity of
many customers. Several Russian technicians minded the piroshki-,
pancake- and donut-making equipment. The Soviet investors provided
the equipment; the Americans market the franchise and the
equipment. The technicians are here to train American employees.
   Luba and Igor Stefnek waited on customers and fielded as many
questions about Russian lifestyle as they did orders.
   Not all the customers gave glowing reviews. Four-year-old Janae
Smith of Portsmouth made a sour face after she ate a beef and rice
piroshki. Her mother, Della Smith, said Janae was not big on
anything new.
   Asked to compare Russian fast food to American, customers at the
new restaurant were divided.
   Ms. Landrum and Foxhall said they stay away from American fast
food, but would return to Piroshkis. But Janae was adamantly a
McDonald's fan.
   Crocker said he, too, would return, but ``hamburgers are still
Number One. When I visited friends in Germany, I had to go looking
for a hamburger after three weeks. A man has to have his
hamburger.''

   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher called Friday for a ``new Atlantic partnership'' of North
American and European democracies to forge ``one Europe from the
Atlantic to the Urals.''
   ``It would involve the United States in the building of the
common European house,'' Genscher said in a speech to the American
Society of Newspaper Editors.
   Speaking in English, Genscher said, ``We don't want Germany to
pursue unity alone. We don't want the country to be neutralized but
to be tied to Europe's fate.''
   In an interview conducted in German after the speech, the
foreign minister was asked about Secretary of State James A. Baker
III's announcement that the Soviet Union is dropping its demand
that a reunified Germany be neutralized.
   Baker, who has been meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister
Shevardnadze, said the Soviets continue to resist the inclusion of
a united Germany in the North Atlantic alliance.
   Genscher was asked whether Baker's statement enhanced the
likelihood of a single Germany becoming a member of NATO.
   He said he thought it was premature to assess the U.S.-Soviet
talks but that what he had heard so far ``confirms the impression''
he received last month when he met with Shevardnadze in Windhoek,
Namibia.
   He said his impression was ``that the Soviet Union is taking a
constructive position or attitude both toward the building of a
future Europe ... and also to German reunificiation, which they
view as a law-abiding procedure.''
   In his speech, Genscher said, ``I call upon the North American
democracies and the members of the European Community to issue a
joint declaration heralding a new Atlantic partnership, a
declaration encompassing all the political, economic, technological
and cultural aspects of our relationship and capable of meeting the
challenges confronting mankind.
   ``That would not only be beneficial to the members of the
European Community and the North Atlantic democracies. It would
also enhance world stability and be an asset to all nations in
Europe, for such a future-oriented transatlantic partnership would
help to overcome the division of Europe and to create one Europe
from the Atlantic to the Urals,'' he said.
   Genscher said, ``it makes a lot of sense'' for President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to meet, even if that
happens before an arms control agreement is reached.
   ``In a very rapidly changing world, direct talks between the two
superpowers are of decisive importance,'' said Genscher.
   Bush on Thursday scheduled his second summit with Gorbachev for
May 30 to June 3.
   Genscher said the Bush-Gorbachev summit in Malta last year ``has
greatly contributed to the improvement of East-West relations'' and
``I am assuming that this will also be the case for the next summit
conference.''
   He said such a meeting could help pave the way for a meeting of
the 35 signatories of the Helsinki Pact, which he hopes will be
held in November and approve German reunification.

   Defenseless for almost 18 months, Gen.
James E. Oglethorpe will soon get another sword. This time, city
leaders want one that can't be easily stolen from the statue of
Georgia's founding father.
   Vandals are believed responsible for the disappearance of the
original sword from the statue in 1988.
   The city's purchasing department is about to begin legal
advertising for bids to cast a 3-foot-10-inch replacement. Nearly
$6,000 has been set aside for the project.
   ``It will probably take 90 days to get the bid awarded,'' said
Billy Jones, streets and drainage director for the city and
supervisor of the replacement project.
   To prevent another theft, the bid specifications say, the
material attaching the sword to the statue should be stronger than
the blade material, meaning a vandal would have to break the sword
to remove it.
   The statue at Chippewa Square was sculpted in 1910 by Daniel
Chester French, who also did the Lincoln statue in the Lincoln
Memorial. Park and Tree Director Don Gardner said the city is
looking at world-class bronze casters, including Moreland Studios
of New Jersey, which handled the renovation of the Statue of
Liberty.
   ``If it's good enough for the Statue of Liberty, it's good
enough for us,'' Gardner said.

   Seven members of a House Armed Services
subcommittee will travel to East Asia to consider alternatives to
U.S. military bases in the Philippines, the panel said Friday.
   The delegation from the subcommittee on military installations
and facilities leaves Saturday for Hawaii, Guam, Thailand and
Indonesia for a 10-day trip.
   The trip also includes an examination of U.S. security
responsibilities in the region and the lawmakers plan to visit
Vietnam and Cambodia to assess the extent to the which the Soviet
Union has reduced its forces at Cam Rahn Bay.
   The United States and the Philippines are scheduled to begin
negotiations on two U.S. facilities in the Philippines _ Clark Air
Base and Subic Bay Naval Base.
   Philippine officials have criticized the current arrangement and
urged President Corazon Aquino to end the U.S. rights. Earlier this
year, Mrs. Aquino refused to meet with Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney who visited the Philippines as part of an Asian trip.
   ``With reduced East-West tensions and an increased American
debt, it may be time to pack up and leave the Philippines,'' said
Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., chairwoman of the subcommittee.
   ``On this mission, we hope to find out whether the impact of
such a departure can be minimized.''
   Schroeder said that some in the Philippines are demanding that
the United States pay $2 billion a year in rent for the bases,
``nearly the amount that the citizens of Colorado pay in state
taxes.''
   In addition to Schroeder, the delegation includes Reps. David
O'B. Martin, R-N.Y., the ranking GOP member on the subcommittee;
Norman Sisisky, D-Va.; Jim Courter, R-N.J.; James Hansen, R-Utah;
Larry Hopkins, R-Ky.; and congressional delegate Ben Blaz, R-Guam.

   In one vision of 21st-century Detroit, people
would be able to ride cable cars across the Detroit River to
Windsor, Ontario, or stroll to work through enclosed skywalks.
   The plan, unveiled Wednesday, would turn empty shops to fancy
apartments, extend an elevated rail system and reclaim blighted
neighborhoods.
   ``We've got a lot of lofty ideas in there, but how you carry
them out is another question,'' said City Planner Harold Smith.
   Mayor Coleman A. Young's planning department and the city
planning commission have traded drafts on a master plan since 1973,
only agreeing on the latest.
   The plan would relocate residents of largely abandoned
neighborhoods and raze buildings so the land could be offered to
developers. It also calls for creating jobs by helping steel
industries, and re-establishing Detroit as a recording industry
center.
   Planners also envision a fashion district much like New York's
Seventh Avenue along Detroit's Seven Mile Road, reviving of a
former ``Avenue of Fashion.''
   Smith said most of the ideas depend on finding developers and
money.

   The Soviet Union today withdrew its demand
that a reunified Germany be neutral and Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze predicted ``very important documents will be signed''
at next month's superpower summit.
   But Shevardnadze and the White House acknowledged it may not be
possible to resolve all major provisions of a new treaty to reduce
long-range nuclear weapons before the arrival of President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev on May 30.
   ``There are very technical issues that need to be resolved,''
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty that would cut the most dangerous U.S. and Soviet
nuclear arms.
   Shevardnadze predicted a wide range of agreements at Bush's
Washington summit with Gorbachev. But he, too, cautioned that ``it
will take an additional effort'' to settle on ways to cut
long-range nuclear missiles in time to be initialed by the two
leaders at the summit.
   Also, Soviet actions in breakaway Lithuania continued to mar the
U.S.-Soviet relationship. Fitzwater said the superpower
relationship is ``at stake in this matter.''
   Shevardnadze took a conciliatory stance on issues surrounding
the unification of East Germany, a Soviet ally, with West Germany,
the linchpin in Europe of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``We have to look for a solution, a solution that would be
acceptable'' to both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, Shevardnadze said.
He could not provide a specific blueprint, he said, but added: ``It
is possible we will be able to find a mutally acceptable'' solution.
   Earlier, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the Soviets
had eased off their demand that the merged Germany be neutral but
continued to object to its membership in NATO.
   ``This summit certainly will become a major event in world
affairs,'' Shevardnadze told reporters. ``The two presidents will
sign very important documents.''
   Fitzwater said Bush had underscored to Shevardnadze that the
United States did not recognize the Soviets' incorporation of
Lithuania in 1940 and that the Kremlin should not take actions to
block the Baltic republic's assertion of independence.
   The foreign minister delivered a letter to Bush from Gorbachev
that dealt with arms control, Fitzwater said, declining to provide
any details.
   He called the two-hour session ``cordial and productive.''
   Shevardnadze, standing under an umbrella in a rain-swept
driveway, told reporters agreements in preparation deal with arms
control, trade relations, cooperation in science and space.
   Shevardnadze said ``we have a clear conscience'' on Lithuania.
Defending Moscow's tactics in dealing with the independence
movement, he said it was important to maintain order in the midst
of possible ``inter-ethnic clashes.''.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviets were willing to implement an
agreement for direct flights of Jewish refugees to Israel provided
Israel gave assurances they would not be settled ``in the occupied
territories.''
   On Thursday night a Soviet official specified that means East
Jerusalem as well as the West Bank and Gaza.
   Shevardnadze also held out the prospect of resuming normal
diplomatic ties with Israel after a 23-year lapse _ depending on
``the overall Middle East situation.''
   The Soviets have consistently demanded that Israel hold
negotiations to create a Palestinian state and relinquish all the
land the Arabs lost in the 1967 six-day war. That would include the
West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights.
   Shevardnadze's White House session with Bush ran twice as long
as initially planned. ``This talk was not only rather lengthy but
also rather substantive,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Baker said earlier that Shevardnadze had not agreed to the
proposal for direct emigre flights to Israel. But the Soviet
official did say ``that they would be willing to give it some
consideration,'' Baker said.
   On the subject of German reunification, Baker said he believes
the Soviets have concluded that a neutral country is ``not the best
route to go.''
   ``A unified Germany as part of NATO presented a problem to
them,'' said Baker, who has been meeting with his Soviet
counterpart since Wednesday.
   ``We were equally firm in our view that the unified Germany must
remain a member of NATO and that that would indeed provide
stability, which is, after all, one of the major results that we
all seek from the unification of Germany,'' Baker said.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher has proposed
keeping NATO troops from entering what is now East Germany even
though the merged country is part of the Western alliance.
   Genscher told reporters after an address to the American Society
of Newspaper Editors, ``what I have heard so far confirms the
impression of my talks with Foreign Minister Shevardnadze in
Windhoek, namely that the Soviet Union is taking a constructive
position or attitude both toward the building of a future Europe
... and also to German unification, which they view as a
law-abiding process.'' Genscher and Sheverdnadaze met in Windhoek,
Namibia, last month.
   Despite some tough Soviet actions in the Baltics, Bush on
Thursday scheduled his second summit with Gorbachev for May 30 to
June 3. Fitzwater said the president would express his concerns
``forcefully and directly'' to the Soviet leader.
   Baker said Shevardnadze has been consistent throughout the talks
in declaring that the preferred Soviet approach to the independence
crisis in Lithuania is dialogue, ``and that they would like to see
this resolved through peaceful means and that they rejected the
concept of use of force.''
   Bush said Thursday that the summit would provide ``time for a
lot of dialogue and a lot of discussion.''
   Officials acknowledged that in the weeks remaining until May 30
it will be difficult to forge agreements across the board of
U.S.-Soviet relations.
   The Bush-Gorbachev meeting had been expected to be held in late
June. The earlier date shortened the time left to find ways to
assist the sluggish Soviet economy.
   The Soviets must enact a law guaranteeing a right to emigrate
and negotiators must complete a new trade agreement for Moscow to
qualify for U.S. trade concessions. U.S. officials said this still
could be done by the time Gorbachev comes to Washington.

   The chairman of the Pepper Commisssion
defended on Friday its refusal to include recommendations on how to
pay the estimated $23 billion cost to provide health insurance for
all Americans.
   ``We did not name taxes,'' Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV told a
hearing of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. ``I
think had we named taxes we would have come into the same
criticism.''
   He said the commission had, in fact, accomplished a great deal
by putting a total price tag on its proposals _ $66.6 billion.
   Rockefeller said the group had narrowed the range of taxes that
could be used by establishing the financing would have to be
progressive, meaning the payment would grow with income and that
all age groups would have to pay.
   ``We think we bit the bullet,'' said the West Virginia Democrat,
adding that Congress and the White House can easily raise the taxes
for the plan ``when they decide what they want to do.''
   Committee chairman Edward M. Kennedy said that the bipartisan
commission, formed in 1988, was only supposed to ``outline health
policy'' and not substitute itself for the Finance and Ways and
Means committees.
   Rockefeller had said last month when the commission's report was
released that the tax-writing committees would have to come up with
the financing. Criticism of a lack of a financing plan came from
within the commission as well as outside it.
   Friday's hearing, held in cooperation with the Senate Finance
Committee, dwelled on the health insurance component.
   The other major component deals with long-term care for all
Americans.
   Rockefeller said the commission found that 32 million Americans
lack health insurance and that one-quarter of the uninsured are
children. Three-quarters of the uninsured are workers and their
families, with the majority working in small firms, Rockefeller
said.
   The commission, named after the late Rep. Claude Pepper of
Florida, recommended a jobs-based universal health insurance plan
because most insurance coverage already is provided through
employers. The plan calls for full coverage for everyone within
five years.
   Employers would either have to provide insurance or contribute
to a public plan.
   Friday's hearing was the first in a series of hearings on how to
develop and speed up passage of legislation to provide
comprehensive health care.

<HEAD>Conservatives, Social Democrats Remain Apart Over Forming
Government</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of East Germany's second-largest
party on Friday said the dominant party has remained vague on
policy, jeopardizing hopes of forming the country's first
non-Communist government before Easter.
   Markus Meckel, acting chairman of the Social Democratic Party,
said the Christian Democratic Union still had not presented a
single ``position paper'' on unification with West Germany.
   The Christian Democratic Union, which heads the Alliance for
Germany, has been trying to form a government since elections March
18. The alliance favors speedy unification, while the Social
Democrats want a more gradual process to ease the country out of 40
years of Communist rule.
   Meckel said the country needs a government ``as soon as
possible, but I doubt that it can really happen before Easter.''
When he agreed to formal talks Tuesday, he said a government could
be formed before the April 15 holiday.
   The top Christian Democrat responded by saying his party would
be able to form a coalition government even without the Social
Democrats.
   ``We can also govern without the SPD,'' said party
general-secretary Martin Kirchner.
   Lothar de Maiziere, head of the Christian Democratic Union, was
asked Thursday during the inaugural session of the new Parliament
to try to form a government by next week.
   The 400-member Parliament convenes again Thursday. If de
Maiziere is successful in his efforts by then, the legislature will
vote in the new government.
   The alliance, which also includes Democratic Awakening and the
German Social Union, needs the support of the Social Democrats for
a two-thirds parliamentary majority required to push through laws
that would speed unification.
   The alliance, however, can also form a government with the help
of a liberal alliance, which has given its tentative agreement to
join in a broad coalition.
   The Social Democrats have had serious ideological differences
with the alliance's German Social Union. According to East
Germany's ADN news agency, those two parties were able to clear
away some of their differences in a late-night meeting.
   ADN quoted Meckel as saying there are still ``differing views''
between the two parties, but ``no obstacles that can't be
overcome.''
   In West Germany on Friday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised that
his countrymen will not face a tax increase to finance the heavy
costs of German unification.
   ``A tax increase would unnecessarily brake the economic upswing
and have a counter-productive effect,'' Kohl said in a speech in
the West German city of Ludwigshafen.

   A retailers' group said Friday it will fight key
business reforms Japan promised the United States to alter the
nations' trade imbalance, and a consumer group disputed claims the
changes would help them.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, in a televised appearance, asked
Japanese for ``understanding and cooperation.'' He said the
economic changes could ``in some cases be painful,'' but he
promised they would lead to a better quality of life for the
Japanese people.
   Under an agreement reached Thursday in Washington, Japan
promised to address wide-ranging structural barriers to trade. The
most controversial point of the package would revise a Japanese law
that protects small retailers by restricting the opening of larger
stores.
   The Federation of Specialty Stores Associations reacted with
anger this point.
   ``The decision will do nothing but weaken minor retailers,
devastate shopping districts, and slow down economic and cultural
development of the community,'' it said.
   Under current Japanese law, consent of small neighboring shops
is needed before a big store can open. The process can take 10
years.
   U.S. officials say the law impedes entry of foreign stores. They
also note that larger Japanese stores are more likely to sell
imported products than small shops.
   Easing such barriers would help cut the United States' $49
billion trade deficit with Japan, they say.
   The federation vowed to ``do our best to prevent the decisions
from being enforced by keeping close ties with other groups and
promoting consumer awareness and cooperation.''
   The association claims a membership of 50,000 small retailers
nationwide. The trade ministry says Japan has 1.6 million retail
shops with fewer than 50 employees, and 800,000 tiny
``mom-and-pop'' stores.
   U.S. officials also have argued that changes sought in Japan
would benefit Japanese consumers, who pay some of the world's
highest prices because of a complex distribution system and a web
of government restrictions.
   But some see advantages to the small stores.
   ``It is not cheap pricing that we consumers want,'' said Naokazu
Takeuchi, head of the Japan Consumers Union, one of the nation's
largest consumer groups. He said large supermarkets charge
relatively high prices for produce that is not necessarily fresh.
   A mushrooming of large stores could destroy local shopping
communities, he added.
   ``We have to take many elements _ cultural aspects, community
relationship _ into consideration before making decisions,''
Takeuchi said.
   Kabun Muto, minister of international trade and industry, said,
``It is necessary for us to create an environment that promotes
sales of imported foreign goods in Japan. Because we are living in
the era of speed, it is only natural to shorten the (new store
approval) process.''
   For small retailers, Muto said, ``we will never give them 100
percent protection under our free economy system. It is their own
responsibility to make efforts to make their own business go well.''
   Kaifu called the reforms a duty that ``Japan must discharge as a
responsible member of the international community.''
   Kaiful said the implementation of the changes may be painful.
``It is my conviction, however, that they are essential in
furthering Japan's own national interest,'' he said.
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said, ``Against the background of
the serious large-scale trade imbalance, the present Japan-U.S.
economic relations, unless managed properly, is in the danger of
suffering grave damage, posing a threat of undermining the mutual
trust which lies at the foundation of the overall relationship
between the two nations.''
   Japan argued in the talks that the United States contributed to
the trade imbalance with its large budget deficit, low savings
rate, short-term corporate planning and relatively weak education
system. U.S. negotiators promised efforts to remedy these problems.

<HEAD>Battle Plan Formed to Kill Millions of Crickets in Rural Nevada</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state of Nevada is going to war. The
enemy: millions of crickets that will eat almost anything, can grow
as big as a mouse and have invaded Nevada in the worst infestation
since the 1930s.
   ``They're in the canyons right now and our goal is to kill them
before they reach the valleys and the towns where they can do some
real damage,'' Robert Gronowski, director of the Nevada Department
of Agriculture's plant industry program, said Friday.
   ``If we stop them in the mountains I think we've got the problem
licked. But we couldn't wipe out the entire population no matter
what we did.''
   The insects, known as Mormon crickets, are hatching across
700,000 acres in five rural counties. The worst infestation of the
brown juice-spitting pests is near Winnemucca, 150 miles northeast
of Reno, where 100 crickets have been counted per square foot.
   Once on the march, the crickets will leave barren land in their
wake, even eating the bark off trees and devouring each other if
food is scarce. They can reach the size of a small mouse, some 2
inches long, and will bite people if disturbed.
   ``Once they start marching it becomes much tougher to stop
them,'' Gronowski said. ``But right now they're still young and
aren't really on the move so we've got an opportunity to do
something to control them.''
   Mormon crickets got their name from an infestation in Utah in
the 1800s that ended when sea gulls from Salt Lake City reportedly
flew over the land and ate the insects.
   The battle plan worked out by state and U.S. agriculture
officials includes spreading a poison-laced bran and oil mixture on
egg beds at the mouths of canyons where the insects are hatching.
   A two-man crew is scheduled to begin the baiting program Tuesday
in the Winnemucca area. They'll continue through May 1 when
surviving crickets are expected to begin their hungry march across
the sagebrush and cheat grass desert lands toward crops and home
gardens.
   Beginning May 1, an additional two-man crew will apply patches
of the poisonous bait across areas where the crickets are traveling.
   ``We'll apply an 8-foot-wide band then go about 10 feet down the
road and apply a second band; if the first band doesn't kill them,
hopefully the second one will,'' Gronowski said.
   The insecticide isn't harmful to larger animals or people,
according to Gronowski. ``Someone would have to eat a lot of it to
even get sick.''
   Aerial spraying will begin April 23 in Lander County and other
infested rural areas where there aren't any rivers to get polluted
by the insecticide. The spraying will be concentrated in the dry
Middle Reese River area and the Reno Gund Ranch which, despite its
name, is halfway across the state from Reno.
   The program is expected to cost $25,000 to $80,000, which will
be picked up by the federal government because the infestation is
on Bureau of Land Management property, Gronowski said.
   ``We'll keep the baiting and spraying programs going until the
crickets start laying eggs about July 15,'' he explained. The
insects die after laying their eggs.
   ``That should be the end of the problem but there's no way to
tell if they'll come back like this next year or in 10 years. We'll
just have to wait and see,'' he said.
   If the program doesn't keep the insects out of crops and towns,
Gronowski said authorities might have to get private ranchers and
farmers involved in killing them.
   Agricultural officials say they believe this year's large
infestation occurred because three years of drought allowed large
egg beds to accumulate and there were no extremes of heat or cold
to kill them.

Garland said Thursday on WNYW-TV's ``Good Day New York.''
   ``People say, `Did you ever do anything after ``My Three Sons?''
' They forget that I was Kate Jackson's mother for four years on
`Scarecrow and Mrs. King.' Nobody ever remembers that I was the

   ``Jake's Women,'' a new Neil Simon comedy
starring Peter Coyote and Stockard Channing, will close in San
Diego before it reaches New York, a spokesman said.
   It is the first time a Simon play scheduled for Broadway
production has closed out-of-town, said spokesman Bill Evans on
Thursday.
   ``The show may very well arrive to New York in another version,
but this production won't,'' Evans said.
   ``Jake's Women'' was to have opened at the Neil Simon Theater in
New York on April 30. It will close April 15 at San Diego's Old
Globe Theater.
   The comedy, which Simon has called semiautobiographical,
concerns a writer who is still coming to terms with the death of
his first wife while his second marriage falls apart.
   Simon, whose Broadway hits include ``Barefoot in the Park,''
``The Odd Couple'' and ``Biloxi Blues,'' has had his share of flops
on the Great White Way, including ``Fools,'' ``God's Favorite'' and
the revival of ``Little Me.''

   British ethnologist Jane Goodall says her
work to save chimpanzees from extinction makes it easier for her to
put up with the state of the world's environment.
   ``If I look at the whole world picture, overpopulation,
pollution, the destruction of forests and so on, it's hard to be
happy,'' Goodall said in a recent interview with The Oregonian.
   ``It's better to concentrate on the things I'm actually involved
with. That makes it a bit easier.''
   Goodall was in Oregon to give lectures on chimpanzees, which now
number between 100,000 to 200,000 in the wild.
   ``If we lost the chimps from the wild, that would also mean all
the forest would be gone,'' she said. ``And where would we all be?''
   Goodall, 56, went to Tanzania in 1960 to study with
paleontologist Louis Leakey, who sent her to study the behavior of
chimpanzees at Gombe, Tanzania. She has devouted nearly 30 years to
the study of the primate.

   Ask rock singer Laura Branigan about ``sex on
the beach'' and she'll tell you it's a new drink.
   At least that's what she says she would pass along to rock lyric
critics such as Tipper Gore.
   Branigan said Friday that she would tell the wife of U.S. Sen.
Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., that ``sex on the beach'' is a drink if
she had to explain the lyrics of the title track from her new album
``Moonlight on Water.''
   The song includes these lyrics: ``Instead of dreamin' about all
the money we got much simpler things to do. Moonlight on water. Sex
on the beach.''
   She said the lyrics represent more than sex.
   ``Sex on the beach is really, I think, more than the actual
physical act. It's the feeling of being with someone you care about
or a friend, or just alone on the beach stripping off your clothes
at night and going skinny dipping and, you know, just living for
the moment.''

   Romanian defector Nadia Comaneci has given her
first gymnastics performance in six years.
   Comaneci performed Thursday night before a near-capacity crowd
at the 1,800-seat Ziegfeld Theater inside Bally's Reno
hotel-casino. It was her first U.S. exhibition in nine years and
her first public performance since 1984.
   Fighting off tears, Comaneci told the crowd, ``I'm glad to be in
my new homeland. This is very emotional for me. ... I love America.
I love you all.''
   A cast of 16 younger gymnasts was in the performance, which was
taped by ABC Sports for broadcast April 21.
   The show's producer, Paul Ziert, said he's thinking of touring
with Comaneci.
   ``Nadia again is excited and motivated,'' Ziert said. ``She sees
that she can still do what she loves, that she can still be a part
of gymnastics.''
   Comaneci also was reunited with former coach Bela Karolyi, who
guided her to a series of perfect 10s and three gold medals in the
1976 Olympics in Montreal when she was 14.
   Karolyi defended the 28-year-old star from publicity over her
alleged tryst with a married man who helped her defect in December.
Karolyi, who defected 10 years ago, said she must have felt as he
did on his arrival in the United States.
   ``Ten years ago, I was standing in the streets of Los Angeles a
desperate man,'' he said. ``Ten years later, I believe Nadia was
just as desperate as me.''

   A distraught and unemployed man
walked into a museum Friday and sprayed a chemical on Rembrandt's
``The Night Watch,'' but museum officials said damage to the
nation's most famous painting was slight.
   It was the third attack this century on the huge Rembrandt,
which hangs in the Rijksmuseum. The painting was slashed in the two
other incidents.
   A museum guard immediately sprayed a neutralizing agent, saving
the artwork's delicate paint layer before the chemical could eat
through the veneer, said museum keeper Piet van Thiel.
   By late Friday afternoon, most of the chemical had been removed
from the 12-by-14{ foot painting. Like all government-owned
artworks, it is not insured. Its value has never been made public.
   The attacker wore a hooded raincoat and was about six feet from
the painting when he produced ``a little spray pump he had been
concealing in his hand,'' said witness Barry Olshen, a professor
from Toronto.
   Dutch Television described the chemical as concentrated sulfuric
acid.
   Only a knee-high steel barrier keeps visitors away from the work
Rembrandt painted in 1642. Unarmed guards are near it at all times.
   Museum guards overpowered the suspect and handed him over to
police, who said they were unable to determine the man's motives.
The 31-year-old man was not identified, in line with Dutch police
practice. He was held on suspicion of vandalism.
   ``He's confused and not telling us anything at the moment,''
police spokesman Klaas Wilting said.
   Restoration experts took the painting out of its plain wooden
frame and stood it against the wall on the museum's second floor,
where it shares a spacious gallery with three other 17th-century
paintings.
   Using delicate brushes, they applied an agent that dried out the
white blobs covering about a square yard of the work, then wiped it
clean.
   Van Thiel told reporters the painting needs new veneer but will
go on display in two weeks, protected by a glass shield until the
veneer is dry.
   The attack was a reminder how vulnerable the Netherlands'
artworks are, said Rob Mulders of the Sotheby's auction firm.
   In 1975, a Dutch schoolteacher claiming to be on a divine
mission slashed ``The Night Watch'' several times with a knife
stolen from the restaurant where he had just eaten lunch. He later
committed suicide in a mental asylum.
   During World War I, a jobless shoemaker slashed the painting to
protest his inability to find work.
   ``The Night Watch'' portrays a group of 17th-century militiamen
characteristic of the period when such fraternal organizations
patrolled Dutch cities by night.
   It is best known for Rembrandt's skillful handling of light and
darkness and the beam of light that illuminates a richly dressed
woman in the foreground.
   The painting was believed to have been made on the occasion of a
1638 visit to Amsterdam by Maria de Medici, Queen of France.

   A cargo plane apparently lost an
engine and crashed into the sea, killing its American pilot, police
said Friday. The two other people on the plane were rescued.
   The accident occurred Thursday evening shortly after the Super
Constellation LD-49 left San Juan's international airport for the
Dominican Republic, police said.
   Witnesses told local radio station Radio Reloj they saw one of
the engines fall. The other burst into flames, and there was an
explosion seconds later, the witnesses said. The plane then plunged
into the sea near Levittown, a suburb about 10 miles west of San
Juan.
   Three police helicopters hovered over the crash scene as police
marine units and U.S. Coast Guard and Civil Defense personnel
worked to recover the pilot's body.
   The pilot, identified as William Bailes, apparently drowned
after being knocked unconscious in the crash, police said.
   Police spokesman Baltasar Vazquez said Bailes was an American
citizen who lived in the Dominican Republic.
   The two crewmembers aboard the aircraft were identified by
police as Ramon Castro Lara, the flight engineer, and Miguel de los
Santos. Both are from the Dominican Republic, police said.
   The two jumped out of the plane before it hit the water,
according to the English-language newspaper The San Juan Star,
which quoted eyewitnesses.
   Castro Lara and De los Santos were treated for minor injuries,
police said.
   The cause of the accident was not known. The National
Transportation Safety Board was investigating.
   Local newspapers reported that Bailes was co-owner of AMSA
Airlines, the air freight company for which he was flying. The Star
quoted AMSA cargo supervisor Hector Rivera as saying the airplane
``was a pretty old one'' but that it had been repaired recently.

   Supporters and opponents of an exhibit of
Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually graphic photographs rallied Friday
outside a courthourse where a judge heard pleas to protect the show
from censorship.
   Five hundred supporters marched about 10 blocks through
downtown, ending at the steps of the Hamilton County Courthouse.
They were met by about 100 people protesting Friday night's
scheduled opening of the exhibit. Police kept the two sides apart.
   The supporters chanted for freedom of expression and carried a
banner that read: ``If you give artists freedom of expression, soon
every American will want it.''
   Opponents carried signs that read ``We want decency in
Cincinnati,'' and ``Calling pornography art does not make it so.''
   The Contemporary Arts Center asked a Hamilton County Municipal
Court judge to prevent local authorities from filing criminal
charges or taking any other action involving photographs showing
sexual or sadomasochistic acts.
   More than 3,000 museum members were expected to attend a special
preview Friday night. The exhibit is scheduled to open to the
public Saturday.
   City and county officials asked Judge Edward Donnellon to
dismiss a lawsuit by the museum, which wanted a jury to decide
whether the photographs violated local obscenity laws. Dismissal of
the lawsuit would allow authorities to intervene.
   Police Chief Lawrence Whalen has called some of the photos
criminally obscene but said authorities hadn't decided whether to
file charges. A group called Citizens for Community Values
contended that nine of the 175 photographs are unacceptable for
public viewing.
   The Contemporary Arts Center issued a statement saying it would
not be be deterred from opening the show.
   ``The CAC has supported the right of these individuals to
express their opinion, while maintaining its own right to present
the exhibition under the constitutional guarantee of freedom of
expression,'' it said. ``CAC has taken precautionary measures to
inform visitors of the exhibition's content.
   ``Regardless of the judge's decision, the CAC is committed to
opening the exhibition, `Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment,'
to the public April 7.''
   Warning signs were posted at the center for the exhibit's
Cincinnati run. The museum said it would not admit anyone under age
18. The show was scheduled to run through May 26.
   Last June, the Mapplethorpe exhibit was canceled at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
   The exhibit of the work by Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS in
March 1989, prompted Congress to limit funding to the arts after
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., declared the photographs obscene.
   It has been shown in Philadelphia, Chicago, Hartford, Conn.,
Berkeley, Calif., and Boston.

   Latvia's Communist Party met Friday to discuss

   About 800 delegates representing Latvia's 177,000 Communists
began a two-day meeting in the capital, Riga.
   The Communist parties of neighboring Lithuania and Estonia have
already split with Moscow and declared their support for
independence in those republics.
   The three Balitc republics were forceably annexed by the Soviet
Union in 1940. Lithuania's legislature declared the republic
independent March 11.
   The Kremlin responded by saying the move was illegal and invalid
and launched a show of force that included sending troops to occupy
party and government buildings.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said some Latvian
Communists believe they should split with the Moscow-based
Communist Party and crusade for Latvian independence.
   Alex Grigoriev, an editor of the Latvian People's Front
newspaper, said the party debate, which was televised live in
Latvia, was inconclusive.
   In another development, unarmed volunteers backed by Lithuania's
legislature entered the main printing plant in Vilnius early Friday
to reoccupy the building, legislative spokeswoman Rita Dapkus said.
   The plant, where Lithuania's main daily newspapers are printed,
was occupied by soldiers as part of the Soviet crackdown.
   Dapkus said in a phone interview that after several hours of
tense discussions, the soldiers and volunteers agreed to a joint
occupation of the building.
   Also Friday, Lithuania's military commissar told reporters he
plans to proceed with a spring draft in the breakaway republic.
   Maj. Gen. A. Vysotskis told a news conference that nearly 6,000
young men will be recruited starting April 15. His remarks were
reported by Tass.
   Since March 11, dozens of Lithuanians have deserted the Soviet
army. Soviet troops have used force to arrest some of them.

   A federal grand jury on Friday accused
a former member of Iraq's mission to the United Nations of plotting
to assassinate two opponents of the Iraqi government, authorities
said.
   Andri Khoshaba, 47, was accused of two counts of interstate
travel to further a murder-for-hire plot against the two
unidentified opponents of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
authorities said.
   A warrant was issued for the arrest of Khoshaba, a former driver
at the Iraq's U.N. mission.
   Khoshaba traveled to New York City in February to meet with an
Iraqi government agent to discuss the plot, said U.S. Attorney
David Levi.
   Details of the alleged assassination attempt and the role of the
Iraqi agent were not released.
   Levi said Khashoba is a resident of Modesto, about 80 miles east
of San Francisco.
   If convicted, Khoshaba could be sentence to a maximum 20 years
in prison of and fined $500,000, authorities said.

   Civilian unemployment dipped to 5.2 percent in
March, a slight improvement from February and the lowest rate in a
year, the government said Friday.
   But analysts attributed the good news more to a statistical
quirk than to an economic upswing. Indeed, the Labor Department
report said the number of new jobs last month hit a four-year low.
   ``The economy is muddling along, but it's muddling along at a
full-employment level,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist for
the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago. ``It's a, `Stay as you are,
Sir,' economy, continuing along its path of steady but sluggish
growth.''
   Last month's 5.2 percent jobless rate, down from February's 5.3
percent, was the lowest since March 1989, when the rate was at a
15-year low of 5.0 percent.
   The next month, joblessness hit 5.3 percent, then eased down to
5.2 percent in May but rose again in June to 5.3 percent, where it
held through February.
   Even with Friday's report, most analysts remained concerned that
the slowdown in the economy's overall growth would translate into
higher jobless rates by year's end.
   ``The low unemployment rate is a surprise in an economy that's
growing below its potential, ... if we continue to have anemic
growth, it's going up,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the
Boston Co.
   By the end of the year, some analysts predicted, unemployment
could reach 5.7 percent.
   Taking a more optimistic view, Michael Boskin, chairman of the
presidential Council of Economic Advisers, said administration
officials believe ``there's room for the economy to expand and for
employment growth to continue and the economy to grow more strongly
than it's growing today.''
   As for last month, most economists said the 0.1 percentage point
drop in unemployment probably stemmed from a continued tight labor
market and from the fact that the government's figures, based on a
survey of 60,000 households conducted early in March, reflected job
activity in February more than in March.
   Over the first two months of the year, economic growth created
about 700,000 jobs. Last month, based on a separate survey of
employers, just 26,000 jobs were added to non-farm payrolls.
   ``Basically, 1990 started off to a bang and it seems to have
come to a screeching halt in March. It is troubling, but given the
strength of the first two months, I'm not inclined to panic,'' said
David Wyss of DRI-McGraw Hill.
   Janet Norwood, the commissioner of labor statistics, said the
unseasonably warm weather in January and February kept construction
activity unusually high.
   That resulted in ``fewer opportunities for additional hiring in
March,'' she said in explaining a 60,000-job loss in construction.
   Surging employment prospects in January and February helped
reduce the number of ``discouraged workers'' to 747,000 for the
first three months of the year.
   That's a level not seen since early 1979. For all of 1989, the
number of discouraged workers had averaged 840,000.
   Dederick saw this decline as ``another sign that we're operating
with an economy than can utilize nearly all of its workers.''
   Discouraged workers are unemployed people who have given up
looking for a job in the belief that the search will be fruitless,
   At the same time, the nation's manufacturing slump continued,
with a loss of 30,000 factory jobs in March. That brought
manufacturing job losses to 100,000 since November and 250,000 over
the last year, the department said.
   ``There's no indication that manufacturing is going to turn
around any time soon. That sector of the economy is bleeding, not
profusely, but it's in a recession,'' Dederick said.
   Economists were concerned that average hourly earnings rose from
$9.88 to $9.92, a 0.4 percent change that would translate into a
5.0 percent growth over a full year.
   ``It's a signal that inflation is not going to quickly fade,''
Sinai said.
   The government's household survey said that total employment
rose slightly in March to 118.3 million and that the labor force _
those employed or actively looking for work _ edged up to about
124.8 million, a growth of about 200,000.
   The losses in factory payrolls were more than offset by gains in
the service industries, which added 125,000 jobs, and the federal
government, which added 75,000 Census Bureau workers and other
employees.
   Since November, the number of service jobs has grown by more
than 400,000.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the March
jobless rate was 5.1 percent, down from February's 5.2 percent.

<HEAD>Suspended Sentences Ordered in Pentagon Document Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two RCA Corp. employees who pleaded guilty to
obtaining and transporting classified Pentagon budget documents
were sentenced Friday to two years imprisonment, with all but a few
months suspended.
   In sentencing Ronald B. Stevens and Leonard C. Kampf, U.S.
District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, Va., said he wanted
the sentences to have a deterrent effect on those who would
consider similar activity in the future.
   Stevens and Kampf had pleaded guilty Feb. 5, the same day that
RCA Corp. pleaded guilty and paid $2.5 million to cover criminal
and civil liabilities.
   The cases stemmed from Operation Uncover that investigated the
trafficking in classified documents by major Defense Department
contractors.
   The documents involved summarize the Pentagon's plan for future
spending, said Michael J. Costello, head of the Defense Criminal
Investigative Service's Washington field office.
   Stevens, a manager of marketing services at RCA's Aerospace and
Defense Division in Cherry Hill, N.J., was sentenced to two years
imprisonment, with all but two months suspended, and 100 hours of
community service. He also was placed on one year of supervised
probation and fined $3,000. Stevens still works for RCA Corp., a
subsidiary of General Electric Co., Costello said.
   Kampf, who was employed as manager of marketing information and
communications in RCA's Government Systems Division in Cherry Hill
until his retirement in 1984, was sentenced to two years
imprisonment, with all but four months suspended, and 100 hours of
community service. In addition, he was placed on one year of
supervised probation and fined $5,000.
   The two had faced a maximum possible sentence of 10 years in
prison.
   ``The sentencing of corporate employees to jail is a sanction
which must occur if corporate America is to re-think its marketing
philosophy,'' Costello said. ``Corporations can't go to jail, and
they have to consider the traumatic effect on their employees who
may have to do hard time.''
   Since November, guilty pleas stemming from charges in Operation
Uncover have been entered by RCA Corp., Stevens, Kampf, four other
contractors and one individual. Additionally, one individual was
convicted.
   The others were:
   _Boeing Co. Boeing paid fines and penalties of $5.2 million
following its Nov. 13 guilty plea. Former Boeing employee Richard
Lee Fowler was convicted Dec. 7 of 39 counts of conspiracy,
conveyance without authority, mail fraud and conversion of
government property. He received a two-year prison sentence and is
currently in jail on contempt charges for refusing to answer
questions posed by a federal grand jury, Costello said.
   _Hughes Aircraft Co., a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.
Hughes entered a guilty plea March 9 and was ordered to pay $3.67
milion in fines and penalties.
   _Grumman Corp. Grumman pleaded guilty March 16 and was ordered
to pay $2.5 million in fines and penalties. Grumman executive Harry
Kotellos, a West Point graduate and retired Air Force lieutenant
colonel, pleaded guilty March 12. Kotellos faces a maximum penalty
of $250,000 in fines and five years imprisonment when he is
sentenced May 18.
   _Raytheon Co. Raytheon pleaded guilty March 20 and agreed to pay
a total of $1 million in fines and penalties.

   Champion dog-sledder Susan Butcher told
President Bush on Friday that she has plans for her own brand of
U.S.-Soviet detent.
   If all goes well, Butcher said, there will be a 1,000-mile dog
sled race between Alaska and Siberia.
   Bush welcomed Butcher and her prize sled dog, Granite, to the
White House to congratulate her on her fourth win of the annual
Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race across Alaska.
   Butcher and her team of dogs made the 1,158-mile Anchorage to
Nome run in a record 11 days, 1 hour and 53 minutes last month. She
broke her 1987 record by more than 10 minutes after braving
temperatures that dropped to 40 below zero and 100 mph winds that
ripped across the Bering Sea.
   Arriving at the White House in a shortsleeve spring dress while
others were bundled up in winter garb against a cold rain, Butcher
professed not to be cold, even when waiting outside while Bush's
meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze ran long.
   ``I just finished a 440-mile race the day before yesterday in
the Arctic. It was 20 below,'' she laughingly told Bush as they
posed for photos with Granite in the Rose Garden.
   She gave Bush a photograph of the Iditarod race signed by the
top 20 finishers after the president emerged from his Oval Office
meetings to make superpower summit preparations.
   She also told him about plans for the Alaska-to-Siberia race.
The Soviets already have agreed, and the race will go 800 miles
into the Soviet Union.
   Butcher, 35, who is generally recognized as the greatest sled
dog racer in the world, told Bush she started her mushing career in
Maine, the president's vacation home since his boyhood. She is a
native of Massachusetts.
   Butcher and her husband live in a wilderness cabin, 140 miles
northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska, with a brood of dogs that numbers
as many of 150. She breeds the dogs for other dog sled racers.
   Only one other musher, Rick Swenson, has won the Iditarod four
times.

   How would ``Mister Rogers'' describe himself?
   Fred Rogers, familiar to millions of viewers of his long-running
public TV program, ``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,'' knew the
question was coming Friday at a National Press Club lunch.
   ``It's a tough question, and I've thought a lot about it,'' he
replied with a grin. ``I think maybe it might be Albert Schweitzer
and Arsenio Hall.''
   In his speech, Rogers urged people to be better listeners, to
``try to understand what they've heard and then respond with all
the creativity and care that their life has allowed them to
develop.''
   In reply to questions from the audience of journalists and their
small children, Rogers said he is concerned that much of what
children see on television is ``very scary.''
   He said parents should always sit with their children to
interpret ``the horrendous stuff'' they see on TV news programs.
   In his 35 years in children's television, Rogers said the
``outsides of children's lives have changed a lot'' but he said
they are the same inside.
   Like adults, he said, children need to be assured that they are
lovable, capable of loving others and respected for who they are.

   Security forces using automatic weapons,
tear gas and truncheons attacked about 200,000 pro-democracy
demonstrators near the royal palace Friday, killing and wounding
scores of people.
   One doctor said he saw soldiers carting 200 corpses from the
center of the city. A high-ranking Western diplomat said witnesses
provided him with a ``wild range'' of the number of dead, from nine
to 300.
   State-run Radio Nepal reported Friday night that only one person
had been killed and eight injured. One witness said he saw 35
bodies at a hospital, but doctors contradicted his report.
   During almost five hours of protests, mobs of angry
demonstrators set fire to several government buildings, including
the city hall and Ministry of Commerce. Bands attacked houses of
politicians loyal to King Birendra, who dominates the government
and has rejected calls for a multiparty system.
   Late Friday, the army moved in, cordoning off the palace with
metal barricades and heavily armed squads. Soldiers clutching
automatic weapons patrolled the deserted streets of the capital in
trucks.
   Piles of tires smoldered at intersections littered with bricks,
shoes and slippers left behind by fleeing protesters. Tear gas
fogged the air, and gunshots echoed in the distance.
   Demonstrations also erupted in three other towns, including the
tourist haven of Pokhara. At least nine people died in clashes with
police outside Katmandu, witnesses reported by telephone.
   A doctor at Bir Hospital, Katmandu's biggest, said a British
journalist was among the dead. A British man and a Dutchman also
suffered bullet wounds, the doctor said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Their identities were not released pending notification
of relatives.
   The Nepali Congress Party and a coalition of left-wing groups _
all banned by Nepalese law _ have been fighting since Feb. 18 for
democratic reforms in this Himalayan nation wedged between China
and India.
   Before Friday, at least 16 people had died in the protests,
which struck a popular chord among the country's 17 million people.
A series of strikes in support of the movement had grounded
airplanes, closed shops, shut off electricity and slowed work at
hospitals.
   On Friday morning, in his most conciliatory move yet, the king
dissolved the Cabinet and replaced hard-line Prime Minister Marich
Man Singh Shrestha with a political moderate, Lokendra Bahadur
Chand.
   The king also established a committee to study changing the
constitution, which since 1961 has banned political parties. And he
set up a committee to access the damage and loss of life caused by
the last seven weeks of protest.
   ``The royal proclamation has given a slap in the face to the
countrywide call for democracy,'' Nepali Congress leader Ganesh Man
Singh said in a message from his hospital bed. ``The people's
demands can only be reflected in a multiparty system.''
   Singh was placed under house arrest shortly after the movement
began and subsequently hospitalized for arthritis and a urinary
infection. He said the ``people's movement will be carried on with
even greater intensity.''
   Protests began in at least four cities soon after the king's
proclamation was broadcast on Radio Nepal.
   In Katmandu, about 200,000 people marched on the royal palace,
waving flags and chanting anti-government slogans.
   In midafternoon, police attacked with sticks and tear gas when
the crowd came within 500 yards of the palace, witnesses said.
   Police then opened fire. One witness said he saw at least 200
demonstrators fall to the ground.
   ``It was practically a massacre. They fired into the crowd. We
saw it in front of the hospital,'' said a doctor at Bir Hospital.
As he spoke, a line of bleeding and bandaged demonstrators were
rushed past on stretchers.
   ``I lost consciousness during a baton charge,'' said an
18-year-old man, his head wrapped in a blood-soaked bandage. ``I
fell to the ground. Then they started firing. People were falling
all around me.''
   Another witness said he saw 30 young men gunned down as he
watched the demonstration from a hotel window.
   ``The people were unarmed and the government just started
shooting,'' he said.
   He said security forces carried away some of the wounded but
others were left lying in the street.
   At sundown, the city was blanketed in darkness as a blackout,
called by the opposition, took effect.
   Doctors at Bir Hospital and at Tribhuvan University Teaching
Hospital said they had nine bodies and 150 wounded people,
including 30 in critical condition. But they charged that soldiers
were carting away corpses from the city.
   ``Bodies were taken in trucks for disposal by the army,'' said
one doctor at Bir Hospital, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``At least 200 to 300 people must have died.''
   A lawyer said 40 people were killed.
   In the state-run news report, Radio Nepal said police were
forced to shoot.
   Nepal's only experiment with Western-style democracy lasted two
years and was halted in 1961 by King Mahendra, father of the
present monarchy. Mahendra accused the Nepali Congress of corrupt
and inefficient government.
   Today, the king rules in conjunction with the Rashtriya
Panchayat, or National Assembly. The king selects one-fifth of the
assembly's 120 members. The rest are elected on a nonparty basis,
but political observers say their candidacies must be approved by
the palace.
   Most of the protests have focused on the ban on political
parties, rather than on the monarchy.
   King Birendra has been accorded god-like status by many of his
subjects in this landlocked nation, where the literacy rate is 25
percent and the per capita annual income is $150.

   An atheist group is demanding that an
underwater statue of Jesus be removed from a federally protected
coral reef, angering those who say the bronze monument should stay.
   ``Can't these people find anything better to do with their
time?'' asked diver Robert Segueira of Miami Beach. ``That Christ
is beautiful, and it's not like it's in anybody's way, except maybe
for the fish.''
   Brian Gorman of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration in Washington, D.C., said the agency would decide
whether the Christ of the Deep statue would remain in 25 feet of
water in Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary.
   ``Although we view the statue as a historic artifact rather than
a religious icon, we do take the issue bought up by the atheists
seriously,'' Gorman said. ``We are researching whether or not it is
proper for the statue to be in a federal park.''
   The statue is a duplicate of the Christ of the Abyss, which
stands in 50 feet of water off Genoa, Italy. The Florida statue,
cast in Italy and donated to the Underwater Society of America by
Italian industrialist Egidi Cressi, was placed in a state park in
1965. A boundary change later included the statute in the federal
sanctuary.
   American Atheists says the statue violates the constitutional
requirement for separation of church and state.
   ``I find it incredible that someone had the brazen gall to
install such a shrine on public property,'' said American Atheists
member Romulus Roberts of Wilton Manors.
   ``This is a public park, funded by the public's money, and there
are other people in this world besides those who believe in Christ.
I definitely want that statue removed,'' he said.
   The 2-ton statue stands on a 7{-foot pedestal on a white-sand
bottom in an amphitheater of corals and has served as the backdrop
for underwater weddings.
   Like the Christ of the Abyss, the Christ of the Deep statue was
designed as a symbol of peace and as a memorial to people who have
lost their lives at sea, officials said.

<HEAD>Court Frees IRA Supporter Wanted in Britain on Weapons Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a
British request to extradite an IRA supporter and former legislator
on a firearms charge, ruling he must be freed because the offense
was politically inspired.
   Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke, who was in
Dublin for unrelated talks, told reporters: ``We are greatly
disturbed.''
   The decision cast a new shadow over Anglo-Irish relations,
exacerbating a long dispute about extradition of Irish Republican
Army suspects.
   Owen Carron, 37, a former member of the British Parliament for
the outlawed IRA's political front, Sinn Fein, left the court
surrounded by cheering supporters. ``I'm delighted,'' the former
schoolteacher declared before being driven away in brilliant spring
sunshine.
   In Belfast, capital of Northern Ireland, the British authorities
said the unanimous ruling by the five-judge court was ``most
worrying.''
   ``We cannot accept that acts of terrorism which put people's
lives at risk ... are in any way political,'' the Northern Ireland
Office added in a statement.
   Three weeks ago, the Irish Supreme Court freed two IRA men who
had escaped from jail in Northern Ireland, saying there was a risk
they would be beaten up by prison guards if they were extradited.
Both men were serving 18-year terms on terrorism convictions.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said the reason given
by the court was ``grossly offensive.'' She said the refusal to
extradite the men, Dermot Finucane and James Pius Clark, would
encourage terrorists to believe they would probably find a safe
haven in the republic.
   Carron jumped bail in Northern Ireland in January 1986 while
awaiting trial on charges of possessing an assault rifle.
   He fled to the republic, was arrested in 1988 and has since
fought rulings by two lower courts ordering his extradition.
   He was elected as a Northern Ireland member of the British
Parliament in 1981 on a wave of sympathy for Bobby Sands, the first
of 10 hunger strikers who died in jail during a political protest.
Carron lost his seat two years later.
   The British Broadcasting Corp., in a report from Belfast, said
the freeing of Carron probably means Britain will be unable to get
any IRA members extradited for offenses committed before 1987.
   That was when Ireland signed the European Convention of
Terrorism, which undermines the ability of terrorist suspects to
avoid extradition by pleading political motivation.
   The Irish government counters British protests by pointing out
that courts are independent of government control.
   However, the extradition dispute is straining the 1985
Anglo-Irish accord, which was intended to improve cooperation
against the IRA.
   The mainly Roman Catholic IRA, banned on both sides of the
border, is fighting a guerrilla campaign to unite Northern reland
with the republic under a leftist administration.
   The Anglo-Irish accord angered leaders of Northern Ireland's
Protestant majority because it gave the Roman Catholic Republic of
Ireland a consultative role in the running of the British
administration of the province.
   The Northern Ireland Office says there have been a total of 154
warrants since 1971 for extraditions from the republic and seven
suspected terrorists have been returned.

   A mobile-home park for retirees is
the unlikely setting for a case that could yield a landmark
decision on the privileges of unmarried couples who live together.
   The park's owner is asking the courts if an 1868 state law
against ``lewd and lascivious'' cohabitation is grounds to evict
unmarried elderly couples who stay in the same trailer.
   William Watson II, owner of Romany Mobile Home Park, also wants
a Pinellas County circuit judge to decide if that law renders
unconstitutional local fair-housing laws that prohibit
discrimination based on marital status.
   In a lawsuit filed last month, Watson asked the court to allow
him to bar unmarried couples from his 91-site park, where
homeowners say the minimum age of residents is 55 years.
   ``Depending on how far it gets, it will probably have a bearing
on all the (fair-housing) laws in Florida,'' said Gloria Williams,
president of the Florida Association of Community Relations
Professionals.
   Watson refused comment, but his attorney, Peter Hooper of St.
Petersburg, said ``lewd and lascivious'' is a general legal term
that does not necessarily mean depravity and could apply to common
sexual activity.
   ``What's driving Mr. Watson is personal conviction. He's trying
to do what's right,'' he said.
   Hooper said the lawsuit is not against a specific individual,
and he does not want the issue to go to trial. He would like a
court decision by April 20.
   ``The perception is it's common'' for unmarried couples to live
together. he said. ``Most people don't realize, it's probably
illegal.''
   Robert Herman, a 65-year-old retiree who shared a mobile home
with his wife until she died three years ago, is among residents
bothered by Watson's lawsuit.
   ``He is passing moral judgment on me,'' Herman said. ``It's
caused me a lot of heartaches.''
   Herman, who lives in New Jersey and spends part of the year at
the park, said he has had a conflict with management because a
woman he is dating has stayed in his mobile home. Herman said he
was told by Watson's son, who helps manage the park, that he must
sell his home, lease it or marry his girlfriend.
   ``She started to cry. She broke down. He's assuming that things
are happening here,'' said Herman, who said another couple was
staying with them in his home. ``I figured I was doing nothing
wrong.''
   Assistant Pinellas County Attorney Bill Falkner said it's
unclear if unmarried men and women who live together are protected
under the county's ordinance. He said it wouldn't ``protect anyone
who conducts lewd and lascivious behavior.''
   But he said, Watson ``assumes that people who are unrelated and
living together are committing lewd and lascivious acts. I don't
know if we can make that assumption; it certainly doesn't seem so
to me.''
   According to the Florida State Archives, the 122-year-old law
states that ``if any man and woman, not being married to each
other, lewdly and lasciviously associate and cohabit together ...
they shall be guilty.''
   The Legislature amended the law in 1971 and changed the maximum
penalty from up to three years in prison to one year in prison and
a $500 fine.

<HEAD>Mattox Denies Drug Use Report, Challenges Richards to Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HOLMES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>

   State Attorney General Jim Mattox denied
allegations Friday that he was seen using marijuana, and challenged
Democratic gubernatorial rival Ann Richards to take a lie detector
test with him.
   ``I've not had an illegal drug, period. Ever,'' Mattox said
after The Dallas Morning News and Houston Chronicle reported
accusations by a lawyer and a former policeman that they saw Mattox
smoke marijuana on separate occasions in the 1970s.
   ``Get those two folks, sit them right here with me. I'll tell
them they are liars to their faces,'' Mattox said. He said the
incidents they allege ``absolutely did not take place.''
   He said he'd take a lie detector test, ``and I want you to get
Ms. Richards strapped in beside me when we do it.''
   Mattox and Ms. Richards, the state treasurer, survived last
month's Democratic primary to meet in Tuesday's runoff. The winner
will take on Republican oilman Clayton Williams, a political
newcomer who swept away his opponents in the primary.
   Drug questions have dominated the Democratic race since Ms.
Richards refused to answer yes or no when asked during the primary
if she'd ever used illegal drugs. Mattox, citing witnesses he won't
identify, accused her of drug use 10 years ago.
   Mattox said Friday there was a ``real difference'' between the
drug allegations. ``In my case, they are untrue. In her case, they
are true,'' he said.
   At a campaign stop in Denton, Ms. Richards had little to say
about the allegations against Mattox.
   ``I really thought when Mattox began all this (drug) stuff, for
the provocation of it, the sort of witch hunt that he was on, I
just thought the whole thing was sick,'' she said.
   ``I still do, regardless of who they're talking about. I feel
badly for the electorate, really, that this campaign has taken this
tone,'' Ms. Richards said.
   Ms. Richards, a recovering alcoholic, says she hasn't taken a
``mood-altering chemical'' in 10 years but refuses to answer other
questions. She says that could discourage others from seeking
treatment. She also refused to debate Mattox before Tuesday's
runoff vote.
   Mattox said drug use isn't as big an issue as Ms. Richards'
refusal to discuss it.
   ``I told you exactly what took place in my circumstances. You
asked me questions and I gave you answers,'' he told reporters
Friday. ``I'm standing here. The one that I'm running against is
not here.
   ``I notice that with the other campaign, you only have an
opportunity to visit with that individual when you kind of catch
her on the run. And she's bobbing and weaving and dodging.''
   The allegations against Mattox were made in affidavits obtained
by The Morning News from Houston lawyer Jim Sharp and former Dallas
policeman Edward H. Lowe.
   Lowe said he saw Mattox smoke marijuana in a Dallas apartment
during an undercover investigation. Lowe, then a vice officer, said
he did not arrest Mattox or others in the room because his
assignment was to confirm a tip about a prostitution ring.
   Mattox said he had enemies in the Dallas police department at
the time and couldn't imagine that the officer wouldn't have jumped
at the chance to arrest him on a drug charge.
   Sharp said Mattox and he shared a marijuana cigarette in 1974 in
a car after the Democratic state convention in Austin.
   Mattox said Sharp had unsuccessfully sought a job from him in
the past, adding: ``I have never been in any car, anyplace, anytime
where marijuana has been smoked.''

<HEAD>Besieged Khost: Symbolic Importance But Little Strategic Value</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK O'DONNELL</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KHOST, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fierce fighting has flared anew in
this shell-shocked border town, which has little strategic
significance but is symbolically important in the war between the
government and Moslem guerrillas.
   There is normally little fighting in Afghanistan during Ramadan,
the Moslem month of fasting that began March 27. Khost, near
Pakistan's western border, is the exception this year.
   The Pakistan-based mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, are
firing artillery from key captured military outposts and pummeling
the town and adjacent airport.
   Government forces respond with heavy aerial bombardment to try
to suppress rebel fire and dislodge the mujahedeen from their
positions around the mine-laden perimeter.
   The Afghan government in Kabul, 100 miles to the northwest, at
one time landed three supply flights a night in Khost. But the
airstrip is badly cratered and littered with damaged planes, and
supplies are now dropped by parachute.
   ``We are closing in on the Communists. We have taken the war
into the city and now we are tightening the circle,'' said
Jalaludin Haqqani, the most powerful commander in the area.
   ``On the ground we are in complete control. In the air, the
communists can still fight and still deliver supplies,'' Haqqani
said in an interview during a three-day trip to guerrilla positions.
   Both sides have suffered casualties since fighting erupted anew
last month, but exact figures are difficult to determine. The
government rarely releases the number of its dead and wounded,
while guerrilla groups have been feuding for years and don't talk
to each other.
   Khost lies at the center of a high plateau in the Safed Kho or
``white mountains,'' 18 miles from the Pakistan border. Its
strategic significance is limited, but the guerrillas and the
Afghan government have placed enormous importance on the city in
Paktia province.
   Afghan President Najib is from the province. Gen. Shah Nawaz
Tanai, the former defense minister and leader of last month's coup
attempt, maintained a home in Khost until he defected to the
mujahedeen.
   The town has been on the brink of falling to the mujahedeen
several times in the past two years. But troops loyal to Najib have
always managed to push back the guerrillas.
   A week after the failed mutiny, Tanai boasted to reporters that
government troops manning the Khost garrison would surrender to the
mujahedeen when he gave the order.
   Across the border in Pakistan, the headquarters of the
U.S.-supported resistance, the Hezb-i-Islami group led by Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar, claimed the garrison wanted to surrender but was
awaiting assurances of safety.
   ``The only major obstacle standing in the way of a surrender is
Jalaludin Haqqani,'' said a spokesman for Hekmatyar.
   Haqqani, a traditionally proud Pathan warrior with a flowing red
beard, is commander of rival Hezb-i-Islami faction led by Yunis
Khalis.
   Haqqani has been fighting to take Khost since the 1978 coup that
installed a Communist government in Afghanistan. He is considered
the most powerful guerrilla commander in the area, largely because
of his well-supplied fighters and close tribal ties rather than his
fighting ability.
   Khalis' guerrillas have been blamed for the massacre of some 70
government soldiers who wanted to surrender to the mujahedeen in
November 1988 near the eastern city of Jalalabad.
   Their bodies were cut up and put on display, and other guerrilla
groups said that prevented soldiers from defecting once the Soviet
army ended direct military involvement in Afghanistan in February
1989.
   On Friday, Moslem guerrillas opened fire as more than 10,000
insurgents surrendered in northwestern Afghanistan's Herat province.
   Radio Kabul said an Afghan general, a deputy security minister
and several civilians died in the battle that broke out during the
surrender ceremony.
   Haqqani's fighters contend Hekmatyar's faction has no right to
negotiate a surrender and say they want revenge for the thousands
of guerrillas who have been killed during the war.
   Their stand has enabled Hekmatyar's guerrillas _ who have a
reputation for ruthlessness _ to promote themselves as
humanitarians.
   ``The killing of prisoners is un-Islamic and the Koran
explicitly states that once your enemy lays down his weapons you
are under obligation to protect him,'' said the Hekmatyar spokesman.
   Before the war, Khost's population was about 15,000. Now after
nearly 12 years of fighting, Western diplomats in Pakistan and
mujahedeen leaders say that number has been drastically reduced.
   They say the only residents are the 5,000 to 8,000 militia and
government troops manning the garrison. Most belong to a civilian
militia formed by local tribesmen that had supported Gen. Tanai
throughout the war.
   The mud villages between Khost and the Pakistani border are
free-fire zones, and anyone traveling in the area is subject to
attack _ by bombing and strafing of Afghan warplanes or mujahedeen
firepower.
   The guerrillas fire into the town with mortars, recoilless
rifles and howitzers. The bodies of dead are left to rot.
   Government troops answer with frequent air raids, forcing the
mujahedeen to seek cover in underground bunkers. Once the planes
are gone, the guerrillas emerge and resume firing.

   Three lawyers and a law firm ``runner''
accused of illegally promoting lawsuits after the state's worst
school bus accident were indicted Friday by a Hidalgo County grand
jury.
   District Attorney Rene Guerra said he could not release the
names of those indicted until they are formally summoned to appear
before a judge. They are accused of ``barratry,'' a misdemeanor on
the first offense punishable by up to a year in jail and a $2,000
fine.
   Officials began investigating alleged lawyer misconduct after
the Sept. 21 accident in which 21 students died in the southern
Texas town of Alton.
   Guerra has said authorities received reports of lawyers
soliciting business at funeral homes, hospitals and wakes, and
engaging in other improper activity, but he would not reveal the
allegations in the sealed indictments.
   A runner is someone who works as an agent for a lawyer to

   Ninety-year-old Gena Scarbrough said she learned
how to shoot while growing up on a farm but never pointed a weapon
at anyone until she stopped a burglar with a borrowed pistol this
week.
   Police say Ms. Scarbrough stood in her carport Tuesday night
waiting for an intruder to leave the house. When the burglar
climbed out a window carrying a stereo and speakers, Ms. Scarbrough
aimed the .22-caliber pistol at him.
   ``I told him, `Put it down right there and don't move! Don't
move or I'll shoot!'' she said.
   Ms. Scarbrough said she wasn't the least bit flustered and would
have shot the burglar if he hadn't cooperated. She held the
intruder at gunpoint until the police arrived several minutes later.
   ``I'd determined he wasn't going to get away,'' she said. ``He'd
broken into my property.''
   A tenant at the duplex owned by Ms. Scarbrough had called her to
say that someone was breaking in to the other apartment.
   After phoning the police, Ms. Scarbrough rushed to the property.
In her haste, she said, she forgot her shotgun.
   But Tommie Barnes, 72, the woman who notified her of the
break-in, handed her a handgun and was by her side when Ms.
Scarbrough confronted the burglar.
   Police arrested Manfredo Barrios, 33, in connection with the
break-in.
   A Dallas police spokesman criticized Ms. Scarbrough's action.
``This is what we get paid to do,'' said Cpl. Ray Bilbrey.
   But Ms. Scarbrough, who sometimes listens to police scanners for
entertainment, said she thinks homeowners should know how to defend
their property with a firearm.
   ``I think everybody ought to have one,'' she said. ``You can't
always get the police when you need them.''

<HEAD>Ratiu, Exiled For 50 Years, Wins Nomination For President</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALISON SMALE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A millionaire businessman who spent 50
years in exile was picked as an opposition party's presidential
candidate Friday and is expected to present a tough challenge to
the ruling National Salvation Front.
   Ion Ratiu, 72, was nominated as the candidate of the National
Peasants' Party. It is one of two leading pre-World War II parties
that have re-emerged since the December revolt toppled Nicolae
Ceaucescu and ended 45 years of Communist rule.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu, a former Communist and member of
the National Salvation Front, is expected to declare his candidacy
this weekend.
   Ratiu was one of four candidates for the nomination. He won on
the first round of voting during a meeting of party's 64-member
ruling body, said party official Victor Isac.
   Isac said he believed Ratiu was helped to victory by party
elders' belief that his international connections will serve the
Peasants' Party well in the May 20 elections.
   For years, Ratiu campaigned against the Communists from exile.
He returned to Romania soon after the revolution.
   Ratiu said he would import a printing press next week to publish
an opposition newspaper open to all political parties.
   The opposition parties have frequently charged the National
Salvation Front unfairly dominates radio, television and the press.
   Isac said Ratiu also was helped by being the nephew of his
namesake Ion Ratiu, who led the influential Romanian National Party
in Transylvania at the turn of the century.
   No accurate opinion polls have been published in Romania since
the revolution, making it hard to gauge the relative strength of
the parties contesting the elections.
   Opinion samples and conversations with Romanians suggest,
however, that the National Salvation Front, which took over after
Ceausescu was ousted, will face its strongest challenge from the
Peasants' Party and the National Liberal Party.
   The National Liberals, also a strong pre-World War II party, are
led by Radu Campeanu, who last Saturday declared he would run for
the presidency.
   Campeanu also said the National Liberals, the Peasants and the
Social Democrats, another group powerful before World War II, were
forming an alliance for the May elections.
   He said the three traditional parties would cooperate in order
to win a majority in the parliamentary elections, with a possible
view to creating a coalition government.
   However, Amalia Radut, a National Liberal Party official, said
in an interview Friday that the agreement holds only for the
parliamentary, not the presidential race.
   Ratiu became a millionaire in shipbuilding and other enterprises
in Britain. He described the three-party cooperation as a kind of
``non-aggression pact'' but stressed, ``We are not a coalition.''
   Ratiu's wife, Elisabeth, from Liverpool, said she would have
``to collect my breath'' to get used to the idea of campaigning as
the potential first lady of Romania.
   Married to Ratiu for 45 years, she said she had visited Romania
frequently in the late 1960s and 1970s to see her husband's
relatives.
   ``He's wanted to come back to Romania all his life,'' she said
in an interview.

<HEAD>Ole Miss Tradition of Elected Newspaper Editors Ends</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OXFORD, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For 50 years, University of Mississippi
students who wanted to be editor of the campus newspaper had to be
elected, a procedure critics said picked the best politician, not
the best journalist.
   Following a spring protest that included publishing blank pages
in the newspaper, the process has been changed.
   The next editor of The Daily Mississippian will be chosen by a
selection committee instead of elected by the entire student body,
ending a campaign process in which candidates often spent hundreds
of dollars on posters and fliers.
   Last month, the student government voted 29-21 after much debate
to do away with elections and empower an 11-member selection
committee of faculty and students.
   Critics said fraternities and sororities controlled the annual
elections, and the votes were little more than popularity contests.
   ``Our image is that we are the Greek white supremacists who
don't want the state to be a good place to live for anyone but
ourselves,'' said Journalism Dean Will Norton, who came to Ole Miss
16 years ago.
   ``Ole Miss is a school of deep tradition, but I think this way
they will pick the best candidate,'' said Lee Eric Smith, a junior
from Holly Springs who could be the school's first black editor.
   The deadline for applying for the post is Thursday. Norton said
he knew of four students who were likely candidates.
   About 10,000 students are enrolled at the antebellum campus, the
site of race riots in 1962 after a court ordered that a black
student be admitted. About 20 students work on the editorial side
of the 10,000-circulation paper.
   Before the student government vote last month, the staff put out
two protest editions _ one had several blank pages and the other
contained the U.S. Constitution published three times in place of
the usual news and sports _ to object to the election process.
   ``We used that as a last resort to get the student's attention
to show them how seriously the student journalists feel about
this,'' said the current editor, Bill Dabney.
   Some students upset by the protest responded by scrawling
obscenities on copies and scattering hundreds of issues across
campus.
   Samir Husni, chairman of the selections board, said candidates
will be given editing, writing and spelling tests before being
interviewed.
   He said an exact timetable was still being worked out but that
the new editor should be in place by the end of the month.
   ``Since its the first time ever, we want to do it as perfect as
possible, so we'll set the stage for the future,'' said Husni.
``When you're hiring someone after a big controversy, it's even
more difficult.''
   Norton said Ole Miss was one of the few remaining U.S. schools
that chose their editor by election.
   ``What's encouraging about it is that the students brought the
change,'' said Norton.

<HEAD>Record $7.3 Billion Spent For School Construction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government spent a record $7.3 billion for
public school construction in 1987, the third consecutive year that
construction spending increased by more than 19 percent, the
Commerce Department said Friday.
   The department's Census Bureau said construction spending
totaled nearly 4.5 percent of the $166 billion spent in 1987 for
elementary and secondary education, their largest share of total
spending since 1981.
   Long-term debt issued for elementary-secondary education is the
traditional way most school construction is financed. In 1987, $6.6
billion in long-term debt was issued for school systems.
   The report, ``Finances of Public School Systems,'' is a
compilation of all pertinent finance data for all elementary and
secondary public school systems and local higher education systems
with more than 5,000 enrollment for fiscal years that ended June
30, 1987, with a few exceptions.
   Total expenditures for all education _ elementary, secondary and
higher education _ was more than $246 billion in 1987, the latest
year for which figures are available.
   The federal government spent more than $32 billion, or 13
percent of the total, to fund programs such as school lunch and
milk, impact aid, education for the handicapped and Head Start.
   Federal spending also included education research projects of
the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Energy and the
National Science Foundation.
   States funded almost $140 billion, or 56 percent, of the total
spent for education, including more than $80 billion for elementary
and secondary schools and nearly $60 billion for higher education.
   Local school systems supplied an additional $75 billion, or 31
percent, for local public education.
   According to the report, six states _ Alabama, Hawaii,
Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico and South Dakota _ received more
than 10 percent of their elementary-secondary funding from the
federal government.
   Local government shares of funding for elementary and secondary
education ranged from 91 percent in New Hampshire to 13 percent in
New Mexico.
   New Mexico and Washington had the greatest proportion of funding
for schools, with the exception of Hawaii's state-operated system,
the report said.
   The report said the nation spent an average of $2,269 per
student for instruction in 1987.
   Alaska had the highest spending for instruction per pupil at
$3,721, followed by New York at $3,597 and New Jersey at $3,531.
Mississippi had the lowest at $1,378, while Louisiana was at $1,407
and Utah at $1,487.

   Factional violence erupted into riots on
Friday, leaving 11 people stabbed to death and three killed by
police who opened fire in an attempt to stop the fighting, United
News of India said.
   In keeping with Indian news media's policy of not publicizing
religious and ethnic differences, the agency said the trouble grew
out differences between ``two communities.'' The term is often used
to describe trouble between Hindus and Moslems.
   United News said ``anti-India, pro-Pakistani'' slogans had been
painted recently on walls in Ahmedabad, where the fighting
occurred. It is 470 miles southwest of New Delhi in Gujarat state,
which is adjacent to Islamic Pakistan.
   Police reinforcements and paramilitary troops were rushed to
Ahmedabad to try to halt what the news agency called the city's
``worst ever communal riot.''
   It said police fired about 100 bullets and 150 tear gas shells
to break up the disturbance.
   Thirty-one people have been killed in the past four days in
violence in Ahmedabad, United News said. It had no additional
details on the 14 deaths Friday.
   Ahmedabad, an industrial city of 1.7 million people noted for
its blend of Hindu and Islamic architecture, served as a base for
independence leader Mohandas G. Gandhi.
   Gandhi advocated nonviolence in India's struggle for freedom
from British rule. When India became independent in 1947, it was
partitioned along religious lines into two nations: predominantly
Hindu India and overwhelmingly Moslem Pakistan.
   Today 82 percent of India's 880 million people are Hindus, while
12 percent are Moslems.

<TEXT>
   A presidential candidate once considered a
dark horse has made serious inroads into the lead held by
celebrated novelist Mario Vargas Llosa and may force a runoff,
pollsters said Friday.
   They said Alberto Fujimori, a political independent like Vargas
Llosa, has a strong chance of capturing second place in Sunday's
election with enough of a margin to force another round of
balloting.
   Nine candidates are competing in the elections, and a majority
is required to prevent a runoff.
   Fujimori, 51, is the son of Japanese immigrants and commanded
less than 1 percent of voter support in February surveys.
   The APOYO polling agency and the Peruvian Company for Market
Research said surveys taken over the last week indicate a sudden
decline in support for Vargas Llosa. His support level has dropped
from around 45 percent in mid-March to 35 percent to 37 percent.
   Their surveys showed Fujimori surging into second place with 21
to 24 percent.
   ``We have been observing a tendency, first in Lima and then in
the provinces, that is so strong that it has disconcerted
pollsters,'' said Manuel Saavedra, director of the Peruvian Company
for Market Research. ``It's a totally atypical phenomenon.''
   The pollsters attributed Fujimori's rapid rise to Peruvians'
distrust of established politicians.
   Representatives of APOYO, the Peruvian Company for Market
Research and Datum, three of Peru's leading public opinion survey
firms, met Friday with foreign correspondents to release results of
surveys taken in recent days.
   The poll results are barred from publication in Peru within 15
days of the election.
   The last survey results released in late March, before the ban,
showed Vargas Llosa of the center-right Democratic Front coalition
with 45 percent of the vote and Fujimori with almost 12 percent.
   More recent polls show Fujimori nearly doubling his popularity.
   ``I don't want to talk about the polls, but apparently they give
us an overwhelming force,'' Fujimori said in a Friday news
conference.
   The pollsters said Vargas Llosa stood a strong chance of being
defeated by what they called the ``Fujimori phenomenon'' in a
second round of balloting.
   The polling firms said Peruvians, facing the worst economic
crisis ever to hit their nation, support Fujimori because they see
him as a political newcomer. They said Vargas Llosa, who has been
campaigning two years, has acquired the image of a professional
politician.
   Manuel Torrado, president of Datum, said surveys also indicate
Peru's poor are not confident that Vargas Llosa can keep his
campaign pledge to lower inflation from current levels of 2,000
percent a year to 10 percent.
   The pollsters all agreed that Vargas Llosa's detailed plan for
economic sacrifice has cost him dearly in the polls.
   ``People have begun to fear Vargas Llosa's program,'' said
Alfredo Torres, media director for APOYO.
   Fujimori's campaign has emphasized general themes. He has said
no drastic economic measures are necessary.
   ``Peruvians are looking for a savior,'' Torrado said.

<HEAD>Fighting Between Black Groups Kills 10</HEAD>

   New black feuding reportedly
killed at least 10 people Friday, the day after President F.W. de
Klerk and Nelson Mandela agreed to open black-white talks that were
delayed by the violence.
   Pro-apartheid critics attacked the government for the accord.
Andries Treurnicht, leader of the pro-apartheid Conservative Party,
called for unity in ``the white nation.''
   On the other side of the political spectrum, a black group
lambasted Mandela for agreeing to negotiate with the white
government.
   De Klerk and Mandela, vice president of the anti-apartheid
African National Congress or ANC, agreed in Cape Town on Thursday
to go ahead with the talks. They are aimed at removing obstacles to
formal constitutional negotiations between the government and
leaders of the disenfranchised black majority.
   The two leaders hailed their Thursday night agreement as a
breakthrough. The Citizen newspaper in Johannesburg said the talks
will be April 25, though no date was official announced.
   Mandela and de Klerk also called for an end to violence that has
left hundreds dead in recent weeks and prompted the ANC to postpone
the opening of talks with the government.
   Police said Friday that rival Zulu war bands armed with guns,
knives and sticks clashed around the Natal province capital of
Pietermaritzburg.
   They set fire to homes and fought on the hillsides around black
townships of the southeastern province. The bands also clashed with
police, who fired on crowds with rifles, pistols and shotguns.
   At least one black man was killed when police opened fire on a
large crowd near Ladysmith, according to the state-run South
African Broadcasting Corp. The police also said their patrols had
been shot at when they tried to separate the fighting groups, and
one police officer was killed and three injured in various
incidents.
   Crowds attacked funeral processions, firing on the mourners and
breaking open coffins in two incidents, police said.
   The fighting erupted after two days of relative quiet in the
region hit by vicious fighting between rival Zulu factions
supporting the conservative Inkatha movement and the United
Democratic Front, an ANC affiliate.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, but they differ over tactics and
plans for a future South Africa.
   At least 67 people have been killed in the area since last week.
More than 12,000 refugees, mostly women and children, have fled
their homes to escape the fighting.
   In Pretoria, Treurnicht, the pro-apartheid Conservative leader,
lashed into the government for what he called an alliance with the
ANC and the Communist Party.
   At his speech commemorating the day Dutch settlers arrived in
South Africa in 1652, Treurnicht appealed for support from all
whites ``so that on the day the state president dares to hold a
referendum on his new constitution, this white community can stand
shoulder to shoulder and simply reject any dispensation that denies
white freedom.''
   De Klerk says he wants to negotiate a new constitution that will
bring blacks into the national government but allow whites to
maintain veto power over major policy decisions. He opposes a
one-person, one-vote system that the ANC and other leading
anti-apartheid groups demand.
   Leaders of the Pan-Africanist Congress on Friday accused Mandela
and the ANC of selling out by negotiating with the government.
   Barney Desai, the Pan-Africanist Congress' regional coordinator,
criticized the idea of negotiating with the white government.
``What you have won in battle, you will never gain on the
negotiating table,'' he said.
   The ANC and other anti-apartheid groups were legalized in
February, when Mandela was released from prison. He was serving a
life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the white
government.

<HEAD>FDA to Issue Aspirin Warnings for Pregnant Women</HEAD>

   New warnings will be required on
over-the-counter aspirin products advising women in the last three
months of pregnancy not to use the products unless directed by a
physician, the Food and Drug Administration said Friday.
   Aspirin late in pregnancy can affect fetal circulation and
uterine contractions and cause excessive bleeding during elivery,
an FDA spokeswoman said.
   A third-trimester pregnancy warning is already required on
non-prescription ibuprofen products.
   Acting FDA Commissioner James Benson detailed the agency's plans
in a March 29 letter to Thomas Warriner, under secretary of the
California Health and Welfare Agency.
   Benson said he was aware of the state's interest in preparing a
similar warning under Proposition 65, California's anti-toxics law,
and wanted officials there to know FDA's plans.
   Benson said the wording of the warning had not been determined,
but would likely be similar to the ibuprofen warning.
   That warning says: ``It is especially important not to use
ibuprofen during the last three months of pregnancy unless
specifically directed to do so by your doctor because it may cause
problems in the unborn child or complications during delivery.''
   The agency plans to publish a rule on the warning in the next
several months, Benson said. It would go into effect immediately
and companies would have one year to make the label changes, he
said.
   Aspirin labels already advise pregnant women and nursing mothers
to get the advice of a health professional before using the product.

   County commissioners meeting to discuss a
noise ordinance found that they themselves violated the proposed
decibel levels while they chatted during a recess.
   ``Outside in the hall, it was 75 or 77 decibels while y'all were
on your break,'' said Sgt. Joe Westbrook of Glynn County Police,
who brought a sound meter to the courthouse.
   The ordinance would limit noise to 60 decibels in residential
areas.
   County Police Chief Carl Alexander said the proposal is
unreasonable, and he suggested Thursday that commissioners raise
the limit in a residential area to about 70.
   Interest in a noise ordinance apparently grew out of complaints
last year from Beverly Shores subdivision residents who were
bothered by music coming from a skating rink north of Brunswick.
   Skateland owner Bob Hurst said he thinks he can operate within
the proposal's restrictions. He said he already has a sound meter
inside the rink and keeps the music at no more than 80 decibels. At
that level, the music cannot be heard by his nearest neighbor,
Hurst said.

   The Republican National Committee sent a
membership card to the wrong guy, Rep. Frank Annunzio said Friday.
   The Illinois Democrat said he had received a letter from
President Bush on behalf of the committee asking for a contribution
that would make him a sustaining member of the Republican Party.
   Ironically, Annunzio, who has represented a Chicago district for
26 years, faces a tough challenge this fall from a Republican state
senator, Walter Dudycz.
   ``I have learned that the Republican National Committee has
targeted me for defeat and has pledged to give my opponent
$400,000,'' Annunzio said in a reply letter.
   ``Since the Republicans have that kind of money to spend, why do
you need a contribution from me?'' Annuzio inquired in the letter.
   Mistakes like the Annuzio solicitation ``happen all the time,''
said RNC spokeswoman Leslie Goodman.
   We've had more than 200 elected officials switch parties,'' she
added. ``If Democrats don't want to switch, maybe they'd be willing
to contribute.''

<TEXT>
   Soviet border guards Friday barred Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato from entering Lithuania, and D'Amato later accused
Moscow of trying to strangle the Baltic republic's ``cry for
freedom.''
   D'Amato, a New York Republican, had printed in his U.S.
diplomatic passport a stamp that read, ``Lithuanian Republic, Visa
No. 3'' and had been invited to visit Vilnius by the president of
the breakaway republic, Vytautus Landsbergis.
   The senator said the purpose of his trip was to show
congressional support of Lithuania's drive for independence from
Moscow.
   But at the small country border crossing at Ogrodniki in
northeast Poland a Soviet major politely told him to go to a
consulate and apply for a regular Soviet visa.
   The refusal came as little surprise. The crossing is normally
closed to all but Polish and Soviet citizens. Since the
confrontation between the Kremlin and Lithuania began this month,
the Soviets have limited even that traffic.
   D'Amato used the occasion to highlight what he called the Soviet
Union's ``psychological warfare'' on Lithuania, whose parliament
declared independence from the Soviet Union on March 11.
   ``It's nothing more than a stranglehold being placed on the cry
for freedom by the Lithuanian people,'' D'Amato said.
   ``I think the Soviets are making a mistake: those artificial
barriers will not keep the Lithuanian people away from freedom.''
   He told reporters the United States should be more skeptical of
the intentions of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``The sooner the United States wakes up to what is taking place
and becomes realistic, the better,'' he said.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev says one thing and does another. He talks about
freedom and yet denies access to a free country.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said regarding D'Amato's
trip: ``We're always concerned about members of Congress and others
getting too involved in foreign policy. But on the other hand, he
is a senator who has an important message to deliver. He represents
a broad constituency and has every right to make that trip and
deliver his message.''
   D'Amato is on the Senate Appropriations Subcomittee on foreign
operations, but is not viewed as a major Senate spokesman on
foreign relations.
   He flew to Poland Thursday planning to challenge the Soviet land
blockade of Lithuania. The Soviet Union rejected any claim of
Lithuanian sovereignty, and U.S. diplomats and Western journalists
were ordered out of Vilnius.
   Accompanied by Lithuania's Foreign Minister Algrinas Saudragis,
D'Amato and a half-dozen aides traveled by chartered bus the 200
miles from Warsaw to Ogrodniki, Lithuania's only direct border
opening to the outside world.
   In sunny weather, they arrived at the crossing at about 2 p.m.
Polish soldiers let them pass the first barrier on the Polish side.
   But 100 yards down the road they came to a red-and-white barrier
marking the Lithuanian frontier and guarded by Soviet KGB troops.
   Through an interpreter speaking Lithuanian, D'Amato asked Soviet
Maj. Vitas Buchis for permission to pass into the country. Buchis,
a native Lithuanian serving in the Soviet border force, told
D'Amato he would check by telephone with Moscow.
   After returning from a phone call that he said was to Moscow,
Buchis told D'Amato passage was forbidden. ``I am sorry but rules
are rules. I am just following orders,'' he said.
   Saudragis, who was met on the Lithuanian side by two
subordinates, then crossed into Lithuania by himself.
   Extending his arm to D'Amato's across the frontier, Saudragis
said: ``We shake hands over this border that divides us. But your
support is strengthening our spirit.''
   Saudragis also thanked the United States for never recognizing
the forced incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   ``We are optimistic that the borders now being guarded by the
brutal military force will be replaced by bridges of good will, and
that we will be able to visit each other without any obstacles,''
he said.
   D'Amato spent about one hour at the border before turning back.
   The Soviet government has closed the Ogrodniki crossing for most
traffic since Tuesday. It is permitting only Polish and Soviet
citizens to use it to return home to their respective countries.
   Ogrodniki is Lithuania's only direct border crossing to a
non-Soviet country.
   The main international crossing between Poland and the Soviet
Union is about 95 miles to the south, at Brest in the Soviet
Byelorussian Republic.

<HEAD>Bank Official Questioned by Marcos Lawyer About Immunity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former bank manager who told of huge cash
withdrawals for Imelda Marcos' visits to New York was grilled
Friday by her attorney about the immunity given him by the U.S. and
Philippine governments.
   Oscar ``Oca'' Carino, who managed the Philippine National Bank's
New York branch from 1973 to 1984, also was questioned about his
evasion of U.S. taxes on interest he skimmed, with the approval of
Mrs. Marcos' personal secretary, from two accounts set up for
offshore investments.
   ``Isn't it true that you did some dishonest things while you
were at that bank?'' asked Mrs. Marcos' attorney, Gerald Spence.
   ``I did some wrongdoings there but they were pursuant to
instructions to me,'' Carino said.
   On Thursday, Carino testified that Mrs. Marcos visited New York
two to three times annually during the years he ran the PNB office,
each time drawing an average of $100,000 from his bank's operating
accounts for her personal use.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of using more than $160 million stolen
from the national treasury, and millions more from defrauding
several banks, to finance a lavish lifestyle and the purchase of
four New York buildings.
   Her husband, former Philippines President Ferdinand E. Marcos,
was charged in the 1988 indictment but died in exile in Hawaii last
September.
   A co-defendant, Saudi Arabian financier Adnan Khashoggi, is
charged with mail fraud and obstruction for allegedly backdating
documents to help the Marcoses conceal their ownership of the
Manhattan properties.
   Spence probed into Carino's agreements with the two governments
that granted him immunity from prosecution in exchange for truthful
information about his dealings with the Marcoses.
   Carino many times said he could not remember details of the
agreements when pressed by Spence. One exchange _ about whether
Carino knew he wouldn't be arrested before he came to speak to U.S.
prosecutors in 1987 _ went on for about 20 minutes.
   Spence, however, could not shake Carino's answer that he spoke
to prosecutors on the advice of his lawyer and had no assurances
from the U.S. government that he would not be charged. ``I took the
risk,'' he said.
   Carino said he set up two special accounts ``with the clear
understanding'' of Mrs. Marcos' confidential secretary, Fe Roa
Jimenez. One, called Oemcee, lasted from 1976 to 1981 when it was
replaced by the second one, called Oscarman Holdings Ltd., which
was closed when he left the bank in 1984.
   The accounts were designed for offshore investments that would
not be noticed by PNB staffers or state bank examiners, he said,
but the interest was credited to him and went undeclared on his
U.S. taxes.
   The witness said he couldn't recall how much interest he took
from the two accounts over the eight years. His agreement with the
U.S. government includes a provision that he repay $123,000 in back
taxes and interest, but Carino said he had not yet made the payment
to the Internal Revenue Service.
   ``You can remember a conversation with the first lady at the
airport nine years ago but you can't remember the amount of money
that you took from these accounts?'' Spence asked with an edge of
sarcasm.
   ``I never paid much attention, I was not keeping track. But on
those instructions from the first lady ... if I don't remember them
and execute them, I'll be done,'' Carino said.

   President Bush praised former President Lyndon
B. Johnson on Friday as ``a towering and passionate figure.''
   ``The Johnsons were close to both the land and the people,''
Bush said at a White House ceremony honoring the nation's 36th
president.
   He paid special tribute to Johnson's widow, Lady Bird Johnson.
``She brought to the White House dignity, warmth and grace,'' Bush
told an East Room audience that included Mrs. Johnson and several
hundred people who served with Johnson.
   Bush also called Mrs. Johnson's highway and park beautification
program, along the Potomac River in Washington and alongside Texas
highways, ``a very important legacy.''
   The best thing his predecessor ever did, Bush said, was to
``marry Lady Bird.''
   Mrs. Johnson, 78, thanked Bush and his wife Barbara for tribute.
   ``What a beautiful big wonderful thing you've done for this big
family of ours,'' she said.
   ``We had the added privilege of going upstairs, and remembering
where this picture hung and where that one came from. ... I am very
grateful,'' she said.
   Of LBJ, Bush said: ``He was a towering and passionate figure,
endlessly in motion.''
   Among the guests were former House Speaker Jim Wright, former
Defense Secretary Clark Clifford, former Health, Education and
Welfare Secretary Joseph Califano and former White House aide Jack
Valenti.
   Bush also joked that members of his administration in a quarter
century ``might be invited to your own reunion, perhaps even hosted
by President Robb _ Jennifer Robb.''
   It was a reference to the Johnson's granddaughter, who is the
daughter of Sen. Chuck Robb, D-Va., and Lynda Bird Johnson Robb.
   Johnson, who became president after John F. Kennedy was
assassinated in 1963, won election on his own in 1964 and was
inaugurated the following January, 25 years ago this year.

<TEXT>
   Negotiations have stalled for
disbanding the U.S.-backed Contra rebels because of disagreement
over the size of security zones in Nicaragua and over a verifiable
cease-fire, rebel leaders say.
   One leader, Oscar Sovalbarro, known as Commander Ruben, said in
an interview Thursday night it was impossible for his guerrillas to
disarm before the leftist Sandinista government leaves office on
April 25.
   A delegation from the United National Opposition, the
pro-American, 14-party coalition newly elected to power in
Nicaragua, is expected in Tegucigalpa on Saturday to try to break
the deadlock.
   Contras and Sandinistas have exchanged several proposals without
results.
   Members of a U.N. mission for Central America will monitor the
talks.
   The Contras accused the Nicaraguan military and Interior
Ministry security troops of bombing peasant communities and
intimidating residents, killing UNO activists and ordering soldiers
to shoot at helicopters from a U.N. mission that is supervising the
demobilization plan.
   The Sandinistas charged the Contras with staging attacks against
military installations and against pro-Sandinista civilians to
intimidate them.
   Honduran military authorities have barred journalists from
visiting Contra jungle camps at Yamales, near the Nicaraguan
border. But journalists who went there before the clampdown said
most Contras have slipped into Nicaragua.
   A Western diplomatic source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said only 2,000 to 3,000 combatants remain at Contra
camps of the 12,000 fighters based there before the Sandinistas
lost in the elections on Feb. 25.
   The number of Contras in Nicaraguan territory ``is easily
9,000,'' the source said. Sovalbarro, the Contra chief of
psychological operations and its negotiator on disarmament, claimed
12,000 rebels are now inside Nicaragua.
   An accord signed by the Contras and UNO in Tegucigalpa on March
23 calls for the rebels to start disarming no later than April 20,
five days before President Daniel Ortega hands over power to
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, but sets no deadline
for completing the process.
   ``Nobody is saying that those inside (Nicaragua) have to disarm
before April 25,'' said Sovalbarro. ``For there to be confidence
among the fighters and a national reconciliation there must be a
total demilitarization.''
   Sovalbarro said the Contras and Sandinistas agreed on the sites,
but not on the size of five security zones inside Nicaragua where
the rebels are to concentrate and surrender their weapons to
international observers.
   The Sandinistas want a total area of less than 400 square miles;
the Contras want 1,200 square miles, he said.
   Sovalbarro said the Contras also want the Nicaraguan army and
security forces purged of Sandinista officers, saying ``the entire
Sandinista structure must disappear.''
   An agreement signed by UNO and the Sandinistas on March 25
stipulates that the government of Mrs. Chamorro will ``respect the
professionalism'' of army and security forces but forbids officers
from holding leadership posts in any party.
   ``If she agrees that elements that are in high leadership levels
of the Sandinista party remain in place, that would create much
unhappiness among all the fighters, and even the voters,''
Sovalbarro said.
   Some Contra fighters interviewed inside Nicaragua said they will
not surrender their weapons while the Sandinistas maintain control
of the army.
   ``But they know they must obey a top command,'' said chief
Contra spokesman Alejandro Acevedo. ``As people, anybody has the
right to express themselves. But they are very disciplined
elements. And we keep in constant touch with them.''
   Acevedo said negotiations were hindered by what he said were
Sandinista violations of a cease-fire. ``As long as our people are
persecuted and harassed, they will keep thinking that way. We must
have a true cease-fire. It's a very important step,'' he said.
   Contras remaining at camps in Honduras are to surrender their
weapons April 16. But military sources said ``only a bunch of old
FAL'' Belgian-made automatic rifles remain there because the
Contras took all their newer weapons with them to Nicaragua.

   Nightmares jolt Ruben Valladarez awake in his
hospital bed, tormenting him with thoughts of friends who died in a
place called Happy Land.
   ``I feel better,'' he said Friday. ``Only I got a little bad
dreams.''
   Valladarez, the disc jockey at the illegal Bronx social club, is
one of a few survivors of the arson fire that killed 87 people
March 25. He was critically injured, with burns over 40 percent of
his body.
   In his first interview, Valladarez described the ordeal
haltingly, with tears. He lost friends, and at least three cousins,
he said, naming them with a tortured face. He cannot explain why he
was the one who lived.
   He was spinning records in the back, on the second floor, about
4 a.m. ``Somebody screamed _ `Fire!''' Valladarez recalled. ``I put
the lights on. I said into the microphone, ``Everybody get out!
I've got a fire!''
   There was no emergency exit at the crowded club, no emergency
lights, no sprinkler system, not even a window to jump from.
Valladarez was one of only two people to escape from the second
floor. Four or more escaped from the first floor.
   First he crossed to the front of the second-floor dance area,
looking for a friend. ``I said, `We have to get out, man.''' He
descended a narrow front stairway to the first floor bar. It was
already filled with flames.
   ``Downstairs is fire. I run downstairs,'' said Valladarez, 26, a
native of Trujillo, Honduras, for whom English is a second language.
   People there were running about in panic. ``They scream.
Everybody going to the door, pushing the door. It's locked.''
   Valladarez thought of his wife, Frances, and their 2-year-old
daughter, Nadine. He ran into the flames, searching for the sole
open door; there was no other choice. ``I had to go,'' he said.
   When Valladarez reached the street his clothes were on fire.
People threw water on him. He suffered third-degree burns on his
forearms and hands, second-degree burns on his legs and face.
   When his wife saw him at Bronx Municipal Hospital she could not
recognize him.
   Twelve days and three operations later, Valladarez remains in
critical condition in the burn ward. He may need more surgery, and
two to three months of hospitalization, and nine to 18 months of
rehabilitation. The burn ward chief, Dr. Steven Blau, said it is
too soon to say whether Valladarez will regain the use of his hands.
   ``His attitude is very good. He's a fighter,'' Blau said. ``And
his attitude is very important, because everything he has to do in
terms of recovery will hurt him.''
   Valladarez's face is raw, blistered under the eyebrows and on
his lips, coated with salve. A tube feeds oxygen into his nose. Two
needles provide intravenous fluid. His arms are heavily bandaged,
one suspended from a stand to keep swelling down. He is hooked up
to a heart monitor.
   He said he feels anguish for loved ones who died and anger at
Julio Gonzalez, the man accused of setting the fire to punish an
ex-girlfriend who worked there.
   ``He has to go to jail. Fifty years _ or 200,'' Valladarez said.
``In my country, this man is die.''
   Valladarez, who worked at the Happy Land for two years, said he

   NASA on Friday cleaned Discovery's
engines and replaced a TV camera lens from the shuttle in
preparation for next week's mission to launch the $1.5 billion
Hubble Space Telescope.
   The camera was removed from the shuttle's robot arm after
technicians found the spot on the lens, said NASA spokesman Bruce
Buckingham.
   ``It's not going to impact the schedule at all,'' he said.
   Mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the 50-foot-long
arm to deploy the telescope during the five-day mission. A spot on
the television camera lens might have hampered his view.
   The launch countdown was to begin soon after Hawley and the four
other crew members arrived on Saturday afternoon.
   The shuttle is scheduled to blast off at 8:47 a.m. Tuesday.
   ``Things are coming on us in a rush right now,'' said Bill
Taylor, the telescope's chief engineer. ``It's almost unbelievable
to think that in a couple of days we'll be closing the payload
doors and it will be the last time we'll see it until it's in
orbit.''
   Tuesday's launch date was jeopardized earlier this week when a
power outage interrupted testing of the telescope and orbiter. The
tests were completed Thursday, eliminating the last major prelaunch
hurdle.
   Technicians on Friday continued cleaning the shuttle's rear
engine compartment, removing protective covers for flight and
installing essential last-minute items.
   ``Everything's pretty well on target,'' said George Diller, a
spokesman for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Diller said the only operation left that might pose a slight
problem was disconnecting the telescope's nickel-hydrogen battery
chargers and removing the instrument's dust and moisture
protection. The operation, which NASA calls a ``payload closeout,''
was expected to the completed by Sunday.
   ``Once they get in to disconnecting the umbilicals, that's when
you get into the real serious Hubble Space Telescope closeout,''
Diller said.
   The telescope is the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever
built by NASA.
   Hawley said he has practiced deploying the telescope dozens of
times and is prepared for just about anything that might go wrong.
   ``I'm confident we can do it under almost any circumstance,'' he
said. ``NASA's real good at what-ifs, and we've done a lot
what-ifs. What if this part doesn't work? What if the arm fails
completely?''
   Once deployed, the telescope is to orbit 380 miles high for 15
years, enabling astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant
that their light has been traveling to Earth for 14 billion years.
   It will be capable of detecting objects 50 times fainter and
with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based
observatory.

<HEAD>Helicopter Design Flaws Responsible For 15 Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Flaws in the design of the Army's CH-47D
helicopter have caused two accidents that killed 15 servicemen and
injured six others, a House subcommittee contends.
   The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations found that in at least 25 instances potential
disasters were avoided by the work of the aviator, constraints on
the aircraft or luck.
   ``The report is nothing less than an indictment of the CH-47D
Chinook helicopter as well as the failure of the Army Aviation
Systems Command to seriously and effectively resolve safety of
flight problems,'' Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the
subcommittee, said in an April 4 letter.
   Dingell, in the letter to Army Secretary Michael P.W. Stone,
questioned why the service continues to procure the helicopter
despite the mechanical problems.
   He also asked if the Army would suspend its plans to buy 144
helicopters at a cost of $900 million over three years until the
problems are fixed.
   The report said the CH-47D, a twin-engine, transport helicopter
made by Boeing Helicopters of Philadelphia, has suffered numerous
mechanical problems that have grounded the aircraft nine times,
including five last year.
   In addition, the Army Aviation Systems Command has issued ``no
less than 84 flight safety directives to correct safety problems on
the aircraft.''
   A 1988 accident in Texas killed 10 soldiers and was blamed on
design defects, the report said. Fire triggered by flying metal
fragments was the cause of another 1988 crash in Honduras that
killed five servicemen.
   The Army said it had not received a copy of the report but said
its Aviation Systems Command has taken steps to resolve the
problems when identified in the CH-47D.
   ``Soldiers' safety is the Army's primary concern and the Army
would not allow the CH-47D to continue flight operations if it were
not a safe aircraft,'' Army Maj. Nancy Burt said Friday.

<HEAD>Study of Eighth Graders Shows Promise, Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The typical eighth grader is happy at home and
doing well in school, but an Education Department official said
Friday about 20 percent of middle-school students are at risk of
failure.
   Emerson Elliott, acting commissioner of the department's
National Center for Education Statistics, released the first
results of a study that will follow today's eighth graders as they
move through high school and beyond.
   ``We've already identified a large number of students who are at
risk of either school failure or dropping out before high school
graduation,'' Elliott told an Education Writers Association
conference in Chicago, where the report was released.
   ``We will continue to collect data on these same students for
another dozen years whether they stay in school or drop out,'' he
added.
   To examine factors that contribute to school success, the
National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 collected information
on six commonly used indicators of ``at risk'' status.
   Overall, 53 percent of the 24,600 eighth graders in 1,000 public
and private schools nationwide in the spring of 1988 had none of
the risk factors, but 20 percent had two or more, the study showed.
   Twenty-two percent were in single-parent families, 21 percent
lived in families with income of less than $15,000, 14 percent were
home alone more than three hours a day, 11 percent had parents with
no high school diplomas, 10 percent had siblings who dropped out
and 2 percent had limited English proficiency.
   The study found that students with several risk factors tended
to have more educational problems, including low grades and high
absenteeism. Students with two or more risk factors were six times
as likely as those with none to report that they did not expect to
graduate from high school and were twice as likely to score in the
lowest 25 percent on achievement tests and to receive the lowest 25
percent of grades, said the study.
   Twenty percent of all eighth graders were not proficient in the
basic math skills _ addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division _ considered necessary to perform everyday tasks. Thirty
percent of Hispanics, blacks, and American Indians were not
proficient at the basic level.
   Fourteen percent of eighth graders were unable to perform basic
reading tasks, such as finding information in a text or identifying
the author's main thought. About 30 percent of students who usually
speak a language other than English failed to show basic reading
skills.
   The report, ``A Profile of the American Eighth Grader,'' was
conducted under an Education Department contract by the National
Opinion Research Center, a not-for-profit research center
affiliated with the University of Chicago. Other key findings were:
   _41 percent of females and 28 percent of males aspired to
professional or managerial careers, or careers in business, science
or engineering fields.
   _10 percent of students reported that someone has offered to
sell them drugs at school, with 16 percent of American Indian, 14
percent of Hispanics, 10 percent of whites, 8 percent of blacks and
5 percent of Asians reporting that experience.
   _Blacks and American Indians were nearly twice as likely as
whites to report they did not feel safe at school, 18 percent
versus 9.9 percent.
   _The typical eighth grader spent almost four times more hours
per week watching television, 21.2 hours, than doing homework, 5.5
hours.

<HEAD>Quake Measuring 5.8 Strikes Area Northeast of Guam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake, the second in less than 24
hours, struck northeast of Guam early Saturday, according to the
Hong Kong Observatory and U.S. Geological Survey. There were no
reports of injury or damage.
   An Observatory statement said the quake registered 5.8 on the
Richter scale and was centered off the east coast of the Marianas
Islands 434 miles northeast of Guam.
   The observatory gave no further details of the quake, which
occurred at 1:04 a.m. (11:04 a.m. EDT Friday).
   Dan Finley of the U.S. Geological Service in Reston, Va.,
confirmed the quake.
   ``They did have an aftershock of 5.8 in the same location,'' he
said. ``This is normal after a big earthquake like this to have
aftershocks.''
   Earlier Friday, a quake registering 7.4 shook a section of the
Marianas Islands at 7:15 a.m. (5:15 p.m. EDT Thursday). There also
were no reports of injury or damage.
   The epicenter was 138 miles northeast of Saipan near the island
of Anatahan in the western Pacific.
   On Tuesday, all 21 residents of Anatahan, closest to the
epicenter, abandoned the island after a volcano there showed signs
of erupting.
   A Navy crew from Guam was checking the volcano Friday, but
geologists said the earlier quake and volcanic activity apparently
were unrelated.
   Anatahan and Saipan are part of the Northern Marianas chain just
north of Guam, about 1,500 miles east of the Philippines.
   An earthquake of 6 on the Richter scale can cause severe damage
in the local area. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable
of widespread heavy damage.

<TEXT>
   Frantic tenants jumped from their
windows or groped through smoky hallways as a pre-dawn fire
destroyed a three-story residential hotel Friday, killing at least
three people and injuring 21.
   At least 9 residents were unaccounted for hours after the
three-alarm blaze broke out at the Fontana Hotel on Collins Avenue
north of Miami Beach's trendy art deco district, Fire Chief
Branaird Dorris said. But officials had no evidence they were
trapped inside.
   Many of the estimated 100 residents were retirees, some of whom
had to flee without their medications or hearing aids.
   ``It's a terrible fire. I don't know how to describe this when
you have multiple deaths and you have total destruction of a
building,'' said Assistant Fire Chief John Reed. ``I can't even
think of the proper word to describe it.''
   Alfonso Teixeira, a 27-year-old Brazilian, was awakened in his
room by a frightened resident.
   ``I saw this guy running in the hall, shouting `Fire! Fire! Big!
Big!''' Teixeira said.
   The hotel had smoke alarms but no sprinklers, authorities said.
   Two women and a man were killed, and fire officials presumed
they were on a list of 12 people still missing by late afternoon.
Twenty-one people were treated for smoke inhalation at various
hospitals. Some were hospitalized and others were released. The
dead weren't identified Friday.
   ``There's reason to believe that the number of dead may grow''
because many of the missing lived in the most heavily damaged front
section of the hotel, said Assistant Fire Chief John Reed.
   After rescue efforts ended Friday, police and fire officials,
state fire marshals and a special federal fire investigation team
planned to meet Saturday to determine how to pursue the hotel
search.
   Mayor Alex Daoud, who opened his house to survivors, said the
intensity of the 3 a.m. fire led investigators to suspect arson,
but Detective Jim Hyde said no evidence of arson had been found in
the early stages of the investigation.
   Tenants reported a water leak, raising the possibility of an
electrical short, Dorris said.
   Dorris said crews had entered the building six or eight times by
early afternoon but about 30 percent of the building had collapsed
and those areas hadn't been searched for the missing residents. He
said it might be Saturday or later before the worst sections are
examined.
   Residents said the fire started near an elevator shaft at the
front of the 102-room hotel, and Hyde said two of the bodies were
found in the lobby area.
   ``I felt I was choking,'' said Rose Waller, an elderly woman who
made her way out with three neighors but lost her daily medication.
``I couldn't see because already the smoke came into my room. I
really couldn't see anything. It was blurred.''
   Residents fled in nightclothes, robes or whatever they could
grab while members of a Romanian immigrant family who have owned
the white stucco hotel since May knocked on doors to alert everyone.
   ``I ran upstairs and got people out. I broke down a door with my
shoulder to get somebody out,'' said Olimpia Mihai, a member of the
family. ``It happened so quick _ half a minute and I couldn't see
anything. I'm still in shock.''
   Her brother-in-law Cosmin said: ``I woke up in the nick of time
when the high-frequency alarms went off. I was screaming down the
halls, `Move it! Move it! Move it!' I stayed up in the halls no
more than 10-20 seconds before the smoke got too bad and I had to
run.''
   Ann Karmiller, 87, said she walked down from the third floor by
hanging onto the bannister, fleeing so quickly that she left with
nothing but her nightgown, forgetting her dentures, hearing aid and
cane.
   ``She grabbed my hand and helped me out,'' said Jewel Mirsky,
76, who escaped with Ms. Karmiller. ``It was all black. We felt the
steps very haltingly. I heard the noise and the siren went off like
mad. The smoke was very bitter.''
   Second-floor resident Joe Marcello, 32, who has limped since
breaking his back two years ago, tried to go down the hall but
choked on the smoke.
   ``I started to fear for my life. I got scared,'' he said. ``I
thought: `I'm going to die in here. How am I going to get out?' I'm
already crippled. I just busted out the window and I hung from the
second floor and I dropped down about 15 feet.''
   He said another second-floor resident broke her window, dropped
her baby to a man on the ground and jumped out herself.
   The Fontana was built in 1951 and complied with a 3-year-old
ordinance requiring electric smoke alarms in each room, said Reed,
the assistant fire chief.
   The only major violation in the most recent city fire inspection
last September was battery-powered alarms, which were replaced,
officials said.
   The hotel was not equipped with sprinklers, which won't be
required by state law until October 1991.
   The American Red Cross checked in 121 people from the Fontana
and the adjacent Prince Michael Hotel at a shelter set up at a
community center.
   Hotel Capri owner Barry Appel opened about 30 rooms for elderly
Fontana residents and said 25 rooms were available to younger
residents at a nearby apartment building.
   The staff of Fedco Pharmacy called hotel residents' doctors to
get a list of their medication and fill prescriptions.
   ``Unlike other fires, lots of these people need medical supplies
right away,'' said Red Cross spokesman Chris Chidley.

   If the administration's test battle in the
war on drugs has failed in the nation's capital, it's because
federal authorities neglected to work with local officials,
Washington Mayor Marion Barry said Friday.
   Barry, facing drug and perjury charges in the District of
Columbia, was in New Orleans for the National Conference of Black
Mayors. He briefly stole the show from Jesse Jackson when he walked
into an anti-drug meeting during a Jackson speech and was given a
standing ovation.
   Later, in an impromptu news conference, he discussed a story in
Thursday's New York Times that said the Bush administration would
soon issue a report indicating its year-old pilot program in
Washington hasn't worked.
   ``I have not seen the report,'' said Barry. ``I think they're
going to release it next week. But as Jesse Jackson indicated, the
initial approach was wrong. It was like an exclusionary situation
where you come down and you propose things for us without talking
to us.''
   Barry said he saw no irony in his attending an anti-drug meeting
at the mayors' conference while facing cocaine charges. He scoffed
at a suggestion that the proliferation of drugs in Washington could
be related to his own admitted substance abuse problems.
   ``It's a red herring,'' he said, later adding, ``America has a
critical need to solve its problem. I'm not going to be the focus
of it.''
   Barry has admitted dependency on alcohol and tranquilizers but
has skirted the issue of cocaine abuse.
   He was arrested Jan. 18 during an FBI sting operation and faces
trial on five misdemeanor cocaine possession charges and three
counts of lying to a grand jury about his drug involvement. He has
pleaded innocent to the charges.
   ``It would be nice if they would spend as much money for drug
treatment and other kinds of facilities as they did in
investigating my administration for the last 10 years,'' Barry said.
   Barry had slipped into the room during Jackson's speech and was
walking up an aisle when Jackson stopped and said, ``Come on up,
Mr. Mayor.''
   The 400 or so people in the audience stood and applauded as
Barry walked to the dais and sat next to the former Democratic
presidential candidate.
   Jackson had been delivering a scathing indictment of President
Bush's handling of the drug war.
   He described William Bennett, Bush's national drug policy
adviser, as ``a general without portfolio.''
   President Bush, Jackson told the mayors, will ``declare a war
with the resources and have you fight the war without resources _
voodoo politics.''
   Jackson also reiterated his call for state, national and local
officials to develop a plan to make public and private pension
funds available for investment in low-income housing and other
programs aimed at eliminating poverty.

<HEAD>23 Polynesians Convicted in Religious Witch-Hunt Murders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHE MARQUAND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PAPEETE, French Polynesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury convicted 23 residents
of a South Pacific atoll who claimed they were swept up by demons
or religious frenzy when they tortured to death six people during a
witch hunt.
   The seven-man, two-woman jury at the Tribunal of Papeete handed
down penalties late Thursday that ranged from three to 14 years
imprisonment for those who participated in the 1987 slayings.
   ``I find these penalties very heavy,'' said Roman Catholic
Archbishop Michel Coppenrath, the highest-ranking church official
in French Polynesia. ``The repentance of the accused is sincere.''
   The defendants, mostly fishermen and farmers from the atoll of
Faaite, showed no reaction when the sentences were read. Another
suspect, a minor, will be judged in a separate proceeding.
   The 14-year sentence went to farmer Francois Mauti, 25, on
convictions of murder, complicity in murder and inflicting mortal
blows. He led a band of disciples that organized the violence in
Sept. 2-4, 1987.
   ``I had a spirit under the spell of the devil,'' Mauti told
Judge Marcel Bihl. ``I lost my head, but I believed I was on the
holy path, shunning the evil fighting within me.''
   During the nine-day trial, the court heard defendants speak of
being swept away by evil spirits or religious enthusiasm as they
hunted down and killed neighbors they thought were possessed.
   The terror had roots in August 1987 visit by three women who
arrived from Tahiti, 300 miles to the west. The women claimed to
represent the Roman Catholic-affiliated movement Christian Renewal,
a group founded in the United States. Church authorities deny they
had any official role in the movement.
   The group already had a strong following on Faaite, a sandy
atoll where about 180 people live. The women, regarded as
``priestesses'' by the islanders, took over the community's
whitewashed church and replaced the lay preacher as the religious
authority.
   The trio's leader, Alexandra Silvia, conducted services in a
trance and told frightened islanders of her visions that God would
abandon Faaite, the defendants said.
   Miss Silvia suggested demons were in their midst, defendants
said, and the population began viewing with suspicion fellow
islanders who failed to attend her daily services.
   ``My words were misinterpreted,'' testified Silvia, a
55-year-old dental secretary who was not charged. ``I only gave
prayers that cured those who were sick.''
   But the defendants said the mood of the once-placid atoll swung
between ecstasy and dread inspired by Silvia and her assistants.
The trio left Faaite in late August and anointed seven disciples to
continue their work.
   A few days later, a 14-year-old boy reported a vision that the
devil had possessed his aunt. The islanders gathered in nightlong
prayer and finally pronounced the demon exorcised.
   They repeated the ritual with two other people. But Ioane
Harris, the assistant mayor, publicly denounced the women on Sept.
2. Maddened villagers twisted a cord around his neck, beat and
drowned him, and threw his body on a bonfire built before the
church.
   ``It was necessary to purify him,'' one defendant said. ``It was
necessary to purify the village.''
   Five more people were killed over the next two days.
   Most islanders took no part in the carnage, but it was Sept. 4
before anyone established contact with Papeete, the capital of
French Polynesia, and reported trouble on the atoll.
   The mayor, who had been on vacation, and a Roman Catholic priest
arrived the next day with police.
   Psychiatric experts testified the emotional charismatic
Christianity, mixed with ancient Polynesian beliefs in the
supernatural, produced a dangerous mass hysteria on an isolated
island lacking institutional authority. The three visitors were not
put on trial because they left Faaite before the murders.

   UAL's directors agreed Friday to a $4.38 billion
buyout by employees that would make United Airlines' parent company
the world's largest worker-owned corporation. But some analysts
doubted whether the deal would fly.
   Union leaders said the agreement calls for the 71,000 employees
to give up $2 billion in concessions over five years, including
$300 million in the first year and $500 million in the fifth year.
   The three union groups that negotiated the $201-a-share deal
have not yet secured financing for the buyout, according to a
source involved in the talks. The source spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Analysts said that weakness could prove fatal.
   Lenders also may frown on the possibility the unions will dump
UAL Corp. Chairman Stephen Wolf, who is perceived as a highly
capable airline manager despite his difficult relations with the
unions, analysts said.
   One union leader said Wolf would be out but a spokesman for the
union group said later that the issue had not been settled.
   The stock market apparently reflected investor skepticism that
the deal will be completed. After a strong opening, UAL closed $2 a
share lower at $163.50 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
   ``The capitulation of the board has been significantly
overshadowed by the continuing financing risks,'' said airline
analyst Samuel Buttrick of Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   Those risks, he said, ``make it a very uphill battle from the
financing side.''
   UAL's board announced the tentative agreement after meeting all
night at company headquarters near Chicago. The leaders of unions
representing United's pilots, machinists and flight attendants gave
some additional details at a news conference in New York.
   Under the agreement, shareholders would receive $155 in cash,
$35 in UAL notes and an estimated $11 worth of securities in UAL
subsidiary Covia Corp. for each UAL share.
   UAL would spin off to shareholders its 50 percent stake in
Covia, which is co-owned by a consortium of five other airlines and
operates an automated reservation system.
   UAL's largest shareholder, Coniston Partners, immediately called
off its threatened proxy fight to oust the board at the April 26
annual shareholders meeting. Coniston has an 11.8 percent stake in
UAL and was pressuring the board to sell to the UAL employees.
   The company formed by the unions for the takeover is called
United Employee Acquisition Corp.
   In terms of the number of workers, the largest employee-owned
company currently is Publix Inc., a supermarket chain based in
Lakeland, Fla., with 50,000 employees, said Corey Rosen, executive
director of the National Center for Employee Ownership in Oakland,
Calif.
   UAL said it expected to conclude a final agreement promptly. But
the deal depends on the unions securing financing, and Machinists
union Vice President John Peterpaul said the group had several
months to put financing together.
   ``We're very optimistic about the financing,'' he said.
   Under the plan, the unions would sign five-year contracts with
no-strike clauses. Other concessions include wage cuts of up to
7.69 percent for flight attendants and Machinists and as much as 11
percent for pilots.
   UAL's 25,700 non-union employees would negotiate their work
conditions with the union group, said their lawyer, Stephen Fraidin.
   The pilots would own 37.9 percent; Machinists 35.7 percent,
non-union employees about 14.3 percent and the Association of
Flight Attendants about 12 percent, the union leaders said.
   Wolf would be replaced, said Frederick Dubinsky, head of the Air
Line Pilots Association union.
   But later in the day, union group spokesman Hank Krakowski said
the unions had made no such decision.
   ``Our position is we're not including or precluding anyone from
any management team at this point,'' he said.
   One candidate previously contacted by the union group as the
possible successor to Wolf is Richard Ravitch, onetime head of New
York's public transit system.
   Ravitch did not immediately return calls to his New York office
Friday and the union leaders would not comment on whether he would
take over.
   ``The question is, who is going to manage this thing and take it
to the banks?'' said analyst Jack Hunter of Howe Barnes Investments
Inc. in Chicago.
   Hunter said he believed the deal would ultimately go through.
   Doubts about the deal stem from the failure last October of a
$6.8 billion employee buyout of UAL attempted by the pilots, Wolf
and British Airways PLC.
   That deal collapsed on Oct. 13, sparking a 190-point plunge in
the Dow Jones industrial average, after banks refused to finance it
due in part to opposition by the Machinists.
   Peterpaul said this deal would be more attractive to lenders
because it involves about $2 billion less debt and has the
participation of all three unions, which represent about two-thirds
of UAL employees.
   UAL is the second-largest U.S. carrier, after American Airlines.

   Bewildered survivors of a pre-dawn fire
at the residential Fontana Hotel sat quietly in an emergency
shelter Friday, staring dazedly at a crowd of social service
workers and Red Cross volunteers.
   Most of the hotel residents, many of them elderly, lost
everything they owned in the blaze that claimed at least three
lives.
   ``I just sold my business last Sunday and moved all my things
into that room,'' said Enid Davis, a Jamaican-born beautician. ``I
lost ... I just don't want to think about it.''
   ``I don't have a place to go. I don't even have a dime.''
   Ms. Davis said her children and grandchildren live ``down
south'' in Florida. But she couldn't remember where. She moved into
the Fontana only three weeks ago.
   Willy James Williams, 42, remembered coming home from a bar
shortly before the fire broke out. In his room, he was startled by
the smell of smoke that wasn't coming from his cigarette.
   ``When I went for the hall, the smoke through the (door) frame
caught me full in the face,'' he said, a Red Cross toiletries kit
in a plastic bag on his lap. ``I lost everything I had.''
   Williams, who had been at the Fontana for a week, said his
mother lives in Miami, ``but I don't want to live with her.''
   Red Cross volunteers gently questioned those left homeless by
the fire. Paramedics, social workers, police officers, social
center staff members and reporters filled the makeshift shelter in
the auditorium of the South Shore Community Center.
   But most of the roughly 200 residents who escaped the Fontana
blaze _ or were evacuated from the neighboring Prince Michael Hotel
_ rarely left their seats for the boxes of doughnuts, cans of fruit
or cocoa on tables set up in front of the auditorium stage.
   Most were still in their pajamas and bathrobes while a pile of
donated clothing and shoes grew hourly on the stage.
   ``What we have on is what we now own,'' said Alfonso Teixeira,
27, tugging at his trousers and T-shirt.
   The Brazilian-born security supervisor and his 29-year-old
fiancee, Ester Cubinhese, had been saving money to get married.
   ``It's all gone: the clothes, the stereo, the television,
everything,'' said Teixeira.
   ``Thank God he was at home last night,'' Cubinhese said quietly
in Portuguese. ``I'd have panicked certainly if I'd been alone.''
   Teixeira said someone banging on their door woke them up.
   ``I saw this guy running in the hall, shouting `Fire. Fire. Big.
Big.' He didn't speak much English. Luckily, our door was right
next to the fire exit.''
   Cubinhese and Teixeira said they had been impressed by the hotel
maintenance during their six months there.
   ``If you had any problem, like a broken light, anything, they
came and fixed it right away,'' Teixeira said.
   But the hotel didn't have a sprinkler system. Sprinklers aren't
required by law until 1991.
   Teixeira's mother also lives in Miami Beach. ``We'll probably
work something out,'' he said.
   At least three hotels offered rooms or efficiency apartments to
those in need. A supermarket offered food and a neighborhood drug
store sent a pharmacist to fill prescriptions for medications left
behind at the Fontana.

<HEAD>Kennedy Blasts Bush Administration on Civil Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy attacked the Bush
administration Thursday for giving mere ``lip service to the fight
to end bigotry'' while the White House renewed both support for
civil rights and its threat to veto a bill the Massachusetts
Democrat is sponsoring.
   ``The administration's veto threat underscores the sharp
contrast between its words and its deeds on civil rights,'' said
Kennedy, whose bill to combat job bias is a major goal of civil
rights forces in Congress this year.
   Kennedy's comments came after presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater told reporters at the White House that the administration
is ``for civil rights legislation'' but ``we are simply not for
that bill.''
   The Kennedy bill is aimed at restoring legal tools that civil
rights forces say were taken away by six Supreme Court decisions
last year. Provisions range from a ban on harassment of employees
to expanding workers' rights to challenge seniority systems based
on discrimination.
   The heart of the bill, based on a case at a salmon cannery in
Alaska, would force employers accused of discrimination to change
their hiring practices or prove that the practices were based on
business necessity.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in his letter to Kennedy
on Tuesday that this provision, aimed at overturning the Supreme
Court's ``Wards Cove'' decision last year, would in effect result
in racial hiring quotas.
   Kennedy said in his statement that while ``giving lip service to
the fight to end bigotry, the administration is clinging to its
do-as-little-as-possible response to the Supreme Court's recent
decisions, which dramatically cut back on long-accepted protections
for working men and women against discrimination on the job.''
   ``The administration is digging in its heels at a time when a
bipartisan majority in the Congress and the country want to see
those decisions overturned and the gaps in our civil rights laws
filled,'' Kennedy said.
   The Bush administration is calling for approval of a more modest
job-discrimination bill, which would address two of last year's
rulings.
   ``We are interested in correcting problems which arose from last
year's Supreme Court cases,'' Fitzwater said.
   Kennedy's Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on
Wednesday approved his measure, 11-5, with support from Sens. David
Durenberger, R-Minn., and James Jeffords, R-Vt. Durenberger told
the panel that the administration would not act on civil rights
without pressure from the committee.
   The measure now has 40 Senate co-sponsors and civil rights
forces say they have enough votes for passage. But conservative
critics led by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, say they hope to ease some
of its provisions in floor action.
   Hatch told the committee that the measure would create a
``bonanza for lawyers'' while Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan.,
declared that it would ``add litigation.''

   Moslem guerrillas fired on a
surrender ceremony in Afghanistan Friday in which 10,000 rebels
were giving up to the Soviet-backed government and more than 12
people were killed, Kabul radio said. The major rebel organization
Jamait-i-Islami said the surrender was a trick, planned five months
ago to trap government forces.
   Two Afghan generals, one of them a deputy security minister;
nine guerrillas and several civilians died in the close-range
battle that broke out during the ceremony in northwestern Herat
province, the official Afghan broadcast said.
   Jamiat-i-islami (Islamic Society) is considered the most
militarily efficient of the seven Pakistan-based resistance groups
and the dominant one in the Herat area.
   Numerous diplomats based in the Afghan capital of Kabul and
foreign journalists were flown especially to Herat for the ceremony
and witnessed the attack, the radio said.
   Western diplomats in Pakistan, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they had reports that up to five Afghan generals
were killed or wounded in the 15-minute gunbattle and in
hand-to-hand combat with knives and pistols.
   Kabul radio made no mention of five generals.
   The radio, monitored in Islamabad, reported, ``A small group of
extremists attacked the welcome ceremony with heavy fire. In the
resulting battle between Afghan troops and extremists, numerous
people were martyred.''
   The broadcast said guerrillas shot and killed Lt. Gen. Jalal
Razaminda, who was also a deputy security minister, and wounded
Herat provincial Gov. Fazle Haq Khaliq Yaar as they embraced
guerrilla leaders who vowed to give up their weapons and join
President Najib's national reconcilation policy.
   A second general died later on a military plane to Kabul, it
said. His identity was not immediately released.
   National reconcilation is a term used by the government in which
local guerrilla groups agree to switch sides and either stop
fighting or help the government fight. The government says tens of
thousands of rebels joined national reconcilation the past year.
   But mujahedeen sources in Quetta, southeast Pakistan, said
Friday's attack was first planned five months ago and was
apparently aimed to avenge a similar attack by government troops 11
years ago.
   According to the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
the guerrillas slowly began infiltrating the area in November and
then sent word recently that they wanted to surrender.
   The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors,
have been fighting to overthrow the government that seized power in
a 1978 coup and installed a Marxist regime. The mujahedeen are
backed by the United States and Saudi Arabia, and are based in
neighboring Pakistan.
   According to Radio Kabul, 2,200 armed guerrillas and 8,000
unarmed rebels gathered on the plains about 25 miles from Herat
city for the surrender ceremony.
   But instead of surrendering their weapons, the guerrilla
fighters turned them on government officials and army troops, the
mujahedeen sources said.
   The guerrillas reportedly were armed with weapons ranging from
side arms to recoilless cannons, missiles and rocket launchers.
   They fired the first shot as the governor embraced an
unidentified rebel commander dressed in a white robe and turban,
according to Western diplomats and mujahedeen leaders in Pakistan.
   The governor's guards immediately fired back and the plain
erupted in great volleys of gunfire from both sides, they said.
   Several civilians, including children, were killed in the
crossfire that was cut short when two Afghan army tanks moved into
the area and broke up the crowd with bursts of fire, the diplomats
said.
   A photographer from Afghan national television was reportedly
shot in the head and seriously wounded.
   Herat district was the first region in Afghanistan to rise
against the Soviet Union in early 1979 before the Red Army
intervened to prop up the Marxist government.
   That uprising cost at least 2,000 Afghan lives when government
troops pretended to join the rebellion against widening Soviet
influence in the country.
   The Kremlin pulled out its troops in February 1989 but continues
to pour an estimated $300 million a month in supplies and weapons
into Kabul.
   The leading rebel commander in the district is Jamiat-i-islami's
Ismail Khan, a former government officer.
   Herat has been fought over, conquered and destroyed since it was
founded by the Persians more than 2,500 years ago. It was captured
and destroyed by Alexander the Great in 330 B.C., by Genghis Khan
in 1221 and by Tamerlane a century later.
   Once famed as Afghanistan's most beautiful city, much of it is
deserted and in ruins. Lack of law and order has earned it the
nickname of ``Afghanistan's Wild West.''

   ``Coupon Connie'' was sentenced Friday to 27
months in prison for her role in a $2 million scheme to swap and
redeem hundreds of thousands of bogus coupons.
   ``I can say a lot of nasty things, but I won't,'' a teary-eyed
Connie Arvidson said after the sentence. She intends to appeal.
   Mrs. Arvidson, 34, of Boca Raton, Fla., was convicted in federal
court of two counts of mail fraud and one of conspiracy.
   Also known as the ``Dumpster Lady,'' Mrs. Arvidson was one of 10
people indicted in a scheme that saw more than 600,000 illegal
copies of coupons distributed nationwide from Texas. The coupons,
for products from 47 companies, were printed in San Antonio.
   Prosecutors said Mrs. Arvidson purchased the bogus coupons from
San Antonio counterfeiter David Rackmill, who pleaded guilty to
mail fraud and conspiracy then acted as an informant in the case.
   In the trial, which began Jan. 8, federal prosecutors contended
Mrs. Arvidson's claims that she dug through the trash to find
coupons to sell were false.
   ``You know what trash looks like,'' prosecutor Paulina Jacobo
told jurors. ``It doesn't come in nice bundles and get shipped by
UPS. Mrs. Arvidson knew what she was doing.''
   Prosecutors said she made as much as $40,000 in one year. But
Mrs. Arvidson estimated the most she ever made was $200 a week from
collecting and trading coupons.
   In addition to the 27-month prison term, she was sentenced to
three years of supervised release, the maximum penalty under the
sentencing formula the judge used. The formula takes into account
her lack of a criminal record.
   Before sentencing, Mrs. Arvidson told U.S. District Judge Sidney
Fitzwater, ``I would never do anything to break the law in any way.
I would never hurt anyone.''
   Mrs. Arvidson called coupon clipping ``my American dream,''
adding that, ``When I saw so many coupons, I guess I just let greed
take over.''
   Fitzwater said Mrs. Arvidson was unrepentant and tried to cover
up when she realized postal inspectors were investigating her, and
that she lied on the witness stand.
   Earlier Friday, Fitzwater sentenced fellow coupon conspirator
David Reese of Center Point to 24 months in prison and two years
supervised release.
   A third defendant, printer James Floyd Richards of San Antonio,
was cleared of all three counts against him. The seven others
indicted in the case agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in
exchange for leniency, and several of them them testified against
Mrs. Arvidson.

   Wrapping up a week of designer fashion shows in
New York Friday, Geoffrey Beene presented sleek, uniform-inspired
clothes and anchored his ensembles with insets in the shape of
triangles.
   ``I always try to keep the collection as contemporary as
possible,'' said Beene, who has opted for stark, dramatic looks
that establish his niche as an American designer.
   Control, discipline, fullness and sensuous severity are Beene's
own words for characterizing the collection, which includes
functional, ankle-length jersey tent dresses in dark tones such as
black or gray, with leather insets. Somber shades of loden, taupe,
wine and chocolate contribute to the sense of austerity.
   Strap-on accessories, such as a strip of leather, sweep over the
shoulder, military-style.
   When you think of Beene, think of triangles, which apper
throughout the collection, at the hipbone, above the bust, along
the neck and within a fluttering hemline. A black evening column
dress showed off a gold triangle quilted onto the bodice, and a
black suit had triangles of red satin at the shoulder blade. It's
all part of Beene's love affair with geometric shapes.
   Beene continued his tradition of shunning traditional lines;
he'll take a curve whenever he can. He showed a wool fleece and
quilted satin bolero with seams streaming from the bust down both
sleeves. And Beene uses curved hems, ``which move fashion from an
applied art to a fine art,'' says fashion arbiter Eleanor Lambert,
creator of the 50-year-old International Best-Dressed List.
   Beene also showed jumpsuits, another longtime favorite, which he
considers ``the most functional piece of clothing in the
collection.''
   Another trademark look is the short, buoyant full evening skirt
of silk combined with a fitted bodice, sometimes with point
d'esprit.
   ``He's the quintessential American designer, superb, tops,''
says Ellin Saltzman, senior vice president and fashion director of
R.H. Macy &amp; Co., Inc.
   Meanwhile, Donna Karan introduced a collection dedicated to
``pure comfort, luxury, and sensuality.'' Chock full of shades of
brown, grays, beiges and taupes, in fabrics such as cashmere,
``furry'' alpaca fleece, wool crepe jersey, lacquer sequins and
velvet, the collection exudes a sense of softness and ease.
   Monochromatic ensembles predominate, with matching opaque hose
and shoes.
   Emphasis is on the unconstructed jacket, in an updated longer
length, worn over a narrow unitard for a neat, linear look. The
unitard is often paired with a short circular skirt with lots of
swing, fairly buoyant with movement. Also capturing the wave of
motion are circular coats over unitards.
   For evening, Karan creates dramatic contrast by teaming black
velvet with white lacquer sequins. A black velvet circular
wrap-around coat with a matching stretch velvet dress was set off
by an oyster lacquer sequin scarf, creating a striking play of tone.
   Karan counts as one of the many American designers, such as
Blass and dell'Olio for Anne Klein, who are knocking down
distinctions between day and nighttime looks. Like Blass, who is
showing strapless gray cashmere for evening, Karan offers an
oversize gray cashmere off-the-shoulder cowl sweater teamed with a
platinum sequin draped skirt.
   Karan's favorite after-five look is a sequins-on-cashmere kimono
top with a short stretch skirt, her version of a combination of
sweatshirt comfort and drop-dead sexiness.

   Authorities are investigating complaints that
guards at a federal holding center for illegal aliens are
physically and psychologically abusing inmates, in some instances
locking them in portable bathrooms.
   U.S. Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla., and a panel of Dade County
officials said they have received complaints that guards at the
Krome Detention Center conducted routine strip searches and beat
inmates, taunting them with comments like ``go back home because
you have no right to be here.''
   Other complaints included locking the inmates in portable
bathrooms and forcing them to kneel and raise their hands while
being ridiculed.
   Fascell said he has asked Attorney General Richard Thornburgh to
investigate.
   Richard Smith, the INS district director in Miami, said he sent
documents alleging abuse to the U.S. Justice Department three weeks
ago and supports an investigation. George Waldroup, a spokesman for
INS in Miami, refused to comment on the investigation Friday.
   The Krome detention center is a converted Nike missile base on
the edge of the Everglades, south of Miami, that serves as a
holding area for illegal aliens, mostly Haitians.
   It was built in the early 1980s at the height of the Mariel
boatlift to house the flood of exiles from Cuba. The facility
generally houses about 450, but that number can double at times.
   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service says it is
required by law to hold illegal aliens there pending expulsion
proceedings.
   ``We Haitians are especially mad because we always get the worst
treatment here,'' said one Haitian quoted in an affidavit. He, like
other detainees quoted in the documents, wasn't named for fear of
reprisal.
   Cheryl Little, an attorney for the Haitian Refugee Center in
Miami, said there are ``alleged acts of physical abuse, mental
abuse, lack of proper medical care, improper access to baths and
showers, not enough time to finish meals, lack of access to
telephones.''
   ``We were told that one Haitian had his head smashed on a metal
banister, and he was carried away on a stretcher,'' she said.
   Little said she has more than 100 affidavits that allege
incidents and name guards involved. She said many of the same names
keep arising in the affidavits.
   ``I'm not suggesting that everyone there is abusive,'' she said.
``There are employees there who may not have engaged in abuse, but
who condoned it.
   The U.S. attorney's office in Miami refused to discuss the
investigation, saying through a spokeswoman, ``We do not have any
charges filed against Krome Detention Center at this time, but the
U.S. Attorney's office would be interested in violation of federal
law at Krome or any other federal facility.''

   The United States and Soviet Union scaled back
expectations Friday for reaching a major missile-reduction
agreement at next month's superpower summit but narrowed
differences over German unification and the flight of Soviet Jews
to Israel.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Moscow had dropped
its insistence that a reunified Germany be neutral. ``There was a
recognition that perhaps neutrality is perhaps not the best route
to go,'' he said.
   Baker also said the two sides had failed to resolve differences
over air-launched and sea-launched cruise missiles, two obstacles
for agreement on a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START). ``That
is a disappointment,'' Baker said.
   Baker will go to the Soviet Union to hold another round of talks
May 16-19 on the weapons issues. ``It's still our hope that major
issues will be resolved by the summit, but that's got to take a lot
of work,'' he said at a news conference.
   In the windup of three days of high-level U.S.-Soviet talks,
President Bush cautioned Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze that a crackdown against the breakaway republic of
Lithuania would be a setback to superpower relations.
   ``I don't think we are telling them what to do. We're telling
them what not to do _ and that is, don't use force,'' Bush said
later.
   ``We have an awful lot at stake in the U.S.-Soviet relationship,
an enormous amount at stake,'' Bush said at an appearance before
the convention of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. ``It
gets into arms control, it gets into human rights, the exit of
Soviet Jews, it gets into regional questions.''
   Separately, Shevardnadze told reporters ``we have a clear
conscience'' on Lithuania. Renewing a pledge to work out a peaceful
settlement, Shevardnadze said, ``I don't think there is a basis for
a deterioration in U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   (And Baker, at the end of three days of talks with the Soviet
diplomat, credited Moscow with trying to resolve the situation
peaceably. ``Of course,'' he added, ``I would be disturbed if I
thought conflict might erupt,'' he said.
   The president and the foreign minister met at the White House
for 2 hours and 20 minutes _ more than twice as long as scheduled _
in preliminary discussions for Bush's five-day summit with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev beginning May 30.
   ``This summit will certainly become a major event in world
affairs,'' Shevardnadze said afterward, standing under an umbrella
in a cold rain outside the White House.
   Similarly, Bush said later, ``this is an important time for
discussion and dialogue.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush viewed
Friday's meeting as ``extensive, cordial and productive.''
   ``I don't think there have been any breakthroughs,'' Fitzwater
said, adding that much of the meeting had been focused on setting
the agenda for the summit.
   Both the United States and Soviet Union expressed reservations
about being able to resolve the major issues for a new treaty to
reduce long-range nuclear weapons before the summit, a goal they
set for themselves when Bush met Gorbachev last year in Malta.
   Shevardnadze said ``I would not hide from you the fact that ...
we have encountered certain difficulties, certain problems'' in
Washington for a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
   ``This is a time of hard choices, the hard choices that one has
to make in the concluding stages of the talks,'' the foreign
minister said. He said the problem was compounded by the need to
write a treaty that would be approved by a newly independent Soviet
parliament.
   Nevertheless, he predicted, ``in the end there will be real
certainty that we will have a solid agreement, a durable
agreement.''
   Fitzwater said both sides still hope for agreement on major
provisions of the treaty by the summit. However, he said, ``the
nature of some of these issues is difficult enough that there's
certainly no guarantee at this time that we'll have a final treaty
ready to sign.''
   He said, ``That is our hope and that is our goal, but I'm not
sure at this point in time we can say that we can expect it.''
   Shevardnadze gave Bush a letter from Gorbachev on the subject of
arms control, but both sides declined to disclose its contents.
   Shevardnadze said that at the summit Bush and Gorbachev would be
able to sign a draft agreement on trade, cooperation in science and
technology, arms control and bilateral relations.
   The foreign minister took a conciliatory stance on the
unification of East Germany, a Soviet ally, with West Germany, the
linchpin of NATO.
   ``We have to look for a solution, a solution that would be
acceptable'' to both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, Shevardnadze said.
   He did not offer any specifics beyond a suggestion that perhaps
the merged country could be part both of NATO and the Warsaw Pact,
and said: It is possible that we will be able to find a mutually
acceptable way, a way that will make sure that a unified Germany is
a factor for stability in Europe and that it never threatens
anyone.''
   Baker said that while the Soviets had eased their demand that a
unified Germany be neutral, they continued to object to its
membership in NATO. He said the idea of Germany being in both
alliances was not ``attractive.''
   ``We were equally firm in our view that the unified Germany must
remain a member of NATO,'' Baker said.
   In another area, Shevardnadze said the Soviets were willing to
implement an agreement for direct flights of Jewish refugees to
Israel provided Israel gave assurances they would not be settled
``in the occupied territories.''
   He said he included East Jerusalem as part of the occupied
territories, as well as the West Bank and Gaza.
   Shevardnadze also held out the prospect of resuming normal
diplomatic ties with Israel after a 23-year lapse _ depending on
``the overall Middle East situation.''
   On the thorny issue of Lithuania, there was little indication of
any movement. ``It was primarily (for) both sides to repeat their
positions,'' he said.
   Bush said he told Gorbachev the United States supports the right
of Lithuania to self-determination and never recognized its
incorporation into the Soviet Union.
   ``And I told Minister Shevardnadze that this is an issue that
could adversely affect the prospects for progress in these
important U.S.-Soviet relations,'' Bush told the newspaper editors.
   ``And I urged the Soviet Union to begin a good faith dialogue
with Lithuania. We want and we believe the Soviets want to make
further progress in U.S.-Soviet relations.''

   A teen-ager was sentenced to six months in
jail as a result of a neighbor taking photographs of him beating
his family dog, authorities said.
   Animal rights advocates said it was the first time in at least
20 years that anyone in Massachusetts had been imprisoned for
abusing an animal.
   ``This shows that something can be done in cases like these, and
it certainly sends a message to people that animal cruelty will not
be tolerated,'' said Allan Davidson, director of the Lowell Humane
Society, where Champ is in protective custody.
   Kevin Deschene, 19, of Lowell, was sentenced Thursday on a
conviction for a misdemeanor complaint of cruelty to animals.
   Deschene's neighbor, Jim Molloy, said he had seen Deschene on
several occasions beating and kicking the German shepherd while it
was chained to a post.
   Molloy took pictures of Deschene kicking and beating Deschene's
family's dog, named Champ, with a plank last fall.
   ``I had no idea that beating the dog was a crime when I took the
pictures,'' said Molloy. ``I just hoped they would take the dog
away and save the poor thing.''
   Deschene and his family have contended the teen-ager was
disciplining the dog for tearing up garbage.
   Deschene's attorney argued in court that, as in domestic
disputes involving people, there should be no conviction because
the victim was not seriously injured.
   Judge James Killam said Champ was helpless and was without the
option of leaving or obtaining a restraining order, as do people in
abusive situations.
   In addition to the jail term, Killam fined Deschene $500 and
ordered him to perform one day of community service per month for
two years.
   Champ's fate will be decided at a custody hearing May 3, when
Duschene's family will attempt to retrieve the dog from the custody
of the Humane Society.

   More than 60 singers and bands, including
Willie Nelson, Jackson Browne and Bonnie Raitt, take the stage
Saturday in a nationally televised concert to raise money for the
American farmer.
   The Farm Aid concert, which has been dormant for the last two
years, was organized by Nelson, John Mellencamp and Neil Young and
will feature three winners from the recent Grammy Awards: Raitt,
Don Henley and Lyle Lovett.
   A sellout crowd of 45,000 also will hear Dwight Yoakum, K.T.
Oslin, Lou Reed, Guns N' Roses, Richard Marx, Jackson Browne, John
Denver, and a Soviet band called Gorky Park.
   The Nashville Network, a cable channel, will telecast the full
12 hours live. Hosts include Dick Clark, heavyweight boxing
champion James ``Buster'' Douglas, comedian Fred Travelena and
actors Dennis Weaver and Michele Green.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson and Texas Agriculture Commissioner James
Hightower are scheduled to speak.
   This Farm Aid concert, the fourth, is the first to be staged in
2{ years, but the organization has been an ongoing enterprise, said
Janet Corpus, its program officer.
   Farm Aid has raised some $12 million since its first concert in
September 1985 at Champaign, Ill. Of that, $9 million has been
distributed to more than 100 farm organizations, hotlines, service
agencies and churches in 41 states. A quarter of the money has gone
to fill the emergency needs of financially strapped farmers, while
22 percent has been earmarked for education.
   Previous concerts were held in held in Austin, Texas, in 1986,
and in Lincoln, Neb., the next year.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday he would issue the
executive order he promised last fall to guarantee that Chinese
students who fear for their safety if they return home may remain
in the United States.
   ``I did say I was going to have an executive order. What we had
was an executive directive from the president,'' Bush said.
   In a written statement later, the president said he had
recognized that his directive had not addressed two important
issues: extending deportation action against Chinese nationals
until Jan. 1, 1994, and taking steps to alleviate concerns about
China revoking passports.
   The comments came in the wake of news stories that Bush failed
to issue the executive order to assure no Chinese students would be
returned to their homeland against their will.
   He told newspaper editors that the executive order will protect
students from deportation beyond the current deferral of enforced
departure that is scheduled to expire June 5.
   Bush's previous directive said students in this country as of
June 5 last year would be protected from deportation. Students who
arrived after that date, which is when Beijing began its violent
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, are not specifically
covered in Bush's executive order.
   But an administration official who spoke on condition of
anonmyity said the later arrivals ``will be given the same
consideration'' on visa waivers as those here as of June 5, 1989,
who are specifically written into the order.
   Answering questions at a gathering of the American Society of
Newspaper Editors, Bush also said he soon will announce an offshore
oil drilling policy that will include banning drilling in some
environmentally sensitive areas and will redfine sea lanes for
tankers in other regions.
   Bush last year ordered a task force to study offshore drilling
with an eye to environmental protection. He has yet to announce the
findings of the study or any policy moves.
   Bush, a former Texas oil man, said there should not be a
permanent ban on offshore drilling, ``because then I would be
compelled to ask the question, `Where do we get the energy to keep
this country going?' I don't think there should be a ban.''
   However, he added, ``there will definitely be bans on certain
environmentally sensitive areas.''
   He said he would push for tanker sea lanes to be rerouted in the
Florida Everglades, hinting at the same prospect for California's
coast.
   On the China matter, Bush said he would issue an executive order
incorporating all the provisions in his November presidential
directive telling the Justice Department how to deal with Chinese
students in the United States.
   ``We don't want to take a chance on people being mistreated,
brutalized,'' Bush said.
   The promise came a day after his press secretary, Marlin
Fitzwater, told reporters that an executive order was ``not the
right tool'' to accomplish what the president had done by directive.
   However, Bush was criticized by congressional sponsors of
legislation he vetoed Nov. 30 that would have put into law
assurances the Chinese nationals could remain here when their visas
expire.
   On other matters, Bush told the editors:
   _Former President Carter was ``not acting with the blessing of
nor disapproval of or anything else of the administration'' during
his trip this week to the Middle East, where he met with Palestine
Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat.
   ``He was acting in this meeting on his own. I knew nothing about
that. And certainly a former president should be free to do his
thing.''
   _He is not linking aid to Israel to U.S. hopes that Israel works
out a negotiating format for peace with Palestinians.
   _He hoped a compromise budget plan to reduce the huge federal
deficit could be forced, but he noted that one congressional
deadline had already been missed and another was fast approaching.

   Palestinian extremists led by terrorist
Abu Nidal said Friday that preparations were under way to release
at least three French and Belgian hostages they hold in response to
an appeal from Moammar Gadhafi.
   Walid Khaled, Beirut spokesman for Fatah-Revolutionary Council,
said in a statement issued in Beirut and delivered to the offices
of a Western news agency, ``I am pleased to announce the acceptance
of our movement in response to (Gadhafi's) appeal.
   ``I am also pleased to declare that the contacts and
arrangements under way now include Mrs. Jacqueline Valente, her
boyfriend Fernand Houtekins, and their baby Sony Houtekins.''
   The statement said the radical Palestinian group ``hopes that
this will draw the attention of the Belgian government that it
should fulfill its pledges ... and curb Zionist activities against
the revolution of our people.''
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council has said previously that it holds
Ms. Valente, a 32-year-old Frenchwoman; her two daughters born in
captivity; and five Belgians.
   The names of the two girls were previously reported as Liberte
and Palestine. The name used Friday, Sony, was new.
   Two other daughters of Ms. Valente were freed after Libyan
intervention on Dec. 29, 1988. Daughter Marie-Laure was 6 at the
time, and Virginie, 5. They were returned to their father, Pascal
Betille, who had divorced Ms. Valente.
   Ms. Valente has been living with Fernand Houtekins, one of the
five Belgian captives.
   Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, on Wednesday asked that Ms. Valente
be freed as a compassionate measure on the occasion of the Moslem
holy month of Ramadan, which ends in late April. Gadhafi's call was
carried by the official Libyan news agency JANA.
   Abu Nidal _ whose real name is Sabri al-Banna _ is backed by
Libya and believed to be living in Tripoli, the Libyan capital.
   Fatah-Revolutionary Council said on Nov. 8, 1987, that it seized
the hostages aboard the French yacht Silco off the Gaza Strip and
said they were collaborating with Israel's Mossad secret service.
Friends denied it, saying the hostages were on a holiday cruise.
   These hostages are believed to be in Libya and so are not listed
among the 18 Westerners missing in Lebanon, including eight
Americans.
   The Belgians are Emmanuel Houtekins, in his 40s; his wife,
Godlieve Kets; his son, Laurent, in his late teens; his daughter,
Valerie, a teen-ager; and his brother Fernand, in his 40s.
   Meanwhile in Geneva, the International Committee of the Red
Cross on Friday expressed doubt about the authenticity of a renewed
threat to kill one of two Red Cross relief workers taken hostage in
Lebanon exactly six months ago.
   Work at the humanitarian agency's Geneva headquarters came to a
halt as staff protested the ``odious act'' and the ``prolonged
anxiety caused by the kidnappers' continuing silence,'' an ICRC
statement said.
   The statement said the ICRC was analyzing a telephone message
received by a Western news agency in Nicosia, Cyprus, late Thursday
from a man claiming to speak for the Action Group for the Release
of Hariri.
   The caller demanded the release of Mohammed Hariri, jailed for
life in Switzerland for a 1987 air hijacking, and Anis Naccache,
jailed for life in France for trying to assassinate an Iranian
emgire leader in Paris. He said if the demands were not met, one of
the Swiss hostages would be executed after Ramadan.
   The ICRC ``has not found any proof that the caller is linked in
any way with the kidnappers of Elio Erriquez and Emanuel Christen,
nor has any tangible evidence ... been provided to corroborate the
authenticity of the caller's claims,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>Study Finds Most Murder Defendants Younger Than 30</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the murder defendants in the nation's
largest counties are younger than 30, and a third overall are under
age 21, according to a Justice Department study released Friday.
   In fact, two-thirds of all the felony defendants in those
counties during February 1988, when the study was begun, were under
age 30, says the study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The
average age was 28.
   While a third of the murder defendants were younger than 21, the
study also found that another third were between the ages of 21 and
29.
   The report studied about 11,000 felony cases in 39
jurisdictions, and said that sample represented more than 47,000
cases filed in February 1988 in the 75 most populous counties. The
report gave percentages only and did not include the raw figures on
which they were based.
   The most serious arrest charge at the time of arrest was a
property offense for 36 percent and a drug offense for 35 percent.
A violent offense was the most serious charge for 21 percent, with
murder the most serious offense charged against 1.4 percent.
   Approximately six of every seven defendants were male, and 95
percent of those arrested on a murder charge were male.
   Two-thirds of those arrested were known to have been arrested
previously, and about half were known to have at least one prior
conviction. For 65 percent of those with a prior conviction, it was
on a felony count. Approximately one-fifth of all defendants had
more than one prior felony conviction.
   The defendants' progress through the system was monitored
through January 1989.
   About 4 percent of all defendants were held without bail,
including 26 percent of murder defendants.
   For murder defendants overall, 61 percent remained incarcerated,
26 percent without bail and 35 percent with bail, which averaged
$75,000 for those who remained in jail.
   Thirty-nine percent of murder defendants were released before
the case was disposed of, with 7 percent freed on their own
recognizance and 32 percent on a financial basis such as posting
bond. Bail for those murder defendants who got out averaged $10,000.
   Meanwhile, felony defendants with no prior convictions were
released in 77 percent of the cases, compared with 46 percent of
those with a prior conviction for a violent felony.
   The study found that two-thirds of all felony defendants were
released from custody before their case was disposed of, 53 percent
on nonfinancial terms and the rest on bail.
   While about three-fourths of the released defendants made all
scheduled court appearances, a third of those who did not remained
fugitives at the end of the study period.
   For murder charges, 78 percent of those released made all court
appearances. Most of those who missed a court appearance eventually
returned to court, but 4 percent of all murder defendants remained
fugitives after one year.
   As for convictions, 70 percent of those arrested on all felonies
were convicted, 54 percent for a felony and 16 percent for a
misdemeanor.
   For those arrested on a murder charge, 66 percent were convicted
of a crime. Of those convicted, three-quarters were convicted of
murder.
   Counties participating in the study were Arizona: Maricopa;
California: Los Angeles, Orange, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San
Diego, and Santa Clara; District of Columbia; Florida: Broward,
Dade, Duval, Hillsborough, Palm Beach and Pinellas; Georgia:
Fulton; Hawaii: Honolulu; Illinois: Cook; Massachusetts: Suffolk;
Michigan: Wayne; Missouri: St. Louis; New Jersey: Essex; New York:
Bronx, Erie, Kings, Monroe, New York, Queens; Ohio: Hamilton;
Pennsylvania: Allegheny, Montgomery, Philadelphia; Tennessee:
Shelby; Texas: Dallas, Harris, Tarrant; Utah: Salt Lake; Virginia:
Fairfax; Washington: King; Wisconsin: Milwaukee.

<HEAD>Drug Traffickers Said to Be Preparing New Peace Offer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A kidnapped senator released by the
Medellin cocaine cartel said Friday the group is preparing a new
peace proposal in its war with the government.
   The announcement came two days after President Virgilio Barco
indicated the government might be easing off its policy of
extraditing drug suspects to the United States.
   Also Friday, a presidential candidate called for legalizing
drugs in Colombia, saying the government has lost its war against
the drug traffickers.
   Authorities meanwhile announced traffickers were responsible for
placing a huge truck bomb Thursday morning in a wealthy Bogota
neighborhood. They said it was safely deactivated.
   The truck, loaded with 1,650 pounds of dynamite, was capable of
killing 5,000 people had it exploded in the suburb where it was
placed, secret police chief Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez said at a news
conference Friday.
   Maza's own apartment is just off the avenue where the truck was
abandoned.
   Sen. Federico Estrada was kidnapped by the cartel in Medellin on
Tuesday and released Thursday. Drug traffickers told him that they
were readying a new peace plan to present to the government,
Estrada said at a news conference Friday.
   However, he said he did not know the details of the proposal.
   On Jan. 17, the cartel's leaders offered to surrender themselves
and their illicit business in exchange for an end to extradition of
suspects to the United States. The government said the extradiction
of suspects was not negotiable.
   However, that position seemed to change Wednesday, when Barco
said Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar would be tried in
Colombia if he turned himself in. The president made the statement
while on a state visit to France.
   A cartel communique last week pledged new terrorist attacks in
retaliation for the government's refusal to end its policy of
extraditing traffickers.
   Barco's government has sent 15 trafficking suspects to the
United States for trial since intensifying its crackdown in August,
when traffickers killed a leading presidential candidate.
   Since then, more than 200 people have been killed by terrorist
attacks blamed on traffickers.
   The cartel had threatened to bomb a Bogota neighborhood and to
kill police as part of the renewed offensive. Gunmen working for
the traffickers shot 16 police officers and a soldier this week in
the northwestern city of Medellin, authorities said.
   At his news conference, Estrada indicated that Barco's latest
statement may have dissuaded the traffickers from carrying out more
attacks.
   In a television broadcast Friday night on ``Programa'',
conservative presidential candidate Alvaro Gomez Hurdado, a
70-year-old lawyer and journalist conducting his third race for the
presidency, said the government had lost its war with the
traffickers.
   ``This war is not being won,'' he said. ``We must look for a new
approach that quickly leads to solutions that are not as evil as
some have said, proposals made by respectable people who have won
Nobel prizes.''

<TEXT>
   Minnesota Democrats are formally asking the
House to investigate allegations that Rep. Arlan Stangeland,
R-Minn., improperly charged Congress for hundreds of phone calls to
and from the home of a woman lobbyist.
   The complaint being filed with the House Committee on Standards
of Official Conduct also accuses Stangeland of exchanging favors
with a former congressman who now works as a lobbyist.
   The allegations were made public in newspaper articles last
January. Stangeland, who is seeking re-election, has denied any
impropriety.
   ``I don't think the questions have been answered,'' Ruth
Stanoch, chairwoman of the Minnesota Democratic Party, said Friday.
``They're still lingering right now.''
   Stangeland has said he welcomed the ethics investigation even
though he believed it was unnecessary.
   Stangeland says that his relationship with Eve Jarvis, who now
works for the House of Representatives, was professional, although
he acknowledged making 341 calls to or from her home during five
months in 1986 and 1987.
   Stangeland said initially that some of the phone calls might
have been personal but has since insisted that they were all made
for business purposes. Ms. Jarvis has refused to talk to reporters.
   Stangeland also denied he did anything wrong in using a car
owned by former Rep. Gene Snyder, R-Ky., and in letting the
lobbyist use his Capitol parking space.
   Ms. Stanoch said the complaint was filed with the committee but
returned to the state party for Democratic leaders to verify that
they could not get a member of Congress to request the
investigation.

<HEAD>Israel General Warns that Combined Arab Attack Lies Ahead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army's deputy chief of staff said Friday
that a combined Syrian, Jordanian and Iraqi force could threaten
Israel's borders in the years ahead, but played down Iraq's present
capability to destroy Israel.
   The comments over Israel television by Gen. Enud Barak came in
reponse to threats this week by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq,
who said his country had chemical weapons and would destroy ``half
of Israel'' if attacked.
   ``I think (Saddam) will weigh a decision more than twice before
he even thinks about attacking Israel with chemical weapons,''
Barak said in the interview, a rare TV appearance by a high-ranking
military officer.
   Barak said in talking of a possible combined Arab push against
Israel, ``We must prepare ourselves for it as if it will come to
pass. However, we should not see in these preparations a certainty
that this will happen.''
   Barak called Saddam a sane and experienced leader who knew how
to size up the Jewish state's military capabilities with those of
Iraq better than any Israeli citizen.
   However, Barak emphasized the need to stop Iraq's attempts to
build nuclear capability before it was too late.
   He praised a joint U.S.-British operation that resulted in five
arrests in a purported plot to smuggle detonators for nuclear
weapons to Baghdad.
   ``There is no doubt that Iraq has not ceased its attempt to
reach nuclear capability. Actions like that of the Americans and
British are important and proper,'' the general said.
   On Tuesday, government officials called for a special program to
distribute gas masks to every Israeli citizen in preparation for a
surprise attack.
   The Friday newscast repeated instructions on use of gas masks
after Barak's interview.

   Parliament voted Friday to eliminate the
dreaded SB secret police; the old, uniformed Interior Ministry and
the Citizens' Militia in a dramatic assertion of civilian control
by the Solidarity-led government.
   The Interior Ministry is to become a smaller, civilian-run
office. It had been staffed by uniformed functionaries along
military lines and was considered part of the national defense
system.
   The new ministry will oversee the newly created police and
Office of State Protection; firefighters, and a border guard that
will be separated from the army.
   Members of the Citizens' Militia the paramilitary force
previously charged with fighting crime and enforcing the law, can
automatically become police officers similar to those in Western
countries.
   Secret police officers hired before August 1989, when Poland got
its first non-communist prime minister in four decades, will be
dismissed. Only those officers who pass a review process proving
they are innocent of past abuses will be rehired into the new,
smaller Office of State Protection.
   The SB monitored and harassed dissidents and even ordinary
citizens to maintain the Communist Party's grip on power in Poland.
The Office of State Protection is to limit its activities to
fighting espionage and authentic threats to national security.
   The changes were adopted in three separate bills.
   SB officers murdered the pro-Solidarity priest the Rev. Jerzy
Popieluszko in 1984 and were suspected in scores of political
killings. A parliamentary commission is working to uncover past SB
abuses.
   As a safeguard, the new Interior Ministry is to include a
civilian advisory commission.
   Local governments for the first time will be permitted to
establish their own police force.
   The secret police force was pared from 24,000 officers last June
to 3,100 this year, the government has said. Some reportedly took
early retirement and some were permitted to transfer to the
Citizens Militia after retraining.
   The Citizen's Militia has an estimated 80,000 officers
nationwide.

   Troops at a roadblock near the
presidential mansion opened fire Friday on an American, who died
while undergoing surgery for his wounds, the U.S. Embassy said.
   Also Friday, the government said rebels in an eastern war zone
ambushed a freight train and three people aboard were reported
kidnapped, including the West Africa correspondent for the U.S.
news agency United Press International.
   The developments occur at a time when relations between the
United States and this West African nation founded by freed
American slaves are at their lowest level since President Samuel
Doe seized power in a bloody April 1980 coup.
   The U.S. statement said soldiers manning a roadblock near Doe's
residence in Monrovia, the capital, opened fire after midnight on a
vehicle driven by Martin Joseph Millay, wounding him in the leg.
   Millay suffered a heart attack and died during surgery for his
wounds, the statement said. A U.S. Embassy official, reached by
telephone from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, said he did not know Millay's
age or hometown, only that he worked for a small charter airline,
Gibacol Air Services.
   Last week, an elderly American missionary and his British wife
were killed in a shootout between Liberian troops and rebels in
eastern Nimba county. It was not known who killed the Rev. Tom
Jackson and his wife, June. They were Protestant missionaries who
had worked in Liberia for 40 years.
   In addition, two U.S. Embassy warehouses in Monrovia were gutted
in a March fire that destroyed $3 million worth of goods. Embassy
officials suspect arson.
   Acting Information Minister Moses Washington told reporters
Friday that rebels ambushed a train carrying empty iron ore carts
from the port of Buchanan to a state-owned mine in Yekepa, Nimba
county.
   The rebels demanded food from the conductors and three
passengers, including Mark Huband, a Briton who was UPI's West
African correspondent and also worked for the London Financial
Times.
   One of the conductors escaped, but the whereabouts of the other
people on the train was unknown, the minister said.
   Huband, 26, had been on assignment from Abidjan, where he is
based, a UPI spokesman said Friday night from Washington.
   Rebels fighting since December to overthrow Doe had threatened
to blow up the train for the Yekepa mine, a well-guarded complex in
the north of Nimba County managed by foreigners, including Britons
and Americans.
   The United States, which in the past has been a major supporter
of Doe, cut aid to Liberia this year, citing human rights
violations and failure to repay debts.

   A small group of inmates remained
loose in riot-torn Strangeways Prison on Friday, shouting from the
rooftop while authorities tried to drown them out with rock music
and a helicopter siren.
   During the day, up to 18 prisoners appeared on the roof, which
was torn up by prisoners during the earlier rioting. They mostly
milled Friday in the bright sunshine on the sixth day of the
uprising.
   The Home Office, which runs prisons, reported that two more
prisoners surrendered Friday. For the second day, it said ``fewer
than 40'' remained loose.
   The jail, built for 970 inmates, housed 1,648 when the rioting
began.
   Ivor Serle, chairman of the local chapter of the Prison Officers
Association, said authorities had identified at least 18 prisoners
still inside.
   ``We are staying patient. We are not going to take anyone by
force because we don't want anyone injured,'' Serle said.
   On Thursday, prisoner Paul Taylor, 28, a self-professed leader
of the uprising, shouted through a makeshift bullhorn that he had
not meant to start a riot.
   Taylor said he grabbed the minister's microphone during a church
service Sunday as a prelude to a planned sit-in to protest prison
conditions.
   Taylor tried to speak again Friday, but authorities turned on
rock music and a helicopter siren to drown him out. Police also
turned away friends and relatives who have been waving and shouting
words of encouragement to the prisoners.
   ``The vast majority in there, I have no doubt, want to come
out,'' said Barry Cuttle, an attorney who has been involved in the
negotiations. ``It's a very minute minority ruling the majority.''
   Cuttle said the demands of most of the remaining inmates were no
more extreme than those made by men who had surrendered. They are
requesting such things as a bath, a good meal and permission to
contact their families.
   The negotiations were calm, he said, with individual prisoners
coming to talk to staff on the ground floor and then returning to
report to the others.
   At least one prisoner was killed in the uprising. But a lawyer
for some of the inmates who surrendered said they reported other
killings.
   Attorney Frank Sinclair said two inmates told him they saw two
men hanged and three thrown off balconies. Enraged prisoners then
hurled cell doors and beds down on the men, he quoted the inmates
as saying.
   ``I can't believe they could all make up stories about people
being hung and killed,'' said Sinclair.
   Prisoner Derek White, 46, died in North Manchester Hospital on
Tuesday of injuries he received at the hands of other inmates when
the riot began. He was in the prison awaiting trial on charges of
assaulting three children.

   Moslem extremists abducted a leading
businessman and an educator Friday and threatened to kill them, a
day after authorities killed six militants crossing into Pakistan
for arms and training, police said.
   Roads were blocked around Srinagar, where the hostages were
seized, and soldiers tightened security around the Kashmir Valley,
where the government launched a crackdown Jan. 20 on the Moslem
separatist movement.
   A telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were also
holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within 24
hours of a Monday afternoon deadline for releasing three jailed
militants.
   The caller claimed to speak for the Students Liberation Front, a
branch of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front fighting for autonomy
in the predominantly Moslem state. India itself is overwhelmingly
Hindu.
   Police sources, who demanded anonymity, and the telephone caller
both identified the new kidnap victims as Vice Chancellor Mushir
ul-Haq of Kashmir University and L.M. Khela, general manager of
Hindustan Machine Tools Co.
   The caller said ul-Haq's private secretary also was being held
hostage, but that could not be confirmed.
   Moslem separatists had warned Indian government officials to
leave Jammu-Kashmir state before April or ``face the consequences.''
   Police said the border violence took place in Kupwara district,
where at least 20 separatists tried to sneak into neighboring
Pakistan to receive military training and buy weapons. No details
were available.
   India says Pakistan trains and arms the militants in Kashmir, at
the far northern tip of India. Pakistan denies it. India and
Pakistan have fought two wars over the region since 1947, when both
nations won independence from Britain.

   Twenty-one soldiers were
injured Friday, four critically, when their canvas-topped military
truck skidded on an icy highway and landed upside down in a small
stream, authorities reported.
   All were from a Royal Canadian Horse Artillery regiment based at
Petawawa, Ontario, and were on assignment to train servicemen at
the artillery school in Gagetown, a military base south of
Fredericton. They were en route to a firing range when the accident
occurred at Geary, about nine miles from Fredericton.
   The truck's cab was crushed in the accident and the rear, where
most of the soldiers were sitting, was flattened, investigators
said.
   All the passengers and the driver were thrown clear, said Maj.
Dave Krauter.
   Four soldiers were in critical condition with spinal injuries
and were taken to larger hospitals outside the immediate area for
possible neurosurgery, said Jackie Steward, spokesman for Dr.
Everett Chalmers Hospital in Saint John.

   Two of three women accused of attacking a man
with an ax in a ritual honoring Jack the Ripper pleaded guilty
Friday and agreed to testify against the third.
   Catherine Lipsham, 22, and Ramona Barry, 27, both of Milwaukee,
pleaded guilty in Circuit Court to attempted first-degree
intentional homicide in the May 29 attack on the 26-year-old man
whose name was being withheld.
   Assistant District Attorney Mark Williams agreed to seek seek at
most eight years in prison for each of the two women in exchange
for their testimony against Deborah Kazuck, 26.
   Ms. Kazuck's trial is set to begin Monday with jury selection in
Madison. Sentencing for Ms. Lipsham and Ms. Barry is set for May 25.
   According to the criminal complaint, the three woman told police
they planned to dismember the victim's body, drain his blood and
eat his kidneys in a ritual they believed would bring Jack the
Ripper back to life.
   The women called the attack a ``kacking'' a combination of
``killing'' and ``Jack,'' the complaint said.
   Police said Ms. Kazuck told officers she wanted to commit the
attack to prove her love for Jack the Ripper, the famous 19th
century British serial killer, whom she said she believed was her
son in a previous life.
   The complaint said Ms. Barry lured the man to an apartment she
shared with Ms. Lipsham on the city's south side, saying she was
alone and frightened by a storm.
   The man told police that he heard something move in the shower
while he was in the bathroom. He said he pushed the curtain and
found the other two women.
   Ms. Kazuck allegedly held an hatchet with a two-handed grip,
raised it above her head, began chanting ``redrum'' and struck the
man on his forehead just above his left eye, police said.
   ``Redrum'' _ murder spelled backward _ is an term taken from
``The Shining,'' Steven King's novel about supernatural violence,
the complaint said.
   The man told police he ran into the street and flagged down an
ambulance, which took him to a hospital. The gash required 50
stitches.
   All three defendants originally pleaded innocent by reason of
insanity and were evaluated for competence by two psychiatrists.
Each was found competent to stand trial.

   A former commander in Abu Nidal's organization
says the terrorist is a psychopathic killer, according to a report
broadcast Friday.
   CBS Evening News reported that Abu Nidal has $200 million in
Swiss francs and is preparing another terrorist attack.
   ``He is a person with a sick mind,'' the former commander, Atef
Abu Bakr told CBS. ``He's like a snake that bites and disappears, a
schizophrenic that would kill comrades, put them in the hole and
put flowers on top.''
   Abu Bakr said he split with Abu Nidal in December because the
leader was killing members of his own group and their families.
   He said reports that Abu Nidal is under arrest in Libya are
false and that the terrorist could be anywhere because he has
numerous false passports.
   ``It's easy for him to move around, his face is not known,'' he
said.
   Abu Nidal is leader of the Fatah Revolutionary Council, a group
that has been in turmoil since he ordered dozens of his followers
killed during the last two years.
   Some terrorist experts say that some Abu Nidal operatives have
joined the Syrian-based Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, led by Ahmed Jebril.
   FBI and intelligence officials believe the General Command
carried out the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over
Scotland that killed 270 people.

   A police househunt was called off after a
contractor discovered that the cottage he had reported stolen had
been moved to another lot through a misunderstanding.
   Gulfport Police Chief George Payne said Friday the contractors
appeared to have settled their differences and he considered the
matter closed.
   The misunderstanding began Thursday when Larry LaFontaine,
acting on behalf of his hospitalized brother-in-law, Murray Ladner
of Young's House Movers in Pass Christian, filed a complaint that a
cottage Ladner had purchased had been stolen.
   Ladner said Thursday the cottage had been jacked up in
preparation to be moved, but was stolen before his house-moving
equipment could get there.
   ``Apparently, it was a case of missed contacts between Ladner
and some other people,'' Payne said. ``The people who took the
house said they had tried several times to contact him when it was
removed.''
   Calls to Ladner's hospital room went unanswered Friday. Payne
declined to release the name of the other house mover.

   A preview exhibit of Robert Mapplethorpe's
sexually explicit photographs opened Friday night, just hours after
a judge's ruling gave prosecutors a free hand to act against the
show.
   The photos, once denounced by U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and the
target of a large local protest, drew an overflow crowd for a
preview open only to members of the Contemporary Arts Center. It
was to open to the public Saturday.
   An hour after the show opened, a museum attendant estimated
1,000 people had already seen the photos and a block-long line
formed outside. There was no protest at the preview began, though
several hundred demonstrators showed up earlier Friday for a court
hearing. More than 3,000 tickets were sold.
   At the hearing, Hamilton County Municipal Judge Edward Donnellon
dismissed a lawsuit by the arts center seeking a ruling on whether
the show was obscene. The suit was seen as an attempt to pre-empt
any effort by local authorities to close the show. Donnellon
dismissed the suit for lack of legal standing.
   After the ruling, prosecutors declined to say whether they would
press obscenity charges.
   ``We can do a lot of things. I'm not going to tell you what
we're going to do,'' Hamilton County Prosecutor Arthur Ney Jr.
said. ``I can't discuss anything that I may, could, should or might
do.''
   Arts center lawyer Marc Mezibov said the exhibit will open to
the public as scheduled.
   ``The show will go on,'' Mezibov said. ``I would assume as
public officials if they intend to bring criminal charges they
would have brought that to the attention of the court.''
   However, another lawyer representing the arts center said he
feared authorities will move against the exhibit.
   ``In this county you always live with a certain degree of
fear,'' said the lawyer, H. Louis Sirkin.
   Hamilton County is a hub for anti-pornography activities. A
citizens group has dubbed nine of Mapplethorpe's works obscene and
demanded that they be banned from the 175-photograph exhibit.
   Last month, Sheriff Simon Leis Jr. declared that the photographs
were criminally obscene. That was one reason the art center went to
court, expecting charges.
   In June, the Mapplethorpe exhibit was canceled at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
   The exhibit of the work by Mapplethorpe, who died of AIDS in
March 1989, prompted Congress to limit funding to the arts after
Helms, R-N.C., declared the photographs obscene.
   It has been shown in Philadelphia, Chicago, Hartford, Conn.,
Berkeley, Calif., and Boston.
   The exhibit includes photographs of homosexual and
sadomasochistic sex acts.
   Several hundred supporters and opponents of the Mapplethorpe
exhibit gathered in front of the courthouse Friday afternoon during
the hearing. Police kept the two sides separate.
   Supporters carried banners that said, ``If you give artists
freedom of expression, soon every American will want it.''
Opponents' signs said, ``We want decency in Cincinnati,'' and ``God
is against pornography. So are we.''
   The show is scheduled to run through May 26. Warning signs about
the photos' content are posted at the center door, and no one under
age 18 will be admitted.
   During the hearing, Assistant City Solicitor Karl Kadon accused
the arts center of making the photographic exhibit a public issue.
He said he also objected to the top law enforcement officials of
the city and county being ``painted as Neanderthal barbarians of
some sort.''
   Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Robert Taylor, representing the
county, also took umbrage at the art center's lawsuit.
   ``We're not going to let the CAC or anybody from New York come
into Hamilton County and dictate to our elected officials what we
will and will not do,'' Taylor said.

<HEAD>Judge Orders News Organizations to Turn Over Film of Tax Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday ordered 25 newspapers and
television stations to give police all film and photographs of last
weekend's anti-tax riot in London.
   A dozen organizations immediately opposed the order, two said
they were willing to hand over what they published and the
remaining 11 neither opposed nor consented.
   Judge Neil Denison issued the order after a day of legal
argument, ruling the film would help police and that it was in
``the overriding public interest.''
   However, he said in other cases the public interest may be
better served by allowing the news media to report events freely
and each case should be decided on its merits.
   ``It is right, as has been argued, that the court should not
automatically or routinely grant such orders,'' Denison said. ``It
should not be seen to be rubber-stamping such applications.''
   The new organizations reacted angrily.
   ``If we are seen to be a potential arm of the state, journalists
are going to be targets of the rioters,'' said TV-am news director
Jeff Berliner.
   Geoffrey Shaw, lawyer for the BBC and TV-am, argued there had
been 2,750 police officers at the poll tax demonstration.
   ``They should not require the media to be their eyes and ears.
If they want film, it is reasonable to expect them to take it
themselves,'' Shaw said.
   Shaw said the news media would face increased dangers if all
reporting material could eventually become available to police.
   The riot broke out last Saturday after 40,000 had gathered for a
peaceful demonstration to protest the new poll tax by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's government.
   Police were attacked, automobiles burned and overturned, shop
windows smashed and shops looted.
   Police said 339 of the 3,000 people who took part in the
six-hour street battles were arrested. Police also said 374
officers and 86 civilians were injured.
   Scotland Yard Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ramm, who is in
charge investigating the riot, testified that access to all
published and unpublished film and photographs would help him get a
clearer picture of the event.
   Ramm said the photographs taken by police and videotape taken
from traffic cameras and a helicopter were insufficient.
   He said the investigation needed as much material as possible to
identify people and to follow from pictures their activities during
the demonstration. People pictured in a nonviolent photograph might
be identified committing acts of violence or damage in another,
Ramm said.
   The newspapers and television companies ordered to submit film
include all the major British daily and Sunday newspapers and the
major television companies.
   Editors have seven days to comply with the orders, expected to
be signed by Denison on Monday.

   Majority Leader George Mitchell played the
sports diplomat Thursday when the Senate commended the University
of Nevada Las Vegas for its 103-73 men's basketball championship
victory over Duke.
   The resolution, which passed by a voice vote, would have been
routine except that Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., was presiding over
the Senate at the time.
   Sanford was president of Duke from 1969 to 1985.
   Sanford had to listen to a description of the bill praising the
Runnin' Rebels for their NCAA championship, then decree that the
resolution was passed.
   ``If there is no objection, the preamble and the resolution are
agreed too,'' he said.
   Mitchell then got up and said:
   ``Although there is no resolution to that effect, in view of the
resolution just adopted and the presiding officer's former role as
president of Duke University, I think we ought to also take a
moment to commend the Blue Devils of Duke for a great season and a
valiant effort in getting to the final four although they lost to
the University of Nevada at Los Vegas. And I know my distinguished
colleagues will join me in paying tribute to them.''

<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man accused of trying to hijack an
America West airliner to Cuba pleaded innocent Friday, and his
attorneys said they would argue temporary insanity.
   Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 39, of New Orleans, said he was
under the influence of drugs and temporarily insane on Jan. 16 when
he grabbed a flight attendant, announced he had a bomb and demanded
that the Houston-to-Las Vegas flight go to Cuba instead.
   Gonzalez-Gonzalez was thwarted when the pilot landed the Boeing
737 at Austin's Robert Mueller Municipal Airport and a police
officer climbed up an emergency chute and overpowered him.
   No bomb was discovered, but a device made of a toothpaste
container and a ``flashlight-type article'' was found on the
airliner, authorities said.
   He is charged with air piracy and assault.
   ``It's his position at this point that he will proceed that he
was not sane at the time of the event and therefore that will be
his defense,'' said Gonzalez-Gonzalez's attorney, Benny Ray.
   Prosecutor Kelly Loving said, ``I don't think it's appropriate
for me to comment on the evidence itself until we go to trial.
Anyone could deduce that if you're competent now it sheds some
question on the person being insane at the time of the offense.''
   If convicted of air piracy, he faces 20 years to life in prison.
The assault charge carries a maximum 10-year sentence.

   At least 200 opposition
politicians were arrested at city halls across western Michoacan
state to end sit-ins protesting purported election fraud by the
governing party, officials said Friday.
   A government official called the opposition leaders, arrested
Thursday and Friday at 17 city halls, ``a group of thugs.''
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, founder and leader of the Revolutionary
Democratic Party (PRD), said in a statement Friday that his party
is ``in full rebellion.'' His party claimed soldiers and police
arrested and beat at least 100 supporters in evictions Thursday at
occupied town seats.
   Party leaders claim the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which
has been in power in Mexico for 61 years, cheated them out of
victory in the Dec. 3 elections in both Michoacan and neighboring
Guerrero state.
   Soldiers in riot gear patrolled the streets of Ciudad Hidalgo,
120 miles northwest of Mexico City, in army trucks Friday
afternoon, while police reopened city hall and ushered the mayor
inside.
   Eight PRD leaders were arrested in Ciudad Hidalgo during
``Operation Supreme Government,'' a Federal Judicial Police
commander said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said similar arrests took place in all the towns where police
removed protesters from city halls Thursday.
   Participating federal agents arrested five of the opposition
leaders at the central square in Ciudad Hidalgo after one of them,
Arnulfo Medina, told The Associated Press the party planned to
retake the city halls.
   The arrest toll climbed to at least 200 on Friday, District
Attorney Carlos Pratts told the Excelsior news service.
   State Attorney General Color Romero denied charges that violence
occurred in the arrests.
   A federal government spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Cardenas' remarks prove his party ``is not a
political party, but rather a group of thugs, with its only law
being the law of the jungle and savagery.''
   Police installed mayors Friday in all the cleared city halls, a
police officer in Ciudad Hidalgo said.
   PRD spokesman Gustavo Tena said party members had organized a
demonstration for Friday night in Morelia, the state capital. They
were demanding authorities pull the army from Michoacan, end
repression and free purported political prisoners.
   Cardenas said Friday that supporters in Guerrero will also
redouble their efforts to organize ``when the time is right.''
   His party has called for the impeachment of Guerrero Gov.
Francisco Ruiz Massieu and a ``return to order'' in that state
after at least seven people died in February and March police
actions to still protests.
   Opposition activists stayed put at four city halls Friday,
including Uruapan, where elections are scheduled to be repeated
June 8, a state government spokesman said. He said protesters
abandoned one city hall without police intervention.

<HEAD>Judge Who Presided Over Vietnam Protest Trial Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R. Dixon Herman, the federal judge who oversaw
the Vietnam-era trial of seven people accused of plotting to kidnap
Henry Kissinger, has died of a heart attack. He was 78.
   Herman, of the U.S. District Court in Pennsylvania, died
Thursday at Harrisburg Hospital. He was admitted March 30 after
suffering a heart attack, said his law clerk, Bill Kellett.
   Herman was appointed to the federal bench by President Richard
Nixon in 1969, and became a senior judge on Sept. 25, 1981.
   He presided over the three-month trial in 1972 of the so-called
``Harrisburg Seven'' group of Vietnam War protesters, which
included the Rev. Phillip Berringan, and several other priests and
nuns. They were charged with conspiring to blow up underground
steam tunnels in Washington and kidnap Henry Kissinger, then
Nixon's national security advisor, in an attempt to bring about the
end of the war.
   The seven also faced charges of interfering with the draft
board, unlawfully mailing threats to Kissinger and smuggling
letters into the federal prison at Lewisburg, Pa.
   A jury acquitted the seven of all charges except smuggling.
   Herman also ruled in a 1979 case that damage claims against
Piper Aircraft Co. resulting from a plane crash in Scotland had to
be tried there.
   His ruling was upheld in 1981 by the U.S. Supreme Court, which
determined that people filing damage claims from accidents overseas
are not automatically entitled to a trial in this country.
   That ruling played a role in determining that the
multibillion-dollar damage suits against the chemical manufacturer
Union Carbide should be heard in India, where a gas leak in 1984
killed 3,500 people in Bhopal, India.
   Herman was a graduate of Bucknell University and the Cornell Law
School.
   He served in the Navy in the South Pacific during World War II.
   He served an assistant district attorney, a state representative
and county solicitor before being appointed to the bench in Dauphin
County in 1957.

<HEAD>`Jake's Women,' New Neil Simon Comedy, Closing Out-of-Town</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Jake's Women,'' a new Neil Simon comedy
starring Peter Coyote and Stockard Channing, will fold April 15 at
San Diego's Old Globe Theater, and will not open in New York, a
spokesman said Thursday.
   It is the first time a Simon play scheduled for Broadway
production has closed out-of-town, said spokesman Bill Evans.
   ``The show may very well arrive to New York in another version,
but this production won't,'' Evans said.
   The comedy, which Simon has called semi-autobiographical,
concerns a writer who is still coming to terms with the death of
his first wife while his second marriage falls apart.
   The California reviews for the play were negative. Variety's
asked the question ``Is it funny?'' then answered, ``Not very. ...
`Jake's Women' will require major surgery.''
   The play's director, Ron Link, was fired before the San Diego
opening and was replaced by Jack O'Brien, artistic director of the
Old Globe.
   ``Jake's Women'' was to have opened at the Neil Simon Theater in
New York on April 30.
   Simon, whose Broadway hits include ``Barefoot in the Park,''
``The Odd Couple'' and ``Biloxi Blues,'' has had his share of flops
on the Great White Way, including ``Fools,'' ``God's Favorite'' and
the revival of ``Little Me.''

   A storm of gunfire at a suspected crack house
left five people dead and a sixth critically wounded in the city's
worst multiple slaying in nearly 19 years, police said Thursday.
   ``It's a drug deal gone bad,'' said neighbor Alonzo Johnson.
``They are dealing drugs on every other house on every other street
in this neighborhood. It's bad.''
   No arrests had been made in the Wednesday night attack, said
police Sgt. Christopher Buck, who declined to discuss a possible
motive. Calls to the department's homicide, narcotics and special
crimes units were not returned or drew no response.
   The attack was the worst multiple slaying in Detroit since June
1971, when seven members of a heroin ring were found shot to death,
said Deputy Police Chief James Younger.
   Four of the dead, including two teen-agers, were found dead on
the second floor of the bungalow. Each had been shot in the head,
Buck said.
   Two of the victims were shot while trying to run downstairs and
were found in the basement. Buck said Levon Robinson, 18, died
shortly after arriving at Detroit Receiving Hospital, where Rodney
Lewis, whose age was not available, was listd in critical condition.
   The dead found upstairs were Steven Owens, 32; Carl D. Williams,
20; Bobby Lee Frazier, 16; and Robert Lee Hill, 15, all of Detroit,
said Buck.
   Police would not say if the attack was committed by gunmen high
on crack or seeking revenge for a crack deal gone bad. But City
Councilman Gilbert Hill, former head of the police department's
homicide division, said he saw little difference.
   ``Most of the time it's not a turf battle, just thugs robbing
each other,'' Hill said. ``Some of these guys walking around with
Uzis and .44 magnums, they have the brain of an ant. I don't think
it's part of any organized conspiracy.''

<TEXT>
   Ethiopian Air Force jets killed 46 and
wounded 82 in raids on the Red Sea port of Massawa and the northern
town of Afabet, Eritrean rebels said Thursday.
   In separate reports, the Eritrean People's Liberation Front said
planes dropped cluster bombs on both towns in raids Tuesday and
Wednesday.
   Israel has been accused of supplying cluster bombs to Ethiopia,
a charge denied by both governments.
   Cluster bombs typically explode above ground level, hurling
shards of metal over a wide area. They are particularly effective
against massed troop formations.
   The report of the air raid could not be independently confirmed
and the government made no mention of it. However, a handful of
reporters allowed into Eritrea in recent weeks have confirmed past
air raids on the port.
   The United Nations had hoped to use Massawa as the port of entry
for some 1 million tons of emergency food needed to relieve an
estimated 4 to 5 million famine victims in northern Ethiopia this
year.
   In a radio broadcast monitored in Nairobi, the rebels said 30
people were killed and 58 injured in Wednesday's raid on Massawa.
The broadcast said most of the victims were women and children.
   In a later report telexed to The Associated Press in Nairobi
from their London office, the rebels said 16 were killed and 24
injured on Tuesday in Afabet, 60 miles northwest of Massawa.
   The rebels said the Afabet strike was carried out by two
Soviet-built MiG fighters and was concentrated on the center of the
town, near its main mosque.
   The rebels captured Massawa, one of only two Ethiopian ports on
the Red Sea, on Feb. 11, three days after launching a massive new
offensive in the country's northernmost province.
   The rebels have been fighting for autonomy for Ethiopia's
northern province since 1962.

<TEXT>
   Chadian soldiers killed 730 rebels and
took another 315 prisoner in counterattacks on guerrillas who
struck two military garrisons last week, the Armed Forces High
Command announced Thursday.
   The attacks ``completely destroyed'' rebel elements of the
Libyan-backed Islamic Legion operating from Sudan, the High Command
communique said. Government troops reportedly seized 67 vehicles
equipped with machine guns.
   The High Command announced the attacks Wednesday night after
retaking the outposts of Tine and Bahai. No casualty figures have
been given for the government.
   The Islamic Legion infiltrates into Chad from Sudan's Darfur
province, an area over which the Sudanese government has virtually
no control.
   Radio Chad on Wednesday stressed Libya's role in backing the
Islamic Legion, reportedly headed by Idress Deby, a former
commander-in-chief of the government forces. Libya denies backing
the Islamic Legion.
   The government of President Hissene Habre reported attacks on
Bahai and Tine last week, the latest in sporadic Islamic Legion
assaults since Chad and Libya announced a cease-fire.
   Libya, which once occupied most of northern Chad, was chased out
three years ago in a series of defeats. Tripoli still claims as its
own a strip of land on Chad's northern border, the Aouzou Strip.
   In a peace agreement signed last September, Libya and Chad
reconfirmed their cease-fire, agreed to the exchange of prisoners
of war and to submitting their territorial dispute to international
arbitration.

   The Finnish consulate in Leningrad has

reported, opening a new transit route from the Soviet Union to
Israel.
   The visas allow the emigrants to stay in Finland for up to five
days. They may also apply for asylum in Finland, the ministry said.
   Jaakko Blomberg, chief of the Foreign Ministry's political
department, said in a statement the decision was in line with the
human right of free travel.
   But in apparent response to protests by the Palestine Liberation
Organization, Blomberg said Finland asked Israel not to move the
immigrants into the occupied territories.
   Israel says only a small fraction of newly arrived Soviet
immigrants settle in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip.
   Some Palestinians want the occupied lands to become a separate
Palestinian state.

   A far-reaching clean air bill goes to the
House floor after clearing a committee by a 42-1 vote, moving
Congress a step closer to enacting tougher air pollution controls.
   The Energy and Commerce Committee approved the complex and
costly clean air package late Thursday after resolving the thorny
issue of helping Midwest utilities cope with tougher acid rain
controls.
   The acid rain compromise, approved 39-4, aims to help Midwest
states pay for cleaning up pollution caused by utility plants by
providing a ``pollution allowance'' system and a one-year extension
for initial compliance in some cases.
   Critics of the measure have said it would cause electric rates
to jump. Legislation passed by the Senate earlier this week
includes a similar provision.

   Congressional auditors warned today that last
year's savings and loan bailout plan will fall a staggering $68
billion short and called on the Bush administration to come up with
a plan to raise the money.
   The General Accounting Office, in its highest-yet estimate, said
it will cost the government $325 billion to close or sell failed
thrift institutions. That's greater than the annual budget of the
Defense Department.
   The new projection is up a sharp 26 percent from a $257 billion
estimate the GAO offered only five months ago. And it is based on
admittedly optimistic assumptions about interest rates, rescue
costs and the number of S&amp;L failures, Comptroller General Charles
A. Bowsher, who heads the GAO, told the Senate Banking Committee.
   In his prepared testimony, Bowsher called on Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L.
William Seidman, who is administering the bailout, to ``develop
proposals to provide the additional funds.''

   The new Parliament has asked the man likely
to lead East Germany into unification with West Germany to form a
democratic government for the nation raised on Communism.
   Christian Democrat leader Lothar de Maiziere, whose party holds
the most seats in Parliament, will attempt to resolve differences
over reunification in the coming days, and build a broad coalition
from the 11 parties represented.
   His success would speed merger of the German states, the
principal issue in the country's first free elections on March 18.
   Unification was a prominent theme of Thursday's inaugural
session of the 400-member Parliament, and the lawmakers formally
dismantled the Communist system that ruled for four decades.

   Labor's traditional allies in Congress are
steering clear of the Greyhound strike because bus passengers don't
carry political clout and lawmakers are skittish about taking sides
in the violent dispute, legislators and others say.
   ``Members of Congress fly in airplanes _ they don't ride buses.
These passengers tend to be poor folks who are not active
politically,'' said Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y.
   Democrats who sometimes take the lead on labor issues also said
President Bush's hands-off approach to such disputes _ he vetoed a
union-backed plan to help settle the Eastern Airlines strike _ has
inhibited lawmakers from jumping into the fray.
   Congress historically has sat on the sidelines for months before
injecting itself in labor-management disputes, and neither
Greyhound nor striking drivers who walked out five weeks ago has
asked Congress to intervene.

   The Pennsylvania governor's race is
tipping conventional political wisdom on its ear when it comes to
the issue of abortion.
   Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey is an unyielding foe of
abortion, contrary to his national party platform. Casey's chief
Republican challenger, state Auditor General Barbara Hafer, is
firmly pro-choice, a position that puts her at odds with the GOP
national platform.
   While leaders of both parties say they can accommodate people on
both sides of the issue, a Casey-Hafer contest could test the
loyalties of many rank-and-file members in both parties.
   Casey's and Hafer's views on abortion also have attracted two
more candidates to the gubernatorial race, an anti-abortion
Republican and a pro-choice Democrat campaigning almost exclusively
on the abortion issue.

<TEXT>
   Newspaper life has fallen on hard times. No
smoking in the city room. Computers instead of typewriters. Phones
that chirp. Reporters who go straight home after work. Columnists
who regularly appear on ... TV.
   ABC's ``Capital News,'' about the inmates of the mythical,
powerful Washington Capital of Washington, D.C., faithfully
reproduces all these modern ills. It has a first-rate cast. There
even are some funny lines.
   Alas, its script also has more familiar feats of Fourth Estate
than you can shake an editor at. Why, the troops even expose a
rotten slumlord in only a few hours. And some of the cityroom
dialogue has to be heard to be disbelieved.
   It includes: ``I want to document what crack's doing to that
neighborhood.'' And: ``I'm way behind on a front-page story.'' And:
``This paper does not conduct vendettas.''
   Even reporters will long remember the angry warning of the
paper's handsome young metropolitan editor to a management
colleague, an oily national editor who is trying to steal one of
the metro section's best scribes:
   ``Let's get something straight, Edison. Metro's not your farm
club. My people go into the real world, and it stinks sometimes.''
   In short, ``News,'' bowing tonight with a bloated two-hour
edition, may make one think its authors saw a ``Lou Grant'' rerun,
then leaped up and said, ``Hey, kids, let's put on a newspaper!''
   Funny thing, though. There are bits and pieces of good in this
show. It actually has promise, even though the first round
basically seems a series of variations on cliches. It has two major
things going for it:
   _ A excellent cast, the best-known of them Lloyd Bridges, who
plays the paper's avuncular, tough-when-he-needs-to-be veteran
editor. The actors often make the spoken cliches tolerable. Major
credit is due Michael Woods, who as the handsome young metro editor
has to deliver most of them.
   _ Characters that stick in your mind, like the smarmy, snippy,
syndicated gossip columnist with his own TV show (Kurt Fuller, who
is very funny); Mark Blum's nasty national editor, and the
streetwise fire and police reporter (Jenny Wright).
   Wright, who seems to get the best one-liners, has a well-honed
sense of timing. She's fun to watch, even in a quick bit when she
asks a tight-mouthed fire department official about a nursing home
fire:
   ``I just need a hint of the approximate cause of the fire. Was
it a meteor from outer space or was one it of the older men smoking
in bed?''
   One nice aspect of the show is that its make-believe scribes
aren't terminally earnest, as often is the case in newspaper shows.
On the glum side, the dramatic Old Reliables of TV newspaperdom are
lurking here.
   There's the eager, lovely young newcomer (Helen Slater) who,
teaming up on an unusual bank robbery story with a rumpled hotshot
(William Russ), proves incredibly good. On her first day, she gets
a front-page byline.
   There's the elegant, fast-fading old foreign correspondent _
beautifully played by Lee Richardson _ resting on his reputation
and hip flask. Bridges wants him to retire. Unbeknownst to him, the
old-timer takes one last shot on a local story about a drug-ridden
housing project.
   And there's the old problem of a reporter's sex life,
specifically that of its basic beautiful ace investigative reporter
(Kathryn Harrold).
   She has written an explosive expose about a defective missile
system. But with deadline approaching, she's under pressure to
print the name of her source (you only need one in TV) for the
story.
   This is because word gets out she's been sleeping with a
handsome Senate aide, and he is suspected of being her source.
   He's not the source, she tells editor Bridges: ``The agreement
was we don't talk about our work if there might be a conflict.''
The editor's snappy comeback: ``What'd that leave you, the
weather?''
   Later, shifting to a fatherly role as a man of Washington
wisdom, he urges her, if she really loves the guy, to go public
with it: ``In this town, nobody minds you having a private life as
long as they know all about it.''
   That intelligence comes near the finale as the show shifts to
post-deadline glimpses of the scribes' private lives, including the
fact that three of the staff share an old house in Washington and
invite the rookie to join them.
   The post-deadline puttering around seems tacked on, and only
gives the impression that false endings are now in vogue.
   All this doesn't make for the best possible premiere for a TV
newspaper series, even when the creator is David Milch, who had a
hand in a pretty good cop show called ``Hill Street Blues.''
   But, as we say, the acting is fine and many of the characters
well-sketched. If the writers of future ``Capital News'' episodes
have paid more attention to journalistic detail and less to cliche,
the series may have a chance.
   If not, everyone should write ABC and demand that it revive
``Kolchak: The Night Stalker.'' Now that was a nifty newshawk
series, even if it was set in only a wire service.

   SURFER GIRL, THE SEQUEL: ABC on April 29 will air ``The Story of
The Beach Boys: Summer Dreams,'' a dramatization of the unhappy
side of the guys who sang of little deuce coupes and things. It's
based on Steven Gaines' ``Heroes and Villains, the True Story of

<HEAD>The Strike, Once Labor's Big Weapon, is Now More of a Gamble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union leaders who've watched the strike lose
part of its firepower as a bargaining weapon in recent years are
turning to new strategies for winning better wages and benefits.
   ``The notion that the first thing you do is go stage a strike,
that cry, that slogan, is dead in the labor movement,'' says Bob
Harman of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees.
   ``The strike used to be almost automatic, just part of the
industrial landscape,'' says John Duray of the United Mine Workers.
``Now you have unions picking their targets much more carefully,
exhausting all their options first.''
   The strike has become more of a gamble over the past decade as
the hiring of permanent replacement workers _ a practice once
considered taboo _ becomes more widespread.
   In the ongoing Eastern Air Lines strike, for instance, the
company has replaced most of the machinists who walked out more
than a year ago. Flight attendants and pilots who conducted
temporary sympathy strikes also have permanently lost their jobs.
   Greyhound drivers now face the same prospect in their month-long
strike because the company has pledged to give permanent jobs to
the drivers who join up as replacements.
   Many labor leaders blame the trend toward replacement hiring on
former President Reagan, who fired striking air traffic controllers
in 1981. The practice has forced unions to look increasingly at
``inside strategies,'' or tactics that workers can use on the job
to exert economic pressure on employers to win a new contract, yet
also avoid a strike.
   Tactics include ``work-to-rule,'' where employees strictly
follow work manuals rather than taking their normal shortcuts that
speed up productivity; ``rolling'' strikes where workers hold spot,
one-day no-shows; boycotts of a company's products; newspaper and
billboard advertisements to win the public's support; and personal
approaches to a company's board of directors and shareholders.
   ``All these things can have a tremendous impact on mobilizing
workers and help increase a union's presence on the shop floor,''
says Jim Green, a labor historian at the University of
Massachusetts.
   Energizing workers keeps them from crossing picket lines once a
strike starts and can dissaude people from taking replacement jobs,
Green says. That's what unions did in two of the most recent strike
success stories, pulled off by Appalachian coal miners and NYNEX
telephone workers in the Northeast.
   ``That shows you what it takes to win a strike under current
circumstances. But to say that this is going to be the norm is
probably expecting too much of the unions,'' Green says.
   Many unions are also devoting more energy to negotiations before
a contract expires in an effort to head off a strike. St. Paul,
Minn., county workers, for instance, called in a mediator to help
them bargain and as a result were on strike only six days, Harman
says.
   The Communications Workers of America is drafting a manual that
will list 40 tactics organized labor can use to build worker and
community support and avoid a strike.
   In the 1970s, nearly 300 strikes involving 1,000 or more workers
occurred each year. That average dropped to about 50 per year over
the past five years, federal figures show.
   Companies have had the legal right to hire replacement workers
for decades, but it was rarely used, largely because employers
feared a public backlash.
   Reagan's firing of air traffic controllers ``put starch in the
spine of employers,'' says AFL-CIO spokesman Rex Hardesty.
   TWA, Boise Cascade, International Paper, Colt Firearms and the
Chicago Tribune lined up replacement workers before a strike
occurred, Hardesty says.
   ``I think it represents the atmosphere that Reagan set. ...
Employers are saying, `Well, the name of the game is greed and
we've got the green light.' It's get as much as you can, get it as
fast you can, and no matter if it hurts a lot of people,'' says
AFSCME President Gerald McEntee.
   Duray says the new age of replacement hiring is ``disturbing
from the point of view of what it says about a company's concern
for long-term productivity and its commitment to its workers.''
   Legislation is pending in Congress to ban companies from hiring
permanent replacement workers in labor disputes.
   Union officials acknowledge that employers feel more comfortable
hiring replacement workers because organized labor lost clout in
the 1980s with a decline in membership.
   ``We've probably been victims of our own success. Our workers
may have reached the point where they were making pretty good
wages, had two cars in the garage, and they lost that knot in the
belly, a desire to stick together,'' McEntee says.
   Green says Americans also have shifted their thinking on the
ethics of being a strikebreaker.
   ``It used to be that the worst thing somebody could possibly
call you, in blue-collar neighborhoods, was a scab. Now a lot of
people think it's alright to take someone else's job.''

<HEAD>The Mystery of Corporate Dividends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is a recession in corporate profits, but
you would hardly know it from the rate at which companies are
paying dividends. Compared with other periods, it's sky high.
   Good reasons for the situation are hard to find, but no harder
than several other mysteries about the profits recession. Many
stock prices seem to have ignored the evidence, for instance, and a
lot of forecasters too.
   A good many of the published economic forecasts tend to make
little of the decline, choosing to stress instead what they see as
an improving situation as the year goes on.
   A plausible explanation is offered by economist Edward Yardeni
when he suggests that if profits fall but the economy continues to
grow ``then company managers presumably have a good chance of
reviving profits.''
   In contrast, says Yardeni, who does his analyses for
Prudential-Bache Securities, ``if the economy is in a recession,
the situation is out of their control.''
   But what about now? The decline in profits already is greater
than that which occurred in the deep recessions of a decade ago,
and officially, at least, there isn't even a recession under way
now.
   Throughout the decline, which has lasted four straight quarters,
or since the end of 1988, very few companies have tampered with
their dividend payout and some of have raised it.
   As a result, dividends as a percentage of after-tax profits _
following a 16 percent profits decline last year _ are about 80
percent, whereas a more normal figure would be around 50 percent.
   The current percentage, says economist H. Erich Heinemann, is
near a record high in the postwar period, surpassed only by the
second quarter of 1986, when the economy skirted the edge of
recession.
   In times gone by, the ratio of dividends to after-tax profits
usually peaked at the end of a recession, then fell as profits
improved. But, if you can believe Uncle Sam, there is no general
recession now, and none since 1982.
   But there is that profits recession, and there is no denying
that a logical tie exists between profits and dividends. Simply
stated, if you don't make the profits you can't pay the dividends.
   However, based on experience of the past year, that logic seems
suspended. During the 1989 final quarter pretax operating profits
were running at an annual rate of $285.7 billion, compared with a
rate of $340.2 billion one year before.
   ``Could it be that big, bad, ugly bear markets in stocks only
happen if the economy and corporate profits are in a recession?''
asks Yardeni, who believes the economy will continue to grow all
year long.
   In that outlook, he has plenty of company among his fellow
forecasters, many of whom see a bigger and better economic picture,
including corporate profits, as the year wears on.
   It seems, therefore, that faith in higher future profits is
having more of an impact on dividends than the current low-profit
profits.
   What if profits don't rise? Well, it seems that logic eventually
must prevail _ that if the money isn't coming in, it can't be paid
out as dividends. Should the profits fail to recover, can dividends
not fall?

<DATELINE>KINCAID, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Gary Hart descends deep into the
darkness of the coal-rich soil each day, he fears the future. As a
miner, he could lose his job. As mayor, he could lose his town.
   The double threat comes from hundreds of miles away, where
Congress is rewriting the nation's clean air laws, setting new
pollution standards that could crush this tiny town that lives and
thrives on coal.
   To combat acid rain, the local mine's neighbor and only customer
_ one of the nation's dirtiest coal-fired power plants _ will
likely have to reduce the sulfur dioxide spewing from its stacks.
How it does that has put Kincaid on edge, hoping for a reprieve,
but leery of a death sentence.
   ``If they shut down completely, I'm not going to have a
community to lead,'' Hart said. ``It'll sit there and die. People
will have to move to get jobs. It's just a sad thing. People want
to work, they want their jobs, but how do they keep them?''
   Across the Midwest and northern Appalachia, high-sulfur coal
country, Kincaid and other mining towns are in a quandary,
wondering whether new clean air laws will pit health against
wealth, reducing prosperity with pollution.
   ``There is a need for clean air,'' Hart said. ``But completely
wiping out an industry is not the solution to the problem. It just
creates a bigger problem.''
   In Ohio, one congressman recently said acid rain controls could
cost the state up to $2 billion a year and raise some commercial
electric rates as much as 40 percent. In Kentucky, officials say
half the coal mining jobs in the western part of the state could be
lost.
   And in Illinois, which already lost 30 percent of its coal
mining jobs in the 1980s, a worst-case scenario estimates up to
4,500 more could vanish.
   The government says up to 5,000 high-sulfur coal jobs likely
will be lost nationally by 1995. But the United Mine Workers
predicts that will grow to about 20,000 by the end of the decade,
inflicting more pain on an industry that has shrunk by 44 percent
in the last decade and crushed Main Streets dependent on miners'
dollars.
   Commonwealth Edison, the utility that owns the plant, won't
decide how it will reduce sulfur fumes in Kincaid until the clean
air measure becomes law. On Tuesday, the Senate passed its bill,
which Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., one of 11 opponents, said would
``decimate'' his state. A House version was approved Thursday in
committee.
   Edison can install ``scrubbers,'' which would cost about $350
million and cut emissions by about 90 percent, or take two other
devastating steps: switch to cleaner, low-sulfur coal from the West
or shut down, which would almost certainly trigger the mine closing.
   ``We're doing everything possible to try avoid closing the
plant,'' said John Maxson, Edison's governmental affairs director.
   The stakes are enormous. The plant and Peabody Coal Co.'s mine
No. 10, across-the-road neighbors, have nearly 900 workers and an
annual payroll of about $25 million, Maxson said.
   Meanwhile, in this town of 1,500 where mining is a tradition,
with sons and fathers working side-by-side, the uncertainty has
folks fretting.
   ``You're hanging by a thread,'' said miner Butch Spinner. ``Are
you going to fall on the good side of the lake or on the side with
the alligators?''
   ``We're pawns in a big political game,'' said Ron Phares, 33, a
husky 12-year mine veteran. ``You feel powerless, pushed aside,
neglected. ... I'd hate to be 55, 56, 57 looking this in the eye.
Where are you going to go?''
   Miners also say that while they're all for reducing pollution,
having fought for cleaner air underground, this isn't a simple case
of good vs. evil.
   ``I hope environmentalists have some sympathy with me,'' said
Tim Drea, a second-generation miner. ``Many of my co-workers'
fathers were miners, they went to high school, got a job, married
their prom dates. Now their kids are 10, 11, 12. All they know is
coal mining.
   ``If the mines close because of emotional legislation, these
people are left with nothing. I can't agree with that any more than
I can agree with dirty air.''
   In fact, many environmentalists support subsidies to cut cleanup
costs and protect jobs, but others say utilities and miners adopted
a head-in-the-sand policy too long.
   ``They played this denial game for 10 years,'' said Clark
Bullard, an environmentalist and University of Illinois mechanical
engineering professor. ``They denied acid rain was a serious
problem. ... Now they're looking for sympathy and bailouts.''
   Bullard said there was little support several years ago for a
proposed national utility surcharge to help pay for scrubbers.
   ``The time for getting a good deal has passed,'' he said. ``The
deal we're going to get is going to hurt the Midwest.''
   Too much so, say miners and utilities, who argue that experts
don't have conclusive proof heavy damage is caused by acid rain,
created when sulfur and nitrogen oxides mix with water in the
atmosphere. It is blamed for damaging forests and killing fish in
the Northeast and Canada.
   The Senate bill calls for a 10 million ton reduction in annual
emissions of sulfur dioxide by the year 2000.
   Miners say if that takes jobs away, the government should help.
   ``If (President) Bush can bail out the savings and loans, he can
help the coal miners,'' said Paul Wagahoft, a Kincaid miner.
   Last week, however, Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W Va., lost his bid to
amend the clean air bill to provide $500 million in aid to miners
who would lose their jobs.
   ``Coal miners can't walk across the street and find another
job,'' said Gerald Hawkins, legislative director of Illinois
District 12 of the UMW. ``There is none.''
   It's a bitter reality in Kincaid and neighboring central
Illinois towns.
   ``What are they going to retrain you for around here?'' Phares
asked. ``This is a farming area. There's not much industry to go
into. ... I'd have to relocate. You're not going to make $15 an
hour and have good insurance.''
   ``You're not going to step out tomorrow and find a
$30,000-a-year job,'' Wagahoft said. ``You're going to have to
start over.''
   Hart also worries about the impact on Kincaid, which he says
supplies about 25 percent of the work force at the mine and plant.
   ``You take 100 miners in the community _ they get paid $1,000
every two weeks,'' he said. ``That would be lost.''
   Some miners are bracing for the worst, taking accounting
classes, attending truck driving school, putting off home repairs
and purchases.
   Whatever happens, they'll adjust.
   ``It's something I feel I can't change,'' Phares said. ``I can't
tell George Bush I've got three kids, I've got a house payment,
I've got a truck payment. ... Whatever comes, I've just got to
accept it. I've just got to live with the consequences.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The action may be dull and dispirited most
places on Wall Street right now, but there is a hot new game in
progress at the American Stock Exchange.
   The excitement centers on a new breed of security, scarcely
three months old, that provides investors with a way to play the
ups and downs of foreign markets, most notably the one in Tokyo.
   These vehicles take the form of warrants, which give their
holders the right to buy or sell another security or group of
securities at a stated price within a specified period of time.
   Through their long history in this country warrants have been
best known as an adjunct to individual common stocks, with issuers
ranging from legions of small companies to such blue-chip names as
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   Starting in January of this year, the idea was adapted to
embrace a stock index in a foreign market _ specifically, Japan's
Nikkei Stock Average _ as the underlying ``security.''
   By the end of March, Amex trading had begun in four different
``put warrants'' on the Nikkei index.
   These warrants, which constitute rights to sell a cash
equivalent of a basket of Japanese stocks at a set price, naturally
tend to increase in value whenever the going prices of those stocks
fall.
   They have been hailed by some observers as a valuable tool for
managing and hedging risks that come with the increasingly
international approach many investors have taken in recent years.
Some skeptics, by contrast, call them a gimmick.
   Whether for good or ill, they appeared on the scene at an
opportune time, as the lofty Japanese market ran into a turbulent
period of selling that drove the Nikkei index down more than 25
percent.
   Before long, the Nikkei warrants, and a couple of similar ones
based on the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index in Britain,
seized a prominent place on the daily lists of the most active Amex
issues.
   Last week the Wall Street firm of Salomon Brothers stirred the
pot anew with the first of an expected series of ``call warrants''
on the Nikkei, for buyers seeking a way to profit from RISING stock
prices in Japan.
   Thanks to that, and to rumors of further volatile times ahead in
Tokyo, nearly 9 million of the various foreign-index warrants were
traded on the Amex last Wednesday _ accounting for 43 percent of
the exchange's overall stock volume for the day.
   So far this year, the warrants have been responsible for nearly
15 percent of what the Amex counts as ``equity volume.''
   The speculative allure of this product isn't hard to see. The
first of the Nikkei put warrants, for instance, tripled in price as
the Japanese market tumbled.
   Among the many risks that also come with these investments, some
are more obvious than others. For any speculators venturing into
this game, it is plain that wrong guesses are very likely to mean
large losses.
   In addition, it takes market savvy to gauge when a warrant is
trading at an advantageous price in relation to its underlying
index. On top of that, commissions and other trading costs may
stack the odds heavily against the small investor.
   Drawbacks like those haven't stopped the foreign index warrants
from attracting a substantial following to date. Whether they will
keep growing as rapidly in the future depends partly on what
happens in the Japanese and other overseas stock markets.
   Should they continue to flourish, all sorts of possibilities
arise. For instance, could an index warrant, or something closely
resembling it, some day provide the springboard to large-scale
``index arbitrage'' and other computer-program trading on an
international scale?
   If such activity ever came to stir up problems and controversy,
who or what would regulate it?

<HEAD>Cyrano Is Season's Brightest Star</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARILYN AUGUST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Without a doubt, Cyrano de Bergerac is France's
most famous fictional character, with his long nose and gift of
poetic gab.
   Painfully shy and downright ugly, Cyrano was a master swordsman
with verve and panache who breathed his poetry and passion into the
tongue-tied head of a handsome soldier to win the lovely Roxanne.
   He's so popular this season that he's currently being portrayed
on the stage and in movie houses by France's top two leading actors.
   Nearly 100 years after he was created for theater, Cyrano is
once again tugging at the heart. Jean-Paul Belmondo is dazzling
audiences at the sold-out Marigny Theater, while Gerard Depardieu
is inducing tears _ and laughs _ in France's most expensive
cinematic production ever.
   ``Cyrano de Bergerac,'' produced at a cost of $17 million,
opened March 28 to critical praise.
   The classic tale of unrequited love got a modern face lift in
1987 in the movie ``Roxanne,'' starring Steve Martin and Darryl
Hannah. Martin played a long-nosed fire chief in a contemporary
American small town.
   The newest versions are faithful to Edmond Rostand's play set in
17th-century France against a background of war between kings, a
war fought by such swashbuckling Gascons as D'Artagnan of the Three
Musketeers.
   Both Depardieu and Belmondo have received rave reviews from
critics in their portrayals of Cyrano, considered one of the most
difficult roles ever written.
   For Depardieu, 41, France's biggest box-office attraction with
60 films under his belt, ``Cyrano'' is his most brilliant
performance ever. He gives an eloquent delivery and sublime
dramatic portrayal of Cyrano. He is comic and poignant at the same
time, and with magnificent period costumes and sets, the film is
215 minutes of sheer poetry and pleasure.
   Belmondo portrays Cyrano in an athletic, swashbuckling way.
There tends to be a bit more shouting by Belmondo in the play.
Depardieu, on the other hand, literally whispers into the camera.
   The movie, which will open in the United States in December, was
filmed on location in Hungary with 2,000 actors and extras in
period costumes, 40 studio sets and 1,000 pikes and muskets. An
entire forest was cleared to film the siege of Arras, a town in
northern France where the French succeeded in ousting the Spaniards
in the mid-1600s.
   Studio Magazine, France's leading film monthly, devoted 20 pages
to the film and described Depardieu as ``an actor in a state of
grace.''
   ``Everything in Cyrano's character fits him like a glove,'' Marc
Esposito wrote. ``The power, the sensitivity, the arrogance, the
complexes, the fragility we sense under his imposing physique,
belongs as much to Cyrano as to Depardieu.''
   Jacques Weber, who triumphed in his portrayal of De Guiche, the
haughty count also enamored of Roxanne, called Depardieu ``a bomb
fallen from the moon.''
   Written by Rostand in 1897, ``Cyrano'' is as French as the
national anthem. Children study it in school and audiences know the
``nose'' and ``no thank you'' tirades by heart.
   Yet, it has defied filmmakers until now because of its
alexandrines _ iambic lines with six feet that rhyme. Rappeneau and
veteran screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere streamlined the original
text, but critics say they sacrificed neither the poetry nor its
romantic soul.
   ``Cyrano'' has also endured because its story is timeless. Who
has never felt despair looking in the mirror or pain upon
discovering that the one you love loves another?
   ``A little Cyrano sleeps in the heart of all of us,'' Depardieu
says.
   For Belmondo, 56, best-known for his tough-guy roles in
fast-paced thrillers, Cyrano marks a long-awaited return to his
roots as a dramatic actor and only his second stage appearance in
25 years.
   Director Robert Hossein said playing Cyrano had long been a
secret goal of Belmondo because the actor's father, Paul, used to
say the role was the ultimate test for an actor.
   ``When will you go back to your real profession? I will die
without seeing you as Cyrano,'' Belmondo senior would say as his
son posted one box-office smash after another, Hossein recalled.
   Paul Belmondo died several years ago.
   ``Belmondo is paying off a personal debt (to his father),''
wrote Jean-Pierre Thibaudat in Liberation. ``If the movies hadn't
been invented, he would have been the Coquelin of our times. And
Coquelin invented Cyrano.''

<DATELINE>PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a tree-shaded street of $500,000
homes, burlap sacks bulging with empty cans and neatly tied stacks
of newspapers lie waiting for the weekly recycling truck in front
of environmentally landscaped yards.
   Recycling has been going strong here for almost 20 years, but
xeriscaping _ using drought-tolerant plants so yards need less
watering _ is all the rage these dry days.
   In Palo Alto, birthplace of the Silicon Valley's computer
industry and home of Earth Day headquarters, the fascination with
high tech is matched by a commitment to high quality of life and
devotion to the environment.
   Businessmen and women pedal to work on a 30-mile network of bike
lanes, cruising past houses topped by solar energy panels.
   Snowy egrets and great blue herons soar above marshes, and ducks
splash in a pond in the city's cherished baylands.
   Hundreds of deer graze the hillside meadows of the city's
1,500-acre private Foothills Park. Mountain lions, bobcats and 11
species of snakes roam freely in the hills, and 150 kinds of birds
delight hikers and picnickers.
   Frank Zinn takes a break every day around noon to feed bread to
ground squirrels in the baylands. The normally skittish creatures,
who live in 8-foot deep burrows, let Zinn pet them.
   ``They're kind of like my family,'' Zinn said. ``I was a still
photographer in Hollywood and when I came back to this area I was
worried that this whole place would be condominiums. I sure am glad
they preserved all this.''
   While 75 percent of the wetlands around San Francisco Bay have
been filled in over the years, Palo Altans have worked to preserve
their edge of the bay since the 1920s and have spent hundreds of
thousands of dollars to maintain its natural beauty.
   ``Wetlands are one of the most productive land forms in terms of
wildlife,'' said Emily Renzel, a City Council member who has led
protection efforts. ``Many animal species depend on them. To the
extent that we are crowding out major segments of the animal
population, we're just setting ourselves up for disaster someday.
   ``Slowly but surely we're creating a world in which we may be
the only ones existing, and it may not be a very pretty world. I
don't think we want to be in a world without birds singing.''
   Palo Alto is not without problems, of course. High-tech
companies sometimes leak toxic chemicals, and older buildings waste
too much energy.
   But it is a small city with a big reputation, a pioneer in
recycling since 1971, a center for solar energy research and a
model of environmental responsibility for cities of any size.
   It has won national awards for its bicycling and recycling
programs, waste water treatment and hazardous waste disposal.
   Halfway between the gray fog of San Francisco and the brown smog
of San Jose, Palo Alto is seen in aerial photographs as a patch of
green. A thick canopy of trees enriches the air with oxygen.
   The redwood El Palo Alto _ ``the tall tree'' used as a landmark
by Spanish explorers in 1769 _ still stands nobly, though thin on
top and slightly stooped.
   The city of 56,000 that grew up around that tree and bucolic
Stanford University has developed a passion for trees, especially
after watching apricot and cherry orchards give way to aerospace,
communications and electronic companies in the 1940s and '50s.
   According to the city's computerized tree inventory, 32,089
city-owned trees _ the most popular are magnolias with big white
blossoms _ line the streets. Perhaps 10 to 15 times as many are
privately owned, including birches, eucalyptuses and orange, lemon,
plum, pear and almond trees that flourish in the Mediterranean
climate of mild, moist winters and warm, dry summers.
   In the Magic Forest, a small stand of redwoods in one of the
city's more than 50 parks, the air is as cool and refreshing as in
the wilds of Yosemite.
   For many Palo Altans, though, their view of the environment
extends beyond the beauty of the land and the quality of the air
and water, said Denis Hayes, Earth Day founder and a resident of
Palo Alto, off and on, for more than 20 years.
   ``When a bunch of us were involved in trying to build a new
environmental movement in the late '60s and early '70s,'' he said,
``the search was really for an all-encompassing set of values, a
new ideology relevant to the 20th century.''
   A top priority, he said, was a desire to stop deterioration of
the planet and encourage peace, justice and education.
   In that broad context, he said, ``Palo Alto is in many ways an
idyllic kind of community. It aspires to become a new Athens. It
really does promote that vision in the sense of having large
democratic involvements in (national and international) statecraft
and doing what it can to encourage art and athletics.''
   No environmental danger escapes notice and no waste is tolerated
in this city, where more than 70 percent of residents and 24 of the
30 leading generators of commercial waste participate regularly in
recycling.
   Newspapers, glass, aluminum cans, plastic bottles, corrugated
cardboard, used motor oil, scrap metal, high-grade paper,
mattresses, yard debris and used car batteries are collected either
curbside or at drop-off centers.
   This month, the City Council is expected to pass the nation's
first toxic gas ordinance _ drafted by the Santa Clara County fire
departments with help from Silicon Valley computer chip companies,
environmentalists and lawmakers.
   It is designed to control releases of poisonous gases and add
enough safeguards to prevent a ``Bhopal, India, type of disaster,''
said Fire Marshal Phil Constantino. The model ordinance, under
study by dozens of other cities, is a follow-up to a hazardous
materials storage law, also the first in the nation, adopted by
Palo Alto and neighboring cities in 1982.
   Last year, the council prohibited all places that serve food
from using containers made with ozone-depleting
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. Downtown coffee shops offer coffee at
20 cents off for patrons who bring their own mugs instead of using
styrofoam cups.
   Another ordinance, banning all non-recyclable, disposable
polystyrene and rigid plastic food service items, is to go into
effect July 1.
   By the same date, auto service shops will be required to have
equipment to capture the CFC-laden Freon that escapes during air
conditioning repairs.
   On January 1, retail stores were required to offer a choice of
paper or plastic bags.
   Houses are expensive in Palo Alto _ three-bedroom homes range
from $300,000 to $1 million _ but gas and electricity rates are
generally at least 30 percent lower than the rest of the Bay area,
thanks to a city-owned utilities system.
   Palo Alto Utilities, the only municipal agency in the state that
provides gas, electricity and water, offers customers free analyses
of energy and water use, as well as low-interest loans to install
solar systems.

   According to the 1980 Census, 14 percent of Palo Altans working
there rode bicycles to their jobs. The current Census is expected
to show a big increase.
   ``The more bicyclists you have, the fewer cars you have,'' said
Ellen Fletcher, a former council member and longtime bicycling
advocate. ``That reduces the pollutants in the air, the traffic and
the need for more parking lots.''
   Fletcher helped push through laws requiring companies with more
than 50 employees to provide showers and bicycle parking spaces.
She is now urging the city to create a network of bicycle
boulevards to make it easier to ride around town.
   ``It's still a tough competition with the automobile,'' she
said. ``The ultimate goal should be to make it as convenient to
bicycle as it is to drive, and we haven't quite gotten to that
stage.''
   One progressive Palo Alto drug research company, Alza Corp.,
pays employees up to $60 a month for using public transportation or
$1 a day if they bike, jog, walk, or ride in carpools to work.
   ``Our primary concern as a company is an environmental one,''
said Alza executive Peter Carpenter. ``Paying people not to drive
and providing them with bike lockers and showers is also cheaper
than building more parking spaces for cars.
   ``Instead of subsidizing cars, we're subsidizing alternatives.
It's the free market approach. We're giving people an incentive to
leave their cars home.''
   Yet Carpenter admits, somewhat sheepishly, ``I still drive 90
percent of the time myself, which is horrible. ... That's the acid
test, when you can get people like me to stop talking about getting
out of their cars and start doing it.''

<DATELINE>ENVIGADO, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pablo Escobar, leader of the Medellin
drug cartel, grew up here. Residents say his money turned Envigado
into a utopia by day, but made the city police a squad of butchers
by night.
   A former police official put it this way to a local newspaper:
``If Envigado is Colombia's first city in quality of life, it is
also the first in the quality of death.''
   On March 28, President Virgilio Barco's government ordered the
civilian police force disbanded. The army has detained 19 of the 27
former city officers. Ten are charged with torturing and murdering
people for the Medellin cartel.
   One of those under arrest is Marlon Perez, who is accused of
organizing death squads for the drug gang.
   Envigado, population 80,000, is is northwestern Colombia, four
miles south of Medellin, the city from which the largest cocaine
gang takes its name.
   Escobar's hometown is under martial law and the army colonel in
charge is empowered to arrest any official who tries to impede
investigations of the local police force, known as the Department
of Security and Control.
   After the army took over, people started making their way to
brigade headquarters to report the killings of family members.
   Lately, police had begun killing wealthy townspeople who somehow
angered the drug traffickers, residents said. In the beginning, the
Department of Security and Control had concentrated on ``cleaning''
Envigado's streets of beggars, thieves and people who smoked
basuko, a cocaine base.
   ``They focused on murdering and torturing street people,''
Miguel Moreno, unemployed, told The Associated Press two days after
the police force was disbanded. ``They took me into the
headquarters and beat me up many times just because my clothes were
dirty.''
   During the interview, Moreno waved cars into parking spaces next
to Envigado's main plaza and tried to hustle the drivers for change.
   Army motorcycle patrols rumbled past the white church that
towers over the plaza.
   ``I would rather have a million soldiers in this town than those
damn security agents,'' said Leo Gomez, also unemployed.
   Sergio Jesus Jimenez, 23, sat in his wheelchair at a sidewalk
cafe and told how the police shot him in the back eight months
earlier, crippling him for life.
   Jimenez said he and some friends were watching a soccer game on
a store-window television when a police patrol, four men and a
woman, came around the corner.
   ``When we saw them, we began to run,'' he said. ``That's when
they shot me. They put me in the hospital for six days, and then
threw me in jail even though I couldn't walk.''
   He said police released him when they found he had no record.
Jimenez, an orphan who lives with his four brothers in the poor
Sebastiana neighborhood, admitted to smoking basuko ``from time to
time.''
   The same traffickers who export tons of cocaine to the United
States and other countries ``don't want to see a poor person even
thinking about smoking basuko on the street'' in Envigado, he said.
   Envigado appears to have fewer homeless people than other
Colombian towns. Although residents call it the nation's Monaco,
however, the business district remains a typical crowded jumble of
shops and restaurants.
   Most of the money Escobar put into his birthplace seems to have
financed condominium construction in wealthy neighborhoods.
   ``It is said the drug traffickers have invested in Envigado and
made life better for the people here, but at the same time they
send the police out to kill the poorest,'' Jimenez said. ``I was in
the army, and even in the army we didn't shoot people for no
reason.''
   ``Octavio, Arturo, Gonzalito, William, Jairo,'' the young man
said, reciting a litany of names of friends he said were victims of
the police.
   Edwin Arredondo Galvis, a 15-year-old half brother, said bodies
would show up under a bridge leading to their neighborhood. ``I
would see six or seven at a time,'' he said.
   Mayor-elect Jose Mario Rodriguez said the army had overreacted.
   ``We cannot see the justification of the military presence, but
we will cooperate with the officials,'' he said.
   Rodriguez takes office Aug. 1, but will have no power if martial
law still is in effect.
   The mayor-elect said he was certain the army would realize
Envigado was a peaceful place and leave soon.
   ``We continue in peace as we always have,'' he said. ``We invite
people to come and see how tranquil life here really is.''
   Jimenez, in his wheelchair, said silence does not necessarily
mean peace. He said families of victims had been afraid to speak up
about police links to the drug cartel, but ``now that the killers
are in jail, people are getting up the courage to talk.''
   He would go to army headquarters himself to report his injury if
he had the money for a taxi, but ``how am I suppose to get to the
brigade in this?'' Jimenez said, pointing to his wheelchair.
   A former city policeman, who would identify himself only as
Freddy, said Envigado had no problems except crimes committed by
people, like Jimenez, who smoked basuko.
   ``The department has done a good job here,'' said the officer,
who was playing cards with several men in a cafe. ``In 1989, we
detained 900 people. The national police didn't take in 5 percent
of that figure.''
   Freddy weighs about 120 pounds, has a thin face and shows
rotting teeth when he smiles. His friends called him Freddy the
Mouse.
   Rodriguez, the mayor-elect, said Envigado's problems had been
blown out of proportion.
   ``I think people are exaggerating because they envy Envigado's
wealth and its excellent administration,'' he said, and declared
his municipality to be the only one in Colombia with unemployment
benefits.
   A high tax base and such thriving industries as textiles and
chemicals paid for that, not money from cocaine traffickers, he
said.
   ``People associate the town with Pablo Escobar because he was
born here, but I for one have never met the man,'' Rodriguez said.
   Freddy the Mouse predicted the Department of Security and
Control would be back in business soon.
   ``The government needs us,'' he said. ``They just don't realize
how badly.''

<HEAD>`A Lot of Hopes' Riding with Hubble Space Telescope</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After seven years of frustrating
delay, the Hubble Space Telescope is finally tucked away aboard the
shuttle Discovery, ready to embark on its mission to scour the
outermost depths of space.
   The $1.5 billion observatory represents an astronomical advance
of astronomical proportions _ the greatest, in fact, since the
first use of a telescope by Galileo in 1609.
   ``We know a lot now, we think. Perhaps we don't know anything.
Perhaps we'll learn that,'' said astronaut-astronomer Steven A.
Hawley, part of the five-member crew that is set to launch
Discovery on Tuesday.
   Among the mysteries that Hubble might help explain are quasars,
pulsars and black holes, as well as the precise origin of the
universe and the possible existence of other solar systems and life
forms.
   But the telescope's most extraordinary find during its 15-year
odyssey likely will be one not yet envisioned, said Eric Chaisson,
senior scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute at Johns
Hopkins University.
   ``The history of science has shown the greatest discoveries are
those the human imagination has not even conceived,'' he said. ``We
are going to demand that the Hubble look into regions of total
darkness, to look where nobody has ever looked, hoping by design to
discover the unexpected.''
   From its perch 380 miles high, the Hubble will be free of
atmospheric distortion and therefore able to detect light of all
wavelengths, including ultraviolet. The telescope will be capable
of discerning objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater
clarity than the best observatory on Earth.
   Astronomers expect to study stars and galaxies so distant their
light has been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
   The universe is believed to have been created 15 billion or so
years ago by a terrific explosion known as the Big Bang. That
theory is based on the discovery by the late American astronomer
Edwin P. Hubble that the universe constantly is expanding.
   The shuttle mission that will put the observatory named for that
pioneer into orbit has been eagerly awaited by NASA and scientists
around the world for more than a decade.
   The Hubble Space Telescope originally was scheduled for launch
in 1983, five years after receiving government funding. Technical
problems postponed liftoff for several years, and the mission was
delayed to 1989 by the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986.
   Concern over Discovery's solid rocket boosters pushed the
mission back yet again to mid-April so the booster's lower right
segment could be replaced.
   Minor problems continued to crop up, such as the discovery that
several dozen midges, tiny mosquito-like insects, had invaded a
payload preparation room at the launch pad. Engineers feared the
bugs might damage the 24,250-pound, 43-foot-long telescope, and
installation was postponed while the midges were rounded up.
   Later, a broken pipe sprayed water on electrical equipment and
knocked out air conditioning. Some heat-sensitive computers were
shut down, temporarily interrupting testing of the telescope's
scientific instruments.
   ``Every new problem makes you a little uptight. But we've
survived,'' said Bill Taylor, the telescope's chief engineer.
   Until the telescope arrived at Kennedy Space Center last
October, engineers had taken advantage of the numerous delays to
upgrade the instrument and make it easier to care for in space.
   The telescope, at $1.5 billion, is the most expensive unmanned
spacecraft ever built by NASA. An additional $500 million has been
spent to stockpile spare parts, train astronauts and develop
computer software to operate the instrument. The European Space
Agency is paying 15 percent of the costs.
   Discovery's five astronauts say they won't breathe easy until
the Hubble is safe in space. For scientists, the nerve-racking wait
will be longer.
   ``Their hearts are going to be beating, they're going to have
butterflies and they're not going to be happy until several weeks
after we release it and they start getting data,'' said Marine Col.
Charles F. Bolden Jr., Discovery's pilot.
   Hawley will use the shuttle's 50-foot-long robot arm to remove
the Hubble from Discovery on the second day of the five-day
mission. NASA wants to deploy the telescope as soon as possible
into the flight to minimize the risk of contaminating its 8-foot
primary optical mirror.
   ``We're taking every possible precaution to be able to back up
any potential problem that we have in deploying the telescope,''
said William Reeves, NASA's lead flight director for the mission.
   Mission specialists Bruce McCandless II and Kathryn Sullivan,
veteran spacewalkers, will go out to help extricate, adjust or
repair the telescope, if necessary. The cabin's pressure will be
lowered three hours into the flight and remain low for several days
to shorten the four-hour response time normally required for a
spacewalk.
   It is estimated the Hubble will cost $200 million a year to
operate and maintain in orbit.
   Within a month or two, data for test images will be sent via
satellite to the Space Telescope Operations Control Center at
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the Space
Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore.
   Six scientific committees chose 160 proposals from the world's
astronomers, including five amateurs, for the instrument's first
year of observation starting in December. Ten times more observing
time was requested than the institute was able to grant. Every
year, new proposals will be accepted.
   In 1993, a shuttle is scheduled to go up to service the
telescope and, since its orbit inevitably will decay over time,
boost it back up to a proper altitude. Further maintenance missions
will be scheduled every three years. Any emergency work would have
to be squeezed into the shuttle's already crowded flight agenda,
said Discovery's commander, Air Force Col. Loren J. Shriver.
   ``More than likely, you would have to dedicate a mission because
the altitudes are so high,'' Shriver said.
   Discovery's ascent to 380 miles will be the highest a shuttle
has ever gone. The astronauts will bring the telescope back if it
cannot be deployed safely. But that would be a last resort, Hawley
said.
   ``We're going to do anything we can do to leave the telescope in
orbit so that it has a chance for a mission,'' Hawley said.

   Retailers reported encouraging results for March despite a later
Easter shopping season and appear set to record strong sales growth
this month as the important promotional period gets into full swing.
   Thomas H. Tashjian, an analyst at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.,
said April could be a robust month, particularly for retailers
specializing in apparel. He said the investment firm might raise
its financial forecasts for the first-quarter performances of
several shopping-mall-based clothing chains.
   Reports from some of the country's big store chains released
Thursday showed little or no sales growth in March, largely because
Easter falls in April this year, three weeks later than in 1989.
   Nevertheless, demand for spring fashions and a temporary spell
of warm weather boosted business at apparel-oriented retailers.
   Executives of a few major general merchandise and department
store chains said they were satisfied with their results. In a
small number of cases, March sales surpassed the weak levels
retailers had projected privately in advance.
   ``On balance, they are slightly better than expected,'' said
Wayne Hood, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``We can
look forward to a continuing good trend in April.''
   The results overall were decent given that holiday promotions
timed to capitalize on the Easter season had not begun. Sales of
Easter baskets, candy and decorations _ items important especially
to discounters _ normally begin in earnest 10 days before the
holiday.
   Last month's tallies were measured against a year earlier, when
retailers benefited from a traditional pickup in shopping ahead of
Palm and Easter Sundays, a time that brings extra customers into
stores hunting for new outfits.
   Apparel sales outpaced other types of merchandise in March,
continuing a pattern that has prevailed for more than a year. Sales
of hard goods, such as expensive household appliances, were softer.
   Mediocre economic growth has kept consumers cautious about
spending heavily or going deeper into debt to finance costly
purchases. Car buying, for instance, has been very sluggish.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. stood out from the rest of the pack. The
Bentonville, Ark.-based discounter posted a 27 percent March sales
spurt over a year earlier. Sales excluding the take t stores opened
within the year rose 12 percent.
   Results at stores open a year or longer, called same- or
comparable-store sales, give the best indication of a retailer's
performance.
   J.C. Penney Co., based in Dallas, said its store and catalog
sales rose 9.7 percent in the five weeks ended March 31. On a
comparable store basis, sales gained 8.7 percent. Much of Penney's
business is in apparel.
   Two big mass merchandisers, Sears, Roebuck and Co. and
Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., posted sales growth of under 2 percent.
   Analysts said the two Chicago-based chains did reasonably well _
possibly better than their executives thought they would _
considering the tough comparison against last March.
   Sears, the nation's biggest retailer, said March sales rose 1.3
percent and were up 1.6 percent on a same-store basis.
   Montgomery Ward's sales grew 1.8 percent. It did not report
results for comparable stores. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Bernard F. Brennan said the performance ``indicates a continuing
growth trend'' when viewed against an 8.5 percent jump in March
1989 sales.
   A retailer that apparently didn't fare as poorly as it expected
was Woolworth Corp., the New York-based parent of numerous
specialty stores, including Foot Locker athletic shoe shops.
   Domestic sales edged down 1 percent in the five weeks ended
March 31 from March 1989. Same-store sales were off a steeper 3.7
percent. Including foreign sales, Woolworth had a 2.5 percent
increase in total March sales.
   Harold E. Sells, Woolworth's chairman and chief executive
officer, said the domestic results ``exceeded our plan, and while
total sales for the period showed only a small gain over the
prior-year period, they were satisfactory considering the fact that
last year's March results included the important Easter selling
season.''
   By contrast, Ames Department Stores Inc. said its March sales
slumped 12 percent from a year earlier while its same-store sales
were off 13.5 percent. The Rocky Hill, Conn.-based discounter
blamed the later Easter season.
   Additional reports from retailers are due next week. K mart
Corp., Dayton Hudson Corp., The Limited Inc. and others will issue
their March results on April 12.

   Here are the domestic March sales reported Thursday by some of
the nation's largest retailers.
   Due to differing calendars, many of the major companies that in
recent years issued monthly results on the first Thursday of each
month now are reporting later. Results are due April 12 from K mart
Corp., Dayton Hudson Corp., The Limited Inc. and others.
   Several top retailers do not report their sales monthly,
including: Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores
Corp., the Campeau Corp. units; R.H. Macy &amp; Co. and Batus Inc. Not
all retailers have the same fiscal year.

<HEAD>Securities Pros Insulted by `Wall Street' Lotto Game</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Washington state lottery named ``Wall
Street'' has irked the securities industry by implying that
stockpicking is more risky than a crap shoot, but gaming experts
say it's a clever idea.
   ``Players can experience the exciting world of `Wall Street'
investing without the risks,'' says a press release by the
Washington State Lottery, which starts the game Monday. Prizes for
a $1 ticket range as high as $10,000 and buyers have better than a
1-in-5 chance of winning something, it said.
   ``The `Wall Street' game offers advantages not found in trading
on that New York City street,'' the lottery's director Evelyn Sun
said in the press release. ```Wall Street' is just the ticket for
the player who wants to experience the thrill of high-stakes
investing. And `Wall Street' players cannot lose more than they
invested.''
   On the real-life Wall Street, professional strategists were
insulted when told about the game Thursday. Some said it was unfair
to equate serious investing with gambling. Others said the
Washington game would only reinforce a prejudice that the stock
market is no better than a casino.
   ``It's only people who speculate and don't know what they're
doing who get killed or get sucked in by the market,'' said Yale
Hirsch, a prominent investment adviser who publishes the Stock
Trader's Almanac.
   ``The Washington game should be called Atlantic City or Las
Vegas. It's really a punch in the nose to Wall Street.''
   Edward I. O'Brien, chairman of the Securities Industry
Association, Wall Street's national trade group, said he wished
Washington would find another name for the game.
   ``Of all the states that have lotteries, this is the state that
gave us WPPSS,'' O'Brien said, referring to the Washington Public
Power Supply System, biggest municipal bond defaulter in history.
``Whoops, there they go again.''
   Washington is one of 32 states that run officially sanctioned
gaming operations. Its lottery is about 7 years old.
   The Wall Street game works much like lottery scratch games in
other states. Players scratch across rows of boxes to reveal
amounts under ``Buy,'' ``Sell'' and ``Profit.'' If a sell number is
higher than a buy number in the same row, the player wins the price
revealed in the profit box on the right.
   Richard Paulson, a spokesman for the Washington State Lottery,
said the Wall Street theme was devised about six months ago, the
50th scratch game offered by the state's lottery since it began.
Paulson said he saw no reason for the securities industry to be
insulted.
   ``Obviously, we're trying to build a sense of excitement into
our game,'' he said. ``We think this is an innovative name. It
certainly conjures up the idea of riches and money, except it's
fun.''
   Saul F. Leonard, national partner and head of the gaming
industries division of Laventhol &amp; Horwath, an accounting and
lottery consulting firm in Los Angeles, said he thought the real
Wall Street had little to gripe about.
   ``They're part of the public domain,'' he said. ``I think they
should be flattered the name Wall Street would attract people to
play.''
   Most state lotteries that sell scratch games concoct new themes
every few months to stimulate sales. But most focus on other games,
such as cards, horse racing, baseball and bowling.
   Some professional stock pickers found the Wall Street theme
amusing.
   ``I'm ready to play,'' said Stan Weinstein, a widely followed
strategist who publishes the newsletter Professional Tape Reader.
``I think we all take ourselves too seriously. It's a cute concept.
But obviously I think real life investing is a bit less risky.''
   William Knowlton, a spokesman for the lottery in New York, Wall
Street's own home state, also called Washington state's idea a
creative innovation. He said many real-life Wall Streeters are
lottery fans themselves.
   ``We always have good lines down there when our jackpot gets
big,'' he said.

<HEAD>CFTC Puts Broker Association Rule Out for Comment</HEAD>

   The agency that regulates the futures markets
is moving closer to correcting problems uncovered in the scandals
on the Chicago exchanges.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission voted unanimously
Thursday to submit for public comment a proposed rule that would
provide a legal definition of broker associations and require them
to register with the exchange at which they do business.
   Broker associations have been loosely defined as formal or
informal groups of futures traders formed to provide more capital
to finance trades and more people to handle them.
   But the CFTC's Division of Trading and Markets concluded in a
study reported on last January that broker associations ``may
increase the potential for certain types of trading abuses.''
   The study was an outgrowth of last year's undercover
investigation of trading at the Chicago Board of Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange _ the nation's two largest futures
exchanges _ which resulted in the indictment of more than 40
traders.
   Only five of the 13 futures exchanges have rules defining broker
associations. Of those only the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, New
York's Commodity Exchange and the Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange
require broker associations to register.
   CFTC staffers believe that keeping tabs on broker associations
will help deter abuses in the trading pits. Commission members
agreed by a 5-0 vote.
   ``I believe very strongly that we identify and register these
groups and I also agree that it gives a big assist and augmentation
to our surveillance program to have this information,'' said
Commissioner Kalo A. Hineman.
   As defined in the CFTC's proposed rules, ``broker association''
refers to two or more exchange members who share responsibility for
executing customer orders, profits or losses from trading
activities, or access to each other's unfilled customer orders.
   The rule would bar participation in the trading activities of a
broker association unless the association is registered with the
market or exchange.
   Interested parties have 60 days to comment on the proposed rule
before the CFTC takes a final vote on it.

<HEAD>Wall Street Firm Expects First-Quarter Profit</HEAD>

   Salomon Brothers Inc. had a strong first quarter
despite the continued slump across much of Wall Street, the
securities firm's parent company said.
   Salomon Inc. said Thursday it would post a first-quarter profit
because a strong performance by its securities unit offset a slump
at its oil trading subsidiary.
   Chairman John H. Gutfreund said the company will show ``good
quarterly earnings'' when results are announced April 24. In the
first quarter of 1989, the company lost $28 million, or 35 cents a
share.
   Gutfreund said profits at the brokerage arm were broadly based
in the latest quarter.
   Salomon recently has been driven by its Phibro Energy oil
refining and trading unit. Phibro was largely responsible for the
firm's $470 million 1989 profit that confounded a major Wall Street
slump.
   But Gutfreund said Phibro was expected to post only a modest
profit in the January-March quarter, while the company's Philipp
Brothers commodities trading unit would continue to be a drag on
the firm. The two together would show a small loss, analysts said.
   Lawrence Eckenfelder, an industry analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said Salomon's securities arm ``made a ton of
money'' in March following a slow period in the first two months of
the year.
   ``It indicates while it's generally been a bleak quarter there
have been a few lines of business that have done OK,'' Eckenfelder
said, citing corporate and government securities trading as two
improving areas.
   Salomon officials also indicated that unspecified trading
strategies implemented in recent months had paid off.
   Analysts said the weaker quarter at Phibro was due to eroding
oil prices and narrowing refining margins. Analysts remain hesitant
to project higher earnings in coming quarters because Salomon
relies heavily on the up-and-down nature of trading.
   ``Their earnings are very volatile,'' Eckenfelder said.
``They're very trading dependent and they have relatively high
fixed costs right now.''
   In light of Gutfreund's announcement, Eckenfelder said he would
raise his quarterly per-share earnings estimate for Salomon to 85
cents from 30 cents. For the full year, the analyst said he would
increase the estimate to $3.20 from $2.65.
   Phibro claims to be the world's largest trader of oil and the
fourth-largest independent refiner in the United States. It made
$367 million before taxes last year, while Salomon Brothers, which
is supposed to be the company's main business, made $490 million.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A modest sales upturn in late March has boosted
prospects that the slump in the U.S. auto industry is ending, but
the rebound isn't being shared by everyone.
   Chrysler Corp. was the most notable exception as its car sales
fell behind those of Japanese rivals Honda and Toyota last month.
   ``We think the industry bottomed in sales in November of 1989
and that production bottomed in January of '90,'' analyst Doug
Laughlin of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New York said Thursday.
   Laughlin said sales bottomed out in November and have improved
since then, with a few minor setbacks.
   In sales figures reported Wednesday, domestic automakers said
they sold 2.9 percent more cars and trucks in late March than in
the corresponding period last year.
   Analysts and others are quick to point out that drawing a
conclusion from a 10-day reporting period can be dangerous because
it is such a tiny sample of a huge industry.
   However, Laughlin and others say they are beginning to wonder if
the industry is rebounding, especially with other economic factors
figured in.
   ``The strong income growth and job creation and a stable prime
rate has created a nice underpinning for sales,'' said Scott Merlis
of Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. of New York.
   But that underlying demand apparently hasn't reached Chrysler's
cars, partly because of Honda's and Toyota's U.S. assembly plants.
   With imports counted in, Chrysler dealers sold 70,849 cars last
month, just less than the 71,086 sold by Honda. Toyota sold 79,320
cars, or about nine for every eight sold by Chrysler.
   ``They have conceded some market share in cars,'' Laughlin said
of the nation's No. 3 auto maker. ``They are the most
truck-oriented company in the business.''
   Chrysler sold 73,665 trucks last month, 4 percent more than its
cars.
   ``I don't see much reason for that to change in the next few
months,'' said auto analyst David Healy of the brokerage
Barclays-BZW in New York. ``Chrysler has been slipping in retail
passenger car market share recently.''
   For all of March, Chrysler held 7.6 percent of the market for
North American built cars, down from 9.4 percent during March 1989.
General Motors Corp. held 33.2 percent of the market last month and
Ford Motor Co. had 20.4 percent, each down 0.3 percentage points.
   Chrysler and Ford reported declines in their late March car
sales of 23.7 percent and 8.1 percent respectively, while GM posted
a 3.9 percent increase.
   Sales have been slumping since last October, and executives of
the Big Three have forecast that the first half of this year would
remain soft before sales pick up in the second half.
   In January, assembly lines nationwide ground to a halt
temporarily as automakers took drastic steps to shrink new-car
inventories, estimated to be more than 90 selling days, by shutting
off the flow of vehicles at the source.
   The strategy appears to have worked.
   At the end of February, according to the weekly industry journal
Ward's Automotive Reports, new-car inventories stood at 66 days,
considered good for early spring.
   That level, when combined with what some analysts say is a
strengthening demand and a stable economy, could indicate a rebound
is on the way.
   ``I think fingers are crossed that the worst is behind us,''
Laughlin said.
   Other analysts, including Healy, were more cautious.
   ``I think the best way to look at it is the (sales) numbers for
the full month,'' he said. ``If you do that, not a great deal is
happening.''

<HEAD>Phillips Petroleum Introduces Its Version Of Cleaner Gasoline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH PICHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Phillips Petroleum Co. has joined the growing
number of oil companies to introduce a reformulated gasoline
designed to be less harmful to the environment than existing grades.
   Phillips' reformulated fuel _ blended to reduce certain
hydrocarbon emissions _ will be tested in St. Louis, one of more
than 100 cities that fall below the Environmental Protection
Agency's minimum standards for air quality, the company said
Thursday.
   The rush by America's oil companies to make gasoline less toxic
comes in response to stepped up government efforts to reduce air
emissions from the tailpipes of cars and trucks.
   George Gaspar, a stock analyst for Robert W. Baird &amp; Co. in
Milwaukee, said oil companies are trying to protect their markets
by developing ``cleaner'' gasoline that will help auto companies
meet tougher air emission standards.
   ``If the auto companies don't get any help they may have to take
some major actions that could hurt the petroleum industry,'' said
Gaspar. ``We're going to hear a lot about how great reformulated
gasoline is.''
   Phillips, based in Bartlesville, Okla., sells gasoline in the
Midwest. It selected St. Louis for the test because of the
company's strong selling base in the area.
   The reformulated gasoline is blended to reduce the amounts of
certain hydrocarbons, such as aromatics, benzene and olefins, that
react with the atmosphere and produce ozone, a main component of
smog.
   Charles Bowerman, a Phillips senior vice president, said the
mid-grade gasoline, SuperClean Unleaded Plus, contains 20 to 30
percent less olefins and aromatics and 35 percent less benzene than
the average gasoline sold in the St. Louis area. The company did
not make a comparison with the average gasoline sold nationally.
   The new gasoline is made by removing the more toxic compounds
and replacing them with methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether, a blending
component with a high oxygen content.
   Other oil companies that have introduced reformulated gasolines
include Arco, Marathon, Exxon, Amoco, Mobil, Citgo and Sun Oil.
   While the new gasolines are slightly better for the environment,
they're only a small step in attempts to end smog and other
pollution in America's cities, said Scott Denman, director of the
Safe Energy Communication Council.
   ``They're missing the forest for the trees,'' said Denman.
``These new gasolines are a little more benign on the environment,
but they are not the best way for us to reduce pollution.''
   The Safe Energy Communication Council, based in Washington, is a
national coalition of environmental groups working to promote
alternate energy sources and better use of current ones.
   Denman said that while Phillips and other of the nation's oil
companies tout their efforts to devise ``environmentally improved''
gasoline, they're also ``fighting tooth and nail'' against
establishing higher fuel efficiency standards.
   Making cars more fuel efficient and reducing the amount of
gasoline burned in engines is the best way to clean up the
environment, Denman said.
   Auto companies could use more efficient fuel-injection systems,
build lighter motors, design more aerodynamic bodies, use lighter
materials and equip cars with ``fuel-smart'' tires that deflate and
inflate to improve gas mileage, he said.
   ``I'm not saying we shouldn't improve the gasoline, but I think
we should recognize it for what it is, a small step, and ask why
we're not taking some of the much bigger steps,'' Denman said.

<TEXT>
   Dawn Steel, the tough former Columbia
Pictures movie chief, has agreed to produce movies and TV
exclusively for Walt Disney Co.
   Ms. Steel's move to Disney as an independent producer had been
rumored since Sony Corp. bought Columbia for $3.4 billion last
September. Sony immediately brought in superproducers Peter Guber
and Jon Peters (``Batman,'' ``Rain Man'') to head Columbia, and Ms.
Steel quit in January.
   ``There just wasn't room for all three big egos over there,''
said Alex Ben Block, the editor of the Hollywood newsletter Show
Biz News.
   Ms. Steel is known as an aggressive fighter for her projects.
She also is known as difficult to work for, so tough that
California magazine ran her picture on the cover when it did a
story on the state's worst bosses, calling her ``the queen of
mean'' and ``hell on heels.''
   But as rough as she may be on secretaries, she is praised widely
for her knack of luring top filmmakers and actors into movies that
suit their talents.
   ``I have known Dawn for over 12 years and, based on our close
working relationship, I have only the greatest respect for her
abilities and accomplishments,'' Disney Chairman Michael Eisner
said Thursday as the deal was announced.
   She was out of town and unavailable for interviews Thursday, the
studio said.
   Before joining Columbia, Ms. Steel was president of production
for Paramount Pictures, where she was involved with hits such as
``Flashdance,'' ``Top Gun,'' ``Beverly Hills Cop II,'' ``The
Accused'' and ``Fatal Attraction.''
   In November 1987, she was hired as Columbia's president, the
highest position ever held by a woman in Hollywood. She replaced
David Puttnam, a British filmmaker who alienated many powerful
people in Hollywood with his attempts to buck the star system of
inflated egos and salaries.
   Ms. Steel is generally regarded as having stayed at Columbia for
too short a time to prove herself as a studio chief.
   ``I don't think anyone gets a fair chance to do anything in a
studio unless they are there 2{ to three years,'' said David
Hoberman, the president of Disney's Touchstone Pictures.
   Hoberman said Ms. Steel will develop family-oriented movies to
be released by the Disney studio as well as pictures for Touchstone
aimed at adult audiences.
   She will not produce any movies for Disney's recently launched
third studio, Hollywood Pictures, he said.
   A Disney statement said that in addition to movies and TV, Ms.
Steel will ``develop other projects for the company'', but provided
no details.
   Terms of her contract were not revealed, but Hoberman said, ``I
think it is about as strong a producing deal as is out there, with
one or two exceptions.''
   The comment referred to deals such as the one Paramount has made
with star producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Don Simpson, allowing
them to make movies without approval from the studio's head of
production. Ms. Steel apparently will have to get such approval.
   During Ms. Steel's tenure, Columbia released ``Casualties of
War,'' a Sean Penn-Michael J. Fox movie that died at the box
office, and ``Ghostbusters II,'' which made money but failed to
become the hoped-for blockbuster.
   Other successful releases were ``When Harry Met Sally ...,'' and
``Look Who's Talking,'' but those films were already under way when
she was hired.
   Yet-unreleased films she initiated include ``Postcards from the
Edge,'' directed by Mike Nichols and starring Meryl Streep, Shirley
MacLaine, Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman and Richard Dreyfuss;
``Awakenings,'' directed by Penny Marshall with Robert DeNiro and
Robin Williams; and ``Flatliners,'' produced by Michael Douglas and
starring Kiefer Sutherland and Julia Roberts.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped
sharply higher today with the market's key index posting its
third-largest gain ever.
   The dollar fell slightly against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues closed the week
at 29,278.78 points, up 1,029.72 points, or 3.65 percent.
   It was the index's third-largest single-day advance since it
posted a 2,037.32-point gain on Oct. 21, 1987, and a 1,215.22-point
gain on Jan. 6, 1988.
   The dollar closed at 157.47 yen, down 0.43 yen from Thursday's
close of 157.90 yen. After opening at 156.90 yen, the currency
ranged between 156.55 yen and 157.65 yen.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bond
slipped to 86.36 points, as of 3 p.m., compared to Thursday's close
of 86.55. The yield rose to 7.280 percent from the previous day's
7.240 percent.
   ``The market is almost dominated by buying orders,'' said Akiya
Shimoda, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities. ``The yen's
advance against the dollar is an encouraging factor.''
   ``Many investors, including institutional investors, have begun
to think that the index has reached its bottom level,'' Shimoda
said.
   He said the general mood of the market had begun to revive
during Thursday's afternoon session as major institutional
investors started active buying to support the falling market. On
Thursday, the index lost more than 1,000 points at one point before
closing with a 193.88-point loss.
   The market on Friday received buy orders for 160 million shares
at the market's opening, compared to sell orders of 46 million
shares, according to Daiwa Securities Co.
   In currency dealings, the dollar was making position adjustments
prior to a weekend meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized
nations in Paris.
   Akihiko Kagawa, a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, said some
market participants expect that ``there will be some policy
initiative to defend the yen'' against the dollar in Saturday's
meeting of monetary authorities from the United States, Japan, West
Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
   The dollar ``will remain in a relatively narrow range by the end
of the G-7 meeting, though a demand for dollars by institutional
investors remains strong,'' said another dealer with Fuji Bank who
spoke anonymously.
   Bank of Tokyo's Kagawa said there was ``no significant effect''
on the exchange market from Thursday's agreement between the United
States and Japan pledging to reduce trade frictions by making
broad-based reforms in the economies of both countries.
   The agreement, reached after several months of discussions
between U.S. and Japanese negotiators under the Structural
Impediments Initiative, set forth a set of proposals aimed at
reducing a $49 billion U.S. deficit with Japan by easing barriers
to trade and investment.

   The dollar was lower against other major
currencies in quiet trading in Europe this morning. Gold prices
advanced.
   Traders said they did not expect much movement in the dollar as
investors waited for the release of U.S. unemployment figures later
today, and with the Group of Seven industrial nations meeting in
Paris over the weekend.
   ``I'd say the mood is still positive on the dollar, neutral on
the (West German) mark and negative on the yen,'' one Milan trader
said. ``But everyone is watching to see if the G-7 meeting produces
a renewed initiative for the yen.''
   Traders said they doubted the G-7 finance ministers would be
able to create new support for the weak yen, given Japan's
reluctance to raise interest rates further and the ineffectiveness
of central bank intervention to shore up the Japanese currency.
   The Group of Seven countries are the United States, West
Germany, Japan, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.43 yen to close at 157.47 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a lower rate of 157.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.6965 West German marks, down from 1.6997;
1.4995 Swiss francs, down from 1.5010; 5.7035 French francs, down
from 5.7155; 1.9067 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9123; 1,247.50
Italian lire, down from 1,250.50; and 1.1665 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1685.
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, which was
quoted at $1.6392, compared with $1.6427 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $375.25 a troy ounce,
down from $377 bid late Thursday. But at midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a higher recommended price of $380.35.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $379, up from $376.50 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at a bid $379.43, up $4.09
from Wednesday's close. The market was closed Thursday for a
holiday.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.15 a troy ounce from
Thursday $5.18.

   Here are the cities that exceeded federal air
quality standards for smog pollution in 1988, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency.
   The number reflects the second-highest daily one-hour
concentration in parts per million of ozone found in the air. Ozone
is a product of emissions of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides and
the chief component of smog. The federal standard for ozone is 0.12
ppm, a level not to be exceeded more than once per year.

   UAL's stock closed at $165.50 Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange. UAL has more than 21.8 million shares outstanding.
   In a statement today, the board said it had agreed in principle
with United Employee Acquisition Corp., the company representing
the unions, to the sale.
   The board said both sides ``expect to conclude a final agreement
promptly.''
   The directors had negotiated with the unions, which represent
United's pilots, machinists and flight attendants, in the two weeks
since the board rejected a $185-a-share, or $4 billion, offer.
   The employee bid was supported by UAL's largest shareholder,
Coniston Partners, which holds an 11.8 percent stake. Coniston has
said it would wage a proxy fight to oust UAL's board at the
company's April 26 shareholders meeting if a deal wasn't reached.
   The earlier bid was reportedly opposed strongly by UAL Chairman
Stephen Wolf.
   A proposed $6.75 billion employee-led buyout of UAL collapsed
last October after the would-be purchasers were unable to line up
enough financing. The failure of that deal contributed to a
190-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial average on Oct. 13.

   The stock market advanced slightly today in a
muted response to the latest status report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.35 to 2,722.52 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 506 up, 389 down and
527 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 18.67 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department issued its monthly report on employment,
showing a drop in the civilian unemployment rate to 5.2 percent in
March from 5.3 percent in February.
   In a separate statistical measure that commands especially close
attention among stock and bond traders, the department said nonfarm
payroll employment increased by 26,000 last month _ well below
advance estimates and the smallest gain in more than 3{ years.
   That latter figure prompted a rise in Treasury bond prices of
nearly $5 for each $1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to
the 8.47 percent-8.53 percent range.
   But if stock investors were encouraged by the drop in interest
rates, the data also raised questions about whether the corporate
earnings outlook would improve any time soon.
   Tandem Computers was actively traded, up { at 23&lsqb;. The stock
tumbled 4} points Thursday, when the company said revenues for the
fiscal quarter that ended last weekend fell short of its target.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.18 to 187.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .31 at 360.92.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.80 to
2,721.17.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with
716 up, 726 down and 537 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 144.17 million shares, against 159.54
million in the previous session.

   Ford Motor Co. said Friday it is holding talks on
possibly selling its farm equipment operations to Italy's Fiat
Group.
   Separately, the two automakers are discussing altering their
current heavy truck agreement, which covers the making and
marketing of trucks in Europe.
   It is not clear whether the discussions involve just a sale or
swapping the farm machinery business for the truck operations.
   Ford, which sold its Rouge Steel operation late last year and
has its Ford Aerospace Corp. subsidiary up for sale, apparently is
interested in divesting all or part of Ford New Holland Inc., its
farm implement making subsidiary.
   Ford officials have said recently that the company is interested
in focusing on its auto- and truck-related businesses.
   In a joint statement, the automakers said any worldwide
agreements would preserve their respective brands and markets. Ford
and Fiat officials said there would be no further comment until a
definitive agreement is reached.
   In 1985, Ford and Fiat held discussions about a wide range of
worldwide associations. A year later, the two companies' heavy
truck operations joined forces in Europe through Iveco-Ford. Ford
and Fiat each owns 48 percent of Iveco-Ford; the rest is held by a
French-U.S. investment banking concern.
   Ford spokesman Bert Serre declined to give earnings figures for
the European truck operations but said Ford was pleased with its
performance.
   Ford bought the New Holland, Pa.-based farm machinery builder in
1986 for $330 million from Sperry Corp. Ford does not report
financial data on New Holland, but the subsidiary is estimated to
have annual sales of about $3 billion.

<HEAD>Browning-Ferris Pulls Out of Hazardous Waste Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Browning-Ferris Industries Inc., a waste disposal
giant, announced it is getting out of the hazardous waste business
and taking a $295 million charge against earnings in the second
quarter.
   Hazardous waste business added 2 percent to the Houston-based
company's business, but reduced earnings by 10 percent and
accounted for ``75 percent of our headaches,'' John Stanton,
Browning-Ferris' chief financial officer said Thursday.
   The hazardous waste collection, treatment and disposal
businesses, which the company operated under its BFI Environmental
Systems Inc. and CECOS International Inc. subsidiaries, have lost
money for a year and a half.
   BFI Environmental and CECOS lost $26.6 million last year and
$5.2 million in the first quarter of the fiscal year ended Dec. 31.
Total Revenue last year was $60 million.
   ``It's a significant event,'' said Jerald Cobbs, analyst for
Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc. of Houston. ``It says how difficult a
business it is to operate in.''
   Stanton said regulatory problems at two of its four waste
facilities figured heavily into BFI's decision.
   CECOS has agreed to plead guilty to one violation of Ohio
environmental law in connection with activities at its Williamsburg
facility and to pay a $25,000 fine.
   Separately, under a consent decree, CECOS has agreed to pay the
state of Ohio a civil penalty of $1.5 million, establish a $1
million environmental trust fund for the state and pay $1 million
to Clermont County. CECOS also will be required to close the
facility.
   The company also was turned down for a permit to continue adding
waste to its Niagara Falls, N.Y., facility, although it is being
used as a non-hazardous industrial waste. Other CECOS land disposal
sites are in Louisiana and Colorado.
   BFI said it will operate the hazardous waste business until it
is sold or converted to non-hazardous uses, or until the hazardous
waste assets are otherwise disposed of. That could take about two
and a half years.
   About 800 employees will be affected, many of whom BFI expects
to stay with operations as they are sold.

   The nation's unemployment rate edged down to
5.2 percent last month despite the smallest increase in new jobs in
four years, the government said today.
   The jobless rate had held steady at 5.3 percent for the previous
nine months.
   The nation's manufacturing slump continued, with a loss of
30,000 factory jobs in March, the Labor Department said in
releasing the unemployment report, the first comprehensive look at
economic activity for the month.
   That brought manufacturing job losses to 100,000 since November
and 250,000 over the past year, the department said.
   The jobless rate dropped even though only 26,000 new jobs were
created in March. Most analysts had been predicting that the
economy would produce around 170,000 new jobs last month. The
26,000 new jobs was the fewest produced since June 1986 when
110,000 jobs were lost, the government said.
   More than 350,000 new jobs were produced in both January and
February.
   The government's household survey said total employment rose
slightly in March to 118.3 million and that the labor force edged
up to about 124.8 million.
   The Labor Department surveys businesses for statistics on job
gains and losses.
   The losses were offset by gains in the services industries,
which added 125,000 jobs, and the federal government, which added
75,000 Census Bureau workers and other employees.
   Since November, the number of jobs in the services sector of the
economy has grown by more than 400,000.
   The government said that for the first quarter, there were about
750,000 so-called discouraged workers, or people who have given up
looking for jobs. That was the lowest level since the first quarter
of 1979.
   Michael Evans, who heads an economics firm in Washington, said
unemployment fell despite the weaker-than-expected increase in jobs
because the government's figures typically lag and reflect a
previous month's activity. That means the fewer jobless Americans
in March benefited from the healthy gains earlier in the year.
   ``I don't think it's a negative report, even though job gains
were kind of puny,'' Evans said.
   He noted that for the January-to-March period, jobs gained an
average of 250,000 a month.
   The average manufacturing work week held steady in March at 40.7
percent while overtime increased from 3.6 hours to 3.7 hours.
   Average hourly earnings increased from $9.88 to $9.92 for a 0.4
percent change, the government said.
   Over the past year, many economists have predicted a slight rise
in unemployment this year. Federal Reserve policymakers have
forecast a rate between 5.5 percent and 5.75 percent.
   The unemployment rates among major demographic groups last month
were:
   _Adult white men, 4.0 percent, up from 4.1 percent in February.
   _Adult white women, 3.9 percent, down from 4.1 percent.
   _White teen-agers, 12.7 percent, down from 13.2 percent.
   _All blacks, 10.6 percent, up from 10.5 percent.
   _Adult black men, 9.6 percent, up from 9.2 percent.
   _Adult black women, 9.0 percent, down from 9.4 percent.
   _Black teen-agers, 26.2 percent, down from 27.5 percent.
   _Hispanics, 7.7 percent, down from 7.8 percent.
   In a separate calculation of unemployment that counts members of
the armed services stationed in the United States, the March
jobless rate was 5.1 percent, down from February's 5.2 percent.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Turn Lower After Mixed Opening</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures prices turned lower
after a mixed opening today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The corn and soybean markets opened with solid gains, supported
by indications the Soviet Union bought as much a million metric
tons of U.S. corn.
   But the Soviets also were said to have purchased large amounts
of corn and other grains from Argentina, which dampened buying
enthusiasm.
   ``I think when everybody figured it all out, it looks like the
Argentinians are going to get all the business,'' said John
Frazier, director of agricultural futures trading for Gerald Inc.
in Chicago.
   ``I think we're going to have a big washout,'' he said.
   Analysts also attributed some early selling to pre-weekend
profit-taking after three strong days, especially in the soybean
market.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 to 2 cents lower with May
at $3.68 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1} cents lower with May at
$2.70\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to } cent lower with May at
$1.52\ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 2 cents lower with May
at $5.96{ a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .35 cent higher with April at 79.30
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .40 cent higher with
April at 83.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .40 cent lower to .35
cent higher with April at 54.45 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .28 cent to .90 cent higher with May at 56.17 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Thursday.

   The world's two most powerful economies have
become inextricably wedded. But too often the relationship between
the United States and Japan seems like a bad marriage characterized
by frequent spats. What do the two have in common apart from money?

   Never mind trade tensions. At Sam Kusumoto's
company, a recent office party was enough to put a crimp in
U.S.-Japan relations.
   There wasn't an argument or even a minor contretemps at the
affair. Many of the American employees just didn't show up. It
seems they didn't know about it in time, explains Kusumoto,
president of Minolta USA in suburban Ramsey, N.J.
   ``At Japanese companies, we have very nice horizontal
communication,'' he says. ``Everybody listens to what the other guy
is talking about over the phone. After office hours we associate.''
   So plans for just about everything spread chattily through the
ranks _ in Japanese, of course. Formal notice, American-style, is
almost an afterthought.
   ``The Americans didn't hear about the party,'' Kusumoto says.
``And when they discovered the date was decided months ago they got
upset.''
   A simple miscue, but behind it lay a gulf of misunderstanding
that somehow has defied nearly 50 years of U.S.-Japan amity and
more than a century of cultural exchange since 19th century Japan,
under American prodding, cast off its feudal kosode (robes).
   Today more than ever, the world's two most powerful economies
have become inextricably wedded. But too often the relationship
seems like a bad marriage characterized by frequent squabbles and
little in common apart from money.
   The tensions have appeared in numerous forms, despite the best
efforts of both sides to avoid them: in charges of discrimination
by American employees of Japanese companies, in a hardhearted new
appraisal by Washington of its one-time protege, and vice versa.
And not least, in an undercurrent of racism.
   The racism often surfaces subtly. When Japanese companies
purchased such American corporate icons as Columbia Pictures and
New York's Rockefeller Center last year, the headlines often read
``The Japanese Buy ...,'' as if the entire nation were bent,
samurai-like, on the takeover.
   In contrast, other major foreign purchasers _ British, Canadian,
Dutch _have been described more accurately as individual companies.
   Part of it is the sheer cultural impact of Japan's new wealth,
an economic sea change that made Japan the world's largest creditor
by the end of the 1980s, and its former patron, the United States,
the largest debtor.
   ``It's the Japanese rate of buying that's frightening,'' says
Marlene Rossman, a New York-based consultant to New York companies.
   Japan is now second only to Great Britain in U.S. investments.
From May 1987 to last May, the number of U.S. factories with at
least partial Japanese ownership nearly doubled from 550 to 1,043,
according to the Japan External Trade Organization.
   Japan's total investment in U.S. real estate, corporations and
subsidiaries soared from $4.7 billion in 1980 to $53.4 billion in
1988, according to the most recent Commerce Department figures.
Japanese companies now hold about 50 percent of the commercial real
estate in downtown Los Angeles, more than 20 prime properties in
Manhattan, including Tiffany's, and substantial holdings in
Washington.
   It is not over the issue of Washington real estate, however, but
closer to the heart of the nation's capital that U.S.-Japanese
tensions have perhaps cut deepest.
   Particularly irksome were the 1989 trade figures released in
February. The United States enjoyed a $1.5 billion surplus with the
12-nation European Community, a sharp turnaround from a $9.2
billion deficit in 1988. But with Japan, despite a sharp decline in
the dollar engineered to help U.S. exports, the deficit was a
stubborn $49 billion.
   That was no appreciable improvement from the previous year's
$51.8 billion deficit with Japan, even with an 18 percent increase
in U.S. export sales, says J. Michael Farren, undersecretary for
international trade in the Commerce Department.
   The trade frictions are aggravated by what many in Congress and
the Bush administration see as the Japanese government's xenophobic
resistance to open markets and cultural disposition to treat trade
as economic warfare.
   ``The fallacy in asking the Japanese to open their markets is
they haven't got the foggiest idea what an open market is,'' says
Clyde Prestowitz, a former Commerce Department negotiator whose
influential 1988 book, ``Trading Places,'' portrayed Japan as
having carefully planned its export-fueled ascendancy.
   In Tokyo, Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said U.S.
analysts were wrong in arguing that Japan's culture was an
unchangeable barrier to concepts like an open market. Last week,
under growing threat of trade sanctions from the Bush
administration, Japanese and U.S. negotiators put the finishing
touches on an unprecedented agreement to liberalize Japan's market,
including its tightly controlled goods distribution system.
   In addition, experts point out, Japan has been gradually moving
from an export-based to a domestic market-based economy.
   Japan has a long history of adapting foreign ideas, Watanabe
said, ``and there is no reason why we cannot continue to do so.''
   One reason, however, is that the Japanese are not as keen on
foreign ideas these days, an attitude born of Japan's pride in its
postwar ``miracle'' and a growing contempt for the United States'
persistent problems.

   Investigators are poring through records
seized from escort services they say catered to businessmen,
athletes, entertainers and politicians who paid up to $1,000 a
night for a prostitute and charged it.
   ``This hits the highest-priced call girls in prostitution,''
said Maury Dettmer, chief of criminal investigations for the
Internal Revenue Service. ``These are not street-level hookers. The
average receipts were for $800 to $1,000 an evening.''
   By Thursday, six people _ three in California and one each in
Fort Lauderdale, Dallas and Atlanta _ were in custody, charged with
prostitution, weapons or drug offenses uncovered during the
investigation.
   Other arrests on money laundering, tax evasion, racketeering and
organized crime charges are planned, Dettmer said.
   Undercover agents, working out of a storefront in Tampa, posed
as launderers able to disguise charge card payments, so customers
could bill the services on company cards, officials said.
   During a two-year sting, Tampa-based agents said they laundered
$2.5 million in charge payments from escort services in major
cities.
   Since business executives don't want a charge from an escort
service on their card, escort services would pay to hide the
charge, showing it for something such as a copying service, said an
agent who worked undercover on the operation in Savannah.
   Authorities called a news conference at the Tampa storefront
Thursday to announce raids on more than 40 escort services
overnight Wednesday and early Thursday.
   ``We processed $2.5 million in credit-card receipts, or about 20
percent of their total gross receipts, which we estimate to be
about $12 million annually,'' Dettmer said.
   ``We targeted escort services who advertised in the Yellow Pages
that accept credit cards,'' he said, adding: ``The reason they take
credit cards is because businessmen traveling have company credit
cards. Companies then deduct it as a business expense.
   ``So not only do we have unreported income from the escort
services, but we have false tax deductions by the businesses who
used credit cards.''
   The sting began small in Tampa, said Steve Cole, spokesman for
the Tampa Police Department. But as word spread among escort
services, business boomed. More than 25,000 credit-card receipts
for escort services from 23 cities in 15 states were processed,
officials said.
   ``It just kept getting bigger and bigger,'' Cole said.
   Local police contacted the IRS after they were bombarded with
laundering requests from as many as 100 companies.
   Agents sent out letters soliciting business, Cole said. They
charged a fee of 13 percent to 18 percent. The money they collected
paid for rent, telephones and other related charges.
   Officials said it worked this way: An escort service sent charge
slips to the Tampa office; agents made up other slips in the name
of Sunset Enterprises and sent them to the bank; then the bank sent
the money to Sunset and the agents, in turn, paid the escort
services with checks that looked like tax-free loans.
   Typically, Cole said, a prostitute probably would collect $500,
the escort service $300 and the cops $200.
   In one instance, a madam in the business for more than 25 years
said she ran a house in North Carolina strictly for politicians and
could tell what day it was just by who was coming to the door,
investigators said.
   In another, a co-owner of an escort service bragged of paying
off local politicians to warn her if she was being investigated.
   In Mobile, Ala., about 20 agents searched two locations of
Candy's Movie Mates and the residence of the manager Wednesday
night. But Tim Lee, an IRS criminal investigator, said there were
no arrests. Evidence seized in the raids was turned over to the
U.S. Attorney's office.
   In Ohio, IRS agents seized records from escort services in
Columbus, Cleveland and the Dayton area.
   Records were taken from Dulcet International escort service in
the Columbus suburb of Whitehall, the Kitty Kats Touching Place
Adult Studio in Vandalia, near Dayton, and an several escort
services which operate out of the Crile House, a historic building
in Cleveland's Ohio City neighborhood.
   Seized in the raids were telephone records, telephone numbers,
license plate numbers and other documents.
   In Florida, law officers served search warrants on businesses in
Cape Coral, near Fort Myers, and in Fort Lauderdale and Plantation
in Broward County.

   The Bush administration today hailed the
U.S.-Japan trade agreement as marking a new era in relations but
cautioned that the accord must be followed by concrete action on
the part of Japan.
   ``We think we have a good blueprint for action and we got a good
downpayment,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
``Obviously, we want results and if they don't occur we would be
disappointed.''
   Hills' remarks to reporters at a briefing session was in
response to skeptical comments which greeted the document in
Congress. Many members said Japan had made broad promises before to
open its markets to foreign products but had failed to live up to
the agreements.
   Hills said the administration would be pushing for significant
follow-up to Thursday's accord, in which Japan promised to take a
series of measures to make it easier for foreigners to invest and
do business in Japan.
   She said both nations still had to come to terms on a final
report due in July and that even after that document was finished
she would consult frequently with the Japanese to monitor their
progress in implementing the commitments.
   In Tokyo today, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu warned his nation
that the coming economic changes could ``in some cases be
painful,'' but he promised they would lead to an improved quality
of life for the Japanese people.
   ``I ask for the understanding and cooperation of the people of
my country,'' Kaifu said in a televised appearance.
   The unprecedented agreement followed four days of marathon
bargaining in Washington. The talks, known as the Structural
Impediments Initiative, were devised by the administration last
July as a way to attack the underlying cultural reasons for
America's $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   For the first time, representatives of sovereign states set
about reviewing each other's economic failings and making
suggestions for changes.
   From the lengthy lists supplied, bot governments drafted a set
of commitments that they would be willing to make.
   The Japanese proposals, if implemented, would be much more
far-reaching in their impact than the U.S. proposals, which
essentially recycled past administrative initiatives, including the
Bush plan to cut the capital gains tax as a way of boosting
investment.
   But members of Congress said they remained to be convinced that
the Japanese were serious about making the changes needed to open
their markets to more foreign goods.
   ``Put me down as a skeptic who has seen too many (Japanese)
agreements in which the results didn't match the rhetoric,'' said
Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance
Committee.
   ``In any commercial agreement with Japan, seeing is believing,''
said Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   In its 22-page list of promises, the administration said it
would work to balance the federal budget, improve the U.S.
educational system and boost incentives for personal savings _ all
in the name of bolstering America's international competitiveness.
   Tokyo's 32-page list of promises, which turned out to be more
comprehensive than many critics had expected, pledged to alter the
closed-door policies Japanese businesses have long employed to keep
out foreign competition.
   Kaifu's government promised to:
   _Stiffen penalties for antitrust violations by Japanese
companies, including higher jail terms for bid-rigging and other
collusive practices which hamper the ability of foreign companies
to compete in Japan's market.
   _Reregulate Japan's complex distribution system, which makes it
difficult for foreigners to get products into the country. As part
of that process, the government promised to step up spending for
construction and expansion of airports and harbors where foreign
goods arrive.
   It also said it would shorten from as much as 10 years down to
1.5 years the time needed to get approval to open large retail
stores _ restrictions that have blocked American and other foreign
companies from setting up shop in Japanese markets.
   _Pass new legislation designed to alter tax laws in an effort to
expand the amount of land available for residential construction
and to boost government spending for housing and related areas such
as sewer systems.
   _Promote reducing the work week for Japanese government and
private-sector workers to 40 hours and five days and examine ways
to expand consumer credit.
   In many ways, the Japanese list of proposals sounds like a
blueprint for transforming a work-obsessed, thrifty country into a
nation more like America _ with more leisure time, expanded options
to buy consumer goods at lower prices and more access to charge
cards.
   Administration officials said that while Americans have
developed an inferiority complex over Japan's economic prowess,
they too often forget the high price Japanese consumers have had to
pay for their nation's trade superiority.
   ``It has resulted in a standard of living that the American
people wouldn't trade for,'' said Undersecretary of State Richard
McCormack, the head of the U.S. delegation. ``We live far better,
we have far better houses, we have far better access to products
that are much cheaper.''
   The agreement on reducing structural barriers was the latest in
a string of trade concessions the Japanese government has made
since Kaifu and Bush met in California in early March.
   In the past two weeks, negotiators have reached agreements to
expand markets for American-made telecommunications equipment,
satellites and supercomputers.
   The flurry of agreements was seen by some as a last-minute
effort by the Japanese to avoid being targeted again this year as
unfair traders. That designation means the administration could
retaliate by doubling the tariffs on selected Japanese goods sold
in the United States.
   The administration must decide by April 30 on its new
unfair-trade list.

   Congressional staffers say they are getting
several letters a day supporting calls for a federal probe of the
firing of a securities analyst who questioned the prospects for a
Donald Trump casino.
   ``We are getting a fair amount of mail, about five to 10 letters
a day,'' said Dennis Fitzgibbons, an aide to Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Fitzgibbons said Thursday that the mail was from executives and
citizens ``from around the country'' applauding Dingell's call for
a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of the firing of
gaming industry analyst Marvin Roffman.
   Roffman was fired by his firm, Philadelphia-based Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc., on March 23 after he made negative comments
published in the Wall Street Journal about the long-term prospects
for Trump's new Atlantic City, N.J., casino, the Taj Mahal.
   Trump threatened to sue the firm and Roffman was fired after he
rescinded his initial written apology to the real estate developer.
Janney Montgomery said it did not fire Roffman for his negative
analysis, but for violating firm policies about dealing with the
news media.
   Last week, Dingell wrote SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden asking
the agency, which Dingell's committee oversees, to look into firing.
   ``This scenario raises serious questions about the honesty and
integrity of Wall Street research as well as conflict of interest
problems between firms and analysts and their clients,'' Dingell's
letter said in part.
   Dingell also stated that ``if self-regulation cannot effectively
deal with these matters, we need to be looking at legislative
remedies.''
   Dingell also asked Janney President Norman T. Wilde Jr. to
provide the House panel ``with complete reports on this matter.''

<HEAD>Junk Defaults Rise, But Fitch Sees a New Market There</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM BUERKLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bad news keeps coming in the junk bond
market, but that isn't stopping new players from seeking a piece of
the action.
   Swelled by the bankruptcy woes of Campeau Corp.'s U.S. retailing
arms, the amount of corporate bonds defaulting in the first quarter
of this year quadrupled, the Bond Investors Association says.
   Thirteen companies defaulted on 38 bond issues totaling $5.69
billion in the period, compared with nine companies and $1.33
billion a year earlier, the Miami-based non-profit group reported.
The quarter's toll surpassed the total for all of 1988, when $4.97
billion in defaults were recorded.
   The burgeoning growth of defaults is the inevitable consequence
of the explosive growth of junk bond borrowings in the mid 1980s,
says C. Richard Lehmann, president of the association.
   ``We're getting that higher fallout because there's more debt
eligible for fallout,'' Lehmann says.
   Defaults tend to occur four or five years after bonds are issued
as borrowers' problems come home to roost, he says. Those problems
are plentiful, he adds, because credit quality deteriorated in the
'80s as companies replaced equity with junk debt via leveraged
buyouts and recapitalizations.
   Campeau is a prime example, having issued billions in junk bonds
to acquire Allied Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc.
   Those subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
January and accounted for $3.5 billion of the first quarter's
defaults. But even without Campeau, defaults rose 64 percent in the
period.
   Lehmann says he conservatively estimates defaults will hit a
record $15 billion this year, exceeding last year's $11.7 billion.
Over the next three years he forecasts a staggering $40 billion in
defaults.
   Those numbers may mean bad news for some investors, but they
spell opportunity for Fitch Investors Service Inc.
   The rating agency has been moving aggressively to compete with
its bigger rivals, Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's,
and it hopes to make a mark with a new service that evaluates
so-called distressed credits.
   ``We believe the market's ripe for it,'' says B. Daniel Evans,
chief operating officer at Fitch.
   In contrast to the traditional rating game, which ranks
borrowers according to their perceived ability to repay, Fitch's
recovery analysis aims to tell bondholders how much they are likely
to get back on investments in companies that are in bankruptcy or
facing severe distress.
   First, the service tries to determine the value of a borrower's
assets. Then it examines the covenants of the company's bond issues
to determine what leverage bondholders might have over management.
Simple stuff for a rating agency, but it gets more problematic.
   Next Fitch estimates how long it will take to work out the
company's problems and realize values for bondholders. Then it
tries to determine how proceeds will be allocated among individual
bond issues, and discounts those proceeds back to the present.
   With Federated, for example, Fitch estimates holders of the
retailer's senior classes of bonds can expect to receive 78 cents
on the dollar in about three years' time. Assuming that holds true,
an investor who pays 42 cents for the bonds now would get an
effective return of 25 percent a year.
   Fitch is selling its service to institutional investors as part
of a broad package of high-yield research for $10,000 a year. It
could be a fertile market, judging by the growing number of
investors poking around the wreckage of the junk market, Evans says.
   Oppenheimer High Yield Fund, for example, now has 5 percent to 6
percent of its assets invested in distressed credits compared with
perhaps 2 percent six months ago, portfolio manager Ralph
Stellmacher says.
   ``We have gravitated toward that sector because that is where
we're finding the most values,'' he says.
   The boom in defaults has been good business for R.D. Smith &amp; Co.
The New York broker specializes in distressed credits and workout
situations, and its staff has grown to nearly 100 from only 30
three years ago, President Mike Singer says.
   It takes a lot of legal expertise to assess the value of a
bankrupt company's securities because ``there are no strict rules
as to how an estate gets allocated,'' Singer cautions. But for
those who can do the job, there's no end of work in sight.
   ``The supply of distressed securities still far outpaces the new
funds coming into the market,'' Singer says.

   A record 30-year sentence given to a former
savings and loan executive convicted of fraud won applause from
regulators, who said it showed authorities were dead serious about
cracking down on thrift fraud.
   The sentence for Woody F. Lemons, former chairman of Vernon
Savings &amp; Loan, was the stiffest ever given to a thrift executive
in a fraud case, regulators said. U.S. District Judge Robert B.
Maloney said it was well deserved.
   Lemons was ``a thief in every sense of the word,'' the judge
said.
   The sentence was praised by L. William Seidman, chairman of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Resolution Trust Corp.,
which is overseeing the thrift industry bailout.
   ``I think it says these kinds of crimes are very serious,''
Seidman said. ``They are very harmful to the people of the United
States and they are going to be punished severely.''
   Lemons was convicted in December on 13 charges _ including
misapplication of funds, conspiracy and bank fraud _ for soliciting
a $9,000 kickback from a loan broker in January 1986 and receiving
$212,000 from the broker in April 1986.
   Seidman had written Maloney urging him to ``send a message to
the banking and thrift community and to other who would commit such
egregious acts as did Mr. Lemons.''
   U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburg called the sentence ``fair
and just punishment for one whose criminal misconduct resulted in a
multimillion dollar fraud in the Texas savings and loan industry.''
   Vernon S&amp;L was shut down in 1987 as part of a then-record $1.3
billion federal bailout, and has been cited as an example of some
of the worst abuses in the savings and loan industry. Six other
Vernon officials, a consultant and two borrowers have been
convicted or pleaded guilty to various crimes.
   When regulators seized Vernon, they found it owned 17th century
castle doors and expensive art objects, including a Baccarat eagle
and a silver-studded saddle. The thrift also owned a yacht in
Washington, D.C.
   Prosecutors said Lemon spent some of his money on a West Coast
home and on travel.
   Maloney levied no fine against Lemons, but he still faces an
April 19 hearing on restitution. The government is seeking as much
as $18 million in repayment.
   The judge said he had received more than 100 letters on Lemons'
behalf praising his church and community activities, but he wasn't
persuaded.
   ``Your friends are wrong,'' Maloney said. ``You are not a
religious man. ... Even though you are present (in church), you are
not listening.''
   ``You have no real moral values,'' the judge said. ``If you had
the opportunity, you would (steal) again. You are a thief in every
sense of the word.''
   Elated government attorneys would say little about the sentence,
but were heard shouting ``hot dog'' as they disappeared into their
offices.
   ``They hit a home run,'' said defense attorney Michael Gibson,
who promised to appeal the sentence.
   Gibson accused the government of having ``another agenda'' in
prosecuting Lemons.
   ``He's going to be the trophy that the federal agencies bag,''
Gibson told Maloney. Later the attorney predicted, ``You will see
Mr. Lemons and the sentence used to enhance (the agencies')
position'' in Congress.
   The sentencing of Lemons sets the stage for an expected
indictment of another former Vernon chairman, Don R. Dixon, who is
painted by government officials as the main culprit behind the
abuses at the thrift.
   Dixon has been notified he is the target of a federal
investigation, according to his attorney. He also is the lead
defendant in a $540 million federal fraud lawsuit filed in 1987.
   Gibson would not say if prosecutors had sought Lemons'
cooperation against Dixon, but Dixon's attorney, William M.
Ravkind, said, ``Anybody facing 30 years would turn in their
mother.''
   Five other Vernon officials and two Vernon borrowers and a
consultant also have pleaded guilty in thrift-connected cases. In
addition, former President Patrick G. King was convicted of fraud
and sentenced by Maloney to five years in jail and fined $55,000.

   The stock market drifted lower today, drawing
little inspiration from the latest status report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.68 to 2,711.49
by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 491 up, 806 down and
533 unchanged.
   The Labor Department issued its monthly report on employment,
showing a drop in the civilian unemployment rate to 5.2 percent in
March from 5.3 percent in February.
   In a separate statistical measure that commands especially close
attention among stock and bond traders, the department said nonfarm
payroll employment increased by 26,000 last month _ well below
advance estimates and the smallest gain in more than 3{ years.
   That latter figure prompted a brief rise in Treasury bond
prices. But those gains quickly dissipated as the morning passed.
   And if stock investors were at all encouraged about prospects
for lower interest rates, brokers said the data also raised
questions about whether the corporate earnings outlook would
improve any time soon.
   Banks and other financial issues were notably weak for the
second straight day. Bank of New York dropped 1} to 29{;
Bankamerica ~ to 25{; Federal National Mortgage 1 to 33|, and J.P.
Morgan 1 to 34.

   Tandem Computers was actively traded, unchanged at 22|. The
stock tumbled 4} points Thursday, when the company said revenues
for the fiscal quarter that ended last weekend fell short of its

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.69 to 186.46. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .80 at 360.43.

   Prices fell sharply on London's Stock Exchange
Friday, on nervousness before this weekend's Group of Seven meeting
in Paris.
   Traders also said concern about British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's unpopularity upset the market.
   In a Gallup poll published Friday, the Labor Party had support
of 52.5 percent support of those polled. It now holds a record
24.5-point lead over the Conservative Party.
   A late afternoon tumble in the pound also undermined the market,
dealers said.
   Market watchers said the G-7 meeting was not expected to focus
on the pound, so there were perceptions that sterling would be
neglected afterward.
   The G-7 countries are the United States, West Germany, Japan,
France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
was down 18.4 points, or 0.8 percent, at 2,221.1, just a shade
better than its 2,221.0 minimum. The index hit an early morning
peak of 2,243.2 and proceeded to move lower throughout the rest of
the session.
   Volume amounted to a moderately active 578.6 million shares,
compared with 499.5 million shares Thursday.

   UAL Corp. directors announced today they have
agreed to sell the parent of United Airlines to its employees for
$201 a share, or $4.38 billion.
   The move heads off a threatened proxy fight with the company's
largest shareholder but puts UAL back in a familiar position _
floating a deal with uncertain financing.
   Under the agreement, employees will exchange $155 in cash, $35
in UAL notes and an estimated $11 worth of securities in UAL
subsidiary Covia Corp. for each UAL share.
   There was no immediate word on how the deal was to be financed.
But a source close to the negotiations told The Associated Press
the parties had no firm financing for the deal.
   UAL, parent of United Airlines, said it expects to conclude a
final agreement promptly with United Employee Acquisition Corp., a
new company organized by United's pilots, flight attendants and
Machinists.
   At a news conference today in New York, representatives of the
unions said the agreement calls for employees to give up $2 billion
in concessions over five years, including $300 million in the first
year and $500 million in the fifth year.
   The breakdown of ownership in the new company would be as
follows: pilots owning about 37.9 percent; Machinists owning about
35.7 percent, non-union employees about 14.3 percent and flight
attendants about 12 percent, the unions said.
   Machinists' union Vice President John Peterpaul predicted banks
would look favorably on the deal.
   ``We're very optimistic about the financing,'' he said.
   UAL's largest shareholder, Coniston Partners, immediately called
off its threatened proxy fight to oust the company's board at the
April 26 annual shareholder meeting. Coniston holds an 11.8 percent
stake.
   ``We think it's a fair deal,'' said Coniston general partner
Paul Tierney, adding that employees and stockholders alike will
gain from the agreement.
   The announcement met with a lukewarm reaction, however, from
some analysts, who questioned how the deal would be financed and
whether banks would be willing to back the bid without a strong
management group behind it.
   The fate of UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf has been in doubt because
of union indications made before today that they would dump Wolf in
the event of an employee buyout.
   Pilots union head Frederick Dubinsky said in New York today that
Wolf would be replaced.
   ``It's our intention to put together a top-notch senior
management team ... and that will include a new (chief executive
officer),'' he said.
   ``There's not a financed bid, and there's a lot of skepticism,''
said Edward Starkman, an airline analyst for PaineWebber Inc. in
New York.
   UAL's stock opened up $3.50 a share at $169 on the New York
Stock Exchange but by midday had slid back to $165.50, unchanged
from Thursday.
   The agreement marks another chapter in a takeover saga that
began in August when Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis made a $5.4
billion offer for the company. Davis said earlier this week he
would not make another bid.
   But his initial offer sent United's pilots and management
scrambling to come up with their own bid. In September, UAL
directors accepted a $6.75 billion offer from the pilots,
management and British Airways PLC that also included labor and
wage concessions.
   The proposal was killed after the would-be purchasers were
unable to line up enough financing. Failure of that deal
contributed to a 190-point plunge in the Dow Jones industrial
average on Oct. 13 and was seen as the end of the takeover boom of
the 1980s.
   The stakes were raised again in November when Coniston announced
it had amassed a large block of UAL stock and wanted to reduce the
number of directors on the company's board.
   After UAL directors told financial advisers to consider a
recapitalization plan in January, United's three labor unions
proposed buying 75 percent of the stock.
   That proposal resulted in a $185-a-share, $3.8 billion buyout
offer from the unions that the UAL board rejected two weeks ago.
The bid was reportedly opposed strongly by UAL Chairman Stephen
Wolf.
   Earlier this week, the board met at least twice by telephone,
presumably on the buyout scenario.
   United is the nation's largest carrier behind American Airlines.

<HEAD>Miller Expands Production of New Non-Alcohol Brand</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miller Brewing Co. said Friday that the company
has expanded production of Sharp's, its new non-alcoholic brew,
because demand in some areas has left it short of supply.
   Milwaukee-based Miller introduced the alcohol-free beer in
December, producing it at its breweries in Albany, Ga., and Eden.
N.C.
   But first-quarter sales in 1990 were so strong, Miller is
expanding production to a third brewery in Fulton, N.Y., said Tony
Sciolla, new products manager. The company declined to release the
exact sales figures.
   ``We didn't expect it to do as well as it has,'' Miller
spokesman Ron Richards said. ``We hope the expansion that we've
done will solve the spot shortages.''
   The immediate success of Sharp's did not surprise some beer
industry analysts, who predicted it could soon bump G. Heileman
Brewing Co.'s Kingsberry label as the top selling non-alcoholic
beer.
   Frank Walters, vice president of research for Impact, a
bimonthly newsletter for the alcoholic beverage industry, said he
expects growth in the non-alcoholic segment of the market to
continue.
   In 1989, sales of non-alcoholic drinks was up 14 percent, he
said. It was one of the faster-growing segments of the beverage
market, behind imported vodkas, up 24 percent and California
varietal wines, up 16 percent.
   Walters said he expects sales of Sharp's and O'Doul's, the
non-alcoholic brand Anhueser-Busch introduced this year, to grow
fastest and ``put a lot of pressure'' on La Crosse, Wis.-based
Heileman's Kingsberry brand.
   ``I think they'll do very well because of the clout that both
companies have,'' he said.
   Richards said the ``overwhelming consumer response'' to Sharp's
was due in part to a brewing process that allows Miller to brew at
lower temperatures, minimizing alcohol production.
   The process produces a non-alcohol beer that tastes the same as
regular beer, he said.
   Most other brewers that have non-alcohol or low-alcohol beer
first brew regular beer and then remove the alcohol _ along with
the real beer flavor, he said.
   Richards also cited a trend toward drinking moderation. He said
the product was selling best in the Northeast, the Midwest and the
West.
   The trend toward tougher enforcement of drunken driving laws is
also a factor, Walters added.
   ``Police aren't playing around,'' he said. ``I would suspect
that on-premise is a big share of the business. Someone who wants
to go out and visit a bar _ they can have two or three and not have
any problems.''

<HEAD>Mesa Pulls Hugoton Holdings Off Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mesa Limited Partnership on Friday pulled its
Hugoton Royalty Trust holdings off the market, saying prices were
too low to sell the prime properties in the nation's largest
natural gas field.
   Mesa, T. Boone Pickens Jr.'s energy company, said in December it
would package its Hugoton holdings into a separate trust and sell
shares to raise money to help pay down some of the partnership's
$1.5 billion in long-term debt, much of it left over from the $715
million purchase of natural gas properties from Tenneco Inc. in
1988.
   ``At the right price, the Hugoton offering made sense for Mesa
unitholders,'' Pickens said. ``We're simply not going to sell a
portion of our premier properties at an inferior price.''
   The decision was based on ``unusual delays experienced in
bringing the transaction to market and pricing indications which
did not ... reflect the value of (Mesa's) Hugoton reserves,'' the
company said.
   W. Mark Womble, Mesa's vice president of finance, said the
partnership had hoped to raise about $400 million through the sale,
but indications were the offering would only bring in about $320
million.
   Plans were to sell about 16 million units at about $25 per unit;
Womble said indications were the units would bring no more than $20
each.
   ``It's just not something we had to do,'' Womble said. ``We're
not to the point that we have to sell anything to pay debt.''
   Mesa had about $350 million in cash investments at the end of
1989, Womble said, adding that the properties may never be sold.
   ``We have not said that we would ever come back to the market
with this particular deal,'' he said.
   ``The field has been producing a long time, and will produce a
long time into the future and it's not going anywhere,'' he said by
telephone from Mesa's offices in Amarillo.
   Between 12 percent and 15 percent of Mesa's natural gas holdings
are in the Hugoton field in Kansas, Womble said.

<TEXT>
   Financial market turmoil stemming from the Japanese
yen's sharp decline provided the backdrop for key talks by U.S.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and the economics chiefs of other
major industrial nations who gathered Friday.
   The ministers from the so-called Group of Seven nations, holding
their first formal discussions of 1990, also were expected on
Saturday to examine West Germany's plans to forge a monetary union
with East Germany as well as the political upheavals in other East
European countries.
   In advance of the meeting at the French Finance Ministry,
analysts were doubtful the Group of Seven _ Britain, Canada,
France, West Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States _ would
change course dramatically.
   The nations generally work together to achieve broad economic
goals, often through currency exchange rates, and rely at times on
coordinated market intervention as a tool.
   ``I don't expect any major policy conclusions,'' said David
Wyss, chief financial economist at the consulting firm of
DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass.
   French Finance Minister Pierre Beregovoy and his German
counterpart, Theo Waigel, held bilateral talks Friday but said
their discussions did not extend to the international financial
scene.
   The Japanese, worried about the weakness of their currency
against the dollar over recent months, were expected to appeal to
their economic partners for help in boosting the yen's value.
   The yen's slump has rattled the Tokyo stock market because of
speculation about its negative implications for the Japanese
economy, and stocks have tumbled by more than 25 percent so far in
1990.
   Earlier in the week, the dollar skyrocketed to a three-year high
of more than 160 yen before retreating a bit. The yen closed at
about 157.5 yen to the dollar Friday in Tokyo, reflecting
uncertainty in the currency markets about the outcome of the Group
of Seven meeting.
   A stronger dollar also is worrisome for the United States
because it threatens to aggravate the already large American trade
deficit with Japan. It makes Japanese imports less expensive for
U.S. consumers and American goods costlier for foreign buyers.
   Many analysts predicted the United States would be wary of
promising to do much to prop up the yen. Some said American
officials may agree to intervene more in the currency markets by
selling dollars to try to strengthen the Japanese currency.
   The Japanese would like to see the Americans lower their
interest rates, which would in turn help lift the yen. But the U.S.
Federal Reserve has been hesitant to knock down those rates for
fear of igniting domestic inflationary pressures at home.
   While the financial markets were most interested in the outcome
of the yen talks, the officials could spend more time considering
the events unfolding in East Germany and its East-bloc neighbors.
   It will be the first time the finance ministers and the central
bank presidents have met since the political shakeups in the East
at the end of last year.
   Waigel and Karl Otto Poehl, the president of the West German
Bundesbank, the central bank, were expected to give details on
their plans for creating an economic and monetary union this summer
with East Germany.
   The Bonn government has become embroiled in a controversy over
the conversion rate for exchange of the East German currency to the
West German mark.
   The Bundesbank has recommended a rate of one West German mark
for each East German mark, with a higher rate for small savings
accounts.
   East Germans have complained that the proposed rate would
effectively cut in half their wages, pensions and other savings.
   No final decision has been announced on the conversion rate.
   The finance chiefs' agenda also included plans for the new
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, designed to
funnel aid into Eastern Europe, and proposals for increased lending
by the International Monetary Fund to poor nations.

   Grain and soybean futures closed lower Friday on
the Chicago Board of Trade as profit-taking set in following a
strong opening on rumors of a major grain purchase by the Soviet
Union.
   The rumors of a Soviet grain purchase were never confirmed
during the day and traders took the opportunity to cash in on the
surge in the market.
   ``Corn and wheat had been rallying for past two weeks on
expectations of a major purchase by the Soviets,'' said Joel
Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago. ``But
they sold off with no word of a purchase.''
   Wheat prices was getting support from expectations of a weekend
freeze in winter wheat crop areas. However, that concern was eased
as forecasts indicated the drop in temperatures would not be so
severe.
   Slack export demand for soybeans also weighed on futures.
However, concern over the availability of soybeans and soymeal out
of Brazil provided some support to prices, Karlin said.
   At the close; wheat was 2{ cents to 4} cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $3.65\ a bushel; corn was } cent to

   Importer Ronald V. Davis has adopted the market
revival of Perrier sparkling water as a personal mission.
   ``I feel like my family has been attacked,'' said the
43-year-old father of two teen-agers in describing his emotional
reaction to the worst problem he's faced in two decades in the
beverage business.
   Davis, president and chief executive of Perrier Group of America
Inc. in Greenwich, Conn., felt a misstep in handling Perrier's
contamination crisis could damage the French brand's image for
decades.
   But he relied on instinct and the advice of longtime colleagues
in ordering the recall Feb. 9 of every Perrier bottle in the United
States. The government had alerted the company that several bottles
of Perrier in North Carolina were found to have trace amounts of
benzene, a dangerous chemical.
   ``You can't be trained for an event like this,'' he said.
   When specially marked Perrier is returned to American stores,
bars and restaurants in a few weeks, Davis hopes customers will
respond by restoring Perrier to its former stature as the nation's
best-selling imported water.
   ``The big red flag that seemed about to go up and wave and kill
the cachet of the brand never went up, and Davis is responsible for
that,'' said Tom Pirko, president of the beverage consultant
BevMark Inc. of Los Angeles.
   Pirko initially expected Perrier's share of the $2.2 billion
U.S. bottled water market would drop 10 to 15 percent in the
aftermath of the contamination and recall. But he says now ``the
damage is going to be very minor'' and pent-up demand could make
the brand stronger than ever.
   Critics said Davis was not quick enough in explaining to
consumers directly through advertising rather than through news
media briefings how the Perrier bottles became contaminated. A
half-dozen lawsuits have been filed against the company alleging
that the product has been misrepresented as pure.
   Davis said the company acted responsibly in reaction to the
crisis and that the lawsuits are groundless. He said he ordered the
recall voluntarily after independent laboratory analyses indicated
the contamination was not confined to a single batch of Perrier or
a single part of the country.
   Source Perrier SA, the French bottler which owns 53 percent of
privately held Perrier Group, initially blamed a worker's improper
use of a cleaning solvent containing benzene for the contamination.
   But the contamination was later traced to the gas reservoir that
lies beneath the spring from which Perrier is drawn in Vergezes.
While the water was pure, Source Perrier discovered benzene occurs
in small amounts in the gas and a filter failed to screen it out
before bottling.
   The company said it took steps to monitor and replace filters
more often so the contamination will not happen again.
   In a recent interview, Davis was unable to cite anything in his
professional career that includes nearly 10 years in General Foods'
beverage division that compared with the stresses of the
contamination incident.
   Davis lives with his wife, son and daughter in Greenwich, an
affluent New York suburb. He was born Jan. 26, 1947 and grew up
near Los Angeles where a dispenser of Arrowhead bottled water _ now
one of Perrier Group's brands _ was a fixture in his house.
   After college, Davis joined General Foods and worked on the
Country Time lemonade brand. He moved to Perrier Group in 1979,
intent on expanding its business which amounted to $20 million in
annual sales and one brand, Perrier.
   Davis became president and chief executive the next year, and
the company has grown to $640 million in annual sales and nine
brands.
   A marathon runner and an avid golfer who regularly shoots in the
70s, Davis is described as competitive. ``He hates to lose whether
we are playing gin rummy or are on the golf course even if its only
$1 at stake,'' said Louis A. Matagrano, head of a beverage
distributorship that has handled Perrier for 10 years in San Mateo
County south of San Francisco.
   Davis said he became aware of reports from North Carolina that a
private laboratory had discovered bottles of Perrier were
contaminated on Feb. 6. The company gets calls ``15 to 18 times a
year from someone saying they have found something'' that usually
prove groundless, he said.
   But over the next three days, both the federal government and
the company's independent tests disclosed trace amounts of benzene
in Perrier bottles selected randomly in various regions.
   Davis said he was assured the benzene levels posed no safety or
health hazard, and the government was not demanding any action. But
he said it was clear on Friday, Feb. 9, what should be done.
   After all, the product's ad theme was ``It's perfect. It's
Perrier.''
   Kim Jeffery, the former Pepsi-Cola Co. executive who is Davis'
top marketing ally, suggested the recall in a conference call that
Friday as he and Davis talked to Frederik Zimmer, managing director
of Source Perrier, in France.
   Davis said they instantly agreed. ``We could have sat there and
agonized but that didn't happen. It was like all three of us were
together,'' he said.
   He said expense was not an issue. Reclaiming the 70 million
bottles cost about $30 million alone. ``When a product's whole
reason for being is quality and purity, the costs of not doing what
we did would have been borne for the next 100 years,'' Davis said.
   The recall was announced Friday afternoon. Perrier's 178
distributors were told by telephone and fax they were not to load
the trucks on Monday.
   On Saturday, packages were sent to distributors by courier
telling them to collect all the bottles and outlining reimbursement
procedures. Davis held a news conference. A toll-free telephone
line for consumers was activated Sunday.
   On Monday, Davis went to France where it took three days to
pinpoint the cause. He talked by phone with James Burke, who guided
Johnson &amp; Johnson through two Tylenol poisonings in the 1980s.
Burke's advice: ``Be straight.''
   The next week, Perrier hired Burson-Marsteller, the
communications company they worked on the Tylenol case. By March 6,
the recall was virtually complete and Davis announced plans to
relaunch ther brand by summer.
   It ran a full-page ad in 22 major newspapers admitting a
``mistake'' that it said was ``identified and corrected.''
   BevMark's Pirko said Perrier evidently will not suffer from the
disclosure that benzene is present in the gas reservoir used to
make the water fizzy. ``The harpoon that could have stuck went
whizzing by,'' he said.
   Industry executives applaud Davis. ``I have enormous respect for
what he did considering what little he knew about it when he made
his decision,'' said Jack West, owner of Puro Corp., a water
company serving offices in metropolitan New York.

<DATELINE>EAST AURORA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fisher-Price on Friday announced that
20,000 of its child car seats made since Feb. 1 could break during
a crash and offered free repair kits so consumers can fix the
problem.
   A faulty die that weakened a metal part was discovered during
tests, said company spokeswoman Carol Blackley. The repair kit
includes a new part and tools with which to install it.
   The problem affects, at most, one-fifth of the child seats made
between Feb. 1 and April 1, Blackley said. She said consumers
should call Fisher-Price to inquire whether their seat is one of
the defective ones and to order a repair kit if so.
   Seats should not be returned to the store, Blackley said.
   The seat can be used before the repair kit arrives if it is used
in the ``rear-facing position,'' for infants weighing less than 20
pounds, but should not be used for larger children until it is
fixed, she said.
   Blackley refused to say how much the repair kits would cost
Fisher-Price, but said it would have a minimal financial effect on
the company.
   Last year, Fisher-Price sent out repair kits for 1.5 million of
the child safety seats because they did not meet federal
flammability standards.

   Stock prices sagged today, drawing little
inspiration from the latest status report on employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 9.23 to 2,711.94
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 524 up, 923 down and
504 unchanged.
   The Labor Department issued its monthly report on employment,
showing a drop in the civilian unemployment rate to 5.2 percent in
March from 5.3 percent in February.
   In a separate statistical measure that commands especially close
attention among stock and bond traders, the department said nonfarm
payroll employment increased by 26,000 last month _ well below
advance estimates and the smallest gain in more than 3{ years.
   That latter figure prompted a brief rise in Treasury bond
prices. But those gains quickly dissipated as the morning passed.
   And if stock investors were at all encouraged about prospects
for lower interest rates, brokers said the data also raised
questions about whether the corporate earnings outlook would
improve any time soon.
   Banks and other financial issues were notably weak for the
second straight day. Bank of New York dropped 1\ to 30; Bankamerica
| to 25}; Federal National Mortgage 2 to 32|, and J.P. Morgan } to
34\.
   Losers among the blue chips included Aluminum Co. of America,
down 1| at 61}; Hewlett-Packard, down } at 44&lsqb;; USX, down | at 35},
and International Business Machines, down \ at 105~.
   Tandem Computers was actively traded, unchanged at 22|. The
stock tumbled 4} points Thursday, when the company said revenues
for the fiscal quarter that ended last weekend fell short of its
target.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.63 to 186.52. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .66 at 360.57.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 113.83 million shares with an

<TEXT>
   Champion Spark Plug Co. said Friday it would
consolidate its U.S. operations by closing two plants because of
less demand for spark plugs.
   The move will affect 675 salaried and hourly workers _ 245 in
Detroit and 430 in Toledo.
   The two plants will be phased out over the next two years.
Production will be integrated into the company's Burlington, Iowa,
and Cambridge, Ohio, operations. Champion employs 10,000 people
worldwide.
   ``Judging from the factors that exist today, it's not only
inevitable, it's the right thing to do,'' William Basedow, director
of employee relations, said at a news conference.
   Company officials and representatives of the United Auto Workers
union are to meet regarding how the timing of the consolidation
will affect production and maintenance employees.
   Company officials said new jobs in Burlington and Cambridge
would be created.
   ``Champion has been struggling for several years with an
overcapacity of production facilities, while at the same time
selling a product _ spark plugs _ whose overall market has
declined,'' said Jerry Godwin, Champion president.
   Champion plants in Toledo produce spark plug shells and assemble
the final spark plugs. The Detroit plant manufactures ceramic
insulation used in the plug.
   Champion is a division of Houston-based Cooper Industries Inc.,
which bought the company last year for $707 million.
   Basedow said Champion's plans have nothing to do with the sale,
saying the company had to streamline to remain competitive.
   ``The prior management had a similar study and came to much the
same conclusions that we have. ... Had these factors been in place
in 1988, 1989, they would have done the same thing,'' he said.
   Basedow said the declining spark plug market was caused by a
reduction in the number of cylinders in automobiles because of
smaller engines; improvements in the ignition systems on most
vehicles and in the spark plugs themselves, resulting in longer
life; and unleaded fuel, which does not damage spark plugs as does
leaded fuel.
   Foreign spark plugs entering the country as original equipment
in imported cars also contributed to falling demand.

   Ford of Canada announced Friday it

resulting in 2,200 layoffs.
   Spokesman Jim Hartford said inventories of the Ford Tempo and
Mercury Topaz which the plant builds had grown too high. About 80
percent of the plant's cars are shipped to the United States.
   It is the second time the Oakville plant has shut down this year

   In the United States this week, Ford extended until Thursday the
shutdown of its Dearborn, Mich., assembly plant, which stopped
producing the Mustang April 9 because of slow dealer orders.

   The price tag on the savings and loan bailout
could hit a mind-boggling $500 billion if the economy falters,
congressional auditors said Friday in their bleakest assessment of
the thrift crisis yet.
   The General Accounting Office said it would cost the government
at least $325 billion to close or sell failed savings institutions.
That's greater than the Pentagon's annual budget.
   But even the new projection, a sharp 26 percent higher than the
$257 billion estimate offered by the GAO only five months ago, is
optimistic, said Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, who heads
the GAO.
   ``It could easily become a $400 billion problem and it might
even hit as high as $500 billion, or half a trillion dollars, if
you get the economy working against you,'' Bowsher told the Senate
Banking Committee.
   His testimony at a sparsely attended hearing challenged the Bush
administration's contention that regulators have enough money for
now and a reassessment can wait until after this year's
congressional elections.
   Bowsher called on Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman, who is
administering the bailout, to ``develop proposals to provide the
additional funds.''
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., the committee chairman, said
he would ask the administration to respond at a hearing next month.
   This ``devastating statement'' from the GAO ``should be a call
to arms for all people involved, from the administration, to
Congress to the industry,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.
   In past appearances before congressional committees, Seidman has
conceded that last year's bailout probably is underfunded. The
administration, however, has suggested it could get by through
early appropriation of about $30 billion intended for S&amp;L failures
after 1992.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the White House Council of Economic
Advisers, declined to comment on the report but promised, ``We'll
analyze it in detail.''
   The GAO's new estimate includes interest payments spread over 40
years, but the bulk of the $325 billion will be needed during the
1990s. Taxpayers will have to pick up most of the $68 billion
increase, Bowsher said. That likely would push their share of the
total above $200 billion, with the S&amp;L industry paying the rest.
   ``We are looking here at a huge, huge number as far as what the
American taxpayer is going to have to pay,'' he said.
   The administration had planned to spend $50 billion to cover
losses in S&amp;Ls that fail through 1992, but Bowsher said it would
need at least $13 billion more.
   The GAO chief said the government also will have to spend $5
billion more than anticipated on interest to borrow the $50
billion; $10 billion more for administrative expenses at the
bailout agency, the Resolution Trust Corp.; and $28 billion more
for interest on money the RTC is borrowing temporarily until it can
sell the assets from failed thrifts.
   Additionally, Bowsher said, the government will need $12 billion
more than earlier projections to meet its obligations through 1999
under the more than 200 S&amp;L rescue deals concluded in 1988. That
will cost $68 billion rather than $56 billion, he said.
   Bowsher blamed the overall shortfall in part on the government's
slow start in closing and selling failed S&amp;Ls. Over the past 14
months, regulators have seized 403 institutions but disposed of
only 52.
   Still-open failed S&amp;Ls under government control or targeted for
takeover are losing $29 million a day on their operations.
   ``It is imperative that RTC begin to quickly resolve troubled
institutions to minimize the ultimate costs,'' Bowsher said.
   Seidman, who also serves as chairman of the RTC, has announced
plans to sharply accelerate the bailout pace, closing or rescuing
140 institutions by the end of June.
   Riegle, Graham and Pressler were the only senators on the
21-member committee who showed up to hear the bad news. Many of the
others had already left Washington to start the Easter recess in
their home states.
   On another matter, GAO officials said it was too soon to say if
the insurance fund backing commercial bank deposits was in trouble.
   But, Robert Gramling, GAO director of accounting and financial
management, said auditors were very concerned about banks
struggling with a real estate slowdown in the Northeast.
   ``I don't see the (FDIC) fund in a growth pattern,'' he said. A
GAO audit of the fund, which has lost money in the last two years,
will be issued in June.

   A federal jury on Friday convicted two Wall
Street arbitragers on insider trading, fraud and other and counts
linked to the so-called ``Yuppie Five'' scandal, capping a 12-week
trial.
   Victor Teicher and Ross Frankel both plan to appeal, a defense
attorney said.
   Teicher, 38, who headed the arbitrage firm Teicher &amp; Co., faces
a maximum 60-year prison term and fines that could total $3
million. Teicher's firm faces a $500,000 fine, according to
assistant U.S. attorney Carl H. Loewenson.
   Frankel, 33, former head of arbitrage research at now-defunct
investment house Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. He could receive as
much as 30 years in jail and a $1.5 million fine.
   The verdict ends five days of jury deliberations over a case
stemming from the ``Yuppie Five'' insider trading case. Four young
Wall Street professionals and a client pleaded guilty in 1986 to
making illegal stock trades based on inside information about
corporate takeovers that they had obtained through their jobs.
   Teicher and Frankel were convicted of trading the stocks of
eight corporations based on stolen information. Loewenson said he
did not have a figure for the total profits reaped from their
trades.
   Attorney Robert Morvillo, whose firm represented the pair, said
Teicher and Frankel would appeal after sentencing.
   ``We're disappointed,'' Morvillo said. Teicher and Frankel
admitted to trading the stocks of the eight companies in question,
but Morvillo said ``they did not trade based on receipt of
non-public information.''
   U.S. District Judge Charles Haight scheduled Frankel's
sentencing for June 18 and Teicher's for June 19.
   Testifying for the prosecution were two key government witnesses
who pled guilty to insider trading charges in 1986. Michael David
worked as an attorney in the corporate department of the top New
York law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison, where he
gathered information on clients and passed it along to the
defendants.
   Also testifying against the pair was Robert Salsbury, who worked
with Frankel in Drexel's arbitrage department.
   Teicher and Frankel were accused of executing illegal trades
between July 1985 and March 1986 in the stocks of American Brands
Inc., Allegheny International Inc., Avondale Mills, American Can
Corp., Revco, Westchester Financial Services Corp., Republic
Airlines Inc. and Warnaco Inc.
   Teicher and Frankel were indicted in 1988 along with the trading
firm Marcus Schloss &amp; Co. and D. Ronald Yagoda, who headed its
arbitrage department.
   Last July, Schloss became the first specialist firm on the New
York Stock Exchange to be found guilty of conspiracy and securities
fraud. But the jury acquitted Yagoda of all nine charges against
him.
   Teicher and Frankel have maintained their innocence since their
indictment.
   The jury convicted Teicher of nine counts of securities fraud,
two mail fraud charges and one count of conspiracy. Frankel was
convicted of one securities fraud count, one conspiracy count, one
mail fraud count, one count of perjury and two counts of
obstruction of justice.
   Loewenson had no comment on the verdicts.

   The widow of a businessman who killed himself
so his insurance money could finance a battle with the Internal
Revenue Service pleaded with Congress Friday to ``control the IRS,
to keep it from destroying people's lives.''
   ``This kind of thing should never have happened to me and
Alex,'' Kay M. Council of High Point, N.C., told the Senate Finance
oversight subcommittee. ``We didn't do anything wrong. We just got
caught up in the middle of a big IRS screw-up and we couldn't get
out of it.''
   IRS Commissioner Fred T. Goldberg Jr., who preceded Mrs. Council
on the witness stand, was not asked about her case but said his
agency in general is making a great deal of progress implementing
the 1988 law known as the ``Taxpayer Bill of Rights.''
   ``Citizens of this country have more rights today in proceeding
against the IRS'' than against any other agency ``and I think that
is good,'' Goldberg said. He said employees have been put on notice
that ``we need to be attentive to attitudes.''
   Nine years after the Councils got into trouble with the IRS by
writing off a $70,000 tax-shelter loss, Mrs. Council returned home
one night in June 1988 to find a note from her husband:
   ``My dearest Kay _ I have taken my life in order to provide
capital for you. The IRS and its liens which have been taken
against our property illegally by a runaway agency of our
government have dried up all sources of credit for us. So I have
made the only decision I can. It's purely a business decision ....
You will find my body on the lot on the north side of the house.''
   Mrs. Council, 48, eventually won a federal court ruling that she
and her husband owed the IRS nothing, not the $300,000 in taxes,
interest and penalties the IRS claimed.
   The court held the IRS deficiency notice was sent four months
after the statute of limitations had expired.
   The IRS apparently had misaddressed an earlier notice. By the
time the dispute was decided by the courts, Mrs. Council had sold
her home and paid $70,000 in legal fees, her credit rating was
ruined and, as she put it, ``I was cheated of growing old with the
man I love.''
   She said the poor have little chance of fighting the bureaucracy.
   ``I don't think I would have ever gotten into a courtroom if my
attorneys hadn't known that I had $250,000 from Alex's life
insurance,'' she said.
   Mrs. Council's story highlighted a hearing on how the IRS has
responded to the 1988 law aimed at protecting rights of citizens
involved in disputes with the tax agency.
   She has refused to waive her privacy rights, blocking the IRS
from commenting on any part of her tax history.
   IRS Commissioner Goldberg said the tax agency is doing well in
implementing the law that requires that taxpayers be notified of
their rights; requires the agency to give earlier notice before
imposing a lien on property, and demands that notices of additional
taxes owed spell out such claims in clear language.
   ``What the American public resents is complexity, uncertainty
... hassles with the IRS that take month after month after month to
resolve,'' Goldberg said.
   Goldberg adamantly denied that the IRS has a quota system for
rewarding employees on the basis of how much they collect. He
called reprehensible a ``snitch'' scheme reported to the
subcommittee in which the IRS supposedly would reduce the taxes of
any business that turned in competitors who were cheating.
   ``It shouldn't be happening,'' Goldberg said. ``If it is, we'd
like to know about it and will put a stop to it today.''
   David Keating, executive vice president of the National
Taxpayers Union, said that in the fight for taxpayer rights, ``much
progress has been made but more legal protections are necessary.''
   He said that even if the new law had been in effect for the
Councils to use, it probably would not have helped. The provision
allows a taxpayer to sue for damages if the IRS has recklessly or
intentionally disregarded any tax law. But Congress dropped from
the original draft similar recourse in case of careless action by
the IRS.
   Reckless and intentional treatment ``is a very difficult
standard to prove,'' he said.
   Mrs. Council said she had thought that beating the IRS in court
``would give some meaning to Alex's death, but it hasn't. ... There
has to be something done to control the IRS, to keep it from
destroying people's lives.''

<HEAD>Copper Surge As Peru Strike Continues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures rallied sharply Friday on New York's Commodity
Exchange on concerns over the continued strike at mines in Peru and
declining supplies, but profit-taking trimmed prices near the close
of trading.
   On other markets, precious metals were higher, grain and
soybeans declined, livestock surged and pork prices declined, and
oil prices were mixed.
   Copper settled 1.60 cents to 2.55 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in April at $1.245 a pound.
   Copper prices surged 420 points in early trading on the Comex
before gains were trimmed by half to settle 255 to 160 points
higher.
   Analyst Jim Steel of Refco Inc. in New York said the rally
stemmed from short covering _ the buying of contracts to fulfill
obligations made by selling borrowed contracts earlier _ by traders
following Thursday's selloff. He said the selloff was prompted by
reports the strike was over, but the fresh indications that the
mines were still shut alarmed the market.
   However, Steel said, belief the strike was winding down caused
prices to retreat near the close of trading.
   Steel said the price surge also was helped by feelings that
copper stocks in London Metal Exchange warehouses had declined.
   Precious metals futures rose in trading on the Comex.
   Gold prices surged following the release of employment figures
by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics that showed a minor increase
in the number of jobs created and a decline of jobs in the
manufacturing sector.
   Steel called the employment figures disappointing and said they
could result in lower interest rates and weakening of the dollar,
which he says would be good for gold.
   Gold was $5.90 higher with April at $380.75 a troy ounce; silver
was 2.1 cents to 2.1 cents higher with May at $5.19 a troy ounce.
   Grain and soybean futures closed lower on the Chicago Board of
Trade as profit-taking set in following a strong opening on rumors
of a major grain purchase by the Soviet Union.
   The rumors of a Soviet grain purchase never were confirmed
during the day and traders took the opportunity to cash in on the
market's surge.
   After the close of trading, the U.S. Agriculture Department
reported the sale of 750,000 metric tons of corn to the USSR
   Wheat prices was getting support from expectations of a weekend
freeze in winter wheat crop areas. However, that concern was eased
as forecasts indicated the drop in temperatures would not be as
severe as previously expected.
   Slack export demand for soybeans also weighed on futures.
However, concern over the availability of soybeans and soymeal out
of Brazil provided some support to prices, said Joel Karlin, an
analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat was 2{ cents to 4} cents lower with May at $3.65\ a
bushel; corn was 1\ cents to 2\ cents lower with May at $2.69\ a
bushel; oats were } cent to 1\ cents lower with May at $1.51} a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3{ cents lower with May at $5.95{
cents a bushel.
   Livestock futures were higher and pork futures lower on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Profit taking weighed heavily on pork, following a price rally
during the week after a U.S. Agriculture Department report that hog
production would decline this week.
   Livestock prices rose in expectation of higher prices and
increased demand.
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .80 cent higher with April at 79.75
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .80 cent higher with
April at 83.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .35 cent lower to .20
cent higher with April at 54.50 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .70 cent to 1.10 cents lower with May at 54.47 cents a pound.
   Energy prices were mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
with crude oil prices pushed lower by high stocks.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 28 cents lower to 3 cents
higher with May at $19.15 a barrel; heating oil was .12 cents to 29
cents higher with May at 53.60 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .05 cent to 1.18 cents lower with May at 62.11 cents a gallon.

   Stock prices slipped in quiet trading Friday,
drawing little inspiration from the latest status report on
employment.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials lost 4.05 to 2,717.12,
reducing its gain for the week to 9.91 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
622 up, 860 down and 516 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 137.49 million
shares, down from 144.17 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 167.20 million shares.
   The Labor Department issued its monthly report on employment,
showing a drop in the civilian unemployment rate to 5.2 percent in
March from 5.3 percent in February.
   In a separate statistical measure that commands especially close
attention among stock and bond traders, the department said nonfarm
payroll employment increased by 26,000 last month _ well below
advance estimates and the smallest gain in more than 3{ years.
   That latter figure prompted a brief rise in Treasury bond
prices. But those gains quickly dissipated as the morning passed.
   And if stock investors were at all encouraged about prospects
for lower interest rates, brokers said the data also raised
questions about whether the corporate earnings outlook would
improve any time soon.
   Banks and other financial issues were notably weak for the
second straight day. Bank of New York dropped 1\ to 30; Bankamerica
~ to 25{; J.P. Morgan &rsqb; to 34|; Federal National Mortgage 2| to 32,
and Federal Home Loan Mortgage 3{ to 65\.
   Losers among the blue chips included Aluminum Co. of America,
down 1&rsqb; at 62; Hewlett-Packard, down 1&lsqb; at 43}; USX, down { at 35~;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down &lsqb; at 41|, and International
Business Machines, down \ at 105~.
   Browning-Ferris climbed 1{ to 36~. Followers of the company said
it appeared to have enhanced its earnings outlook with a decision
to sell its hazardous-waste disposal business.
   Tandem Computers was actively traded, unchanged at 22|. The
stock tumbled 4} points Thursday, when the company said revenues
for the fiscal quarter that ended last weekend fell short of its
target.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $7.83 billion, or 0.24
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .37 to 186.78.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.40 to 395.65, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.65 at 340.08.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 2.52 to 430.90. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 361.01, down .22.

   The dollar ended the week slightly lower in
subdued dealings Friday as traders moved to the sidelines ahead of
a weekend meeting of world finance ministers.
   Gold prices were sharply higher in the United States after
posting modest gains overseas. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $380.70 a troy
ounce, up $5.90 from late Thursday. Republic National Bank of New
York quoted a late bid for gold of $380.50 an ounce, up $5.50.
   Currency trading was uneventful. Dealers were reluctant to do
much ahead of the Group of Seven finance ministers' meeting in
Paris over the weekend.
   Officials from the United States, West Germany, Japan, France,
Britain, Italy and Canada will gather to discuss international
exchange rates.
   ``We've had last-minute position-squaring before the G-7''
meeting, said David Ogg, a vice president at Credit Suisse in New
York. Otherwise, ``volume was slower than it has been.''
   The dollar moved in a narrow range. The U.S. currency edged
lower in early domestic dealings following the goverment's release
of a smaller-than-expected increase in non-farm payrolls.
   The dollar then rose briefly on a rumor of a nuclear disaster in
the Soviet Union. The Soviets dismissed the talk as unfounded.
   The British pound fell on news that Conservative Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher's popularity continues to slide. A Gallup poll
published Friday showed that the Labor party had the support of 53
percent of those polled, leading the Conservative party by 25
points.
   In London, the pound dropped to $1.6385 from $1.6427 late
Thursday. But in New York, one pound cost $1.6425, slightly more
expensive than Thursday's $1.6420.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to 157.47 Japanese yen from 157.90 yen
at Thursday's close. Later in London, it slipped further to 157.45
yen. In New York, however, the dollar rose to 157.70 yen from
157.50 yen on Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.6942 West German marks, down from
1.6997; 1.5005 Swiss francs, down from 1.5015; 5.6985 French
francs, down from 5.7150; 1,245.25 Italian lire, down from
1,249.50, and 1.1648 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1683.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.6941 West German marks, down from 1.6997; 1.4992
Swiss francs, down from 1.5010; 5.6942 French francs, down from
5.7155; 1.9070 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9123; 1,245.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,250.50; and 1.1652 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1685.
   Gold prices rose in London to a late bid of $378 a troy ounce
from $377 late Thursday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal rose to
a closing bid of $378 from $376.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold
closed at a bid of $379.43, up $4.09 from Wednesday. The Hong Kong
market was closed Thursday for a holiday.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery finished at $5.164 a troy ounce, up from
Thursday's $5.141. But in London the metal fell to a late bid of
$5.13 a troy ounce from $5.18 late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   In 1977, a second-tier Wall Street firm named
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. issued $30 million in curious IOUs
called high-yield bonds to help finance the growth of an oil
company, Texas International Co.
   The deal marked the start of the Drexel era _ a corporate cattle
rush that raised billions of dollars for American businesses
through risky paper that earned the nickname ``junk.''
Investigators say Drexel's brash behavior also helped spawn
criminal dealings that sullied Wall Street in the 1980s.
   Thirteen years after the tiny junk-bond deal, Drexel is going
out of business. Texas International emerges from bankruptcy court
Monday after plunging to a disaster fueled by heavy debts and an
oil bust.
   The relationship between the giant New York investment house and
the Oklahoma City oil driller in many ways tells Drexel's story.
Drexel provided the means to grow, temporarily saved the company
when times soured and now is accused of ripping it off along the
way.
   A report in federal bankruptcy court alleges that Drexel sapped
Texas International by trading on inside information, secretly
``parking'' bonds with a scandalous thrift and charging $3 million
to create a tax shelter for its own holdings.
   The 53-page report by a lawyer for Texas International's
stockholders committee, unsealed following a request by The
Associated Press, portrays Drexel as hellbent to make as much money
as possible at its client's expense while serving as financial
adviser from 1985 to 1987.
   While Drexel legitimately raised capital for scores of companies
seeking to grow _ many of whom still sing Drexel's praises _ the
Texas International report supports a darker view of the investment
firm's legacy to the takeover-frenzied '80s.
   ``There will be the continuing perception that in the pursuit of
a brilliant idea Drexel went too far,'' said Samuel L. Hayes III,
an investment banking professor at Harvard Business School.
   ``They were street-smart people,'' he said. ``They smelled an
opportunity and moved very aggressively to exploit it. ... They may
have carried it to the nth degree, but that's certainly not out of
character for an investment bank.''
   Drexel last year admitted to running an illicit trading network
prosecutors say was directed by junk-bond innovator Michael Milken.
The firm pleaded guilty to six felonies and agreed to pay $650
million in fines and restitution. Milken, who says he's innocent,
has been indicted but no trial date is set.
   Drexel was accused of lawbreaking in about 20 deals. Texas
International was not one of them, and federal law enforcers
decline to say whether they even investigated it.
   The report unsealed by the bankruptcy court nevertheless alleges
a variety of improprieties and blames Drexel for making Texas
International's problems worse. Seeking to invalidate Drexel's $14
million claim as a creditor, the shareholders committee says Drexel
deliberately structured deals to fail so it could generate more
business.
   From 1978 to 1983, Drexel issued about $150 million in
high-yield bonds for Texas International, which used the money to
expand operations by drilling for deep natural gas in Texas and
Louisiana.
   In taking on the debt, which wasn't limited to financing by
Drexel, the company counted on rising oil prices, but they
collapsed in 1986. Texas International's stock fell from $27 to $1.
   On the brink of default, the company hired Drexel to restructure
its debt by lowering payments, delaying due dates and substituting
stock for some of its bonds.
   In three deals, Drexel refinanced $389 million of Texas
International debt. The investment firm pioneered so-called debt
exchange offers, and Texas International acknowledges the
arrangements staved off a bankruptcy filing.
   But only temporarily. Crushed by the burden, Texas International
in 1987 sold key oil fields in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahomafor
$120 million to make interest payments, laying off hundreds of
workers. Still failing, the company sought bankruptcy court
protection from creditors in April 1988.
   The shareholders report was written by Benjamin Waisbren, a
Milwaukee attorney, based on Drexel trading records and other
company documents a federal judge ordered Drexel to surrender.
   Waisbren filed the report last November but asked the court not
to make it public, apparently to try to pressure Drexel to drop its
claim as a creditor. Drexel, whose parent sought bankruptcy court
protection in February, did not contest unsealing the report, nor
has it dropped its claim against Texas International.
   The report says that because Drexel bought so much of the
company's stock and bonds, it blurred the line between paid adviser
and interested party.
   The committee alleges possibly illegal ``parking'' with Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of California, a collapsed thrift now
under federal investigation that bought hundreds of millions of
Drexel-issued bonds. Parking refers to placing securities in
another party's name to avoid disclosing ownership to the
government.
   The report also claims Drexel used inside information about the
debt exchanges to profit by trading Texas International stock;
billed the company $3.2 million to set up a tax shelter for
interest income from Drexel junk-bond holdings; and charged nearly
$4 million for financial advice it never gave.
   Drexel denies the claims.
   ``On each occasion where we acted as financial adviser on
exchange offers for Texas International, strong economic benefits
were produced for the company,'' Drexel said in a statement.
``Based on everything we know, the allegations of the equity
committee are groundless.''
   The claims were not made by a federal law enforcement agency and
carry no more weight than a civil lawsuit. But they mirror the
kinds of allegations that have dogged Drexel for years.
   The common defense among former Drexel employees is that Wall
Street resented the upstart investment house for creating a wildly
successful product and siphoning business from established
``white-shoe'' firms.
   ``People that couldn't compete just couldn't take it,'' said a
longtime executive in Drexel's junk-bond department, based in
Beverly Hills, Calif.
   To be sure, Drexel's crimes and reputation don't tell the whole
story. Drexel lent money to Chrysler Corp. when no one else would;
helped Mattel Corp. avert bankruptcy; gave MCI Communications Corp.
the power to become a telephone giant.
   ``The people we dealt with at Drexel were very creative, very
bright, extremely diligent,'' said Robert Herndon, chief financial
officer of Pier 1 Imports Inc., which hired Drexel for debt
offerings in 1987 and 1988.
   ``I think the country has lost something,'' he said. ``Drexel
had a great idea in assisting low investment-grade companies to
have access to money that was otherwise not available.''
   But the Texas International report details a different Drexel _
similar to the one depicted by federal prosecutors _ a firm that
abused securities laws, arm-twisted clients and manipulated a
network of junk-bond buyers.
   The government's investigation showed ``there wasn't anybody
they wouldn't cheat if the occasion called for it,'' said Bruce
Baird, who ran the U.S. Attorney's Office securities fraud division
during the Drexel case and now is in private practice.
   ``It was sort of the excesses of the '80s personified,'' he said.

   Most energy futures weakened again Friday,
finishing the week on a negative note amid concerns about abundant
supplies.
   Gasoline futures posted the sharpest declines on the New York
Mercantile Exchange as they did on Thursday. But wholesale home
heating oil bucked the trend and regained some ground.
   The contract for May delivery of unleaded gasoline settled 1.18
cents lower at 62.11 cents a gallon, after Thursday's drop of 1.57
cents. The June contract also shed more than a penny a gallon while
more distant months ended with lesser losses.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, settled at $19.15 per 42-gallon barrel,
down 28 cents. Later contracts finished with similar losses.
   Among other refined petroleum products traded on the New York
Merc, May home heating oil added 0.40 cent to 53.71 cents a gallon,
erasing a portion of Thursday's loss of 0.71 cent. Later contracts
also settled higher.
   Meanwhile, natural gas for June delivery closed at $1.625 per
million British thermal units, up from $1.615 on Thursday.
Contracts for delivery further in the future were mixed. Natural
gas futures made their Merc debut earlier this week.
   Analysts said a bearish attitude developed in the energy market
late Tuesday after the American Petroleum Institute issued a weekly
report showing large crude stocks.
   Madison Galbraith, an oil specialist at Merrill Lynch Energy
Futures, said the selling sparked by the API figures pushed prices
below thresholds considered technically significant.
   ``The Tuesday night announcement by the API set a bearish tone
that led to a technical breakdown,'' he said.
   The drop below $20 a barrel for the nearby crude contract
earlier in the week helped cause the market's overall slump.

<HEAD>Lotus Announces Merger Agreement With Novell</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANCIS HOPKINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lotus Development Corp. and Novell Inc. agreed to
merge their computer software companies Friday, a move that could
give Lotus a leading edge in the software industry.
   The companies signed a letter of intent under which Novell would
become a subsidiary of Lotus after the stock-swap merger. No cash
would change hands.
   ``The primary reason for the merger is we were two companies
both leading in our prospective markets, and we figured we could do
better things for our customers if we got together,'' said Jim
Manzi, chairman, chief executive officer and president of Lotus.
``We're sort of perfectly complementary.''
   The agreement is subject to the approval of the boards of
directors and stockholders of both companies, in addition to
standard regulatory approvals, the companies said. The merger is
expected to be completed by July.
   Under the agreement, Lotus would swap 1.91931 shares of Lotus
common stock for each share of Novell common stock. Lotus would
issue about 41.6 million new shares to carry out the transaction.
   Novell was worth a total of about $1.3 billion at end of trading
Friday, while Lotus was worth $1.5 billion, making the merger worth
$2.8 billion, said David Bayer, an analyst at Montgomery Securities
in San Francisco.
   Investors did not cheer the announcement. Lotus shares closed
Friday at $34.25, down $2 a share, in national over-the-counter
trading. Novell closed at $38.75, down $4.12{, on the same market.
   Both Lotus and Novell said the merger would provide benefits to
both companies and their customers.
   ``The synergy from a customer standpoint, a sales and
distribution standpoint and in terms of future product offerings in
tremendous,'' said Novell Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Ray Noorda in a statement.
   Manzi said in a telephone interview that the merger would give
Lotus better positioning in the software market.
   ``I think we'll be a stronger competitor. Their leadership in
network and our leadership in organization is a real strong
combination,'' he said.
   Lotus had $556 million in revenue for fiscal year 1989, while
Novell posted $422 million in revenue.
   Cambridge-based Lotus is a leading producer of business
software, based primarily on its popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program.
It recently expanded 1-2-3 from its original version for
International Business Machine Corp.'s personal computers to
versions for computers made by other manufacturers.
   Lotus was ranked No. 3 in revenue of software companies last
year, behind No. 2 Microsoft Corp. and Computer Associates
International Inc., according to Software Magazine.
   Novell, based in Provo, Utah, makes software used to link
computers in networks for business-related tasks.
   Noorda would keep his positions with Novell and also become the
vice chairman of Lotus under the plan.
   ``We view this as a marriage or merger of equals,'' Manzi said.
   Nancy McSharry, an analyst who follows Lotus for International
Data Corp., said the merger would shake up the industry power
structure.
   ``Before, on the top was Microsoft, then there were others. Now,
with the merger, it really puts Lotus and Microsoft on the first
tier in the industry,'' she said. ``And the first tier is now a far
more balanced tier.''
   If the new association works, Lotus could assume the No. 1 spot
in the industry, McSharry said.
   Novell stands to gain from access to Lotus' established
worldwide market.
   ``We get about 45 percent of our business offshore, and last
year (Novell) had 38 or 40 percent offshore. We're a little bit
stronger offshore, particularly in Japan, and they're just getting
started there,'' Manzi said.
   Manzi said customers also will benefit from the merger.
   ``Novell is most successful in their field, and we are leaders
in ours. So if you can bring them together in the fold of things
its better for the customers,'' Manzi said.
   McSharry agreed with Manzi.
   ``In the short-term, it won't change the service provided to the
customers. But in the long-term, it significantly changes the
offerings,'' McSharry said. ``You'll see more industrywide
software. There'll be more emphasis on group (networked) software.''

   A Gerber Products Co. research plant is
retooling to resume production for a market of one: a profoundly
allergic 15-year-old boy who cannot live without a special baby
formula the company stopped making five years ago.
   For a few days this month, one quarter of the production space
at the Gerber research center in Fremont, Mich., will be devoted to
making MBF, a formula only Raymond Dunn Jr. wants or needs and
which Gerber is providing free of charge.
   ``People here are working on this on their own time,'' George
Purvis, Gerber research director, said Thursday. ``We all have our
own jobs, and this is one we added on.
   ``I don't want to talk too much about it,'' he added. ``It's
just something we can do, so we're doing it. It's a volunteer
project. The Dunns have nowhere else to turn.''
   Raymond, who lives with his parents in the Catskills town of
Yankee Lake, weighs only 31 pounds. He was born with an abnormally
small head and brain. He is severely physically and mentally
retarded, and cannot speak or see. He cannot move his thin arms or
tiny legs without help. His warped little spine has worn a dent in
the pad of his wheelchair.
   And, since the age of 5, Raymond has been allergic to almost
every form of nourishment. All that kept him alive was Gerber's
MBF, an expensive, meat-based formula for allergic infants.
   But in 1985, faced with declining sales, Gerber stopped making
the brown liquid formula. The Dunns tried dozens of alternatives,
but they all made Raymond sick.
   Gerber agreed to reveal its formula and process for making MBF
to any manufacturer who would supply Raymond, but none was willing
or able.
   So, Purvis said, ``We scrounged around for every can of the
stuff that was in existence,'' including many whose expiration date
had passed. After obtaining a Food and Drug Administration waiver,
Gerber began delivering them to the Dunns.
   The unsold backlog prolonged Raymond's life, but didn't make it
easier. Asthma kept him inside the house almost all the time. His
mother and her helpers had to brush his teeth, bathe and dress him.
To maintain his sense of touch, they ran his fingers through dry
rice and beans. He slept in a small bed in his parents' room, but
rarely for more than a few hours at a time.
   ``The little guy's been a 24-hour-a-day thing for the past 16
years,'' said his father, Raymond Sr., a car salesman. The Dunns
have no other children.
   It seemed life couldn't get any more difficult until the day in
July 1988 when Dunn's wife, Carol, got a letter from Gerber. The
company said its MBF was all gone, leaving Raymond with less than a
two years' supply.
   His mother, whose life already was totally consumed by his care,
sought help in dozens of letters to political and business leaders,
including President Bush, Donald Trump and the Princess of Wales.
But Gerber seemed her only hope.
   ``I believed they wouldn't let me down because there's human
beings in that corporation,'' she said. ``I felt that, somehow,
that Gerber would not let Raymond die.''
   Apparently she was right. Gerber employees who had been working
with Mrs. Dunn told their bosses they could assemble the equipment
and special ingredients (including beef hearts) to make a limited
amount of MBF.
   Soon the project will fill about 6,000 of the plant's 25,000
square feet of production space. Other projects will be delayed,
and the production run will cost Gerber about $15,000.
   Due to a lack of storage space, Gerber plans to produce only a
two years' supply. After that, said Purvis, ``if push comes to
shove, we'll do it again.''
   Mrs. Dunn, meanwhile, says she understands why Gerber responded
to her appeal: ``I'm just a mother trying to feed her son.''

<HEAD>New York Fines Bethlehem Steel $1 Million For Benzene Emissions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LACKAWANNA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bethlehem Steel Corp. has been fined
$1 million for the continuing discharge of benzene from its coke
oven operation near Buffalo, state officials said Thursday.
   State Environmental Conservation Commissioner Thomas Jorling
said the penalty is the largest New York has ever levied for a
violation of state air-pollution laws.
   ``The magnitude of the penalty is justified by the nature and
duration of the violations,'' Jorling said.
   State officials said the Bethlehem process in Lackawanna
represents the largest single industrial source of emissions of
cancer-linked benzene in New York state. With Thursday's fine, the
company has been assessed $1.33 million in civil penalties since a
state crackdown on emissions there began in 1984.
   ``We believe that the company acted improperly in allowing such
emissions to continue in spite of state laws designed to protect
the air New Yorkers breathe,'' said Jorling.
   The company discharged 1.5 million pounds of benzene a year
since the early 1970s, state officials said. But it was only when a
team of Buffalo-based Department of Environmental Conservation
investigators suspected the discharge and ran tests in 1987 that
the state first uncovered the problem.
   Jorling said Bethlehem Steel ``knew that its processes emitted
significant amounts of benzene,'' releases that were subjct to
state air-pollution laws.
   After a long series of negotiations, Bethlehem Steel signed an
order admitting the discharge this week and agreeing to the air
pollution treatment terms, state officials said.
   Bethlehem Steel issued a statement from its headquarters in
Bethlehem, Pa., in which it said it agreed to the settlement to
avoid protracted litigation.
   ``It will accelerate further improvement sand result in
completion of the environmental improvement program in
Lackawanna,'' the statement said.
   The DEC order would require BethEnergy, the coke-making division
of Bethlehem and one of the steel giant's two remaining operations
in Lackawanna, to cut emissions by 95 percent. Company officials
have said they already made some process changes that they estimte
reduced benzene emissions by 30 percent to 50 percent.
   BethEnergy also was directed to install a closed loop cooling
system designed to prevent the benzene emissions. State engineers
said the toxic chemical was emitted when water used to cool
high-temperature coke oven cases absorbed benzene and then was
later released as the water cooled.
   Benzene is a flammable, poisonous liquid used in paints, dyes,
plastics and insecticides. It has been linked to cancer in
laboratory tests.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Unchanged To Slightly Higher in Volatile Session</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices finished unchanged to slightly
higher Friday after a volatile session racked by
worse-than-expected employment figures for March and concern over
German currency-swap plans.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond closed unchanged from late
Thursday at 99.25 while its yield remained at 8.51 percent.
   Bond prices shot up after the government reported that the
growth in non-farm jobs last month was 26,000 _ far lower than
estimates of about 175,000. The figures implied that ``the economy
really isn't doing as well as we thought,'' said Mike Geraty, a
bond trader with Clayton Brown &amp; Associates in Chicago.
   Signs of economic weakness usually boost bond prices since they
imply the Federal Reserve may act to ease interest rates. Lower
rates boost the value of existing bonds.
   But bond prices dropped as several news reports reached the
market, said Wayne Lyski, portfolio manager for Alliance Capital
Management.
   One report said two unidentified Federal Reserve governors
believed economic growth was exceeding target figures, implying
they did not believe there was a need to move interest rates lower,
Lyski said.
   Then news reached the market that the West German central bank
expressed concern that a proposed 1-for-1 exchange rate between the
West German and East German marks would be inflationary and require
higher interest rates.
   Higher interest rates in Germany would make investments there
more attractive, making it likely that U.S. interest rates would
have to follow suit.
   The bond market also was jittery over concern about the weekend
meeting of leaders from the seven leading industrialized nations,
traders said. Lyski said concern centered around whether the
officials would move to increase the value of the Japanese yen
against the dollar.
   A strengthened yen would make yen-denominated investments more
attractive, putting upward pressure on U.S. interest rates.
   But after the morning turmoil, the market eased to a near
standstill, traders said, and prices returned to levels near
Thursday's close.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
government issues rose from 1-32 to 1-16 point, intermediate
maturities rose 1-16 point, and long-term issues ranged from
unchanged to up 1-32 point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.21 to 1,153.54.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds was unchanged at 91 15-32. The average yield
to maturity remained at 7.51 percent.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 8.01 percent as the
discount rose 2 basis points to 7.76 percent. Yields on six-month
bills were unchanged at 8.16 percent as the discount remained at
7.74 percent. Yields on one-year bills, which were issued
yesterday, fell to 8.25 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points
from the auction discount to 7.67 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 3-16, down from 8\
percent late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Small investors and the media could face higher
costs for their daily diet of stock prices under a proposal by the
nation's stock exchanges that could lead to new fees for market
data.
   A group of news organizations, discount stock brokerages and
database services is challenging the request for a contractual
change that could open the door to charges on 15-minute-old stock
quotes.
   Delayed last sale information, as it is called, is now free to
vendors, except for transmission costs.
   The debate on Wall Street and in Washington centers on the
ownership of data vital to the functioning of the nation's
financial markets. It also raises a First Amendment question: Are
stock prices news or just another commodity for sale?
   Under the present system, charges are applied only to
``real-time'' quotes, which are up-to-the-second prices. Individual
investors pay about $13 a month for real-time quotations from the
New York Stock Exchange. Institutions can pay up to $120 a month.
   The stock exchanges say they own the data, real or delayed, and
need to recover the costs of compiling and distributing it.
   Opponents of the proposal by the NYSE and seven other exchanges,
pending before the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Friday
that delayed-price fees would drive investors who can't afford to
pay for real-time data from the markets. They said the
15-minute-old numbers are public property.
   ``It's like charging for the wrapper on the candy after it's
been eaten,'' said Hugo Quackenbush, spokesman for discount broker
Charles Schwab &amp; Co.
   ``The exchanges are in the business of making the financial
markets accessible to everybody,'' said John Foley, director of
on-line stock trading for discount broker Quick &amp; Reilly.
``Information dissemination is part of that.''
   As opponents read it, the proposed contractual change would
eliminate the distinction between real-time and delayed data,
allowing the stock exchanges to charge for all numbers.
   But Thomas Haley, the NYSE's vice president for market data,
said the exchanges already have the right to charge for delayed
data and to alter the definition of delayed data. He called the
dispute ``a tempest in a teapot.''
   Haley, chairman of the Consolidated Tape Association, which made
the proposal, said charging some users for stock-price quotations
and giving it away free to others is unfair and should be
reconsidered.
   ``The exchange and the CTA receives nothing, zero, from those
organizations for the use of that data,'' he said. ``That operation
is being subsidized by all the others who are paying.''
   ``How long before you have the folks that are paying say, `I'm
paying too much?''' he said. ``You're letting the other group off
the hook. There has to be balance here.''
   Haley indicated the NYSE and other exchanges would consider
various billing schemes that could lead to charging for delayed
data or encouraging all users to buy real-time data.
   Delayed stock prices reach the public in various ways.
Individuals with personal computers pay database services for
access to quotes. Newspaper stock tables and some television
services such as Financial News Network run delayed prices.
   Discount brokers use 15-minute-old quotes to cut down costs of
servicing individual investors. Brokers said they would be forced
to pass on a charge for delayed quotes to customers.
   With the development of lightning-quick transmission capability
and competing computer databases in the last decade, more and more
businesses are using the stock exchange's free data to make a buck.
   ``If the NYSE continues to give away ... price dissemination
they will at some point enable an electronic competitor to eat
their lunch,'' said Eric K. Clemons, a professor at the University
of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. ``There's a very substantial cost
in providing that service.''
   Haley said the NYSE has 134 contracts to provide delayed data to
vendors, who in turn make it available to an estimated 1.5 million
personal users. He said about 200,000 display units have access to
real-time data.
   The Associated Press is one of a dozen groups that have objected
to the exchanges' proposal. In additiion to Schwab and Quick &amp;
Reilly, others include Financial News Network, Dow Jones &amp; Co.,
Fidelity Investments and Instinet Corp.
   For the AP and other media, the debate raises the First
Amendment question of whether stock quotations are news or products.
   ``It's always been our position that all stock information is
news that under the First Amendment we have a right to report,'' AP
Business News Editor James M. Kennedy said.
   ``We feel it's in the public domain,'' said Roger May, a
spokesman for Dow Jones, which publishes The Wall Street Journal.
``It's in the national interest to put this out to increase the
availability of stock-market information.''

<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T is expected to acquire a minority stake in
Memorex-Telex NV, a Dutch-based computer company, and to transfer
responsibility for some of its computer line to Memorex-Telex, an
industry analyst said Friday.
   Robert Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research of Phoenix,
Ariz., said the companies were expected to announce the deal
Friday. However, neither American Telephone &amp; Telgraph Co. nor
Memorex-Telex made such an announcement, and neither would comment
on the report.
   Under the reported plan, AT&amp;T would acquire a stake in privately
held Memorex-Telex of 5 percent to 10 percent, Djurdjevic said. In
exchange, the phone company would receive a seat on Memorex-Telex's
board of directors, he said.
   As part of the deal, AT&amp;T would transfer its line of computers
based on IBM's model 3270 machines to Memorex-Telex, Djurdjevic
said. Memorex-Telex makes a similar line of computer terminals.
   Djurdjevic, whose company does research on the computer industry
for clients, declined to reveal his sources. He said he could not
place a dollar value on the transaction.
   Memorex-Telex, based in Amsterdam, resulted from the 1987
purchase of Tulsa, Okla.-based Telex Corp., a computer systems
maker, by the former Memorex International NV. The company makes a
variety of computers and computer products and operates in 27
countries.
   Memorex-Telex had 1989 sales of $2.24 billion, said Julia C.
Gentz, a company spokeswoman in Tulsa. It has about 10,000
employees, including 6,500 in the United States, she said.

<HEAD>GE Files $1.15 Billion Lawsuit Against Daimler-Benz On Jet Engine
Contract</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE LAVOIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. has filed a $1.15
billion lawsuit against Daimler-Benz of West Germany, claiming that
Daimler's new alliance with United Technologies Corp. breached an
agreement it already had with GE to develop jet engines.
   The suit was filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in New York,
just one week after Daimler-Benz announced it had signed a
preliminary agreement with UTC to allow their jet engine divisions
to operate as a single company on certain ventures.
   GE claims that Daimler-Benz _ because of its strengthened ties
to UTC's Pratt &amp; Whitney division _ could give away GE's jet engine
trade secrets to UTC.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE are fierce competitors in the jet engine
business.
   A UTC spokesman on Friday dismissed assertions that GE trade
secrets were jeopardized by the collaboration between Daimler's jet
engine division _ Motoren-und Turbinen-Union _ and Pratt &amp; Whitney.
   ``Neither UTC nor Pratt &amp; Whitney needs, wants or would accept
confidential GE information,'' said UTC spokesman Dan Harrison.
``We have complete confidence in the integrity of Daimler-Benz, MTU
and its people.''
   Daimler-Benz, an aerospace, electronics and auto giant, said it
was studying the suit, but at this time saw no grounds for the
action.
   The lawsuit alleges that GE claims that Daimler-Benz and its jet
engine division already had a series of binding agreements to work
exclusively with GE in developing a new generation of high-thrust
commercial jet engines.
   The suit seeks damages of $1.15 billion and court injunctions to
bar Daimler-Benz from using trade secrets or working with any
company _ including UTC and Pratt &amp; Whitney _ to develop jet
engines that compete directly with engines covered under
GE-Daimler-Benz agreements.
   GE refused to comment on specifics in the lawsuit or on its
longstanding business relationship with the Daimler-Benz jet engine
division.
   ``We're letting the (lawsuit) filing stand on its own and speak
for itself,'' GE spokesman George Jamison said Friday.
   Harrison defended the new agreement reached between
Hartford-based UTC and Daimler-Benz, calling it a ``logical
outgrowth'' of a 20-year association between the two companies.
   MTU is now participating in three jet engine programs with Pratt
&amp; Whitney, and plans additional partnerships under the new
alliance. Although the strengthened relationship is not a merger,
the agreement means the two companies will act as one in designing,
engineering and marketing new engines.
   In its suit, GE says it has had contracts with MTU for more than
25 years, covering the sharing of confidential technological
information, revenues and costs for the development and sale of
commercial jet engines.
   The company estimates that the market for the classes of
commercial jet engines named in the suit is between $50 billion and
$100 billion.

<HEAD>Penn's Wharton School Names Boston Entrepreneur As New Dean</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomas P. Gerrity, an information technology
specialist and head of a Boston consulting firm, has been named as
dean of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of business.
   Gerrity, 48, will assume the post on July 1, subject to his
confirmation by the university's trustees April 20.
   Gerrity is president of CSC Consulting, which has five
divisions, including one in Europe, and employs more than 2,500
people worldwide.
   He served for four years on the faculty of M.I.T.'s Sloan School
of Management, where he pioneered the use of information technology
by senior executives, according to Wharton spokeswoman Margaret
Barry.
   ``We are delighted to welcome Tom Gerrity to Penn,'' Penn
president Sheldon Hackney said. ``His experience spans both the
academic and business communities. As a corporate leader,
successful entrepreneur and proven academic, he will provide strong
vision and direction to Wharton.''
   While at M.I.T., Gerrity founded Index Group, a consulting firm
in information technology that is now part of CSC and its parent
company, Computer Sciences Corp.
   Wharton has 177 faculty members, more than 5,000 students and
more than 4,000 executives who enroll in the school's education
programs each year.
   Gerrity succeeds Russell E. Palmer, who will step down in June.

<HEAD>Two Big NY Ad Agencies to Open California Offices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COSTA MESA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two big New York advertising agencies
are opening offices in Southern California, bucking a trend in
which some Eastern agencies have pulled out.
   Lowe Marschalk, which just won a Prudential Insurance account
estimated to be worth $60 million a year, plans to open an office
in Costa Mesa this month.
   Young &amp; Rubicam, which recently was awarded a $30 million 20th
Century Fox Film Corp. account, will open an office near Fox's Los
Angeles operations within a week. Y&amp;R once had an office in Los
Angeles but closed it in 1987 after it lost the business for Walt
Disney Productions.
   ``It's bad news for agencies like us,'' said Greg Helm,
president of the 18-month-old Los Angeles agency Stein Rorbaire
Helm. ``It brings two more agencies into the fray.''
   Another Eastern shop, William Esty, moved away in 1987 after
losing the Nissan account to Chiat-Day-Mojo. In 1988, less than two
years after it opened, Scali, McCabe, Sloves closed its Los Angeles
office.

<HEAD>USX Says It Won't Buy Icahn's Stake At Premium</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 8th graf `His plan ...' to fix typo in percent.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   USX Corp. said it won't pay Carl Icahn a
premium price for his 13.29 percent stake in an effort to stop his
plan to break up the steel and energy company.
   ``We do not pay greenmail and we won't ever pay greenmail,'' USX
Chairman Charles A. Corry said Thursday. ``We do occasionally buy
stock back through third parties, although we don't always know who
we are buying it from.''
   USX would be willing to buy some or all of Icahn's 34 million
shares ``at market value or below,'' spokesman William Keslar said.
   USX shares closed at $36.37{ Thursday on the New York Stock
Exchange, down 12{ cents.
   Corry said Icahn purchased about 30 million of his shares for
``somewhere between $22 and $23'' starting in 1986. He bought about
4 million more shares last fall at ``about $36 a share,'' Corry
said.
   Telephone calls to Icahn's Mount Kisco, N.Y., office were not
answered late Thursday.
   In a letter to USX stockholders earlier this week, Icahn said
his plan to break up USX would be worth $48 a share to stockholders.
   His plan calls for spinning off the company's U.S. Steel
division, giving current USX holders 80 percent of the shares and
selling the remaining 20 percent to new investors. USX would retain
its energy assets, primarily Marathon Oil Co.
   Icahn estimated the value of Marathon at $39 a share and the
value of the steel operations at $9 a share.
   Keslar said Icahn's estimate doesn't account for current cash
flow or earnings potential.
   ``It's an arbitrary figure made up of two arbitrary figures,''
Keslar said.
   Corry said about 65 percent of USX's revenue comes from energy
and 31 percent comes from steel.
   USX has opposed Icahn's proposal, saying it would cause tax
difficulties and make the separate divisions more vulnerable to
slumps in either the energy or steel markets.
   USX shareholders will vote on Icahn's propsal in a non-binding
ballot May 7 at Marathon's headquarters in Findlay, Ohio.

<HEAD>Windmere Wins $100 Million Judgment Against Philips</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury on Friday awarded about $100 million
to Windmere Corp. in an antitrust suit charging that the Dutch
company NV Philips had monopolized the rotary shaver market.
   The verdict came in a counterclaim by Windmere against Philips
and its subsidiary North American Philips Co., makers of the
Norelco shaver. Philips had initially filed suit in the case
against Windmere, charging unfair competition.
   The jury cleared Windmere on that charge, accepting the Miami
Lakes company's contention that Philips had attempted to monopolize
the market through predatory pricing in violation of the Sherman
Act.
   ``We're very pleased with the jury's verdict,'' said David
Friedson, president and chief executive officer of Windmere.
``We're going to have a good party.'' .
   The jury awarded Windmere $29.8 million, which is trebled
automatically under the Sherman Act to $89.6 million. The jury also
awarded reasonable attorneys' fees, interests and costs, bringing
the estimated total to more than $100 million, according to
Windmere attorneys.
   ``The rotary shaver war was started by Philips in 1984 as part
of an attempt to drive Windmere out of the rotary business,'' said
Gary Hoffman, an attorney for Windmere.
   ``The $87 million verdict gives Windmere the funds that it needs
to re-enter the markets and provide effective competition against
the Philips companies.''
   Hoffman said Philips controls about 95 percent of the $165
million rotary shaver market.
   Windmere attorney Gary Jones said the appeals process would
likely hold up payment of the award until mid-1991, but he said the
company is confident the jury's verdict would be upheld.
   The case was first filed in Washington, D.C., in 1984, and a
jury found in favor of Windmere on the monopolization issue while a
judge directed a guilty verdict against Windmere in the unfair
competition provision.
   The verdicts were overturned on appeal, however, and retried in
Miami. The decision Friday capped a four-week trial before U.S.
District Judge Stanley Marcus.
   Hoffman, who also represents Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. in a similar
suit filed by Philips, said he will ask for a summary judgment
against Philips in that case, based on Friday's verdict.
   Windmere employs about 300 people in Miami Lakes and has 50 to
100 other employees around the country, said Friedson. The
company's manufacturing plants are in China and Hong Kong.

<HEAD>Scandal-Plagued Home Builder Files For Bankruptcy Protection</HEAD>

   General Development Corp. filed for federal
bankruptcy protection Friday, less than a week after revealing a
severe cash shortage and agreeing to a $100 million repayment
program for victims of a scheme to sell overpriced homes.
   But it was not immediately known how the Chapter 11 bankruptcy
filing in Miami will affect the restitution plan. The plan is part
of a plea agreement to settle a 16-count federal indictment
alleging that nearly 10,000 home buyers were deceived into
purchasing homes at inflated prices.
   The 35-year-old company will retain present management, but the
bankruptcy court will have control over efforts to borrow money or
sell assets.
   Earlier this week, Miami-based General Development said it was
considering a bankruptcy filing after negotiations for $60 million
in short-term credit fell apart.
   The company's financial problems have caused delays in paying up
to $10 million in property taxes and have cut back improvements and
development at its communities.
   On Tuesday, General Development closed 24 sales offices in the
United States and broker bureaus overseas and laid off about 1,100
workers.
   ``While we ... deeply regret having to take the step of filing
for bankruptcy relief, our board determined that this action was
necessary in light of the company's inability to secure additional
financing to meet its short-term cash needs,'' said General
Development President Charles Simons.
   The bankruptcy filing does not affect General Development's
Vistana Resort and Glen Ivy subsidiaries, which operate time-share
resorts near Disney World and the West.
   A statement from General Development said the company may
present a financial restructuring plan within several months.
   General Development stock closed 37{ cents a share lower at
$2.50 Friday in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   A master was appointed by the court Tuesday to review the
restitution program before final approval. The victims of the
overpricing scheme _ most from the Midwest and Northeast _ were
charged an average of 40 percent above market value for homes at
General Development's nine Florida communities, said prosecutors.
   Thomas Wood, a mortgage banker and attorney assigned to review
the plan, said he has asked General Development to provide
financial data by April 16.
   ``The Bankruptcy Court has its jurisdiction and the U.S.
District Court has its own jurisdiction,'' said Wood. ``Right now,
we are proceeding ahead with looking at the plan.''
   Earlier this month, the company pleaded guilty to one fraud
count that could bring a maximum $500,000 fine.
   Also, General Development's former president Robert Ehrling and
former chairman David Brown pleaded guilty to one fraud count. Each
faces a maximum of five years in prison, a $250,000 fine and
restitution payments. Sentencing is scheduled for May 22.
