<TEXT>
   Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of American
Continental Corp., and five other top executives of the
Phoenix-based corporation resigned Friday following two legal
defeats, Keating's attorney said.
   Also resigning were corporation president Judy J. Wischer, and
Robert J. Kielty, Robert M. Wurzelbacher Jr., Andrew F. Ligget and
Bradley J. Boland.
   On Thursday, a federal judge in Washington ruled that Keating
and his associates had looted Lincoln Savings and Loan Association
of millions of dollars in federally insured deposits.
   The day before, a Los Angeles judge said Keating must prove that
he is out of money and ordered him not to transfer funds out of the
country.
   Keating could not be reached to comment on his resignation.
Stephen C. Neal, his personal attorney, released a short statement
on his behalf.
   ``While we vigorously disagree with the opinion expressed
yesterday by Judge Stanley Sporkin of the United States District
Court, it has become clear that my client must now concentrate all
his energy on aggressively defending the legal charges against
him,'' Neal said.
   ``Because of that, and in light of the fact that these
individuals are no longer in a position to effectively direct ACC,
they have resigned from all of their positions, effective
immediately.''
   Boland, Keating's son-in-law, had been the corporation's
public-relations chief. Kielty was senior vice president and
general counsel, Ligget was the chief financial officer, and
Wurzelbacher had been president of a commercial real-estate
subsidiary.
   American Continental and 11 subsidiaries filed for
reorganization under Chapter 11 of federal bankrupcty laws on April
13, 1989, and federal regulators took control of Lincoln, a $5.8
billion, California-based S&amp;L which was the corporation's primary
asset.
   Keating claimed that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and its
successors, the Resolution Trust Corporation and the Office of
Thrift Supervision, had waged war with him because of his stands
against government regulation.
   Sporkin heard more than 30 days of testimony before ruling
Thursday that Keating and the others abused their positions in what
``amounted to a looting of Lincoln.'' Sporkin also dismissed
Keating's suit to recover Lincoln.
   Regulators have estimated that Keating's use of Lincoln's
federally insured deposits to finance various junk bond, stock and
real estate ventures and the institution's subsequent collapse
could cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion.
   The government already has spent $1.2 billion keeping Lincoln
and its more than 20 branches in Southern California afloat,
according to lawyers in the case. The government also has a $1.3
billion civil fraud and racketeering suit pending against Keating.

<HEAD>Student Aid Rising, But Not Enough To Beat College Inflation</HEAD>

   Student aid climbed during the 1980s to a record
$27.9 billion, but not nearly fast enough to keep pace with college
costs, the College Board reported.
   Aid from all sources grew just 10 percent between 1980 and 1990,
adjusted for inflation, the board said in its annual report,
``Trends in Student Aid: 1980-1990.''
   In current dollars, total aid increased by 62 percent from the
$17.23 billion available in 1980-81.
   But the cost of attending public universities rose by 105.3
percent in current dollars and 40 percent in inflation-adjusted
dollars during the 1980s.
   At private universities, costs rose 133.9 percent in current
dollars, and 59.5 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars, the
board's Washington, D.C., office said in the report released
Thursday.
   A record 13.5 million students attended undergraduate and
graduate programs in the last school year, compared with 12.1
million in 1980, federal statistics show.
   Institutional aid _ grants and loans awarded by colleges and
universities from their own resources _ grew by 178 percent during
the decade, from $2.06 billion to $5.73 billion. After adjusting
for inflation, such aid was up 90 percent over the last 10 years.
   State grant programs grew by 123 percent during the decade, from
$801 million to $1.79 billion. Adjusted for inflation, such grants
were up 52 percent.
   Offsetting those gains, however, was an effective decline in
federal aid.
   Preliminary figures for 1989-90 showed that the federal share
including all grants and loan programs totaled $20.36 billion,
compared with $19.95 billion a year earlier. A decade ago, $14.37
billion was available.
   Adjusted for inflation, however, federal aid declined 3 percent
from 1980-81 levels, the report found.
   The drop reflected the end in 1985 of college benefits provided
by Social Security as well as a 76 percent decline in veterans
benefits. Such assistance totaled $601 million in 1989-90, compared
with $1.71 billion a decade earlier, the report found.

<TEXT>
   A court has annulled the 1979
prison sentences given President Vaclav Havel and two other leading
officials convicted of subversion by the ousted Communist
government, the CTK news agency reported.
   Havel, Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier and CTK's current head,
Peter Uhl, were prominent dissidents when they were sentenced to up
to five years for alleged subversion.
   The three, whose sentences Prague's City Court annulled
Thursday, were founders of the Committee for the Defense of the
Unjustly Persecuted, a dissident group that cooperated with the
Charter 77 human rights group.
   Havel was sentenced to 4{ years in prison at that time,
Dienstbier to three years and Uhl to five years.
   The three were sentenced to jail terms repeatedly under the
Communists for their dissident activities, but became leaders of
the country after last November's peaceful revolution.

<HEAD>New Policy of Disengagement Frustrates Soldiers and Palestinians</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>GAZA CITY, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army plans to lower
the Israeli flag and remove a tent encampment near Gaza City as
part of a new policy intended to reduce friction with Palestinians.
   Soldiers have orders not to open fire and to avoid
confrontations with stone-throwing youths. Patrols rarely enter the
villages and crowded refugee camps.
   The disengagement reflects a radical shift in the army's
military doctrine, and its effectiveness is reducing bloodshed in
the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories that began in
December 1987.
   No one has been killed since May in the Gaza Strip, where the
uprising began. In July, three Palestinians were killed in the West
Bank, the lowest monthly toll of the revolt, in which Israelis have
killed well over 700 Palestinians.
   ``This can't be called turning a blind eye . . . but whoever
thought of it was brilliant,'' a military commander said, on
condition of anonymity.
   He said the policy had been implemented gradually after the
massacre of seven Gaza workers by an Israeli gunman May 20 started
10 days of riots in which 18 Palestinians died.
   Israel is changing its tactics at a time of of increasing
conflict among Palestinians.
   Since June 1, twice as many Palestinians have been killed by
other Palestinians as by soldiers, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israeli authorities.
   Assad Saftawi, an elementary school principal and leading PLO
supporter in the Gaza Strip, described the new policy as a ploy by
Defense Minister Moshe Arens to improve Israel's image abroad.
   Some prominent Palestinians say the uprising is in trouble and
seek a new, longer-term strategy to revive morale.
   Hamdi Faraj, a journalist in Bethlehem, said PLO chairman Yasser
Arafat should acknowledge the revolt, or intefadah, has flagged and
is unlikely to bring Palestinian statehood in the new future.
   ``There is a gap between what the PLO says and what the people
see,'' he said. ``The state is not a stone's throw away like they
claim in slogans.''
   At the Dheishe refugee camp in the West Bank, several activists
blamed Palestine Liberation Organization policy for the revolt's
loss of impetus and accused Arafat of making concessions without
getting anything in return.
   Khaled, 25, who says he has been wounded three times and served
10 months in jail without trial, said Arens timed his change of
strategy well. ``The intefadeh has cooled down and Arens played his
cards at the right time because people are tired and not chasing
after the army,'' he said.
   Ibrahim, 33, said: ``The intefadeh has almost stopped, and the
people have to start realizing that they have to take the solution
in their own hands and do it themselves.'' He said younger men
should be brought into the PLO leadership.
   Neither gave his last name.
   For the army, the Arens policy signifies reversal of a
longstanding military doctrine of taking the offensive and
confronting each small demonstration to keep riots from developing.
   ``It was very strange for the soldiers, who have been drilled to
charge, to attack and to fire, to be told, `halt . . . restrain
yourselves','' the military commander said.
   Because of the relative quiet, he said, an army encampment set
up in the middle of the village of Beit Hanun would be dismantled
and the troops evacuated. Villagers were told soldiers would return
in force at the first signs of violence.
   Restraint also was evident elsewhere.
   From an army lookout post near the Jabalia refugee camp, black
smoke could be seen rising as Palestinian youths ignited a tire in
the streets.
   In the past, such an act would have brought swift action by an
army patrol, and possibly casualties.
   This time, Itzik, a 21-year-old first sergeant, looked at the
smoke and shrugged his shoulders.
   ``We'll probably let it burn itself out,'' he said. ``Besides,
it creates a lot of heavy black smoke and the (Palestinians) have
to breathe it. If it were four or five tires, then we'd probably go
in with a company'' of about 100 men, he said.
   Politicians have praised the army for restraint, but military
sources said some soldiers of lower rank felt it could be
interpreted as a sign of weakness.
   Young Palestinians say they will carry the fight to the army.
   ``Arens might pull back the soldiers, but in that case we will
start chasing the army,'' said Fuad, 17, who showed a reporter
wounds behind the ear and on his arm from rubber-coated steel
bullets.

<TEXT>
   The United States may have saved Saudi
Arabia's rulers from being toppled by Iraq, but in the long run the
military intervention in the Persian Gulf is fraught with peril for
America and its Arab friends.
   Unless the United States ``takes into account all the long-term
implications of the situation, its actions may produce a recipe for
permanent upheaval rather than the regional stabilization which is
its aim,'' Middle East analyst Charles Snow stressed.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's Aug. 2 conquest of Kuwait has
shaken the Arab world, polarizing it and triggering new, and often
surprising alliances.
   ``In the immediate future . . . the region will be very lucky
indeed if there's not an explosion of potentially epic
proportions,'' Snow said.
   ``Even if this can be avoided, the future looks bleak,'' said
Snow, a veteran analyst with the Nicosia-based Middle East Economic
Survey.
   Saddam's internment of U.S. and British hostages in Baghdad and
Kuwait and President Bush's decision to beef up the U.S. military
commitment, including calling up military reserves for the first
time in 20 years, has raised the temperature in recent days.
   Apart from the prospect of war and the danger Saddam will use
chemical weapons, there is the threat of a new wave of terrorist
attacks on U.S. and Western targets in the Mideast and beyond.
   U.S. intervention in Lebanon in 1983 as part of a multinational
peacekeeping force ended in disaster, with nearly 300 U.S.and
French servicemen killed in suicide bombings by Shiite Moslem
zealots.
   The Middle East was restive and uncertain even before Saddam
invaded Kuwait.
   The Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied territories; the
end of superpower rivalry that cast the regions adrift; and the
flood of Soviet Jews to Israel combined to radically alter the
Mideast equation.
   By portraying himself as the Islamic champion of the Arab world
and linking a withdrawal from Kuwait with Israel's occupation of
Arab land, Saddam has widened his appeal to Arab masses and the
Moslem world.
   Arab moderates have reluctantly gone along with U.S.
intervention in Saudi Arabia, at King Fahd's request, because they
were unable to check Saddam themselves.
   But they're uneasy about the American presence in such a
sensitive and strategic region.
   ``The less time the Iraqis are given to whip up anti-American
sentiment in the Arab world, the better as far as Washington is
concerned,'' Snow noted.
   Shahram Chubin, a Middle East specialist with Geneva's Graduate
Institute of International Studies, noted: ``The U.S. presence in
such force in the land of Islam's holiest places is likely to
create a lot of discontent in the Moslem world.
   ``The semi-permanent presence of the naval armada in the gulf
could well eventually antagonize Iran, even though it has opposed
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   ``The longer the Americans stay in the gulf, the worse it will
look for them,'' he said. ``The change in the Arab order caused by
Iraq's actions will not necessarily be in America's favor. The U.S.
intervention may have saved the Saudi royal family for now, but it
could ultimately undermine them.''
   Much depends on what Saddam does next.
   He basically has three options: try to sit out the siege,
capitulate and withdraw from kuwait, or fight.
   Capitulation is unlikely. If he meekly returns Kuwait to its
emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, Saddam would suffer a
catastrophic loss of face in the Arab world he seeks to lead.
   He would likely meet serious unrest at home. That would raise
the possibility of a putsch by the army.
   His generals might feel that on top of Saddam's ill-advised
invasion of Iran in 1980, a planned blitzkreig that bogged down
into an eight-year war, his miscalaculation over Kuwait has made
him a liability.
   But the Iraqi leader is cunning, unpredictable and a ruthless
survivor. Nothing can be taken for granted.
   The Americans also face the risk that if Saddam opts for the
long haul, the international support Washington has mustered could
begin to dissipate.
   If Saddam, threatened with economic strangulation by U.N.
sanctions and a barricade, moves into Jordan to secure his only
lifeline, he would trigger a powerful Israeli response.
   That would intensify the bitterness in many Arab quarters
against the United States, Israel's main protector.
   The Americans, some believe, might move against Saddam in Kuwait
if they detected signs he planned to play the Israeli card in a bid
to unite the Arabs behind him.
   Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens stressed Aug. 7: ``The
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait does not represent a geo-strategic change
for Israel. But the moment we see that we're facing a change like
the entrance of the Iraqi Army into Jordan, we will act.''
   King Hussein of Jordan, Saddam's key Arab ally, is extremely
vulnerable. If he goes along with the sanctions, he risks Saddam
turning on him as well as serious internal upheaval among his 3
million people, many of them Palestinians who are strongly
pro-Saddam.
   ``It seems unlikely to the point of improbability that the
Americans are assembling this kind of firepower merely to watch the
Iraqis dig in in Kuwait, and if they intend to take more positive
action they may have cogent reasons for doing so sooner rather than
later,'' Snow noted.
   ``Once the United States has finished marshalling its forces in
the region ... the battle for the gulf will be joined in earnest.
The only uncertainty seems to be when, not whether, the storm will
break,'' he added.

   An American Marine from New York had one
question when he arrived in this desert kingdom: ``Are the Mets in
first?''
   Most of the thousands of U.S. troops here have no access to
American publications or any television, so they incessantly ask
visiting reporters about the situation back home.
   ``Do the American people want us here?'' an Army private on a
desert exercise this week wanted to know.
   ``Is President Bush saying we'll go to war?'' asked an Air Force
supply officer.
   A mimeographed newsletter attempts to fill the void with a story
headlined: ``Secretary of Defense Explains Why We Are Here.'' But
it does little to satisfy the appetite of the news-hungry Americans.
   ``The situation is very uncertain,'' Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney says in the newsletter. ``We don't know how long it will
last.''
   However, there are signs the troops will be getting more access
to the news. A daily shipment of newspapers has been sent to some
camps this week.
   ``They get passed around and read again and again and again,''
said a spokesman for the 82nd Airborne. ``The guys are hungry for
news.''
   A few issues of the military newspaper Stars &amp; Stripes have
turned up in the past few days, and the small newsletter that
carried Cheney's remarks is being published at one Saudi airbase
where U.S. forces are positioned.
   Iraq is trying to fill the news void with radio broadcasts
suggesting that while Americans are protecting Saudi oil fields the
``petrol emirs'' are in the United States and have ``enjoyed'' the
company of American women.
   ``I thought it was pretty funny, actually,'' said a member of
the 82nd Airborne Division who listened to the broadcast earlier
this week. ``If that's their idea of psychological warfare I don't
think we have much to worry about.''
   The Saudi media also has had its fair share of recent propaganda.
   Local television, which can be seen by some U.S. forces staying
in hotels or Saudi barracks, frequently includes lengthy segments
showing the arrival and exercises of troops in the kingdom. There
is no narration, but patriotic music booms.
   Saudi papers carry daily dispatches from a state press agency
designed to assure the public that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
will not affect Saudi Arabia's food supplies, economy or security.
   The Saudi papers also have published numerous wire service
stories about the crisis. Americans who live here say the local
press never has been this open before.
   But one 20-year-old Army driver didn't really need a newspaper
to tell him what was going on.
   He says he was told at a briefing that U.S. troops were on ``a
peacekeeping mission,'' but he said he knew there was a good chance
for combat.
   How did he know?
   ``They issued live rounds instead of blanks,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's voice to
the world in his war of words with President Bush is a dapper
television anchorman named Miqdad Muradi.
   In the last two weeks, while Saddam has kept a low profile in
the escalating crisis triggered by his Aug.2 invasion of Kuwait,
Muradi has read a string of statements from the president on Iraq's
state-run television network.
   These broadcasts, carried around the globe by Cable News
Network, have made the Iraqi something of a TV star. Murad, who
bears a striking resemblance to Saddam, is always impeccably
dressed in a dark suit and sober tie.
   Murad, who is in his mid-40s, shows no sign of strain when he
reads Saddam's often rambling statements, calling Bush ``a liar''
or announcing that thousands of Americans and Britons held by Iraq
are ``guests'' of his country.
   Muradi has been chief announcer on the Iraqi network for several
years.
   During the 1980-88 war against Iran, he frequently read
important statements, usually announcing Iraqi ``victories.''

<TEXT>
   Saddam: You were playing volleyball. Just now you were playing?
   Ian Morton: No, yesterday.
   S: Do you have a team here, do you play with Iraqis?
   I: Yes.
   S: Don't you play anything? Don't you play games, Stuart. Like
what? What do you play?
   Stuart: Football.
   S: And the ladies, how are you passing time?
   Unidentified lady: I can't say.
   S: I am an Iraqi and I realize if I were in your shoes, I would
rather be in Iraq, my country. But sometimes one is forced to face
situations that are not of his own choice. ...
   Your presence here and in other places is meant to prevent the
scourge of war. To avoid war.
   In Arabic, we say preventing danger. There is a semantic and
linguistic problem here. We, in our communique, used the word Dar'a
in Arabic, which means to put away or to prevent or to avoid the
scourge of war or the danger of war. We used the word Dar'a, which
means to prevent. But when we used this word, Western media used
... misunderstood the pronunciation of the word Dar'a into Der'a,
which means shield and they thought that we were using people as a
Der'a, which means shield rather than a Dar'a, which we meant,
which means to prevent war.
   So there was a mis ... uh ... perhaps deliberate
misinterpretation or inadvertant misinterpretation of our wording
of our communique.
   Stuart, for instance, Stuart will I'm sure be happy to have as
part of his life or his history, personal history, that he played a
role in maintaining peace. So when he, along with his friends and
all those present here, have played their role in preventing war,
then they will all be heroes of peace.
   I'm sure that you all have your own journals and your own
diaries, perhaps, and you will jot down whatever you have as
feelings or recollections or impressions of these days. And in any
case your presence now and in this sort of atmosphere is not a
source of pleasure to us.
   This does not make us happy. What would make us happy would be
to see you back in your countries, or back in Baghdad in the normal
way you used to do.

   S: What is your name?
   I: Ian
   S: So please forgive us because we, like you, have our own
children like Ian and Stuart and we also have our own women like
you and have our own families and we know how you feel, but we are
trying to prevent a war from happening and we hope that you, as
guests, wont't be here for too long.
   Now I'm prepared to listen to whatever you have to say and to
answer any questions you may have.
   Unidentified woman: First and foremost, we appreciate that he
(Saddam) has come in person simply because no one else has been
able to answer our questions.
   S: I am here to answer all your questions.
   UW: We have school-going children. Here, my son's got two sons.
School begins in about a week's time and on the first of September
and some of them are in the middle of important exams and that
itself is going to cause immense problems.
   S: We hope that your presence here is not going to be long. ...
   If by the time schooling begins and you are still here in Iraq,
we are going to (go to) unusual efforts to make sure that the
children are not deprived of their continued schooling. And we will
send to you experts from the Ministry of Education to see the
curricula and the levels of schooling in which your children are so
that everything will be prepared for the children not to lose the
opportunity of school.
   All religions urge us to learn more and more and in our religion
the first time God Almighty addressed his prophet Mohammed, praise
be on his soul, through Gabriel as God said to Mohammed through
Gabriel: Read. So reading and learning is a fundamental thing in
the life of man and we know what it means.
   One would have wish that the kind of coincidence which occurred
to you should have been reversed. ...
   But it has happened, and we are faced with the outcome of acts
some of which have come by chance, by pure coincidence and some
which have come actually by deliberate feeling.
   But we, for our part, will try to treat you in the same way as
we treat Iraqis because you are not hostages here. We want nothing
from Britain or the U.S. We want nothing from them. They owe us
nothing. We owe them nothing.
   (A) question should be addressed to them: what has Iraq taken
from you that has made you come with your forces threatening Iraq
and the lands and territory of God and Moslems? What has Iraq done
to deserve this? We want nothing from London or from any
English-speaking ... we have take nothing away from the U.S.

   UW2: We're very concerned about our families at home. We don't
mind that we're ... we realize that we're of unknown destination
but we would like them to know that we are fit and well. Our
parents are old and in ill health.
   S: Yes, we shall make sure your messages will reach your family
in England. As of now, you can write your letters and messages
including photographs here, then you can send it to them, this is
my instruction to my people here and it will be implemented as of
now. ...
   S: I must be exact. That regrettably nobody has conducted any
negotiation or dialogue with us yet. ... And (garble) he announced
that Iraq would be prepared to get into negotiations. And the
response ... was immediate. It was quick, the same way the U.S. has
responded to all our entreaties. They said immediately that they
were not prepared to conduct any dialogue with Iraq until Iraq has
left Kuwait, as if Kuwait were Washington.
   Our response to this is that neither the Iraqis nor the Arabs in
general would be prepared to accept dialogue and the blackmail or
with preconditions. If anybody is prepared to come and talk to us,
then they are welcome, but not to blackmail.

   S: Yes, the East is more understanding as to the importance of
dialogue, especially if it were to be done in an atmosphere of
peace.
   We have so far issued two initatives and I'm sure you've seen
those two initiatives, or known about them one of which is
concerned with you in which I addressed myself to your families.
   One of the most regrettable ironies here is the fact that
President Bush, who is the president of the greatest and biggest
power on Earth as they say in fact, refused the initiative only a
few hours after I issued it, even before asking for the text.
   In any case both Bush and others are going to learn a great deal
from Iraq. On the human level and even on the level of more
accurate planning or considered planning ... all of this will be
the fact that the Iraqi people and Arabs in general will teach them
how to be closer to God.
   And this is going to happen. I'm happy to have seen you now even

circumstances.

   A convention _ er, smorgasbord _ of fat people?
Funny, right?
   Not so, the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance said
Thursday as its members met to discuss their progress in the battle
against bulge bias.
   The group, which claims some 3,000 members nationally, is
dedicated to improving the quality of life for the obese, or nearly
so, through public education, advocacy and support.
   Personal testimonials topped Thursday's agenda, as some 250
conference participants listened and applauded to the travails and
successes of their fellow members.
   Catherine Johnson, of San Diego, described the embarrassment of
having to ask for seat-belt extenders while traveling by air.
   Then there are the problems buying clothing.
   ``When you ask for a 44D (bra), sales clerks look at you and
say, `We'll have to check in the back,''' Johnson said, as members
laughed.
   Fat is serious business, said Bob and Linda Sponaugle, of Atco,
N.J. They showed a letter they received from Hallmark agreeing to
discontinue some greeting cards and a coffee mug offensive to fat
people.
   ``It's your birthday and tons of women want you,'' said one of
the cards on the outside. Inside was a picture of two fat women in
clown costumes. ``These are the women,'' the card said.
   Frances White, a 340-pound belly dancer from San Francisco, told
attendees her six-member dance troupe performs at private parties,
festivals and restaurants.
   ``We call ourselves the `Voluptuous Jewels,''' the 47-year-old
White said. ``We perform any place, any time _ as long as we get
paid.''
   Among those attending the session Thursday, called ``Our
Victories: Public and Private,'' was a Baltimore woman who recently
had to take a driver's test for a second time, to prove she was not
too fat to function behind the wheel.
   ``I'm not phony,'' said Regina Guy, who ran into trouble with
the Maryland Motor Vehicle Administration after being pulled over
because of faulty car headlights.
   ``I'm not afraid to say I'm a fat person,'' said Guy, who has
threatened to sue over the July incident.
   Another woman said her fight for the rights of fat people goes
to the U.S. Supreme Court this fall.
   Sharon Russell, a former nursing student, sued a Rhode Island
college where she said she was forced to sign a weight-loss
contract and then told to leave the school when she failed to shed
weight.
   Russell, now 25 and a pediatric nurse, was awarded $44,000 by a
lower court. The case against Salve Regina College goes to the
Supreme Court on appeal from the college in October.
   The money was not the important part, she told the crowd, which
gave her a standing ovation.
   ``It's more important that people recognize that size
discrimination is a valid issue,'' Russell said. ``There's nothing
in the law right now about size. It only lists race, creed,
religion, color.''
   The group's annual convention runs through Sunday and includes a
fashion show, a presentation on the dangers of dieting, and
workshops in aerobics and belly dancing.
   Also on the agenda: organizing a grassroots letter-writing
campaign against products, media coverage and advertising with an
anti-fat bias.

   Bobbie MacKenzie started out simply
enough, stuffing handfuls of matchbooks into a little box as
mementoes of trips and special nights out. Thousands of matchbooks
later, she got serious.
   ``Like every other collector, I thought I was the only one doing
this,'' recalled MacKenzie, one of about 500 matchbook cover
collectors meeting in Springfield this week.
   ``Matchcover collecting is probably one of the biggest hobbies
in the world but one of the least known,'' said Chuck Ledger,
chairman of the 50th Annual Rathkamp Matchcover Society meeting.
   ``Suddenly you find out that there are people who do this,'' he
said. ``It becomes very engrossing after a while.''
   The Rathkamp Matchcover Society traces its roots to 1939, when a
group of enthusiasts visited the Brooklyn Navy Yard in New York to
pick up service and ship matchbooks and visit the New York World's
Fair. An informal meeting was held that year at the home of Henry
Rathkamp of Newport, R.I., who died in 1940.
   ``A group of the fellows got together and thought it would be
kind of neat to go to the Navy yards because it was World War II
and there was a lot of matchcovers available at that time,'' Ledger
said. ``They had such a good time doing it that they decided to
make it an annual thing.''
   Today, the society has more than 1,500 members in 16 countries.
   On Thursday, groups of collectors ruffled through stacks of free
matchcovers piled up on ``grab tables'' and wandered past exhibits.
   The covers varied from scantily clad ``girlies'' of the 1940s to
advertisements urging Americans to buy war bonds and ``Remember
Pearl Harbor.'' There were rafts of matchcovers commemorating
battleships and nostalgic covers plugging Big Band groups. More
modern displays included complete sets of hotel chains and shiny
gold and silver foil covers.
   One of the club's oldest members, 81-year-old Bob Oliver, began
collecting matchcovers in 1932 after he spied a shiny gold cover on
the ground at the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
   From that casual start, Oliver, who now lives in Mira Loma,
Calif., became an avid collector, once traveling 87 miles in
Manhattan as he and his son collected matchbooks from different
hotels.
   Most collectors strip the books of matches, hence the term
``matchcover.'' Some amass labels from matchboxes. Serious
collectors call themselves ``phillumenists.''
   Explaining their hobby to outsiders can be difficult, Ledger
said.
   ``They think we're crazy, that's the first reaction,'' he said.
``It's followed very closely by ``well, what are they worth?' My
standard answer is they're not worth a darn thing.''
   In fact, matchcover collectors call their passion ``the poor
man's hobby.'' Auction prices generally range in the tens of
dollars, rather than the hundreds.
   Collectors, many of whom are retirees, said the most important
thing about matchcover collecting is the friendships that go with
it.
   ``The key to this whole thing is the word hobby,'' Ledger said.

<TEXT>
   Although violence surrounds
them, many whites are watching the savage fighting between black
factions as if it were happening in another country.
   Some whites worry about the turmoil and what it means for South
Africa and the chances of a peaceful future. Others say it proves
the 5 million whites cannot share political power with the 30
million blacks.
   Many whites just shake their heads and ignore the fighting.
   ``It's terrible. There's no need for it, but there's nothing we
can do,'' said Jane King, a white secretary.
   In the white suburbs, the fighting is something residents just
read about in newspapers or watch on television. Some 500 blacks
have been killed and at least 1,400 injured in fighting in black
townships around Johannesburg this month.
   The segregation of neighborhoods and the positioning of black
townships in a belt around Johannesburg has kept the killing at a
distance, even though some white and black areas are just a few
hundred yards apart. Many whites rarely mix with blacks unless the
blacks are workers or servants.
   But Moira Smith, a white woman who saw children fleeing fighting
in the Katlehong township, was devastated by the scene.
   ``There was blood on their clothes. I will never forget the
absolutely haunting look of terror in their eyes. It was the most
dreadful thing I have ever seen,'' she said.
   Whites opposed to ending apartheid say whites will be killed if
a black government ever takes power.
   A white woman looking at a picture of armed black fighters while
reading a newspaper in a shop exploded with anger.
   ``Look at them ... And they want our country. It's sickening,''
she said.
   Some whites have written to newspapers warning the country is on
the brink of war.
   ``I can think of no parallel in recent history where a ruling
powerful minority voluntarily abdicates control in the full
knowledge that by so doing they are condemning themselves to
permanent political subjugation by a largely semi-literate Third
World majority,'' said a letter to The Citizen newspaper signed
``Alarmed and Disturbed.''
   J. Allen said in another letter, ``For how long is the white
electorate going to allow this anarchic situation to continue?''
   President F.W. de Klerk is negotiating with the African National
Congress on ending the apartheid system of racial segregation and
sharing power with blacks.
   The latest fighting has pitted Zulu supporters of the
conservative Inkatha movement against Xhosas, many of them tied to
the ANC, the largest black opposition group.
   In the eastern province of Natal, black-on-black violence still
continues after five years of fighting and some 5,000 deaths.
   The pro-apartheid Conservative Party, the main opposition white
party, has attempted to use the black violence to bolster its
challenge to de Klerk. It says the violence vindicates its position
that a black government would lead to anarchy and bloodshed.
   ``If one white person dies it will be on the government's
conscience. We will mobilize our people and stop them with
violence,'' said party spokesman Koos van der Merwe in a recent
speech.
   But so far there has been little indication of what impact the
black violence is having on white political opinion. Government
officials say the majority of whites still support de Klerk's
reforms.
   But political observers have expressed fears of a bloody power
struggle between rival black groups if white rule ends.
   ``Nobody in his right mind can this time blame apartheid or the
police. This is a bloodletting between black and black that is
something no one can excuse,'' said The Citizen newspaper in an
Aug. 20 editorial.

   The U.S. Air Force general in charge of transporting troops to
Saudi Arabia, Gen. Hansford T. Johnson, said Tuesday at least
35,000 troops were already in Saudi Arabia or en route. Deployments
could go as high as 250,000.
   They include elements of the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions,
the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division, the 11th Air Defense
Artillery Brigade and the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment.
   Also dispatched to the gulf were a contingent of 45,000 Marines.
   The American fleet in the gulf and Arabian Sea waters
immediately outside it totals about 30 ships, including three
aircraft carriers, a battleship armed with Tomahawk cruise
missiles, more than a dozen missile cruisers, destroyers, supply
ships and an undisclosed number of submarines. Two hospital ships
are sailing for the gulf. Another seven ships are expected in the
Mediterranean.
   The Pentagon has also sent 22 Stealth fighter-bombers and dozens
of other aircraft.
   BRITAIN

stay in the eastern Mediterranean..
   Also dispatched were three squadrons of Tornado and Jaguar
fighter-bombers. A squadron totals 12-16 planes. One squadron is
based in Saudi Arabia and the Jaguars are at Thumrait airbase in
neighboring Oman. The third squadron is expected to arrive from a

<TEXT>
   Kuwait's government in exile is ``alive and
well'' and forming a liberation army to help in any military action
to free the country from Iraqi occupation, the Kuwaiti crown prince
says.
   ``We will fight and fight and fight until we drive out the
aggressors from our country,'' Prince Saad Abdullah al Sabah said
Thursday. ``We the Kuwaitis will never submit or surrender to
threats or to aggression or to occupation.''
   Such talk is taken lightly here. One Saudi official, for
example, said, ``Kuwait has a stealth army _ nobody's ever seen
it.''
   But Abdullah said some Kuwaitis who fled their homeland after
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion already are going back to help with a
resistance movement. Others, he said, are planning to arm
themselves and join the multinational force defending Saudi Arabia.
   ``We will be reorganizing, rearming, reequipping with necessary
arms to take part as an advance team in liberating our country,''
he said. Abdullah, the No. 2 official of the Kuwaiti government,
met with reporters at a hotel in a Saudi mountain resort.
   The hotel, heavily guarded by Saudi military police, is serving
as the headquarters for the Kuwaiti royal family.
   Another family member said the government-owned Kuwait petroleum
company would be operated from London during the Iraqi occupation.
   A third member of the al Sabah family, speaking privately, said
the Kuwaiti government would prefer that the United States attack
Iraq and cut off its supply lines to Kuwait, ultimately forcing a
withdrawal from Kuwait.
   ``We hope we do not have to destroy our country with war to get
it back,'' he said.
   Abdullah said two or three members of the al Sabah royal family
had been arrested in Kuwait. Aides said the Emir of Kuwait was in
the hotel but would not meet with reporters.
   Although many Kuwaitis have taken refuge in Saudi Arabia and
other nations, Abdullah declared: ``The Kuwaiti government is alive
and well.''
   ``We will do everything,'' he said. ``We are willing to
sacrifice everything, not only our money and our funds but also our
blood to liberate our country.''
   Abdullah implored world leaders to enforce economic sanctions
against Iraq and said he believed Iraq's Saddam Hussein would use
his troops in Kuwait to satisfy his ``aggressive designs'' on Saudi
Arabia.
   ``The unjustified and unlawful aggression has shown to all the
world the real designs and the real expansionist ambitions of the
Iraqi regime,'' he said.
   A Kuwaiti resistance movement, he said, ``is growing day by day.
It has been escalating and will continue to escalate.''
   Before Abdullah spoke, Ali Jaber al Sabah, a member of the royal
family who serves as marketing director for the government-owned
Kuwait Petroleum Co., said Kuwaitis still in their country have
reported that two palaces are being used as ``concentration camps''
for women and children arrested at demonstrations.
   Jaber said recent reports indicate food is getting scarce in
Kuwait but that looting was not as common as in the days
immediately following the invasion.

<TEXT>
   In shaping their policies on the gulf
crisis, Turkish leaders had on their minds the nation's problems
with its large Kurdish minority, according to official sources and
commentators.
   They suggest that Turkey is taking an active role in the crisis
now so that it will be listened to later. According to these
commentators, Turkey wants to make sure that any new order that
might emerge in the region does not include an independent state
for Kurds.
   So far, Turkey has refrained from any military involvement in
the crisis, triggered by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, but this
option has not been ruled out.
   But the NATO ally gave a major push to an international economic
embargo by cutting off two Iraqi oil pipelines across its
territory. It also imposed a trade ban and forbade Iraq, its
neighbor, from using Turkish roads or airspace to transport goods.
   Many Turks, including opposition party leaders, have questioned
the swiftness of these moves. They say Turkey's longstanding policy
of not antagonizing Mideast neighbors may have been jettisoned for
dubious returns and without sufficient deliberation.
   President Turgut Ozal, however, thought this was no time for
procrastination and staying on the sidelines, sources close to the
president report.
   The reasoning goes this way: The United States appears
determined to bring down Iraq's Saddam Hussein and make the Persian
Gulf oilfields secure. Probably this will lead to war. A peace
conference will eventually follow, maybe carving up Iraq and
setting up a new order in the region.
   Turkey would like to sit at the conference table to make sure
that an independent Kurdistan does not emerge and national
interests are not jeopardized.
   ``Those who say `Let's not get involved' should also answer the
question how Turkey could prevent it if the idea was brought to a
conference table for the establishment of a Kurdish state,'' said
Ertugrul Ozkok on Monday in the independent Istanbul daily Hurriyet.
   Similar commentaries appeared in other papers after Ozal gave a
background briefing to commentators and editors of Turkish
newspapers over the weekend.
   An estimated 20 million Kurds live in an area where the borders
of Turkey, the Soviet Union, Iran, Iraq and Syria converge. Turkey
has the largest group, an estimated 10 million out of a population
of 55 million.
   Several thousand guerrillas, members of the Marxist Kurdish
Labor Party, PKK, have been fighting for an independent Kurdish
state in Turkey's southeastern provinces. About 2,500 civilians,
security personnel and guerrillas have been killed since the
fighting began in 1984.
   The guerrillas operate from bases in Iraq and Syria, staging
hit-and-run attacks on Turkish settlements and military convoys.
   The mainly Kurdish local population basically remains loyal to
the central Turkish government. But they have been complaining of
being caught in the middle of the guerrilla war, suffering
mistreatment from the security forces, and facing bullets from the
guerrillas.
   Also, the Kurds are demanding some form of cultural autonomy,
allowing them to use their language publicly without harassment.
Currently they cannot speak Kurdish in official places or use it in
broadcasts, education and publications. They also want increased
state investments to improve the economic lot of their backward
region.
   These demands have received support from the main opposition
Social Democrat Populist Party.
   Before the outbreak of the gulf crisis, the United States
appeared to be supporting Kurdish aspirations, giving them voice in
a congressional report on human rights issued last spring.
   On the Iraqi side, the Kurds fought the Baghdad government
during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Shortly after a cease-fire
with Iran two years ago, Iraq attacked its Kurdish population with
chemical weapons.
   Some 60,000 Kurds fleeing chemical bomb attacks took refuge in
Turkey and about 40,000 still remain in refugee camps in
southeastern Turkey.

<HEAD>Mecham Still Alive in Gubernatorial Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM F. RAWSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports of the political demise of ousted former
governor Evan Mecham may have been premature.
   The feisty former car dealer's campaign to reclaim the Arizona
governor's office is very much alive and he remains in the thick of
the five-way race for the Republican nomination.
   ``He has a good chance. He has a very good chance,'' said
Phoenix pollster Earl de Berge.
   Other pollsters and consultants are careful to hedge their bets.
   ``If the turnout is under 35 percent, Mecham could win it,''
said Bruce Merrill, director of the media research center at
Arizona State University.
   Major polls show that millionaire land developer Fife Symington
is leading the GOP race, with Mecham battling former congressman
Sam Steiger for second place and two other candidates trailing.
   Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard is the odds-on favorite to
win the Democratic primary, facing only token opposition.
   The governor's race was thrown wide open when Democrat Rose
Mofford, the former secretary of state who inherited Mecham's job
in 1988, decided not to seek election this year.
   Polls show large numbers of Republicans still have not made up
their minds less than a month before the Sept. 11 primary.
Thirty-two percent remained undecided, according to de Berge's
latest survey, and Merrill's most recent poll showed 43 percent
undecided.
   Mecham, 66, captured the governor's office in 1986 on his fifth
try. But his term was cut short in April 1988 when he was impeached
by the state House and convicted by the Senate of misusing money
from supporters and interfering with a police investigation of an
alleged death threat by one of his aides.
   His opponents were quick to pronounce Mecham politically dead,
but polls consistently have shown that he maintained the base of
support that helped him win the three-way gubernatorial race four
years ago.
   None of the GOP candidates has done extensive advertising, and
all seem to be having trouble raising money, analysts say.
   ``Developers, banks, savings and loans, most of the big sources
of money have dried up this year,'' Merrill said. ``Most of those
people are struggling to save their own butts.''
   Some potential contributors reportedly have become reluctant to
give to Republicans because they believe ``as Ev Mecham rises in
the polls, it makes a Goddard win in November almost a certainty,''
said Jeff Hill, a Republican state senator and political consultant.
   Political consultant Bob Robb said Mecham is the candidate who
will suffer the least from a lack of contributions.
   ``Mecham has all the support he's going to get,'' Robb said.
``People have already made up their minds about him, one way or the
other.''
   Mecham also is closely identified with many of this year's key
issues _ including the Martin Luther King holiday, taxes and voter
dissatisfaction with government.
   Mecham has campaigned actively against the King holiday, passed
by the Legislature this year. He spearheaded the referendum drive
to place the holiday on the November ballot, and could cash in at
the polls on a strong anti-holiday sentiment among Republicans.
   The King holiday has become a partisan issue, with Republicans
generally opposing it and Democrats in support, Merrill said.
   Mecham's campaign also got a boost when the Legislature passed a
$265 million tax increase at a time when the state's economy
already was suffering, analysts say.
   ``I have never seen so much dissatisfaction with incumbents,
with government,'' Merrill said. ``I have never seen an
anti-incumbent feeling as high as it is this year.''
   Mecham's best shot at winning the primary is for voter turnout
to be low, pollsters say.
   Merrill said a generally lackluster campaign almost ensures that
most voters will stay at home.
   ``It's not unfair to say that none of the candidates has
captured the imagination of the voters,'' he said.
   Hill agreed that a low voter turnout would favor Mecham, who
appears to have the most solid core of support of any of the
candidates.
   ``Mecham's base makes him real tough,'' Hill said. ``If he is
able to hold onto those people he'll be hard to beat if there's no
turnout.''

<HEAD>People Talking About Saving Oil, But Not Much Action Yet</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mideast crisis has people talking about
conservation again. But few are actually doing anything about it.
   Phone lines started ringing at energy conservation advice lines
right after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, as consumers fearing
higher prices sought tips to cut their consumption.
   In Minneapolis, the Metropolitan Transit Commission used Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's picture and the slogan ``Stop pumping
him up,'' in an advertising campaign to suggest that people use
city buses rather than their cars.
   So far, however, little suggests people are driving less,
investing in more efficient home heating or following the Bush
administration's cautious suggestions for gasoline savings.
   ``They aren't feeling the pinch as they did in the 1970s,'' said
Mary Ann Dittmer, director of communications for the
Washington-based Alliance to Save Energy. ``They aren't standing in
line for gasoline. Prices for home heating oil haven't gone through
the roof.''
   Nonetheless, she said, ``We have received many phone calls from
consumers who want to do something.''
   Callers are sent brochures telling how better light bulbs,
programmable thermostats, special windows and high-efficiency
burners can save money and help reduce imports of foreign oil.
   The Energy Department said calls to its toll-free energy-saving
tips line went from about 500 a week to 1,200 a day immediately
after the invasion.
   At the gas and electric utility Consolidated Edison in New York,
spokesman Marty Gitten said some callers are thinking about
converting from fuel oil to natural gas heat, as happened after the
oil shocks of the 1970s.
   ``We've had a surge in people interested in converting to gas
heating,'' he said. ``I can't say it's going to translate into
action.''
   The story is much the same at the gas pumps.
   ``I think about it, but I'm trimmed down to what I can to,''
said Gary Oddi of Reston, Va., after driving into a gas station in
Washington. ``My wife and I share a car.''
   ``I have a certain driving pattern and there's not a lot I can
do about it,'' said the next customer, William Leedy, as he pumped
gas into his car. ``I think I've got my automobile usage down as
low as it'll go.''
   In Minneapolis, bus revenues for the first two weeks in August
were about the same as last year's _ but officials said that was an
improvement, because revenues earlier had been falling.
   Last week, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins proposed steps to
boost U.S. oil production while asking drivers to trim their
gasoline use by joining car pools, obeying speed limits and keeping
their tires properly inflated.
   Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman at American Automobile Association
headquarters in Orlando, Fla., said regular nationwide checks show
no signs that drivers are cutting back to save on gasoline.
   ``The stations are telling us they do not see a change in the
sales pattern for this time of year,'' Sundstrom said. ``People
aren't panic buying, but at this point they don't seem to be
conserving, either.''
   Auto sales have dropped this month, but analysts say that's
because of general economic worries, not concern about gas guzzlers.
   ``People are not switching to smaller cars. There's no evidence
of that whatsoever,'' said Joel Pitcoff, manager of research and
analysis at Ford Motor Co.
   A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll published Thursday found
that 80 percent of those questioned said they favored ``tougher
conservation measures that would mean less gas consumption,'' but
it was not clear what steps would really be popular if enacted.
   The same poll found just 32 percent backing a higher gas tax to
encourage conservation, with 62 percent opposed and 6 percent not
sure.
   Secretary Watkins and President Bush have been careful not to
let any note of sacrifice enter their calls for conservation,
frustrating activists who want more vigorous steps.
   Bush told reporters Wednesday that now is a good time to
conserve energy, but he does not plan to give up using his
speedboat and doesn't think Americans should change their vacation
plans.
   ``I'd have to lay part of the blame on the administration for
not making conservation seem as urgent as it is,'' said Ms. Dittmer
of the Alliance to Save Energy.
   ``While the president finally used the words `energy
conservation' as U.S. troops were on their way to the Persian Gulf,
he has so far failed to propose any significant policies to reduce
dependence on oil,'' Christopher Flavin, an energy expert at
Worldwatch Institute, said at a news conference Thursday.

   Bill Cosby doesn't care for smart alecks like
Bart Simpson, and says the Huxtables are ready to take him on.
   Beginning this week, Fox TV moves its runaway hit, ``The
Simpsons,'' from Sunday nights to a Thursday night slot, pitting it
against NBC's hit ``The Cosby Show.''
   Cosby posed for the cover of Entertainment Weekly wearing a
T-shirt with Bart Simpson on it declaring, ``Yo, Bill!'' But he had
little praise for the animated series.
   ``The mean-spirited and cruel think this is `the edge,' and
their excuse is, that's the way people are today,'' Cosby said in
an interview being published next week. ``But why should we be
entertained by that? TV should be moving in a direction from the
Huxtables forward, not backward.''
   Cosby said he's been re-energizing ``The Cosby Show'' with nine
new writers, as a matter of principle.
   ``I'm working harder and enjoying it more. And whether the
audience is there in the numbers or not, I am proud of what we've
done,'' Cosby said.
   ``All of the changes were made B.B. _ Before Bart,'' he said.

   Roseanne Barr's former husband filed a
palimony lawsuit seeking at least $15 million from the comic and $3
million from her new husband, Tom Arnold.
   William Pentland's 14-year marriage to Miss Barr ended in
divorce in January. In a lawsuit filed Thursday in Superior Court,
Pentland claimed he is entitled to half her property as well as
support payments.
   ``When they started living together they had nothing,'' said
celebrated divorce lawyer Marvin Mitchelson, who represents
Pentland. ``They agreed to be lifetime companions, confidants and
share everything they have. We are trying to enforce that
agreement.''
   The lawsuit accused Arnold of undermining the marriage from
January 1979 by telling Miss Barr her husband was ``unreliable,
non-supportive and a detriment.''
   Miss Barr and Pentland, a writer, were married in 1975. Their
three teen-age children live with Miss Barr.
   A divorce and custody hearing was scheduled for Sept. 18.
   ``I really feel this lawsuit is specious and is just an
opportunity to get publicity,'' said Miss Barr's attorney, Arlene
Colman-Schwimmer.
   Miss Barr plays a sarcastic, overweight housewife on ABC-TV's
popular series ``Roseanne.''

   Tango composer and musician Astor
Piazzolla, flown home in a coma from a clinic in Paris, has
regained consciousness and may recover, his son said.
   ``Right now, my father is listening to a work by Bach,'' Daniel
Piazzolla was quoted Thursday as telling the newspaper La Nacion.
``He is conscious in every sense, and his recovery seems almost a
miracle.''
   Piazzolla, 69, is the country's best-known tango composer and a
master of the bandoleon, the Argentine accordion that forms the
instrumental basis for most tango music.
   He suffered a brain hemorrhage in early August while in Paris
between concerts in England and Italy and has been hospitalied

   Todd Bridges, who played Gary Coleman's
brother Willis on NBC's ``Diff'rent Strokes'' for eight years, has
been acquitted of assault in the shooting of a narcotics dealer at
a drug den.
   It was the second trial clearing the actor of criminal charges.
   ``I feel a lot of relief that it's over,'' Bridges said shortly
after the Superior Court jury announced its verdict Thursday.
   Bridges was retried in the February 1989 shooting of convicted
drug dealer Kenneth ``Tex'' Clay at a Los Angeles drug house. Clay
recovered from gunshot wounds to his arms and chest.
   In the first trial, jurors acquitted Bridges of attempted murder
but deadlocked on the charge of assault with a deadly weapon.
Prosecutors retried him on the assault charge.
   Deputy District Attorney William Hodgman contended that Bridges
shot Clay because he allegedly stole the actor's BMW. But defense
attorney Johnnie Cochran argued his client was in the middle of a
four-day cocaine binge during the attack at the drug den, and that
someone else shot Clay.

   Lionel Aldridge, a former pro football player
who suffered mental health problems and became a drifter, led a
rally to raise funds for the mentally ill.
   Aldridge, 49, a defensive end for the Green Bay Packers from
1963 to 1971, marched Thursday with about two dozen other
self-described ``mental health consumers'' to the office of
Milwaukee County Executive Dave Schulz.
   The group sang Schulz a song to the tune of Bob Dylan's hit
``Blowin' In The Wind,'' describing the need to keep $200,000 in
the 1991 county budget for a program to support those recovering
from mental illness.
   Aldridge entered a psychiatric emergency ward in 1977 after his
wife sued for divorce and underwent treatment for severe
depression. He started drifting around the country in 1980, and
ended up living among the down-and-out at the Milwaukee Rescue
Mission.
   By 1985, however, he got a job at the Milwaukee post office, and
later worked part-time as a radio sportscaster. He was inducted
into the Packer Hall of Fame in 1988, and now spends his time
speaking on behalf of the mentally ill.

   Typhoon Yancy has killed at least 105 people this
week in coastal China, an official report said today.
   Heavy rains and flooding were blamed for the deaths in Fujian
and Zhejiang provinces, the China Daily said. It said the typhoon
was the most devastating storm to batter the two provinces, which
have been hit several major storms this summer.
   The typhoon, which killed 13 people in Taiwan early in the week
before heading for China, hit the Fujian coast three times in 24
hours Tuesday and Wednesday, previous reports said.
   More than 530 million people in the two provinces were directly
affected by the storm, with economic losses estimated at $170
million, the China Daily said.
   In the Zhejiang city of Wenzhou alone, 61 people died and 264
were injured, it said. The report did not give details about the
remaining deaths.
   In the two provinces, 494,000 acres of farmland have been
flooded by heavy rains that in some areas topped 22 inches. An
earlier report said the flooding would reduce Fujian's grain output
this year by about 100 million pounds.

   More police need to be trained to detect drugs
other than alcohol when they pull over suspicious drivers, but some
state laws prevent such tests, the nation's top highway safety
official says.
   Jerry R. Curry, head of the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, said 26 communities in 10 states have police
trained to spot both drugged and drunken drivers.
   But he said officers in 15 states and Puerto Rico may not be
trained for drug detection because their laws either do not allow
more than one chemical test or forbid testing for drugs other than
alcohol when a driver is stopped on the highway.
   ``We encourage these states to change their laws during the next
legislative cycle,'' Curry said in a statement released this week
by his office. ``Drug-impaired drivers, like drunk drivers, cause
crashes, injuries and deaths on our highways.''
   Curry said studies indicate that 10 percent to 22 percent of all
drivers in serious and fatal crashes have drugs other than alcohol
in their systems, and many have alcohol as well as other drugs.
Alcohol use has been found in accidents accounting for about half
of the 45,000 annual traffic fatalities.
   Curry said that wherever possible, the federal government has
been helping train police to test accurately for other drugs and
present the evidence in court.
   More than 1,000 police officers have been trained in the
communities, he said, with one-fourth of them certified to teach
other officers.
   Officers trained in drug detection look for physical clues in
suspects to determine which drug they have taken, Curry said,
including analysis of the suspect's appearance, behavior,
performance in physical tests, eyes and vital signs.
   Officers undergo a training course that consists of seven days
of classroom study, followed by drug examination on people arrested
on suspicion of drug impairment, he said.
   States that have communities where officers have received the
training are Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, New
York, Nevada, Texas, Utah and Virginia.
   States that have laws which would not allow for drug-detection
training are Alabama, Alaska, Connecticut, Hawaii, Kentucky,
Massachusetts, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, North Carolina,
Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Washington and West Virginia.

   Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat, like
his boss Saddam Hussein, is very much on the defensive these days.
   The U.S.-educated diplomat, until recently one of the faceless
legions of foreign representatives who swim unobtrusively in
Washington's diplomatic backwaters, has been much in evidence as
the world vilifies Iraq for one alleged transgression after another.
   In television appearances, letters to newspapers and embassy
news conferences, the graying, mustachioed al-Mashat vigorously
defends Iraqi policy. But ABC-TV newswoman Barbara Walters told The
Washington Post after she interviewed al-Mashat that he dodged her
questions.
   ``This ambassador obviously knows nothing,'' Walters said.
   Al-Mashat turns aside allegations that Iraq is violating
international norms, most recently with Baghdad's announcement that
Westerners will suffer alongside Iraqis if the U.N.-sanctioned
economic embargo persists.
   ``When you deny our children food and milk, what do you
expect?'' al-Mashat said Sunday in an assertive, sometimes
bellicose interview on ABC-TV.
   Al-Mashat, ambassador to the United States since last September,
said recently in Dossier magazine that his priority was to reverse
``a tide of unflattering press reports'' about his country.
   In a letter to The Washington Post last month, he said a July 5
op-ed piece on Iraq ``bordered upon irresponsible and dishonest
journalism.''
   He said Iraq's policy was one of deterrence in the face of many
enemies, and that Baghdad was seeking only peace after a
protracted, destructive war with Iran.
   He denied that Iraq had used poison gas on its Kurdish
population and labeled as ``a cheap shot'' the Post writer's
assertion that Iraq was giving office space to terrorist Abu Nidal.
   In a May 4 opinion piece in The New York Times, al-Mashat said
``many lies have been told about Iraq.''
   He said Iraq does not have or intend to produce nuclear weapons
and that Saddam ``has proposed the elimination of production,
storage and use of all instruments of mass destruction _
specifically, a ban on all chemical, biological and nuclear
weapons'' in the Middle East.
   Al-Mashat, 59, is a former ambassador to the United Kingdom,
France and Austria. He also has held high-level posts in education
and scientific research in his country. He was a professor of
sociology at Baghdad University.
   He received a bachelor's and masters' degree in criminology at
the University of California at Berkeley and a Ph.D. in sociology
from the University of Maryland.

<TEXT>
   Joe Wilson has built a career on hardship
posts, but nothing compares with his current job as America's top
diplomat in Baghdad.
   Joseph C. Wilson IV, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy
in Iraq, is Washington's ranking diplomat in Baghdad. He is the man
who every day must confront Iraqi officials to tell them that Iraq
must withdraw from Kuwait and release the 3,000 Americans held
hostage in Iraq and Kuwait.
   With Ambassador April Glaspie out of the country, it was Wilson
who went face-to-face with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for two
hours on Aug. 6, demanding that the safety of Americans be
guaranteed and listening to Saddam's steely warnings against U.S.
intervention.
   He has been out on the streets talking to and tracking down
Americans, and is a frequent visitor to the Iraqi Foreign Ministry,
where his appeals for access to Americans have been spurned.
   It's a heady task for the 40-year-old career diplomat, who once
worked as a carpenter and served mainly in African backwaters
before going to Iraq.
   President Bush, for one, believes Wilson has the right stuff.
``We've got a very able person there in Baghdad who is prepared to
talk,'' Bush said at a Wednesday news conference. If the Iraqis
want to open discussions on ending the crisis, ``well, there he is,
available to talk.''
   ``He can handle himself quite well in a crisis,'' said Jack
Bryant, deputy executive director of the State Department Bureau of
African Affairs and Wilson's longtime colleague. ``He can deal with
anyone,'' including Saddam, Bryant said. ``Joe could go in and be
very forceful.''
   Wilson worked for a time as a carpenter in northern California
after graduating from the University of California in 1972, Bryant
said. He joined the Foreign Service in 1976 and was assigned to the
French-speaking Africa desk because of his fluency in French. As a
boy he had lived four years in France, when his father was a
freelance reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle and other
newspapers.
   Bryant said Wilson's first big assignment was doing the
groundwork for Secretary of State Henry Kissinger's first African
tour in the late 1970s.
   He was posted in turn to Niger, Togo and South Africa, and in
1982 became deputy chief of mission, or DCM, in the tiny central
African state of Burundi. It was there he met his second wife, a
French citizen friends say was of Vietnamese descent.
   In 1986 Wilson was appointed DCM in The Congo, a post he held
until taking his first non-African position, as second-in-charge in
Baghdad, in 1988.
   One foreign service colleague, who asked that his name not be
used, said Wilson's lack of training in Middle East affairs should
not affect his performance in the current crisis.
   ``He's very bright, very energetic. As a generalist he has a
broad scope of things he has to take care of. He's certainly
capable of standing up to Saddam Hussein to make any message, and
he would do it unflinchingly.''
   The foreign service officer said Wilson ``liked the challenge of
a hardship environment. When you go to an African post you have
more responsibility and Joe liked being a generalist.''
   Another diplomat who worked with Wilson in The Congo said Wilson
was ``a damned good DCM. He's an expert at managing the embassy
inside while keeping contacts outside _ that's the kind of guy you
want in this spot.''
   Wilson's wife returned to her family in France soon after Iraq's
invasion. His mother, Phyllis Wilson of the Palm Springs area, said
she was able to talk to her son this week and ``he sounded great.
He's in good spirits.''

   Almost three years to the day since he arrived
in Kuwait, Ambassador Nathaniel Howell, described by a State
Department spokesman as ``captain of the ship,'' is prepared to
stay with it as it sinks.
   The career Foreign Service officer elected to remain in his
embassy to await today's expected arrival of Iraqi troops whose
government says Kuwait has vanished along with the invisible shield
that protected the diplomats there.
   But first Howell saw to the safe departure of most of the
embassy staff in a 33-car caravan that took them from Kuwait City
to Baghdad, Iraq.
   He then returned to wait.
   ``He's captain of the ship,'' State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said Thursday.
   Howell, 50, has spent nearly half of his life in the Foreign
Service, serving in Egypt, France, Belgium, Lebanon, Jordan, the
United Arab Emirates and Algeria. He is married, the father of two
and is a native of Virginia.
   He speaks Arabic.
   When he arrived in Kuwait on Aug. 25, 1987, U.S. warships were
escorting that country's oil tankers through the Persian Gulf to
protect them from attack by Iran, which was at war with Iraq.
   The following year, Howell was summoned to the Kuwaiti Foreign
Ministry to listen to that government's complaints about U.S.
policies, once over the refusal to allow Palestine Liberation
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat into the United States and
another time to express ``extreme concern'' over American
allegations that Iraq had used chemical weapons.
   ``Kuwait regrets the way the American media exploited such
allegations to launch a campaign against Iraq at a time when
neutral parties ... announced they did not find evidence that Iraq
has used chemical weapons,'' Kuwait's Foreign Ministry said at the
time.
   The Kuwaitis were worried that this would damage chances for
peace between Iran and Iraq.

<HEAD>US Farm Imports to Reach Record Levels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States imported record levels of
farm goods in the first half of this year but also increased its
share of sales on the world market, the Agriculture Department says.
   Imports rose 6 percent at $13.5 billion to break a record set
last year. The Agriculture Department predicts that purchases from
foreign countries will reach $22 billion before the year is over,
topping the record set last year of $21.5 billion.
   The freeze in the United States last winter was a big factor in
increased imports. It drove up the average import unit values for
fresh vegetables by 37 percent through April, said USDA.
   ``Tomato import unit values alone doubled in the first half of
fiscal 1990,'' the department said. ``Fruit imports rose 10 percent
in the first 7 months and will probably maintain that pace for the
entire fiscal year, primarily due to higher orange juice imports.''
   The Agriculture Department said beef imports from Australia were
stronger than anticipated because of dry weather there, high prices
in the United States and frozen beef storage problems in Japan.
   Other large quantity imports included live cattle from Canada
and Mexico.
   On the other hand, more overseas sales of cotton, corn and
vegetables offset decreases in wheat, soybeans, soybean meal,
animals and dairy products to raise total exports to $25.2 billion
during the first seven months of fiscal 1990, a 3 percent increase
over the comparable period in 1989.
   ``U.S. export volume rose largely because of an increased U.S.
share of world markets, rather than an increase in world demand,''
said USDA. ``China, Thailand, Argentina and Canada all relinquished
market share to the United States, leaving what was likely the
second largest U.S. share of world corn trade ever.''
   Japan, America's best customer for the last three years, bought
21 percent of the agriculture products exported in 1989, USDA
reported.
   ``Japan's 1989 purchases were more than double the value shipped
to the Soviet Union, the second leading importer of U.S. farm
products,'' it said.
   Japan spent more than $250 million on each of the following
commodities: live animals and meat, feed grains, soybeans, fruits,
cotton, wheat, hides and skins, feeds and fodders, vegetables and
tobacco.
   The other top markets for U.S. farm products, in order, are
Mexico, South Korea, Canada, The Netherlands, Taiwan and China.

   The potato leafhopper, which attacks crops
from the Northeast through the Corn Belt, has an enemy that may
eventually be a cheaper way for farmers to destroy it than chemical
pesticides.
   Zoophthora radicans, a fungus imported from Europe and South
America, can kill the leafhopper in three to four days, according
to entomologist Raymond Carruthers of the Agriculture Department's
research service.
   The fungus spews spores that fall onto leafhoppers and also
sticks to leaf surfaces where the pests might cross.
   ``Leafhoppers attack more than 200 crops, including potatoes and

probably apply more insecticides to control potato leafhoppers than
any other pest in alfalfa.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Agriculture Department is authorizing
construction of three telescopes on Arizona's Mt. Graham in the
Coronado National Forest as long as the habitat of the endangered
Mt. Graham red squirrel is not disrupted significantly.
   ``As a practical matter, this means that the project would be
halted and consultation re-initiated if the project resulted in
more than six squirrels being harmed in any year,'' said George M.
Leonard, associate chief of the U.S. Forest Service.
   The University of Arizona proposed construction of the
telescopes in 1984. The university said the project would
significantly advance the state of astronomical science.
   Sponsors of the observatory include the Smithsonian Institution,
the Vatican and the Max Planck Institute of West Germany.
   Leonard said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will monitor and
report on the effect of construction on the squirrel population. He
said a buffer zone around the observatory site would carry special
restrictions.

<HEAD>Draft Registration Jumps After U.S. Forces Sent to Middle East</HEAD>

   Draft registration jumped to 29 percent above
average after U.S. forces were sent to Saudi Arabia, but there are
no plans to restart the military draft because of the Persian Gulf
crisis, the Selective Service says.
   Lew Brodsky, assistant director for public affairs at the
Selective Service System, said 36,485 draft-eligible young men
signed up during the week of Aug. 13-17, compared with a weekly
average of 28,289 in the preceding 12 months.
   Brodsky said Selective Service officials assumed that the U.S.
response to Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait made young people more
aware of the registration requirement.
   ``They may have thought that if a draft might be imminent they
would want to get their names on the books,'' Brodsky said Thursday.
   However, he said, there are no plans to seek congressional
approval for a draft, and there have been no discussions about it
with the White House, the Defense Department or members of Congress.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., has introduced a bill in most
recent sessions of Congress to reinstate the draft, saying the
present volunteer system puts the burden of military service
unfairly on blacks and other minorities.
   John Patterson, Hollings' press secretary, said Hollings has not
reintroduced the bill in this session and ``we have not talked
about it in light of what just happened.'' Hollings was in South
Carolina and not available, Patterson said.
   The last U.S. military draft ended in 1973. Under current law,
men have to register when they reach 18, but it would take action
by Congress before they could be drafted.
   Pentagon leaders have said in recent years that they do not
favor a return to the draft and have told Congress they believe the
nation can continue to attract enough recruits to avoid one.
   Samuel Lessey, director of Selective Service, told the Senate
Armed Services Committee in 1987 that the aim of the service was to
be able to produce the first inductee within 13 days _ and 100,000
within 30 days _ if a draft were instituted.
   He said 14 million to 15 million men were registered, about 96
or 97 percent of the total number eligible.
   Rep. Peter Defazio, D-Ore., introduced a bill in May to end
draft registration, saying the need for it had been eliminated by
the wave of democracy spreading through the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe. Neither DeFazio nor his spokesman could be reached
Thursday.

   Oxygen tanks, respirators and
intravenous tubes share cabin space with sleeping bags and
backpacks at S.K.I.P Camp, a retreat for children whose medical
needs make them dependent on technology.
   ``They're doing things they thought they would never do,'' said
Susan Spielman of Bloomington, whose 8-year-old daughter, Maren,
prepared to go water skiing on Wednesday.
   The girl undertook the adventure although she suffers from
central sleep apnea, a condition that requires she have a
tracheostomy, or a permanent opening in her neck, so she can be
connected to a respirator while she sleeps.
   The opening was covered and secured with a thick white towel for
the water-skiing outing.
   The camp is a project of Sick Kids need Involved People, a New
York-based national organization. In its fourth year, S.K.I.P. Camp
offers children and their families a chance to break routines that
often keep them sheltered from outdoor activities.
   ``So many of these kids were prisoners in their homes or
hospitals,'' said camp director Barbara Donaghy, who volunteers her
time along with the other 50 medical and 75 non-medical staffers
running the one-week camp. Eighteen children from around the nation
attended this year.
   Donaghy, a registered nurse and respiratory therapist, said the
idea behind the camp is to balance improved technology with similar
steps toward bettering patients' quality of life.
   ``Most of these kids would not have lived 10 years ago,'' she
said. ``There's more and more technology. But we don't always
follow through with other things.''
   S.K.I.P Camp is unique because it involves entire families,
doesn't focus on a specific disease and is run at no cost to
campers, Donaghy said. The annual budget of about $50,000 is funded
by donations and volunteer efforts.
   The 24-hour medical staff reassures parents that their
children's needs will be met, despite the camp's rustic atmosphere.
Families share living quarters in cabins where sophisticated
machines hum alongside spartan bunk beds.
   At mealtimes, the campers, families and volunteers gather in a
large dining hall. Youngsters whose medical conditions require they
be fed intravenously sit next to others who chomp on peanut butter
sandwiches, Jell-O and other camp fare.
   Betty Pankratz of Wichita, Kan., said the camp is giving new
confidence to her 10-year-old son, Scott, who was born with a
malfunction of his trachea and esophagus that requires he have a
tracheostomy, receive oxygen and have supplemental feedings through
a tube in his stomach.
   ``He fits right in,'' said Pankratz, whose husband, Glen, and
6-year-old son, Phillip, also attended the camp. ``It doesn't seem
unusual for him to have to leave the group to take meds.''
   ``It's a lot of fun, and I'm meeting people that I like,'' said
Scott, who tried horseback riding, swimming, boating and other
outdoor activities. ``I know I wouldn't be doing this stuff at home.
   ``There's really nothing to be afraid of,'' he said.
   Donaghy, who helped found S.K.I.P Camp in the Miami area four
years ago, said she hopes the camp will let technology-dependent
children focus on their abilities instead of their disabilities.
   Most of the campers' medical problems will continue throughout
their lifetimes, but the camp experiences can show them how to
overcome limitations.
   ``It doesn't have to stop your life,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Workers excavating storage tanks at a uranium
processing plant found levels of radioactive uranium in underground
water as much as 35,000 times higher than federal safety standards
allow, officials said Thursday.
   Sequoyah Fuels Corp. Vice President Ron Adkisson said there was
no danger to the public because the contamination was contained
inside the plant's restricted area.
   None of the company's 243 workers were exposed to radiation, he
said, and no evacuations were ordered at the plant, which is 60
miles southeast of Tulsa in a sparsely populated area.
   ``There's been no exposure to personnel,'' he said. ``There is
no off-site danger.''
   The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commision is investigating the
discovery.
   Adkisson said workers discovered the contaminated water
Wednesday, while the plant was in its annual shutdown for
maintenance. Some of the water samples ranged from 1 to 8 grams of
uranium per liter.
   Guidelines set by the NRC allow no more than 225 micrograms of
uranium per liter. A gram contains 1 million micrograms.
   Adkisson said he didn't know when the company could reopen the
factory, which refines uranium to be made into fuel rods for
nuclear reactors.
   Plant officials believe the uranium leaked years ago from the
solvent extraction building, where pure uranium is dissolved using
an acid solvent.
   An acid-resistant floor installed in the building in 1984 would
have prevented such leaks, Adkisson said.
   ``In some years past, very early in the operation, the material
apparently ate through the floor and got through the
substructure,'' Adkisson said. ``We discovered it yesterday.''
   The NRC was notified the same day and sent an investigator from
its Arlington, Texas office, he said.
   ``They have a fellow out right now. He's just trying to figure
out what's going on, trying to assess best he can, just like us.''
   Sequoyah Fuels is owned by General Atomics of San Diego, which
bought the plant from Kerr-McGee Corp. in 1988.
   In January, as many as 20,000 pounds of uranium tetrafluoride
powder spilled at the plant after a valve failed and the powder was
dumped into a too-small container.
   A small amount of the powder was released into the air through a
ventilator, and one worker underwent hospital testing.
   The company suspended operations but did not notify the NRC
until the following day, drawing criticism from Democratic U.S.
Rep. Mike Synar, whose district includes the plant.
   In 1986, an accident killed one man who inhaled toxic fumes
after an overfilled cylinder of uranium hexafluoride exploded.
Thirty-five of 42 workers at the plant suffered kidney damage, and
100 people living or traveling near the plant required medical
treatment. The plant was closed nearly a year.

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy in Kuwait: Functional, Not Fancy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait _ the latest storm
center of the growing Persian Gulf crisis _ is recalled by
diplomats who served there as a cluster of modest buildings across
a six-lane highway from the beach.
   It normally has a contingent of about a half-dozen Marines, who
were withdrawn Thursday as today's Iraqi-set deadline for the
closing of foreign embassies in Kuwait approached.
   ``It's not a very fancy embassy, but a very functional one,''
said Francois Dickman, a retired Foreign Service officer who was
U.S. ambassador to Kuwait from 1979 to 1983.
   ``It's not one of the new fortresses that many American
embassies around the world are increasingly,'' said another
diplomat who has served in Kuwait, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   Dickman, speaking by telephone from his home in Laramie, Wyo.,
said the embassy is in a compound surrounded by a wall eight or
nine feet high.
   It is a rectangle running north and south with the east side
facing Gulf Road, a six-lane highway. Just east of the highway is
the Persian Gulf.
   ``It's not much of a beach,'' said Dickman.
   The compound is roughly two city blocks wide by four blocks
long, the former ambassador said. Directly to the south is a Hilton
hotel, seven or eight stories high.
   The only entrance to the compound is a steel gate on the west
side, about 100 feet from the southwest corner.
   ``As you enter, you see the chancery,'' he said. ``The chancery
is one story. It was a plain stone building with a corrugated
roof.''
   Dickman said the road then bends north to the site of the
administration building, a brick structure that was destroyed in a
terrorist bombing on Dec. 12, 1983. The building has since been
rebuilt.
   Also in the compound are the two-story ambassador's residence, a
warehouse, a parking lot and a garden just east of the ambassador's
house, in which vegetables were grown in Dickman's day.
   There also is a swimming pool.
   In the 1983 bombing, Shia Moslem terrorists crashed a truck
loaded with gas cylinders through the steel gates. It smashed into
the administration building, demolishing it and also damaging the
chancery and warehouse, Dickman said. Six people were killed,
including the truck driver, but none were Americans.
   Since then the security system has been strengthened, according
to the diplomat who spoke anonymously.
   ``I suppose a tank, like an Iraqi tank, could get through, but
it has been reinforced, the wall has been upgraded and the entry
gates,'' this diplomat said.
   Dickman said that when he was ambassador the Marines lived a
block away from the embassy compound, but he later heard they were
living within the enclosure. He applauded the decision to withdraw
them.
   ``It makes sense,'' he said. ``These Marines can't do anything.
There are only six of them. It is possible the number has been
increased, but normally it is only a contingent of six.''
   ``They don't really serve as guards,'' Dickman said. ``They man
the entrance to the chancery and in the evening they make sure that
things are locked up and provide elementary security.''
   The diplomats obviously had pleasant memories of the place.
   ``The time I was there we had a little victory garden along the
edge of the wall,'' said Dickman.
   ``I remember it being very green and pretty,'' said his
colleague.

   Israelies are stocking up on emergency supplies
including baking soda _ an antidote to chemical weapons _ while
government broadcasts urge citizens to prepare for a possible Iraqi
chemical attack.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Thursday the Persian Gulf
crisis is ``mounting toward a peak'' and caused a minor flurry when
he appeared to hint a preemptive Israeli strike against Iraq was
possible.
   When questioned, however, he said Israel had no such intentions.
   In the government's first public response to Israelis' growing
fear of war, a top civil defense officer urged Israelis to
stockpile food and prepare their homes for a possible Iraqi
chemical attack.
   Later, the government put out an announcement saying the radio
and television statements weren't intended as orders to citizens,
but as general advice.
   The announcement described how to mix a homemade antidote to
chemical weapons. Newspapers published advice on how to seal a home
against chemical attack with tape and how to rig a makeshift gas
mask using a handkerchief or towel soaked with water and baking
soda.
   At the Supersol supermarket in downtown Jerusalem, baking soda
was sold out Thursday, and shop workers said they were selling four
or five times more baking soda than usual.
   At Houminer's hardware store in Jerusalem, manager Avraham Yosha
reported a 40 percent increase in the sale of insulating tape,
emergency lights, cans for water, as well as portable toilets and
wash basins for shelters and sealed rooms.
   Addressing visiting American contributors to the United Jewish
Appeal at the Parliament, Shamir said: ``In the circumstances, our
major task is to prevent war, or to preempt it and if, heaven
forbid, these two fail, and there is no alternative, we have to win
quickly and decisively.''
   But speaking later to reporters, Shamir qualified those remarks,
saying Israel's aim was still ``to prevent any military involvement
of our country'' in spite of Iraq's attempts to drag it into the
three-week-old crisis.
   Asked specifically whether Israel planned a preemptive strike in
the aftermath of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, Shamir said:
``No, not at all.''
   But in his speech, Shamir said Israel must be on alert in view
of developments in the region. He said the crisis in the Persian
Gulf, ``is mounting toward a peak.''
   ``We are ready for any development that may take place. There
are factors in the region that would like to draw us into an armed
conflict. We need strong nerves, patience and a high state of
readiness,'' Shamir said.

<HEAD>Keating, Associates Looted Lincoln S&amp;L of Millions, Judge Says</HEAD>

   All he wanted, Phoenix financier Charles H.
Keating Jr. said, was a day in court to tell his side of how his
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association came to represent the epitome of
the quarter-trillion-dollar S&amp;L debacle.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin gave Keating his day _ in
fact more than 30 days of hearings _ and then ruled Thursday that
Keating and his associates used a ``dishonest scheme'' to loot
Lincoln for tens of millions of dollars in federally insured
deposits.
   ``Bluntly speaking, their actions amounted to a looting of
Lincoln,'' said Sporkin, an accountant by training and formerly the
top enforcement officer at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
``This was not done crudely. Indeed, it was done with a great deal
of sophistication.''
   Dismissing Keating's suit to recover the collapsed Irvine,
Calif., thrift, Sporkin said it was ``abundantly clear'' that
Keating and other officials of Lincoln's holding company, American
Continental Corp. of Phoenix, ``abused their positions.''
   It was the second legal setback in two days for Keating, who
complained he was being made a scapegoat for the S&amp;L crisis because
of his $1.3 million in campaign gifts to five senators who
intervened on his behalf with federal thrift regulators in 1987.
   A federal judge in California said Wednesday that Keating must
prove he's broke, may not send any money out of the country and
must give 48 hours notice before spending more than $5,000.
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision sought that action as
part of an effort to recover $40.9 million from Keating and five
associates in connection with three soured business deals at
Lincoln.
   Bradley Boland, a spokesman for American Continental and a
son-in-law of Keating, said in response to Sporkin's ruling that
the company ``is reviewing all of its options and has no comment at
this time.''
   Keating had indicated earlier that he would appeal a negative
decision. ``We'll be fighting to the day I'm dead,'' he told
reporters in June. ``I have no intention of being raped by the U.S.
government.''
   Timothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision that
last year succeeded the Federal Home Loan Bank Board as the S&amp;L
industry's chief regulator, called the ruling ``an extremely
important decision.''
   ``As the courts are now confirming,'' Ryan said, ``OTS has the
authority to see that those who have abused the savings and loan
system and the American taxpayer will not be permitted to do so
again. And they will not be permitted to retain one cent of their
ill-gotten gains.''
   Regulators have estimated that Keating's use of Lincoln's
federally insured deposits to finance various junk bond, stock and
real estate ventures and the institution's subsequent collapse
could cost taxpayers as much as $2 billion.
   The government already has spent $1.2 billion keeping Lincoln
and its more than 20 branches in Southern California afloat,
according to lawyers in the case. The government also has a $1.3
billion civil fraud and racketeering suit pending against Keating.
   ``This is a saga that demonstrates the excesses of a
misconceived and misapplied regulatory program along with a group
of individuals who were bent on exploiting these excesses,''
Sporkin said in his 51-page ruling Thursday.
   But the judge also blamed the ``literally scores of accountants
and lawyers'' that Keating ``surrounded himself with'' to give an
``aura of legality'' to transactions that regulators claim were
fraudulent.
   ``While we in this nation have been trying to place blame for
the savings and loan crisis on the various governmental
participants ... this court believes far too little has been
focused on the private sector,'' Sporkin said.
   Five senators now being investigated by the Senate Ethics
Committee have cited the audits by the accounting firm of Arthur
Young &amp; Co. and a favorable report by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan as reasons for interceding on Keating's behalf.
   The five _ Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John
McCain, R-Ariz., have denied any wrongdoing.

<HEAD>Researchers Prove Normal Gene Can Suppress Cancer Growth In
Laboratory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers say they have isolated a normal
gene that can prevent test-tube colonies of cancer tumors from
growing.
   The experiment with a gene called p53 could lead to finding
natural proteins to switch off cancer. The results of the research
at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore appear today in
the journal Science.
   ``They have reached the genetic root of the problem of
malignancy,'' said Dr. John S. Macdonald, director of the Temple
University Cancer Center in Philadelphia.
   ``The observation that you change the growth properties (of
cancer cells) by inserting the normal gene is significant,'' said
Dr. Berton Zbar, a National Cancer Institute scientist.
   P53 is one of a group of what is known as suppressor genes
because they appear to act as a brake on cancer formation, said
Suzanne Baker, a Hopkins cancer researcher. Suppressor genes have
been found to be either missing or mutated in the cells of several
types of solid cancer tumors, she said.
   ``What we assume is the fact that a normal copy of the p53 gene
missing in these cells is important in the formation of the
cancer,'' she said.
   Baker said inserting the normal p53 seems to reestablish the
normal regulation of cell proliferation. The unregulated division
of cells is a primary characteristic of cancer.
   Researchers at Hopkins and at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland also put the p53 into benign colon tumors and found that
these tumors, which have the gene, were not affected. The
researchers additionally put a mutated p53 gene into colonies of
colon cancer cells and found that the abnormal gene did not
suppress the cell growth.
   These experiments, said Baker, verified that the action of the
normal gene prevented the cancer from growing.
   Zbar and Macdonald said that p53 is missing or mutated in a
several types of cancer _ including brain, bone, breast and adrenal
carcinoma _ and that the Hopkins study may also apply to those
cancers.
   Other researchers, also working with laboratory cultures, proved
earlier that restoring other suppressor genes can block growth of
cancers of the eye and of the kidney. But the Hopkins study is the
first to demonstrate the effect of a suppressor gene on one of the
major cancer killers.
   Colon cancer, which kills about 60,000 people annually in the
United States, is second in mortality to lung cancer.
   Baker cautioned that despite the success of the laboratory
experiment, it does not prove that colon cancer can be treated by
inserting a normal gene into a patient. This may never be possible,
a Hopkins statement said.
   But Baker said that if the action of the suppressor gene can be
understood, then researchers could develop an agent, such as a
protein, that mimics the work of p53 and stops cancer growth. Baker
said the Hopkins team is now studying the mechanism of the
suppressor gene.
   Coauthors of the study with Baker were Eric R. Fearon and Bert
Vogelstein of Hopkins, and Sanford Markowitz and James K. V.
Willson of Case Western Reserve.
   Science, which published the study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Studies Fail to Resolve Debate Over Milk Hormone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two scientific reports this week conclude that
cows treated with an experimental synthetic hormone yield higher
volumes of milk that is as safe as ordinary milk.
   But Food and Drug Administration officials say it will take at
least until next spring to determine if the treatment is safe for
the cows, and critics remain unconvinced the genetically-engineered
hormone is safe at all.
   If the FDA approves the hormone, bovine somatotropin, or bST, it
would become the first biotechnology product on the agriculture
market.
   ``There are a lot of unanswered questions,'' Jeremy Rifkin,
president of the Foundation on Economic Trends and a biotechnology
critic, said Thursday. ``The public deserves to have a thorough
study of all this and not a rush to judgment, and that's what the
FDA is trying to do.''
   FDA scientists, in an article in this week's edition of the
journal Science, laid out the evidence it believes shows that milk
and meat from dairy cows treated with the hormone are safe for
human consumption.
   Rifkin criticized the FDA for using old studies that tested with
natural bST rather than the synthetic hormone.
   The FDA's submission of the report to the journal for review by
an expert panel of scientists was unusual, since the agency as a
rule does not tip its hand publicly on products before they are
approved.
   The FDA's action was ``a response to congressional and public
interest'' over the safety of bST, said FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
   Some consumer activists say long-term effects of the bST are
still not known, and farmers worry that consumers might shy away
from products from treated cows.
   Farmers also are concerned that increased milk production would
lower prices.
   But Nesbit said: ``Whether bST will hurt small farmers ... does
not fall within (the FDA's) regulatory scope. We only look at the
safety and efficacy of a drug, not the economics of it.''
   Earlier this week, the Journal of the American Medical
Association published the work of two researchers who concluded
that bST can boost milk production in dairy cows by 10 percent to
25 percent while causing no significant changes in composition of
the milk.
   Rifkin said that report was ``shameful'' because the authors are
consultants to Monsanto Agriculture Co., one of the companies
making bST.
   JAMA also published an editorial by an independent researcher
backing the conclusions.
   Besides Monsanto, the FDA has allowed three other companies _
Eli Lilly Co., Upjohn Co. and American Cyanamid _ to conduct
limited farm tests of their products and to sell the milk from the
test cows.

   A stagnating U.S. economy that has survived
many close calls to expand for a peacetime record of nearly eight
years may receive its crippling blow from the Middle East, analysts
fear.
   Regardless of whether regional hostilities escalate, many
analysts predict an economic downturn is imminent because of the
runup in oil prices that has already occurred since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   More information on the economy will be known today when the
government releases a revised look at the broadest measure of
economic health _ the gross national product.
   A month ago, the Commerce Department said the GNP grew at a
lackluster annual rate of just 1.2 percent in the April-June
quarter. In advance of today's report, many analysts believe that
estimate would be revised upward, but only slightly to perhaps 1.4
percent, based on a modest improvement in the country's trade
performance.
   However, analysts said an upward revision would not change their
basic feeling that the U.S. economy has ground to a near standstill
and could well topple into a recession before the year is out.
   Recession fears and the three-week-old Persian Gulf crisis have
rattled financial markets worldwide. The Dow Jones industrial
average plunged by 76.73 points on Thursday to 2,483.42 and has
lost 17 percent of its valued since the market peaked at an
all-time high just below the 3,000 mark on July 17.
   The price of crude oil, which has jumped by nearly 50 percent
since Aug. 2, rose 71 cents to close at $31.93 on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
   Even the administration, while insisting that a recession can
still be avoided, is predicting that economic growth could be
trimmed in half by the rise in oil prices.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said that the GNP, which
averaged 1.5 percent through the first six months of this year, may
grow at a barely perceptible 0.75 percent in the last six months.
   Private forecasters, however, are far more pessimistic,
predicting that an outright recession, normally defined as two
consecutive quarters of negative growth, will begin, perhaps by the
final three months of this year.
   ``The longer the crisis in the Middle East lasts, the more
inevitable a downturn becomes,'' said David Wyss, an economist with
DRI-McGraw Hill, a Lexington, Mass., forecasting firm.
   Rising oil prices will only exacerbate an already gloomy
inflation outlook in the United States and keep the Federal Reserve
from administering its normal anti-inflation medicine _ a dose of
lower interest rates, many analysts believe.
   The latest survey of 49 top economists, taken this month after
the Iraqi invasion, showed them slashing their GNP forecast for
this year to 1.3 percent, down from a 1.9 percent GNP estimate the
month before. It marked the second largest one-month drop in
economic expectations in the 13-year history of the survey by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators, a monthly newsletter.
   Editor R.J. Eggert told subscribers, ``It's safe to conclude
that the United States now faces the greatest risk of recession in
the last eight years.''
   The current recovery from the 1981-82 recession is nearing its
eighth birthday. Only the almost nine-year expansion during the
1960s, which occurred during the Vietnam War, lasted for a longer
period.

<HEAD>Justice Department Asks Oil Companies for Help in Investigation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department's antitrust division is
taking a crash course in the petroleum industry, and its tutors _
oil companies summoned for meetings in the capital _ may end up
targets of prosecution.
   The antitrust division is trying to uncover whether illegal
tactics were used when the price of oil leaped following Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   As a first step in its investigation, the division is learning
the intricacies of how the industry works from the people who live
it daily, the oil companies.
   ``I have called the major oil companies and requested that they
come in on a one-by-one basis to meet with the staff and on several
occasions with me,'' Assistant Attorney General James Rill, who
heads the division, told reporters Thursday.
   Already, representatives of three major oil companies and two
independent marketers have met with some of the 10 antitrust
officials working on the inquiry, Rill said, declining to identify
the companies.
   The need for the background briefing is the complexity of the
situation, he said.
   ``We're dealing with an entire industry, multiple levels of
distribution, a worldwide situation,'' Rill said. ``It seemed to me
... prudent to get a very quick process going to attempt to get the
scope of the issue, the dynamics of the industry in hand before we
went to the kind of focused inquiry which may be the next phase.''
   The company representatives _ ``top level people in these
companies'' _ are explaining the industry's price practices, ``the
circumstances of the sharp increases in detail and the reasons why
those increases have occurred,'' Rill said.
   The average price of gasoline at the pump has jumped some 18
percent since Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, American Automobile
Association surveys report. The average pump price of unleaded
regular gasoline increased from $1.05 a gallon on July 25 to $1.24
a gallon on Monday, the AAA found.
   Prosecutors are looking for suggestions of collusion, unlawful
contacts or contacts suggesting anti-competitive activity and
``pricing and supply behavior that may not be fully explained by
market forces,'' Rill said.
   The inquiry's general fact-finding phase should be completed
within the next four weeks and should direct prosecutors to ``the
most promising lines of inquiry'' to pursue, he said.
   The companies have been forthcoming with information, even
though they know prosecutions may occur later, Rill said. They have
been promised confidentiality, he said, but he would not say
whether they had been offered any kind of immunity from prosecution
or other incentives to reveal information.
   Thus far, no subpoenas have been issued to compel cooperation,
but Rill said if any companies refuse to cooperate, ``We'll know
how to deal with them.''
   Rill had announced Aug. 6 that he was beginning such an inquiry.
That announcement, he said Thursday, was inspired both to alert the
industry that ``we were on the job and looking for evidence of
illegal conduct'' and to encourage any potential whistle-blowers to
come forth with information.

<HEAD>Intelligence Reports Show Saddam Repositioning Troops in Kuwait</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is
repositioning his elite Republican Guards, which led the attack
into Kuwait, behind other troops on the front lines, according to
an intelligence source.
   ``They're withdrawing the Republican Guard to positions behind
the front lines,'' said the source, who has access to intelligence
information and spoke Thursday on condition of anonymity.
   The source said the specialized troops were being positioned
behind another line of Iraqi troops but still would be capable of
contributing to a possible attack of Saudi Arabia from Kuwait.
   ``You put your forces in front of you to screen them, and then
you make your attack through them. There's no indication he's
withdrawing at all. He's adding to his forces,'' the source said.
   The key is the positioning of artillery, the source said.
   ``Artillery has a limited range. If you are in a defensive
position, you move it backward so you can withdraw under the
protection of your artillery. When you attack, you move it forward
to attack under its protection,'' the source said. ``His (Saddam's)
artillery is still forward.''
   NBC News reported Thursday that intelligence reports showed that
thousands of the guards, perhaps more than 50,000, were heading
away from the Saudi border.
   The intelligence source said Saddam's troops were involved in a
``classically Soviet'' military maneuver and that they retained the
ability to attack on short notice, within eight to 12 hours.
   U.S. intelligence has various means of detecting in great detail
the movements of Iraqi troops, but the source refused to discuss
how such information is obtained. It is well known that the United
States makes extensive use of satellite reconnaissance, however.
   There still appear to be about 160,000 Iraqi troops inside
Kuwait, the source said, adding that there appeared to be more
divisions moving into southern Iraq.
   American military officials assume that Saddam's heavily
mechanized forces could make a drive across the border and
simultaneously use air power in such an attack.
   Intelligence reports have indicated that the Iraqi army has
stores of food, ammunition, supplies and artillery in positions
that could be used to launch an attack into Saudi Arabia.
   The source described the situation as still being ``ambiguous''
and that it was not clear what Saddam intended to do.
   The source said Saddam's troops had thrown up what is known as a
``hasty defense.'' Troops didn't mount a defense in depth, a kind
of ``layer cake defense'' that would create severe difficulties for
an attacking opponent, the source said.

<HEAD>Committee Recommends Federal Courts Open to Cameras and
Microphones</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal courts may open their doors just a
crack to radio, television and photographic coverage.
   A five-judge committee of the policy-making U.S. Judicial
Conference will recommend an experiment in lifting the longtime ban
on such coverage when it meets next month, conference spokesman
David Sellers said Thursday.
   ``What the five-judge committee will recommend is a three-year
experiment,'' Sellers said. ``The conference could accept, amend,
reject or merely table the recommendation.''
   The experiment, if approved, would be limited to two federal
appeals courts and six federal trial courts. The committee, headed
by U.S. District Judge Robert Peckham of San Francisco, is not
recommending which courts be selected for the experiment.
   Civil _ but not criminal _ proceedings could be open to TV
cameras and other coverage now barred by federal court rules,
Sellers said.
   Judges would have broad discretion to bar such coverage in any
particular case, he said.
   Sellers said the committee's recommendation would entail no
government expense. ``Any expense would be borne by the news
media,'' he said.
   Peckham's committee is recommending that the experiment begin in
July 1991.
   The Judicial Conference is composed of 27 federal judges, and is
headed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. The conference has
been asked repeatedly in recent years by news media representatives
to open federal courts to TV, radio and photographic coverage.
   Peckham's committee told the conference last year that it lacked
sufficient information to make any recommendation for changing the
longtime ban.
   Most state courts allow some type of electronic or photographic
coverage of civil and criminal proceedings.

<HEAD>Products Preparing To Absorb Cost Of Coffee Maker Recall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Proctor-Silex Co. is setting aside
``several million dollars'' to provide free coffee makers to an
estimated 800,000 consumers who purchased a model mow declared a
fire hazard, company officials say.
   Arnold Dreyfus, the corporation's chairman, declined to say
Thursday exactly how much the recall would cost, remarking only
that it would depend on how many recalled coffee makers are turned
in.
   Commenting in a telephone interview from Proctor-Silex
headquarters in Richmond, Va., Dreyfus said the recalled models
were made in 1985 and 1986 and have since been discontinued.
   ``This problem did not manifest itself until much later,'' he
said.
   Proctor-Silex says it believes the recalled coffee makers are
subject to potentially dangerous over-heating because their
thermostats and thermal fuses may malfunction.
   Dreyfus said the company is trying to identify the vendors that
provided the allegedly ``bad fuses.''
   The company said more than 200 telephone operators are fielding
calls about Proctor-Silex automatic drip coffee makers and issuing
instructions on how to turn in recalled models and receive a free
appliance.
   Company officials acknowledged that the initial volume has been
so heavy that many consumers get repeated busy signals.
   The toll-free number set up by the company is 1-800-341-3333.

<HEAD>Flight Tests Show New Wing Design Could Cut Costs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tests show that airlines could save hundreds
of millions of dollars in fuel costs with a new wing design that
reduces drag from air flowing over a passenger jetliner's wings,
NASA says.
   A joint government-industry flight test program produced results
that were much better than expected, officials of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration said Thursday.
   The tests were conducted for five months on a Boeing 757 on
which a 22-foot wing section had been replaced by a wing surface
designed to produce a smooth air flow, the space agency said. If
the modification had been made along the entire wingspan on both
sides, drag would have been reduced by 10 percent, the space agency
said.
   Each percent of drag eliminated by the U.S. transport fleet
would result in an annual fuel savings of $100 million for the
industry, NASA said.
   The modified wing section includes millions of tiny,
laser-drilled holes in a titanium skin covered by a flap along the
leading edge to shield against insects and dirt during takeoffs and
landings.
   The holes create a suction effect that diverts turbulent air
from the surface of the wing and allows a smoother air flow.
   The design resulted from earlier flow tests on military jets,
NASA said. A future flight test is being considered that will use
the system on other wing sections.
   The testing is jointly funded by the government and Boeing
Commercial Airplane Group, which builds Boeing jetliners.

<HEAD>Author Sues New York Times Over Book Review</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investigative reporter angered by The New
York Times' review of his book on the alleged links between
organized crime and the National Football League has filed a $10
million libel lawsuit against the paper.
   Dan E. Moldea filed suit Thursday in U.S. District Court in
Washington over the newspaper's Sept. 3, 1989 review of his book,
``Interference: How Organized Crime Influences Professional
Football.''
   The New York Times's top attorney expressed confidence that the
suit would be thrown out of court and said the review was based
``on accurate facts.''
   The review by Times sportswriter Gerald Eskenazi said, in part,
that Moldea's book contains ``sloppy journalism'' as well as
``errors and unfounded insinuations.''
   The lawsuit alleges that the review ``was intended to protect
the NFL by personally attacking Moldea, discrediting his reputation
and smearing his good name as a careful investigative reporter.''
   ``The review gave false impressions through use of false and
misleading examples intended to injure Moldea's reputation, impeach
Moldea's honesty and integrity and destroyed the likelihood that
`Interference' would become a widely read book by the public,'' the
suit says.
   Moldea said in an interview that his publisher, William Morrow
and Co. Inc., had printed 33,000 copies of the book because initial
sales had been strong. But after The New York Times review came
out, sales dropped off precipitously, and only about 21,000 were
sold.
   ``This thing could have been stopped so long ago had they just
published a correction or my letter'' that countered, point by
point, statements in the review, Moldea said.
   Eskenazi declined comment on the matter, referring questions to
Times executives ``even though this is something I'm appalled at
when people do it to me.''

<HEAD>American Who Catalogued Destruction of Liberian Rain Forest
Escapes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSEPH NEFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Andrew Voros walked out of a jail
in war-ravaged Liberia with only a pair of jeans _ and many horror
stories.
   Voros, who spent the last four years documenting the destruction
of the last virgin rain forest in West Africa, had his work looted.
He also saw a friend tortured by soldiers who later told him his
friend had been killed. And he has memories of bodies littering
streets in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
   The 33-year-old New Jersey man was jailed for eight days in
Monrovia by soldiers loyal to President Samuel Doe. The U.S.
Embassy engineered Voros' release, U.S. Marines got him out of the
country Saturday and he returned Tuesday to his home in Rahway, 10
miles southwest of Newark.
   ``Since I was released, I've kept the loss of my friends and
work out of my mind,'' he said Thursday by telephone from his
home.``I'm so happy to be alive.''
   The eight-month-old rebellion to oust Doe reached Monrovia in
June. Since then, the city has been battered by rockets and
mortars, bodies litter the streets, and beleaguered residents have
gone without fresh food supplies, water and electricity.
   At least 5,000 people have been killed, most of them civilians.
   Front-end loaders regularly drove through town with their
buckets loaded with corpses, Voros recalled.
   ``There were people eating dogs and dogs eating people in the
street,'' he said.
   A month ago, he helped care for survivors of an army massacre of
hundreds of refugees in a Lutheran church. ``It was horrifying _
there were children with feet and hands blown off, women with legs
ripped open and breasts blown off,'' he said.
   Voros said he survived prison because of the deference Africans
show to white Americans. ``I got to wear my jeans during the day.
Everyone else was stripped,'' he said.
   Soldiers would accuse him of being a CIA agent at one point and
then ask for his help in getting a visa to the United States. ``You
don't know how many soldiers took my U.S. address down,'' he said.
   Voros and his close friend, Col. Christopher Doe, a former
finance director for the army who is not related to the president,
were arrested at Voros' house by soldiers who accused them of
supporting the rebels.
   On the fourth day of their imprisonment, ``Christie was brought
in, stripped and beaten with a cartridge belt in front of me,''
Voros said. The next day a soldier told Voros his friend had been
killed.
   The house was looted of all valuables, he said. ``Everything I
worked for four years was in my house,'' he said.
   A biology graduate, Voros worked in Yosemite National Park and
spent two years in Liberia with the Peace Corps until 1984. He
returned 1{ years later primarily to document the destruction of
the country's virgin rain forest, which he said is the last one
remaining in West Africa.
   Voros also videotaped secret tribal societies and scenes of
urban life in Monrovia, took shots of elephants and monkeys and
interviewed elderly Liberians about their homeland. Freed American
slaves founded Liberia in 1822.
   He had accumulated $50,000 in grants from U.S. government
agencies for his rain forest project, and worries he'll have to pay
it back because he has nothing to show for it.
   Over half of the rain forest has been destroyed by logging
companies that bribe government officials to get into the forest's
towering hardwoods, Voros said. Peasants then move into the area
and create farmland by slashing and burning the remaining forests.
   ``In 25 to 30 years, the rest of the forest will be destroyed,''
he said.
   If some semblance of peace returns, Voros said he'd like to
return.
   ``If the city is not destroyed completely, I'd like to go back
and post rewards for the return of my videos,'' he said.

   The U.S. and Soviet Ambassadors have
disagreed over whether the five permanent members of the Security
Council back a resolution allowing military force to put teeth in
the U.N. embargo against Iraq.
   After a private meeting Thursday at the French mission with the
ambassadors of the Soviet Union, Britain, China and France
Thursday, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told reporters: ``We
agreed on a text to send to capitals.''
   He said there would be a vote on the resolution ``as soon as it
can be arranged.''
   Pickering's statement appeared to indicate earlier Soviet
objections to using force to back up the international had been
overcome. Objections by Moscow have posed the biggest obstacle to
U.S. efforts on the issue.
   But when asked later whether the text was approved, Soviet
Ambassador Valentin V. Lozinskiy, replied: ``It's not. No. No,
that's the wrong impression.''
   Lozinskiy said, however, there could be a Security Council
meeting ``this week, probably.''
   When asked about a breakthrough, Lozinsky said: ``Hopefully,
hopefully. It takes time. Not today.''
   President Bush has said he wants the Security Council's blessing
to use force to halt Iraq's shipping. But he has also said the
United States already has the right to enforce the U.N. trade
sanctions against Iraq.
   U.S. officials contend the United States is authorized to
enforce the embargo at the request of the ousted Kuwaiti
government, and by the U.N. Charter, which grants nations the right
to self-defense.
   Soviet objections to wording in a U.S.-proposed U.N. resolution
on military enforcement of sanctions have in the past days been the
major obstacle to raising the issue.
   Moscow has said it wanted evidence the U.N. embargo was being
violated before the Security Council should authorize force to
police its sanctions.
   It has said it would not participate in an international
military operation unless it was organized by the United Nations.
It also has sought a larger role for the Security Council's
Military Staff Committee.
   The United States, however, seeks a loose arrangement in which
various national navies are free to use their own rules of
engagement and possibly operate in their own sectors to enforce the
embargo.
   U.S. officials have said they would not call a meeting of the
full 15-member Security Council unless they have approval of the
five permanent members, or a promise not to veto the U.S.
initiative.
   The economic sanctions were ordered by the United Nations on
Aug. 6 to punish Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait four days earlier.
   Meanwhile, a U.N. statement said two top U.N. officials checking
on foreigners in Iraq met nine foreign men held at an undisclosed
location about one hour from Baghdad.
   The two U.N. envoys in Iraq are Undersecretary-General Virendra
Dayal and personnel director Kofi Annan. They arrived Monday with
instructions from the Security Council to help ensure the safety
and secure the release of foreigners being held in Iraq and Kuwait.
The council has demanded their release.
   The envoys have been meeting senior Iraqi government officials,
but details of the discussions have not been disclosed. The United
Nations is removing about 310 staff and dependents from Iraq and
Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   Share prices in Tokyo rebounded Friday for the
first time in seven trading days, closing higher after fluctuations
influenced by reports Iraqi troops were withdrawing from Kuwait.
The dollar inched down against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 145.70 yen, down 0.18 yen from Thursday's
145.88-yen finish. It opened at 146.00 and ranged between 145.67
and 146.25.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average regained 428.13 points, or
1.8 percent, ending the day at 24,165.76 in the first gain since
Aug. 15, when the index soared 1,439.59 points.
   After peaking at mid-morning, the Nikkei fell almost 900 points
by mid-afternoon before rising back. Traders said last-minute
bargain hunting helped the late recovery.
   The index started lower on rapid selling in the wake of the
previous day's plunge, but regained nearly 700 points by
mid-morning as market players began buying after an NBC news report
that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had ordered some elite troops
withdrawn from the Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabian border, said Tomoya Koda,
a trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   The troops were to be replaced by second- and third-string
units, the report said.
   The market first took the news as a sign that Iraq was
withdrawing from the border, because many investors were
desperately seeking an excuse to buy after Thursday's hugo Stock Exchange
announced it would tighten regulations, effective Friday, on
speculative future trading to stop share prices from falling
further.
   Also, the Finance Ministry on Friday eased restrictions on
limiting security firms from trading more than 30 percent of the
total trading volume of one issue per month.
   ``As financial authorities started moving to defend the stock
market, a sense of confidence began to take root among investors,''
said Akira Shimoda, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities.
   But Koda said he saw little hope of market recovery by technical
measures, since psychological factors are having more impact on the
market movements.

   Engineers performed a partial memory
transplant on one of Magellan's computers as they tried to make
sure they don't lose touch with the unruly space probe for a third
time as it orbits Venus.
   Engineers haven't pinpointed the problem that made them
temporarily lose contact with Magellan twice during the past week.
They replaced the faulty computer memory because ``we're fixing the
symptoms,'' Ed Sherry, technical assistant to Magellan's project
manager, said Thursday.
   Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory today planned to
release more of Magellan's early pictures of Venus, made during a
test just before the first communications breakdown Aug. 16.
   The National Aeronautic and Space Administration released
Magellan's first Venus images Tuesday, only hours before losing
radio contact with the wayward spacecraft the second time.
   The first batch of test pictures showed numerous ``Venusquake''
faults, old lava flows, craters, cinder cones, valleys and ridges
on Venus. That means at least part of Venus is shaped by some of
the same violent forces that sculpted Earth.
   A laboratory official said Thursday that one of the pictures
being released today showed an interesting crater on the planet's
surface.
   Earlier this week, Magellan's chief scientist Steve Saunders
said that unreleased Magellan pictures showed a 20-mile-wide crater
that also had been seen by the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft
in the mid-1980s.
   The Soviet pictures were about 10 times less detailed than
Magellan's radar images, so it wasn't clear if the crater was
volcanic or caused by a meteorite impact.
   Magellan's pictures clearly show it is an impact crater, but the
floor of the crater is extremely smooth, indicating it was flooded
by lava that later solidified, Saunders said.
   He said the crater may have filled with lava from an eruption
triggered when a meteorite punched completely through Venus' crust.
Or the lava simply may have filled the crater much later in an
eruption unrelated to the impact.
   Magellan is on a $744 million mission to use its radar to peer
through the clouds of Venus and make the most detailed pictures and
maps yet of the second planet from the sun. It went into orbit
around Venus on Aug. 10, about 15 months after it was launched from
the shuttle Atlantis. It now is nearly 150 million miles from Earth.
   Sherry said engineers don't yet know how long Magellan's
troubles will delay the official start of its mapping effort, which
was to begin the first week of September.
   The ultimate problem that caused the malfunction remains
unknown. But flight data show that Tuesday night the spacecraft's
automatic safety systems were unable to maintain radio contact as
expected because part of the memory was ``corrupted'' in a backup
computer that helps point Magellan, Sherry said. He said engineers
replaced the faulty contents of that computer's memory with a
rewritten version that was radioed to the spacecraft Thursday.
   Magellan's main computer found ``something was not kosher'' in
the backup computer's memory and, as a result, assumed Magellan was
pointing in the wrong direction _ which it wasn't, Sherry said.
That made Magellan try to turn to what it thought was the correct
position, but it actually turned its antenna away from Earth,
losing contact.
   The series of malfunctions ``have shaken the spacecraft, but the
overall spacecraft remains very healthy, and we're very optimistic
we'll be back to a fruitful mission soon,'' Sherry said.

   About 70 ships from 11
nations are being deployed to the Persian Gulf or other Middle
Eastern waters in response to the Persian Gulf crisis, with more
than half of them flying the American flag.
   The U.S. Navy has a total of 37 ships either in the gulf or en
route, an unofficial count showed. Among them were four aircraft
carrier battle groups and the battleship Wisconsin.
   Here is a list of U.S. warships in the area or en route:
   In the gulf: the flagship La Salle, the Aegis cruiser Antietam,
missile cruiser England, destroyer David R. Ray, missile frigates
Vandegrift, Reid, Taylor and Robert G. Bradley, and frigate Barbey.
   Aegis is an advanced computer-linked system of radar and
weaponry.
   In the north Arabian Sea: carrier Independence, missile cruiser
Jouett, missile destroyer Goldsborough, frigates Brewton and
Reasoner, ammunition ship Flint, oiler Cimmarron, replenishment
ships Andrew J. Higgins and White Plains.
   The latter two technically are not part of the Independence
battle group but supply U.S. ships in the area.
   The battleship Wisconsin should have arrived in the north
Arabian Sea in the last day or so, and may enter the gulf where its
Tomahawk cruise missiles could be brought to bear on targets in
Iraq. Navy sources said the battleship apparently sailed from
through the canal without accompanying escort.
   In the Red Sea: the carrier Saratoga arrived via the Suez Canal
on Wednesday, accompanied by the Aegis missile cruiser Philippine
Sea and the missile cruiser Biddle. Three other members of its
battle group, the missile destroyer Sampson and frigates Elmer
Montgomery and Thomas C. Hart, were scheduled to follow it through
the canal in the next few days.
   The Saratoga group replaces the nuclear powered carrier Dwight
D. Eisenhower, which has been in the Red Sea for the past two weeks
and is returning to the Mediterranean.
   Navy sources declined to say whether the Eisenhower, which was
just completing a Mediterranean tour with the U.S. 6th Fleet when
the crisis arose, will remain in the area.
   The Eisnhower battle group includes the Aegis missile cruiser
Ticonderoga, missile destroyer Scott, missile destroyer Tattnall,
destroyer John Rodgers, the oiler Neosho and the ammunition ship
Suribachi.
   En route to the Mediterranean is another battle group headed by
the carrier John F. Kennedy and including the nuclear powered
missile cruiser Mississippi, Aegis missile cruisers San Jacinto and
Thomas S. Gates, and the missile frigate Samuel B. Roberts.
   A number of landing assault ships and large supply vessels are
en route to the gulf, carrying Marine combat units and heavy
equipment for the Marine and Army units in Saudi Srabia. Three of
the latter are transiting Suez this week, and three others were
sent from the Diego Garcia base in the Indian Ocean.
   Here are the naval forces of other countries in the gulf region
now present, en route or scheduled to deploy:
   Britain: Four ships. The destroyer York, frigates Jupiter and
Battleaxe, and supply ship Orangeleaf, are in the gulf. The British
also have said they will send three minesweepers and support ships.
   France: Nine ships, including the carrier Clemenceau, the
cruiser Colbert, destroyers Duplex and Montcalm, supply tanker Var
and ocean tug Buffle. They are in the Arabian Sea.
   Soviet Union: The Soviets say they have two navy vessels at
anchor in the Oman Straits _ a destroyer and an anti-submarine
vessel. Moscow, which until recently maintained seven to 10 ships
in the gulf region on a regular basis, has said it does not plan to
send more at this time and would only take part in a naval blockade
under full United Nations auspices.
   Italy: Five ships. The frigates Orsa and Libeccio, and the
supply ship Stromboli, were to pass through the Suez Canal on
Friday en route to the gulf, provided the Italian Parliament gives
final approval for their deployment to the crisis zone. Two
corvettes, Minerva and Sfinge, left Italy last Thursday for
deployment off the coast of Turkey.
   Belgium: Announced plans to send two minehunters and a support
ship to the Mediterranean, possibly on to the gulf.
   Netherlands: Two frigates en route to the gulf.
   West Germany: announced it would send several minesweepers to
the Mediterranean to take up slack of U.S. ships redeployed to the
gulf, a policy decision also adopted during the Iran-Iraq war in
1987-88.
   Spain: Planning to deploy one frigate and two corvettes.
   Australia: Two missile frigates and a supply vessel en route to
the gulf.
   Canada: planning to send two warships and a support vessel to
the gulf.

<HEAD>Cracks Appear in Soviet Union with Independence Moves</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More cracks have appeared in the Soviet Union,
with Armenia declaring independence, Turkmenia announcing its
sovereignty and Estonia beginning talks toward separation.
   However, struggling to keep the nation whole and the economy
afloat, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Thursday managed to
neutralize the Russian republic's attempt to take control of its
own vast natural resources.
   Also Thursday, heavily armed KGB border troops rolled tanks up
to the Polish-Lithuanian border to prevent unauthorized crossings
on the 51st anniversary of the pact that allowed Stalin to seize
the Baltic republics.
   Armenia, a republic of 3.3 million people on the border with
Turkey and Iran, is the fifth of the Soviet Union's 15 republics to
move toward complete independence from the Soviet Union.
   Armenia's independence resolution ``declares the beginning of
the process of establishing independent statehood,'' according to
an English translation sent to The Associated Press.
   Armenian legislator Samvel Shakhmuradyan said he expects the
republic to remain part of the Soviet Union only during an
undefined transition period to complete separation.
   Armenia's path to independece, however, might be complicated by
the bloody two-year conflict with neighboring Azerbaijan over the
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The declaration calls for creation of Armenia's own armed forces
to safeguard the border, and for Nagorno-Karabakh, a largely
Armenian area of Azerbaijan, to become part of the Armenian
republic.
   The move threatened Gorbachev's struggles to develop a new union
treaty attractive enough to keep his nation whole. Gorbachev,
however, seems to be bowing to Baltic demands for complete
independence.
   Kremlin officials began formal negotiations with Estonia on
Thursday. The two other Baltics, Latvia and Lithuania, were
expected to begin independence negotiations soon. Georgia has also
requested talks with the Kremlin on independence.
   The Estonian and Soviet delegations plan to meet weekly for two
months and present a final document to Gorbachev's Presidential
Council by the end of October, reported the official Soviet news
agency Tass.
   Seven republics have declared sovereignty, or the right to
overturn Soviet laws on their territory. The republic of Turkmenia
passed such a declaration Thursday, joining Russia _ the largest
Soviet republic _ the Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Byelorussia, Moldavia
and Uzbekistan.
   The Armenian resolution was approved by a vote of 183-2,
Armenian legislator Samvel Shakhmuradyan said in a telephone
interview from Yerevan, the capital of the small republic.
   It invalidates the Soviet Constitution on Armenian territory and
says that only the republic's Constitution is in effect, and
demands a share of the Soviet national wealth, Shakhmuradyan said.
   The resolution calls for the creation of Armenia's own currency,
banking system and customs duties and claims Armenia's right to
conduct its own foreign policy. It also bars other nations' troops
and bases from its territory, a clear reference to the Soviet armed
forces.
   The declaration changes the name of the ``Armenian Soviet
Socialist Republic'' to the ``Republic of Armenia.''
   It says Armenia will have a multiparty political system and
freedom of expression, press and religion, Tass reported.
   Meanwhile, Thursday, Gorbachev issued a presidential decree that
nullified the Russian attempt to wrest control over its natural
resources. But on the same day, Russia, the largest of the 15
Soviet republics, backed away from its order earlier this month
that declared invalid contracts signed by the Soviet government.
   Its action averted _ or postponed _ a critical battle between
the national Soviet government and the resource-rich republic over
both the acquisition of badly needed foreign currency and the
division of power.
   Also Thursday, Soviet authorities refused to relinquish control
of the border station between Lithuania and Ogrodniki, Poland, and
reinforced that determination with a heavy show of force.
   In Lithuania, Independence activists had hoped to take control
of the border crossing from Soviet authorities in a one-day
demonstration of their desire to open Lithuania to the rest of
Europe.
   Lithuania and the two other Baltic republics, Latvia and
Estonia, were independent between the two World Wars but lost that
independence as a result of the Molotov-Ribbentrop non-agression
pact the Soviets signed with Nazi Germany in 1939.
   On a field about a mile inside the border, an estimated 30,000
rain-drenched Lithuanians took part in a Roman Catholic Mass as
part of the event dubbed ``One European Road.''

   A private plane carrying oil-rig workers
returning from a tour of duty in Europe crashed and burned at
Houston International Airport, killing three men and injuring 12
others.
   Several passengers walked away from the wreckage virtually
unscathed.
   ``The last thing I said when we were going down was, `God help
me,' and I believe he did,'' said Edward Odom, 28, Stonewall,
Miss., who suffered scratches on one hand.
   Federal investigators planned to resume an investigation today
into Thursday afternoon's crash shortly after takeoff of the New
Orleans-bound twin-engine Grumman G-159 turboprop.
   The plane, carrying employees of Houston-based Rowan Drilling
Co., crashed about a mile south of the airport's main terminal
complex, officials said. The fuselage was torn nearly in half and a
fire scorched sections of the aircraft.
   Authorities identified the dead as pilot Billy Jack Keefauver,
60, of Houston; copilot Wayne D. Kay, 49, of Katy, Texas; and
Gregory Hunter, 30, Covington, La., who was traveling in the
cockpit.
   Three men were treated and released, and nine others were
hospitalized with conditions ranging from stable to good, hospital
officials said.
   Odom and his colleagues had been working on oil rigs in the
North Sea. They had just arrived on a British Airways flight from
London and were continuing to Louisiana and Mississippi on the
private plane.
   ``We were all sitting down, talking and it seemed like a
perfectly normal flight,'' Odom said. ``For some reason, the left
side was dipping and kept dipping.
   ``It was going through my mind that it was going down,'' he
said. ``The next thing in my mind was that it had stopped and I had
to get out. After I got out, I said, `Man, how lucky can you get?'''
   ``The only thing we could tell that was different was that it
was taking off early, but it was picking up altitude,'' said
Patrick Michael Duran, 33, of Meridian, Miss., who suffered a
sprained arm. ``But instead of going straight off the runway, it
went to the right.''

   Alexander Gbayee lets strangers sleep in his
home, buys them food and clothing and bails them out of jail. He's
done that job for free since 1978, when Liberia appointed him its
honorary consul for the Midwest.
   Now, 38 years after leaving, Gbayee plans to resettle in his
troubled homeland. ``I think I can help more people, do more good
over there,'' he said.
   Gbayee and other Liberian immigrants are organizing an emergency
relief fund to help civilians trapped by an eight-month-old civil
war in which more than 5,000 people, mostly civilians, have been
killed.
   ``It's strictly a humanitarian effort,'' Gbayee said. ``We're
not going to be helping any faction involved in the fighting. It's
the average person, the common person, who's dying daily, and they
have nothing to do with the government.''
   Gbayee, 52, recently returned from a two-month visit to
Monrovia, the Liberian capital, and said he expects soon to return
for good.
   Operating out of a carpet shop on the South Side, Gbayee said he
has helped many of the estimated 3,000 Liberians who have moved to
the Midwest.
   ``It's an honorary position, there's no salary for that. I serve
out of love for my country,'' he said. With his departure, the
consulate will close until a successor is appointed, he said.
   In 1957, Gbayee traveled from his small African village of
Dodoken to attend school in Chicago. He had been studying with
missionaries from Chicago's Church of God and Christ, and, to a
13-year-old, America seemed ``almost like heaven.''
   Village elders sold a cow for $24 to help finance the trip, he
said.
   Gbayee graduated from a private Christian school and went on to
earn a master's degree in education from Loyola University.
   Now, he said he uses his experience and education to help
Liberians who sometimes arrive in the United States with no
arrangements for shelter, no warm clothes and little money. All
expenses come out of his own pocket, he said.
   When Africans have gotten in trouble with immigration officials
and police, Gbayee said he's traveled as far as Texas to vouch for
them or pay bail.
   In 1984, he said, 25 Liberian students arrived to attend Chicago
State University, only to find themselves without room and board.
Gbayee and his wife, Musu, took 11 into their four-bedroom
apartment, found homes for the rest, and helped many get part-time
jobs.
   ``I think he's gone beyond the line of duty to help people,''
said Willie Nebo, one of the students who spent six months camped
in Gbayee's apartment.
   ``He does very well, not only for Liberians but for other
Africans,'' said Nebo, who graduated this year from Chicago State
University with an economics degree.
   Chernoh M. Sesay, Chicago State's vice president for academic
affairs, said, ``He could just deal with people on an official
level. But he loves people. He's one of a kind.''
   Gbayee doesn't mind the lack of payment or gratitude from his
country.
   ``What I do, the good is never lost,'' he said. ``I'll get
greater reward from the Creator than human praise.''

   A helicopter gunship strafed and
killed at least 100 Tamil rebels riding bicycles toward Jaffna to
help stave off a government offensive against their stronghold,
military officials said today.
   The Tamils were among 150 guerrillas who were attacked Thursday
at Kopay, 5 miles northeast of Jaffna, according to the officials.
   The rebels accused the government of indiscriminate bombing of
civilians.
   Jaffna town is the rebels' chief stronghold in their 7-year-old
war for an independent state in the north and east of the island
nation. The town lies on a lagoon on the Jaffna Peninsula at the
northern tip of this Indian Ocean island nation.
   The only government presence in the town is 250 policemen and
soldiers trapped in the 17th century Jaffna Fort since June 11 when
the Tamil Tiger guerrillas broke a 13-month cease-fire with the
Sinhalese-dominated government.
   On Wednesday, the government launched a new offensive and landed
troops on Kayts Island, which faces the fort across 4 miles of
water. So far, the government has said four soldiers were killed
and 16 wounded by land mines in their push to reach the mainland.
   No independent reports have emerged on the fighting in Jaffna,
185 miles northeast of Colombo. Communications with the peninsula
were cut this summer when the latest round of Tamil-Sinhalese
fighting broke out.
   A Tiger statement, issued in London, charged that
``indiscriminate aerial and naval bombardment on heavily populated
areas in the whole of the Jaffna Peninsula was claiming many
civilian lives.''
   The Tigers said Manthikai and Moolai hospitals in the heart of
the peninsula were hit. The statement gave no casualty figures.
   The government says it bombs only ``identified rebel targets.''
   It declared an around-the-clock curfew before launching the
offensive. On Tuesday, airplanes dropped leaflets warning the
peninsula's estimated 850,000 civilians to stay indoors until
further notice.
   The government has declined to say how many troops have been
deployed, but it said planes and boats landed 5,000 men in the
peninsula in the last three days to join a force moving up the
isthmus.
   Since the Tamil insurrection began in 1983, both sides have used
heavy firepower and civilian casualties have been high. Tamil
guerrillas have massacred whole villages of Sinhalese and Moslems
in northern and eastern Sri Lanka as well as entire police
garrisons.
   In the early years of the revolt, the government responded with
massive land and air assaults that prompted neighboring India to
intervene in 1987. The Indian peacekeeping force left in March
after failing to quell the jungle war.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the war that grew out
of Tamil complaints of discrimination by the Sinhalese majority.
Moslems are caught in the war, accused by the Tamils of siding with
the government.
   Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the 16 million people of
Sri Lanka, have dominated the government and military since the
Indian Ocean island became independent from Britain in 1949.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent, while Moslems account for 7 percent.

<HEAD>Share Prices Up, Dollar Down in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices in Tokyo rebounded today for the first
time in seven trading days, helped by bargain hunting and a sense
of confidence resulting from official efforts to save the suffering
stock market. The U.S. dollar fell slightly against the yen.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average regained 428.13 points, or
1.8 percent, ending the day at 24,165.76. It was the first gain
since Aug. 15 and followed two days of steep plunges.
   About 550 million shares, up from Thursday's 450 million, traded
hands in moderate trading on the first section.
   The U.S. dollar closed at 145.70 yen, down 0.18 yen from
Thursday's finish of 145.88 yen. The currency opened at 146.00 yen
and ranged between 145.67 yen and 146.25 yen. About $9.4 billion
changed hands in spot trading.
   The Nikkei was swayed throughout the day by reports that Iraqi
troops were withdrawing from Kuwait. After peaking at mid-morning,
the Nikkei fell almost 900 points by mid-afternoon before surging
back. Traders said last-minute bargain hunting helped the late
recovery.
   Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co., said a
sense of confidence, resulting from the government effort to save
the market, was gradually taking root among investors and supported
the market.
   ``Their measures are not directly helping the market's recovery,
but their action is at least a big psychological support,'' he said.
   Following Thursday's sharp decline, the Finance Ministry today
eased restrictions on the amount of shares each security firm can
trade on each issue.
   Also, the Tokyo Stock Exchange announced it would tighten
technical regulations beginning today to restrict speculative
trading.
   Earlier today, market players began buying when they heard a
news report that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had ordered some elite
troops withdrawn from the Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabian border, said Tomoya
Koda, a trader with New Japan Securities Co.
   But Koda said the index lost its early gains when investors
started selling ``because they reinterpreted the move negatively as
a sign of Iraq's preparation in case of a U.S. attack.''
   Meanwhile, on the foreign exchange market, the dollar weakened
as a result of technical adjustments with the yen amid continuing
uncertainties over the Gulf crisis, said Naohiko Yasuda, a dealer
with the Bank of Tokyo.
   He said investors tended to buy the yen based on their
speculation that the Bank of Japan will have to raise its official
discount rate to stem growing inflationary pressure resulting from
soaring oil prices.
   North Brent crude oil for October delivery was notionally valued
at $30.65-$30.75 per barrel at late afternoon. The level was lower
than the $30.80 dollar-per-barrel level Thursday in Asia.
   Oil traders said participants pushed down oil prices by selling
part of their overbought positions to take profits following a
dramatic price increase since earlier this week.

   The Pentagon has begun calling up military reserve units to help
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf region.
   An Air National Guard unit in New York state was ordered to
report for duty by midnight tonight. The 137th Military Airlift
Squadron, a unit of the 105th Military Airlift Group of the New
York Air National Guard, was activated late Thursday, squadron Lt.
Col. John Perez said.
   The squadron, which has about 150 members, is based at Stewart
International Airport in Newburgh. Many members are pilots, dock
handlers and load masters trained to fly cargoes great distances,
and they likely will be used to fly troops and materials into the
Gulf region, Perez said.
   Nationwide, about 46,700 part-time soldiers will have been
called by Oct. 1, about 9,800 of them by the end of this month,
Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Thursday. Williams said he
could not rule out the possibility of more reserves being activated
later.
   President Bush has the authority to call up as many as 200,000
reserves for up to 180 days without declaring a national emergency.
   The call-up of reserves, authorized by Bush on Wednesday, is the
first since the Vietnam War.

victim before someone fatally stabbed him.
   After the stabbing, the crowd of Bronx neighbors dispersed and
police were unable identify those involved, Lt. James Malvey said
Thursday.
   ``They're tight-lipped,'' Malvey said of residents in the
crime-ridden neighborhood. ``They saw a group of people struggling,
period. They don't want to get involved.''
   The dead man, found with stolen jewelry in his pocket, was
identified as Jose Abreu, 49, of Queens, police said.
   The victims, Carlos Rosario and his wife, let two men into their
apartment late Wednesday after the robbers yelled ``Open up. It's
the police.''
   Threatened with a gun, the couple was robbed and the thieves
tried to tie them up. A struggle between Rosario and the robbers
ensued, allowing his wife to flee through the fire escape.
   Her screams alerted neighbors and the robbers fled, followed by
Rosario. The two men split up and Rosario followed the one he
believed had his wife's jewelry, Malvey said.
   About 10 men joined in the chase and descended on Abreu after
Rosario caught up with him about two blocks away. Rosario said
Abreu slashed him on the shoulder during the scuffle, prompting him
to roll out of harm's way.
   Rosario told police he did not see who stabbed Abreu and
witnesses declined to help investigators, although officers believe
the killing was justified.
   ``They are very wary of getting involved with anything that has
to do with someone's death,'' Malvey said. ``At this point in the
investigation, there is no reason to believe anything other than
this is a good Samaritan act.''
   The other robber got away. Rosario was treated for a knife wound
at a nearby hospital.
   Violence in the West Farms section of the Bronx is commonplace,
with drug dealing and drug-related robberies plaguing the area,
residents say. There were as many as seven shootings there last
summer, Jose Resto said.
   ``The kids don't have little .38s anymore, they have Uzis,'' he
said.
   Police declined to call the mob attack vigilantism.
   But Thomas Reppetto, head of the Citizens Crime Commission,
said: ``The signs are there that people are losing faith in the
criminal justice system to protect them.''
   Sandy Ayala, back in West Farms for a visit, said she moved away
when a flying bullet grazed her son's head.
   ``The neighborhood is so bad that the cops are scared of it,''
she said.

<HEAD>Long-Term Coil Said Highly Effective</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATTI HUUHTANEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Finnish company has introduced a
five-year hormone-releasing contraceptive coil that doctors say is
highly effective.
   The intrauterine device called Levanova-R was put on the Finnish
market by the Leiras company on Thursday after getting government
approval.
   Levanova-R releases levonorgestrel, a synthetic hormone that
prevents fertilization, said Maija Haukkamaa, chief physician at
Helsinki University Hospital.
   The coil is inserted for five years at a time, then replaced,
unless pregnancy is desired.
   The advantage of the hormone-releasing coil is that fertility
returns quickly after it is removed, Haukkamaa said in an interview.
   ``The new coil has a factor of 0.1 percent on the Pearl Index
(which indicates the likelihood of pregnancy). That is the same as
for sterilization. The factor for traditional IUD coils is as high
as 1 percent to 3 percent,'' Haukkamaa said.
   The hormone-releasing IUD contraceptive is not recommended for
young women or women who have never given birth. For such users, it
could cause miscarriages and ectopic pregnancies, as other coils.
   ``But otherwise it is much safer and more comfortable,'' said
Haukkamaa.
   Haukkamaa said she has tested the new IUD on thousands of
Finnish women over 10 years, with good results. It also has been
clinically tested in 25 countries, including in the United States.
   Professor Tapani Luukkainen, a member of the New York-based
Population Council, said the coil would not have materialized after
18 years of research without support of the international council.
   ``They financed the research and we have a duty to try and
market the coil in the United States, but the U.S. markets are very
problematic,'' Luukkainen said.
   The coil is expected to sell in other European countries within
two years and possibly before then in Scandinavia.
   Luukkainen said the new coil, at $90, compares favorably in
price to traditional copper IUDs or other forms of contraception.
   The T-shaped plastic coil has a silicon cylinder which contains
the contraceptive hormone. A thin film regulates the release of the
hormone.
   ``The levonorgestrel hormone is completely safe and has been
tested worldwide in countless forms, including in contraceptive
pills, for many years,'' Luukkainen said.
   ``It stops menstrual bleeding and pain, and gives similar
infection-protection as oral contraceptives. It also can be used as
a cure for heavy menstrual bleeding,'' Luukkainen said.
   He added that it therefore could be used as a treatment for
heavy bleeding and other ailments which often require
hysterectomies.

   About 2,000 people filled a church to say
goodbye to legendary entertainer Pearl Bailey, remembering her for
her talent and loving personality.
   ``You'll always be here in our hearts where you belong,'' said
entertainer Cab Calloway, borrowing a line from the broadway show
``Hello Dolly!'' Calloway co-starred with Miss Bailey in the
all-black version of the show that earned her worldwide acclaim and
a Tony Award.
   ``I mean it from my heart and soul, that Pearl Bailey was
something you'll never see again,'' said Calloway, a pallbearer at
Thursday's funeral service.
   Miss Bailey, who spent much of her childhood in Philadelphia,
died here last Friday at the age of 72.
   About 2,000 people filled the Deliverance Evangelistic Church to
pay their last respects to the singer and actress.
   Flowers from Lena Horne, Ella Fitzgerald and B.B. King were
among those displayed in the church, but most mourners were family
and friends from Philadelphia.
   ``If you knew Miss Bailey, she would like it to be plain and
simple, not a lot of fanfare,'' the Rev. Timothy Jones, assistant
pastor at the church, told the gathering.
   The service for the singer born in Newport News, Va., featured
hymns, poetry and fond recollections. She was buried at Rolling
Green Memorial Park in nearby West Chester, where her mother and
brother are buried.
   ``Pearl was an original. She was a trailblazer, a teacher for
all of us,'' singer Tony Orlando said. ``If you wanted to learn to
do it right, you watched Pearl Bailey.''
   Miss Bailey's show business career started in Philadelphia at
age 15 when she sang ``Poor Butterfly'' in an amateur contest. She
went on to a successful career as a jazz singer, star of stage and
screen, and best-selling author.
   Once dubbed the ``ambassador of love,'' Miss Bailey endeared
herself to generations of fans with a ready smile and abundant
personal warmth.
   ``She loved everybody,'' said her husband of 38 years, jazz
drummer Louis Bellson Jr.
   ``They will remember her as a great entertaineer,'' he said.
``She was a person of love. She believed `show business' was `show
love.' ''

   Tom King plans to take a plunge of a
different sort on his wedding day: He says he'll hurl himself off
an 876-foot-high bridge.
   King plans to wed Vivian Campbell on Oct. 20 during the annual
Bridge Day festivities at the New River Gorge Bridge. Then he plans
to don a parachute and jump into the gorge, along with two
groomsmen and several wedding guests.
   Bridge Day is the only day of the year people can legally jump
off the bridge, one of North America's tallest. The event attracts
hundreds of parachutists from around the world.
   King, 39, and Campbell, 34, both of Memphis, Tenn., got engaged
on Bridge Day last year. She is a registered nurse.
   King, a real estate appraiser and keen skydiver for two decades,
found out about Bridge Day in 1984 and has taken part every year
since.

<HEAD>Pentagon Officials Urge `Decisive' Force Against Iraq</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Pentagon officials are urging a ``decisive''
attack against Iraq using air, naval and ground force if President
Bush orders the use of U.S. military might in the Persian Gulf
crisis, a newspaper reported today.
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff are urging that any military action
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his huge war-making
capacity be sweeping, simultaneous and deadly, the Los Angeles
Times reported today.
   ``We will attempt to be decisive,'' said Air Force Chief of
Staff Gen. Michael J. Dugan.
   Dugan and other officials stressed that the U.S. would not take
military action without provocation.
   Saddam is holding an estimated 3,000 Americans and 3,000 Britons
hostage in Iraq and Kuwait and has ordered some of them held at
potential military targets.
   The Pentagon is compiling an exhaustive list of Iraqi targets
for U.S. airplanes, the Times reported. The Air Force has
dispatched an estimated 250 fighters bombers and fighters, and the
Navy has an extra 270 aircraft ready.
   Those targets could include Saddam's presidential palace;
military command centers; Iraq's chemical and nuclear weapons
complexes; ballistic missile sites; military airfields; oil
refineries and pipelines; water purification plants; ports, rail
lines and highways, analysts said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday the United States
was organizing a significant military presence in the Middle East
and would respond aggressively if provoked.
   ``If (Saddam) were foolish enough to attack U.S. forces, we
clearly are in a position, if the President so decides, to respond
very forcefully against those things he cares about _ and
specifically, those are his forces and his capabilities inside
Iraq,'' Cheney said.
   Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
delivered an explicit threat to Saddam on Thursday.
   ``We will defend our interests. Don't try to scare us or
threaten us. It won't work,'' Powell declared in a speech to the
Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Baltimore.

<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein, parading some of his
Western captives on TV, ruffled the hair of a British child and
told the uneasy group they are not hostages but peacemakers.
   The Iraqi president today freed a British teen-ager traveling
alone caught in the standoff over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   But Saddam's TV performance, which Western governments denounced
as a sham show of sympathy, gave no hope that Americans and other
foreign captives would soon be freed from their role as human
shields to deter an attack on Iraq.
   The smiling Iraqi _ who traded his customary military uniform
for a gray suit for the broadcast Thursday _ told about 20 adults
and children they were being held ``to prevent the scourge of war.''
   ``You are not hostages here,'' he said, calling them ``guests.''
   Some of the hostages smiled back; others appeared wary.
   The Westerners' names weren't given, but at least two families
were identified by British relatives.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the broadcast
``the most sickening thing I've seen for a long time.''
   ``I think the manipulation of children in that way is
contemptible,'' he said. ``It showed us a man completely
unscrupulous in his choice of means. But I think it also showed us
that he completely misunderstood the people that he is dealing
with.''
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said:
``Saddam Hussein is obviously more interested in some sort of
shameful theatrics than in dealing with the two issues that really
matter, and that's withdrawal from Kuwait and freedom for innocent
civilians.''
   A 45-minute tape of the meeting was broadcast on Iraq's state
television showing the hostages taken in the aftermath of Iraq's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. It was an apparent attempt to show the
hostages were not being mistreated,
   It wasn't known when the tape was made or where the meeting was
held.
   British Airways said 15-year-old Alex Barnett arrived in the
Jordanian capital of Amman this morning on an Iraqi Airways flight
from Baghdad, after Iraq freed him to leave.
   Barnett had been traveling alone on a British Airways flight
heading from London to Madras, India and Malaysia that was stranded
in Kuwait City during the Aug. 2 invasion, the airline said.
   An airline official said Barnett, Hamilton, Scotland, would be
put on the first available flight from Amman to London.
   Saddam has said the foreigners _ including 3,000 Americans and
4,500 Britons _ will be held until the U.S.-led multinational force
is withdrawn from Saudi Arabia and an international embargo against
Iraq is lifted.
   Flanked by army officers and speaking through an interpreter,
the Iraqi president said on the tape he ordered the Westerners
interned at potential military targets ``to deter war.''
   ``If the Western media and governments chose to describe that as
using them as a human shield, that's their own interpretation,'' he
said.
   Saddam, 52, made jokes, arranged a group photograph, and
attempted to draw a friendly response from some of the children
shown on the broadcast. At one point, he ruffled the hair of a boy
who was standing by his side, and the boy appeared to lean away.
   Saddam asked two boys if they had enough room to play sports,
and if they were getting enough milk and food. One said he was
getting enough milk and corn flakes.
   Saddam then laughed and, turning to one of his officers and
said: ``He is getting more than our Iraqi children. I don't think
Iraqi children can get corn flakes.''
   Iraq has warned that if a United Nations embargo imposed on Iraq
brings food shortages, Westerners will suffer first.
   Saddam asked the foreign captives to forgive him for keeping
them in Iraq.
   ``This does not make us happy. What would make us happy would be
to see you back in your countries, or back in Baghdad ... in the
normal way you used to do,'' he said.

   OPEC oil producing nations meeting this
weekend in Vienna will discuss how to respond to the Persian Gulf
crisis, which has tightened world supplies and sent crude prices
soaring.
   Venezuela and oil giant Saudi Arabia would like OPEC's approval
to boost production to help meet the shortfall, but the Saudis have
said they'll pump more regardless of what the cartel decides.
   An OPEC source speaking on condition of anonymity said the
cartel's president, Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena, will be
in Vienna Sunday and ``he will consult with anybody who cares to
come.''
   But the informal meeting could turn into an emergency session in
which decisions could be made, said Venezuela's energy and mines
minister, Celestino Armas.
   Oil ministers from most of the 13 nations making up the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to attend the
talks in Vienna, the cartel's headquarters, Venezuelan President
Carlos Andres Perez said in Caracas.
   An OPEC official said on condition of anonymity this morning
that ministers from Algeria, Indonesia, Nigeria, Iran, Gabon,
Ecuador and Venezuela would attend.
   Fears of military escalation in the Mideast and shortages of oil
on Thursday sent futures prices for crude oil up 71 cents to $31.93
a barrel.
   Perez did not say the meeting would mean increased production to
make up for the international embargo of Kuwait and Iraq, imposed
after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of its oil-rich neighbor.
   Boosting production to make up for the decline in Iraqi and
Kuwaiti shipments, which amounts to about 4 million barrels of
crude oil daily, has received insufficient support among OPEC
members.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying his trip ``is a positive response to
(Boussena's) call for an exchange of views on the current situation
in the world oil market.''
   One source said Saudi Arabia also was likely to attend, but
there was no official confirmation of the report.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita was quoted by a
local newspaper in Jakarta as saying neither Iraq nor Kuwait would
attend the weekend talks.
   Boussena made a surprise visit Thursday to Jiddah, Saudi Arabia,
for talks with Hisham Nazer, the kingdom's oil minister, who was
rebuffed earlier in the week in an attempt to call an emergency
session of all 13 nations.
   Nazer, along with Venezuela's Armas, had requested the meeting
to discuss the turbulent situation. But OPEC headquarters issued a
statement Monday saying there was not enough support among the
others to hold a formal meeting.
   Nazer said last weekend Saudi Arabia, which produces about a
quarter of the cartel's oil, would lift pumping to 2 million
barrels a day, with or without the nod from OPEC.

<TEXT>
   Israel and Jordan, two small Middle Eastern
nations that exist side by side in an uneasy and unofficial state
of peace, are watching Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's moves with
apprehension.
   The lightning invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2 reminded the world what
Israelis and Jordanians always have known: Small nations can
disappear in the twinkling of an eye. Their survival in the
volatile region requires skill and considerable luck.
   Neither enjoys Saudi Arabia's benevolent resources. Neither can
depend on others to fight their battles.
   As they watch and wait, Israel is counting on its military might
and the tactical resourcefulness that sustained it against
overwhelming odds in the past. Jordan is depending on Iraq being
engaged elsewhere and on King Hussein's diplomatic footwork.
   Neither is looking to the United States to dispatch tens of
thousands of troops as President Bush has done to protect the Saudi
oil fields.
   Israeli leaders consistently have said they do not want
Americans fighting their wars. American weapons have made Israel
the most powerful military state in the area. The Israelis are
willing to take it from there.
   As for Jordan, the king also is bolstered by U.S. weapons and
economic aid. If he felt threatened by Iraq he would be unlikely to
call for U.S. troops to defend the country.
   Inviting American military intervention could provoke Saddam
Hussein, his far more powerful neighbor, and, a U.S. official said
privately, probably would be a ``death sentence'' for the king.
   Saddam's denunciation of Zionists leaves no doubt about his
attitude toward Israel. A Jewish state has no place in his vision
of the area.
   His approach to Jordan is less clear. Aqaba, the kingdom's port
on the Red Sea, has a strategic attraction. There is support for
Saddam Hussein among many of the king's subjects. And Jordan stands
between Iraq and Israel.
   Saddam's goal probably is a pliant Jordan rather than occupation
of the country. That could give him access to Aqaba and use of
Jordanian territory for Moslem fundamentalists to antagonize Syria,
an old Iraqi foe.
   King Hussein is in a tough spot. He has tried not to cross
either Saddam or President Bush. That's almost impossible in the
current state of high tensions, but the King, looking out for No.
1, is trying his best.
   On the one hand, he gave assurances to Bush last week in Maine
that Jordan would observe the economic boycott of Iraq. On the
other, the king said he was not clear about the exact terms of the
sanctions, thereby leaving himself wriggle room.
   The king moved on Thursday to close Jordan's border with Iraq,
which could make escape from that country and from Kuwait more
difficult for trapped foreign nationals. But thousands made it
over, and today Jordan's interior ministry announced the border
would remain open.
   Hussein challenged Bush's defense of Saudi Arabia, saying there
was no evidence Iraq was about to launch an attack when the
president rushed troops and warships to the region.
   Probably the best insurance the king has taken out is to offer
himself as the potential mediator between Iraq and the United
States.
   The two sides are too far at odds right now to look for a
negotiated way out of the crisis. Saddam's terms for releasing the
3,000 trapped Americans is a U.S. withdrawal from Saudi Arabia.
   But should the Iraqi leader find his back against the wall _ and
the economic squeeze could accomplish that _ he might offer enough
to get negotiations started.
   In the meantime, Israeli leaders have warned Iraq not to move
troops into Jordan. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has said he would
like to believe that Saddam ``knows that any attempt to harm us
will cost him and his army dearly.''

   And Thurman Thompson said he'll accept.
   Inviting Thompson to join the Fred H. Sexton Post 1 in Florence
is just one of the actions that enables the post to resume its
normal activities after being suspended last week, said Norris
Kinion, state commander for the American Legion.
   ``What I would hope is that those who didn't want me, they would
re-evaluate their thoughts and situations,'' Thompson said Thursday
night. ``I hope that everything ends on a positive note.''
   According to mintutes of a July meeting, members of the post
said they did not want a black in the all-white post, which has
more than 200 members.
   At the time, the post required just two votes to reject an
applicant. But the post changed its bylaws Tuesday to call for a
majority vote on all applications, Kinion said.
   The bylaws now conform with state and national rules, Kinion
said.
   The other American Legion post in Florence, post 228, has no
by-laws on race but has only black members.
   The suspension of post 1 has not been formally lifted, he said,
``but they're being permitted to function until such time as the
investigative committee can make its report.''
   Al Stein, commander of the Florence post, said Thursday he would
like Thompson to apply again. He had originally proposed Thompson
as a member before other Post members voted against it.
   Thompson is a former Navy petty officer and signalman who served
in Vietnam in 1972 and 1973.
   The rejection of Thompson prompted several members to resign,
and the Florence County legislative delegation fired Maria Lewis,
the county's veterans affairs officer, for her role in the incident.
   Ms. Lewis was the post's secretary. She had been under fire for
opposing Thompson's membership on grounds that bylaws prohibited
the integration of black and white posts.

   A woman was tied up for six days and her
boyfriend suffocated while five people, including the woman's
16-year-old sister, allegedly partied and sold the items in their
apartment, police said.
   Freddy Thomas, 32, suffocated while locked in a closet and bound
with duct tape, said Sgt. Mary Wrensen, a police spokeswoman.
Thomas, who also had been hit on the head with the butt of a
shotgun, was believed to have died Saturday, Wrensen said.
   His girlfriend, Orpah Sanders, 34, managed to escape Wednesday,
six days after the ordeal began, Wrensen said. She was treated at a
hospital and released.
   Locked in the bedroom, Sanders freed herself from duct tape,
climbed down the fire escape and told neighbors to call police.
   Arrested and charged Thursday with second-degree murder,
robbery, and unlawful imprisonment were Sanders' sister, Hope
Kelly, 16; William Fennel, 21; Samuel Rivera, 17; and Barbara
Redding, 17, all from the borough of the Bronx. A fifth suspect had

<HEAD>California Man Charged After Wife Commits Suicide In Michigan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM IRWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The inability of authorities to prosecute a
suburban doctor who helped a woman commit suicide apparently led a
California man to believe he could help his cancer-ravaged wife end
her life in Michigan.
   But while Dr. Jack Kevorkian remains free, Bertram R. Harper is
being held at Wayne County Jail on charges of murder and conspiracy
to commit murder.
   Harper, 72, of Loomis, Calif., was arrested Sunday, shortly
after his wife Virginia, 69, died in a room at the Comfort Inn in
Romulus on Detroit's outskirts, court records show. Their daughter,
Shanda McGrew, was present but was not charged.
   Kevorkian gained attention when he used a suicide device he had
created to help an Alzheimer's disease patient end her life June 4.
   Mrs. Harper developed breast cancer two years ago, and brought
to Michigan a note from a physician indicating she had only two
weeks to live, said Derek Humphry, executive director of the
Hemlock Society, a nationwide death-on-demand organization.
   Before ingesting sleeping pills and placing a plastic bag over
her head, she wrote a note saying she wished to die in the presence
of her husband and daughter, Humphry said. A cause of death has yet
to be determined.
   The family flew to Michigan on Saturday after learning from the
widely publicized death of Janet Adkins, 54, of Portland, Ore.,
that Michigan has no specific law against suicide or assisting in
it, Humphry said.
   Kevorkian has not been charged in the death of Adkins, 54, of
Portland, Ore. The 62-year-old retired pathologist used his device,
which released lethal chemicals into her system, in his van at a
county park about 40 miles north of Detroit.
   As to why one suicide resulted in charges and the other hasn't,
Wayne County Prosecutor John O'Hair said: ``You'll have to ask
(Oakland County Prosecutor) Dick Thompson that. We felt we had a
legal and factual basis to charge Mr. Harper.''
   O'Hair refused to comment on Harper's specific role in his
wife's death or give details on why he was charged with murder.
   Thompson said Thursday the Adkins case remained under criminal
investigation.
   ``We are waiting for the results of toxicology tests'' on Mrs.
Adkins' body, Thompson said. ``When we get those test results, we
will make a determination whether what he did was a crime.''
   Humphry said the Harpers did not attempt to contact Kevorkian,
who has been barred by court order from further use of his device.
Harper called police shortly after his wife died, Humphry said.
   The charges against Harper are each punishable by up to life
imprisonment, District Court administrator Nancy Schuette said.
Harper was held on $25,000 bond pending a preliminary hearing Aug.
29, she said.
   Humphry said his Eugene, Ore.-based society will help find a
lawyer for Harper and, if necessary, pay for it. The Harpers joined
the group in 1988 but did not consult with it before traveling to
Michigan, Humphry said.
   ``They went to Michigan thinking they'd be free of
prosecution,'' Humphry said. ``I think it's a major reaction
against Dr. Kevorkian. They can't charge Dr. Kevorkian with
anything. This looks as though it's a knee-jerk reaction.''
   Under California law, assisting in suicide is a crime punishable
by up to five years in prison, Humphry said.

   The Air Force said today it has activated six
reserve units to supplement its air transport operation for the
U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf area.
   The callup of Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units
from six states marks the start of a national mobilization of
reserves that President Bush authorized on Wednesday. The
mobilization is expected to continue at least until Oct. 1.
   Army, Navy and Coast Guard reserve forces also are scheduled to
be activated.
   ``The calls are going out,'' said Air Force Maj. Doug Hart, a
Defense Department spokesman.
   Hart also disclosed that about 14,000 members of the Army and
Air Force reserve forces already have voluntarily gone on active
duty.
   The six units announced by the Air Force are:
   _183rd Military Airlift Squadron, Air National Guard from
Jackson, Miss., flying C-141B Starlifter transport planes.
   _137th Military Airlift Squadron, Air National Guard from
Stewart, N.Y., flying C-5A Galaxies.
   _136th Mobile Aerial Port Squadron, Air National Guard from
Dallas, Texas, to provide an airlift terminal and cargo managers.
   _732nd Military Airlift Squadron, Air Force Reserve from McGuire
Air Force Base, N.J., flying C-141B Starlifters.
   _756th Military Airlift Squadron, Air Force Reserve from Andrews
Air Force Base, Md., flying C-141B Starlifters.
   _337th Military Airlift Squadron, Air Force Reserve from
Westover Air Force Base, Mass., flying C-5A Galaxies.
   The Pentagon announced on Thursday that about 46,700 reserves
will be called to active duty over the next five weeks for
Operation Desert Shield and that most of the part-time soldiers
will be posted in or near Saudi Arabia.
   Most reserves sent to help defend Saudi Arabia against a
possible Iraqi attack won't be driving tanks or digging foxholes.
But they will tackle two of the most important tasks in desert
warfare: getting water and protecting against chemical attacks.
   It's unclear whether any reserve combat units, such as the
Georgia National Guard unit that comprises one of three brigades in
the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Ga., will be
dispatched to the forbidding Saudi desert. The two active-duty
brigades in the 24th already are on their way there.
   Pete Williams, the Pentagon press secretary, said most of the
Army and Air Force reserve forces called to active duty will be
deployed to Saudi Arabia. Of the Navy reserves who are activated,
about half will be sent there, he said.
   Many of the military's key skills are held mainly by reserve
units. Among those considered most important for Desert Shield are
water distribution and purification specialists and experts in
chemical decontamination, officials said.
   Van D. Hipp Jr., deputy assistant secretary of the Army for
reserve forces and mobilization, said in an interview that 100
percent of the Army's water purification and distribution manpower
is in the reserves.
   In the Saudi desert, where temperatures in summer often top 120
degrees, American GIs are drinking as much as six gallons of water
a day to avoid dehydration. Water also is needed for cooking,
washing and other vital functions.
   Also, 65 percent of the Army's chemical decontamination manpower
is in the reserves, Hipp said. The prospect of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein ordering a poison gas attack on U.S. forces is one
of the biggest concerns of troops hunkering down in the desert.
   Doctors, nurses and other medical personnel also are largely in
the reserves.
   Williams said Thursday that about 9,800 part-time soldiers will
have been called to leave their civilian jobs by the end of August.
The total is expected to reach about 46,700 by Oct. 1, and Williams
said he could not rule out the possibility of more reserves being
activated later.
   President Bush has the authority to call up as many as 200,000
reserves for up to 180 days without declaring a national emergency.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney approved the services' requests
for reserve call-ups and also authorized them to force an
unspecified number of active-duty soldiers, sailors and airmen
already in the Middle East to put off plans to retire or quit.
   The call-up of reserves, authorized by Bush on Wednesday, is the
first since the Vietnam War.
   Under an order signed by Cheney, as many as 49,703 Army, Air
Force, Navy, Marine Corps and Coast Guard reserves could be
activated by Oct. 1, but Williams said the Marine Corps was not
planning to use the 3,000 reserves it is allowed to call.
   Those called to active duty will serve 90-day tours, but the
period could be extended another 90 days if Cheney decides that is
necessary, Williams said.
   Williams gave the following breakdown of expected reserve
call-ups by service:
   _Army: 24,734 by Oct. 1; to fill immediate needs, 4,912 of the
total will be called by Aug. 31.
   _Air Force: 14,476, of which 1,002 will be called by the end of
the month.
   _Navy: 6,243, with 3,030 activated by Aug. 31.
   _Coast Guard: 1,200, including 700 by the end of the month.
   Williams said the numbers represent what each service believes
it will need to supplement its active duty force and that Cheney
approved the figures as upper limits. The actual number called up
could be slightly less, Williams said.
   ``We will call up only what we need and only when we need it,''
Williams said.

<HEAD>Government Imposes State of Emergency in Townships</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Vlok news conference, adds details
on state of emergency, background. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government imposed a state
of emergency today in black townships hit by savage tribal fighting
that has cost more than 500 lives and said troops and police would
be poured into the areas.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok declared black townships
around Johannesburg ``unrest areas.'' The action gives police
widespread powers under the internal security laws to detain people
and to take action to suppress demonstrations and violence.
   ``It is in the interest of South Africa and all its inhabitants
that further bloodshed, disorder and chaos be prevented at all
costs,'' Vlok said in a statement issued in Pretoria.
   The government action came as riot police strung razor wire and
fired shotguns and tear gas today to keep warring Zulus and Xhosas
apart as military reservists were called up to help stop the
fighting.
   Vlok also ordered that people in the unrest areas would not be
allowed to carry a wide range of weapons at public meetings. The
banned weapons included firearms, spears, battle axes, pitchforks,
knives and machetes.
   He said the emergency declaration in each area would last up to
three months. The minister also promised that police and army units
in the areas would be ``drastically increased,'' but gave no
details.
   The declaration gives police authority to take almost any steps
they regard as necessary to maintain order in affected areas. But
Vlok told journalists the measure would not include bans on
reporting in the areas.
   A nationwide state of emergency imposed in 1985 had restricted
reporting on unrest. The government lifted the emergency on June 8
in all areas except for Natal Province, where black factional
fighting has killed thousands.
   The African National Congress had demanded lifting of the
nationwide state of emergency as a condition of formal talks with
the white-led government on a new constitution.
   ANC officials had no immediate response to Vlok's statement.
   Police strung razor wire today around Zulu hostels in Kagiso
township west of Johannesburg to keep hundreds of heavily-armed
Zulus from fighting local Xhosa residents. Riot squads demolished
barricades put up by residents in the town where four people were
killed Thursday.
   Residents were demanding Zulus be driven out of the migrant
worker hostels.
   ``Kill them, that's the only way. An eye for an eye. They must
go back to Zululand,'' said one angry woman.
   Police also clashed today in Vosloorus township east of
Johannesburg with stone throwing protesters who tried to block
streets with burning car tires and other debris.
   Senior police commanders said most townships around Johannesburg
were tense but quiet. A lull appeared to have set in, and police
hoped to restore order, said one commander, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   A South African Defense Force spokesman said military reservists
were being called up in Johannesburg to beef up police and regular
army units deployed in the townships. The spokesman, who declined
to be named, gave no figures on how many reservists were being
called to duty.
   Zulus, mostly loyal to the conservative Inkatha movement, and
Xhosas who support the ANC have been battling since Aug. 12 with
guns, spears, axes, knives and other weapons. More than 500 people
have been killed in the fighting around Johannesburg.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela said Thursday the government should
place soldiers and police around migrant workers hostels in the
townships where much of the violence has occurred.
   Asked if he thought the violence was easing, Mandela said: ``I
don't think so. I think it's too early to say that.''
   The fighting has continued despite pleas from government and
black leaders for peace and a strong police and army presence in
the townships. It is considered the most serious violence since
nationwide unrest in the mid-1980s.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who cut short a visit to
Canada because of the violence, on Thursday toured parts of Tokoza,
one of the hardest hit townships.
   ``We have come to express solidarity with them,'' Tutu said of
the residents. ``Their pain is our pain.'' Tutu has called for an
international peacekeeping force to halt the fighting.
   Meanwhile, ANC spokesman Pallo Jordan said the ANC and Inkatha
plan to hold exploratory talks soon.
   ``We have, in the last week, tried to initiate talks at the
grassroots level,'' Jordan told government-run television. ``Talks
can take place at any number of levels.''
   However, he said there was no guarantee Mandela would meet
Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
   The ANC blames Inkatha for spreading black factional fighting
from the eastern province of Natal Province to the townships near
Johannesburg. Political violence between ANC and Inkatha supporters
has killed some 5,000 blacks in Natal in the past five years.
   Inkatha accuses the ANC of trying to wipe out any competition
for power among black opposition groups.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, the system of segregation and
white dominance, but differ on the shape of a future South Africa.

<TEXT>
   Jordanian officials were again allowing
thousands of refugees to cross over from Iraq today, despite an
announcement earlier this week that the border would be closed to
them.
   But Turkey, another escape route for refugees, said today it
might close its border with Iraq.
   Also today, two Americans, a young married couple, were among
those arriving in the Jordanian capital aboard an Iraqi Airways
flight with two dozen other people.
   United Nations officials at the airport identified the couple as
``Mr. and Mrs. Gray,'' but did not provide their full names or
hometown.
   Meanwhile, Jordan's King Hussein returned from a short visit to
Sudan and Yemen, where he discussed the Persian Gulf crisis with
leaders of both countries.
   Jordan had said Wednesday it was closing its border with Iraq,
effective Thursday, because of the strain caused by tens of
thousands of refugees who have flooded the country since the Aug. 2
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   But a senior border security official said 6,000 foreigners,
mainly Arabs or Asians, had crossed from Iraq at the Ruweishid
border post, 210 miles northeast of Amman, by midday today.
   The official Jordanian news agency Petra quoted an unidentified
Interior Ministry spokesman as saying that border officials had
been told to allow in 20,000 evacuees today.
   Also arriving today aboard the Iraqi Airways flight was a
15-year-old Scottish boy, Alex Cameron-Barnette, who had been
stranded in Kuwait for 22 days. Airport officials said he was
traveling alone. AP Photographer Max Nash, who was at Queen Alia
International Aiport, reported the arrivals.
   Meanwhile, in Turkey, which also borders Iraq, beleaguered
officials said they may close the frontier with Iraq unless
countries whose nationals are coming through take steps to ensure
quick transit.
   Premier Yildirim Akabulut said Turkey's only crossing point with
Iraq, the Habur post, was built for commercial truck traffic and
lacks facilities to handle large numbers of people.
   Turkey's semi-official Anatolia news agency said today that 56
foreigners, including Austrians, Swedes and Finns, had since
arrived late Thursday night.
   Earlier today, a Jordanian government official said many
countries had appealed to Amman to rescind its order to close the
border, one of the few escape routes from Iraq.
   ``We want to tell the world that we closed the borders only
because the massive influx of people was creating serious problems
for us,'' the official said on condition he not be identified.
   An international effort to help Jordan cope with the refugees
picked up steam today.
   In Geneva, a United Nations official said a planeload of 30 to
40 tons of emergency aid, including food, drinking water, blankets
and garbage bags to promote hygience would fly from Itay to Jordan
on Monday or Tuesday.
   Mohammad Khatib, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. Disaster
Relief Coordinator, said the United Nations has allotted $30,000
for immediate aid to Jordan to handle the refugee influx.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told
reporters Thursday that the U.S. Embassy in Amman released $25,000
from the embassy's discretionary relief fund to Jordan to help care
for refugees.
   Belgium said today it would send two military transport planes
to Jordan to help airlift refugees. Also, the Netherlands and
France contributed a total of $848,000 dollars to the airlift.

   A teen-ager who is confined to a
wheelchair was charged with capital murder today after he and
another teen-ager allegedly chased down and killed a woman during a
robbery, police said.
   Sgt. Chip Pippen said Janie Howell, 44, was shot on a city
street, apparently as she tried to reach the police department on
foot.
   Pippen said Mondrick Bradley, 18, and a 13-year-old boy were
arrested a short time later and charged with capital murder.
Bradley has been confined to a wheelchair since being shot last
year.
   Pippen said Bradley, whose wheelchair was pushed by the younger
boy, allegedly had a pistol and fired shots at the woman as she
fled.
   ``They apparently caught up with her and she was shot in the
right side of the head and was dead at the scene,'' Pippen said.
``Her watch was missing.''
   Authorities said Bradley had a history of gang-related activity
but they were unsure whether the shooting that left him paralyzed
was gang related.

<HEAD>Industrial Carcinogens Could Be Cause of Alarming Cancer Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alarming increases in the occurrence of certain
cancers in the elderly could be the result of increasing exposure
to industrial carcinogens, researchers said Friday.
   In a report in the British journal The Lancet, researchers from
the United States, Europe and Asia concluded that brain and other
nervous system cancer had roughly doubled in people aged 65-84 from
1968 to 1987.
   Breast cancer, kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma and
melanoma have also increased in people 55 or older, the researchers
said.
   These patterns have previously been reported in the United
States, but this study finds the same trends in selected countries
in Europe and Asia, said the researchers, led by Devra Lee Davis of
the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C.
   They speculated that changes in exposure to carcinogens in the
environment could be one explanation.
   Older people have had greater exposure to industrial
carcinogens, including badly regulated exposure to newly introduced
household pesticides and chemicals in the 1940s and 1950s, the
researchers said.
   The elderly have also experienced greater exposure to
carcinogens in the workplace, because they have worked longer and
worked at a time when there were fewer environmental controls on
such carcinogens, the researchers said.
   Exposure to other illnesses, such as influenza during the large
epidemic in 1918, might also have helped predispose older people to
cancer.
   The findings summarized in the article in The Lancet are the
outgrowth of a workshop held in October 1989.

   A court has ruled that journalists must
give unpublished photographs and notes to people involved in
lawsuits over fires and other public events.
   The 2-1 ruling, released Thursday by the Michigan Court of
Appeals, was the first time a Michigan court considered the issue.
   ``The obligation of all persons to give evidence necessary for
the proper administration of justice is a fundamental civic duty
applicable to both criminal and civil cases,'' the ruling said.
   The decision involved The Ann Arbor News, a member of Booth
Newspapers Inc., which appealed a Washtenaw County Circuit Court
order that it turn over unpublished photographs of a fire scene.
   No decision has been made on appealing to the Michigan Supreme
Court, said Timothy White, the paper's publisher. ``Clearly it's
not favorable to us and we were very confident of winning on
appeal.''
   A Michigan State University associate professor of journalism
said the ruling is similar to those in other states which lack
broad press shield laws.
   Todd Simon, who is co-author of ``Mass Communication Law,''
said, ``They treat the photographer or reporter observing something
as no different from any other witness.''
   The photographs, taken of a Jan. 4, 1986, fire at Mark Video
Enterprises Inc., were sought by American Employers Insurance for
use in a civil lawsuit brought by business owner George J. Marketos
after the company rejected his claim. The company claimed arson was
involved in the $1.3 million fire.
   The News turned over its 20 unpublished photographs after the
appeals court agreed to decide the broader issue. The pictures were
not used in the trial.
   A majority of the court said no privilege exists under the First
Amendment, the Michigan Constitution or the Michigan Press Shield
Law. The shield law protects journalists from disclosing before
grand juries confidential information from informants.
   The court rejected the newspaper's arguments that it would be
too much trouble to produce photographs and material for anyone who
wanted to use them in a lawsuit.
   The News previously provided photographs for anyone who
requested them at the price of $5, the ruling said.
   The newspaper could seek a court order to protect it from
requests that were harassment, oppressive or unduly expensive, the
ruling said.
   In a dissent, Judge John H. Shepherd said reporters should be
protected unless their information is essential to the civil case
and unobtainable elsewhere.
   Allyn Kantor, attorney for American Employers, did not return a
telephone call seeking comment.

   Thousands of students battled police and
hijacked buses today during protests against a government plan to
reserve jobs for low-caste Hindus.
   The students tried to storm Parliament and hurled rocks at
police and government buildings. Police responded with tear gas and
tossed some of the rocks back at the demonstrators.
   The daylong protest brought traffic and business to a halt in
many districts of the capital city of 8 million people.
   Police and paramilitary troops went on alert after students
surged into streets, stopping traffic and urging motorists to join
their campaign. The students commandeered dozens of city buses and
drove them to Parliament.
   They tried to storm the massive, circular building but police
beat them back with steel-tipped bamboo poles.
   The police set up rope and metal barricades and fired repeated
rounds of tear gas when the students tried to form a human chain
around the Parliament building in downtown New Delhi.
   ``We don't want the politicians to come out of the Parliament.
Let them perish there,'' said Vinod Kumar Bist, a first-year
university student.
   Angry students attacked policemen with rocks and tree branches.
Some hurled empty soft drink bottles.
   At least 75 students were arrested, Assistant Police
Commissioner R.K. Neogi said. He did not say if they would be
charged or how long they would be held. Neogi said the students
damaged at least 50 buses.
   Protests started three weeks ago and have spread to six states.
One of the first flashpoints was Bihar, India's poorest state,
where at least three people have died.
   The trouble began when Prime Minister V.P. Singh announced that
the government would reserve an additional 27 percent of public
sector jobs for special categories of low-caste Hindus.
   Some lower castes and tribes already are protected by quotas.
The latest plan would bring reserved jobs to 49 percent, leaving 51
percent of government jobs awarded on merit.
   Singh said ``disadvantaged communities'' comprise 52 percent of
India's 880 million people but have only 12.5 percent of government
jobs.
   His plan angered students from higher castes, who called it
``reverse discrimination'' that would hurt their chances of finding
work after graduation. Government jobs are prized because they
provide security and benefits, such as free housing.
   Hindus have a complex social system with hundreds of castes and
subcastes that divide them into a rigid hierarchy. High-caste
Hindus usually are better off economically.
   Discrimination on the basis of caste is banned by law, but the
system still permeates Indian society, especially in rural areas.
   Successive governments have tried to discard the caste system,
but caste practices have persisted in this nation, which is 85
percent Hindu.

   More than 3 inches of rain fell in two
hours today in the West Virginia mountains, flooding roads, homes
and businesses and apparently washing away tiny trout from a fish
hatchery, authorities said.
   About 35 homes near Marlinton, in the eastern part of the state,
suffered minor damage, said county emergency services Director
Richard Barlow.
   Rising water flooded the hatchery's concrete-lined ponds and
washed away about 30,000 fingerling trout, said Don Phares,
director the the state's trout hatchery program.
   ``The good news is we didn't have a lot of trout in the area
that was flooded. The bad news is we lost those that we did have
there,'' Phares said.
   As a result, some lakes and streams may have to be stocked in
the fall with fewer three-inch trout, he said.
   Stoney Creek near Marlinton overran its banks early today,
covering U.S. 219 with a foot of water and flooding a state garage
and a building supply store, authorities said.
   A flash flood warning also was in effect for parts of Webster
County as the Elk River neared flood stage, the National Weather
Service said.
   Rain could continue tonight in the mountainous regions of West
Virginia, but skies should start clearing this weekend, Charleston
meteorologist Jerry Orchanian said.
   In Wayne County, meanwhile, residents still are cleaning up from
flash floods Wednesday that damaged more than two dozen homes near
East Lynn. Jack Ross lost more than 100 chickens, a source of food
for his and other families in the area.
   ``I went down to the chicken house trying to get them out but
they went up in their roosts and I couldn't get to them,'' Ross
said. ``People say they are lying in the creek all the way to the
end.''
   Today's flooding came one day after the one-year annivesary of
floods that washed out roads, swept away cars and trucks and
destroyed property in central West Virginia.
   On Aug. 23, 1989, 5 inches of rain fell in one hour. No one was
seriously injured in that flooding.

   A biotechnology watchdog who blames the deaths
of 27 Americans directly on gene splicing asked the Food and Drug
Administration today to stop approving genetically engineered
products.
   ``This is the first case on record directly connecting the
recombinant DNA process to the death and injury of human beings,''
Jeremy Rifkin said Thursday.
   The 27 Americans died after taking L-tryptophan, which is sold
in health food stores as a remedy for insomnia, appetite control
and depression. They were among 1,500 Americans who developed an
unusual blood disorder called eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, or EMS.
   It is characterized by muscle and joint pain, breathing
difficulties, swelling and rashes. The FDA ordered all L-tryptophan
off the market in March after the substance was implicated as the
illness's cause.
   In a report in the Aug. 9 New England Journal of Medicine,
doctors in the Minnesota Department of Public Health linked the
deaths to a single manufacturer's use of a new strain of
genetically altered bacteria or the maker's reliance on less carbon
to filter out impurities.
   Rifkin said that study and another unpublished study link the
deaths directly to the genetic engineering process.
   The president of the Washington-based Foundation on Economic
Trends, he has been a persistent critic of biotechnology, calling
for more stringent regulation and using legal tactics to force the
government to respond.
   He sent a petition to the FDA today asking it to stop its
approvals of genetically engineered products. The petition does not
ask for a recall of existing products, he said.
   The study's authors did not link genetic engineering with the
deaths.
   ``Based on our data, we don't have sufficient information to say
whether it was the strain or the amount of powdered carbon that
contributed most,'' said Dr. Edward Belongia, one of the that
study's authors.
   ``And until we have more information about what the specific
impurity was that's triggering EMS, how that impurity arose and how
it's synthesized, it's very difficult to make any statement about
what needs to be done to make sure it doesn't happen in the
future.''
   Rifkin said that part of the support for his petition comes from
an article submitted to Science by the Minnesota researchers but
not yet published. He said he did not have a copy of the Science
article.
   The L-tryptophan was made by Showa Denko K.K. of Japan. The
company inserted a new gene, through genetic engineering, into
strains of the bacteria Bacillus amyloliquefaciens to enable the
bacteria to produce L-tryptophan.
   In the strain linked to disease, the inserted gene ``probably
coupled with another tryptophan gene in the bacteria and increased
the contaminant in the process that killed the 27 Americans,''
Rifkin said.
   Rifkin's petition also asks that the FDA label all genetically
engineered products now on the market, and that it assess the risks
of genetically engineered products in light of the new data.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Calls Gorbachev Decree a `Mistake'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian
republic, said today that Mikhail S. Gorbachev made a mistake by
nullifying the republic's bid to control its vast natural
resources, a news agency reported.
   Gorbachev issued a presidential decree Thursday invalidating a
resolution passed by the Russian parliament's presidium to seize
control of the republic's raw materials, such as gold and diamonds,
from the central Soviet government.
   Yeltsin, one of Gorbachev's most outspoken critics, said the
decree was a blow to their efforts at cooperation.
   ``The movement toward each other is not easy,'' Yeltsin told the
independent Interfax news agency in an interview from South
Sakhalinsk, a Pacific coast city he is visiting as part of a
barnstorming tour across the Russian republic, the largest in the
Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev's decree also was denounced by Russian parliament
leader Vladimir Isakov who told the official Tass news agency that
Gorbachev, the Soviet president, overstepped his authority.
   Yeltsin said he believed Gorbachev had the right to cancel the
parliament's decision because it was a resolution by the body's
presidium and not an act of the full legislature.
   But he said it was ``another mistake'' by Gorbachev who was
``infringing on Russia's sovereignty,'' Interfax reported.
   The Russian parliament acted because ``we saw that hard currency
and gold were slipping away from Russia, but we do not know through
what channels, where, to whom, and how much,'' Yeltsin was quoted
as saying.
   ``This begins to look like crime. I think a special deputies'
commission will have to be established to look into the matter and
tell the people how much gold was exported, where it went and what
purposes it served,'' he added.
   Russia had declared invalid all contracts, signed without its
approval, to sell the republic's diamonds, metals, oil, gas,
uranium and even any manufactured product it considers strategic.
   The Aug. 10 declaration had thrown into question scores of
lucrative contracts, including a $5 billion diamond deal with the
De Beers firm, the leading diamond export dealer.
   But on Thursday, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Filshin
said the republic had now decided to honor all agreements, even
those forged without its consent, Interfax reported.
   He specifically mentioned the diamond contract, which was
considered lucrative to both the republic and the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev said Russia's initial stand could have caused
``serious damage to the country's interests, by complicating
possibilities to buy goods and win credits, which are needed so
badly amid current economic difficulties.
   ``It is effectively directed at undermining the economic
sovereignty of other union republics since it usurps the right to
manage products belonging to the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said Thursday he would meet soon with Yeltsin to
coordinate plans to shift the Soviet Union to a market economy.
   The two men appointed a joint commission this summer to develop
a blueprint for abandoning the centrally planned economy.

   The aunt of President Bush, Nancy

and an ambulance was dispatched there, the White House said.
   The elderly woman, who appeared feeble in a wheelchair this week
at the funeral for Bush's uncle, John Walker, is the sister of
Bush's mother, Dorothy Walker Bush.
   The nature of her illness was not immediately known, said White
House press information officials.
   Bush's personal physician, Dr. Burton Lee, was monitoring her
condition.
   It was not clear whether she would be taken to a hospital or
whether the ambulance actually was needed, said spokesman John
Herrick. He said her condition did not appear to be as bad as
originally thought.

<HEAD>Two Government Ministers Resign in Haiti</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Two Cabinet ministers resigned
today, one day after seven political parties called for the
resignation of President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot and the suspension
of elections.
   Social Affairs Minister Claudette Werleigh and Agriculture
Minister Lionel Richard said their resignation from the president's
13-member Cabinet was effective immediately.
   ``I cannot endorse misappropriation of public funds and
permissiveness towards criminal supporters of dictatorship,'' said
Werleigh, who was appointed in March to the president's interim
government. He did not elaborate or provide evidence to support his
accusations against the president.
   Richard said he had no comment on his reasons for resigning.
   On Thursday, seven of the 12 political organizations that
appointed Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot president in March asked for her
resignation and the postponement of elections, now scheduled for
Nov. 4.
   Last week, the 19-member Council of State called the president
an ``obstacle'' to elections and broke off relations with her. The
Council of State rules alongside Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot. Under the
interim government agreement, the council can veto her Cabinet
appointments and major decisions.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a former Supreme Court judge, was named
to head the interim government with the main task of organizing
elections. She came to power after the fall of Lt. Gen. Prosper
Avril.
   Critics charge her government is corrupt and does not have
control over the army. The uncertain climate led to the recent
return of several former officials linked to the 29-year Duvalier
rule that ended in 1986.
   Many Haitians fear that the return of former officials of the
authoritarian rule will lead to the disruption of the elections.
   Arrests warrants have been issued for two of the former
officials: Roger Lafontant, the reputed head of the dreaded Tonton
Macoute paramilitary police, and Williams Regala, a retired army
officer who is believed responsible for the November 1987 Election
Day massacre of 34 voters at the polls.
   The men remain at large.

   Two boys, ages 13 and 10, were charged
in the sexual assault and murders of two younger boys who were
strangled with their own shoelaces.
   The suspects were not identified because of their ages, but news
reports said one was the 13-year-old brother of one of the victims.
   The naked bodies of Benjamin Hurt, 8, and his friend, Todd Pigg
Jr., 7, were found Aug. 14 after a frantic search in the woods
where they had been riding their bicycles. Authorities said the
boys were strangled with their shoelaces.
   ``We think they were sexually motivated crimes,'' said police
Chief Patrick McCarrick at a news conference Thursday.
   The older suspect was charged with two counts of second-degree
murder and two counts of sodomy, he said. The younger suspect faces
a felony charge of hindering prosecution.
   ``Action has already been initiated to appropriately deal with
the respective juveniles given the gravity of the alleged
offenses,'' said Maj. Thomas O'Conner, who headed the St. Louis
Major Case Squad's investigation.
   He declined to give details.
   Under Missouri law, a youth must be 14 years old to be certified
for trial as an adult. The suspects were in juvenile custody
Thursday after being arrested Wednesday and authorities said their
parents were cooperating with investigators.
   Neighbors who were stunned at the news of the crimes were
shocked with the arrests of the young suspects.
   ``Those dear little boys, what terrible, terrible deaths they
had,'' said Pauline Boucher, who lives down the street from Todd's
family and around the corner from the Hurts. ``To think it was a
13-year-old boy _ it's just terrible.''
   ``I know the Hurt family. We used to live next door to them,''
said Amy Seiler, a 16-year-old high school student. ``All the kids
used to just go out and play and they were just normal kids.''
   Seiler was taking a water break during a mid-day softball
practice in Kiwanis Park, across the road from the woods where Todd
and Ben were found.
   Across the road from the park, yellow police tape still blocked
off bike paths leading into the dense woods that neighborhood kids
call ``the trails.''
   ``It's definitely scary down here,'' Seiler said.
   The woods where the bodies were found were in the same area
where another boy, Scott Kleeschulte, 9, vanished more than two
years ago. Police said they saw no connection between last week's
murders and the 1988 disappearance.

   Iraq is detaining about 100 American diplomats
and dependents who fled to Baghdad from the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait,
the Bush administration said today.
   So far, Iraq has not directly linked closing the embassy in
Kuwait City to permitting the Americans in Baghdad to leave Iraq, a
U.S. official said. But others said their plight obviously was tied
to the dispute over the embassy, which the Iraqis have said must be
closed today.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, with President Bush in
Kennebunkport, Maine, called on Iraq ``to permit and facilitate the
immediate departure'' of the Americans from Baghdad.
   He said Iraqi troops were at the embassy in Kuwait and were not
allowing anyone to leave or enter the building. However, Fitzwater
said, ``they have not made any move against the embassy or intruded
in any fashion,'' the spokesman said.
   Appeals through the night to the Iraqi government in Washington
and in Baghdad failed to break the deadlock, officials in
Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The Associated
Press.
   One denounced the holdup as ``contrary to explicit commitments.''
   The officials also said that about a dozen Iraqi soldiers
appeared overnight at the embassy in Kuwait City. ``They are not
surrounding it. The situation seems to be fluctuating,'' an
official said.
   Fitzwater said the Americans were supposed to go to Turkey. That
was the first disclosure of their projected destination.
   Left behind at the embassy was a group of about a dozen U.S.
diplomats headed by Ambassador Nathaniel Howell.
   Diplomats from a number of other governments who also fled to
Baghdad from Kuwait City also are stranded in the Iraqi capital,
the official said.
   ``We have been working all night, here and in Baghdad, to
pressure the Iraqi government to rescind the order,'' an official
said, adding he did not expect a prompt resolution of the dispute.
   About 100 are in the group, including nearly 30 children. They
made the trip from Kuwait City in a 33-car caravan, arriving in
Baghdad early today after a journey of nearly 20 hours.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had promised them safe passage
even though 2,500 private U.S. citizens in Kuwait and more than 500
in Iraq are being refused permission to leave.
   Howel and the other U.S. diplomats left behind in Kuwait City
are under instruction to keep the embassy open in spite of an order
by Saddam that it close by the end of today and shift operations to
Baghdad.
   Their primary mission is to keep in touch with the Americans
trapped in the country and termed hostages by President Bush.
   A number of other nations, faced with the same order to close,
also will try to keep their embassies open.
   According to reports, Iraqi troops surrounded at least five
embassies in Kuwait City this morning.
   Iraq has said keeping embassies open would amount to an ``act of
aggression'' and that diplomats would no longer be protected by
diplomatic immunity, meaning they could be rounded up and held as
hostages.
   The State Department on Thursday said Jordan's border with Iraq
had been closed. Jordan's King Hussein has been critical of Bush's
dispatch of troops to Saudi Arabia.
   Even so, thousands of refugees were able to cross, and the
Jordanian interior ministry said today the border would be open.
   The king has cast himself in the role of diplomatic middleman.
He has flown to Yemen to try to launch mediation.
   One of the Americans evacuated from the embassy was injured in a
collision and was left behind to be hospitalized in Kuwait City.
Her identity was not disclosed.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Government Cites Pilot Error in Crash That Killed Leland</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The plane crash in Ethiopia that killed Rep.
Mickey Leland, D-Texas, and 15 others last year probably was caused
by pilot error, an Ethiopian government investigation found.
   The Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority said the pilot may have
felt pressured to fly in bad weather because of the ``importance of
the mission.''
   The report was released today by the National Transportation
Safety Board, which assisted in the investigation. A Canadian
safety expert also participated because the plane was built in
Canada.
   Leland, who was chairman of the House Select Committee on
Hunger, was flying from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa to
Fugnido, a refugee camp on the Sudanese border, to inspect relief
efforts. Three congressional staffers also were killed in the crash.
   The plane ran into a mountainside more than an hour after
takeoff Aug. 7, 1989. The crash destroyed an emergency transmitter
on the plane that could have helped rescuers. The wreckage wasn't
found for a week.
   ``The accident was most probably due to pilot error in that, by
pushing too far and flying into an area of bad weather at very low
altitude, the flight crew may have failed to maintain visual
contact with the ground and unknowingly collided with a mountain,''
the report said.
   The report said the plane, a 1980 Twin Otter, had no defects.
Investigators faulted the pilot and flight crew for not properly
studying weather along the route.
   The report said the flight schedule was tight considering the
weather. Organizers of the trip, including Leland, and the flight
crew discussed delays caused by the weather, the report said.
   ``The long delay on the one hand and the importance of the
mission on the other may have created undue pressure and uneasiness
on the flight crew,'' it said.
   The intended route was cloudy and rainy. The plane was plotted
to fly at 12,500 feet and the pilot acknowledged reaching that
altitude shortly after takeoff.
   But witnesses who saw the plane about 25 miles before it crashed
told authorities it was flying below the clouds at a low altitude.
The plane burned after crashing into a boulder 800 feet below the
summit of a mountain.
   The report said investigators could not determine whether the
pilot or co-pilot was flying the plane when it crashed.
   Leland was making his second trip to the border region to focus
attention on the hunger needs of Sudanese whose homes had been
ruined by civil war.

   indicted today under a federal anti-corruption law banning
acceptance of money or gifts in return for votes or favors.
   State Reps. Robert Kohn, Luther Taylor, Robert Brown, Danny
Winstead and state Sen. Rick Lee were all indicted under the Hobbs
Act. Winstead also was indicted on a second count of obstruction of
justice, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Barton said.
   The indictments followed Brown's resignation Thursday and
Circuit Judge Tee Ferguson being temporarily suspended from his
duties as a judge.
   The federal Hobbs Act bans taking money or gifts in return for
votes or favors. Conviction carries a maximum penalty of 20 years
in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Lee, 37, who served in the House from 1979 to 1984 and in the
Senate since 1985, has been charged with promising to support a
bill that would have let voters decide whether they wanted
pari-mutuel betting in South Carolina. The indictment charges Lee
received a $2,000 payment for his support of the bill.
   There was no indication of where the $2,000 payment originated.
   Winstead, 44, was indicted on two counts. The first alleges he
``knowingly and intentionally attempted to commit extortion'' in
connection with the pari-mutuel bill. It also charges that Winstead
``by extortion'' got a $1,000 cash payment ``from and with the
consent'' of Ron Cobb, a lobbyist reported to have been involved in
the FBI investigation within the legislation.
   The indictment alleges that on or about July 20, Winstead ``did
knowingly and intentionally attempt corruptly'' to persuade Kohn
``with intent to influence'' Kohn's testimony in an ``official
proceeding.''
   According to the indictments, Brown, 34, allegedly promised to
support the pari-mutuel bill and to work ``behind the scenes'' for
passage in exchange for $2,000. The indictment allegedly took the
payment on or about April 19.
   Brown has served in the House since 1983. He was chairman of the
Labor, Commerce and Industry Committee until his resignation
Thursday.
   The indictment said Taylor, 40, and Kohn, 45, allegedly agreed
to be paid to vote for the pari-mutuel bill.
   They allegedly agreed to become members of a ``core group'' of
legislators working to pass the bill in 1990.
   The indictment states that about Oct 17, 1989, Kohn met with
Cobb in a room at the Town House Hotel in Columbia where they
discussed the possiblity of the bill's passage. About Jan. 10, Kohn
met with Cobb and indicated he would support the bill for $10,000,
the indictment said. He also reportedly told Cobb that another
House member could help move the bill offthe contested calendar.
   ``The investigation is continuing and more indictments will be
handed down in the next few months,'' said U.S. Attorney Bart
Daniel.
   The probe has been under way for 16 months, according to John C.
Harley Jr., FBI special agent in charge.
   Harley verified earlier reports that the FBI used a fictitious
organization referred to as the Alpha Group based in Atlanta as a
business front. He said the FBI received cooperation from Cobb and
Kohn and that Cobb is at an unidentified location.
   In his resignation letter Thursday to House Speaker Bob Sheheen,
Brown wrote: ``I hope my work and dedication to improving the
quality of life in my county and our state will not be totally
overshadowed by any mistakes I have made.''
   Ferguson, who served in the House of Representatives for six
years until his election to judge this spring, asked to be
suspended ``until such time as the matter concerning alleged votes
for cash is resolved in so far as it seeks to implicate me.''
   Chief Justice George Gregory suspended him until Jan. 7. A woman
who answered the phone in Ferguson's office Thursday said he would
not comment.
   Sources have said the FBI set up a sting operation in which
former House member-turned lobbyist Cobb, working undercover,
offered lawmakers cash in exchange for votes on legislation to
legalize pari-mutuel betting in South Carolina.
   Brown's committee approved that legislation in 1989.
   In late July, shortly after news of the investigation surfaced,
Brown filed an amended campaign report that disclosed he had
received $2,500 cash from Cobb in either April or May. The reports
were due in June.
   At the time, Brown denied he took the money in exchange for his
vote. ``I've never taken a dime with strings attached,'' he said.

<HEAD>Aide Says Quayle Following Mideast Crisis During His Vacation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle is closely following
the crisis in the Middle East while vacationing in Arizona, a
spokesman said Friday.
   ``He's in daily contact with what's going on,'' said spokesman
Craig Whitney. ``He knows all the developments.''
   Quayle, his wife and their three children are spending most of
the month at his parents' vacation home in Wickenburg, Ariz.
   ``I'm sure some golf is possible, but the vice president wanted
a chance to spend time with his wife and family,'' Whitney said.
   The spokesman said Quayle's staff in Washington is monitoring
developments in the Middle East and in Kennebunkport, Maine, where
President Bush is vacationing.
   ``The vice president receives all of the paperwork and
communications out there that he would if he were here,'' Whitney
said.
   Quayle returned to Washington for two days last week and was
briefed by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. He had a lengthy
conversation earlier this week with Brent Scowcroft, Bush's chief
national security adviser.
   ``I'm sure he has talked with the president but I can't tell you
how many times or when,'' Whitney said.
   The vice president ``was in on the early meetings where a lot of
the strategy was charted'' on how the United States would respond
to Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, Whitney said. Quayle left Washington
on Aug. 11, more than a week after the invasion.
   Quayle's next scheduled public appearance is a speech to the
75th annual convention of the American Legion in Indianapolis on
Tuesday. Whitney said Quayle had not decided whether to return to
Washington immediately after that speech or delay his return until
later in the week.

   A federal judge today struck down provisions
of Pennsylvania's abortion law that helped make it the most
restrictive in the country.
   Senior U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Huyett 3d ruled on
challenges to the law by Planned Parenthood of Southeastern
Pennsylvania and five abortion providers.
   Huyett struck down portions of the law that require a woman to
notify her husband before getting an abortion; wait 24 hours before
getting an abortion; and require minors to obtain the consent of at
least one parent, or a court order, before an abortion.
   The U.S. territory of Guam had banned all abortions except where
the mother's life is threatened. A federal judge ruled that law
unconstitutional Wednesday.
   In the Pennsylvania ruling, the judge said that requiring
parental notification ``unduly burdens a minor woman's right to
elect to end her preganancy.''
   Attorneys for both sides have said they would probably file
appeals first to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and
eventually the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``Safe, legal abortion continues to be accessible to women in
Pennsyvlania because of the court's decision today,'' said
Elizabeth Hrenda-Roberts, executive director of Planned Parenthood
Pennsylvania Affiliates.
   ``Pennsylvanians would be well served if the Commonwealth
accepts this decision and stops squandering taxpayer's money to
promote government interference in personal matters and threaten
women's lives,'' she said.
   Robert Gentzel, a spokesman for state Attorney General Ernie
Preate Jr., said the ruling would be appealed within 30 days.
   ``Judge Huyett's decision is disappointing but not unexpected.
It is the attorney general's duty to defend the constitutionality
of state statutes and he intends to pursue all appropriate appeals,
including appealing to the United States Supreme Court if
necessary,'' Gentzel said.
   Huyett quoted Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun's warning
about eroding abortion rights: ``The signs are evident and very
ominous, and a chill wind blows.''
   ``What the future holds is not certain,'' Huyett said. ``But one
thing must be evident. Individuals can no longer feel as secure
with the protections provided by the judiciary in this area.
Instead, a woman's privacy rights and individual autonomy may soon
be subjected to the vicissitudes of the legislative process.''
   Abortion opponents want to use the case to return the abortion
issue to the U.S. Supreme Court to provide it with an opportunity
to reverse the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion.
   Gentzel called the Pennsylvania law ``a reasonable, responsible
approach to dealing with a very difficult question. The Legislature
and governor were fully aware when this statute was enacted and
signed that it would face challenges, and that those challenges
would take time to resolve.''
   Huyett also ruled in the clinics' favor in their challenge of
the state's definition of medical emergency, which the clinic said
was too vague and would leave doctors in a quandary.
   Most of the the disputed parts of the law were suspended pending
Huyett's ruling. Some of the sections were rewritten from a 1982
statute, much of which was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court in
1986.
   The disputed portions were amendments made in 1988 and 1989 to
the Abortion Control Act, adopted in 1982 following the landmark
ruling of 1973.
   In a three-day trial in Reading earlier this month, lawyers for
the state argued that the law would protect the interests of women
and families.
   The abortion clinic argued that the law would strip women of
dignity, could endanger their health and have a chilling effect on
doctors who perform abortions.
   ``There can be no doubt the challenged provisions burden women's
rights to abortion,'' said Thomas Zemaitis, an attorney for the
clinics.
   The state argued that similar parental-consent laws had been
upheld in other states and that the husband should be told because
the state had ``a legitimate interest in protecting the spouse's
interest.''
   Zemaitis said requiring parental consent ``creates an impossible
ethical dilemma for the minor.'' He said anyone who arranges for an
abortion has already thought it through and that the waiting period
was written in to discourage abortions.

   Iraqi troops patrolled near the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait City and at least seven others today, and a
European envoy said Baghdad threatened to use force to remove
diplomats remaining at their posts Saturday.
   The White House, meanwhile, said lraq had reneged on its promise
toallow U.S. Embassy personnel to leave Baghdad and was detaining
them. The more than 100 American men, women and children had left
the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait and were staying in the U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad, said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said Iraqi military forces ``of one kind or another
are around the embassy'' in Kuwait, where Ambassador Nathaniel
Howell and a handful of aides remained.
   ``They have not made any moves against the embassy or intruded
in any fashion, but they are nevertheless present. It would appear
that people are not being allowed to enter or leave the embassy,''
Fitzwater said at a briefing in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Iraq, which invaded and annexed Kuwait earlier this month, has
given foreign governments until 9 p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) today to vacate
their embassies in Kuwait. Diplomats in Washington, however, said
that deadline had been extended to midnight.
   Baghdad said keeping embassies open would amount to an ``act of
aggression'' and that diplomats would no longer be protected by
diplomatic immunity, meaning they could be rounded up and held as
hostages.
   Spain's Ambassador to Amman, Ramon Armengod, told a news
conference in Madrid today that Iraqi authorities told Western
embassies in Kuwait that they now had until 8:30 a.m. Saturday
(12:30 a.m. EDT) to close.
   He said that after that deadline, Iraqi troops would forcibly
remove remaining Western diplomats from their missions.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said Iraqi soldiers
told the two Japanese diplomats remaining in Kuwait today that
their diplomatic immunity had been revoked but made no attempt to
remove them from the embassy.
   There were conflicting reports of the extent of troop activity
around embassies.
   Officials reported that troops were surrounding or patrolling
near the American, British, French, Japanese, Norwegian, Swedish,
Romanian and Hungarian embassies. The officials said they received
the information from their embassy personnel in Kuwait.
   Ambassador Howell and a dozen other Americans stayed at the
palm-shaded American compound, a rectangle facing a six-lane
highway bordering the Persian Gulf. Marine guards were among 33
carloads of embassy personnel who drove to the Iraqi capital
Baghdad on Thursday.
   The United States, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Austria and the
12 European Community nations were among those who announced they
would defy the order and remain in the occupied oil-rich kingdom.
   Britain's Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said today the soldiers
posted outside the British Embassy ``appear to have instructions
not to allow people in or out.''
   He said British staff there would decide for themselve how to
oppose the Iraqis.
   ``I don't expect, no one expects, unarmed diplomats to give
physical resistance to physical force,'' he said.
   ``We don't know how many soldiers there are, their intentions,
but there must be a lot, enough to completely surround the entire
building,'' said Bjoern Blokhus, a Norwegian Foreign Ministry
spokesman commenting on the situation at the embassy in Kuwait.
   Blokhus said the Iraqi soldiers had made no move against the
diplomatic personnel inside the embassy.
   Egypt took one of most defiant stances, announcing Thursday that
it would not close its embassy or reduce its staff of 20.
   In Cairo, four truckloads of riot police remained outside the
Iraqi Embassy where they have been stationed since the Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.
   Soviet officials said in Moscow they had evacuated all of their
embassy personnel from Kuwait, but that they did not consider the
mission closed.
   The Philippines, India and Lebanon are among those nations why
said they would obey the order and close. About 60 countries have
embassies in Kuwait.
   Personnel at the Western embassies were reduced to a symbolic
few. Staff and dependents from many embassies left Kuwait City over
the past few day.
   Fitzwater said Thursday that the U.S. diplomats would remain in
Kuwait ``as long as there are Americans they can assist.''
   About 3,000 Americans are among the 21,000 westerners stranded
and threatened in Iraq and Kuwait. There are also about 3,000
Britons.
   The U.S. and British embassies are along the same corniche as
those of Saudi Arabia, U.A.E., Qatar, Egypt, Lebanon, India,
Jordan, Turkey.
   Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry rejected Iraq's demand Thursday
that missions close, but the Saudi embassy has been locked since
the invasion and the ambassador is back in the kingdom.
   Travelers from Kuwait have reported that scores of nationals
from Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates have sought sanctuary in
their embassies. The respective ambassadors have been trying
unsuccessfully to organize evacuation convoys.

   The heavy demand for gas masks from
Middle Eastern distributors has forced a Barcelona firm to cut
short vacations and begin round-the-clock production, one of the
company's owners says.
   Jeroni Llorca of Llorca Protective Systems said Thursday the
company planned to start producing its new Vispro civilian-use gas
mask in September. But frantic calls from distributors in Saudi
Arabia, Jordan, Syria and Israel persuaded the firm to begin
immediately.
   Llorca said employees were producing about 1,500 of the masks a
day. He expected his first shipment to go out Sept. 15.

<HEAD>Britain Hands Over `Birth Certificate' to Australia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ninety years after it officially
became a commonwealth, Australia has received its ``birth
certificate.''
   British Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe on Thursday
night handed Prime Minister Bob Hawke one of the two originals of
the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act.
   That was the legislation, passed by the British Parliament on
July 5, 1900, which turned six colonies into the Commonwealth of
Australia.
   Although the document has been on loan in Parliament House here
for the last two years, it has taken a lot of tough talking with
the British, from Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher down, to turn
the loan into ownership.
   The problem for the British was that in giving the document
away, it may have created a huge precedent.
   As Howe said, Britain's constitutional archives were preserved
in an unbroken series stretching back to the 13th century and were
a cherished part of its heritage. Never before had an original copy
of a British act been given away.
   So carefully guarded was the collection that it required an act
of the British Parliament before it could be handed over.

   While the Middle East situation deteriorates,
comics Jay Leno and Johnny Carson managed some laughs.
   ``Ever thought you would see the day when you would miss the
Ayatollah?'' Leno asked Wednesday on ``The Tonight Show With Johnny
Carson.''
   ``President Bush has frozen Iraq's assets and he's seeking the
proper economic sanctions to punish them,'' Leno continued. ``How
about putting all their assets in the savings and loans, then
they'll be real sorry.''
   The comic also made this observation: ``I notice we haven't had
any oil spills since it got so expensive.''
   Roseanne Barr's name has also come up in connection with the
Middle East conflict.
   The Washington gag goes that President Bush will name Miss Barr
U.S. ambassador to Iraq, according to columnist Liz Smith.
   Carson picked up the theme Thursday. He suggested the United
States send over a secret weapon _ Miss Barr singing the Iraqi
national anthem.
   A new song by country singer Hank Williams Jr. _ ``Don't Give Us
a Reason'' _ has been getting air time. One lyric goes:
   ``And if you take some innocent lives, that's when the fur
really flies,
   ``Hey man, back off and get smart, don't give us a reason.
   ``Don't give us a reason to come gunning for you,
   ``Cuz the odds don't look so good, your neck is in a noose ...''
   And what about a USO Tour to the Middle East? Television's
``Entertainment Tonight'' says Hollywood celebrities are being
lined up for a trip, but the USO says names and details are being
kept secret for security reasons.
   Bob Hope, who went to the Middle East several years ago with Lee
Greenwood, Connie Stevens and others to entertain military
personnel, said he has no plans to take a USO Tour to Saudi Arabia.
   ``Palm Springs is my desert,'' the 87-year-old Hope said
Thursday. ``The only way I'm going to the desert is going to Palm
Springs.''

   Masked Palestinian activists bludgeoned an Arab
man to death Friday in the occupied Gaza Strip following
accusations he collaborated with Israeli security agents, Arab
reports said.
   Arab reporters identified the victim as Abdul Fattah Gharableh.
They said he was visiting relatives in the Rafah refugee camp when
he was attacked.
   The victim had a gun and held off his attackers for about 10
minutes before he ran out of ammunition, the report said. The gang
then beat him to death with sticks and iron bars, they said.
   Gharableh's father was slightly wounded by his son's gunfire,
but none of his assailiants was hit.
   The army said it had no information on the incident.
   Gharableh's death raised to 249 the number of Palestinians slain
by fellow Arabs since the uprising against Israeli rule in the
occupied territories began in December 1987. Most have been accused
of collaborating with Israeli officials or dealing in drugs or
prostitution.
   An additional 728 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
soldiers or civilians during the revolt, and 45 Israelis have died
in the violence.

   Thousands of students protesting a
government plan to reserve jobs for low-caste Hindus hijacked buses
and clashed with police Friday.
   The students surged into streets, stopping traffic and urging
motorists to join their campaign. Arriving at the Parliament aboard
dozens of hijacked buses, they tried to storm or encircle the
building.
   ``We don't want the politicians to come out of the Parliament.
Let them perish there,'' said Vinod Kumar Bist, a first-year
university student.
   Police beat back the protesters with steel-tipped bamboo poles,
set up rope and metal barricades and repeatedly fired tear gas.
   Traffic was paralyzed as the protests spread to major streets
and intersections throughout the capital of 8 million people. Some
protesters hurled stones through the windows of government
buildings.
   Demonstrations began three weeks ago and have spread to a
half-dozen states. One of the first flashpoints was Bihar, India's
poorest state, where at least three people have died.
   The trouble began when Prime Minister V.P. Singh announced this
month that the government would reserve an additional 27 percent of
public sector jobs for categories of low-caste Hindus.
   That would bring to 49 percent the share of government jobs
reserved for lower castes and tribes. The rest are awarded on merit.
   Singh, a high-caste Hindu, has warned that low-caste Hindus must
be given government help in getting jobs to head off unrest. Singh
said ``disadvantaged communities'' comprise 52 percent of India's
880 million people but have only 12.5 percent of government jobs.
   His plan angered students from higher castes, who called it
reverse discrimination that would hurt their chances of finding
work after graduation. Government jobs are prized because they
provide security and benefits, such as free housing.
   The students shouted ``Down with V.P. Singh!''
   Some chased a police dog in an attempt to place a sign reading
``I am V.P. Singh'' around its neck.
   Hindus, who make up 85 percent of India's population, have a
complex social system with hundreds of castes and subcastes that
divide them into a rigid hierarchy. High-caste Hindus usually are
better off economically than members of low castes.
   Discrimination on the basis of caste is outlawed, but it
persists, especially in rural areas. In many villages, for example,
lower castes and outcasts live in segregated quarters and cannot
take water from wells used by upper castes.
   As the students shouted anti-government slogans and burned their
university degree certificates near Parliament, a street sweeper
from a lower caste rested his broom to watch.
   ``There is no need for the drama,'' said the sweeper, Ram
Prasad. ``We low-caste Hindus have suffered enough. Time has come
to get our due share.''

   South Korea's supreme court rejected
appeals by a dissident lawmaker Friday and upheld espionage charges
against him and a 10-year prison sentence.
   The court ruled that Rep. Suh Kyung-won was quilty of espionage
by leaking state secrets during his trip to communist North Korea.
Suh had claimed that security officials forced him to make false
confessions.
   He said his trip to North Korea was to advance unification of
the divided Korean peninsula, and he denied being a spy.
   With the supreme court's decision, Suh's parliamentary
membership was stripped. Suh was from South Korea's main opposition
group, the Party for Peace and Democracy.
   He was arrested in June 1989. A court sentenced him to 10 years
in prison in April.
   South Korea prohibits unauthorized visits to North Korea,
contending dialogue with communists must be handled through

<HEAD>Pair of College Students Discover Anasazi Village Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVE CREEK, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two college students have stumbled upon
the virtually untouched ruins of a 1,100-year-old Anasazi Indian
village in southwestern Colorado.
   The six-acre Mountain Sheep Village, the name given the site,
probably had about 200 structures and may have housed 150 to 200
Indians as early as the year 850 A.D., said Kristie Arrington, an
archaeologist for the Bureau of Land Management, the agency that
controls the discovery site.
   The discovery is significant because the site is on the north
side of the Dolores River, which wraps around it on three sides.
Previously, Anasazi ruins have been found only south of the river.
   The Anasazi, or ``Ancient Ones,'' lived in the Four Corners
area. Their best-known ruins are the cliff dwellings in Mesa Verde
National Park in southwestern Colorado. The site discovered earlier
this month by the University of Colorado students is about 60 miles
northwest of Mesa Verde, not far from the Utah border.
   Pottery fragments recovered at the site discovered by Dave
Merritt and Chris Kuzawa date the site about 300 years before the
height of Mesa Verde cliff dwellings.
   Arrington said the people of Mountain Sheep Village may have
traded big game and timber with other villages in exchange for food
and pottery. She said tools associated with game procurement and
processing, such as arrowheads, scrapers and knives, have been
found on the ground.
   ``Local people hunting may have been through there and one area
shows evidence that it had been `potted' a little bit,'' said
Arrington. ``But it's fairly unusual that it hadn't been recorded
and documented before now.''
   Potting is a term used to describe the illegal digging for
Indian pots.
   Merritt and Kuzawa are working out of the Dolores Canyon
Research Center on a federal archaeology project this summer. The
project involves tracking desert bighorn sheep and river otters,
conducting an inventory of water invertebrates in the river and
probing historic mining sites.
   The two were tracking bighorn sheep with another student,
Patricia Dahnke, when they discovered the ruins.
   ``We were just hiking around and we found it,'' Merritt said.
``We were just climbing up, following bits of ceramics and lithic
(flint), which were at the base of the cliffs where they shouldn't
be.''
   They struggled over the rim of a cliff and found mounds and
vertical slabs of sandstone sticking out of the ground.
   The slabs are the foundations of structures made of poles, brush
and adobe.
   ``It was pretty spectacular,'' Kuzawa said of the site, which
backs up to a forest of ponderosa pine. ``Once we realized what it
was, we started to look around. We stayed until dusk. We knew we
were on to something pretty big.''

   Earl Summers Jr., the last original
member of the Wheeling Symphony Orchestra, wants to jazz up his
life now that he's stepped away from classical music.
   The 74-year-old violinist retired after Thursday's symphony
performance, during which he played some of his favorite classical,
jazz and country ``hoedown'' music before 7,000 people at the
Wheeling Civic Center.
   Summers worked hard at his music from age 12, when he first put
on a tuxedo to perform at the 1928 opening of the Wheeling
Symphony. He joined while studying under his father, who headed the
string section.
   After 62 years with the symphony, however, ``everyone's younger
than I am,'' Summers said.
   He said he will focus on jazz in his retirement, especially the
music of tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins.
   ``Jazz is easier,'' Summers said. ``You always have to practice
the classical music all the time. I just don't want to work that
hard anymore.''

<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim, shunned for years
by Western leaders because of his wartime past, arrived in Jordan
today en route to Iraq for talks with Saddam Hussein about freeing
foreign hostages.
   Waldheim was to meet with Jordan's King Hussein, then fly to
Baghdad on Saturday, his office said. Waldheim would be the first
Western leader to meet the Iraqi president face-to-face since Iraqi
troops invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   A Jordanian official said the king ``might accompany Mr.
Waldheim to Iraq for a short mini-summit,'' in Baghdad. He would
not elaborate.
   Waldheim received a warm welcome from the king and other senior
officials at Amman's military air base.
   In Vienna, Waldheim's office said he would try to use contacts
from his tenure as U.N. secretary-general ``to seek in personal
meetings a safe return as soon as possible of the (foreign)
citizens to their homelands,'' said a statement issued by the
president's office in Vienna.
   During his 10 years as U.N. chief, Waldheim was personally
acquainted with Arab leaders, including Saddam.
   In four years as Austrian president, Waldheim has visited
Kuwait, Syria and Jordan. Because of his wartime past, no Western
governments have invited him for official visits.
   During World War II, Waldheim served with a German army unit in
the Balkans implicated in atrocities, and later misrepresented his
war record.
   Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock, who is currently visiting
Amman, said in an Austrian television interview Thursday that
Waldheim would ``bring to bear his exceptional standing in the Arab
world.''
   There are about 21,000 Westerners stranded in Iraq and Kuwait,
including 3,000 Americans. They have been prevented from leaving
and threatened with being used as human shields around Iraqi
targets.
   About 140 Austrians are in Iraq and Kuwait. So far 30 Austrians
have crossed the Iraqi border into Turkey.

<HEAD>U.S. Embassy in Kuwait: Functional, Not Fancy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Gulf, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait is not a high-tech
stronghold, but rather a practical compound surrounded by a high
wall.
   ``It's not a very fancy embassy, but a very functional one,''
said Francois Dickman, a retired Foreign Service officer who was
U.S. ambassador to Kuwait from 1979 to 1983.
   ``It's not one of the new fortresses that many American
embassies around the world are increasingly,'' said another
diplomat who has served in Kuwait, speaking on the condition of
anonymity.
   The embassy, across a six-lane highway from the beach, has
become the latest storm center of the growing Persian Gulf crisis.
   Its usual contingent of about a half-dozen Marines were
withdrawn Thursday as the Iraqi deadline for the closing foreign
embassies in Kuwait approached.
   Dickman said the decision to withdraw the Marines made sense.
   ``These Marines can't do anything,'' he said. ``They don't
really serve as guards. They man the entrance to the chancery and
in the evening they make sure that things are locked up and provide
elementary security.''
   Dickman, in a telephone interview from his Laramie, Wyo., home,
said the wall around the compound is eight or nine feet high. The
east side of the compound faces Gulf Road, a six-lane highway. Just
east of the highway is the Persian Gulf.
   ``It's not much of a beach,'' Dickman said.
   The only entrance to the compound is a steel gate on the west
side, about 100 feet from the southwest corner.
   The compound includes the chancery, an administration building,
the ambassador's residence, a warehouse, parking lot, garden and
swimming pool.
   The embassy's security system was strengthened after a 1983
terrorist bombing, according to the diplomat who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   ``I suppose a tank, like an Iraqi tank, could get through, but
it has been reinforced, the wall has been upgraded and the entry
gates,'' the diplomat said.
   In the bombing, Shia Moslem terrorists crashed a truck loaded
with gas cylinders through the steel gates. The truck smashed into
the administration building, demolishing it and damaging the
chancery and warehouse, Dickman said.
   None of the six people killed was American.

   The doctor who performed the world's first
successful liver transplant underwent heart surgery today at the
hospital where he has performed hundreds of transplants.
   Surgeons began the coronary artery bypass operation on Thomas E.
Starzl at 7:30 a.m. and finished nearly five hours later at
Presbyterian University Hospital.
   Starzl was in stable condition in the hospital's intensive care
unit.
   ``The surgery was uncomplicated and Dr. Starzl is doing well,''
said Gary Marrone, who led the surgical team.
   On July 9, surgeons removed a blockage from Starzl's right
coronary artery after he complained of chest pains. Doctors said he
was doing well following that operation.
   Starzl, 64, performed the first successful liver transplant in
1967 at the University of Colorado. He also pioneered development
of a medical team that performed 200 kidney transplants at Colorado
General and Denver Veteran's Administration hospitals.
   In 1981, Starzl began work at the University of Pittsburgh,
which he helped make one of the world's premier transplant centers.
Last year, the hospital performed more than 460 liver transplants
and 210 kidney transplants.

<HEAD>Fifteen Arrested in Alleged Ring of Child Sexual Abuse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen family members and friends
were in jail Friday on charges of sexually abusing an 11-year-old
girl and two other children, authorities said.
   ``What we found was nasty business,'' said Neshoba County
Sheriff Hubert G. Waddell. ``When I have to look at these people we
have incarcerated it's hard for me not to vomit.''
   He said the 13 men and two women are charged with capital rape,
which carries a possible sentence of life in prison. Waddell said
the accusations involve fondling and heterosexual and homosexual
acts.
   Two defendants, both in their 70s, were released on $50,000 bond
because of their health, Waddell said. The others either were being
held in lieu of $50,000 bond or without bond pending hearings.
   ``The people involved are mothers, daddies, stepfathers,
ex-fathers,'' said investigator Bobby Anderson of the Philadelphia
Police Department.
   Waddell said the 11-year-old Philadelphia-area girl was sexually
abused by at least nine different adults during the last two to
three years. He said two young boys, whose ages were not given,
also were abused.
   ``I've had to investigate sexual abuse cases but nothing on the
scale of this,'' said Waddell. ``There is a lot of trash involved
and some money did come into the picture.''
   The sheriff said there also was evidence that the parents
allowed the girl to be sexually abused in exchange for liquor and
cigarettes.
   All those charged are from the mostly rural county in
east-central Mississippi and included the parents of the girl and
close relatives of the two boys. There could be additional arrests,
authorities said.
   Waddell said the arrests created a space problem in his already
crowded detention center. He said the jail had been redesigned to
hold 24 people ``we've got 30 in there right now, including five or
six state prisoners.''
   Several county jails in Mississippi are crowded with state
inmates because of federal court orders that limits the number of
prisoners at the state penitentiary at Parchman.
   Waddell said a joint investigation began six weeks ago when his
office and local police ``received a call from a concerned citizen
who told us a baby sitter had called her and wanted her to report
that this little girl had been raped.''
   ``We called in the county welfare department to pick up the girl
and have her checked. They put her in the hospital for treatment
and got a counselor to start working with her.''
   ``I did talk to the girl quite a bit but she was hesitant to
talk to male officers,'' Waddell said. ``It was obvious to me that
she had been abused.''
   Authorities said it appeared the case reached beyond Neshoba
County and that officers in Kemper, Attala and Leake counties are
being forwarded information about abuse that may have taken place
there.
   Neshoba County District Attorney Ken Turner said the case
against the 15 arrested will be presented Nov. 5 to a county grand
jury.

   Duke Kahanamoku, considered the father of modern
surfing, is being honored with a statue. But instead of facing his
beloved ocean, his likeness beckons tourists on the shore.
   The 100th anniversary of Kahanmoku's birth was being marked
Friday with the dedication of a statue in Waikiki.
   Kahanamoku was born in Waikiki in 1890 and died there in 1968.
He fashioned long boards and set out with his friends to ride the
gentle waves of Waikiki as well as the big breakers around the
island.
   Kahanamoku also brought surfing to the mainland. Historians
report he rode a redwood surfboard near a popular pier in Venice,
Calif., in the first decade of the century.
   The statue, by Jan Fisher, is located at Kuhio Beach Park.
   But its placement started a controversy when the city wanted it
facing inland instead of toward the ocean. Family members say the
Duke never would have wanted it that way, as his life revolved
around the water.
   Officials, however, said tourists wouldn't want to face the back
of a statue, so they placed it facing land and the dense line of
hotels on Waikiki beach.
   Kahanamoku competed in four Olympics, winning six medals _ three
gold, two silver and one bronze _ for swimming. He was inducted
into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 1984.

   Iraqi troops today deployed near at least eight embassies in
Kuwait _ including the U.S. mission _ where diplomats were defying
shutdown orders from Baghdad.
   ``They have not made any moves against the embassy or intruded
in any fashion, but they are nevertheless present,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, with President Bush in
Kennebunkport, Maine. ``It would appear that people are not being
allowed to enter or leave the embassy.''
   In other developments in the Persian Gulf crisis, the Pentagon
today began began calling reserve units to active duty to assist in
the U.S. military buildup in the Persian Gulf area, and Austrian
President Kurt Waldheim set off for the Mideast on a peacemaking
mission that was to include a meeting with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, said Iraqi soldiers
told the two Japanese diplomats remaining in Kuwait today that
their diplomatic immunity had been revoked but made no attempt to
remove them from the embassy.
   Amid the brewing embassy standoff, about 100 American diplomats
and dependents who left the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait have been
indefinitely detained in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, officials in
Washington said today.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, linked the
detention of the group to the U.S. refusal to close its embassy in
Kuwait, and said it was ``contrary to explicit commitments'' by
Iraq of free passage for the Americans.
   But another escape route for foreigners remained open _ the
Jordanian border. Jordan had said Wednesday it would close the
frontier with Iraq to refugees, but it allowed thousands of people,
mainly Arabs, to cross today.
   Turkey, however, said it might close its border with Iraq unless
foreign governments made arrangements for speedy transit of
refugees.
   Officials fear an influx of Pakistanis. Since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, 7,532 people have entered from Iraq, officials at the Habur
crossing said. Of these, 3,000 were Turkish workers returning home
and 2,903 were Pakistanis.
   Also today, Western diplomats said they expected the Security
Council to vote today or Saturday on a resolution resolution
allowing the use of military force to put teeth in the U.N. embargo
against Iraq.
   In addition to patrolling near the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait,
Saddam's troops, who invaded the emirate Aug. 2, were out in force
near the British, French, Japanese, Norwegian, Swedish, Romanian
and Hungarian embassies, said diplomatic officials, citing
information from embassies in Kuwait.
   ``We don't know how many soldiers there are, their intentions,
but there must be a lot, enough to completely surround the entire
building,'' said Bjoern Blokhus, a Norwegian Foreign Ministry
spokesman commenting on the situation at his country's embassy in
Kuwait.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry said Iraqi soldiers told the two
Japanese diplomats remaining in Kuwait today that their diplomatic
immunity had been revoked but made no attempt to remove them from
the embassy.
   There was uncertainty about the Iraqi deadline for the embassy
shutdowns.
   The Iraqi News Agency has said foreign governments have until 9
p.m. (1 p.m. EDT) to vacate the 60 embassies in Kuwait. Diplomats
in Washington, however, said the deadline was extended to midnight.
   Spain's ambassador to Jordan, Ramon Armengod, told reporters in
Madrid today that Iraqi authorities were saying foreign embassies
had until 8:30 a.m. Saturday (12:30 a.m. EDT), to close, or they
would be removed by force.
   U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and perhaps a dozen other
Americans stayed at the palm-shaded American compound in Kuwait
City. Concrete barriers and steel spikes are among the security at
the U.S. Embassy complex on Arabian Gulf Boulevard.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters Thursday
at President Bush's summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine, that U.S.
diplomats will remain in Kuwait ``as long as there are Americans
that they can assist.''
   Most U.S. diplomatic personnel were evacuated Thursday. Marine
guards were among 33 carloads of Americans who drove to the Iraqi
capital.
   ``A few Marine guards aren't going to fight off the entire Iraqi
army,'' a senior government official said Thursday in Washington.
   In addition to the United States, those countries ignoring
Iraq's shutdown order included Japan, the 12 European Community
nations, Switzerland and Austria.
   The Dutch ambassador to Kuwait, Joop Veling, was advised by his
Foreign Ministry ``not to engage in any exaggerated heroism,'' a
government spokesman said in the Hague.
   Saddam claimed Kuwait as Iraqi territory after his invasion and
subsequent annexation of his oil-rich southern neighbor. Baghdad
says keeping embassies open in Kuwait would amount to an ``act of
aggression.''
   On Thursday, Saddam appeared on television with British children
and other captives, ruffling the hair of a small boy, smiling and
joking _ but making it plain their fate depends on how the Persian
Gulf confrontation goes.
   He told about 20 adults and children they were ``guests'' being
held ``to prevent the scourge of war.''
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher denounced the TV
display as ``shameful theater.''
   About 3,000 Americans are among the 21,000 Westerners stranded
in Iraq and Kuwait, kept from leaving by Saddam and threatened with
being used as human shields around Iraqi targets.
   In another development Thursday, a U.S. intelligence source
reported that Saddam's elite Republican Guards, which led the
attack into Kuwait, are being replaced on the front lines of his
defenses by other troops.
   But the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
Guards _ numbering perhaps more than 50,000 according to NBC News _
could still be used in an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia from Kuwait.
   It was fear of such an attack that prompted the United States to
mount the multinational Operation Desert Shield in the Saudi desert
to protect the kingdom and its huge oil reserves.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Thursday approved plans to
call 10,000 military reservists to active duty over the next week
and nearly 50,000 by October to support the deployment of U.S.
troops, ships and warplanes to the Persian Gulf.
   The U.S. aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower and six escort
ships sailed through Egypt's Suez Canal today en route from the Red
Sea to the Mediterranean canal officials said. The Eisenhower
apparently was relieved by the carrier Saratoga in the Red Sea and
may be relieved in the Mediterranean by the carrier Kennedy, which
left Virginia last week.
   The U.S. Navy has a total of 37 ships either in the gulf or en
route, an unofficial count showed. Among them were four aircraft
carrier battle groups and the battleship Wisconsin.
   Waldheim's office said he was flying to Amman today for talks
with Jordan's King Hussein, and would travel to Baghdad Saturday
for a meeting with Saddam.
   The Austrian president has been shunned by Western leaders
because of his wartime past, but has maintained friendly ties with
Arab leaders including Saddam.

   Turkey, feeling the strain of a refugee
influx from neighboring Iraq, said Friday it may have to close its
only border post with Iraq unless arrivals are quickly taken in by
their home nations.
   Premier Yildirim Akbulut said Turkey had information that
refugees were massing on the Iraqi side of the border. The Habur
crossing gate was built for truck traffic and lacks facilities for
large numbers of people, he said.
   Turkey realizes the difficulties these people face and wants to
do its humanitarian duty, the premier said in a written statement.
``But I must emphasize that it is not possible for us to provide
food, housing and transportation for tens of thousands of people.''
   Special measures on passage may have to be taken or ``closure of
the border may come on the agenda,'' he warned.
   Jordan has faced a similar problem since Iraq invaded Kuwait on
Aug. 2. It announced Wednesday it was closing its border with Iraq,
although people continue to cross the frontier.
   Turkish border officials say that since Aug. 2, 7,532 people
have entered Turkey through Habur. Of these, only 3,000 were
Turkish people returning home. Another 2,903 were Pakistanis. The
next largest groups were Romanians and Yugoslavs.
   Pakistan has been unable to provide planes to pick up the
refugees.
   Turkey is still dealing with refugees who poured into the
country during other crises in recent years.
   About 60,000 Kurdish refugees fleeing Iraqi chemical bomb
attacks poured into Turkey two years ago. Close to 40,000 of them
still remain in refugee camps in southeast Turkey.
   Last year, Turkey also faced a serious refugee problem when
320,000 ethnic Turkish Bulgarians fled to escape persecution by the
Bulgarian government. Since the ouster of Bulgaria's Communist
leaders, many ethnic Turks have returned to Bulgaria, but about
half stayed in Turkey.
   Turkey is also home to an estimated 1 million Iranians who fled
Iran during the Iran-Iraq war.
   Meanwhile, Turkey's military chief of staff, Gen. Necip
Torumtay, and force commanders traveled to the southern city of
Diyarbakir north of the Iraqi border to check defense measures
undertaken by land and air force units.
   The manager of the state-owned tire factory Petlas told the
Anatolia news agency the factory had been asked to increase
production to meet the needs of military vehicles.
   A state-owned company producing gas masks announced Thursday it
was increasing production by 50 percent.
   Some units of the Turkish air force and several land forces
brigades in the southeast have been placed on a state of advanced
readiness. Officials have said they do not anticipate an Iraqi
attack but that high tensions warrant taking defensive military
measures.

<HEAD>Chairman of Miss Texas Pageant Steps Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who has been chairman of the
Miss Texas Scholarship Pageant for 20 years has resigned after
reports of impropriety, including off-color remarks to contestants.
   B. Don Magness kept a low profile Friday. ``No, he's not (in)
and he does not wish to make any comments or make any
appearances,'' said a woman who answered the phone at his office.
   Magness resigned the volunteer job Thursday night, telling the
Miss Texas board of directors that he was unfairly depicted in a
Life magazine article as a dirty old man who made lewd comments to
pageant contestants.
   Magness, 58, has been associated with the pageant for 29 years,
and will continue on the board of directors.
   News reports after the Life article reported other complaints
about Magness' behavior, including an accusation from a former
pageant director that Magness had attempted to influence the
outcome of a local pageant.
   Some contestants and local pageant officials also said Magness
gave his blessing to so-called ``living room pageants'' in which
would-be contestants or their relatives bought franchises and
staged sham pageants that allowed some contestants to move into the
state show.
   Magness issued a statement telling the pageant board he was
disappointed ``by the unfair, biased, negative and inaccurate
writing ... by Life magazine.''
   Magness said he was leaving because he feared the negative
publicity could have a detrimental effect on the current Miss
Texas, Suzanne Lawrence, who will leave Saturday to compete in the
Miss America Pageant in Atlantic City, N.J., Sept. 4-8.
   Magness also complained that his hometown newspaper, the Fort
Worth Star-Telegram, did a ``hatchet job'' on him. Magness is
director of public events for the city of Fort Worth.
   Executive Editor Michael Blackman defended the newspaper's
coverage. ``For better or worse, given the environment in which he
works, he is going to be subject to scrutiny,'' Blackman said.
   Michelle Royer Jefferson, 1987 Miss USA and a former Miss Texas
contestant who claimed Magness made advances to her, said she was
surprised that Magness decided to step down.
   ``I think that just lends credence to everything that was said
about him,'' she said.
   But Regina Nelson, pageant director for Grayson and Denton
Counties, was furious over the resignation.
   ``You have actually crumbled a man's life, destroyed part of a
man's career,'' Nelson, whose daughter is the reigning Miss North
Texas, told a reporter.
   Magness estimated that 30,000 contestants participated in local
and state pageants during his tenure as chairman.
   Two of them, Phyllis George and Shirley Cothran, went on to
become Miss America. Seventeen Miss Texases placed among the top 10
finishers in Atlantic City during the past 20 years.

   The Chicago Sun-Times today in a copyright story reported that
after Simon approached thrift officials on behalf of the developer
_ a longtime Simon supporter _ talks got under way and the S&amp;L now
is in the final steps of working out a negotiated settlement to a
lawsuit it filed against the developer.
   Simon, D-Ill., told reporters today he did nothing wrong.
   ``I did the same thing that I did for thousands of other
citizens,'' Simon said. ``I did not pretend to know any of the
details.''
   Simon told the newspaper he was unaware that he was intervening
in a matter that involved a troubled savings and loan and did
nothing improper. The thrift's officials said Simon's call did not
influence their actions.
   Simon asked the president of First Nationwide Financial Corp. in
San Francisco to work out an agreement with Stephen Ballis, who
owes $5 million to the institution, the newspaper said.
   First Nationwide received taxpayer help recently to buy Pathway
Financial of Chicago, which was the second-largest troubled savings
and loan in Illinois until it was bailed out by the government at
the end of 1988.
   Ballis' company, Dayton Resources, defaulted on a Pathway loan
used to build a 19-unit condominium complex, the newspaper said.
   First Nationwide then sued to foreclose on the property and have
Ballis replaced by a court-appointed receiver. The S&amp;L has now
nearly finalized a negotiated settlement to that lawsuit, the
newspaper said.
   After meeting with Ballis in Chicago this summer, Simon said he
called First Nationwide's president. During the conversation, Simon
said he told the president he didn't know the details of the
dispute, ``but costly litigation could be avoided if they sat down
with (Ballis) and worked things out.''
   ``I just said, `Take a look at it. You can save a lot of
money,''' Simon recalled. ``I did not push anyone to do anything
improper, and I would not do that.''
   First Nationwide President John Devine said the call prompted
him to look into the Dayton Resources loan but did not influence
the way the S&amp;L handled the case.
   Ballis said he had campaigned and raised funds for Simon since
his first senatorial race, but Simon said Ballis' support had
nothing to do with his intervention.
   ``I help people whether they are contributors or not,'' Simon
said.
   Simon last week held a Chicago hearing on the savings and loan
crisis, in which he urged stricter prosecutions of those who
defrauded the nation's thrifts in what has been estimated to be a
$500 billion boondoggle for taxpayers.
   After the phone call, Ballis was contacted by First Nationwide
and worked out a settlement of the dispute, Ballis said.
   In April 1989, Ballis ran out of loan money for the condominium
project and Pathway's new owners refused to come up with any more
money, the newspaper said. Dayton Resources than stopped work on
the still incomplete project.
   Ballis blamed cost overruns on design changes made at Pathway's
request.

<HEAD>Tadzhikistan Declares Sovereignty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Central Asian republic of Tadzhikistan
declared sovereignty today, becoming the 13th of the 15 Soviet
republics to make some move toward greater autonomy, a news service
reported.
   The republic's Supreme Soviet, or parliament, passed the
declaration after a stormy six-hour session, the independent news
service Interfax said. The measure said Tadzhikistan's laws will
take precedence over Soviet laws.
   On Thursday, Soviet Armenia took a stronger step, declaring
independence, and the republic of Turkmenia declared sovereignty.
Only the republics of Kazakhstan and Kirghizia have not made such
moves.
   The declarations are signs of further fragmentation of the
Soviet Union.
   The three Baltic republics have insisted they want independence
and want no part of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plan to
reconfigure the nation into a looser confederation with more local
autonomy for the republics.
   Tadzhikistan said its declaration on state sovereignty would be
the basis for a new constitution and treaty of union with the
central Soviet government, Interfax reported.
   The Supreme Soviet rejected a proposal to create a separate army
for the republic, saying that Tadzhikistan has no money for one,
Interfax said.
   The Soviet Union's Central Asian republics, which are
predominantly Moslem, have been slower to embrace the more radical
course pursued by nationalists in other republics.

<HEAD>Postal Service, Workers Ready for Contract Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Postal officials and union leaders on Friday
formally opened what will likely be months of grueling contract
talks.
   ``I hope that the parties will communicate together and work
together to gain a contract marked by fairness and flexibility,''
said Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank.
   Vernon H. Meier, president of the 85,000-member National Rural
Letter Carriers Association, said he views the talks as ``a
challenge and an opportunity.''
   The financially-strapped Postal Service is preaching moderation,
meaning it hopes that workers will hold down their financial
demands.
   But union leaders say their members shouldn't suffer because of
management's inability to improve efficiency and hold down costs.
   ``We don't want the public to be gouged, but we're not going to
take the blame for poor management either,'' Moe Biller, president
of the American Postal Workers Union, said prior to the talks.
   Labor contracts between the U.S. Postal Service and its four
largest unions expire Nov. 20. The labor groups represent 660,000
workers.
   Biller's accusations center on the service's push towards
automation, which he said has wasted money without improving
efficiency. He says automation also costs thousands of jobs.
   Postal Service spokesman Lou Eberhardt called charges of
mismanagement ``pre-bargaining rhetoric.''
   Automation joins wages as a key issue in efforts to agree on new
three-year contracts.
   The Postal Service faces a deficit of between $1.4 billion and
$1.6 billion this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
   Because the agency, no longer subsidized by taxpayers, must
break even over time, the board of governors has proposed to raise
the cost of mailing a letter from 25 cents to 30 cents next spring.
   Testifying in March before Congress, Frank called on the unions
to show ``constructive restraint'' in wage demands. He said 83
percent of the Postal Service's costs go for wages and benefits.
   As of this month, letter carriers receive a starting salary of
$24,381, which includes a cost-of-living adjustment, the Postal
Service says. Most clerks and carriers earn a maximum of $31,516,
which also includes a cost-of-living increase. The Postal Service
says employees receive an additional $8,560 in benefits and premium
pay.
   Joseph Mahon, assistant postmaster general for labor relations,
said that the average $20 an hour makes postal workers better paid
than their counterparts in private business.
   The average hourly wage for American workers is $10. Workers
with tasks similar to those of postal workers make more than the
average worker, though. For instance, United Parcel Service workers
just ratified a new contract giving them nearly $18 an hour by 1992.
   The Postal Service has not drafted specific wage proposals to
take to the bargaining table.
   Biller's union is the largest, representing 334,000 clerks,
maintenance employees, drivers and special delivery messengers.
Other bargaining groups are the National Letter Carriers
Association, representing 234,000 urban letter carriers; the
National Postal Mail Handlers Union, representing 50,000 mail
handlers; and the National Rural Letter Carriers Association,
representing 42,000 rural letter carriers.
   Glenn Berrien, president of the mail handlers union, says postal
workers deserve raises because layoffs in recent years force many
to do the jobs of two. He said postal workers are also exposed to
hazards, handling ``everything from bees to farm chemicals.''

<HEAD>Doctor in Camarena Torture-Murder Case Ordered Held Without Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused today to allow the
release of a doctor spirited out of Mexico at the behest of U.S.
drug agents for trial on charges he participated in the torture
death of Enrique Camarena.
   Camarena, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, and his
pilot, were tortured and killed in 1985 in Guadalajara. Nearly 50
people have been arrested in the case in Mexico and the United
States. Several have been convicted.
   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was charged with violent crimes in
aid of racketeering, conspiracy, kidnap and murder. Prosecutors
said he administered drugs to keep Camarena alive while he was
being tortured prior to death.
   Alvarez was ordered detained without bail by U.S. District Judge
Edward Rafeedie, who ruled Aug. 10 that Alvarez he was kidnapped
illegally and should be returned to Mexico.
   Federal prosecutors appealed that order to the 9th Circuit Court
of Appeal, which issued an emergency order late Thursday to stay
Rafeedie's decision.
   Rafeedie said earlier this month that the United States abducted
Alvarez in violation of an extradition treaty with Mexico, that the
kidnapping was an offense to Mexico's sovereignty, and his court
lacked jurisdiction to try the physician.
   If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.

<HEAD>Dollar Rallies Slightly, Gold Drifts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rallied slightly against most major
currencies in European trading today as markets remained focused on
the prospects of a war in the Middle East.
   Gold drifted as investors waited for further developments in the
Gulf crisis.
   London dealers said dealing centered on the possibility that
hostilities in the Gulf over Iraq's annexation of Kuwait could
break into open warfare.
   Traders in London said dollar activity was subdued for most of
the day.
   The dollar failed to react to a slight revision of figures for
the U.S. second-quarter gross national product, which showed an
unchanged annual growth rate of 1.2 percent. Most traders had
expected a slight upward revision.
   ``The market at this stage is concentrating on the Middle East
crisis, pure and simple,'' said a London trader.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 145.70 Japanese yen from
145.88 at Thursday's close. Later in London it rose to 146.45 yen
and in early-afternoon New York trading it fetched 146.62 yen.
   In London, the British pound fetched $1.9445, cheaper than
$1.9515 late Thursday. In early-afternoon New York trading the
pound fetched $1.9460.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
1.5575 German marks, up from 1.5478; 1.2685 Swiss francs, up from
1.2598; 5.2275 French francs, up from 5.1835; 1.7550 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.7390; 1,157.50 Italian lire, up from 1,151.25;
1.1335 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1313.
   Other early-afternoon dollar rates in New York included: 1.5445
marks, 1.2623 Swiss francs, 1.1346 Canadian dollars and 1,154.12
Italian lire.
   Zurich bullion dealers said most investors were neutral towards
gold Thursday in the absence of significant developments in the
Gulf.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $411.75 a troy ounce,
down from $412.75 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $410.75, down from
$411.75 late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.61 to close at a bid $410.95.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.14 a
troy ounce, down from $5.15 late Thursday.

   Stock prices rebounded in Tokyo, Europe and New York today even
as tensions intensified over Iraq's deployment of troops near
foreign embassies in occupied Kuwait.
   ``All the (overseas) markets were sharply better,'' said Tom
Finnerty, senior vice president for international stock trading at
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. ``U.S. shares are
following the European markets.''
   Oil prices declined after matching record highs during Thursday
trading. The price of the benchmark U.S. crude was down 68 cents to
$31.25 per barrel at mid-afternoon on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Traders said they were encouraged by the possibility of
increased oil production by OPEC nations when several oil ministers
meet this weekend in Vienna.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 11.88
points to 2,495,30 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock
Exchange, after falling 76.73 points in heavy trading Thursday to
2,483.42.
   The market traded as much as 35 points up this morning before
falling back slightly. Traders bought shares to take advantage of
the recent declines and to bulwark positions to hedge against
developments over the weekend.
   The rally was attributed in part to a belief that the market has
been oversold since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. The index shed
516.33 points, or 17 percent, through Thursday since closing just
below 3,000 on July 17.
   Bond prices, meanwhile, gave back early gains on pessimism about
oil prices, inflation and the possibility of war in the Middle East.
   The U.S. Treasury's 30-year bond was down 5-16 point, or $3.13
per $1,000 in face amount, at mid-afternoon as its yield climbed to
9.16 percent from 9.13 percent late Thursday.
   The bond market had rallied slightly on a government report that
the economy grew at a lackluster annual rate of 1.2 percent in the
April-June quarter. That boosted bonds on a belief the Federal
Reserve may be forced to lower interest rates to stimulate the
economy, which many experts believe was verging on a recession even
before the Mideast turmoil.
   Stock markets in Tokyo, London and Frankfurt, West Germany, were
higher today. Prices rose in Tokyo after fluctuations influenced by
reports that elite Iraqi invasion forces in Kuwait were being
replaced by second- and third-string troops.
   The Nikkei Stock Average closed up 428.13 points at 24,165.76, a
1.8 percent rise, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The index lost
1,473.28 points Thursday, its fourth-largest one-day drop.
   In foreign exchange trading, the dollar fell in Tokyo to 145.70
Japanese yen from 145.88 yen at Thursday's close. Later in London
it rose to 146.45 yen and in early-afternoon New York trading it
fetched 146.62 yen.
   The dollar closed higher against most other currencies in London
after sinking to new lows against the German mark and Swiss franc a
day earlier.
   The Nikkei started lower today on rapid selling but regained
nearly 700 points as market players began buying after an NBC news
report that Iraq had ordered some elite troops withdrawn from the
Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabian border, said Tomoya Koda, a trader with New
Japan Securities Co.
   The market first took the news as a sign that Iraq was
withdrawing from the border, because many investors were
desperately seeking an excuse to buy after Thursday's huge losses,
Koda said.
   But Iraqi President Saddam Hussein replaced the elite forces
with lesser units, and the Nikkei lost some of this morning's
earlier gains when investors started selling, Koda said.
   Markets remained nervous as foreign diplomats in Kuwait defied
orders to shut down, and the skeleton staff at the U.S. mission
braced for possibilities ranging from a takeover to a supply cutoff.
   The financial market sell-off has been tied to uncertainty over
the future of world oil supplies, which have been reduced because
of an international embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude. The
prospect of war has worsened fears.
   On Thursday, crude oil settled at $31.93, up 71 cents, after
reaching $32.25 a barrel, matching the highest level since futures
contracts for oil were inaugurated in 1983.
   In March 1980, after the 1979 Iranian revolution that ousted
Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and curtailed world oil supplies, crude
reached a peak of $39.80 per barrel.

   A twin-engine private airplane crashed today in a
driveway between two houses in a crowded residential neighborhood,
killing the president of a major urban development firm and two
other people, officials said.
   The crash, which occurred in fog and light rain, also set the
two houses on fire, but the residents apparently escaped unhurt.
   Killed was Michael Spear, the president of the Rouse Co., a
downtown developer whose projects included the Harbor Place on the
Baltimore waterfront, the Faneuil Hall shopping area in Boston, the
South Street Seaport in New York and the revitalization of
Underground Atlanta.
   Phil Orlandella, spokesman for the agency which runs Logan
International Airport, identified Spear, 49.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials at Logan said the
plane was about 20 miles from the airport when he was asked by the
tower to climb. He then reported having trouble climbing and smoke
coming from an engine.
   The Piper Cheyenne turboprop was then lost from the radar screen
at about 6:30 a.m. Visibility at the time was one-quarter mile,
said Gail Lattrell, a spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
   The flight plan indicated there were three people on the plane
and that it was flying from Chatham on Cape Cod, where the Spears
have a home, to Boston and planned to return to Chatham, Lattrell
said.
   Spear, a pilot and an athlete, has been president of the Rouse
Co., the largest publicly held real estate development company in
the nation, since 1986.
   Orlandella said he could not confirm reports that the two other
victims were relatives of Spear, but statements from others
indicated his wife, Judy, and a daughter were killed.
   ``This is a terrible loss to the Rouse Co. and to the country,''
said James W. Rouse, retired founder of the company. ``Mike Spear
was a brilliant, compassionate, wise man. His leadership was
tremendous. In many respects, he is irreplaceable. Judy was a
wonderful woman who made a great contribution in her own right, as
well as to Mike's work.''
   John Stanton, whose son, Michael, was dating 20-year-old Jodi
Spear, said his son had stayed at the Spear home Thursday night and
learned of the deaths when police came to the house in Chatham
today.
   Spear, who lived in Columbia, Md., joined Rouse in 1967 as
director of market research and project evaluation. From 1971 to
1978, he was general manager of the Columbia project. Spear was
named executive vice president for development in 1978.
   Police Commissioner Francis M. Roache said apparently no one on
the ground was hurt in the crash.
   The airport was closed to arrivals for more than an hour after
the crash.
   The fire destroyed two single-family houses on Lorna Road, and
the plane incinerated a car between the houses, setting off a
series of explosions. Neighbors said no one was at home in one
house; residents of the other escaped.
   A resident of one house said he threw his wife and three
children out a first-floor window of their burning home.
   ``I don't know how I got out myself,'' said Suliman Kemokai, 39.
   His wife, Evelyn, was too shaken to speak. Their daughter,
Monique, 17, said she heard the crash and the next thing she knew
the house was on fire and her mother was trying to round up the
children.
   Monique said they tried to get out the back door, but it was
locked and they could not find the key.

   An Air Force ambulance stationed in this coastal resort town and
a local ambulance responded to a call from the president's

   ``However, the ambulances were not needed and soon returned to

   Abe Lincoln, the robot, beat Kermit the
frog in a quiet civil war at Disneyland.
   Disneyland will keep the ``Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln''
show, which park officials had planned to close this weekend. No
longer would the nation's 16th president rise from his chair, 51
times a day, to deliver excerpts from his speeches.
   Park operators reportedly planned to replace the show with a new
Muppets attraction.
   But tourists and park employees were irked by the idea and
Disneyland officials apparently backed off from their plans _ for
now.
   ``If you'd asked a few days ago, I'd have said that being a
25-year-old attraction, its popularity has passed,'' said park
spokesman Paul Goldman. ``But there seems to be a lot of sentiment
for Lincoln.''
   For one park visitor, 12-year-old Abby Hangsleben of East Grand
Forks, Minn., Kermit just can't compare to Honest Abe.
   ``Lincoln was president. Kermit is a frog,'' she said.
   Disney officials refuse to disclose attendance figures but
acknowledge that park visitors recently haven't shown a lot of
interest in the Lincoln show.
   Reports had circulated for months among Disneyland's 8,000
employees that the Main Street opera hall, which houses the Lincoln
show and exhibits honoring park founder Walt Disney, would be
turned over to Kermit, Miss Piggy and Big Bird.
   Last week, officials said the Lincoln exhibit would be closed on
Sunday for the ``refurbishing'' of the opera house.
   But Goldman said Thursday park planners were looking at several
other sites for the Muppets, including an area near the ``It's a
Small World'' attraction.
   ``It's a matter of shoe-horning things in,'' he said.
   Disney purchased rights to several of the Muppets characters
last year and plans to use Kermit, Miss Piggy, Big Bird and the
gang in shows and parades at the park.

   The Bush administration said today
that Iraqi troops are blocking the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait and that
Saddam Hussein's government is preventing a large group of American
diplomats and dependents from leaving Iraq.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the Iraqi troops
outside the embassy in Kuwait ``are not allowing people to enter or
leave.'' However, he added, ``I'm not aware of any confrontations
between the Iraqi soldiers and the small group of Americans inside
the facility,'' led by Ambassador Nathaniel Howell.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said
Iraqi ``guards are controlling entry and exit from the compound.''
He said one embassy vehicle was prevented from entering the grounds
today.
   Boucher said the small staff was still in contact with some
Americans trapped in Kuwait but was hindered by restraints on their
movements and ``because we know that the Iraqis are monitoring the
embassy's local telephone calls in an attempt to locate American
citizens.''
   Iraq has demanded that the embassy be closed and the
administration has refused.
   Instead, it reduced the staff to a minimum, and an estimated 100
diplomats and dependents travelled overnight to Baghdad.
   That's the group that Fitzwater said is being prevented from
departing the country for Turkey or other destinations. ``They are
safe,'' he said, but unable to depart.
   He said the administration holds Iraq responsible for the safety
of all Americans in Iraq and Kuwait.
   The spokesman said Bush continues to follow developments in the
Persian Gulf crisis carefully, and had met during the morning with
his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and others.
   Fitzwater also said it was ``sick beyond expression'' that
Saddam Hussein appeared in a videotape on Thursday with British
children being held hostage in Iraq. It showed the ``cynical and
inhuman view'' that Iraq's leader holds for human life, he said.
   With thousands of American troops already in the Persian Gulf
and thousands more on the way _ and a partial call-up of the
reserves ordered _ Fitzwater said Bush would return to Washington
on Tuesday to meet with congressional leaders on the crisis.
   Fitzwater told reporters the Iraqis had reneged on their
``explicit commitment'' to permit American diplomats and families
in Kuwait and Iraq to depart.
   He called on Iraq to heed a United Nations resolution that would
permit these people to leave the region, and said:
   ``The United States also reminds Iraq that it will be held
responsible for the safety and well-being of American citizens
being held hostage,'' he said. There are an estimated 2,500 private
U.S. citizens in Kuwait and more than 500 in Iraq.
   As for the embassy facility in Kuwait, which Iraq has ordered
shut down, Fitzwater stressed the administration will not comply.
   He said Iraqi soldiers are around the embassy, and ``it would
appear that people are not being allowed to leave or to enter the
embassy.''
   He said the facility has electrical and water service despite
the presence of Iraqi troops outside. ``They have not made any move
against the embassy or intruded in any fashion,'' he said of the
Iraqi forces.
   He also said the situation was duplicated around other embassies
in Kuwait, although he did not identify them by name.
   Fitzwater said American officials are in contact with Howell.
Asked what the ambassador would do if the Iraqis tried to forcibly
invade the embassy, he said:
   ``Force has not been applied. Should he be subject to that he
will have to act accordingly,'' Fitzwater said.
   The United States withdrew the complement of Marine guards that
normally protects the embassy. One official said at the time the
announcement was made that the decision was made to protect
American lives, and noted that a few Marines could not fight the
Iraqi Army.
   The decision to leave Howell and a handful of aides in the
nearly empty embassy was made ``as a symbol of our rejection of
Iraq's illegal occupation and annexation of Kuwait,'' Fitzwater
said.
   An official said one woman traveling with the group to Baghdad
was injured when two of the cars collided at the start of the trip.
She was left at a Kuwait City hospital.
   President Bush started his day with a dawn golf game with his
two sons, Jeb, of Florida, and George W., of Texas. Bush refused to
answer reporters' questions on the Persian Gulf crisis. He sped
away in his golf cart, saying, ``New policy,'' an apparent
reference to his recent ruling that he will not answer questions on
serious matters while golfing.
   Bush went boating Thursday with national security adviser Brent
Scowcroft and playing tennis at his seaside home while monitoring
the tense Persian Gulf developments. Fitzwater sought to put out
assurances that ``this is a matter that is constantly with him,''
even though he is away from Washington.
   On a separate front, the White House kept close tabs on progress
in United Nations talks on whether to sanction use of force to back
up the trade embargo against Iraq.
   The Soviet and U.S. ambassadors disagreed on whether the five
permanent Security Council members had reached agreement on a
resolution allowing ``minimum force'' to halt all ships bound for
or leaving Iraq.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the U.S. Navy has boarded
``a handful'' of ships in its week-old effort to halt Iraqi
shipping. He said he could not give a definitive number nor say
when or where the boardings occurred.
   Bush said earlier he was willing to give the U.N. some time to
see if it would agree on a resolution endorsing military
enforcement, but also has said the United States already has the
legal authority it needs to carry out such enforcement unilaterally.
   At the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney approved plans to
call 10,000 military reservists to active duty over the next week
and nearly 50,000 by the end of September. The reserves will back
up the huge U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf.
   The Pentagon also announced the first deployment of American
forces from European NATO bases to the Middle East buildup. Troops
from the U.S. Army Europe's 7th Medical Command, based in West
Germany, are heading to the Persian Gulf area as part of Operation
Desert Shield.
   Bush today also planned to turn to domestic affairs. He
scheduled a meeting at his vacation home with Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady and Budget Director Richard Darman to discuss
deficit-reduction talks that will resume in September with
congressional negotiators.

<HEAD>Court Upholds Government In Setting Auto Mileage Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Friday that the
government is acting properly in setting auto mileage standards
without preparing formal Environmental Impact Statements.
   The court, in a 2-1 decision, rejected a series of lawsuits by
the state of California, the cities of Los Angeles and New York,
and several environmental and safety groups challenging the way the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sets annual
standards for the auto industry.
   Chief Judge Patricia M. Wald dissented, saying the agency acted
arbitrarily when it determined its mileage standards would have no
significant impact on global warming.
   The traffic agency sets mileage standards that automakers must
achieve as an average for their models each year. It was 26 miles
per gallon for model years 1987-88 and was slightly higher at 26.5
for 1989.
   The government entities, the Center for Auto Safety, Public
Citizen, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Natural
Resources Defense Council filed suits covering mileage standards
for 1987-88. Most of the same plaintiffs joined a suit over the
1989 standards.
   The court ruling rejected all of the complaints.
   The plaintiffs argued that failure to implement higher standards
would cause more air pollution and said the agency should be
required to determine exactly how the air would be affected in
various cities.
   The court said the traffic safety agency conducted extensive
evaluations of the impact of its standards on fuel consumption and
emissions.
   It said the agency also has committed itself to preparing a
cumulative Environmental Impact Statement on the entire mileage
standards system.
   ``That program should provide additional assurance ... that the
agency is not making decisions with environmental consequences that
escape its full consideration,'' Judge Douglas Ginsburg said in the
majority decision.
   Wald, in dissenting, proposed that the matter be sent back to
the agency for a better explanation of its decisions under
environmental laws, but she said there was no need to immediately
roll back the standards.
   She said the agency ``fails completely to explain how the
cumulative effect it anticipates will affect the non-attainment
areas,'' referring to communities that have failed to meet clean
air standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   Those include Los Angeles, other California cities and New York.

   Frequent Iraqi troop movements keep
tank-killing American Apache helicopters ``locked and loaded and
ready'' in the air near the Saudi-Kuwait border, Army officers said
Friday.
   The Iraqis, one officer said, ``move around so much you can't
always be sure right away what they're up to, so you stay ready''
even though an invasion of Saudi Arabia is not considered imminent.
   A small group of reporters visited the aviation brigade of the
101st Airborne Division, an air-assault unit, at its base in the
Saudi desert. It was the first time reporters had been allowed into
the base camp, which is within range of Iraqi forces just over the
border in occupied Kuwait.
   Several AH-64 Apache pilots and co-pilots interviewed Friday
said they had been on missions to the border area to familiarize
themselves with flying conditions and the terrain below.
   The Apaches, with Hellfire missiles and multiple rocket pods,
are the military's main weapon against Iraqi tanks. The helicopters
are designed for both night and day combat.
   ``We can take out 200 tanks easy in about two hours,'' said Lt.
Col. Dick Cody, commander of an Apache battalion. ``It's a
(tactical) fighter's dream out here.''
   Additional air-defense systems were installed in the Apaches
before they were sent to Saudi Arabia, and even more advanced
systems designed to detect and defend against enemy fire are
expected to be brought into Saudi Arabia for front-line units, the
officers said.
   ``They were upgraded to match what they've (Iraqi forces) got,''
one pilot said.
   The camp, which would be used as a staging area for repair and
refueling bases in the event of combat, is expanding each day as
more men, equipment and supplies arrive. Ground rules for the
Pentagon pool operation prohibit the disclosure of its location.
   Most details of the Apache defense systems are classified, but
they are designed to destroy approaching enemy fire or to confuse
guidance systems.
   During a display for the journalists, two Apaches flew north
over the Saudi desert, hugging the ground and sometimes hiding
behind sand dunes. The reporters watched from a Blackhawk
helicopter.
   Col. Tom Garrett, the brigade commander, said the division
receives constant updates on Iraqi troop and tank movements and
could quickly respond to an incursion into Saudi Arabia.
   ``We've been told we should get a 6- to 8-hour heads up when
they start moving around, but we can be ready pretty fast if need
be,'' Garrett said.
   ``We're not worried about it,'' he said of the Iraqi tank
threat. ``We are locked and loaded and ready to go.''
   The Apaches are equipped with state of the art radar and other
scanning systems, and the weapons use laser and computer-controlled
guidance systems.
   The Hellfire never has been used in combat, but Garrett said it
had performed well in training missions. Live-fire training is
planned for the Saudi desert, he said.
   The Apaches, because of the anti-tank capabilities, were among
the earliest arrivals in Saudi Arabia. Their engines are being
flushed daily because of sand, but Garrett and several pilots said
they had experienced few weather-related problems.
   ``We've got two enemies out here,'' Garrett said. ``One is the
environment. The other is the Iraqis.''

   A series of explosions and a fire at a chemical
factory in the Urals Mountains injured 110 people and forced
authorities to evacuate thousands of people, the Tass news agency
reported Friday.
   The news agency said the fire burned several hours at the
factory in the city of Ufa before firefighters put it out. It said
three people suffered serious injuries. Most of those hospitalized
were firefighters.
   The water supply for 60 percent of the city's 1 million people
was cut off by contamination from the phenol-acetone factory and
foam sprayed by firefighters, Tass said. Drinking water was shipped
in from other areas.
   Authorities evacuated 4,000 hospital patients because of
dangerous fumes.

<HEAD>Former CIA Agent Must Face Iran-Contra-Related Tax Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge refused to dismiss tax charges
brought against a former CIA agent, saying Iran-Contra independent
counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has the jurisdiction to bring the case,
officials said Friday.
   As a result, Thomas G. Clines' trial on the four-count
indictment will begin as scheduled Sept. 4 in Baltimore, said Mary
Belcher, spokeswoman for Walsh's office.
   Clines assisted the Nicaraguan Contra arms resupply network run
by Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim and overseen by then-White
House aide Oliver North. He helped locate a European arms dealer as
a source of weapons, helped arrange for shipping and lined up crews
to transport the supplies to the rebels.
   Accused of hiding arms sales profits from the government, Clines
was indicted Feb. 22 on charges of under reporting his income to
the Internal Revenue Service and failing to report foreign
financial accounts to the Treasury Department. If convicted on all
counts, he could face a maximum of 21 years in prison and $950,000
in fines.
   The ruling Thursday by U.S. District Judge Norman P. Ramsey in
Baltimore came as no surprise to Clines' attorney, Paula Junghans.
   ``He basically told us that orally months ago,'' Junghans said.
``All he was doing was cleaning up the record and writing it down.''
   Ramsey rejected both Clines' bid to dismiss the charges and to
suppress financial records obtained through the use of a U.S.-Swiss
treaty.
   Clines had contended in his motion to dismiss that the alleged
tax crimes were ``without any relationship whatsoever to the events
of the affair.''
   Junghans said the tax case were outside the Iran-Contra
prosecutor's jurisdiction because ``Mr. Clines has not been charged
with committing any crime by virtue of his participation in the
purchase, sale or transfer of arms ... nor has he been charged with
any crime relating to ... support to the Contras.''
   However, Walsh's office had argued that ``crimes involving the
attempt to hide arms sale profits'' were within Walsh's purview.
The independent counsel said Clines ``illegally misrepresented ...
on his tax returns the full amount of his arms sales profits and
that he illegally hid from the United States government the
existence of the foreign financial accounts in which he maintained
some of his profits.''
   Ramsey agreed with the prosecutor, saying, ``The court finds
that the alleged criminal activity falls within the independent
counsel's jurisdiction.''
   In addition, Ramsey rejected Clines' motion to suppress
financial records on Swiss bank accounts because they were obtained
through use of the U.S.-Switzerland treaty.
   Prosecutors said the only Swiss records to be used are those
produced by Hakim.
   The judge ruled that even if the government used information
obtained through the treaty, Clines would have no standing to
challenge their use as evidence.

   Democratic state Treasurer Ellis Edwards
was punched in the jaw after he stuck a campaign sticker on a
woman's purse.
   ``This is election time. I guess some people get hot about
elections,'' Edwards said.
   Edwards, who is running for re-election, said he asked a man at
a banquet Thursday night if he could put a campaign sticker on his
clothing.
   He said the man told him he was a Republican and did not want
the sticker.
   ``I asked his wife if I could put it on her bag,'' Edwards said.
``She said, `Fine,' and I did, and he became upset at that. I said
`If it upset you, I'm sorry.'''
   Edwards and Allen Greeson, another Democratic candidate for
treasurer, said Edwards bumped the Republican man moments later
while passing out stickers on the next row.
   The man shoved Edwards.
   ``At some point, that guy hit me. I wasn't expecting to be
hit,'' said Edwards.
   Charges were not filed.

<HEAD>Conclusion to Judge's Ruling on Pennsylvania Abortion Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Abortion Restrictions, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is the conclusion to Senior U.S.
District Judge Daniel H. Huyett's ruling striking down portions of
Pennsylvania's abortion law:
   ``For now, at least, the law of abortion remains undisturbed,
because only the United States Supreme Court has the power to
change it.
   ``But those individuals who have felt secure over the past 17
years with the fundamental right, and the protections which flow
therefrom, guaranteed by Roe v. Wade would be wise to heed Justice
Blackmun's admonition _ `the signs are evident and very ominous,
and a chill wind blows.'
   ``What the future holds is not certain. But one thing must be
evident. Individuals can no longer feel as secure with the
protections provided by the judiciary in this area. Instead, a
woman's privacy rights and individual autonomy may soon be
subjected to the vicissitudes of the legislative process.
   ``Therefore, the protection afforded will depend on the ballot
box, and the nature of the protection, if any, could vary from
term-to-term depending on the composition of the legislature.
   ``If unprotected by their vote and the votes of other pro-choice
advocates, many women will be forced to seek abortion services
elsewhere. For those that can afford it, this may only mean
traveling to another jurisdiction. For those that cannot, the
result may well be disastrous and tragic. But for now, at least,
the law of abortion remains undisturbed.''

<TEXT>
   ABC on Friday yanked its new ``Baby Talk''
series from its fall schedule and said it would bring back ``Head
of the Class'' on Tuesday nights.
   However, Howard Hesseman won't be returning as a teacher on
``Head,'' a high school sitcom that ran for four seasons, then was
put on hold as a back-up series for the 1990-91 season.
   The show's new version, to premiere on Sept. 11, will star
Scottish comedian Billy Connolly as an Oxford-educated high school
history teacher.
   ``Baby Talk'' ran into problems when Connie Sellecca, who was to
star in the show, was replaced by its producer, Ed Weinberger.
   On Tuesday, the former co-star of ABC's ``Hotel'' and CBS'
short-lived ``Flying High'' series, filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles
against Weinberger and Columbia Pictures Television for more than
$1.5 million.
   The suit alleged that Weinberger ``beat up on Selleca
emotionally'' and demanded she submit unconditionally to his
authority. He and the studio have declined to comment.
   ABC Entertainment president Robert A. Iger said in a statement
that the re-casting of ``Baby Talk'' is not complete, causing a
delay in its premiere. Plans for the series will be announced soon,
he said.

<HEAD>Court Sides With FCC On Public Interest Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court Friday upheld rules
that require would-be radio or TV licensees such as home shopping
channels make only the briefest assertions that their programming
will serve the public interest.
   The ruling affirmed an important part of the overall
deregulation of broadcasting that began in the early 1980s under
the Reagan administration.
   The case arose when challengers tried to prevent the Federal
Communications Commission from awarding licenses in Cleveland and
Baltimore to subsidiaries of the Home Shopping Network, whose
round-the-clock sell-a-thon stations hawk merchandise to television
viewers through telephone orders.
   HSN stations typically devote a small portion of their days to
public affairs or news shows in order to meet FCC requirements that
stations provide ``non-entertainment programming responsive to
issues of concern in the community to be served.''
   Due to revisions the FCC made beginning in 1981, license
applicants currently must make only a ``brief narrative
description'' of proposed programming that indicates they
understand and intend to comply with their public service
obligations _ and not make specific promises of what their
programming will be.
   The FCC reasoned that locking applicants into promised
programming would limit their ability to adapt to changing market
conditions.
   Gigi Sohn, an attorney for the Media Access Project, which
represented one of the challengers, the United Church of Christ,
said the ``short boilerplate statement'' now required is
insufficient to show that an applicant intends to serve the
public's needs, particularly for children.
   She said home shopping channels ``claim they present news
programing that meets the needs of children but they'll have the
same news clip four or five times a day.''
   The FCC had rejected the challenges in a series of rulings, and
a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on
Friday unanimously sided with the commission.
   Writing for the court, Circuit Judge James L. Buckley said the
commission's rules were consistent with the authority granted the
FCC under the 1934 Communications Act and that the FCC's rules
``provide the commission with sufficient information that granting
the applicant's license would serve the public interest.''
   Buckley was joined by judges Ruth B. Ginsburg and Harry T.
Edwards.
   Also Friday, the court ruled that the FCC properly had waived
its ``duopoly'' rules to allow one HSN subsidiary to own stations
in both Vineland, N.J., and nearby Newark, N.J., even though the
station signals would overlap.

   Actress Dana Delany is tired of showing how
virtuous she can be. The Emmy-winning ``China Beach'' star says she
wants to be a ``bad girl.''
   ``I want to play different characters. I want to do comedy,
somebody who's not so heroic. Somebody who's bad,'' Delany says in

   She's wanted to play those types of roles since she was a kid,

   ``My favorite actress growing up was Gloria Grahame. That's who
I want to be. A bad girl,'' she said. ``You get lots of

   Mayfield, accompanied by his wife and son, left Kings County
Hospital Friday for the Shepherd Spinal Center in Atlanta, said a

tower, critically injuring Mayfield. Hospital officials and his
family have declined to say if the paralysis might be permanent.
   Mayfield, 48, was one of the founders of seminal rhythm and

   Ex-Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant says his
heavy metal band was wrongly accused of slipping Satanic messages
in its albums long before the current Judas Priest flap.
   ``I mean, who on Earth would have ever thought of doing that in
the first place? You've got to have a lot of time on your hands to
even consider that people would do that,'' Plant said in an
interview with Rolling Stone magazine.
   Plant said if his band had used the backward masking, where the
lyrics can only be heard by playing an album backwards, it might
have included a message more money-driven than malicious.
   ``I figure if backward masking really worked, every record in
the store would have `buy this album' hidden in it,'' said Plant.
   In Reno, Nev., a judge ruled Friday that hidden words do exist
on an album by the British rock band Judas Priest. But the judge
ruled they were not placed there intentionally and the group was
not responsible for a suicide pact formed by two young fans.
   Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead said the alleged
words ``do it'' were the result of a chance combination of sounds.

   The three-bedroom home where Bob Dylan
grew up in northeastern Minnesota has been sold, said a real estate
broker.
   The two-story, stucco house was sold Tuesday to a couple with
two children, broker Curt Curtis said Thursday. The sale price was
not disclosed.
   ``They did not buy it because of the Dylan affiliation,'' Curtis
said.
   But the connection could be a good thing if they ever decide to
sell, said the new owner, Gregg French, 35, a Frito-Lay route
salesman.
   While French and his wife, Donna, 32, don't intend to sell the
home they just bought, he said, ``I feel this house would have a
little more protection against a downturn in the market.''
   The house was put up for sale in October 1988 with an asking
price of $84,000. The list price was later reduced to $56,900, he
said.
   The house was owned for 22 years by Terry and Angel Marolt, who
raised a son and a daughter there after buying it from Dylan's
mother.
   Dylan, 49, was born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Duluth and grew up
in Hibbing. He moved to New York and became known for his 1960s
protest songs, including ``Blowin' in the Wind'' and ``Masters of
War.''

   Dr. Thomas E. Starzl, who performed the
world's first successful liver transplant, underwent heart surgery
Friday.
   Surgeons began the coronary artery bypass operation on Starzl at
7:30 a.m. and finished nearly five hours later at Presbyterian
University Hospital, where he has performed hundreds of transplants.
   Starzl was in stable condition in the hospital's intensive care
unit.
   ``The surgery was uncomplicated and Dr. Starzl is doing well,''
said Gary Marrone, who led the surgical team.
   On July 9, surgeons removed a blockage from Starzl's right
coronary artery after he complained of chest pains. Doctors said he
was doing well following that operation.
   Starzl, 64, performed the first successful liver transplant, at
the University of Colorado in 1967. He also pioneered development
of a medical team that performed 200 kidney transplants at Colorado
General and Denver Veteran's Administration hospitals.
   In 1981, Starzl began work at the University of Pittsburgh,
which he helped make one of the world's premier transplant centers.
Last year, the hospital performed more than 460 liver transplants
and 210 kidney transplants.

dispatch monitored in Nicosia, said: ``Irish hostage Brian Keenan
has just been set free.''
   Earlier today, an Irish envoy arrived in Damascus where freed
Western hostages have been taken in the past.
   If the IRNA report is confirmed, the 39-year-old Kennan would
become the fifth Western hostage freed in the last five months.
   Others released during that time are U.S. hostages Robert
Polhill and Frank Reed and two Swiss Red Cross workers, Elio
Erriquez and Emanuel Christen.
   Kennan's release was expected because a senior Iranian official,
Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi, had told a newspaper that
the Irishman would be set freed today. The IRNA report that Keenan
had been set free in Lebanon came several hours after Vaezi had
predicted the release would take place.
   In his interview with the Tehran Times, Vaezi had thanked ``the
Islamic groups in Lebanon who once more showed their goodwill
toward the West'' by deciding to release a Western hostage.
   He said Keenan was being released after ``several months of
efforts of the Iranian officials and Islamic groups in Lebanon.''
Many of the kidnappers of Westerners in Lebanon are pro-Iranian.
   ``We expect that the West will take similar steps fof the
freedom of Lebanese prisoners and Iranian hostages,'' Vaezi said.
``Such a move will make our efforts for the freedom of a hostages
easier.''
   Almost all hostages freed from captivity in Lebanon have been
handed to Syrian officers in Lebanon and then escorted to Damascus
overland, a trip through winding mountainous roads that takes up to
three hours.
   Earlier today, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Al-Sharaa told
reporters in Damascus that he was hopeful that a Western hostage
would be released. ``We are in touch with the Iranians, (and) with
certain Lebanese groups,'' he said.
   Ireland's ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Declan Connolly, arrived
in Damascus today, saying ``we are quite hopeful'' that Keenan will
be released.
   Keenan was kidnapped on April 11, 1986 in west Beirut while
walking to his job as an English teacher at the American University
in Beirut.
   If the IRNA report is confirmed, the number of Westerners
believed held by extremist Moslem groups in Lebanon would fall to
13.
   In addition to Keenan they include six Americans, four Britons,
two West Germans and an Italian. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was abducted March 16, 1985.
   Iran has linked the Western hostages to the fate of four
Iranians kidnapped by Christian Lebanese Forces militiamen in July
1982.
   Although the four are widely believed to have been killed,
Iranian leaders have repeated stressed that they would use their
influence to secure the release of Western hostages in exchange for
help in freeing the Iranians.
   ``I hope in the future all the hostages will be released,''
Vaezi was quoted as saying. ``We will try our best, no matter which
nationality they are, we will try our best for their freedom.
   ``We should make our efforts to pave the way the use of our
influence in this direction so that all may be freed,'' he said.

<HEAD>Military Reservists Get Call and `Shed a Couple Tears'</HEAD>

   When Maggie Eylers got word that she was among the U.S.
reservists returning to active duty within the next five weeks, she
called her lawyer to check on her will and a divorce settlement.
   She also began preparing her four children, ages 15 to 21, for
her departure.
   ``We talked all day . . . we shed a couple tears,'' said Eylers,
39, of Iowa City, Iowa. ``We're all scared; that goes without
saying. But we're all confident things are going to be OK.''
   To be sure, the 49,703 men and women being ordered into action
chose to put themselves in the position of getting called. But the
thought that it was their choice to sign up for the reserves did
little to ease their anxieties, which extend to the jobs and
accompanying benefits they're leaving behind.
   Meantime, they've been trying to get their houses in order,
arranging child care, completing legal matters, and saying goodbye.
   At Fort Benning, Ga., Spec. 4 Hollie Vallance cradled her
newborn daughter in her arms, finding it hard to say goodbye.
   ``I love you. ... Take care of her,'' she told her civilian
husband, Anthony Kirk, as she handed 7-week-old Cheyenne to him.
   The sight of soldiers leaving their families was common at Fort
Benning this week as the Army's 197th Infantry Brigade began moving
out to join the growing U.S. force in the Middle East.
   Overwhelmed, Kirk struggled to explain his emotions. For the
past two weeks, he and his wife _ a 21-year-old medic _ had talked
about this reversal of roles. He practiced feeding and changing
diapers. She cleaned her gun and packed her bag, careful not to
bend the photographs of her first child.
   ``I've thought about it a lot. Like now,'' he said. ``She told
me it's just like a training maneuver. ... She'll be back.''
   Phoenix firefighter Rick Salyers has faced danger in his job,
and he indulges in such risky hobbies as scuba diving and sky
diving, but his wife and three children are worried that he may
ship off to the Middle East.
   ``It's the chemical-warfare stuff,'' said Salyers, the
35-year-old Marine Corps Reserve. ``I think that's what worries
them the most. My teen-age daughters are concerned. I could see the
anguish in their faces.''
   Said Mrs. Salyers: ``I tell myself I can take it, that it'll be
OK, but I really don't know.''
   The crisis in the Persian Gulf hit home elsewhere, too.
   For a pair of 10-year-old girls with military fathers, the
uncertainty of the situation inspired them to write a song.
   Elizabeth Finocchio and Heather Hogsed of Fayetteville, N.C.,
wrote lyrics titled ``What's Going On?''
   ``I almost cried when I read it,'' said Heather's mother, Pamela
Yarborough. ``It really shows how they felt and that they're kind
of frightened by what's going on.''
   In Newburgh, N.Y., some 150 members of the 137th Military
Airlift Squadron based at Stewart International Airport were
briefed before going to the Persian Gulf, said Ed Weber, the deputy
commander.
   ``That means talking about things many people don't like hearing
about, like wills and insurance,'' he said.
   Reservists also worried about other things that they would
prefer not to _ like job and health benefits.
   ``It's been so long since a mobilization occurred, I think some
people joined up thinking it would never happen,'' said Lt. Bruce
Fowler,executive officer of the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve
Center in Alameda, Calif.
   While federal law protects reservists' jobs, some personnel
could lose out financially.
   ``My biggest concern is for some of the junior people who make
only about $15,000 a year in the military,'' said Fowler. ``They
may have higher civilian salaries, and the (San Francisco) Bay area
is an expensive place to live.''
   Under federal law, an employer must provide returning reservists
with their job or one with comparable seniority, status, pay and
any raises they might have received.
   One of the benefits of military service is that reservists and
their families are covered by the Defense Department's health and
life insurance programs. Relatives also have access to cut-rate
military grocery stores.
   But the military medical plan becomes active only after the
reservist has been on duty for more than 30 days, meaning there
could be problems for those who serve fewer than 30 days.
   Some companies, including Pacific Bell, continue health benefits
until military benefits start.
   IBM, which has about 19,000 people in Silicon Valley, also will
help with health benefits. In addition, IBM will make up the
difference if a worker makes less money than they did at their
former job, said company spokesman Walt Kesshan.

   Broad jump, tightrope and soccer were
among the events in the competition Friday at Kalamazoo College,
but the competitors were more interested in munchies than the
thrill of victory.
   And fans at the fourth annual Rat Olympics were careful not give
a big hand to Evita, who has been known to bite the hand that feeds
her. Student trainers joked that her snack of choice is ``finger
food.''
   ``We've never had a rat bite before, but word has it Evita has
bitten several people,'' said psychology Professor Lyn Raible,
creator of the rodent recreations.
   About 25 psychology students trained the 14 participating rats
in lieu of writing a term paper. Raible came up with the idea for
the games in 1987 as a way to enliven her summer course work for
students. But there was another motive.
   ``Most of my students will go on to do research and I wanted
them to think of rats as more than laboratory animals on which to
experiment,'' Raible said. ``After working with the rats, the
students see them in a different light.''
   Students used breakfast cereals as rewards to train their
four-legged athletes.
   This year, someone built a scale model of the Empire State
Building, which the rats were trained to climb to rescue a
miniature replica of King Kong.
   ``Some of the students really develop quite a bond with their
rats,'' Raible said. ``I see them hugging and kissing them. Really,
sometimes it's almost disgusting.''

<HEAD>Company Abandons Las Vegas Train Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A company that started building a $60 million,
magnetically levitated passenger rail system in Las Vegas has
abandoned the project, leaving behind concrete track pillars and an
unfinished station.
   Magnetic Transit of America Inc. cited financial difficulties
and ``reasons beyond our control'' for pulling out of the elevated
rail project Thursday.
   ``It has become increasingly evident that termination is the
only responsible business decision to be made,'' said MTA President
John Kapala.
   MTA had built a dozen track pillars and a station at the
Children's Museum in the new downtown library as part of its plan
to run a 1.1-mile magnetically levitated system through the
downtown area.
   The company was rebuffed in its efforts to link the proposed
system with the Las Vegas Strip, the glitzy heart of the casino
district. Kapala said that was ``a very important element'' in the
decision to scrap the project.
   City Councilman Arnie Adamsen said the West German company
pulled out purely for business reasons.
   Adamsen said the company intended the system to be a
demonstration of the new technology and hoped to eventually link it
to the Strip, McCarran International Airport and other parts of the
Las Vegas Valley.
   ``It wasn't going to be a revenue producer,'' Adamsen said. ``It
was presented to me as the first leg of a transportation system in
the valley.''
   Adamsen said city officials, who obtained a $1.6 million grant
from the federal government to build the Children's Museum station,
made it clear to MTA officials in meetings this week that it is the
company's responsibility for paying an estimated $4 million to
remove what has already been built.
   The company had constructed 12 concrete columns and some 7,000
square feet of platform at the museum station. It said it invested
$10 million in the project.
   Construction on the system began in 1988 but was halted in June
as the company began reassessing the project.
   Skeptics had said from the project's inception that it would
carry few riders between the Cashman Field convention center and
ballpark complex and downtown and would have to be part of a bigger
system linked with the airport and Strip to succeed.

   Clad in combat gear, Spec. 4 Hollie
Vallance cradled her newborn daughter in her arms one last time,
finding it hard to say goodbye.
   ``I love you. ... Take care of her,'' she told her civilian
husband, Anthony Kirk, as she handed 7-week-old Cheyenne to him.
   The sight of soldiers leaving their families was common at Fort
Benning this week as the Army's 197th Infantry Brigade began moving
out to join the U.S. forces in the Middle East. But for Ms.
Vallance, a 21-year-old medic, the farewell was especially poignant.
   ``It happens,'' was all she could say, her voice breaking up as
she held Cheyenne, her first child, to her chest Thursday.
   She stood for a final few minutes beside her husband, hardly
speaking, a cigarette in her right hand, her head pressed against
his shoulder.
   This was not the first time they had gone through this. Early
Sunday, she had left for Savannah, only to return the next day
because the ship taking her to Saudi Arabia was filled up.
   It didn't look any easier the second time. As soldiers began to
group on the lawn, she reluctantly placed her baby in her husband's
arms.
   Overwhelmed, Kirk struggled to explain his emotions. For the
past two weeks, he and his wife had talked about this reversal of
roles. He practiced feeding and changing diapers. She cleaned her
gun and packed her bag, careful not to bend the photographs of
Cheyenne.
   ``I've thought about it a lot. Like now,'' he said. ``She told
me it's just like a training maneuver. ... She'll be back.''
   Kirk, a 27-year-old employee of Royal Crown Cola in Columbus,
plans to return to Galien, Mich., the couple's hometown, where his
mother will help him care for the infant. Meantime, he will depend
on Kari Stewart and Toni Vazquez, both mothers whose husbands are
medics in the battalion.
   Mrs. Vazquez said she can sympathize with Ms. Vallance because
she was separated from her infant son for three months in 1985.
   ``How can I explain it?'' Mrs. Vazquez said. ``It's like _
you're pregnant for nine months. You've waited all this time for
this chance, and then this chance is ripped out of your arms.
Basically, I cried the whole time.''
   As the buses full of soldiers began to roll out, Kirk gathered
his child in his arms and followed the crowd that surged to the
curb. Howitzers boomed a salute, and the band struck up the tune
``Dogface Soldier.''
   Soldiers could be seen dimly through the bus windows, their
faces pressed to the glass.
   Kirk, his eyes welling up, strained to see his wife, but with no
luck.
   He could only hope she had seen them.

   Sitting on carpets donated by Saudi Arabia,
about 10,000 Palestinian Moslems on Friday urged on a mosque
preacher railing against the Saudis and Americans for confronting
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   Moslems and Arabs in Moscow, Bangladesh, Amsterdam, and Malaysia
also protested the U.S. military deployment in the Persian Gulf
region, and most expressed support for Saddam's takover of Kuwait.
   In Moscow, about 100 Arabs waving Iraqi flags and color posters
of Saddam marched past the U.S. Embassy at midday and shouted
anti-American slogans for about 30 minutes. They dispersed after a
U.S. Embassy official agreed to speak briefly to a representative.
   ``Down with America and also Bush,'' said Sami Kamil, a doctor
from Libya. ``It's our land, Arab land. We must control it. No
Americans, no one from outside .. We don't want anybody there.''
   The protest was organized by Arab students, said Ahmed Jassam, a
physics student at Moscow University. He said the crowd included
citizens of 10 countries.
   A larger protest occurred Friday in Dhaka, the capital of
Bangladesh, where hundreds of 400 Moslems demanded the withdrawal
of U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia. Unlike protesters in the other
countries, they also demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from
Kuwait, which has been occupied since Aug. 2.
   More than 200 members of the fundamentalist Khelafat Andolan, or
Caliphs' Revolution, marched from the Baitul Mukarram Mosque to the
nearby National Press Club. ``Iraq get out of Kuwait!'' they
chanted. ``Down with American imperialism! Americans get out of the
holy land of Saudi Arabia!''
   Nearly 200 youths converged on the press club at the same time.
Their speakers said the world should pressure Saddam and President
Bush to resolve the gulf crisis through negotiations.
   The biggest show of support for the Iraqi leader was in
Jerusalem, where thousands of Palestinian Moslems cried ``Amen!''
as Mohammed al-Kafrawi, chief preacher of the Al Aqsa mosque,
praised Saddam and referred to Americans and Europeans as ``new
crusaders'' making war on the Arab nation.
   ``God, make the desert a mass grave for the Americans,''
al-Kafrawi said.
   Al Aqsa and the adjacent Dome of the Rock are regarded as the
third holiest sites in Islam after Mecca and Medina in Saudi
Arabia. Their importance is evinced by the Saudi-donated carpets
with the country's symbol of crossed swords and a palm tree.
   Friday noon prayers at Al Aqsa are the most important of the
week for Moslems, and the enthusiastic response to al-Kafrawi's
sermon signaled the Palestinians' anger at Saudi Arabia for
inviting the Americans into the country to defend against Iraqi
agression.
   Referring to Saddam, the mosque preacher said ``Leader of Iraq
... for the dignity of Islam, persist in your struggle to get rid
of the American intervention and the forces of treason.''
   Islamic fundamentalists and Palestinian activists also
distributed anti-Saudi and anti-American leaflets to the crowd.
   Several dozen ethnic Arabs demonstrated outside the U.S.
Consulate in Amsterdam on Friday to protest U.S. military presence
in the Persian Gulf. No incidents were reported.
   Shouting ``Down with America!'' and ``Bush out of the gulf!''
the protesters carried banners that read ``America out of the
Middle East'' and ``No War in the Gulf.''
   There are about 400,000 Moslems in the Netherlands. Most have
origins in Morocco, Turkey and Indonesia.
   In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, protesters burned an American flag
and carried anti-American banners in front of the U.S. Embassy in a
demonstration against the military deployment in Saudi Arabia.
   About 1,500 members and supporters of the opposition
Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party participated in the peaceful 90-minute
protest. They carried banners and placards which among other things
read ``Go to hell America.''

<DATELINE>ZAGREB, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities in the Croatian state
moved Friday to head off an ethnic insurgency with a promise not to
trample the human and political rights of Serbs.
   But a proposed resolution demanded the immediate disbanding of
armed vigilante groups set up by Serbs, who are the largest
Yugoslav ethnic group but make up only 11 percent of Croatia's 5
million people.
   Serbs charge Croatian President Franjo Tudjman's new,
reform-minded government with fostering Croatian nationalism at
their expense.
   The state parliament dominated by Tudjman's center-right
Croatian Democratic Union on Friday was discussing a draft
resolution apparently meant to ease ethnic tensions.
   It said the Croatian leadership ``is determined to ensure all
human, political and national rights for Croats and Serbs ... at
least to the extent that such rights are guaranteed by democratic
nations in Europe and America.'' The resolution also called for
authorities to ``undertake decisive political and criminal
sanctions against the (organizers of) political violence, banditry
and terrorism.''
   Croatians, who are Roman Catholic, dominate the western half of
Yugoslavia, while Orthodox Serbs form the majority in the south of
the country. The two ethnic groups have been rivals since they were
united within Yugoslavia in 1918.
   Tensions flared late last week after Croatia's Serbs announced a
planned referendum on autonomy for their region in southwestern
Croatia.
   The Croatian government prohibited the plebiscite, but thousands
of Serbs defied the ban and voted over the weekend. Although the
atmosphere was confrontational, no serious trouble was reported.
   Tudjman, whose party overwhelmingly won the first multiparty
election in Croatia in more than 50 years, blames the dispute on
the Communist government of Serbia, the largest Yugoslav republic.
   He said Serbs in Croatia were insufficiently represented in the
state government because their leaders decided to boycott
parliament. Ratko Licina, the sole deputy of the Serb party
attending the Friday session, said his party would continue to
boycott the legislature, which he decribed as undemocratic.
   Tudjman also announced leadership changes, including the ouster
of Stipe Suvar, a longtime Communist who was the state's
representative on Yugoslavia's eight-man presidency. He would be
replaced by Croatian Premier Stipe Mesic, who was jailed for two
years in the mid-1970s for anti-communism.

<HEAD>Report Shows Economic Weakness Before Persian Gulf Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a sluggish annual
rate of 1.2 percent from April through June, the government said
Friday in a report that showed widespread economic weakness even
before the Persian Gulf crisis heightened fears of an impending
recession.
   The Commerce Department report showed that the gross national
product, the total output of goods and services, grew for the fifth
consecutive quarter at a pace below 2 percent.
   The report, which showed no change in the overall GNP figure
from a preliminary snapshot released a month ago, was a
disappointment to many economists who had been looking for at least
a small upward revision.
   The report showed that the country's trade deficit worsened in
the spring, although at a slower pace than originally believed,
while business spending on plant and equipment expansion and
housing construction both dropped sharply.
   Only a big rise in business inventories, growth in government
spending and a weak increase in consumer purchases kept the overall
GNP number from being negative.
   Many economists believe that the second quarter weakness is
likely to be exacerbated by the Mideast tensions, which have sent
oil prices surging by 50 percent and badly shaken consumer
confidence, according to recent surveys.
   ``We don't have a recession in the forecast yet, but it will be
a close call,'' said Bob Diely, a senior economist at Northern
Trust Co. in Chicago. ``The outbreak of shooting in the Middle East
or some other jolt to consumer confidence could tear up the current
forecast very quickly.''
   Some of the more pessimistic economists, however, believe that a
downturn is imminent regardless of whether Mideast hostilities
escalate.
   They said the current expansion since the 1981-82 recession has
already lasted a peacetime record of nearly eight years and has
been exhibiting extreme sluggishness for more than a year.
   ``This is a case of downward momentum being intensified by
events in the Middle East,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of
the Boston Co. ``The economy is caving and there is nothing out
there to offset the weakness.''
   Bruce Steinberg, a senior forecaster at Merrill Lynch, the New
York brokerage firm, said, ``Every time over the past 40 years that
we have had growth this slow for a year, the U.S. economy was
either entering a recession or already in a recession.''
   The Bush administration, however, viewed the GNP performance
with far less pessimism, noting that the revisions showed more
balance because of a smaller rise in inventories than the initial
report last month.
   At a briefing in Kennebunkport, Me., White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said the GNP report confirmed that the economy
``was indeed still growing'' although he stressed the need for the
administration to reach agreement with Congress on ways to control
the spiraling budget deficit.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who flew to Maine for a
meeting Friday
   with President Bush on the budget negotiations, recently
predicted that the turmoil in the Mideast and the accompanying jump
in oil prices could slash the weak 1.5 percent average growth in
the first half of the year in half, down to a rate of 0.75 percent
in the last two quarters of 1990.
   The administration has been pressuring the Federal Reserve to
insure that growth does not go any lower by reducing interest rates
as a way of stimulating the economy.
   While Fed policy makers met behind closed doors on Tuesday to
review monetary policy, analysts said they could detect no signs
that the central bank was heeding the administration's pleas.
   Private economists said it was unlikely that the Fed would
relent and lower interest rates now that higher energy prices
threatened to kick off another price spiral.
   For the second quarter, a consumer price index tied to the GNP
showed prices rising at an annual rate of 3.9 percent. This was
unchanged from a month ago, but it was a significant improvement
from a 6.6 percent jump in prices in the first three months of the
year.
   However, analysts are predicting inflation will worsen in coming
months as the impact of higher oil prices is felt.
   Inflation and recession fears have roiled financial markets in
recent weeks although the stock market steadied somewhat on Friday
after a big sell-off the day before.
   After the Dow Jones industrial average had lost nearly 77 points
on Thursday, it was up just over 7 points in late afternoon trading
Friday.
   The Commerce Department also reported Friday that after-tax
profits earned by American corporations slipped 0.2 percent in the
second quarter, compared to a tiny 0.5 percent increase in the
first quarter. It was the worst showing since a 5.9 percent decline
in the third quarter of 1989.
   Economists said the weakness reflected the overall weak economy
and predicted even more pressure on profits if the economy slides
into a recession.
   The second quarter GNP, which left the economy growing at an
inflation adjusted total of $4.16 trillion, was the weakest showing
since a barely discernible 0.3 percent advance in the fourth
quarter of 1989.

   Iraq is violating international laws on the
rights of diplomats that date to biblical times and are considered
basic to relations between nations, legal experts said Friday.
   Iraq's attempt to close the embassies in occupied Kuwait has
``simply no legal authority,'' said international lawyer David
Scheffer of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
   The detention of 100 American diplomats and dependents trying to
leave Kuwait by way of Baghdad is an even more blatant rejection of
international norms, legalists said.
   ``You don't interfere with the freedom of mobility of
diplomats,'' said David Koplow, law professor at Georgetown Law
School. ``That's one of the fundamental principles.''
   Iraq is a signatory to both the 1961 and 1963 Vienna conventions
on diplomatic relations and consular affairs, agreements that
explicitly spell out such areas as diplomatic immunity and the
extraterritoriality of embassies.
   Those conventions say a nation cannot arbitrarily close the
diplomatic mission of another country unless it first breaks
relations with that country. It may not expel diplomats unless it
declares them ``persona non grata.'' Iraq has done neither.
   David Steigman, assistant dean in the Georgetown School of
Foreign Service, said Iraq may claim that the embassies must go
because Kuwait no longer exists, but ``in eyes of the world there
is still an independent Kuwait.''
   The principle of diplomatic immunity _ under which diplomats
have freedom of movement and are free from arrest or taxation _ has
its roots in biblical times.
   King Hanun of the Ammonites, who lived not far from present-day
Iraq, accused King David's envoys of spying, shaved off half their
beards and stripped them. David was so incensed by this diplomatic
impropriety that he went to war.
   The formal laws of diplomacy began to evolve with the
establishment of the first permanent diplomatic missions in the
Italian city-states of the 15th century, and were codified in the
1815 Congress of Vienna.
   Scheffer said Iraq, by detaining American civilians and
diplomats, also has broken a commerce and navigation treaty with
the United States that guarantees the safe transit of people and
goods through the countries, and the 1949 Geneva Convention
protecting civilians during wartime.
   If Iraq declared war on the United States _ which it has not _
it would have the right under the Geneva Convention to intern
American citizens in the interests of national security.
   The United States interned German and Japanese nationals during
World War II, and even restricted the movements of diplomats until
exchanges for American diplomats could be arranged.
   But the Geneva Convention also states explicitly that hostile
nationals may not be used as shields to protect military
installations. Iraq has begun moving Westerners to facilities that
would be targeted in a military attack on the country.
   There are precedents for closing embassies in an occupied
country. The Soviet Union shut down the embassies in Lithuania and
other Baltic states after taking over those countries in 1939 and
1940.
   Foreign missions closed their doors days after Nazi Germany's
1938 invasion of Austria.
   ``We still feel today this was a grave mistake,'' said Philipp
Hoyos, charge d'affaires of the Austrian Embassy in Washington.
``We had the impression no one was interested in our independence.
It's something we resent.''
   There has also been the occasional takeover of embassies, the
best-known being the seizure of the U.S. embassy in Iran in 1979
and the holding of 52 American hostages for 444 days.
   U.S. troops forced their way into the residence of the
ambassador of Nicaragua during the U.S. invasion of Panama in
December. President Bush said that violation was a ``screw-up.''

   As thousands of refugees fleeing Iraq and
occupied Kuwait continued to stream across the border, the Interior
Ministry announced Friday that it would officially reopen the
frontier.
   The Interior Minstry said 20,000 people a day will be allowed to
cross the border at Ruweishid, the official Jordanian news agency,
Petra, reported Friday.
   Jordan had announced Wednesday it was closing its border with
Iraq, saying the tens of thousands of refugees flooding into the
country had put an impossible strain on the country since the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Despite the official closure, about 6,000 people crossed the
border late Thursday and early Friday.
   Most of them were Arab or Asian, said a security official at the
desert border post 211 miles northeast of Amman.
   Other refugees arrived Friday at Amman's airport, including a
15-year-old Scottish boy who had been stranded without his family
for 22 days in Kuwait City. Alan Barnett seemed to be in good
health when he arrived at Queen Alia International Airport aboard
an Iraqi Airways flight.
   Two Americans on the flight, a young married couple, refused to
talk to reporters. They were identified only as Mr. and Mrs Gray by
U.N. officials at the airport. The U.S. Embassy refused to release
any information about the pair.
   The couple appeared to be the first Americans except for
diplomats to leave Iraq since Tuesday. The other people on board
the plane were predominantly Thais and Arabs.
   For almost a week, Iraqi Airways has been flying one daily
flight of about 170 passengers from Iraq and Kuwait to Jordan.
   King Hussein returned from a short visit to Sudan and Yemen,
where he met with the leaders of the two countries as part of
efforts to find a peaceful solution to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The king arrived about the time an anti-American demostration
was taking place in the streets of the Jordanian capital. Islamic
leaders called for freeing Saudi Arabia from the ``occupation'' by
foreign troops, a reference to the thousands of American soldiers
pouring into the country.
   ``All of you should participate in this Jihad (Holy War) to
liberate our holy shrines in Saudi Arabia and elsewhere ... from
the foreign occupier,'' said Ahmad Hilavel, undersecretary of
Jordan's Ministry of Religious Affairs.
   Several other demonstrations took place in other Jordanian
cities following the traditional Friday prayer.
   Anti-American, pro-Iraqi demonstrations have become a daily
occurrence in Jordan.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters
Thursday in Washington that the U.S. Embassy in Amman released
$25,000 to help Jordan care for the refugees.
   He said that the United States had provided 18,000 prepackaged
meals for the evacuees and was considering further assistance.
   Norway on Friday pledged $332,000 to Jordan to help care for
refugees. In Geneva, a U.N. officials said a planeload of 30 to 40
tons of emergency aid, including food, drinking water, blankets and
garbage bags would leave from Italy for Jordan on Monday or Tuesday.
   Mohammad Khatib, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. Disaster
Relief Organization, said the U.N. has allocated $30,000 for
immediate aid to Jordan.

<HEAD>Moderates Seek More Control of Denomination's Finances</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moderate Southern Baptists voted Friday to take
control of some church offerings usually managed by the
denomination's fundamentalist leaders.
   The architects of the alternative funding plan insisted,
however, that the vote was not a prelude to a split by moderates
from the Southern Baptist Convention. The group _ the world's
largest Protestant denomination with 14.9 million members _ has
been immersed in a dispute between moderates and conservatives for
more than a decade.
   ``We're all Southern Baptists here. We're still Southern
Baptists. But we have created a dual alignment so we can support
missions we believe in,'' said the Rev. Jimmy Allen, a moderate who
is president of Faith &amp; Families Ministries Inc. in Fort Worth,
Texas.
   ``This is a determination to support things we believe in, and
to not support things we don't believe in.''
   The Rev. David Sapp, who presented the funding proposal to about
2,500 Southern Baptists attending a three-day meeting in Atlanta,
said the moderates were forced to come up with the plan because
they have been stripped of a voice in deciding how denomination
collections are allocated.
   ``This is the first time in Baptist history that a group of
people have been systematically excluded from a voice in how funds
are spent,'' said Sapp, pastor of the First Baptist Church of
Chamblee.
   The funding plan, approved by a show of hands, would be
implemented on an interim basis beginning in October and refined
into a permanent system at a meeting next spring. It establishes
the Baptist Cooperative Mission Program, to which moderate churches
could send money they normally give to the convention for such
national programs as seminaries and missions.
   Leaders of the moderate faction would not say how much money
might come through the new system.
   Conservatives, who believe in the inerrancy of the Bible and say
those who disagree are not true Christians, have gained increasing
control of the Southern Baptist Convention over the last 12 years.
Moderates, who advocate local church autonomy and a greater role
for women and minorities, say the conservatives are running the
denomination with an iron fist.
   Officials of the convention could not be reached immediately for
comment Friday. A woman reached at the convention headquarters in
Nashville, Tenn., said the spokesman was out of the office.
   Those who helped draft the moderates' funding plan denied it was
an attempt to undermine the Southern Baptist Convention. They said
their differences are political and not spiritual.
   They said the system would merely ensure that money donated from
moderate churches does not pay for programs that exclude moderate
input.
   ``They (fundamentalists) will accept responsibility for funding
their own agenda,'' said the Rev. Alfred Ayscue, pastor at Calvary
Baptist Church in Mount Airy, N.C.
   ``To say we are dangling money before them is not what this
meeting is about,'' Ayscue said. ``We are taking the money and
making it reflect the principles we have.''
   The moderate leaders stressed that no money would be withheld
from missionaries in the field.
   Allen declined to identify which programs the moderates might
refuse to fund, though he said ``we don't like what happened at the
Baptist Press.''
   The governing board of the Southern Baptist Convention recently
fired two top editors of the Baptist Press, the SBC's news service,
after they were accused of producing reports biased against
fundamentalists.
   Some participants in Friday's meeting cautioned against going
too far with the funding program. The Rev. Bill Sherman, pastor of
Woodmont Baptist Church in Nashville, said: ``In the minds of many
people, this is a seismic step. ... We can go no further than the
people who give us the money will allow.''
   The meeting is scheduled to conclude Saturday after an interim
steering committee for the group is elected.

   The United States is providing $1 million and
500 tents to help Jordan deal with a crush of refugees from Iraq
and Kuwait, the State Department said Friday.
   ``We recognize the burden on Jordan caused by tens of thousands
of persons who are fleeing Iraq and Kuwait,'' said Richard Boucher,
the department's deputy spokesman.
   Boucher said some of the money will be made available to the
U.S. Embassy in Amman, the Jordanian capital, to help meet ``urgent
humanitarian needs'' in and near the city. Boucher had said
Thursday that the embassy released $25,000 to help Jordan care for
the refugees and the United States had provided 18,000 prepackaged
meals for the evacuees.
   The State Department also is engaged in discussions with the
International Committee of the Red Cross, which in turn is working
with the Jordanian Red Crescent ``in the border area where the
immediate needs are the greatest,'' Boucher said.
   He said other governments also are providing humanitarian aid
and the United States is working with the United Nations and other
international organizations ``to provide additional assistance in
the most effective and coordinated manner.''
   ``The United States is certainly prepared to do more as the
needs require,'' Baker said.

<HEAD>Doctor in Camarena Torture-Murder Case Ordered Held Without Bail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Friday denied bail for a doctor
abducted in Mexico so he could stand trial in the United States in
the torture-death of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent
Enrique Camarena.
   Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were tortured and
killed in Guadalajara in 1985. Nearly 50 people have been arrested
in connection with the case in Mexico, and the United States and
several have been convicted.
   Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was charged with violent crimes in
aid of racketeering, conspiracy, kidnap and murder. Prosecutors
said he administered drugs to keep Camarena alive while he was
being tortured prior to death.
   The alleged kidnapping of the Guadalajara gynecologist on April
2 has strained relations between the United States and Mexico.
Mexican officials including President Carlos Salinas de Gortari
have called the operation a violation of their national sovereignty.
   Alvarez was ordered detained without bail by U.S. District Judge
Edward Rafeedie, who said he was a ``flight risk.''
   When Alvarez asked for bail, he told Rafeedie: ``I want to
assure you that I would under no circumstances return to Mexico.
... I just want you to have a little trust in me so that I can
prove to you that I'm innocent.''
   The judge answered: ``Unfortunately, it is not the subjective
intentions that govern. You have to look at the objective factors.
... I regret that the defendant must be held in custody pending
appeal.''
   The judge ruled Aug. 10 that Alvarez was kidnapped illegally and
should be returned to Mexico. But prosecutors appealed to the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal, which issued an emergency order late
Thursday to stay Rafeedie's decision.
   Alvarez was in the courtroom during Friday's half-hour bail
hearing. U.S. authorities said in their appeal that they would have
``virtually no chance'' of getting Alvarez back in custody if he
was repatriated.
   Rafeedie said earlier this month that the United States abducted
Alvarez in violation of an extradition treaty with Mexico, that the
kidnapping was an offense to Mexico's sovereignty and that his
court lacked the jurisdiction to try the physician.
   If convicted, he could be sentenced to life in prison.
   In hearings on the case last spring, the DEA acknowledged it had
paid $20,000 plus $6,000 a week in expenses to people who brought
Alvarez to the United States to face charges.
   Prosecutors said the slayings of Camarena and Avelar were
revenge for DEA raids on marijuana and cocaine plantations that
cost the drug barons $5 billion in profits.
   The 31-year-old Camarena was kidnapped off a Guadalajara street
in February 1985. Testimony showed the agent was tortured and
interrogated by drug lords before being slain along with Avelar.

<HEAD>Iraqi Pilots Try Escape From French Military Base</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police arrested four Iraqi air force pilots who
tried to flee a French military base where they had been held since
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, police said Friday.
   One of the Iraqis, apprehended at Charles de Gaulle-Roissy
airport, held a valid ticket for a Royal Jordanian Airlines flight
to Amman, Jordan, police said. Officials were unable to say how the
pilot had come by the ticket or whether he had accomplices.
   Police sources said he had fled the Interarmy Formation Center
at La Rochelle, 290 miles west of Paris, under the pretext of
visiting his girlfriend. Three other Iraqi pilots from the same
base were arrested Thursday on a train from La Rochelle bound for
Paris, authorities said. It was not clear how they had managed to
leave the base.
   The four were receiving fighter-pilot instruction at the La
Rochelle base. France has trained dozens of Iraqi fliers for more
than a decade. Another eight Iraqis were at the base taking
language courses.
   The training was canceled and all were grouped at the Interarmy
Formation Center after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. They
were under surveillance but able to move about freely, base
officials said.
   France supplied Iraq with about 25 percent of its military
equipment before the invasion and instructed many Iraqi servicemen
in how to use sophisticated equipment.

   A plane used by President Lyndon B. Johnson to
fly to his Texas ranch soon will be cruising through the unfriendly
skies above the coca-growing region of Peru, a State Department
official said Friday.
   ``On the 30th, the Navy is going to give us one of LBJ's old
airplanes to use down in Peru,'' said Steve Strain of the
department's bureau of International Narcotics Matters.
   The Convair turboprop will be used in the Upper Huallaga Valley
_ where much of the world's supply of coca leaf is grown _ to
transport personnel and supplies, Strain said.
   The aircraft, built in June 1956, will become part of the INM
air wing, which has more than 50 planes, he said.
   The plane never served as Air Force One, but Johnson flew it
occasionally to travel from the capital to his ranch, Strain said.

<TEXT>
   Bad weather and improper flight preparation
contributed to the plane crash that killed Rep. Mickey Leland,
D-Texas, and 15 others last year in Ethiopia, a report issued
Friday said.
   The Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority said the pilots erred by
``pushing too far and flying into an area of bad weather at a very
low altitude.''
   Leland, who was chairman of the House Select Committee on
Hunger, was flying from the Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa to
Fugnido, a refugee camp on the Sudanese border, to inspect relief
efforts. Three congressional staffers also died in the crash.
   The plane ran into a mountainside more than an hour after
takeoff Aug. 7, 1989. ``The flight crew may have failed to maintain
visual ground contact and unknowingly collided with a mountain,''
the agency concluded.
   The crash destroyed an emergency transmitter on the plane that
could have helped rescuers. The wreckage wasn't found for a week.
   The plane, a 1980 Twin Otter, had no defects and crew members
reported no problems during the flight, the report said.
   Low clouds and rain dotted the intended route. The report said
the flight crew deviated from a planned altitude of 12,500 feet
because of bad weather.
   Witnesses who saw the plane 25 miles and 7 miles before it
crashed told authorities it was flying below the clouds at a low
altitude.
   The report suggests the crew, which was familiar with the route,
was unable to follow the path of a river because of scattered rain
showers. Investigators could not determine whether the pilot or
copilot was flying the plane when it crashed.
   The tight flight schedule may have pressured the crew to fly in
bad weather, the report said. Organizers, including Leland, and the
crew discussed weather-related delays, it said.
   ``The long delay on the one hand and the importance of the
mission on the other may have created undue pressure and uneasiness
on the flight crew,'' the report said.
   Leland was making his second trip to the border region to focus
attention on the hunger needs of Sudanese whose homes had been
ruined by civil war.
   The Ethiopian agency's report was released by the National
Transportation Safety Board. A Canadian safety expert also
participated because the aircraft was built in Canada.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Says Calls Still Not Getting Through to Iraq, Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans worried about friends, relatives or
business associates in Iraq and Kuwait still can't get through by
telephone, an American Telephone and Telegraph Co. official said
Friday.
   AT&amp;T estimates that about 1,000 calls a day have been completed
from Iraq to the United States in the past week, but no calls have
gotten through in the other direction, said company spokesman Herb
Linnen.
   Callers have been unable to reach Kuwait since about 36 hours
after the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion, Linnen said.
   Customers at MCI, the nation's No. 2 long-distance company
behind AT&amp;T, also were not getting through to Iraq or Kuwait, MCI
spokesman Dave Thompson said.
   Linnen said AT&amp;T had added 87 circuits to Saudi Arabia and is
handling 30,000 calls a day to and from the kingdom, where the
United States is increasing its military buildup.
   Calling volumes between the United States and Jordan have more
than doubled, averaging 20,000 calls a day since the invasion.
   ``Because of higher than usual volumes, some customers may
encounter busy circuit conditions requiring them to call again,''
Linnen said.
   Normal calling patterns continue between Egypt and Israel, he
said.

   Reservists will step in to ease the
shortage at two of the nation's biggest naval hospitals, which were
drained of doctors and nurses when the hospital ships Comfort and
Mercy sailed for the Middle East.
   ``We should start getting reservists early next week,'' said
Tami Begasse, spokeswoman at Oakland Naval Hospital, a 225-bed
facility in the foothills above Oakland.
   ``We need them to backfill the people we lost when the Mercy
left. Our services are down about 60 percent,'' Begasse said Friday.
   The Pentagon announced on Thursday that about 46,700 reserves
will be called to active duty over the next five weeks. President
Bush has the authority to call up as many as 200,000 reserves for
up to 180 days without declaring a national emergency.
   Oakland Naval Hospital, known as Oak Knoll, usually has about
280 doctors and 150 nurses, Begasse said. About 80 members of the
medical corps, 16 dental officers and more than 2,000 other
staffers also work there, she said.
   About 800 hospital staffers sailed aboard the Mercy when it
departed Oakland on Aug. 16. Others were expected to be flown to
the ship before it reached the Persian Gulf, said Robert Borden,
military sealift command spokesman.
   At Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland, spokesman Lt. Cdr.
William Clyde said 1,100 uniformed medical personnel were on the
Comfort, which left Baltimore on Aug. 11, or deployed to other
Middle East assignments.
   Before the deployment, Bethesda had a hospital staff of 3,500.
   The hospital expected hundreds of reservists to fill the gap,
but did not know exactly when they would arrive, said Clyde.
   All elective surgery has been deferred and admissions are
limited to active duty emergency cases, Clyde said, but Walter Reed
Army Hospital and other hospitals are taking up some of the slack.
   The number of patients was reduced from 350 to 150 and some
wards were closed, but outpatient clinics were busy, Clyde said.
   In Oakland, the Mercy developed steering problems before the
ship set sail and the delay gave 290 medical staffers the chance to
go back to the Oakland hospital after administrators realized it
was critically understaffed.
   The hospital had been reduced to inpatient labor and delivery,
emergency room service and two 36-bed wards. Some patients were
transferred to other hospitals, Begasse said.
   ``We're looking forward to having the help,'' Begasse said. The
hospital, which previously had an average inpatient census of 170
per day, is handling only an average of 90 per day, he said.

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subliminal message of ``do it'' exists on an
album by the British rock band Judas Priest but it did not cause
two young fans to kill themselves, a judge ruled Friday.
   Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead said that while
messages can be found on the band's 1978 ``Stained Class'' album,
they were not intentional and did not cause the fans to form a
suicide pact.
   Whitehead said the words ``do it'' on the song ``Better By You,
Better Than Me,'' were the result of a ``chance combination of
sounds,'' but constituted a subliminal message nonetheless.
   ``Our immediate reaction is obviously one of great relief,''
said Rob Halford, the band's lead singer. ``It's a great day for
Judas Priest.''
   Speaking with The Associated Press from an undisclosed location
in Mexico, Halford said, ``We simply just want to get on with what
we do, playing rock 'n' roll and heavy metal music.''
   ``I am pleased with the result on the basic issues of the case.
I think we were completely vindicated,'' said defense lawyer
Suellen Fulstone.
   The defense maintained that the ``do it'' sounds were a huff of
breath by Halford, combined with the sounds of guitars.
   But in clearing the band of any liability in the case, Whitehead
said that co-defendant CBS Records refused to properly comply with
his order to find the original multi-track recordings of other
songs on the ``Stained Class'' album. He ordered the company to pay
$40,000 to the plaintiff's attorneys to reimburse them for the cost
of bringing the lawsuit.
   He said the defaults were not caused by the courtroom lawyers,
but by in-house counsel of CBS.
   Whitehead added that even if the master tapes had been found,
``the court does not believe that the ultimate outcome of the trial
would have been any different.''
   The families of the two suicide victims sued the band and CBS
records, claiming messages hidden in the crashing music touted
satanism and promoted suicide.
   Raymond Belknap, 18, died from a single blast from a shotgun
held in his mouth Dec. 23, 1985. James Vance, then 20, blew away
the lower portion of his face but survived three more years before
his death on Thanksgiving Day 1988 of complications from his
injuries and a reaction to medications.
   Attorneys for the families sought $6.2 million in damages at the
conclusion of a four-week trial.
   They said the subliminal message ``do it'' and purported
backward phrases glorifying death spurred the shootings.
   The defense maintained said the alleged blasphemous phrases were
``phonetic flukes,'' given credibility only by the power of
suggestion.
   The judge reluctantly agreed, saying, ``The power of suggestion
may serve to make the listener think he hears a certain phrase when
the singing is played backwards, even though he probably would not
have perceived the phrase without the power of suggestion.''
   While attorneys for the families raised ``grave suspicions in
the mind of the court,'' Whitehead said there was no credible
evidence that the messages were intentionally placed or that they
could be perceived even if they were.
   ``I'm a little bit disappointed about that,'' Halford said.
``There's never been a song written by Judas Priest that could be
conceived to condone suicide in any nature.''
   The defense blamed the youths' alcohol and substance abuse,
family violence and anti-social personalities for their suicides.
   The youths allegedly shot themselves after spending several
hours drinking beer, smoking marijuana and listening to the Judas
Priest album.
   Vivian Lynch, representing Vance's family, conceded during trial
that there were other factors in the youths' lives that made them
prone to suicide. But she said it was the music that compelled them
to shoot themselves against their own will.
   The judge disagreed.
   ``There exist other factors which explain the conduct of the
deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli,'' he said.

   Firefighters called to a burning house found
five people shot dead inside Friday, including two girls ages 4 and
8.
   Firefighters found the five bodies inside the home in the Queens
borough, all dead of gunshot wounds, said Joe McGee, a spokesman
for the Fire Department. They also found an empty gasoline can.
   The fire was extinguished quickly.
   Besides the two girls, the other victims were a teen-age girl, a
woman and a man, McGee said. He initially called it an apparent
murder-suicide, but later said that was not the case.
   The man was unrelated to the woman and girls, McGee said, but he
had no details.
   A neighbor, Elise Harrison, said she understood that a couple
and their two daughters lived in the house.
   ``There has been a crime,'' Ms. Harrison said. ``They're all
dead. Four bodies are lying on the lawn.''
   Ms. Harrison said she knew of no previous trouble at the house,
which is across the street and a few doors from hers.
   ``They seem to be such nice people. I used to talk to them, the
girls,'' she said. ``Halloween they'd come by and talk. And they
talk if you're passing by. It didn't seem there was any trouble.''
   Bob Leonard, at the Emergency Medical Service, said one
firefighter was hurt, apparently while trying to extinguish the
fire.

   The State Department said Friday that
Secretary of State James A. Baker III is managing the Persian Gulf
crisis even while he vacations at his Wyoming ranch.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said Baker remains in close touch with
key department officials.
   One U.S. official, asked about published speculation that
Baker's absence from Washington is a signal he's unhappy with the
military tone of U.S. policy, replied: ``I have absolutely no
indication of that.''
   ``If you look how avidly and energetically he has been engaged,
you can see that he is a key instrument in this policy,'' said the
official, who commented on condition he not be identified by name.
   Boucher said Baker had spoken by telephone in recent days to
President Bush, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze and the
foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Italy and West Germany.
Bush is vacationing in Maine.

   Federal Reserve policy-makers concluded in
July that inflation remained high enough to maintain current
interest rates despite a ``relatively slow'' economy, records
released Friday show.
   ``The staff projection prepared for this meeting suggested that
the economy would expand over the remainder of 1990 at around the
rate estimated for the first half of the year and at a slightly
faster pace in 1991,'' minutes of the July meeting said.
   But 10 days later, the central bank did lower the federal funds
rate _ the rate banks charge for overnight loans _ from 8.25
percent to 8 percent.
   However, the Fed said the action was intended to offset overly
cautious lending practices by the nation's banks and was not
implemented because of a weakening economy.
   In testimony before Congress in July, Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan said the central bank projected a 1990 growth rate of 1.5
percent to 2 percent, slightly slower than the Bush administration
forecast of 2.2 percent.
   Since then, however, the Commerce Department reported the
economy slowed from a 1.7 percent annual rate of growth in the
first quarter of 1990 to 1.2 percent in the second and there have
been signs of further weakness as the economy entered the second
half of the year.
   And the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has driven the price of
oil above $30 a barrel, both fueling inflationary pressures and
creating further concern that the fragile economy may be pushed
into a recession.
   The Federal Open Market Committee met again Tuesday but
decisions made then will not be announced for six weeks.
   However, economists believe that the committee voted to continue
current rates as a hedge against further inflation stemming from
the Middle East crisis.
   The committee had pushed short-term rates up beginning in 1988
to slow the economy and thus curb inflation. But as economic growth
weakened, the policy-makers began nudging short-term rates down
starting in June 1989.
   The Bush administration and many economists have been urging the
committee to permit interest rates to fall further to stimulate the
economy.
   ``The information reviewed at this (July 2-3) meeting suggested
that economic activity was continuing to expand but at a relatively
slow pace,'' the minutes said.
   Committee members ``generally saw sustained but subdued growth
in economic activity as a reasonable expectation for the next
several quarters,'' they continued.
   At the same time, the minutes said that while prices had
moderated since earlier in the year, ``there was little evidence of
significant change in the trend rate of inflation.''
   The minutes reported the members also discussed two special
factors that added to the uncertainties bearing on the economic
outlook: the timing and extent of any reduction in the federal
budget deficit and tightened credit.
   At the end of the meeting, the members voted 11-0 to maintain
current interest rates. Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, who is
resigning, did not attend the meeting.
   The committee is made up of the seven Fed governors and five of
the 12 presidents of Fed regional banks. It meets in secret eight
times a year to formulate monetary policy. Minutes are released
about six weeks later, a few days after the next meeting.

   The government imposed
emergency measures Friday on black townships hit by fierce ethnic
fighting and ordered in more police and soldiers to try to end
strife that has claimed more than 500 lives.
   African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela later met with
President F.W. de Klerk. Mandela said negotiations with the
government would continue despite what he called an unnecessary
move declaring the townships around Johannesburg ``unrest areas.''
   ``We are the architects and we are determined they (the talks)
will succeed,'' he said.
   In an earlier speech, de Klerk said the government would not
permit the country to deteriorate into anarchy.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok announced the emergency
measures in Pretoria on a day of little serious fighting in the
townships. Police reported finding six bodies in various townships
from previous fighting.
   In Kagiso township, police used razor wire, shotguns and tear
gas to keep rival war bands apart. A police spokeswoman said some
fighting broke out, and a 4-year-old child was seriously injured
when hit by an axe.
   Police reinforcements were sent to the township, the spokeswoman
said.
   Most other areas were reported calm.
   Friday's announcement came almost two weeks after political and
tribal clashes between Zulus loyal to the conservative Inkatha
political movement and Xhosas, most of them ANC supporters, flared.
   ``It is in the interest of South Africa and all its inhabitants
that further bloodshed, disorder and chaos be prevented at all
costs,'' Vlok said.
   He noted that black leaders had called for police to stop the
township violence, but said the government had not consulted the
ANC about the steps.
   Vlok announced:
   _The number of police and soldiers in the emergency areas would
be ``drastically increased.''
   _People in the unrest areas would not be allowed to carry a wide
range of weapons at public meetings. The banned weapons included
firebombs, spears, battle axes, garden forks, knives and machetes.
   _The measures would last for three months, but could be extended.
   ``Should these measures not have the required effect, I shall
not hesitate to institute stricter measures,'' he said.
   Vlok told journalists the crackdown would not restrict reporting
in the affected areas, as a nationwide state of emergency imposed
in 1985 did. The government lifted the emergency on June 8 in all
areas except for Natal province because of continued black
factional fighting there.
   The ANC demanded lifting of the nationwide state of emergency as
a condition of formal talks with the white-led government on a new
constitution.
   Mandela, who leaves Saturday on a seven-day trip to Norway,
Libya and Algeria, said after meeting with de Klerk that the new
measures amounted to a state of emergency in the affected areas.
   He said the township trouble appeared rooted in the migrant
worker hostels, where blacks from tribal homelands live while
working in the Johannesburg area. Much of the fighting has pitted
hostel dwellers against township residents.
   Mandela said the ANC told Vlok last week that police should
monitor the hostels, prevent armed people from leaving them and
also stop area residents from attacking hostel dwellers.
   In Kagiso on Friday, youths set fire to five factory buildings,
causing thousands of dollars in damage, police said.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu visited the township and heard
angry residents demand that the hostels be torn down.
   Business Day newspaper reported the Kagiso violence caused
residents to stay home instead of going to work at the neighboring
Chamdor industrial area. Tom Wilson, a Chamdor manager, told the
newspaper half the workers were absent and production was down
about 50 percent.
   Police also clashed Friday in Vosloorus township with
stone-throwing protesters who tried to block streets with burning
tires and other debris.
   The fighting has continued despite pleas from government and
black leaders for peace and a strong police and army presence in
the townships. It is considered the most serious violence since
nationwide unrest in the mid-1980s.
   The ANC blames Inkatha for spreading black factional fighting
from the eastern Natal province to the townships near Johannesburg.
Inkatha accuses the ANC of trying to wipe out any competition for
power among black opposition groups.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, the system of segregation and
white dominance, but they differ on the shape of a future South
Africa.

<HEAD>Colorado Students Discover Anasazi Village Site</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DOVE CREEK, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two University of Colorado students who
were tracking bighorn sheep in southwest Colorado stumbled upon the
virtually untouched ruins of a lost Indian village more than 1,100
years old.
   The 6-acre Mountain Sheep Village, as the site is being called,
probably had about 200 structures and may have housed 150 to 200
Anasazi Indians as early as the year 850 A.D., said Kristie
Arrington, an archaeologist for the Bureau of Land Management.
   The students, Dave Merritt and Chris Kuzawa, struggled over the
rim of a cliff and found mounds and vertical slabs of sandstone
sticking out of the ground at the site by a forest of ponderosa
pine.
   ``We were just hiking around and we found it,'' said Merritt.
   The slabs are the foundations of structures made of poles, brush
and adobe.
   ``It was pretty spectacular,'' Kuzawa said. ``Once we realized
what it was, we started to look around. We stayed until dusk. We
knew we were on to something pretty big.''
   The discovery is significant because the site is on the north
side of the Dolores River, which wraps around it on three sides.
Previously, Anasazi ruins have been found only south of the river.
   The Anasazi, or ``Ancient Ones,'' lived in the Four Corners
area. Their best-known ruins are the cliff dwellings in Mesa Verde
National Park in southwestern Colorado. The newly discovered site
is about 60 miles northwest of Mesa Verde, not far from the Utah
border.
   Pottery fragments discovered by the students date the site about
300 years before the height of Mesa Verde cliff dwellings.
   Arrington said the people of Mountain Sheep Village may have
traded big game and timber with other villages in exchange for food
and pottery. She said tools associated with game procurement and
processing, such as arrowheads, scrapers and knives, have been
found on the ground.
   ``Local people hunting may have been through there and one area
shows evidence that it had been `potted' a little bit,'' said
Arrington. ``But it's fairly unusual that it hadn't been recorded
and documented before now.''
   Potting is a term used to describe the illegal digging for
Indian pots.
   Merritt and Kuzawa were working out of the Dolores Canyon
Research Center on a federal archaeology project this summer. The
project involves tracking desert bighorn sheep and river otters,
conducting an inventory of water invertebrates in the river and
probing historic mining sites.
   Arrington said BLM officials will have to decide how to manage
the site. ``It needs mapping. ... We would like to get an idea of
what was going on there day by day.'' He said no massive excavation
is planned.

   Rain fell over much of the East on Friday, causing flooding in
West Virginia, and rain also fell over parts of the South and the
Plains.
   Showers and thunderstorms during the afternoon reached from New
York state and the southern half of New England across Florida.
   More than 3 inches of rain fell in two hours during the morning
in the mountains of eastern West Virginia, flooding roads, homes
and businesses and washing away young trout from a state fish
hatchery, authorities said.
   About 35 homes near Marlinton, W.Va., suffered minor damage,
said Pocahontas County emergency services director Richard Barlow.
   High water flooded part of a fish hatchery near Marlinton and
washed away about 30,000 fingerling trout, said Don Phares,
director the the state's trout hatchery program.
   In addition to the loss of fish and damaged pools, the flood
caused about $15,000 in damage to supplies and equipment, Phares
said. ``The garage has a foot of mud in it. We probably lost 2,300
pounds of trout food,'' he said.
   Heavy rain fell around Long Island Sound, between New York's
Long Island and Connecticut.
   Rainfalls of 4 and 5 inches on Long Island caused extensive
street flooding, the National Weather Service said.
   On the north side of the sound, streets and highways flooded
across Bridgeport, Conn., the weather service said.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
4.93 inches at Islip, N.Y., on Long Island; 1.31 inches at
Bridgeport; and 4.10 inches at Norfolk, Va.
   Showers and thunderstorms also extended over Louisiana, eastern
Texas and the Texas Gulf Coast, Oklahoma, western Iowa,
southwestern Minnesota, eastern South Dakota, central North Dakota,
eastern Nebraska, Wisconsin and southwestern Lower Michigan.
   Elsewhere, rain also fell over western Montana, Idaho and
northeastern Nevada.
   A flood crest that has been moving down the Wabash River in
Indiana for several days reached Covington at almost 4 feet over
flood stage, the weather service said.
   Advisories for high heat indexes _ calculated from a combination
of temperature and humidity _ were posted through Saturday over
much of Arkansas. Indexes reaching 105 to 110 were forecast over
all the state except the northeast section, the weather service
said.
   Tucson, Ariz., cooled to a record low of 65, one degree below
the previous record for the date.
   Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 36 at Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 56 at
Salmon, Idaho, to 99 at Waco, Texas.

   The Bush administration on Friday leveled a
barrage of accusations and protests at Iraq as troops blocked the
U.S. Embassy in Kuwait and more than 100 American diplomats and
dependents were detained in Baghdad.
   The Iraqi news agency later carried a government announcement
that the dependents of foreign diplomats would be permitted to
leave Baghdad, but U.S. officials said Iraq had not notified
Washington and were unlikely to on the Moslem holy day of the week.
   ``This seems to be a credible report and if it turns out to be
true we will begin to move people out tomorrow,'' a U.S. official
told The Associated Press.
   While President Bush pondered his next moves and one of Saddam
Hussein's deadlines for closing the embassy passed, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater denounced the Iraqi leader for
enveloping Americans and other foreigners in a ``pattern of
harassment.''
   Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, accused Iraq of
``an outrageous breach of international law'' in preventing the
diplomats and family members, including about 30 children, from
leaving Baghdad after they had been promised safe passage.
   Boucher called it ``another stark example of Iraqi duplicity.''
   After the Americans had left Kuwait in a 33-car caravan the
Iraqis invoked new regulations to keep them in Baghdad at the end
of their 19-hour journey, Boucher said.
   The regulations, which were relayed from Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tarik Aziz to the Iraqi ambassador here, prohibit the departure
from Iraq of personnel from foreign embassies in Kuwait that stay
open in spite of Saddam's order, the State Department spokesman
said.
   Iraq had given two deadlines _ noon and midnight, Kuwait time _
for the missions to close. Boucher said that up to a dozen soldiers
appeared at the U.S. Embassy about 11 a.m. (3 a.m. EDT).
   An embassy vehicle was stopped as it tried to enter the
compound. One person inside, a private U.S. citizen, was permitted
to leave, Boucher said.
   Iraqi Ambassador Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat informed David Mack, a
deputy assistant secretary of state, of the new regulations in a
middle-of-the-night telephone call.
   Boucher said Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and his staff of about
10 would stay, keeping in touch with the 2,500 Americans trapped in
Kuwait ``as much as circumstances allow.'' They were keeping
telephone conversations short because Iraqis were listening in, the
U.S. official said.
   Iraqi guards had stood outside the embassy since Bush retaliated
against Saddam's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by organizing an
economic boycott of Iraq and dispatching a massive U.S. land and
sea force to the Persian Gulf area.
   But the troops that appeared Friday were the first to move into
position to block entry and exit from the embassy, Boucher said.
   Fitzwater, briefing reporters at Kennebunkport, Maine, as Bush
huddled with Brent Scowcroft, his national security adviser, said
he was not aware of any confrontation between the Iraqi soldiers
and the Americans inside.
   ``They have not made any move against the embassy or intruded in
any fashion,'' the president's spokesman said.
   Boucher said at least 20 other countries were refusing to
abandon their embassies, while a few had decided to close.
   ``I think what is clear to us is that Iraq has tried in a most
callous way to barter the security of foreign citizens for
concessions on the presence of diplomatic missions in Kuwait, and
that most countries are resisting this blatant violation of
diplomatic practice and international law,'' he said.
   The Americans who fled to Iraq were to be evacuated to Turkey,
Fitzwater said.
   He called their detention ``another troublesome element in the
overall pattern of harassment and hostage-taking kinds of
activities that Saddam Hussein has been engaged in.''
   Asked what Howell and his staff might do if the Iraqi soldiers
applied force, Fitzwater said: ``Should he be subject to that he
would have to act accordingly.''
   Thousands of American troops and an armada of warships are
within range of Iraq and Kuwait, but Bush gave no hint how he might
respond if Saddam attempted to overrun the embassy.
   Marine guards were withdrawn in the scaling down of the U.S.
diplomatic corps in Kuwait City. Officials said their primary
mission would have been to dispose of sensitive files and could not
have withstood a massive assault in any event.
   Even with the mounting crisis, Bush and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III mixed vacation with a long series of consultations.
   Bush went boating Thursday and played golf Friday morning with
two of his sons, George and John.
   Baker, while remaining at his ranch in Wyoming, spoke by
telephone twice with Bush, and also talked to Foreign Ministers
Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union and Hans-Dietrich
Genscher of West Germany.

   NASA is investigating the possibility
that Magellan keeps losing touch with Earth because its braking
rocket might not have fully separated after the spacecraft reached
Venus, engineers said Friday.
   Meanwhile, NASA released new photographs from Magellan that
showed a lava-filled, 20-mile-wide meteorite crater on the planet.
   Magellan project manager Tony Spear said another theory for the
lapses in radio contact is that the braking rocket pulled some
cables off or burned some cables as it was jettisoned when the
spacecraft went into orbit around Venus on Aug. 10.
   The braking rocket, which slowed Magellan so it could enter
orbit, was supposed to separate nine hours later, and most signs
are that it did so or at least started to do so, Spear said during
a news conference at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I believe personally the solid rocket motor is far away and
not bumping'' the craft, he said.
   But the possibility it didn't must be considered, said Frank
McKinney, program manager for Martin Marietta Corp., which built
Magellan.
   ``It's a possibility we're investigating,'' said spacecraft
system engineer John Slonski.
   Two hours after the news conference ended, the laboratory's
public relations office issued a statement saying there was
``currently no doubt the separation was complete.'' Spokesmen
refused to elaborate when asked to explain the contradiction
between that statement and those made by Slonski during the news
conference.
   Even if the rocket had not completely separated, it wouldn't
prevent Magellan from conducting its $744 million mission to use
radar to make maps and pictures, Spear said. Mapping is likely to
start no earlier than mid-September, two weeks later than planned,
he said.
   Magellan first lost radio contact with controllers on Aug. 16.
Until engineers identify and fix the problem that cut the radio
link, Spear said, ``I think it's likely to happen again.''
   If so, engineers are ready with new computer commands to ``kick
start'' Magellan's automatic safety systems and make the spacecraft
re-establish contact with Earth immediately, Spear said.
   Pictures released Friday, including a computer-processed
three-dimensional view, showed a meteorite impact crater that has a
very smooth floor and a central peak.
   The smooth floor indicates the crater was flooded by volcanic
lava, either because the meteorite punched through Venus' hot, thin
crust, or because the impact created cracks that let lava ooze into
the crater at some later time, said Magellan chief scientist Steve
Saunders. He said he favors the second theory.
   The crater first was observed by the Soviet Venera 15 and 16
spacecraft in the mid-1980s. Their pictures were 10 times less
detailed and couldn't determine if it was an impact crater or
created purely by volcanic eruption, Saunders said.
   He said the crater is relatively young geologically: 100 million
to 150 million years old. It is named after Soviet sculptor Anna
Golubkina, who lived from 1864 to 1927.
   Other pictures from Magellan showed intense ``Venusquake''
faulting, lava flows and a network of intersecting ridges and
valleys.
   Scientists also displayed a three-minute videotape assembled
from still pictures. It provides a Magellan-eye view of Venus as
the spacecraft swept over the planet.
   Contact with Magellan was lost for more than 14 hours starting
Aug. 16 and for 17{ hours starting Tuesday night.
   ``My heart can't stand this 17-hour loss of signal'' again,
Spear said. ``There are moments of terror and of great happiness
after we recovered the signal.''
   Engineers also are considering the possibility the
communications failures were caused by problems with Magellan's
computer hardware or programs, or the unlikely chance Magellan is
being affected by previously unknown electrical fields around Venus.
   ``Possibly we're making a scientific discovery, but this is a
hard way of doing it,'' Spear said.
   Evidence suggests that during its second radio outage, Magellan
wobbled back and forth ``at a high rate,'' using 5.7 pounds of fuel
as its thrusters kept firing, Slonski said. That still leaves 251
pounds of fuel, far more than needed to keep Magellan in orbit for
years longer than originally planned. The spacecraft used much less
thruster fuel than expected when it slipped into orbit.
   Magellan was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989,
and traveled a looping 948 million-mile route to Venus.

   Irish hostage Brian Keenan was freed by
his Lebanese captors on Friday after more than four years in
captivity, the fifth Western hostage released in five months. He
was reported en route to Damascus.
   The Irish government confirmed in Dublin a report from Iran's
official Islamic Republic News Agency that the 39-year-old teacher
was free, and Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins said: ``I can
tell you Brian is now on his way from Beirut to Damascus.''
   Iran, which has considerable influence among Shiite Moslem
fundamentalist groups in Lebanon, said it had worked for months to
help secure the release.
   A shadowy group calling itself The Organization of the Islamic
Dawn announced the release in a terse, typewritten Arabic statement
delivered to the Beirut newspaper An Nahar.
   ``We have decided to release Irish hostage Brian Keenan,'' it
said. ``This was done at exactly 9 p.m. Beirut time (2 p.m. EDT).''
   No group had claimed responsibility for kidnapping Keenan from
the time he was abducted until he was freed.
   An informed Syrian source said Friday night that Keenan ``was in
Syrian hands'' but would not appear in public and until Saturday,
when he would be handed over to the Irish foreign minister.
   The source, who spoke on condition he not be further identified,
would not say if Keenan was spending the night in Damascus or
somewhere in Syrian-controlled Lebanon.
   Almost all hostages released in Lebanon have been handed to
Syrian officers there and escorted to Damascus overland _ a trip
through winding mountainous roads that takes 2{ to 3 hours.
   Thirteen Westerners are still believed held by extremist Moslem
groups in Lebanon _ six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans
and an Italian. Most have been held more than three years, and
Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, has been held since March 16, 1985.
   The statement Friday from The Organization of Islamic Dawn was
just the second it has made a statement on hostages. On April 30,
it said it was freeing U.S. hostage Frank Reed. The Malden,
Mass.-born educator was released that day.
   Hostage Robert Polhill of New York was freed on April 22, and
two Swiss Red Cross workers, Elio Erriquez and Emmanuel Christen,
were freed this month.
   Reed, held 3{ years, said later he had been with Keenan. Reed's
wife, Fifi, said Friday that her husband would fly to Ireland later
to meet with Keenan.
   In Dublin, a sister of Keenan, Elaine Spence, burst into tears
of relief and joy at the news of her brother's release. She and
Keenan's other sister, Brenda Gillham, had driven there from
Belfast Friday as speculation grew stronger that their brother,
after many disappointments, would finally go free.
   The sisters were to fly to Syria early Saturday with Collins to
greet Keenan, the Irish foreign minister said in Dublin.
   Keenan was kidnapped by gunmen on April 11, 1986 in west Beirut
while walking to the American University in Beirut, where he worked
as a teacher of English. He was born in Belfast and was traveling
on an Irish passport, but is also a British citizen.
   IRNA had reported Thursday that a European hostage would be
released soon. On Friday, Iran's deputy foreign minister, Mahmoud
Vaezi, told the Tehran Times newspaper Keenan would be released and
said: ``We are thankful to the Islamic groups in Lebanon who once
more showed their goodwill toward the West.''
   Vaezi said the release resulted from ``several months of efforts
of the Iranian officials and Islamic groups in Lebanon.''
   ``We expect that the West will take similar steps for the
freedom of Lebanese prisoners and Iranian hostages. Such a move
will make our efforts for the freedom of a hostages easier.''
   Iran has linked the fate of Western hostages to that of four
Iranians kidnapped by Christian Lebanese Forces militiamen in July
1982. The four are widely believed to have been killed. But Iranian
leaders have stressed they would use their influence to help free
Western hostages in exchange for help in freeing the Iranians.
   Keenan spent most of his life in strife-torn Belfast, and he
dismissed the dangers of Beirut when he went there to teach in 1986.
   For four months, he taught at the university, writing home about
the beauty of Lebanon and the fine cuisine and nightlife in Beirut.
   On April 11, 1986, he rushed out of his apartment, late for an 8
a.m. lecture, and was abducted.
   His sisters said Keenan's mistake was to forget his Irish
passport when he left. They believe his kidnappers thought he was
American or British, rather than a citizen of a small neutral
country.
   Keenan was dubbed Britain's ``forgotten'' hostage because his
plight did not receive the same publicity as that of Anglican
Church Envoy Terry Waite and British television journalist John
McCarthy.

   Civil-rights leaders and school
officials met Thursday to end a boycott of classes by black
students who want more black administrators and teachers.
   The boycott at Jefferson County's three schools began Wednesday
after students learned a white teacher had been hired to replace a
vacancy left when a black teacher decided to take another job.
   A committee representing the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People presented school administrators with
a list of the students' demands, which included the hiring of black
administrators and black male teachers for the elementary school,
and that at least half of the school district's teachers be black
by 1993.
   Superintendent Bill McRae said he supported all those demands.
   ``The things they want are the things we want,'' he said,
calling the meeting ``very congenial.''
   ``I think the attitude of the school board finally gelled into
the realization that they had real problems before them,'' said
T.H. Poole Sr., head of the NAACP in Florida.
   Neither McRae nor Poole could say late Thursday afternoon if the
boycott would continue Friday.
   A total of 1,055 of the 2,150 students expected to enroll this
academic year were absent Thursday, said Alicia Dery, a school
secretary. About 1,200 did not go to school Wednesday, the first
day of the school year.
   Blacks comprise about 70 percent of the students at the
elementary, middle and high schools in Jefferson County, which is
just east of Tallahassee.
   Although only 36 percent of the teachers are black, the
statewide percentage of black teachers is just under 15 percent,
said Betty Messer, McRae's assistant.
   McRae said school systems throughout Florida are having a hard
time finding qualified black teachers. The pool of applicants
includes about 10 percent to 15 percent black teachers, he said.
   Jefferson County had planned to hire four black teachers and
four white teachers for the new school year, but earlier this month
one of the black applicants took a job in Georgia, McRae said. A
white teacher who had resigned at the end of last school year was
hired for the spot.
   The Jefferson school board Wednesday afternoon approved the
hiring of a fourth black teacher to replace another teacher
expected to take maternity leave this fall.

<HEAD>Four Killed in Tribal Violence; ANC Says Talks May Begin Soon</HEAD>

   Xhosa and Zulu war bands
fought running battles Thursday despite police efforts to keep them
apart with repeated volleys of tear gas, and four blacks died.
   The African National Congress said it could soon begin peace
talks with the Zulu-based Inkatha movement. Supporters of the two
groups are the main combatants in tribal fighting that has killed
more than 500 people in 12 days.
   Hundreds of heavily armed Xhosas said they wanted to destroy a
migrant workers hostel occupied by Zulus in Kagiso township west of
Johannesburg.
   ``I don't care if I die. We just want to fight with the Zulus!''
screamed one enraged Xhosa clutching a butcher knife.
   The two sides fought with spears, axes and clubs as police fired
tear gas. Roaming gangs of Zulus with red headbands looted and
burned deserted homes. Xhosas burned houses belonging to Zulu
residents.
   Police spokeswoman Lt. Henriette Bester said four people died,
including a woman shot by police trying to stop a crowd from
damaging and looting houses.
   Zulu and Xhosa leaders later held talks mediated by police, but
it seemed unlikely the meeting would end the bloodshed.
   Fighting between Zulus tied to the conservative Inkatha movement
and Xhosas, mostly followers of the ANC, erupted Aug. 12 and spread
throughout black townships around Johannesburg.
   Police said most townships were quiet Thursday except for
scattered incidents.
   The Zulu-Xhosa war has continued despite pleas for peace from
government and black leaders and a strong police and army presence
in the townships. It is considered the most serious violence since
nationwide unrest in the mid-1980s.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu cut short a visit to Canada
because of the violence. On Thursday he toured parts of Tokoza, a
hard-hit township.
   ``We have come to express solidarity with them,'' Tutu said of
the residents. ``Their pain is our pain.''
   Tutu asked for an international peacekeeping force to halt the
fighting.
   Political violence between ANC and Inkatha supporters has killed
about 5,000 blacks in Natal in the past five years.
   Inkatha accuses the ANC of trying to wipe out any competition
for power among black opposition groups.
   Both groups oppose apartheid, the system of racial segregation
and white dominance, but differ on the shape of a future South
Africa.
   Also Thursday, about 40 people, including ANC regional leaders,
were arrested at a demonstration in Cape Town protesting alleged
police torture.
   Other protesters, claiming human rights violations, marched in
Vereeniging, near Johannesburg; in Bloemfontein, to the south; and
in the Gazankulu homeland in the northeast.

   Oil matched an all-time high and unleaded
gasoline notched a seventh-straight record in the futures market
Thursday, as traders worried about the threat of combat in the
Mideast and troubles at two Texas refineries.
   ``Again, it's the possibility of war and the probability of
damage to Saudi oilfields if a war did occur,'' said Ann-Louise
Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   The price of light, sweet crude reached a high of $32.35 per
barrel for October delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
before slipping back to a close of $31.93, up 71 cents from
Wednesday. The high equaled a record set Aug. 2, 1983, the Merc
said.
   It was the second day oil stayed above the $30-per-barrel mark,
last seen in late 1985, but the market ``didn't have quite the
charge that it did yesterday,'' Hittle said. ``It was not quite
such a rush.''
   Traders responded to concerns over the international showdown
coming Friday, the deadline set by Iraq for nations to empty their
embassies in Kuwait. The United States has refused to comply with
Iraq's demand.
   Atlantic Richfield Co., which had frozen its wholesale price of
gasoline two weeks ago, on Thursday rose prices by an average of
2.5 cents a gallon. Arco had been able to hold prices down because
it refines its own crude, rather than buying in the volitile spot
market.
   However, increased demand has forced the company to pay high
spot-market prices and left as many as 160 stations running out of
gas every day, said George Babikian, head of Arco's marketing and
refining division. Arco said it was risking the wrath of consumers
by not being able to resupply stations quickly.
   The futures price of gasoline also rose Thursday, partly because
of problems at two Texas refineries.
   Unleaded gasoline hit an all-time high of $1.11 per gallon for
September delivery on the Merc, before settling at a record-high
closing price of $1.086, up 4.44 cents from Wednesday. Unleaded
gasoline has hit record closing prices every day since Aug. 15,
with prices at the pump rising in response.
   Shell Oil Co. said 165,000 barrels of crude cannot be refined
daily because of a fire Thursday at its plant in Deer Park, Texas,
although a spokesman was not sure how long repairs might take.
Also, a leak at the Crown Central Petroleum Corp. refinery in the
Houston area forced a partial shutdown that analysts said would
probably not disrupt supplies for more than a day or two.
   Hittle called the shortfall ``a pretty significant volume,
particularly given that we're already facing potential declines in
imports.''
   But analyst Bob Baker at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said
markets might have overreacted to the news from Texas.
   In other trading Thursday, home heating oil rose 4.88 cents per
gallon to close at 96.23 cents on September contracts, while
natural gas remained sluggish, falling from $1.555 to $1.545 per
1,000 cubic feet.

<TEXT>
   North and South Korea inched closer to
historic talks between their prime ministers Thursday when both
sides agreed to travel and telephone arrangements for the Sept. 4-7
meeting.
   Liaison officers met at the border village of Panmunjom and
agreed North Korean delegates would cross the heavily fortified
border by car and that the two sides could use Red Cross phone
lines. They agreed to meet again before September.
   In an interview with the newspaper Chosun Ilbo, President Roh
Tae-woo said South Korea would propose gradual arms reduction at
the meeting.
   He said the Communist North must give up its efforts to
overthrow the pro-Western South and accept his call for free travel
and economic exchanges between the two Koreas.
   Roh told his administration Thursday the talks could lead to
political and military discussions that could ease four decades of
bitter hostility on the divided Korean peninsula.
   The prime ministers _ Kang Young-hoon of South Korea and Yon
Hyung Muk of North Korea _ are figureheads with little
policy-making power, but the meeting would have symbolic
significance as the highest-level contact ever between North and
South.
   Opening the borders is seen as a step toward reunification of
the Koreas, which were divided in 1945 following Japan's collapse
in World War II. The two Koreas remain technically at war because
they never signed a peace treaty at the end of the Korean War in
1953.
   About 200 radical students yelling anti-government slogans
battled riot police with rocks and firebombs Thursday at Seoul's
Dank University. Riot police drove students back with tear gas.
   ``Down with Roh's deceitful unification policy!'' students
shouted.
   Radicals have accused Roh of insincerity in talks with North
Korea. They say he is trying to divert public attention from
pressing domestic issues and has no intention of following through
on his promises.
   The two Koreas have yet to solve several issues regarding the
prime ministers' meeting, including a memorandum guaranteeing
visitors' safety.
   The safety issue blocked a planned border opening in mid-August
after North Korea refused to discuss safety guarantees in writing
and asked for direct contacts with South Korean dissidents.
   The border has 1.5 million troops on each side.

<TEXT>
   Iowa police must release the names of
most rape victims to the news media, the state attorney general's
office said Friday, but newspaper editors and broadcasters said
they would continue to protect the names.
   The opinion quickly drew the wrath of a victim services
counselor, who said it would make sexual assault victims reluctant
to report crimes.
   In response to a request by Gov. Terry Branstad, assistant
attorney general Gordon Allen said state law does not permit police
to keep the names of rape victims confidential. The only exception,
he said, is when release of the name would jeopardize the
investigation or put the victim in danger.
   Branstad will seek to change the law to assure confidentiality,
said Richard Vohs, a spokesman for the governor.
   The issue came up earlier this year when The Des Moines Register
challenged the practice by Des Moines police of routinely
suppressing names and other information about rape victims. The
department has since released the names, but none has been used in
news stories.
   Although release doesn't mean the news media would use the
names, Polk County Victim Services counselor Terry Shock said many
victims won't understand that distinction.
   ``There will almost certainly be misconceptions,'' she said.
   She said society places a negative stigma on rape victims, as if
the woman somehow brought on the crime, and most victims simply do
not want anyone to know.
   ``Face it, people will be people. A lot of them will blame the
victim. A lot of people aren't going to report the crime or won't
even go to the hospital for fear that the hospital has to report
it,'' Ms. Shock said.
   She also said that when reporters have the names, there's room
for error that would allow the name to get in print.
   ``And somewhere or sometime, there's going to be journalists who
simply don't care,'' she said. ``It's just very unfair to the
victims.''
   Allen said he was sensitive to arguments about not releasing the
names, but he said the law makes no exception for rape victims.
   ``Due to the strong presumption in favor of disclosure of
governmental records frequently reiterated by the Iowa Supreme
Court, it is our view that (any doubts on the issue) would be
resolved in favor of disclosure,'' Allen wrote.
   The law allows police to withhold information which ``would
plainly and seriously jeopardize an investigation or pose a clear
and present danger to the safety of an individual.'' But Allen said
this exception cannot be applied to all rape cases.
   ``To the best of my knowledge, there is no other law in the
nation that attempts to devastate victims' lives like that,'' said
Anne Seymour, spokeswoman for the National Victim Center, based in
Fort Worth, Texas, and New York City. ``I'm 99 percent sure.''
   ``One of the critical reasons why victims say they don't report
the crimes ... is the fear of exposure,'' she said from New York.
   The National Victim Center serves over 7,000 local victim
service groups, Ms. Seymour said.
   Virtually all of Iowa's newspapers and radio and television
stations have said they would not use the name of rape victims
without permission from the victim.
   Mark Bowden, managing editor of The Gazette in Cedar Rapids,
said the opinion will not change his paper's policy of not
publishing the names.
   But Bowden said mistakes leading to the broadcast or publication
of a name could be made regardless of the law. ``You might have an
inexperienced reporter, but is that any different than having a
rookie at the police desk?'' he said.

   An American Legion post that has been
closed since it refused to admit a black Vietnam veteran last month
has agreed to allow him to reapply, the state American Legion
commander said Thursday.
   The veteran, Thurman Thompson, said he planned to submit another
application.
   ``What I would hope is that those who didn't want me, they would
re-evaluate their thoughts and situations,'' Thompson said. ``I
hope that everything ends on a positive note.''
   Norris Kinion, the state commander for the American Legion, said
the Fred H. Sexton Post 1 in Florence, 80 miles east of Columbia,
would be permitted to resume its normal activities if it accepted
black members.
   The post was suspended last week after it was disclosed that six
members of the post had decided not to accept Thompson because they
didn't want blacks joining their group.
   Thompson, a former Navy petty officer and signalman who served
in Vietnam in 1972-73, works at General Electric Co.
   At the time of the vote against Thompson, the post required just
two votes to reject an applicant. But the post changed its bylaws
Tuesday to allow a majority vote on all applications, Kinion said.
   The chapter's suspension has not been formally lifted, he said,
``but they're being permitted to function until such time as the
investigative committee can make its report.''
   The committee looking into the case will meet at the annual
convention of the American Legion starting Friday in Indianapolis,
Kinion said.
   Al Stein, commander of the Florence post, did not return a phone
call Thursday afternoon.
   The post's rejection of Thompson prompted several members to
resign.
   Maria Lewis, the post's secretary, was fired from her job as the
county veterans affairs officer. She had opposed Thompson's
membership on the grounds that the post's bylaws prohibited
integration.
   The American Legion has had black members since the organization
was created in 1919.

<HEAD>Forest Service Authorizes Telescopes on Mount Graham</HEAD>

   The U.S. Forest Service said Thursday it
had authorized the University of Arizona to build three telescopes
on Mount Graham after determining construction wouldn't harm an
endangered squirrel.
   The Justice and Agriculture departments signed off on the
project, saying a study by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service had
satisfied worries that the observatory, which would include the
world's most powerful telescope, would threaten the habitat of the
Mount Graham red squirrel.
   ``As soon as we can we'll sign relevant construction documents
and obtain our permit,'' said university spokesman Steve Emerine.
He said work would begin as soon as possible.
   Maricopa Audubon Society spokesman Robin Silver said in Phoenix
that attorneys for environmental groups opposed to the $200 million
project would be in court by Friday morning seeking a temporary
restraining order.
   Expert witnesses in the hearing ``will now include members of
Congress, the Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service biologists
and the General Acounting Office,'' Silver said.
   Rep. Morris K. Udall, D-Ariz., and other members of the Arizona
delegation oppose construction of the telescopes without further
study. Udall was out of town and couldn't be reached for comment.
   A survey earlier this year determined there were fewer than 150
of the half-pound rodents _ one of 25 genetically distinct
subspecies of the red squirrel _ scurrying over the mossy,
spruce-covered slopes of 10,500-foot Emerald Peak.
   The Justice Department had been reviewing a recommendation by a
team at the Fish and Wildlife Service that another biological study
be undertaken before construction begins on the mountain 125 miles
northeast of Tucson.
   Emerine said the university would work with the Forest Service
and Fish and Wildlife Service to create a buffer zone around the
construction site so as not to disturb the squirrel.
   A statement from George M. Leonard, associate chief of the
Forest Service, said further consultations would be made if the
project resulted in the deaths of more than six squirrels in any
one year.
   The university proposed the construction of the observatory in
1984. Its partners include the Smithsonian Institution, the Max
Planck Observatory of West Germany and the Vatican Observatory.
   In March, U.S. District Judge Alfredo C. Marquez granted the
request of environmental groups and issued a four-month injunction
barring construction on Emerald Peak. But an appeals court in San
Francisco overturned the delay in May.
   General Accounting Office investigators testified before a
congressional hearing in late June that the squirrel's fate had
become more precarious since the 1988 congressional act that
authorized construction of the telescopes.
   A springtime count indicated there were between 132 and 146 of
the squirrels left on the mountain, their only habitat.

   A robber masquerading as a police detective was
chased down a street by a group of angry residents and stabbed to
death, police said Thursday.
   The incident began Wednesday night when two men, identifying
themselves as police and displaying a gold badge, gained entry to
Carlos Rosario's apartment in the borough of the Bronx, police said.
   Once inside Rosario's apartment, one of the men announced a
robbery, and hit Rosario over the head with the butt of a gun.
   ``They took jewelry, and attempted to tie up the victim and his
wife,'' said detective Lt. James Malvey.
   Rosario began struggling with the robbers as his wife fled
screaming from the apartment. The two men also ran, with Rosario
chasing them, Malvey said.
   Rosario and about 10 other residents pursued the men for about
two blocks until one of the pair pulled a knife and stabbed Rosario
in the shoulder. The other robber fled.
   As Rosario ran for help to an ambulance parked across the
street, an unknown man jumped from the group and stabbed the fake
detective twice in the chest, said police spokeswoman Sgt. Tina
Mohrmann.
   The ambulance driver took the robber, who was identified as Jose
Abreu, 49, to Jacobi Hospital, where he was pronounced dead,
Mohrmann said. Rosario was treated at Jacobi for his stab wound.
   No arrests were made in the case.

   Just hours aftger President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
issued a stern warning to Iraq, the Soviets said Friday that they
were ending objections and backing Washington's call for using
force to ensure a U.N. trade embargo.
   In a message to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Gorbachev said
the situation in the Persian Gulf had become ``extremely
dangerous.''
   He said that Iraqi failure to comply with U.N. Security Council
resolutions _ by pulling out of Kuwait _ would ``inevitably prompt
the Security Council to take corresponding additional measures,''
the official Tass news agency said.
   Later Friday, Soviet U.N. Ambassador Valentin V. Lozinskiy said
the Soviets would now back a U.S. resolution in the Security
Council authorizing the use of ``minimal force'' to halt all trade
with Iraq. He also said the Soviets were considering participation
in an international naval police force that would enforce the
tightening of economic screws on Iraq.
   The United States, Britain and France had been trying to gain
Soviet support for a Security Council resolution approving the use
of force to impose the economic embargo on Iraq.
   The Security Council was expected to vote on the U.S. resolution
late Friday or early Saturday.
   Also Friday, the Soviet Union withdrew its embassy staff from
Kuwait before an Iraqi deadline ordering embassies there to close.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Four days later, the U.N.
Security Council ordered an international boycott of trade with
Iraq and called for restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty. The
council also denounced the Iraqi annexation of the oil-rich emirate
and demanded that Baghdad allow all foreigners to leave.
   Soviet media did not carry the text of Gorbachev's message. But
Tass said he reiterated the Soviet position that Iraq's annexation
of Kuwait was illegal and ``described the situation in the Persian
Gulf as extraordinary and extremely dangerous.''
   ``How the Security Council acts now depends fully on Iraq,''
Tass said. ``Gorbachev in his message urged the president of Iraq
to immediately take appropriate steps.''
   At the United Nations, Lozinskiy emphasized that the use of even
minimal force should be as a ``last resort,'' and said political
and diplomatic efforts to diffuse the Persian Gulf crisis should
take precedence.
   He made his comments after the council's five permanent members
_ the United States, Soviet Union, China, France and Britain _
ended more than four hours of informal meetings.
   Earlier in Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh
said all Soviet embassy personnel had been evacuated from Kuwait to
comply with an Iraqi demand to cease diplomatic activity.
   ``The staff of the Soviet Embassy came back to Moscow since the
situation in Kuwait made it impossible for them to continue their
work there,'' Gremitskikh told a news conference.
   ``From today the embassy is empty. There are no personnel. It is
shut, maybe locked. I don't know what the procedure is.''
   He said that under international law, the embassy remains open,
but vacant: ``We are not in international legal terms closing the
embassy. It remains there.''
   The United States and more than 20 other countries said they
would defy Iraq's demand to remove all embassy personnel.
   Gremitskikh said the decision to evacuate does not change
Moscow's position that the invasion and annexation of Kuwait were
illegal acts that should be reversed.
   ``We believe that the decision of Iraq to close all the
international embassies in Kuwait runs counter to international
law,'' he said. ``The Soviet Union considers Kuwait to be a
participant of the world community and has diplomatic relations
with it.''
   Asked what circumstances made it impossible for the embassy to
continue working, he said: ``The security of the people is first
and foremost.''
   Earlier in the week, Gremitskikh said the Soviets would consider
evacuating their diplomats if the Iraqis shut off food, water or
electricity supplies to the embassy. On Friday, he said they
decided to evacuate before any of those things happened.
   Gremitskikh said the government decided ``so that we would not
endanger people, we would better let them come home.''
   All 882 Soviets now have been evacuated from Kuwait and returned
to Moscow. Gremitskikh said the evacuation of the 7,791 Soviet
civilians in Iraq would begin Sunday, starting with women, children
and invalids.
   But Soviet officials said this week that Soviet military
advisers would remain in Iraq, long an ally of Moscow, because of
contractual obligations.

<HEAD>Restraining Order Denied in Bid to Block Telescope Construction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN</BYLINE>

   A judge on Friday refused to issue a
temporary restraining order environmentalists had sought to prevent
the University of Arizona from starting construction on Mount
Graham.
   U.S. District Judge William D. Browning, conducting a hearing by
telephone conference call, rejected the request of the Sierra Club
Legal Defense Fund. The fund represents a coalition of
environmental groups seeking to block the $200 million Mount Graham
International Observatory.
   The environmentalists claim that the telescope project would
encroach on the habitat of the endangered Mount Graham red squirrel.
   Browning said he had not heard ``anything that rises above
speculation'' that construction could begin before Tuesday, when
another hearing is set before U.S. District Judge Alfredo C.
Marquez, who has agreed to cut short his vacation to be present.
   On Thursday, the U.S. Forest Service said the Justice and
Agriculture departments had authorized construction of three
telescopes after determining that a 1988 law passed by Congress
precluded further biological study over the impact an observatory
would have on the squirrel.
   By Friday, the university had signed a construction contract,
obtained a special use permit from the Forest Service and planned
to get work crews onto the mountain as soon as possible, probably
by early next week.
   Work would center on transplanting small trees, finishing the
last 200 feet of a two-mile access road, clearing a one-third acre
site of large trees and preparing it for pouring concrete next year.
   Sierra Club attorney Mark Hughes said the restraining order was
needed because the university would not promise to delay
construction until the hearing Tuesday.
   The hearing concerns reopening a suit that Marquez stayed last
month, at Hughes' request, challenging the observatory. Hughes said
Marquez would be asked to enforce a provision allowing for a new
biological study.
   The Forest Service contends a new study is not neccessary.
   Jim McNulty, representing the university, told Browning that
with the federal agencies' green light, its ``position is stronger
now than ever before'' for beginning construction.
   He said continued delays could jeopardize the project, which is
to include the Columbus Telescope, which would be the world's most
powerful.
   McNulty said some work might begin before the hearing, most
likely preparing holes to transplant small trees from the one-third
acre site for the Sub-Millimeter Telescope.
   However, it was unlikely heavy equipment would arrive at the
site by Tuesday because crews must first be trained how to adhere
to work restrictions in the officially designated ``refugium,'' the
squirrel's prime habitat, he said.
   A spring census indicated that between 132 and 146 of the
genetically distinct subspecies of red squirrels remain on the
mountain in southeast Arizona.

   Valerie Salembier has resigned as president of
the New York Post after 17 months at the newspaper's helm, the
Post's owner announced Thursday.
   No replacement was announced. Post owner and publisher Peter
Kalikow said he would reassume the title of president.
   Salembier, a former publisher of TV Guide, was named to the post
in April 1989.
   Kalikow spokesman Howard Rubenstein said Kalikow had not asked
Salembier to resign. He added that she was not leaving for a
specific position elsewhere. ``They parted very amicably,'' he said,
   Salembier, who supervised business, advertising and circulation,
said in a written statement that she felt it was time ``to move
forward to new challenges and opportunities.''
   Kalikow praised her performance.
   ``She has successfully structured a business operation which has
effectively positioned the New York Post for sales and profit
growth in the 90s,'' he said in the statement.
   Kalikow in 1988 bought the newspaper, which was losing money,
from Rupert Murdoch.
   Under her tenure, the Post discontinued in November its
8-month-old Sunday edition, which failed to attract sufficient
advertisers or readers and lost millions of dollars.

   Pessimism about the economy has reached a level
unseen since 1981 and 1982, when the United States fell into the
worst recession since World War II, says a New York Times-CBS News
poll.
   Sixty percent of Americans believe the country is already in a
recession, according to the poll published Friday.
   About 55 percent of the public believe the economy is worsening,
while 40 percent said it was staying the same and 4 percent said it
was improving.
   The negative mood about the economy has been building for
months, but was deepened by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and
the resultant economic bad news: rising oil prices, falling stocks
and higher interest rates.
   A Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll in May found only 30 percent
of Americans felt there would be a recession this year. A CBS News
poll Aug. 8 found 49 percent of Americans who felt the country was
in a recession.
   Still, the new poll found virtually no change in President
Bush's approval rating on the economy. His handling of the economy
was viewed favorably by 45 percent of respondents and disapproved
of by 44 percent.
   More than a third _ 37 percent _ of respondents in the new poll
believed prices will go up a lot in the next year. Another 52
percent said they would go up at least a little, the poll said.
Seven percent said they would stay the same and the rest either
didn't know or said they would go down.
   The survey was conducted in telephone interviews with 1,422
Americans from Aug. 16 to Aug. 19. The margin of error was plus or
minus three percentage points.

   An actors' union representing
about 400 performers at Walt Disney World attractions and hotels
has agreed to a three-year contract effective Sept. 9, officials
said Thursday.
   The pact worked out by Actors' Equity and the company covers
dancers, singers, actors, stunt performers, gymnasts and comedians.
   Neither side would disclose details of the agreement, which is
to be presented to the membership in meetings Sept. 5-7, said
Richard Delahanty, business representative for the Orlando-area
office of Actors' Equity.
   Bill Ward, vice president of labor relations for Disney, said
the company was pleased with the results of the negotiations.
   Equity Executive Secretary Alan Eisenberg also expressed
satisfaction with the contract.
   ``This has been a long process, begun 16 months ago when we
initiated our organizing campaign, and we are very pleased with the
results,'' Eisenberg said in a joint statement with Ward.
   Performers at the park voted in May to be represented by the
organization.
   The pact does not cover the costumed character actors such as
those portraying Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck. They come under a
contract negotiated by the Teamsters union.

   Most U.S. reserves sent to help defend Saudi
Arabia won't be driving tanks or digging foxholes. But they will
tackle two of the most important tasks in desert warfare: getting
water and protecting against chemical attacks.
   In announcing that about 46,700 reserves will be called to
active duty over the next five weeks for Operation Desert Shield,
the Pentagon said Thursday that most of the part-time soldiers will
be posted in or near Saudi Arabia.
   The first telephone calls to reserve members could come as early
as today, officials said.
   It's unclear whether any reserve combat units, such as the
Georgia National Guard unit that comprises three brigades in the
24th Mechanized Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Ga., will be
dispatched to the forbidding Saudi desert. The two active-duty
brigades in the 24th already are on their way there.
   Many of the military's key skills are held mainly by reserve
units. Among those considered most important for Desert Shield are
water distribution and purification specialists and experts in
chemical decontamination, officials said.

   The Mideast crisis has people talking about
conservation again. But few are actually doing anything about it.
   Phone lines started ringing at energy conservation advice lines
right after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, as consumers fearing
higher prices sought tips to cut their consumption.
   In Minneapolis, the Metropolitan Transit Commission used Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's picture and the slogan ``Stop pumping
him up,'' in an advertising campaign to suggest that people use
city buses rather than their cars.
   So far, however, little suggests people are driving less,
investing in more efficient home heating or following the Bush
administration's cautious suggestions for gasoline savings.

   The financially suffering Postal Service is
asking its four unions to keep down wage demands when contract
talks open today, but union leaders say their members shouldn't pay
for management mistakes.
   ``We don't want the public to be gouged, but we're not going to
take the blame for poor management either,'' said Moe Biller,
president of the American Postal Workers Union.
   Biller's accusations center on the service's push towards
automation, which he said has wasted money without improving
efficiency. He says automation also costs thousands of jobs.
   Postal Service spokesman Lou Eberhardt called charges of
mismanagement ``pre-bargaining rhetoric.''
   Automation joins wages as a key issue in efforts to agree on new
three-year contracts before the current pacts expire at midnight
Nov. 20. The four unions represent 660,000 workers.

   Stock prices may be collapsing on fears of war
and energy shortages, but the focus in some quarters remains on the
long run.
   In interviews, three big investors with very different
approaches and clientele shared a belief that investing must center
on fundamentals. All saw opportunities developing.
   Thomas O'Hara, chairman of the National Association of Investors
Corp., said he and his staff were reviewing a list of buying
opportunities. Even if prices continue to fall, some stocks already
are buys, he said.
   The NAIC, which runs a mutual fund and provides advice to the
nation's largest aggregation of investment clubs, tends to invest
no matter what short-term conditions might be.
   The credo of its clubs, for example, is to invest small amounts
on a regular monthly basis in basically sound, well-managed
companies. Down markets are viewed as opportunities to obtain more
shares for the money.
   Using that philosophy, the NAIC's oldest member, the Mutual
Investment Club of Detroit, has averaged better than 12 percent a
year for 50 years, which means it has doubled its portfolio value
on average every six years.
   ``The difficult task in a market like this is to convince people
there are opportunities, but the opportunities are great,'' O'Hara
said.
   Andrew Lanyi, managing director of the Lanyi Division of
Ladenburg, Thalman &amp; Co., is also a fundamental investor, but the
stocks he chooses may not make the NAIC lists. Lanyi seeks small,
highly profitable, undiscovered companies. His better selections
often appreciate three or four times _ even much more.
   To find such companies requires an enormous amount of effort,
such as screening 30,000 companies to uncover eight possibilities.
All will have the potential to grow into blue chips and be
``discovered'' by Wall Street.
   Shortly after the recent decline began, several of Lanyi's
selections were off sharply. Asked what effect the declines were
having on him, Lanyi said, ``I have become more aggressive.''
   Lanyi said those who know company fundamentals _ products,
sales-earnings potential, management _ can take the upsets. It
takes discipline and patience. Master those, he suggested, and you
can keep eyeing the opportunity.
   John Wright, chairman of Wright Investors Service in Bridgeport,
Conn., manages billions of dollars of blue-chip investment
portfolios for institutions and clients, and advises many other
clients around the world.
   The Wright company foresaw the sharp decline and presented
clients with extensive written analyses long before it occurred. As
he views the sell-off, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was merely the
trigger.
   ``I have thought this one would go down at least to 2,700''
points on the Dow Jones industrial average, he said. ``Then, after
a rally, I thought it would decline to 2,100 points.''
   ``We haven't had the rally because of the invasion,'' Wright
said. While he sees a chance that the Dow's low will be between
2,400 and 2,500 points, his stronger expectation is that it will
reach 2,100 or 2,200 some time in 1991.
   Stressing fundamental analysis, Wright's firm has averaged 12.2
percent a year from 1961 to 1990. In anticipation of a decline, he
had reduced his equity portfolios sharply in recent months. At the
moment, his portfolios are 50 percent stocks.
   Already, Wright says, some long-term bargains are appearing, but
he tempers that with a rather ominous caveat, that if the Federal
Reserve doesn't allow interest rates to drop, the country may fall
into recession.
   He doesn't think it will happen. When the Middle East calms
down, he believes the country will have lower interest rates and a
much better-run government. A lot of changes must and will be made,
Wright said.
   ``The United States once again will be the world economic
leader,'' he said.

   The continuing flow of refugees from
Indochina has been joined by the ``yacht people,'' Cambodians with
a little money who probably are sailing into a legal limbo.
   Indonesian officials describe them as a ``new phenomenon'' and
say many of the Cambodians, unlike the far more numerous
Vietnamese, are unlikely to be resettled anywhere except back where
they came from.
   Aid workers applied the not-to-accurate label after seeing
Cambodians who were relatively well dressed come ashore from
larger, better-equipped vessels than those of the Vietnamese ``boat
people.''
   Some had passports and money, and wanted only fuel and supplies
for the journey to Australia.
   ``They didn't ask for asylum,'' said Ali Alatas, the Indonesian
foreign minister. ``They had money to buy food and wanted to be on
their way. . . . Were we supposed to say no, please stay?''
   Alatas was referring to Australian allegations that, by enabling
Cambodians to continue their journeys, Indonesia might be
encouraging others to make the trip.
   Well over 200 Cambodians have reached northwestern Australia
since November by sailing more than 2,500 miles through the vast
Indonesian archipelago. Prime Minister Bob Hawke says the
Cambodians, in general, left their homeland for economic rather
than political reasons and do not qualify as refugees.
   Australia has made clear it does not want to become a ``first
asylum'' country _ the first in which boat people arrive.
   Until now, that role has been played by Hong Kong and member
nations of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations: Indonesia,
Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore and Brunei.
Australia wants to continue choosing people for resettlement from
those screened as refugees in the existing camps.
   Most Australians seem to feel they should be compassionate
toward genuine refugees, but there has been a backlash recently
against Asian migrants.
   More than 1,750 Cambodians have landed in Indonesia, most of
them since February, and are held with other refugees on Galang
Island, just south of Singapore. The majority are young men who
tell reporters they fled to avoid being drafted to fight Phnom
Penh's war with rebels.
   An exodus of Cambodians by boat began after Vietnam withdrew
most of its occupation force in September 1989. That left the
government in Phnom Penh, which Vietnam installed after invading
the country more than 11 years ago, responsible for fighting the
resistance.
   Another 300,000 Cambodians, who were uprooted by the Vietnamese
invasion, languish in camps just across the border with Thailand.
   This is a bad time for boat people, beyond the normal perils of
pirates and storms. Attitudes are hardening and they face
increasing prospects of being pushed out to sea or sent back to the
land they risked their lives escaping.
   Malaysia has turned away 8,700 Indochinese boat people since May
1989, according to diplomatic sources in Kuala Lumpur. Many of
those moved on to Galang Island, which the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees built for 5,000 people and now holds more than 17,000.
   Indonesia regards the Cambodians as displaced persons, neither
refugees nor asylum seekers. Pending a decision on their status,
they are being sheltered on humanitarian grounds, said Lt. Col.
Doekseno, who is in charge of Galang.
   As a new refugee group, they are not covered by the
Comprehensive Plan of Action drawn up in Geneva under U.N. auspices
in June 1989.
   The plan's purpose was to screen and divide Vietnamese boat
people into economic migrants and political refugees. Those with
justifiable fear of political persecution are entitled to
resettlement and economic migrants are returned home.
   Alatas said Cambodian boat people should be added to the U.N.
plan. Other Asian diplomats are less certain, fearing many of the
300,000 refugees along the Thai-Cambodian border might try to set
sail in hope of a new life.
   Whether Cambodians are included may not matter, since the U.N.
plan appears in danger of collapse. At the annual ASEAN meeting in
July, the six members accused the United States and Vietnam of
making the refugee problem worse by refusing to approve the return
of economic migrants.
   About 80 percent of the estimated 130,000 people currently in
camps in the region are non-political refugees, ASEAN officials
said.
   Since Washington and Hanoi agreed to the U.N. plan originally,
but later did not comply with the provision on economic migrants,
ASEAN members have reserved the right to turn boat people away.

<HEAD>A Look at American Pop Culture: `Edge' Goes Right Up To It</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Feeling a little alienated?
   Ever find yourself late at night wondering Just What Has Gone
Wrong With the Republic? Is the social contract up for renewal in
your neighborhood?
   And if Andrew Dice Clay did not exist, would it be necessary to
invent him?
   For the answer to the last question and more, tune in tonight to
PBS and ``Edge,'' a funny, adult and extremely well-written look at
American pop culture. It will show you things you otherwise
probably would never see.
   Vanity Fair writer James Wolcott tries to understand why people
laugh at the abusive humor of the '90s in the persona of Andrew
Dice Clay.
   Significantly, the segment is titled ``Another Day in Hell.''
   This is definitely for adults only. Not only does ``Edge''
liberally excerpt Clay's raunchy, unexpurgated concert routine, but
it discusses his appeal in terms of ``class hatred'' and
``marginalized'' white, working-class males.
   ``What's impressive about Clay is the emancipatory and
truth-telling impulse in him.'' says Frederic Smoler, a professor
of intellectual history at Sarah Lawrence College.
   ``The grimmest and saddest and thing about Clay is when he
strips away a thing, debunks it, what's left to his audiences' view
and his own is pretty small and ugly.''
   The least accessible segment is about the faceless photographs
of New York City conceptual artist Lorna Simpson. It's followed by
a nice ballad (inexplicably sung on a bare city rooftop) by
singer-songwriter John Hiatt.
   The great humorist Buck Henry comes on next with a visit to the
Nixon Library in Yorba Linda, Calif. In opening his essay on the
fall and rise of the elder statesman, Henry notes that Yorba Linda
means ``beautiful yorba.''
   There is commentary by Professor Stanley Cutler, author of ``The
Wars of Watergate,'' who notes that the Nixon Library makes no
mention of Nixon's accepting a pardon for any Watergate crimes he
may have committed.
   ``Someday he'll be left alone to history,'' Cutler notes. He is
smiling.
   Henry notes Tom Brokaw's visit to Yorba Linda, to anchor the
evening news from the museum. And the Nixon birthplace, a kit-built
house that cost $800 from the factory and $400,000 to restore.
   There's such a nice, suppressed note of hysteria and loathing to
the piece. Far too soon, Henry bids a fond farewell to the Nixon
complex. He waves goodbye and drives away renewed, refreshed.
   The host of the series, Emmy Award winner Robert Krulwich,
reviews the recent history of student works at the Art Institute of
Chicago.
   Remember when one student painted Mayor Harold Washington in
brassiere, underpants, garter belt and stockings? The painting got
arrested.
   One year later, student ``Dread'' Scott Tyler's wretched ``How
to Display the Flag'' ignited the furor of veterans and flag-wavers
by displaying a flag on the floor that tacitly invited spectators
to walk on it.
   The beleaguered head of the institute school, Tony Jones, notes
that people who tired of abstract art and called for the return to
figurative art have gotten their wish _ with a vengeance.
   Then the show shows us four performance artists whose
applications for federal grants were rejected. It's a delightful
irony.
   And, with a wonderfully wry finale, the excellent comedian,
actor, writer and ``Simpsons'' voice Harry Shearer explains to us
just WHY anchormen are girdling the globe to cover the story.
Shearer is magnificently low-key.
   Make time to see this pilot episode, a joint production of New
York City's WNET and Britain's BBC-2. ``If successful, the pilot
will be followed by 10 one-hour programs,'' says WNET.
   Do yourself a favor and tune in.

<HEAD>Bear Sightings on Wall Street</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The steep decline in stock prices this summer
has left investors staring into the jaws of what some say may be
Wall Street's first sustained bear market in nearly a decade.
   Today's generation of stock traders and analysts is by no means
unaccustomed to to the phenomenon of falling markets. Most of them
were around for the Crash of 1987, which provided all the
conditions you could want for a baptism of fire.
   That debacle produced a 36 percent drop in the Dow Jones
industrial average, enough to rank prominently on any list of
modern-day market declines.
   But almost all the carnage occurred in a span of less than two
months, and stocks began to recover quickly thereafter en route to
new highs.
   Many an investor, it appeared, was still numb from the shock
when the wounds began to heal.
   For an undisputed example of the kind of long, debilitating
slide for which classic bear markets are famous, one has to go back
to 1981-82, before the big boom of the '80s on Wall Street was
ready to start.
   From April 27, 1981 to Aug. 12, 1982, the Dow Jones industrials
tumbled from 1,024.05 to 776.92 as the economy struggled through a
recession exacerbated by rapid inflation and high interest rates.
   Instead of the sudden jolt of a crash, the market in those days
experienced a kind of slow, steady erosion that gave investors
plenty of time to think about how much money they were losing and
how bleak the outlook seemed.
   The question of the moment now, of course, is whether stocks are
in for a similar malaise, or just undergoing one of the periodic
``corrections'' that have punctuated the long bull market since '82.
   Simple to ask, not so easy to answer. Incipient bear markets are
notoriously cunning at disguising themselves as short-term
corrections, and vice versa.
   On the optimistic side, however, analysts point out that
authentic bear markets have seldom begun with a single event that
serves as an ``explanation'' for the decline _ in this case, Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Indeed, many veteran market-watchers worry more when declines
set in that have no readily discernible cause.
   ``Past major confrontations such as the Cuban missile crisis or
other military squabbles that were resolved favorably proved to be
just a blip in the stock market's general trend,'' observes Greg
Smith, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   ``We could be in one of those blips, or this could be something
much more significant.''
   Norman Fosback, editor of a group of investment advisory letters
published by the Institute for Econometric Research in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., plants himself squarely on the ``blip'' side of
the argument.
   ``Price weakness touched off by the geopolitical crisis does NOT
constitute a bear market,'' he declared in the firm's Mutual Fund
Forecaster. ``It does appear to be the 10 percent to 15 percent
correction that has been long overdue.
   ``Midstream bull market corrections are nearly always abrupt.
They shake out the market's weak participants by leading them to
believe, falsely, that a bear market has begun.''
   One big risk behind this view is the chance that the market has
looked beyond the Persian Gulf showdown and correctly discerned the
approach of a recession.
   It will take a good while for these overlays of uncertainty to
sort themselves out, observed Morton Silverman, portfolio
strategist at Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood in Minneapolis.
   Silverman concluded, ``it's a time for prudence, not
opportunism.''

<HEAD>Trying To Find Extra Cells Risks Lives and Wastes Money</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From coast to coast, the federal government is
out of jail cells.
   Space is so short that the 52 deputy U.S. marshals in west Texas
last year drove nearly 1 million miles moving prisoners _ sometimes
driving all night from remote jails.
   It is so short that 25-30 women awaiting trial for federal
crimes in New York City are held 550 miles away in Alderson, W.Va.
   And public defenders in Seattle daily drive 30 to 90 miles to
see clients, sometimes taking all day to visit a jail on a Puget
Sound island.
   ``There's a national jail crisis,'' said Howard Safir,
operations chief of the U.S. Marshals Service for the past 12
years. ``There's just no room at the inn.''
   Every day, armed deputy marshals ferry their hazardous cargo
through America's towns and countrysides. The routes change often _
to prevent escapes and because yesterday's vacant jail is now full.
   Those involved say all this driving risks lives, wastes money
and conflicts with the defendant's right to a fair trial.
   If someone attacks one of the marshals' caged vans to break out
a prisoner, ``we've got a shotgun,'' said Chief Deputy Bob
Christman of Seattle. ``So if it goes down, there's going to be
somebody dead.''
   Moving prisoners between jails and courts costs the Marshals
Service $27.5 million a year. Assistant Director Joseph Enders said
a major portion of that could be saved _ as much as 70 percent in
some districts _ if there were enough cells close to courthouses.
   Using far-flung jails ``causes serious problems in communicating
with our clients, tremendous expense and inefficiency,'' said
Richard Richman, a federal public defender in Boston.
   Some federal officials say this crunch could have been avoided.
They see it as the predictable outcome of a decade of law and order
legislation and spending that added more than 4,500 lawmen and
prosecutors but gave short shrift to jails, a less glamorous but
crucial component of criminal justice.
   As a result:
   _ Marshals in Boston hold most of their prisoners in Connecticut
and want to rent a condominium in Danbury to save hotel expenses
for deputies. Defendants in Rhode Island, New Jersey, New Mexico
and Oregon also are held in other states.
   _ Prisoners awaiting trial in Kansas, Washington and west Texas
are scattered in as many as 10 jails in each state. Marshals in
Miami use 11 south Florida jails.
   _ In Oregon, marshals spend more than half their time hauling
prisoners. Marshals everywhere complain that the driving drains
manpower from their other duties: hunting federal fugitives,
serving court orders, guarding courthouses and protecting
threatened witnesses and judges.
   At the federal level, jails hold people awaiting trial; convicts
go to prison. For years the federal government did not have its own
jails because most federal defendants got out on bail before trial.
   Now, it has 14 jails and only four _ Chicago, New York, Los
Angeles and San Diego, fit the ideal: a downtown site connected to
or near a federal courthouse. The rest are detention wings carved
out of prisons, nearly all in rural areas.
   Most federal cells still are leased in state, county or city
jails.
   When President Ronald Reagan took office 1981, he was determined
to use federal power to curb street violence with new agents and
new laws. There were 477 vacant beds in federal jails then.
   In 10 years, Republican administrations added 1,770 prosecutors,
1,015 drug agents and 1,740 FBI agents, but fewer than one jail bed
for each new prosecutor.
   The agents arrested far more defendants than that, and the new
laws assured that many more people would be jailed before trial.
   And the inmates became more dangerous because the 1984 Bail
Reform Act and the 1988 drug control law required preventive
detention for those charged with violent or drug crimes.
   During the decade, the average daily number of federal jail
inmates exploded from 3,618 to 13,916. But the federal government
itself only added 1,669 jail beds.
   And on top of that, 607 local jails threw their federal boarders
out.
   The local jails had grown even more overcrowded than federal
jails as states mimicked the federal get-tough policies. They got
so packed that state and federal judges limited the crowding.
   Now more than one in four large urban jails is under court order
to reduce its population.
   And the Bureau of Prisons has 5,984 inmates in federal jails
built for 3,272.
   So the marshals reach farther into the countryside to find
vacant cells.
   ``The farther you take a prisoner, the more potential there is
for an escape or a traffic accident,'' Safir said in an interview
before his recent retirement. He thinks the marshals are fortunate
that no one has escaped in transit during the last four years and
accidents have been fender-benders.
   ``Every time you move a guy in custody, it's a security risk to
deputies, to communities we drive through, to all the drivers on
the freeways,'' said Christman in Seattle.

<TEXT>
   ``The ordinary person, even the ordinary
politician, has a difficult time distinguishing a prison from a
jail.''
   It's a difference Howard Safir had to explain over and over for
the last 12 years. As operations director of the U.S. Marshals
Service, Safir was responsible for finding jail cells _ not prison
cells _ for federal inmates.
   Safir, who recently retired, got them from the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons or leased them from other governments.
   The U.S. Justice Department uses jails differently from the
states, counties and cities.
   Federal jail cells house only individuals who have been denied
bail while they await trial or for those convicted but awaiting
sentencing.
   State and local jails do that, too. But they also hold
individuals serving short misdemeanor sentences. The federal
government sends such convicts to low-security prisons and prison
camps.
   Many states now also keep some more serious offenders in jails,
because their prisons are overcrowded.
   Marshals, lawyers and judges agree that the most efficient jails
are connected by secure tunnel or bridge to the courthouse where
the inmates are tried.
   ``A prison in a cornfield works fine. A jail doesn't,'' Safir
said. ``Because jail inmates have to go to court each day. They
need access to their lawyers. They are almost all still not-guilty
prisoners under our system. They have more rights than convicts.''

<HEAD>East German Educators Go Back to School</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wolfgang Jung had spent his first two years
in college absorbing communist economics when, abruptly, the world
changed. So did his homework.
   Jung is spending his last two years of college cramming for
capitalism at East Berlin's College of Economics, where even the
teachers are taking a crash course in free-market thinking.
   The college is part of a vast educational system that is both
trying to reshape itself quickly and continuing to train young
people for jobs that may not exist on graduation day.
   Nearly 2.1 million East Germans from elementary to graduate
level are beginning a new school year that will be much different
from the previous 42.
   Millions of new textbooks free of communist ideology have
flooded in from West Germany. Bloated departments devoted to
Marxist-Leninist theory have been dissolved.
   Hundreds of Russian-language teachers spent the summer learning
to teach English. More than one-third of the nation's 1 million
teachers are enrolled in retraining programs.
   On the secluded campus where the Communist secret police once
learned their fearsome skills, music, science and languages are
taught to an ordinary student body.
   Still, experts say, the changes are almost superficial.
   Most of the old teachers, former guardians of ideology and
components of a vast domestic intelligence network, will be back in
their classrooms.
   All principals, rectors and chancellors were fired, but the
communities entrusted with refilling those jobs returned more than
half to their former positions.
   What has happened to East Germany's schools in the year since
communism fell is only the beginning of a process that may need a
generation to complete, the experts say.
   For Jung and others in the Class of '92, that is too long.
   ``I didn't know what a corporation was when we began learning a
market economy,'' said Jung, 24, sitting in the school cafeteria
bent over a West German textbook.
   ``It was socialism, socialism, socialism. Now we have to go back
to the beginning.''
   The democratic government elected in March has only begun
decentralizing the system, reteaching the teachers and eliminating
the rigidity of lesson plans, said Hans-Joachim Meyer, the
education minister.
   Meyer believes the five state governments that will be created
Oct. 14, to fit in with the West German system, will have a more
formidable task when they assume full responsibility for the
schools.
   He said the hardest job will be to change the way people think,
to instill individuality and imagination in a system dulled by
decades of restrictive, paranoid Stalinism.
   ``We need probably four to five years to introduce the necessary
structures,'' he said. ``But in order to develop new attitudes
toward life, toward society: yes, that will take a generation.''
   Meshing the East German education system with West Germany's is
another problem. East German students, for example, need 12 years
of schooling to qualify for a university, while West Germans must
have 13.
   ``It is a major problem to get East Germany to fit into the
whole context,'' said Monika Renz, a researcher for the Standing
Conference of Education Ministers of the 11 West German states.
   The group is debating how to merge the systems, and ``not all
the states are convinced'' East German schools are up to par, she
said.
   All have agreed, some grudgingly, to allow East Germans equal
access to West German universities, with admission quotas based on
percentages of East German applicants.
   East German educators bristle at criticism of their schools and
what they feel is condescension by West Germans.
   ``They give us their textbooks, their lectures, their
seminars,'' said Heidi Klemm, who teaches English. ``They say,
`It's all rubbish, your schools'.''
   She pointed out that the exodus to West Germany last year, which
helped bring down the Communist government in East Germany, was
largely of people judged to be highly skilled.
   Ms. Klemm spoke while strolling across her college campus
outside the small farm community of Golm, 25 miles south of Berlin
and just outside Potsdam.
   Ivy covers many buildings and barbed wire rings the periphery.
The college was the officers' training school of the former Stasi
secret police, where only the brightest in the feared organization
could gain admittance.
   Stasi students and faculty were expelled late last year and the
school was converted into an extension of a teacher's college in
Potsdam.
   The Potsdam school occupies beautiful colonnaded buildings in a
complex of 19th century palaces and gardens built for Frederick the
Great, the Prussian king. In them, nearly 3,000 students study
languages, medicine, art and geography.
   It is the largest teachers' college in East Germany, and has a
severe case of nerves.
   All administrators of all schools were dismissed in June.
Committees of local officials, students, parents and teachers have
been meeting to recommend who should be retained.
   The Potsdam school's committee began work Sept. 1.
   ``If you come here in January, maybe someone else will be
sitting here,'' Knut Kiesant, the vice chancellor, said in his
spacious office.
   Kiesant has been with the school for six years and Wolfgang
Strauss, director of international relations, for 25. Both say
people who rose to high levels in the old regime are being
persecuted.
   ``Whether I am good or I am bad is not a question of black or
white, as a child would decide,'' Strauss said.
   Both men said they favor the new politics in East Germany.
   Most school committees have completed their work and more than
half, perhaps 65 percent, rehired their old administrators, said
Meyer, the education minister.
   He attributed that to a lack of qualified alternative
candidates, apathy in local committees and deference to the old
headmasters.
   Meyer predicted more administrators would be replaced when the
new state governments took over, but recommended against wholesale
dismissals of teachers.
   Teachers are such a large group, he said, that they deserve a
chance to change with the changing society.
   Many may be weeded out by economic collapse. Unpaid bills are
mounting at the Potsdam school and it has a 5-1 ratio of students
to teachers, compared with 30-1 in West Germany, Strauss said.
   Economic problems are increasing across the country, presaging
hard times for students nearing graduation.
   Agriculture students have learned techniques applicable only to
the dying collective farms. Thousands of trade school students are
apprenticed to factories expected to close.
   No school has had to shift gears more quickly than the
4,500-student College of Economics.
   About 60 of the 200 professors have been replaced with Western
experts, said Hans-Peter Krueger, the new vice chancellor.
   Krueger said the school added crash programs so students and
teachers could catch up with capitalism.
   ``We not only have to learn how to teach a market economy, we
have to teach how to live in a market economy,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: in Seattle.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, Marshal Bill Jonas of San Antonio heard of a plot to
attack a marshals' van and free two prisoners, so he flew them 180
miles. Nine months earlier, he changed routes to elude ``someone
(who) tried to set up a roadblock'' on the 108-mile route from San
Antonio to Bastrop.
   Another risk is boredom.
   ``We had a fellow resign the other day,'' said Kernan Bagley,
marshal in Portland, Ore. ``He told me, `I'm not going to spend my
life transporting prisoners.''' Bagley said that task consumes 55
to 60 percent of his deputies' time, twice what it would if jails
were nearby.
   ``It burns my people out,'' said Seattle's Christman. To bring
prisoners from Tacoma, ``my people have to get up at 4:15 a.m.,
drive two rush hours and work a full day. They get home at 8 p.m.
   ``It's not good for the prisoners either. It's not good for the
attorneys who can't get to their clients as easily as they should.
These people are still innocent and have a right to see
attorneys,'' Christman said.
   ``If we're lucky,'' said Richman, the Boston public defender,
``the closest we get our clients is an hour's drive away.''
   Judges regularly postpone trials and order marshals to drive
prisoners hundreds of miles to get an hour a week with their
attorney, Richman said.
   The eight federal public defenders in Seattle, each handling up
to 30 cases, spend up to one-fifth of their time driving to see
clients, according to Public Defender Tom Hillier.
   Private defense lawyers like Barry Wilson in Boston have to
charge their clients for time spent driving to see them. ``Why
should a person have to pay more money to his lawyer because he
can't make bail?'' Wilson asked.
   ``All this was predictable when you added those agents and
laws,'' Safir said. ``We've been waving this (red) flag for five
years.''
   Stan Morris, Marshals Service director until last fall, said he
could not get Attorneys General Edwin Meese and Dick Thornburgh to
pay attention to jails _ not even by sending Thornburgh a weekly
memo on a problem in his hometown, Pittsburgh.
   Bureau of Prisons Director J. Michael Quinlan granted that
``growth has been a little greater than we anticipated,'' but said
``I don't believe we should have asked for more'' money for jails.
   ``It's important not to overbuild,'' Quinlan said.
   At Justice, Associate Deputy Attorney General Margaret Love
conceded the shortage ``became acute in 1986.'' She said Thornburgh
set up a jails task force _ in March of this year.
   Safir said Justice finally ``is beginning to focus on the
problem'' and cited three promising moves:
   _ Using new legislation, marshals for the first time have hired
a private company to build and operate a federal jail, in Kansas,
and plan another in New England.
   _ The Bureau of Prisons plans to build 4,772 jail cells by
mid-1993. If President Bush's budget is approved, another 1,250
would be added. But the marshals expect to have 16,000 additional
daily inmates by 1995.
   _ This spring, Justice got Congress to switch $20 million from
prison construction to a program that pays local governments to
build jails in return for 15-year federal leases on some beds. The
program will have $35 million this year. Safir said local
governments already have applied for $129 million.
   The marshals think even more will be needed.
   Marshal Bagley in Oregon asked that jail space be added to
federal buildings under construction, but was turned down. Marshal
Jonas in west Texas thinks downtown federal jails will be needed in
21 big cities; only 10 are planned.
   Some defense lawyers, members of Congress and prison officials
think the government cannot build its way out of the problem. They
think far more defendants are jailed than ever committed crimes or
fled while on bail.
   But they are not expecting a quick change. As Public Defender
Hillier said, ``I'm an advocate of changing some of these mindless
laws and throwing fewer people in jail, but that's probably not
realistic in this dark age.''

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis: Americans Wrestle With Mixed Emotions and Daily Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE DREYFOUS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Saddam Hussein's troops marched into Kuwait on Aug. 2, and
suddenly summer stalled. Overnight, America entered a conflict
defined by diplomats and kings, economics and complicated moral
stands.
   It is an unhappy new world, and Americans are still trying to
sort it out. Many are able to reduce the Persian Gulf crisis to
red, white and blue. But others are wrestling with shades of gray.
   ``Some people react with anger. Some people react with a feeling
of needing to share love. The feelings are massive and different,''
said Betty Walters, whose son and grandson are with the Army in
Saudi Arabia.
   ``The one feeling everyone seems to share is fear: fear of the
unknown.''
   America has been wrenched, thrown from the euphoric fall of
communism into the sudden threat of a desert war. Patriotism
confronts history, pride meets pragmatism. Feelings are all in a
jumble. Passions explode and recede.
   ``The world is very big, remote and complicated,'' said
sociologist Todd Gitlin of the University of California at
Berkeley. ``It gets simplified on an occasion like this.''
   In Cleveland, a radio station stages a ``Saddam Hussein Firing
Squad.'' Pelt a stand-in for the Iraqi leader with overripe
tomatoes and vent your anger. It's a dollar a chance and the
proceeds go to Myrtle Beach Air Force Base.
   Outside Cleveland City Hall, a woman is arrested after about 30
protesters burn a flag to protest America's stand in the Middle
East. In Lincoln, Neb., Vietnam War veterans burn Iraq's flag in
solidarity with U.S. troops overseas.
   A convoy of soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division at Fort
Campbell, Ky., slips by flag-waving supporters along Interstate 75
through Tennessee and Georgia. They head for Mayport, Fla., and
deployment in the Persian Gulf.
   ``We want them to know we care,'' said Don Gage, who unfurled a
50-foot flag at one overpass. ``And I'll tell you this: We can't
wait to put it on the northbound side to welcome them back.''
   At a Pittsburgh synagogue, worshipers donate 300 prayer books
for Jewish soldiers they suspect will still be in Saudi Arabia
during the High Holy Days of Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashana next month.
   In Valdosta, Ga., some minds are otherwise occupied. ``Iraq may
have invaded Kuwait, but all that really matters in the world is
that Georgia high school football is less than three weeks away.
Take that, Saddam Hussein,'' challenges a local newsletter.
   Country music star Hank Williams Jr. writes a song suggesting
that Arabs ``take their poison gas and stick it in their
sassafras.'' Similar ditties blare on local radio stations
broadcast at the beach, the lake, at the mall.
   Workmen building a 30-story pyramid arena in Memphis attach a
300-foot-long yellow ribbon for the 3,000 Americans held in Iraq
and Kuwait.
   But the wife of a Texas oil worker captured by Iraqi troops
receives an anonymous call from the angry mom of a soldier: ``(She)
asked why our government should go and protect someone who's just
earning a living for their family ... (She) thinks it's my fault
that her son's going.''
   Two decorated Vietnam War veterans take sides. Retired Army
Staff Sgt. Buck Buchanan, who holds three Purple Hearts, says
history shows ``if you're going to cock the gun, you better pull
the trigger.''
   But retired Army Col. James Burkholder decides to return his
Legion of Merit awardto protest the government's ``all or nothing''
military stance.
   Some say oil is good enough reason to go to war. They post signs
that say, ``Get the gas and kick their ass.''
   Others say no: ``We've been taught to hate Arabs and love our
pocketbooks,'' Ramsey Clark, U.S. attorney general during the
Vietnam War, said at a news conference last week.
   But everywhere, there is anxiety and confusion. Two 10-year-old
girls, their fathers dispatched to Saudi Arabia, wrote a song:
   ``What's going on over the seas?
   ``It's been a disaster, but it's not up to me.
   ``We hate to see the people cry.''
   Many, like Betty Walters, look to each other for comfort.
   The Osseo, Minn., housewife has received calls from around the
nation since she organized ``Support Our Country's Military'' soon
after the U.S. military entered the Middle East conflict and her
boys were sent to Saudi Arabia.
   ``Whether we are supporting this or not, everyone is feeling
this pressure of waiting,'' she said Friday. ``It tears families
apart.''
   It tears parents apart. ``It's breaking my heart and I believe
the hearts of a lot of parents across the country,'' said Alex
Molnar, a University of Wisconsin professor whose son's Marine unit
was also sent to Saudi Arabia.
   Molnar and his wife cried when they heard. They cut short their
vacation and went to see their 21-year-old before he shipped out of
North Carolina.
   ``The first thing my son said to me was: `Dad, we're going to
war with these guys,''' Molnar said Friday. ``As a parent I can
tell you that (George Bush) has his hands around my heart. (He) is
telling me my child might be killed for a purpose that he describes
as important.''
   The Rev. Edwin Davis of Koran, La., knows the confusion. He has
waited more than three weeks for word from his daughter, son-in-law
and grandson. The family, he believes, is laying low in Kuwait. But
how long can they hide? ``There's a lot of anxiety mixed up in
this,'' the retired minister said. ``You can't cowtow to Iraq's
demands ... (but) there's a lot of people involved: soldier boys,
our government, other people's loved ones and our own.
   ``It's a dilemma ... you can't hardly understand.''

   U.S. stock prices fell to the lowest level in more than a year
and the cost of oil approached record highs as mounting tensions in
the 3-week-old Persian Gulf crisis shook world financial markets.
   Trading activity in securities, oil and foreign currencies was
nervous and heavy around the world Thursday, driven by fears of war
between Iraq and an international force led by the United States.
   ``God only knows what could happen,'' said Robert Brusca, chief
economist for Nikko Securities International Inc. in New York. ``At
this point nobody wants to take any risk.''

   The nation's top antitrust prosecutor has
summoned major oil companies to talk to him as he determines
whether they used illegal tactics to drive up gasoline prices
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``I have called the major oil companies and requested that they
come in on a one-by-one basis to meet with the staff and on several
occasions with me,'' Assistant Attorney General James Rill said
Thursday. Oil companies have denied charges of price-gouging.

   The Middle East crisis, highlighting America's
reliance on foreign oil, is spurring renewed calls for energy
conservation, including demands that automakers build more
fuel-efficient cars.
   A group of environmentalists and alternative fuel advocates on

programs aimed at cutting energy use and for opposing legislation
that would toughen automobile fuel efficiency requirements.

   Even while urging Americans to conserve energy,
the vacationing President Bush has been guzzling fuel by land, by
sea and by air.
   His most conspicuous fuel consumption has come at the helm of
his twin-engine Cigarette speedboat, Fidelity. But the boat is just
one of the entries on his vacation fuel bill.
   He burns thousands of gallons of fuel while jetting back and
forth between Washington and his vacation home in Kennebunkport,
Maine.
   More fuel is burned by Marine One, the Sikorsky H-3 helicopter
that takes Bush from Air Force One at Pease Air Force Base in New
Hampshire to the helipad in his yard in Maine.
   Another visible energy drain are the golf carts he and his
partners use on the president's high-speed runs around the golf
course.
   Public images of Bush in motion are a sharp contrast from the
1970s television shots of President Carter, who donned a sweater as
the government urged less energy consumption during a previous
energy crisis.
   Asked about the differing images, White House spokesman Steve
Hart said, ``It'd be kind of inappropriate to go on TV in front of
a fire now.''
   Jets, helicopters and limousines are ``part of the presidency,''
Hart maintained.
   ``I think most Americans would support his need to do that in
order to do his job,'' he said.
   Soon, Bush will burn even more jet fuel when he takes to the
skies in a new, jumbo Air Force One with a bigger gas tank,
according to spokesmen at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, where
the planes are kept.
   The Boeing 707s that now serve as Air Force One are to be
replaced by a new Boeing 747, which was delivered to the Air Force
Thursday.
   Andrews spokesman Sgt. Jim Guthrie estimated the old Air Force
One burns 15,000 pounds per hour and the new one 22,000 pounds an
hour. Another base official, Master Sgt. Rick Fuller, said seven
pounds of jet fuel equals 1 gallon.
   This means Bush's old plane burned $1,350 worth of fuel an hour
_ about the flying time to Kennebunkport from the White House _
based on the average price of about 63 cents a gallon prior to the
Mideast crisis. Based on the more recent price of $1.08 a gallon,
the bill would be $2,314.29 an hour. The new plane will burn
$3,394.27 worth of fuel an hour at current prices _ 46.6 percent
more.
   Guthrie said the older presidential jets can hold 23,800 gallons
in their tanks, while the new 747 will have a capacity of 53,862
gallons. Neither official knew how much fuel Air Force One uses in
a year.
   ``That would vary from year to year. That would vary from
president to president,'' Fuller said.
   Former President Reagan's trips to his ranch in California, for
example, used up more fuel per trip than Bush's flights to
Kennebunkport. But Bush has been a more frequent flier.
   ``President Reagan didn't fly quite as much as President Bush,
so it might average out in the long run,'' Fuller said.
   Bush publicly defended his boat excursions in response to
reporters' questions Wednesday.
   ``I'm going to keep using my boat, and I hope the rest of
America will prudently recreate,'' Bush said at a Kennebunkport
news conference.
   Spokesman Hart was unsure how much fuel is used by the
president's speedboat. Workers at Southern Maine Marina, where the
boat is docked, declined comment.
   A man at a nearby Kennebunkport marina said the twin-screw
Fidelity is not among the worst gas guzzlers on the high seas, but
neither is it particularly fuel-efficient.
   ``He uses big carburetors on it,'' said John Daley, of Chick's
Marina Inc., where gasoline cost $1.60 a gallon Thursday.

   Banking lawyers are dusting off the statute
books to examine a 50-year-old law slashing the interest rate some
active-duty servicemen pay on a wide range of loans to 6 percent.
   Bankers said Thursday they have no idea how many people pressed
into service by the Persian Gulf crisis might seek breaks on their
student loans, credit cards and home mortgages under a section of
the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940.
   The potential beneficiaries include the roughly 50,000
reservists being called up. The law has always covered military
personnel but is rarely invoked because few volunteers and career
servicepeople enter the military already in debt.
   ``You don't join the army to get a 6 percent mortgage,'' said
Saul Kramer, a partner with the New York law firm Proskauer Rose
Goetz &amp; Mendelsohn.
   The American Bankers Association, which represents the nation's
commercial banks, said its members ``have a long history of
compliance _ through World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam _ and
will continue to comply,'' said spokesman Mark Burneko.
   A GI would make a request for interest reduction to his or her
bank, which would require verification of active military service.
The government is not required to reimburse the banks for the rate
reduction.
   The law only covers debts incurred before the serviceperson or
reservist begins active military duty. It was designed to ``protect
them from going unduly into debt as a result of service,'' Kramer
said.
   Donner Day, a spokesman for the Department of Veterans Affairs
in Washington, said many people with large incomes who are called
to active duty ``all of a sudden have their salaries transformed to
$500 a month. They're unprepared to satisfy their financial
obligations.''
   Most servicemen are unfamiliar with the law, Day said. Citibank,
the nation's biggest bank and largest consumer lender, has received
a just few dozen calls from customers who may qualify.
   Many bankers say it will probably be a month before they have an
idea of the demand for interest forgiveness.
   The basic savings account was paying about 2 percent interest
when the act was instituted, and Congress has not adjusted the 6
percent cap since the law took effect, Kramer noted.
   ``Obviously the government has great power during times of
distress, like we're in now,'' he said.
   Mortgage rates currently are running slightly above 10 percent;
personal loan rates can approach double that. But experts say that
banks' liability under the law _ spread out among institutions
nationwide _ would be negligible.
   ``It's peanuts,'' said Stephen Berman, an analyst at County
Securities USA, when asked what the law could cost banks. The
nation's financial institutions have been under pressure for some
time because of bad Third World debt, a shaky real estate market
and a slowing economy.
   Among individual banks, Citibank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust
Co. were among the first to acknowledge they will honor requests
from servicepeople who qualify.
   Both institutions have begun setting up verification procedures,
spokespeople said.
   ``Unless someone lists themselves as a private or a sergeant on
a loan application, or lists their employer as the military,'' the
bank would not know, said Citibank spokesman William Ahearn. ``With
reservists, it's almost impossible'' for the bank to know, he added.
   Not everyone being called to duty is likely to qualify for the
break. And the dollar figures involved are not necessarily large.
   The average outstanding home mortgage balance is roughly
$55,000, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
Many homeowners are carrying loans at lower than current rates.
   And recent bank industry statistics show the average credit card
holder has amassed a debt of just $2,042 on his or her credit cards.
   One banker, who asked not to be identified, said any lost
revenue resulting from the law would amount to ``a hiccup.''

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Could Benefit Construction Firms with Middle East Ties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Middle East crisis has caused a dip in
stocks of big construction companies that work in that part of the
world, but some analysts believe they're still a good investment.
   Fluor Corp., an Irvine-based construction and engineering firm,
has seen its stock tumble more than 25 percent since the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait, closing Wednesday at a near 52-week low of
$32\. On Thursday, it closed down further at $31| in trading on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Many investors are nervous about Fluor. The company once had
most of its business in the Middle East and just recently won a
contract in Saudi Arabia potentially worth billions of dollars.
   But securities analyst John N. Simon and fellow analysts suggest
Fluor and other major construction and engineering firms are in
better shape than many people believe and may even benefit from the
crisis.
   Analysts pin the stock price drop on a misunderstanding of
Fluor's Middle East role and general Wall Street jitters.
   ``Is Fluor underpriced? What's underpriced when everybody's
panicking?'' asked Simon, with Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Los
Angeles. ``I certainly haven't told anyone to sell their Fluor
stock, which has gotten some people (mad). To me that's a market
reaction, not a reaction to the current circumstances.''
   Fluor, like Bechtel Corp. in San Francisco and Parsons Corp. in
Pasadena, stands to gain if oil prices stay high and the world
starts looking for oil in places other than the Middle East, some
analysts said.
   The analysts anticipate the demand for oil will increase, with
big construction and engineering firms expected to play a large
role in oil projects in under-tapped regions like Canada and
Vietnam.
   ``A number of both real and emotional factors are moving
stock,'' said Rick Maslin, a Fluor spokesman. ``(But) the price of
oil is going up and it's probably going to mean opportunities will
exist in other parts of the world.''
   Construction and engineering companies with Middle East ties
have put themselves over the last decade in a better position to
weather Gulf crises. Fluor and Parsons, both heavily involved in
the Middle East in the 1970s, are now considerably more
diversified, analysts said.
   Even current Middle East projects do not appear to be threatened.
   Both Fluor and Parsons this summer won contracts from Saudi
Aramco to build and refurbish oil and gas facilities in Saudi
Arabia. The contracts could each be worth more than $4 billion over
the next nine years.
   ``So far, that schedule and work contract have not been impacted
at all,'' said Debra Williams, a spokeswoman for Parsons, a closely
held firm.
   Ms. Williams did not want to speculate at any length on whether
the firm would benefit down the road by the Middle East crisis, but
she added: ``At least at this point, it hasn't impacted the growth
of projects that we're involved in.''
   However, the Middle East crisis has hurt engineering and
construction firms in other ways, from Fluor's stock decline to
concerns about the safety of Middle East employees.
   Parsons has been unable to locate about 100 employees on public
works projects in Kuwait since the Aug. 2 invasion. Among the
missing are 12 U.S. citizens and their eight dependents.
   ``From a business standpoint, we're OK,'' said Williams. ``Our
primary concern is for the people. ... There's basically
around-the-clock attempts at direct communication, and
around-the-clock communication with the State Department.''
   Fluor evacuated dependents of workers on Saudi Arabia projects
and moved employees near the Saudi Arabia-Iraq border to safer
locations. About 100 employees remain in Saudi Arabia, said Maslin.
   Bechtel earlier this month evacuated from Saudi Arabia an
unspecified number of what it called ``non-essential'' workers,
along with employees' dependents.

   Despite the skyrocketing price of gasoline and
rampant accusations of price-gouging, petroleum experts say
consumers aren't feeling the pain nearly as badly as they did
during the oil shocks of the 1970s.
   Some contend oil prices would have to reach $60 a barrel and
gasoline would have to hit $2 a gallon at the pump to make the
situation analogous to the rapid rise in fuel costs Americans
absorbed back then.
   Three weeks after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait sent world petroleum
markets into a frenzy, no one seems ready to predict with certainty
that prices will rise to those levels.
   But industry and government experts said Wednesday they weren't
ruling anything out, with oil prices surging over the $31 barrel
mark for the first time in nearly five years.
   They said all bets would be off if the Middle East standoff
develops into combat that destroys oil facilities in Saudi Arabia,
which has the world's largest known crude oil supply.
   ``If we lost Kuwaiti, Iraqi and Saudi Arabian oil, there would
be a real deficit,'' said Bill Hermann, chief economist for the
Chevron Corp. ``You'd have to cripple most of the Saudi exporting
facilities before that would happen. That would imply a shooting
war, and we would take out (Iraqi) facilities as well.''
   A clash of that magnitude could remove almost a fifth of world
production from the markets, Hermann said.
   Although gasoline prices have jumped about 16 cents to the
$1.24-a-gallon level since the Middle East crisis began, oil
economists said the increase is mild compared with the 1970s price
spirals, after inflation is accounted for.
   Some experts say the inflation-adjusted cost of driving is about
as low as it was more than 40 years ago.
   ``It's the cheapest to propel a car; for one mile it's less than
5 cents,'' Hermann said. He cited Chevron figures, which when
adjusted for inflation, show that it cost 10.5 cents to drive a
mile in 1980 and 8 cents in 1960.
   The Energy Information Administration, an independent
statistical agency of the Energy Department, uses figures that
indicate 1988 was the cheapest year ever for gasoline.
   Oil prices peaked in 1981, following the Iranian revolution.
Unleaded gasoline hit $1.42 per gallon at its height. Federal
statisticians say the pump price would have to climb to $1.98 to
reach the same real price today.
   ``I don't know of anyone who's predicting prices like that,''
said an official with the Energy Information Administration who
spoke on condition of anonymity. His agency is refraining from
making predictions about prices at this point.
   ``There's just too much uncertainty,'' spokesman Jonathan Cogan
said. ``At some point, we will have to go out on a limb and make
some forecasts.''
   Hermann believes that real pump prices of gasoline won't move
back up to the early 1980s levels unless a full-scale war breaks
out and the price of crude oil shoots up to around $40 per barrel.
The government statisticians estimated it would take a crude price
of above $60 a barrel.
   Three weeks after the Kuwait invasion, crude prices were hitting
levels only half that size on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   The American Automobile Association said this week that its
nationwide check of unleaded self-serve regular averaged $1.237 a
gallon on Monday, up 2.1 cents from a week earlier. At the time of
the latest AAA survey, the pump price had gone up 16.2 cents since
the latest oil crisis began.
   But other observers say consumers are paying far more for their
energy as their tax money is used to pick up the tab for the
deployment of the largest U.S. military force since the Vietnam War.
   The president of the National Defense Council Foundation, a
Washington-area think tank, said that if one includes the extra
cost of the military buildup in the Persian Gulf, Americans are
probably paying more than $70 a barrel for oil.
   ``If hostilities break out, you're talking about $100 a
barrel,'' Milton Copulos said.
   A Ralph Nader consumers group, Buyers Up, agreed that energy has
its hidden costs.
   ``A lot of costs we pay for our oil is not factored into the
price,'' research director Christopher Dyson said. Environmental
costs are another factor in the price of energy that is not felt
every time a consumer fills up the family car, Dyson said.
   Despite the statistics that show pump prices are lower when
adjusted for inflation, the Nader group accuses oil companies of
gouging the public by being too quick to pass on price increases
and too slow to pass on price decreases.
   ``We think they are gouging,'' Dyson said. ``We think the price
increases have been unjustified.''
   Oil companies have in recent weeks mounted a public relations
offensive to proclaim their contention that the industry as a whole
is not taking an unfair advantage of the situations. Any improper
pricing has been done on a small scale by retailers, the oil giants
have said, adding that consumers can always drive their cars down
the street to cheaper competitors if that happens.

<HEAD>Dollar Losing ``Safe Haven'' Status In Times of Turmoil</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</NOTE>

   Once upon a time when the world convulsed with
political turmoil or war, global investors would funnel money into
dollars as a ``safe haven'' strategy to preserve their wealth.
   No more.
   Judging by the reaction of investors to the Mideast upheaval,
the dollar has been shunned for German marks, British pounds and
Japanese yen, showing the U.S. currency has lost its pre-eminent
status as an investment refuge, some economists say.
   In the past, the mere threat of war was enough to unleash a
torrent of investments in the dollar and dollar-denominated
securities such as U.S. stocks and bonds. The enormous demand for
dollars from abroad typically sent the value of the currency
soaring relative to yen, mark, pound and other foreign money.
   But since the dollar's brief jump following Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, its value against most other major currencies
has slumped, reaching an all-time low against the mark and a
nine-year low against the pound.
   What went wrong?
   Some experts say the change is the inevitable outcome of the end
of the Cold War.
   Previously, investors feared any conflict could escalate into a
superpower confrontation, with European security at risk, said
David Wyss, chief financial economist at DRI-McGraw-Hill Inc., a
Lexington, Mass., research firm.
   But with U.S.-Soviet relations vastly improved, the prospect of
a global war has all but disappeared, and investors feel secure
leaving their money in Europe or sending it there instead of the
United States, he said.
   ``There isn't the old specter of a European conflagration that
would wipe out all their capital,'' said John McCarthy, chief
currency dealer for Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank in New York. ``In the
past you'd see people liquidating marks, liquidating Swiss francs,
to physically get their capital out of the battlefield.''
   Another reason the dollar hasn't benefited is that currency can
be moved around the world more quickly than a decade ago, experts
say.
   Electronic funds transfer can be accomplished almost
instantaneously. Legal hurdles to shifting funds also have receded.
   ``People don't feel they have to make these asset-allocation
decisions as quickly as they had in the past,'' McCarthy said.
   However, should the Persian Gulf standoff escalate into a
shooting war, the dollar could still benefit, McCarthy said.
   Other experts say the value of the dollar is depressed for
reasons that overshadow its security as an investment.
   Chief among them are worries that the nation is about to enter a
recession, which could erode the value of the currency, said
Lincoln Anderson, an economist at the investment house Bear,
Stearns &amp; Co. Anderson said he isn't convinced the dollar has lost
its safe-haven status.
   Another factor is the rise in interest rates abroad,
particularly in Germany and Britain, compared with U.S. rates. As
interest rates climb elsewhere, dollar-denominated investments such
as U.S. Treasury bonds look less attractive since they don't earn
as high a rate.
   Wyss said the main beneficiaries of the interest rate
differential appear to be the mark and the pound, while the yen has
gained to a lesser extent.
   The dollar bought 1.5885 marks and 147.18 yen at the close of
trading on Aug. 1, the day before Iraq's invasion. By midweek, the
dollar had fallen to about 1.5480 marks _ an all-time low, and
about 146.00 yen.
   The pound cost $1.8555 on Aug. 1. By midweek it took about
$1.9275 to buy one pound, the highest value for the pound since
December 1981.
   ``German interest rates are at least as high as ours, Germany
looks at least as safe, their inflation rate is lower and you no
longer have that military threat from Eastern Europe to worry
about,'' Wyss said.
   The pound and British government bonds have attracted investors
because Britain supplies all its oil needs domestically from the
North Sea, easing inflationary fears associated with the rise in
oil prices, he said.
   Investments in both German and British government bonds are
giving a greater return that U.S. Treasury bonds after each
nation's inflation rate is accounted for, he said.
   The yen and yen-denominated investments have not benefited as
much despite the rise in Japanese interest rates. That's mainly
because Japan is so dependent upon imported oil, leading to concern
about inflation eroding the value of the investments, Wyss said.
The slump in the Japanese stock market hasn't helped matters, he
said.
   Wyss said the apparent lessening of the dollar's safe-haven
status could turn out to be a blessing for the United States.
   ``What we hope this will result in is a more stable dollar, one
that doesn't swing as much on these crises. That is good not only
for the U.S. but for world financial markets,'' he said.
   A weaker dollar is not necessarily bad news. It makes imported
goods more expensive, but U.S. exporters should benefit because
their products are now more competitive price-wise on world
markets. That could help ease the nation's trade deficit.

<HEAD>Questions and Answers on the Falling Dollar</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Hazardous Haven</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar has lost strength for several months, a trend that
continued after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait _ a reversal from
the usual trend in times of turmoil, when investors typically bid
up the value of the dollar.
   Is a falling dollar good or bad for average Americans? The
answer, economists say, is ``it depends.''
   Here are some questions and answers about the dollar's recent
decline:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Who determines the exchange-rate value of the dollar?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Until 1971, its value was rigidly set, first to a certain weight
of gold and later to exchange rates of other major nations'
currencies. But since then, its price has floated, determined by
market forces.
   Each day, hundreds of billions of dollars are bought and sold by
traders in foreign exchange markets in exchange for currencies of
other nations.
   These traders are usually commercial banks or other large
institutional buyers that trade currencies for profit. Central
banks like the Federal Reserve or the Bank of Japan also get
involved when an exaggerated move by a currency requires them to
buy or sell a currency to stabilize the market.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>What makes a dollar ``strong'' or ``weak?''</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The dollar is subject to the same laws of supply and demand as
any commodity traded openly, such as oil or soybeans. Heavy buying
of dollars on exchange markets drives up the dollar's price, making
it ``strong'' compared with other currencies. Heavy selling of
dollars sends the price down, making it ``weak.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   What's better, a strong dollar or a weak dollar?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   It depends. A strong dollar makes Americans' cash go further
overseas and reduces import prices _ generally good for U.S.
consumers and for foreign manufacturers.
   But if the dollar is overvalued, as nearly all economists agree
it was in the early 1980s, U.S. products are harder to sell abroad,
where locally made goods may be cheaper, and at home, where they
compete with low-cost imports. That helped give the United States
its record-breaking trade deficit.
   A weak dollar can restore competitiveness to American products
by making foreign goods comparatively more expensive. But too weak
a dollar can spawn inflation, first through higher import prices
and then through spiraling prices for all goods.
   Worse, a falling dollar can drive foreign investors away from
U.S. securities, which lose value along with the dollar. Foreign
investment is critically needed to help finance the large U.S.
budget deficit.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   If the dollar's value is solely set by market forces, what steps
can governments take to stabilize it?
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Through two basic ways: exchange-market intervention and by
coordinating interest-rate changes.
   Intervention is the direct buying or selling of currencies by
central banks. If the purchases are large enough, that can
influence prices directly. When the Fed, or the Bank of Japan, or
the German Bundesbank, buys dollars directly, that reduces the
supply of dollars available and sends up the price.
   Changes in interest rates affect exchange rates more subtly. But
generally, high interest rates in the United States, compared with
low interest rates abroad, will attract money to dollar-denominated
investments. That raises the value of the dollar.
   Investors will flock to where they can get the highest return.

<HEAD>NASD's Plan For Early Trading To Be Delayed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Securities
Dealers' plan to extend trading hours before dawn has been delayed
by at least a month, thanks to a regulatory snag.
   NASD President Joseph R. Hardiman said Thursday that on-going
negotiations with the Securities and Exchange Commission will push
back the expected start of early hours trading from September until
later in the fall.
   The NASD, which oversees the over-the-counter market _ stocks
that are traded through an electronic market system rather than a
stock exchange _ planned to begin a trading session that started at
3:30 a.m. New York time next month.
   The early start would allow members of the NASDAQ automated
stock quote system in the United States and Britain to trade in
more than 300 securities of U.S. companies, including about 70 now
traded on the London International Exchange, before the markets
opened in this country.
   The move was seen as a step toward round-the-clock trading,
which many say is necessary to keep American markets competitive
with those overseas.
   But the SEC wants more stringent transaction reporting, which
NASD fears will spook London traders who are used to reporting less
information.
   Hardiman, however, said he was confident the difficulty could be
overcome.
   ``It's a hurdle not a roadblock,'' he said, adding ``When you're
the first organization that's trying to introduce an offshore
market, you're forging new ground and you have to deal with some
rule and regulatory issues, not all of which can be anticipated.
   ``We're dealing with this one with the SEC. We're negotiating
with them and I think we'll reach a suitable compromise,'' he said.
   He said he expected trading to begin SEC officials could not be
reached for comment.
   Hardiman explained that in the NASDAQ system in this country,
every trade is reported and disseminated within 90 seconds of its
execution. But in the more thinly traded British market, the stock
ticker reports trades only after three minutes. And in large block
trades, the information is held up for 90 minutes before it is
disseminated.
   NASDAQ had planned not to issue data on every trade but to
report price quotes and volume periodically, which the SEC said
wasn't often enough for the protection of U.S. investors.

   The Federal National Mortgage Association says
it will buy back up to $500 million of its securities to show
management's confidence in Fannie Mae's ability to ride out an
economic downturn.
   Shares of Fannie Mae closed at $26.62{ Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange, down 12{ cents. The stock had been trading as high
as $43.75 on June 12.
   Fannie Mae shares had traded as low as 24~ before the company
announced its plan to buy back common stock and warrants.
   ``If we thought the company's future financial prospects were
materially diminished by the current environment, we wouldn't be as
comfortable considering share repurchasing,'' said Timothy Howard,
Fannie Mae's chief financial officer.
   Shares in Fannie Mae, the nation's largest investor in home
mortgages, usually rise when interest rates fall and drop when the
interest rate rises, reflecting the mortgage industry's dependency
on interest rate movement.
   Fannie Mae is a publicly owned, congressionally-sponsored
corporation that buys mortgages from lenders and resells them to
investors.
   Officials of the Washington-based corporation said the stock
buyback reflects management's confidence in the company's financial
position and future earnings power despite increasing signs of a
pending recession.
   ``We think the overall market in general and Fannie Mae in
particular is down by far more than the company's financial
conditions and prospects would warrant _ even if the economy were
to enter into a recession with high inflation, as seems to be the
current concern,'' said Howard.
   As of June 30, Fannie Mae had about 34 million warrants and 241
million shares of common stock outstanding.
   A warrant is a security that serves as an advance purchase, for
a lower price, of an equal amount of stock to be issued later.
Warrants are usually offered as an inducement or sweetener to
investors to get them to buy accompanying fixed-income securities
such as bonds.
   To offset the buyback, Howard said Fannie Mae will be receiving
up to $500 million in February from the conversion of the
outstanding warrants.
   ``We do not have a fixed time frame in mind,'' he said.
   He said buying back shares with the proceeds of exercised
warrants was ``a fairly common technique for dealing with equity
conversion.''
   In announcing the buyback, Fannie Mae Chairman David O. Maxwell
repeated the company's plan to add between $2 billion and $2.5
billion in capital by the end of next year.
   The company has been criticized in the past for not having
enough capital _ about $3.5 billion _ compared to its more than
$300 billion holdings in mortgages and mortgage securities, to
protect it in times recession or a real estate bust.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump's financial fate last
week lay in the hands of two former state senators, a former county
clerk, a retired IRS administrator and an attorney.
   Those five people make up the New Jersey Casino Control
Commission. On Tuesday, they approved a Byzantine financial deal
that allowed Trump to receive a $65 million emergency loan with his
three Atlantic City casinos put up as collateral.
   The deal is no guarantee Trump will succeed in his attempt to
handle the $3.2 billion in debt he has amassed to build his
fortunes here and in New York, according to a report by the state
Division of Gaming Enforcement.
   The commission is focusing on Trump's overall financial
stability with relicensing hearings moved up to October for all
three of his casinos. The hearings would come just before Trump is
scheduled to make a $47 million bond payment due Nov. 15 on the
Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort.
   As evidenced by this case, the commissioners, who each make less
than $100,000 a year, command a great deal of power as written by
the authors of the 1977 Casino Control Act.
   Critics have long charged the commission with abusing that
power, but defenders say the commission has done its job, keeping
the casinos free of organized crime and fostering a climate that
tries to balance everybody's interest.
   Casino executives lauded the appointment Wednesday of Steven
Perskie, Gov. Jim Florio's chief of staff, as the new chairman of
the commission. His appointment returns acting chairwoman Valerie
Armstrong to a commissioner's role and replaces E. Kenneth Burdge,
a former county clerk, whose term expired.
   Perskie, as a state senator from Atlantic City's county, helped
to write the 1977 Casino Control Act.
   ``This is a very positive move for the industry and a very
positive move for Atlantic City,'' said Al Glasgow, publisher of
the gaming newsletter ``Atlantic City Action'' and a consultant to
Trump. ``He understands Atlantic City.''
   Aside from Perskie, these are the remaining players:
   _ Ms. Armstrong, an Atlantic County attorney and former
admininstative law judge, is generally credited within the industry
with shifting the commission toward what they perceived as fairer
treatment than that of her predecessor, Walter ``Bud'' Read.
   Ms. Armstrong, who was appointed to the commission in 1985, is
not an industry captive. She told attorneys for Trump that, in
essence, they would have to persuade bankers to wait until Tuesday
for a commission ruling because the panel needed time to digest the
thousands of pages of documents submitted by Trump.
   Her ruling Tuesday insisted that Trump's casino licenses be
examined in October, months ahead of their spring due date.
   _Commissioner Frank J. ``Pat'' Dodd is seen as a friend of the
casino industry who acts as a ``lone voice'' on the panel.
   His only questions during the hearings on Trump were for new
Trump chief financial officer Stephen Bollenbach to evaluate the
future of the casino industry.
   Dodd came to the commission in March 1989 after a varied career.
He served as a state senator from Essex County, state Senate
president, failed Democratic gubernatorial candidate in 1981,
chairman of the Hazardous Waste Facilities Siting Commission _ a
panel equal to the casino commission as a lightning rod for anger _
and owner of a string of bars along the shore.
   _Commissioner W. David Waters, appointed in 1986, is seen as the
antithesis to Dodd and a holdover from the Read era. He has been a
strong advocate of ensuring that the 50,000-employee casino
industry hires minorities and women.
   His questions during the Trump hearings asked pointedly about
the absence of a plan detailing an expected trade by Trump of part
of his casino equity to reduce his debt.
   He said he reluctantly voted to approve the deal Tuesday and
hoped Trump's problems show other casinos the danger of piling on
too much debt.
   Waters, a Camden County resident, had been retired from his job
as regional administrator of the Internal Revenue Service when he
was appointed to the commission in 1986.
   _James Hurley is the most recent nominee, coming aboard in
December as the last appointee of the departing administration of
Gov. Thomas Kean.
   The former Republican state senator from Cumberland County has
yet to carve out a role on the commission, usually voting with the
majority. He was silent during the question part of the hearings.

<HEAD>World's Major Airlines Plan Talks On Fare Hikes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major airlines will meet next week to discuss
international passenger fare hikes in response to soaring fuel
prices caused by the Persian Gulf crisis, an industry association
said Friday.
   Thirty to 40 major carriers from all over the world are expected
at the three-day emergency conference starting Wednesday in Geneva,
the International Air Transport Association said.
   Representatives will seek to set a new common fare policy seen
as reasonable enough to gain quick approval by governments, IATA
officials said.
   Industry sources said higher international fares are likely to
start Oct. 1 at the latest. One source, who declined to be
identified, said fares could rise by up 10 percent.
   Crude oil prices have hit their highest levels in five years
after Iraq's occupation of Kuwait and the U.N. trade embargo
against Iraq. Insurance premiums for Middle East flights have
jumped as tension rose in the region.
   Insurance costs are to be discussed at the meeting. One way
airlines could pass on the increase to passengers is through
insurance surcharges on Middle East routes, sources said.
   Whatever the big airlines decide at the IATA-sponsored meeting
will effectively serve as guidelines for other, smaller passenger
carriers.
   Charter fares are expected to rise more sharply than those of
scheduled flights because fuel accounts for a greater proportion of
charter airlines' costs.
   IATA is a group of 200 airlines in 122 countries.

   Wheat futures prices opened slightly higher on
the Chicago Board of Trade today, but other commodities showed some
weakness.
   Corn and soybean futures were under pressure from selling to
take advantage of high prices after Thursday's substantial gains.
In addition, the was some moderate farmer selling of soybeans
overnight.
   Trading action in the wheat pit was light and choppy, with only
minor selling interest. Some commission house buying in the opening
minutes gave the wheat market its initial support.
   One the opening, wheat was unchanged to 2 cents higher with the

   Oil prices dropped in early trading today on
hopes for increased OPEC production in response to the Middle East
crisis.
   Light, sweet crude was down 86 cents to $31.07 per barrel on
October contracts late morning on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Oil prices broke $30 a barrel this week for the first time since
late 1985.
   ``I think the market is reflecting here on the prospects of
higher OPEC production,'' said Bob Baker, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has declined
to meet formally to discuss higher production in the wake of the
international embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. But some producing
states planned to meet on their own this weekend in Vienna.
   On Thursday, crude matched its record high futures price during
the trading day before closing at $31.93 per barrel, up 71 cents.
Unleaded gasoline hit a closing record high for the seventh
straight day.
   This morning, unleaded regular gasoline fell 2.4 cents to $1.061
per gallon this morning on September contracts. Home heating oil
dropped 1.98 cents to 94.25 cents per barrel for September
delivery. Natural gas stayed sluggish, falling from $1.545 to
$1.530 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   During Thursday's trading, crude oil hit $32.35 per barrel for
October delivery, equaling a record set Aug. 2, 1983, the year oil
futures were introduced on the Merc. The exchange is the leading
market for petroleum futures contracts, which determine prices over
the next several months.
   After the 1979 Iranian revolution that ousted the Shah and
curtailed world oil supplies, the cash price of crude reached a
peak of $39.80 per barrel in March 1980.
   Unleaded gasoline hit an all-time high of $1.11 per gallon for
September delivery Thursday before settling at a record-high
closing price of $1.086. Gasoline has set new record closing prices
every day since Aug. 15, with prices at the pump also on the rise.
   Gasoline futures rose in part because of a fire and a leak at
two Texas refineries that were cutting back an already tight supply
of petroleum products.
   Shell Oil Co. said 165,000 barrels of crude cannot be refined
daily because of a fire at its plant in Deer Park, Texas, although
a spokesman was not sure how long repairs might take. Another Shell
spokesman said customers would be supplied through other plants.
   Also, a leak at the Crown Central Petroleum Corp. refinery in
the Houston area forced a partial shutdown that analysts said would
probably not disrupt supplies for more than a day or two.
   Some analysts said the shortfall was significant in light of
further potential declines in imports because of the Middle East
crisis.

   The British Office of Fair Trading asked major oil
companies Friday to explain the increase in gasoline prices since
the outbreak of the Gulf crisis.
   Prices have risen from around 2.041 pounds ($3.98) a gallon on
July 25 to 2.178 pounds ($4.24) a gallon this week. That's a rise
of 87.6 cents to 93.4 cents per liter.
   The Office of Fair Trading, an arm of government that acts as an
independent consumer watchdog, said it asked Shell, Esso, BP,
Texaco and Mobil for ``an account of the impact which the current
Middle East crisis has had on the companies' operations.''
   The oil companies said they welcomed the request because it
would enable them to disprove allegations that they have been
profiting unfairly from the rise in oil prices since Iraq invaded
Kuwait Aug. 2.
   They noted that the industry had already been investigated and
cleared by anti-trust agencies.
   ``We will as usual cooperate fully with this request and we
welcome the opportunity to help clear the air,'' BP said.
   Shell said it is losing one million pounds ($1.95 million) a day
on gas station sales because pump prices are failing to keep pace
with oil price increases.

<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. said Friday it
would cut more jobs due to a shrinking military budget.
   GE Aerospace said it would eliminate 650 jobs in Burlington by
1992 and will close a facility in Huntsville, Ala., by the end of
next year.
   The Alabama site employs 400 people, and about half the workers
will be offered jobs in Daytona Beach, Fla., under a consolidation
plan, said Terry Dunn, a GE spokesman.
   Last week, GE Aircraft Engines announced it was eliminating
1,500 jobs from its plants in Lynn, Mass., and Evendale, Ohio.
About one-third of those jobs will be lost through layoffs.
   As with the previous announcement, GE cited military spending
cuts in its decision.
   ``To stay competitive in a smaller and rapidly changing defense
market, we need to make the most efficient use of our manufacturing
facilities and other resources,'' Mike Smith, vice president of the
aircraft electronics division, said in a statement.
   Products at the Burlington plant include automated test
equipment for such military vehicles as tanks and helicopters.
Huntsville has served as a development site for an electronic test
system for the Navy.
   Under the new company structure, Burlington will focus on
automated test equipment but other product lines will be
transferred to other sites.
   The cuts in Burlington and Huntsville ``will result largely from
layoffs,'' GE said. But Dunn said the company hoped to minimize the
extent of layoffs through attrition and worker relocation.
   GE said it would offer a severance package and would help
employees find new jobs.

   Share prices on London's stock exchange closed
higher Friday for the first time in seven trading days, following
recoveries in the U.S. and Tokyo stock markets.
   After reaching intraday highs in early afternoon trading, the
London market slowed and then began to retreat.
   ``The market wanted to close up today,'' said one trader. This
was related to book-squaring before the long British bank holiday
weekend. But a trader at one securities house said his company was
preparing to work Monday despite the holiday in case of a flareup
in the Middle East crisis.
   At the close, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index

<HEAD>IBM Expected to Announce New Mainframe Computers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM is expected to announce Sept. 5 plans
for introducing new mainframe computers twice as powerful as the
current systems, a market research group said Friday.
   Richard Imershein, senior vice president of Stamford-based
Gartner Group Inc., said the announcement will come in two phases.
   The Sept. 5 announcement will introduce upgrades for IBM's
highly successful 4381 line of minicomputers and a related family
of smaller minicomputers, the 9370, Imershein said.
   Toward the end of next year, he said, IBM will announce new
technology to replace the current systems and more than double
their capacity.
   ``The announcement on (Sept. 5) will be the announcement of the
move,'' Imershein said. ``The first deliveries will basically be
some new covers and some new frames and some new power supplies.
... But the actual new machine itself, we don't believe will come
until the second half of 1991.''
   Amos Kermisch, spokesman at the company's headquarters in
Armonk, N.Y., confirmed that IBM would be making a major
announcement Sept. 5, and that mainframe computers would be part of
that announcement.
   The announcement will be made at IBM's Poughkeepsie, N.Y.,
plant, which makes mainframes, Kermisch said.
   ``We're doing it where we manufacture large systems, but there's
something for just about everybody in the announcement,'' he said.
   Kermisch declined to release details about the announcement.
   Imershein said Gartner Group believes IBM is making the
announcement next month in response to competitive pressures from
Hitachi and Amdahl Corp., which have been improving their mainframe
product lines.
   ``They really would have preferred to do it in the second half
of '91, but they can't wait,'' he said.
   The bulk of IBM's customers aren't expected to leap quickly to
the new mainframes, Imershein said.
   ``The people who are at the front end, (who) need the capacity,
will make the move,'' he said. ``The rest of them will kind of lay
back and wait.''

<TEXT>
   Sematech, a group of leading U.S.
electronics firms, announced Friday what it called a
state-of-the-art technology breakthrough with the development of a
super-small computer device.
   Sematech made a device one-half micron thick that will be used
to build integrated circuits, which are components of computer
chips. One-half micron is one millionth of a meter.
   The current industry edge is 0.8 micron circuitry, Sematech's
chief administrative officer, Peter Mills said. The smaller,
half-micron size means 2{ times more information can be stuffed
onto the same size chip, he said.
   ``Half-micron technology is leading edge and state of the art,''
Mills said.
   ``This is another milestone that indicates that the investment
the American taxpayer has made here is a good investment,'' said
Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who with Rep. J.J. ``Jake'' Pickle,
D-Texas, was on hand for the announcement.
   ``It is yielding a rate of return in terms of American
competitiveness, which means higher standards of living, more jobs,
better jobs for our people,'' he said.
   Sematech was created to regain U.S. superiority in the
semiconductor industry. Its $226 million annual budget is split
between the federal government and the 14 private company members.
   Development of the one-half micron device keeps Sematech on
schedule in its plan to achieve manufacturing parity with Japan,
Mills said. In the late 1980s, Japan surpassed the U.S. in the
worldwide semiconductor market, he said.
   Mills said the device was made with American equipment by
American-trained semiconductor manufacturing specialists.
   He said the next step will be to manufacture a 0.35 micron
device. This, he said, would help the U.S. reclaim its leadership
in the semiconductor industry.

   ``After yesterday's strength, nobody wanted to sell,'' said
Mickey Luth, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``The

   Combining to give soybeans a boost were lower carryover stocks,
reduced South American production and smaller amounts of competing
crops.
   Grain prices, on the other hand, were weak.
   ``They don't have the dynamics of soybeans,'' said Luth. ``The
corn supply is getting bigger, not smaller. And there's no risk of

crop will make it past Oct. 1 and into the harvest season without
suffering any severe frost damage.

<HEAD>Data General to Lay Off 2,000 More Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Data General Corp., which has repeatedly cut its
payroll while trying to end a string of losses, announced Friday it
would lay off more than 2,000 additional workers over the next
several weeks.
   The announcement was widely expected by Wall Street analysts,
but some questioned whether the cost-cutting steps would allow the
computer company to turn a profit.
   Because of the layoffs and accompanying severance payments, the
company will record a charge of approximately $70 million against
the fourth quarter, which ends Sept. 29. Data General expects to
suffer a loss in the quarter.
   Friday's announcement marked the sixth time the Westboro,
Mass.-based company has cut sharply into its work force since 1985,
the last year Data General reported a profit.
   Since that year, employment at Data General has shrunk from
17,700 to its current level of 11,700, which does not include
Friday's cuts.
   Data General, like other Massachusetts computer companies, has
suffered from declines in the market for mid-size minicomputers.
Data General has tried to revamp its product line, marketing
smaller, desktop computer workstations. Part of the strategy is to
make products that operate according to industry standards.
   Data General President Ronald L. Skates said in a statement that
the company now has ``the organization in place and the appropriate
mix of employee resources to compete successfully in today's
information technology marketplace.''
   ``That is a well-worn phrase from these guys,'' said Christopher
Mines, an analyst with Cowen &amp; Co. in Boston.
   Analysts say the new products are performing well, but they have
not yet offset the continuing losses in minicomputers. As a result,
overall revenues have remained weak.
   For the first nine months of the current fiscal year, the
company had revenues of $907 million, compared with $957 million
for the same period a year ago.
   Data General also faces stiff competition for its new products,
and analysts say the company must show it can turn a profit in
order to attract more customers.
   ``It's one of these spiral things,'' Mines said. ``You erode
customer confidence ... with every losing quarter that goes by.''
   Data General says its primary goal is to become profitable.
   ``Today's announcement indicates we have to reduce costs,'' said
James Dunlap, a company spokesman. But he added: ``Our hope is this
will be the final time we will have a major reduction.''
   But as long as the revenues remain uncertain, more cost-cutting
steps might be needed, said Barry Willman, an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein in New York.
   The company did not immediately specify where the layoffs will
occur. But Dunlap said Massachusetts, where the company employs
3,200, will be among the areas largely affected.

<HEAD>UAW Has All Three Proposals; Mulling Strike Target</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union on Friday perused
contract proposals from each of the Big Three automakers, starting
the process of choosing which company it will choose for
negotiations in the next three weeks.
   The UAW got the first comprehensive contract proposal from
Chrysler Corp. on Friday, the day after it received documents from
General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
   ``Loosely speaking, they are all in the American League, if not
the same ballpark,'' a UAW source, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Friday. ``There are some conspicuous absences in
the Chrysler proposal. GM's is a slightly fleshier proposal than is
Ford's.''
   The UAW and industry observers have been wondering if Chrysler
will be successful in breaking from the tradition of pattern
bargaining and negotiate an agreement significantly different from
that at the other two U.S. automakers.
   In pattern bargaining, the UAW chooses one of the three
companies, reaches and agreement and in effect imposes it on the
other two automakers.
   Chrysler, on the shakiest financial ground of the Big Three, has
indicated it may not be able to afford a contract reached with the
richer GM or Ford. But the UAW said it has no plans to break with
the pattern bargaining tradition.
   Union and company officials publicly have declined to discuss
the proposals' details, which doubtlessly will change in the days
ahead. Each company's initial offer gives a broad idea of what it
is seeking, but is also an attempt to persuade the union to choose
it as the UAW target company.
   During the past week, after visiting the main bargaining tables
at each of the Big Three, UAW President Owen Bieber has said the
proposals will play major parts in next week's decision of which
company will become the target.
   The UAW leadership meets Monday and Tuesday in Detroit to choose
a target, widely believed to be GM.
   The union's current contracts with the Big Three expire Sept. 14
and cover more than 450,000 active workers. Employees on layoff and
retirees, also covered by the contracts, add thousands to the total.
   The union has targeted job security as its overriding concern
during this year's negotiations. Companies have said they will be
seeking increased flexibility of the work force and reductions in
their health care expenses.

   Stock prices rallied sharply today in a
technical rebound from the market's free-fall slide of the past
several weeks.
   Analysts said buyers were encouraged by hopes that the markets
had gone too far in their appraisal of the potential calamities
resulting from the showdown in the Middle East.
   But by near-unanimous agreement the mood in the marketplace
remained cautious and touchy.
   It will take months, economists observe, to gauge the effects on
business aactivity of the upsurge in oil prices and interest rates
that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Even without that disruptive influence, the domestic economy was
widely believed to have been verging on a recession as it began the
second half of 1990.

   Motorists may be fuming as gasoline prices seem
to get higher with every fillup, but petroleum experts say
consumers aren't getting squeezed nearly as badly as they were a
decade ago.
   Some contend oil prices would have to reach $60 a barrel and gas
would have to hit $2 a gallon at the pump to make the situation
analogous to the rapid rise in fuel costs in the months after the
Iranian revolution.
   Oil prices peaked in 1981 after the revolution, and unleaded
gasoline hit $1.42 per gallon at its height. But federal
statisticians indicate the pump price would have to climb to $1.98
to reach the same real price today.
   The American Automobile Association reported Friday that prices
at the pump had risen to their highest levels since the 1982 Fourth
of July weekend, averaging $1.274 nationwide for a gallon of
self-serve regular unleaded. That's up 3.7 cents since Monday.
   But it's far below the $2 mark that would have to set in before
gasoline could take an early '80s-style bite out of the family
budget.
   Between the days of peak gasoline prices and the current oil
crisis, fuel prices have dropped to their lowest level since the
end of World War II, when adjusted for inflation.
   ``It's the cheapest (time) to propel a car _ for one mile it's
less than 5 cents,'' said Bill Hermann, chief economist with
Chevron Corp. Company figures, when adjusted for inflation,
indicate it cost 10.5 cents to drive a mile in 1980 and 8 cents in
1960.
   The Energy Information Administration uses figures that indicate
1988 was the cheapest year ever for gasoline.
   Even though nobody in the industry or the government seems
willing to predict $2-a-gallon gas, the experts refuse to rule
anything out. Oil prices shot past $30 a barrel this week for the
first time since late 1985, in a futures market that has traded
nervously since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Several experts contacted by The Associated Press said all bets
would be off if the Middle East standoff develops into combat that
destroys oil facilities in Saudi Arabia, which has the world's
largest known crude supply.
   ``If we lost Kuwaiti, Iraqi and Saudi Arabian oil, there would
be a real deficit,'' Hermann said. ``You'd have to cripple most of
the Saudi exporting facilities before that would happen. That would
imply a shooting war, and we would take out (Iraqi) facilities as
well.''
   A clash of that magnitude could remove almost one-fifth of world
production from the markets, he said.
   Hermann believes that real pump prices of gasoline won't move
back up to 1981-scale levels unless a full-scale war breaks out and
the price of crude shoots up to $40 per barrel. Government
statisticians estimated it would take a crude price above $60 a
barrel.
   Those who follow the industry also point out that U.S. consumers
pay far less than their counterparts in most other nations. Gas in
Britain, for instance, was about $4.24 a gallon this week,
according to that government's Office of Fair Trading.
   But other observers say U.S. consumers are paying far more for
their energy as their tax money is used to pay for the deployment
of the largest military force since the Vietnam War.
   The president of the National Defense Council Foundation, a
Washington-area think tank, said that including the extra cost of
the military buildup, Americans are probably paying more than $70
per barrel of oil.
   ``If hostilities break out, you're talking about $100 a
barrel,'' Milton Copulos said.
   Despite the statistics that show pump prices are lower when
adjusted for inflation, a Ralph Nader consumers group, Buyers Up,
accuses oil companies of gouging the public by being too quick to
pass on price increases and too slow to pass on decreases.
   Oil companies in recent weeks have mounted a public relations
offensive to dispel such accusations. Spokesmen for three major
companies said Friday they were glad the Justice Department's
Antitrust Division was looking into pricing practices because they
believe the probe will show the industry is playing fairly.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises Ahead of Uncertain Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar repeated what is becoming a usual
Friday performance _ rising ahead of an uncertain weekend in the
tense Persian Gulf.
   Gold prices advanced after drifting lower overseas. On New
York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled at $415 a troy ounce, up $3
an ounce from Thursday. Republic National Bank later quoted a bid
of $414, up $2.75 an ounce.
   After falling in the previous session to new lows against the
German mark, the Swiss franc and the British pound, the dollar was
ripe for a technical rebound. The currency began rising in Asian
trading and continued to gain ground when activity shifted to
Europe and then the United States.
   Traders continued to focus on developments in the Middle East,
where a tense standoff got under way at foreign embassies in
Kuwait. The U.S. embassy and at least seven other missions were
encircled by Iraqi troops as diplomats defied an order to close
their doors.
   ``There's a threat of military conflict over the weekend, and
despite all the obvious concerns over the economy, the knee-jerk
reaction says you buy dollars,'' said Earl Johnson, a vice
president at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
   Traders agreed that if hostilities do not break in the next few
days, the dollar is likely to resume its descent.
   ``Events are arguing for a higher dollar, but fundamentals are
arguing for a lower dollar,'' said Stephen Flanagan, a vice
president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Indeed, the Commerce Department reported the economy grew at a
sluggish annual rate of 1.2 percent in the second quarter. Though
traders said there was little reaction to the report, they said
that the notion of broad economic weakness is not being lost on the
market.
   Further underscoring the economy's softness, the department said
after-tax corporate profits slipped 0.2 percent in the period, the
worst showing since a 5.9 percent decline in the third quarter of
1989.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 145.70 Japanese yen from
145.88 at Thursday's close. But it rose later in London to 146.45
yen and continued to gain ground, settling in New York at 146.75
yen, up from 146.12 yen on Thursday.
   In London, the British pound fetched $1.9445, cheaper than
$1.9515 late Thursday. In New York it cost $1.9400 to buy one
pound, less expensive than Thursday's $1.9570.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.5605 German marks, up from 1.5445;
1.2720 Swiss francs, up from 1.2560; 5.2360 French francs, up from
5.1855; 1,159.50 Italian lire, up from 1,152.00, and 1.1353
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1293.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates included: 1.5575 German marks, up from 1.5478; 1.2685 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2598; 5.2275 French francs, up from 5.1835;
1.7550 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7390; 1,157.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,151.25; 1.1335 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1313.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $411.75 a troy ounce,
from $412.75 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal settled at a
closing bid of $410.75, down from $411.75. Earlier in Hong Kong,
gold fell $2.61 to close at a bid $410.95.
   Silver prices were mixed. On New York's Comex silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.187 a troy ounce, up from $5.126 on
Thursday. In London the metal fell to a late bid price of $5.14 an
ounce, from $5.15.

   A developer whose firm rejuvenated urban centers
around the country was killed along with his wife and daughter when
their private plane crashed between two houses Friday.
   The two houses went up in flames, but their occupants escaped
injury.
   Killed were pilot Michael Spear, 49, president of The Rouse Co.,
his wife, Judy, 47, and their 19-year-old daughter, Jodi, police
said.
   The company's projects include Boston's Faneuil Hall shopping
area, Harbor Place on the Baltimore waterfront, South Street
Seaport in New York and Underground Atlanta.
   ``This is a terrible loss to the Rouse Co. and to the country,''
said James W. Rouse, retired founder of the Columbia, Md.-based
company. ``Mike Spear was a brilliant, compassionate, wise man. His
leadership was tremendous. In many respects, he is irreplaceble.
Judy was a wonderful woman who made a great contribution in her own
right, as well as to Mike's work.''
   The Spears lived in Columbia, Md., but had a summer home in
Chatham on Cape Cod.
   Spear joined Rouse in 1967 as director of market research and
project evaluation. From 1971 to 1978, he was general manager of
the Columbia project that established the planned city between
Baltimore and Washington. Spear was named executive vice president
for development in 1978. He became president in 1986. He and his
wife had three other daughters.
   Federal officials are investigating the cause of the crash.
   The plane went down on a dead-end street in the city's Mattapan
section. The small white airplane crashed into a driveway between
two houses, incinerating two parked cars and setting the houses on
fire.
   Spear left foggy Cape Cod around 6 a.m. in his two-engine
Cheyenne turboprop, bound for Logan International Airport. His
daughter was to fly from there to Tokyo, where she planned to study
this fall, said a friend of the family.
   The aircraft was 20 miles from Logan when Spear reported engine
trouble, said Michael Ciccarelli, spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration. About seven miles from the airport he
began efforts to land.
   Spear first reported lack of speed, then smoke, then that an
engine was out. At 6:30 a.m. the plane disappeared from the radar
screen. Visibility was one-quarter of a mile, said FAA spokeswoman
Gail Lattrell.
   People in the neighborhood said they heard a low-flying
aircraft, the sound of an engine cutting out and then a thud as the
plane hit the ground.
   ``I was in bed, not asleep, when I heard this tremendous
explosion,'' said Neal Silver, 66, who lives a few houses from the
crash site. ``My neighbors were pounding on the door. I looked out
and I could see these whole two buildings engulfed in flames.''
   Neighbors poured into the street as thick black smoke billowed
to the sky.
   Mayor Raymond Flynn sent dispatched teams of post-trauma experts
to the neighborhood to help people there deal with the disaster.
   The Red Cross and other agencies offered emergency assistance to
the displaced families.

<TEXT>
   The gasoline prices at Edmond
Nassar's Arco station were stunning to Ron and Nancy Sutton, who
needed some good news after a Yosemite vacation interrupted by
wildfires.
   Preparing for the last mountainous stretch back to Los Angeles,
they pulled off Highway 99 on Thursday to see it posted in big
black letters: unleaded gas, 93.9 cents. Just down the road, a
Texaco station was charging nearly $1.20.
   But the low price wouldn't last. Later in the day, Atlantic
Richfield Co. said it would end a two-week freeze and raise
wholesale prices 2{ cents per gallon on average to its dealers.
   The company said it could no longer supply enough gas to meet
demand for the lower prices.
   That means Arco, the eighth-largest U.S. oil company and largest
gas marketer in the West, has ended an action that not only
increased its market share, but yielded a rare public relations
dividend at a time when other big oil companies were accused of
gouging consumers.
   Iraq's invasion of tiny, oil-rich Kuwait has caused prices to
soar for both crude oil and gasoline. A barrel of crude has risen
from $21 to $30, while the price of unleaded regular gasoline
increased from $1.075 per gallon on Aug. 1 to $1.237 this week,
according to a spot check of self-service stations by the American
Automobile Association.
   Arco was able to freeze prices because it normally gets 100
percent of its crude oil from its own Alaska operations. Eugene
Nowak, the head of the energy research group at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., said that ready supply provided a cushion for the
company as it decided to freeze prices.
   Arco, considered a low-priced marketer, also relied on its West
Coast refineries and all-self service stations to keep prices 2 to
3 cents cheaper than competitors.
   Its wholesale prices had fallen as much as 13 cents per gallon
below competitors in some markets since the Iraqi invasion.
   But those low prices caused a surge in sales volume that
approached 20 percent by Thursday, overtaxing Arco's ability to
re-supply many stations, said George H. Babikian, president of
marketing and refining.
   ``We had our refineries at capacity, we were delivering every
drop we could with our own fleet, we were working people on
overtime to exhaustion, we hired every common carrier we could
find, and still we were running out at 150 to 160 stations a day,
sometimes for four hours,'' Babikian said.
   Babikian disputed suggestions that the company's price freeze
was intended to curry favor with Washington in hopes that more
Alaska land will be opened to exploration, or that a return of a
windfall profits tax on oil can be headed off.
   ``I think our motive was very pure, to help the president in
this very difficult situation,'' he said.
   President Bush appealed for voluntary price restraints following
the invasion.
   Babikian said the plea ``sounded like a very reasonable request
to us, and so we did it. To the extent that it generates good will
in Washington, heck, we need all the help we can get.
   ``And the same thing goes for good will at the pump,'' he said.
``But those weren't the reasons we did it.''
   Scott Jones, a former Arco staff economist who is now president
of AUS Consultants in suburban Philadelphia, said he believes the
freeze was intended to increase market share. He said the move
helped reassert Arco's image as a low-price leader and win good
will for its corporate citizenship.
   It also smooths the way for the introduction this fall of
additional lower-polluting fuels. The new gasolines, replacing
unleaded varieties, cost more to make and presumably will cost more
at the pump.
   ``It's difficult to appeal to people's sense of the environment
at $1.30 a gallon, where it would have been easy at $1.05,'' Jones
said. ``But if anyone can do it, (Arco) can, given the good will
they've generated.''
   But George Baker, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Research in New
York, dismissed market share as a major reason for Arco's action,
saying he believed the company was already satisfied with its
inroads. Perhaps more important strategically to Arco, Baker said,
was the hope it can help calm congressional critics accusing the
oil industry of price gouging.
   ``I think they (at Arco) do want the oil business to be in a
stable political and economic environment,'' he said.
   Babikian said Arco would not increase the wholesale price of its
gasoline beyond increases in its refineries' crude oil prices,
which he said track the world market.
   Now that Arco has ended the freeze, dealers in southern
California, Arizona and Nevada will pay up to 5 cents per gallon
more for their stocks, although company officials and dealers say
Arco's prices will still be the lowest around.
   Nassar, the Bakersfield dealer, said Arco had always supplies
him gas cheaply enough to allow him to meet his goal _ beating or
meeting the lowest priced competitors in town.
   ``Even with the price increase, we're still the lowest,'' Nasser
said. ``So we still have a great deal of room to play without
losing our competitive edge.''

   Gasoline prices have climbed 19.9 cents per
gallon since Aug. 1, making for the most expensive fillups in more
than eight years, the American Automobile Association said Friday.
   Self-serve regular unleaded gasoline averaged $1.274 nationwide,
up 3.7 cents since Monday, the AAA reported. The price is the
highest since the Independence Day 1982 price of $1.296.
   The survey is based on a review of 5,000 stations nationwide.
   The nation's supplies of gasoline are adequate in spite of the
Mideast crisis caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the AAA said.
But it is urging motorists to practice energy conservation.
   Average regional per-gallon prices from Friday's survey: New

Midwest, $1.281; Southeast, $1.249; Southwest, $1.241; and West,

   Stock prices staged a sharply rally near the
close Friday in what analysts described as a technical rebound from
the market's free-fall slide of the past several weeks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had plunged
173.02 points over the three previous sessions, climbed 49.50 to
2,532.92.
   The average finished the week with a net loss of 111.88 points,
for its biggest weekly decline since it fell 118.67 points Jan.
22-26.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
956 up, 649 down and 410 unchanged.
   Analysts said buyers were encouraged by hopes that the markets
had gone too far in their appraisal of the potential calamities
resulting from the showdown in the Middle East.
   But by near-unanimous agreement the mood in the marketplace
remained cautious and touchy.
   It will take months, economists observe, to gauge the effects on
business aactivity of the upsurge in oil prices and interest rates
that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Even without that disruptive influence, the domestic economy was
widely believed to have been verging on a recession as it began the
second half of 1990.
   Brokers said traders' spirits apparently got a lift from a
flurry of announcements of corporate stock-buyback plans, in a
manner reminiscent of the aftermath of the 1987 crash.
   In one of the most notable early instances, Federal National
Mortgage Association said it had earmarked as much as $500 million
for purchases of its common shares and warrants.
   Fannie Mae shares, which traded as low as 24~ Thursday before
the company made its announcement, rose 2&rsqb; to 29 in Friday's
trading.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose 2~ to
61&rsqb;; International Business Machines 3{ to 100&rsqb;; Boeing 3&rsqb; to 45~,
and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 1&rsqb; to 31~.
   Recently-battered closed-end country funds also scored some
notable gains. Germany Fund picked up 1~ to 12&rsqb;; Thai Fund 2\ to
16{, and ROC Taiwan Fund 1 to 6~.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 199.04 million
shares, against 250.44 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 241.11 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $36.56 billion, or
1.26 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 2.17 to 171.05.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 6.52 to 368.75, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 4.45 at 311.51.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
jumped 7.11 to 367.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 316.29, up .44.

<HEAD>With Stock Prices Depressed, Companies Buy Back Shares</HEAD>

   The stock market's depressed levels opened the
door Friday for a number of companies to launch or extend stock
buyback programs.
   A.O. Smith Corp., which had suspended a share repurchase program
in June 1989, said it was resuming stock buybacks. The company, a
manufacturer of auto, truck and farm equipment, allocated $7.5
million for the repurchases.
   The toymaker Hasbro Inc. said its board approved the buyback of
up to 3 million shares. Western Publishing Group Inc., First
Illinois Corp., First Financial Holdings Inc. and Bernard Chaus
Inc. were among other companies announcing stock buybacks Friday.
   Other firms have already been in the market this week, picking
up their own shares at bargain prices. On Tuesday, the investment
firm Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. repurchased 2.36 million shares of its
stock when the price hit a 52-week low.
   A.O. Smith vice president Edward J. O'Connor attributed the
timing of the firm's resumption of its buybacks in part to the
declines on Wall Street over the past month. A.O. Smith stock
closed at $14.87{ Friday, up 25 cents in American Stock Exchange
trading.
   Since the stock market reached an all-time closing high of
2,999.75 on July 17, the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen
nearly 470 points as Wall Street was wracked by concerns about a
recession in the United States and war in the Middle East.
   The Dow Jones average has dropped more than 366 points since
Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait. The closely-watched
index closed Friday at 2,532.92, up 49.50.
   The flurry of repurchase plans recalls the October 1987 stock
market crash, when firms including International Business Machines
Corp., USX Corp., Citicorp, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co.
began to scoop up their own shares at lower prices.
   Stock buybacks are popular among shareholders. Since repurchases
reduce the number of shares available, they tend to support the
price of a company's stock, and also enhance a firm's balance sheet
by raising its earnings per share.
   Dexter Corp., which also extended its stock repurchase program
Friday, also wanted to provide a market for shareholders who wanted
to unload their stock but couldn't.
   ``There are times when there are virtually no buyers of the
stock and we can provide liquidity for our stockholders who want to
sell,'' said Dexter executive vice president Robert E. McGill.
   Buybacks also represent a vote of confidence in a firm by its
management, which takes millions of dollars from corporate coffers
to repurchase the shares.
   The stock market's decline prompted Penn Central Corp. to lower
the price on its tender offer for 10 million of its shares. Penn
Central said Friday it would pay $23 per share, instead of the $26
it had offered earlier.
   The company blamed the tensions in the Middle East ``and the
consequent deterioration in general market conditions, including
the market price for the company's common stock'' for the change in
its offer.
   Penn Central's announcement also harks back to the 1987 crash,
when several tender offers or buyout plans were canceled or put on
hold.
   Penn Central stock closed Friday at $21.87{ a share on the New
York Stock Exchange, up 12{ cents.
   And Sun Microsystems Inc. said it was withdrawing a planned
stock offering because of deteriorating market conditions. Sun had
announced plans for the offering earlier this month.

   Oil prices fell back Friday, as traders saw
little news from the Middle East and decided to take their profits
from a week of high prices that broke some records and tied others.
   Light sweet crude fell $1.02 per barrel to $30.91 for October
delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but never dropped
below the $30 mark it hit Wednesday for the first time since
November 1985.
   ``We're really not down very much,'' said Bob Baker, an analyst
with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Unleaded gasoline also closed lower Friday, down 3.89 cents to
$1.047 per gallon for September delivery. The drop broke a
seven-day streak of record high closes that began Aug. 15.
   Later contract months were also down, as were contracts for
light sweet crude.
   During the week's trading, crude matched its all-time high
futures price of $32.35 per barrel, and unleaded gasoline set an
all-time record of $1.11 per gallon. Both highs came Thursday.
   As the wild week came to an end, analysts said the price of
petroleum products, including gasoline and heating oil, had risen
too high in proportion to the price of crude, so they had been
destined to fall.
   ``Products were under pressure, simply from being exceedingly
high,'' Baker said.
   ``What we saw, basically from the beginning of the day, was
profit taking,'' said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ``A lot of players wanted to take
their profits for the weekend.''
   The closing price of crude oil Friday was up $2.28 per 42-gallon
barrel for the week. Unleaded gasoline, which traded above $1 per
gallon on the Merc for the first time ever on Monday, stayed above
that level all week for an 8.7 cent increase on September contracts.
   Home heating oil closed at 90.96 cents per gallon for September
delivery, down 5.27 cents for the day but up 10.42 cents for the
week.
   Natural gas closed at $1.525 per 1,000 cubic feet for October
delivery, down from $1.545 on Thursday but up from $1.440 a week
earlier.
   Although a lack of news from the Middle East stirred concerns
and uncertainties that sent markets soaring earlier in the week,
traders viewed Friday's lack of major developments as a calming
factor, Hittle said.
   A day earlier, traders had worried about the pending showdown as
the United States refused Iraqi demands that the embassy in Kuwait
be closed by Friday. Iraq reportedly threatened Friday that it
would use force to remove the diplomats on Saturday.
   ``The fact that nothing happened eased things a bit,'' Hittle
said, although traders remain nervous about the possibility of
military escalation. The rising fuel costs have been taking their
toll on motorists who see prices going up at the pump.
   The American Automobile Association reported Friday that its
latest nationwide survey of pump prices showed an average price of
$1.274 for a self-serve gallon of regular unleaded. That was a 3.7
cent rise since Monday and represented the highest cost at the pump
since the 1982 Independence Day weekend, the AAA said.

<HEAD>Recession Fears Pressue Cattle Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cattle futures prices slipped lower Friday at the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange under continuing fears of a recession.
   On other markets, oil prices turned lower; soybeans and wheat
advanced while corn was lower; and gold posted some minor gains.
   Cattle prices are vulnerable on a number of fronts and are now
at the mercy of the Mideast energy crisis and the potential for a
recession, said Paul Hare, an analyst in Chicago with Linnco
Futures Inc.
   ``There's also some concern about the profitability for cattle
prices this fall because of the extremely high prices that were
paid for feeders in the early spring and midsummer,'' he said.
   The cash market isn't helping, either, with cash feeders falling
$2 to $5 per hundredweight on Friday, Hare said.
   In contrast, pork futures showed some stability following a
period of sharp declines in cash prices. With the price for pork
products on the decline, traders were hoping these items would be
featured at the meat counters and give a boost to demand.
   Cattle futures settled .25 cent to .75 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in October at 76.17 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .55 cent to 1.15 cents lower with August at 88.17 cents
a pound; hogs were unchanged to .33 cent higher with October at
48.42 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.82 cents lower
to .30 cent higher with August at 41.90 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices advanced on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``After yesterday's strength, nobody wanted to sell,'' said
Mickey Luth, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``The
fundamentals were there to drive it higher.''
   He said bean prices are benefiting from lower carryover stocks,
reduced South American production and smaller amounts of competing
crops.
   Grain prices, on the other hand, were weak.
   ``They don't have the dynamics of soybeans,'' said Luth. ``The
corn supply is getting bigger, not smaller. And there's no risk of
frost.''
   The latest 6- to 10-day forecast calls for warm temperatures in
the main corn-growing regions, and Luth said he feels confident the
crop will make it past Oct. 1 and into the harvest season without
suffering any severe frost damage.
   Wheat was 1 cent lower to 1} cents higher with the contract for
delivery in September at $2.84} a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower
to \ cent higher with September at $2.57} a bushel; oats were 1\
cents lower to } cent higher with September at $1.18 a bushel; and
soybeans were 1{ cents lower to 5 cents higher with September at
$6.30 a bushel.
   Petroleum futures concluded a week of Mideast-inspired price
increases with declines across the board at the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Light sweet crude oil retreated 58 cents to $1.72 with the
October contract settling at $30.91 a barrel; heating oil was 5.27
cents to 5.94 cents lower with September at 90.96 cents a gallon;
and unleaded gasoline was 2.05 cents to 4.44 cents lower with
September at $1.0466 a gallon.
   Precious metals futures erased losses and settled for small
gains on the Commodity Exchange in New York.
   The decline in oil prices led to profit-taking in the metals
early in the session, but the continuing fears over the Middle East
gave the market late support, said Stephen W. Platt, an analyst in
Chicago with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``No one was really willing to commit in any big way one way or
another,'' he said.
   Gold settled $2.80 to $3.60 higher with the December contract at
$423.20 a troy ounce; and silver was 6 cents to 7.9 cents higher
with August at $5.187 a troy ounce.

   The stock market rallied and oil prices eased
Friday as the world's battered financial markets staggered into the
weekend optimistic that a Middle East war had been averted _ for
now.
   But the recovery worldwide was based more on a belief that stock
prices had bottomed out and oil prices shot up too rapidly over $31
a barrel than on the latest tense developments in the Iraq-U.S.
standoff.
   ``The fear from the selling has run its course like a fever runs
its course and then breaks,'' said Christopher P. Baker of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in Boston. ``Maybe Monday morning
there will be some more panic, but for the time being it's gone.''
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average rose 49.50 points to
2,532.92, erasing most of a 76-point drop Thursday. But the Dow
average, which measures 30 big industrial company stocks, still
ended the week down 111.88 points.
   Stocks also rebounded in Europe and Japan. But despite the
gains, the crisis spawned by Iraq's takeover of Persian Gulf
neighbor Kuwait has erased hundreds of billions of dollars in the
value of U.S. stocks.
   The price of the main blend of U.S. crude oil fell $1.02 per
barrel to $30.91 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude peaked
Thursday after tying an all-time high during that trading day.
   After Iraq let a deadline pass for Western countries to empty
their embassies in Kuwait, many financial market participants
traded as if the threat of an armed conflict had receded.
   That occurred despite a barrage of accusations by the Bush
administration and the presence of Iraqi troops around the U.S.
embassy in Kuwait City.
   Significantly easing market worries, Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev messaged Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein indicating Moscow
would back Western powers pressing for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait
and free foreign hostages.
   ``The feeling was there might not be any conflict over this,
which was not the case before,'' said James Steel, an oil analyst
with Refco Inc., a commodities trading firm in New York. ``The
psychology turned rather rapidly.''
   Financial markets fear a desert war that could knock out oil
production by world leader Saudi Arabia and drastically reduce
world supplies, making oil scarcer and more expensive. That in turn
would translate to higher inflation and economic instability
worldwide.
   In foreign exchange trading, which is highly sensitive to
political developments, the dollar rebounded against major foreign
currencies after falling in the previous sessions to new lows
against the German mark, Swiss franc and British pound.
   The dollar rose against the yen in New York at 146.75 yen, up
from 146.12 yen on Thursday. The British pound fell to $1.9400,
less expensive than Thursday's $1.9570. Against the mark, the
dollar rose to 1.5575 from 1.5445.
   Bond prices bucked the positive trend, continuing to fall on
concern over hostilities. The government's 30-year bond lost $2.19
per $1,000 in face amount while its yield climbed to 9.15 percent,
highest since April 1989.
   Stock markets worldwide posted gains. Japan's Nikkei Stock
Average rose 428.13 points to 24,165.76, a 1.8 percent rise after
its fourth-largest drop ever Thursday. The Frankfurt market gained
about 38 points, while London's stock exchange closed higher for
the first time in seven trading days.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average soared nearly 40 points in
the first 15 minutes of trading before dropping back until an
afternoon rally fed by Gorbachev's comment and heavy buying by
institutional and individual investors.
   ``The market's very oversold. This is a technical rally,'' said
Manny Geranimos, head of block trading for Shearson Lehman Brothers
Inc.
   The stock market also was calmed by the stabilized dollar, the
foreign market rallies and the oil drop. Still, traders noted the
market remains down more than 460 points since reaching a historic
peak July 17 _ a drop nearly as big as the October 1987 crash.
   ``When we got down 500 in 1987 it was time to buy,'' said James
J. Cramer, a New York money manager, who said he made large stock
purchases Friday. ``Now we're down 500 in '90 and maybe it's time
to buy again.''
   But he added: ``I think we're in a horrible bear market. In all
bear markets there are these moves upwards. Markets don't go down
in a straight line.''

   Persian Gulf paranoia overtook the bond market
Friday, driving down prices and capping one of the worst weeks for
investor confidence since the financial gyrations from the Black
Monday crash three years ago.
   The Treasury's key 30-year issue, a sensitive barometer of
interest rates and the economy, fell 7-32 point or about $2.19 per
$1,000 in face amount, extending its loss for the week to more than
$22.
   Its yield, which rises when the price falls, reached 9.15
percent, the highest since April 12, 1989, and an indicator that
many investors don't want to tie up their money for such long
periods. By contrast many funneled money into 3-month Treasury
bills to minimize the risk created by a possible Mideast war.
   ``Investors were so emotional this week, they really threw away
their good common sense and were hanging on every minute
development from the Middle East,'' said Marshall B. Front,
economist at the Stein Roe &amp; Farnham investment and mutual fund
firm in Chicago.
   ``The bond and stock markets were driven by a level of
emotionalism rarely seen since the stock market crash in 1987,'' he
said. ``Investors in both stocks and bonds were looking at the
worst possible scenarios.''
   Bond strategists said prices strengthened early Friday on
internal market technical influences and the Commerce Department's
gross national product report, which showed the economy grew by
only 1.2 percent in the April-June quarter, less than many
forecasters had envisioned.
   The GNP report suggested serious economic problems confronted
the United States that required the need for lower interest rates,
which tends to boost the value of bond prices.
   But the effect of the statistic quickly faded as investors
refocused attention on rapid developments in the Persian Gulf,
where a showdown loomed between U.S. and Iraqi forces over Iraq's
seizure of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The financial markets have become obsessed with the Persian Gulf
conflict because it has disrupted the flow of oil from the
industrial world's leading source of petroleum. Oil prices have
reached five-year highs as a result, threatening to tip the U.S.
economy into a recession.
   Although oil prices eased and stocks rallied a bit going into
the weekend, investment strategists said there was no trace of
optimism in the bond market.
   ``We did well on the GNP numbers, but then the Middle Eastern
blahs took over from there,'' said Micheal W. Casey, international
economist with Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc. ``People are just
very apprehensive.''
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments 1-16 point, intermediate maturities fell 3-16 to 9-32
point and long-term issues fell 7-32 point, the Telerate Inc., a
financial information service reported.
   The movement of a point equals a $10 change in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.94 to 1,133.39.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.69 percent as the
discount fell 7 basis points to 7.45 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.86 percent as the discount fell 3 basis points to
7.47 percent. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged from
