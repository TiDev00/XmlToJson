<HEAD>Men Sought in Texas Murder Jump to Death From 12th Floor of Hotel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two men wanted for questioning in
the slaying of a university student jumped to their deaths Friday
from the 12th floor of a hotel as police approached, authorities
said.
   Matthew Michael Novatny, 22, and Jason Smith, 19, leaped from
the window as officers tried to enter their room at La Mondrian
Hotel, said police spokesman Fred Nixon.
   Novatny was wanted on charges of killing Tiffani Ann Bruce,
whose body was found Oct. 21 in the bathroom of her home near the
University of Texas in Austin, said Austin police Sgt. Mike Lummus.
   Ms. Bruce was shot twice in the head and once in the chest,
police said. A medical examiner said the 18-year-old was probably
killed Oct. 18 or Oct. 19.
   Novatny and Smith, who were roommates, disappeared after the
killing.
   Acting on a tip from a Texas woman, Los Angeles police officers
went to the hotel and asked the manager to escort them to the room.
   ``As they knocked on the door, they heard moving inside and
asked the manager to let them in,'' Los Angeles County sheriff's
Sgt. Robert Stoneman said. ``They saw an open window, walked over
to it, looked out and saw two people 12 floors down.''
   Novatny may have met Ms. Bruce canvassing the neighborhood for
Clean Water Action, a grassroots environmental organization, said
Terrence Keel, an assistant district attorney in Travis County,
Texas.
   ``It's a very strange case,'' said Keel. ``This may have been
someone infatuated with her and went back and killed her.''
   In Newark, N.J., on Friday a 25-year-old man on trial for murder
leapt to his death from the 11th story of the Essex County
courthouse while eight people watched.
   Jeffrey Lemon, dashed for the window as lawyers interviewed a
prospective juror, authorities said. He was charged last year with
hurling a 14-year-old boy to his death out a 14th-floor apartment
building balcony after arguing with the boy's father.

   Journalists who cover blacks and other minorities
often hold negative preconceptions that are reflected in their
studies, a panelist at the Associated Press Managing Editors
convention said.
   ``When reporters come to me, many times they don't come with an
objective outlook. They come with preconceived notions,'' Rae
Parr-Moore, acting chief of public information and community
affairs for the District of Columbia, said Friday.
   Ms. Parr-Moore, representing Washington Mayor Marion Barry at
the 56th annual convention, said most journalists she deals with
want to photograph black juvenile delinquents or black drug
addicts.
   ``I don't get calls for chances to interview or photograph the
health commissioner,'' Ms. Parr-Moore said. Blacks should be sought
for their opinions on a wide range of topics, including foreign
policy and health, she said.
   Poverty and drug abuse are often unfairly presented as being
``black problems,'' she said.
   Editors also were urged to resist hiring minority reporters only
to cover minority affairs.
   Washington Post reporter Juan Williams said he does not feel
obligated to be the voice of the black community simply because
he's black. In fact, he said he's often criticized by other blacks
who feel he should try to censor negative stories.
   ``I'm aware that the black community wants stories that generate
positive images,'' Williams said. ``But I think silence is a
greater sin than anything any newspaper has written.''
   Williams said newspapers cannot be afraid to cover stories, such
as the federal drug case against Barry, that might upset some
blacks. He said the media should demand accountability from black
elected officials as well as white politicians.
   Many people have criticized federal authorities for a sting
operation that led to Barry's arrest and conviction on a
misdemeanor cocaine possession charge. Some have also labeled as
racist the six-month prison sentence Barry received.
   Dr. Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said Barry is
another example of a government official who overstepped his
authority.
   But Hooks said he, too, felt black elected officials were often
harassed by federal investigators. Blacks compose about 1{ percent
of elected officials. Hooks said, however, that black officials are
the targets of 17 percent of the investigations of public
officials.
   ``There has been a double standard of justice and we need to
examine all of that,'' Hooks said.
   APME is comprised of managing editors and other news executives
of the 1,500 member newspapers of the AP, the world's largest news
gathering organization.
   The four-day convention, which ended Friday, drew 263 editors
from across the nation.

   An apologetic burglar returned a
nearly-blind dog to a family whose home he had burglarized.
   ``It was out of order and totally out of my profession,'' the
burglar said in the note to victims Pam and David Crandall. ``I
definitely can't return your property - materials, that is. But I
can return Taffy, which is something very loved and treasured in
your family.''
   The burglar signed the note ``Respectfully, ... Let's just say,
`Kind-hearted.' ''
   The Crandalls' home was burglarized Monday. Also taken were
stereo equipment, a VCR, jewelry and frozen food.
   A newspaper article about the burglary included the Crandalls'
telephone number, and early Friday a man called and told them their
dog was in a used-car lot. The burglar left the note in a pet
carrier that also had been stolen.
   Mrs. Crandall said Taffy was doing fine - after having her
morning coffee.

<HEAD>RTC Puts Lincoln, 17 Other S&amp;Ls Up for Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, whose
collapse left taxpayers with a record bailout bill of about $2
billion, is among 18 failed thrifts being put up for sale by the
government's Resolution Trust Corp.
   The RTC, which is responsible for disposing of hundreds of
failed S&amp;Ls, said Friday that it is accepting bids from potential
buyers for the 18 institutions. They have a total of $31.8 billion
in assets and $24.3 billion in deposits, the agency said.
   Federal regulators recently proposed a plan to sell or close 192
failed S&amp;Ls, with assets valued at $119 billion, over the next six
months.
   But Congress adjourned last weekend without providing more money
for the cleanup. That failure to act will cost taxpayers millions
or even billions of dollars more to cover insured deposits,
officials and analysts say.
   By the time legislators return in January, the RTC's borrowing
authority could be exhausted. Even then, approval of more money is
far from certain.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision has brought a $40.9 million
civil action against Charles Keating Jr. and five others connected
with American Continental Corp., the former parent of Lincoln S&amp;L.
   Lincoln, based in Irvine, Calif., has assets of $2.7 billion and
deposits of $2.4 billion.
   Keating has been charged in state court in California with 42
counts of fraud. He is free on bail pending the outcome of that
case.
   Separately, the Senate Ethics Committee is investigating whether
five senators improperly intervened with regulators on Keating's
behalf.
   Besides Lincoln, the thrifts put up for sale Friday are:
   -Pima Federal Savings and Loan Association, Tucson, Ariz.
   -Security Savings &amp; Loan Association, Scottsdale, Ariz.
   -Imperial Federal Savings Association, San Diego, Calif.
   -Commonwealth Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association, Fort

   A package bomb exploded early today
in the doorway of a police residence, injuring two people,
including a 7-year-old girl, Spanish National Radio said.
   The bomb went off about 2 a.m. in a three-story residence of
policemen and their families in this northern Spanish Basque town,
the radio said.
   The radio said there could be more people injured in the rubble
of the building. There were no other details available immediately.
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the bomb, but the
radio said it could be the work of the Basque separatist group ETA.
   ETA, which stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque
language, has claimed responsibility for more than 600 violent
deaths since 1968, including 15 this year. The group wants
independence for the three-province Basque country.

<HEAD>Consumers Warned of Unauthorized Changes in Long-Distance Service</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Consumers may file complaints with: Kathie A.
Kneff, Enforcement Division, Common Carrier Bureau, Federal
Communications Commission, 2025 M St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20554.
   ---
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Federal Communications Commission is
warning consumers to beware of clever salespeople who try to switch
their long-distance telephone service without permission.
   ``Unauthorized switching sometimes happens as a result of unfair
sales tactics,'' the FCC said in a statement Friday. It noted that
some long-distance companies hire sales groups known as
telemarketers to sell their services over the phone.
   ``The telemarketers can provide you with useful information
about special promotions and reduced rates. Telemarketers may also
misinterpret any agreement on your part to let them send you
information about their company to mean that you are ordering their
service,'' the FCC said.
   ``No one has the right to switch you to a company you don't
want,'' the commission added. People who do get changed can switch
back or to another company. Consumers who agreed to the first
switch must pay a small charge. Those who didn't agree don't have
to pay.
   ``However, you must pay for any long-distance calls you made
using the unauthorized long-distance service,'' the FCC said.
   State and federal authorities and local phone companies have
received tens thousands of complaints about unauthorized switching,
particularly in the wake of recent advertising wars among American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, MCI Communications and US Sprint.
   An AT&amp;T official told a congressional hearing last month that
90,000 of the company's customers had been switched to another
long-distance service against their will in the past six months.
Most complaints have been against MCI, but the other companies have
been accused as well.
   AT&amp;T has sued MCI and its telemarketing agent. MCI said honest
mistakes can be made.
   The FCC urged consumers to make sure a telemarketing agent knows
they don't want to change service. It also suggested they watch out
for letters thanking them for choosing ``XYZ'' phone company -
they've already been switched - and to inspect monthly phone bills
for any changes in service.
   Consumers should notify the new long-distance company
immediately if they did not order the service and should also tell
their local phone companies.

   President Bush didn't make any bones about it
- sometimes you try to buy votes, even if only for the price of a
cup of coffee.
   Bush stopped by a local coffee shop after a campaign appearance
here Friday for Republican House contender J. Kenneth Blackwell.
   To the astonishment of the patrons at Frisch's Big Boy, the
president and Blackwell worked the booths, shaking hands and saying
hello.
   Then they took seats at the counter, Bush pulled some bills from
his pocket and ordered coffee all around.
   ``Trying to buy votes?'' a reporter asked.
   ``You're darn right, that's what this is all about,'' the
president replied with a laugh.
   It also turned out to be celebrity day at Frisch's.
   Two burly young men approached the president for autographs, and
one began to explain, ``Typically we're asked for autographs, but
....''
   Bush looked up to see two of this city's better-known residents
- Jim Breech and Lee Johnson of the Cincinnati Bengals football
team.
   One of the guys at the counter, truckdriver Lee Smith, was happy
to sit next to candidate Blackwell.
   ``I'm voting for Blackwell because he voted against gun
control,'' Smith said.
   By the time the president's entourage left, everyone was in a
jolly mood. Even White House chief of staff John Sununu, not
usually given to frivolity, was gamely snapping a photograph of a
woman who wanted her picture with Bush.

   Bush's next campaign stop was in Rochester, Minn., at a high
school set amid rolling hills and wide expanses of grain fields.
The John Marshall High students were pumped up, the gymnasium was
rocking and an American flag as big as the side of a barn was
stretched behind the stage.
   It seemed a bit odd to have Mr. Las Vegas in the midst of all of
this.
   But there he was. And Wayne Newton gave a Vegas-style rendition
of ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' to welcome Bush.
   Newton was dressed down for the Rochester crowd, in a dark suit
instead of his glitzy stage togs. But he did show a touch of flair
- with a black tie that was red at the knot.
   Nobody seemed to know exactly what else Newton was doing in
Rochester, but Bush thanked him as ``a friend of longstanding who
flew all the way from Las Vegas here for this, and now back
tonight.''
   Some of the high schoolers who professed to have knowledge of
advance planning for the event said that an invitation to rock star
Prince was seriously weighed. They did not know how Newton was
chosen instead.

<TEXT>
   The city's finances are a shambles and its
drug problems seemingly insurmountable.
   But the District of Columbia is preparing to put the era of
Marion Barry behind it by electing a new mayor.
   The race features political novice Sharon Pratt Dixon, a former
vice president and attorney with the Potomac Electric Power Co.,
and onetime city Police Chief Maurice Turner.
   Turner, a Republican, is running in a city where Democrats
outnumber Republicans by a 9-to-1 margin. Dixon holds a commanding
lead in the polls and she regards the job of mayor as ``a great
opportunity to turn the city around.''
   There are ``problems - serious ones - but I've never been one to
turn away from an opportunity to make things better,'' she said.
   Dixon upset four experienced politicians in the Democratic
primary. She pledged to root out waste and fraud in district
government. That was just the right message for an electorate that
spent the summer watching Barry's drug and perjury trial. He was
convicted of one count of cocaine possession and sentenced to six
months in jail.
   Turner has sought to improve his slim chance for victory by
pounding away at Dixon's relative political inexperience.
   Stressing his 32-year police career, Turner has accused Dixon of
being soft on crime. He's also called her cruel and insensitive for
promising to immediately drop 2,000 workers from the city payroll
to cut costs.
   ``You don't correct the ills of a government run by Democrats by
coming down on the worker,'' Turner said. ``I have a lot more
managerial experience, and I know there are better ways to cut
expenses.''
   The Republican nominee proposes eliminating 6,000 people from a
48,000-person work force through attrition.
   Dixon describes Turner as a ``born-again Republican,''
criticizing him for his GOP conversion last year.
   But as the campaign neared its end, political observers expected
Dixon to coast to victory.
   ``I think the only chance Turner had to win was if he was
running against Barry, because then he could have been running
against crime and corruption,'' said Ron Richardson, a local labor
leader and political activist.
   ``But Sharon is perceived as a clean government candidate ...
and that has really left him with no issues,'' Richardson said.
   Barry announced before he was convicted of misdemeanor cocaine
possession that he would not seek a fourth, four-year term. He is
running instead for a City Council seat.
   He was sentenced Oct. 26 to six months in prison, fined $5,000
and placed on one year's probation.
   If she wins Barry's job, Dixon's first challenge will be to get
the city's fiscal house in order. The district ran a deficit of
$100 million for the year that ended Sept. 30, and the deficit
could be at least as high this year.
   Budget officials predict Dixon could have difficulty meeting the
city payroll in January or February, which are traditionally
low-revenue months.
   The city also appears well on its way to a new annual murder
rate.
   A total of 382 people had died on city streets through Oct. 29.
There were 438 murders in 1989, and police blame more than 60
percent of the killings on drugs, particularly turf battles among
crack dealers.
   And the city is haunted by an infant mortality rate higher than
that of many impoverished nations, a public school system that
traditionally ranks among the worst in the country and a chronic
jail crowding problem.
   ``We've got to reinvest in this city, every part of it,'' said
Dixon, who has pledged to extend economic opportunities to the
city's poorest neighborhoods. ``If we can do that, we can begin to
see some progress in other areas.''

<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Craig James eked out a
congressional victory two years ago by taking advantage of a
defense procurement scandal that engulfed his opponent, 10-term
incumbent Bill Chappell.
   Now James is in trouble, faced with a strong challenge from
Democrat Reid Hughes in one of Florida's nastiest congressional
campaigns.
   One of Hughes' campaign themes: James' acceptance of money from
political action committees, the same issue that James used against
Chappell in 1988.
   ``He's (James) being financed by PAC money which he campaigned
against two years ago as unethical,'' Hughes charged.
   There is ``nothing inappropriate about it,'' replied James. ``It
is legal. I never said I wouldn't take PAC money.''
   And James has criticized Hughes, a millionaire, for spending so
much of his own money for the campaign - $622,100 to date.
   ``He said he wouldn't'' spend his own money ``and he did,'' said
James. ``I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't spend $1 million for
the campaign.''
   Hughes replied that a great deal of the money in his election
effort ``is coming from small people. This is a citizens' campaign
versus a special-interest campaign.''
   The two have clashed over abortion and their environmental
records.
   James threatened to file a libel suit over one Hughes ad.
   Both defend their negative campaign ads, saying they merely
point out their opponent's record.
   ``In our case, we had to attack his very negative record,'' said
Hughes. ``He is an extremist, not just on his voting record, but
for his off-the-wall, nutty statements.''
   ``Negative campaigning I don't mind as long as it is truthful,''
James said. ``We felt it especially important to point out he
clais to be an environmentalist and he is not. We felt it was
necessary to bring out facts not flattering to Mr. Hughes.''
   While Hughes is pro-choice on abortion, James opposes abortion,
except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother.
James said he's been misrepresented in Hughes ads on his position.
   Hughes' ads say: ``He (James) said that pregnant women are too
confused to make their own decisions whether or not to have an
abortion.''
   But James said he merely said that pregnancy is a confusing time
for women.
   Hughes is chairman of The Nature Conservancy, which purchases
land to prevent it from being developed. He has been attacked by
James in ads about leaking gasoline tanks at stations owned by
Hughes Oil Co., which Hughes sold three years ago.
   James' ads say: ``Hughes had to pay a million-dollar settlement
after his string of gas stations leaked gasoline into our drinking
water.''
   ``There is no record, nor reality, of any state, federal, local
government or city fining me,'' Hughes said. ``It is a lie what he
is saying. It's a scare tactic by a desperate opponent.''
   Hughes did pay $1.3 million to the buyers of gas station
properties after leaking tanks were discovered. But there is no
evidence that the tanks polluted drinking water.
   Both candidates were not pleased with the budget compromise
worked out in Congress and say it hurts middle-income, poor and
elderly Floridians.
   Whatever the outcome of Tuesday's election, the results can't be
much closer than when James, a virtually unknown Republican,
defeated Chappell by 791 votes out of 250,000 cast.
   ``I think it will be close, but I hope it's not that close,''
James said.
   Each candidate says he is leading in a close race.

   For most Texas voters, it's been the year of
living dangerously close to the television set.
   In the race for governor, Texans have been bombarded with poll
results, slipups and million-dollar mudslinging during what some
say is the nastiest gubernatorial race in recent memory.
   Enough already, said public TV station KERA, which turned its
airwaves over to viewers this week for a show called ``Voters'
Revenge.''
   It featured the best of 18 homemade video parodies and skits of
the gubernatorial race between Democrat Ann Richards and Republican
Clayton Williams.
   One imitated Williams during a campaign ad. ``Yes folks, I plan
to service Texas,'' said the video. It referred to Williams'
admission that he was ``serviced by prostitutes'' as a young man.
   One segment featured a Dallas disc jockey playing a sleazy talk
show host and interviewing the two ``candidates from hell.'' A much
younger looking ``Sat-Ann Richards, capped in a large curly white
wig, told voters she once dated Elvis.

   An endorsement letter sent to 50,000
Jewish voters was written by a controversial rabbi using a
different name, a Republican congressional candidate has
acknowledged.
   Scott Shore faced a jeering political crowd when he confirmed
the endorsement was written by former Boca Raton Rabbi Mordechai
Winyarz. Winyarz was once censured by the local rabbinical
association for inappropriate behavior, but the censure was later
withdrawn.
   The letter was signed by Rabbi Marc Gafni, a name Winyarz said
he adopted when he moved to Israel two years ago.
   It also was addressed to ``my fellow Democrats,'' even though
Gafni's last registration was as a Republican.
   Shore refused demands from the audience at Temple Beth El that
he apologize for the letter.
   The audience of more than 250, including many supporters of the
incumbent Democratic U.S. Rep. Harry Johnston, hooted when Shore
claimed he wasn't trying to deceive voters about Winyarz's true

   Sen. Bob Kerrey says he hopes that talk of
invading Kuwait is nothing more than political rhetoric by
President Bush.
   Bush ``doesn't want to talk about the budget or other domestic
issues because they are tough issues and they are not winning
political issues at this time,'' Kerrey said Friday.
   Military action is not needed, said Kerrey, who won the Medal of
Honor for his service during the Vietnam war.
   ``To plunge unilaterally into military action is a terrible and
tragic mistake. It should not be done,'' the Nebraska Democrat
said.
   He said it is wrong to view the Middle East crisis as a conflict
between Iraq and the United States.
   ``If the president makes the mistake of getting Americans all
fired up because of the treatment of American hostages, it then
becomes an issue between (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein and the
United States, which almost has to be treated with a military
effort,'' Kerrey said.
   Kerrey made his comments to Hastings radio station KICS in a

<HEAD>Poll: Voters Support Marijuana Ban By Nearly 2-1 Margin</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A statewide poll shows voters
supporting the ballot measure to recriminalize marijuana by a
nearly 2-1 margin.
   Measure 2 on Tuesday's ballot would make possession of small
amounts of pot in private a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days
in jail and a $1,000 fine. State law for 15 years has allowed
possession of less than 4 ounces of marijuana in private.
   The poll, commissioned by the Anchorage Daily News and Anchorage
radio station KENI, showed 60 percent of those surveyed favored the
measure and 31 percent were opposed. Nine percent were undecided.
The survey has an error margin of plus or minus 5 percentage

   The state's new voter registration-by-mail
program is highly successful, but television ads promoting it have
generated some controversy.
   A soap opera-style commercial features a couple in bed.
   ``Tim, wait,'' the woman says in a come-hither voice. ``Before
we go any further, I have to ask. Are you ... registered to vote?''
   The ad drew objections from Republican state Rep. Michael Liu,
who is running for Congress.
   Lt. Gov. Ben Cayetano, the state's chief elections officer,
defended the commercial as a humorous attempt to reach potential
voters.
   Some 453,000 people are registered to vote in the general
election, up 2 percent from 443,000 in 1988. Some 436,000 were
registered for the primary, up 4 percent from 419,000 in 1988,
Cayetano said.

<TEXT>
   German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher met with his Czechoslovak counterpart Jiri
Dienstbier on a new bilateral treaty to replace historic mutual
animosity with cooperation.
   It was widely believed that Friday's talks centered mainly on
claims of Sudeten Germans whose property was nationalized after
their expulsion from Czechoslovakia at the end of World War II.
   But both ministers avoided reporters' questions on the issue.
   Dienstbier told reporters after the meeting that the treaty will
expand a 17-year-old agreement that normalized relations between
Czechoslovakia and then-West Germany.
   More than two million Germans were expelled from Czechoslovakia
after 1945. Their property was seized by the state in retaliation
for Nazi Germany's annexation of the Sudetenland in 1938 and its
occupation of the whole country a year later.
   Genscher also met with the Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel
and Premier Marian Calfa.

   Actor and playwright Jason Miller, nominated
for an Academy Award for his portrayal of a priest in ``The
Exorcist,'' faces several charges stemming from a disturbance
aboard an airliner.
   Miller, 51, was arrested two weeks ago at Greater Pittsburgh
International Airport along with traveling companion Ronald
Dushney, 43, after a USAir flight from South Bend, Ind.
   Miller was charged with disorderly conduct, possession of a
small amount of marijuana, public intoxication and terroristic
threats.
   Allegheny County police said the men punched seats on plane and
that officers found a bag of marijuana in Miller's luggage. Miller
was released after posting $300 bond and faces a hearing Nov. 20.
   Miller, of Scranton, won a Pulitzer Prize for the play ``That

   Construction on the first bridge across
the Mekong River linking Thailand and Laos will start next year,
the Thai government says.
   Commerce between the two countries is currently conducted mostly
by boats crossing the river. Laos is among the poorest and most
isolated countries in Asia.
   The new bridge, to be built with the help of Australia, will
link the Thai province of Nong Khai and a point near the Laotian
capital of Vientiane, the government in Bangkok said Friday.
   A press release from the prime minister's office said the bridge
was one of several issues discussed during a one-day visit to Laos
by Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan.
   Following the communist victory in Laos in 1975, relations
between the two countries were generally poor and there were
occasionally clashes along the border. Chatichai has pursued a
policy of rapprochement in recent years and business ties have
increased.

<HEAD>Saudi Arabia Denounces Amnesty Report On Yemeni Tortures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is objecting to
findings by Amnesty International that Saudi security forces have
tortured and mistreated hundreds of Yemeni guest workers because of
the neighboring country's pro-Iraq position.
   ``We would have wished to see Amnesty International checking out
the facts before directing charges to the kingdom of Saudi
Arabia,'' said a government statement Friday attributed to a
``responsible government source'' and distributed by the official
Saudi Press Agency.
   London-based Amnesty reported Thursday that Yemenis were being
rounded up, expelled and ill-treated ``for no apparent reason other
than their nationality or their suspected opposition to the Saudi
Arabian government's position in the gulf crisis.''
   The human rights group claimed to have interviewed Yemenis who
had torture marks, including a man beaten so badly he had to be
hospitalized. It called on King Fahd to hold an immediate public
inquiry.
   About 750,000 out of some 2 million Yemeni workers in the
kingdom have left since Riyadh announced Sept. 18 it was annulling
their residence and work privileges. The decision was in apparent
retaliation for Yemeni support of Iraq in the gulf crisis.
   Saudi Arabia initially offered Yemenis a month to find a Saudi
sponsor, but the deadline has been extended, in line with the rules
for all other expatriate workers.
   The Saudi statement said ``hundreds of thousands of Yemenis are
pursuing their activities in the kingdom, supported by all Saudi
care, after having adjusted their status.''
   Those who left after the new ruling, ``have done so of their own
free will and have taken with them all that they made of money and
possessions,'' it said.
   The statement said Amnesty had probably contacted ``the more
than 70,000 Yemenis who were expelled from Kuwait and Iraq and
crossed through the kingdom to Yemen, with nothing for a cover on
their bodies and who found all care with the Saudi authorities.''
   ``Perhaps it is these that the Yemeni authorities, seeking to
harm us, presented to Amnesty International,'' the statement said.

   The country's largest publisher has
shut down its entertainment magazine, fearing new Moslem protests
after the magazine ran a picture depicting prophet Mohammed, a
company official said today.
   Islam prohibits any rendition of the prophet.
   The magazine ``Senang'' was ordered closed Friday by Kompas
Gramedia chief executive Jacob Utama, who called it a blunder to
run the picture.
   The picture depicts a young man meeting the prophet in a dream.
   A company official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Utama wanted to ``avert the wrath of the Moslem community,'' which
makes up about 90 percent of the country's 180 million population.
   The government banned the company's weekly tabloid Monitor late
last month after thousands of Moslems protested publication of a
poll comparing Mohammed with other famous figures.
   Kompas Gramedia, which also controls the country's largest
newspaper Kompas, is owned by a group of Catholic publishers.

<HEAD>New Poll Shows Gantt Leading Helms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new poll showed Democrat Harvey Gantt
narrowly leading Republican incumbent Jesse Helms in Tuesday's
election for U.S. Senate.
   Among 703 likely voters surveyed in the Charlotte
Observer-WSOC-TV poll released Friday, 47 percent supported Gantt
and 41 percent favored Helms. The remainder were undecided. The
margin of error was 3.7 percentage points.
   An Observer-WSOC-TV poll two weeks ago showed Gantt up 49
percent to 41 percent.
   The new survey was conducted from Sunday through Thursday by The
Charlotte Observer's market research division.
   The survey is the latest of sometimes conflicting surveys.
   For example, a Mason-Dixon Poll released Thursday showed Gantt
leading 48 percent to Helms' 44 percent. But a survey released
Thursday by The News and Observer of Raleigh showed Helms ahead 44
percent to Gantt's 40 percent.
   Both candidates said Friday they aren't paying attention to the
polls.
   Also Friday, a national leader of a Ku Klux Klan group, asked to
explain his organization's ``endorsement'' of Gantt, made it clear
it was intended as a slam against the black candidate.
   ``If they elect him, they'll find out we've got another crooked
black politician,'' Imperial Wizard J.W. Farrands said in a
telephone interview.
   Farrands heads the Invisible Empire of the Knights of the Ku
Klux Klan, one of many klan groups. A state leader of the group had
sent a letter to news organizations announcing its ``endorsement''
f Gantt on Wednesday.
   Gantt's campaign would not comment on Farrand's statements.
   Gantt, the first black mayor of Charlotte, has accused Helms of
trying to make race an issue in the campaign through television
advertisements that discuss hiring quotas for minorities. Helms has
defended the spots as raising legitimate issues about hiring quotas
and Gantt's background.

<HEAD>Housing Guarantees for Israel Reported Set</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American team plans to leave for Israel
soon to finalize transfer of $400 million in guarantees to finance
housing for a tide of Soviet Jews flowing into the country,
officials say.
   The decision to send the team, disclosed Friday by Israeli
Ambassador Zalman Shoval after a meeting with Secretary of State
James A. Baker, ends a dispute that contributed to strained
relations between the two countries.
   Americans have been calling on Israel to refrain from using the
U.S. guarantees to build houses in the predominantly Arab, eastern
part of Jerusalem, which was captured from Jordan in the 1967
Mideast War.
   Shoval said Israel would not use U.S. guarantees to build homes
in the eastern part of Jerusalem but would use its own money to
build wherever it wanted. ``There are no two cities of Jerusalem,
just as there are no two cities of Berlin,'' he said.
   Israel's Arab neighbors are incensed at the growing number of
Jewish homes being built in what they regard as occupied territory.
   The Bush administration has questioned several times recently
Israel's right to the eastern part of the city - an explosive issue
that the Reagan administration had refrained from raising.
   The question arose this year partly as a result of the large
influx of Soviet Jews under the newly liberalized emigration
policies of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.

   Concern in Congress that Pakistan may be
trying to get nuclear weapons has brought a promise from the Bush
administration to take up the issue with that country's new
government.
   ``We expect to engage the new Pakistani government early on in
discussion of these issues,'' Assistant Secretary of State John
Kelly said Friday.
   He told a House panel military aid to Pakistan has been
suspended in compliance with a law requiring such a cutoff unless
the administration can certify that the Asian nation does not
possess nuclear weapons.
   The United States had planned $564 million in military aid for
Pakistan in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.
   Chairman Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., opened the hearing of the
Asia-Pacific subcommittee with a warning that ``neither the
administration nor Congress is prepared to turn a blind eye toward
mounting evidence that Pakistan persists in its pursuit of nuclear
weaponry.''
   Unless the new government takes steps to prove that it does not
have those arms, ``American law is quite clear, no further U.S.
assistance can flow to Pakistan,'' Solarz added.

<HEAD>Court Rules Government Erred on Nuclear Licensing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal court says the federal regulators
went too far in trying to streamline licensing of future atomic
power plants.
   In its decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia handed a victory to anti-nuclear groups that said the plan
would muzzle public opinion on licensing of plants.
   The three-judge panel was critical of a Nuclear Regulatory
Commission plan to allow operators to get both a construction and
operating permit in a single proceeding violated the law.
   The court said the ``one step'' plan would violate federal law.
   The NRC issued its new licensing regulations last year as part
of an attempt to simplify the licensing process and reduce
uncertainties and delays. The action immediately was challenged in
court by the Nuclear Information and Resource Service and the Union
of Concerned Scientists.
   ``It's disappointing,'' said NRC spokesman Joe Fouchard. ``We've
attempted to craft a rule which provides for early decision
making.''
   The court did uphold some parts of the plan. But it said the
commission must hold a second round of hearings, after construction
is complete, before an operating permit can be issued.

<HEAD>Havel's Civic Forum Shaken by Political Divisions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ONDREJ HEJMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only 10 months after the Velvet
Revolution ousted the Communists and swept Civic Forum to power,
the movement founded by President Vaclav Havel is in crisis over
the speed of reform.
   Cracks began to appear in the broad political movement earlier
this month when Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus, a radical
free-market reformer, was elected Civic Forum chairman over Martin
Palous.
   Palous was backed by the organization's Prague leadership and by
Havel, who favors slower, gentler reform that will be less of a
shock to the population.
   Klaus' victory Oct. 13 was seen as a dramatic shift to the right
and it triggered an identity crisis in Civic Forum, founded on a
civic rights platform and popularly associated with Havel's
liberal, humanistic philosophy.
   On Thursday, Obroda, a group of left-wing intellectuals and
Marxist reformers, quit Civic Forum to protest the forum executive
council's decision to expel another group of non-communist
leftists, the Left Alternative.
   The changes are reminiscent of the splintering of Poland's
Solidarity, which was unified in its opposition to communist rule
but since gaining power has divided into factions led by Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and the more conservative Lech Walesa.
   In a recent interview with the leading Lidove Noviny newspaper,
Klaus suggested that Civic Forum's splintering might be inevitable.
   He said the idea of citizens' groups forming the basis for
politics ``is as impracticable to me as the idea of a centrally
planned economy.''
   Obroda and Left Alternative, headed by former dissident Petr
Uhl, issued a joint statement that called the expulsion
``illegitimate, undemocratic ... and an outrage.''
   ``It's over, there is no way to go on like this,'' one of the
executive council's 15 members said Thursday, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``When people excommunicate their political rivals
without hearing the other side ... there is very little to talk
about.''
   More conservative forum members say the rightward shift is a
natural political development as Czechoslovakia starts grappling
with social and economic woes left by communism.
   ``After we have finally defeated the communists in free
elections the question was no longer what we were against, but what
we were for,'' said said Daniel Kroupa, a parliamentary deputy and
leader of the forum's right-wing faction.
   Klaus wants radical reform in the inefficient economy, which
most people say will bring higher prices and unemployment to the
country's 15.5 million people. Havel favors a more careful course.
   Popular support for Civic Forum during the popular revolution of
last November-December, and its subsequent triumph in June
elections, swept many of the group's veteran dissidents into high
political office.
   Leaders such as Havel, Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier and
Czech Premier Petr Pithart were too busy with state affairs for the
most part to concern themselves with Civic Forum debates, and it
drifted to the right.
   Klaus, although always considered a committed anti-communist,
was never seen as a dissident.
   Conservative forum deputies have founded the Interparliamentary
Club of the Democratic Right, grouping 42 of the movement's 116
deputies in the 300-seat bicameral parliament.
   Thirty-six mostly left-wing forum deputies formed the
Interparliamentary Civic Society.
   In a race to lead the Civic Forum delegation in parliament,
Kroupa won 57 votes, edging out leftist Petr Kucera with 46. Since
neither secured the 59 votes needed to clinch the leadership, a
compromise candidate is being sought.
   Civic Forum's smaller counterpart in the Slovak republic, Public
Against Violence, has been under attack in recent months, but has
had no major internal conflicts.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Contends Global Warming May Be Linked to Flatulent Cattle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inside the Interior Department, they refer
to it as ``the cow pie case.'' And frankly, they think it stinks.
   But if the agency loses a case that a federal judge has ordered
to trial, it soon may have to determine whether flatulent sheep,
cattle and buffalo are contributing to global warming.
   The Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends filed a
lawsuit last year accusing the federal Agriculture, Interior and
Energy departments of failing to measure how much flatulent
livestock are contributing to global warming by pumping methane gas
into the atmosphere.
   ``It is basically known as the cow pie case,'' said the Interior
Department's top lawyer, Tom Sansonetti.
   Sansonetti is taking the fragrant fracas seriously, especially
after losing an early round in court. He has assigned a lawyer to
the case full-time.
   ``We filed a motion to dismiss ... and we lost. It's going to go
to full trial on this issue,'' he told the Wyoming Stock Growers
Association and Wyoming Wool Growers Association on Friday. ``I
couldn't believe it.''
   The foundation alleges that flatulent livestock could be
producing up to 15 percent of atmospheric methane, believed by some
scientists to be a contributing factor to global warming.
   Scientists believe global warming, also known as the greenhouse
effect, occurs when the layer of carbon dioxide and other gases
accumulating above the Earth prevents the atmosphere from cooling.
Scientists say it can lead to potentially catastrophic climate
changes that can cause polar ice melting, a rise in the world's
oceans and drought conditions.
   If the foundation's lawsuit is successful, Sansonetti said the
Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management would have to
determine how much methane is generated by livestock grazing on
public lands.
   His office has until Nov. 15 to file an answer to the lawsuit
arguing why such a study shouldn't be conducted.
   If a study is undertaken and it finds that the animals are
indeed releasing too much methane, Sansonetti said farmers might be
asked to ``produce less windy cattle.''
   One way to do that, he said in an interview, would be to change
the animals' feed.
   Another alternative would be to reduce the number of animals
allowed to graze on public land.

<HEAD>Governing Party Wins Mayoral Elections; Opposition Claims Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MONTERREY, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing party has won 36 of 38
races in northern Coahuila state mayoral elections, which
opposition parties have challenged with claims of widespread fraud.
   The elections, which were held Sunday, touched off several
protests this week. Governing party supporters temporarily blocked
the international bridge between Ciudad Acuna and Del Rio, Texas,
on Wednesday night.
   In the official results announced Friday, the Coahuila state's
election commission said governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI, had won in all cities except the state capital,
Saltillo, and Ciudad Acuna. Only 25 percent of eligible voters cast
ballots, it said.
   The conservative National Action Party was declared the winner
in Saltillo. The leftist Cardenista Front of National
Reconstruction was named the victor in Ciudad Acuna.
   The PRI previously held all 38 mayoralties.
   The elections were the first since the PRI announced political
reform last month. Sunday's voting was considered a preview of
elections later this month in Mexico state and 1991 mid-term
congressional elections.
   Several opposition groups have challenged Sunday's election
results in 14 municipalities because of what they claim was
large-scale fraud. The PRI also claimed opposition fraud,
challenging the results in the two cities where it lost.
   The state electoral tribunal has 15 days to decide whether the
protests are valid. If it finds they are, the state congress
decides whether to call new polls.
   Opposition parties claim that many registered voters were not
allowed to cast ballots because their names had been erased from
the voter rolls. They say some PRI members were listed more than
once at different voting booths, allowing the party to conduct a
``carousel'' in which sympathizers voted in several polling places.
   They also claim the PRI bought votes in many cities with money
or goods.
   The PRI made similar charges against the opposition. It has
filed challenges to results in Saltillo and Ciudad Acuna, according
to election officials.
   In a protest this week over the elections, members of the
Democratic Revolutionary Party marched in Torreon and destroyed two
cars.
   In another demonstration, about 100 members of the Authentic
Party of the Mexican Revolution briefly occupied the municipal
palace in Ramos Arizpe.
   The PRI has remained in power since itsfoundation in 1929 in
part by suppressing or buying off the opposition, stuffing ballot
boxes, and rigging election results.
   However, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has been pushing
political reform as well as economic modernization. He took office
in 1988 after winning little more than 50 percent of the vote, the
smallest percentage in the party's history.

   Joe Bills Reynolds' wife, Sharon, 43, died during a four-hour
operation Sept. 7, 1989. The liposuction left her with a
two-foot-long wound and drained most of the blood from her body,
medical witnesses testified during a preliminary hearing.
   The witnesses criticized Reynolds, 54, for performing the
procedure outside a hospital and for allegedly using untrained
office workers to deliver anesthesia and assist in the surgery.
   After seven days of testimony, Oklahoma County Judge Clinton
Dennis on Friday ordered the case to trial.
   Reynolds has pleaded innocent. His lawyers allege he is being
persecuted because he is unpopular with some doctors.
   ``People die every day in surgical procedures and they're never
prosecuted. I think that fact speaks for itself,'' defense lawyer
Garvin Isaacs has said.
   Reynolds, whose license has been suspended, has pleaded innocent
to the murder charge. He remains free on a $25,000 bond.

   Champion Garry Kasparov and challenger Anatoly
Karpov remained tied in the world chess championship after a draw
in the 10th game.
   Kasparov offered the draw after his 18th move Friday and Karpov
agreed, bringing the match score to 5-5.
   The game lasted three hours and 12 minutes, by far the shortest
game in the match.
   ``Personally I think both players were happy with a little break
after the last three games, which were really disastrous in that
both players made blunders,'' said international master Alex
Fishbein.
   Kasparov and Karpov each have a victory and have played eight
draws. A victory is worth a point, a draw a half-point. The first
player to gain 12{ points wins the championship and $1.7 million of
a $3 million purse.
   The first 12 games are being played in New York, and the
remainder will be in Lyons, France. The 11th game is scheduled for
Monday.

<HEAD>Arts Council Backs Two Controversial Grants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Endowment for the Arts advisory
council is recommending grants for two controversial stage
performers who figured in the dispute over anti-obscenity rules
Congress sought to impose on the agency.
   ``I will make my decision as quickly as possible,'' NEA Chairman
John E. Frohnmayer said Friday after the vote to provide grants to
two avant-garde New York theaters for performances by Karen Finley
and Holly Hughes.
   The council's recommendation is advisory. The final decision
rests with Frohnmayer.
   Grant applications submitted previously by Miss Finley and Miss
Hughes as well as fellow performers John Fleck and Tim Miller of
Los Angeles were rejected by Frohnmayer. He said their work would
not ``enhance public understanding and appreciation of the arts.''
   The four performers sued Frohnmayer and the endowment in federal
court in Los Angeles. They charged their free-speech rights had
been violated because funds were denied on political rather than
artistic grounds.
   Frohnmayer was under pressure from conservative lawmakers to
halt federal support for what they consider obscene and blasphemous
artistic projects. Some critics have cited the NEA's previous
grants to Miss Finley and Miss Hughes as evidence of a willingness
to support objectionable works.
   Performance artists stage monologues and musical acts that
frequently deal with feminism, racism, political issues and
homosexual concerns, sometimes in sexually explicit terms.
   The new grant applications are for performances by Miss Finley
at the Kitchen Theater and Miss Hughes at the Downtown Art Company,
both of New York. They had been unanimously approved by an NEA
``peer panel'' of outside artists and arts managers.
   The council deferred action last August on five grant requests,
including those from Finley and Hughes, citing a possible conflict
of interest involving artistic collaborators who served on the peer
panel.
   Later, a fresh panel was formed. It also approved the five
grants. The amounts were not disclosed, but Kitchen Theater
executive director Barbara Tsumagari said her request totaled
$25,000.
   ``It's definitely not over until John Frohnmayer makes the final
decision,'' Miss Finley said after the council vote.
   Before adjourning last weekend, Congress approved a $174 million
NEA budget that scrapped an explicit obscenity ban, effective Oct.
1. The measure must be signed by President Bush before it becomes
law.
   The ban was imposed a year ago at the urging of Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., and his allies who expressed outrage at endowment
support for exhibitions of controversial works by the late
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano.
   Last weekend, Congress voted to repeal the ban and instead to
penalize NEA grant recipients whose works are later ruled obscene
by the courts. The measure provides only that obscenity ``shall not
be funded'' and that grant decisions must take into account
``general standards of decency'' and respect for the public beliefs
and values.
   Council member Nina Brock, a former member of the Tennessee Arts
Commission and a Chattanooga arts patron, abstained on the
council's voice vote Friday. She earlier had questioned whether
Miss Hughes' work met endowment standards for artistic excellence.

   The Iraqi Foreign Ministry on Friday called Western governments
``inhumane'' for urging hostage families to ignore Baghdad's
invitation to visit Iraq for holiday reunions.

   Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone left today for
Baghdad to seek release of captives from his country, and three
Irish parliamentarians traveled to Iraq on Friday to try to win the
release of that nation's people. The Iraqi government has allowed
reporters to visit some captives being used as so-called human

the ousted Kuwaiti government, Egypt, Turkey, Britain and France.
   ---
   A French Defense Ministry spokesman said disciplinary action was
being taken against the three soldiers for their ``act of
carelessness,'' after they were captured in Iraqi territory. A
ministry communique said the soldiers were captured on a patrol
Monday near the Saudi Arabia-Iraq border. The three were turned
over to the French Embassy in Baghdad later in the week.

   The government of Saudi Arabia is objecting to findings by
Amnesty International that Saudi security forces tortured or
mistreated hundreds of Yemeni guest workers because of the
neighboring country's alleged pro-Iraqi position. The human rights
group claimed to have interviewed Yemenis who had torture marks,
including a man beaten so badly he had to be hospitalized.

<HEAD>Requiem for a Bridge: Galloping Gertie's Collapse 50 Years Ago
Recalled</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fifty years ago, they ran away from
``Galloping Gertie'' when the Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapsed in
the worst bridge failure in history.
   On Sunday, they'll mark the anniversary by running toward - and
on - the suspension span's successor.
   On Nov. 7, 1940, the mile-long bridge linking Tacoma and the
Kitsap Peninsula fell into Puget Sound. The 4-month-old bridge,
which got its nickname from its instability in high winds, had
twisted and buckled for an hour in a gale. Then its 2,800-foot
center span crashed into the water 190 feet below.
   The only fatality was a cocker spaniel too frightened to leave
the bridge.
   Tacoma wouldn't get a replacement span for another 10 years. But
it was worth the wait, state officials say - the new one hasn't
developed any serious problems.
   ``It's really in excellent shape,'' said Bob George, state
bridge management engineer.
   The successor bridge will be the site of a 10-kilometer
footrace, a three-mile walk and an antique car parade Sunday as
Tacoma commemorates Galloping Gertie's collapse.
   The first Narrows Bridge was the third-largest suspension span
in the world when it opened July 1, 1940. Almost immediately, it
gained a reputation for swaying in the winds that channel through
the passage that forms the entrance to southern Puget Sound.
   The bridge was designed by Leon Moiseiff, who also designed the
Golden Gate and San Francisco Bay bridges. But George said the
Narrows bridge ``was quite a departure from previous suspension
bridge designs.''
   For one thing, he said, it was narrow: just 33 feet and two
lanes wide. It also had solid sides and a solid deck, which George
said gave it the aerodynamic characteristics of  kite.
   The bridge roadbed would move in a wave-like motion. Old films
show cars disappearing in a wave trough and reappearing moments
later as the trough turns into a crest.
   On the day the bridge fell, the late Leonard Coatsworth, a
Tacoma News Tribune reporter, was driving across it with his
daughter's dog, Tubby.
   In an article published later that day, he described how the
swaying became so severe that he had to abandon his car. The
frightened dog refused to follow as Coatsworth walked and crawled
to the buckling bridge's east tower.
   Eyewitnesses described broken support cables cracking like whips
and concrete bursting from the roadbed like popcorn.
   The last person off the bridge was Howard Clifford, then a
photographer for the News Tribune who had been sent out with
reporter Bert Brintnal to cover the catastrophe.
   In an article published Thursday by the newspaper's successor,
The Morning News Tribune, Clifford told how he and Brintnal heard
sounds ``like rifle shots'' as support cables snapped. They were
standing on the bridge's eastern section when the center collapsed.
   ``Suddenly the center section of the bridge gave a mighty heave
and peeled back as it fell into the waters below,'' Clifford wrote.
``Fearing that the east section might also fall, Bert and I turned
and ran for the toll plaza.''
   The $6 million failure was replaced by an $18 million, four-lane
span that opened in October 1950.
   It was radically different: The roadbed rested on trusses that
had been tested in wind tunnels. The bridge deck, 60-feet wide
between the trusses, had gratings between the lanes to let air flow
through. At each of the two towers and at the center of the span
are hydraulic shock absorbers to dampen any movement.
   ``There's no way you're going to let a second one go down,''
George said. ``If anything, when this bridge was designed, I'm sure
it was ultra, ultra conservative.''
   Scuba divers, meanwhile, are trying to get Galloping Gertie's
remains declared a federal and state historical landmark to protect
it from salvagers who are taking pieces of it for scrap metal.
   ``Jacques Cousteau has even made dives at the Tacoma Narrows
Bridge. It's probably the finest dive in the Northwest in terms of
variety of sea life and clarity of water,'' diver Bob Mester said.
   Jake Thomas, the state's historical officer, said the sunken
bridge is worthy of consideration and wouldn't be the first
underwater site protected.
   To qualify, the structure must be of historical or
archaeological significance - and at least 50 years old.

   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
and her party walked out of the new Parliament today after her
jailed husband was not allowed to attend the swearing-in ceremony.
   The right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance, which routed Ms.
Bhutto in last month's election, took the oath without them to form
Pakistan's fifth civilian government.
   Dozens of police wielding batons surrounded the National
Assembly building and forced Bhutto supporters across a tree-lined
boulevard.
   Ms. Bhutto initially rejected demands to boycott the opening
session of the National Assembly, the lawmaking lower house of
Parliament. But she walked out after her husband, Asif Ali Zardari,
did not show up for the ceremony.
   Interior Minister Zahid Safraz said adequate security
arrangements could not be made to bring Zardari from jail in the
southern port city of Karachi to the Pakistani capital.
   Zardari won a legislative seat representing the sprawling
Karachi slum of Lyari in the Oct. 24 elections. He has been in jail
since Oct. 10 on extortion charges.
   Earlier this week, a judge ordered that Zardari be allowed to
take his parliamentary oath.
   Safraz said the availability of security personnel in Karachi
was limited because of weeklong demonstrations against the
desecration of a Moslem mosque by Hindu fundamentalists in
neighboring India. The demonstrations have been peaceful and
sparsely attended.
   Parliament Speaker Malik Miraj Khalid ordered the minister to
bring Zardari to Islamabad for Sunday's legislative session.
   Zardari, 38, has been blamed for many of Ms. Bhutto's troubles
since her government was ousted Aug. 6 on corruption charges. He
regularly came under fire during her 20 months in power for
allegedly demanding commissions on lucrative government contracts.
   Ms. Bhutto and Zardari have steadfastly denied any wrongdoing.
   Her populist Pakistan People's Party suffered a stunning defeat
in last month's national elections, which brought the right-wing
alliance to power.
   She has accused her opponents of massive vote fraud. The claims
have not been substantiated.
   It appears that Nawaz Sharif, 41, will be the next prime
minister. He was the alliance's unanimous choice for the post,
which will be decided by secret ballot in the Assembly next week.
   Sharif's alliance swept the national elections, winning 105
seats in the 217-seat Assembly. He also claims the loyalty of
another 40 seats controlled by independents and smaller parties.
   Ms. Bhutto's People's Party and three allied groups won only 45
seats.

   A jury quickly acquitted a woman of illegally
using a public men's room after she testified she couldn't wait in
a long line for the ladies' room.
   Jurors deliberated only 23 minutes Friday before acquitting
Denise Wells of illegally using the men's room during a July 7
concert at the Summit by country-western star George Strait.
   ``I'm relieved. I'm elated. The jurors told me, `You had us all
the way,''' Ms. Wells, 33, said after the verdict. She laughed and
hugged her lawyer, Valorie Wells Davenport, who is also her sister,
as the verdict was read.
   Ms. Wells was ticketed and ordered to leave the concert, for
which she had paid $125 for a ticket, after a security guard saw
her leave a stall in the men's room.
   She faced a $200 fine if convicted of a city ordinance that bars
members of one sex from using a public restroom designed for
members of the opposite sex in a manner calculated to cause a
disturbance.
   ``There was no proof or evidence that she entered in a manner
calculated to cause a disturbance,'' jury forewoman Frieda Felton
said.
   During a two-day trial, the defense also raised allegations that
public places do not provide adequate restroom facilities for
women, who generally take longer to go to the bathroom than men.
   Ms. Wells testified Friday that she used the men's room in
desperation because the ladies'-room line was too long.
   ``I felt I was in a situation where I had to be in a restroom,''
Ms. Wells testified. ``I took the only option I felt was
available.''
   She said she covered her eyes and apologized to the men already
in the restroom when she entered.
   In a videotaped deposition played in court, one of the men
testified that it was clear Ms. Wells wasn't trying to create a
distubance and that he sympathized with her.
   Air Force Lt. David Keller said that just before Ms. Wells
entered, he told another man in the restroom, ``If I were a woman,
I'd just go in here. Nobody should have to stand in that line.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a major bid to clean up the world's oceans,
delegates from the United States and 42 other nations have agreed
to bar dumping industrial waste at sea within five years.
   Environmental groups praised the actions taken by delegates at
the five-day meeting of the London Dumping Convention, which ended
Friday.
   ``It is not an exaggeration to say that this is an historic step
in cleaning up the sea,'' said Remi Parmentier of the environmental
group Greenpeace.
   On Thursday, the delegates adopted by consensus a resolution
that calls for phasing out industrial waste dumping at sea by 1995.
   It is legally binding on all 64 nations that have signed the
20-year-old London Dumping Convention. They include the United
States, Britain, Germany, France, the Soviet Union, Japan and most
other industrialized nations.
   The United States, which in 1988 passed a law halting ocean
dumping of industrial waste, had originally opposed the
international ban, saying more study was needed.
   ``But they realized there was such strong sentiment against
dumping that it was pointless to obstruct it and they just gave
up,'' Parmentier said.
   The resolution was sponsored by Denmark, Iceland, Finland,
Norway, Sweden, Spain and Brazil.
   Under the measure, a survey will be conducted to identify areas
suffering the worst effects of waste dumping. Member countries will
be expected to prosecute their own flagships found violating the
ban.
   The resolution calls for dumping to be stopped without
increasing pollution in other parts of the environment.
   The measure urges nations to encourage and promote cleaner
industrial processes, recycling, the treatment of waste on land and
more research and development on alternative and environmentally
sound means of waste disposal.
   Delegates also recommended creation of a global mechanism for
controlling land-based pollution of the sea.
   About 80 percent of all ocean pollution is generated on land; 10
percent comes from industrial waste disposed of by ships at sea,
and the rest is thrown or discharged from vessels in routine
operations.
   Delegates also agreed that the dumping convention should be
applied to the burial of radioactive waste under the sea floor. The
resolution, though not binding, was a setback for plans for sea-bed
disposal of high-level nuclear waste.
   The United States, Britain, France and Soviet Union - all with
active nuclear programs - voted against the resolution but
indicated they would voluntarily comply. Japan, Belgium,
Switzerland and Greece abstained from voting.
   ``This vote sends a strong message to the world that the sea
disposal of radioactive waste is not acceptable,'' Parmentier said.
   Disposing of the lethal waste is a major headache for
governments and the nuclear industry. Local groups often have
blocked construction of land-based nuclear dumps.
   ``We've all got radioactive waste that has to be disposed of,
and it either goes to the sea or to the land,'' said a British
delegate, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Wherever you go, someone will be very annoyed. But you can't
wish it away.''

   An exiled Kuwaiti official says the
government-in-exile has alerted the Arab League and the United
Nations that Iraq is using Kuwaiti letterhead and altering
documents it seized in the invasion.
   A document purporting to show that the CIA and Kuwait conspired
to damage Iraq's economy is a fake and was stamped with a seal
taken by the invading Iraqis, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed, exiled Kuwaiti
deputy premier and foreign minister, said Friday.
   The exiled Kuwaiti Foreign Ministry issued the warning about
bogus documents ``despite the naive contents with which the Iraqi
regime has been filling them,'' al-Ahmed said in a statement
released by the Kuwait News Agency.
   Iraq has claimed that its agents in occupied-Kuwait seized a
secret document that showed the CIA and Kuwaiti intelligence were
plotting against Iraq prior to the Aug. 2 invasion.
   CIA spokesman Peter Earnest said the document and its contents
were ``total fabrications and without foundation.''

<HEAD>Ivana Filing for Divorce from Donald</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After nine months of gossip about the war
between the Trumps, Ivana is filing for divorce from developer
Donald.
   It wasn't clear, however, whether she'll settle for their
postnuptial financial agreement, worth $22 million, or keep seeking
half of her husband's now-faltering empire.
   The Trumps announced Friday in statements that she is seeking
the divorce.
   They separated in February amid a flurry of publicity over
Donald Trump's relationship with model-actress Marla Maples. Their
marital troubles repeatedly made the front pages of the city's
tabloid newspapers.
   In March, Mrs. Trump's lawyers filed a lawsuit challenging the
validity of a postnuptial agreement that granted her $10 million
cash and the Trumps' $12 million Connecticut estate in the event of
divorce.
   At the time, Michael Kennedy, a lawyer for Mrs. Trump, said the
$22 million represented less than 1 percent of then-billionaire
Donald's assets. He said Mrs. Trump deserved half of her husband's
empire.
   But Trump since has come under severe pressure from bondholders
and other lenders and the worth of the former billionaire now is
subject to question.
   The postnuptial agreement Mrs. Trump signed has become more
attractive, the developer's lawyer, Jay Goldberg, suggested.
   ``In the first lawsuit she claimed the agreement ought to be set
aside,'' Goldberg said. ``Once the depositions were taken, she
realizes now the frivolousness of her position. Now she seeks a
divorce where she can get the benefit of the agreement.''
   Goldberg said Mrs. Trump's lawsuit seeking to invalidate the
agreement was still pending and he did not know what would happen
to it.
   Kennedy's secretary said Friday he would not speak to reporters.
   The Trumps married 13 years ago and have three children.

   A package bomb exploded early today

   The 22 pounds of explosives went off shortly after 2 a.m. in a

families in this northern Basque city, a police spokesman said on
condition of anonymity.
   No group claimed responsibility. But police suspected the blast
was the work of the Basque separatist organization ETA, the
spokesman said.
   The 18-year-old son of a policemen fell into the doorway area of
the residence when his bedroom floor collapsed, and he suffered
serious head injuries, the spokesman said. He was taken to a nearby
hospital, the spokesman said.
   He said flying glass injured an 11-year-old girl, but her cuts
were slight and were treated by emergency workers on the scene.
   The blast seriously damaged apartments on the first and second
floors and shattered windows of nearby buildings and cars, the
spokesman said.
   ETA seeks independence from Spain for the three-province
northern Basque region and has claimed numerous similar attacks.
The acronym stands for homeland and liberty in the Basque language.
   The group has taken responsibility for the killing of more than
600 people since beginning its violent campaign for independence in
1968. So far this year, ETA has claimed 15 killings.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Told Keating Knew Lincoln Savings Stood to Lose $2
Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Keating Jr. sold risky junk bonds for
his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association even after he told a
federal regulator the thrift stood to lose $2 billion, the
regulator told a grand jury.
   ``If this institution is taken over, you guys will be faced with
a $2 billion loss,'' the official, Alex Barabolak, quoted Keating
as telling him in October 1988, according to transcripts of grand
jury testimony released Friday.
   Barabolak is an examiner with the federal Office of Thrift
Supervision and a former examiner with the federal Home Loan Bank
Board.
   Prosecutors have charged that Keating knew Lincoln couldn't back
the uninsured bonds but misled the public into buying the bonds
from Lincoln and its parent, American Continental Corp.
   Keating has insisted he didn't know Lincoln was in trouble until
American Continental filed for bankruptcy in April 1989. Lincoln
was taken over by regulators the next day. It will cost taxpayers
an estimated $2 billion to bail out the thrift.
   ``We think we will demonstrate that we didn't violate any
laws,'' said Keating's attorney, Stephen C. Neal. ``And there's
nothing in the transcripts that changes my belief.''
   A 42-count indictment accuses Keating and three associates of
securities fraud in the junk bond sales.
   Keating, 66, pleaded innocent and is free on $300,000 bail after
spending a month in jail in Los Angeles. His associates also
pleaded innocent and posted bail.
   Keating is charged with ordering employees to steer depositors
away from insured certificates of deposit in favor of the uninsured
junk bonds. The proceeds were used to fund real estate ventures.
   All told, 17,458 investors lost more than $250 million,
prosecutors said. The indictment listed only 20 victims who lost
$1.1 million, as prosecutors said they wanted a concise case.
   A judge unsealed 45 volumes of grand jury testimony Friday at
the request of the news media.
   The transcripts showed that Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., one of
the so-called ``Keating Five'' - five U.S. senators who accepted
$1.3 million in political contributions from Keating - avoided
testifying before the grand jury. He pleaded a busy schedule.
   Cranston maintains he was unaware of the severity of Lincoln's
problems at the time he spoke to thrift regulators on Keating's
behalf. He says he was merely trying to cut red tape for a
substantial California employer.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating whether the five
senators improperly intervened with regulators on the Arizona
developer's behalf.
   In other testimony, an 83-year-old widow described how she was
lured into plunging her life savings into the bonds. Adaliza
Whinfield said she lost $50,000 on bonds purchased at the Lincoln
branch in Hemet, Calif., a retirement community in the desert 100
miles east of Los Angeles.
   Mrs. Whinfield said an investment counselor named Robert Pascual
told her the bonds ``were as safe as the United States of
America.''

<HEAD>Africans Set Conditions For Ending Sports Boycott</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   African Olympic organizers, in their
first meeting with South African sports officials, today refused to
drop their sports boycott against South Africa despite the
white-led Pretoria government's racial reforms.
   But Africa's main Olympic policy-making body also said at the
beginning of the two-day meeting that it looks forward to
readmission of South African sportsmen to international events ``in
the fairly near future.''
   Zimbabwean officials have said the South Africans will be told
specifically during the meeting what they must do to end the
boycott in time for the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
   ``We shall not give up until South African leaders accept that
in sport, all men are equal whatever the color of their skin,''
Jean Claude Ganga of the Congo, president of the Association of
National Olympic Committees of Africa, said at the opening session.
   South Africa has done away with part of its apartheid system of
racial separation in the past year.
   But the boycott imposed by the International Olympic Committee
in 1970 will not be lifted until apartheid is dismantled entirely
and South Africa merges white and black sports groups into one
national Olympic committee, Ganga said.
   The meeting marked the first time South African sports officials
conferred face-to-face with their black African counterparts to
discuss what Ganga called South Africa's return ``to that most
peaceful of battlegrounds, the sports ground.''
   About 40 South African sports organizers attended the meeting to
lobby for an end to the international sports boycott imposed by the
International Olympic Committee in 1970.
   The South Africans argue that reforms introduced by President F.
W. De Klerk have improved their country's image enough to clear the
way for a phased lifting of the boycott.
   African Olympic officials, however, say the dismantling of
apartheid and steps toward a negotiated settlement between the
white-dominated government and the voteless black majority must
make more progress before the ban can be eased.
   The South African delegates represent all major sports in that
country. They include Danie Craven, longtime president of the South
African Rugby Board, heads of the white-dominated National Cricket
Union and leaders of the mainly black Olympic Sports Committee.
   Despite bans in the past, some South African golfers, tennis
competitors and other individual players have taken part in
international events.
   There have also been unofficial and widely condemned tours to
South Africa, particularly by cricket and rugby teams.

<HEAD>Manhunt Continues In Deaths Of Four Small Children</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities with tracking dogs combed
woods today searching for a man accused in the stabbing deaths of
four children ages 2 to 5. Two other children and the man's sister
were wounded.
   Neighbors said Henry Curtis Jackson Jr., 26, went on the rampage
Thursday night because his sister wouldn't give him money for
drugs.
   Deputies and Mississippi Highway Patrol officers used dogs and
an airplane and helicopter Friday to search for Jackson in woods. A
ground search continued overnight.
   ``All of us are getting tired, Webster County Sheriff Bill
Middleton said late Friday. ``We're just trying to wait him out.''
   Jackson crashed through a bedroom door at the Greenwood home of
his mother, Martha Jackson, and stabbed to death four of his young
nieces and nephews, police said.
   Two other nieces and his sister, 23-year-old Regina Fay Jackson,
were wounded before Jackson fled in a car his mother had loaned
him, authorities said.
   Roadblocks were set up Friday night in Webster County, where the
night before Jackson ran a stop sign and wrecked the car about 65
miles east of Greenwood.
   Leflore County Coroner James Hankins said he found the victims
on the floor and ``all had been stabbed in the neck with a sharp
instrument.''
   Hankins identified the victims as Andrew Jackson, 2, Antonio
Jackson, 3, Shumetricia Jackson, 2, and Dominique Jackson, 5. The
girls were daughters of Regina Jackson. Authorities said Curtis
Jackson was the uncle of all of the children.
   Neighbors said the stabbings occurred after Jackson's sister
refused to give her brother money for drugs. Jackson's mother was
at a church service at the time, a Leflore County deputy said.
   ``He came in there and asked Regina (Jackson) for some money.
Regina said she didn't have any money, and he went to slashing,''
said Anthony Mallett, a 16-year-old who lives two doors down from
the Jackson home.
   ``He just clicked and started stabbing,'' said Angelo Jeems, 24,
a cousin of the Jackson family who lives across the street from the
red-brick house.
   Middleton said Jackson was wanted on four counts of murder and
three counts of attempted murder.
   Regina Jackson, who had multiple stab wounds, was in stable
condition, said Tricia Chick, spokeswoman at Greenwood Leflore
Hospital. She said Sarah Denise Jackson, 11, was listed in serious
but stable condition with stab wounds.
   Andrea Alice Jackson, 1, was first treated at the hospital then
transferred to the University Medical Center in Jackson, where
spokeswoman Barbara Austin said Friday night she was in critical
but stable condition after surgery.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail Gorbachev is urging restraint
after Moldavian troops shot Russians and Ukrainians in ethnic
strife that could jeopardize the Soviet president's efforts to hold
the nation together.
   Officials in Moldavia said at least three people were killed and
nine wounded in one clash Friday east of Kishinev, capital of the
southwestern Soviet republic.
   Moldavian authorities declared states of emergency in three
cities in the east, where separatists have declared their own
republic. Separatists declared a state of mourning and flags there
were flying half-mast, the official Soviet news agency Tass
reported.
   The separatist authorities also met to consider an economic
boycott of Kishinev, such as cutting off electricity supplies and
railway traffic, Tass said.
   The violence Friday came after Russian and Ukrainian separatists
seized a government building in Dubossary, set up roadblocks and
announced elections for an independent parliament, according to
legislators in Kishinev.
   The parliament in Moldavia, a republic of 4.3 million people
bordering Romania, announced formation of a new national guard to
try to re-establish order in the area east of the Dniester River.
   But Deputy Mayor Alexander Parajan of Dubossary said the
Dniester separatists ``demand the introduction of Soviet Interior
Ministry troops, instead of Kishinev militia or volunteer units,''
Tass reported.
   Pyotr Shornikov, a member of the Moldavian parliament, said
states of emergency were declared in the cities of Dubossary,
Tiraspol and Bendery.
   President Gorbachev met with the Moldavian president in Moscow
Friday during a conference of 15 republic leaders, and called for
restraint.
   ``The most important thing is the inviolability of Moldavia's
borders and its territorial integrity,'' Gorbachev said in an
interview on the nightly newscast ``Vremya.'' ``We should struggle
against separatists of all kinds.''
   Gorbachev, trying to carry out political and economic reform, is
beset by restive republics demanding greater autonomy or even
independence. All but one of the 15 republics have declared some
form of sovereignty.
   Moldavia declared sovereignty last June and is trying to
separate from the Soviet Union. But it faces its own crisis
produced by two internal separatist movements.
   The Gagauz, another minority composed of Turkish Christians,
declared sovereignty last week in southern Moldavia and the
legislature declared a state of emergency in the Gagauz area.
   Both separatist groups complain that Moldavians discriminate
against minorities.
   The unrest began more than a year ago after the Moldavian
parliament declared Moldavian the republic's national language.
Non-Moldavians feared discrimination and loss of their own culture
as Moldavian nationalism grew.
   Yuri Roshka, a Moldavian People's Front leader who supports
Moldavian independence, alleged the separatist movements were being
directed by the Kremlin to try to discredit and stop the republic's
independence drive.
   He declared, ``The Soviet empire has always used the tactic
`divide and conquer,' and that's what they're trying to do here.''
   Dubossary, a town containing more than 20,000 people, lies in a
heavily Slavic area northeast of Kishinev along the Dniester River.
More than 200,000 Russian and Ukrainian speakers live in the area.
   The Moldavian Interior Ministry said the fighting took place
about 5 p.m. Friday at the west end of a bridge over the river that
had been blocked by Russian and Ukrainian volunteers.
   From 100 to 200 Russian and Ukrainian volunteers erected a road
block on the bridge and other roads leading to their self-declared
Dniester republic after hearing rumors that Moldavians were headed
there to try to stop the independence movement, it reported.
   The ministry's Lt. Col. Yevgeny V. Zaporozov said 100 to 200
ministry troops fired after separatists hurled stones, sticks and
other missiles from behind a barricade on the bridge.
   Zaporozov said hospital officials in Dubossary told him gunfire
killed three people and wounded nine.
   The news agency Tass reported earlier that six people were
killed in fighting between Dubossary and Lunga village, but gave no
details. The discrepancy was not immediately clarified.
   Zaporozov said all the casualties were Russian or Ukrainian
volunteers.
   The approximately 400 Interior Ministry troops sent from
Kishinev also recaptured the government building in Dubossary,
parliamentary officials said.
   Russians and Ukrainians from the area had helped defend the
Gagauz from Moldavian nationalist volunteer who tried to stop the
Gagauz secession last week. The Kremlin sent up to 800 Interior
Ministry troops to keep order in the Gagauz areas.

<HEAD>Jesse Jackson Meets With Both Sides in Newspaper Strike</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson met with both sides at
the Daily News in an effort to resolve a bitter newspaper strike,
while management fought to get the paper to readers.
   Daily News publisher James Hoge said the paper has resorted to
giving away 200,000 copies a day because the strike has disrupted
its distribution system.
   Daily News delivery trucks are being dispatched to various areas
of New York each day to offer free ``samplings'' of the paper,
today's New York Times quoted Hoge as saying.
   Many newsstand operators throughout the city have refused to
sell the newspaper, saying they have been threatened with violence
or fear they will be. Replacement delivery drivers and their trucks
have been attacked and bundles of papers have disappeared from
distribution points since the strike began Oct. 25.
   Management officials said 1.06 million copies of Thursday's and
Friday's newspaper were printed, but it wasn't immediately clear
how many were sold.
   A source at a rival newspaper, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said its tracking of the Daily News' circulation showed
that the Daily News may have sold 285,000 to 295,000 papers Friday.
Another industry source, also speaking anonymously, said the total
could be 400,000 to 500,000.
   Jackson, an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1984 and
1988, met with Hoge on Friday before addressing a union rally
outside the Daily News' headquarters.
   The civil rights leader said the meeting produced a ``very
meaningful dialogue,'' but he did not elaborate.
   He told about 3,500 people at the rally that job security and
worker dignity are at stake.
   ``We choose negotiation over confrontation, but dignity and job
security above all,'' he said.
   Daily News spokeswoman Lisa Robinson declined to comment on the
possibility of Jackson bringing the two sides together to resolve
the strike.
   Lawyer Theodore Kheel, an adviser to the newspaper's nine
striking unions, said labor was interested in having Jackson
mediate an issue common to all of the unions - the right of
strikers to return to their jobs. The Daily News has replaced some
strikers who wouldn't cross picket lines.
   The News was struck by eight of its ten unions on Oct. 25, and
The Newspaper Guild joined the strike the next day. The unions
charge unfair labor practices. They have negotiated fruitlessly
since January over contracts that expired in March.

   Officials of six Warsaw Pact countries
signed an agreement today dividing up tanks, artillery, aircraft
and other conventional weapons.
   The accord removes the last serious obstacle to the Nov. 19
signing of a conventional arms treaty by the U.S., Canada and all
European nations except Albania in Paris on Nov. 19. President Bush
had said his presence was contingent on the conventional weapons
treaty being ready for signing.
   The meeting also comes at a time that the future of the
Soviet-led bloc is in question, as members strengthen ties with the
West.
   The signing of the agreement was delayed by almost four hours as
delegations continued to work out what Hungarian foreign ministry
spokesman Janos Herman called ``technical questions.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze did not come to
Budapest because of ``internal engagements,'' Herman said. He did
not elaborate, but Shevardnadze could have been forced to stay in
Moscow because of ethnic violence that erupted in Soviet Moldavia
along the Romanian border.
   The Soviet Union was represented by Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli
Kvitsinsky. The foreign ministers of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and
Romania were present. Czechoslovakia was represented by Deputy
Foreign Minister Robert Harenciar.
   Warsaw Pact experts agreed last weekend in Prague on how to
divide the 20,000 tanks and other conventional weapons they may
keep under the agreement between East and West.
   The NATO alliance will be allowed to keep similar levels of
weapons, but will have to destroy many fewer than the Warsaw Pact
members.
   Czechoslovak officials said after last week's meeting that the
Soviets will keep 13,150 tanks, 150 fewer than they had proposed to
keep.
   A Hungarian official recently revealed that the ``military
aspect'' of the Warsaw Pact would be suspended in December, and the
pact would be dissolved as a military alliance next year,
continuing only as a political body.
   Hungary has already served notice that it will leave the
military part of the Pact next year even if it is not dissolved by
then.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel said recently the pact would
be transformed into a body with a ``consultative political
function.''
   The Warsaw Pact was reduced to six members after East Germany
left the alliance prior to German unification last month.

<TEXT>
   Color photography pioneer Eliot Porter,
best known for his large-format books published by the Sierra Club,
has died at age 88.
   Porter died Friday at St. Vincent Hospital of cardiac arrest. He
had been hospitalized since Oct. 27 for treatment of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis, known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
   Porter was born Dec. 6, 1901, in Winnetka, Ill., and had lived
in Tesuque, N.M., since the mid-1940s.
   He earned a medical degree from Harvard and conducted bacterial
research there before turning his interest in photography into a
career.
   ``I don't think that he saw any difference between art and
science,'' said Jim Bones, who was Porter's assistant in the 1970s.
   ``If you look at history, the great artists were also great
scientists, like (Leonardo) da Vinci, for example,'' Bones said.
   Porter was first recognized for his photographs of birds, and
perhaps bestknown for ``Birds of North America - A Personal
Selection.''
   Two books featuring his work, ``Mexican Celebration'' and
``Nature's Chaos,'' were released last week, said David Scheinbaum,
owner of the Scheinbaum &amp; Russek Gallery of Photography in Santa
Fe.
   ``He is, beyond a doubt, the father of color photography as an
art form,'' Scheinbaum said. ``There is a whole generation of young
photographers who are following in his footsteps.''
   Porter, whose work was exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art in New York City, donated hundreds of prints to the University
of New Mexico and the Fine Arts Museum in Santa Fe, said Beaumont
Newhall, a photography historian and former UNM professor.
   Porter took his last photograph in 1986, the same year he was
diagnosed with Lou Gehrig's disease.
   He is survived by his wife Aline and five sons.

   Many of Oman's 65,000 civil servants
cheered, clapped their hands and stamped their feet Saturday as
cash handouts were announced to celebrate Sultan Qaboos's 50th
birthday and his 20 years on the throne.
   Government workers would receive bonuses of up to three times
their monthly salaries, Civil Service Minister Abdul-Nabi Macki
said.
   Larger payments were announced in the state press for members of
the security forces and defense personnel including foreign
contract officers and men in addition to Omani nationals.
   Government economists did not disclose the total amount of the
disbursement.
   Its Central Bank president said Oman's financial position was
``good'' following the rise in oil prices prompted by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   The official, Abdul-Wahab al-Khayata, said the handout would not
have an inflationary effect on gulf nation's economy.
   The government announced plans last month to go ahead with its
20th National Day celebrations Nov. 18, despite the crisis in the
northern gulf.
   British-educated Sultan Qaboos overthrew his father Sultan Seed
in 1970 in a bloodless coup ending more than a hundred years of
isolation and stagnation.
   Qaboos abolished his father's restrictions on the wearing of
sunglasses or owning of transistor radios.
   Qaboos put down a 10-year communist-inspired rebellion in
southern Dhofar province in 1975 and launched an extensive social
and economic development program.
   The nation of 1.5 million lies in the southeastern region of the
Arabian Peninsula.

   Fishermen drove hundreds of dolphins toward shore
on an island in southern Japan on Saturday, causing the deaths of
more than 100, officials said.
   Fishermen discovered thousands of dolphins swimming Friday night
in waters off Miiraku on Fukuejima island, 630 miles southwest of
Tokyo, an official of the Miiraku Fisheries Cooperative said.
   He said dozens of fishermen drove the dolphins toward the sandy
beach using ropes in hopes of killing some for food. But more than
expected were trapped by the receding tide and were beached, he
said.
   At least 100 died on the beach but another 200 returned to open
waters, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Television showed dozens of dolphin bodies on the beach, some
thrashing their tails, with dozens more swimming in nearby shallow
waters.
   The official said fishermen and local people had taken most of
the dead dolphins home to eat. ``Many people here like to eat
dolphin meat,'' he said.
   Some owners of shops selling fish offered from 15 to 23 cents
for each dolphin, he said.
   The fishery cooperative official said catching and eating
dolphins should be ``no problem'' because there is no law
prohibiting the practice. He said a much smaller number of dolphins
were killed by the villagers last year.
   Dolphins are used as a source of protein by the local people
because fish and meat is expensive in the isolated community, Kyodo
News Service reported.
   Animal protection groups overseas have criticized the Japanese
custom as cruel and barbarian.
   ``We know it is a controversial issue, but for fishermen here,
dolphins are enemies because dolphins eat squid and other small
fish,'' the official said.
   In February 1978, when fishermen in Iki, another fishing town in
the area, killed about 1,000 dolphins caught off the island,
protesters poured into the town.

<HEAD>Deficit-Reduction Bill To Cost Average Taxpayer $321 A Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deficit-reduction bill awaiting President
Bush's signature will cost the average family of four $321 a year,
with additional taxes spread close to evenly among the states, a
new analysis shows.
   The average increase will range from $151 per family in West
Virginia to $578 in Connecticut, according to computations by
Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-financed research group.
   The changes will take an average 0.6 percent of family income on
a national basis, the report said. The bite on family income will
be within one-tenth of a percentage point of the national average
in every state except Connecticut (0.8 percent) and West Virginia
(0.4 percent).
   ``Generally, states with the highest incomes will face slightly
higher-than-average ... tax hikes as a share of income, while those
with the lowest average incomes will pay the least in additional
taxes,'' the report said.
   ``This reflects the fact that, overall, the tax hikes are
somewhat progressive,'' meaning they fall most heavily on those
most able to pay, the organization said.
   On a national basis, the median tax increase will be $183,
meaning that half the four-member families will see tax increases
of less than $183 and half will see increases of more. The highest
median increase, $250, will be in Alaska; the lowest, $152, in
Pennsylvania. The median increase differs from the average
increase, which is calculated by dividing all new taxes by all
taxpaying families.
   The bill, which would cut the deficit by nearly $500 billion
over the next five years, includes $137 billion in tax increases.
   These include higher taxes on gasoline, tobacco, alcoholic
beverages, airline tickets, telephone service and expensive cars
and other ``luxuries.'' In addition, the plan will raise Medicare
payroll taxes on people whose wages exceed $51,300 and income taxes
on those with incomes generally above the $100,000-a-year range.
   Meanwhile, the organization representing state lawmakers said
the deficit-reduction plan will cost the states $16.9 billion over
the next five years.
   ``Once again, congressional and administration budget
negotiators have taken the easy way out by exporting difficult
decisions to the states,'' the National Conference of State
Legislatures said in a statement.
   ``Many states face severe recessionary and no-growth economic
conditions,'' said the statement from Lee Daniels, minority leader
of the Illinois House of Representatives, and John Martin, speaker
of the Maine House of Representatives. ``Knowing this, Washington
now decides to invade state revenue bases and at the same time tell
states they need to find billions of additional dollars.''
   The biggest portion of the $16.9 billion - $10.1 billion - will
come from provisions mandating Social Security coverage for all
state and local government employees and raising the amount of
wages that are subject to the Medicare tax. Employers, including
governments, must match employee taxes for Social Security and
Medicare.
   Other costs will include $3.6 billion in lost state revenue
because of the higher taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcoholic
beverages, and $3.2 billion that the states will have to spend to
meet federal regulations for Medicare and Medicaid services.

   About 27,000 people are poisoned by pesticides
each year in one Chinese province, 10 percent of them fatally, an
official report said Saturday.
   The Legal Daily attributed the high incidence of poisonings in
east China's Jiangsu province to the growing use of pesticides over
the past decade without adequate safety instructions. No nationwide
figures were given.
   Jiangsu, one of China's 31 provinces and administrative regions,
has a population of 64.4 million.
   About 52 percent of the poisonings resulted from accidents while
applying pesticides, the report said. It classed the rest as
``accidents not occurring during production,'' including deliberate
drinking of pesticides to commit suicide.
   It said non-production accidents were increasing steadily and
hit a high of 17,000 cases last year, including 1,905 suicides.
   ``The great majority of those killed by pesticides are young,
strong workers and the main supporters of their family,'' the
report said.

   Officials fine-tuning Atherton's
disaster plans have a new message in the event of an earthquake or
other natural disaster: Just touch that dial.
   The wealthy suburb 20 miles south of San Francisco is giving
each household a tiny radio already tuned to a local station that
will broadcast emergency information.
   Static over information distribution during last year's
earthquake prompted the program.
   ``Our main problem during last year's earthquake was
dissemination of information to the public,'' said Police Chief Kip
Rolle. ``We needed to tell people that everything was OK.''
   After the Oct. 17, 1989, quake, power and telephone service was
disrupted, and most media attention was focused on larger cities
and areas that suffered substantial damage, officials said.
   But next time disaster strikes, the town's 8,000 residents can
use their new radios to listen to KCEA, a non-profit FM station at
Menlo Atherton High School.
   The station, which has emergency generators, will broadcast
local emergency information from the town's disaster command post.
   Officials decided to pre-set the radios so people wouldn't have
to remember KCEA's dial setting, 89.1, said Councilwoman Nan
Chapman.
   The City Council allocated $25,000 for the radios, which police
are distributing this month. The council hopes to be reimbursed by
donations.

<TEXT>
   In the 11th floor disco of Baghdad's
Mansour Melia Hotel, overlooking the palm-fringed Tigris River, two
American and British diplomats sip beer and Cokes as they wait to
meet Saddam Hussein's ``guests.''
   Under the watchful eyes of Iraqi intelligence agents, a line of
foreign men, some emaciated and sick, sit one by one at the tables.
   Pleasantries are exchanged. The diplomats offer chocolates and
hand over letters from some of the men's families.
   The chocolates are consumed quickly and then the diplomats pass
on which names they have submitted to the Iraqi government for
release on grounds of age or poor health, which hostages they
believe are to be used as Saddam Hussein's human shields.
   Sometimes the hostages themselves know they've been selected by
the Iraqis to be sent to strategic locations throughout Iraq to
deter any U.S.-led air attacks on those targets.
   There is agony in their eyes. But smiles of relief flutter
fleetingly on the faces of those who have not been chosen and have
a faint chance of being freed.
   According to information gathered by Western diplomats and other
sources, there were nearly 600 Americans, Britons, Japanese or
Germans held at various strategic locations.
   About 300 Frenchmen held as human shields were allowed to leave
Iraq last week. The French release was an apparent Iraqi effort to
encourage France to pressure Washington and its allies to find a
peaceful settlement to the Persian Gulf crisis prompted by the Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The luxurious 320-room Mansour Melia in Baghdad's Salhiya
district was built by a Spanish company specially to accommodate
heads of state slated to attend the 1982 summit of the non-aligned
movement.
   But Iraq was then at war with Iran and the summit was eventually
held in New Delhi after Tehran objected to the Baghdad venue.
   The hotel has now become the ``great hostage bazaar'' for
Saddam's government, diplomats say. They also call it the ``hostage
palace.''
   The logic behind the human shield operation is starkly simple -
the hostages die if the multinational force in the gulf launches
air strikes on Iraq.
   ``The place is shockingly depressing'' said American diplomat
Stephen Thibeault, who is allowed to visit the Mansour twice a day
to see U.S. hostages. ``It's a hostage manufacturing unit.
   ``The day some of the hostages are released and allowed to go
home, the rooms are immediately restocked'' with others among the
hundreds of foreigners held in Baghdad, he said.
   Most of the American hostages held at strategic sites passed
through the hotel.
   When Britain's former prime minister, Edward Heath, left for
home Oct.24 with 33 Britons whose freedom he had negotiated, 26
other Britons were brought to the hotel within hours for shipping
out to strategic sites.
   Those at the hotel waiting to be utilized as human shields are
not allowed to leave the building or make telephone calls. But they
can swim in the hotel pool watched by Iraqi guards.
   ``They can eat from the hostage buffet that's laid out twice a
day,'' said another Western diplomat on condition that neither he
nor his nationality were mentioned.
   ``In simple terms, this place is nothing but a prison with the
facilities of a hotel,'' he added.
   The Mansour Melia was chosen as a hostage center by the Iraqis
because it is situated between several important government
buildings and security is tight.
   At night, lights around the hotel are kept on, making it a
sitting duck target in any air raid.
   ``The idea is again simple, you'll kill your own men if you
attack,'' the diplomat said. ``Even a greenhorn pilot could pick
the hotel as a nice target.''
   After the invasion of Kuwait, Iraq banned foreigners from
leaving the country, instructing them to report to the police.
Iraqis harboring foreigners were warned they could be hanged if
they were caught.
   The government then selected Americans, Britons, Germans,
Japanese and Frenchmen as human shields.
   Hundreds of other foreigners, including an estimated 300
Americans, are in hiding in Kuwait. They are constantly being
caught in ones and twos.
   Saddam has told the hostages that they're being held because
``barring a person from seeing his homeland for a limited period of
time is better for him and for humanity as a whole than denying
thousands of people life itself'' in Iraqa.
   Saddam also told his ``guests'' that they will be freed ``when
the clouds roll by and the sky becomes clear again.''
   But there are no signs that the sky over the gulf is clearing.

   While Lt. Guy Zanti's wife and father run a
marathon Sunday in Washington, the naval officer intended to match
their efforts on a battleship in the Persian Gulf.
   Zanti became interested in marathon running in April when he
watched his 53-year-old father run his first marathon in
California. Zanti told his father even if he couldn't make it to
Sunday's Marine Corps Marathon, he would still run the 26.2 miles.
   ``He had been based in the Mediterranean, so he planned on
training on land and the ship, and then running the marathon on
land,'' said his father, Frank Zanti Sr. ``When this crisis came
up, he was deployed to the gulf. But he didn't stop his training
and he's going to run on the ship.''
   The USS Wisconsin, an Iowa class battleship, is 887 feet long,
about one-sixth of a mile. But even at that, the 29-year-old Zanti
will have to make about 75 laps.
   The younger Zanti has already run 24 miles and 22 miles on the
ship during training, said his father, a tool-and-die maker who
lives in suburban Catonsville.
   ``You can imagine what it's like. It's a battleship, but that
has to be a boring run,'' said Zanti's sister, Karen Burkett. ``And
a hard run, because you're running on metal, not asphalt or
grass.''
   Zanti's wife, Lt. Kathleen Zanti-Murray, 27, who met her husband
at the U.S. Naval Academy and is based in Norfolk, Va., will also
run with her father-in-law.
   Zanti said his son, who wrestled for the Navy, started training
in April after traveling to California to watch him run in a
marathon in Big Sur.
   ``While we were out there, my son met me at the 20-mile marker
and we ran the rest of the race together,'' Zanti said. ``Guy
really was impressed by the atmosphere, the runners and the whole
scene. He's quite an athlete and he just felt like he could do
it.''

   Rebels seeking to overthrow the Rwandan
government denied reports in Ugandan newspapers today that their
leader is alive and being treated for battlefield injuries in the
United States.
   A statement from the Rwandan Patriotic Front said rebel leader
Fred Rwigyema died after stepping on a mine Oct. 2, the second day
of the invasion.
   Rebel representatives in Brussels said on condition of anonymity
that the news of Rwigyema's death was kept secret for fear of
lowering the morale of the guerrillas.
   But Ugandan newspapers reported today that Rwigyema was
seriously wounded during a helicopter attack on rebel forces and
was taken to the United States.
   The newspapers, quoting Rwandan army commander Lt. Col.
Deogratius Ndabimana, did not describe Rwigyema's injuries or say
when or where he was injured. The reports in the Star and Munno
newspapers also did not say who evacuated Rwigyema, a former
Ugandan deputy army commander, or where he was taken in the United
States.
   Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, could not be
reached for comment.
   In Washington, U.S. officials said they could not confirm
whether Rwigyema was dead or alive, but pointed out he had not been
heard from since the beginning of the invasion. They also denied,
on condition of anonymity, that Rwigyema had been brought to the
United States for treatment.
   The insurgents said Rwigyema was killed in the northeastern
region around Kagitumba near the Ugandan border. The rebels have a
base camp in the area.
   The front also announced two other rebel leaders were killed by
a land mine on Oct. 23. The statement did not say who was currently
leading the insurgents.
   The rebels said they still controlled the Kagera National Park
in the north, which makes up about 15 percent of Rwanda's
territory, despite government claims it had driven the insurgents
out.
   The front said it was ready to talk with the government about
the future of Rwanda, a former Belgian protectorate. But the rebels
warned they could still launch attacks.
   Last week, the Belgian government said it had negotiated a
cease-fire between the government troops and the rebels, but the
truce has yet to become effective.
   Belgium and France sent paratroopers to Rwanda to protect their
nationals after the insurgency began. Belgium's last paratroopers
returned Saturday.
   Rwigyema, who was 34, fled Rwanda as a child during the
repression of the Tutsi tribe. He returned to Rwanda on Oct. 1,
leading a group of mostly Tutsi refugees and deserters from
Uganda's army seeking to depose the government.

<HEAD>Polls Show Tough Anti-Tax and School Choice Issues Trailing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The tax revolt and the environmental movement may be headed for
jolts at the polls Tuesday. And anger at government could lead
voters in two states to limit politicians' terms.
   Polls conducted in the final days of this year's campaign show
roughly 2-1 support for ballot proposals in California and Colorado
aimed at limiting terms of state legislators. Colorado's proposed
amendment extends even to U.S. senators and congressmen.
   But the tide may be turning against ``Big Green,'' a sweeping
environmental issue in California, as well as many of the anti-tax,
anti-spending measures facing voters in about a dozen states.
   In several cases, that's a switch from earlier poll results
showing many such measures seemingly coasting toward approval.
   In all, voters in 43 states and the District of Columbia will
decide 236 ballot questions, according to the Free Congress
Foundation, a conservative Washington-based research group that
tracks propositions.
   Sixty-seven are citizen initiatives - the most since 1914, when
a record 90 appeared on state ballots. Twenty-six states, mostly in
the West, allow citizens to put initiatives on the ballot.
   The changing fortunes of ballot races in several states have
followed heavy campaigning by teachers unions, local government
officials and other affected interest groups and individuals.
   Their efforts appear to be paying off in Massachusetts, Oregon
and Nebraska, where early support for stringent anti-tax,
anti-spending issues seems to be waning.
   Analysts had interpreted the heavy volume of ballot measures as
a sign of voter anger at politics-as-usual. But as Election Day
approaches, confusion prevails as voters try to sort out the
consequences of the many ballot issues that promise sweeping
solutions to complex problems.
   Nowhere is that truer than in California, where earlier wide
support for the highly complicated environmental proposition known
as ``Big Green'' has dwindled, according to polls. The proposal is
just one of 28 questions on California's ballot.
   The outlook in key contests:
   - A tight race is apparently shaping up over California's
Proposition 128, which would impose severe limits or bans on
pesticides, offshore oil drilling, and chemicals and emissions that
harm the ozone layer. Environmental advocates still hope passage
would give their cause a boost, but a poll on Friday found ``Big
Green'' trailing slightly.
   - Among other environmental contests, Missourians appear evenly
split on a ``Natural Streams'' proposal aimed at protecting Ozark
waterways.
   - In Massachusetts, a proposed $2 billion state tax rollback is
facing an uphill battle. A poll for The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV
found 59 percent opposed to the rollback. Opponents of what would
be the largest voter-initiated state tax cut in history argue it
would bankrupt poor school districts, seriously damage others and
lead to tens of thousands of state layoffs.
   - A Montana initiative, which would junk the state's existing
tax system and replace it with a novel 1 percent ``trade charge''
on all sorts of transactions, is trailing by a wide margin in
opinion polls.
   - Polls suggest a majority of Utah voters may be heeding
warnings of state college and school officials that a proposed
repeal of the state sales tax on most food would be a disaster for
education financing.
   - In Nebraska, the so-called ``2 Percent Solution,'' a
proposition that would limit annual growth in state and local
spending to 2 percent, is likewise in trouble. An Oct. 24-26 poll
published in the Omaha World-Herald found 57 percent of those
surveyed opposed to the limit. Nebraskans also seem to be turning
against a proposal to scrap a recently enacted school finance
reform law that takes the burden from property tax by increasing
state income and sales taxes.
   - In a contest being watched by the Bush administration and
education reformers, Oregon voters will decide on a far-reaching
school ``choice'' measure that would grant parents a $2,500 tax
credit to send their kids to any school, even church-related, or to
teach them at home. Recent polls show the plan trailing.
   - A survey released Wednesday indicated Oregon voters narrowly
favored two other tough measures: one phasing in a 1.5 percent
property tax limit, and a second that would shut down the state's
only nuclear power plant.
   - In Nevada, 52 percent of those surveyed in an Oct. 21 poll
supported a ballot issue aimed at making it harder to change the
state's liberal abortion law. In Oregon, a proposed ban on
abortions except in cases of rape and incest appears headed for
defeated, while a measure requiring parental notification for
abortions performed on minors may pass.

<HEAD>Pakistan Prepares for Islamic Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The right-wing coalition that ousted
Prime Minister Benzair Bhutto is ready to revive the spread of
Islamic law, and everthing from social mores to civil liberties may
be affected.
   Islam has long been the center of cultural conflict between the
Westernized urban elite and Islamic clerics who wield enormous
influence over the impoverished, conservative countryside where
most of Pakistan's 110 million people live.
   The last military dictator, Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, championed
Islamic law. During her 20 months in power, however, Mrs. Bhutto
was able to stave off attempts by religious fundamentalists to
assert their influence over government and society.
   With her dismissal from office and subsequent defeat in last
month's parliamentary elections, the governing Islamic Democratic
Alliance is in a position to bring back strict Islamic principles
and has pledged to do so.
   It has a parliamentary majority and probably will be able to
draw on small parties for the two-thirds majority needed to pass a
bill imposing Islamic law.
   ``In Islam, the state and religion cannot be separated,'' said
Zia's eldest son, Ijaz ul-Haq, who won a Parliament seat by
promising to carry on his father's Islamic dream.
   During his 11-year rule, Gen. Zia made the ``Islamization'' of
Pakistani society a pillar of his policy. He was killed in a plane
crash in August 1988, and Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party won
elections held three months later.
   Her dismissal Aug. 6 charges of corruption and mismanagement
renewed the debate of whether Pakistan should be a secular
democracy or governed by the laws of the Koran, the Moslem holy
book, as interpreted by Islamic scholars. Islamic law is
interpreted with varying stringency from one Moslem nation to
another.
   Gen. Zia's laws included a ban on consumption of alcohol,
flogging and stoning as punishments for such crimes as drinking and
adultery, and a 2.5 percent tax on the rich to help the poor. They
remain in effect, but punishment by flogging is rare and there have
been no stonings.
   Defining the relationship between Islam and the country's legal
system has been a central question since 1947, when Pakistan was
created as a homeland for Moslems in the partition of the Indian
subcontinent.
   Many Islamic principles were enshrined in law before Zia seized
power in a a 1977 military coup. He sought to expand these
dramatically, giving courts constitutional power to determine
whether laws conformed to the Koran and the traditions of the
prophet Mohammed.
   When Gen. Zia dismissed Parliament in May 1988, he cited
corruption, laxity and failure to promote Islamic law. He issued a
presidential order that decreed the legal code of Islam to be the
supreme law of Pakistan and expanded court powers to review laws
for conformity with the Koran.
   Although special courts now review laws for compliance with
Islamic tradition, final appeals still go to civil high courts
rather than to legal bodies of religious scholars, as in some
Moslem states.
   That could change with the new government, both critics and
supporters say.
   ``The (bill) will have smooth passage,'' said Zia's son, a
38-year-old U.S.-educated banker. ``That is what Islam is.''
   Opponents contend the Islamic biIl would promote sectarianism,
pave the way for a militant and repressive theocracy, confine women
to their homes and ostracize them, and bring the media and
educational system under clerical control.
   Many groups, particularly the middle class, lawyers and educated
women, believe Pakistan should not turn its back on Western
educational and legal traditions inherited from the British
colonial era.
   Ms. Bhutto has tried to cloak herself in Islamic traditions, but
also has spoken out strongly against Zia's brand of Islamization.
   ``The name is Islam was used to practice oppression,'' she said.
``Basic human rights were jeopardized under the new laws enacted as
Islamic laws.''
   Earlier this year, she infuriated the clerics by saying she
opposed cutting off a hand as punishment for theft. They called her
an unbeliever and warned that anyone who said such things could be
sentenced to death by religious leaders.
   Last week, the leading Islamic court ruled that punishment for
defiling Mohammed's name or teachings must be death.

   He plays baseball, likes cheese pizza and watches wrestling on
television.
   But this Saddam is a 9-year-old fourth-grader at Pearl Upper
Elementary School in this community near Jackson.
   Friends say he's an all-around nice kid.
   A Pakistan native, Saddam said he is unfazed by sharing a name
with the man President Bush branded ``the butcher of Baghdad.''
   ``When I was little, my parents used to tell me all about
Saddam,'' he said. ``I know he's not a nice person.''
   ``He is handling it all very well,'' teacher Patsy Rogers said
of the occasional ribbing Saddam takes about his name. ``He has a
sense of humor.''
   Saddam said he quickly got used to double takes and quizzical
looks from teachers when school started a few weeks after Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   ``They don't notice my name that much now,'' he said.
   ``Our music teacher said that if the Saddam Hussein over there
was as sweet as the Saddam Hussain over here, we wouldn't have any
problems,'' said Paige Welborn, one of Saddam's classmates. ``I
think she's right.''
   Saddam is quick to point out a key difference between his name
and the Iraqi leader's: ``He spells his (last) name with an `E,'''
Saddam said. ``I spell mine with an `A.'''
   Saddam got his name for two reasons: His older brother is named
Hasham, and the rhyming names sounded good for a pair of brothers,
his father, Manzoor Hussain, said, adding:
   ``In New York, where I was working, I had an Iranian friend. I
would tell him, `I'm going to have a son, and I'm going to name him
Saddam.'''
   He said he was only teasing his Iranian friend. At that time in
1980, Iran and Iraq were at war.
   ``After we had a son, I thought, `Why not name him Saddam? It's
a good name,''' said Hussain, a veterinarian for the U.S.
Agriculture Department in Jackson.
   Most of Saddam's peers at Pearl Upper Elementary understand a
bit about events developing in the Persian Gulf, Rogers said.
   A few classmates have greeted him with military salutes.
   ``I just ignore them,'' Saddam said, shrugging.
   ``I don't like it when people make fun of him,'' said Scott
Rowan, one of Saddam's best friends. ``I take up for him.''
   Rogers smiles when talking about Saddam's part in a class
project.
   ``They wrote letters to the servicemen in the Middle East,'' she
said. ``You're going to love what Saddam put on his card. He wrote,
`I'm not who you think I am.'''

<HEAD>Taxi Firms Settle Bias Suit for $300,000, Agree to Monitor Drivers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three taxicab companies in the nation's
capital have agreed to pay over $300,000 to settle a racial
discrimination lawsuit.
   In a consent decree, the companies agreed to improve service,
but did not admit to the alleged violations.
   The decree was signed in federal court on Friday.
   Six people and one company filed suit against the companies
alleging that cabs in the District of Columbia failed to pick up
black patrons and refused them service to predominantly black
neighborhoods of the city.
   The suit was the first to address racial discrimination in the
district's taxicab industry and makes the companies liable for
actions by individual drivers.
   Under the agreement, American Cab, National Cab and Empire Cab
said they would formally address complaints by passengers that
claim they were refused service on the basis of race.
   All complaints would be recorded and investigated by a committee
assigned by each company, court papers said.
   If the committee finds service was denied, wholly or partially
based on race or the location of a rider's destination, actions
will be taken against the driver.
   Officials said upon the first confirmed incident, the companies
agreed to revoke the driver's right to use the company's colors and
accompanying benefits for seven days.
   Taxicab driving privileges would be suspended for 12 days for a
second incident and the driver would be permanently terminated upon
the third incident.

<HEAD>Soliders Clash With Crowds Protesting Jail Death in Gaza</HEAD>

   Palestinians enraged by the death of a prison
inmate clashed today with soliders using tear gas and
gravel-throwing machines. One protester was killed and dozens were
injured, Arab and army reports said.
   Curfews were imposed on four villages and refugee camps in the
occupied Gaza strip in an effort to quell the unrest, according to
a statement from the army, which reported at least 43 injuries
among the protesters.
   Arab reports put the number of wounded in the Gaza Strip at 113,
including a 4-year-old boy who was struck in the head by gravel.
The army said it was checking other reports.
   The clashes underscored a rise in Arab-Israeli tensions since
the Oct. 8 Temple Mount killings of 20 Arabs and subsequent
stabbing deaths of three Israelis in Jerusalem.
   The violence began early today after word that Attiyah Abdel
Atti Zanin, 36, of Beit Hanoun village died in his jail cell in
Gaza City.
   Authorities told Zanin's family he hanged himself with a rope
made from blankets. Zanin was detained 13 days ago for questioning
about links to the mainstream Fatah wing of the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   Prison Services spokeswoman Shulamit Meiri said Zanin's body was
found late Friday. It was believed he committed suicide because he
was alone in the cell and there were no signs of violence, she
said.
   But rumors spread quickly through the village of 11,000 that
Israeli soldiers killed Zanin, who had been jailed three times by
Israeli authorities.
   Youths took to the streets and began throwing stones at troops,
Arab reports said. The riots spread to at least three sections of
nearby Gaza City and the refugee camps of Shati, Nozeirat and
Jebalya.
   Troops opened fire, killing Mohammed Izzat Abdullah el
Bassiouny, 36, who sustained a bullet wound in the head, the
reports said. The army said Bassiouny was 29.
   Bassiouny was the 771st Palestinian to be killed by Israelis in
the 34-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in the West Bank and
Gaza Strip, which are home to 1.7 million Palestinians and some
70,000 Jewish settlers.
   Another 293 Arabs have been killed by fellow Palestinians as
alleged collaborators with Israel, and Arabs have killed 51
Israelis and foreigners.
   Riots spread from Beit Hanoun to six other neighborhoods and
refugee camps in the vicinity of nearby Gaza City, the reports
said. Witnesses said soldiers sprayed tear gas out of helicopters
and used gravel-throwing machines in some spots to contain the
violence.

   ``I called Mom to ask how the kids are doing,'' Capt. Sheila
Michelli writes after rejoining her Army unit for military
exercises. ``It's a relief to know that they miss me less than I
miss them.''
   An Army logistics officer at Fort Lee, Va., Sheila is a woman
who knows how to take control and get things done. But saying
goodbye to 6-week-old Connor is a tough order. He is the Michelli's
second son - the last child the couple plan.
   ``The most wrenching part about returning to work is giving up
breast-feeding,'' she writes at 5:53 p.m., after dropping the kids
off with her parents and heading for nine days of crisis combat
preparedness training.
   ``Connor I'll see in 11 days, but I'm done breast-feeding for
good,'' she writes. ``It's so final.''
   Still, letting go of her newborn is easier the second time
around. Sheila, 27, has finally decided to commit to a career with
the Army, where she believes working mothers have it pretty good.
   She received 28 days' paid maternity leave with her first child
and 42 days with Connor. Less than half of U.S. working women have
access to such maternity benefits, according to the Census Bureau.
   Shortly after returning to work last spring, Sheila was placed
in command of a 300-member unit. The Persian Gulf crisis has since
put pressure on the entire military, though the Michellis have not
been directly affected.
   Sheila is proud of herself, but the work is demanding. And her
husband, Tom, is a semi-workaholic who works as a computer
programmer for Virginia's National Guard.
   Because both are so committed to their careers, tensions arise.
Sometimes the couple ends up locking horns. But Sheila knows she
can count on Tom to help warm a bottle, wash a load of diapers or
be there when it's time to drive the babysitter home.
   ``It takes a lot of coordination and teamwork,'' says Sheila.
``We argue ... but he supports me.''
   And that, all the mothers agreed, is key.

<HEAD>BROADCASTING AND BREAST-FEEDING:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``The first day back at work was nothing short of traumatic,''
Pam Salazar writes after going back to her job reporting for
television station WKEF in Dayton, Ohio. ``The thought of leaving
my baby brought me to tears.''
   Although willing to cut back on hours at the office and forgo
her morning anchor position, Pam wasn't prepared to quit
broadcasting altogether.
   ``I guess I thought somehow the situation would magically work
itself out,'' she writes, after finding out how it feels to be
caught between news deadlines and her 5-month-old daughter, Chase.
   There are no magic wands when it comes to racing the clock. Pam
may roar home to relieve the babysitter after a late-breaking news
story or reel into work after prolonged morning good-byes.
   But breast-feeding is another story. Mother Nature won't be
rushed.
   ``I was extremely nervous,'' Pam, 28, wrote after her first
disastrous attempt at expressing milk in an office bathroom.
``Would I be able to master the art ... would I manage to pump
enough (milk) to feed my baby?''
   It was only after several attempts and with a lot of coaching by
telephone from her husband, Kyle Hickok, that Pam was able to get
the gadget to draw milk. The new mother felt like she was hogging
the bathroom and, perhaps, embarrassing her colleagues and herself.
   ``But my co-workers are very supportive of my breast-feeding,''
she writes. ``The news director bends over backwards to accommodate
Mother Nature's schedule, allowing me to only go out on short
stories so that I don't miss a pumping session.''
   The majority of employers are not as supportive. Of 6 million
U.S. companies, only a slimminority offer subsidies, referrals or
on-site day care for working mothers.
   Some working mothers read a message in the writing on the wall:
They feel they are not valued members of the labor force. Down at
the TV station, Pam found the kind of support many women crave -
and still there were tensions.
   ``Nursing is something I felt very strongly about, but I had my
doubts about how professional it would be,'' she reflects. ``I'm
pulled both ways ... feeling guilty that I'm not doing either of
(my jobs) very well.''

<HEAD>SHARING THE LOAD:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``My name is Vicki Sugarman and my game is the `Mommy Track,' ''
the new mother writes.
   ``I would be very upset if we were just a token, '' writes Janet
Aikens, who with Vicki shares a job managing promotions at Reebok
International Ltd. in Stoughton, Mass.
   Vicki and Janet each work three days a week, overlapping on
Wednesdays. The co-workers hit on the increasingly popular
alternative to full-time work and motherhood after each became
pregnant around the same time last year.
   Job-sharing has required some adjustments to ensure both women
are working on projects suited to their skills. All concerned
eventually decided it would be easier for Janet and Vicki to split
their hours but work independently.
   ``I now have the best of both worlds!'' writes Vicki, 31. ``I
can maintain my professional status and still be with my daughter
four days a week.''
   But read between the lines. It wasn't quite that simple.
   The night before her first day back, Vicki lay in bed staring at
the clock and wondering how being both a mother and a manager would
work out.
   ``It is 3 a.m. in the morning and I am still wide awake just
wondering: Will the baby think that I have deserted her? Will the
nanny take good care of her? What will it be like to be back in the
office? Have I forgotten everything I've ever learned? When will I
ever fall asleep?''
   Janet, too, has known fitful nights.
   Before the birth of her son, she was working 10 hours a day and
traveling at least a week out of every month. Her husband, Andy,
was matching her hour-for-hour at his job as an engineer for
Raytheon Co.
   ``I was determined not to let my pregnancy change anything, so I
continued to work, work, work ...'' Janet, 30, wrote after her
first day back. ``I wanted to be promoted to associate brand
manager by year's end, as scheduled.''
   But things changed. Priorities shifted.
   ``The decision not to return to my career full time was a very
difficult one for me. I had worked hard and long to get where I was
... (but) there was Skyler,'' Janet writes.
   ``I can get my career back on track, but I can never recapture
Skyler's childhood.''

   Most Americans are feeling the pinch of an
economic slowdown, but Popeye and Dana Gentry are living high in a
custom-built, two-story gray and white cottage with a shingled roof
and sundeck.
   Popeye and Dana are a pair of 2-year-old Great Danes.
   Their new 8-foot square home is a step up from their old,
smaller living quarters. Although the stairs in the new unit
presented a challenge at first, the dogs have adapted.
   Patrick Gentry, their owner and the builder of the house, said
he plans several improvements.
   ``I'm going to fix it up a little bit better when I get some
more time,'' he said.
   The planned additions include a bay window and insulation for
the winter.
   The dogs like to hang out on the deck, standing on their hind
legs to keep a lookout for cars coming up the long, gravel
driveway, Gentry said.
   He said he got bored with the old building and wanted to build
something unique. His neighbors are divided on the house, he said.
   ``A lot of them like it, and a lot of them think I'm crazy,'' he
said. ``But I don't care. My dogs seem to like it.''

   Three French soldiers captured by Iraqi troops and
freed today will probably be punished for apparently straying over
the Saudi Arabian border into Iraq, a French general said.
   The soldiers arrived in Amman, Jordan aboard an Iraqi Airways
jet, along with four freed American hostages. A Defense Ministry
spokesman said the soldiers would be flown to Paris on Sunday.
   The official Saudi Press Agency cited the Joint Forces Command
for multinational forces in the Persian Gulf as confirming that the
French patrol had accidently crossed into Iraq on Monday.
   The Iraqi troops ``quickly'' took the three to Baghdad and
turned them over to the French Embassy, which is negotiating their
departure from Iraq, French authorities said. They declined to say
when the soldiers were released.
   ``This wasn't a willful act by our soldiers but probably an
error in appreciating particularly difficult terrain where
reference points practically don't exist,'' Brig. Gen. Raymond
Germanos of the Defense Ministry said in an inteview on
France-Inter radio.
   The soldiers will almost assuredly be punished on completion of
a military investigation into the incident, Germanos said.
   ``In the military profession, all faults are punished, and this
fault could have had the most serious consequences,'' He said.
   Germanos ruled out the possibility that the patrol could have
misunderstood standing orders, which explicitly prohibit patrols
from straying too close to the Iraqi border.
   But there were conflicting reports about whether the soliders
were taken by Iraqi troops in Iraq or in Saudi Arabia.
   The Defense Ministry said in a communique late Friday that the
soldiers were captured in the region of Hafar el Batin in
northeastern Saudi Arabia, but did not make clear whether the
incident occurred on Iraqi or Saudi territory.
   Later at a news conference, Germanos said the investigation
would clarify the soldiers' exact location when captured. He said
he did not know what unit they were from.
   A Defense Ministry source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said: ``They committed an error of exceeding their mission. There's
a lot of movement around the border right now and we don't know
exactly what happened. The commander who has opened the
investigation believes they are responsible.''
   Other military sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
the trio was composed of one officer and two non-commissioned
officers in an all-terrain vehicle.   The French soldiers were surprised
by the Iraqi troops but
committed no ``hostile act,'' the French Foreign Ministry said. The
communique did not say how big the Iraqi patrol was.
   There are about 5,500 French soldiers, including paratroopers
and Foreign Legionaires, stationed in Saudi Arabia.
   Defense sources said earlier Friday that France might reinforce
its ground troops in Saudi Arabia with artillery and 500 more
soldiers.
   France has about 13,000 soldiers, sailors and airmen in the
region to defend Saudi Arabia and enforce U.N. sanctions against
Iraq.
   The multinational force of U.S. and other troops in Saudi Arabia
totals about 300,000, facing an estimated 430,000 Iraqi troops in
southern Iraq and Kuwait. The Baghdad government seized Kuwait on
Aug. 2.

   Riots that exploded around a rundown
little mosque in Ayodhya last week threaten the concept of secular
government on which religiously diverse India prides itself. More
than 300 people have been killed.
   The strife comes at a time when Indian politicians, lacking
clear-cut ideologies, are defining their vote blocs by religion.
   Police with shoot-on-sight orders patrolled five northern Indian
towns Saturday after renewed Hindu-Moslem clashes claimed 13 more
lives, the Press Trust of India said. Police also said more victims
were discovered from clashes Friday, bringing the overall death
total to at least 305.
   The issue has shaken Prime Minister V.P. Singh's centrist
government, which gained power 11 months ago. It is in trouble
because it lost the support of the Bharatiya Janata Party, a
right-wing Hindu group. Singh faces a confidence vote Wednesday.
   Singh might soon be deposed or relegated to a caretaker role,
which would leave India limping toward new elections four years
ahead of schedule.
   Both the riots and government crisis were precipitated by the
efforts of Hindu fundamentalists to build a temple where they
believe the god Rama was born, which happens to be under the
Ayodhya mosque. The Bharatiya Janata fervently espoused the temple
project.
   Emboldened by its make-or-break position in the government, the
party claims to speak for India's Hindu majority.
   Its rhetoric, however, often resembles that of an embattled
minority - especially after Singh, a Hindu, tried to halt the
temple project while the courts sorted out conflicting Hindu-Moslem
claims to the site.
   Moslemsare only 12 percent of India's 880 million people and
tend to keep a low profile, especially when it comes to
confrontation with the Hindu majority of 82 percent. Despite this,
they went to court in an effort to save the 460-year-old Ayodhya
mosque, fearing that if it went, others would follow.
   The Moslem suit provoked a tempestuous reaction.
   ``They want to swallow the whole of India,'' said Vijay Kumar
Malhotra, secretary of the Bharatiya Janata and a parliamentarian.
``They have the government siding with them. The Indian home
minister is a Moslem. In India, to be a Hindu has become a crime.''
   A year ago, Indians were anxious for change and weary of
allegations of corruption against Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. They
splintered their vote; nobody won, everyone lost.
   Gandhi's Congress Party got 37 percent of the 522 Parliament
seats, Singh's National Front coalition got 27 percent and the
Bharatiya Janata bounced from near-obscurity to 17 percent. Singh
teamed with the Bharatiya Janata and the Communists to forge a
majority.
   There was little discernible difference in the platforms of
democratic socialism presented by the Congress Party and National
Front, and the Communists stood only slightly to the left.
   Even the Bharatiya Janata's written manifesto was similar to
those of the Congress and the National Front, but its oratory
appealed to a nationalism that increasingly tended toward Hindu
fundamentalism.
   Because Singh's coalition was considered shaky from the start,
everyone started anticipating new elections and staking out
constituencies.
   The Moslems minority can be pivotal in close elections. The
Congress Party and National Front compete for the Moslem vote and
need to win Hindus back from the Bharatiya Janata.
   ``More and more riots are becoming political statements,'' said
Ashis Nandy, a political analyst with the Center for the Study of
Developing Societies, an independent think tank.
   Many analysts say religious blocs have become more important in
the absence of ideological constituencies. Almost any issue, such
as Ayodhya, that entices or placates one group alienates or
threatens another.
   ``Religion is being used as a political tool,'' said Rev. Arokia
Doss, a Jesuit theologian who studies the interaction of India's
different faiths.
   M.J. Akbar, Congress Party spokesman, singled out the Bharatiya
Janata Party for blame in the Ayodhya violence, but added:
   ``You can get freedom by winning a war of independence. A nation
can be formed by a revolution, but the state only stabilizes after
its civil war.''
   Akbar, a Moslem who has written extensively on India's internal
frictions, would not characterize India's current situation as
civil war, but ``a process of confrontation in order to achieve
political power.''
   Although riots and rebellions are frequent in India, it also has
a rich history of nonviolent protest and religious tolerance.
   It broke free of British colonial rule in 1947 through peaceful
protests and strikes led by Mohandas K. Gandhi, revered as the
Mahatma, or ``Great Soul.''
   On the verge of that independence, however, it broke apart on
religious lines and was partitioned into India, predominately
Hindu, and Pakistan, overwhelmingly Moslem.
   There was a bloody transmigration in which 1 million people
died, but nearly as many Moslems remain in India as now live in
Pakistan.
   Memories of those violent days continue to stir Hindu-Moslem
antagonism, but Nandy found one legacy of hope.
   ``Even after a million killed, we could go back to a normal
life,'' he said. ``It left its scars, but one could go back to
civilized living. But that's the optimistic view.''
   The pessimistic view?
   ``Each party will continue to play its own games.''

   An Iraqi Airways flight carrying four sick American hostages
freed by the Iraqi government and three French soldiers captured
this week by Iraqi troops arrived today in Amman, Jordan.
   Also on the flight from Baghdad was a two-man delegation from
the U.S. peace group, Fellowship of Reconciliation, which
negotiated the release of the four Americans.
   French and U.S. Embassy officials meeting the plane said the
Americans and the soldiers would be flown home Sunday morning.
   In Baghdad, the four Americans were identified as Dr. Abdul
Kanji, 50, an Indian-born American from Glencoe, Ill.; Raymond
Gales, a diplomat from the besieged embassy in Kuwait; Michael
Barner, 49, of Woodsworth, La.; and Randall Trinh, 49, of Hacienda
Heights, Calif..
   Trinh had been held at an unknown strategic site in Iraq.
   Iraq's Information Ministry had said Friday the four were being
released because they were ``elderly and sick,'' although it was
not immediately clear what ailments they suffered.
   The French soldiers were turned over to the French Embassy after
their capture Monday. They had arrived at the Baghdad airport today
accompanied by the French charge d'affaires, Andre Janier, who did
not allow them to speak to reporters.
   Janier said Iraq let the soliders leave because ``French
nationals anyway are allowed to leave Iraq.''
   Saddam freed all French citizens last week. But thousands of
Westerners are still being held, many at strategic locations to
deter possible attack by the U.S.-led multinational forces in the
region.
   Amid charges that Iraq is mistreating hostages, the Baghdad
government on Friday allowed reporters to visit some captives being
used as human shields at key sites.
   Humanitarian groups and officials from some countries are
working for the release of the captives, held since Iraq invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2 in a dispute over oil, land and money.
   Former Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone left today for
Baghdad with that mission, and three Irish parliamentarians
traveled to Iraq on Friday to try to win the release of their
countrymen.
   Although Nakasone's trip is private, it has the Tokyo
government's backing. His chartered Boeing 747 carried 6 tons of
food, clothing, medicine, books, letters and personal effects for
Japanese hostages.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was to depart today for a
trip that includes meetings with leaders of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia,
the ousted Kuwaiti government, Egypt, Turkey, Britain and France.
   Baker also is to meet next week with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen.
   The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced today that Qian would
visit Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Egypt next week to discuss the
gulf crisis.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France arrived in Cairo,
according to a source close to Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak.
Mitterrand will meet with Mubarak Sunday on the gulf crisis, the
source said on condition of anonymity.
   Paris indicated the three French soldiers captured by Iraq may
have blundered. A French Defense Ministry spokesman said
disciplinary action was being taken against the men for their ``act
of carelessness,'' indicating the patrol was captured on Iraqi
territory.
   A ministry communique said the soldiers were captured on a
patrol Monday near the Saudi-Iraqi border northwest of Hafar el
Batin, a city in northeastern Saudi Arabia about 50 miles from the
border. The three were turned over to the French Embassy in Baghdad
later in the week.
   France has contributed about 13,000 soldiers to the
300,000-strong multinational force deployed after Iraqa invaded
Kuwait. Saddam's troops then rounded up Westerners, who are being
held in Kuwait and Iraq.
   Western governments have accused Iraq of trying to crack
international opposition to its occupation of Kuwait by selectively
releasing hostages. There are about 1,000 American captives still
in Iraq and Kuwait.
   On Friday, reporters were taken to a strategic site about 60
miles north of Baghdad and interviewed 10 foreigners - American,
Japanese and British - as Iraqi officials stood nearby.
   The captives denied reports they were being underfed or
mistreated by their guards. They said they received messages from
their families over the BBC and the Voice of America radio.
   One American, Charles Keegan, 56, an investment strategist,
said: ``The food is decent. I eat well and I'm treated well.'' His
hometown was not available.
   In recent days, there has been an escalation of claims in the
West that the foreigners are being mistreated. Iraqi officials have
denied the charges.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said that with
the onset of cooler weather in the gulf, U.S. officials had been
trying unsuccessfully for Iraqi cooperation in supplying clothing
and blankets to American hostages.
   The deputy director of the American Red Cross said the
organization is arranging to provide postal services to the
captives.

<HEAD>Two British Satellite Networks To Merge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE LEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of battling, Britain's two satellite
television networks have announced they would merge, pooling their
flagging resources and ending a bitter ratings war.
   The four-channel Sky Television will merge with British
Satellite Broadcasting's five channels to form a new five-channel
network called British Sky Broadcasting, Sky announced Friday.
   ``The merger brings to an end a satellite war with both sides
claiming there can no longer be a loser in the television space
race,'' Sky World News said in a bulletin.
   Sky said the battle had been expensive and acrimonious, with
each network bidding against the other for feature films and sport,
the staples of satellite menus.
   Sky and British Satellite will merge with a combined investment
of $2.43 billion, it said. Media magnate Rupert Murdoch's company,
News International PLC, which owns Sky, and British Satellite's
major shareholders will each hold 50 percent of the new company,
Sky said.
   Sky was launched in February 1989. British Satellite, after a
delayed start, has been broadcasting for just six months.
   Both have been hit by soaring costs, dwindling advertising
revenues and declining British television audiences.
   News International disclosed recently that Sky has been losing
$3.9 million a week. But the Australian-born Murdoch, now a U.S.
citizen, said the company would earn a profit next year.
   According to Continental Research, a media research company, the
number of British homes receiving satellite television exceeded 1
million for the first time at the end of August.
   Sky says there are just over 1 million of its circular receiving
dishes in use. Homes that tap into Sky channels through the cable
network bring the figure to 1.6 million, a potential audience of
5.5 million, a Sky spokeswoman said.
   British Satellite subscribers receive programs via distinctive
square dishes, dubbed ``squarials.'' There are an estimated 100,000
of these in use.
   Britain has a total population of 57 million people.
   Chris McLaughlin, British Satellite's corporate affairs manager,
said Friday the five combined channels will include two movie
channels, available on subscription only.
   Sky's Astra satellite, in orbit above central Africa, will
provide the primary system but there will be ``a lengthy
transitional period during which arrangements will be made to
protect existing subscribers,'' McLaughlin said.
   News International had no immediate comment on the merger.
   Until the launch of Sky, British TV consisted of four land-based
channels: Independent Television and Channel 4, which are both
funded by advertising, and the British Broadcasting Corp.'s BBC1
and BBC2, funded by an annual fee paid by TV viewers.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brenda McCoy's two children had never
gone to school with blacks before. But when their rural district
began accepting students bused from inner-city neighborhoods, they
made some fast friends.
   ``Once you let the kids work it out by themselves, one on one,
there's no problem,'' their mother said.
   Doris Brunson doesn't see it that way. Her suburban district has
refused Kansas City children, despite pleas from judges and
educators trying to desegregate schools. A recent Supreme Court
ruling may finally force the district's hand, and that has her
worried.
   ``It has nothing to do with race,'' the mother of two from
Independence said. The inner-city students could bring drugs, and
they could slow down her childrens' progress, she said. ``We don't
want any more problems than we already have.''
   To Pat Shanks, it's a matter of fairness. She and her husband
moved to the suburb of North Kansas City when they decided to have
a family.
   ``We live here and pay our taxes here. Some of us have to work
two jobs to live in these neighborhoods. The kids who live here
should go to these schools,'' she said.
   In the 13-year history of Kansas City's desegregation case, no
issue has created as much court wrangling, and as few results, as
proposals to send inner-city students to predominantly white
suburban schools.
   So far, only 10 students have made the move - the 10 that came
this fall to Mrs. McCoy's tiny district in rural Missouri City.
   A ruling last Monday by the U.S. Supreme Court increases the
likelihood that more children could be bused out of the city soon.
No figure has ever been set for the number of minority students to
be sent to the suburbs.
   In 1978, a federal judge ruled that five suburban districts on
the Kansas side of the metropolitan area were not guilty of
discrimination and six years later found the same way for 11
districts in Missouri. He dismissed them as defendants in the
desegregation case but asked the districts to take blacks
voluntarily in exchange for tuition from the state. They never did.
   That prompted a lawsuit, filed in 1988 by blacks denied
admittance to three suburban districts in Missouri - Independence,
North Kansas City and Lee's Summit. Because of the Supreme Court
ruling, the case can now go to trial. The suburban districts say
they're weighing the option of settling out of court.
   Part of Kansas City's desegregation effort - attracting whites
from suburban or private schools to special ``magnet'' schools -
has been fairly successful. About 560 new, non-minority students
entered the district this fall, just over half the goal of 1,000
but double last year's number.
   But 74.7 percent of the district's 35,098 students still are
minority. Most educators think the numbers will never balance until
some black students go to other districts.
   Missouri City, with just 105 students in elementary and junior
high, became the first testing ground because its superintendent
thought it was the right thing to do.
   ``It's been very, very successful,'' said superintendent Jay
Jackson. ``Our kids benefit, too, you know.''
   Missouri City's success has reassured other suburban districts,
said George Feldmiller, a lawyer for those districts.
   One of their biggest worries has been that the Kansas City
district, criticized for mismanagement, would try to run their
schools, Feldmiller said. Missouri City prevailed in refusing to
accept the oversight of a Kansas City monitoring committee.
   Many people in the suburbs, and some blacks in the city, say the
real answer is to improve Kansas City's schools.
   The Rev. Nelson Thompson, executive director of the Martin
Luther King Urban Center and president of Kansas City's chapter of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, acknowledges that
many black parents want to send their kids to the suburbs. But he
contends many others agree with him that busing is a bad idea.
   ``They're just going to be put into an environment that is
hostile,'' Thompson said. ``The people in the suburban districts
don't want them there.''
   He said the real issue is the racial quotas a federal judge has
placed on Kansas City's magnet schools. They have resulted in some
black students being turned away from schools in their
neighborhoods.
   ``We're getting sidetracked from the goal of really helping
these black kids,'' Thompson said.

   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France (AP) - Ex-hostage Christian Sergent has
had a good week - freed by Iraq on Monday, married on Saturday.
   The 36-year-old oil technician came home this week along with
261 other French hostages after being held captive by Baghdad since
Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Throughout his captivity, Sergent's biggest fear was that he
wouldn't keep his wedding date with girlfriend Giselle Jummarra,
set for Saturday, her birthday.
   He made it with five days to spare.
   ``I'm crazy with happiness,'' Sergent said Saturday. ``I'm going
to give up smoking.''
   The couple were married in a civil ceremony Saturday in this
university town 470 miles south of Paris. Sergent chose another
ex-hostage, Pierrot Sanchez, as his best man.
   Five other freed hostages attended the wedding.
   Sergent had been in Iraq only one day when President Saddam
Hussein's troops stormed into Kuwait.
   A week later, he was forced to go from an oilfield in the
northern part of Iraq to Baghdad. He spent more than three months
in captivity as part of Saddam's roundup of Westerners. The Iraqi
leader freed the French captives Monday in an apparent attempt to
split the multinational alliance facing him in the Persian Gulf.

   The 1990 elections are a dream come true for
political handicappers. There are 34 Senate races, 36 governor's
contests and 435 U.S. House contests on Tuesday's ballot.
   Here is the outlook for the closest races, according to a
state-by state survey by The Associated Press:
   Alabama - Gov. Guy Hunt, the first Republican elected governor
in the state this century, is bidding for a second term and
narrowly leads Democrat Paul Hubbert.
   Alaska - As a Republican, Walter Hickel was Alaska's second
governor. Now he's back, running as an independent and leading
Republican Arliss Sturgulewski and Democrat Tony Knowles.
Democratic incumbent Steve Cowper is not running.
   Arizona - Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard, a Democrat, leads
GOP developer Fife Symington. Incumbent Rose Mofford, a Democrat,
is retiring.
   California - The big race of 1990, a megabuck contest for
governor between Republican Sen. Pete Wilson and former San
Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. A lot of polling with not much
agreement, but the latest surveys give a hairline edge to Wilson.
The result might have to await a count of absentee ballots days
after the polls close.
   Connecticut - Republican Lowell Weicker lost his Senate seat in
1988. Now he's running for governor as an independent and leading
Republican John Rowland and Democrat Bruce Morrison.
   Florida - Another high-stakes contest for governor. Republican
Bob Martinez was at the top of the Democrats' list of vulnerable
incumbents. Democrats got another boost when former Sen. Lawton
Chiles decided to challenge Martinez. Chiles started out with a big
lead, but it's now very close.
   Hawaii - This usually Democratic state gives the Republicans
their best shot at picking up a Senate seat. Rep. Pat Saiki is
running a strong race against Sen. Daniel Akaka, who was appointed
to succeed the late Sen. Spark Matsunaga. Polls indicate the race
is a tossup.
   Idaho - Republican Sen. James McClure is retiring and Rep. Larry
Craig is favored to defeat Democrat Ron Twilegar in the Senate
race.
   Illinois - Republican Jim Edgar and Democrat Neil Hartigan are
running neck and neck to succeed GOP Gov. Jim Thompson. In the
Senate race, Democrat Paul Simon holds a wide lead over Republican
challenger Lynn Martin. Republicans had high hopes for this one,
but Simon proved stronger than they thought.
   Iowa - Republican Gov. Terry Branstad appears to be holding off
Democratic challenger Don Avenson. Iowans don't tend to re-elect
Democratic senators but Sen. Tom Harkin has a strong chance to
break that tradition. GOP Rep. Tom Tauke is within reach of an
upset but has been unable to catch Harkin in pre-election surveys.
   Kansas - GOP Gov. Mike Hayden looked like a sure loser to
Democrat Joan Finney a month ago. But her hard line against
abortion appears to have hurt her and the race is now a dead heat.
   Kentucky - Sen. Mitch McConnell has led in all pre-election
polls over Democrat Harvey Sloane. But this is a strongly
Democratic state and Sloane is given a chance for an upset.
   Maine - Former Democratic Gov. Joseph Brennan wants his old job
back and is challenging his Republican successor, John McKernan.
Brennan held an early lead, but the race now is a tossup.
   Massachusetts - Home of the voter rebellion. Outsider Democrat
John Silber has the edge over Republican William Weld in the race
to succeed Gov. Michael Dukakis. Sen. John Kerry, fighting to avoid
being swept away by the rage that toppled incumbents in the
September primary, has opened a double-digit poll lead over
Republican Jim Rappaport.
   Michigan - Gov. James Blanchard is having trouble shaking off a
challenge from Republican John Engler. A new poll said Engler was
within 4 points among likely voters.
   Minnesota - Lake Wobegon gone berserk. Democratic Gov. Rudy
Perpich is viewed as potentially vulnerable to Republican Arne
Carlson, who got onto the ballot only five days before Election
Day. Carlson had lost the GOP gubernatorial nomination to Jon
Grunseth, who was forced out of the race a week ago after
allegations he swam nude with two teen-age girls and cheated on two
wives. The fallout from the governor's race is considered a factor
in the surprising vulnerability of incumbent GOP Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz, who's in a dead heat with Democrat Paul Wellstone.
   Nebraska - GOP Gov. Kay Orr once trailed Democrat Ben Nelson but
is now even up. In the Senate race, Democratic incumbent James Exon
appears to be pulling away from former Rep. Hal Daub.
   New Mexico - Former Gov. Bruce King, a Democrat, is leading
Republican Frank Bond, but not by much.
   North Carolina - One of the most watched races in the country is
the Senate battle between Helms and his Democratic challenger,
Harvey Gantt, the black former mayor of Charlotte. Gantt has been
ahead in the polls, but the contest has taken a nasty turn in the
closing days.
   Ohio - One of the best Republican hopes for a gubernatorial
pickup is this contest between Republican George Voinovich and
Democrat Tony Celebrezze to succeed Democratic Gov. Richard
Celeste. The race has tightened in the past two weeks.
   Oklahoma - Democrat David Walters leads Republican Bill Price in
the race to succeed GOP Gov. Henry Bellmon.
   Oregon - Tight races for governor and Senate. Democrat Barbara
Roberts holds a narrow lead over Republican Dave Frohnmayer in the
race to succeed Democratic Gov. Neil Goldschmidt. In the Senate
race, Mark Hatfield was caught by surprise and is in a tight race
with Democrat Harry Lonsdale.
   Rhode Island - The outlook is bleak for GOP Gov. Edward DiPrete,
who trails Democrat Bruce Sundlun by 52 points. In the Senate race,
Rep. Claudine Schneider's challenge to Democratic Sen. Claiborne
Pell appears to have fallen short.
   South Dakota - GOP Sen. Larry Pressler leads Democratic
challenger Ted Muenster.
   Texas - Races don't get much nastier than this contest for
governor between Republican Clayton Williams and Democrat Ann
Richards. Williams once was far ahead, but the race suddenly closed
to a dead heat a week ago.
   Vermont - Former Gov. Richard Snelling once looked like a
landslide winner in his bid to get his old job back. But Democrat
Peter Welch has moved within striking distance.

<TEXT>
   President Bush said today that he
and his wife Barbara were looking forward to sharing Thanksgiving
with troops he has sent to the Persian Gulf.
   Bush, speaking at a Republican rally here, accused Iraq's Saddam
Hussein of being ``the neighborhood bully'' and renewed his
determination to stand firm to drive him out of Kuwait.
   The president indicated that the first lady also would be
joining him on his trip to the Mideast, an eight-day journey that
would include stops in Europe.
   ``Barbara and I are really looking forward to visiting these
young people half way around the world.''
   Bush also planned meetings with his chief allies in the region.
   The White House announced the visit on Friday as Bush continued
a cross-country campaign trip in which he has blended Persian Gulf
rhetoric with partisan politics.
   Bush today planted an oak on the campus of California Lutheran
University and attended a rally for Republican Sen. Pete Wilson,
who is locked in a tight gubernatorial race against Democratic San
Francisco Mayor Diane Feinstein.
   As he planted the tree, Bush praised the recently enacted Clean
Air Act, which he supported. ``I will sign this landmark
legislation as soon as it gets to my desk,'' Bush said.
   Bush had hoped to sign the bill at today's ceremony, but
Democratic congressional leaders - perhaps not wanting Bush to reap
political advantage from the event - are not expected to physically
send him the bill for signing until after the Tuesday election.
   Bush will visit Egypt and Saudi Arabia following a trip to Paris
for the Nov. 19-21 conference to sign a 34-nation treaty on
reducing troops and tanks in Europe, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
announced on Friday.
   While in the gulf region, Bush will consult with Egypt's
President Hosni Mubarak, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the exiled
emir of Kuwait.
   Details for Bush's visit, and whether he will visit sailors on
U.S. ships as well as troops stationed in Saudi Arabia, have yet to
be worked out, said White House spokesman Alixe Glen.
   She said a White House advance team left Washington on Friday
and would not be in Saudi Arabia for several days.
   The president told a GOP rally in Rochester, Minn., ``These are
not easy times. But never have I been more proud of the young men
and women - all volunteers - highly motivated, beautifully trained,
who are serving halfway around the world than I am today.''
   ``And we will not let them down.''
   Earlier, he told a Cincinnati audience: ``I will do my level
best to bring every single one of them home without a shot fired in
anger, but we will not stop short of our stated objectives.''
   Those objectives, Bush has said repeatedly over the past few
days, are a complete unconditional withdrawal by Iraq from Kuwait
and restoration of the government of the emir of Kuwait.
   The United States has more than 210,000 troops in the gulf
region - the largest force sent abroad since the Vietnam war - and
Washington plans to send 100,000 more. About 100,000 soldiers have
been deployed by other nations.
   The 13-nation force - including troops from several moderate
Arab nations - faces about 460,000 Iraqi troops stationed in
southern Iraq and Kuwait.
   Bush today was to attend a rally at California Lutheran
University here for Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who is in a
neck-and-neck race for governor with former San Francisco Mayor
Dianne Feinstein.
   Later he was to speak at an airport rally in Albuquerque, N.M.,
for GOP gubernatorial candidate Frank Bond, a former state
legislator who is battling former Democratic Gov. Bruce Kings'
comeback effort.
   The president was to end the day in Houston, his adopted home
town and his legal voting residence. He will remain in Texas
through Election Day morning.
   For the fourth day in a row, Bush on Friday kept up a verbal
barrage against the Iraqi leader, accusing him of inhumane
treatment of U.S. diplomats and hostages.
   ``The brutality against innocent citizens will not be tolerated
and ... will not stand,'' he told his Minnesota audience. ``And the
world should rise up and demand that those people be let go.''
   The White House would not discuss whether it was concerned that
Saddam might use Bush's visit to launch an attack on U.S. positions
in Saudi Arabia, or any other security concerns.
   ``If we didn't think it was safe, he wouldn't go,'' said an
official, who commented only on condition of anonymity.
   Bush plans to leave Washington on Nov. 16 for Europe and return
from the Middle East on Nov. 23.
   He will stop first in Prague for the Nov. 17 first anniversary
of the nonviolent ouster of the communist government of
Czechoslovakia, and will consult with President Vaclav Havel.
   He then will travel on Nov. 18 to Germany to consult with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl at his summer home in Ludwigshafen.
   Next, in Paris, the president will meet with Gorbachev and other
leaders of the 34-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe. The centerpiece of that summit is to be the signing of a
treaty to reduce conventional forces in Europe.
   He will leave Paris Nov. 20 for Egypt and Saudi Arabia.
   The Paris part of the trip had been previously announced.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meanwhile, left
Washington today on his own diplomatic mission to Saudi Arabia and
Egypt.
   Baker also planned to go to Moscow next week to discuss the gulf
crisis with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of heartbroken Colombians
gathered Sunday to commiserate with fellow losers in love by
singing romantic songs, crying and listening to consoling words
from the governor.
   ``Happy are the heartbroken who know the thresholds of
suffering,'' said Gov. Ernesto Zuluaga of Risaralda state, marking
the First National Conference of the Heartbroken in this small town
in central Colombia.
   Carlos Alfonso Victoria said he and friends organized the
conference to help others who were betrayed in love. He said he
almost committed suicide six years ago after losing his lover and
suffering four other failed affairs.
   On Saturday, about 250 of the dispairing converged on the
specially erected ``Wall of Lamentations'' upon which they wrote
angry verses of frustrated romance.
   ``I'm sick of you and your money,'' said one note, signed only
``Susana.''

   As Northeastern voters prepare to go to the polls
on Tuesday, their mood can best be described as anger - at an
enveloping recession, at record taxes and billion-dollar budget
deficits, and at incumbents.
   ``The three biggest issues are the economy, the economy and the
economy,'' said Thomas Ferguson, a political science professor at
the University of Massachusetts at Boston. ``You're looking at
declining real estate values. And you've got a lot of people losing
their jobs.''
   In Massachusetts and in three Maryland counties, residents will
vote on tax-busting referendums. Incumbents in some hard-hit states
are running for their political lives - and some quit rather than
face the voters' wrath.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts rode his state's
prosperity to the Democratic presidential nomination. But when he
lost, and Massachusetts wnt into a tailspin, he raised taxes and
said he would not run for re-election.
   Democratic Govs. William A. O'Neill of Connecticut and Madeleine
Kunin of Vermont also raised taxes and bowed out of the primaries.
   Still, Republican candidates seized on their unpopularity,
accusing them of budget mismanagement and big spending. Their
Democratic replacements tried to disassociate themselves from the
incumbents they dubbed as political insiders.
   Two incumbent Republican governors, John R. McKernan of Maine
and Edward D. DiPrete of Rhode Island, ran for re-election and
faced tough challenges. The ramaining four incumbent governors who
are up for re-election seem safe.
   Govs. Robert Casey of Pennsylvania and William D. Schaefer of
Maryland, both Democrats, held the line on taxes and both states
declared budget surpluses for the fiscal year ended June 30. New
Hampshire has no income or general sales tax and Republican Gov.
Judd Gregg opposed both.
   Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York appears assured of
winning a third, four-year term despite a record $1.8 billion tax
increase; a state credit rating that is the third worst in the
nation; and a recent poll that found that 56 percent believed New
York was headed in the wrong direction.
   He faces a weak, campaign-bungling opponent, Pierre Rinfret, an
economist and political novice who was chosen when no more
prominent politician agreed to run. And Cuomo has been able to stay
in front of the issues.
   ``He anticipated the economic downturn and began to address it
last January, talking about how the problems in New York were of a
national scope starting from Washington,'' said Lee Miringoff,
director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``He was able to deflect a lot of tension
otherwise laid at his doorstep by talking about national political
leadership.''
   The only question is whether Cuomo can reach or top his record
65 percent of the vote he received in 1986, a boost for a possible
run for the presidency. The tightest races appear to be in
Massachusetts, Maine and Rhode Island.
   In Massachusetts, Democrat John Silber, on leave as president of
Boston University, and Republican William Weld, a former assistant
U.S. attorney general, both campaigned as outsiders who would
return the state's economy to good health. Both defeated their
party's endorsed candidate in the primary.
   Silber opposes ``Question 3,'' a referendum that would roll back
taxes and some fees to their 1988 level. Weld supports it.
   Backers say Massachusetts residents already pay the sixth
highest taxes in the country and that during the last seven years
the Dukakis Administration has increased spending from nearly $7
billion to more than $13 billion.
   If the referendum is approved, opponents say, it would roll back
$1 billion already collected and spent and cost Massachusetts $6
billion over three years, forcing cutbacks in education, programs
for the elderly and other services.
   Referendums in Montgomery, Anne Arundel and Baltimore counties
in Maryland would limit annual increases in property taxes to as
low as 2 percent a year or would peg them to the previous year's
inflation rate. Montgomery County, one of the wealthiest in the
nation, is a suburb of Washington.
   In Maine, U.S. Rep. Joseph E. Brennan, a Democrat, is trying to
unseat the Republican incumbent McKernan. Brennan charged that
McKernan failed to move quickly enough to counter the faltering
economy. Brennan served two four-year terms as governor before
changing offices with McKernan in 1987.
   Rhode Island's DiPrete is in danger of losing the governor's
office to Democrat Bruce G. Sundlun, a millionaire businessman who
is trying to unseat him for the third time. DiPrete reversed
himself on a pledge of no new taxes.
   Lowell P. Weicker Jr., former three-term Republican U.S. senator
who is running as an independent for the Connecticut governor's
seat, is favored to break the Democratic Party's two-decade hold on
the office.
   In Vermont, Republican Richard Snelling, Gov. Kunin's
predecessor, is the favorite to succeed her.
   The only major races in New Jersey and Delaware are for the U.S.
Senate. The Democratic incumbents, Bill Bradley of New Jersey,
often mentioned as a presidential candidate, and Joseph R. Biden
Jr. of Delaware, are expected to win re-election by wide margins.

<HEAD>Catholic Church Admits Partial Responsibility for Sexual Abuse of
Teen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANOKA, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Roman Catholic dioceses have admitted
partial responsibility for psychological injury suffered by a
24-year-old man who was sexually abused by a priest as a teen-ager.
   During opening arguments Friday in a civil trial the man brought
against the priest, the man's attorney said the church placed the
Rev. Thomas Adamson in positions of power and trust, knowing he had
a history of abusing boys.
   John Hoffman, representing the Archdiocese of St. Paul and
Minneapolis, told the jury the church placed restrictions on
Adamson, but the restrictions and the church's monitoring of
Adamson's activities were not effective.
   Hoffman said church officials had information about alleged
contact between Adamson and teenage boys after those restrictions
were imposed, but did not check it out. ``We could have, we should
have, but we didn't,'' Hoffman said.
   Hoffman and George Restovich, an attorney for the Diocese of
Winona, admitted the church was guilty of negligence and said they
will pay damages.
   But they said the dioceses were innocent of willfully employing
an unfit priest.
   Testimony is scheduled to begin Monday in Anoka County District
Court.
   Adamson's attorney said Adamson accepts full responsibility for
his actions and will not deny any of the allegations raised in the
trial.
   The case is only the third case of sexual abuse by a priest to
come to trial in the country, said Jeffery Anderson, the victim's
attorney.
   It is also the first case in which a judge has allowed a sexual
abuse victim to seek punitive damages from the Catholic Church,
Anderson said.
   The case was one of six sexual abuse cases filed against
Adamson, 57, who served parishes in southern Minnesota and the Twin
Cities from 1961 to 1984. Four have been settled and one is
pending.
   Adamson now lives in Wisconsin and no longer functions as a
priest.
   One of his alleged victims, who received an out-of-court
settlement, was convicted earlier this year of attempted
first-degree homicide for traveling to Wisconsin to kill Adamson.
   Anderson said his client, who did not disclose the abuse until
1989, ``can be treated and he may get better, but he will not be
cured.''
   Hoffman and Restovich said the church is not responsible for all
of the man's problems.
   They said he had a personality disorder before the abuse occured
and came from a troubled family.

<TEXT>
   The fifth civilian government in 43
years took power Saturday without ousted Prime Minister Benazir
Bhutto, who led her party in walking out on the new Parliament.
   The 37-year-old Ms. Bhutto and her Pakistan People's Party
boycotted the swearing-in ceremony for the legislature after her
jailed husband, Asif Ali Zardari, was not allowed to attend.
   The right-wing Islamic Democratic Alliance, which routed Ms.
Bhutto in last month's election, took the oath without her.
   Dozens of police carrying nightsticks surrounded the National
Assembly building and forced Ms. Bhutto's supporters across a
tree-lined boulevard.
   Ms. Bhutto initially rejected demands to boycott the opening
session of the National Assembly, the lawmaking lower house of
Parliament. But she walked out after Zardari did not show up for
the ceremony.
   Interior Minister Zahid Safraz said adequate security
arrangements could not be made to bring Zardari from jail in the
southern port city of Karachi to the Pakistani capital.
   Zardari won a legislative seat representing the sprawling
Karachi slum of Lyari in the Oct. 24 elections. He has been in jail
since Oct. 10 on extortion charges.
   Earlier this week, a judge ordered that Zardari be allowed to
take his parliamentary oath.
   Parliament Speaker Malik Miraj Khalid ordered the minister to
bring Zardari to Islamabad for Sunday's legislative session, when
Ms. Bhutto and her parliamentarians were expected to take the oath
of office.
   ``We assume (Zardari) will be brought in and we will take our
oath with him,'' Ms. Bhutto told reporters following her party's
walkout.
   Zardari, 38, has been blamed for many of Ms. Bhutto's troubles
since her government was ousted Aug. 6. He came under fire during
her 20 months in power for allegedly demanding commissions on
lucrative government contracts.
   Less than two years ago, a triumphant Ms. Bhutto was hailed by
many as the torchbearer of democracy. Her populist party won the
largest bloc of votes in the November 1988 elections, Pakistan's
first free polls after more than 11 years of military rule.
   Ms. Bhutto took over the prime minister's seat occupied by her
father before his overthrow 11 years earlier. He was hung two years
later for allegedly killing political foes.
   But only 20 months later, she was fired by President Ghulam
Ishaq Khan, who charged her government with widespread corruption
and political ineptitude that he said had paralyzed Pakistan's
Parliament.
   Ms. Bhutto now faces seven charges of misconduct. If she's found
guilty on even one she can be banished from politics for seven
years.
   Ishaq Khan picked a caretaker government from among her bitter
foes and former allies. Many belonged to the right-wing coalition
that swept the polls last month.
   Ms. Bhutto said the election had been rigged, but most observers
said the fraud was not widespread and would not have changed the
outcome.
   Today, the Pakistan People's Party controls only 45 seats in the
National Assembly compared to the democratic alliance's 105.
   Nawaz Sharif, the alliance leader, said most independent and
smaller parties would fall in line behind his coalition.
   The 41-year-old industrialist will be the next prime minister.
He was the alliance's unanimous choice for the post, which will be
decided by secret ballot in the assebbly next week.
   ``It's a distorted democracy, but it's better than nothing,''
said Iftikar Gilaini, a former law minister in Ms. Bhutto's
Cabinet.

<HEAD>Soldiers Fire Live Ammunition to Quell Riots; Up to 120 Reported
Wounded</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Soldiers firing live ammunition and rubber
bullets fatally shot a Palestinian man and at least 89 people were
hurt in riots set off by the death of an Arab detainee.
   Arab reports put the number of injured in the Gaza Strip
violence at 120, which would make it one of the highest daily
figures during the 34-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   The clashes underscored a rise in Arab-Israeli tensions since
the Oct. 8 Temple Mount killings of 20 Arabs and subsequent
stabbing deaths of three Israelis in Jerusalem.
   The unrest began after soldiers informed the family of Attiyah
Abdel Atti Zanin, 36, in the Gaza village of Beit Hanoun that he
had hanged himself in prison.
   Zanin was detained 13 days ago for questioning about activism in
the Palestine Liberation Organization, Israeli and Arab reports
said.
   His body was found in Gaza City prison Friday night, dangling
from a rope made of blankets, Prison Services spokeswoman Shulamit
Meiri said.
   She said the authorities believed the death was a suicide since
he was alone in a cell and there were no other signs of violence on
the body. But Zanin's family demanded an autopsy to determine the
cause of death.
   Rumors also spread quickly through the village of 11,000 that
Zanin had been killed by soldiers, spurring youths to take to the
streets where they stoned Israeli troops, Arab reports said.
   Troops opened fire, killing Mohammed Izzat Abdullah el
Bassiouny, 36, of a bullet wound to the head, the reports added.
The army said Bassiouny was 29.
   He was the 771st Palestinian to be killed by Israelis in the
uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which are home to 1.7
million Palestinians and some 70,000 Jewish settlers.
   Another 293 Arabs have been killed by fellow Palestinians as
alleged collaborators with Israel, and 55 Israelis and foreigners
have been killed.
   Riots spread from Beit Hanoun to six neighborhoods and refugee
camps in the vicinity of nearby Gaza City, the reports added.
Witnesses said soldiers sprayed tear gas out of helicopters and
used gravel-throwing machines in some spots to contain the
violence.
   The army said 89Palestinians were injured in Gaza, most of them
moderately or slightly injured. The military said the shooting was
in response to ``numerous riots,'' in Gaza.
   Four villages and refugee camps in Gaza were placed under
curfew.
   Arab reports said 102 Palestinians were wounded in these
clashes. Of these, 49 were struck by live ammunition and 48 by
rubber-coated metal bullets, the Arab reports said, citing hospital
officials.
   Another four Palestinians suffered beating injuries. A
4-year-old boy, Zoheir Abu El Nur, of Jebalya, was reported injured
seriously in the head by stones from an army gravel-throwing
machine. He was rushed unconscious to Tel Hashomer Hospital near
Tel Aviv, Arab reports said.
   Violence also broke out later Saturday in Rafah in Gaza's
southern reaches. Assailants threw a firebomb at an Israeli
military patrol and troops opened fire wounding 17 Palestinians,
Arab reports said.

<HEAD>Pope Says Roman Catholic Pharmacists Must Observe Moral Code</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II told Roman Catholic
pharmacists Saturday they have a moral duty to refrain from
providing drugs which can be used, directly or indirectly, against
life.
   In a speech marking the 40th anniversary of the founding of the
International Federation of Catholic Pharmacists, the pope said the
production, distribution and usage of medicines must be controlled
by a ``rigorous moral code.''
   The pope did not specify any drugs, but his comments could have
referred to birth control and abortion pills, and substances used
for euthanasia. Church teaching outlaws artificial birth control,
abortion and euthanasia.
   ``The forms of aggression against life and its dignity are
becoming more numerous, especially with the recourse to drugs,
while these should never be used against life, directly or
indirectly,'' John Paul said in French.
   ``In distributing drugs, the pharmacist cannot renounce the
needs of his conscience in the name of the rigid laws of the
market,'' the pope said.
   ``For the Catholic pharmacist, church teaching on the respect of
life and the dignity of the human person, from the moment of
conception until its last moments, is of an ethical and moral
nature. It can not be subjected to variations of opinions or
applied to the whims of fluctuating options.''
   John Paul acknowledged that pharmacists may find it difficult to
uphold the church teaching, but he stressed ``these fundamental
guidelines cannot be renounced.''

<HEAD>Brundtland Returns to Prime Minister Post for Third Time</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Labor Party leader Gro Harlem Brundtland
returned as Norway's prime minister Saturday and promptly sought
peace with Conservatives who toppled her last two governments.
   Ms. Brundtland took over after the three-party coalition of
former Conservative Prime Minister Jan P. Syse splintered over
disputes on the nation's stance for European trade negotiations.
   ``We have disagreed a lot. Our parties do... But at the same
time there is a lot that we agree on in this very important time
for Norway,'' she told Syse, who resigned Monday after a year in
the post.
   The new government has 63 seats and needs support among the
other five parties in the 165-seat National Assembly to get its
policies approved.
   The Conservatives have twice ousted Ms. Brundtland, but Syse
promised ``a reasonable but determined opposition.''
   Syse's party favors having the six-nation European Free Trade
Association move closer to the 12-nation European Economic
Community. The two trade blocs are discussing possibly opening all
18 nations to unrestricted trade after 1992.
   
   But the Center Party fears possible changes in business laws for
Norway, a member of the European Free Trade Association.
   Ms. Brundtland, 51, said her first tasks were to draft a 1991
national budget and define Norway's position for the ECC talks.
   Ms. Brundtland, a physician and Harvard-educated public health
expert, was formally installed by Crown Prince Harald. He is acting
monarch while his father, King Olav V, recovers from a stroke.
   A popular political figure who is usually called by her first
name, she was greeted outside her new office by hundreds of
Norwegians, many offering her flowers.
   ``Give me a G! Give me an R! Give me an O! We have Gro!''
cheered some admirers.
   Ms. Brundtland will present a government policy declaration
early next week.
   Labor's first test may come in dealing with proposed tax
reductions for higher income families, which the former coalition
parties drafted and still favor.
   ``It won't be any easier than the last time,'' she said about
ruling with a minority government.
   Ms. Brundtland was forced out of office in 1981 after seven
months in office, and again last October after more than three
years in the post. Both times, non-socialists held a majority in
parliament. She was the nation's youngest and first woman prime
minister.
   Some Norwegians criticized Ms. Brundtland for appointing
Thorvald Stoltenberg as foreign minister after he served only 10
months of his five-year term as U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees.
   ``We need his experience as a foreign minister in this very
crucial phase for our government and country,'' said Ms.
Brundtland. Stoltenberg was foreign minister in the last Labor
government.
   Ms. Brundtland said she may recommend Center Party member Tom
Vraalsen to succeed Stoltenberg in the Geneva-based refugee post.

   A man was sentenced to 10 years in prison
for pinching two women on their buttocks.
   Randy Darrell Bowles, 36, was charged with two counts of sexual
battery - which was changed last year from misdemeanor assault and
battery to a felony. District Judge Clifford Hopper sentenced
Bowles to two consecutive five-year terms under a plea agreement
Friday.
   Bowles was accused of grabbing a woman walking in downtown Tulsa
and saying ``tweak'' on Oct. 3. Police said the woman hit Bowles on
the head with her umbrella, and he walked away. Hours later, Bowles
was arrested after another woman screamed and told police he
pinched her.
   Because of Bowles' felony record, he would have faced 20 years
in prison on each charge had he been found guilty. Court records
show Bowles was convicted in 1979, 1981 and 1982 of indecent
exposure.
   Sexual battery became a felony in Oklahoma last November. The
maximum penalty for offenders with no felony record is five years
in prison. The maximum penalty under the old law was 90 days in
jail on each count.

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lt. Col. Walter Minor, a Korean
War veteran who missed Vietnam, is back on active duty in Saudi
Arabia, hoping for peace but ready for war.
   The 59-year-old country doctor from Fuquay-Varina, N.C., is one
of the oldest members of Operation Desert Shield and possibly the
only Korean War vet in an army whose average age is closer to 20.
   ``I didn't get called up. I just volunteered to come,'' he said
Saturday. ``I was in the army back during the Korean War and I've
been in the reserve ever since. In September, I volunteered to come
back for a four-year tour and came over here.''
   ``I thought there was a job over here that needed doing. I
thought I was trained to do it, willing to come and do it. I'd
rather do it than have my kids have to come and do it someday,'' he
said.
   The doctor, who has a son in the army in Fort Wayne, Ind.,
arrived in Saudi Arabia three weeks ago to serve with the Army's
56th Medical Battalion. He flew home late Saturday to attend his
mother's funeral but he said he would definitely be back.
   ``We got good troops out there,'' he said. ``The morale is good.
They're hot and tired and dusty, but they're working hard and doing
a good job. I'm very proud of the boys I've got in my unit.''
   He predicted that the young soldiers' thirst for battle won't
last long if war breaks out.
   ``I don't think the young ones know what combat is,'' he said.
``If they think combat is glorious, they're wrong. ... They'll cool
it in a few days.''
   ``I don't want to see anybody fight. I don't want any Iraqis
hurt any more than I want any American boys hurt,'' he said.
   ``I hope it doesn't start but if it does, that's our job.''
   Minor said being one of the army's old men didn't bother him a
bit.
   Married at age 18, he said his wife was ``a good old trooper''
who accepted his decision to return to the military.
   His biggest complaint was about the slow mail service.
   ``It's a morale factor,'' he said. ``I've been here for three
weeks and I haven't gotten anything yet, and I know my wife is
sending something every day. I talked to her this morning. She has
not received any mail from me yet.''
   While on emergency leave, Minor said, he also plans to vote.
   ``God help the congressman who's raised my taxes,'' he said.
``I've been reading ... that now they won't provide the headstones
for veterans. Yet they can vote themselves their own big salary
increases, and I think that stinks.''

   Tough-guy film star Arnold Schwarzenegger
got mixed reviews on a tour of a suburban shopping mall during a
break from filming ``Terminator II.''
   ``He's a lot more sexy inperson than he is on screen,'' said
Jackie Johnson, 20, of Hayward, after catching a glimpse of the
muscular star in the NewPark Mall in this San Francisco Bay city on
Friday.
   Another woman wasn't happy with his manners.
   ``You could at least say `hi,''' she called to Schwarzenegger,
who didn't respond.
   Schwarzenegger squeezed a couple of tennis shoes and tried on
cowboy hats before security guards escorted him past a group of
waving women and out of the mall.
   Schwarzenegger was filming scenes in nearby Fremont.

   HAMTRAMCK, Mich. (AP) - MTV video jockey ``Downtown'' Julie
Brown pranced, prowled and even pilfered her way through the
Cadillac assembly plant in this Detroit enclave while filming
segments for her cable TV music show.
   Cheered on like a USO entertainer visiting battle-weary troops,
Brown and her camera crews had the run of the General Motors Corp.
facility Friday.
   She chatted with workers and test-drove several Cadillac models.
   ``Too bad I don't know how to drive,'' she said while rolling
off the line in a midnight blue Seville. ``But they've got lots of
these suckers back there so they don't care.''
   Brown, 28, even found wardrobe accessories in the plant. But the
cache of parts she stashed in her jumpsuit were confiscated when
she was frisked by a security guard.
   ``I was going to make earrings out of them,'' Brown said of the
foiled theft.

   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) - Actress Audrey Hepburn, fresh from a
U.N. projects tour in Vietnam, said Saturday that officials are
working hard to ensure the children of that impoverished nation
grow up healthy and well educated.
   ``People-wise, they are doing things right,'' the goodwill
ambassador for the United Nations Children's Fund said.
   Hepburn said she was once on the receiving end of such projects.
   As a teenager in Holland at the end of World War II, she said
she learned firsthand about foraging for food and the difference
international help can make.
   ``I was one of the thousands of kids who got packages of food
and medicine to take home from the Red Cross, UNICEF, CARE - the
three names I remember so vividly,'' she said.

   Now, he says black people need to continue celebrating their
heritage.
   Gossett was the guest speaker Friday at Huston-Tillotson
College's 38th annual charter day anniversary. The day commemorates
the merging of Huston and Tillotson, two predominately black
schools.
   ``It is vitally necessary to celebrate our heritage in the
United States today,'' Gossett told students.
   He also urged the audience to help America's poor and homeless.
Gossett grew up in New York's Brooklyn borough.

<HEAD>Laos Arrests Senior Government Officials For Anti-Communist Acts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police in Laos have arrested two former
deputy Cabinet ministers and another government official for trying
to overthrow the Communist government, its KPL news agency said
Saturday.
   The report, monitored in Bangkok, quoted the Laotian Communist
Party daily newspaper, Pasason, as saying the arrests were needed
to protect national law and order.
   It identified those recently arrested as Thongsouk Saysangkhi, a
former deputy minister of science and technology, Latsami
Khamphtui, a deputy minister of agriculture and forestry, and an
official of the Ministry of Justice.
   It was not clear from the report if the men were occupying their
government posts at the time of their arrests.
   ``The three wrongdoers committed propaganda against the party
and state policy, and conducted activities aimed at overthrowing
the regime and causing political disturbances in Vientiane
municipality,'' the national capital, it said.
   The report was incompletely monitored due to reception problems.
   Laos has been ruled by a rigid Communist autocracy since
December 1975. Its Communist allies and neighbors, Cambodia and
Vietnam, also have cracked down on dissent in recent months amid
worries over the effects of the democratic revolution in Eastern
Europe.

   Two people who rescued a pregnant woman from
an overturned car moments before it exploded are being sued by
another accident victim they didn't have time to help.
   Construction worker James Campbell and police Officer Dale
Turner pulled Norma Macias from her car Jan. 30 just before it was
hit by another car and burst in flames. Two hours later, Mrs.
Macias delivered a 6-pound, 8-ounce girl at a hospital.
   Anzelma Sanchez-Sianez, 17, who was riding in the same car, is
suing Campbell and Turner for negligence. Her lawyer, Paul Jay
Bershin, filed suit Oct. 4.
   Turner was served with the legal papers Thursday as he was going
to the Police Academy to be honored with a Medal of Valor.
   The suit names two other people: Gloria McNeal, whose car hit
the overturned car, then allegedly careened into Sanchez-Sianez as
she was sitting dazed against the center divider; and Mrs. Macias'
husband, Ricardo, who was driving the car when it overturned on the
San Diego Freeway.
   ``I still can't believe this is happening,'' Campbell said. ``I
was trying to save lives.''
   ``If Campbell had not stopped and been a good citizen, I have
absolutely no doubt in my mind all those people would have
perished,'' said Turner, a 20-year Police Department veteran.
   The suit claims Turner, who was en route to work when he saw the
early morning accident, was negligent in ``failing to set up flares
or warnings to oncoming motorists to indicate that an accident had
occurred.''
   The suit also claims Turner and Campbell ``permitted
Sanchez-Sianez to remain in a position of peril on the freeway.''
It's unclear how Sanchez-Sianez, who spent a month in the hospital,
got out of the car.
   According to Bershin, the family has ``a couple of hundred
thousand dollars in medical bills.''
   ``The girl's body looks like a road map,'' he said.
   According to Turner, he and Campbell had only about 60 to 80
seconds to react to the emergency. In the initial moments there was
confusion caused by the pregnant woman screaming about her baby.
   ``The woman (Macias) was screaming for her baby,'' Turner said.
``I was desperately searching in the overturned car for a child,
then I looked at her and realized she was in labor. She was having
her baby.
   ``I saw a vehicle coming, flashing its high and low beams. I
thought, `Good, the CHP (California Highway Patrol) is here to
help.'''
   Until that moment the men thought the overturned car was on the
left-hand breakdown lane. Then they realized it was in the traffic
lane.
   ``I thought, `My God, we're in the fast lane,''' Turner said.
``We grabbed her (Macias') legs and carried her over the divider to
safety. As we turned to lift the girl over, the (McNeal) car hit
the overturned car and careened off, smashing into the divider and
hitting the girl (Sanchez-Sianez).
   ``We moved as fast as we could in that minute,'' Turner said.

<TEXT>
   Special trains carried people from
riot-torn areas near a disputed mosque Saturday as fundamentalist
Hindus debated whether to keep up efforts to seize the site.
   At least 305 deaths have been reported across India in unrest
linked to attempts by Hindus to raze the 16th century mosque and
build a Hindu temple in Ayodhya, about 300 miles southeast of New
Delhi.
   At least 13 people died Saturday in areas around Ayodhya,
including a police constable who had suffered head wounds during
Hindu attempts to storm the mosque Friday.
   Police, meanwhile, arrested a newspaper editor and blocked
distribution of 10 Hindi-language newspapers for allegedly
misreporting the distrubances that have raged since Oct. 24.
   The editor of the weekly newspaper Swatantra Chetna was arrested
on charges of inciting communal violence through exaggerated
reporting, and officials in the city of Varanasi filed court cases
against several dailies, the United News of India agency reported
Saturday.
   All the newspapers are published in Uttar Pradesh state, the
center of the religious conflict. The agency said 200 journalists
who protested the police action in Varanasi were briefly arrested.
   Police with shoot-on-sight orders patrolled five northern Indian
towns under curfew, but did not interfere with people heading
toward the bus and train stations in Ayodhya.
   All rail service to the area was halted last week as part of the
government's effort to keep temple activists from reaching Ayodhya.
Three special trains were dispatched to the town Saturday.
   The sectarian violence has brought Prime Minister V.P. Singh's
11-month-old coalition government to the brink of collapse. Singh,
who faces a confidence vote Wednesday, lost his majority in
Parliament when a right-wing Hindu party withdrew support because
of the Ayodhya dispute.
   In Ayodhya, Hindu leaders debated whether to continue attempts
to take control of the 460-year-old mosque, which they claim was
built on the foundation of an early temple marking the birthplace
of the god Rama.
   Moslems dispute the history and say relinquishing the mosque
would jeopardize hundreds of other Moslem sites.
   Leaders of the World Hindu Council, the group leading the
temple-building project, are split over the best tactic to pursue
next.
   Nritya Gopal Das, an Ayodhya priest and a local leader of the
council, has been asking people to leave town, saying they had
achieved victory Tuesday when they stormed the mosque and pried a
few bricks from its walls and chipped concrete from the domed roof.
   But a national leader of the council, general secretary Ashok
Singhal, has been urging people to stay until the temple is
constructed.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people, while
Moslems comprise 12 percent.
   In Bangladesh, authorities relaxed curfews in the capital of
Dhaka and Chittagong for 10 hours Saturday after several days of
anti-Hindu riots across the predominately Moslem nation.
   At least four people have died and more than 400 were injured in
the violence that started Tuesday in Bangladesh.

<HEAD>Senators Urge Bush to Lift Trade Embargo on Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Republican and five Democratic senators
have urged President Bush to lift the U.S. trade embargo on
Vietnam, saying it has outlived its usefulness and is penalizing
American business in the face of foreign competitors, particularly
from Japan and France.
   ``Trade with Vietnam would foster American interests across the
board,'' according to a letter to the president signed by the eight
lawmakers.
   The letter, drafted by Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., and sent to
Bush a week ago, argued: ``In recent months the United States has
become increasingly isolated in its maintenance of the economic
embargo against Vietnam. European and Asian businesses are now
enjoying unilateral advantages. Some of the most promising
construction and development contracts have already been
committed.''
   The letter noted that ``the government of Vietnam now estimates
that $1.15 billion worth of foreign capital has been committed to
investment projects in Vietnam. Once again, the United States risks
forfeiting a market to our foreign competitors.''
   Others signing the letter were Democrats Claiborne Pell of Rhode
Island, Alan Cranston of California, Joseph R. Biden Jr. of
Delaware, John F. Kerry of Massachusetts and Christopher J. Dodd of
Connecticut; and Republicans Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska and Mark
O. Hatfield of Oregon.
   The embargo was imposed on North Vietnam in 1964, and extended
to the entire country after the Communists seized Saigon in 1975.
Violators face penalties of up to $1 million and 10 years'
imprisonment.
   The U.S. government's resolve on the issue was stiffened in
1978, when Vietnam invaded its neighbor Cambodia to overthrow the
brutal Khmer Rouge government there. The Khmer Rouge and two
non-Communist guerrilla factions supported by the United States
have been fighting the government that Vietnam installed ever
since.
   U.S.-Vietnam relations also have been snagged over the U.S.
effort to recover the remains of soldiers killed in the Vietnam War
and to account for 1,677 Americans still officially listed as
missing in action.
   But Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach recently pledged
heightened cooperation on that issue. The new policy allows for a
permanent U.S. team to operate in Hanoi to coordinate the search
effort.
   Moreover, Vietnam has withdrawn most of its forces from
Cambodia, and administration officials have credited Hanoi with
cooperating with a U.N.-sponsored plan to organize elections and
end the civil war there.
   Citing those developments, business groups have argued for weeks
that the political justifications for the embargo have largely
vanished. In any case, they say, it is having no significant
effect, because European and Asian companies are moving into
Vietnam in growing numbers.
   ``It's another example of America seeking to further foreign
policy interests by penalizing American companies and at the same
time not achieving the foreign-policy goals,'' said William Archey,
vice president for international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce.
   But so far, such arguments have fallen on deaf ears in the Bush
administration, although it is cautiously expanding contacts with
Vietnam after 15 years of a nearly total freeze. An aide to Lugar,
Andrew K. Semmel, said Saturday the White House had yet to respond
to the Senate group's letter. ``And that's not surprising,'' he
said. ``There are a lot of different opinions within the
administration itself on this.''
   In a July policy shift, the administration dropped its
diplomatic support for the guerrilla coalition in Cambodia. But it
has continued to grant noncombat assistance to the two
non-Communist rebel groups loosely aligned with the Khmer Rouge,
which was responsible for the deaths of at least a million
Cambodians during its four years in power.
   Many Western countries still maintain sanctions against Vietnam.
But most interpret them more liberally than does the United States,
particularly in regard to oil.
   European oil companies have signed deals to develop offshore
deposits discovered by an American firm, Mobil Oil Corp., in the
early 1970s. Several Japanese trading companies have set up shop in
Vietnam, as have French banks and textile makers from Singapore and
Canada.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., eager for customers among
the 700,000 Vietnamese-born residents of the United States, has
twice sent teams to Vietnam and concluded  long-distance
phone-service deal with the government there. But the State
Department has withheld approval.
   Other U.S. corporate delegations continue to visit Vietnam to
prepare for the time the embargo is removed. Among the visitors
this year were representatives of Mobil, the Chevron Corp. and
Texaco, Inc. Other American firms are exploring mining, fishing,
tourism and agricultural prospects.
   Even when - and if - the embargo is lifted, no one expects a
bonanza. Exhausted by decades of war and mismanagement, Vietnam
remains one of the world's poorest and most technically undeveloped
nations. Its 67 million people also face the additional challenge
of a phaseout of the Soviet aid that has helped keep the country
afloat.
   But some analysts believe that if it stays with free-market
reforms it has begun, Vietnam could emerge in the long run as a
solid economic performer, as have many of its neighbors in
Southeast Asia. It is sometimes compared to China 10 years ago.

   President Bush, after raising a record $86
million for Republicans this year, was spending the final days
before Tuesday's elections searching for candidates to help and
themes to sound.
   Both seemed difficult to find.
   The president's final campaign extravaganza was sharply pared as
he planned to devote his final energies to helping GOP
gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams in Texas, Bush's adopted
home state.
   Bush tinkered through the final week with his basic stump speech
- first bashing Democrats and accusing them of making him swallow
tax increases, then dropping that approach to fire verbal salvos at
Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Bush was to spend Saturday, Sunday and Monday nights at his
legal voting residence - a hotel suite here - with a planned foray
around the state Monday to drum up support for Williams in his
close race with Democrat Ann Richards.
   The president will vote here Tuesday, then return to the White
House to await election returns.
   ``Have plane, will travel'' was Bush's theme as he took the
prestige of the presidency to 112 campaign events from the
beginning of his term through Saturday, raising $85.6 million for
GOP candidates in 35 states.
   ``We go to places where they ask us and where we can make a
difference,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   But, finally, Bush ran out of places. And campaigning became
unlike any he had encountered, with some candidates holding him at
arm's length and others repudiating his stand on the budget and
taxes from the very podium on which he stood.
   Stops planned for the past few days in Oregon, Illinois,
Nebraska and Arizona were scrubbed. In each of those states, the
governors' races were considered too close to call, as was the
Senate race in Oregon, according to an Associated Press survey.
   Even Bush's revised plan to spend Sunday making video
appearances at rallies around the nation was scrapped.
   David Carney, White House political director, said the major
emphasis in the final days of the campaign was firing up Republican
troops to get out the vote.
   Asked if Tuesday's election is a referendum on Bush, Carney
said, ``absolutely not. It's a mid-term election. It's impossible
to say it's a referendum on the president.''
   ``Mid-term elections are decided district-by-district,'' Carney
said.
   The White House said the President on Sunday planned to make
phone calls from his Houston suite to rallies for congressional
candidates in Alaska, Utah, Nebraska, and Maryland.
   ``At one time, there were 20 or 30 potential locations'' for
Bush's final week, said Norman Cummings, political director of the
Republican National Committee. Instead, Bush will have 11 events in
six days.
   Cummings said the inability of local campaigns to shoulder the
cost of a presidential visit so close to Election Day was a key
factor in canceling many proposed appearances.
   Another problem is the new Air Force One, a Boeing 747 jumbo jet
that turns out to be too heavy to land on many American airport
runways.
   ``There are three values of a presidential stop: raising money,
pumping up the trip and the attendant publicity and local TV
coverage you get,'' Cummings said.
   But even a presidential visit doesn't ensure a GOP victory.
   ``The presidential popularity doesn't win or lose elections
other than the presidency,'' Cummings said. ``We didn't have these
races in the bag when he was at 80 percent and they aren't in the
bag when he's at 60 percent.''
   With his popularity plunging, Bush suddenly found himself more
of a liability than a help to some candidates, particularly in
states where taxes were a heated issue. Polls have shown Bush's
approval rating dropping to as low as 55 percent in the aftermath
of the budget debacle.
   At the same time, the two campaign veterans who had engineered
his 1988 presidential victory - Secretary of States James A. Baker
III and Lee Atwater, head of the Republican National Committee -
were unavailable to give him much day-to-day guidance.
   Baker has been preoccupied with the Persian Gulf crisis and
U.S.-Soviet relations; Atwater has been sidelined with an
inoperable brain tumor.
   So, much of Bush's political advice in the past few weeks has
come from chief of staff John Sununu, fresh from the budget and tax
talks that have proved such difficult political terrain for the
president.
   Sununu has had the final say - other than the president himself
- on both the message of Bush's campaign speeches and his
itinerary.
   The past week has seen a succession of new messages.
   In Oklahoma on Monday, Bush unleashed a blistering attack on
Democrats, seeking to shift the blame for the budget debacle to
them. Aides said it would be the theme he would carry through
Election Day.
   But then, abruptly, he dropped it, toning down his attack on
Democrats and turning it up on Saddam.
   Thursday, he was accusing Saddam of being worse than Hitler in
some respects - a statement some Jewish leaders said went too far.
   By Friday, Hitler was out of the speeches.
   But the president was able to keep the focus on the Iraq
confrontation - and away from the tax fiasco - day after day,
through Friday's announcement that he would spend Thanksgiving with
U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf.
   Why did Bush stop his most strident bashing of Democrats on the
budget?
   ``It's not a change of heart. It's a question of - I think I
made my point,'' he said.
   But Bush told reporters in Orlando, Fla., on Friday to stay
tuned:
   ``I think it's a little too early to say that there will be no
more flamboyant rhetoric about the Democrats because I'm absolutely
convinced if we had more Republicans, things would be a lot
better.''

   An anti-apartheid lawmaker,
Harry Schwarz, will take over early next year as South Africa's
ambassador to the United States, the government announced Saturday.
   Schwarz is a member of Parliament from the opposition Democratic
Party. He will succeed Piet Koornhoof, whose term expires in
January.
   The Democratic Party is a small party that holds little power in
the dominant white chamber of Parliament, which is controlled by
the governing National Party.
   ``After a political career in which I have always been in
opposition politics and opposed to apartheid, I find that what I
have fought to achieve is now being realized,'' Schwarz said.
   ``The government has full confidence in Mr. and Mrs. Schwarz's
ability to represent South Africa and all its people in a dignified
and capable way,'' Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha said.
   Schwarz said he believed he could serve all South Africans in
his new position.
   President F.W. de Klerk has promised to end the apartheid system
of racial segregation and white dominance. He is also seeking the
lifting of international sanctions imposed on South Africa in
protest of apartheid.
   De Klerk visited the United States last month, and President
Bush praised his reform efforts.
   Schwarz is considered a financial expert for the Democratic
Party and was part of a South African delegation at the
International Monetary Fund conference in Washington in September.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party began its
congress Saturday hoping to remake its image, but a bomb threat and
a strike of conference hall workers marred the event.
   The staff of Prague's Palace of Culture, the traditional site of
party caucuses, walked off the job to protest the congress. The 868
delegates opted to meet in another location Sunday, when the
meeting is scheduled to end.
   An anonymous caller said a bomb had been planted at the congress
site, interrupting the meeting for an hour. Police searched the
hall but found nothing.
   In its first day, the congress decided to form a Federation
Council to coordinate work of the Czech and the Slovak parties over
the next two years, as well as any other political party wishing to
join the federation in the future.
   There was also balloting for leadership roles within the
Communist Party.
   Miroslav Grebenicek, 43, a newcomer to the party leadership,
defeated former chairman Vasil Mohorita to become the Czech
candidate for the party chairmanship, the official news agency CTK
reported.
   The vote appeared to confirm the party's attempt to shed the
image of Communist orthodoxy. Mohorita was close to the government
of Milos Jakes before the country's peaceful revolution ousted
Communists from power in November 1989.
   But later, Grebenicek openly endorsed rival Slovak candidate
Pavol Kanis and the final vote for the party's top post - to take
place Sunday - seemed a foregone conclusion.
   ``I think Mr. Kanis is much more qualified for the job than I,
and I will be happy with remaining the number two for the time
being,'' Grebenicek said at a news conference Saturday.
   According to new rules, the two leaders will alternate the
chairmanship every two years.
   Jiri Svoboda, a well-known film director leads the Czech
Communist party, while Peter Weiss, an established left-wing
reformer, heads the Slovak party.
   Establishment of the Federation is also a strong signal to other
Czechoslovak left-wing groupings to cooperate as genuine political
pluralism develops.
   In spite of running second in the country's free elections in
June, Communists were kept out of the current government coalition.
   Earlier this week, the Left Alternative, headed by veteran
dissident Petr Uhl, and Obroda (Renewal), another left-wing group
in Civic Forum - the country's leading political grouping - were
expelled from the movement for ``not abiding by its political
viewpoints,''
   The move was seen as an attempt by Civic Forum's new chairman
Vaclav Klaus to transform the loose democratic alliance into
several clear-cut political parties after parlimaentary elections
in 1992.
   ``Our program has a lot to do with some left-wing oriented
groups in the Civic Forum,'' Kanis toold journalists Saturday. ``To
think civic intiatives can replace political parties is
premature,'' he said.
   The Communists gained 13.5 percent of the vote in the June
elections. But their membership has been shrinking, reaching a
record low of 450,000, analysts have said.

<HEAD>Brando Murder Case on Verge of Trial as Sister Recovers From
Overdose</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The privacy actor Marlon Brando
attained at his hilltop mansion has dissolved in the five months
since his pregnant daughter's lover was shot to death there.
   Brando's son, Christian, is about to go on trial for murder and
the troubled life of his daughter, Cheyenne, has taken center stage
as she recovers from a drug overdose in a Tahiti hospital.
   Miss Brando, 20, is the key witness to events which led to the
death of 26-year-old Dag Drollet. But she fled to Tahiti a month
after the killing, gave birth to a child and has refused to return
to testify.
   Authorities in Tahiti also have barred her exit from the island,
charging her as an accomplice in the murder.
   Marlon Brando flew to Tahiti Friday to be with his daughter.
   Christian Brando's trial was scheduled to start Monday, but the
international legal tangle concerning Miss Brando's testimony has
caused a delay. Prosecutors say they can't win the case without her
testimony.
   The 2nd District Court of Appeal blocked the trial but could let
jury selection begin Monday or seek more time to study the case.
   Christian Brando's lawyer, Robert Shapiro, said Cheyenne's drug
overdose would further delay the trial.
   ``This has put a damper on everything,'' Shapiro said. ``The
concern of everyone is for Cheyenne's health and recovery and the
criminal case seems less important.''
   Drollet was found sprawled on a sofa at the Brando home with a
single bullet wound in his cheek on May 16.
   Police said he had a TV remote control in one hand and a
cigarette lighter in the other hand. Brando's defense team disputes
that report and has hired forensic experts to recreate the death
scene.
   Christian Brando told police the killing was an accident.
   ``I shot him, man, but not on purpose,'' he said.
   At another point he was quoted as saying, ``I did it because he
hurt my sister.''
   Christian Brando also told police he did not like Drollet,
saying ``death is too good for the guy.''
   Before Miss Brando left the country, she told police, ``It's a
murder, in case you don't know it.''
   Prosecutors say Christian Brando decided to kill Drollet because
he had been physically abusing his sister. He is charged him with
premeditated first degree murder. They intend to introduce as
evidence information about his past and his involvement with guns.
   But Shapiro said his client is guilty of no more than
involuntary manslaughter. He suggests the gun accidentally went off
when Christian and Drollet fought over it.
   Miss Brando's version of events has never been clear. She has
given at least five depositions in the United States and Tahiti.
   In one deposition, she accused her father of complicity, saying
Marlon Brando ``was fixated with the Godfather and that he was
crazy on the subject.'' She later retracted that statement.
   Cheyenne's life has been a focus of attention from the start of
the Brando affair.
   The young woman was said to be emotionally disturbed, drug
addicted and still suffering the effects of a near fatal auto
accident in 1989 which smashed her face.
   She was seven-months pregnant the day Marlon Brando dialed 911
to tell police there had been a shooting at his Mulholland Drive
mansion.
   Marlon Brando is expected to testify at his son's trial.
   The attorneys' first chore will be to find jurors unaffected by
the blitz of publicity that has surrounded the case.
   ``I think that will be impossible,'' Shapiro said. ``I can't
imagine anyone in this community who hasn't heard about this
case.''
   ``This whole thing has got this star quality. It has an aura
around it,'' Deputy District Attorney Steven Barshop said. ``I
think there will be a lot of people who want to sit on a jury like
this because they think it's exciting.''

   Launching a fast-paced trip to seven
countries, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Saturday he
would ``lay the foundation'' for military action against Iraq if
economic measures failed to persuade Saddam Hussein to withdraw
from Kuwait.
   Baker planned to consult over eight days with leaders of a wide
array of Arab and European nations, including a stop next Thursday
in Moscow to see Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``We would like to know under what conditions and subject to
what restraints they would be willing to consider certain types of
actions,'' Baker told reporters aboard his U.S. jetliner.
   ``The purpose of the trip,'' Baker said, ``is to discuss with
our coalition partners strengthening the full range of measures
that w have employed to isolate Saddam Hussein ... political
measures, economic measures and military measures, and thereby to
lay the foundation for the possible exercise of all options.''
   Baker added: ``this will improve the prospects for peaceful
resolution, and, at the same time, permit us to be prepared to
consider all options if peaceful ones don't work.''
   Baker also stressed the United States had the right of
self-defense under the U.N. charter. President Bush has been
pointing in that direction recently with angry denunciations of the
Saddam, the Iraqi president, for taking more than 100 Americans
hostage and blocking food and other supplies from reaching the U.S.
Embassy in Kuwait.
   Bush said last week that in some ways Saddam has been more
brutal than Nazi Germany's Adolph Hitler, who ordered mass
exterminations during World War II.
   Baker's silver and blue plane, packed with senior White House,
Pentagon and State Department officials, stopped here for refueling
before flying on to Bahrain where Baker will hold talks Sunday with
Sheik Isa bin Salman al-Khalifa and other leaders of the Persian
Gulf mini-states.
   From there he moves on to Saudi Arabia, where more than 100,000
U.S. ground troops are defending the world's richest oil-fields. He
will see Saudi leaders and also the ousted Emir of Kuwait, Jabir
al-Sabah.
   Before returning home next Saturday, Baker will have consulted
with Soviet, Chinese, British and French officials and others.
   Together with the United States, these nations are the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
   Baker did not rule out an escalation of the economic and
political pressures the United States and most of the rest of the
world have put on Saddam since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   But, like the president of late, Baker put increased stress on
military action even while declining to say what specifically the
administration has in mind. An escalation of bellicose rhetoric
from Bush, Baker and John Sununu, the president's chief of staff,
has heightened a sense of expectation that military force may be
used to try to pry Kuwait away from Saddam.
   Bush said he had ``had it'' with Iraq's treatment of American
hostages and diplomats. On Thursday he said, ``I don't think the
status quo can go on forever.''
   On the other hand, the president also told reporters in Orlando,
Fla., that ``I'm not trying to sound the tocsin of war.'' And on
Friday, he said his hope was that U.S. forces in the Persian Gulf,
now more than 210,000 strong, can return home ``without a shot
fired in anger.''
   Amid the buildup in tensions, the Soviet Union, Saudi Arabia,
France and others have adopted a softer tone, with an emphasis on
finding a channel to negotiate with Saddam. The Saudis also have
indicated a willingness to strike a compromise.
   Baker said the Soviets were committed to full implementation of
the 10 resolutions adopted by the Security Council against Iraq.
Beyond that, Baker said he would reserve any comment until he saw
Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze in Moscow.
   He said he would report his findings to President Bush on his
return.
   Asked if Saddam understood the possibility of an attack to
loosen his grip on Kuwait, Baker said ``You are dealing with
someone who is very difficult to predict, so I can't read his
mind.''
   And yet, Baker added, ``I think we have made it extraordinarily
clear we are unwilling to rule out the use of force. I think most
people believe that.''
   Baker will stop in Cairo on Tuesday to meet with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, a staunch ally in the campaign against
Iraq. While there he also will meet with Chinese Foreign Miniser
Qichen Qian.
   Baker's other stops are Turkey, Britain and France. He is due to
return to Washington next Saturday, take a breath, and get ready
for another spate of overseas travel, attending a 34-nation summit
meeting in Paris Nov. 19-21, visiting the troops in the gulf with
Bush over Thanksgiving, and accompanying the president to South
America in early December.

   A Wire Service Guild official said Saturday
the union will recommend members turn down a United Press
International request that employees take a temporary 35 percent
pay cut as a preliminary to sale of the financially struggling news
service.
   Chris Dahl, secretary-treasurer of guild, said the UPI proposal
for a 90-day pay cut would be submitted to union members for a
vote, but ``we will recommend rejection.''
   Dahl said ``things are so desperate at this point we don't think
this (wage cut) will be enough either. The situation is very bleak
unless UPI can come up with a buyer very fast.''
   Dahl said UPI officials made the request for the 35 percent cut
during eight hours of negotiations in Philadelphia on Friday
attended by Dahl and guild president Kevin Keane. The meeting ended
without resolving the wage issue.
   ``It's not a bitter situation at all,'' Dahl said in a telephone
interview from New Haven, Conn. ``We'd love to see the company stay
afloat, but I'd be lying if I said we were optimistic.''
   UPI's negotiations with the guild coincided with UPI's
announcement Friday that all management and employees not covered
by the guild contract will have their wages cut by 35 percent over
the next three months. The pay cuts take effect Sunday.
   The Washington-based news service also changed company policy so
that non-union employees could be dismissed without advance notice
or severance pay.
   UPI spokesman Milt Capps on Saturday declined to reveal details
of negotiations between the news agency and the guild, but said
``We are asking support from both non-guild and guild members'' in
the organization's latest economy moves.
   UPI Executive Vice President Pieter Vanbennekom, in a message to
all members of the staff Friday, said ``All these drastic measures
are necessary to bring UPI immediately to cash flow
self-sufficiency and to stabilize the company during the next few
months to be able to effect a sale of UPI in the shortest possible
order.''
   The news service has changed ownership three times in the past
eight years and is now owned by Infotechnology Inc. Last week,
Infotechnology announced a management shakeup and disclosed
financial problems that could result in the sale of its businesses.
The company also owns Financial News Network.
   In September, UPI announced that it was closing bureaus in five
states and said Oct. 21 that it will dismiss an unspecified number
of employees as it concentrates its reporting in 15 of the most
populous states.
   Dahl said UPI did not propose additional layoffs. ``They are so
hand-to-mouth at this point that layoffs aren't the answer.''
   He said the guild will recommend rejection of the 35 percent
wage cut because ``we're already down to bone as it is.'' He noted
that the guild accepted a 25 percent reduction in salaries during a
1984 financial crisis.
   Dahl said UPI has about 250 union members. It has another 600
non-union employees, including about 100 who are covered by the
guild contract. Ballots will be mailed to union members on Tuesday,
and results of the vote should be made known around Nov. 16, Dahl
said.
   Capps said UPI also may ask news organizations that buy its
services to accept higher rates.
   Vanbennekom said in his staff memo that there have been at least
six preliminary expressions of interest in buying UPI, some from
``blue-chip companies.''
   ``To bring the process to a successful conclusion, we need the
breathing space these measures will provide,'' he said.

   Will Rogers, who never met an outlet for
his humor that he didn't like, including the movies, will begin
playing to modern audiences come spring when four of his comedies
are released on video.
   Officials from 20th Century Fox and CBS-Fox Video announced the
release of the four video cassettes Friday during the Will Rogers
Days celebration that commemorates the Oklahoma native's birth.
   Rogers, who died in 1935 in an Alaska plane crash, made 75
movies, 21 with sound.
   The four movies to be released are ``Ambassador Bill,'' ``A
Connecticut Yankee,'' ``Mr. Skitch'' and ``Doubting Thomas.''
   James Griffiths, senior vice president for 20th Century Fox,
said they were among 2,000 classics the company has stored in its
California movie library.
   ``To flood the market at any point in time wouldn't be good for
the films,'' he said. ``But sometimes we need a kick in the butt to
remind us what we have here.''
   He got the kick from Rogers' son, Jimmy, who said he has
regretted since ``Dad went to the happy hunting ground'' that his
father's career as an actor is frequently forgotten.
   ``Nobody remembers him as an actor,'' Rogers said. ``You hear
very little about his career in the movies. If you ask dad what his
career was, I think he would have said he's an actor.''
   Some of Rogers' movies now are shown at the Will Rogers Memorial
in Claremore, and Jimmy Rogers said he can tell people still like
them.
   ``You go in there when there's quite a group of people watching
and I tell you, there's a lot of laughter,'' Rogers said. ``They're
funny. They're great stuff.''
   Mindy Pickard, a spokeswoman for CBS-Fox Video, said the movies
being released were selected because they were timeless.
   She said ``Doubting Thomas'' is a ``classic battle of the
sexes'' and ``Ambassador Bill'' is a political satire.
   ``They're all comedies. They all hold up,'' she said. ``We
picked films that had relevancy to us today.''
   Griffiths said he anticipated more movies would be released in
the future.
   Rogers was famous for many aphorisms, including his oft-cited -
and oft-misquoted - epitaph:
   ``I joked about every prominent man in my lifetime, but I never
met one I didn't like.''

<HEAD>Opponent Crashes Hatfield News Conference, Asks for Debate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD GREEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Mark Hatfield's opponent
crashed one of his news conferences and got in the last question by
asking Hatfield to debate him Sunday.
   Hatfield, who has refused such requests from Democrat Harry
Lonsdale, walked away without responding.
   ``I'm conducting a press conference, not a circus,'' Hatfield
said later when asked what he thought about Lonsdale's visit
Friday.
   When Lonsdale appeared, Hatfield stumbled over his words before
regaining his composure.
   Lonsdale stood silently as Hatfield criticized Lonsdale again
for supporting Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh in 1985 after the Indian guru
pleaded guilty to federal crimes. Lonsdale's claim that he was
merely defending religious freedom doesn't wash, Hatfield said.
   ``The issue isn't religious freedom, it's a question of
judgment,'' he said.
   Lonsdale later criticized Hatfield for witnessing a shooting
last year in Washington, D.C., and failing to report to police.
   ``As a citizen he had an obligation. As a senator he had no
excuse,'' Lonsdale said. ``We all make mistakes and do things we
regret. But Mark Hatfield should reflect on his own failings before
he criticizes my judgment.''
   At a separate news conference, Gary Kahn, Lonsdale's campaign
counsel, called for a three-county task force to investigate a
burglary at Lonsdale's home last week.
   ``What appears to be a politically motivated crime of this
nature is unprecedented in the history of Oregon politics,'' Kahn
said. ``For this reason, the Lonsdale campaign is today asking for
a special task force to be set up.''
   The Deschutes County sheriff's office said the investigation has
failed to turn up any suspects. Kahn stressed he was not accusing
the Hatfield campaign of committing the burglary.
   Julie McGregor, a spokeswoman for Hatfield, said the senator
feels that ``it's unfortunate that such a crime should occur so
close to an election, but it's equally unfortunate that Lonsdale is
trying to lay blame on Hatfield supporters.''
   He said files were ransacked during the burglary and a copying
machine at Lonsdale's home was used extensively during the crime.
Among the items taken in the burglary late Tuesday or early
Wednesday were a computer and computer disks containing financial
information on Lonsdale campaign contributors.
   Also taken were video and stereo equipment, a typewriter and a
telephone. A kitchen door was forced open to gain entry to the home
12 miles west of Bend.
   A preliminary sheriff's investigative report on the burglary
said clues found at the scene included foot prints, tire tracks, a
cigarette butt and two threatening calls left on the Lonsdale
answering machine before the crime.

<HEAD>Quake-Proofing Design Study Set for Golden Gate Bridge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Golden Gate Bridge made it through the
big 1989 earthquake without any apparent damage, but bridge
directors think a $100 million quake-proofing project would be a
wise investment.
   ``Quite frankly, that's a good bargain,'' said director Jim
Harberson.
   He said replacing the 53-year-old Golden Gate would cost about
$1 billion.
   A committee of bridge directors voted Friday to spend $550,000
for a design study on a project that would srengthen the bridge so
it can withstand an earthquake with a Richter scale magnitude of 8
or greater.
   The retrofitting project would cost $75 million to $100 million,
and financing remains ``the big question,'' Harberson said.
   The October 1989 earthquake registered 7.1 on the Richter scale
and claimed 67 lives. It knocked out a section of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.

<HEAD>Boschwitz Leads Wellstone in Latest Poll</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz has
increased his lead over challenger Paul Wellstone, according to a
poll published Saturday.
   The Pioneer Press-WCCO poll indicated that 49 percent of 760
likely voters polled last week preferred Boschwitz, while 40
percent favored Wellstone. Eleven percent were undecided, and the
margin of error was 4 percentage points.
   A Star Tribune-KSTP-TV Minnesota Poll published Oct. 24 showed a
closer race. That poll found that 48 percent of those questioned
chose Boschwitz compared with 45 percent for Wellstone. The margin
of error was 4 percentage points.
   Boschwitz has felt the backlash of voter discontent in the wake
of problems that plagued Republican gubernatorial hopeful Jon
Grunseth. Grunseth withdrew from the race after allegations that he
swam nude with teen-age girls in 1981.
   Democrat Wellstone began the campaign as a little-known college
professor and activist, but benefited from the Grunseth fallout.
Wellstone has tried to exploit a nationwide anti-incumbent mood.
   Boschwitz has labeled Wellstone a big-spending liberal whose
proposals would cost the taxpayers an additional $600 billion a
year and derail federal budget-balancing efforts.

   Republican Sen. Bob Packwood of Oregon
doesn't want to be a part of Democratic Sen. Max Baucus'
re-election campaign.
   Packwood is being featured in Baucus commercials that defend his
voting record against allegations from GOP challenger Allen
Kolstad, the state's lieutenant governor.
   The ad is in response to one by Kolstad that alleged Baucus
voted for a $50 million tax break for Phillips Petroleum in 1986.
Packwood, former chairman of the Senate Taxation Committee, is
quoted as saying Kolstad is wrong and that Baucus wasn't
responsible for including the tax break in a bill.
   Elaine Franklin, Packwood's chief of staff, said she called
Baucus' campaign manager after seeing the ad Friday ``and said it
would be our preference that Sen. Packwood is not in this race.''
   Paul Risley, Baucus campaign spokesman, said the ad would
continue. And Kolstad spokesman Stuart Brown said Kolstad's
original ad also would continue.
   Franklin said she didn't know Packwood's letter about Kolstad's
allegations would be used in a TV commercial. However, she said
Packwood didn't hesitate to provide the statement.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate George

Cleveland for a decade.
   And Natalie Wymer, Celebrezze's deputy press secretary, called
the poll ``just not believable.''
   ``Our own internal polls for the same period of time show us
dead even,'' she said.
   The Ohio Poll is jointly sponsored by the Dayton Daily News, The

the university's Institute for Policy Research.
   Results showed Voinovich was supported by 52.3 percent of the

percent. Another 8.9 percent were undecided. The margin of error
was 3.5 percentage points.

<TEXT>
   Officials of the crumbling Warsaw Pact
agreed Saturday on a plan to divide up their tanks and other
conventional weapons, paving the way for an East-West accord
covering all of Europe.
   Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky called it the ``first
step toward a new system of security in Europe,'' replacing the
Cold War confrontation that plagued Europe for more than four
decades.
   The accord cleared what Western officials had said was the last
major hurdle to an agreement limiting the number of tanks, armored
vehicles, aircraft and artillery in Europe. It is to be signed in
Paris this month.
   The 34 nations of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe are set to sign a major East-West conventional arms
reduction agreement Nov. 19 in the French capital.
   ``It will be a new beginning to unite Europe,'' Foreign Minister
Krzysztof Skubiszewski of Poland said after the signing.
   The agreement came at a time when the future of the Soviet-led
bloc - which also includes Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria -
is in question as former loyal allies reorient themselves toward
the West. East Germany, a former pact member, was absorbed into a
united Germany.
   Hungary and Czechoslovakia want the alliance to end its military
role by the middle of next year, and to remain only as a loose
political grouping.
   ``As a military organization, I would not bet that it would last
as long as the end of next year,'' Jeszenszky told reporters.
   Later, in a news conference, he cited a ``growing general
agreement'' among members to end the Pact's military role.
   Skubiszewski told reporters, ``The Warsaw Pact will disappear
because it will no longer correspond to the need of that part of
Europe. It has lost its sense.''
   However, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Yuli Kvitsinsky said the
agreement signed Saturday had nothing to do with the Warsaw Pact's
future as a military alliance.
   ``The Warsaw Pact lives and fulfills a useful function,'' he
said.
   In June, leaders of the Warsaw Pact countries meeting in Moscow
decided to change it from a primarily military to political
organization, he said.
   Kvitsinsky substituted at the last minute for Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. He said Shevardnadze could not
come because of commitments in the Soviet Union.
   He denied that they were connected with ethnic violence in the
republic of Moldavia, which borders Romania.
   Warsaw Pact experts agreed in Prague, Czechoslovakia, last
weekend on how to divide among themselves the 20,000 tanks and
other conventional weapons they may keep within the agreement
between East and West.
   The Western NATO alliance will be allowed to keep similar levels
of weapons, but will have to destroy far fewer than members of the
Eastern alliance.
   Czechoslovak officials said after last week's meeting that the
Soviets will keep 13,150 of the 20,000 tanks, 150 fewer than they
had wanted.
   Most of the other Warsaw Pact countries will keep between 1,000
and 2,000 tanks. The levels must be reached in a period of 40
months after the agreement is signed in Paris.
   Hungarian officials aid one final issue to be settled dealt
with how many tanks the Soviet Union must place in storage. Both
East and West must store about 15 percent of their total number of
tanks. The Soviets wanted assurances they would not have to store
proportionally more than any other country.
   U.S. officials have said President Bush will attend the Paris
summit meeting. His presence was contingent on a conventional
weapons treaty being ready for signing.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will travel to Moscow this
week for talks with Shevardnadze and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev that will touch on some remaining issues to be worked out
in the conventional weapons agreements.
   Kvitsinsky said that various minor issues remain to be resolved,
but declined to specify them.
   The conventional forces treaty does not limit the number of
soldiers each side may have in Europe.
   The Budapest meeting was held on the date on which officials had
intended to hold a Warsaw Pact summit in the Hungarian capital.
   The summit was postponed at Soviet request.
   Kvitsinsky and Jeszenszky said the summit meeting would be held
after the Paris summit meeting of the Conference on Security and
Cooperation in Europe, but would not say exactly when.
   Hungary has already served notice it will leave the military
part of the Pact next year even if it is not dissolved by then.
   But Jeszenszky denied at the news conference that any such firm
timetable had been set.

   Shouts of ``one settler, one
bullet!'' rang out Saturday as about 3,000 blacks attended the
funeral of Zeph Mothopeng, leader of the militant Pan Africanist
Congress.
   The black opposition group follows a more radical philosophy
than the African National Congress and some other groups opposing
the white-led government. The phrase ``one settler, one bullet,''
refers to killing whites.
   Mothopeng, a popular anti-apartheid activist who was jailed
several times for his activities, died last month at age 77 after a
lengthy illness. He split from the ANC three decades ago to help
form and later lead the Pan Africanist Congress, which refuses to
recognize the white-led government and opposes sharing power.
   Joe Slovo, leader of the South African Communist Party, and
representatives of the Canadian, Swedish and British governments
attended Saturday's ceremony.
   Youths in congress T-shirts escorted the coffin into the stadium
as the crowd chanted. When Slovo, who is white, arrived, some in
the crowd shouted, ``One Slovo, one bullet!''
   At one point in the service, about 50 people began chasing a
black man accused of being a police agent and beat him until Pan
Africanist Congress officials intervened. The crowd blocked
journalists from getting near the scene and ordered photographers
not to take pictures.
   Speaking of Mothopeng, Bishop Stanley Mogoba, leader of South
Africa's Methodist Church said, ``Although he was sickly, he was
morally tough and had a clear vision on what was unfolding in the
political arena, still intending to contribute to the liberation
struggle.''
   In recent years, the Pan Africanist Congress' struggle has been
largely ineffective. It is overshadowed by the much larger and more
moderate ANC, which is involved in talks with the government aimed
at sharing power between blacks and whites. The Pan Africanist
Congress opposed the talks.
   Some 35 miles to the north, about 2,000 right-wing Conservative
Party supporters marched through Pretoria to demand that whites
vote on President F.W. de Klerk's efforts to end apartheid.
   Conservative leader Andries Treurnicht chided de Klerk for
talking to the ANC, saying he is ``the only Western leader
negotiating himself and his party from power.''
   The Conservative Party favors strict segregation and contends de
Klerk has acted without the support of a majority of whites.
   No violence was reported.
   Earlier Saturday, two bombs exploded near dawn in the Orange
Free State city of Bloemfontain, about 210 miles southwest of
Johannesburg.
   Police said the two blasts about an hour apart damaged rail
lines and halted commuter traffic, but caused no injuries. No group
or individuals claimed responsibility.
   The ANC said its regional conference began Saturday in
Bloemfontain, and a spokesman suggested that right-wing elements
may have set the bombs to try to disrupt it.
   A police spokeswoman said a train full of police had been
scheduled to travel on the damaged lines at about the time the
explosions occurred. She said the police trip had been canceled
previously.
   Extreme right-wing groups have been accused of other bombings of
ANC and government targets.

   A note written by a disturbed
passenger delayed a United Airlines flight for two hours while the
jet was evacuated so FBI agents and bomb-sniffing dogs could search
the plane, officials said.
   Thirty passengers were evacuated Friday from the Chicago-bound
plane after the note was mistakenly interpreted as a bomb threat.
   ``It wasn't a threat,'' said Art Kollias, airport operations
manager. ``If anything it was a misunderstanding.''
   Kollias said an elderly immigrant with a history of mental
illness wrote the note to express a concern for his personal safety
to the flight crew.
   The note was written in broken English and included the word
``sabotage,'' so the crew thought it was a threat, he said.
   Authorities did not identify the man or release the full
contents of the letter. The flight originated in Cedar Rapids.
   The other 28 passengers flew to Chicago after the plane was
checked and no bombs were found. The passenger and his companion
were questioned by the FBI and later released.

<HEAD>Former West German Chancellor to Meet Saddam Hussein, Hostages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN KUSMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENCASTLE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt said he will tell Saddam Hussein during their meeting this
week about how isolated the Iraqi leader has become in the world
community.
   Brandt also planned to meet with some of the 400 German hostages
held in Iraq and hoped to deliver messages to captive diplomatic
delegations from their governments.
   The former chancellor said he will travel to Iraq on Monday at
Hussein's invitation. He said he did not know exactly how long his
visit would last, but he planned to stay a few days.
   ``I have reason to believe he still is not a great deal informed
about the degree of his isolation,'' Brandt told reporters Friday,
when he concluded a one-week U.S. speaking tour before returning to
Germany.
   Brandt, who won the 1971 Nobel Peace Prize for helping improve
East-West relations, said he will travel to Baghdad as a private
citizen, not as a government representative.
   Brandt, who was chancellor from 1969 to 1974, remains prominent
in German politics and is a leading figure in that country's Social
Democratic Party. He heads Socialist International, a world
organization of Western socialists and social Democrats.
   He would not say what he hoped to accomplish during talks. The
volatile Gulf crisis began when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``He said that he would explain to me how he looks at the Gulf
situation and the Middle East as a whole,'' Brandt said.
   Brandt said that after the meeting he will report to the German
government, U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar ``and
anyone else who is interested in my trip.''
   He said he hoped to meet with some of the 400 Germans among
thousands of foreigners detained by Iraq since the U.S.-led
military buildup in the region. The hostages include a former
Brandt aide, Claus Sonksen, the ambassador to Kuwait and Bahrain.
   The governments of Norway and other countries have asked him to
meet with their captive diplomats as well.
   Brandt said he did not plan to deliver any messages from
Washington, but would not rule out meetings with U.S. diplomats
before departing for Baghdad.
   The former chancellor said he would not be accompanied by former
Italian Prime Minister Emilio Colombo or former Belgian Finance
Minister Willy de Clercq, as had been discussed earlier.

<TEXT>
   Disgruntled voters pick a new Congress and 36 governors Tuesday
in midterm elections shadowed by twin threats of recession at home
and war in the Middle East.
   But for all the combustible ingredients - and unexpectedly close
races involving Republican Sens. Jesse Helms, Mark Hatfield and
Rudy Boschwitz - few incumbents seem likely to lose in 34 Senate
races, 435 House contests and 36 statehouse races on the ballot.
   And only marginal changes seem likely in the size of Democratic
majorities in Congress and among the nation's governors.
   The California governor's race is the biggest prize of the
campaign season, pitting Republican Sen. Pete Wilson against former
San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein in a $35 million contest.
   The nation's most populous state is expected to gain as many as
seven House seats after the 1990 census, and the new governor will
share power with the Democratic-controlled legislature in deciding
the make-up of the new congressional districts.
   Other closely watched gubernatorial campaigns are in Texas,
where Republican Clayton Williams was in a close race with Democrat
Ann Richards, and Florida, where late polls had former Sen. Lawton
Chiles leading GOP Gov. Bob Martinez.
   Not on the ballot but scarcely ever on the sidelines this fall
has been President Bush.
   He campaigned for more than 80 GOP candidates but triggered a
period of Republican disillusionment when he flip-flopped on tax
increases during budget negotiations with Congress and abandoned
his 1988 pledge of no new taxes.
   There was no shortage of campaigning the final weekend before
Election Day.
   Bush stumped in California for Wilson, whom he praised as an
environmentalist and credited with a ``big part in our decision''
to impose a 10-year moratorium on off-shore oil drilling off the
California Coast. Feinstein campaigned by train through the San
Joaquin valley.
   In Oregon, Democrat Harry Lonsdale crashed Hatfield's news
conference and issued one more call for a debate. Hatfield made no
response, but later told reporters, ``I'm conducting a press
conference, not a circus.''
   Helms sought to strip his race to its essentials: ``The real
question is do you want liberal Harvey Gantt or conservative Jesse
Helms to cast your vote in the Senate and that's the question the
people of North Carolina have to ask,'' he said.
   Gantt, a black man trying to unhorse one of the Senate's
best-known conservatives, referred to the desegreation battles in
the 1960s as he appealed for votes. He said he sees a need to build
bridges of understanding because people are in danger of ``drifting
back to overt racism.''
   An estimated 19 House seats will migrate from states in the
industrial Northeast and Midwest to the Sun Belt before the 1992
elections, elevating interest in this year's legislative races and
raising the stakes in the gubernatorial battleground states.
   An estimated $1 million has been spent by two candidates for a
state legislative seat in Pennsylvania, where Democrats hope to
take control of the Senate and monopolize the state's
reapportionment process.
   More than 6,100 legislative seats are up for election around the
country. Voters in 43 states and the District of Columbia will
decide 236 ballot questions, including ``Big Green,'' an
environmentalist-backed measure in California.
   ``You could have the contradictory result of overwhelming public
anger toward the people in government and a very high re-election
percentage of incumbents,'' says Larry McCarthy, a GOP consultant
active in campaigns from Florida to California.
   McCarthy says polling indicates that upwards of two-thirds of
the voters believe the country is headed in the wrong direction,
and others say the level of antipathy toward incumbents is
extraordinarily high.
   Says Paul Tully, political director at the Democratic National
Committee: ``When we've seen voters get more nervous, more anxious,
they grab for stability'' and vote for the incumbent candidate.
   California aside, all eyes are on these races:
   -North Carolina's Senate seat, where Gantt is locked in a close
race with Helms. Helms is running a late-campaign commercial
showing a white worker with a job rejection letter, a reference to
the civil rights bill that Helms opposed and Bush vetoed with a
claim it would lead to hiring quotas.
   -The Texas governor's race, a $33 million battle between wealthy
oilman Williams and Richards that's close in the pre-election
polls. Williams disclosed Friday he had paid no income taxes for
1986 ``when our whole economy collapsed.''
   -Minnesota's tumultuous gubernatorial campaign, where Republican
Jon Grunseth dropped out of the race in late October over
allegations that he had once gone swimming nude with teen-age
girls, and had an affair during both of his marriages. After days
of bickering, a state party dominated by conservatives turned to
moderate Arne Carlson. The GOP still has realistic hopes of ousting
unpopular Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich.

   In the House, Democrats hope to pick up as many as 10 or 12
seats and pad their 259-176 majority. But with the exception of
incumbents tinged by the savings and loan crisis, such as
Republican Alfred McCandless in California, or personal scandal,
such as Arlan Stangeland in Minnesota, relatively few incumbents
seem to be in serious difficulty.
   The most competitive races are for the 18 Republican and 11
Democratic seats without incumbents.
   A small group of potential 1992 Democratic presidential
candidates is on the ballot. Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and Sens.
Sam Nunn of Georgia, Al Gore of Tennessee and Bill Bradley of New
Jersey are all favored to run up landslide re-election victories.
   As always, the two sides harbor hopes of late-blooming upsets:
Democrats claimed a surge in Kentucky, where Harvey Sloane is
running against GOP Sen. Mitch McConnell. Republicans hoped to
surprise Democratic Sen. John Kerry in Massachusetts.
   But after months of campaigning, hundreds of millions of dollars
in expenditures and seemingly endless negative campaign
commercials, there seems little likelihood of anti-incumbency fever
sweeping the nation.
   Democrats quickly portrayed themselves as the party of ``tax
fairness'' and Republicans as protectors of the rich during the
October budget debate, and the party benefited in pre-election
polling.
   But lately, Bush has helped shift the campaign focus away from
the budget and softening economy and toward the Persian Gulf, where
he has deployed more than 200,000 American troops as a bulwark
against Iraq's Saddam Hussein. The result has been an apparent
shift back to some GOP candidates.
   Abortion is playing a role at the end of a tight Florida
gubernatorial race. Chiles stayed away from the issue until a
debate last Monday night in which he said he would ``trust the
women of Florida'' to make their own choice. Martinez is a foe of
abortion.
   Polls in two states favor independent candidates over major
party rivals for governor. Former GOP Sen. Lowell Weicker is
seeking a political comeback in Connecticut and former GOP Gov.
Wally Hickel in Alaska.
   Illinois, Ohio and Massachusetts are among 13 states where no
incumbent is on the ballot.
   One incumbent whose defeat seems certain is Rhode Island
Republican Gov. Edward DiPrete, lagging far behind in the polls in
a third-time rematch with Democrat Bruce Sundlun.
   The fallout from the Minnesota governor's race has settled on
veteran GOP Sen. Boschwitz, locked in a tight race with liberal
Democrat Paul Wellstone.
   The other endangered Republican is Hatfield of Oregon, a veteran
of 40 years of politics. Democrat Harry Lonsdale has depicted him
as a Washington elitist out of touch with his state. Hatfield
fought back with advertisements recalling Lonsdale's supportive
comments in the mid-1980s of an Indian guru whose top aide was
convicted of arson and poisoning.
   The lone Democratic incumbent in difficulty appears to be Sen.
Daniel Akaka in Hawaii, appointed after the death of Spark
Matsunaga earlier this year. Republicans hope Rep. Patricia Saiki
can win the seat and offset any losses elsewhere. The Democrats
hold a 55-45 edge in the Senate.
   GOP candidates are favored to retain all three open Senate seats
on the ballot: Reps. Hank Brown in Colorado, Larry Craig in Idaho
and Bob Smith in New Hampshire.
   GOP veteran Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who will be 88
when his new term starts, has no major party opposition. Democrat
J. Bennett Johnston won election earlier this fall in Louisiana's
unique open primary system.
   Democratic freshman Sen. Paul Simon is favored to win
re-election in Illinois and Sen. Tom Harkin is favored less
securely in Iowa.
   In House races of interest, three blacks are running competitive
races as Republicans: Gary Franks in Connecticut, former Cincinnati
Mayor Kenneth Blackwell in Ohio and Al Brown in Kentucky.

   The ``Lady of the Lake'' mystery appears
to be solved with the identification of skeletal remains inside a
Ford sedan hauled from the bottom of Lake Lanier, officials said
Saturday.
   Fulton County Medical Examiner Gerald Gowitt examined the
remains and said the bones and a skull apparently belonged to Susie
Roberts, who drove off in a car with a friend in 1958 and never
returned.
   Gowitt declared that the bones were those of Mrs. Roberts using
her approximate weight and height. A more positive identification
was unlikely, he said.
   ``With the evidence we have, we're as certain as we can be,'' he
said.
   The rusted car was found Thursday in the northeast Georgia lake
by workers building a bridge. The light blue car was mangled by
construction equipment that dug it up, but its tires were still
inflated, authorities said.
   Workers washed mud out of the car when they came across the
remains, said Hall County Sheriff Dick Mecum.
   The car had a 1958 license plate, corresponding with the woman's
disappearance, Mecum said.
   A car carrying two women ran off the road into the lake in 1958.
The body of a woman believed to have been one of the occupants was
found about a year later, but the car and the other woman weren't
recovered, Mecum said.
   ``We were pretty sure it was her,'' Hugh Roberts, 49, said
Saturday. ``It's sad, but it's a relief to know.''
   Roberts, one of Mrs. Roberts' sons, and his brother, James
Roberts, 51, both of Gainesville, were teen-agers when their mother
disappeared. She was 38.
   The car's license plate was registered to Mrs. Roberts, her
older son said. His sister found evidence Friday in county archives
that matched the license plate, he said.
   Investigators found a watch stopped at 11:30 - about the time
the two women are believed to have been driving home from a dance
in nearby Dawsonville.
   ``We believed she was in the lake, but then we heard she might
be in Chicago, then in Florida,'' the younger Roberts said. ``We
wondered if she survived but had amnesia and never knew where to
go.''
   Authorities now believe a woman's body found near the bridge
about a year after the accident is that of Delia Mae Parker Young,
Mrs. Roberts' companion in the car. The decomposed body was buried
unidentified in the 1970s, said John Ward, whose family mortuary
kept the remains about 20 years in the hope someone would identify
her.
   Hugh Roberts said the family will hold a memorial service for
his mother, but he said details had not been finalized.

<HEAD>Differing Reports Say Rwandan Rebel Leader Injured or Dead</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rwanda's army commander was quoted by
Ugandan newspapers Saturday as saying the leader of an
anti-government insurgency has been wounded, but rebel officials
said he had been killed.
   A statement from the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front said leader
Fred Rwigyema died after stepping on a mine Oct. 2, the second day
of the invasion.
   Rwanda on Thursday claimed to have defeated the rebels in heavy
fighting in the nation's northeast. The Rwandan government said it
had pushed the insurgents back into Uganda.
   However, Henry Rwigyemera, a local official near Uganda's
southern border with Rwanda, said in an interview that no rebels
had returned to Uganda since Rwanda claimed victory. He described
such claims as lies and propaganda.
   Rebel representatives in Brussels said on condition of anonymity
that the news of Rwigyema's death was kept secret for fear of
lowering the morale of the guerrillas.
   But Ugandan newspapers reported Saturday that Rwigyema was
seriously wounded during a helicopter attack on rebel forces and
was taken to the United States.
   The newspapers, quoting Rwandan army commander Lt. Col.
Deogratius Ndabimana, did not describe Rwigyema's injuries or say
when or where he was injured. The reports in the Star and Munno
newspapers also did not say who evacuated Rwigyema, a former
Ugandan deputy army commander, or where he was taken in the United
States.
   Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kampala, Uganda, could not be
reached for comment.
   In Washington, U.S. officials said they could not confirm
whether Rwigyema was dead or alive. They also denied, on condition
of anonymity, that Rwigyema had been brought to the United States
for treatment.
   The insurgents said Rwigyema was killed in the northeastern
region around Kagitumba near the Ugandan border. The rebels have a
base camp in the area.
   The front also announced two other rebel leaders were killed by
a land mine on Oct. 23. The statement did not say who was currently
leading the insurgents.
   The rebels said they still controlled the Kagera National Park
in the north, which makes up about 15 percent of Rwanda's
territory, despite the government claims it has driven the
insurgents out.
   The front said it was ready to talk with the government about
the future of Rwanda, a former Belgian protectorate. But the rebels
said they could still launch attacks.
   Last week, the Belgian government said it had negotiated a
cease-fire between the government troops and the rebels, but the
truce has yet to become effective.
   Belgium and France sent paratroopers to Rwanda to protect their
nationals after the insurgency began. Belgium's last paratroopers
returned Saturday.
   Rwigyema, who was 34, was a major general in Uganda's army
before leading the invasion of Rwanda by several thousand refugees,
mainly of Rwanda's minority Tutsi tribe.
   The rebels accused Rwanda's government of corruption. They said
they wanted to replace it with a democracy in which all ethnic
parties could participate.
   They sprang from the hundreds of thousands of Tutsis, including
Rwigyema, who fled Rwanda in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In
those years, the majority Hutu gained control in a power struggle
that left more than 10,000 Tutsi dead.
   An estimated 250,000 Rwandan refugees live in Uganda.

<HEAD>President Signs Head Start Expansion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Saturday signed
bills to expand the Head Start pre-school program and provide funds
for childhood immunization.
   The Head Start legislation authorizes $20 billion over the next
four years for Head Start - enough to serve all eligible poor
children for the first time in the program's history. At current
funding levels, the program serves only 20 percent of the eligible
children.
   Head Start, widely acclaimed by educators and a focal point of
Bush's campaign promise of a ``kinder, gentler'' nation, prepares
disadvantaged 3-and 4-year-olds for elementary school.
   As a presidential candidate, Bush promised to fully fund the
program for all eligible children. His administration, however,
proposed lower spending levels than the bill that Congress passed
and sent to him.
   The bill Bush signed Saturday authorizes $2.4 billion for Head
Start in 1991, rising to $7.7 billion in 1994. That compares with
an appropriation of $1.39 billion in 1990.
   The measure will also allow 30 percent of the 5-year-olds who
are not in public kindergartens to attend Head Start programs. It
further calls for $20 million for 1991 for a follow-through program
to help elementary school children build on their Head Start
experiences.
   In addition, the bill authorizes grants to states to help
low-income families pay fuel bills. Total grants would be limited
to $2.15 billion in 1991, $2.2 billion in 1992, and sums as
necessary in 1993 and 1994.
   Bush also signed legislation authorizing $205 million in 1991
and sums as necessary in 1992-95 to help states purchase vaccines
and run immunization programs for children.
   The government estimates that about half the nation's children
receive immunizations through the grants. In addition, the bill
authorizes $34 million in 1991 for federal vaccine research,
development, testing and distribution.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein presided
over a meeting of senior officials Saturday to discuss military

   It gave no indication of what was discussed, reporting only that
``President Saddam Hussein today presided over a meeting to discuss
part of our troops' theatre of operations in the south of Iraq,''
which includes Kuwait.
   Last week, Saddam told his military commanders at another
meeting to be prepared for war at any time.
   A multinational force, composed largely of U.S. troops,
assembled in Saudi Arabia after Baghdad's Aug. 2 invasion of
Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   China's top leaders have ordered an all-out
public relations drive to improve the country's tarnished image
abroad, official reports said Saturday.
   ``They discussed how to better present China to the rest of the
world under the present situation,'' the official Xinhua News
Agency said.
   It apparently was referring to lingering criticism of the
Chinese army attack in June 1989 on student-led demonstrators for
democratic reform. Although the industrialized democracies have
begun softening sanctions against China, foreign tourism and
investment remains down.
   Five of the six members of the Communist Party's powerful
Standing Committee took up the image-building issue at a
closed-door meeting at the Great Hall of the People with delegates
from around the country.
   Party Secretary Jiang Zemin, Premier Li Peng and committee
member Li Ruihuan made important speeches during the meeting,
Xinhua said. The report did not provide details of their speeches.
   Xinhua said Standing Committee members Song Ping and Qiao Shi
also met with delegates at the five-day meeting on overseas
publicity. The report did not mention Yao Yilin, the other member
of the party's top decision-making committee.
   ``The delegates agreed that, in view of the situation, more
efforts should be made to better present China to the rest of the
world in order to acquaint people more with the country and thereby
increase their understanding,'' Xinhua said.
   ``They all agreed that foreigners and overseas Chinese are very
different from people in China in lifestyle, way of thinking and
expression, as they live in different societies. ... Therefore,
they agreed, these characteristics need serious studies and should
be dealt with differently. Domestic methods should not be simply
copied.''
   The delegates said Chinese from all walks of life must help
project a favorable image to the rest of the world.
   ``The work of overseas publicity should be done not only by the
press people, but also by those engaged in economics, foreign
trade, science and technology, culture, education and tourism,''
Xinhua quoted the delegates as saying. ``In addition, leaders at
all levels and in all departments concerned should attach great
importance to this work and place it on their daily agenda.''
   In a separate development, a Taiwan magazine reported that
senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping extended a hand to Taiwan
earlier this year by meeting with a member of the country's
Nationalist Party.
   It would be the first time that a Chinese leader was reported to
meet a member of the party since the Chinese Communist revolution
in 1949.
   The monthly news magazine, Journalist, said Deng met in May with
Teng Wen-yi, a former aide to Taiwan's Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek and a former classmate of Deng. Chiang was defeated by the
Communists, and he fled with Nationalist forces to Taiwan.
   The respected magazine ran a photograph of the two men shaking
hands.
   It quoted Teng as saying that Deng told him in the meeting at
Beijing's Great Hall of the People that he hoped China could
reunify with Taiwan within three years.

<TEXT>
   It was beginning to look a lot like winter in the central United
States, but summer-like weather prevailed east of the Mississippi
on Saturday.
   Heavy snow fell in parts of Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas and South
Dakota Friday and Saturday in the first wintery blast of the
season.
   Southwestern Colorado got up to 15 inches of snow in some spots
and at least five inches blanketed the Denver area.
   Numerous traffic accidents were reported, some causing minor
injuries, officials said.
   ``We've had everything from accidents to accidents with injuries
to cars in a ditch to jackknifed semis,'' said Barb Onken of the
State Patrol in Marshal, Minn.
   Snowfalls in western Nebraska included about eight inches in
Keith and Chase counties.
   At least six inches of snow fell in some parts of South Dakota
and Kansas. Snow also fell in southwest Minnesota and northwest
Iowa.
   Rainshowers extended from Wisconsin to the southern high plains.
Thunderstorms over eastern New Mexico produced dime-size hail.
   Another cold front scattered rainshowers into the Pacific
Northwest. Dry conditions prevailed across the rest of the nation,
with sunshine from California to Montana.
   Heavier precipitation amounts for the six-hour period ending at
noon EST included eight-tenths of an inch at Quillayute, Wash.
Two-thirds of an inch fell in Concordia, Kan., and more than half
an inch at Salina, Kan., and Gage, Okla.
   Temperatures were in the 70s as far north as Michigan and New
England and were as high as 80 degrees in the middle Mississippi
Valley. Temperatures were in the 70s and lower 80s in the
Southeast.
   Record high temperatures Saturday included 79 degrees in Newark,
N.J.; 78 in New York City; 77 in Philadelphia, Pa., Concord, N.H.,
and Providence, R.I.; 75 in Boston and Williamsport, Pa.; and 72 in
Portland, Maine.
   Temperatures from the Rockies to the Pacific Coast were in the
30s and 40s at midday. Temperatures in the California valleys and
the southwestern deserts were in the 60s and 70s.
   Lows dipped below freezing in other parts of the West and from
the Plains to Minnesota. Lows in the teens were reported in the
Great Basin, the northern Rockies, North Dakota, Montana and
Wyoming.
   The nation's morning low was 4 degrees below zero at Yellowstone
Park, Mont.

   Darwin and Phyllis Michael thought they
were safe when 10 inches of rain fell in the mountains near their
home five years ago. Their house was 27 feet above and 600 feet
away from the South Branch River.
   But their home was demolished when the South Branch and several
other rivers in eastern West Virginia overflowed their banks on
Nov. 4, 1985. The record-breaking floods killed 47 people and
caused $570 million in damage.
   The Michaels knew they were in trouble when the water began
gushing into the second-floor bedroom of their home in Petersburg,
60 miles east of Parsons. They wound up riding their attic like a
raft and spent the night clinging to the limbs of a walnut tree.
   At dawn the next day, they found themselves 200 yards from what
used to be their home. There was nothing left. The bricks were
gone. The cinderblock foundation was gone. The concrete slab the
house sat on was gone.
   ``It even pulled the footers out of the ground,'' Darwin Michael
said, still amazed at the force of the water.
   Five years haven't erased the memory of the flood for area
residents.
   ``The flood is still very much on their minds. It's still a
topic of discussion every day,'' said Ron Castle, a Parsons
businessman whose television and appliance store was gutted.
   The flood came after nightfall with little warning.
   The water poured down the narrow valleys with brutal force,
twisting railroad tracks into corkscrews and scouring farmland.
   Trees, automobiles, buildings and bridges were washed away. The
debris battered homes and businesses to pieces.
   More than 3,500 homes and 180 businesses were destroyed and
hundreds of thousands of farm animals were killed. Forty-three
bridges were destroyed and 80 more were damaged.
   The area's economy is still hurting from the flood. Most
business owners had no flood insurance and were forced to take out
federal Small Business Administration disaster relief loans.
   Jane Barb, 57, owns a drug store and four rental properties in
Parsons and estimates her debt at more than $200,000.
   ``The SBA owns me lock, stock and barrel,'' Barb said. ``I will
never live to get out of debt. Everything I have is mortgaged to
the hilt.''
   She's among the success stories.
   Marywin McClain Smith, editor of the weekly newspaper The
Parsons Advocate, says just 13 of 96 businesses in the Parsons area
escaped damage in the flood.
   Since then, 18 businesses in town either failed to reopen after
the flood or opened only to close again. Among the casualties were
the only two downtown department stores.
   Her husband, George Smith, said at least two other businesses
are in trouble because of the flood and disaster relief loans
``made more with the heart than with the head.''
   The Michaels used their life savings and some volunteer help to
build a replica of their house.
   But this time they built on a hill 700 feet above the river and
a mile and a half away from it.
   The Michaels are still working on their house.
   ``People will be working for 10 years,'' said Tucker County
Clerk Nina Buchanan. Buchanan said she was still working on her own
home in Parsons.
   Work also continues on public buildings and other structures
damaged by the flooding.
   Steve Simpson, state public assistance officer for the Office of
Emergency Services, says the Federal Emergency Management Agency
has provided $62 million to rebuild roads, bridges, water plants
and sewer systems. About $16 million in work remains undone.
   While the rebuilding continues, many flood survivors also must
cope with the fear that floods will come again.
   Many report being drawn to the riverside during heavy rains, as
if standing there will hold the water in its banks.
   ``I do it myself,'' said Frank Brown, director of the Potomac
Highlands Guild mental health center in Petersburg. ``I don't mind
a hard rain. But by the second day, I start looking. People are
very touchy about it.''

   Black nationalist Nelson Mandela
said Saturday that his visit to Japan represented a possible
setback in an otherwise successful international tour to seek
support for his movement.
   He also blamed white security forces for murders during black
factional violence in South Africa, and he said his African
National Congress might consider taking up arms again if the
bloodshed continues.
   On his international trips, Mandela has asked foreign countries
to help support the ANC, which he helps lead as deputy president.
The ANC is the most powerful South African group opposing that
country's white-led government.
   During his stop in Japan, however, government officials told him
they would not give grants to political parties.
   Mandela made his comments during a press conference in Kuala
Lumpur.
   He said he was happy with his visit to Malaysia. On Friday, he
met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and asked for financial
support.'
   Mahathir said he could not make an immediate pledge because the
matter would have to be discussed with the Treasury and other
government agencies.
   However, Malaysian officials did offer expertise in housing as
well as technical and training facilities.
   Referring to black factional violence in South Africa, Mandela
said the murders were orchestrated by the white security forces to
undermine the power of the ANC.
   About 760 people had been killed in fighting between two black
movements since September.
   Mandela said certain sections of the security forces did not
wish to see the ANC gain strength and succeed in negotiating a
peaceful settlement. The ANC and other groups are negotiating with
the South African government to give majority blacks a say in their
country's political system.
   The black leader did not elaborate on his statement about the
possibility of taking up arms again. He only said the situation
would be watched closely.
   Mandela, who arrived in Malaysia on Thursday, leaves Sunday for
Brunei on the last stop of this six-nation tour.

   President Bush declared at a campaign
rally Saturday that the United States will stand firm against Iraq
until every hostage is returned home.
   ``The United States is united and we will prevail,'' he said.
``If the United States can't do it nobody can.''
   Shouting at times to be heard over a group of about 20 anti-war
protestors, the president referred to his plans to visit the Middle
East over the Thanksgiving holidays.
   ``Barbara and I have a lot to be thankful for,'' he said, ``and
we will be with those troops on Thanksgiving Day and I will give
them the thanks of everybody here and all the American people.''
   Bush's brief appearance in a chilly airport hanger in
Albuquerque was on behalf of gubernatorial candidate Frank Bond and
other New Mexico GOP candidates.
   His pre-election campaign day had started earlier in California
where he pledged to sign a landmark bill that would usher in ``a
new era for clean air.''
   At the same time, Bush voiced opposition to a sweeping
environmental measure, known as ``Big Green,'' on the California
ballot that would curb use of pesticides and chemicals.
   ``When it comes to the environment ... in order to keep our
environment green, we don't have to be Big Green,'' Bush said,
noting that GOP Sen. Pete Wilson, in a tight race for governor of
California, also opposes the measure.
   The controversial ballot proposition, supported widely by
environmental organizations, would phase out cancer-causing
pesticides, ban ozone-depleting chemicals and reduce gaseous
emissions that contribute to global warming, among other
provisions.
   The measure is opposed by water, timber, agricultural and
manufacturing industries.
   Bush's Environmental Protection Agency chief, William Reilly,
later said he did not have a public position on Big Green. He told
reporters it has some laudable provisions, but he also cited its
costs and said ``It is not sound scientifically.''
   ``Obviously, its goals ... are laudable. It reflects a very high
degree of concern ... a sense of urgency that people feel'' about
the environment, Reilly said.
   ``If Big Green does pass, we will work with it to try to ensure
that it is integrated with our national laws as effectively as
possible,'' Reilly added.
   The president was flying on to Houston later Saturday night and
was to spend Sunday and Monday and part of Tuesday, Election Day,
in his adoptive home state of Texas before flying back to
Washington.
   In remarks at a rally for Wilson on the California Lutheran
University campus, Bush also said he was looking forward to
visiting the troops in the Persian Gulf when he travels there over
Thanksgiving.
   He used a tree-planting ceremony at the university to highlight
the historic Clean Air Act of 1990, which he promised to sign.
   ``We are on the verge of a major domestic achievement for all
Americans. And I can now say to Californians is that I will sign
this landmark clean air legislation as soon as it gets to my desk
within the next few days,'' Bush said.
   Bush called the legislation, which would stem acid rain, urban
smog and toxic industrial pollution, ``the most significant air
pollution legislation in the history of this country.''
   ``We are on the verge of a new era for clean air,'' he said.
   Referring to the bill's requirement for a phase-in of vehicles
that run on alternative fuels, Bush said ``In a short time since we
issued the clean air challenge, we've seen a revolution in thinking
about alternative fuels. The time is right, the people are ready,
and industry is responding.''
   The Clean Air Act represents the product of a year's worth of
technical negotiations by administration and congressional
representatives.
   It marks the first passage of major anti-pollution regulations
in 13 years.
   Environmental groups have lauded the bill, despite the fact that
the final version discarded tougher provisions, particularly in the
area of auto emissions, that they had pushed.
   They expressed satisfaction with the bill overall after accusing
the Bush administration of blocking some of the tougher provisions
that had won strong support in the Senate.
   Wilson has developed a strong enough environmental record to win
the endorsement of some environmental groups in his race against
Democrat Dianne Feinstein. He has been a strong advocate of coastal
protection, bucking both the Reagan and Bush administrations and
also has backed protection of scenic rivers. Wilson opposes Big
Green.
   Feinstein, who supports the initiative, had less of a clear
record on the environment as a mayor of San Francisco.

   Conservative Sen. Jesse Helms on Saturday
cast his fight against Democrat Harvey Gantt as a classic battle of
right vs. left, while Gantt, who is black, harkened back to past
civil rights victories as he appealed for votes.
   Helms, who has been running a little behind Gantt in the polls,
told supporters in Asheville: ``The real question is do you want
liberal Harvey Gantt or conservative Jesse Helms to cast your vote
in the Senate and that's the question the people of North Carolina
have to ask.''
   He was joined by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who
told Helms' supporters, ``I am here today because I hate to see
someone crucified by the liberal eastern media and the liberal
North Carolina media.''
   Gantt, bidding to become the nation's first black Democratic
senator, told voters in Charlotte he wants to keep people from
``drifting back to overt racism.''
   Gantt, who was the first black student at Clemson, said he
learned early on ``we could change the face of the South.'' He
recalled the desegregation battles of the 1960s, and said they
presented a chance ``to bring about real positive change by
standing together.''
   He said Helms wants ``to scare people to death, to be divisive,
to say things he knows are not true.''
   ``I pledged that I would not insult your intelligence, but that
I would appeal to your higher instincts,'' Gantt said. ``... All we
can do is trust the people of this state ... and hope the state's
insulted by this kind of campaign. It's in your hands.''
   Helms, meanwhile, renewed his charges that Gantt has lied about
the senator's record.
   ``Harvey Gantt won't tell the truth. The liberal press won't
tell the truth, so what's a person like me to do? All I can do is
count on you,'' he told his supporters.
   ``If he (Gantt) has told the truth one time in this campaign, I
don't know it,'' Helms said. ``... He is so unfamiliar with the
truth I wouldn't trust him with anything, certainly not a Senate
seat.''
   A poll released Friday showed Gantt favored by 47 percent of
those surveyed and Helms supported by 41 percent. The survey had a
3.7 percentage point margin of error.

   Moldavia on Saturday rejected new
Soviet help to battle a wave of ethnic unrest in this southern
republic that left at least three separatists dead. It issued its
own demand that the militants disband.
   In Moscow, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Moldavian republic
and separatist representatives agreed to urge a ``moratorium on all
earlier decisions'' that led to the conflict, the official news
agency Tass said.
   It was not immediately clear if that would include the
republic's June declaration of autonomy from Moscow.
   In an internal challenge to the republic's leaders, Russian and
Ukrainian separatists were seen on television blocking roads
Saturday night around Dubossary, Bendery, and Grigoropol in the
eastern area along the Dniester River. Busloads of people sat idle,
their path blocked by barricades made of tractors and construction
equipment.
   A state of emergency was declared there Friday.
   Moldavian police and Interior Ministry forces set up
checkpoints, apparently to control activists' movements, officials
in Kishinev, about 700 miles southwest of Moscow, said Saturday.
   At least three separatists were killed Friday in the region
where roughly 200,000 ethnic Russian and Ukrainians began
blockading roads and demanding autonomy Friday. Another report put
the death toll at six. Reports conflicted on how they were killed.
   Parliament created a commission Saturday to investigate the
shootings in the area, which separatists declared the ``Dniester
republic'' on Sept. 2.
   No reports of further violence emerged Saturday.
   Gorbachev, trying to carry out political and economic reforms,
is beset by restive republics demanding greater autonomy or even
independence. All but one of the 15 republics have declared some
form of autonomy.
   More than 1,000 students marched Saturday in the Moldavian
capital of Kishinev in support of the government and pledged to
fight the Dniester activists and other Gagauz separatists in
southern Moldavia.
   The Gagauz, a Turkish Christian minority numbering about
150,000, declared autonomy Aug. 18 and announced elections last
week for their own government.
   Two-thirds of Moldavia's 4.3 million residents are ethnic
Moldavians and share a language and culture with neighboring
Romania. The others are mainly Russians, Ukrainians and
Byelorussians.
   Both the Gagauz and Dniester separatists complain of
discrimination by Moldavians. The republic voted this year to make
Romanian its official language, an act the internal separatists
cite as evidence of discrimination.
   In Kishinev on Saturday, Parliament passed a resolution asking
all volunteer forces throughout the republic to disperse and return
home. The lawmakers set up committees to verify compliance with the
order.
   Volunteer brigades of Gagauz, Moldavians, and Russians and
Ukrainians reportedly were armed with knives, sticks, metal rods
and firebombs.
   The Moldavian parliament Saturday asked the Kremlin not to send
any Interior Ministry troops to the Dniester region. Moldavian
Prime Minister Mirca Druk earlier declined an Interior Ministry
offer to dispatch troops to the eastern region, legislators said
Saturday.
   Between 500 and 800 Soviet Interior Ministry troops are deployed
in the Gagauz area, but none in the Dniester region.
   In Moscow, Gorbachev and other Kremlin leaders, including Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and legislature speaker Anatoly Lukyanov,
met with Moldavian President Mirchu Snegur and representatives of
the Gagauz and Dniester areas, Tass said.
   ``The participants ... agreed on the necessity to take immediate
measures for restoration of law and order,'' it reported.
   They agreed to form a conciliation commission to try to resolve
the Gagauz and Dniester conflicts
   ``Resolution of the conflict would consist of establishing a
moratorium on all earlier decisions taken by the sides that led to
the conflict, and immediately declaring the volunteer forces
illegal,'' Tass said.
   It was unclear what decisions would be covered by any such
moratorium.
   Ryzhkov later said in a television interview the Kremlin will
follow developments in Moldavia closely and take more resolute
steps if decisions taken there prove ineffective, Tass reported.
   Moldavia's interior minister, Gen. Ion Kostash, told parliament
Saturday three people were killed and nine wounded, all Russians or
Ukrainians, on Friday in Dubossary. Tass, quoting Soviet Interior
Ministry officials in the Gagauz city of Komrat, said six people
were killed and 30 injured.
   Kostash said he earlier had sent about 250 troops to Dubossary
under orders from Druk after between 100 to 200 Russian and
Ukrainian separatists seized three government buildings and
barricaded the city's only bridge across the river.
   He said his troops fired tear gas and warning shots, then
charged the crowd to disperse it. But nobody was killed on the
bridge, Kostash said.
   Tass quoted Vyacheslav Sipchenko, a member of the Dubossary City
Council, as saying Moldavian troops clubbed residents, and many of
the victims suffered gunshot wounds.
   Kostash said the Russians and Ukrainians may have been shot
while trying to seize weapons from a Soviet army depot in
Dubossary.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate
Clayton Williams on Saturday defended his admission that he paid no
income taxes for 1986 while his Democratic opponent continued to
call upon him to release his tax records.
   Williams described 1986 as a lean year for many Texans, yet one
in which his Democratic rival, state Treasurer Ann Richards, drew
``a fat government paycheck.''
   Meanwhile, a poll published in Sunday's editions of the Houston
Chronicle showed Richards gaining ground on Williams as the
campaign nears its end.
   The poll showed Williams was favored by 44 percent of those
surveyed, while 39 percent backed Richards. Thirteen percent were
undecided and 3 percent backed other candidates.
   The Oct. 28-30 poll by the University of Houston's Center for
Public Policy, surveyed 767 of 1,042 likely voters who had been
interviewed for a Chronicle poll in September.
   The earlier poll showed Williams favored by 48 percent and
Richards by 33 percent. Both surveys had a 4 percentage point
margin of error.
   Richards, campaigning in Brownsville, said she could not predict
who would win the election, but said her continued gains in the
polls was an encouraging sign.
   ``I can't call this election, and I think it's going to be real,
real close, but I think he's got real serious problems,'' Richards
said.
   Williams, campaigning in Harlingon on Saturday, said Richards
didn't understand the hard times many Texans suffered during 1986.
   ``I'm just bothered that somebody who was drawing a fat
government paycheck, sitting in Austin in 1986, was hiding under
that rock,'' he said.
   Williams, a millionaire whose business interests include oil and
ranching, on Friday disclosed that he paid no taxes in 1986 ``when
our whole economy collapsed.''
   ``I didn't get a paycheck in 1986 because I was trying to keep
my business afloat, trying to pay interest on bank loans and trying
to survive,'' he said.
   Richards then renewed her call for Williams to release his
income tax returns, and said, ``I paid my income tax in 1986. How
about you?''
   Her press secretary, Bill Cryer, said: ``In 1986, I can
understand he was going through some hard times. But everybody in
Texas was. And we all paid our taxes then.''
   Reggie Bashur, a Williams spokesman, said Williams had complied
with tax laws and ``I don't think the people of the state of Texas
care'' to see his tax returns.
   Williams and Republican Sen. Phil Gramm criticized Richards for
making an issue of Williams' tax returns.
   ``Ann Richards has discovered miraculously that 1986 was a bad
year, that Clayton Williams and the oil business lost money in
1986,'' Gramm said. ``What rock has she been hiding under?''
   Williams also reiterated his call for a constitutional amendment
that would ban a state income tax unless voters supported the tax
in a referendum. He said he would veto a state income tax, and
criticized Richards for refusing to say whether she also would veto
one.

<HEAD>Royal Shakespeare Company Calls It Curtains for Now</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Royal Shakespeare Company, which had two smash
hits with ``Les Miserables'' and ``Nicholas Nickleby,'' called its
curtains in London on Saturday in a cost-cutting move highlighting
tough times for the British arts.
   Following its sellout evening performance of the play
``Singer,'' the company closed its two London theaters at the
Barbican Center until March 1991. It will continue its season in
two theaters at Stratford-upon-Avon, Shakespeare's birthplace.
   ``With your help and God willing, we'll be back,'' the company's
artistic director, Terry Hands, told the Barbican audience.
   It was the first time the state-subsidized company has taken
such a step. The event was greeted with a mixture of sadness as
well as applause for the company's determination.
   ``Let's lift a glass to, if you like, the future and our
return,'' Hands told the audience before they went out to the lobby
to join cast members for one last drink in London this year.
   The move is expected to save $2.53 million for the company, now
$5.85 million in debt.
   The company is the largest of many theater organizations around
Britain to be fighting for survival in today's cost-cutting,
recessionary climate.
   On Monday, Vanessa Redgrave, Glenda Jackson and Dame Peggy
Ashcroft were among the British stars to launch a nationwide
campaign at London's Albery Theatre to spotlight the financial woes
of the theater industry nationwide.
   The Shakespeare company receives annual subsidies of $11.8
million. It says it needs $19.3 million to be in the black.
   Hands consistently argued that the company's grant has kept pace
neither with inflation, running at 10.9 percent, nor with the
specific recommendations of an independent report saying the
company was underfunded.
   Annual worldwide revenue from the musical ``Les Miserables,''
which opened at the Barbican in October 1984, brings the company
nearly $2 million a year, but Hands points out that the show won't
run forever.
   Amid widespread sadness at the company's closure in London -
depriving the city of up to six plays - is some speculation that
the company has, in part, been its own worst enemy.
   Its case ``is not helped by espousing the palpably second
rate,'' David Lister wrote in The Independent of ``Moscow Gold,''
the company's new play about Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Howard Brenton and Tariq Ali's play, a satire with a cast of 33,
opened Sept. 26 to bad reviews and has performed poorly at the box
offices.
   ``Moscow Gold'' was one of three new company plays to receive
blistering reviews in London this year. Only Peter Flannery's
``Singer,'' starring Antony Sher as a concentration camp survivor
turned London slumlord, won acclaim from critics and audiences,
playing to 99 percent capacity in the 1,162-seat main auditorium.
   ``The company needs to look hard at its new play policy,''
Benedict Nightingale wrote in The Times of London. He said
defiantly uncommercial plays are not necessarily worthwhile, and
urged the company to take time for ``unromantic self-examination.''
   In 1988, Hands' staging of the musical ``Carrie'' was derisively
received during its company tryout in Stratford-upon-Avon.
   It subsequently closed on Broadway afterfive performances, even
though the company made $420,000 in a pre-arranged deal with
producer Friedrich Kurz.
   Last year, critic John Peter in London's Sunday Times coined the
name ``The Really Frightful Company,'' referring to the declining
quality of Shakespearean verse-speaking.
   But when the company is on target, its productions equal the
best to be found in the English-speaking theater.
   Last season was highlighted by major revivals of Shakespeare's
``Othello,'' directed by Trevor Nunn, and Henrik Ibsen's ``The
Master Builder,'' starring John Wood.

   Several thousand leftist radicals marched through
Berlin on Saturday, and police said they briefly detained 85 people
after minor clashes with some of the demonstrators.
   Members of Berlin's large anarchist scene marched through the
downtown section of what used to be East Berlin and rallied at the
central square, Alexanderplatz.
   About 5,000 people took part in the march. It was held to
protest what demonstrators said is rising racism and nationalism in
the united Germany.
   There were minor scuffles with police and rock-throwing
incidents during the rally.
   Police said they briefly held about 85 people. There were no
reports of serious injuries.
   The radicals say they are committed to an anarchist state in
Germany.

<HEAD>Medicare Chief Orders Probe of Florida HMOs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The overseer of the nation's
Medicare program ordered an investigation of Florida health
maintenance organizations with federal contracts to scrutinize
marketing and patient practices.
   Richard Kusserow, inspector general for the Health and Human
Services Department, will conduct the investigation, which was
prompted by media reports of abuses and inquiries from two Florida
congressman.
   Much of the attention will focus on Humana Gold Plus, by far the
state's largest HMO for Medicare beneficiaries.
   The Gold Plus plan, which has about 200,000 clients, has been
the subject of 5,440 complaints since June 1987, ranging from
improper enrollments to failure to provide service.
   The Gold Plus plan was cited twice last year by the Health Care
Financing Administration, Medicare's parent agency, for violating
medicare regulations, including improperly denying claims,
enrollment problems and excessive payment delays.
   Gail R. Wilensky, chief of the Health Care Financing
Administration, said Friday she picked Kusserow to investigate.
Medicare placed a moratorium on Humana's plans to expand into other
parts of Florida pending the outcome of the investigation.
   Other complaints against Gold Plus involved bills the plan did
not pay or decisions that left patients harassed by bill
collectors.
   The government pays Humana a fixed fee monthly for each
enrollee. Patients are to receive complete health care services and
prescription drugs at little or no cost and aren't supposed to have
to fill out insurance forms.
   Wilensky said she decided to launch the investigation after she
was contacted by Florida Congressman E. Clay Shaw Jr. and Larry
Smith and learning of media reports about patients complaints about
Gold Plus.
   Shaw and Smith wanted to ensure HMOs were following federal
regulations, she said.
   Humana spokesman Tom Noland dismissed the investigation as
politically motivated. He said he couldn't respond to Medicare's
concerns because the organization has not received anything in
writing.
   ``If they ask us to do something, how can we do it if we don't
know what it is?'' he said.
   The HMOs could lose their federal contracts to provide for
Medicare patients if the investigation uncovers wrongdoing. Other
punitive action could be brought by Congress.

   President Bush's approval rating plunged 24
percentage points since August to 52 percent, a poll released
Saturday showed.
   Fifty-nine percent of those surveyed approved of Bush's handling
of the Persian Gulf crisis, down significantly from 75 percent who
approved in August, just after Iraq invaded Kuwait and troops began
to roll into the region.
   The New York Times-CBS poll showed the president's overall
approval rating at 52 percent, down from 60 percent during the
second week of October and 76 percent in August.
   Only 41 percent said the United States should take stronger
military action against Iraq, with 50 percent opposed to stronger
military action.
   The popularity of Congress also declined. Only 23 percent of
those polled approved of the way the lawmakers are handling their
jobs, compared with 27 percent in October and 42 percent in
January.
   The poll included a random sample of 1,445 adults interviewed by
telephone Oct. 28-31. It has a margin of error of 3 percentage
points.

   Four freed American hostages, three French
soldiers and three Irishmen flew to freedom Saturday after Iraqi
authorities released them from captivity.
   One of the freed Americans - among thousands of Westerners still
trapped in Iraq and occupied Kuwait - had been held as a ``human
shield'' at an Iraqi installation. The four did not speak to
reporters, except to say they were tired.
   In Baghdad, the four were identified as: Dr. Abdul Kangi, 50,
from Glencoe, Ill.; Raymond Gales, from the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait,
whose hometown was not immediately available; and Michael Barner,
49, of Woodsworth, La.; and Randall Trinh, 49 of Hacienda Heights,
Calif.
   Trinh had been held at an undisclosed strategic site in Iraq.
The Baghdad government has held some Americans and other Westerners
at such sites to deter any air attack by foreign forces.
   The commercial Iraqi Airways flight from Baghdad carried 77
other evacuees, mostly Arabs.
   U.S. Embassy officials who met the flight in Amman said the
Americans would return home Sunday.
   Arrangements were made for the French soldiers to leave for
Paris on a scheduled Air France flight late Saturday.
   Airport sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Americans would fly to New York via Cyprus and London.
   The French soldiers, who were turned over to the French Embassy
in Baghdad after Iraqi troops captured them Monday, walked into the
arrival lounge followed by the four Americans.
   French diplomats hustled the three soldiers to a VIP lounge,
while U.S. Embassy officials rushed the freed Americans into a
glassed-in arrival lounge. The embassy said they were receiving
counseling.
   A French Embassy spokeswoman expressed appreciation for Iraq's
``good gesture'' in freeing the three soldiers, but added that they
were allowed to depart freely because all French citizens are now
able ``to leave Baghdad at any time.''
   More than 250 French citizens were released by the Iraqis last
week, but thousands of other foreigners are still prevented from
leaving.
   Three men who identified themselves as Irish joined the French
soldiers in the transit lounge. They refused to disclose their
names, but one, carrying an Irish passport in his hand, confirmed,
``Yes, we were hostages.''
   Irish Embassy officials were not available for a comment.
   A U.S. Embassy official said the four Americans were released
``for humanitarian reasons.''
   Iraq said Thursday they were being freed because they were
``sick and elderly,'' although three were listed as being 50 or
under.
   U.S. Embassy sources in Baghdad said Trinh suffered an acute
stomach ulcer. They said Barner suffered from a neurological
disorder. If the other two were ill, their ailments were not
disclosed.
   In Glencoe, Kangi's wife, Fatima, said she and her husband were
Tanzanian-born Moslems who became American citizens about eight
years ago. She said they went to Iraq with their two sons on a
religious pilgrimage on July 30. She and the children were allowed
to leave Iraq on Sept. 5, but her husband, director of radiation
therapy at Chicago's Mercy Hospital, had to stay behind, she said.
   The four returning American men were accompanied by two members
of an American group called the Fellowship for Reconciliation, who
had been in Baghdad for more than two weeks seeking the release of
Americans.
   They are Tarek Mohammed Al-Heneidy, a businessmann from
Rockport, Mass., and a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Michael
Kenny of Juneau, Alaska.
   Heneidy told reporters that Iraq's release of the hostages was a
``clear sign that a peaceful solution was very possible if world
governments pushed for peace.''
   Pat Humphries, Barner's sister, said she didn't know why her
brother had been released.
   She said her mother had talked to him by telephone at least once
a week during his captivity.
   ``Every time he called, he was treated very well. One day he
called and he'd just got through eating roast and mashed potatoes
and gravy. The food situation in Baghdad must not (have been) as
bad in Baghdad as it was in Kuwait,'' she said in the interview in
Alexandria, La.
   Prospects for freedom improved for some of the other captive
foreigners on Saturday. Iraq's National Assembly voted 225-25 to
allow the 700 Bulgarians remaining in Iraq and Kuwait to leave.
   Toose who voted against the request said that Bulgaria was not
neutral but was allied with the multinational efforts to dislodge
Iraq from Kuwait.
   The assembly earlier approved a similar request by President
Saddam Hussein to allow French citizens to go home. More than 250
French nationals left on Monday.
   Iraq's National Council speaker, Sadi Mehdi Saleh, told Irish
and Italian parliamentarians that Baghdad would soon announce an
offer to free all the captive foreigners in exchange for a
guarantee that Iraq would not be attacked.
   Baghdad had made similar offers in the past.
   About 1 million foreigners fled Kuwait and Iraq after the
invasion, but an estimated 2 million others remain in the two
countries. They include about 1,000 Americans.
   At least two former leaders were launching efforts to win the
release of their countries' citizens.
   Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt was going to Iraq on
Monday at the invitation of Saddam. Brandt won the 1971 Nobel Peace
Prize for helping to improve East-West ties.
   Japan's former prime minister, Yasuhiro Nakasone, arrived in
Baghdad Saturday. Although his trip is private, it has the support
of his government.

<HEAD>Lee Harvey Oswald's Escort Gets Second Look at Murder Weapon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man who was Lee Harvey Oswald's police escort
the day he was gunned down got a second look at the murder weapon
27 years later, this time in a courtroom.
   ``Looks a little diffeent when it's not pointed at you,'' said
Jim Leavelle, 70.
   Leavelle is the man in the light suit and hat whose image was
captured by cameras when Oswald was killed by Jack Ruby on Nov. 24,
1963.
   Friday, Leavelle was an interested observer who showed up for a
probate trial to determine ownership of the .38-caliber Colt Cobra.
   Leavelle was a 43-year-old detective when he was assigned to
provide an escort through the basement of the Dallas police station
for Oswald, who days earlier was arrested for the assassination of
President Kennedy.
   ``I saw (Ruby) when he came out of the crowd,'' Leavelle said.
He said he was holding Oswald by the belt and tried to jerk him out
of the line of fire as Ruby emerged from a crowd of reporters.
   But Ruby ``took two quick steps, and pow,'' Leavelle said.
   Ruby's brother, Earl Ruby, and Ruby's former attorney, Jules
Mayer, are battling for control of the gun in court. The trial
began last week.
   Ruby bought the Colt Cobra for $62.50 in a Dallas gun shop.
Mayer said it is now worth more than $100,000.
   Ruby was convicted of murder in 1964 and sentenced to die in the
electric chair, but the conviction was overturned two years later.
Ruby died at age 55 before a new trial could be held.

<TEXT>
   The national parliament has approved a
new constitution that ends 15 years of one-party rule, eliminates
the death penalty and changes the country's name, Mozambique's news
agency reported Saturday.
   The constitution takes effect at month's end. It meets key
demands of the rebel Mozambique National Resistance, which has been
fighting the government for 13 years.
   But the rebels released a statement Saturday rejecting the
document, saying it reflects the ideology of the ruling FRELIMO
party, rather than the Mozambique people, and leaves too much power
with the president.
   The rebels proposed discussing revisions at peace talks expected
to resume soon in Rome. Their war with the government has killed
600,000 people and left about half the country's 15 million people
in need of donated food.
   In its report, the national news agency AIM said all 181
People's Assembly deputies present voted for the new constitution
Friday, ending debate that began Oct. 5.
   The document changes the country's name to ``Republic of
Mozambique,'' dropping the word ``People's.'' In addition, the
parliament's name changes to ``Assembly of the Republic.''
   FRELIMO's policy-making Central Committee had previously
recommended the changes. Approval by the FRELIMO-dominated
parliament had been expected.
   FRELIMO has been the sole legal political party in the southeast
African nation since Mozambique gained independence from Portugal
in 1975. The FRELIMO party was Marxist, but it has undergone
reforms in recent years and officially dropped its Marxist label
last year.
   The new constitution removes all references to FRELIMO's
``leading role'' in the country.
   After the vote, President Joachim Chissano led the assembly in
singing songs from FRELIMO's guerrilla war against Portuguese
colonial rule, AIM reported.
   The new constitution permits formation of multiple political
parties and calls for secret balloting in national elections, which
would be on a majority vote system rather than a proportional
representation system.
   A majority vote system means the top vote-getter wins, while a
proportional system allocates parliamentary seats on the basis of
the percentage of votes a party receives. In presidential
elections, a candidate would have to gain at least half the votes
to win. A runoff would be held if no candidate received 50 percent.
   The new constitution also prohibits political parties based on
regional or ethnic ties, and requires all parties to re`ect
violence.
   It guarantees press freedom, including the right to set up
newspapers; workers' right to strike; an independent judiciary; and
the ``right to life,'' which abolishes the death penalty.
   Chissano said July 31 he wanted a multiple party system in place
for parliamentary and presidential elections scheduled for next
year. He previously had opposed a multiparty system, saying it
would encourage tribalism and waste the country's scarce resources.

<HEAD>Bulgarian Opposition Demands that Former Communists Quit Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VESELIN TOSHKOV</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The major opposition alliance in
economically devastated Bulgaria pledged at a mass rally Saturday
that it will wrest power from the former Communist Party and form a
government.
   ``We want the posts of premier and ministers in key
ministries,'' said Petar Beron, leader of the 16-party Union of
Democratic Forces.
   Tens of thousands of supporters cheered Beron and other speakers
at the rally in front of the downtown Alexander Nevski Cathedral.
   The crowd yelled, ``Down with the BSP!'' - the initials of the
Bulgarian Socialist Party, the renamed Communist Party.
   Bulgaria is undergoing its worst economic crisis. Staple foods
and other basic commodities are rationed or unavailable. Inflation
is rising, and a large segment of the population is living beneath
subsistence level.
   ``We will not concede that those who have exploited us to this
day can continue to do so,'' said Konstantin Trenchev, leader of
the opposition trade union Podkrepa.
   Contrary to developments elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the former
Communists won a majority of 211 of 400 parliamentary seats in
Bulgaria's first free multiparty elections in June. The Union of
Democratic Forces won 144.
   Saturday's rally was held to mark the anniversary of the first
major demonstration against the hard-line Communist regime of
longtime dictator Todor Zhivkov. A week later, Zhivkov was toppled.
   Beron described the November 1989 leadership changes as an
``attempt by a more far-sighted group in the Communist Party to
avoid the fate of other Communist parties in Eastern Europe.''
   Opposition lawmakers suggested on Saturday that the governing
Socialist Party's majority in parliament could be ended with the
help of Socialist advocates of political and economic reforms.
   Beron said the opposition now holds the presidency and has as
its members the mayors of Sofia, Plovdiv and Varna - the three
largest cities in this former Soviet satellite nation of about 9
million people. ``What remains now is the government,'' he
declared.
   In parliamentary debates on Socialist Premier Andrei Lukanov's
government program this week, the opposition refused backing sought
by the Socialists.
   ``The government belongs to the political force that enjoys the
support of society,'' Beron told Parliament on Thursday.
   He referred to recent opinion polls which estimated the
Socialists had 40 percent support, compared to 52.75 percent in the
June elections.
   At the rally, speaker after speaker demanded punishment of ``the
guilty ones for the national catastrophe.''
   Stoyan Ganev, parliamentary floor leader of the Union of
Democratic Forces, declared: ``We want to take over the country's
government as soon as possible. The BSP's program is economically
deficient, legally and politically unsubstantiated. It is cruel in
the social sphere, and that's why we have no right to say `Yes.'''

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patrick Allan Lilley, known as Butch Patrick when
he played Eddie in the 1960s television series ``The Munsters,''
was arrested on a charge of stealing $130 from a limousine driver,
police said.
   Lilley, 37, of Austin, Texas, was arrested Friday, police said.
   Police provided few details but said Lilley was a passenger with
another man in the limousine and no weapons were involved.
   ``Lilley contends that the driver was less than cordial and he
kept getting them lost,'' said Nicholas Kerkeles, who defended
Lilley at his arraignment. ``A fight began and Munster, er, Mr.
Lilley, apparently took the wallet, claiming that the driver
shouldn't have been paid in the first place.''
   The actor, who played the werewolf-like son of Herman and Lily
Munster on the show, and John Patrick Sullivan, 33, of Chicago were
charged with robbery of the driver at a gasoline station in
suburban Glen Ellyn.
   Lilley was released on $1,000 bail. He told DuPage County Judge
Bonnie Wheaton he makes a living attending conventions and making
personal appearances as his former television character.
   Now rerun in syndication, ``The Munsters'' ran from 1964 to
1966.
   Lilley's telephone number was not listed with directory
assistance in Austin.

<TEXT>
   The West's liveliest election scene is in California, where a
high-stakes governor's race shares the ballot with propositions for
sweeping environmental reforms.
   But contests elsewhere are anything but dull. California is just
one of five Western states where the incumbent governor is stepping
down to leave a wide-open race, and ballot initiatives in several
states address abortion, nuclear energy, gambling and legalized
marijuana-smoking.
   In California, the contest to succeed retiring Gov. George
Deukmejian is a neck-and-neck race between Republican Pete Wilson,
a two-term U.S. senator, and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the former
San Francisco mayor.
   Wilson and Feinstein have raised a total of more than $38
million in the costliest governor's race in state history. Battling
in TV and radio spots to reach the 13 million voters of the
nation's most populous state, Wilson bills himself as a
``compassionate conservative'' while Feinstein calls herself ``the
candidate of change.''
   California's other big election issue is a proposition called
``Big Green,'' a far-ranging package of environmental reforms. It
would ban offshore oil-drilling and cancer-causing pesticides,
reduce air pollution, and create an elected post of state
environmental czar. Another measure would restrict timber
clear-cutting and purchase $742 million worth of old redwood
forests.
   ``It will make California a far better, a far safer place,''
said Albert Meyerhoff, an environmentalist who helped write ``Big
Green.''
   The timber, agricultural and chemical industriesdisagree.
Saying the measures would cripple the economy, they have countered
with less drastic propositions of their own.
   Californians also will consider two propositions to limit the
number of terms its state legislators can serve.
   Colorado, too, will vote on term limitations; that proposal
would not only limit state legislators, the governor and other
state officeholders to eight years in office, but also would impose
a constitutionally questionable cap of 12 years for U.S. House and
Senate members.
   In Oregon, an initially sleepy contest to replace retiring
Democratic Gov. Neil Goldschmidt has perked up. Recent polls showed
late-starting Barbara Roberts, the state's Democratic secretary of
state, gaining on Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer, a Republican.
   In Alaska, Democratic Gov. Steve Cowper is stepping down,
leaving a competitive race between former Anchorage Mayor Tony
Knowles, GOP state Sen. Arliss Sturgulewski and former Gov. Walter
Hickel, who is running as an independent candidate.
   Arizona's Democratic Gov. Rose Mofford also is retiring. Polls
give former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard a lead over GOP real estate
developer Fife Symington.
   In New Mexico, GOP Gov. Garrey Carruthers, prohibited by law
from serving a second consecutive term, has opened up a race
between former Democratic Gov. Bruce King and former state Rep.
Frank Bond.
   Five Western governors are seeking re-election. All are
Democrats, and all are expected to win. They are Govs. Roy Romer of
Colorado, John Waihee of Hawaii, Cecil Andrus of Idaho, Mike
Sullivan of Wyoming, and acting Nevada Gov. Bob Miller.
   U.S. senators expected to win re-election bids include Ted
Stevens, R-Alaska; Pete Domenici, R-N.M.; Alan Simpson, R-Wyoming;
and Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont.
   Other Senate races:
   -Polls show Sen. Daniel Akaka, D-Hawaii, in a dead heat with GOP
challenger Rep. Pat Saiki.
   -Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., is neck-and-neck with Democrat
Harry Lonsdale, a relatively unknown businessman who erased
Hatfield's early lead with an aggressive campaign funded mostly by
his own money.
   -In Idaho, Republican Sen. James McClure is retiring, and
conservative GOP Rep. Larry Craig is favored over former Democratic
state Sen. Ron Twilegar.
   -In Colorado, GOP Rep. Hank Brown is favored over Democrat Josie
Heath, a Boulder County commissioner, to succeed retiring
Republican Sen. Bill Armstrong.
   Two House races merit special notice.
   In Oregon, GOP Rep. Denny Smith is faltering in a rematch with
Democrat Mike Kopetski, who lost by just 707 votes two years ago. A
recent poll put Kopetski ahead by 10 points.
   In Washington, first-term Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, a Democrat, is
fending off Republican challenger Bob Williams. He accused the
usually liberal Unsoeld of selling out to the conservative gun
lobby by sponsoring a bill to legalize American-made assault
weapons.
   Some Western ballot measures:
   -A Colorado initiative would allow small-stakes gambling in
three towns: Cripple Creek, Central City and Black Hawk.
   -A Nevada proposition would leave questions of abortion to
voters, not the Legislature, by requiring that changes to a current
law protecting abortion rights be made only by a statewide vote.
   -Alaska's anti-drug activists are sponsoring an initiative to
criminalize marijuana-smoking. If approved, it will likely be
challenged. The Alaska Supreme Court has ruled that the state
constitution's privacy clause protects Alaskans' right to smoke
small amounts of pot at home.
   -Educators nationwide are watching Oregon's school-choice
proposal, which would allow parents $2,500 in tax credits for
teaching children at home or sending them to private rr parochial
schools. Also on the Oregon ballot: two anti-abortion measures, a
strict recycling measure, and a proposed shutdown of Oregon's only
nuclear plant.

<HEAD>Humorist Minnie Pearl Honored For 50 Years On Grand Ole Opry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Humorist Minnie Pearl celebrated her
50th anniversary Saturday night on the Grand Ole Opry, receiving a
congratulatory telegram from the White House.
   The message from President Bush and first lady Barbara was read
during a special 60-minute segment of the Opry. Some of country
music's top stars gathered on stage for the tribute.
   ``We are pleased to join your many friends in honoring you,''
the Bushes told Miss Pearl, 78, in the note.
   ``God bless you. I love every one of you,'' Miss Pearl said.
   Wearing her trademark gingham dress and straw hat with its $1.98
price tag dangling, Pearl greeted the Opry crowd and the live cable
television audience with her standard salutation, ``How-deee! I'm
just so glad to be here!''
   One of several taped tributes aired on the show came from
entertainer Dolly Parton, who said ``I love you. I miss you.''
   To which Pearl responded, ``I wear a hat so folks can tell us
apart.''
   Country stars Roy Acuff, Chet Atkins, Hank Snow and Grandpa
Jones gathered on stage. The show was taped by cable television's
The Nashville Network.
   Edward Gaylord, chairman of Opryland Inc., presented Miss Pearl
with a statuette shaped like a microphone with her trademark hat
perched on the side.
   ``Minnie Pearl is the reason we bought Opryland,'' Gaylord said,
explaining that her spirit influenced his purchase of the
entertainment park in 1983.
   Acuff, 87, who has performed with Pearl throughout her career,
sang his famous song ``Wabash Cannonball'' at her request.
   ``This is a special night for all of us,'' Acuff said.

   A man was charged Saturday in the fatal
beating of a teen-ager after an egg hit his car Halloween night.
   Dennis Moriconi Jr. faces a manslaughter charge in the slaying
of Timothy Doucette, police said.
   Doucette, 18, a landscaper from Somerville, died Thursday, 24
hours after he was beaten while trying to protect a friend, police
said.
   Doucette was with several other youths who threw eggs at each
other and at passing cars Wednesday night. A driver jumped out of
his Cadillac and chased the teen-agers when an egg hit the car.
   According to a witness, the driver said: ``Who threw that at my
car? You punks think you're funny.''
   The man grabbed one of the youths when Doucette intervened.
   ``Then this guy turned his anger on him (Doucette), punched him
a number of times, pushed him into a metal pole,'' police Lt. Ken
Coye said.
   The driver drove away after the beating.
   Moriconi, 19, of Medford was scheduled to be arraigned Monday.

   Gen. Nabil Abada, security chief in Assiut, a stronghold of

   The third time was the charm for John F. Kennedy
Jr., who passed the New York state bar exam after two
highly-publicized failures, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   ``The Hunk Finally Does It!'' trumpeted the New York Post's
front page. If Kennedy had taken strike three on this try, he would
have been out as a prosecutor in the office of Manhattan District
Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
   Morgenthau allows his assistants three shots at the test.
Official word about the test will come from the state next week,
the Post said. The newspaper quoted informed sources it did not
identify.
   The son of slain President Kennedy also took the Connecticut bar
exam and learned Friday he had passed it, but passing that test
would not have allowed Kennedy to practice law in New York and save
his job.
   Kennedy, 29, graduated from New York University Law School in
1989. He earns $30,000 a year as a prosecutor.
   Kennedy could not be reached for comment at the Manhattan
district attorney's office. A spokeswoman at the office said the
district attorney does not allow his assistants to speak to the
press.

   A woman was locked in jail because she says
the Bible forbids her to pay her lawyer.
   Jackie Gordon got 30 days in jail and a $500 fine Tuesday after
a judge found her in contempt of court.
   The Isabella, Mo., woman refused to pay a $4,692 judgment
awarded June 1 to the lawyer who helped her win custody of her
granddaughter.
   Ms. Gordon filed an appeal of the contempt citation Thursday
with the Oklahoma Supreme Court.
   Lawyer Dana Lyons helped Ms. Gordon win custody of her
2{-year-old granddaughter. Ms. Gordon says a New Testament passage
prevents her from employing an attorney.
   ``Luke 11:45 lays out exactly what Jesus thought of lawyers,''
she said, referring to a biblical narrative that says: ``And He
said, `Woe to you also, lawyers! For you load men with burdens hard
to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of
your fingers.' ''
   Tony Jack Lyons, the lawyer representing Ms. Lyons, quotes
scripture, too.
   ``In Romans 13 there are several verses which say that God wants
you to submit to civil authority,'' he said.
   Records show the attorney's fee is based on 37 hours of service
at a rate of $125 an hour.

<TEXT>
   Grand jury testimony against Charles Keating
Jr. brims with stories of pressure to sell junk bonds at Lincoln
Savings branches, bank examiners bamboozled and elderly people left
broke.
   Keating headed the Phoenix-based development company American
Continental Corp., which owned Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association. He is accused in civil suits of looting the thrift.
   A grand jury indicted him on criminal fraud charges involving
the sale of American Continental junk bonds to Lincoln depositors.
Prosecutors say more than 17,000 investors lost $250 million on the
bonds. The case focuses on 20 who lost $1.1 million.
   Echoing earlier congressional testimony, an Office of Thrift
Supervision examiner said Keating continued to have uninsured bonds
sold at Lincoln branches even though he knew the magnitude of
Lincoln's problems.
   ``If this institution is taken over, you guys will be faced with
a $2 billion loss,'' the regulator, Alex Barabolak, quoted Keating
as telling him in October 1988.
   Lincoln was seized six months later, a day after American
Continental sought bankruptcy protection, rendering the junk bonds
worthless.
   Douglas J. Lagerstrom, a bond salesman for American Continental,
was one of many employees who described how pressure to sell junk
bonds began at the top. He said the bond representatives were
entertained by Keating and his wife at the developer's sumptuous
resort.
   Lagerstrom said someone asked Keating if he could imagine any
way to make the place more beautiful.
   ``I can put a bond office in front of it and sell bonds,''
Lagerstrom quoted Keating as saying.
   The hefty grand jury transcript unsealed Friday totals 4,600
pages, weighs 45 pounds and stands 2{ feet high. It includes
testimony taken from 89 witnesses between April and September.
   Prosecutors got a 42-count indictment against Keating, American
Continental President Judy J. Wischer, Lincoln chief executive
Robin S. Symes and Lincoln President Ray C. Fidel.
   Keating, 66, and the others pleaded innocent. They remain free
on bail.
   Fidel's former secretary, Kathi Richardson, testified that while
federal bank examiners checked company records in an 11th-floor
office at Lincoln's Irvine, Calif., headquarters in 1986,
executives worked one floor below manufacturing documents to make
Lincoln look healthy.
   ``I was told to keep the examiners as much as I could up on the
11th floor so they wouldn't notice the activity going on on the
10th floor,'' she told the grand jury.
   Richardson said she helped Wischer ``clean out'' documents from
bond files to be examined by regulators in early 1986. The files
lacked required underwriting summaries and when they arrived from
Phoenix, secretaries typed underwriting papers for Wischer to
insert, she testified.
   Richardson said the office joke was that no one could even move
furniture without Keating's OK. She described Fidel and Keating as
wary of leaving a paper trail.
   ``Mr. Keating doesn't like files,'' Richardson said she was
told.
   Much of the testimony came from elderly investors who switched
money from insured certificates of deposit at Lincoln to the
uninsured, unsecured American Continental bonds.
   Their plight more than anything has caused Keating to become the
central figure in the nation's thrift debacle and what one of his
lawyers called ``the most vilified man since Richard Nixon.''
   ``We trusted Lincoln,'' said 66-year-old John Brunner, who lost
$76,000. ``It was like going into your doctor's office. We trusted
them.''

<TEXT>
   Big-league baseball owners agreed to pay players
$280 million in compensation for conspiring not to hire free agents
after the 1985, 1986 and 1987 seasons, a leading agent said
Saturday.
   The head of management's Player Relations Committee and a union
lawyer denied that a settlement had been reached.
   Richard Moss, former general counsel for the player's union who
represents several dozen players, said the 26 clubs agreed to pay
$280 million to settle three collusion cases covering the three
offseasons.
   Moss said 16 players, including Jack Clark of the San Diego
Padres, Jack Morris of the Detroit Tigers and Gary Gaetti of the
Minnesota Twins, would be be granted new-look free agency as part
of a settlement.
   New-look free agency means a player has the option of keeping
his current contract or leaving his team.
   Chuck O'Connor, head of the Player Relations Committee, said
discussions had intensified but a deal had not been reached.
   ``Until everything is agreed to, nothing is agreed to,''
O'Connor said.
   Union lawyer Stephen Fehr said ``it appears now that there is
the possibility of a settlement'' but said ``it will probably be at
least a month'' until it could be finalized.
   A $280 million payment would amount to $10,769,230 for each of
the clubs, by far the largest payment ever made by teams to players
in the history of sports.
   After six seasons in the majors, a player can become a free
agent, entertain offers from other clubs and sign with the team of
his choice.
   Two arbitrators have ruled that owners suppressed salaries by
boycotting free agents after the 1985, 1986 and 1987 seasons. They
have awarded preliminary damages of $113 million but have not yet
ruled on a variety of damage claims.
   Teams once again started signing free agents after the 1988
season, but the players' union claims salaries are lower than they
would have been without the boycott.

   NASA tried to determine
Saturday who is responsible for a small bag of cocaine discovered
in a hangar where space shuttlesare readied for launch, a space
agency spokeswoman said.
   ``This is the first time cocaine has been found in a Kennedy
Space Center facility and it is considered an isolated incident,''
said NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone.
   She said the cocaine was found Friday under a desk in one of the
maintenance areas in the Orbiter Processing Facility, where shuttle
repairs are performed.
   ``It was a very small amount,'' Ms. Malone said.
   Officials had not determined who the cocaine belonged to and no
arrests had been made, she said.
   The investigation is led by a team of security officers from
NASA, Lockheed Space Operations Co. and EG&amp;G Florida Inc.

<HEAD>Greenpeace Charges DOE With Wrongful Action At Savannah River Site</HEAD>

   Greenpeace accused the Department of Energy
of bypassing environmental review requirements on a South Carolina
plutonium processing plant.
   Greenpeace officials said the Energy Department failed to
complete an environmental impact statement on the plant at the
Savannah River site, where idled government nuclear operations are
located.
   The environmental group said it believed the government wanted
the new plant to replace the safety-troubled Rocky Flats plant in
Colorado.
   ``Without any public discussion, without an analysis of the
environmental impact, DOE is taking the first step toward moving
Rocky Flats to Savannah River,'' said Stephen Schwartz, legislative
coordinator for the Greenpeace Nuclear Free Future Campaign.
   The plant will undergo environmental reviews, but they will be
done later than usual, said DOE spokesman Rick Ford said. Such
reviews, required by law, typically are done before construction is
begun.
   ``The thinking at the time was that this was an addition to an
existing facility, so the full environmental impact statement
process was not needed,'' Ford said.
   Officials had not decided whether a full environmental report is
needed, Ford said. If a full report is not done, the plant could
begin operation in June 1991, he said.
   The Savannah River site, near the Georgia border, produced
tritium gas for nuclear weapons before its reactors were idled in
1988 for DOE-ordered safety upgrades.
   The new plant had been under construction for seven years.
Plutonium scrap would be dissolved into weapons-grade plutonium and
the purified scrap made into metal buttons to store for future use.
   ``This gives us the capability to handle scrap that has
accumulated over the years that we haven't previously been able to
handle,'' Ford said.
   TheEnergy Department has acknowledged it is considering closing
Rocky Flats and transfering some of its operations to Savannah
River. But the new plant couldn't replace Rocky Flats because it
couldn't handle the same volume.

   President Bush will be sharing
Thanksgiving with troops he has sent to the Persian Gulf and
meeting with his chief allies in the region.
   The White House announced the visit on Friday as Bush continued
a cross-country campaign trip in which he has blended Persian Gulf
rhetoric with partisan politics.
   He arrived in Southern California early today and planned to
address GOP rallies here and in New Mexico before flying to Houston
later tonight. He was to spend the final three days before
Tuesday's elections in Texas.
   Bush will visit Egypt and Saudi Arabia following a trip to Paris
for the Nov. 19-21 conference to sign a 34-nation treaty on
reducing troops and tanks in Europe, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
announced on Friday.

   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) - Republican Craig James eked out a
congressional victory two years ago by taking advantage of a
defense procurement scandal that engulfed his opponent, 10-term
incumbent Bill Chappell.
   Now James is in trouble, faced with a strong challenge from
Democrat Reid Hughes in one of Florida's nastiest congressional
campaigns.
   One of Hughes' campaign themes: James' acceptance of money from
political action committees, the same issue that James used against
Chappell in 1988.
   ``He's (James) being financed by PAC money which he campaigned
against two years ago as unethical,'' Hughes charged.

   KISHINEV, U.S.S.R. (AP) - Mikhail Gorbachev is urging restraint
after Moldavian troops shot Russians and Ukrainians in ethnic
strife that could jeopardize the Soviet president's efforts to hold
the nation together.
   Officials said at least three people were killed and nine
wounded in a clash Friday east of Kishinev, the capital of
Moldavia. States of emergency were declared in at least three
cities in the southwestern Soviet republic bordering Romania.
   The violence came after Russian and Ukrainian separatists seized
a government building in Dubossary, set up roadblocks and announced
elections for an independent parliament, according to legislators
in Kishinev.
   The parliament in Moldavia, a republic of 4.3 million people,
announced formation of a new national guard to try to re-establish
order in the area east of the Dniester River, where the separatists
already had declared their own republic.

   PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) - Only 10 months after the Velvet
Revolution ousted the Communists and swept Civic Forum to power,
the movement founded by President Vaclav Havel is in crisis over
the speed of reform.
   Cracks began to appear in the broad political movement earlier
this month when Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus, a radical
free-market reformer, was elected Civic Forum chairman over Martin
Palous.
   Palous was backed by the organization's Prague leadership and by
Havel, who favors slower, gentler reform that will be less of a
shock to the population.
   Klaus' victory Oct. 13 was seen as a dramatic shift to the right
and it triggered an identity crisis in Civic Forum, founded on a
civic rights platform and popularly associated with Havel's
liberal, humanistic philosophy.

   CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) - Inside the Interior Department, they refer
to it as ``the cow pie case.'' And frankly, they think it stinks.
   But if the agency loses a case that a federal judge has ordered
to trial, it soon may have to determine whether flatulent sheep,
cattle and buffalo are contributing to global warming.
   The Washington-based Foundation on Economic Trends filed a
lawsuit last year accusing the federal Agriculture, Interior and
Energy departments of failing to measure how much flatulent
livestock are contributing to global warming by pumping methane gas
into the atmosphere.
   ``It is basically known as the cow pie case,'' said the Interior
Department's top lawyer, Tom Sansonetti.
