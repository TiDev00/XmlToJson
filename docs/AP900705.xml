   Thousands of workers on Thursday
joined a 4-day-old strike organized by pro-Sandinista labor unions,
disrupting banking, postal and telephone services nationwide.
   Police made no effort to dislodge strikers from government
buildings, and there was no indication that negotiations between
the government and strikers would take place.
   The U.S.-backed government of President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro has declared the strikes illegal, saying they are
politically motivated. The government accuses the Sandinistas of
fomenting the labor unrest to undermine Mrs. Chamorro's economic
recovery program.
   On Wednesday night, seven pro-Sandinista strike leaders were
detained for two hours, including Lucio Jimenez, the
secretary-general of the Sandinista Workers' Central. The
government said it was meant as a warning to other labor leaders to
obey the law and not cause disorder.
   The Sandinistas say they are supporting the strikes because the
new government's policies are threatening the gains of their
revolution. They contend the government has broken its promises not
to fire public employees, and say the unions are entitled under the
constitution to a say in making national economic policy.
   Public employees won a 100 percent salary increase and other
concessions during a crippling Sandinista-led strike in May.
   Despite the government's warning, the work stoppages continued
to spread.
   About 3,800 telephone and postal workers joined the strike
Wednesday night. Operator-assisted international calls were not
going through, which caused considerable difficulties because most
Nicaraguans do not have direct-dial capability. Telex service
continued normally.
   The telephone and postal workers were staging what their leaders
called a ``crossed arms strike,'' similar to a sit-in.
   On Thursday, about 12,500 bank employees began a similar strike
action. Banks were open but no service was available.
   About 3,500 employees at the ministry of agriculture also went
on strike Thursday, union leader Jose Angel Bermudez said.
   Radio Nicaragua reported Wednesday night that thousands of farm
workers had also gone on strike.
   Ramiro Guardian, vice-president of the Council of Private
Enterprise, a major business group, said the strikes were
preventing the planting of cotton, an essential crop in Nicaragua.
He blamed the labor protests on ``hot-headed Sandinistas.''
   Strikes continued Thursday at other government offices,
including the customs service and the foreign, labor, construction,
transportation, commerce and finance ministries.
   Air traffic controllers at Sandino International Airport
threatened to strike, and electrical workers announced they may
begin scaled cuts of energy to the country.
   Students at most universities were also on strike. On Wednesday,
students briefly took over the state-owned Radio Nicaragua and
National Television System to read statements in favor of the
strike.
   Jimenez claimed some 80,000 workers in both the public and
private sector were on strike as of Thursday. But estimates of the
number of strikers by the Sandinista-led unions have been
exaggerated since the strike began on Monday.
   Ariel Bucardo, president of the Farmworkers' Federation, said
1,000 members of his group were en route to Managua, the capital,
to support the strikers. He said his union wanted the government to
repeal laws allowing the return of some land confiscated by the
Sandinistas to the original owners.
   The Sandinistas redistributed some 5 million acres of land, most
of it held in absentia by wealthy Nicaraguans who fled abroad
during the Sandinistas' 10 years in power.
   Mrs. Chamorro's new economic plans include returning most
state-owned companies to the private sector and reorganizing the
government _ both moves likely to cause job reductions.
   The Sandinistas led by Daniel Ortega were defeated in the Feb.
25 elections by Mrs. Chamorro's 14-party coalition.

   Potentially fatal clots that develop after
surgery may be triggered by high levels of a blood protein,
suggests a study published today.
   Mice that carried a human gene to make them produce excessive
levels of the protein developed clots in their tails and hind feet,
researchers reported.
   If further research confirms the link, patients at risk for
clotting may be identifiable before surgery by measuring their
levels of the protein, said researcher Laurence Erickson of The
Upjohn Co. in Kalamazoo, Mich.
   At-risk patients could receive preventive therapy and
researchers may someday find a way to lower a person's level of the
protein as a preventive step, he said.
   The protein, called plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 or PAI-1,
normally keeps the body from destroying clots prematurely.
   The clotting condition is called deep venous thrombosis. Clots
appear in veins, usually in the leg. They can kill if they break
free and travel to the heart or lung.
   Clotting can appear after major surgery, in cancer patients and
people with an inherited tendency to develop them. The condition is
treated with anti-clotting drugs.
   Between 200,000 and 300,000 cases occur in the United States
each year, with perhaps 20,000 or more deaths a year, said venous
thrombosis researcher Dr. Philip Comp of the University of Oklahoma.
   Comp said he believed it would be difficult to manipulate PAI-1
levels to prevent the clotting disorder. As for indicating patients
at risk, he said high levels in the blood may signal conditions
unrelated to the risk. Even if high levels were related, he said,
only a small percentage of people deemed at risk would probably get
clots anyway.
   Erickson and Upjohn colleagues presented their study findings in
today's issue of the British journal Nature.
   The mice were given the extra PAI-1 gene before birth. Clotting
appeared shortly after birth, and resolved after production of
PAI-1 fell back to normal.

<HEAD>Men Make Less Sperm in the Summer: Is it the Heat?</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Aging Reversal, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the weather heats up, sperm production goes
down, and this may explain why fewer babies are born in the
springtime, according to a study today.
   While the study documents that men produce less sperm during the
summer, it does not definitely explain why.
   Population experts have long noticed that fewer babies are born
in the spring months than at any other time of the year.
   The researchers, based at the Chemical Industry Institute of
Toxicology in Research Triangle Park, N.C., dismissed one obvious
explanation for the summertime dearth of conceptions.
   They said that ``the available evidence'' does not support the
idea that because it's so hot, people simply have sex less often in
the summer.
   What they found instead was that ``semen quality'' deteriorates
during the summer.
   ``This phenomenon may account at least in part for the reduction
in the birth rate during the spring in regions with warm
climates,'' the researchers concluded.
   The study, directed by Dr. Richard H. Levine, was published in
the New England Journal of Medicine. It was conducted on 131 men in
steamy San Antonio, Texas.
   All of the men worked outdoors at least part of the day. Their
sperm concentrations were one-third lower in summer than in winter.
   About 18 percent of their children were born in the spring,
compared with almost 30 percent in the fall.
   ``There can no longer be any doubt that concentration-related
measures of semen quality are reduced during the summer,'' the
researchers wrote.
   Exactly why, however, is unclear. High temperatures interfere
with the testicles' ability to make sperm. But in this study,
summer sperm production was lower even in those who spent part of
the day inside in air conditioning. So torrid summer weather may
not be the whole answer.
   ``The immediate implications of these findings is that although
sperm counts are lower in the summer, the mediating factor is not
the heat of the summer,'' wrote Dr. Peter J. Snyder of the
University of Pennsylvania.
   In an editorial in the journal, he suggested another possible
explanation: Maybe it's the extra daylight, not the heat, that
makes men less fertile in the summertime.

<HEAD>`PG-13' Library Card Would Limit Kids to Children's Room</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Thursday AMs report.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>OAK LAWN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   See Dick and Jane run _ as long as it's
not from the children's room to the rest of the Oak Lawn Memorial
Library, where trustees have adopted a ``PG-13'' library-card
policy.
   Beginning in September, parents of children under age 14 will
have the option of a library card that would restrict their young
to the children's room of the library. Period.
   Time magazine _ in the periodical area _ would be off limits.
Ray Bradbury's book, ``Fahrenheit 451'' _ in adult fiction _ would
be out of reach. So would ``Who's Who'' _ upstairs in the library's
reference section.
   Trustees say in an age in which children are bombarded with
violent and illicit images, the card will give parents the option
of confining their children to appropriate reading material.
   Parents who aren't interested in the special card may still get
cards for their children that will give them free rein of the
library.
   ``I think the issue here is parental rights,'' said Dave
Gallagher, a seven-year trustee of the library who voted in favor
of the plan at the board's June meeting.
   ``As far as I'm concerned, the whole policy puts in into the
hands of the parent and takes it away from the library, a
government body,'' said Gallagher. ``The parent has a choice _ and
that's the key word here, choice.''
   Under the plan, kids wishing to leave the library's L-shaped
children's area would be required to show a staff member their
card. If they have the special juvenile card, they will not be
allowed to leave the room.
   The proposal, which passed 3-1 with three members absent, has
met with the approval of some parents.
   ``I wouldn't get the cards for my kids, but I wouldn't criticize
the board for issuing them,'' Grace Kreten said last week as she
browsed through the children's section with her children,
10-year-old Kelly and 6-year-old Peter.
   ``If you're on top of things as a parent, then the library
doesn't have to be,'' Mrs. Kreten said.
   Twelve-year-old Jason Pollard, a fan of sports books, shrugged
when asked about the new policy, saying, ``I don't care what they
do.''
   Others questioned the wisdom of the policy.
   ``The library should be a place where everything is available,''
said Donna Kordas, who regularly brings her four children, ages 2
to 15, to the only library in this suburb south of Chicago.
   Oak Lawn librarians declined to discuss the new policy.
   Oak Lawn is not unique in instituting such a card _ nearby
Arlington Heights has a similar system already in place. Officials
of the American Library Association said they feared the cards were
a bad precedent.
   ``If just one parent signs that card that denies child free
access in the library, we've been set back,'' said association
president Richard Dougherty. ``Kids who read succeed. Anything that
puts barriers in front of that is not good,'' he said.
   The association does not keep statistics on how many of the
nation's 103,000 libraries have such systems, although the trend
has been away from them, said Judith Krug, director of the
association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.
   ``But every once in a while, like in Oak Lawn, the trend is
reversed,'' she said.
   Some child and adolescent psychiatrists also questioned the
proposal.
   ``The more children read, the better off they are,'' said Dr.
Aaron Esman, an adolescent psychiatrist who teaches at Cornell
University Medical College in New York. ``It almost doesn't matter
what it is.
   ``For libraries to discourage children from reading is
inappropriate developmentally and culturally disastrous.''
   A non-profit organization called Friends of the Oak Lawn Library
said it would lobby with the board to reverse its decision.
   ``Ours is a very open library,'' said Monica Stock, secretary of
the group. ``How do they know that a child has that card? Are they
going to mark them with a Scarlet A?''

   The 30 youths from around the country
assembled at this summer sleepaway camp are here to study torts,
not sports.
   Welcome to the National LawCamp, the child of a recently
graduated lawyer's shock, bewilderment and fear during his first
weeks of law school.
   The camp offers students an introduction to law study without
the intense grade competition, the imposing professors personified
by the late John Houseman in the movie ``Paper Chase'' and without
the hefty cost.
   ``One of the things I saw was that a lot of students use their
first year of law school to see if that's what they want to do,''
said camp organizer Chris Salamone, a Fort Lauderdale litigator who
got his law degree two years ago from nearby Nova University.
   The three-week camp is aimed at letting students know what
they're in for at law school for $1,995, compared to typical
tuitions that run into five figures. The campers range from age 15
to the mid-20s. And if they're certain that's what they want, the
camp should give them a headstart on the often-mystifying law
school experience, said Salamone.
   His father, Anthony, has 30 years' experience running summer
sports camps, mostly in New Jersey, and is helping get LawCamp
going.
   The students, staying on the Barry University campus in this
Miami suburb, will find out about the heavy workload and the
competition in a law career, Salamone said. Legal ethics also will
be stressed.
   ``We're not all Michael Cusacks,'' Nova law professor Michael
Flynn, referring to an ``L.A. Law'' television lawyer, told
students as the camp opened Sunday evening. ``We spend very long
hours. It's very hard work, that's all.''
   Ellis Rubin, one of Miami's best-known defense attorneys, was
the camp's first guest lecturer.
   ``You have to pay your dues. You have to put in extra hours.
It's very difficult to break in,'' Rubin said. ``If you reach a
point where you're valuable to other people, then you will receive
your reward.''
   Rubin, an attorney 39 years, said that only in the past 15 years
has he earned a comfortable living.
   If after hearing such de-glamorizing accounts students decide
against a law career, Salamone said, they have saved law school
tuition and ``spent three weeks in south Florida and you will know
more law than 99 percent of Americans. So that can't hurt.''
   The campers will be taught by law professors who then stay
around to study with them and answer questions. Salamone said that
law professors often are inaccessible, leaving beginning students
confused and scared.
   Law school concentrates on analysis and procedure, rather than
the simple answer-oriented teaching most students are used to,
Salamone said.
   ``Law schools don't tell you what they're doing, they just do
it,'' Salamone said.
   The camp also offers mock trials and a Law School Admission Test
seminar and sample test.
   ``It's perfect for this time in my life,'' said Jennifer
Edwards, a Florida International University junior who hasn't
decided on a career. ``I'm not really sure what I'm going to do.
I'm hoping this will kind of push me over the edge.''
   Sixteen-year-old Voselyn Williams, a senior at Miami Archbishop
Curley-Notre Dame High School, plans to become a corporate lawyer.
She sees the camp as good preparation.
   ``I don't want to go into anything blind,'' she said.
   As with any summer camp, there are field trips: to the Broward
County Courthouse, jail and crime lab.
   It's not all statute books and case studies. Time is planned for
pool lounging, softball, volleyball and something that could come
in handy after the future lawyers send their clients' bills out _ a
martial arts demonstration.

   The Moslem pilgrims who crowded into the
Mo'essem tunnel in Mecca were hurrying to perform the ritual of
``stoning the devil,'' the climax of the annual pilgrimage, or hajj.
   Many were running to their deaths.
   What was supposed to be a joyful celebration by 2 million
Moslems from around the world suddenly became a nightmare of
trampled bodies.
   Saudi Arabian officials said 1,426 pilgrims died Monday, trapped
in the stampede in the 600-yard-long tunnel. Hundreds more were
injured.
   The monthlong pilgrimage, which every Moslem must make once, was
coming to its end. Religious fervor was high.
   It was the first day of the three-day Eid al-Adha, or the Feast
of Sacrifice, that marks the prophet Abraham's willingness to
sacrifice his son to God.
   Three piles of stonework represent the three devils who tried to
tempt Abraham away from sacrificing Ishmael as a demonstration of
his faith.
   The hajjis _ the men in seamless white ceremonial robes as
required by Islamic custom, the women in specially tailored clothes
covering them from head to ankle _ were eager to get to the
stone-throwing site in a bowl-shaped vale hemmed in by rocky,
scrub-studded hills.
   The tunnel _ 30 feet wide and 25 feet high _ is carved out of
the Mo'essem Mountain to funnel the pilgrims to the holy site.
   At one end is the tent city where Pakistani and Indonesian
hajjis were camped out after the ceremonies in Mecca, birthplace of
the prophet Mohammed and Islam's holiest shrine.
   The other end leads to the stoning arena, called Gamarat Aqabah.
Nearby, there is a slaughterhouse, used by the hajjis to kill
hundreds of thousands of sheep during the three-day feast.
   It was 10 a.m. when disaster struck.
   Thousands of hajjis who had already stoned the devil were
returning from Gamarat Aqabah on a pedestrian bridge from which
they had cast their pebbles, heading for the tunnel entrance.
   Under the pressure of the human tide, the railing on the bridge
collapsed. Seven pilgrims tumbled 25 feet off the bridge into the
crowd of people coming out of the tunnel.
   The bodies crashing into the throng touched off panic. Only
those at the entrance of the tunnel knew what had happened.
   Behind them, pilgrims continued to move inside. Soon the tunnel,
which has a capacity of 1,000, was jammed with what authorities
later estimated at 50,000 pushing, shoving pilgrims.
   Pilgrims heading for Gamarat Aqabah were also ignorant of what
had happened, and they kept thrusting forward.
   Soon those trapped inside the tunnel began screaming. The panic
spread like wildfire.
   Witnesses said many feared terrorists had struck, as they did in
Mecca last year when a series of bombings killed one man and
wounded 16 others.
   In 1987, more than 400 people were killed in riots that Saudi
authorities say were instigated by Iranian militants.
   Soon after the accident at the mouth of the tunnel, there was a
power failure. No one knows exactly why. The lights went out and
the ventilation system went off.
   The temperature in the open was 112 degrees. The tunnel became a
furnace.
   People began to faint, particularly the elderly, in the
suffocating congestion. Men and women tried to claw their way out
in the darkness, trampling over the fallen.
   It was the same outside.
   ``No one could go forward or back. ... People were falling on
each other, the bodies piling on each other ... There was a mad
rush and screaming,'' an aide to the Interior Minister, Prince
Nayef, said on Saudi television.
   One survivor said: ``It was terrible. People were rushing in
opposite directions. When one stumbled, scores trampled him ... and
hundreds fell on top of them in no time.''
   Another, a Lebanese, sobbed: ``I was pushed and fell over about
20 corpses. Others were still pushing in two directions and walking
on top of me. May God forgive me for trampling on the others.''
   As the scale of the disaster became evident, security police
forced their way through the sea of pilgrims to rescue those
trapped in the tunnel, which by then had become a tomb.
   They sealed off both ends of the tunnel and threw ropes inside
to pull out anyone who could grab hold. They also threw in plastic
bags of cold water for those trapped to drink until they could be
reached.
   First aid squads treated hundreds of victims on the spot.
Ambulances nosed through the crowds, taking the injured to
hospital, the dead to the morgue.
   The wailing and weeping soon diminished, replaced by a numbed
quiet.
   For Islam's faithful, dying in Mecca is supposed to be a joyful
thing. But for those who lost relatives and friends, there was the
ordeal of going around Mecca's 10 hospitals looking for them,
trying to find out if they were dead or alive.
   One man woke up in a hospital bed after being unconscious for 24
hours, shouting for his wife. No one knew where she was.
   Four young Egyptian men with bloodshot eyes stood outside a
morgue seeking word of a missing companion.
   They had been about 10 yards from the mouth of the tunnel when
disaster struck. Their friend had been ahead of them. They never
saw him again.

   Robbers freed a policeman after he
survived a Russian roulette ordeal during a bus hijacking, police
said.
   Authorities said police Cpl. Antonio Dionisio was on a bus that
was flagged down and taken over late Tuesday by five gunmen in
suburban Valenzuela.
   When the robbers discovered Dionisio was a policeman, they took
his six-chamber revolver, removed all but one bullet, and told him
that he could go free if he survived the fourth squeeze of the
trigger.
   ``You are a policeman. You ought to die. But I will give you a
fair play. If you survive this game, I will give you back your
life,'' a witness quoted a robber as saying.
   To the astonishment of the robbers, Dionisio squeezed the
trigger four times without the weapon firing. The robbers let him
go, police and witnesses said. The robbers escaped with money and
valuables from the passengers.

<HEAD>Congress Heading for Showdown on Arts Endowment's Fate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amid escalating warfare between arts
supporters and religious conservatives, the fate of the National
Endowment for the Arts may be decided this summer in a bruising
House floor fight.
   Legislators on both sides agree that when Congress votes on
whether to extend the federal arts agency's life for another five
years, it almost certainly will impose restrictions on the content
of works that receive tax-paid grants from the endowment.
   The furor began more than a year ago with criticism of NEA
support for exhibitions of sexually graphic images by photographer
Robert Mapplethorpe and artist Andres Serrano. In recent months, it
has erupted in a barrage of emotional newspaper and radio
commercials, letter-writing campaigns and court battles.
   Endowment chairman John E. Frohnmayer, caught in the cross-fire
since he took office nine months ago, came under renewed attack
last Friday when he overruled an NEA panel's recommendations and
rejected grants to four avant-garde ``solo performance theater
artists.''
   The People for the American Way Action Fund, a liberal lobbying
group, said Frohnmayer's decision ``has the smell of politics all
over it'' and was intended to placate right-wing critics of the
arts endowment.
   One of the rejected artists, John Fleck of Los Angeles, charged
that ``there's a strong movement going on to wipe out different
voices, to have a homogeneous voice that suits certain people's
morals.''
   Solo performer Rachel Rosenthal of Los Angeles reportedly
refused to accept her $11,250 endowment grant, saying the four
rejected artists were among the best in their field. ``Why should I
be considered clean and they're considered dirty?'' she asked.
   Ms. Rosenthal also refused to sign a controversial pledge that
she would not use endowment funds for obscene, indecent or
blasphemous art _ a condition imposed by Congress last fall at the
urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Endowment officials say that of the 2,000 grants awarded so far
this year, 670 artists or arts institutions have signed the
agreement and received government money, 12 have signed the pledge
with letters of protest and a half-dozen have rejected grant
awards. The rest haven't yet responded.
   On the same day he rejected the four grants, Frohnmayer told an
audience in his home town of Portland, Ore., that the stakes in the
mushrooming controversy were high.
   ``A remarkable experiment that has lasted the last 25 years and
has so enriched our country is indeed threatened with either
extinction or severe crippling because of 20 images out of a
million we have funded,'' he said.
   Frohnmayer, who opposes the Helms amendment, said the arts
community must share the blame for the bitter controversy that
imperils the endowment, an independent, $171-million federal agency
whose arts grants must be matched by local private funds.
   ``We've acted much like spoiled children asking our parents to
continue sending us money regardless of what we do, how we spend it
or whether we are prepared to be held accountable,'' he said.
   NEA officials refused comment on published speculation that
Frohnmayer might resign after the endowment's reauthorization bill
passes Congress. When asked during his Portland speech if he
planned to resign, Frohnmayer answered firmly, ``No way.''
   Although no date has been scheduled for House action on the NEA
bill, arts lobbyists expect a vote sometime before legislators
begin their month-long summer recess in early August.
   Three or four major proposals circulating among House members
include a conservative plan for severe restrictions on NEA grants
and a major overhaul of the endowment that would shift a
substantial portion of grant funds directly to state arts councils.
Some conservatives favor abolishing the endowment.
   At the heart of the debate are conflicting arguments over the
government's proper role in supporting the arts.
   The arts community and its supporters contend that restrictions
on NEA grant recipients amount to government censorship. That
argument is rejected by conservative lawmakers and religious
fundamentalists, who say the real issue is the taxpayers' right to
decide where their money is spent.
   The conflict is dramatized in toughly worded newspaper ads and
radio spots sponsored by People for the American Way and its
nemesis, the Christian Coalition led by evangelist Pat Robertson,
who was a conservative presidential candidate in 1988.
   ``Do you want to face the voters in your district with the
charge that you are wasting their hard-earned money to promote
sodomy, child pornography and attacks on Jesus Christ?'' Robertson
asked in a full-page letter to members of Congress that was
published in The Washington Post and USA Today.
   People for the American Way put such performers as Colleen
Dewhurst, Kathleen Turner and Garrison Keillor on the air to
counterattack.
   ``Imagine a world in which millions of people are at the mercy
of a small band of extremists, in which works of art are subject to
government censorship and freedom of expression is a crime,'' said
Miss Dewhurst. ``Now stop imagining. Welcome to America, 1990.''

<TEXT>
   Democrat Ann Richards is not just looking
for votes, she's looking for her opponent in the Texas governor's
race.
   She's looking for GOP nominee Clayton Williams, the millionaire
oilman and rancher who calls himself ``just a working cowboy.''
   Ms. Richards, the two-term state treasurer, claims that Williams
has been ducking her since he made a series of embarrassing remarks
about women, rape and youthful visits to prostitutes.
   ``The only way Clayton Williams can win is if they keep him from
being in the public eye, if they can keep him from talking to the
press, if they can take him only to places that are very staged,
where he is not given access to the press,'' she said.
   Williams shrugs off her barbs.
   ``We're ahead in the polls. I'm going to work to stay that
way,'' he said.
   Williams for weeks declined to agree to a debate with Richards,
but last week the two candidates finally began trading proposals
about when, where and how to face off.
   ``We don't schedule our campaign for her convenience,'' Williams
spokesman Gordon Hensley said of Richards. ``We're starting to rock
and roll in this campaign and she's still slipping and sliding.''
   Williams drew fire in late March when he compared rape to bad
weather. He said that if it were inevitable, ``relax and enjoy it.''
   Then during a visit to the White House, Williams said he felt
uncomfortable running against a woman.
   ``I said I didn't want to be his mother, I just want to be
governor,'' Ms. Richards retorted.
   Finally, Williams admitted to The Houston Post that he had been
``serviced'' by prostitutes in his youth.
   Aides insist the colorful Republican hasn't lowered his profile.
Both candidates have spoken to many of the same groups _ just at
different times.
   Williams has maintained an active pace, they say, including a
trip to Mexico for trade talks, a Dallas fund-raiser featuring
President Bush and a fast-moving trip to the Texas coast when the
supertanker Mega Borg threatened to dump 38 million gallons of oil
into the Gulf of Mexico.
   ``Any time you move from a primary to a general election, there
are certain dynamics of news coverage that change. It's important
for us to make sure that when you have an event, you go out and
discuss particular issues,'' Hensley said.
   The most recent public opinion poll, published in late May, gave
the edge to Williams.
   The Texas Poll, conducted for Harte-Hanks Communications Inc.,
showed the Republican running ahead, 46 percent to 38 percent, with
a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. The poll
also found a ``gender gap'' in which men more strongly supported
Williams while women looked more favorably on Richards.
   Williams, who spent $6 million of his own money in a $9 million
primary race, is repeating one tactic that helped him win the GOP
nomination. He began airing television commercials late in June,
more than four months before the November election.
   Ms. Richards said she wouldn't try to match the early ads.
   ``One reason is it costs too much money and the public's memory
is short,'' she said. ``There are two sides to Clayton's going up
(on TV) early. The good side is that they must feel like they need
to. The bad side is I know how much TV can drive (poll) numbers.''
   One issue sharply dividing the two candidates is abortion.
   Williams, who opposes abortion except in cases of rape, incest
or danger to a woman's life, assailed Ms. Richards for opposing
legislation that would require teen-agers to get parental consent.
   ``Ann Richards has allowed the liberal, feminist pro-abortion
groups to set her agenda,'' he said.
   Ms. Richards responded: ``Government has no business interfering
in our lives any more than is necessary.''
   The two also duel over who is more qualified to be governor.
   Williams maintains his experience in the oil, gas, cattle and
banking industries gives him the business perspective needed to
control a government that spends $24 billion a year.
   ``I'm an outsider and not part of the Austin establishment. A
Williams administration will challenge the status quo,'' he
promised.
   Ms. Richards links Williams with another millionaire Republican
oilman, retiring Gov. Bill Clements, who had no earlier experience
in public office.
   ``We've played games all these years (by) electing someone who
is not a part of government. And you've seen the results of that.
They cannot make the system work,'' Ms. Richards said.

<TEXT>
   After the floodwaters drained away,
Shahar Banu and her grandson returned to their village and found
the earth slipping under their feet.
   Megaiya's land is eroding fast. As it does every year, the
latest deluge by the monsoon-swollen Jamuna River and the receding
water ate more loose topsoil this summer. But now the erosion is
threatening the village itself.
   ``The countdown to destruction has started,'' said Hedayetullah
al-Mahmud, a civil administrator at Megaiya in the northern
Sirajganj district.
   This summer's flood washed away thousands of huts and weakened
the foundations of the few concrete buildings in the village of
3,000 people.
   District officials fear that in five years the erosion will
trigger the collapse of the region's oldest establishment, a school
built in 1919, as well as a college, a hospital, a granary and at
least 50 shops.
   Annual flooding is a major problem in Bangladesh, a low-lying
delta crisscrossed by hundreds of rivers. Tens of thousands of tons
of rice, the staple of Bangladeshis, are lost to the encroaching
rivers every year and the government reports hundreds of deaths.
   The country is one of the poorest in the world, with a per
capita income of $160. When there are no floods, Bangladesh's 110
million people are often reeling under drought. The coastal areas
are buffeted by frequent hurricanes.
   ``Flooding is a problem which brings temporary sufferings. But
here in our area river erosion is the main problem,'' said Abul
Kalaam Azad, a local official in Megaiya.
   Mrs. Banu and her 15-year-old grandson are resigned to the fate.
   ``Only Allah can help us. We have nothing else,'' said Mrs.
Banu, a 55-year-old widow.
   Besides Megaiya, erosion is threatening the neighboring Kazipur
area, also in Sirajganj district, Azad said.
   Sirajganj, 60 miles northwest of the capital Dhaka, was the
worst-hit in last month's floods.
   More than 600,000 people were stranded in the Sirajganj district
and another 200,000 in neighboring Bogra. People fled their
inundated homes to take refuge atop levees and on the roofs of
brick and cement houses.
   Most houses in the impoverished district have mud-coated bamboo
walls and thatched roofs that wash away within a few hours whenever
the Jamuna floods.
   Azad said the Jamuna has destroyed at least 20 villages in the
past three years, displacing 30,000 inhabitants. Many of them
resettled in neighboring districts or moved to cities, he said.
   Last month, the Jamuna overflowed in at least 43 places during
its 185-mile journey from the hills in the north to the southern
delta on the Bay of Bengal, a Water Development Board official said.
   Officials say privately that government efforts to tackle the
annual deluge in the countryside have been half-hearted.
   They say the focus of the flood control measures has been Dhaka,
a city of six million people, which was badly hit by floods in
1988. At least 1,400 people died nationwide in that year's floods.
   Government officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad's administration has spent the
equivalent of about $31 million to build a giant earthen dam around
Dhaka.
   In Megaiya, many residents are preparing to move.
   On Sunday, workers began emptying the 13-year-old granary and
shopkeepers shifted their wares to another place one mile away.
   ``In another five years the building we are sitting in may be
gone if the river continues its destruction at the current rate,''
al-Mahmud, the civil administrator, said.
   Government officials and local activists apparently have no
solution yet to the erosion.
   ``We think we will have to live with it,'' Azad said.

<HEAD>Hormone Injections Reverse Sagging Flesh and Flabby Muscles of Old
Age</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hormone injections can reverse some of the damage
of aging on the body and give people back the firmer flesh of their
younger years, a study released today says.
   Researchers found that injections of human growth hormone, a
once-rare protein made through genetic engineering, will help old
people build up sagging muscles, take off flab and grow more
youthful-looking skin _ turning back the clock as much as 20 years
in just six months.
   However, they caution that the treatment is not the fountain of
youth, and should not be used routinely until questions are
answered about its long-term effects and possible hazards.
   And while it will firm up bodies, it will not undo many of the
other ravages of aging, such as failing eyes and dying brain cells.
   It's also expensive, with the costs of medicine alone for an
average man running more than $10,000 a year.
   The pilot study conducted at the Medical College of Wisconsin
involved 21 healthy men 61 to 81 years old: 12 received the shots,
while nine received no treatment for comparison. The volunteers who
got the shots said treatment made them look better and feel
stronger, and their wives agreed.
   ``What we saw over six months was that several of the body
composition changes (of aging) were reversed,'' said Dr. Daniel
Rudman, who directed the study. ``These represented the reversal of
one or two decades of aging with regard to these factors.''
   Overall, the men's lean body mass, which is mostly muscle,
increased 9 percent. Their fat tissue decreased 14 percent, and
their skin became 7 percent thicker.
   Until now, doctors have given this treatment, known as human
growth hormone, mostly to children whose growth is retarded because
they don't make enough of the protein.
   However, the body's production of growth hormone also slows as
people reach their 30s. In about one-third of people, it virtually
stops by age 60.
   ``This study is an early investigation of whether it may be
useful to treat this very, very large number of elderly people who
have stopped secretion of human growth hormone,'' Rudman said.
   Such routine treatment would be expensive. The hormone cannot be
given in pill form, and in this study people received three
injections a week. The size of the dose depends on the patient's
weight. Treating a 155-pound man for one year would cost $13,800 in
medicine alone.
   Rudman's research was published in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
   While the study found no serious side effects from the hormone,
the volunteers' blood pressure and blood sugar levels rose
slightly. Rudman said doctors should be cautious in giving the
hormone to elderly people who already have these problems.
   Rudman said he expects the treatment to be used first for
relatively short periods to build up the bodies of frail elderly
people, such as those about to undergo surgery.
   He said the therapy probably would not make people live longer,
but could improve the quality of life. Stronger muscles and
healthier skin should result in better mobility, fewer falls and
less skin sores.
   To prevent, rather than reverse, the effects of aging, treatment
might need to start when people are in their 30s or 40s. Rudman
said much more research into the possible benefits and hazards will
be necessary before such therapy becomes common.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Mary Lee Vance of the
University of Virginia described the work as ``an important
beginning.''
   But she cautioned, ``Because there are so many unanswered
questions about the use of growth hormone in the elderly and in
adults with growth hormone deficiency, its general use now or in
the immediate future is not justified.''
   Among the questions that remain are safety issues about its
effect on metabolism, whether it actually improves muscle function,
at what age treatment should start and how much of the hormone
people need.

<HEAD>Report: Medicare Not To Blame For Failing Rural Hospitals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most rural hospitals that have gone out of
business were losing money because of their high operating costs
rather than inadequate government subsidies, congressional
investigators say.
   Hospitals and members of Congress have blamed a disparity in
Medicare payments to rural and urban hospitals for the financial
plight of many rural facilities.
   But a report by the General Accounting Office appears to support
the Bush administration's contention that rural hospitals are
losing money primarily because their costs are too high.
   ``Medicare was not a major factor contributing to the financial
decline and closure of most rural or urban hospitals that closed
between 1985 and 1988,'' said the report released this week.
   Three-fourths of the failed hospitals either profited from
Medicare patients or lost less money from treating them than other
patients, the report said.
   Under pressure from the health care industry, Congress last year
decided to phase out the differential in Medicare payments to rural
and urban hospitals over five years. The gap was cut from 12
percent last year to 8 percent this year.
   Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., argued that inadequate Medicare
payments had cost rural hospitals money and ``reduced the health
services to rural Americans.''
   Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., introduced legislation this spring to
eliminate the differential altogether next year.
   Most of the troubled hospitals are located in the central United
States, according to GAO studies.
   Some 48 percent of the 140 rural hospitals that closed from 1985
through 1988 were in Texas and other south central states and 22
percent were in the north central region.
   Failed rural hospitals usually are small and have low occupancy
rates, which contribute to their high operating costs, the GAO said.
   Hospitals that closed had occupancy rates 35 percent to 52
percent lower than facilities that remained open, the investigators
said.
   The investigators did say they could not rule out that Medicare
may have contributed ``disproportionately'' to the demise of some
of the hospitals.
   The Department of Health and Human Services' inspector general
found last year that more than 40 percent of rural hospitals made
money on the Medicare program because they operated at lower costs
than other hospitals.
   Hospitals that were losing money tended to be smaller, have
lower occupancy rates and bigger staff-to-patient ratios and keep
patients longer, according to that study.

<HEAD>USDA Expects Banner Year for Farm Income</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Large increases in sales receipts for both
crops and livestock are adding up to what the Agriculture
Department sees as a banner year for farm income.
   As charted by USDA economists, farm sales receipts make up the
lion's share of gross farm income. Big production and strong prices
mean fat receipts.
   Government payments, income from custom work, sales of forest
products and other miscellaneous cash sources account for the
remainder.
   On the other side of the ledger are farm expenses, the costs of
producing crops and livestock. Feed, seed, fertilizer, interest and
all the other related items go into that column.
   In 1990, according to the department's Economic Research
Service, farmers nationally may gross a record of $162 billion to
$168 billion from crops and livestock sales, up from $158 billion
in 1989.
   Livestock sales are expected to be in the range of $84 billion
to $87 billion, while crops sales are forecast at $77 billion to
$81 billion. All figures are rounded.
   Not all products will share in the 1990 gains, however. The
national figures also cloak the inequities farmers always face from
one part of the country to another, from one commodity to the next.
   ``Soybeans probably will be the only major crop showing smaller
cash receipts in 1990,'' says economist Diane Bertelsen. ``Soybean
prices are expected to be down about 15 percent from a year
earlier. And with little change in production, soybean receipts are
likely to be off 4 percent.''
   Bertelsen, writing in the July issue of Agricultural Outlook
magazine, said farmers will probably boost their sales of corn and
other feed grains by $2 billion to $4 billion from last year.
   ``Fall corn prices are not expected to weaken as much as
previously expected, so the annual price could remain near last
year's average of $2.40 to $2.45 per bushel,'' she said.
   The price outlook reflects increased estimates of exports and
domestic feed use, despite a possible boost of 5 percent to 10
percent in production this year. Tight supplies also are a
contributing factor.
   Wheat production is expected to rise one-third this year, while
prices probably will be down 15 percent to 20 percent from last
year's level. Cash receipts for wheat, cotton, fruits and
vegetables may be up less than 5 percent from 1989.
   Bertelsen said total livestock receipts in 1990 are forecast to
rise by as much as $3 billion from last year to the forecast range
of $84 billion to $87 billion.
   ``Reduced pork production and tight supplies are pushing hog
prices up more than 20 percent from last year's average, while
relatively stable beef production is likely to lead to a 3 percent
to 4 percent increase in prices,'' she said.
   Thus, cattle and calf receipts may be up by as much 8 percent
from last year, while hog sales may rise by 20 percent.
   Poultry production is forecast to be up by about 7 percent in
1990, although price declines of around 6 percent or 7 percent
``probably will keep total poultry and egg receipts flat at about
$15 billion,'' Bertelsen said.
   Looking at expenses, the analyst said that prices of feed grain
are showing less weakness than had been expected.
   In the first quarter of this year, economists thought the index
of prices paid by farmers for feed would decline by 20 percent this
year. But now the decline is expected to be only half of that,
about 10 percent.
   As a result, 1990 spending for feed may decline only slightly
this year and remain within $1 billion of 1989's $24 billion.
   ``Uncertainty about feed costs may be behind producers' cautious
approach to expanding herds, despite higher hog and cattle
prices,'' Bertelsen said.
   Spending for manufactured ``input'' items used in production,
overhead and operating expenses probably will increase 3 percent to
5 percent this year. Interest expenses are expected to remain near
$15 billion for the third consecutive year.
   Meanwhile, direct government payments to farmers probably will
drop $2 billion or more to around $8 billion to $10 billion.
   After adding up all the sales receipts and other figures,
deducting expenses and making other adjustments, farmers nationally
are expected to have a net cash income this year of $55 billion to
$59 billion, compared with about $54 billion in 1989. The record
was $57.2 billion in 1988.
   By the agency's reckoning, net cash income ``measures the value
of commodities sold in a calendar year plus government payments,
less out-of-pocket costs.'' Some commodities sold actually may have
been produced in earlier years and stored until marketed.
   In another method of accounting, the agency says ``net farm
income'' may be in the range of $47 billion to $51 billion,
compared with last year's record of $49 billion.
   Net farm income is used to measure the value of agricultural

<HEAD>Family Will Be Tired of Tires, But a Bargain's a Bargain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEBURNE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>

   The only thing standing between the
Mosleys and their dream home is about 250,000 tires.
   But Willie Mosley Jr. and his family figure the 2.47 acres of
land they bought at a constable's auction Tuesday is a bargain at
$313, despite the mountain of work they face clearing away the
radials discarded on the property.
   ``We're just working people,'' said Mosley's wife, Carol.
``Where else are we going to be able to buy a piece of land for
$313, and all you have to do is clear some tires off of it?''
   Johnson County officials had foreclosed on the property because
previous landowners owned back taxes. Officials then discovered the
tires that litter the landscape, piled up to 10 feet high in some
areas.
   Health officials gave the county until Oct. 1 to remove the
tires or risk fines of $25,000 a day. But the Mosleys discovered a
2-year extension was available.
   No one else bid on the property and Mosley got it for the $313
at which Constable Steve Curlee started the bidding.
   The Mosleys plan to put a mobile home on the property, 30 miles
southwest of Dallas.
   And for the next two years, Mosley, his wife, their two
teen-aged sons and three married daughters and sons-in-law will cut
up tires with chainsaws and lug them away in a truck the family
bought.
   The family hopes it will not have to saw up all the tires,
though.
   ``There's a number of things you can do with them,'' Mrs. Mosley
said. ``Some people need tires for playgrounds. Or people who want
them to put around racetracks. Anybody who wants them, send them
out here. They're free for the taking.
   ``Just don't bring any more.''

   Frank Sinatra celebrated American Independence Day
by performing in the country that still sometimes thinks of the
United States as ``the colonies.''
   ``I asked my agent if it was smart to book an act in London on
July 4th,'' the 74-year-old Sinatra said during his show Wednesday
night at London Arena.
   The audience laughed and applauded warmly as Sinatra broke into
the opening bars of ``Strangers in the Night.''
   For more than an hour, Sinatra sang his favorite tunes,
including ``My Way,'' ``New York, New York,'' and ``A Foggy Day in
London Town.'' He sipped a glass of bourbon between songs, stopping
at one point to toast the bandleader _ his son, Frank Sinatra Jr.

   Former President Jimmy Carter gave President
Bush mixed reviews after accepting Philadelphia's $100,000 Liberty
Medal.
   ``I've been extremely disappointed in President Bush on
environmental issues,'' Carter said Wednesday after the gala
Freedom Festival at Independence Hall.
   ``In almost every case he's come down basically on the same
positions as James Watt,'' said Carter, referring to the
controversial interior secretary under Bush's predecessor,
President Reagan.
   ``But on other things, in national affairs, I think Bush is
doing a great job,'' Carter, a Democrat, told reporters who asked
for his assessment of the Republican administration.
   The birthplace of the Declaration of Independence celebrated the
nation's birthday with a giant cake, a parade, a concert and
fireworks.
   Carter helped Mayor W. Wilson Goode cut the cake, which was then
distributed to thousands of spectators.
   The former Georgia governor said he would use the Liberty Medal
prize money for humanitarian causes. The prize was established in
1988 by We the People 2000, a nonpartisan group of civic and
business leaders. Bell Atlantic Corp. has underwritten the cash
award.

   Veteran actor and stage director Jacques Lassalle
has been named to head the prestigious French theater company
Comedie Francaise.
   He succeeds Antoine Vitez, who died in April. The appointment
was announced Wednesday.
   Lassalle, who turns 54 this week, has directed the National
Theater of Strasbourg since 1983. In 1967 he founded the
Studio-Theatre in Vitry, outside Paris, which he directed until
1983.
   Lassalle said he was ``moved and honored by the warm welcome''
he received from the Comedie Francaise troupe. He said he would
maintain the 1990-91 program of performances planned by Vitez.

   Country-rock star Jerry Jeff Walker
sported an ``Ollinger's Plumbing, Heating and Air Conditioning''
T-shirt on stage to acknowledge the plumber who cajoled him to give
a concert here.
   ``I like a man who knows what he wants and goes and gets it,''
Walker, who also traded his beige felt cowboy hat for a maroon
North East baseball cap, hollered to the screams and shouts of 250
fans who packed his show Tuesday night.
   Walker, 48, catapulted to fame in 1968 when he recorded the
now-classic ``Mr. Bojangles.'' Other hits include ``L.A. Freeway''
and ``Up Against the Wall, Redneck.''
   Chuck Ollinger got the idea of a Walker show in this village on
the shore of Lake Erie so he and his buddies could have front-row
seats to hear one of their favorite singers.
   Ollinger called Walker's agent and struck a deal that Ollinger
would put half the money up front. The amount was not disclosed.
   ``It was a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing,'' said Ollinger, 36.
   But with the help of a local radio station and word-of-mouth
advertising, the $18 tickets sold out in four days.

<TEXT>
   Don't expect to doze listening to the Peoria
Symphony Orchestra. Exuberant conductor William Wilsen's blend of
the classics and rock 'n' roll from the likes of Frank Zappa keeps
audiences hopping.
   The 12-year conductor of the orchestra founded in 1898 said he
breathes new life into symphony standards by Mozart, Beethoven,
Bach and Brahms by mixing them with works by contemporary U.S.
composers.
   ``I feel obligated to keep music alive and not a museum for
music of the 17th and 18th centuries,'' he said. ``I ask my
audience to keep an open mind.''
   Wilsen is a large, barrel-chested man who works into a sweaty
frenzy during rehearsals and performances alike. He's known for
boisterous bobbing and jumping on stage as he urges his musicians
to greater heights.
   To him, music is something both earthly and divine.
   ``It's as close as I get to God, and I want others to move my
audiences the way the music moves me,'' Wilsen said.
   His boldness isn't always welcomed by often-staid symphony fans,
said William Seeback, president of the Illinois Council of
Orchestras.
   ``Audiences like to hear the masterpieces _ the 19th century
European traditional compositions. Bill tries to program
contemporary composers as well to show where we are in the 20th
century,'' Seeback said. ``It isn't always safe programming.''
   Wilsen said the high point of his career was last summer's
concert in Bodensee Festival in Konstanz, West Germany, which drew
seven curtain calls and rave reviews.
   ``We went home feeling pretty damn good,'' Wilsen said. ``Those
were sophisticated audiences. Often, they can be closed-minded,
even stultified audiences. I think we showed we're a very decent
orchestra.''

   The father of U.S. rap music star
Bobby Brown has been charged with raping one 16-year-old girl and
assaulting another in a Brisbane hotel room, police said today.
   Herbert James Brown, 60, was granted bail of $40,000 (U.S.)
after appearing in Brisbane's Magistrate Court today. He was not
required to enter pleas to charges of unlawfully detaining and
raping one girl and assaulting another.
   Senior Magistrate Peter Mitchell ordered Brown to appear in
court for an Aug. 20 hearing.
   The court was told that Herbert Brown has been accompanying his
son on an Australian tour. Police said Herbert Brown met one of the
girls, both 16, at a nightclub on Wednesday and that she
accompanied him back to his hotel room.
   Herbert Brown has denied having sexual contact with the girl,
the court was told. Police said another girl in the room was
assaulted by Herbert Brown but fled and called for assistance.
   Bobby Brown, a former member of the group New Edition, won
awards for best male vocalist and best album for ``Don't Be Cruel''
at the 17th annual American Music Awards in January. The album has
sold 5 million copies.

   The weather was hot as a firecracker, but Americans turned out
by the millions Wednesday to celebrate the birth of their nation on
the Fourth of July with pyrotechnics, parades and picnics.
   In California, a quarter of a million people got up early or
stayed up late to watch a fireworks display over Santa Monica Bay
by dawn's early light.
   ``America's Birthday Cake'' _ a giant pastry big enough to serve
25,000 people _ was cut in Philadelphia, where it all began 214
years ago. Former President Carter received a medal and $100,000
award, and urged Americans to work anew for freedom and equality.
   Holiday festivities took a sad turn in Connecticut, when 19
people were injured Wednesday night when an errant shell from
Torrington's Independence Day fireworks display shot into the
crowd, authorities said. A 3-year-old suffered multiple burns.
   American flags, always in abundance on Independence Day, were an
especially hot item this year. Flag merchants in New York and a
small-town Louisiana mayor said the flag-burning issue had made
showing the flag more popular.
   ``Some people are burning them up. We're hanging them up,'' said
Glenmora Mayor Tyrone Dale, whose central Louisiana town of about
2,000 people flew 50 flags in a special display on Main Street.
   ``It's been a banner year, and that's not just a flag company
joke,'' said Steve Sevits, vice president of sales for the Uneeda
Flag company near Albany, N.Y.
   Parking was patriotic at Six Flags Over Texas in Arlington,
where teen-age attendants took it upon themselves to get motorists
to park by color in red, white and blue lines of cars.
   ``The guests realized what they were doing, and got just as much
enjoyment out of it as the parking lot attendants,'' said Six Flags
spokeswoman Sherry Hatfield.
   Spectators braved the baking sidewalks of Chicago's Michigan
Avenue to watch a four-hour Shriners parade, while townspeople in
Taylorville gathered for an Independence Day bash featuring a
singing circuit judge.
   It was hot, hot, hot almost everywhere. Baltimore sizzled at 100
degrees, and New York burned, where at 92 degrees it was the
hottest day of the year as 800,000 people headed for the beach at
Coney Island. It was 105 degrees in Enid, Okla.
   High-temperature records for the date were snapped in Erie, Pa.,
where it was 97 degrees, Milwaukee (also 97), Syracuse, N.Y. (95)
and Detroit, (98), and tied or broken in other cities in the East
and Midwest.
   ``I would say it's a scorcher,'' meteorologist Bob Laplante said
in Charleston, W.Va., where the high was 92. ``There's much more
humidity today, too. That makes it doubly worse.''
   When darkness eased the heat a bit in New York City, 1.3 million
people cheered Macy's annual fireworks display on the East River.
   It wasn't all fun, fireworks and parades. The Veterans of
Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America and AMVETS
organized a midday rally in a park in St. Petersburg, Fla., to push
for better health benefits.
   At least 2,000 veterans, many in uniforms bedecked with campaign
ribbons and carrying flags or wearing flag-lapel pins, attended the
rally under warm, sunny skies.
   ``We've had all we can stand. The system is underfunded and
we're not going to take it anymore,'' said VFW Executive Director
Larry Rivers.
   At the Spirit of America Festival in Decatur, Ala., former
hostage Frank Reed, who was released in April after 44 months of
captivity in Lebanon, received the annual Audie Murphy Patriotism
Award.
   In Washington, D.C., spectators on the Mall between the White
House and the Capitol were entertained by musical performances. A
free concert at the Capitol was planned for the evening by the
National Symphony Orchestra, followed by a fireworks display at the
Washington Monument.
   The estimated 250,000 people who crammed Santa Monica and
adjacent beaches for the ``Dawn's Early Light'' fireworks display
were also treated to a performance by the Los Angeles Pops
Orchestra.
   Patty Gleeson watched before starting her morning job as a
waitress.
   ``They were really great, and the beach was just packed,'' Ms.
Gleeson said. ``It was worth getting up early.''
   The display was moved from night to early morning three years
ago to cut down on gang violence. But two people were wounded
Wednesday in shootings police blamed on gangs, one critically.
Three men and a teen-ager were arrested in the shootings.
   Dianne Hollen of Venice Beach stayed up after her performance as
a local standup comic. She found the spectacular ``kind of short
and disappointing ... It only lasted about 15 minutes.''
   She described the crowd as ``pretty well-lubricated and rowdy.''
   In Connecticut, a shell veered off into a crowd of thousands at
Fuessenich Park during the grand finale of the fireworks display at
Torrington's 250th anniversary party, said fire Lt. Nick Florio.
   ``People were crying. Everybody got blood on them. It was
disgusting. It just misfired and hit people,'' said Jody Lothier,
who was watching the display.
   Two women were listed in serious condition with burn injuries
late Wednesday at a Torrington hospital. Three-year-old Robert
Shopey, who suffered multiple burns, was in stable condition at a
hospital in nearby Hartford.
   In Philadelphia, Carter received the second annual Philadelphia
Liberty Medal and the $100,000 for his international peace and
humanitarian activities.
   The former president, standing under a sizzling sun in front of
a flag-draped Independence Hall, then helped city officials cut and
serve ``America's Birthday Cake'' to a crowd of thousands.
   At Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's Virginia home, Gov. L. Dougls
Wilder told 48 people taking the oath of citizenship that they have
a social and moral obligation to help others become free.
   Wilder, the nation's first elected black governor, said
Monticello was appropriate for the ceremony because freedom-loving
people everywhere invoke the name of Jefferson.
   ``Today and for the rest of your lives you will know the joy and
hope of freedom,'' Wilder said. ``This morning, your rights as an
American citizen and a human being are being recognized.''

   Western leaders began arriving Wednesday for a
summit to overhaul NATO for a less militarized future as President
Bush said Moscow could ease the flow of financial aid by curtailing
defense spending.
   Faced with a rapidly diminishing threat from the Soviets,
leaders of the 16 NATO countries will open two days of talks
Thursday to discuss the political and military future of the
alliance.
   There were stirrings of unease from British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher, the host for the meeting, about U.S. proposals
to make NATO appear less threatening to Moscow.
   ``The prime minister's consistent point has always been that you
don't prevent war by going soft,'' a British government source
said. ``You prevent war by keeping up your guard and by deterring
anybody who might have belligerent ideas.''
   Bush arrived in London shortly after dawn Thursday after an
overnight flight from Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Wrapping up a seaside vacation, he told reporters he would look
more favorably on Western aid for Moscow if the Kremlin spent less
money on defense.
   ``I hope that given the changes in the world they'll be able to
curtail that defense spending some,'' Bush said.
   ``If they do, I think it will be much easier for the West to
give them certain kinds of economic assistance,'' he said. ``It
will be a very good thing.''
   Bush did not mention previous U.S. demands that the Soviet Union
adopt Western-style economic reforms as a condition for receiving
aid.
   While he did not spell out specific goals for reducing Moscow's
military spending, Bush has said the Kremlin should drop its annual
$5 billion subsidy for Cuba.
   Prodded by West Germany and France, Western countries are
debating whether to come to the assistance of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his crumbling economy. Western aid is
widely seen as a way of easing Soviet objections to a united
Germany being a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   West Germany already has agreed to pump $3.1 billion in loans
into the Soviet economy. West European leaders agreed late last
month to consider assistance for Moscow but put aside a proposed
$15 billion aid package.
   For his part, Gorbachev on Wednesday gave himself and the Soviet
leadership two years to improve citizens' lives _ or resign.
   ``I think that in two years, if there are no changes, this
leadership must go,'' Gorbachev told a TV interviewer as he entered
the Kremlin Palace of Congresses on the third day of the Communist
Party's 28th congress.
   It was the first time the Soviet president and party leader, who
is facing bitter criticism from both radical reformers and party
traditionalists, has given himself and the leadership a deadline
for turning around the country's political, economic and social
problems.
   On the eve of the London summit, machine gun-toting police
guarded Heathrow Airport's VIP lounge and sharpshooters watched
from the rooftops as a string of prime ministers, foreign ministers
and defense officials began arriving.
   The early arrivals included the prime ministers of Greece,
Iceland, Denmark and Spain. Canadian Prime Minster Brian Mulroney
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III were arriving late
Wednesday.
   Security was expected to be even tighter on Thursday during
almost simultaneous arrivals by Bush, French President Francois
Mitterrand and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   With the collapse of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact, NATO is
exploring ways to bring the now-outdated military alliance into
line with a changing world.
   Western leaders hope the changes will ease Soviet concerns about
East Germany leaving the Warsaw Pact to join with West Germany as a
united nation in NATO.
   Bush has proposed that NATO leaders formally declare that
nuclear weapons would be used only as a last resort _ a reversal of
the 4-decade-old policy favoring a first-use nuclear option in the
event of attack.
   He also has recommended the eventual withdrawal of 1,470
nuclear-tipped artillery shells from Europe and a reduction in NATO
forces along what is now West Germany's eastern border.
   Western officials released some details of Bush's proposals in
advance, perhaps to bolster Gorbachev against conservative critics
at a Soviet party congress under way in Moscow.
   A senior British governnment source said Mrs. Thatcher was cool
to the idea of declaring nuclear arms as weapons of last resort,
and also was uneasy about the withdrawal of some 1,400 nuclear
artillery shells from Europe.
   Referring to reduced East-West tensions, the source said, ``The
important thing is to recognize the enormity of the changes that
have occurred but not to assume at the same time that all threats
have disappeared.''
   In another step aimed at reassuring Moscow, West German defense
ministry sources said in Bonn that the government was willing to
consider a Soviet proposal that would limit the number of
post-unification German troops to about 400,000.
   That figure would correspond to the combined strengths of Soviet
and U.S. forces in the region under a formula expected to be
approved in conventional force reduction talks in Vienna.

   President Bush departed Wednesday
evening for the NATO summit in London after advising the Soviets
anew to cut their military budget before looking to the West for
economic help.
   Bush flew by Marine One helicopter directly from his oceanfront
home in Kennebunkport to Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire,
then stepped aboard Air Force One for the overnight flight across
the Atlantic after a good-bye kiss from his wife, Barbara, who flew
back to Washington.
   The presidential aircraft left just after 7:25 p.m. and arrived
in London on schedule at 2 a.m., EDT.
   Before wrapping up a six-day respite along the rocky coast of
Maine, Bush got in a final, full day of recreation, including
boating and an early morning round of golf. He headed out on the
links despite a bandaged right hand that he cut cleaning fish he
caught Tuesday.
   He paused on the 18th green at the Cape Arundel Golf Club to
comment on Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze's remark at
the Communist Party Congress in Moscow that the Soviets had
``ruined'' their country by ``squandering a quarter of our budget
on military expenditures.''
   Bush, who has resisted calls by French President Francois
Mitterrand and others to proffer Western aid to the ailing Soviet
economy, said he always maintained the Soviets are spending too
much on their military.
   ``I hope that given the changes in the world, they'll be able to
curtail that defense spending some,'' said the president. ``And if
they do, I think it would be much easier for the West to give them
certain kinds of economic assistance.''
   Bush added that as a former chief of the Central Intelligence
Agency, he was not surprised by Shevardnadze's statement.
   Cutting the Soviet military budget would ``free up funds to do
more at home and it'll also free up Westerners' willingness to try
to assist on the economic front,'' said Bush.
   It wasn't clear whether Shevardnadze meant to refer to the
Soviet government budget or the Soviet economy as a whole. The
United States spends about a quarter of its federal budget on
defense but only about 6 percent of gross national product; a
recent CIA estimate said the Soviet Union probably spends 18
percent of a far smaller GNP on defense and some Soviet economists
have said the proportion could be a quarter or more.
   Bush plans 32-plus hours of talks and ceremony with the 15 NATO
allies.
   He already has sent the NATO partners a proposal for
far-reaching shifts in the alliance's military strategy in light of
the disintegration of the Warsaw Pact.
   A centerpiece will be to declare that the alliance would only
resort to nuclear weapons as a last resort _ a step back from the
``flexible response'' doctrine NATO has relied on since 1967.
   After the whirl of events in the British capital, Bush will hop
back aboard Air Force One Friday for a 10-hour flight to Houston,
where the annual economic summit of the world's seven wealthiest
industrialized nations begins Monday.
   Bush conferred with top advisers earlier in the week at his
Walker's Point summer home on both summits, and spoke by telephone
Tuesday with the prime ministers of Denmark, Belgium and the
Netherlands.
   Bush spent much of his time in Maine golfing, fishing, boating
or playing tennis.
   Since he had to depart before dark on this Independence Day
holiday, the local fireworks were held a night early. Bush watched
the Tuesday night display from the wooden deck of the U.S. Coast
Guard Eagle, a three-masted tall ship.
   Bush readily lifted the bandage on his hand to display his
fishing wound.
   ``Big fish yesterday ... A lot of them,'' he boasted, adding
that he ``speared myself'' while filleting one of them.

<TEXT>
   Fed up with Cuba's refusal to
recognize their government, Panama's leaders have ordered most of
Havana's diplomats out of the country.
   Eleven of the 15 Cuban diplomats accredited in Panama must leave
within 10 days, Assistant Foreign Minister Jose Raul Mulino said
Wednesday. He said the embassy was advised of the expulsion orders
on Tuesday.
   ``Due to the repeated and systematic hostile conduct by the
government of Cuba against the legitimate elected government of the
Republic of Panama,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement,
only the charge d'affaires, the commercial and economic attaches
and the consul will be allowed to remain.
   Cuba has repeatedly refused to recognize the legitimacy of the
government of President Guillermo Endara, which was installed
during the U.S. invasion that toppled strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega on Dec. 20.
   Endara was on his way to victory in May 1989 presidential
elections when Noriega had the voting annulled.
   Noriega's wife Felicidad and several of his associates took
refuge at the Cuban Embassy after the U.S. invasion and former
Noriega legislator Luis Gomez remains there.
   In March, the Panamanian government gave Mrs. Noriega, his

and 10-month-old grandson safe conduct out of the country.
   It also expelled the Cuban ambassador, Lazaro Mora. The
highest-level Panamanian diplomat in Cuba is a mission secretary.
   U.S. troops had surrounded the Cuban Embassy and residence after
the invasion and Noriega opponents picketed the embassy several
times.
   Cuban President Fidel Castro had supported Noriega, who shared
Castro's contempt for Washington after U.S. officials accused the
Panamanian leader of drug trafficking and pressured for his
resignation.
   Noriega, who took refuge in the Vatican's embassy after the U.S.
invasion, later surrendered and was flown to Florida, where he is
awaiting trial on drug trafficking and money-laundering charges.
   Cuban officials refused to speak with an Associated Press
reporter who went to the embassy. There was no unusual activity
around the compound.

<HEAD>Japanese Shower Fujimori With Millions in Gifts For Stricken
Nation</HEAD>

   Peru's president-elect ended a bittersweet visit to
his parents' homeland today with private gifts for his stricken
country, including $66,000 from an elderly woman who wanted to help
Peru's hungry.
   Alberto Fujimori did somewhat better in eliciting private
donations than in gaining promises of aid from the Japanese
government.
   Japanese officials have denied that Peru's request for economic
aid will be treated differently because of Fujimori's Japanese
ancestry, which he emphasized during the five-day visit just as
eagerly as he had while running for the presidency.
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu resisted making specific promises
of aid until Fujimori provides a concrete plan to cope with Peru's
2,000 percent annual inflation and $22 billion foreign debt,
officials said.
   But citizens thrilled by the appearance of the first person of
Japanese ancestry to win national leadership outside Japan showered
the 51-year-old former agronomist with money.
   By mid-morning today, between $5 million and $10 million had
been collected, according to Peruvian Embassy officials.
   Fujimori, who made a triumphant return to his parents' hometown
of Kawachi on Wednesday, was to fly home later today.
   Among the private donors was 81-year-old Haruko Miike of Tokyo.
   Dressed in an elegant grey kimono, the former restaurant owner
handed a check for 10 million yen, or about $66,400, to Fujimori at
a downtown hotel as a gaggle of flashbulbs went off.
   ``I'm happy Mr. Fujimori will become president but I learned
that there are a lot of people suffering from poverty in Peru. I
wanted to do something while I'm alive,'' she told Kyodo News
Service.
   ``Because of the drought, many children are starving,'' Fujimori
told Ms. Miike. ``I'd like to use this to help the children.''
   Another gift of 10 million yen in bills, wrapped in a blue-paper
bundle, was given to Fujimori by 78-year-old Taiji Nagano, a
real-estate company president. He exhorted the president-elect to
``do your best.''
   Fujimori takes office July 28, Peru's independence day.
   Ivan Pinto, a Peruvian Embassy official, said Fujimori had
received gifts from all over Japan during the last few days, mostly
for the victims of a drought that has devastated the coastal areas
of Peru.
   In his meetings with Japanese officials, Fujimori had sought
medium- and long-term Japanese loans.

   A jury convicted a Christian Science couple of
manslaughter in the death of their 2{-year-old son in a case that
weighed religious faith against parental responsibilities to
provide medical care.
   Some jurors cried after finding Ginger and David Twitchell, both
34, guilty Wednesday of involuntary manslaughter in the 1986 death
of their 2{-year-old son, Robyn, who suffered a bowel obstruction.
   ``It has been hard on everyone and it was certainly hard on''
the jury, David Twitchell said minutes after the verdict was read.
``This has been a prosecution against our faith.''
   But prosecutor John Kiernan said the case was about crime, not
religion.
   ``What the case proved is the right to believe is absolute _ the
right to practice is not,'' Kiernan said.
   A sentencing date is to be set Friday.
   The Twitchells remain free, but each faces up to 20 years in
prison.
   Defense attorney Rikki Klieman said the Twitchells will appeal.
   She contends Judge Sandra Hamlin failed to instruct the jury
properly on a religious exemption that applies to child abuse laws.
   The Suffolk County Superior Court jury deliberated more than 14
hours.
   Since 1980, there have been seven prosecutions of Christian
Science parents. Five have been convicted, one acquitted and one
case was thrown out, according to child rights activist Rita Swan,
who said no cases were tried in the 1970s.
   Founded in 1879 by Mary Baker Eddy, the Church of Christ,
Scientist, believes that physical disease, like sin, can be healed
by spiritual means alone.
   Nathan Talbot, a spokesman for the Boston-based Christian
Science Church, said he's confident the verdict will be overturned
on appeal.
   ``We're deeply disappointed. It's still an unresolved issue,''
he said. ``It certainly isn't going to change spiritual healing.''
   Robyn's sickness and death on April 8, 1986, were graphically
detailed in two months of testimony that some experts said placed
the Christian Science Church on trial.
   ``The important thing is to send a message to other Christian
Scientists,'' said Swan, who with her husband founded Children's
Healthcare Is A Legal Duty, Inc. in 1983, after their child died of
meningitis when the Christian Scientist couple relied on faith
healing.
   ``Their church has lied and lied and lied to them,'' Swan said
in an interview from Sioux City, Iowa, where CHILD is based.
   The Twitchells were accused of recklessly and wantonly causing
Robyn's death by denying him conventional medical treatment.
   Trial testimony began May 4 with a jury tour of the Twitchell's
former home in Boston and deliberations began Monday. The
Twitchells now live in Brentwood, N.Y., with their two other
children.
   David Twitchell testified at the trial. His wife did not.
   Prosecution witnesses described what Robyn might have felt
during his last day, from agonizing pain to frequent vomiting.
Medical experts also testified the boy's life could have been saved
by medical intervention, almost up until the end.
   Klieman argued that though the Twitchells made a mistake in not
calling in a doctor, their son did not appear to have a
life-threatening illness. She also said the Twitchells were being
persecuted in violation of Fist Amendment rights to freedom of
religion.
   But Kiernan said parents have an obligation to protect their
children and that they sacrificed their child for the sake of their
beliefs.
   The case was built on testimony from medical experts, emergency
personnel, Christian Science practitioners and former neighbors of
the Twitchells.
   Among key issues were the severity of Robyn's symptoms, his time
of death, his parents' actions in calling in Christian Science
practitioners and whether the Christian Science Church allows
medical treatment when prayer fails.

<HEAD>Strikes Continue As Germanies Merge Economies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German workers who have mounted warning
strikes to press for higher wages and job security are only
increasing the chances that their jobs will be eliminated, West
Germany's economics minister says.
   The minister, Helmut Haussmann, said in an interview published
today by the newspaper Die Welt that East German industry must
become more productive before its workers can afford to make
demands.
   ``In the next few weeks it will become clear who gets the upper
hand psychologically _ whether it's those who bring hope, new jobs
and a new way of life, or the fearful and maybe even the
malevolent,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Lack of self-control on the salary front ``will lead straight to
unemployment,'' Haussmann said.
   Brief warning strikes involving up to 30,000 people began
Monday, the first work day after East and West Germany formally
merged their economies, currencies and social welfare systems.
   The East German news agency ADN said several thousand metal and
shipyard workers continued work stoppages on Wednesday at plants in
northern East Germany.
   The workers are demanding more pay, better on-the-job training
and a guarantee that they will keep their jobs for at least two
years, ADN said.
   But there are few guarantees in the free market into which East
Germany is now entering and economists have predicted that up to
one third of the former Communist state's 8,000 businesses could
fail.
   The experts say as many as half of East Germany's 8 million
workers could lose their jobs under the pressure of competition
from West Germany's powerful and productive companies.
   Haussmann said some of this week's strikes appeared to have been
staged under ``remote control'' _ presumably from West Germany,
whose powerful IG Metall union has been helping its East German
branch recruit thousands of members in recent weeks.
   Amid the labor unrest, the East German Cabinet set Dec. 2 as the
date for electing members to an all-German parliament, and West
Germany's governing coalition gave its assent.
   East Germany's Parliament still must approve it, but that is
unlikely to be an obstacle, because Prime Minister Lother de
Maiziere's government has a parliamentary majority.
   Government sources said de Maiziere would insist that elections
for the all-German parliament be kept separate from West German
elections, even if they occur on the same day.
   The separation of the elections is an important issue because
West German law requires political parties to win at least 5
percent of the vote to obtain parliamentary representation.
   There is no such law in East Germany, and some East German
parties fear they would fail to reach the threshold if forced to
compete in a single election in both countries.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said that if
the 5 percent rule were applied in both countries but the ballots
were tallied separately a party in West Germany would need 2
million votes for representation, while in East Germany only
575,000 would be needed.
   There are about 40 million eligible voters in West Germany, and
approximately 12 million in East Germany.
   Immediately after the election, East Germany is expected to
declare itself unified with West Germany under the West German
Constitution.
   On Friday, Schaeuble and East German Parliament State Secretary
Guenther Krause will begin talks in East Berlin on a second state
treaty to iron out the constitutional and legal aspects of final
unification.

<HEAD>Mandela's U.S. Visit Gave Boost to Civil Rights Movement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBBIE NEWBY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela's U.S. tour gave the American
civil rights movement a glimpse of a hero at a time when it could
use one, associates of the late Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said.
   ``The visit of Mr. Mandela came at a time when the American
people, not just black America, are hungry and thirsty for somebody
who can lift us to another level,'' said longtime civil rights
activist John Lewis, now a congressman.
   But while the heirs to King's civil rights legacy in his
hometown of Atlanta emotionally embraced the South African leader
last week, movement leaders and scholars say it would be unfair to
expect him to rekindle the civil rights movement in this country.
   ``It's hard to me to see it having that effect simply because
the economic and social problems within urban black America are so
serious now and so much more serious than 1968'' when King was
slain, said David J. Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of
King.
   Mandela, the 71-year-old leader of the African National
Congress, was jailed 27 years in a South African prison for
plotting sabotage to overthrow the nation's white minority
government. He was released in February.
   The anti-apartheid leader raised more than $7 million for the
ANC and was greeted by enthusiastic crowds nearly everywhere he
went during his eight-city, 11-day U.S. tour that ended Saturday.
   The Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the King-founded Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, said Mandela's recent visit will
have a lasting effect.
   ``I think Mr. Mandela's inspiration will spill over into several
just causes related to the struggle for justice,'' Lowery said.
``It puts new life into the movement. He has done what we keep
saying we are going to do when we say, `We shall overcome.'''
   Lewis, D-Ga., said it will take grass-roots activism to reignite
the civil rights movement, but he called Mandela's visit ``a shot
in the arm,'' citing the African leader's charisma and moral
message.
   ``Some people say you don't need heroes, don't need leaders. I
disagree,'' said Lewis, who was jailed 40 times between 1960 and
1966 for his civil rights activities. ``Every generation needs some
individual, some flesh and blood embodiment of a cause or an idea.''
   Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, known in the 1960s as militant protester
H. Rap Brown, said Mandela is a ``legitimate champion among the
people,'' but charged mainstream civil rights leaders used Mandela
for their own ends.
   ``They would love to lend themselves to the energy that
surrounds him, the aura that surrounds him. They are obsessed with
raising money and they welcome any person or figure who would allow
them to generate income,'' he said.
   Others said it is dangerous to focus on one person.
   Most American blacks are not looking for a leader to replace
King, said Joseph Windham, a professor of African history at
Atlanta's Morehouse College.
   ``You always have a group of people looking for a messiah, a
great leader, a great image,'' Windham said. ``But I think the
majority of people understand they have to identify with the
movement, the liberation struggle. ... It's dangerous to focus on
one particular individual because if something happens to them, the
movement is decapitated.''

<TEXT>
   Olive Ann Burns, whose battle with lymphoma
prompted her to write the 1984 novel ``Cold Sassy Tree,'' has died
at age 65.
   Ms. Burns had been ill with lymphoma since 1975, and was
hospitalized for several weeks before her death Wednesday at
Piedmont Hospital.
   The name of a mythical town, ``Cold Sassy Tree'' is about
small-town life in north Georgia in 1906. It became a
Book-of-the-Month Club alternate selection in 1984, and was made
into a cable television movie in 1989.
   Ms. Burns had worked for Atlanta Weekly, a former Sunday
magazine of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ms. Burns later
worked as a free-lance writer and advice columnist for The Atlanta
Constitution.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Sunday.
   She is survived by a son, John A. Sparks of Colorado Springs,
Colo.; a daughter, Becky Sparks of Atlanta; a brother, William H.
Burns of Atlanta; and two sisters, Margaret Turn of Bushkill, Pa.,
and Jean LeGrand of Conyers.

   GORBACHEV'S DEADLINE: Mikhail S. Gorbachev, speaking to

   ECONOMIC REFORM: Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin defends
the transition to a market-based economy as necessary ``if we want
to be done with the shame of lines, speculation and closed stores.''
   He says the Communist Party has no choice but to embrace the
change: ``Any party or social organization that tries to hinder

inevitably be pushed aside from the historical battle and meet
defeat.

however, Koltsov is not given the floor and the sign is quickly

<TEXT>
   Rebels are slowly advancing from suburb
to suburb of this capital, where an atmosphere of fear and
lawlessness prevails along with expectations President Samuel Doe
will soon take flight.
   But this morning, though gunfire was being heard in some
outlying areas of the city, Doe's forces remained in control.
Christian radio station ELWA, monitored in neighboring Abidjan,
said the city streets remained empty.
   The besieged Liberian leader met Wednesday with the U.S.
ambassador, whose government has offered Doe safe passage.
   Doe has agreed in principle to resign, seeking assurances of
safety for himself and members of his minority Krahn tribe. Most of
Doe's Cabinet ministers and senior administration officials have
fled the country.
   Rebel spokesman Thomas Woewiyu, who is based in the United
States, accused the U.S. government of delaying Doe's exit. He said
Wednesday that Washington opposes rebel leader Charles Taylor
taking power himself.
   The United States has publicly supported an effort by several
West African countries to negotiate an end to the war.
   The capital would be the final conquest for the rebels, who
mounted their insurgency six months ago in the West African nation
of 2.4 million people.
   The city of a half million people has been without water or
electricity for the past week and plagued by shootings and lootings
by army soldiers.
   At least 17 bodies were found Wednesday at different locations,
some of them shot, witnesses said.
   U.S. Ambassador Peter De Vos drove under heavy U.S. Marine guard
through streets of shuttered and barred shops to Doe's
fortress-like mansion for about an hour of talks Wednesday.
   Officials declined to give details of their discussion.
   Washington put its naval task force, which includes 2,100
Marines, on alert off the Liberian coast. It has offered to
evacuate Doe, but he has not asked to leave, the U.S. State
Department has said.
   The rebels, who accuse Doe of corruption and human rights
abuses, renewed their offensive after peace talks broke down last
month.
   Soldiers at a roadblock in Monrovia said 1,000 rebels were
advancing on the eastern suburb of Congo Town from Paynesville
suburb, which echoed with artillery and gunfire Wednesday.
   Firing also could be heard on the city's western outskirts.
   Rebel sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said only
800 men were involved in the assault on the capital.
   Soldiers went on a spree of shooting and looting shops during a
dusk-to-dawn curfew in Monrovia on Wednesday.
   The troops, some of whom appeared to be intoxicated, fired into
the air and harassed passers-by for money and cigarettes. Others
roamed the city in stolen cars and pickup trucks bristling with
M-16 rifles.
   Doe has asked for assurances for his own safety and those of
fellow Krahns if he does capitulate.
   But Woewiyu, who participated in the peace talks, said: ``There
will not be any mass retribution. He (Doe) need not make that a
bargaining point.''
   The civil war has pitted the Krahns and Mandingos against the
Gios and Manos, the tribes to which many rebels belong.
   A close Doe adviser, Elvin Jones, minister for presidential
affairs, was the latest Cabinet member to leave the country. Jones
flew to neighboring Ivory Coast on an unscheduled flight Wednesday.
   Liberia's army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Henry S. Dubar, who fled
last weekend, told a newspaper in neighboring Sierra Leone:
   ``A general should know when to retreat. After counting the
casualities and assessing the supplies, arms and ammunitions, a
general must be able to decide whether to continue fighting or not.
I saw our people without light, and drinking unsafe water. At that
point I decided to ground arms.''
   Residents said Doe has armed Krahns who fear that rebels will
slaughter them. Two months ago, he emptied the prisons of criminals
and conscripted them into his rapidly depleting army. Many soldiers
are Krahns.
   One Gio said several of his Krahn friends had been given
U.S.-made, M-16 rifles and army uniforms in the last few days.
   A reporter said he had met a Finance Ministry official, with no
military training, who had also been given a uniform and a gun.
   Doe seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that toppled descendants
of former slaves who founded Liberia in 1847.

<HEAD>Jerusalem Mayor Tries To Show Arab Areas Safe for Jews, Tourists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM RON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Near the garden where the Romans arrested
Jesus, Jerusalem's Jewish mayor sat unguarded in an Arab cafe to
show fellow Israelis and tourists they are safe in the city's Arab
section.
   Mayor Teddy Kollek's effort Wednesday to demonstrate it was
business-as-usual in Arab east Jerusalem came amid the worst wave
of political violence to hit the city since the Palestinian
uprising began in Dec. 1987.
   ``I am trying to take the edge off the apprehension,'' Kollek
said as he drank Arabic coffee at a small outside table in the
tourist cafe near the Garden of Gethsemane.
   The 78-year old Kollek, sitting with his back to the narrow
street and making business calls on a portable telephone, said he
was not worried extremists might attack him.
   ``I never have guards,'' he said. Other politicians rarely go to
east Jerusalem without armed security men, and the main Arab
shopping streets are heavily patrolled by police.
   The cafe Kollek visited was empty except for one Palestinian who
stopped to see the mayor about a problem. Few Israelis go to east
Jerusalem because of the violence of the uprising.
   Two weeks ago, police placed a curfew on a nearby Arab
neighborhood after two Palestinians were killed by police during
anti-Israeli rioting.
   Curfews are rare in Jerusalem, which has been calmer than the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. Of the 721 Palestinians killed
in clashes with Israelis during the uprising, seven died in
Jerusalem. Six of the 45 Israeli victims were slain in the city.
   Kollek's well-publicized campaign to dispel fear began Monday in
a cafe near the Old City's Damascus Gate, where more than a
half-dozen Jews have been stabbed in the past two years.
   Lately, violence also has spread to Jewish sections of Jerusalem.
   One Israeli was killed and more than 14 wounded in three pipe
bombings in the past month. Jews rioted in response to the stabbing
of an 11-year-old boy and persistent Arab stoning of cars.
   Jerusalem is home to some 120,000 Palestinians and 354,000 Jews,
120,000 of whom live in neighborhoods built in the eastern sector
after it was captured in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed by
Israel.
   Kollek, mayor since 1965, enjoys considerable support from both
communities. He is seen by many Arabs as a political moderate who
does not discriminate against the city's Arab minority.
   ``We like Mr. Kollek,'' said Khaled Ansari, the Palestinian who
runs the cafe where Kollek set up shop Wednesday.``He has done good
things for us.''
   Kollek, visibly uncomfortable in the hot Middle Eastern sun,
said he would probably have to limit the hours spent in Arab
neighborhoods in his confidence-building campaign.
   ``I get much more work done in my office,'' he explained.

<HEAD>First Court Award for Women Over Discrimination in Promotions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A Japanese court has ruled for the first time that
female workers were denied promotions due to sex discrimination,
awarding 18 women a total of $640,000 in lost wages.
   The lawsuit, which took 10 years to wend its way through the
court system, was filed by women who worked for a semi-governmental
medical insurance fund.
   ``This is an epoch-making ruling that will lead to making other
corporations review their labor practices,'' said Eiko Shinotsuka,
a labor economist at Tokyo's Ochanomizu Women's University.
   ``There are many other Japanese companies discriminating against
females,'' she said after Wednesday's ruling.
   In addition to the $733,000 requested in the lawsuit, the
plaintiffs asked that the women be given promotions allegedly
denied on the basis of sex. The court refused, saying that it could
not direct such personnel decisions.
   The women employees of the Social Insurance Medical Fee Payment
Fund charged that fund agreements in 1978 to provide raises and
promotions for only male employees violated Japanese law.
   Women comprised about half of the fund's total 6,300 workers.
   The Tokyo District Court said promoting the male employees while
excluding their female colleagues constituted sex discrimination.
   It awarded $640,000 in lost wages that the women would have
received if promoted, court officials said today.
   ``It was a long fight,'' said Yoko Tsuji, one of the 18
plaintiffs. ``I'm very happy if this ruling will help other women
victimized by discrimination,'' she told the newspaper Yomiuri
Shimbun.
   Japan's Constitution forbids discrimination based on sex, and
its labor laws require equal treatment where salaries are concerned.
   In another development, female members of Parliament on
Wednesday protested the appointment of a man as the new head of the
Women's Bureau, a division of the Labor Ministry. Hyakutaro
Takahashi will be the first man to occupy the post since the bureau
was established in 1945.
   Although women's voices are increasingly being heard in
government, Japan's women's movement is small. The nation's first
sexual harassment case was filed only last year, but since then the
number of such complaints has ballooned.

<HEAD>Former National Poster Child Takes to Scuba Diving</HEAD>

   Christopher Rush walks underwater
and can even jump and do a flip.
   That's not bad for the 1984-85 Muscular Dystrophy national
poster child who's had to use a wheelchair for most of his 13 years.
   Christopher is taking scuba diving lessons along with his
parents and 6-year-old sister, Julie, in suburban Detroit.
   ``It's the first time I've ever been able to walk or jump. I can
walk underwater and jump and do a loop-the-loop,'' Christopher said
in a recent interview. ``I think my legs have even stretched.''
   It all began when Christopher and his dad, Richard, watched a
scuba diving program on cable television. A friend of the family
suggested lessons with Jerry Rowe at the Michigan Underwater School
of Diving in Lincoln Park.
   ``Jerry Rowe is a great inspiration. He's very patient. I'll
say, `I can't do it.' Then he'll say, `I don't want to hear that.'
Then he's so good to me. If it's too uncomfortable, we'll stop,''
Christopher said.
   Rowe said he was a bit apprehensive at the start, partly because
of concern that Christopher might have trouble holding the
mouthpiece in place underwater.
   ``I remember when I first met Chris. I patted him on the head
and his head dropped to the side. I felt terrible,'' Rowe said.
   But exercises in the pool and at home improved his bite after a
few lessons.
   Local television anchorman Joe Glover, Christopher's pen pal and
the Detroit host of the annual Jerry Lewis Labor Day Telethon, said
he's seen tremendous improvement in the teen-ager in the few weeks
of scuba training.
   Christopher's scuba adventures with the anchorman will be filmed
as a documentary for WJBK. Some of the scenes may be used for the
national telethon.
   When the lessons end this summer, Christopher hopes to earn his
certification in style on a diving trip to the Grand Cayman islands
in the Caribbean.
   ``I just can't wait to see how excited Chris will be diving in
salt water. It's just overwhelming,'' said Kim Shearouse, a
seasoned scuba diver, who watched from poolside. ``He's just going
to love it.''

<HEAD>Americans Abroad Send For Big Macs And California Bubbly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOCELYN NOVECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans celebrating Independence Day abroad dined on Big Macs
in Beijing, sipped California bubbly in Moscow or guzzled beer in
Frankfurt. Even Britain's famed Harrod's department store honored
the ``colonies'' with a festive sale.
   But in the Philippines, home to 40,000 U.S. soldiers and their
dependents, anti-American protesters burned the Stars and Stripes
on Wednesday.
   About 900 Americans showed up to a party at the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing, serenaded by country music. A crew from McDonald's in Hong
Kong prepared the coveted burgers and fries in a tradition begun in
1983.
   Tickets this year were limited. In the past, the event was an
elaborate daylong block party open to all, complete with children's
parades, dragon dances, Chinese acrobatics and firecrackers.
   Last year, however, the embassy held only a small ceremony for
its personnel. Nearly all Americans in Beijing had fled following
the June 3-4 military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   The event was a bit cheerier this year, with the addition of a
barbershop quartet and a band called ``The Back Door'' _ a
reference to the Chinese practice of using personal relationships
to get special favors. The band is made up mostly of embassy
personnel.
   In Moscow, curious Soviets gathered outside the gates of Spaso
House, the residence of U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock, watching
guests arrive at the annual Fourth of July reception.
   Guests mingled on the lawn in hazy sunshine, enjoying California
champagne and hors d'oeuvres.
   Yevgeny Primakov, a member of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
Presidential Council advisory group and non-voting member of the
Politburo, arrived in his Zil limousine and chatted privately with
Matlock on the balcony.
   Dignitaries included Yelena Bonner, widow of dissident Andrei D.
Sakharov; members of the Supreme Soviet legislature; and dozens of
ambassadors and military attaches in dress uniform.
   Several American musicians taking part in the Tchaikovsky
competition also were present.
   A huge American flag was draped from the second story of
Matlock's residence.
   The flag did not fare so well in the Philippines, where about
500 militants protesting U.S. bases in the country burned a flag in
front of the embassy to mark July 4 _ which is also
Philippines-American Friendship Day.
   About 100 riot police stood guard, but there were no clashes.
   ``What festivities should we celebrate?'' the militants said in
a statement. ``In fact, we are the ones being feasted on ... by
American imperialism.''
   The United States ruled the Philippines for nearly 50 years
before independence on July 4, 1946.
   In London, that very British of institutions, Harrods department
store, kicked off its annual summer sale with an American bang.
   Actor John Forsythe _ Blake Carrington of TV's ``Dynasty'' show
_ greeted shoppers outside the store accompanied by baton-twirling
majorettes, a 100-piece Dixieland band and an Uncle Sam on stilts.
   In West Germany, where a quarter million U.S. military personnel
live along with their families, celebrations were held at
Frankfurt's East Park carnival grounds, and included amusement park
rides, an old-fashioned rodeo, and traditional German beer and
wurst.
   In Paris, groundbreaking ceremonies were held for a
multimillion-dollar American Center on the eastern edge of the city.
   Designed by architect Frank O. Gehry of Santa Barbara, Calif.,
it will be the biggest cultural center in Paris, Mayor Jacques
Chirac told guests.
   Despite cool, damp and windy weather, highwire artist Philip
Petit inched across a cable above the crowd, attaching a giant
paint brush and musical key to a red velvet theater curtain adorned
with thespian masks.
   In Bahrain, the U.S. community highlighted its July 4
celebrations by inaugurating a $19 million fortress-like embassy
compound.
   Ambassador Charles Hostler escorted the emir of Bahrain, Sheik
Isa Bin Salman Al Khalifa, to a brief ceremony. Five-year-old
Joshua-Barney Burgess of Merritt Island, Fla., presented the emir
with scissors to cut the ribbon.

   The government is recruiting workers to help
clean up radioactive contamination at its nuclear weapons plants
over the next 30 years.
   The Department of Energy said it will take 50 percent more money
and twice as many people as previously estimated to carry out a
five-year cleanup plan at the waste sites.
   ``We've got to convince the people in the colleges to go and
look at this as the career of the future. ... It's an exciting
career, an interesting career, one that is involved with new
technology,'' Leo Duffy, head of DOE's cleanup office, said in a
recent interview.
   He said there are at least 20,000 job openings over the next 30
years in the field and an annual budget in billions of dollars.
   As the department tries to lure workers into the field, Duffy
said it will face the same image problems it faces every day.
   ``Technology does not always interest every man and woman,'' he
said. ``Distrust in Department of Energy past practices is a
problem. The fact you've got radioactivity is a major problem,''
   Duffy said the lack of scientists and adequate technology are
the biggest hurdles to cleaning up weapons plants that have dumped
high-level radioactivity into the soil and water.

<HEAD>President Declares Parts of Nebraska Disaster Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has declared parts of Nebraska
a major disaster area because of the severe storms, tornadoes and
flooding that struck the state last month.
   The declaration, issued Wednesday, makes federal funds available
for the recovery effort in a 14-county area.
   The counties are: Buffalo, Colfax, Dodge, Douglas, Gage,
Hitchcock, Madison, Platte, Red Willow, Sharpy, Sherman, Stanton,
Thurston and Washington.
   The federal aid includes temporary housing, grants, low-cost
loans and other help for both individuals and business owners. The
government also normally pays up to 75 percent of the costs of
repairing or replacing damaged public facilities.
   The severe weather struck the state beginning June 10.
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency is still surveying other
areas of the state to determine whether the disaster declaration
should be extended to other counties.
   Edward A. Thomas of FEMA's Boston regional office was named to
coordinate federal recovery operations.

<HEAD>Architect of Japan's Industrial Dynamo Says It's Time to Gear Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HIRSH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government ministry that helped engineer
Japan's export-fueled economic boom says the global powerhouse must
now turn inward and set its own house in order.
   Funding priorities, once almost exclusively targeted to
industrial growth, should shift to the nation's frayed
infrastructure and frustrated consumers, says the an advisory
report approved today by the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
   While short on specifics, the ministry's vision for the 1990s
addresses many of the demands for economic reform made by the
United States in talks that led to last month's agreement on ways
to tackle the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.
   These include a push for more spending at home on public works
such as roads, sewers and parks _ ``areas in which Japan lags
behind other major developed nations,'' a summary of the report
said.
   The report also repeatedly urges that Japan make life easier for
its high-paying consumers, who should have ``the opportunity to
choose what to purchase and the chance to decide what price to
pay.''
   It was an oblique admission that prices have been kept
artificially high by government-protected home markets, where the
staple food, rice, costs several times more than on world markets.
   The ministry's criticism seems to contradict its own annual
white paper, issued two weeks ago, which concluded that the high
trade surplus with the United States was caused by natural factors,
not closed markets.
   The report also warns, however, that manufacturing is still
vital to Japan's economy. It recommends that the government nearly
double funding of research and development to about 1 percent of
gross national product.
   Kunio Morikiyo, director of the ministry's Policy Planning
Office, denied at a news briefing that the push for internal reform
was a response to the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative
talks with the United States.
   Nonetheless, the report echoes policy guidelines issued in May
by a panel of bureaucrats and lawmakers from the governing Liberal
Democratic Party.
   Those guidelines also were believed to reflect Japan's eagerness
to resolve the unremitting trade dispute between the world's two
most powerful economies.
   ``Internal reform is a must,'' Morikiyo said, if Japan is to
avert a worsening of economic friction between Western countries,
particularly in the vacuum left by the disintegration of the
Communist East bloc.
   ``It is extremely urgent that Japan find solutions to these
problems during the current decade, while it still has a strong
investment capacity,'' the report says.
   Among other key recommendations of the report, MITI says Japan
should:
   _Increase the housing supply by solving the ``the expanding
bubble of land prices;'' Property tax reform and zoning changes
have been proposed as solutions.
   _Take the lead in protecting the global environment,
particularly by reducing the level of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere;
   _Reduce working hours to 1,800 a year from 2,076 in 1989,
despite the difficulty caused by a tight labor market;
   _Advance the position of women by ``building a social framework
that enables men and women to cooperate and share domestic tasks .
.. that until now have fallen mostly on women.''

   Thunderstorms moved across parts of the Midwest early today, and
lightning storms knocked out power in upstate New York.
   Temperatures cooled overnight in the Plains and Midwest, where
record highs were set on the Fourth of July. Northern Texas today
was again likely to see temperatures soar past 100 degrees, the
National Weather Service said.
   Temperatures over 100 degrees also were expected in western
Tennessee.
   Thunderstorms crossed the Maine coastline early today, and rain
fell in northern New Mexico and Portland, Ore.
   Showers and thunderstorms were likely today along the eastern
flank of the Rockies. Storms also were expected to develop along a
cool front stretching from the central Plains through the
Mississippi Valley and lower Ohio Valley.
   Power outages were reported across a four-county region in
upstate New York early today after a violent lightning storm.
Storms dumped as much as 2 inches of rain in the Saranac Lake area
Wednesday during a three-hour period.
   More than 2 inches of rain fell in two hours period and caused
minor washouts at Cambridge and Jeffersonville, Vt. As much as 3{
inches of rain washed out dirt roads near Worcester, Va.
   The high temperature Wednesday in the Lower 48 states was 110
degrees at Borrego Springs, Calif., Lake Havasu City, Ariz., and

<TEXT>
   Once again the White House and Congress are at
odds over how to protect a revered American institution.
   First it was the American flag. Now, it's the American family.
   Congress passed legislation requiring employers to grant parents
up to three months of unpaid leave for medical emergencies or the
birth or adoption of a child. Bush vetoed the bill, saying the
measure forces businesses to provide a benefit that they should be
free to negotiate with employees.
   ``If our nation's employers are to succeed in an increasingly
complex and competitive global marketplace, they must have the
flexibility to meet both this challenge and the needs of their
employees,'' he said.
   The dispute over family leave could lead to partisan bickering
over an institution every bit as revered as the flag. Bush sought a
constitutional amendment against burning the flag but Congress last
month rejected it as an infringement on freedom of speech.
   In the case of the family leave bill, veto override prospects
are uncertain at best.
   The House passed the family care legislation in May, just before
Mother's Day, by a 237-187 vote. That's 46 votes shy of the
two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto.
   The Senate passed the measure on a voice vote on June 14. But
according to Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a substantive test
vote on the issue came out 55-45 in favor, or a dozen votes shy of
the needed two-thirds majority.
   ``The President is going to have this bill on his desk every
year. He's going to have to veto a family and medical leave bill
one way or another,'' Dodd says, almost angrily. ``I'm going to
serve this legislation up to him. He's going to have to explain and
explain and explain as the situation gets worse out there.''
   Meanwhile, a congressional turf fight, along with a possible
veto threatens a landmark child care measure.
   Among the disagreements are whether Congress, as Dodd proposes,
would review the child care aid program every year or whether, as
the House favors, the aid should become an entitlement that would
automatically roll over every year.
   Bush has said he will veto any child care measure that spends
more than $15 billion over five years. Both House and Senate
versions exceed Bush's limit.
   In some ways the strengths of the two bills are also their
weaknesses, according to some observers and participants. They
concern the needs of two-income families and single mothers forced
by economics into the workforce.
   Only one American family in 10 consists of a working father and
a stay-at-home mother. More than half of all mothers of infants
work outside the home. And by 1995 two-thirds of all preschool
children will have mothers working full time outside the home.
   Conservatives support family leave because it promotes the idea
of a mother being home _ at least temporarily _ with her child. Yet
some, including the president, say the bill intrudes on the right
of businesses to set their own employee policies.
   Family leave has won some support from anti-abortion activists
such as Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. ``He's consistent with his
pro-family posture,'' said Donna Lenhoff of the Women's Legal
Defense Fund, which supported the family leave bill. ``It's
difficult to tell a woman to carry a child to term and then lose
her job.''
   Child care has run into opposition from fiscal conservatives who
don't want to create another government entitlement program for the
poor. Ideological conservatives object to the implication that the
government favors working mothers over those who stay at home.
   That both bills are in Congress simultaneously also has been a
disadvantage, according to some.
   Child care ``is stalled for good reason. It created two new
entitlements at tremendous cost and it helps only a small fraction
of the population,'' said Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., a leading
House backer of family leave. ``The family and medical leave bill
is far more consistent with the family values that Republicans have
talked about over the campaign period.''
   Family leave, Dodd said, ``is a matter of human decency,'' much
in the way the federally mandated 40-hour work week was deemed a
matter of human decency decades ago. Child care, he said, addresses
an obvious human need.
   Added Lenhoff: ``Child care is what you need when everything's
normal _ you're going to work and you need help caring for your
kids. Family and medical leave is what you need when you can't go
back to work.''

   Western nations are pushing forward
with financial help for economically-stricken Eastern European
nations while stopping short of embracing similar relief for the
Soviet Union.
   Foreign ministers of two-dozen Western nations agreed Wednesday
to extend to Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and East Germany
an assistance program initially set up to help Poland and Hungary.
They refused to include Romania because of recent violent
repression of protesters there.
   No specific dollar numbers were committed in the discussions
here. The Western nations previously had pledged more than $12
billion in food, economic and environmental assistance to Poland
and Hungary.
   ``This was not a pledging session,'' said Secretary of State
James A. Baker III.
   The foreign ministers ducked the troublesome question of direct
economic assistance to the Kremlin, however. In their final
statement, they discussed the situation there and merely
``underlined their interest in positive developments'' toward a
democracy and a free-market economy.
   The issue of aid to the Kremlin, which pits the United States
for the most part against West Germany and France, was expected to
surface at the summit of NATO leaders opening today in London.
   It also was likely to dominate next week's economic talks in
Houston among President Bush and the chiefs of six other leading
industrialized nations.
   In recent weeks, West Germany has urged its allies to quickly
fashion a $15 billion to $20 billion aid package to support Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's beleaguered perestroika program of
economic reforms.
   ``We cannot expect the Soviet Union to resolve problems
regarding the transition to a market economy on their own,'' West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher told reporters in
Brussels.
   He said the Kremlin badly needs financial help and advice.
   ``It is in the common Western interest to give this support to
the Soviet Union because a deterioration of the situation (there)
will put Gorbachev off course and in danger,'' Genscher said.
   But Baker said the United States has ``some difficulties'' with
the idea of giving economic aid to Moscow with no strings attached.
   ``We think that the absence of real progress toward a market
economy in the Soviet Union argues against the provision of
assistance at this time,'' Baker said at a news conference.
   He also said the Kremlin was spending as much as a quarter of
its economic output on the military. ``We have to ask ourselves the
question _ why not get some of that money from those sources,''
Baker said.
   Even so, he said, the United States wants to see Gorbachev's
programs work.
   ``A reformed Soviet Union is a more open and more stable and
therefore more secure Soviet Union and that's in the best interests
of ... the West in general,'' Baker said.
   Gorbachev has not formally asked for Western help.
   But the issue of Western aid has become linked to efforts to win
Gorbachev's backing for immediate and full membership of a united
Germany in the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   The Western hope is that with a massive aid program, the Kremlin
leader would drop his objections. West Germany belongs to the NATO
military alliance, but East Germany is part of the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact.
   Leaders of the European Community, the 12-nation trading bloc,
recently agreed in principle to provide assistance to Gorbachev but
rejected Franco-German calls for immediate help.
   The leaders asked aides to consult with the Kremlin about
proposals for short-term loans and longer term assistance.
   The foreign ministers, at their meeting Wednesday on aid for
Eastern Europe, asked to take a look at the community's work when
it was completed. human rights.
   Speaking of the ministers' refusal to include Romania in aid
plans, Baker said the actions of leaders there raise ``serious
questions about (the government's) commitment to democratic reform
and basic human rights.''
   Frans Andriessen, the European Community's top foreign affairs
official, said the nations would like to help Romania when
conditions improve.
   ``This is not an attempt to isolate,'' he said. ``The door is
(still) open.''

   A woman was mistakenly told her newborn
baby had died in a hospital and discovered three days later her son
was still alive, hospital officials said.
   Juanita Ayala of Middletown gave birth by Caesarean section June
28 at Horton Memorial Hospital. Her baby was ill and was taken to
Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla while Ayala recovered
at Horton.
   On Sunday, Ayala was told her baby had died. On Tuesday, the day
the child's obituary appeared in a local newspaper, a Westchester
doctor called to tell her the baby was alive.
   ``When they told her the baby died, she was very shaken up,''
said Wanda Leon, Ayala's 13-year-old niece.
   ``Then, when they told her the baby was still alive, she was
very angry, because they lied to her.''
   Ayala, who has three other children, speaks only Spanish.
   The baby, Luis Miguel Ayala, was in critical condition at the
Westchester hospital.
   Horton spokeswoman Candice Groudin said a Westchester doctor
told the nurse in charge of Horton's obstetrical unit that the baby
had died. Westchester spokesman Barry Bowman said it was unlikely
the information came from Westchester.

<HEAD>Dodger Stadium Exempt From Anti-Medfly Spraying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dodger Stadium will be spared tonight's
planned aerial pesticide spraying against the Medfly _ and that has
activists angry.
   ``It's absolutely unreal,'' said former Monterey Park Mayor
Patricia Reichenberger. ``Here are thousands of people complaining
about spraying and out of the blue they exempt Dodger Stadium.''
   Helicopters dropping malathion-laced syrup on a 14-square-mile
area will avoid the ball park because it lacks the fruit trees that
lure Mediterranean fruit flies, said County Agricultural
Commissioner E. Leon Spaugy.
   ``There's nothing at the stadium but blacktop,'' Spaugy said.
``It's just a big area, with a big parking lot with no host trees.''
   During the 11-month Medfly infestation, agriculture officials
also have exempted the Crystal Cathedral in Orange County, areas of
Riverside County that are home to the endangered kangaroo rat, and
city reservoirs.
   The downtown area will be sprayed at least three times,
agriculture officials said. The spraying was ordered after a Medfly
was found recently in the area. The flies, which can turn fruit to
mush, are disastrous in the state's multibillion-dollar agriculture
industry.
   Opponents contend not enough is known about malathion's
long-term health effects. State officials say the pesticide is safe.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Postal Service footed the cost when
hundreds of postmasters mailed letters to the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce defending a proposed increase in postal rates.
   For a week, the chamber's Washington office has been getting 100
letters a day from postmasters and other postal employees in the
Midwest and Western states, the organization says.
   About half the letters are in envelopes marked ``Official
Business,'' which carry a penalty for private use. A few dozen
contain form letters.
   Chamber officials object. ``It's wrong for people on the
government payroll to be using government time and resources to
lobby,'' said Tracey Schreft of the chamber's Small Business Center.
   But the Postal Service says the letters were official business
and were needed to combat a chamber-published brochure against the
proposed new 30-cent stamp.
   Titled ``Cancel This Stamp,'' the brochure invites the chamber's
member businesses to battle the rate increase and ``join the fight
against waste in the Postal Service.''
   The brochure contains ``inaccuracies and distortions intended to
discredit the great job we're doing,'' said Jim Mruk, a
Chicago-based Postal Service spokesman.
   ``We feel the use of the penalty envelope is warranted,'' Mruk
said. ``This is part of the normal course of doing business. We
have no apologies for it at all.''
   The independent Postal Rate Commission has until early next year
to review the agency's rate increase plan. A first-class stamp
would go from 25 cents to 30 cents, post cards from 15 cents to 20
cents, and the cost of sending a seven-pound package would rise
from $4 to $5.06.
   The Postal Service says it does not know how much the
postmasters' letters cost because it is uncertain how many were
sent.
   Mruk said there was no ``organized effort to lobby the chamber.''
   Rather, he said, the Central Region's postmaster general wrote
the chamber about the brochure and sent copies to medium-level
managers ``who shared them with postmasters.''
   All the letters are from the Postal Service's central region,
which includes Colorado, Wyoming, the Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa,
Kansas, Nebraska, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and
Missouri.
   ``As an employee who works closely with the community and the
Chamber of Commerce, I must complain strongly and bitterly against
the article being disseminated from your office entitled `Cancel
This Stamp','' began a letter from postmaster Cecelia White of Ada,
Kan.
   The letter criticizes the brochure for alleged inaccuracies, and
for soliciting Postal Service ``horror stories'' from businesses.
   The same letter arrived from postmasters in Partridge, Redfield
and other Kansas communities. All were in officials envelopes
instead of bearing stamps.
   In an interview, White she did not think about paying for the
letter herself.
   ``We're willing to put stamps on some things. I didn't think
they told us to put a stamp on this,'' she said.
   A letter from postmaster Robert J. Herman said: ``I am going to
tell the business community of Raymond, Ill., the truth about the
requested postage rate increase by the United States Postal Service
_ the best postal system in the world!''
   Last month, the Postal Service withdrew a $21,000 advertisement
from a chamber magazine following stories critical of the rate hike
plan.

   ``Banned in the U.S.A.,'' the new single from 2 Live Crew,
sounds like a newsletter from the American Civil Liberties Union _
with a beat, of course.
   The rappers quote lyrics from ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' They
quote the Gettysburg Address. They even quote Bruce Springsteen.
But there are no dirty words _ and no apologies _ on ``Banned in
the U.S.A,'' which arrived in record stores Wednesday.
   ``We have the right to say what we want to say,'' chants group
leader Luther Campbell. ``We have the right to do what we want to
do. We have freedom of expression. We have the freedom of choice.
You have the right to listen to whoever you want to.''
   This is 2 Live Crew's first new record since last month's arrest
in Hollywood, Fla., for performing songs from the million-selling
``As Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' which a federal judge ruled obscene.
   Since then, their lyrics have made rock critics out of everyone
from district attorneys to undercover cops to Phil Donahue, and
have received more scrutiny than President Bush's annual budget
message.
   Musically, the record is a weak lift of Springsteen's ``Born in
the U.S.A.'' _ borrowed with his permission. But lyrically, coming
from a group arrested by more than a dozen sheriff's detectives, it
offers a neat, PG-rated lesson about racism, politics and the First
Amendment.
   In fact, a classroom might be the ideal place to hear it.
   On ``Banned in the U.S.A.,'' 2 Live Crew's four-letter words are
``land'' and ``free,'' and soundbites are heard from ``America the
Beautiful'' and the evening news.
   ``Is this not America?'' Campbell asks. ``This is not China.
This is not Russia. This is not the place where they brought down
the wall.''
   So on Independence Day, 2 Live Crew comes not to burn the flag,
but to wave it, flashing the peace sign to right-wingers and
left-wingers alike, and warning politicians to ``wise up 'cause on
Election Day, you'll be banned in the U.S.A.''
   The rappers produced the single on their own Luke Records, a
Florida-based independent, but are being distributed by a major
label, Atlantic Records, for the first time.
   ``Like many Americans, I was shocked to see in the news media
those disturbing scenes of a black musical artist being arrested
and placed in the back seat of a police car for the `crime' of
performing before an adult audience,'' Doug Morris, president and
chief operating officer of Atlantic Records, said in a recent
statement.
   In the same statement, Campbell praises the agreement with
Atlantic as ``a very positive message to send when a controversial
independent label can join forces with a major such as Atlantic.''

<HEAD>400 Treated for Heat Exhaustion, Hyperventilation Before New Kids
Concert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 400 children were treated for heat
exhaustion and hyperventilation after waiting for hours in the sun
to see the group the New Kids on the Block.
   An estimated 35,000 youngsters streamed onto Harriet Island for
a concert Wednesday. Many waited more than eight hours with little
food and drink in hopes of getting a good view of the popular
performers.
   Police estimate that about 4,000 teen-agers entered the gates at
11 a.m., and about 20,000 had arrived by 3 p.m. Opening groups
began playing for the crowd at 7 p.m., and the New Kids took the
stage at 9:30 p.m.
   Although the temperature was only in the upper 70s, the crowded
conditions apparently contributed to the problem.
   ``It was so hot out there, and the only time you could breathe
fresh air was when a breeze blew over. It was so crowded,'' said
Angela Frank, 15, of Cloquet, who was treated at a Red Cross tent.
   Terri Nelson, who worked as coordinator of the Red Cross tent,
said there was a steady flow of visitors. Five people required
hospitalization, authorities said.
   ``We've had no major incidents except heat exhaustion,'' said
Lt. Richard Jardell during the concert. The city brought 10,000
pounds of ice to the concert and distributed it to the crowd, he
said.
   The five New Kids are known for their tightly choreographed
shows and their rabid teen-age following. Among the group's hits is
the current No. 1 single and album, ``Step by Step.''

<HEAD>Serbia Dissolves Regional Parliament in Kosovo</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New Thruout to UPDATE with background; No Pickup.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Authorities in Yugoslavia's largest
republic today dissolved the local legislature and government in
its troubled southern province of Kosovo, the state news agency
Tanjug reported.
   The move by the republic of Serbia is likely to cause more
unrest by the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo, the nation's
least developed region.
   The decision by all three chambers of the Serbian parliament
came in the wake of Monday's declaration by 114 ethnic Albanian
deputies in Kosovo's provincial assembly to secede from Serbia,
Belgrade television said.
   The document proclaimed Kosovo equal in status to Yugoslavia's
republics and declared that ethnic Albanians, the third-largest
ethnic group in the country, would no longer be considered a
minority.
   Yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two
nominally autonomous provinces. Kosovo, a province of 1.9 million,
90 percent of whom are ethnic Albanian, has progressively lost
control of its affairs to Serbia.
   The decision to dissolve Kosovo's 188-member legislature and the
local government of Premier Jusuf Zeinulahu was read to deputies
during Thursday's assembly session, according to journalists in the
provincial capital, Pristina.
   Delegates were informed that all elected officials in the
regional government were suspended.
   Ethnic Albanians seek restoration of the broader autonomy they
enjoyed under a 1974 constitution that was amended in March 1989.
Serbs, who consider Kosovo the cradle of their medieval kingdom,
claimed that ethnic Albanians were pressuring the remaining Slavs
to move out of the province.
   Since the constitution was amended, about 60 ethnic Albanians
have been killed in clashes with security forces.
   Ethnic Albanians, who have been demanding free elections and a
multiparty system, deny they discriminate against Slavs in their
province. They say that claim has been used by Serbia's Communist
leader, Slobodan Milosevic, to gain popular support for his
hard-line policies.
   Serbia's Communist leadership is proposing a new state
constitution that would effectively remove any vestige of
self-government enjoyed by its southern province. The elimination
of Kosovo's parliament under a new constitution would make ethnic
Albanians a small minority in the Serbian parliament.
   ``The decision to dissolve the regional parliament is an illegal
one and the Albanian people will not recognize it,'' said Ibrahim
Rugova, leader of the Democratic Forum, an ethnic Albanian group
that claims 500,000 members.
   ``Serbia currently does not have any constitutional right to do
such a thing,'' he said, adding that the Forum would call on ethnic
Albanians to remain calm ``in the face of this provocation.''
   ``Both the parliament and the government should continue to
function normally, because (ethnic Albanians) have the majority,''
he said.
   Serbian authorities also announced they were imposing
unspecified ``extraordinary measures'' on Pristina's radio and
television, as well as in the local telecommunications company,
Tanjug reported. It said the measures, which appear designed to
give Serbia full control over the media, will also extend to the
Albanian-language Rilindia publishing house, Kosovo's largest.
   Meanwhile, results of a referendum held Sunday and Monday in
Serbia on whether to hold multiparty elections before adopting a
new constitution, showed 96.8 percent of the population voted for
the government proposal to delay a free ballot. The results of the
vote, in which some three-quarters of Serbia's 6.7 million
registered voters took part, were released Thursday.
   Opposition parties, which demanded that elections be held before
enactment of a new constitution, had called on supporters to
boycott the referendum.
   Yugoslavia's northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia
increasingly have sided with Kosovo in its drive for autonomy from
Serbia.
   This spring, the republics held their first free elections in 45
years for local legislatures. Both votes were won by center-right
parties, which trounced the Communist parties that called the
elections.
   Yugoslavia's other three republics are scheduled to hold free
elections later this year.
   And on Monday, Slovenia's Parliament proclaimed the state's full
sovereignty. The declaration provides for an independent legal
system that would take precedence over federal laws, and for
Slovenian control of armed forces stationed in the republic.
   Slovenia, the most prosperous of Yugoslavia's republics,
contains 2 million of the country's 23 million population. The
republic's new authorities demand that Yugoslavia become a loose
confederation of sovereign states.
   But the Communist government of Serbia vehemently opposes
turning Yugoslavia into a confederation. Serbia also rejects
Western-style democracy for Yugoslavia, created in 1918.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 100 homeless people early today
spent what may be their last night sleeping in a plaza outside City
Hall.
   Starting tonight, police are under Mayor Art Agnos' orders to
arrest homeless who sleep in public places.
   ``It ain't going to work,'' said Butch, a two-and-a-half year
resident of Civic Center Plaza, where the homeless were spread out
in sleeping bags, tents or just a few blankets. ``They're just
going to go somewhere else.''
   Butch, who would not give his last name, moved out of the plaza
four months ago. But he said he's thinking about moving right back.
   ``I pay rent now _ I pay $225 a month. For what? A
roach-infested, rat-infested room,'' he said. Many homeless
complain about the poor conditions of the shelters and other
housing alternatives offered to them.
   City officials defend their plan as a new approach to serving
the homeless by offering them a way to rejoin society.
   ``It's a start,'' Agnos said this week. ``The idea is to move
these people out of the parks, out of being homeless and into
transitional and permanent housing.''
   In Santa Cruz, homeless activists from around the state squared
off with angry residents on Independence Day over the issue of
whether freedom extends to allowing people to sleep in public parks.
   About 200 homeless activists, rallying outside the Santa Cruz
County Courthouse, demanded an end to the city's camping ban,
saying people should be allowed to sleep where they can.
   The activists were outnumbered by about 600 counterdemonstrators
who said they were tired of giving Santa Cruz's ``bums'' and
``squatters'' a free ride in the seaside town about 75 miles south
of San Francisco.
   Critics in San Francisco had accused Agnos, a liberal Democrat,
of waffling on the homelessness issue for years.
   He was torn for the last two years between a campaign promise to
clean up the plaza and a vow to not break up the sprawling
encampment until a viable alternative was available.
   This week, the city took over two comprehensive service
shelters. More than 150 people have moved into them.
   But those still in the plaza and advocates of the homeless
remain critical of the mayor's plan.
   ``This is unconscionable cruelty put on the victims of society
for the sake of window dressing,'' said Tom Osher of Food Not
Bombs, an organization that has been feeding the homeless in the
plaza since last July.
   ``The net effect (of the eviction notice) is that it does
absolutely nothing,'' Osher said. ``Everybody is just going to
move.''
   Many of the homeless who stayed at the plaza were not sure what
they would do once the deadline arrives. Asked where they would go,
many shrugged their shoulders and murmured ``somewhere else.''
   On Monday, outreach workers began encouraging the Civic Center's
homeless to report a municipal office that would give them an
alternative to life on the streets. By Tuesday, 82 people had
reported to the office, and 64 men were sent to a new shelter nine
blocks from the Civic Center.
   But homeless advocates charge that the ``cleanup'' program will
force 215 people already staying in a shelter out on the streets to
make way for the displaced Civic Center homeless. The new policy
also will break up couples and force many people into jails,
doorways or alleys, they said.
   ``What's going to happen Friday night is San Francisco will
start criminalizing homelessness,'' said Josh Brandon of the
Coalition on Homelessness.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev acknowledged to local
Communist leaders that the Kremlin had cast them adrift as it
rapidly switched signals in a bid to quiet republics' demands for
autonomy, a local official said today.
   Gorbachev met with more than 300 officials late Wednesday, after
the Soviet president had given himself and his leadership a
two-year deadline to improve citizens' lives in the Soviet Union.
   Filip Stroganov, a party leader from the Baltic republic of
Latvia, said Gorbachev had converted him from an opponent to a
supporter during the meeting, which lasted late into Wednesday
night.
   ``I like people with character,'' Stroganov said. ``Yesterday I
saw his character.''
   The Latvian delegation met with reporters today as delegates to
the 28th Communist Party Congress broke up into sections to debate
economic, military, farm, regional and other issues.
   Reporters were allowed to attend the first three days of the
congress, but were not permitted in today's section meetings.
   The official Tass news agency, in a brief statement, reported
there were ``sharp polemics on social, economic and agricultural
party policy'' in the sectional debates but did not provide any
details.
   Stroganov said regional leaders complained that Gorbachev and
the central leadership changed their minds too often on a new
structure to bind the Soviet Union's republics.
   Latvia's neighbor, Lithuania, already has declared independence.
The parliament of Latvia and the third Baltic republic, Estonia,
have signaled their intention to follow.
   ``We don't have a clear position on this question,'' Stroganov
said. ``In the course of a year, opinions in the center were
changed three times. First we were talking about a renewed
federation, then we were talking about a confederation, and today,
just a little while before the congress, we started talking about a
union of states.''
   ``The lack of a precise position on this issue put us in an
awkward situation,'' Stroganov said.
   Gorbachev ``agreed with this yesterday,'' he added. The regional
leaders had been pressing for a meeting for more than two years,
and Gorbachev also acknowledged it was a mistake to put it off for
so long, he said.
   The Soviet leader's Council of the Federation recently has begun
meeting to try to work out a new treaty among the republics. But
the Baltic republics still want to be out altogether, and other
republics as well are clamoring for more autonomy.
   The latest formulation of a union of states, not yet
well-defined, is intended to take those strivings into account.
   Stroganov also said regional party leaders demanded more freedom
from Moscow. ``We don't need centralism, we need democracy,'' he
said.
   Earlier Wednesday, Gorbachev told journalists that the
leadership should quit if its reform program does not show results
in two years.
   It was the first time that Gorbachev had given a deadline for
his reform program, which was launched when he took power in 1985.
   ``I think that in two years, if there are no changes, this
leadership must go,'' Gorbachev said.
   He did not specify who would be covered by his self-imposed
deadline, but it seemed likely it was meant for both party and
government leaders.
   Most important Soviet officials still hold key posts in both the
Communist Party and the Soviet government.
   Speaking confidently in a videotaped segment shown on the
nightly TV news program ``Vremya,'' he denied that the Kremlin
leadership would do anything just to hold onto political power.
   ``I will tell you, before perestroika we had more power. I don't
know who had more power than the general secretary of the Central
Committee. If it had only been for my sake, there would have been
no need for any reforms, renewal in either the party or in
society.''
   The leadership has made mistakes and errors, but it was
courageous in starting his reform program, he said.
   In Wednesday's session, Gorbachev heard bitter criticism of his
program from party officials who accused the leadership of
cowardice and indecision in an ideological battle against growing
anti-communist sentiments.
   ``Our position today reminds of an army that is retreating in
haste without a plan,'' said Nursultan Nazarbaev, party chief in
the Kazakhstan republic as he pleaded for clearer direction from
the Kremlin.
   Despite a second day of sharp criticism, however, speakers
displayed no new ideas and no alternative to re-electing Gorbachev
to another five-year term as party chief.

   Two Continental Airlines jets aborted takeoffs
within an hour of each other because of engine trouble, an airline
spokesman said.
   A Continental Airbus A300 en route to Houston aborted a takeoff
from Stapleton International Airport after an engine caught fire,
spokesman Flo Ternes said. All 207 passengers and 10 crew members
escaped injury.
   An hour later Wednesday at the same Denver airport, a
Continental flight to Los Angeles with 146 people on board aborted
a takeoff because an engine overheated, the airline said.
   The fire in the left engine of the twin-engine Airbus forced the
pilot to slam the brakes on Flight 1232 less than 100 yards before
the end of the runway, the Houston bound passengers said.
   The passengers, who were evacuated after the aircraft blew all
eight tires, praised the pilot, whose name was not released by
Continental.
   ``The plane stayed true,'' said Calvin Garwood, a Houston
lawyer. ``Another two or three seconds and we could have been in
real trouble because we would have been airborne. The nose was just
coming off the ground.''
   The fire was smothered by the engine's internal extinguisher.
   The Federal Aviation Adminstration is investigating.

<TEXT>
   The country's new Parliament today
re-elected former dissident playwright Vaclav Havel as president,
completing the political transition from Communist to democratic
rule.
   He is to serve a two-year term.
   The immensely popular Havel, running unopposed, was elected with
the necessary three-fifths majority in a nationally televised
secret ballot. A total of 234 deputies voted for him, and 50
against.
   There were no abstentions. Sixteen deputies were absent.
   ``I think the fact that there were 50 deputies voting against me
is a very good, significant and convincing evidence of the
democratic character of my election ... I am quite rejoicing over
that. I would not feel good if I had been elected by 100 percent as
was my precedessor,'' Havel said.
   Havel was to deliver his inauguration speech later in the day.
   Havel, who on Dec. 29 became the country's first non-Communist
president in 42 years, was nominated by Civic Forum and its Slovak
counterpart, Public Against Violence. The two groups led the
peaceful revolution that toppled the hard-line Communist regime in
November.
   The parliamentary session, held in a medieval hall at the
Hradcany castle, was opened by Parliament President Alexander
Dubcek, whose ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968 were crushed by
Soviet tanks.
   ``By the election of the president, the revolutionary
transition, which we have been living through since November, will
be ended,'' Dubcek said.
   He praised Havel as a man who ``has proved competent as a
politician and statesman .... Vaclav Havel, playwright in the seat
of president, has gained, by his work, the confidence of our
people.''
   ``He proved himself even in the times of repression of freedom
and rights, when it was not easy or convenient to show a firm stand
of a citizen and bravery,'' Dubcek said.
   The former Czechoslovak leader said Havel deserves ``great
credit for the fact that our development, even in the most extreme
situations, has not slid toward revenge, political intrigues,
confrontation and intolerance.''
   After the ballot, Havel was led by Dubcek and other officials up
the red-carpeted aisle of the Vladislav Hall to sign the oath of
office.
   As a military band played the national anthem inside the hall,
the sound of a 20-gun salute reverberated throughout the city.
   After the parliamentary session, Havel, accompanied by Defense
Minister Miroslav Vacek, attended a military parade at the castle's
third courtyard.
   He was the only candidate for the office. Stefan Kvietik, who
was nominated by the separatist Slovak National Party, refused the
candidacy.

   The CIA trained Guatemalan guerrillas at a
Mexican ranch owned by a drug lord convicted in the murder of U.S.
drug agent Enrique Camarena, a federal report says.
   But the Drug Enforcement Administration report does not detail
why the guerrillas were being trained, nor whether the Central
Intelligence Agency knew who owned the ranch.
   The CIA denied the report, details of which the Los Angeles
Times published today.
   ``The whole story is nonsense,'' agency spokesman Mark Mansfield
said today. ``We have not trained Guatemalan guerrillas on that
ranch or anywhere else.''
   ``The CIA does not engage in drug-running activities,'' he said
Wednesday.
   The report, completed in February, said the Guatemalan
guerrillas were trained during the early 1980s at a ranch near
Veracruz owned by Rafael Caro Quintero, and that a guerrilla clash
there left 19 Mexican police dead.
   Caro and two other men are serving prison terms in Mexico for
their roles in the 1985 torture-murder of Camarena and his pilot in
Guadalajara. Four other men are on trial in Los Angeles over their
alleged involvement in the slaying.
   The DEA report became available in Los Angeles on Tuesday night
after U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie ordered prosecutors to
turn the information over to the defense, the Times said.
   It was based on an interview two DEA agents conducted in
September with government informant Laurence Victor Harrison.
Harrison, according to court documents, ran a communications
network for drug lords and their Mexican law enforcement allies in
the early and mid-1980s, the Times said.
   Harrison told the DEA agents that CIA operations personnel once
stayed at the home of drug trafficker Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo _
also convicted in the Camarena case.
   On Feb. 9, Harrison said the CIA used as a cover the Mexican
Federal Security Directorate. At the same time, members of that
directorate were working with ``major drug overlords'' to ship
narcotics to the United States, Harrison said.
   Sometime between 1981 and 1984, members of the Mexican Federal
Judicial Police who went to the ranch on a separate drug
investigation were confronted by the guerrillas, Harrison said.
   ``As a result of the confrontation, 19 MFJP agents were killed.
Many of the bodies showed signs of torture; the bodies had been
drawn and quartered,'' he told the DEA agents.

   A cargo inspector at John F. Kennedy
International Airport spotted a cache of bombs and guns before they
were loaded onto a plane, but the weapons turned out to be fake,
officials said.
   The decoys, supplied by the Federal Aviation Administration, are
used by Pan American World Airways to train baggage inspectors to
detect the real thing.
   The inspector was checking the cargo for Flight 403 to Florida
on Wednesday when he spotted suspicious items in two boxes. Port
Authority police evacuated the baggage room and notified the FBI
and the police department bomb squad.
   Police cleared the baggage room at 6:45 a.m. and it was kept
closed until 9:25 a.m., when Pan Am officials told police what had
happened.
   ``As far as we knew, we had real explosive devices,'' said Port
Authority Police Lt. Louis Echavarria.
   The airline delayed six flights for up to 20 minutes because of
the scare, said Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon.
   It was a mistake not to notify the baggage inspector that the
items were being shipped, she said, but ``it does show that the
screening device and the screening procedure is working.''
   The two dummy pipe bombs, fake hand grenades and fake guns were
being shipped to Haiti and the Cayman Islands via Miami for
security tests.

<TEXT>
   The agriculture minister resigned today in
anticipation of a major Cabinet shake-up by Prime Minister Tadeusz
Mazowiecki, who is under pressure to dismiss holdover Communists
from key posts.
   Government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska told reporters
that Mazowiecki intends Friday to bring to a close a ``certain
stage'' of activity by the East bloc's first non-Communist
government.
   But she declined at a news conference to reveal how many other
ministers would be ousted, or what new programs Mazowiecki would
propose.
   The pro-government Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper said today that up
to 10 of the 24 Cabinet members could be dismissed in the
realignment.
   It said Mazowiecki would use the occasion to counter the
campaign Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa has mounted against him,
splintering the popular movement that rallied to oust the
Communists.
   Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Janicki of the Peasant Party handed
in his resignation during an appearance before parliament this
morning. He said he had failed to obtain special consideration for
farmers to protect them from stringent economic reforms that have
outraged them.
   ``A certain stage of our activity is coming to an end now. The
prime minister will speak about it tomorrow,'' said Mrs.
Niezabitowska.
   She added that the Polish people should be proud of the ``path
of peace'' taken by the government in its attempt to transform
Poland into a democracy, and urged Poles to adopt similar peaceful
means in political conflicts to come.
   The current Cabinet was installed Sept. 12 after 45 years of
Communist rule.
   The government has been under increasing pressure in the past
two months, grappling with a major rail strike, two farm protests
that required police intervention and steady criticism from Walesa
and other elements of Solidarity.
   Walesa has been urging Mazowiecki to replace holdover
Communists, hold early parliamentary and presidential elections and
speed privatization of state enterprises.
   The interior minister, Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, a former Communist
still in charge of the police, is considered a prime candidate for
ouster. Diplomatic sources said his removal is ``definite.''
   Kiszczak's department has been criticized for destroying
evidence of its past activities, and new accusations surfaced this
week that it continued to spy on Solidarity even after Mazowiecki
was named prime minister.
   Widely lauded in the West for its determined effort to tackle
Poland's economic problems, the government's popularity has
dwindled at home.
   According to a survey by the state polling service released
Tuesday, just 64 in 100 Poles expressed support for the government.
That compares to approval ratings of 80 percent to 90 percent in
the fall, before the government implemented its shock economic
reform program.
   The program ended subsidies and has all but halted inflation.
But Poles' buying power has suffered and the reaction has been
sharp protests from hard-hit sectors.
   Among those protesting most loudly are Poland's 2.5 million
private farmers.
   Walesa is widely believed to be gearing up to run for president
to replace former Communist leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who
Parliament elected to the post as part of a political deal that
would make it easier for the Communists to surrender control.
   As part of the deal, Mazowiecki also agreed to leave the
powerful police and army ministries in the hands of the Communists,
and to give them two other ministerial slots _ transportation and
foreign trade.
   However, with the subsequent collapse of Communist rule
throughout Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union's acquiescence to
the changes, many Poles have argued that the Communist no longer
pose a significant threat to the stability of the Solidarity
government.

   Here is an icy thought that, oddly, might make a
hot summer seem even hotter: The savings and loan bailout, which
could cost taxpayers $300 billion, may be just the tip of the
iceberg.
   If the tip is equal to a sum of that size, the single most
expensive governmental cost in peacetime, then how massive must the
bulk of the berg be?
   Conceivably, in the trillions of dollars, says economist Ronald
Utt, who points out that financial obligations of agencies
underwritten by the federal government now total $5.8 trillion.
   ``And much of that obligation is in bad shape,'' says Utt, vice
president of the U.S. Chamber Foundation, a former employee of the
White House Office of Management and Budget and a former Heritage
Foundation fellow.
   Potentially, he says, these financial obligations represent a
staggering breakdown of government. And, a growing number of
critics are saying, the lack of public information on the matter
represents a communications breakdown.
   Most people, it seems safe to say, cannot imagine that other
financial breakdowns are threatened, reasoning that if that were so
they would have heard of them. But that logic breaks as throroughly
as the communications.
   The obligations Utt refers to are spread among deposit insurance
programs, loan and pension guarantees, direct loan programs such as
those administered by the Small Business Administration, and debts
of five government enterprises.
   Utt's chilling observations are contained in a paper written for
Heritage, a conservative think tank whose opinions sometimes have
been influential in the Bush and Reagan administrations.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., says Utt, is by no
means the only federal credit program confronted with huge losses.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Housing
Administration lost money in 1988 and 1989 and seemed destined to
lose again in 1990. The FHA, he says, has seen the level of claims
against its shrinking reserves rise nearly three times in three
years.
   Further, he states, ``Half of the farm loans made by the Farmers
Home Administration are in default, and half of these defaulted
loans have been in that condition for more than three years.''
   On and on it goes.
   The federal government, he notes, stands behind nearly $500
billion in guaranteed Veteran's Administration and FHA mortgages,
$48 billion in guaranteed student loans ...
   ``... and a host of other guarantees ranging from rural
electrification to shipbuilding loans, and from small business
disaster loans to loans for building plants to convert grain to
ethanol.''
   All together, he estimates, the contingent liability associated
with loan and deposit guarantees totaled $3.5 trillion at the end
of fiscal 1988. And other insurance programs _ flood insurance, for
instance _ add $500 billion more.
   How could such massive obligations not rise to the surface and
break more forcefully into the media? How can such dangers lurk so
near and not cause more concern?
   Utt doesn't have an answer to those questions, but he does
suggest that both Congress and taxpayers played a role.
   Most lawmakers, he says, ``tried to convince Americans that the
crisis was just an isolated incident, and that the vast bulk of the
government credit programs are well-managed and pose little risk to
the taxpayer.''
   And for their part, many taxpayers have wished this to be so.
   It isn't, says Utt, who advocates passage of an Omnibus Credit
Solvency Act ``to fundamentally restructure these many programs in
order to reduce taxpayer exposure to costly program failures.''
   Before it is too late, he adds.

   The changes in Europe's political landscape the past year make
this NATO summit one of the most significant in the alliance's
41-year history. Here, at a glance, is a look at where the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization has been and where it may go:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ORIGIN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The NATO treaty was signed April 4, 1949, in Washington. In it,
the United States, Canada and 10 European nations _ Belgium,
Britain, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Norway and Portugal _ aligned themselves against any
military threat from the Soviet Union. Greece, Turkey, West Germany
and Spain later joined the alliance.
   The treaty says, ``The parties agree that an armed attack
against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be
considered an attack against them all.''
   France, Spain and Iceland are not part of NATO's integrated
military structure.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>OBJECTIVE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   NATO seeks to maintain enough military forces to deter an attack
from the seven nations of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact while at the
same time striving for disarmament and detente.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PEOPLE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The alliance is the military protector of 620 million people:
352.8 million in Western Europe, 242.2 million in the United States
and 25.6 million Canadians.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>EASTERN COUNTERPART</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Warsaw Pact is a military alliance created May 14, 1955. Its
members are the Soviet Union, East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>SUMMIT EXPECTATIONS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Berlin Wall has fallen. The German economy has merged. Free
elections have replaced most of the totalitarian leaders of Eastern
and Central Europe. And Red Army troops and tanks are preparing to
go home. How can NATO, after four decades as a military alliance
poised against the Warsaw Pact, transform itself into a mostly
political organization following the collapse of communism in
Eastern Europe?
   NATO leaders are expected to order a review to develop a
negotiating position for reducing short-range nuclear weapons in
talks with Moscow. The Kremlin suggests that those negotiations
begin this fall, but NATO insists that they take place only after
an agreement to reduce tanks, artillery and other conventional
forces in Europe.
   The ministers are expected to nudge negotiators from the East
and West to wrap up the slow-moving conventional arms talks and
pledge to make even deeper cuts in a later round of discussions.
   They also will likely discuss the strategy of forward defense,
brought into question by the prospect of a united Germany.
   Forward defense refers to the stationing of troops to defend the
front line during an attack. The idea is to defend territory at its
border and not give up any land to invading soldiers. The border
between East and West Germany has historically been considered part
of the front line, but it is soon to be erased.

   A Japanese professor who has built a car
powered by highly volatile liquid hydrogen demonstrated the vehicle
today and said it causes almost no air pollution.
   Industry officials said, however, it may take 10 years to
produce a commercial version of the car, developed by Shoichi
Furuhama, president of the Musashi Institute of Technology.
   The car's liquid hydrogen fuel is made from water and costs
$22.80 a gallon in Japan, officials said.
   In a test drive today, the car, known as the Musashi 8, reached
a speed of 82 mph. Test drivers at Nissan's Oppama factory, near
Tokyo, said they believed the Musashi 8 could reach a speed of 94
mph.
   The car does not backfire before combustion, a defect that has
slowed previous research on hydrogen-fueled cars, Furuhama said. I
has computer-run pumps and valves that keep the liquid hydrogen at
minus 453 degrees.
   Furuhama said the car creates almost no air pollution.
   The engine is in a Nissan Fairlady Z body. Nissan has provided
financial support and technical assistance to Furuhama's research
team.
   But the new vehicle still has many problems, its developers said.
   Liquid hydrogen is exremely volatile and engineers are concerned
about the dangers of explosion in a crash. Furuhama said the
difficulty of obtaining liquid hydrogen has prevented scientists
from thoroughly studying its safety.
   A researcher working with Furuhama said on condition of
anonymity the car also must carry a large volume of fuel. Hydrogen
cars sometimes have been jokingly referred to as ``cars which carry
fuel and not passengers,'' he said.
   Yasuhiko Nakagawa, a researcher at Nissan's Central Engineering
Laboratories, said the fuel mileage is also not as high as for
conventional vehicles.

   An Ohio congressman met with a
former Nazi rocket scientist and sharply criticized the U.S.
government for trying to keep him out of the country.
   Rep. James Traficant said Arthur L.H. Rudolph, a former Nazi
Party member, passed a lie detector test Wednesday in which he
denied having worked slave laborers to death during World War II.
   Traficant said Rudolph was the victim of an unfair investigation
by the U.S. Justice Department's Office of Special Investigations,
which is responsible for hunting down former Nazis living in the
United States.
   ``They have fared very poorly,'' Traficant, a Democrat, said of
the Nazi hunters. ``They've looked for high profile cases to
justify their existence.''
   Rudolph, a close friend and co-worker of German rocket chief
Wernher von Braun since 1934, was brought to the United States by
the Army after World War II to develop the U.S. rocket program.
   Eventually, Rudolph supervised the design and production of the
Saturn 5 rocket, which took U.S. astronauts to the moon.
   But in 1984, faced with what the OSI said was evidence of his
involvement in war crimes, Rudolph voluntarily renounced the U.S.
citizenship he had been granted, admitted his complicity in war
crimes and left the country. He was allowed to keep his pension
from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   He has been living in Hamburg, West Germany, but came to Canada
on Sunday for what he said was a vacation with his wife and
daughter, and also to meet with Traficant about returning to the
United States.
   Rudolph claims to have acted as an advocate for the slave
laborers who built V-2 missiles for the Nazis during the war, and
has said he helped them get extra rations whenever possible.
   The U.S. government estimates that as many as 20,000 workers
died while building V-2 rockets at an underground plant in central
Germany.
   With the 84-year-old Rudolph sitting beside him, Traficant said
the scientist was coerced into renouncing his citizenship and now
wants to return because he does not want to be remembered as a war
criminal.
   ``Dr. Rudolph has decided that history and how they'll record
his name may be more important than the hassles which he'll
undertake,'' Traficant said.
   Rudolph, blinking constantly under the strain of camera flashes
and television lights, refused to discuss the case.
   On Tuesday, Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said the
department still considers the agreement Rudolph signed in 1984
valid.
   Traficant said if Rudolph is guilty of war crimes, he shouldn't
be getting his NASA pension and benefits.
   ``He's getting almost $50,000 a year from the U.S. Treasury. If
he's a Nazi war criminal, I don't want him to get a dime,''
Traficant said. ``If he is innocent, I want him to be returned to
(the United States). America is his home. He helped put America on
the moon.''
   Rudolph, who was detained for 8{ hours upon his arrival in
Canada Sunday, faces an immigration hearing in Toronto Friday to
determine whether he can remain in that country.
   Canadian Jewish groups have called for Rudolph's immediate
deportation.
   ``I think it's shameful that Canada has allowed Rudolph to come
in and permit Canada to be a launching platform for a vile
political attack against the U.S. Justice Department and its legal
system,'' said Sol Littman, Canadian representative of the Simon
Wiesenthal Center, which tracks former Nazis.
   U.S. Rep. Bill Paxon, a Republican from Buffalo, N.Y., also
criticized Traficant's efforts to return Rudolph to the U.S.
   ``Nazi war criminals should be hunted down, tried, convicted and
jailed, not honored and extolled, as Congressman Traficant is doing
for Rudolph,'' Paxon said in a statement.
   Traficant also has defended John Demjanjuk, a retired Cleveland
auto worker who was convicted of Nazi atrocities and is on death
row in Israel.

<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela is following up on a Rockefeller
Foundation idea for a bank that would channel international
investment to South Africa once the apartheid system is abolished.
   Foundation head Peter C. Goldmark said Wednesday that Mandela
wants to ``have it ready to go when a representative government in
South Africa is chosen.''
   Mandela, Goldmark and several officials of the African National
Congress met in London on Tuesday to continue discussions and form
a working group.
   Goldmark made the proposal at a June 22 meeting between the
anti-apartheid leader and business leaders in New York.
   He likened it then to the Marshall Plan, which helped
war-ravaged Europe 40 years ago, and efforts now being made to help
Eastern European countries recover from communism.
   Other executives at the meeting said the idea appeared to
generate strong interest and Mandela called the proposal
``constructive and imaginative.''
   Goldmark said in a telephone interview from his Brooklyn home on
Wednesday that the hour-long, follow-up meeting was held at
Mandela's request.
   ``He didn't let any grass grow under his feet on this one,''
Goldmark said.
   Goldmark said he would work with two ANC officials _ Foreign
Secretary Thabo Mbeki and Treasurer Thomas Nkobi _ ``to design a
structure through which that business interest can be channeled.''
   Other governments also will be approached as potential
contributors, he said.
   ``They are going to lead the effort,'' he said, referring to the
ANC. The Rockefeller Foundation would assist with the actual
mechanics of setting up an organization.
   Goldmark said Mandela had not ruled out creating an agency
``under the roof of an existing institution,'' such as the World
Bank.
   But he said he felt a separate bank would be an ``identifiable,
focused mechanism for tapping the energy and interest that's out
there.''

   An errant rocket from the town's
Independence Day fireworks display plowed into a crowd of
spectators and injured 19 people, at least two of them seriously,
authorities said.
   The shell veered off course during the grand finale of Wednesday
night's fireworks display at Fuessenich Park, Fire Lt. Nick Florio
said. The display, which drew a crowd of more than 10,000, also
marked the town's 250th anniversary.
   Witnesses said the rocket exploded, showering the tightly packed
crowd in the west end of the park with flaming debris.
   ``One lady was blown out of her seat,'' Scott Pro of Brookfield
told radio station WSNG. ``It's one of the worst things I've ever
witnessed.''
   Jody Lothier, another witness, said a young child was struck in
the face with the burning material and another youngster flew 15
feet in the air after being hit.
   ``It just lifted him off the ground,'' she said.
   Police Chief Mahlon Sabo said the rocket skidded across the
ground from the launch site, injuring spectators 400 feet away.
   Fire Marshal Ron Corey said today that his office is working
with the state fire marshal's office and Torrington police to
determine the cause of the explosion.
   He said officials are investigating several possible causes,
including whether there was too much gunpowder packed into the
shell.
   Corey identified the operator of the fireworks display as Ken
Lupoli of Hamden, a subcontractor who uses fireworks supplied by
Vitale Fireworks Display Co. Inc. of New Castle, Pa.
   He said Lupoli has put on several fireworks displays. ``He's
always done an excellent job. He even goes beyond the (fire)
code,'' Corey said.
   A woman who answered the telephone at Lupoli's home today said
he wasn't at home and wasn't available for comment.
   Frank Rondinelli, a spokesman for Vitale Fireworks, said the
company is working with police and fire officials to determine the
cause of the explosion. He said the company does not believe there
were any safety problems with the fireworks.
   Among those injured was 3-year-old Robert Shopey, who suffered
multiple burns. The child was flown by helicopter to a Hartford
hospital where he was in serious condition in the intensive care
unit today.
   Rebecca Shopey, 23, was in stable condition in Torrington's
Charlotte Hungerford Hospital where she was being treated for burns
to her eyes and face, a hospital spokesman said. One-year-old
Ashley Shopey was treated there and released, the hospital said.
   Sixteen other people were treated at Charlotte Hungerford and
two were admitted. Both were listed in stable condition today.

   Soccer hooligans threatened German citizens and
overturned foreign-registered cars after West Germany defeated
England in the World Cup semifinals, and more than 500 people were
arrested, police said.
   Police said 35 officers were injured in disturbances, which
broke out Wednesday night, when in Turin, Italy, West Germany
defeated England 4-3 in penalty kicks after tying 1-1 in regulation
time. Police said heavy drinking by fans who watched the match in
pubs contributed to the rowdiness.
   One man was killed while intervening in a disturbance in Totton,
in southern England, but police were uncertain whether the incident
was related to soccer frustrations.
   French police arrested five British soccer fans at a railroad
station in Dijon Tuesday night after a brawl on a Turin-bound
train. Police said the five were ringleaders of an attempt to oust
other passengers and their baggage so 150 British fans could travel
together. Seven police officers were injured.
   In the seaside town of Brighton, 50 miles south of the capital,
police locked 300 German students in a nightclub to protect them
from hundreds of angry English fans. The students later were
escorted safely from the scene aboard five buses.
   Also in Brighton, police said 200 English youths chased young
Germans through the streets. The town has a large population of
Germans and other foreign students attending English language
courses.
   Five hundred English fans roamed Brighton's streets, overturning
cars with foreign license plates, smashing shop windows and
looting. Police reported 15 arrests in the town.
   Police around the country anticipated the violence, for which
British soccer fans are notorious.
   Extra officers were sent to trouble spots after violence in
several English towns and cities Sunday night when England beat
Cameroon in the quarterfinals.
   In Turin on Wednesday night, a 23-year-old German was stabbed in
the back and seriously wounded when a fight broke out between rival
English and German fans. Police used truncheons to disperse rowdy
crowds near the city's main train station.
   London police dealt with 18 incidents, Scotland Yard said.
Drunken fans hurled beer cans and other missiles at police.
   Hooligans in Grantham, 110 miles north of London, smashed
windows at the Premier Restaurant, in the building where Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher grew up.
   In nearby Worthing, police arrested 18 people after a crowd of
up to 200 people smashed shop windows and looted the contents.
   In a pub in Blackburn 185 miles northwest of London, 20 youths
armed with pool cues attacked two police officers, who were later
treated in a hospital.
   In the port city of Southampton, 70 miles southwest of London, a
group of up to 20 youths smashed up the Royal Oak pub. ``When
England lost they went berserk, picking up anything they could find
and smashing it,'' said pub manager Bernard Smedley.
   Lawmakers from both the opposition Labor Party and the governing
Conservative Party denounced the violence.
   An estimated 30 million Britons watched the match on TV, leaving
streets in London and elsewhere deserted.
   The Rolling Stones concert was temporarily drowned out at
London's Wembley Stadium as thousands of fans there roared
``England, England'' when England drew level with West Germany at
one stage in the match in Turin.
   Many in the concert audience had brought radios and portable TV
sets so they could follow the match. The rock group struck up with
``You Can't Always Get What You Want'' when an England goal was
disallowed.
   Mrs. Thatcher said in a statement Wednesday night: ``We are very
proud of the England team, for despite losing by a penalty
shoot-out, they played magnificently in the match. It was a great
achievement to reach the semi-finals...

   Officials said today they recovered the
26th victim of flash floods that ripped through two communities
here last month.
   The victim, found about 9 a.m., was not immediately identified,
said Belmont County Coroner's Investigator Chuck Vogt. The body was
about two miles south of the mouth of the Wegee Creek, washed up on
the Ohio shore of the Ohio River, which divides the state from West
Virginia.
   The 25th victim, identified today as Dorothy Moore of the Wegee
Creek area, was spotted Wednesday in the Ohio River by a pleasure
craft, Vogt said. The body was found five miles south of Shadyside
in an area about 200 yards south of Wegee Creek where a crane had
removed debris, he said.
   About 5{ inches of rain fell near this eastern Ohio village in
three hours on June 14, sending walls of water down Wegee and Pipe
creeks. Eight people remain missing, Vogt said.

   The pilots of two container ships that
collided last weekend disagree over the exact spot of the accident
and claim the other was on the wrong side of the channel.
   The pilot of the outbound Columbus America told a Coast
Guard-National Transportation Safety Board investigating panel
Wednesday that his ship was well within the outbound section of the
1,800-foot-wide channel into Hampton Roads.
   ``At the worst, I would have been 600 feet north of the buoy.
That would have still given him 1,000 feet,'' said Capt. Richard L.
Counselman Jr.
   On Tuesday, Capt. John A. Jones, pilot on board the inbound
Neptune Jade, said the Columbus America was too far north in the
east-west channel.
   ``How that happened, I do not know. He was well out of
position,'' Jones said.
   The ships collided Sunday evening in a heavy rain squall that
limited visibility. The Columbus America's fuel tank was ruptured,
spilling 30,000 gallons of fuel oil. Most of the oil ended up in
the Elizabeth River section of the harbor as the ship returned to
port spewing oil.
   Each pilot was asked to draw their courses on separate maps.
Jones' plot showed him almost on top of a buoy marking the northern
boundary of the channel when the accident occurred.
   Counselman's plot showed him on top of the buoy marking the
south boundary of the channel.
   Neither ship kept a series of fixed positions on their charts as
is the case with military ships, which are required to keep exact
records of their positions at all times, said Coast Guard officials.
   The panel was to try to sort out the discrepancies today during
questioning of Counselman.
   Jones has been a pilot with the Virginia Pilots Association for
17 years. Counselman has piloted for the association since 1950,
and was its president from 1969 until May. During his 21 years as
president, Counselman said he only piloted about 10 ships a year.
   Coast Guard officials said the cleanup of spilled oil in the bay
was completed Tuesday.
   The owner of the 635-foot Columbus America, Columbus America
Inc. of Hamburg, West Germany, agreed to pay for cleanup costs,
said Eugene K. Johnson, commander of the Coast Guard's Marine
Safety Office in Norfolk. He had no estimate on the cost.
   The 800-foot Neptune Jade, registered in Singapore, received
only minor damage, the Coast Guard said.

   Five Paris art museums closed their doors today to
individual visitors after paintings were stolen from three museums,
including a Renoir cut out of its frame at the Louvre, over a span
of several hours.
   Jacques Sallois, director of national museums, said security
would be tightened at the city's major museums, which remained
open. He refused to say what measures would be taken.
   The museums closed to individuals are relatively small and focus
on the works or the collections of a particular individual _ the
Eugene Delacroix, Gustave Moreau, Jean-Jacques Henner, Hebert and
Ennery museums.
   Sallois' unprecedented announcement came shortly after police
revealed that a third museum had suffered a theft during the short
time span Wednesday.
   Police said it was possible all three thefts were committed by
the same person or group, moving across the city center from one
museum to another.
   According to investigators, the theft revealed today apparently
was the first to occur in the series.
   An 1816 work by French landscape painter Paul Huet was lifted
off its hook Wednesday morning at the Carnavalet Museum, a
historical museum in one of the oldest sections of Paris.
   The painting, ``Les Moulins de la Glaciere,'' was estimated to
be worth about $14,500.
   The other two stolen paintings were cut from their frames _
Renoir's ``Portrait of a Seated Woman'' from the Louvre and Ernest
Hebert's ``Portrait of Monaluccia'' from the museum named after the
artist.
   Both were small format paintings, a type often chosen by thieves
because they can be easily concealed.
   ``Portrait of a Seated Woman'' (1890-1895), measures 13.5 by
10.5 inches. Hebert's work, painted about 1870, measures 14 by 12
inches.
   The theft of the Renoir was discovered about 2:15 p.m.,
officials said. The Hebert was discovered missing from the Hebert
Museum, across the Seine River on the Left Bank, about an hour
later.
   All three victimized museums are run by the government.
   Officials gave no estimates of the value of the Renoir and
Hebert. Independent experts suggested a possible value of $300,000
to $600,000 for the Renoir, but said it was impossible to give a
precise valuation and noted that Renoir had done scores of
portraits of women in his later years.
   The Louvre's director, Michel Laclotte, said the theft of
``Portrait of a Seated Woman'' appeared to be the work of an
``especially clever'' professional.
   ``The canvas was very thin, the cutting instrument was probably
extremely sharp and caused so few vibrations that the electronic
sensor did not pick them up,'' he said.
   Laclotte led reporters to the spot where the portrait had been
hanging _ an isolated stairwell leading to the Denon Gallery, on
the top floor of the Pavillon de Flore overlooking the Seine.
   Head painting curator Pierre Rosenberg said the Renior had been
on display in the stairwell for several years, due to renovations
in other sections of the museum, once a royal palace. It was
donated to the Louvre in 1961 by French collector Victor Lion.
   Rosenberg said Renoir was a ``magic name'' among art lovers,
which could explain the theft _ the first at the Louvre in more
than 10 years.
   Sallois said there was no evidence of negligence on the part of
museum guards, and expressed confidence in the staff.

   Troops shot and killed 27 Tamil rebels
in a new wave of violence in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, and
the government said today it was planning to hold new elections in
Tamil-dominated areas.
   At least 14 soldiers were also killed in rebel attacks.
   The proposed election, a major demand of the rebels, did not
appear to be a peace overture but instead an effort to diminish the
support of Tamil civilians for the guerrillas.
   Announcing the new elections, Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan
Wijeratne charged that the rebels were blocking food distribution
and causing civilian casualties in the north, the area under their
control.
   Wijeratne said Parliament was likely to pass a law Friday
dismissing the administrative council of the Tamil-dominated
Northeastern Province. The dissolution of the council and new
elections were key demands of Tamil Tiger rebels when they held
talks with the government during a 13-month cease-fire.
   The insurgents broke the peace on June 11, causing a fresh round
of fighting in which at least 1,930 combatants have been killed.
   Many civilians also have died, but the numbers are not known.
   The latest casualties included 13 soldiers killed in a rebel
ambush today, military officials said on condition of anonymity.
Also, 27 rebels and one soldier were killed in other skirmishes
since Wednesday, they said.

<TEXT>
   The prestigious Tchaikovsky competition drew to a
close today with final performances by 48 musicians, including 10
Americans.
   Musicians were competing for the top prize in four categories:
piano, violin, and _ for the first time since the event was
initially held in 1958 _ voice and cello.
   Called the ``superbowl of musical competition,'' by one judge,
the Tchaikovsky competition is held every four years.
   The competition, which began June 14, drew 335 competitors from
51 countries, organizers said. Winners were to be announced Friday.
   The top musicians in each category receive a $4,000 streo
system, a gold medal and 5,000 rubles _ a non-convertible currency
that cannot be taken from the Soviet Union.
   ``This is the most important competition in the world,'' said
finalist Hans Choi, 31, a South Korean-born singer who lives in New
York City. ``I must sing perfctly in six languanges because the
judges come from so many countries.''
   This year, for the first time, not only are the contestants and
judges international, but the sponsorship as well. The hard-pressed
Soviet hosts turned to a Japanese company to donate the stereo
equipment offered as prizes.
   Deborah Voigt, 29, a singer who lives in New York City, said the
Soviet audiences had been very supportive.
   ``I am a bit overwhelmed. The audience response has been
unbelievable,'' she said. ``I used to think Italians were the best
audiences, but now I think Russians make the best audience by far.''
   The contest spokeswoman, Galina Tyurina, said the four halls
where the competition has been held were filled to capacity for
each performance.
   ``We have nothing but empty shelves in our shops,'' said
Tyurina, ``but we love our music. There is no shortage of music in
our country.''
   Lucia Lin, a 28-year-old violinist from Boston, said she came to
Moscow because of the competition's reputation. Lin plays with the
Boston Symphony Orchestra. ``It's a lot of work _ stressful and
grueling _ but I'm glad I came,'' she said.
   The Tchaikovsky competition is organized by the Ministry of
Culture, the Union of Composers and the All-Union Music Society.

   The hotels are booked, the bulls are
ready and thousands of people were set Thursday to attend the
annual San Fermin festival made famous by author Ernest Hemingway.
   The weeklong festival is to open at midday Friday in this
northern city of 200,000 with the traditional firing of the
``chupinazo,'' a rocket blasted from the city hall balcony that
sets off the celebrations with a bang.
   The festival of San Fermin, made famous by Hemingway in his 1926
novel ``The Sun Also Rises,'' is expected to double the city's
population as thousands of revelers arrive for one of the world's
wildest parties.
   The more daring _ or foolish _ will participate in the daily
running of the bulls, which routinely results in gorings and
tramplings and sometimes even death.
   The ritual occurs each morning of the festival when six bulls
charge down city streets along a half-mile route to the city bull
ring.
   Hundreds of people race ahead of the bulls, hoping not to trip
or get caught in some of the tight turns along the route.
   Most escape unscathed, but not all are so lucky. Since the
festival began, 52 people have been gored to death, according to
city records. Last year seven people were seriously hurt and 198
suffered slight injuries.
   The annual festival honoring Pamplona's patron saint was
inaugurated in 1394. Plagues and wars forced its cancellation
several times, but it has run continuously since 1591.
   The first of the bull runnings is set for Saturday morning. Each
evening, the six bulls that run the city streets will be killed
during bullfights at the city bull ring.

   A herd of elephants went on a rampage
in a northern village, trampling a man to death, smashing crops and

Thursday.
   Panggung village chief M. Nafi said the herd was believed to
have come to the village for revenge after seeing four elephant
carcasses at the rim of the forest, the daily Jakarta Post reported.
   The carcasses were of elephants killed by poachers for their
ivory, it said.
   The newspaper said a 25-year-old villager was killed during the
rampage over the weekend at the village in the regency of Krueng
Aceh, about 1,000 miles northwest of Jakarta.

   A woman traveling with her 2-year-old daughter
threatened to blow up a Soviet airplane unless it was diverted to
Istanbul, Turkey, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Crew members negotiated with the woman while the pilot landed
the Tupolev 134 jet in the dark in the southern city of Rostov late
Wednesday, the official Communist Party newspaper Pravda said.
   A parcel which she claimed contained a bomb was then found to be
empty, it said. The woman, a shop assistant, was arrested by
security forces at the airport.
   Pravda said the flight, carrying 24 passengers, originated in
Sochi on the Black Sea, about 250 miles south of Rostov. It gave no
other details.
   The hijacking bid followed a rash of successful hijackings in
recent weeks in which domestic flights have been forced to fly to
foreign countries.

   Dabry died Wednesday night, but no cause of death was given.
There also was no word on any survivors. His funeral was planned
Thursday.
   On May 12, 1930, Dabry and Mermoz completed the first non-stop
flight between Africa and South America, crossing the South
Atlantic from Senegal to Brazil in 21 hours, 14 minutes.
   Four years later, they completed the first commercial flight
between Paris and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
   Mermoz disappeared in his plane ``The Southern Cross'' off the

   Dabry had served as secretary-general of an association called
``The Old Tigers,'' comprised of pioneers of the early days of
international aviation.

   The nation's farmers are moving toward the
21st century in a financial condition much improved from a few
years ago, an Agriculture Department report said Thursday.
   ``The proportion of farms that are financially vulnerable today
is half that of 1985,'' the report said. ``Farmland prices have
stabilized and are beginning to rise.''
   But the number of farms in the United States ``continued to
decline throughout the 1980s as they have, almost unabated, since
1935,'' the report said. According to the 1987 census of
agriculture, there were just more than 2 million farms, down 7
percent from 1982, when the previous census was taken.
   Small farms, although fewer in number, increased as a proportion
of total farms. Mid-sized farms declined both in number and their
share of the total.
   ``The number of large farms continued to increase,'' the report
said. ``This trend shows little prospect of reversing in the near
future.''
   The analysis by the department's Economic Research Service was
based on an annual report to Congress on the status of family farms.
   ``Virtually all farms in the United States are family-owned
businesses,'' the report said. ``Fewer than 3 percent of all farms
are organized as corporations, most of which are family held.''
   Only 0.3 percent are corporations owned and operated by people
other than a family. Single families own 87 percent of all farms,
and multifamily partnerships operate the remainder.
   ``Because almost all farms are owned and operated by one or more
families, we did not define family farm for this report,'' the
agency said.
   Thomas A. Carlin, one of the authors, said ``a snapshot of the
farm sector'' shows that most U.S. farms are small, non-commercial,
and usually family owned and operated.
   Non-commercial units were defined as those having gross farm
sales of less than $40,000 a year.
   ``Small, non-commercial farms produce a minor share of total
U.S. food and fiber,'' he said. ``They are typically located near
more densely settle urban areas where non-farm employment
opportunities abound.''
   The small farms often operate at a loss, with farm expenditures
exceeding commodity sales, government payments and other
farm-related income.
   ``Family well-being for these small farms depends primarily on
off-farm income, and their average total income in most years is
commensurate with that of all U.S. families,'' he said.
   Most of the nation's food and fiber is produced by ``very large
commercial farms'' that are highly capitalized, Carlin said. Owners
of such large farms typically control several million dollars of
land, machinery and other assets.
   ``Many of the largest farms produce fruits, vegetables and
horticultural specialty crops, crops not covered by federal price
and income support programs,'' he said.
   Farming is the dominant occupation for families operating large
holdings, and annual income in most years is above that of the U.S.
average.
   Families with large operations do report off-farm income, but
that is typically interest, rent or dividends rather than from a
job paycheck. With some exceptions, most large farms are located
away from major urban centers, in areas conducive to large-scale
operations.
   ``The number of mid-sized commercial farms, those in between the
extremes, continues to shrink,'' Carlin said. ``Most of these farms
produce food and feed grains that are included in federal commodity
programs.''
   Thus, he said, mid-sized farms get more than half of all direct
government payments. Operators are usually employed full-time on
the farm, but often someone else in the household works off the
farm.

<HEAD>Congress Likely to Require Double Hulls For Larger Vessels</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is moving slowly toward an agreement
to require double-hulled oil tankers and barges, but
environmentalists already are complaining about a possible
exemption for smaller vessels that ply inland waterways.
   House and Senate conferees next week begin working out
differences in their versions of a long-awaited oil spill bill,
which would increase penalties for spills and hold shippers liable
for environmental damage.
   Conferees are expected to agree that two layers of steel are the
best barrier between crude oil and the environment. But
environmentalists say they worry that smaller barges will be
exempt, which could imperil rivers and ocean harbors _ particularly
in New England, where traffic is heavy and sea beds are rocky.
   ``We're concerned because ... the smaller barges get into
semi-enclosed bodies of water, ecosystems they could destroy with
just a small spill,'' said Clifton Curtis of the environmental
group Friends of the Earth.
   Congressional staffers, environmentalists and shipping industry
lobbyists say it is clear what the final version of the legislation
will look like. They expect a requirement that new tankers and
oceangoing barges weighing over 5,000 gross tons have double hulls,
which consist of a second layer of steel and an airspace between
the sea and the cargo. Older vessels would have to be either phased
out of operation or refitted with second hulls.
   ``At this point the double hull requirement is a foregone
conclusion,'' said a House staffer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   But Curtis and other environmentalists cite Coast Guard
statistics that indicate a majority of spills involve barges under
5,000 gross tons. In 1988, for example, 68 percent of the tanker or
barge ``oil pollution incidents'' investigated by the Coast Guard
involved the smaller vessels.
   Statistics compiled by the Lexington, Mass., consulting firm
Temple, Barker &amp; Sloane Inc. show that of 310 oil-carrying barges,
only 72 are in the heavier weight group that, under the House bill,
would be required to have double hulls by the year 2015.
   Ernie Corrado, president of the American Institute of Merchant
Marine Shipping, said the tanker operators represented by his group
realize that new barges, either foreign or domestic, will be
required to have double hulls.
   ``We've accepted that,'' he said.
   Corrado said owners already have begun ordering new vessels with
double hulls.
   But Corrado's group and others argue that double hulls also
carry risks. Gases trapped between the hull walls could cause an
explosion and a breach in the outer wall could allow water in the
cavity between the hulls, capsizing the vessel.
   The National Academy of Sciences is working on a study expected
to detail some of the weaknesses of double hulls. The Senate wants
to give the secretary of transportation authority to review that
study along with other data to see if alternatives to double hulls
would work as well or better.
   ``It's not simply a question of economics, it's a question of
safety,'' said Joe Farrell, president of the American Waterways
Operators, a trade association representing coastal shippers,
including oil barge haulers.
   The oil spill legislation has been debated in Congress for 15
years, but efforts to pass it out were stepped up after the Exxon
Valdez spill of March 24, 1989. The super tanker ran aground on
Bligh Reef in Alaska, spilling 11 million gallons of crude oil into
Prince William Sound.
   Less sensational but still damaging to the environment have been
barge spills in New York Harbor and Buzzards Bay, Mass.
   Among other provisions, the bill would create a $1 billion
cleanup fund through a 5-cent tax on each barrel of oil created in
or imported to the United States. It also would establish Coast
Guard oil spill response centers along U.S. coasts.
   The double-hull provision is among the few remaining issues in
dispute between the House and Senate.

   An abortion clinic says it may use reggae
music's positive vibrations to drown out the chants of protesters
at its door.
   Mary Litman, a spokeswoman for Women's Health Services Inc. of
Pittsburgh, said the clinic may hire a reggae band to play during
the next large protest by Project Multitude, a Pittsburgh
anti-abortion group.
   The band would play louder than singing protesters and,
possibly, drive away those who dislike reggae music, Ms. Litman
said. The blend of rock 'n' roll and calypso is performed by such
Jamaican artists as Yellowman and the late Bob Marley.
   ``We are going to take the initiative and try to have some
control over what goes on,'' Ms. Litman said.
   In June, Women's Health Services solicited pledges from
supporters based on the number of people who attended an
anti-abortion demonstration. The clinic collected $2,800 after 350
people attended the protest, or about $8 per picket, Ms. Litman
said.
   ``I would rather that our patients and their husbands and
mothers and friends be able to walk into our clinic in total
privacy,'' Ms. Litman said. ``But we cannot keep the pickets away,
so we will use this to thumb our noses at them.''
   The pledge drives and other tactics will not deter the protests,
including one planned for September, said Mary Irwin, director of
Project Multitude.
   ``If the Ku Klux Klan tried to make money off the number of
blacks protesting in Alabama, I hope that would not discourage them
for standing up for what is right in Selma,'' Ms. Irwin said.

   Americans celebrated Independence Day by exercising their
freedom of speech with protests in California and Florida, cutting
a birthday cake for 25,000 in Philadelphia and building a
world-record sandcastle in South Carolina.
   The traditional fireworks, parades and picnics also marked the
Fourth of July festivities on Wednesday.
   The holiday was a record hot one in many parts of the nation,
sending millions to beaches. Among high temperatures were 105 in
Enid, Okla., 104 in East St. Louis, Ill., and 100 in Baltimore.
   ``You can't see the grass, the sand or the water, it's so
crowded out there,'' said Chicago police Sgt. Mike O'Brien,
stationed on the city's lakefront.
   In New York, some people cooled off by ice skating to patriotic
music at Manhattan's indoor Sky Rink, where it was 50 degrees.
   Some Americans celebrated Independence Day with protests.
Demonstrators marched for and against the homeless in Santa Cruz,
Calif. Veterans took to the streets of St. Petersburg, Fla., urging
better health benefits.
   In Little Rock, Ark., black activist Robert ``Say'' McIntosh
traded barbs with 30 to 40 Ku Klux Klansmen from behind a line of
60 state troopers at the state Capitol, but he never carried out
his threat to burn the American flag.
   ``I just wanted to prove that flag belongs to all of us,''
McIntosh said.
   A group in Adelanto, Calif., did burn a flag _ but it wasn't a
protest. The torching of a 67-foot by 102-foot version of Old Glory
was a flag retirement ceremony by the local American Legion.
   Among the larger crowds for fireworks displays Wednesday were
the 1.3 million people who turned out for a blast over New York's
East River and the 400,000 people who watched a show over the
Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.
   Fireworks _ legal and illegal _ also caused injury and
destruction.
   In Torrington, Conn., an errant rocket from the town's
Independence Day display shot into a crowd of at least 10,000
spectators, injuring 19 people, several seriously. In Hickman,
Neb., illegal fireworks started a fire that destroyed a home.
   Someone threw a firecracker into a burning garbage can outside a
party at the Hell's Angels' Manhattan clubhouse, New York police
said. Shrapnel from the resulting explosion injured four people,
including a 14-year-old boy who died at a hospital today.
   Fireworks shows didn't go on at all in some Northeast
communities, where budget cuts curtailed holiday celebrations.
   ``There's just no money,'' said John Craven, a police officer in
Holyoke, Mass. ``The city is in tough shape so nobody put on a
Fourth of July celebration this year.''
   Fireworks displays also were canceled in Aspen and Vail, Colo.,
because extremely dry conditions posed a fire danger.
   Celebrations turned violent in some places.
   Two people were wounded, one critically, and three people were
arrested early Wednesday in Santa Monica, Calif., in shootings
police blamed on gangs at the ``Dawn's Early Light'' sunrise
fireworks display. The display was moved from night to early
morning three years ago to cut down on gang violence.
   Three people were wounded by gunfire and nine people were
arrested in Fort Worth, Texas, when the annual holiday celebration
in the Como neighborhood turned violent Tuesday.
   In more peaceful celebrations, the Boston Pops concert on the
Esplanade in Boston drew more than 150,000 people, while in Boston
harbor ``Old Ironsides'' _ the USS Constitution _ made its yearly
turnaround.
   With the Chicago suburbs being bugged lately by cicadas, a group
of men dressed up to look like the insects and participated in Lake
Bluff's Independence Day parade.
   July Fourth also was a day for awards.
   In Philadelphia, birthplace of the Declaration of Independence,
former President Carter accepted the $100,000 Liberty Medal and
helped Mayor W. Wilson Goode cut ``America's Birthday Cake'' _ a
giant pastry big enough to serve 25,000 people.
   In Decatur, Ala., former hostage Frank Reed accepted the Audie
Murphy Patriotism Award. In return, he gave the people of Decatur a
piece of the Berlin Wall and called on Americans not to forget
those who remain captive in Lebanon.
   Glenn and Leslie Loy of Traverse City, Mich., earned a less
weighty prize at Windermere Beach on Mackinac Island, Mich _ $200
for winning the annual International Mixed Doubles Stone-skipping
contest. The Loys combined for 27 skips.
   In Myrtle Beach, S.C., as many as 10,000 people built 10.5 miles
of what promoters called the world's longest sandcastle. The city
lost the title it had earned with a 5-mile castle when Long Beach,
Wash. built a record 6.5 mile-long structure in June.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Ocean May Confuse Global Warming Record</HEAD>

   Weather changes caused by unusual Pacific
ocean currents may have led scientists to overestimate how much the
Earth has warmed up in recent decades, according to a new study.
   But, says the author, it may be that global warming helped cause
those changes in the ocean.
   Jim Angell of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration has calculated the amount of global warming
associated with the El Nino events over the last couple of decades.
   Subtracting the ocean effects reduces the global warming by
one-fourth between the 1960s and the 1980s, according to Angell's
report, being published Friday in Geophysical Research Letters, a
journal published by the American Geophysical Union.
   But he cautions against quick assumptions about which is cause
and which effect.
   It may be that part of the increase in global warming is a
result of the strength of the El Nino events in the 1980s, but it
may also be that the global warming led to more and stronger El
Ninos, Angell said in a telephone interview.
   Concern about global warming has grown in recent years, with
many scientists worried that increasing carbon dioxide and other
gases in the atmosphere will act like a greenhouse, overheating the
planet.
   Scientists have estimated that the layer of air closest to the
Earth warmed by 0.33 degrees Celsius (0.59 degrees Fahrenheit)
between the 1960s and the 1980s.
   Several of the warmest years recorded occurred in the 1980s, a
time when at least two of the so-called El Nino events also took
place.
   Angell, of NOAA's Air Resources Lab in Silver Spring, Md., noted
that ocean warming in El Ninos can contribute to changes in global
temperature.
   El Nino events involve unusually warm water moving eastward in
the Pacific Ocean. They can affect weather events worldwide during
their lifetime of a year or so. The strongest El Nino in at least a
century occurred in 1982-83 and a milder one took place in 1987-88.
   Angell found that after subtracting the effect of the El Nino
warming from the record, the air had warmed by 0.24 degrees Celsius
(0.43 degrees Fahrenheit), 27 percent less than the original
calculations.
   In addition, 1988 is no longer the warmest year on record, being
only slightly hotter than the overall average, Angell concluded in
the journal article.
   Subtracting the effects of the El Nino also cuts in half the
annual variations in global temperature, Angell explained, and
makes it easier to see the cooling that results from volcanic
eruptions.
   Scientists had expected the eruptions of the Indonesian volcano
Agung in 1963 and Mexico's El Chichon in 1982 to cool the globe
because of their smoke and ash blocking sunlight.
   No cooling was apparent, however, which prompted Angell's study.
He found that the warming effect of El Nino swamped the cooling
from the volcanoes in the original record. When the El Nino warming
is deleted the volcanic effects become much more obvious, he
explained.
   The El Nino is named with the Spanish word for the Christ Child
because it was first noticed by South American fishermen and
generally occurs around Christmas time.

   Public schools should offer day care,
meals and health screening for preschool, kindergarten and
elementary school children, the nation's largest teachers' union
said Thursday.
   The board of directors of the National Education Association
approved a committee report that said public schools should be the
primary provider of such early childhood services. It said they
should be universal, with low or no cost to the child, and all
children would have equal access.
   With the exception of Head Start, most day care or preschool
programs are offered by private or non-profit organizations. Head
Start provides education, meals and health screening for needy
youngsters ages 3 to 5 but officials said only a small percentage
of eligible children are served by the program.
   Public schools also are ``an acknowledged socializing agent,''
with established systems that allow for easy handling of money, the
report said.
   The committee said its recommendations were prompted in part by
changes in American families and the labor force. It also cited
changes in the demographics of poverty, increases in the preschool
population and its changing ethnic composition.
   ``The need for education and care programs for young children is
not being met,'' the report said. ``NEA believes that early
childhood programs must be available for all 3- and 4-year-olds.''
   NEA statistics showed that between 1960 and 1985, the percentage
of traditional households _ mother, father, two school-age children
_ decreased from 60 percent to 7 percent.
   It also said that more than 3.2 million mothers work outside the
home, and 200,000 more mothers join the labor force yearly.
   By 1995, it is estimated that 80 percent of children under age 6
will have mothers working outside the home.
   The number of such children is expected to increase by 9 million
this year, from 14 million in 1980 to 23 million. Of this increase,
55 percent will likely live in poverty _ and poverty is the most
valid predictor of educational failure.

<HEAD>Federal Officials Believe Convict Plotted Escape for Lehder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man convicted on weapons charges may
have been plotting to help Colombian drug kingpin Carlos Lehder
escape from federal prison, a prosecutor said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Anthony Bruce said investigators believe
Dominic Taddeo was involved in planning a jailbreak attempt for
Lehder, a key figure in the Medellin drug cartel in the early 1980s.
   Investigators reached that conclusion after searching a storage
locker rented by Taddeo in Allentown, Pa., Bruce said.
   ``We found stuff in the Pennsylvania locker that led us to put
two and two together and determine there might be an attempt being
planned to get Carlos Lehder out of Marion,'' he said.
   Lehder is serving a 140-year sentence at the federal prison in
Marion, Ill., for drug trafficking and conspiracy.
   Bruce would not be more specific about what was found in the
locker.
   Taddeo was sentenced last week to 17 years in prison for illegal
possession of weapons and for jumping bail on those weapons charges
two years ago.
   A federal grand jury in Rochester is hearing allegations that
Taddeo was involved in three mob-related killings in the early
1980s. Taddeo, 33, has never been charged in those killings.
   Bruce said he will recommend that Taddeo serve his sentence at
Marion, considered the nation's highest-security prison.
   ``As I understand Marion, you do not leave your cell unless
you're in the company of two guards,'' Bruce said. ``You might get
somebody out of Marion with the Russian army, but short of that,
you're hurting.''

<HEAD>Moore's Friend Testifies She Saw Barry Use Cocaine</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: New throughout with developments on admitting Farrakhan and
Stallings.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former business partner of the ex-model who
participated in a sting operation against Marion Barry testified
today that she saw the mayor snort cocaine from a straw during a
1986 party.
   In another development, a federal appeals court refused to order
the admission of two black leaders as spectators at the trial.
   Carole Bland Jackson said the drug use occurred in the bathroom
of a Washington apartment after a 1986 city-sponsored cruise on the
Potomac River to which Barry had invited Rasheeda Moore.
   Moore and Jackson worked together on Project Me, a self-esteem
modeling program for teen-age girls that Barry asked Moore to set
up.
   ``The mayor and Rasheeda were sitting on the side of the bathtub
and ... cocaine was visible,'' Jackson testified. ``I snorted
first, then Rasheeda took it, then the other gentleman and Mayor
Barry.'' She did not identify the other man.
   Jackson was the third witness in Barry's drug and perjury trial
to testify that she actually saw him use drugs. Moore testified
last week that she and Barry used drugs together on more than 100
occasions. Convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis also testified that
he and Barry used drugs together.
   When asked by assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin if she was
sure that Barry had used drugs, Jackson responded, ``absolutely
positive.''
   Jackson said she left the apartment a short time later, after
``the mayor came out and made sexual advances towards me, which I
declined.''
   Jackson also described using drugs in Barry's presence on
another occasion in 1986. She testified that while she did not see
the mayor use cocaine then, the mayor was in a bathroom where
cocaine was present, holding his nose and ``sitting there
sniffing.''
   Prosecutors introduced into evidence a videotape of a September
1986 press conference in which Barry dismissed criticism of a city
anti-drug plan that targeted drug buyers by using undercover
officers as drug pushers.
   ``I have no sympathy for those who are crybabies about the fact
that we have police officers selling to those who want to buy
drugs,'' the tape showed Barry saying. ``We want everybody to know
that the next drug buy may be from a police officer.''
   Retchin said that since the tape showed Barry was aware such
undercover tactics were being used, Barry could not complain he had
been improperly tricked into buying crack cocaine from an
undercover FBI agent when he was arrested in a sting operation Jan.
18.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged
drug use.
   One of the possession charges stems from the sting operation, in
which Barry was videotaped smoking crack cocaine in Moore's hotel
room.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who is presiding
over Barry's trial, had refused to allow Nation of Islam Minister
Louis Farrakhan and Bishop George Stallings to attend the mayor's
trial on Barry's courtroom passes. Barry appealed the decision.
   The appeals court said today Barry's arguments for admitting the
two are premature and returned the case to Jackson for further
consideration.
   The appeals court said Jackson should rule on the matter based
on arguments that would be filed by the two excluded black leaders,
   Barry's arguments for admitting Farrakhan and Stallings can only
be made on appeal from his conviction, if there is one, the appeals
court said.
   The two were refused admission to attend the trial last week
because, Jackson said, their presence would be ``potentially
disruptive and very likely intimidating.''
   Barry said his constitutional right to a public trial was being
violated.
   ``The court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Marion Barry Jr.'s
Sixth Amendment claim at this time,'' said the appeals panel.
   ``We believe that the most appropriate course ... is to
require'' Farrakhan and Stallings ``to present their First and
Fifth Amendment claims to the district court,'' said the
three-member panel of appeals judges.
   ``Only Barry's counsel addressed the court concerning the
admission of Farrakhan and Stallings; no one representing Farrakhan
and Stallings presented their separate claims,'' the panel said.
   The National Bar Association and the National Conference of
Black Lawyers objected to Jackson's decision to bar Farrakhan and
Stallings, a former Roman Catholic priest who broke from the church
to lead his own congregation.
   The two black lawyers' organizations complained Wednesday that
the decision to bar Farrakhan and Stallings was ``unconstitutional
and highly outrageous.''
   The National Bar Association filed a friend of the court brief
supporting the American Civil Liberties Union in appealing the
ruling to the appeals court. The ACLU argued that Farrakhan and
Stallings are entitled to view the proceedings.
   Jackson's lawyers argued that judges have wide discretion to
protect order and that he is ``doing his best to run a fair and
orderly trial under the most difficult circumstances.''

and Stallings presented their separate claims,'' the panel said.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged
drug use.
   The National Bar Association and the National Conference of
Black Lawyers objected to Jackson's decision to bar Farrakhan and
Stallings, a former Roman Catholic priest who broke from the church
to lead his own congregation.
   The two black lawyers' organizations complained Wednesday that
the decision to bar Farrakhan and Stallings was ``unconstitutional
and highly outrageous.''
   The National Bar Association filed a friend-of-the-court brief
supporting the American Civil Liberties Union in appealing
Jackson's ruling. The ACLU argued that Farrakhan and Stallings are
entitled to view the proceedings.
   Jackson's lawyers argued that judges have wide discretion to
protect order and that he is ``doing his best to run a fair and
orderly trial under the most difficult circumstances.''

   A musically inclined 3-year-old boy who is
losing his eyesight to cancer had his dream come true when the West
Virginia Make-a-Wish Foundation gave him a piano.
   Jeremy Sirbaugh received the piano Tuesday at his home in a
ceremony attended by 30 friends and family members. The foundation
grants the wishes of seriously ill children.
   Since birth, the Weston boy has suffered from retinal blastoma,
and the disease already has claimed one of his eyes, said his
pediatrician, Dr. Jeanie West.
   West said Jeremy has undergone radiation treatments and other
medical care since he was 7 months old. The boy's disease is not
fatal, but West predicts he will be totally blind within two months.
   Jeremy's teachers have found him to be musically inclined. His
mother, Louise Sirbaugh, said she will find Jeremy a music teacher.

   Workers at a major car factory don't like what
they have seen so far of the Soviet Communist Party congress, and
other city residents said Thursday they doubted the party could
improve their lives.
   ``I am not satisfied. Things are happening the same old way. The
way we elected delegates was new, but the same old people were
elected,'' said Viktor Gushchin, a worker in the eastern Moscow
machine shop of the ZIL car factory, famous for the hulking black
limousines favored by the party elite.
   The 28th congress of the Soviet Communist Party convened Monday
amid growing friction among members over the party's course, and
increasing despair among citizens that perestroika will make a
difference in their lives.
   Party leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev has come under heavy fire from
orthodox Communists during debates, but they have displayed no new
ideas of their own on how to alleviate the chronic economic and
political crisis.
   ``After the first few days, I am not sure this party has a
future. These leaders must get advice. If these old people stay
then I don't know what is going to happen,'' said Sergei Tkachenko.
``The party leaders must change radically because if it doesn't
then the people won't support them.''
   Of the factory's 60,000 workers, 11,000 belong to the Communist
Party, but their numbers are starting to drop as confidence in the
party dwindles.
   ``We have got to be able to live better. We don't get paid
enough, so people are leaving the party because they are not
satisfied,'' said Sergei Grigoryevich, an 18-year veteran at the
factory.
   All of the workers interviewed in the machine shop during their
break said they were disappointed that so few workers were
delegates to the congress, although the factory itself has three
delegates to the congress. Workers make up just 12 percent of the
delegates and farmers 5 percent.
   ``The leaders don't really know workers problems and it doesn't
bother them so that is why they just utter empty words,'' Tkachenko
said.
   Throughout the city, residents appeared doubtful and depressed
by the party's failure to improve their lives.
   ``I don't care about this congress. I'm sick of hearing about
it. They talk, talk and there are no changes. They should take
decisions to make things better so people can see it,'' said Igor
Smirnov, a driver for a local cooperative.
   ``The delegates say they are working. Well, they should have
something to show for their work and they don't,'' said Smirnov,
who worked as an ambulance driver before joining the budding
cooperative movement two years ago.
   The party did not win high ratings either at the Cheremyushki
market, an open-air bazaar of fruits, vegetables and milk products
grown on private plots.
   ``I think the party is going to break apart. Who knows what will
happen then. But to tell you the truth I am not paying much
attention to the congress,'' said Yelena Lissovskaya as she ladled
up bottles of sour cream.
   The mood was sullen at a nearby state grocery story on Leninsky
Prospekt, a wide avenue in the southern part of the city.
   ``Nothing is going to happen. They've been at this perestroika
for five years and look at this store _ some milk, a bit of cheese,
nothing else. Nothing good is going to come out of this,'' said
Lydia Lyanova, one of the cashiers in the dimly lighted shop.
   ``I'm not going to talk politics with you. If you want to talk
salami or cheese, OK, but otherwise please get out,'' the store
director told a reporter. He would not give his name.
   ``I'm not a Communist. How should I know what they're doing
downtown? Anyway, other parties and groups will soon be registered
and the Communist Party wont't count for much anymore,'' said Sasha
Anykin, as he swept a dusty boulevard with a handmade broom.

   Contractors will be laying cobble stone streets
again as part of a reconstruction project in Manhattan's SoHo Cast
Iron Historic District, the city announced Thursday.
   The city will spend $11 million during the next two years to
rebuild Greene and Mercer streets. The work will include new
sewers, water mains, catch basins, street signs and traffic lights,
the Transportation Department said.
   Because the district was designated a landmark area in 1973, the
project will include distinctive street lights and fire hydrants
and the existing cobble stone roadways will be restored by hand.
   ``It's worth a few extra dollars to maintain the quality of the
neighborhood,'' said department spokesman Joseph DePlasco.
   About 85 percent of the funding is coming from the federal
government, he said.
   Mercer Street will be rebuilt from Canal Street to Eighth
Street. Greene Street will be rebuilt from Canal Street to Houston
Street.
   The landmarked area contains the largest collection of full and
partial cast-iron facades in the world and retains much of the
character of a 19th century commercial district.

   Jesse Jackson said today he will run for one
of the district's two ``shadow senator'' posts in the September
primary election.
   The shadow senators will be unpaid lobbyists for D.C. statehood,
with no official duties.
   Jackson, a two-time contender for the Democratic presidential
nomination, said on Fox Television's Morning News that holding the
post would allow him to help ``expand democracy'' in the District
of Columbia.
   ``That's what statehood is all about,'' Jackson said. ``More
people live here than five states, we pay more taxes than 10
states, we pay more taxes per capita than 49 states, and yet no
vote on Capitol Hill. It's taxation without representation. It's
not fair. We deserve statehood.''
   City voters approved the ``shadow'' plan in a 1980 referendum.
The city's only representative in Congress is a non-voting delegate
in the House.
   Jackson said election to the post would have no bearing on
whether he decides to run for president in 1992. ``The two are not
connected whatsoever,'' he said.
   Jackson told reporters before attending a luncheon today at
Howard University that statehood would improve the lives of
district residents. ``The premise is statehood means less taxes and
better hope,'' he said.
   Jackson's political plans have been the subject of speculation
since he moved to the nation's capital last year.
   In February, he announced he would not run for mayor, but he
refused to rule out some other political race.
   Some supporters had encouraged Jackson to run for the city's
non-voting House seat, but candidates must live in the District of
Columbia for more than three years to be eligible to enter that
race.
   Other candidates for the ``shadow'' posts include James Foreman,
a longtime civil rights activist, and Harry Thomas Jr., the son of
city councilman Harry Thomas.
   Although voters approved the ``shadow'' plan in 1980, the city
council twice canceled scheduled votes to fill the posts. Under a
plan approved by the city council this spring, district voters will
select two ``shadow'' senators and one ``shadow'' representative to
lobby full-time for statehood on Capitol Hill.

   All that glitters could be sold by IRS
agents who seized the store where country music stars have for
years bought their rhinestones.
   The Alamo, stocked with shark-skin boots, leopard-skin jackets
and sequin gowns, was seized June 11 by the Internal Revenue
Service in a tax judgment against Tony Alamo, a fugitive preacher
who blames a government conspiracy for his troubles.
   An auction hasn't been scheduled, but the government on Tuesday
released an inch-thick stack of papers listing the goods _ 946 lots
from the Alamo store and 183 lots from Alamo's house.
   Alamo says the items are worth $50 million.
   Any auction could be delayed for months by appeals, or the
merchandise would be returned if Alamo decides to pay $7.9 million
in taxes which the IRS claims he owes.
   Such an auction would draw great interest and the agency would
publicize the time and location well in advance, said Dan Boone, an
IRS spokesman.
   ``I can say that we have had a lot of calls from people from out
of state inquiring whether there'll be an auction,'' he said.
``We'll make available to bidders on the day of the auction a
complete list of items.''
   It took three semi-trailers to haul the goods away, Boone said.
   ``We'd prefer not to say where it is,'' Boone said. ``It's just
in safekeeping.''
   Inventory of the store, now serving as the church, shows
hundreds of skirts, shirts, boots, hats, and trademark Alamo denim
jackets.
   The list is studded with such adjectives as sequined, fringed,
feathered, beaded, braided, jeweled, iridescent, electric,
embroidered, elephant-print and lame.
   ``We've done clothing for all the elite people in the world,''
Alamo told The Tennessean newspaper by telephone from a location he
would not disclose. ``Anything that the general public could wear,
right up to the king of England or the Prince of Wales.
   ``If anyone had any right to have anything, it would be us, not
(the IRS), because we're the strongest Christian work. God didn't
want us to be poor.''
   The IRS list includes a leopard-skin jacket, sequin pants, a
black sequin evening gown, 30 fur-lined women's slippers. Furs come
in mink, raccoon, otter and fox (fox varieties include red, indigo,
blush, impala and Scandinavian).
   Boots come in lizard, gator, ostrich, shark, python, crocodile,
cobra and rattlesnake.
   Alamo is an Arkansas evangelist whose church following has been
called a cult and widely dismissed for its virulent attacks on
Catholics and requiring church members work for little or no pay.
   Alamo gained notoriety when he said that his wife, Susan, who
died of cancer in 1982, would be resurrected. He kept her embalmed
body on display for six months while followers prayed.
   In 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against his foundation,
which sought to avoid paying taxes on the meals, clothing and other
goods it supplied its workers.

   A man shot an off-duty police officer this
morning and then fired into a group of teen-age girls and
chaperones boarding buses for a Mormon church camp, hitting at
least one, police said.
   After firing several shots, the gunman fled to a nearby
residence, where he stood off police for about two hours before
surrendering, Officer Leo Speliopoulos said.
   The arrested man's name was not immediately available.
   Speliopoulos said the gunfire broke out about 6:50 a.m. behind a
Glendale Stake center of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints.
   More than 100 girls and adults were in the parking lot, either
boarding buses for a camp on the Mogollon Rim or seeing off the
campers, he said.
   Police said the man opened fire without provocation, hitting
off-duty Officer Steve Checketts, 43, in the arm and chest.
   ``Then he began indiscriminately firing at several individuals
there,'' Speliopoulos said.
   One bullet hit Elaine Beech, 47, in the ankle. The wound was
treated at Thunderbird Samaritan Hospital, and she was sent home.
   Checketts was listed in serious condition at John C. Lincoln
Hospital.
   A parent at the scene said he saw the gunman before the
incident. He said the man was lurking in the back of the parking
lot near a large garbage bin. The parent said Checketts began
walking toward the gunman, and the man opened fire.
   The witness said two other people suffered leg wounds before the
gunman fled on foot. Authorities could not confirm that a third
person was hit.

<TEXT>
   In the rocket's red glare, National Park
Service squadrons stood ready for battle. And by dawn's early light
Thursday, they had vanquished an Independence Day layer of
discarded pop cans, tissue paper and orange peels on the National
Mall.
   Hardy tourists who braved Thursday's 100-degree heat and
humidity to visit the Washington Monument, tour Mall-side museums
or attend a folk festival found only acres of trampled grass, some
strewn pretzels and lines of portable toilets as reminders of the
previous day's huge crowd.
   About 400,000 people celebrated July 4th on the Mall with music,
food and fireworks, leaving behind tons of debris on the wide
expanse of grass that stretches from the Lincoln Memorial to the
Capitol Dome.
   But before the post-fireworks parties had finished, at least 200
Park Service maintenance staff were picking up the trash and
hauling it away, spokesman Earl Kittleman said.
   ``They really swept in and scoured the site,'' said Mary Combs,
press officer of the Festival of American Folklife, who arrived
early Thursday to prepare the Mall for singing, corn-roasting and
basket-weaving.
   ``By the time we got in, it was pretty well cleaned up,'' she
said, waving at the empty expanses of grass on the Mall at 12th
Street.
   ``It started about two hours after the fireworks,'' said Greg
Carey, health services representative for the Red Cross, who manned
a first-aid station late into the night and watched the operation
begin.
   ``They do an excellent job of cleaning up,'' Carey said, taking
a break from his inventory of bug sprays, sun creams and bandages
left over from the previous night's work.
   The overnight pickup produced about 30 to 40 cubic yards of
trash, Kittleman said. He did not have a cost estimate for the
operation.
   In an innovation this year, the waste management company
Browning-Ferris Industries set out bins for recyclable glass and
aluminum, while another private firm, Science Applications
International Corp., organized about 200 volunteers to encourage
picnickers to separate their cans and bottles for recycling.
   The effort produced about 1,000 pounds of glass and 3,000 pounds
of aluminum for recycling, Kittleman said. Profits from the
operation are to be turned over to the Park Service.
   Park police reported 20 arrests from the celebration, including
11 for minor drug violations, five for vending without a permit and
two for fighting, Maj. William Spruill said.
   About 500 people were treated for heat exhaustion, cuts, bruises
or other medical problems, including 80 sent by ambulance to
hospitals and two emergency cases lifted out by helicopter, Spruill
said.
   ``It was a pretty normal Fourth of July,'' he said.

   Soviet armor rumbled through an Estonian hamlet in
a show of military force Thursday, causing postponement of a
veterans' reunion that included soldiers who fought in Nazi
brigades, Estonian media reported.
   Organizers postponed plans for a reunion in the central village
of Tori on Saturday and Sunday after a convoy of 28 Soviet armored
vehicles and 15 loaded troop trucks passed through, the Estonian
News Service said.
   ``Today they arrived in Tori and drove through the town fully
armed,'' the Baltic republic's official news agency said. ``The
Estonian government and the Ministry of Internal Affairs were not
informed about the movement of the troops.''
   ``The Estonian government strongly protests the actions taken by
the army, which can do nothing but exacerbate the already tense
situation, especially in situations such as this where the actions
are connected to political ambitions,'' it said.
   An official of the news service said that soldiers apparently
were in the town only briefly, and then left.
   The reunion planned by the Heritage Society, a group seeking to
promtoe awareness of Estonian history, was indefinitely postponed,
it added. Calls to the Heritage Society's chapter in Tori went
unanswered.
   The dispute highlighted the sensitivity of World War II
allegiances among the Baltic republic's citizens, an issue
underlying Estonia's independence drive.
   Soviet soldiers entered independent Estonia in 1940 under Adolf
Hitler's pact with Josef Stalin dividing Eastern Europe into
spheres of influence. Estonia and its Baltic neighbors Lithuania
and Latvia were absorbed into the Soviet Union.
   Heritage Society members issued an open invitation to soldiers
who fought for Estonian independence, and included those who served
in the German army in World War II, Estonian news reports and
Heritage Society officials said.
   The invitation also was extended to the handful of soldiers
still alive who fought both Germans and Russians to establish
Estonian independence in 1918, and partisans who fought a guerrilla
war against Soviet power.
   A leader of the Heritage Society, Argakas Kullo, said by
telephone from the Estonian capital of Tallinn that about 65,000 to
70,000 Estonians served in German military units during World War
II. He said most fled west with the German army when it retreated
in 1944.
   He said the society does not know how many former German army
soldiers might still be in the republic, or how many would have
attended the gathering.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the reunion was to have
included Estonians who served in Nazi Germany's 20th SS Division
and the Omakaitse punitive squad. It called plans for the gathering
an ``outrage.''
   The Estonian News Service quoted Col. Gen. Fyodor Kuzmin, the
Soviet military commander in the Baltics, as characterizing the
gathering as that of ``fascists'' and members of former SS
divisions. He called the meeting ``inadmissible.''
   The report quoted Estonian State Minister Raivo Vare as
responding that the government had taken steps to prevent trouble.
He also urged the military commanders to avoid interference that
would ``bring a senseless and dangerous aggravation of the
situation,'' the news service said.
   Kullo called the military move through the village of Tori a
``pure provocation'' by the Soviet military.
   The chapter in Tori, a village of about 500 people 75 miles from
Tallinn, organized the reunion months ago with the approval of the
Heritage Society's leaders, Kullo said in a telephone interview.
   Soviet media previously have criticized the Estonian Heritage
Society for what they claim are its fascist leanings.
   But Kullo said Soviet officials have it in for the Heritage
Society because it was one of the first Estonian organizations to
raise nationalist issues in the republic's drive for sovereignty.
   It predated the Estonian People's Front, which has led the drive
to restore the republic's independence, and first raised the issue
of restoring the flag of the independent Estonian republic, Kullo
said.
   Since Estonia restored its blue, black and white flag, many
other Soviet republics have resorted to flags they used before they
became part of the Soviet Union.

   Robert Lee ``R.L.'' Blaffer II, grandson of a
Humble Oil founder and great-grandson of a Texaco founder, has died
of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head,
authorities said.
   Blaffer, 30, was found dead early Wednesday in his bedroom in
his condominium. Police were investigating the death as a suicide,
Sgt. D.D. Shirley said.
   Police said no note was found.
   Friends and neighbors said Blaffer was not employed. They
described him as friendly but a recluse, although last weekend he
took his mother, Camilla, to a family friend's anniversary party.
   His grandfather, Robert Lee Blaffer, was a pioneer in the early
days of the Texas Spindletop oil field discovery in 1902. Fifteen
years later, the elder Blaffer and three partners helped found
Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co., which became Exxon.
   Robert Blaffer married Sarah Campbell, daughter of Texaco
founder William T. Campbell.
   He is survived by his mother. Funeral arrangements are pending.

   An earlier report said that lawyer-editor Gitobu Imanyara,
another opposition member, also was detained today, but an
associate said Imanyara called him to say that he escaped security
forces who came to his home. The associate, who requested
anonymity, said Imanyara had gone into hiding.
   On Wednesday, police arrested Kenya's two top opposition
leaders, who had urged the government to let them hold a public
rally this weekend to push for multiparty democracy in Kenya. The
two men, Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia, are former Cabinet
ministers who have been leading a campaign to legalize opposition
parties this African nation of 23 million people.
   The detentions follow government promises of stern action aimed
at halting the proposed rally on Saturday.
   A Western diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said:
``The government has talked tough. Now it apparently has decided to
act tough.''
   The American Embassy in Nairobi said it was ``following the
situation with interest and concern.''
   Khaminwa was detained at about noon at police headquarters while
trying to ascertain the whereabouts of the two opposition leaders
picked up Wednesday.
   Another lawyer, Japheth Shamalla, who accompanied Khaminwa on
his search, said he last saw Khaminwa as he was being led into the
office of area police chief G.K. Kinoti.
   Later today, Odinga, a two-time former detainee and Kenya's
longest-serving political prisoner, was seized at his office by
plainclothes police, said his lawyer, Gibson Kamau Kuria. Kuria,
also a former detainee and a prominent human rights activist, said
he did not know where Odinga was taken.
   Ibrahim was seized this morning from his office at a prominent
local law firm, according to the Daily Nation newspaper. It did not
have further details.
   The government tonight announced the detentions of Matiba and
Rubia, but it did not say where they were being held or whether
they would be charged. The government did not mention the other
detentions. A constitutional amendment in 1988 empowers authorities
to hold people up to 14 days without charge.
   President Daniel arap Moi has described those seeking to
legalize opposition parties as traitors and subversives, and has
vowed to hunt them down ``like rats.'' He claims the existence of
about 40 tribes in Kenya would invite tribal-based parties, leading
to ethnic divisions and even tribal warfare.
   Matiba and Rubia say the one-party system has led to widespread
corruption and election rigging. They have led a loose alliance of
lawyers, politicians and churchmen seeking change in Kenya, which
has been a de facto one-party state since the last opposition party
was banned in 1969.
   On Tuesday night, Moi issued a warning to people planning to
attend the weekend rally. ``Any blatant attempt to flout the law in
respect of an illegal public meeting will be dealt with ... with
the full resources for the protection of law and order which are at
the disposal of the state,'' Moi said.
   Matiba and Rubia sought to hold the meeting at an historic field
a few blocks from downtown Nairobi. The area, called Kamukunji, was
used frequently before independence in 1963 by Jomo Kenyatta, who
led the movement against British rule and went on to become the
east African nation's first president.
   Although Matiba and Rubia have said they would not attend
Saturday's rally if they were not granted a permit, there have been
widespread rumors that many may others would gather at Kamukunji
anyway.

   President Bush won approval from other Western
leaders today to invite Mikhail S. Gorbachev to NATO in a dramatic
goodwill gesture toward the Soviet Union. Bush also urged them to
declare that nuclear weapons would be used in Europe only as a last
resort but that proposal was questioned by Britain.
   Bush said leaders of the other Warsaw Pact nations of Eastern
Europe also should be invited to NATO. All of the invitations are
for some future date, not the two-day NATO summit that began today.
   The president made his surprise proposal to invite Gorbachev as
NATO began debating steps to reshape the Western alliance as a
result of the rapidly diminishing military threat from the East.
French presidential spokesman Hubert Vedrine reported later that
the allies had endorsed Bush's idea.
   However, a British spokesman said Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher was cool toward the idea of declaring nuclear weapons as
arms of last resort.
   ``I think the trouble is we are concerned about the implications
of last resort,'' the official said. Britain is wary that the U.S.
declaration would remove the useful uncertainty about how the West
would respond if the Soviets staged an attack.
   Diplomatic sources said the proposal was intended to demonstrate
that NATO is changing to keep pace with rapid developments in East
Europe and the Soviet Union. The Warsaw Pact has virtually
collapsed since the Soviets' former military allies began ousting
their long-dominant Communist governments last year.
   Vedrine said NATO would invite Gorbachev ``to come and speak in
the name of the Soviet Union'' before the North Atlantic Council in
Brussels. The council is the principal body of NATO and meets at
various levels: ambassadors, foreign ministers, or on occasion,
heads of state or government. It was not clear who would be
Gorbachev's audience.
   Diplomatic sources said the invitation probably would be aimed
at early December when a meeting of Western foreign ministers
already is scheduled.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush's
proposal amounted to the allies ``reaching out to old adversaries.''
   NATO foreign ministers met for four hours late today working on
the language of the joint statement that will be issued at the
conclusion of talks Friday. They were to get together again after a
black-tie dinner with the leaders.
   Not long ago, it would have been unthinkable for a Soviet leader
to be invited to address the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
which was forged in 1949 to counter potential military aggression
from the East. Now, however, Western leaders speak of the Soviet
Union and East European nations more as friends than foes.
   Along with a series of Bush proposals to revamp NATO for a less
militaristic future, the summiteers were expected to debate whether
Western nations should rush cash assistance to Moscow to help bail
out the Soviet Union's crumbling economy. On Wednesday, Bush seemed
to ease his conditions for Western aid.
   The summit, however, was far from harmonious.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told NATO leaders they should
make a joint declaration with Warsaw Pact countries ``that we no
longer regard one another as adversaries.''
   Said Kohl: ``Confrontation and the Cold War belong to the past.''
   But French President Francois Mitterrand said he opposed Kohl's
call for a joint non-aggression declaration, as does the United
States. One Canadian official said the idea was ``losing speed.''
   Acknowledging that she was in danger of being called ``Cold War
warrior,'' British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher cited detailed
statistics about Soviet arms production and urged NATO to keep up
its guard while reaching out to Moscow and East Europe.
   She also expressed qualms about Bush's proposal that NATO
declare it would use nuclear arms in Europe only as a ``last
resort.'' Mrs. Thatcher urged the Western allies to be avoid any
misunderstanding about their support of European security ``lest
the deterrence of our weaponry is impaired.''
   Besides recommending a ``last resort'' nuclear policy for NATO,
Bush has proposed the eventual scrapping of 1,470 nuclear artillery
shells and 1,560 U.S. tactical nuclear bombs deployed in West
Germany, Turkey and Italy.
   The diplomatic sources, who spoke only on condition they not be
identified, said Bush did not envision that Gorbachev would rush to
London to address the current 16-nation NATO summit, which ends
Friday.
   West German spokesman Hans Klein said ``it is possible'' that a
high-level NATO message to Soviet leaders.
   Separately, NATO spokesman Robin Stafford said NATO Secretary
General Manfred Woerner had accepted an invitation from Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze to fly to Moscow, but that no
date had been decided.
   ``We are at a turning point in Europe's history,'' said Mrs.
Thatcher as the summit got under way.
   ``Our signal from this meeting must continue to be one of
resolve in defense, resolve and unity and defense, coupled with
willingness to extend the hand of friendship to Eastern Europe and
the Soviet Union,'' she said.
   Bush, looking tired after an overnight flight to London, sat
next to Mrs. Thatcher and Secretary of State James A. Baker III as
the leaders gathered around a long oval table in a chandeliered
room of a government mansion.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she had received messages from Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Czechoslovak President Vaclav
Havel within the last 24 hours. She did not disclose the contents
but said the two leaders were ``as interested in the results of
this summit as we are.''
   Kohl insisted on full NATO membership for a united Germany, and
said there was no reason for Soviet concern.
   Such a development would ``enhance their own stability and offer
them a new opportunity for partnership,'' Kohl said.
   Offering words of caution, Mrs. Thatcher said, ``NATO has
defended peace with freedom and justice but it's never threatened
anyone. The cornerstones of that sure defense must remain, for we
don't know what the future holds. But its architecture may change
in the new situation.''
   Machine gun-toting police patrolled Heathrow Airport's VIP
lounge and sharpshooters watched from rooftops as the NATO leaders
converged for their critical meetings in Lancaster House, a 19th
century mansion in central London.
   The primary purpose of the meeting is to transform NATO from a
now-outdated military machine into what essentially would be a
political alliance.
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev oviet citizens' lives in two years or
would resign.

   Actor Gene Hackman narrowly avoided a
heart attack when he checked into a hospital complaining of chest
pain, his doctor said today.
   ``We think we got him just in the nick of time,'' Dr. Herbert
Semler said at a news conference after he treated the actor for
partial blockage of a coronary blood vessel.
   Hackman, 60, was vacationing on the Oregon Coast when he began
suffering the pain. He was admitted Tuesday to St. Vincent Hospital
&amp; Medical Center.
   Semler said Hackman suffered from a narrowing of an artery
leading to the heart. The doctor said he inserted a balloon
catheter into the artery.
   Semler said he was recommending an exercise and diet plan for
Hackman, who lives in Beverly Hills, Calif.
   ``He's feeling fine and he's ready to make another movie,''
Semler said. He said his patient would be released late today or
Friday.
   Hackman finished filming a new movie in Europe just before his
Oregon vacation.
   The son of a journeyman pressman, Hackman is a former truck
driver and soda jerk. His most acclaimed role to date was as the
rough-and-tumble narcotics cop Popeye Doyle in 1971's ``The French
Connection.'' His performance won him an Academy Award.
   He didn't pursue acting until he was in his 30s, attending the
Pasadena Playhouse with Dustin Hoffman to study. His first break
came in 1964, when he played opposite Sandy Dennis in the Broadway
comedy ``Any Wednesday.'' He followed that a few years later with
1967's ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' in which he played Clyde's brother
Buck and was nominated for an Oscar. His work in 1970's ``I Never
Sang for My Father'' brought him another Academy Award nomination.
   In 1974's ``The Conversation,'' directed by Francis Ford
Coppola, he played an obsessive surveillance agent. Other credits
include ``Lilith,'' ``Hawaii,'' ``A Covenant With Death,''
``Downhill Racer,'' ``Bite the Bullet,'' ``Scarecrow,'' ``Night
Moves,'' ``Lucky Lady,'' ``The Domino Principle,'' ``A Bridge Too
Far,'' ``Superman,'' ``The Package,'' ``Reds,'' ``No Way Out,''
``Target,'' ``Hoosiers,'' ``Mississippi Burning, ``B.A.T. 21,'' and
``Loose Cannons.''
   Hackman's upcoming releases are ``Postcards from the Edge'' and
``Narrow Margin.''

   The Navy has decided to name its last Los
Angeles-class attack submarine the USS Cheyenne in honor of the
capital of Wyoming, the Pentagon announced Thursday.
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney hails from Casper, Wyo., and
served the state as a member of the House of Representatives from
1979 until he was chosen to lead the Pentagon in 1989.
   The Navy also announced the names of other new ships authorized
for construction in the current building program, including two
Ohio class ballistic missile submarines. Named for states of the
Union, they are the USS Rhode Island and the USS Maine.
   Two Arleigh Burke class destroyers were named after naval heroes
and leaders in the naval service.
   The USS Russell honors Rear Adm. John Henry Russell, a
distinguished commander in the Civil War, and his son, Maj. Gen.
John Henry Russell, a former Marine Corps commandant. The USS Paul
Hamilton honors Paul Hamilton, who served as the Secretary of the
Navy from 1809 to 1813, the Navy said.
   Two names were assigned to Supply class fast combat support
ships, the USS Rainier, and the USS Arctic.
   Three Avenger class minesweepers were given the names USS
Ardent, USS Rockford and USS Dextrous.
   Three Osprey class coastal minehunters were given the names USS
Pelican, USS Robin, and USS Oriole, while one Stalwart class ocean
surveillance ship was named the USS Impeccable.
   Three ocean survey ships were named the USS Waters, the USS
Pathfinder and the USS Sumner, the Navy said.

<HEAD>East Germans Stage Warning Strikes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 10,000 East Germans demanding
better pay staged brief warning strikes Thursday, and Prime
Minister Lothar de Maiziere complained about unreasonably high food
prices.
   Despite the gloom pervading much of East Germany's rickety
economy, Economics Minister Gerhard Pohl said that 63,490 private
companies set up business, creating 150,000 jobs. But unemployment
is expected to surge over the next months as East Germany faces
competition from the West.
   Pohl also said at a news conference that 6,777 of East Germany's
8,000 state companies were being privatized.
   East and West Germany merged their economies and social welfare
systems on Sunday in a prelude to full German unification, expected
after all-German elections, proposed for Dec. 2.
   Several thousand metalworkers struck seven plants near Leipzig
after pay talks deadlocked two days ago, according to the state ADN
news agency.
   The half-hour stoppages were organized by West Germany's
powerful IG Metall labor union, which threatened to stage ``more
than just warning strikes'' unless negotiations resumed, ADN said.
   The agency gave no specifics on the workers' demands. It also
did not say why the negotiations collapsed.
   In southwestern Erfurt, 9,000 workers in metalworking and
electric equipment industries rallied outside their labor union's
headquarters as contract talks began, ADN said.
   They demanded job security and more say in how their companies
are run.
   IG Metall wants East Germany to adopt the West German system of
stipulating salary scales and job descriptions in huge collective
contracts that bind all workers in a specific industry.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said in
Thursday's Die Welt newspaper that lack of self-control on the
salary front ``will lead straight to unemployment.''
   De Maiziere, in an address to parliament Thursday, said the
prices of some foodstuffs varied 100 percent from one East German
region to another.
   ``There's no way that can be justified merely by higher
transportation costs or overheads,'' he said.
   ADN reported price rises of 400 percent to 600 percent in the
northern Mecklenburg and Pomerania regions and said there were long
shopping lines in southeastern Dresden.
   ``There are cities in East Germany where the average price
levels are way above those in West Germany,'' Pohl said. ``We need
certain guarantees that citizens ... won't be exploited.''
   In his parliamentary address, de Maiziere also urged NATO
reform. Leaders of the Western alliance began meeting in London
Thursday to discuss the pact's future amid a changing Europe.
   ``NATO must regard itself as an alliance of free and democratic
nations in the most comprehensive sense, and reform its structure
and strategy,'' the East German leader said. ``That means saying
goodbye to the current `flexible response' strategy, which relies
on forward defense and using nuclear weapons as the first party in
a conflict.''

   Albania today reimposed some travel
restrictions, the Austria Press Agency reported, after hundreds of
its citizens stormed foreign embassies or gathered outside them in
an effort to flee their homeland.
   The reported government move, only two days after the
restrictions were lifted, came as diplomats were deadlocked over
the fate of more than 200 Albanians who have taken refuge in the
embassies.
   The Austrian report, apparently based on official sources in
Tirana, the Albanian capital, said the measure was necessary
because of the ``alarming situation'' in front of the foreign
missions.
   On Tuesday, a new Albanian law went into effect allowing any
adult to apply for a passport. The law also said that Albanians
holding passports could apply directly to foreign embassies for
visas.
   The Austria Press Agency said the government announced today
that Austrians could no longer apply to the embassies for visas.
The report mentioned nothing about any change in the new passport
law.
   The Austrian news agency, which has had a reporter in Tirana for
the last few weeks, said another 15 people had asked for asylum at
the West German Embassy, and at least 20 refugees were said to have
climbed the fence of the Czechoslovak Embassy, already sheltering
25 people.
   If the figures are correct, the total of refugees now holed up
inside foreign missions would be between 270 and 290.
   Witnesses in front of the West German Embassy claimed a man was
brutally beaten and dragged away by security forces, but a German
government spokesman in Bonn said there were no reports of new
disturbances outside the mission.
   The asylum-seekers, many of whom crashed through gates or scaled
walls to enter embassies earlier this week, present one of the
biggest challenges in 45 years to the rulers of Europe's poorest,
most isolated country.
   Albania, the last hard-line Communist country left in Eastern
Europe, in recent months has expressed interest shedding its
isolationist ways and broadening ties with other nations.
   But the Communist monopoly on power continues. Communist Party
chief Ramiz Alia, who succeeded Stalinist strongman Enver Hoxha,
has firmly rejected a the type of multiparty system that has taken
hold in the rest of Eastern Europe.
   The lifting of the travel restrictions on Tuesday was part of a
reform package adopted in May. Under it, Albanians who previously
were not allowed to travel freely were entitled to passports; a ban
on religion was lifted; and the death penalty for defectors was
abolished.
   Earlier today, a diplomat said by telephone that as many as 500
Albanians assembled in front of the Yugoslav Embassy, waiting for
travel visas. Another crowd of several hundred people was waiting
outside the West German mission and a smaller group in front of the
French Embassy, the diplomat said.
   In Geneva, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar today
urged authorities in Tirana to be ``consistent'' in allowing the
Albanians seeking refuge to leave the country.
   Perez de Cuellar visited Albania in May, the first visit by a
U.N. secretary-general. He helped persuade the government to allow
six brothers and sisters to leave Albania for Italy.
   In Brussels, the 12 European Community nations also urged the
Albanian government to allow its citizens to leave.
   They also urged Albanian authorities not to remove any of the
Albanians from the embassies but to respect ``the inviolability of
diplomatic missions.''
   The United States has no embassy in Albania since the two
countries do not have diplomatic relations.
   A Hungarian diplomat who was reached from Budapest today said a
man and a woman walked into the embassy compound this morning as
``we were opening the gate to let a car out.'' The two brought the
number of refugees inside to six.
   ``There is a strong police presence around the embassy, but no
incidents,'' said the Hungarian diplomat who, like all others,
refused to be identified.
   The Austrian news agency said no agreement was reached in a
meeting between Yugoslav Ambassador Novak Pribicevic and Bashki
Dino, a director at the Albanian Foreign Ministry. Pribicevic was
chosen to represent other foreign diplomats in the talks.
   Last week, a few Albanians hoping to flee their country of 3.2
million sought political asylum at embassies. Word of their success
apparently spread and on Monday their numbers swelled.
   Dozens of refugees were shot at by security forces as they
clambered over walls or crashed trucks through embassy gates in a
desperate bid for freedom, diplomatic sources said.
   It was not immediately known how many people were injured or
arrested. At least three people were wounded by gunfire from secret
police agents, said diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Between 30 and 40 refugees suffered minor injuries when their
truck crashed through the iron gates of the West German Embassy, a
spokesman in Bonn said.
   The embassies were scrambling to find ways to feed the refugees.
   Albania refused on Wednesday to grant landing permission for a
cargo plane carrying relief supplies for the West German Embassy,
where 86 Albanians had sought refuge, said Hanns Schumacher, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman in Bonn.

<TEXT>
   West Germany on Thursday welcomed President Bush's
proposal to use nuclear weapons only as a last resort and called on
NATO to remove all nuclear-tipped artillery shells from Europe.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is under enormous
domestic pressure to get rid of nuclear weapons on German soil,
also said NATO and the Warsaw Pact should declare a formal end to
more than four decades of the Cold War in the summit's final
communique.
   ``The hallmark of the alliance's traditional political role is
that it extends the hand of friendship and cooperation to former
enemies who renounce confrontation and show tangible proof,'' Kohl
said.
   ``We are prepared to solemnly state in a joint declaration with
the Warsaw Pact countries that we no longer regard one another as
adversaries,'' Kohl told the 15 other alliance leaders.
   The United States opposes such a joint declaration between NATO
and the Warsaw Pact.
   The West Germans were pleased with Bush's ``last resort''
proposal, made at the opening of the two-day summit, to use nuclear
weapons only as a last resort.
   If adopted, the Bush proposal would represent a fundamental
shift in NATO's current ``flexible response'' doctrine, which is
designed to create uncertainty about when the alliance uses nuclear
armaments.
   Hans Klein, the West German government's spokesman, agreed with
Bush's proposal. ``The nuclear weapons were almost exclusively seen
as a means to prevent war,'' he said. ``When you speak of them as a
last resort, that is a formulation that is accepted by us.''
   Kohl also proposed eliminating nuclear-tipped artillery shells
from Europe. Bush has indicated his willingness to withdraw the
1,470 American shells, most of them located in West Germany.
   In general West Germany, along with Italy, have sought to lessen
the focus on nuclear weapons without abandoning them; Britain and
France, which have their own nuclear arsenals, have been less
willing to relax the nuclear deterrent.
   Since 1983, there have been massive protests in Europe,
especially West Germany, over the installation of medium-range
nuclear missiles.
   But the United States has withdrawn 54 of its 108 Pershing 2
missiles, and 16 of its 96 cruise missiles from West Germany. The
pullout is continuing.
   Kohl has been at the forefront of extending a helping hand to
the Soviets, as West Germany seeks to remove the Kremlin's
objections to NATO membership for a united Germany.
   Klein underscored that view Thursday, again stressing the need
to support the reform processes in the Soviet Union and elsewhere
in Eastern Europe.
   The spokesman said a discussion about Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's mounting domestic difficulties ``came up again and
again'' during the summit's first day. But he declined to say what
assessment the NATO leaders had made of Gorbachev's chances for
political survival.
   The Soviet president the day before had said his government
should step down if it can't turn the country around within two
years.

<HEAD>Pentagon Plans To Consolidate Accounting Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top Pentagon officials will develop plans to
streamline the varied financial and accounting operations for the
armed services and defense agencies, it was announced on Thursday.
   At present, Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and defense
agency operations function independently.
   Deputy Defense Secretary Donald Atwood has instructed senior
Pentagon officials to develop organizational plans to consolidate
the operations under the direction of the department's comptroller,
a Pentagon statement said.
   Those officials, who are scheduled to begin their work next
week, will submit plans to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney for
approval within the next six months.
   The consolidation comes as part of Cheney's much-touted Defense
Management Review, an attempt to make the department more efficient
amid the nation's budget constraints.
   The statement said the services and agencies have their own
operations, policies, management and overhead structures, develop
and use their own accounting and finance systems, and set many of
their own priorities.
   ``There is a great need within the department for
standardization of financial and accounting information. The
integrated ... organization will enable us to use our limited
resources with greater efficiency,'' the statement quoted Atwood as
saying.
   The new organization will encompass centers that employ 7,000
civilians and 500 military personnel.
   They include:
   _Army Finance and Accounting Center, Indianapolis, Ind.
   _Navy Accounting and Finance Center, Crystal City, Va.
   _Navy Finance Center, Cleveland, Ohio.
   _Marine Crops Finance Center, Kansas City, Mo.
   _Air Force Accounting and Finance Center, Denver, Colo.
   _Defense Logistics Agency Finance Center, Columbus, Ohio.
   _Washington Headquarters Services Finance and Accounting
Operations, Pentagon.
   Those are the centers that oversee the pay going to the nation's
active, reserve and retired military officers. They also supervise
the civilians who work for the department and administer payments
to defense contractors, transportation and travel payments,
accounting, and reporting to the Treasury Department and the Office
of Management and Budget.
   The changes will not immediately affect positions at the various
centers, ``but one of the objectives is to reduce cost. We expect
the work force to be smaller in the long run,'' Defense Department
spokesman Bill Caldwell said.
   Streamlining the centers into one organization will mean fewer
jobs, but positions will be pared ``in increments, primarily
through attrition and retraining personnel to fill positions in
other areas where ever feasible,'' Caldwell said.
   He said a savings of $150 million annually is anticipated when
the operation is fully implemented, an estimate that amounts to
slightly less than 10 per cent of the current operational costs.
The savings estimate was derived from a study of the major
functions that will be consolidated, the official said.
   Although up-front costs for the consolidation could run over
$100 million, they are expected to be offset in the long run, the
official said.
   No decision has been made on where the new organization will be
located.

   Two more bodies have been recovered of
victims of flash floods that ravaged eastern Ohio last month,
bringing the toll to 26 known dead and seven missing, officials
said Thursday.
   About 5{ inches of rain fell near this eastern Ohio village in
three hours on June 14, sending walls of water down Wegee and Pipe
creeks.
   A woman's body was spotted Wednesday night in the Ohio River by
boaters. The body was recovered five miles south of Shadyside by
West Virginia authorities, said Belmont County Coroner's
Investigator Chuck Vogt.
   The 26th body was found Thursday about two miles south of the
mouth of the Wegee, washed up on the Ohio shore of the Ohio River,
which divides Ohio and West Virginia, he said.

<HEAD>Name Change Proposed for Soviet Communist Party</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders will consider a proposal
to change their party's name in order to regain the people's trust,
a spokesman said Thursday.
   Col. Gen. Dmitri Volkogonov, a prominent historian, proposed
that the party change its name to something like ``The Party of
Democratic Socialism,'' spokesman Alexander Lebedev said.
   However, the idea was unlikely to win support at the
4,657-member party congress, a poll by the congress' sociological
service found. It reported that 80 percent of delegates favored
keeping the name as it is, and only 14 percent backed changing it,
according to the nightly news program ``Vremya.''
   But Volkogonov, a three-star general who has written
ground-breaking biographies of Josef Stalin and Leon Trotsky, told
the congress' section on party renewal that the name change was
inevitable.
   ``In his (Volkogonov's) words, even if the proposal doesn't find
support now, in two or three years it will nonetheless be necessary
to take this step,'' Lebedev reported.
   The proposal came at a section meeting that was closed to
journalists.
   Lebedev said Volkogonov also argued that the current party name
was a legacy from Stalin. The historian said Communist ideals have
turned out to be ``a lovely utopia'' whereas socialism deals with
more immediate, attainable goals.
   ``The renaming is not a goal in itself, but it's needed to
restore people's trust,'' Lebedev quoted Volkogonov as saying. He
spoke at a briefing Thursday evening.
   The section decided the proposal should be brought to the floor
of the congress, Lebedev said, without specifying when it will be
addressed.
   Several Eastern European Communist parties have changed their
names or even disbanded in the past year in a struggle to retain
vestiges of their former power amid political upheaval.
   The congress, which began Monday and is scheduled to run for 10
days, comes at a time of crisis for the Soviet party. It is not in
immediate danger of losing its dominance of the political scene,
but its authority is at an extreme low, members are reported
quitting by the thousands and radical Communists have talked of
splitting off and forming a new party.
   The congress, meeting in the Kremlin's massive Palace of
Congresses, is technically the highest organ of the Communist
Party, empowered to set the party line, change the leadership and
revamp the party's entire structure.
   It broke into several sections Thursday after three days of
plenary meetings at which Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the party leader
and president, underwent a barrage of criticism for flaws in his
reforms but also received repeated votes of personal support.
   Lebedev reported that in other action:
   _ Many delegates urged a sweeping turnover in the party's top
leadership, perhaps by as much as 90 percent.
   _ Deputy Prime Minister Leonid Abalkin received heavy criticism
for his speech Wednesday, in which he maintained that if the
Communist Party does not support the country's switch from a
planned to a market economy it will be left on the sidelines of
history.
   _ Gorbachev, who sat in on the section on agriculture, urged the
party to talk less and do more. The party ``has to understand that
its monopoly is over, and it has to prove its right to an
avant-garde role with deeds,'' he reportedly said.
   _ Several high-ranking officers accused the party of propagating
a foreign policy that led to the loss of Eastern Europe and the
weakening of the nation's defenses. Others defended the country's
foreign policy as ``victorious.''
   Earlier Thursday, a local Communist official said Gorbachev had
acknowledged to a meeting of his colleagues that the Kremlin cast
them adrift as it rapidly switched signals in a bid to quiet
republics' demands for autonomy.
   Filip Stroganov, a party leader from the Baltic republic of
Latvia, said Gorbachev had converted him from an opponent to a
supporter during a meeting with more than 300 district and regional
officials late Wednesday.
   ``I like people with character,'' Stroganov told reporters.
``Yesterday I saw his character.''
   Stroganov said that regional leaders complained that Gorbachev
and the central leadership changed their minds too often on a new
structure to bind the Soviet Union's republics together.
   Latvia's neighbor, Lithuania, already has declared independence.
The parliament of Latvia and the third Baltic republic, Estonia,
have signaled their intention to follow.
   ``We don't have a clear position on this question,'' Stroganov
said. ``The lack of a precise position on this issue put us in an
awkward situation.''
   Gorbachev ``agreed with this yesterday,'' he said. The regional
leaders had been pressing for a meeting for more than two years,
and Gorbachev also acknowledged it had been a mistake to put it off
for so long, he said.

   When a speechwriter for Nelson Mandela struggled
for a reference to ``Motortown'' music for the anti-apartheid
leader's speech here, a flight attendant came to the rescue, local
newspapers reported Thursday.
   The writer wanted to use an Aretha Franklin song that would
relate to the struggle of the people, and he asked flight attendant
Germaine Smith for help, according to the Detroit Free Press. The
Detroit News carried a similar report.
   Smith, of Hyattsville, Md., suggested the Marvin Gaye song
``What's Going On,'' which Mandela quoted in his June 28 speech at
Tiger Stadium.
   The lyrics, ``Brother, brother, there's far too many of you
dying. Mother, mother, there's far too many of you crying,'' were
quoted by Mandela in reference to the violence and squalid
conditions endured by many blacks in racially segregated South
Africa.
   Before quoting from the late Gaye's 1971 hit, Mandela told the
sold-out crowd that he listened to ``Motortown'' music during his
27{ years in prison on a sabotage conviction.
   Gaye recorded on the Detroit-founded Motown record label.

of Americans believed killed during the Vietnam war.
   Assistant Secretary of State Richard Solomon has told Congress
the Cambodians have remains they believe are those of U.S.

   Cambodian officials have agreed in principle to allow U.S.
experts to examine the remains and to allow repatriation of those
that prove to be American.
   Solomon has said in congressional testimony that the

possible.
   About 80 Americans are still unaccounted for in Cambodia. U.S.
experts have been to Vietnam and Laos on missions related to
missing Americans but never to Cambodia.

<TEXT>
   West Germany on Thursday welcomed President Bush's
proposal to use nuclear weapons only as a last resort and called on
NATO to remove all nuclear-tipped artillery shells from Europe.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is under enormous
domestic pressure to get rid of nuclear weapons on German soil,
also said NATO and the Warsaw Pact should declare a formal end to
more than four decades of the Cold War in the summit's final
communique.
   ``The hallmark of the alliance's traditional political role is
that it extends the hand of friendship and cooperation to former
enemies who renounce confrontation and show tangible proof,'' Kohl
said.
   ``We are prepared to solemnly state in a joint declaration with
the Warsaw Pact countries that we no longer regard one another as
adversaries,'' Kohl told the 15 other alliance leaders.
   The United States opposes such a joint declaration between NATO
and the Warsaw Pact.
   The West Germans were pleased with Bush's ``last resort''
proposal, made at the opening of the two-day summit, to use nuclear
weapons only as a last resort.
   If adopted, the Bush proposal would represent a fundamental
shift in NATO's current ``flexible response'' doctrine, which is
designed to create uncertainty about when the alliance uses nuclear
armaments.
   Hans Klein, the West German government's spokesman, agreed with
Bush's proposal. ``The nuclear weapons were almost exclusively seen
as a means to prevent war,'' he said. ``When you speak of them as a
last resort, that is a formulation that is accepted by us.''
   Kohl also proposed eliminating nuclear-tipped artillery shells
from Europe. Bush has indicated his willingness to withdraw the
1,470 American shells, most of them located in West Germany.
   In general West Germany, along with Italy, have sought to lessen
the focus on nuclear weapons without abandoning them; Britain and
France, which have their own nuclear arsenals, have been less
willing to relax the nuclear deterrent.
   Since 1983, there have been massive protests in Europe,
especially West Germany, over the installation of medium-range
nuclear missiles.
   But the United States has withdrawn 54 of its 108 Pershing 2
missiles, and 16 of its 96 cruise missiles from West Germany. The
pullout is continuing.
   Kohl has been at the forefront of extending a helping hand to
the Soviets, as West Germany seeks to remove the Kremlin's
objections to NATO membership for a united Germany.
   Klein underscored that view Thursday, again stressing the need
to support the reform processes in the Soviet Union and elsewhere
in Eastern Europe.
   The spokesman said a discussion about Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev's mounting domestic difficulties ``came up again and
again'' during the summit's first day. But he declined to say what
assessment the NATO leaders had made of Gorbachev's chances for
political survival.
   The Soviet president the day before had said his government
should step down if it can't turn the country around within two
years.

<TEXT>
   About 5,300 rebels fought government
troops in Monrovia's suburbs Thursday, according to an insurgent
source in neighboring Ivory Coast, while soldiers ransacked stores
and restaurants.
   President Samuel Doe's advisers continued to desert as the
rebels tightened their grip on the capital. On Wednesday, Doe's
most trusted commander, Lt. Gen. Charles Julu, left Liberia,
weakening the president's already fragile position, U.S. officials
in Washington said.
   Meanwhile, a senior rebel leader in the United States accused
the U.S. administration of trying to prevent rebel leader Charles
Taylor from taking power and said the rebels would not halt their
advance to permit peace talks.
   In the city's eastern and western suburbs, growing numbers of
rebels battled soldiers for a fourth consecutive day. The rebels
now control all roads into Monrovia.
   Rebel sources in Ivory Coast said the 800-man contingent that
attacked the capital's suburbs was reinforced by 4,500 others. The
reinforcments brought up heavy armaments captured from army bases
outside Monrovia.
   The rebel source said the insurgents took Schiefflin, the
military camp 12 miles east of Monrovia. The rebels estimated Doe
still had 2,000 fighting men in the capital.
   For the first time since the fighting began, the Christian
missionary station ELWA did not broadcast Thursday evening. It
broadcasts several times a day for several hours. The station is on
the outskirts of Monrovia.
   In Monrovia, government troops shot their way into stores,
warehouses and restaurants under cover of curfew and emptied the
shelves in the early hours of thursday.
   Soldiers roamed the streets in stolen cars, firing in the air to
frighten people and keep them back while they looted. The only
vehicles on the streets were driven by soldiers who left dead and
wounded civilians by the roadside.
   As morning broke, frightened Monrovians ventured out into
deserted streets and discovered at least 16 bodies.
   A man with three bullet wounds bled for four hours in the city's
main waterfront market despite pleas to soldiers to carry him to
the hospital.
   Monrovia's main John F. Kennedy hospital, which like the rest of
the city has been without water and power for more than a week, has
been abandoned by doctors and nurses and most of its patients.
   A serious food shortage in Monrovia has forced people to beg for
rice. ``Give us food, we are dying,'' one man said.
   Rebel leader Tom Woewiyu, based in the United States, said the
Bush administration failed to keep a promise to force Doe out if
the rebels held off from attacking the capital.
   ``The U.S. has had ample opportunity to take this man out ...
But for some reason they don't want to do that. ... Maybe they want
to see a government evolve that does not have Taylor involved in
it. I don't know why. He's an unknown factor, I suppose.''
   Woewiyu said senior State Department officials who had supported
Doe during his 10-year rule were trying to intervene to help him
again now. The State Department has said it questions Taylor's
commitment to democracy.
   Doe, in his heavily guarded executive mansion, said Tuesday he
would resign if his safety and that of his Krahn tribe were
guaranteed, but so far he has shown no sign of leaving.
   In Monrovia, soldiers fired on fishermen in canoes off the
coast, claiming they were transporting rebels.
   Shipping sources said 250,000 tons of rice bound for the
stricken city is on board a ship, the Sea Star, steaming among U.S.
navy ships off Monrovia. The captain reportedly feared the ship
would be ransacked if it docked.
   The sources also said a ship carrying 5,000 tons of rice put in
at the rebel-held port of Buchanan. The British-owned Rizcup
Enterprise was hijacked by rebels off Monrovia last week.
   Health workers said young children and old people in Buchanan
were falling sick and risked dying of starvation last week. Workers
at a nearby rubber plantation were eating pig feed after food had
run out.
   In Monrovia, the food shortage has forced people to forage for
leaves and roots on patches of wasteland throughout the city.
   Meanwhile, Julu, head of the security unit assigned to protect
Doe, fled to neighboring Sierra Leone. He had been chief of staff
only since the weekend resignation of Lt. Gen. Henry Dubar, who
also fled Liberia.
   Julu led army troops who killed more than 2,000 civilians in
northern Liberia after an unsuccessful coup attempt against Doe.
   Liberia was founded in 1847 by freed American slaves and their
descendents who ruled the county until Doe seized power in April
1980 in a violent coup. Liberia was black Africa's first
independent nation.

   The NATO allies on Thursday searched for a way to
draw East European countries, including the Soviet Union, closer to
the Western alliance without giving away military secrets.
   President Bush suggested at the opening session of the two- day
summit of NATO leaders the establishment of liaison offices between
nations in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and the alliance, according
to White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The general purpose is to find some way to give them access to
NATO in a learning capacity and hopefully one in which they would
appreciate where we're coming from,'' he said.
   A diplomatic source, who demanded anonymity, said Bush
emphasized that the Warsaw Pact officials would ``not sit at the
table with us.''
   The novel idea is one of a number of proposals being floated by
the United States and other countries to revamp the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization to respond to diminished East-West tensions.
   The allies want to make NATO, created in 1949 in an era of
hostility and suspicion, appear less threatening to the Kremlin. In
doing so, they hope to encourage Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
to drop his objections to membership in the alliance for a united
Germany.
   West Germany is an influential member of NATO, but East Germany
belongs to the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   The idea of creating a special diplomatic status for the East
European countries reflects the West's uncertainty about how to
deal with its former adversaries.
   The European Community, the trading bloc of a dozen West
European nations, also is struggling to give the emerging
democracies as much economic help as possible _ short of full
membership.
   It has come up with the idea of associate memberships.
   NATO, too, doesn't see its one-time enemies becoming new
recruits.
   ``We're going to have to investigate ways of helping these
countries be part of a bigger whole _ without necessarily having
them become parts of the organization,'' said a senior NATO
diplomat, demanding anonymity.
   ``We don't in any way want to give Hungary, Poland,
Czechoslovakia (for example) the sense that they're being left
out,'' he said. ``But at the same time, we can't officially bring
them in.''
   Officials don't want to upset the balance of power in Europe and
leave the Soviet Union, still a formidable military power, without
allies.
   ``For the Soviet Union not only having a united Germany in NATO
but having some Eastern European countries in NATO would be perhaps
a bit much to swallow,'' said the NATO diplomat.
   Jane Sharp, senior researcher at the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute in Sweden, said, ``The big problem now is
not to exclude and isolate the Russians. Taking East European
countries into NATO probably is not a good idea.''
   Even Hungary, which intends to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact by
late next year, isn't rushing to join.
   ``Hungary does not want to make the European security situation
less stable than it is today,'' Hungarian Foreign Minister Geza
Jeszenszky said after a recent visit to NATO.
   ``Even if it were possible politically for us to think about
applying for membership in NATO, that would be not conducive to
security right now,'' he said.
   But there are ways to create closer links.
   ``I would expect NATO to strengthen and thicken its ties with
like-minded states and reforming states,'' said a NATO official,
demanding anonymity.
   U.S. officials have said Hungary has quietly proposed to NATO
participating as an ``observer'' in political or non-military
committees.
   Fitzwater said details of Bush's proposal have yet to be fleshed
out.
   But he said it could mean inviting the Warsaw Pact countries to
have an observer status at NATO, let them set up temporary or
permanent liaison offices or attend meetings.
   No nations outside of the alliance currently have such a status,
NATO officials said.
   Many countries, including the United States and the Soviet
Union, have separate missions to the European Community, even
though they are not members. Moscow opened its liaison office last
year.
   By doing so, they can keep closer tabs on the community's
business and increase contacts with trading bloc officials. The
United States also uses its mission to voice complaints over trade
policies.
   At NATO, East European diplomats might be able to sit on some of
the many conferences it holds yearly on a range of topics.
   The alliance has panels on science and technology, economics and
one on the challenges of modern society.
   There has been a greater trend toward openness with the East.
   Since 1986, military observers from Warsaw Pact nations have
attended Western war games.
   Last December, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze made
an unprecedented visit to NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
   Since then, the foreign ministers of Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia have stopped by. East German Foreign Minister Markus
Meckel will do so next week.

<HEAD>One-Party Gov't Broadens Crackdown on Opposition, Torture Feared</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The one-party government on Thursday
broadened its crackdown on proponents of multiparty democracy,
arresting four more prominent Kenyans, including the son of a
former vice president.
   The wives of two detained opposition leaders pleaded with
President Daniel arap Moi's government to refrain from torture in
what appeared to be the harshest crackdown since 1982.
   Thursday's arrests, of three lawyers and of the son of a former
vice president, brought to at least 11 the number of people
detained since Wednesday by the single-party government, according
to detainees' families and other sources close to opposition
figures.
   Several other prominent Kenyans went into hiding Thursday night.
   The arrests follow months of official criticism of those calling
for reform, and come in advance of a rumored rally for multiparty
democracy that the government has vowed to prevent.
   Two of those detained, former Cabinet ministers Kenneth Matiba
and Charles Rubia, had asked the government for permission to hold
a meeting Saturday in support of legalizing political opposition,
which has been outlawed since 1982.
   Their request was not granted, but rumor has been widespread in
this East African capital that crowds might nonetheless appear, and
Moi has warned people against attending any meeting.
   Matiba and Rubia were seized Wednesday by plainclothes security
agents. In a press release Thursday, their wives, Edith Matiba and
Hannah Rubia, said that ``our husbands' arrest is intended to force
curtailment of the multiparty debate (and) stop lawful and peaceful
changes which are crucial if Kenya is to avoid the well trodden
path of so many other African states.''
   The women, noting the unexplained slaying in February of Kenya's
foreign minister, said they were ``extremely worried'' about their
husband's lives, and about ill treatment the men might receive.
   ``We appeal to the Kenyan government not to torture our
husbands,'' they said.
   Their statement reflected the heightening tensions that calls
for political pluralism have brought to Kenya, a country best known
for stability and democracy on a troubled continent.
   Since the beginning of the year a loose coalition emboldened by
the changes in Eastern Europe has repeatedly accused the ruling
Kenya African National Union party of intolerance, corruption and
election-rigging. The government has flatly rejected any move
toward multiple parties, and Cabinet ministers have called those
backing such moves subversives.
   Moi, who has ruled Kenya since 1978, has repeatedly threatened
arrests, vowing to hunt down political pluralists ``like rats.'' In
a statement Tuesday, he said the government would use force if
necessary to halt activities it deems subversive.
   ``The government has talked tough. Now it apparently has decided
to act tough,'' said a Western diplomat, speaking on condition he
not be identified further, when asked about the recent arrests.
   The American Embassy in Nairobi said Thursday it was ``following
the situation with interest and concern.''
   Later Thursday, lawyer John Khaminwa was detained at the
provincial police headquarters, Mrs. Matiba and Mrs. Rubia said.
   Mohamed Ibrahim, who is with a law firm whose members have been
critical of the government, also was detained Thursday, according
to the English-language newspaper Daily Nation.
   Raila Odinga, son of former Vice President Oginga Odinga, was
arrested at his office, said Gibson Kamau Kuria, a human rights
lawyer. The younger Odinga, whose father is still seen as a
potential rival to the government despite being removed from the
vice presidency in the 1960s, has already twice been held for
lengthy periods by Moi's government.
   Late Thursday, about 10 police seized Gitobu Iminyara, a lawyer
who edits a monthly magazine that often criticizes the government
on human rights issues,
   Kuria, the human rights lawyer, was one of several prominant
Kenyans who went into hiding late Thrusday.
   Five associates of Matiba, including his driver, two bodyguards
and two personal assistants, also were detained late Wednesday,
according to Matiba's office.
   Kenyan law permits police to hold people without charge for up
to 14 days. Late Thursday the government said it was holding Matiba
and Rubia under public security statutes, but made no mention of
the other detainees. Matiba's daughter, Julie, said the family had
no word on where he was being held.
   Kenya has been a de facto one-party state since the last
opposition party, led by the elder Odinga, was banned in 1969. A
1982 constitutional amendment declared it a one-party state.
   Later that year, the government arrested scores of people
following a failed coup.

<HEAD>Teen-agers Visit Israel, Africa to Promote Racial Harmony</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black student took the podium recently at
a party to promote racial harmony and helped lead the audience of
blacks and Jews through a Hebrew song.
   Last year, Jermaine Cheeseborough was one of a dozen
Philadelphia high school students who traveled together for a month
to Africa and Israel. The message he brought back is that racial
intolerance is encouraged when people from different ethnic groups
don't come into contact with each other.
   Wednesday, six black and six Jewish high school students left
Philadelphia on for a similar trip intended to break down racial
stereotypes.
   The program, known as ``Operation Understanding,'' was set up
six years ago by Philadelphia's U.S. Rep. William H. Gray III, who
is black, and George H. Ross, former chairman of the board of the
American Jewish Committee.
   The 12 students and two chaperones will spend 12 days in the
West African nations of Senegal and Gambia and 12 days in Israel.
They will then visit New York's Harlem and Lower East Side, and
Mississippi before returning home.
   After returning, they'll give talks at high schools, synagogues
and churches.
   ``What you are about to experience is one of the most
breathtaking and awe-inspiring experiences of your life,''
Cheeseborough told the youngsters Tuesday night.
   Cheeseborough said he attended a predominantly black high school
and until the 1989 trip had little interaction with Jewish people.
   ``Now,'' he said, ``I'm awakened.''
   In addition to the travel, there was ``another trip going on
between the students. I gained 11 brothers and sisters. I'm sure
we'll remain friends for the rest of our lives,'' he said.
   Keith Peltzman, 17, one of the Jewish students who left on
Wednesday's trip, said there is a ``silent separation'' between
different races at schools across the United States.
   Even though many schools are demographically integrated, he
said, they are not socially integrated.
   He said many white students let high school programs on
African-American history ``go through one ear and out the other.''
   ``What I hope to gain is an understanding of black culture,'' he
said. ``And I hope to be able to come back to my friends and tell
them about it.''
   The $85,000 needed to fund the program for one year was raised
from private and public sources. Public and private high schools in
Philadelphia were invited to participate. The schools selected 100
applicants initially and that number was narrowed to 12.
   As part of the process, applicants had to write essays on their
own and other ethnic groups.
   ``They wanted to see how aware we were,'' said Lockie Andrews,
16, of Central High School. Ms. Andrews, who is black, was among
those chosen for the trip this year.
   Murray Friedman, the Middle Atlantic States director of the
American Jewish Committee, said a similar program is under way in
Baltimore. Other cities have also expressed an interest.
   At the send-off for the students, Philadelphia Councilman George
Burrell said that as a politician he often faces the problem of
``grown adults not communicating with each other.''
   ``High school is one of the toughest environments for race
relations in America today,'' he said. ``Take your understanding
and try to find a solution to this complex problem.''
   Eighteen-year-old Jolie Davis, a 1988 alumna, said the trip had
taught her to deal with prejudice.
   Davis, who is Jewish and just completed her freshman year at
Brandeis University, said whenever she hears about prejudice
against any racial or ethnic group ``it hurts me.''
   ``One of the important things I learned is that everyone has
stereotypes,'' she said, ``and it's important to break them down.''

   The remnants of the Berlin Wall will be
demolished by the end of this year, the East German defense
minister was quoted as saying Thursday.
   A West German firm has been contracted to tear down what is left
of the 61-mile barrier, Rainer Eppelmann told the state ADN news
agency.
   The rubble will be used to build a new express railway line from
Berlin to Hanover, West Germany, Eppelmann said.
   The barriers separating West Berlin from rural East Germany to
the north, west and south will probably take another year to be
demolished, he said.
   The Berlin Wall effectively fell on Nov. 9, when Communists who
had ousted hard-line leader Erich Honecker lifted all travel
restrictions for East Germans in an effort to retain power.
   Since then, the graffiti-covered wall, the most visible symbol
of the Cold War, has been torn down in dozens of places.
   All controls on the East-West border ended when the two Germanys
merged their economies on July 1. Berlin's most famous border
crossing, Checkpoint Charlie, was hoisted into history late last
month.
   The wall was built on Aug. 13, 1961, to stem the flow of East
Germans trying to escape to the West during repressive Communist
rule.

<TEXT>
   Security forces seized about 800 pounds
of pure cocaine at an airport in northwest Colombia as a wave of
drug-related terrorism intensified in major cities, officials said
Thursday.
   The cocaine was found Wednesday aboard an airplane that was
about to take off for the United States, an army statement said. It
said two pilots at the scene were arrested.
   Police, meanwhile, on Wednesday destroyed a jungle laboratory in
southern Colombia used to process cocaine, a national police
spokeswoman said. She spoke on condition of anonymity.
   During the operation, police seized around 900 pounds of coca
paste, the raw material used to produce cocaine, she said. She
added that two suspected drug traffickers were arrested in houses
near the laboratory.
   In other drug-related developments, six police posts in
Medellin, where the world's most powerful cocaine cartel has its
headquarters, have been bombed since Tuesday night, a Medellin
police communique said.
   The blasts caused no casualties since policemen who had been
stationed at the posts had recently been transferred to other parts
of the city.
   Drug traffickers have been engaged in a campaign to kill
policemen in Medellin in retaliation for a massive anti-drug
crackdown.
   An off-duty police officer was shot dead Wednesday night,
bringing to 160 the number of policemen murdered in or around the
city so far this year, police said.
   Authorities say the Medellin cartel is paying $4,300 to each
young motorcycle-riding assassin who kills a policeman.
   A small car bomb exploded Wednesday night in Bogota, the
capital, destroying three cars, shattering glass in nearby
buildings, and slightly wounding one person, a police official said.
   Bogota Police Chief Yazim Yanine Diaz told reporters that the
bomb, carrying about 70 pounds of dynamite, was part of a terror
wave being carried out by the Medellin drug gang.
   Last week the commander of the army's fourth brigade, Gen.
Harold Bedoya, blamed Medellin cocaine boss Pablo Escobar for
ordering a series of bombings and assassinations in recent months.
   In Medellin alone, five car bombs have exploded so far this
year, killing at least 60 people.
   Officials are offering a $400,000 reward for information leading
to Escobar's capture, dead or alive. He remains at large despite a
massive manhunt.
   Colombia's Medellin and Cali drug cartels supply an estimated 80
percent of all the cocaine consumed in the United States.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Education Secretary Lauro F. Cavazos called
on the nation's teacher colleges Thursday to require all
prospective teachers to learn a foreign language, given the growing
ethnic diversity of U.S. students.
   Addressing 3,051 delegates at the concluding session of the
American Federation of Teachers' annual convention, Cavazos said
teachers had to adjust to the increased linguistic and cultural
diversity of the student body.
   ``Colleges of education should make proficiency in a second
language mandatory,'' he said.
   Cavazos decried the fact that only 10 percent of all college
graduates can speak a second language.
   In a statement from Washington, D.C., David Imig, executive
director of the American Association of Colleges for Teacher
Education, called the proposed requirement a good idea. ``It would
stretch the capacity of many students in education,'' he said.
   The State University of New York-Albany is one of only a very
small number of teacher colleges that have such a language
requirement, Imig said.
   At a news conference, Cavazos also added his support to those
pressing for changes in curricula to reflect cultural diversity.
   ``We have had standardized curricula that have not recognized
the diversity of this nation,'' he said.
   AFT delegates passed two resolutions dealing with cultural
diversity.
   One called upon the federal government and states to increase
funding for bilingual education and support research and training
in that field.
   It also said districts should be free to experiment with
different approaches to teaching foreign language students.
   A second proposal called for development of new history and
literature curricula that reflects the contributions of blacks,
Hispanics, American-Indians and other groups.
   ``We are not talking here of creating a segregated curricula,
one for minorities that features just minority heroes and another
for whites that focuses on just white heroes,'' said the
resolution, which was supported by AFT's leadership.
   Too often, the resolution said, texts have squeezed in minority
contributions as ``sidebars, peripheral to the main story. This is
not good enough.''
   ``Our children need the full picture, the whole truth, as best
it is understood,'' it said.

   The operator of a Kentucky mine where 10
workers died in an explosion last year was fined more than $500,000
on Thursday, the largest penalty ever assessed by the government in
a mine disaster.
   Pyro Mining Co. said it would appeal the fine, which was levied
by the Labor Department's Mine Safety and Health Administration.
The penalty stemmed from 121 alleged violations of federal safety
laws.
   ``We're just not making any comment at all beyond the fact that
we're surprised by the size of the penalty. The appeal is in
process and we will continue that,'' said James Greenlee, executive
vice president of Evansville, Ind.-based Costain Coal Inc., which
owns Pyro Mining.
   The Labor Department contends Pyro managers knew explosive
methane gas was accumulating in the mine four days before the
explosion but failed to take action.
   ``We consider the violations in this case so flagrant and
indicative of the company's negligence that this fine is
warranted,'' William J. Tattersall, assistant labor secretary for
mine safety, said of the record fine.
   Before Thursday, the largest penalty ever assessed for a mine
accident stemmed from a 1976 blast that killed 26 workers at the
Scotia mine near Oven Fork, Ky. In that investigation, the Blue
Diamond Coal Co. was assessed $266,000.
   A May report by the agency said 10 specific violations
contributed to the Sept. 13 explosion in Wheatcroft, Ky., which was
the nation's worst mine disaster in five years.
   The agency charged that managers failed to make required checks
for the deadly gas in the hours before the explosion, failed to
keep enough clean air in the mine to clear out the methane and made
a series of changes in air pathways that caused a methane buildup
the day of the disaster.
   Federal investigators were unable to determine exactly what
triggered the explosion.
   Thursday's announcement said that the company was fined $10,000
_ the maximum per violation _ for each of the 10 alleged violations
investigators said directly contributed to the blast.
   The agency also fined the company $8,000 for 26 other violations
_ 19 involving failure to make required pre-shift safety
examinations and seven that involved electrical violations.
   An additional 13 violations involving electrical safety carried
fines of $6,500 each while the remaining 72 violations received
lesser penalties, the agency said.
   Joe Holland, president of United Mine Workers District 23,
called the fines ``certainly a step in the right direction.''
   ``I would like to see what they actually pay,'' Holland said,
adding that the agency frequently reduces fines after negotiations
with companies.
   The UMW is trying to organize Pyro workers and has strongly
criticized Pyro's safety practices.
   Under federal law, a company can contest allegations of safety
violations and fines by requesting a hearing before an
administrative law judge of the Federal Mine Safety and Health
Review Commission, an independent agency.
   Greenlee said the company already has begun the process of
challenging some of the alleged safety violations and also will
contest certain fines. He declined to say which.

   In many ways it was a typical NATO summit: The
anti-nuclear demonstrators in drizzling rain, the tight security
and the leader who arrived late, France's Francois Mitterrand.
   Mitterrand lived up to his reputation for tardiness, missing a
coffee reception at Lancaster House and delaying the start of the
first meeting.
   Under threatening skies and with a brisk wind blowing, British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and NATO Secretary-General Manfred
Woerner spent about 10 minutes waiting on the steps before
Mitterrand's limousine pulled up.
   The French president also lagged near the end just before lunch
when the 16 NATO leaders gathered to pose for their ``family
portrait.''
   Because of the weather, the picture-taking session was moved
inside to the main hall of 19th century Lancaster House, site of
the 1979 conference that paved the way for Rhodesian independence.
   There was confusion over the toe marks where each leader was
supposed to stand. Mrs. Thatcher helped get the front row lined up.
   Mitterrand arrived second last, just before Danish Prime
Minister Poul Schluter. President Bush and Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney clapped when everyone was finally assembled.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   At the end of the day, the delays didn't really matter.
   The summiteers finished their afternoon session one hour and 40
minutes early, catching motorcades and reporters by surprise. Bush
stood briefly outside the door which was blocked by someone else's
limousine.
   ``They can't get by with that car here,'' he said with some
exasperation before his motorcade pulled off for the U.S.
ambassador's residence where he relaxed before dinner.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Bush's relations with his French counterpart seemed cordial,
according to French officials. They said the president addressed
Mitterrand as ``old chap.''

<TEXT>
   One man whose name was on many minds at the summit was no
Westerner. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, a prime topic
even before Bush's call for him to be invited to address a future
NATO meeting, was 1,600 miles away in Moscow.
   Several observers quipped that Gorbachev probably wished he was
at the NATO summit, where Western allies were trying to find ways
to help him, rather than under attack at the Communist Party
congress.

   Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip hosted the NATO leaders at
a sumptuous dinner of poached sole with truffles, duck garnished
with peaches and cherries, and raspberry ice cream in the crimson
Throne Room of Buckingham Palace. There were five glasses _ for
German white wine, French red, champagne, the queen's own private
stock of port, and water.
   Seven cut-glass chandeliers and two-foot candles lit the room,
where the crimson throne used by the queen at her 1953 coronation
stands on a dais.
   The 52 guests dined at five tables, the queen in a green chiffon
and gold lame gown flanked by Bush and Mitterrand, the prince by
Woerner and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

   Early in the morning, police with dogs combed Green Park,
adjoining Lancaster House and site of the tented press camp.

   The NATO leaders missed about 100 anti-nuclear demonstrators
from Britain and France at the edge of the park carrying signs

they beat on drums.
   Scotland Yard said four demonstrators were arrested for public

   Some disgruntled Soviet coal miners apparently
will go ahead with a one-day political strike next week, ignoring
an appeal by the Communist Party Congress, state media reported
Thursday.
   How many miners will join the strike is still uncertain, but a
labor union official told the Tass news agency that miners in the
Kuznetsk basin in western Siberia will stop work on Wednesday to
protest the Communist Party's slow pace of reform.
   A widespread strike by the stridently anti-communist miners
during the party congress would embarrass the Kremlin leadership
and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, especially since the Communist
delegates asked them to stay on the job.
   Vyacheslav Golikov, chairman of the Council of Workers'
Committees of the Kuznetsk coal basin, said at a news conference in
the western Siberia city of Kemerovo that the miners do not want to
damage Russia, but working people must be protected, Tass reported.
   In some areas of the Kuznetsk basin, miners have decided to
concentrate on repair or maintenance jobs rather than working in
the pits, Tass said.
   In the Donetsk coal basin of the Ukraine, members of the Council
of Strike Committees also have decided to strike for one day,
although some of the rank-and-file miners still are discussing it,
and a final decision will be made by the regional council on
Sunday, the news agency said.
   The largest strike committee in the Donetsk basin, Donetskugol
Amalgamation, is against the stoppage, Tass added.
   A correspondent for the national evening news program
``Vremya,'' in a spot survey at the Mushketovskaya pit, said
two-thirds of the 75 workers on the day shift Thursday supported
the strike.
   A national miners' congress last month voted to strike if Prime
Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and his cabinet do not resign. The miners
blame Ryzhkov for an unpopular economic reform plan, now being
revised, that called for drastic price increases but only minor
steps toward a market economy.
   They also condemned the Communist Party for hindering reforms.
They also demand that the party cells be removed from the
workplace, as well as the armed forces and the KGB secret police.
   Golikov told Tass that the crisis can be averted by the
development of democracy and a market economy and better social
protection of the working people.
   Delegates to the party congress in Moscow urged miners ``to show
restraint during this difficult period of time, to consider
seriously contemporary problems and to realize that the policy of
pressure and of ultimatums can lead to disarray in the economy,
have a negative effect on perestroika and erode living standards.''

   The top British official in Northern Ireland said
Thursday that efforts had failed so far to begin negotiations on
the restoration of local government in the province.
   Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland and the Irish government
indicated that they have failed to agree on a formula for the talks
on ending the 18-year direct British rule in the province.
   Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Brooke, the British government
minister responsible for the province, told the House of Commons in
London that contacts were continuing between the parties, but he
could not announce a date for negotiations.
   Press reports had raised expectations of a breakthrough in the
so-called ``talks about talks'' that have been going on for six
months between Catholic and Protestant leaders in Northern Ireland.
   But Brooke said, ``I had hoped to be in a position by now to
give some indication of when it might be possible to move to formal
talks. I am in fact not yet in a position to do so.
   ``The important thing is that we have been making progress and
will continue to seek to do so,'' he said.
   He added that ``in the end it is a matter for the potential
participants, and in particular for the political parties within
Northern Ireland, to decide if and when the conditions for carrying
matters forward exist.''
   Brooke did not say what issues remain to be resolved, but others
made it clear that the sticking point was when the Irish government
should become involved in the negotiations.
   The Irish government wants to be involved at all stages, while
the Protestant parties in the North envision only a late role in
the negotiations for Dublin.
   ``While substantial progress has been made on a number of
important aspects, a satisfactory basis which would avoid problems
later has not been established,'' Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey said in Dublin.
   Protestant leaders blamed Dublin for blocking progress toward an
agreement on restoring local rule.
   But John Hume, leader of the Social Democratic and Labor Party,
the largest Catholic party in Northern Ireland, said all the
parties, including Ireland, wanted Brooke's initiative to succeed.
   The projected negotiations would be aimed at returning some
power to local government, on a basis acceptable to the Protestant
majority and the Roman Catholic minority.
   Self-government was among the casualties of the violence that
erupted in Northern Ireland in the late 1960s. What began as a
civil rights campaign by the Catholic minority against economic and
political discrimination escalated into sectarian conflict.
   The British army was sent into the province in 1969, and the
British government suspended the Ulster parliament in 1972,
assuming direct rule of the province.
   The Anglo-Irish Agreement, signed in 1985, guaranteed the Irish
government a say in Northern Ireland's affairs as part of a process
designed to promote peace in the province.
   The agreement provoked an angry reaction from the Protestant
unionist parties, which want Northern Ireland to remain linked with
Britain. They broke off all contacts with the British government in
protest.
   It is a measure of Brooke's success that the unionist leaders
are participating in talks which inevitably will involve some
participation by Dublin.
   Brooke has been talking with Protestant and Roman Catholic
leaders in Northern Ireland in an effort to reach an agreement on
opening formal negotiations. These contacts have not included Sinn
Fein, the legal political arm of the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
   The IRA has been fighting to push the British out of Northern
Ireland, unite the province with the Republic of Ireland, and set
up an all-Ireland socialist state.
   Since the British Army was sent to Northern Ireland in 1969,
about 2,800 people have been killed in the violence.
   About 60 percent of Northern Ireland's 1.5 million are
Protestant. Most of the remaining 40 percent are Catholic.

<TEXT>
   President Bush will not likely support any
proposals for Western financial aid to the Soviet Union at next
week's seven-nation economic summit, Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady said Thursday.
   ``I'm not clear that a new set of particulars is called for''
from the Western economic powers, Brady told reporters during a
meeting in his Treasury Department conference room.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is expected to call for
coordinated Western financial assistance for the Soviet Union when
the economic summit begins Monday in Houston. Bush and Kohl will be
meeting with the leaders of Britain, Italy, France, Canada and
Japan to discuss trade, aid and other economic issues.
   Moscow has not officially asked for Western aid, but its economy
is in a shambles. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on
Wednesday told the 28th Communist Party Congress he will resign
within two years if his perestroika program for modernizing the
Soviet economy is not showing positive results by then.
   Brady noted that senior Bush administration officials, including
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, traveled to Moscow recently to provide technical economic
assistance. He said also that Soviet government banking and finance
officials had visited Washington on technical matters.
   ``Aside from that tangible evidence of help and other gestures
of good will by the president, he has said that at this particular
time aid to the Soviet Union is a very difficult subject in this
country,'' Brady told reporters.
   He suggested Bush would be more willing to assist Moscow if the
Soviets stopped supporting Fidel Castro's Marxist regime in Cuba,
and if more progress were achieved in U.S.-Soviet arms control
negotiations.
   On another subject, Brady said he did not expect the Houston
meeting to remove key obstacles to agreement on reforming
international rules covering farm trade.
   That issue is a major source of friction between the United
States and the European Economic Community, which represents 12
West European countries, although the negotiations on trade reforms
involve nearly 90 other countries, too.
   An EEC official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Thursday that his group was not bringing any new farm trade
proposals to the Houston meeting.
   Brady said that Bush is eager for an eventual agreement on
reforms for agricultural and other categories of world trade, but
the president does not expect a major breakthrough in Houston.
   ``Although it's important to get a healthy discussion to take
place in Houston, it's not necessarily the case that anything
determinative will take place there,'' he said. ``To portray
Houston as a turning point ... is mistaking the case.''

   A plane carrying Secretary of State James Baker
was refused permission to land at London's Heathrow Airport because
of congestion caused by a French air controllers' strike,
authorities said Thursday.
   Instead, the military aircraft landed at a U.S. Air Force base
at Mildenhall in eastern England, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
   As Baker was leaving Brussels Wednesday to attend the NATO
summit in London, his pilot was told of a two-hour delay in
British-controlled air space due to the French strike, said a
spokeswoman.
   The 3-day-old strike, which began Tuesday, meant the flight
sector to Britain ``was extremely busy,'' and there was
``tremendous strain on the system,'' she said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   So the plane flew to Heathrow avoiding the British flight lanes,
but was refused permission to land and had to go to Mildenhall
instead, she said.
   U.S. State Department officials called it ``nothing more than a
minor inconvenience.''

<TEXT>
   A paramedic testified Thursday that she found
the Central Park jogger naked and bloodied, kicking and moaning in
a puddle of mud, with a spot in the back of her skull that felt
``mushy.''
   ``There was blood and mud all over her,'' said Estelle D. Paris,
an Emergency Medical Service technician. ``She was cold, cold to
the touch.''
   Paris, 36, was the first medical professional to testify about
the jogger's condition after she was gang-raped and left for dead
April 19, 1989.
   She described how she and partner Rodney Mullins found the woman:
   ``We approached the victim lying in something of a spastic state
... Her arms would go rigid, then her legs would go up. There were
moments when she would go limp.''
   In grisly detail, Paris told the jury about the woman's medical
condition.
   ``Both eyes were swollen shut,'' Paris said. ``There were
bruises on both cheeks. Her lips were bloody, and there were
scratch marks where skin was torn off.''
   Paris said she removed a T-shirt that was tied tightly around
the woman's neck and hands and stuffed into her mouth.
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer showed Paris the
once-white T-shirt, now brown with mud and blood stains. The
witness identified it and said, ``It was wet and bloody at the
time.''
   The jury listened raptly as Paris recounted how she knelt under
moonlight and the high beams of a police car to work on the woman.
   ``She had an occipital depression; it felt mushy,'' Paris said.
   Paris was testifying in Manhattan's state Supreme Court at the
trial of Antron McCray, 15, Raymond Santana, 16, and Yusef Salaam,
16. They are charged with attempted murder, rape, sexual abuse,
assault, robbery and riot in the attack on the woman and two male
joggers.
   The female jogger, an investment banker now 29, was gang-raped,
savagely beaten, and left naked and near death.
   She survived, but suffered brain damage and has no recollection
of what happened that night, Lederer said. The prosecutor has
refused to say whether the woman will testify.
   The three defendants are being tried in an adult court, but if
convicted they will be sentenced as juvenile offenders and face up
to 10 years in prison.
   Three other youths are charged in the attacks and will stand
trial on the same charges later this year.

<HEAD>Zoning Board Rejects Church Services in Industrial Park</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zoning officials on Thursday unanimously
rejected an appeal by Tammy Faye Bakker, wife of imprisoned PTL
ministry founder Jim Bakker, to hold church services at a building
in a busy industrial park.
   The Orange County Zoning Board cited public safety concerns in
upholding a staff decision to shut down services at the newest site
of Mrs. Bakker's New Covenant Ministries _ next door to a welding
shop.
   Mrs. Bakker, who did not attend the hearing, has authority to
operate a radio-television production studio at the location. The
ministry, set up in Orlando last year, previously was housed in a
shopping mall, a hotel and a piano store.
   Attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union accused the
zoning panel of ``trampling on the First Amendment rights of Mrs.
Bakker'' because of her husband's conviction and imprisonment in
the wake of PTL's collapse.
   ``It's a case of guilt by association,'' said Warren Keiner, the
ACLU's central Florida chairman, referring to Bakker's 45-year
federal prison term for fraud.
   Zoning officials acted after several Sunday services were held
in the building in March.
   ACLU Attorney Jerry Bornstein argued that the board ``would be
prohibiting the free exercise of religion'' by ruling against a
church in an industrial area because there was no law against it.
   There has to be ``some overriding government interest against a
house of worship,'' he said.
   Board Chairman Gary Russell agreed, but said there were
sufficient reasons against it.
   ``That site is very intense, at the throat of a heavy industrial
park,'' Russell said, adding that churchgoers could be endangered
by truck traffic and activities such as the welding next door.
   William Parke, a real estate broker representing property owner
Phillip Jordan, said he didn't think churchgoers would be in any
danger, and that services would be ``an adjunct to a radio and TV
studio.''
   Parke later told reporters that even the studio was not
operating now because the building is being modified slightly to
comply with fire-safety regulations. Mrs. Bakker has just signed a
new contract for a 12-month lease and a 12-month option to buy the
site, he said.
   ``Mrs. Bakker is very interested in the property because the
owners have agreed to carry the mortgage and the Bakkers would have
a tough time getting a conventional mortgage,'' Parke said.
   Keiner and Howard Marks of the ACLU's legal division said the
board's decision would be appealed to the Orange County Commission.
   ``We'll file a lawsuit if we're unsuccessful there,'' Marks said.

<HEAD>Three Dead, Dozens Injured, 600 Arrested as Soccer Fans Riot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Fans enraged by England's loss to West Germany in
World Cup soccer rioted in 30 English towns in a night of violence
that left three dead, dozens injured and 600 under arrest, police
said Thursday.
   The rioting, mostly in southern England, broke out Wednesday
night after fans watching live broadcasts from the semifinal in
Italy poured into the streets when West Germany defeated England
4-3.
   More than 35 police officers were injured in clashes with the
rioters.
   In the southern resort town of Brighton, 500 fans roamed the
streets, overturning cars with foreign license plates, smashing
shop windows and looting.
   The mob also chased German and French students through the
streets. Police locked more than 300 students in a nightclub for
their own safety before ferrying them away in buses.
   Also in Brighton, a 63-year-old woman suffered a fatal heart
attack after rioters smashed the windows of her tavern.
   The town has a large population of Germans and other foreign
students attending English language courses.
   Charges of criminal damage, burglary and assaulting the police
were brought against 30 people in Brighton.
   In Hounslow, west London, a 30-year-old man was hit and killed
by a police car answering a riot call.
   In Totton, near Southampton, a 33-year-old man was knocked to
the ground when he tried to stop a group of rioters. He died in an
ambulance and police said they were treating his death as murder.
   Before the crucial soccer game, police had publicized
contingency plans for stop rioting, but the warning failed to deter
violence in more than 30 towns.
   Reports of violence and arrests were reported in normally quiet
towns such as Melton Mowbray, Uttoxeter and Yeovil, Leamington Spa,
Peterborough, Newmarket, Shrewsbury and the seaside towns of
Bournemouth, Weymouth and Worthing.
   In the port city of Southampton, 70 miles southwest of London, a
group of up to 20 youths smashed up the Royal Oak pub. ``When
England lost they went berserk, picking up anything they could find
and smashing it,'' said pub manager Bernard Smedley.
   A spokesman for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said she was
appalled by the violence and the ``mindless vandalism and
hooliganism.''
   In the rioting, two youths were arrested for smashing the
windows of Mrs. Thatcher's childhood home in Grantham, eastern
England.
   In the House of Commons, Sir Geoffrey Howe, standing in as
deputy prime minister while Mrs. Thatcher attended a NATO summit in
London, said all lawmakers could be proud of the England team,
which had never before reached a World Cup semifinal on foreign
soil.
   Disappointment at the match's result could in no way justify the
violence, Howe said.

<HEAD>White Extremists Threaten More Bombings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white extremist group that
has claimed responsibility for five recent bombings promised more
attacks if President F.W. de Klerk continues with his apartheid
reforms, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   Also Thursday, the African National Congress accused the
government of failing to clamp down on white extremists, whose
actions could threaten black-white negotiations on sharing power.
   In other developments, a bomb was discovered Thursday at the
offices of a black mineworkers' union, but it failed to detonate,
police said. The independent South African Press Association said
police believed the bomb at the union office in the central town of
Oberholtzer was planted by right-wingers.
   The pro-government Citizen newspaper said a group calling itself
the White Wolves claimed responsibility for five bombings in
Johannesburg since Friday night and promised to step up its
``freedom struggle.''
   Right-wingers are outraged at de Klerk's stated intention of
ending apartheid and sharing power with the black majority. They
are demanding de Klerk hold a whites-only election and claim the
president would lose to those who favor strict apartheid.
   Police Brig. Gen. Vic Haynes said there were more than 30
terrorist attacks in June, with extreme right-wing groups
responsible for many incidents. However, no right-wing whites have
been charged with any of the attacks.
   The White Wolves have claimed responsibilty for several attacks
in the past two years. Police say they have not been able to
determine if such an organization actually exists, or if white
extremists acting independently have simply adopted the name.
   ``We are concerned that the government is not taking tough
measures against the right-wing,'' ANC leader Walter Sisulu told a
news conference.
   Sisulu said he ``would not be surprised'' if policemen, acting
on their own, were assisting right-wing whites.
   He also accused the government of failing to stop police
violence against black activists. Sisulu said he expected a decline
in such actions following talks in May between the government and
the ANC, the country's largest opposition group.
   ``But we don't see any decline, rather we see an increase,''
Sisulu said. He cited an ANC rally over the weekend where a black
man was fatally shot in a confrontation with a policeman.
   The ANC said it would hold 20 rallies nationwide on Saturday to
call for peace in the eastern province of Natal. ANC supporters and
members of Inkatha, a conservative Zulu organization, have been
locked in vicious faction fighting that has claimed more than 4,000
lives in four years.
   In the Soweto township outside Johannesburg, Sam Mabe, the
assistant editor of the black-oriented Sowetan newspaper, was
killed late Wednesday by two black gunmen in the Soweto township
outside Johannesburg, police said. There was no evidence the attack
was related to the recent bombings, police said.
   Aggrey Klaaste, editor of The Sowetan, the country's leading
black daily, said, ``I am personally shattered, especially for his
young family. It is a great loss to black journalism, and further
indicates how cheap life is in Soweto.''

   Although two Christian Scientists were found
guilty of manslaughter for withholding medical treatment from their
son, the debate continues over a key aspect of the case: When
should the government overrule religious beliefs that affect
children?
   Medical experts on Thursday applauded the verdict against David
and Ginger Twitchell, saying it would help protect children.
   But a constitutional scholar said the decision reflects a
``fundamental unfairness'' because the Twitchells thought they were
protected by a 1971 state law that exempted spiritual healing from
child abuse statutes.
   The prosecution argued that the statute _ which states that
children will not be considered neglected or abused when ``treated
by spiritual means alone'' by an ``accredited practitioner'' _ did
not exempt the Twitchells from manslaughter laws.
   After a two-month trial, the jury Wednesday found the
Twitchells, former Boston residents now living in New York, guilty
of involuntary manslaughter for not seeking medical treatment for
their son, Robyn.
   They were found to have recklessly and wantonly caused their
2{-year-old son's death by relying solely on Christian Science
spiritual healing to treat his five-day illness. The boy died April
8, 1986. An autopsy showed he suffered from a bowel obstruction.
   Special Prosecutor John Kiernan said the case was not an attack
on religion, but sent the message that parents must protect their
children. Steve Lyons, a defense attorney, contends $2 million was
spent by the Suffolk County district attorney's office to prosecute
the Twitchells so that ``the DA could put on a morality play.''
   The case does not end here. Defense attorneys Thursday filed an
appeal in Suffolk Superior Court on behalf of the Twitchells, who
were not present.
   Kiernan recommended probation for the couple _ who could have
received up to 20 years in prison _ and that their other children's
health be monitored, according to Peter O'Toole, a spokesman for
the prosecutor.
   According to Lyons, Judge Sandra Hamlin said she would not
exceed the recommendation. She scheduled sentencing for Friday.
   Lyons said the appeal was based on Hamlin's failure to consider
or instruct the jury on the spiritual healing exemption and her
allowing a ``mocking and sarcastic trial of Christian Science
doctrine to occur.''
   The Christian Science Church, which has its world headquarters
in Boston, has long taught that sickness and disease can be healed
by prayer alone, just as sin can be washed away by spirituality.
   Since 1980, there have been seven prosecutions of Christian
Science parents. Five have been convicted, one acquitted and one
case was thrown out, according to child rights activist Rita Swan,
a former Christian Scientist who actively seeks such prosecutions.
   Harvard law professor John Mansfield, a expert on church and
state issues, says recent U.S. Supreme Court cases reflect a trend
away from protecting religious beliefs as the nation moves toward a
more secular society.
   The Twitchell case, along with a recent Supreme Court case
involving peyote use by a Native American church, retreats from
former ``special treatment'' accorded a person's religious belief,
Mansfield said.
   ``They believe what they believe. That's their faith; they're
helpless in the grip of their faith,'' he said. But the recent
cases ask: ``Why should they have preferential treatment?'
   Physicians, such as Dr. Michael Grodin, a pediatrician and
medical ethicist for Boston University, applauded the guilty
verdict. He said it sends a message that religious convictions do
not exempt parents from calling a doctor when a child faces a
serious or life-threatening illness.
   ``No religion is going to be allowed to be a defense against
abuse and neglect,'' he said. ``The bottom line is we have to have
standards for protecting children.''
   Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law expert at Harvard, said the
verdict reflects a ``fundamental unfairness'' because the
Twitchells relied on the state's spiritual healing exemption when
they made their decisions about Robyn's health, but the jury was
not so instructed.
   The state invited the Twitchells to rely on spiritual healing
``then turned around and prosecuted them without giving them the
opportunity to put their reliance on state law before the jury,''
Tribe said.
   Tribe said he believed the state's highest court would reverse
the decision. However, he said, the exemption should be revoked.
``There should be a very clear duty on the part of all parents to
take children to the doctor when a certain threshold'' is reached.

   Some 8,000 voices will try to create a
global four-part harmony Friday to sing the praises of a barbershop
quartet convention.
   The singers plans to offer visitors to Union Square their
renditions of barbershop standards ``Sweet Adeline,'' and ``Toot
Toot Tootsie'' and other variations in baritone, bass, tenor and
soprano.
   The convention is held by the 52-year-old Society for the
Preservation and Encouragement of Barber Shop Quartet Singing in
America, which is pledged to vocal precision uncluttered by the
need to read music.
   Women have their own barbershop singing groups, under the name
Harmony International. They sing the same parts as the men, only in
a different key.
   This year, the sellout convention attracted a quartet from the
Soviet Union, as well as Austria, England, Canada and New Zealand.
Although purely an American singing form, barbershop singing is
spreading over the globe.
   The Soviet quartet is a first for the convention. Members call
themselves ``The Quiet Don,' after the River Don.
   Also for the first time, the special international competition,
involving 17 choruses of 50 to 130 men each, will include the best
harmonizing teams of the United States, Canada and England.
   Even before the formal proceedings began, the barbershop singer
let the world know they were ready. On Monday, while checking in at
their convention hotel, one or more of the groups would break into
an impromptu song in the hotel lobby.
   ``It is a highly formalized form of music,'' said convention
spokesman Al Zemsky, touching on crucial questions including
``tightened chords,'' ``extended sound,'' ``melody lines'' and
``overtones.''
   The competition to produce the 1990 international quartet
champion began Thursday with 51 quartets from the United States,
England and Sweden participating. The finals are scheduled for
Saturday night.
   The society, based on the modest American harmonizing of the
latter 19th century, was formed in 1938 in Tulsa, Okla., by two
businessmen. They worried that their favorite kind of music would
be overwhelmed by movies and the phonograph.
   Today, the Society for the Preservation and Encouragement of
Barber Shop Quartet Singing in America today about 36,000 members.

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Thursday re-elected
Vaclav Havel as president, and the former dissident playright
promised to do everything possible to create ``a happier future''
for his homeland.
   Thousands of people chanted ``Long live Havel!'' as they
celebrated the inauguration in a carnival-like atmosphere outside
Hradcany Castle.
   The election of Havel to a two-year presidential term culminated
the political transition from Communist to democratic rule that has
reshaped the country in just seven months.
   ``The two-year term for which I was elected will roughly
coincide with the demanding time of the new building of our state,
with a time which will culminate in the adoption of our new
constitution,'' said the 53-year-old Havel, speaking to the crowd
from a castle balcony.
   ``I promise you, that to the extent of my powers and abilities I
will do everything so that we can pass through this time
sucessfully and a happier future opens up for our country.''
   Earlier, Havel, running unopposed, was elected president by the
Parliament with the necessary three-fifths majority in a nationally
televised secret ballot. A total of 234 deputies voted for him, and
50 against.
   There were no abstentions. Sixteen deputies were absent.
   ``I think the fact that there were 50 deputies voting against me
is a very good, significant and convincing evidence of the
democratic character of my election ... I am quite rejoicing over
that. I would not feel good if I had been elected by 100 percent as
was my predecessor,'' Havel said, shortly after the voting.
   Stefan Kvietik, who was nominated for president earlier this
week by the separatist Slovak National Party, refused the candidacy.
   Havel, who on Dec. 29 became the country's first non-Communist
president in 42 years, was nominated by Civic Forum and its Slovak
counterpart, Public Against Violence. The two groups led the
peaceful revolution that toppled the hard-line Communist regime in
November and won a convincing victory in multi-party elections held
last month.
   The parliamentary session, held in a medieval hall at the
Hradcany Castle, was opened by Parliament President Alexander
Dubcek, whose ``Prague Spring'' reforms of 1968 were crushed by
Soviet tanks.
   ``By the election of the president, the revolutionary
transition, which we have been living through since November ...
will be ended,'' Dubcek said.
   He praised Havel as a man who ``has proved competent as a
politician (and) statesman .... Vaclav Havel, a playwright in the
seat of president, has gained, by his work, the confidence of our
people.
   ``He proved himself even in the times of repression of freedom
and rights, when it was not easy or convenient to show a firm stand
of a citizen and bravery,'' Dubcek said.
   After the ballot, Havel was led by Dubcek and other officials up
the red-carpeted aisle of the Vladislav Hall to sign the oath of
office.
   As a military band played the national anthem inside the hall,
the sound of a 20-gun salute reverberated throughout the city.
   After the parliamentary session, Havel, accompanied by Defense
Minister Miroslav Vacek, attended a military parade in a castle
courtyard.
   In the courtyard, an old Tatra 80, the car used by
Czechoslovakia's first president, Tomas Garrigue Masaryk, was
waiting. Havel will use the classic car for ceremonial occasions,
Czechoslovak television said.
   The streets and open spaces around the castle were filled with
people enjoying performances by rock and folk bands and theater
ensembles.

<HEAD>Federal Lab Says Its Has Found Nearly All Of $45 Million In
Missing Items</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lawrence Livermore Laboratory said
Thursday that it has accounted for all but a fraction of the more
$45 million in equipment that had been reported missing.
   In a statement released by the Department of Energy's San
Francisco office, officials said that as of Tuesday the lab could
account for all but two percent of the items a report by the
General Accounting Office said were missing.
   ``We have located about 98 percent of all the missing
property,'' said Carol Powell of the DOE in San Francisco. ``We
don't expect we'll ever achieve 100 percent.''
   A statement by the nuclear weapons research and development
facility laboratory in Livermore, Calif. said that only the only
equipment still missing had an acquisition value of about $4.5
million and a current value of about $2 million.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, released a report
Tuesday saying that as of mid-January, the Livermore laboratory was
missing more than $45 million worth of equipment. The study said
there were 27,538 missing items, ranging from typewriters to
computers, and that the missing equipment represented 16 percent of
the Livermore inventory.
   Livermore said the laboratory continued its inventory efforts
after the GAO study ended in January and that all but a fraction of
the missing items have been accounted for.
   Carl J. Bannerman, an assistant director of GAO and the leader
in the Livermore study, said the laboratory claim about finding its
missing equipment ``has not been verified.''
   He said laboratory and DOE officials were aware of concern about
the Livermore inventory as early as 1988 and that the GAO started
looking into the property management controls at the laboratory in
May 1989.
   ``The property controls are so inadequate that it took them a
year to find that many'' of the missing items, said Bannerman.
   Powell said the Livermore's new inventory claims were
investigated and proven by the DOE. The San Francisco office, she
said, ``conducted a random sample survey which statistically
validated the findings.''
   Lawrence Livermore Laboratory is owned by the Department of
Energy and operated by the University of California at Livermore.
   In hearings two years ago before a subcommittee of the House
Committee on Energy and Commerce, there were allegations that
government-owned equipment was being stolen from Livermore to
finance purchase of illegal drugs.
   In its report, the GAO said that among capital equipment with an
acquisition value of more than $5,000, there were 1,605 items
missing, valued at about $20.6 million. Capital equipment would
include large items such as X-ray generators and oscilloscopes.
   The laboratory statement said that 99.65 percent of this
equipment has now been accounted for.
   The GAO report said that non-capital equipment valued at more
than $500 included 25,516 missing items valued at $24 million.
   Livermore's continuing inventory has now found 97.39 percent of
this equipment, the laboratory said Thursday.
   In a third category, which the GAO described as made up of items
attractive to theft, there 407 missing items with a value of
$800,000.
   Livermore said that it has now accounted for 98.96 percent of
this equipment.
   In the report, the GAO said property controls at the laboratory
``are not adequate to ensure against theft, unauthorized use or
loss.''
   Livermore director John Nuckolls said in a statement that the
laboratory is committed to full protection of government property
and to the improvement of its accounting and inventory systems.

<HEAD>Upset Win Puts Garrison in Path of Navratilova's Quest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Zina Garrison's upset win Thursday
over top-seeded Steffi Graf at Wimbledon puts her in the path of
Martina Navratilova's single-minded quest for a ninth singles title
and tennis immortality.
   In a daring, acrobatic attack, Garrison, 26, put away Graf,
two-time Wimbledon champ, in a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 semifinal victory
Thursday.
   Navratilova, still formidable at 33, moved within one victory of
Wimbledon history Thursday. With a sweeping left-handed serve
followed by a backhand volley into the open court, she dispatched
Gabriela Sabatini.
   No. 2-seeded Navratilova beat fourth-seeded Sabatini 6-3, 6-4.
   Navratilova said she couldn't wait to face fifth-seeded Garrison
on Centre Court.
   ``I'll have to try not to hyperventilate when I get out there,''
she said. ``I'm sweating already just thinking about it. I'd like
to play the final right now rather than wait two more days.''
   On the men's side, Ivan Lendl continues his quest for the one
top title that has eluded him with a semifinal match Friday against
Stefan Edberg. Boris Becker and unseeded Goran Ivanisevic face off
in the other semifinal. Lendl, Becker and Edberg are the top three
seeds, respectively.
   Navratilova has beaten Garrison 27 times in 28 matches. Her only
loss was in the quarterfinals of the 1988 U.S. Open.
   Before the two go on court, they must settle the matter of
attire.
   Garrison, who lacks an endorsement contract, has been wearing
tennis togs from Navratilova's personal line.
   ``We'll be twins if we wear the same outfits,'' Navratilova
said. ``Maybe we'll flip a coin to see who wears what.''

   Jesse Jackson announced on Thursday that he
will run for one of the District of Columbia's two ``shadow
senator'' posts to lobby Congress to grant the city statehood.
   ``Statehood for the District of Columbia is the most important
civil rights issue in America today,'' Jackson said. ``More people
live here than five states, w than 10 states, we
pay more taxes per capita than 49 states, and yet no vote on
Capitol Hill.''
   The shadow senators will be unpaid lobbyists for D.C. statehood,
with no official duties.
   The city has one delegate to Congress who may vote in coe pay more
taxesmmittees
but not on the floor of the full House.
   Jackson, a two-time contender for the Democratic presidential
nomination, said that the post would allow him to help ``expand
democracy'' to the district.
   Jackson's political plans have been the subject of great
speculation since he moved to the nation's capital last year.
   He said election to the shadow post would have no bearing on
whether he decides to run for president in 1992. ``The two are not
connectedation for all Americans and safe and affordable housing.
   ``If the American revolutionaries were right, that `taxation
without representation is tyranny,' D.C. residents must take the
initiative to demand statehood if it is ever to be achieved,'' he
said.
   Initial drafts of the city bill called for $1.3 million to be
spent on the two shadow senators. But city councilmembers this year
said the positions shouldn't be funded in light of the city's
current budget deficit.
   There are three other candidates for the two positions.

<HEAD>Scappy Activist Known For Hunger Strikes For Homeless</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Mitch Snyder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mitch Snyder who forced a president to
provide shelter for Washington's street people was a single-minded,
often-abrasive advocate for the homeless.
   The Mitch Snyder who apparently ended his life Thursday in his
room at a homeless shelter was a man who struggled with religious
beliefs and was tormented by his abandonment of his young sons two
decades ago.
   Snyder once described himself as dedicated to ``liberating
people who are destitute.'' But his confrontational style drew
criticism, sometimes from other homeless activists.
   When Snyder was on a hunger strike to force the White House to
pay for shelter improvements, Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R.-Fla., called
him ``a masochist who influences government by threatening to
starve himself.''
   Raised in New York City, Snyder married young and had two sons.
But after a series of unsuccessful jobs, he walked out on his
family in 1969 and wound up in the federal prison in Danbury,
Conn., for auto theft.
   There he met the radical priests Daniel and Philip Berrigan and
joined their anti-war group. Out of prison in 1972, he moved to
Washington the following year, launching his career as an activist
with the Community for Creative Non-Violence but cutting off all
contact with his family.
   Snyder, who was himself abandoned by his father when he was 9,
was apparently haunted the rest of his life by the family he failed
to support.
   His ex-wife Ellen Daly, who remarried, only got in touch with
Snyder again by telephone after he became famous.
   ``I said to him on the phone, `Mitchell, forgive yourself. I
forgave you a long time ago,' '' she recalled in an interview in
The Washington Post. ``He said no _ that's his punishment to
himself. He said, `Till the day I die, I'll never forgive myself.'
''
   He later visited his ex-wife, and his sons Ricky and Dean both
visited Snyder at the shelter, on one occasion helping serve
Thanksgiving dinner to the homeless.
   Snyder's longtime companion, Carol Fennelly, told the Post he
``would wake up at night having dreams about his deserted kids. ...
It would just prey on him.''
   Two months ago, Fennelly was quoted as saying that she and
Snyder were planning to be married in September, in a ceremony to
be held in front of the community's 1,400-bed shelter.
   Snyder and the Community for Creative Non-Violence jumped to
national prominence with his 1984 hunger strike that forced
President Reagan, at the peak of his re-election campaign, to
promise a run-down federal building for a homeless shelter in
downtown Washington, along with funds for renovation.
   The episode was the focus of the made-for-TV movie ``Samaritan:
The Mitch Snyder Story,'' starring Martin Sheen, who referred to
Snyder as a ``saint.'' The film scarcely mentioned Snyder's
previous life in New York.
   Snyder drew increasingly harsh criticism in recent years for his
abrasive style, especially when he opposed the Census Bureau's
effort this spring to count homeless people for the first time.
   He refused to let Census enumerators into his Capitol Hill
shelter, saying, ``These people should be allowed to have their
dignity and not be disturbed in the middle of the night to
accommodate government grandstanding.''
   Snyder recognized that he would win no popularity contests _
even among his friends.
   ``I don't consider myself a good person,'' he told the Post. ``I
tend to be impatient, I tend to be very short, I tend to make heavy
demands on people. I don't have time or energy to give much
one-on-one, and so I'm very hard on people around me. I take much
more than I give.''
   In March, Snyder announced that he was taking some time off to
live in a Trappist monastery in Virginia.
   ``I'm a religious person, and from time to time it's important
to renew our relationship with God,'' Snyder told colleagues. He
said he wanted to take time for reflection, ``to do simple work
like baking bread.''
   After President Bush's election in 1988, Snyder proclaimed
himself optimistic about the years to come.
   ``I honestly believe George Bush is a nicer person. I believe
Ronald Reagan was nice personally, but his politics were
mean-spirited,'' Snyder said in a 1989 interview with The
Associated Press.
   ``Listen to the music of Tracy Chapman, of U2. They are
harbingers of a shift in mood. There's a 30-year cycle: the '30s,
the '60s, the '90s. We've just come through the `Me Decade.' I
think people have gotten sick of living only for themselves.''

   A lone male forced a Soviet airliner
carrying 178 people to land in Stockholm on Thursday and
surrendered, airport police said. A woman threatened to blow up
another Soviet plane unless it was diverted to Turkey.
   The incidents were among a rash of hijackings or attempted
takeovers of Soviet passenger planes in the past month.
   The 19-year-old man, whose identity could not yet be disclosed,
hijacked the plane to Sweden because he was unwilling to serve in
the Soviet army, police spokesman Henry Hedenstrom said.
   The hijacker told crew members he had an ``explosive'' in his
luggage, police said. The hijacker, who gave himself up within an
hour after the aircraft landed, handed police a brown briefcase. It
contained no explosive charge or weapon, airport spokeswoman Malin
Engstedt said.
   Also Thursday, a Soviet newspaper reported that a woman
traveling with her 2-year-old daughter threatened to blow up a
Soviet airplane unless it was diverted to Istanbul, Turkey.
   Crew members negotiated with the woman while the pilot landed
the Tupolev-134 jet in the southern city of Rostov late Wednesday,
the official Communist Party newspaper Pravda said.
   The parcel which the woman claimed contained a bomb was found to
be empty, it said. The woman, a shop assistant, was arrested by
security forces at the airport.
   Pravda said the flight, carrying 24 passengers, originated in
Sochi on the Black Sea, about 250 miles south of Rostov.
Authorities said no one was injured.
   The flight diverted to Stockholm was a domestic Aeroflot
Tupolev-154. It originated in Leningrad and was destined for Lvov
in the Ukraine, according to airport authorities.
   Passengers and the seven-member crew were permitted to leave the
aircraft three hours after landing, Hedenstrom said.
   It was the fifth hijacking of a Soviet airliner to Sweden or
Finland since June 9. All four previous hijackings were carried out
single-handedly by young men who threatened to blow up the
aircraft, but later surrendered peacefully. None of the hijackers
were armed.
   ``This is becoming fairly routine, although it's always a
disturbance to regular traffic,'' Engstedt said.
   In the two previous hijackings to Finland, the two hijackers
requested political asylum. Finland is considering one of the
requests but has rejected the request made by hijacker Oleg Kozlov,
20.
   Kozlov went on a hunger strike and barricaded himself in his
cell Tuesday in a central Helsinki prison. Finnish prison officials
said they were attempting to negotiate with Kozlov, who has
threatened to kill himself if guards break into the cell.
   Swedish police are holding two other hijack suspects. One said
he hijacked an aircraft to avoid Soviet military service. The other
said he acted after a family dispute. The Soviet Union has asked
Sweden to extradite the hijackers, something the Swedish pilots
federation also advocates. No decision has yet been taken by the
Swedish government.

<HEAD>Air France Ground Personnel Strike as Controllers Return to Tower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air traffic controllers ended a three-day strike
late Thursday, but Air France ground personnel announced they would
stage a 36-hour work stoppage this weekend.
   The strike beginning Friday by ground personnel was expected to
slow recovery from the controllers' stoppage, which drastically cut
the number of flights in and out of Paris. Many people had delayed
their travel until the weekend.
   The controllers returned to work at midnight Thursday.
   However, as a result of the new strike, Air France said it was
canceling half its flights Friday and Saturday morning from Charles
de Gaulle Airport's second terminal, reserved for the national
carrier.
   Ground personnel there said they were striking to protest staff
shortages and press demands for higher salaries and revisions in
job qualifications.
   The strike was also expected to affect other airlines which use
Air France services at the second terminal, including Alitalia
Airlines, Austrian Airlines and several Eastern European carriers.
   Air traffic controllers at Athis-Moni, France's largest flight
control center, walked off the job Tuesday, complaining they were
overworked and underpaid.
   That strike cut domestic and medium-haul flights by about 60
percent and forced cancellation of most charters. Several foreign
airlines either canceled flights into the French capital, cut them
drastically or rerouted passengers via Brussels.
   The strike also caused a slight disruption in the travel plans
of Secretary of State James A. Baker III who was traveling
Wednesday from Brussels, Belgium to London for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization summit.
   The plane carrying Baker was refused permission to land at
London's Heathrow Airport because of congestion caused by the
French air controllers' strike, authorities said Thursday.
   Instead, the military aircraft landed at a U.S. Air Force base
at Mildenhall in eastern England, the Civil Aviation Authority said.
   U.S. State Department officials called it ``nothing more than a
minor inconvenience.''

   Homeless advocate Mitch Snyder, who brought
himself to the edge of death in many fasts to promote his cause,
was found hanged Thursday at a homeless shelter with a note near
his body.
   Police issued a statement calling the death ``an apparent
suicide by hanging.'' Spokesman Reginald Smith said a note
containing ``suicidal references'' was found near Snyder's body.
   Police sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
suicide note indicated Snyder was despondent over problems in his
personal life.
   ``It was a domestic situation, something to do with his
girlfriend,'' one source said. ``The note indicates there were
problems there.''
   The sources said a second note was found in Snyder's room, one
written during the spring.
   ``It was along the same lines'' as the note found Thursday, one
police source said. ``It talked about this possibility, sort of
outlined what he might do.''
   ``We are greatly saddened by our loss,'' said Carol Fennelly,
Snyder's companion of 15 years and his partner in running the
shelter. Fennelly said last spring that the couple planned to marry
in September.
   Fennelly did not return telephone calls for comment on the note.
   Public Health Commissioner George Hamilton said an autopsy would
be done Thursday night to determine the cause of death.
   Snyder, 46, was one of the nation's best-known advocates for the
homeless. He was a model for a movie dramatizing his 1984 hunger
strike for federal funds to house the homeless.
   ``What a shock, what a loss,'' said D.C. City Councilwoman
Nadine Winter. ``What a loss to people all over the United States.''
   Robert Hayes, chairman of the Coalition for the Homeless in New
York and founder of the national Coalition for the Homeless, called
Snyder ``a great ally.''
   ``Mitch was driven, he was no moderate on anything,'' Hayes
said. ``He created, almost single-handedly, a movement. It's just a
great loss.''
   Snyder, who had beaten the federal government in numerous
confrontations over the years, lost a battle with the city
government on June 26 when a city law guaranteeing overnight
shelter to everyone was scaled back because of budget pressures.
   ``I think that's what did it, I really do,'' said Bill Draughn,
a shelter resident. ``It was a slap in his face.''
   But Winter said Snyder was not especially despondent after the
vote. ``He was tough,'' she said. ``We had talked about where we go
from here.''
   Shelter resident George Gilchrist said Snyder was under pressure
from drug problems that had developed in the past year at the
1,400-bed shelter, a gray, three-story building several blocks from
the U.S. Capitol.
   ``The man tried as best he could to help us out,'' he said of
Snyder. ``It's hard to stop something like crack.''
   Rep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, which handles legislation on homeless issues, said
Snyder's ``zeal sometimes led him to extreme despondency at the
seeming futility of the street people's struggle.''
   ``Mitch Snyder was a rare blend of a man of action and an almost
ethereal being,'' said Gonzalez.
   ``He was an untiring advocate for those least able to speak for
themselves,'' said Mayor Marion Barry in a statement released by
his office.
   Fennelly said the Community for Creative Non-Violence, which
runs the huge shelter, was ``in mourning.''
   But she said that ``we are more committed now than ever to
continue our struggle to advocate for homeless human beings and to
continue our fight for overnight shelter and affordable housing.''
   Snyder's abrasive manner and extreme tactics _ including
frequent dramatic hunger strikes and a sleepout on grates outside
the Capitol _ won him allies ranging from politicians to Hollywood
stars. Among them was Martin Sheen, who played him in the
made-for-TV movie ``Samaritan: The Mitch Snyder Story.''
   But his confrontational personality and approach also made him a
controversial figure, even within his own organization.
   One source close to CCNV, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said ``there has been a lot of dissension within the group lately.''
   Snyder was criticized last spring by other homeless advocates
for trying to thwart the Census Bureau's attempt to count homeless
people for the first time.
   Snyder refused to let Census enumerators into the CCNV shelter,
saying, ``These people should be allowed to have their dignity and
not be disturbed in the middle of the night to accommodate
government grandstanding.''
   Snyder announced in March that he was taking some time off to
live in a Trappist monastery in Virginia.
   ``I'm a religious person, and from time to time it's important
to renew our relationship with God,'' Snyder told CCNV members. He
said he wanted to take time for reflection, ``to do simple work
like baking bread.''
   Snyder grew up in New York City, and remembered cruising up the
Bowery as a boy, his father ordering the car windows tightly closed
``to keep out the bums.''
   He married and had two sons, working as a washing machine
salesman, vacuum cleaner salesman and job counselor before quitting
and walking out on his family in 1969.
   He wound up in federal prison on an auto-theft charge. While
serving time at Danbury, Conn., he got to know the radical priests
Daniel and Philip Berrigan, who were in prison for destroying draft
records.
   After leaving prison, Snyder joined an anti-war group in New
York. He moved to Washington in 1973, where he found that
``homelessness became the domestic counterpart to what was
happening in Southeast Asia.''
   Snyder said in a 1989 interview with The Associated Press that
the most important influences in his life were three uplifting
Hollywood films: ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' and ``A Christmas Carol.''
   ``They taught me the lessons of my life: that good will always
overcome evil, and that the most insignificant person can make a
difference, provided what he's doing is right.''

<HEAD>Suspected Red Army Faction Member Returned to West Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A suspected member of the Red
Army Faction terrorist group who was captured in East Germany was
turned over to West German authorities Thursday, the federal
prosecutor's office said.
   Susanne Albrecht was brought to a border crossing between East
Germany and West Germany early Thursday, said Hans-Juergen
Foerster, a spokesman at the West German federal prosecutor's
office.
   Ms. Albrecht's lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, said she had declared
herself willing to return to West Germany ``because this is for her
the best solution in every respect,'' East Germany's ADN news
agency said.
   Vogel is the East German lawyer who worked closely with the
former Communist government in arranging several famous spy swaps.
   In an interview with the Bild newspaper on Thursday, Vogel was
quoted as saying Ms. Albrecht had left the Red Army Faction and
started a new life in East Germany since moving there in 1979.
   The 39-year-old Ms. Albrecht, wanted in the 1977 shooting death
of a top West German banker, was arrested June 6 outside her
apartment in East Berlin by East German authorities.
   She was among eight other suspected Red Army Faction terrorists
arrested by East German authorities in a two-week sweep last month.
One of them was later released because the warrant for her arrest
had expired.
   Foerster said Ms. Albrecht would be brought ``at the soonest
possible time'' before a federal judge to have charges read against
her.
   The arrest of Ms. Albrecht created a stir after East German
Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel said she had told police
that former East German secret police had set her up with a new
identity. She said she was informed that the East German government
disapproved of the group's methods but agreed with its
anti-imperialist objectives, Diestel said.
   The Red Army Faction waged a terrorist campaign targeting
financial institutions and NATO establishments in the 1970s and
1980s. The most recent victim, Deutsche Bank chief Alfred
Herrhausen, was killed in bomb attack last November.
   Ms. Albrecht is accused in the 1977 slaying of Dresdner Bank
President Juergen Ponto outside Frankfurt. She faces life in prison
if convicted.
   West Germany has a standing request with East Germany that the
other seven suspected terrorists also be returned to face charges.

<BYLINE>Gorbachev Appeals For Western Aid In Letter To Thatcher
^By MAUREEN JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed for
economic aid from Western leaders in a letter to British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher at the NATO summit, British sources said
Thursday.
   The two-page letter appeared to contain the first direct
reference from the Soviet leader for Western aid to help rescue his
beleaguered economic reform program.
   British sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told The
Associated Press that Gorbachev made no mention of figures.
   But he said he was looking for ``positive conclusions'' on the
security structure of the new Europe at the two-day NATO summit in
London, which opened Thursday, and on aid from a summit next week
in Houston, Texas, of the world's top seven industrialized nations.
   ``The message was essentially that he hoped that the summits
would come up with the results that would support the reform
program,'' said the British source.
   Mrs. Thatcher announced at the summit opening Thursday morning
that she had received letters from Gorbachev and from President
Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia within the previous 24 hours. She
gave no details but said both leaders were ``as interested in the
result of this summit as we are here.''
   Gorbachev, British sources said, indicated he was well pleased
with the decision by European Community leaders meeting in Dublin,
Ireland, late last month to agree in principle to aid the Soviet
Union.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Francois
Mitterrand tried in Dublin to persuade the other leaders of the
12-nation trading bloc to give an immediate $15 billion in aid to
Moscow.
   Mrs. Thatcher played a leading role in getting that proposal
rejected on ground the money would be wasted unless the community
had a clear idea of Soviet needs. Instead the community leaders
agreed to order an investigation into the best ways of helping
Gorbachev. They will consider the matter again in the fall.
   Britain, France, West Germany and Italy, the four European
Community leaders who will be at the Houston summit, also plan to
raise the aid issue there with the leaders of the United States,
Japan and Canada.
   British sources said Gorbachev indicated in his letter to Mrs.
Thatcher that he was well-pleased with the outcome of the Dublin
summit and said he was ``grateful'' to her ``for getting a positive
outcome.''
   ``The thrust of the letter was he was very grateful for what
came out of Dublin and for the assessment of what was required,''
said the British source.

Alyssa Park, a 16-year-old high school student from Lexington, Ky.,
took third place, said Margarita Trubitfina, a spokeswoman for the
competition.
   In addition to taking the first place gold medal, Miss Suwanai,
18, of Tokyo, also received a medal for best performance of the
competition, the spokeswoman said.
   Miss Suwanai had won second prize at the Japan International
Competition in Tokyo in 1989 and second prize at the Paganini
International Competition in Italy in 1988.
   Miss Park received three medals in all: for third place, for
most talented performer and for most artistic performer.
   ``I was very honored, but also very puzzled,'' she said in an
interview afterward, noting that the international jury awarded her
the medals for most artistic and most talented, but then only gave
her third place.
   She admitted to feeling some tension, ``but I just tried to
treat it as a concert, and play.''
   Anton Barakhovksy and Natalia Likhopoiy, both of the Soviet
Union, tied for fourth; David Chan of Del Ray, Calif. finished
fifth; Dmitri Berlinsky of the Soviet Union and Lucia Lin of Boston
tied for sixth; and Maria Bachmann of Paramus, N.J. finished
seventh.
   Musicians competed in violin and piano, and for the first time
since the event was first organized in 1958, voice and cello.
   The winners in piano, voice and cello were to be announced later
Friday.
   Ten Americans were among the 48 finalists who gave final
performances Thursday.
   ``This is the Super Bowl of musical competition,'' said Daniel
Pollack, a competitor in the first competition 32 years ago and now
one of the judges.
   If the most recent Tchaikovsky competition in 1986 was any
indication, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev could be expected to
break off his labors at the 28th Congress of the Soviet Communist
Party in the Kremlin and attend a weekend concert by the winners.
   ``I am very excited, they told me I am a candidate for first
prize,'' said Hans Choi, 31, a South Korean-born singer who lives
in New York City.
   This year, for the first time, not only are the contestants and
judges international, but the funding as well. The hard-pressed
Soviet hosts turned to Pioneer Electronics of Japan to contribute a
$4,000 stereo system to the winner in each of the four categories.
   Each winner also receives a gold medal and 5,000 rubles, a
non-convertible currency that cannot be taken from the Soviet Union.
   The competition, which began June 14, drew 335 competitors from
51 countries, organizers said.
   Deborah Voigt, 29, a singer who grew up in Southern California
and lives in New York City, said that winning the Tchaikovsky
competition automatically boosts a muscian's career.
   She said Soviet audiences were a treat.
   ``I am a bit overwhelmed. The audience response has been
unbelievable,'' she said. ``I used to think Italians were the best
audiences, but now I think Russians make the best audience by far.''
   Ms. Lin, a 28-year-old violinist who plays with the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, said she came to Moscow because of the
competition's reputation.
   ``It's a lot of work _ stressful and grueling _ but I'm glad I
came,'' she said.
   The Tchaikovsky competition is organized every four years by the
Ministry of Culture, Union of Composers and the All-Union Music
Society.

   Authorities in Yugoslavia's largest
republic Thursday dissolved the local legislature and government in
Kosovo, the troubled southern province it administers, sources and
the media said.
   Authorities from the republic of Serbia also took measures
apparently designed to give the republic full control over Kosovo's
media.
   Several leading ethnic Albanian officials and journalists were
removed from their jobs at Kosovo's radio, television and the
Albanian-language Rilindia publishing house, which publishes a
daily newspaper.
   Witnesses said Serbia's police entered downtown television,
radio and Rilindia premises in the provincial capital of Pristina,
arresting an unspecified number of ethnic Albanian employees.
   The state Tanjug news agency reported that TV and radio later
went off the air.
   The Serbian moves could trigger fresh unrest by the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo, the nation's least developed region
and the scene of sporadic violence over the past two years.
   The decision to disolve Kosovo's legislature and government was
approved unanimously by all three chambers of Serbia's parliament.
It came in the wake of a declaration Monday by 114 ethnic Albanian
deputies in Kosovo's provincial assembly to secede from Serbia,
Belgrade television said.
   In the document, Kosovo proclaimed the province of 1.9 million
equal to Yugoslavia's six republics and stated that ethnic
Albanians, the third-largest ethnic group in the country, would no
longer be considered a national minority.
   Yugoslavia is a loose federation of six republics and two
nominally autonomous provinces. Kosovo, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian, has progressively lost control of its affairs to Serbia.
   ``Kosovo's assembly has for a long time acted against the
interests of the people of Serbia,'' Belgrade radio quoted a
Serbian parliamentary statement that explained the new legislation
as saying.
   The decision to disband Kosovo's 188-member legislature and
local government, headed by Premier Jusuf Zeinulahu, was read
during Thursday's assembly session, said sources in the provincial
capital of Pristina.
   The Serbian law stipulated that all elected and other officials
in the provincial government were suspended. Any legislation passed
by the Kosovo assembly after Thursday will be considered illegal,
the TV report said.
   Serbia's parliament also urged federal authorities to replace
Riza Sapunxhiu, an ethnic Albanian, who represents Kosovo in
Yugoslavia's eight-member collective presidency and has supported
appeals for autonomy.
   About 60 ethnic Albanians have died in clashes with security
forces since March 1989 when, in a constitutional amendment, Serbia
severely limited the wide-ranging autonomy Kosovo enjoyed under the
1974 charter.
   Pristina, however, was reported calm following the Serbian
action. No members of the security forces were visible on city
streets.
   A delegation of deputies left Pristina for Belgrade to meet with
Stipe Suvar, a member of the federal presidency, in an apparent
effort to secure federal support in their showdown with Serbian
authorities, the TV report said.
   Serbs, who consider Kosovo the cradle of their medieval kingdom,
have alleged that ethnic Albanians were pressuring the remaining
Slavs to move out of the province.
   Ethnic Albanians, who want free elections and a multiparty
system, deny this and say the issue has been used by the republic's
Communist leader Slobodan Milosevic to gain popular support for his
hard-line policies.
   Serbia's Communist leadership has proposed adopting a new state
constitution that would effectively remove any vestiges of
self-government currently enjoyed by its southern province.
   The elimination of Kosovo's parliament under a new constitution
would make ethnic Albanians a small minority in the Serbian
legislature.
   ``The decision to dissolve the regional parliament is an illegal
one and the Albanian people will not recognize it,'' said Ibrahim
Rugova, leader of the Democratic Forum, an ethnic Albanian
organization that claims a membership of over 500,000.
   ``Serbia currently does not have any constitutional right to do
such a thing,'' he said, adding that the Forum would urge ethnic
Albanians to remain calm ``in the face of this provocation.''

<TEXT>
   The ship that caused the nation's worst oil
spill when it ran aground in Alaskan waters last year will be
returned to service later this summer, officials said Thursday.
   Repair work on the Exxon Valdez is nearing completion and Exxon
Shipping Co. President Gus Elmer is expected Friday to announce
plans for returning the supertanker to service.
   A Coast Guard inspector, however, said the ship is scheduled to
start a two-week trial run July 20 to test its systems and obtain
certification as a seaworthy vessel.
   The ship spilled almost 11 million gallons of crude oil when it
struck a reef in Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989,
sullying hundreds of miles of coastline and killing scores of birds
and animals.
   Former Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi has
acknowledged, at least implicitly, that the ship's association with
the environmental disaster may make it unwelcome in Alaskan ports.
He said last summer that the tanker might be renamed and possibly
put to work somewhere besides the Pacific Ocean.
   Since then, however, Exxon officials have kept secret where the
vessel will sail once it is repaired and whether it will bear the
Valdez name.
   Exxon spokeswoman Janet Cool said Elmer would answer those
questions Friday. She said the ship would return to service this
summer, but probably not this month.
   ``I don't think it will be sailing before August,'' she said.
   Fred Hallett, a spokesman for National Steel and Shipbuilding
Co., where the ship was built in 1986, said the $30 million repair
job on the tanker is nearly complete.
   ``The ship's ready. She's going smoothly,'' Hallett said.
``We're finishing the painting on it right now and we're doing some
work in the machinery room.''
   The 987-foot-long ship will be floated out of the dry dock later
this month for a trial run to determine if NASSCO will need to make
any refinements, Hallett said.
   Lt. Bill Uberti, a Coast Guard inspector, said NASSCO is
scheduled to flood its dry dock July 20 and take the Valdez out for
two weeks of trial runs. Uberti said he will be aboard the ship
part of that time to certify it as seaworthy.
   ``They'll test all the systems out and we'll ride her a couple
of days and that will be it,'' Uberti said.
   ``If there's a problem, they'll have to fix it before it can go
out into service, but I don't anticipate any problems,'' he said.
``The only damage to the ship was structurally, and that's all been
fixed.''
   Repairs on the Valdez began last August after the 30,000-ton
ship was maneuvered into a graving dock, which had less than two
feet of clearance on each side.
   The tanker was placed on supports and hydraulic shorings while
workers tore out the mangled steel of the single-hulled ship and
replaced it with 3,000 tons of new, inch-thick steel.
   A couple of boulders that lodged in the tanker when it ran
aground were removed and after being examined by parties in the
spill litigation, were released to Exxon. The company sent the
rocks, one of which was the size of small car, to a construction
site where they were ground up.
   Exxon officials declined to retrofit the ship with a double hull
because it was not feasible from an engineering standpoint, Exxon
spokeswoman Carrie Chasin said in March.
   But Hallett said a double hull could have been put on the ship
during the repair work.
   ``It's feasible to put a double hull,'' he said. ``The question
is the cost and the time.''
   In January, Exxon Shipping Co. paid a $1,000 fine to settle a
pollution claim by the Coast Guard. The dispute arose from a pair
of slicks and the spillage of about 356 gallons of oil as the ship
awaited clearance to enter San Diego Bay.

<HEAD>American Collector Pays $15.1 Million for Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American collector paid $15.1 million Thursday
for an 18th century Italian cabinet, and autioneers said it was the
highest auction price ever paid for a piece of furniture or for an
artwork other than a painting.
   Barbara Piasecka-Johnson, wife of the late Johnson and Johnson
pharmaceuticals heir J. Seward Johnson, was in the front row at
Christie's auction house and bid for the cabinet, an extraordinary
baroque work decorated in gilt, bronze, ebony and pietra dura _
marble inlays of birds and flowers.
   ``The price beat the previous highest price for furniture and is
the most expensive work of art ever sold at auction, apart from
paintings,'' said William Hanham, Christie's spokesman.
   The cabinet, 12{ feet tall and 7{ feet wide, was sold by the
11th Duke of Beaufort to pay inheritance taxes on the estate of his
father and to pay for repairs to the mansion at Badminton, his
country estate in southwest England.
   The cabinet had been at Badminton since 1732, the year it was
shipped to England from Italy. It was commissioned in Florence
about 1725.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Western allies are offering
soothing reassurances, and considering a massive financial bailout,
to brace Mikhail S. Gorbachev against an uncertain future. It's a
big gamble on a Soviet leader who gives himself only two more years
to succeed or fail.
   Gorbachev dramatically raised the stakes for himself _ and the
West _ when he imposed a deadline for fixing his country's economic
and political problems.
   ``I think that in two years, if there are no changes, this
leadership must go,'' Gorbachev declared Wednesday.
   British sources said late Thursday Gorbachev had appealed for
Western economic aid in a two-page letter to Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the request was not specific, but expressed his hopes for
``positive conclusions'' at both the NATO summit and the economic
summit in Houston next week which would enhance European security
and bolster his economic reform program.
   Gorbachev needs a shot of Western cash for a variety of reasons,
including a balance-of-payments deficit topping $2 billion _ half
of that owed to West German companies and creditors _ and to put a
greater variety of foodstuffs and consumer items in Soviet stores
at a time of rising domestic tensions.
   For Bush and his colleagues, Gorbachev's message was clear: If
you're going to help, do it now. Later might be too late.
   Western leaders are fully aware that any successor to Gorbachev
might not be as tolerant of democratic and economic changes in the
Soviet Union and East Europe as he has been.
   Gorbachev made his statement as leaders of 16 Western nations
were gathering here for a NATO summit. Money for Moscow was not on
the official agenda for the talks and there probably won't be any
decision on it here. A decision is more likely when leaders of the
world's seven richest nations meet in Houston next week for the
annual economic summit of industrial powers.
   However, financial aid for the Soviet Union was sure to be an
underlying issue as NATO chiefs met behind closed doors in London.
   West Germany and France are urging the West to come up with $15
billion or more for Moscow. Bush has been cool to the idea but
appears to be softening his objections. At the least, U.S.
officials say the president will not stand in the way of a Western
European package of assistance.
   Publicly, NATO chiefs went out of their way to persuade
Gorbachev and his conservative critics that Moscow has nothing to
fear from the West as the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact teeters on
collapse.
   ``Confrontation and the Cold War belong to the past,'' declared
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Echoing earlier proposals by Bush, Kohl said NATO and the Warsaw
Pact should agree on a joint statement ``that we no longer regard
one another as adversaries'' and that they renounce the use force.
   French President Francois Mitterrand advocated ``a solemn
declaration renouncing aggression or first use of force.''
   Bush took the extraordinary step of urging NATO to throw open
its doors for a visit from Gorbachev, reaching out to the leader of
the West's longtime adversary. Gorbachev and other officials of the
Warsaw Pact would be invited to address a NATO meeting, probably in
December.
   ``There was no negative response to the proposal,'' said Dutch
Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers.
   One major purpose of the London meeting is to ease Soviet
concerns about the thundering drive to German unification. The
Kremlin is looking for reassurances that the new Germany's armed
forces would be limited in some way.
   As a result, Kohl and West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher were working on a plan for negotiations to deal with the
issue promptly.
   The Bush administration has resisted West German efforts to put
the German military issue ahead of a treaty now in the works to
reduce U.S. and Soviet troops only. But U.S. diplomatic sources
said the treaty is likely to have a footnote calling for
negotiations on German forces promptly after the U.S.-Soviet troop
issue is wrapped up.
   Early in his administration, Bush struck a cautious approach
toward Gorbachev, unsure how far the United States should go in
backing him. After months of deliberation, Bush finally decided
that Gorbachev was the West's best hope for promoting democracy and
economic reforms.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, commenting on
Gorbachev's newly prescribed deadline, said, ``We hope he can be
successful in less than two years.''
   So far, that wish for success has not translated into U.S. bucks
for Moscow.

<HEAD>Third Witness Claims to Have Used Drugs With Mayor</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Inserts 3 grafs of FBI testimony after 11th graf, The witness</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   A business partner of ex-model Rasheeda Moore
testified Thursday that she shared cocaine with Marion Barry at a
1986 party and she was ``absolutely positive'' the mayor snorted
the drug through a straw.
   Carole Bland Jackson was the third witness in Barry's drug and
perjury trial who has claimed to have seen Barry using drugs.
Jackson said she, Moore and Barry and another man used cocaine
powder in the bathroom of a Washington apartment after a
city-sponsored cruise on the Potomac River.
   ``The mayor and Rasheeda were sitting on the side of the bathtub
and ... cocaine was visible,'' Jackson said. ``I snorted first,
then Rasheeda took it, then the other gentleman and Mayor Barry.''
   Jackson said she later left after ``the mayor came out and made
sexual advances towards me which I declined.''
   Moore, who cooperated in the government sting against Barry,
testified last week that she and Barry used drugs together more
than 100 times. Convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis has also
testified he used drugs with the mayor.
   Meanwhile, a federal appeals court refused on Thursday to order
that two black leaders be allowed to attend the Barry trial. Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson barred Nation of Islam leader Louis
Farrakhan and an excommunicated priest last week, saying their
presence could be ``disruptive and very likely intimidating.''
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged
drug use.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin asked Carole Jackson if
she was sure the mayor has used cocaine after the 1986 river cruise.
   ``Absolutely positive,'' said Jackson.
   Jackson also said she used drugs in Barry's presence on another
occasion in 1986, but that she did not see Barry snorting cocaine
then. She said Barry was then in a bathroom where cocaine was
present, holding his hand to his nose, and ``sitting there
sniffing.''
   The witness and Moore worked together on Project Me, a modeling
program Barry asked Moore to set up to teach self-esteem to teenage
girls. Moore testified the $180,000 project won speedy approval
``because the mayor told me it would.''
   An FBI evidence technician also testified that she removed a
``small, white piece of rock-like substance'' from the sport coat
Barry was wearing the night he was arrested at a Washington hotel.
   Moore has testified that just moments before federal agents
burst into the hotel room and arrested the mayor, he had placed a
small pellet of crack cocaine in his jacket.
   Dr. Thomas Lynch, who conducts cocaine tests for the FBI,
testified that a crack cocaine pipe Barry was videotaped smoking
from contained ``a lot'' of cocaine.
   Prosecutors also showed jurors a videotape of a September 1986
press conference in which Barry, seen on the tape of his Jan. 18
arrest calling the operation ``a setup,'' defending the use of
undercover stings.
   ``I have no sympathy for those who are crybabies about the fact
that we have police officers selling to those who want to buy
drugs,'' Barry told reporters in 1986. ``We want everybody to know
that the next drug buy may be from a police officer.''
   Retchin said the statements showed Barry knew such tactics were
used, so Barry cannot complain he was improperly tricked into
buying crack cocaine from an undercover FBI agent when he was
arrested.
   Judge Jackson, meantime, set a hearing for Friday on arguments
by Farrakhan and Bishop George Augustus Stallings that they be
allowed to attend the trial at Barry's invitation.
   The appeals court rejected Barry's arguments that barring
Farrakhan and Bishop George Augustus Stallings, a breakaway Roman
Catholic priest, from the courtroom denied him a fair and public
trial. The court said Barry could only make that claim on appeal if
he is convicted and it sent the matter back to Judge Jackson for
further consideration.
   The judge refused Farrakhan and Stallings admission last week,
after the three-term mayor appeared in public with them as they
condemned the prosecution of Barry, who is black, as
racially-motivated.

<HEAD>Regulators Seek Recovery of $24 Million From California Thrift</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulators on Thursday sought a record $24
million from the former chairman of a large California thrift
institution accused of squandering deposits on luxury condominiums,
trips to Europe and a gun collection.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said it was seeking $19 million
in restitution and $5 million in penalties from Thomas Spiegel, the
former chairman of Columbia Savings and Loan Association in Beverly
Hills, Calif.
   Spiegel, a close associate of former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk
bond chief Michael Milken, built the institution into one of the
nation's largest thrifts. It had the industry's largest portfolio
of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds, valued at $3.7 billion at the
end of 1989.
   Spiegel denied the charges and accused the agency of conducting
a politically-motivated ``trial by press release.''
   Meanwhile, Edward Harshfield, Columbia's current chief
executive, said in a statement that the institution's current
management cooperated with the thrift office and said the
allegations do not reflect on current management or the institution
as a whole.
   Columbia is still operating, but analysts predict junk bond
losses will eventually force government seizure.
   The $19 million in restitution, if recovered, would go to the
thrift, while the $5 million penalty would go to the U.S. Treasury.
   Regulators ordered Spiegel to establish an escrow account or
provide other security guaranteeing payment if their allegations
are upheld.
   They are seeking return of $2.9 million for an unauthorized
bonus, $463,000 for improper personal expenses, $6.4 million for
corporate aircraft and a luxury hangar, $1.1 million for luxury
condominiums in resort areas, $5.7 million for loans to a friend
and the use of luxury cars, and $2.4 million for unauthorized
payments to a charitable foundation Spiegel controlled.
   The personal expenses include $7,000 spent on tickets for a
Michael Jackson concert, $2,000 on a wine-tasting course for
Spiegel and his wife, and $55,000 for a gun collection that
included Uzi submachine guns, the thrift office said.
   It said Columbia lost $5.7 million on $28 million in loans to
luxury auto dealer Howard Schneider, who allowed Spiegel to use
several of his cars. It also said Spiegel used the thrift's
condominiums in Jackson Hole, Wyo.; Indian Wells, Calif., and Park
City, Utah, and that Milken's brother, Lowell, frequently used the
Jackson Hole condo.
   The corporate jets and hangar were built in a partnership with
Michael Milken, who often used the aircraft for his personal use,
regulators said.
   Thrift office Director Timothy Ryan, who took office three
months ago vowing to crack down on S&amp;L fraud, said it was the
biggest restitution case yet brought by his 11-month-old agency.
   ``This is a landmark action ... in more than sheer magnitude,''
he said. ``It exemplifies just how seriously we intend to pursue
violations of fiduciary responsibility to protect the taxpayer.''
   Spiegel, who stepped down in December, issued a statement
complaining that the thrift office had refused to meet with his
attorneys or give him a fair chance to respond to the allegations.
   ``In a panic, for purely political reasons, (the thrift office)
is seeking scapegoats to divert public attention from its gross
incompetence,'' the statement said.
   No charges were announced against Milken, but the thrift office
said it would continue to investigate links between his junk bond
operation and Columbia and other thrifts.

<HEAD>Belly Dancers Protest Religious Ruling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM RON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dozen belly dancers marched in protest
Thursday in the southern town of Ashdod, charging that local rabbis
were skirting the law in an effort to put a halt to the dancers'
undulations.
   The dancers say the rabbis, prevented by a Supreme Court ruling
from banning their performances as immoral, have resorted to
threats against owners of clubs and catering halls if the women are
hired.
   One belly dancer, who calls herself Edna and the Snakes, said
she lost a contract two weeks ago because the owner of one hall was
intimidated by Ashdod's chief rabbis.
   ``He said the Rabbinate was like a mafia and that they would
find some way to take away his kashrut license if I performed
there,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   A kashrut license certifies that food served in an establishment
is kosher, that is, it conforms to Jewish dietary law. The
certification is considered crucial, as most observant Jews will
not eat in non-kosher establishments.
   In Israel, belly dancing is a popular form of entertainment for
special occasions. But it has become part of the battleground
between Israel's secular majority and a religious minority which
wants the Jewish State to observe strict Orthodox law.
   In the past, rabbis routinely threatened to take certificates
away from establishments where belly dancers performed, saying they
violated religious notions of modesty, said lawyer Neta Goldman of
the Association for Civil Rights in Israel.
   But in late May, she obtained a court ruling prohibiting rabbis
from withholding certificates for offences unrelated to food.
   Rabbis now get around the court ruling by threatening to cancel
kosher certificates on trumped-up charges that food is not prepared
according to dietary law, complained Lea Davish, who runs a Middle
Eastern dance school.
   Michael Cohen, the owner of the Mitzpor entertainment hall in
the northern town of Tiberias, said he prohibited belly dancing in
his hall after rabbis made it clear to him he stood to lose
business if he refused.
   ``There was an unspoken understanding,'' he said. ``They would
send more business to us if we stopped the belly dancing. And it
paid off, I tell you.''
   Ashdod's Chief Rabbi Yosef Shinen met with a delegation of belly
dancers in his office Thursday morning, but could not be reached
for comment later.
   In Ashdod, passers-by reacted enthusiastically to the belly
dancers' protest.
   ``If the rabbis don't want to see the dancing, they don't have
to come,'' said Sarit Avraan, 23.

   A federal judge on Thursday rejected a
legal foundation's request that he bar the environmental group
Earth First! from holding its annual meeting in a national forest
in Montana next week.
   Several hundred members of the organization are expected to
begin arriving this weekend for the weeklong Round River Rendezvous
at the Beaverhead National Forest in southwestern Montana.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell rejected arguments by the
Denver-based Mountain States Legal Foundation and 77 other groups
that want to prevent the gathering, including ranchers, loggers,
miners, and off-road vehicle users.
   ``We are incredibly disappointed,'' William Perry Pendley, the
foundation's president and chief legal officer, said in a telephone
interview.
   ``We believe the court must take a group like Earth First! at
its word as to the reason it exists and what it will do to achieve
its objectives,'' Pendley said. ``What Earth First! has said is it
will use violence and terrorism to achieve its objectives to drive
people off the public lands of the West.'
   In oral arguments before Lovell on Tuesday, Pendley said the
Forest Service should not allow Earth First! in the forest because
the organization allegedly advocates sabotage of developers of the
nation's wildlands.
   ``Tree-spiking and the other acts of sabotage allegedly
attributed to Earth First! are serious crimes which ought always to
be vigorously prosecuted,'' Lovell said in his decision.
``Speculation that these crimes might be committed by this group at
this time and in this area is insufficient to justify setting
aside'' the permit.
   Lovell said the Forest Service had a rational and reasonable
basis for issuing the permit, and conducted an adequate
environmental review.
   Pendley said he still believes the Forest Service ``put blinders
on'' when it refused to consider potential impacts of the gathering
beyond the 30-acre site for which it has a permit.
   A planned logging operation is only two miles from the meeting
site and easily accessible for anyone who wanted to spike trees,
Pendley said.
   Beaverhead spokesman Jack De Golia said forest officials were
pleased with Lovell's decision and would have law enforcement
officers in the area during the meeting.
   ``We won't be in (their) camp,' he said. ``Our main purpose is
to keep track of things and make sure trouble doesn't come to the
camp or leave the camp and travel other places.''
   Pendley told the judge on Tuesday that Earth First! encourages
tree-spiking, the spiking of motorcycle trails, harassment of
survey crews, destruction of logging equipment and other acts of
sabotage.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bernie Hubley, representing the Forest
Service, disagreed.
   ``The history of Earth First! has been one of civil disobedience
away from the forest,'' he said. ``This group does not have a
documented history of doing these types of activities in the
forest.''

   A panicked white motorist on
Thursday drove into a crowd of black protesters, killing four, and
was then killed by a mob, police said.
   The incident began when demonstrators, angered by bus fare
increases, ordered hundreds of passengers to get off dozens of
buses at a depot in the black homeland of KwaNdebele, northeast of
Pretoria.
   Two buses were set afire and several were stoned, while the
passengers gathered on and alongside the road, police said.
   A white motorist approaching the scene apparently feared for his
safety and tried to plow through the crowd, said Brig. Hannes
Prinsloo of the KwaNdebele police.
   Four blacks were killed and several more injured. The driver,
identified as A.C. Malan, was then assaulted and killed by a mob,
and his car set afire, Prinsloo said.

   Shaded by the Civic Center Plaza's olive
trees, Jack Howard lay on a bed piled with heavy blankets while a
2-month-old kitten nuzzled her chin.
   The 30-year-old homeless woman expects to be in the same spot
when police begin an expected crackdown on people living in the
government center.
   ``I've lived in Civic Center 8{ months. I lost my home in the
(October) earthquake,'' she said. ``I'm not moving unless they give
us some alternative campsite.''
   For now, she can't go to the two so-called multiservice shelters
that the city took over this week because they're for men only.
   And she refuses to move into one of the older shelters or a
former hotel the city is offering women.
   ``I'm safer in this park than in one of those `hot line'
rooms,'' Howard said, referring to the one-time hotel rooms the
city has available.
   She explained that occupants often are bothered by crack dealers
and rats.
   The city takeover of the multiservice shelters coincides with
the mayor's order for police to begin arresting people sleeping or
keeping belongings at the Civic Center. The centers combine shelter
with such services as drug and alcohol treatment and job counseling.
   But homeless advocates criticized the city's plan, saying the
110 new beds the city has made available won't accommodate the up
to 350 homeless who sleep in the park.
   Howard said she is one of about 50 who intend to remain camped
at the Civic Center despite an expected wave of arrests sometime
Friday.
   Others, who said they don't want to face jail, lined up for
vouchers handed out Thursday morning. Many complained there were
not enough tickets to go around.
   Deputy Mayor Myra Snyder said Thursday that all of the Civic
Center's homeless will have access to the vouchers, which admit
homeless people to a center that, in turn, refers them to a shelter
or hotel room.
   Snyder said some people have to wait because the workers were
only handing out 50 at a time in order to keep an accurate count.
   ``I prefer not to sleep out here, I prefer to go to the
shelter,'' said Greg Hayes, 35, who has been living on and off in
Civic Center since his release from San Quentin prison in December.
   Hayes, who served 54 months for a armed robbery, picked up a
voucher. He said he's stayed away from existing shelters because of
the dirt and violence and hopes the new shelter will be cleaner.
   ``You're better off sleeping out here than some of those
shelters,'' he said. ``This is the first opportunity to get into
something decent.''
   Advocates for the homeless charge that the mayor's new policy
will force 215 people already staying in one of the two shelters
out on the streets to make way for the displaced Civic Center
homeless. They said it also will break up couples and force many
people into jails, doorways or alleys.
   In protest, the Coalition on Homelessness plans to bring in
homeless people from other areas to the Civic Center to overwhelm
the new shelters, said the group's Josh Brandon.
   The city's plan unfairly targets the Civic Center homeless,
while others throughout the city desire shelter as well, Brandon
said.
   ``We simply want to give people who want to get off the streets
the opportunity to get off the streets,'' he said.

<HEAD>Growth Factor Protects Heart Following Attack, Study In Rats Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A natural substance called transforming growth
factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells
following a heart attack, according to a study published in the
journal Science.
   In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a
group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50
percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth
factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta.
   ``TGF beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys
following a heart attack,'' said Dr. Allan M. Lefer, a professor at
Jefferson.
   Lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in 24 rats
by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts.
   In 12 of the rats, the researchers injected a placebo. In the
other 12, they injected transforming growth factor beta.
   For those who received the TGF beta, said Lefer, ``the damage
from the attack was much less severe. There was about 50 percent
less injury with TGF beta than without it.''
   The extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the
amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack.
Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heart
attack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer. Thus, by
measuring for the loss of this substance, researchers could
determine the amount of heart damage.
   Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other
substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood
vessels to narrow following a heart attack. Narrowed blood vessels
carry less oxygen-rich blood to cells and this causes additional
injury following a heart attack.
   TGF beta is normally present in heart cells, but the study
published in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cells
damaged by a simulated heart attack.
   Though TGF beta is produced naturally in the body, Lefer said
his research team used a substance produced artificially by
Genentech, a California biotechnology firm.
   Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with
TGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack
victims with the substance is at least a year away.
   Jefferson Medical College, where the study was done, is part of
Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
   Science, which published the study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Special Master Rules In Kentucky-Illinois Boundary Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The boundary between Kentucky and Illinois
is the low-water mark on the Illinois side of the Ohio River _
right where it was when Kentucky became a state in 1792, a U.S.
Supreme Court mediator has ruled.
   The exact boundary is of more than map-making interest. Illinois
fishermen have long complained of having to buy Kentucky licenses
to fish from their own shore. It also could affect certain property
tax payments.
   The problem is that the river no longer follows that 1792
low-water mark, and no one is exactly sure where it was.
   Therefore, Special Master Matthew J. Jasen said the boundary
should be determined by agreement of the two states or a joint
survey. If no agreement can be reached, Jasen said he would decide.
His recommendation will be considered by the Supreme Court at its
fall term that begins in October.
   His recommendation, issued last week and released Thursday by
the Kentucky attorney general's office, is the latest chapter in a
decade-long, four-state legal dispute over the location of
Kentucky's northern boundary.
   The ruling from Jasen, a retired New York Court of Appeals judge
appointed by the Supreme Court to hear the case four years ago, is
what Illinois officials had sought and parallels earlier rulings in
the Ohio and Indiana cases.
   The 1792 border definition was fine until 1909, when dams raised
the water level.
   Kentucky claimed it should control the river up to the new
low-water mark, while Illinois, Indiana and Ohio said the 1792
boundary should still hold even though the shoreline had moved
beyond it.
   In a hearing in January, Kentucky officials argued that Illinois
has done little to exert its claim on the river. For example, while
Kentucky law enforcement officers routinely patrol the river,
Illinois makes no such effort, they said.

<TEXT>
   Yet another foreign invader has ignored the
border and taken up residence in the Great Lakes.
   A tube-nosed goby, a 3-inch-long fish from the Black Sea region
of the Soviet Union, was recently found on an intake screen at the
Detroit Edison Co.'s Belle River plant on the St. Clair River.
   But the goby doesn't appear threatening, unlike a host of other
invaders, including the water pipe-clogging zebra mussel, the
trout-killing sea lamprey, and the beach-befouling alewife.
   Like other non-native critters, the goby probably got to the
Great Lakes by hitching a ride on ocean freighters which take on
water _ and any small free-swimming animals that happen to be in
the way _ for ballast. When the ship reaches port on the Great
Lakes to take on cargo, the ballast gets dumped.
   Threatening or no, the goby isn't welcome.
   Biologists ``don't like to see foreign species end up in our
bodies of water,'' said Dave Jude, the University of Michigan
scientist who found the fish.

<HEAD>Assault Charges Against Congresswoman Dropped</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOWSON, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors on Thursday dropped an assault
charge filed against U.S. Rep. Helen Bentley by a process server
who said the congresswoman choked him after he handed her a
subpoena.
   Assistant State's Attorney Cynthia Ferris told Baltimore County
District Judge Mike Loney there wasn't enough evidence to prove the
complaint by John Burns, 41, against the 66-year-old legislator.
   Bentley, R-Md., didn't appear in court, but issued a statement
afterwards.
   ``I have said all along that I never assaulted Mr. Burns or
touched him and the contention that I slammed this 230-pound man
against a wall and strangled him is preposterous,'' said the
5-foot-2 Bentley.
   Burns said Bentley shoved the subpoena in his face when he
walked out of her office June 1 and demanded he take it back. When
he turned to face her, she choked him, he said.
   The subpoena ordered Bentley to be available to appear as a
defense witness in the murder trial of a man accused of killing his
wife. The victim's son and sister work in Bentley's office.
   After learning the decision to drop the charge, Burns left the
courtroom abruptly. He returned after his lawyer, Stanley Kantor,
warned him against saying anything that could place him in contempt
of court.
   After the hearing, Burns refused to comment.

<HEAD>Palestinian Girl Dies of Wounds, Suspected Collaborator Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 17-year-old Palestinian girl shot in the head
in a clash with Israeli troops a year ago died of her wounds
Thursday. An Arab suspected of cooperating with Israeli authorities
was discovered dead.
   The teen-ager, identified as Wafaa Khamis Alian, died at Ein
Shams Hospital in Cairo, Egypt, hospital officials said. Arab
reporters in the occupied Gaza Strip said the girl was shot in the
head during a clash with Israeli soldiers in June 1989.
   She was treated at Israel's Tel Hashomer Hospital and at Shifa
Hospital in Gaza before being taken to Cairo by relatives, they
said.
   In the occupied West Bank, meanwhile, the body of a Palestinian
was found before dawn Thursday near the Amari refugee camp. Arab
reporters said the man, identified as Feras Hasouneh, 22, was known
as a pro-Israeli collaborator and was kidnapped from his house in
the camp by five Palestinian activists.
   The army confirmed the death and said it was being investigated
by police and security services.
   At least 230 Palestinians have been killed during the
2{-year-long uprising by other Arabs on suspicion of collaborating
with Israel. Some 722 Arabs have died of Israeli gunfire, and 45
Israelis have also been slain in the violence.
   In another development, State Attorney Yosef Harish, responding
to an appeal from lawmaker Ran Cohen of the leftist Citizen's
Rights Movement, ordered a police investigation into a pamphlet
distributed to Jewish settlers, Israel radio said.
   The anonymous pamphlet, quoted by Israeli media Wednesday, urged
settlers to shoot at Palestinian stone-throwers and to carry out
vigilante raids.
   The pamphlet gave detailed instructions on how to obtain guns
and avoid capture and it advised settlers to gather explosives from
the army, masquerade as soldiers during attacks and leave
misleading evidence behind.
   More than 130 Jewish settlements have been built in the West
Bank and Gaza since they were captured from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war. About 75,000 Jewish settlers live among 1.7
million Palestinians in the occupied territories.

<TEXT>
   An Army official on Thursday used the
reunion of a band of veterans defeated during the first major U.S.
battle in Korea as the backdrop for an appeal to Congress to
exercise caution in armed forces cuts.
   ``We must not sacrifice the American soldier on the altar of
political expediency,'' Gen. Carl E. Vuono, Army chief of staff,
said in remarks at a reunion of Task Force Smith, the first U.S.
combat unit in Korea.
   ``Precipitous cuts of more than 35,000 active component soldiers
in any single year ... will fracture the combat capability that may
be required to defend our nation's vital interests,'' he said.
   Named for its commander, Lt.Col. Charles Bradford Smith, Task
Force Smith was hastily stitched together from infantry and
artillery units after North Korea struck across the 38th parallel
early on June 25, 1950.
   On the morning of July 5, with North Korean troops already in
the South Korean capital of Seoul, Task Force Smith was dug in on a
ridge commanding a highway and railway line about 22 miles south of
Seoul.
   As the sun rose, the officers and enlisted men of Task Force
Smith found themselves looking down on a miles-long column of North
Korean trucks jammed with infantry and the first of 33 Soviet-made
T-34 tanks.
   The unit had been issued exactly six high-explosive, antitank or
HEAT rounds capable of piercing the armor of that type of tank.
   But the soldiers soon made a number of unpleasant discoveries.
They found that many of their weapons either didn't work or were
too light to do the job; that radios had corroded batteries and
could not be used to call in artillery support; and no arrangements
had been made for the resupply of ammunition that began to run out
by early afternoon.
   They also found that there was no medical evacuation system and
30 or so of the most seriously wounded had to be left behind when
the order came to withdraw. In addition, they had been issued no
maps of the area and the officers had only the vaguest idea of
where they were.
   The Amy now blames the handicaps under on the rapid
demobilization of the armed forces after World War II and on the
austere budgets that left units under manned and poorly equipped
and soldiers inadequately trained.
   ``The United States Army _ the victor in the greatest land
campaigns of this century only five years before _ was an empty
force,'' Vuono said.
   He said the Army realizes that as the Cold War thaws and the
demands for cost reductions to deal with the budget deficit become
more insistent, the Army must become smaller.
   But he said care should be taken that as the Army shrinks, it
retains quality and capability.

<TEXT>
   The head of the National Education
Association on Thursday called for a $2.2 billion program that
would offer an intensive session to prepare elementary students in
need of extra attention.
   Keith Geiger proposed Operation Jump Start during the opening
session of the NEA's annual meeting, explaining that the program
would be an ``all-out, full-alert effort to give every elementary
child who needs it an educational booster shot.''
   About one-third of the nation's 26 million elementary students
would be involved, he said.
   In his first address as president to the union's policy-making
body of about 8,100 delegates, Geiger asked the federal government
to provide half of the estimated $2.2 billion needed for Operation
Jump Start. States and local school districts would pick up the
rest of the tab.
   At a news conference, Geiger said those identified for Operation
Jump Start would be given a head start on the school year, in
classes limited to 15 students. The teachers would be those the
students will have during the regular school year, Geiger said.
   ``We would release this educational surge in an intense two-week
period before regular classes in the fall of 1991 _ a little over a
year away,'' he said.
   ``The focus would be on readiness _ on a high-energy jolt for
the millions of children for whom more personal relationships with
teachers, greater confidence in the school environment, and closer
relationships between school staff and families could make the
difference between future success and failure.''
   Geiger also pointed to a position recently adopted by the NEA's
board of directors that public schools should become the primary
provider of preschool education.
   ``The arguments for this preschool position go beyond the
child's own development,'' Geiger explained. ``Every major trend
points to public school being the center of the community in the
years ahead.''
   In a key vote late Thursday, the delegates gave a qualified
endorsement of alternative routes for certifying teachers.
   ``The National Education Association remains committed to
ensuring that there is a fully licensed, qualified teacher in every
classroom _ but recognizes that there may be more than one way to
prepare such teachers,'' said the NEA policy statement.
   Alternative or nontraditional certification for teachers is a
controversial issue among educators but has gained in popularity
with predictions of future teacher shortages.
   The NEA document signals the first official attempt by the union
to show some support for the concept, although it takes a middle
ground between outright opposition to alternative certification and
those who feel any college graduate can teach school.
   In the past, NEA officials have complained that inadequately
trained teachers are allowed in the classroom when normal channels
to teacher preparation are bypassed.
   Nontraditional routes to licensure allow mid-career
professionals from other fields to become teachers. It differs from
emergency licensure because it does not bypass training in teaching
methods and other quality control measures.
   As the 2 million-member NEA, the nation's largest teacher's
union, geared up for its four-day convention, the 744,000-member
American Federation of Teachers wrapped up its four-day annual
gathering in Boston Thursday.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos was the final key speaker at
the AFT meeting. He proposed that teacher colleges require all new
teachers to be proficient in a second language.
   Cavazos also said he fully supported multicultural curricula
because of the growing diversity of classrooms across the nation.
Such an approach gives students early and frequent exposure to many
cultures to build an appreciation of people's differences, he said.

   NATO's foreign ministers agreed early Friday on a
draft communique inviting the Warsaw Pact to sign a mutual
non-aggression agreement with the West, diplomatic sources said.
   The tentative proposal ``is basically stating that various
countries who sign it are no longer adversaries and should refrain
from threat or use of force,'' one source said.
   The 20-paragraph communique, to be presented to the NATO heads
of state for final approval later in the day, also included an
invitation, as proposed by President Bush, for Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Warsaw Pact leaders to address a
NATO gathering in Brussels later in the year, officials said.
   The sources, who discussed the draft NATO summit communique on
condition they not be identified, said it also calls for the
establishment of ``diplomatic liaison'' between the military
alliances and proposes the eventual elimination nuclear artillery
shells in the region by ``reciprocal arrangement.''
   On another major point, the document would certify Bush's
proposed shift in longstanding NATO strategy regarding the possible
use of any
   nuclear weapons in the face of superior conventional forces. The
communique would describe them as weapons of ``last resort,'' but
still would make clear that use of them was not ruled out _ a point
insisted upon by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Dutch Foreing Minister Hans van den Broek confirmed ``We have
reached agreement on a communique'' as the ministers left Lancaster
House. ``We are 99 percent agreed,'' he said.
   It was Bush who pushed Thursday for the declaration that NATO's
use of nuclear weapons would be a highly unlikely last resort, and
for inviting Warsaw Pact leaders to meet directly with their NATO
counterparts.
   Bush's eye-catching proposals reflected recognition by the
41-year-old alliance of the easing of East-West tensions in Europe
and the unraveling of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   ``We are reaching out to old adversaries to emphasize NATO's
defensive character and desire to cooperate with adversaries,''
said Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman.
   French presidential spokesman Hubert Vedrine said the invitation
to Gorbachev, which also would be extended to other Soviet-bloc
leaders, was readily approved.
   Diplomatic sources said Gorbachev would be invited to address a
session of the North Atlantic Council at NATO's headquarters in
Brusels, Belgium, in December. A senior U.S. official said Bush and
the other Western government leaders almost certainly would attend
if Gorbachev accepted.
   Georgy Shakhnazarov, a personal aide to Gorbachev, said earlier
Thursday the Soviet leader was prepared to accept any such
invitation. Shakhnazarov was interviewed on the U.S. Public
Broadcasting System's ``McNeill-Lehrer Newshour.''
   For a while, Bush's proposal for revising Europes's nuclear
``flexible response'' strategy enounctered some resistance. Mrs.
Thatcher, the most reluctant of the allied leaders to lower the
West's guard, questioned abandoning the threat to launch a nuclear
attack promptly to stop a Red Army assault on Western Europe.
   The proposal ``does not leave ambiguity absolutely clear,''
complained a British spokesman, commenting only on condition of
anonymity.
   He referred to the fact that a commitment to use nuclear weapons
only as a last resort could remove some of the uncertainty
confronting a potential aggressor about possible retaliation.
   But after a four-hour meeting of the 16 foreign ministers a
British spokesman withdrew his government's objections.
   He said the communique to be adopted at the end of the summit
meeting on Friday would reserve the use of nuclear weapons as a
``last resort.'' And he said that ``no one will be left in any
doubt that nuclear weapons might be used.''
   Mrs. Thatcher herself suggested that in the midst of warmer
feelings for the Soviet Union, she was in danger of being called
``Cold War warrior.''
   Fitzwater told reporters that ``the debate is real, the
discussion is real'' as NATO embarks on a new approach.
   But overall, he said, ``we will show that NATO has a new
dimension of cooperation with the Soviet Union.''
   In that vein, French President Francois Mitterrand proposed ``a
solemn declaration renouncing aggression or first use of force.''
He told the allies he was ``not in favor of anything that would
artificially perpetuate bloc-to-bloc relations when this no longer
reflects the reality.''
   Bush, appearing tired after an overnight flight from the United
States, steered clear of reporters aboard Air Force One and at the
ceremonies that preceded the summit session. He flew to England
from Pease Air Force Base, N.H., after a long work-and-play weekend
at Kennebunkport, Maine.
   In London, the leaders gathered around a long oval table in a
chandeliered room of Lancaster House, a government mansion.
Mitterrand was late.
   The weather was chilly and it rained intermittently, and the
traditional ``family protrait'' of the 16 leaders was moved indoors.
   West German government spokesman Hans Klein said Gorbachev's
mounting domestic difficulties ``came up again and again'' during
the summit's first day.
   But a U.S. official said there was no discussion in Thursday's
session of direct aid to the Soviet Union _ an idea pushed by West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Bush, too, is easing toward supporting a Western aid package to
assist Gorbachev's restructuring program and to smooth the way for
German unification by mollifying the Soviets.
   In the private talks, the 16 NATO leaders also were considering
permitting East European countries to participate in some
non-military NATO deliberations.
   Fitzwater said Bush suggested the establishment of liaison
offices between nations in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and the
alliance.
   ``The general purpose is to find some way to give them access to
NATO in a learning capacity and hopefully one in which they would
appreciate where we're coming from,'' he said.
   Bush's startling proposal to invite Gorbachev to address the
North Atlantic Council in Brussels, where NATO has its
headquarters, would extend, as well, to the leaders of the six
other Warsaw Pact members.
   NATO's main function always has been to confront the Soviet
Union and its East European satellites with massive military might,
including a threat to launch a nuclear attack in order to drive
back any invasion by the Red Army.
   But Gorbachev has pledged to withdraw tens of thousands of
troops and tanks from Eastern and Central Europe, and a treaty now
being negotiated by NATO and the Warsaw Pact would reduce U.S. and
Soviet forces further.
   Bush called for this two-day NATO summit in May to help reshape
the Western alliance as a result of the rapidly diminishing
military threat from the East. Despite British reluctance, the
allies were expected to endorse Bush's idea.
   Diplomatic sources, declining to be identified, said the Bush
proposal was intended to demonstrate that NATO is changing its
focus to keep pace with events in the East. Three Warsaw Pact
countries, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland, have abandoned the
Communist system. Gorbachev, meanwhile, is in the midst of a
struggle in the 28th Communist Party Congress in Moscow to gain
endorsement of his experimentation with free-market concepts.
   If NATO adopts the change in strategic doctrine proposed by Bush
there still would be U.S. nuclear weapons in Western Europe. But
cuts in Soviet troops in Eastern and Central Europe, and a
reluctance by the Warsaw Pact allies to support a Soviet invasion,
make their use highly unlikely, U.S. officials said.
   Bush also is ready to consider scrapping the 1,470 U.S.
nuclear-tipped artillery shells now based mostly in West Germany
and reducing or eliminating an arsenal of 1,560 nuclear bombs
deployed in seven NATO countries.

<HEAD>`Die Hard 2' Takes Off With $5.9 million Opening Night</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Die Hard 2'' opened to strong business,
grossing $5.9 million in its first night of release, according to
figures released Thursday.
   Playing on close to 2,500 screens on the Fourth of July, the
Bruce Willis action sequel's premiere compared favorably to that of
``Dick Tracy,'' according to statistics compiled by Exhibitor
Relations Co. Inc.
   ``I think the opening is far beyond our expectations,'' said Tom
Sherak, president of domestic distribution and marketing for 20th
Century Fox, makers of ``Die Hard 2.'' ``The Fourth is not a good
movie day, especially if the weather is nice.''
   ``Dick Tracy'' collected $9.3 million on its first night, a
Friday, but that figure included more than $3 million in T-shirt
sales for special early showings. ``Total Recall,'' the biggest hit
so far this summer, made just less than $8 million in its first
Friday.
   Last summer, ``Lethal Weapon 2,'' one of the season's most
popular crime-fighting films, collected $6.3 million its first day
of release, also a Friday.
   Made at an estimated cost of $62 million, ``Die Hard 2'' is
among the most expensive films in Hollywood history. The original
``Die Hard,'' also starring Willis as a crafty policeman in a
showdown with international terrorists, opened in July 1988.
   ``Die Hard 2'' played on 2,020 screens on Tuesday in special
``sneak'' previews, netting 20th Century Fox $3.7 million. Those
figures will not be counted in the film's opening weekend results
released next Monday, the studio said.

   Nelson Mandela, nearing the end of his
six-week tour of Europe, the United States and Africa, arrived in
Uganda on Thursday to a tumultuous welcome from thousands of
Ugandans, including most politicians.
   Mandela, coming from London where he pressed for continued
economic sanctions against South Africa, landed shortly before noon
at Entebbe airport. He was greeted by President Yoweri Museveni,
Cabinet ministers, diplomats, dancers and musicians.
   Mandela, accompanied by his wife, Winnie, inspected a military
honor guard, but did not give a speech.
   Thousands of Ugandans jammed the airport and many more lined the
21-mile route that Mandela took to the capital, Kampala, in an
attempt to get a glimpse of Africa's best known former political
prisoner.
   Mandela, the deputy president of the African National Congress,
is scheduled to leave Uganda on Sunday for the annual summit
meeting of the Organization of African Unity in Ethiopia.
   On Wednesday, Mandela met with Britain's Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher.
   The two failed to resolve differences over sanctions and the use
of violence.
   Unlike most other leaders on Mandela's world tour, Mrs. Thatcher
openly opposes sanctions and wants those imposed by the European
Economic Community relaxed as a reward for South African President
F.W. de Klerk's reform program.
   Like President Bush, who Mandela met in Washington, Mrs.
Thatcher also wants the ANC to renounce its armed struggle against
the white minority government.
   Mandela has insisted that the sanctions remain in place to keep
pressure on South Africa's government to dismantle the apartheid
system of racial discrimination. He has also said the ANC cannot
renounce its armed struggle until blacks are guaranteed political
rights.

   Actor Gene Hackman, who soon will be
appearing in a film called ``Narrow Margin,'' may have avoided a
heart attack by a similar measure when he checked into a hospital.
   An artery leading to his heart had narrowed dangerously and
doctors had to reinflate it with a balloon catheter, the
cardiologist who treated him said at a news conference Thursday.
   ``We think we got him just in the nick of time,'' said Dr.
Herbert Semler.
   Hackman, 60, had just finished filming a movie in Europe called
``Dinosaur'' and was vacationing on the Oregon Coast when he began
suffering chest pain. He came to Portland and the pain expanded to
include his arm.
   He was admitted Tuesday to St. Vincent Hospital &amp; Medical Center.
   ``We did a coronary angiogram and found narrowing in one of his
arteries,'' Semler said. ``It was in a very excellent area that we
could easily reach with a balloon catheter and we dilated it.''
   Semler said that if Hackman hadn't entered the hospital when he
did, ``the artery would have completely shut down and he would have
possibly had a heart attack.''
   The doctor said Hackman was feeling fine and would be released
Friday at the latest.
   ``He feels much relieved,'' Semler said. ``The pain is gone. He
is up and around and ready to make another movie.''
   ``I spoke to Gene; he sounded pretty good,'' Hackman's
publicist, Dick Guttman, said in Los Angeles.
   Hackman thought the chest pain was only indigestion, but felt it
was a good idea to have it checked, Guttman said.
   Semler said the rest of Hackman's coronary arteries look good
and the actor can return to an active life. The doctor said he is
recommending a program of exercise and improved diet, however.
   He said Hackman is not overweight, doesn't smoke and has no
history of medical problems.
   ``That's the interesting part _ we see this in otherwise healthy
people,'' he said. ``The narrowing comes on as a natural process
like gray hair. It could happen to anyone.''
   The son of a journeyman pressman, Hackman is a former truck
driver and soda jerk who didn't pursue acting until he was in his
30s. His most acclaimed role so far was as the rough-and-tumble
narcotics cop Popeye Doyle in 1971's ``The French Connection.''
That performance won him an Academy Award.
   Among his other film credits are ``Bonnie and Clyde,'' ``I Never
Sang for My Father,'' ``The Conversation,'' ``Hawaii,'' ``Lucky
Lady,'' ``A Bridge Too Far,'' ``Superman,'' ``The Package,''
``Reds,'' ``No Way Out,'' ``Target,'' ``Hoosiers'' and
``Mississippi Burning.''
   Upcoming releases include ``Postcards from the Edge'' and
``Narrow Margin.''

   President Joaquin
Balaguer on Thursday announced increases in the price of gasoline
and flour as part of austerity measures to fight the economic
crisis in this Caribbean country.
   Balaguer did not specify how much gasoline and flour will
increase. The price of gasoline doubled in October to 82 cents a
gallon. Flour sells for the 11 cents a pound.
   The 83-year-old Balaguer was re-elected May 16 in a contest that
has been tainted by charges of fraud. The Central Electoral Board
is evaluating challenges to the results.
   Balaguer, who will be inaugurated for his sixth term Aug. 16,
also announced there will be unspecified salary adjustments to
compensate for the increased costs of basic goods.
   Government heavily subsidiizes both gasoline and flour.
   The minimum monthly salaries are $69 for public employees and
$96 for private sector employees.
   But inflation is running at least 50 percent a year and
electricity blackouts and currency devaluations are common.

<HEAD>Victims Of Postwar Anti-Semitic Pogrom Honored After 44 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   After 44 years, a memorial plaque has been
placed on the site were dozens of Jews were killed in a 1946
pogrom, but incidents of anti-Semitic vandalism marred the tribute
to the victims, a newspaper reported Thursday.
   The plaque was defaced last week and tombstones in the Jewish
cemetery were defiled Tuesday night, the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper
reported. The newspaper said a performance by an Israeli group and
a discussion meeting by local journalists were disrupted.
   On Wednesday, local residents and municipal authorities attended
an official ceremony to formally unveil the plaque in this central
Polish city.
   ``Rain is failing, it is God crying,'' said Zygmunt Nissenbaum,
chairman of the Jewish philanthropic Nissenbaum Fund, during the
ceremony.
   On July 4, 1946, rioting Poles attacked a building sheltering
Jews who had survived the Holocaust and were traveling to
Palestine. They killed 42 people and injured scores more.
   The attack came as the city was swept by an anti-Jewish
hysteria, fueled by false rumors that Jews had abducted a Christian
child.
   The Soviet-backed Communists later blamed the pogrom on
nationalists loyal to the Polish government in exile in London,
while others called the pogrom a Communist police provocation.
   Nine people were convicted and executed for their roles in the
pogrom. But shortly after their trial, the Communist authorities
banned publication of documents about the attack and it became a
so-called ``blank spot'' in Polish history.
   The memorial plaque _ with an inscription in Polish, Yiddish and
English _ is embedded in the wall of the house on Planty Street
where the slayings took place.
   During the unveiling ceremony, a letter was read from Solidarity
leader Lech Walesa, who was instrumental in erecting the plaque and
keeping alive the issue of the pogrom in overwhelmingly Catholic
Poland.
   Recalling previous attempts to honor the victims, Nissenbaum
recalled that he was surrounded by armed police when he went to the
local Jewish cemetery in 1986. He said he was told not ``to take up
the Kielce issue,'' Gazeta Wyborcza said.
   In 1987, Nissenbaum said he was allowed to place a tombstone
honoring the pogrom victims in the cemetery.
   Last year, a Solidarity-led government took power in Poland,
ending more than 40 years of Communist rule. The new government has
condemned anti-Semitism, re-established diplomatic relations with
Israel and fostered efforts to honor the thousand-year Jewish
tradition in Poland.
   Before World War II, Poland was home to more than 3 million Jews
_ most of whom later died in the Nazi Holocaust. Only a few
thousand Jews remain in Poland. Most of the Holocaust survivors
either emigrated or fled the country after anti-Semitic campaigns
orchestrated by Communist authorities.

<TEXT>
   A sketch of a man who fires darts at women was
released by police Thursday, hours after the mystery assailant
launched his 46th known attack on a midtown Manhattan street.
   A woman found a homemade dart dangling from the backside of her
clothes when she returned to her office from a lunchtime shopping
trip, said Chief of Detectives Joseph DeMartino.
   Like 17 darts recovered after previous attacks, it was made from
a pin or needle with a paper stabilizer and probably was blown
through a straw, somewhat like a pea-shooter, he said.
   The woman was the 46th pedestrian known to have been hit by the
dart shooter since June 26, police said. All were women, usually
wearing business clothes or skirts, DeMartino said.
   The police sketch of the ``Dartman,'' as New York's tabloids
have dubbed the city's latest bizarre criminal, shows a black man
with a mustache and neatly trimmed beard. Police say he is 5-feet-6
to 5-feet-8 inches tall, weighing 135 to 150 pounds, possibly
wearing glasses and carrying a black bag.
   DeMartino said the man approaches women from behind and shoots
the homemade darts at them through a straw or something similar. He
has said nothing to any of the victims, DeMartino said.
   All the attacks have occurred on busy streets in a midtown area
encompassing the garment district, Times Square and Rockefeller
Center.
   DeMartino said there had been no serious injuries and urged
women to remain calm. He said the needles and pins recovered had
not been doctored in any way.

   The government of the Indian state of
Jammu-Kashmir on Thursday gave security forces sweeping powers to
crush a bloody Moslem secessionist campaign that has left at least
666 people dead this year.
   Under the new act, security personal will be permitted to fire
on suspects and to search and destroy buildings. The act also bans
the assembly of more than five people in public places, Press Trust
of India reported.
   Gov. Girish Chander, in a statement issued in the state's
capital of Srinagar, said he made the declaration to deal with
``the terrorist,'' a term he uses to describe Moslem militants.
   The streets of Srinagar were mostly deserted Thursday as the
result of a threat by Moslem militants to attack private transport
in the Kashmir valley.
   The militants issued the threat Tuesday, saying security forces
were using private cars for surprise raids on guerrilla hideouts.
   The ban will be in force until Aug. 8, the militants said in a
statement issued to local newspapers. Any vehicle defying their ban
may be attacked, they said.
   The valley, part of Jammu-Kashmir state, has been gripped by a
Moslem insurgency since the beginning of the year. At least 666
peole have been killed since the government cracked down on the
simmering insurrection on Jan. 20.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in mostly Hindu India to have a
Moslem majority.
   The Kashmir valley was a focus of dispute between India and
Moslem Pakistan when the subcontinent was divided along religious
lines in 1947.
   Kashmir was predominantly Moslem but its Hindu ruler opted for
union with India. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the
disputed valley.

   A man fired into a church group Thursday,
wounding three people, then surrendered after a two-hour standoff
in a neighboring house, police said.
   Clifton Phillip Jeter, 23, of Los Angeles was arrested and
booked for investigation of eight counts of aggravated assault with
a deadly weapon.
   Police spokesman Leo Speliopoulos said the five extra complaints
came from people at whom the attacker pointed a firearm and who
felt their lives had been threatened.
   The motive could not immediately be determined, Speliopoulos
said. ``It just appears to be a random shooting,'' he said.
   The incident occurred in a parking lot behind a center of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Speliopoulos said.
   More than 100 girls and adults were in the parking lot, either
boarding buses for a church camp or saying farewell to the campers,
he said.
   According to police, off-duty Officer Steve Checketts saw the
man in a corner of the parking lot and told him to drop his
handgun. The man then shot Checketts, 43, hitting him in the left
arm and chest.
   The gunman then squeezed off shots into the crowd and fled to
the nearby residence of Samuel Sanchez Jr., who had met Jeter at a
party Tuesday night and invited him to stay at the house while he
looked for a place to live, Speliopoulos said.
   The gunman was the only person in the house at the time he
surrendered, police said.
   Checketts' condition was upgraded to serious from critical after
surgery.
   Another bullet hit Elaine Beech, 47, in the left ankle. She was
treated at a hospital and released.
   Amy Garrard, 17, was grazed on the leg and treated at the scene.
   ``We were just waiting to start to load the buses when all of a
sudden I thought I heard what was a firecracker,'' said Gene
Williams, whose 14-year-old daughter was going on the trip.
   Williams said he then heard Checketts yell, ``Gene, I've been
shot! Call 911!''
   Williams ran into the church and called the emergency number.
   ``I think initially everyone thought it was a prank, then when
Steve started yelling we realized it was for real,'' Williams said.

   More than 6,000 Honduran health
workers ended a 25-day strike Thursday after the government dropped
a plan to privatize some services in state hospitals.
   The 14,000-member Medical Workers' Union objected to the
privatization of food, janitorial and security services in six of
the country's larger hospitals. Union leaders said strikers would
return to work Friday morning.
   Health Minister Cesar Castellano announced the decision to drop
the privatization plan at a news conference Thursday.
   Doctors and nurses who belong to the union did not take part in
the strike. Army medics were called in to assist during the strike.
   Some 15,000 people remain on strike in sympathy with 10,000
banana workers who walked off their jobs 11 days ago in a protest
against the U.S. banana giant Chiquita Brands International Inc.
The banana workers, who earn slightly over $15 a day, were asking
for a 60 percent pay raise.
   Talks aimed at ending the strike began Saturday in the northern
city of San Pedro Sula.

<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday imposed
stricter controls on the sale and use of power saws in an effort to
protect the Amazon rain forest.
   Power saws must be registered with the government, and
landowners will need a license to cut down trees, the Brazilian
Institute for the Environment said.
   Stores that sell power saws also must be registered, the
institute said. Manufacturers of saws will be required to put the
I.D. number and production series in a readily visible place on the
equipment.
   ``We are transforming an instrument of work into a weapon that
will impede the destruction of the plant covering of Brazil,''
institute president Tania Munhoz told reporters.
   The sale of power saws without a license will be considered a
crime against the environment, carrying a penalty of up to three
months in jail and a fine of as much as $500, she said.
   Ms. Munhoz said there are more than 400,000 power saws in
Brazil. Until now, there were no controls on their use, especially
in the vast Amazon jungle.
   The government estimates that 8 percent of the 2 million
square-mile wilderness has been destroyed by farmers and ranchers.

   Hail tore the nose cone off an Eastern
Airlines jetliner Thursday, forcing the pilot to make an emergency
landing at Philadelphia International Airport soon after it left
Newark, N.J.
   There were no injuries, Eastern Airlines spokesman Robin Matell
said in Miami.
   Flight 161, a DC-9 bound for Atlanta with 42 passengers and a
crew of five, landed in Philadelphia at 3:50 p.m., Matell said.
   ``The pilot was climbing out of Newark at between 10,000 and
15,000 feet. There was heavy storm activity and apparently the nose
was blown off,'' he said. ``There was very heavy hail, and wind and
thunderstorms in the area.''
   ``It's a fiberglass dome and that was shattered by the hail,''
said Matell. ``To the best of our knowledge there was no structural
damage to the plane.''
   The pilot flew by the airport tower to allow a visual inspection
of the landing gear, then landed, said Dan Korzeniowski, the
airport's deputy director of aviation.
   ``It was a very safe and normal landing,'' he said.
   An airport employee said some passengers said they noticed a
rattling noise during the flight, but other than that ``nothing out
of the ordinary.''
   The passengers were put on another Eastern flight to Atlanta.
   Korzeniowski said the nose cone of an aircraft is part metal,
but mainly fiberglass, because the radar and other instrument
systems are kept there.
   There were some pockmarks along the edges of the wings and the

   An informant claims the Central Intelligence
Agency trained Guatemalan guerrillas at a ranch owned by Mexican
drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero, according to a Drug Enforcement
Administration report.
   The allegation, made in an interview with the DEA, was denied
Thursday by a CIA spokesman in Washington, D.C.
   ``The whole story is nonsense,'' spokesman Mark Mansfield said.
``We have not trained Guatemalan guerrillas on that ranch or
anywhere else.''
   Caro is serving a prison term in Mexico for the murder of U.S.
DEA agent Enrique Camarena at Caro's home in 1985.
   The DEA report surfaced this week in the U.S. District Court
trial of four other men allegedly involved in Camarena's torture
and murder.
   Judge Edward Rafeedie ordered prosecutors to give the report to
defense attorneys. The Associated Press obtained a copy, although
the informant's name and other identifying information was blacked
out.
   The Los Angeles Times on Thursday identified the informant as
Laurence Victor Harrison. The newspaper said Harrison ran a
communications network for traffickers and cohorts in Mexican law
enforcement in the 1980s.
   The ranch purportedly used to train guerrillas is in Veracruz,
Mexico. The bodies of Camarena and his pilot were found on a ranch
near Guadalajara.
   The informant told the DEA on Feb. 9 that the CIA used Mexico's
Federal Security Directorate (DFS) as a cover for the guerrilla
camp.
   ``Representatives of the DFS, which was the front for the
training camp, were in fact acting in consort with major drug
overlords to ensure a flow of narcotics through Mexico into the
United States,''' Harrison said.
   Sometime between 1981 and 1984, members of the Mexican Federal
Judicial Police who went to the ranch on a separate drug
investigation were confronted by the guerrillas, the report says.
   ``As a result of the confrontation, 19 MFJP agents were killed.
Many of the bodies showed signs of torture; the bodies had been
drawn and quartered,'' the informant said.
   Not contained in the DEA report are any specific statements as
to whether the CIA knew who owned the Veracruz ranch, why
Guatemalans were being trained there or if any marijuana was being
cultivated there.
   The informant also told the DEA in a Sept. 11, 1989, interview
that CIA personnel once stayed at the home of Mexican drug
trafficker Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, who was convicted and
imprisoned in Mexico in the Camarena case.
   Harrison testified in the Camarena case that he lived at
Fonseca's house in 1983 and 1984 while installing radio systems. He
carried an Interior Ministry credential which he used while serving
as a guard on Fonseca's drug convoys.
   Harrison also has testified that he decided in September to
become a government witness.
   In testimony Harrison has said he audited classes at the
University of California, Berkeley, in the late 1960s, went to
Mexico for the first time in 1968 during a student rebellion there,
and settled there in 1971.
   He has denied ever working for a U.S. government agency.

<HEAD>Opposition Threatens Legal Action on Proposed All-German Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main opposition Social Democrat
Party on Thursday criticized the government for its proposal to
hold separate East German and West German elections to an
all-German Parliament.
   Opposition leader Oskar Lafontaine accused Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's Christian Democratic Union of ``manipulating to gain an
advantage with undemocratic decisions.''
   He said separate elections would give Kohl's party an unfair
advantage in the elections.
   The Social Democrat chairman, Hans-Jochen Vogel, said he was
considering filing a complaint with the Supreme Court in Karlsruhe.
   Vogel questioned the legality of ``parliaments in two nations
being elected for one (nation) that does not yet exist.''
   West German law requires that political parties capture a
minimum 5 percent of the total vote to be represented in
Parliament. East Germany has no such rule.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble has proposed that East
Germany and West Germany abide by the 5 percent hurdle in same-day
elections for an all-German parliament. But he said the vote should
be tallied separately in each country.
   That would give small East German parties a chance to compete by
reducing the number of votes needed for representation.
   The Social Democrats said Thursday the intention of the plan is
to benefit Kohl's party by dividing the vote in East Germany. They
have demanded the votes are tallied throughout a united Germany.
   Reinhold Kopp, Lafontaine's chief of staff, told reporters
Thursday in Bonn the opposition-controlled upper house of
parliament would introduce legislation to ensure one united vote.
   ``The basic law of election equality is not up for disposal,''
Kopp said. Lafontaine is Kohl's chief rival for chancellor in the
expected December all-German elections.
   He said agreement on all-German elections might be legally
impossible if East Germany did not first declare itself merged
politically with West Germany.
   Under the government's proposal, East Germany would declare
itself merged with West Germany under the West German constitution
following the elections.
   The East German Cabinet on Wednesday set Dec. 2 as the date for
all-German elections. De Maiziere, who was strongly backed by Kohl
and won East Germany's first free elections March 18, also supports
the election plan, sources in East Berlin said.

   The youth, Hiro Alberto Fujimori, was in stable condition, said

   Police would not say if they plan to charge the truck driver
with the accident.
   Fujimori is to return to Peru on Friday after a weeklong trip to
New York and Japan, where he has been campaigning for economic aid
for his impoverished nation.
   Fujimori won a June 10 runoff presidential election by a
landslide, beating novelist Mario Vargas Llosa. He will take office
July 28.
   Fujimori and his wife, Susan, have four children.

   A raging wildfire Thursday forced
residents of a small town to abandon their homes, burned a Coast
Guard station and other buildings, and blocked the Alaska Highway,
the main road into the state.
   ``The fire is out of control. We're throwing everything at it we
have _ tankers, bulldozers, people, and it isn't working,'' said
state forester Bob Dick.
   He could give no estimate of the fire's size, except to say it
was ``substantilly larger'' than the 14,000 acres it had consumed
by Thursday morning.
   The blaze was among 159 raging across some 172,500 acres of
Alaska. The biggest fire covered about 30,000 acres near Beaver,
about 110 miles north of Fairbanks, but authorities said no
structures were threatened there.
   Gov. Steve Cowper declared a statewide state of emergency, and
called on the Alaska National Guard to help fight the fires.
   Sirens sounded through Tok, a town of some 900 people about 175
miles southeast of Fairbanks, and emergency personnel went door to
door telling residents to leave their homes and go to the community
school in town.
   Flames were within a mile of houses near the Tok airport and on
the southeast edge of town, authorities said.
   The fire was burning the Coast Guard's Loran Station Tok, which
provides electronic radio signals to help guide aviators and
mariners. Coast Guard volunteers flew to the station earlier in the
day from Kodiak to try to clear a fire line around the building.
   A weigh station along a nearby highway and an abandoned house
outside town also were burning, authorities said.
   The Tok and Tanacross airports near the community were closed.
   The Glenn Highway was closed Thursday morning from about one
mile south of Tok to about seven miles south, and the Alaska
Highway was closed between the Tok Airport and the Tanana River
crossing, about 10 miles east of town.
   ``Flames are crowning over the Tok Airport, swelling up over
trees and rolling real fast,'' said a dispatcher at the Alaska
state police office in Tok. ``The sky is black and the whole area
is completely choked in.''
   Crews cut a fire line linking the highways and tried to conduct
a controlled burn, but the fire jumped the fire break, said Sue
Mitchell, a spokeswoman for the federal Bureau of Land Management.
   Dick Jackson, the Fairbanks North Star Borough's emergency
services director, was in Tok to help with the evacuation plan. Red
Cross officials were en route to the town Thursday evening from
Fairbanks. The road to Fairbanks remained open.
   ``We've had a couple hundred tourists come in so far today.
There's a lot of smoke in the area and they're wondering what's
going on,'' said Loretta Goneau, a clerk at the visitors
information center in Tok.
   ``What's bothering us the most is breathing. There's burnt
spruce needles falling out of the air,'' resident Mellie
Terwilliger said ``You can see but you go around with your lights
on.''
   Some residents wore masks to filter out smoke.
   Gov. Cowper flew over the area Thursday afternoon. ``It's
potentially a very dangerous situation,'' he said.
   He credited state agencies' work, but said there were
insufficient forces to fight the numerous blazes.
   ``From the air you ... could see the fire spread,'' the governor
said. ``We had to get upwind of it before we could actaully see it
_ the fires are that massive.''
   Most of the fires were blamed on heat, low humidity and a rash
of lightning strikes. The fire danger was extremely high in much of
Alaska, Mitchell said. Temperatures approached 90 degrees
throughout much of the interior Wednesday.
   The heat dries out Alaska's forests and gives rise to late
afternoon thunderstorms and wind gusts, Mitchell said.
   On the Kenai Peninsula, however, drizzle and temperatures in the
40s and 50s helped firefighters curb a series of blazes that broke
out near Ninilchik.
   ``That's the only good news,'' said Mitchell. ``We like that
kind of weather.''

   Western nations agreed to provide
millions of dollars in aid to help revive the stricken economies of
four East European countries, but made no move to help the Soviet
Union.
   Foreign ministers of two dozen Western nations on Wednesday
ducked the troublesome question at a meeting called to extend an
aid program, initially set up only for Poland and Hungary, to
others in Eastern Europe.
   They said in a final statement they discussed the situation in
the Soviet Union and ``underlined their interest in positive
developments'' toward a democracy and a free-market economy.
   The issue of aid to the Kremlin, which pits the United States
for the most part against West Germany and France, was expected to

   Hormone injections can reverse some of the damage
of aging on the body and give people back the firmer flesh of their
younger years, a study released today says.
   Researchers found that injections of human growth hormone, a
once-rare protein made through genetic engineering, will help old
people build up sagging muscles, take off flab and grow more
youthful-looking skin _ turning back the clock as much as 20 years
in just six months.
   However, they caution that the treatment is not the fountain of
youth, and should not be used routinely until questions are
answered about its long-term effects and possible hazards.
   And while it will firm up bodies, it will not undo many of the
other ravages of aging, such as failing eyes and dying brain cells.

   NATO leaders Thursday quickly approved a proposal
by President Bush to open the military alliance to a visit by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. They also moved toward
accepting Bush's call for declaring the use of nuclear weapons in
Europe a highly unlikely last resort.
   Bush's eye-catching proposals, which would shift basic NATO
war-fighting doctrine, reflected recognition by the 41-year-old
alliance of the easing of East-West tensions in Europe and the
unraveling of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   ``We are reaching out to old adversaries to emphasize NATO's
defensive character and desire to cooperate with adversaries,''
said Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman.

   Bush, in a reply, denied he had violated his duty as a director

sufficient present knowledge or information to form a belief as to
the allegations.''
   Both the administrative charges, filed in February, and the

   Although two Christian Scientists were found

should the government overrule religious beliefs that affect
children?
   Medical experts on Thursday applauded the verdict against David
and Ginger Twitchell, saying it would help protect children.
   But a constitutional scholar said the decision reflects a
``fundamental unfairness'' because the Twitchells thought they were
protected by a 1971 state law that exempted spiritual healing from
child abuse statutes.
   The prosecution argued that the statute _ which states that
children will not be considered neglected or abused when ``treated
by spiritual means alone'' by an ``accredited practitioner'' _ did
not exempt the Twitchells from manslaughter laws.

   That's the trouble with catchy phrases _
they're catchy.
   So when George Bush said yes, or at least maybe, to new taxes,
everybody in America already knew that he had said no 1,000 times
and said it in a catchy way: ``Read my lips _ no new taxes.''
   Bush is not the first president to break a campaign promise, but
he was so downright unequivocal that his about-face will go down as
part of the history of the Bush presidency.
   He put himself among the giants of promise-breakers:
   _Woodrow Wilson, who ran for re-election in 1916 on the slogan,
``He kept us out of war'' and five months later asked Congress for
a declaration of war.
   _Franklin D. Roosevelt, who, running against Herbert Hoover in
1932, accused Hoover of running up ``a deficit so great that it
makes us catch our breath.'' FDR, of course, became a deficit king
in office.
   _FDR, again, who in the 1940 campaign said, pretty
unequivocally: ``I have said this before but I'll say it again and
again and again _ your boys are not going to be sent into any
foreign wars.'' A year later, American boys were being sent into
foreign wars.
   _John F. Kennedy, who said in campaigning that it would take a
mere ``stroke of the presidential pen'' to end racial
discrimination in federally assisted housing. Once in office, he
took 18 months to issue a timid executive order covering very
little of the country's housing.
   _Lyndon B. Johnson who, even as his administration was making
plans to escalate in Vietnam, told voters: ``We don't want our
American boys to do the fighting for Asian boys.'' And, ``We don't
want to get tied down to a land war in Asia.'' Shortly thereafter,
he sent the first of 500,000 American boys into an Asian land war.
   _Ronald Reagan. He promised he would never deal with terrorists.
Then came the Iran-Contra affair in which he sought to swap arms
for hostages.
   What most presidents say when they feel compelled to splatter a
campaign promise is what Bush said: circumstances changed.
   Few blamed FDR for asking for a declaration of war after Pearl
Harbor. Few held his deficits against him when they saw the bread
lines shortening. And so when Bush says the deficit is getting
bigger than he'd ever imagined, big enough to threaten prosperity,
he is betting that people will go along.
   They probably will, if the rest of the bargain is kept: if he
keeps the economy perking.
   Bruce Buchanan, a University of Texas political scientist, says
whether the public forgives politicians for broken promises depends
not so much on the breaking as on the consequences.
   ``It may well be that he'll escape punishment and other
Republicans will feel the pain,'' says Buchanan. ``By time the 1992
election rolls around, there may be no consequences for Mr. Bush.''
   On this subject, a professor has written a book. He is Jeff
Fishel, professor of government at American University, and his
book is ``Presidents &amp; Promises.'' He tries to quantify broken
promises.
   He studied the campaign promises of five recent presidents _
Kennedy, Johnson, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter and Reagan _ and
compared them to proposals actually advanced when the candidates
became president.
   He puts the presidents' proposals in seven categories, the first
two of which are ``fully comparable'' (to campaign promises) and
``partially comparable.''
   If one adds the percentages, it turns out that Kennedy tried to
make good on more of his promises than any of the five; Reagan
scored lowest.
   But all batted over .500.
   Sixty-seven percent of Kennedy's proposals were made in
fulfillment of his campaign promises. For Johnson, it is 63
percent; Nixon 60 percent; Carter 65 percent; Reagan 53 percent.
   Fishel tracked 133 promises by Kennedy; 63 by Johnson; 153 by
Nixon; 186 by Carter; and 108 by Reagan.
   He calls his methods ``crude, very broad indicators ... that do
not and cannot fully address the complexities of candidate pledge
or presidential fulfillment'' _ but conclusive enough to find the
results commendable.
   He concludes it is ``remarkable that, once elected, every
president, from Kennedy through Reagan, has demonstrated
considerable good faith, seeking through legislation or executive
order to follow through on a majority of his campaign pledges.''
   Evidently he harbors low expectations. For that matter, so does
the public. In a Gallup Poll published at the end of May, 74
percent of the participants said Bush would not be able to keep his
no-new-taxes pledge. They read his lips, but maybe they'd read
history, too.

   Indonesia plans to spend 18 months
celebrating its rich and diverse culture in the United States to
promote trade, tourism and investment.
   ``The main aim of the festival is to acquaint the general
American public with Indonesia in all its aspects, but especially
its culture,'' said Mochtar Kusumaatmadja, who initiated the
project. He is a former Cabinet minister in charge of foreign
affairs and a graduate of Yale University Law School.
   ``Some people call it a coming out party,'' he said.
   Although the world's fifth most populous nation with more than
175 million people, 13,677 islands, 450 languages and the largest
Islamic community on Earth, Indonesia sometimes seems invisible.
Officials tell of Americans who confuse it with India or Indochina.
   On the other hand, many Indonesians shun publicity. Some would
be pleased if the world would just leave them alone.
   Geography has something to do with this. No external enemy
threatens. And there is a true remoteness to be felt in parts of
Borneo, the islands beyond Bali and highland Sumatra.
   Language and culture also play a part. Much of Indonesia's
literary tradition is oral and rooted in specific islands. It
doesn't travel well or translate easily.
   The Yayasan Nusantara Jaya (Great Archipelago Foundation) which
Mochtar heads planned the massive promotion because there is less
awareness of the country among Americans than in Asia or Europe.
Also, the United States is Indonesia's second largest trading
partner after Japan and a potential source of tourists.
   ``Americans have run out of countries to discover. Indonesia is
one of the countries they see as a last frontier,'' Mochtar said.
Jakarta has scheduled ``Visit Indonesia Year 1991'' as a major
tourism campaign.
   His foundation is private, and the more than $6 million it
raised for the festival came from donors such as major oil
companies and the Rockefeller Foundation and Ford Foundation.
   Officials said the last time Jakarta tried to penetrate the
American market through a prolonged effort was with an elegant
pavillion at the 1964 New York World's Fair.
   Another catalyst for the festival was the successful 18-month
celebration of India which drew much attention in 1985. Ted Tannen,
who designed the Indian show, is doing the same for Indonesia.
   Five years in preparation, The Festival of Indonesia 1990-91
comprises exhibitions, live performances, movies and TV programs in
13 cities. The official opening is scheduled Sept. 16 at the
Kennedy Center for Performing Arts in Washington.
   Preliminaries include a showing of classical sculpture from the
8th through the 15th century, which opened July 1 at Washington's
National Gallery of Art. Pieces from Indonesia's museums and
archaeological services are supplemented by items loaned by
European and U.S. collections.
   ``This will fall during the summer, when there are thousands of
people visiting the city, so we don't want to miss the chance to
promote the upcoming festival,'' said operations manager Rahmad
Adenan.
   Indonesia's artistic styles range from the primitive carvings of
New Guinea and other islands to the finely crafted gold work of
Sumatra and Java. Much of the folk art has never been seen in the
West, except in a few museums.
   Four exhibits are the core of the festival, acting as
centerpieces to scores of ancillary events. They are ``The
Sculpture of Indonesia,'' ``The Court Arts of Indonesia,'' ``Beyond
the Java Sea'' and ``Modern Indonesian Art, Three Generations of
Tradition and Change, 1945-1990.''
   Affiliated programs include exhibitions of traditional puppetry,
classical manuscripts and textiles.
   Museums presenting the core exhibitions include the National
Gallery and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Houston's Museum of Fine Arts, the
Dallas Museum of Art, Los Angeles' Natural History Museum and San
Francisco's Asian Arts Museum.

<HEAD>Afghan Merchants Profit From War by Smuggling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eleven years ago, Sarajuddin Aryobi
was a small-time merchant struggling with the family livestock
business. Then the Soviet army entered Afghanistan and Aryobi
struck it rich.
   Mohamad Fariq's transport business barely paid expenses in 1975.
Thanks to the 12-year-old civil war between the Soviet-backed
government and Moslem guerrillas, Fariq now owns 250 trucks.
   To celebrate his success, and display it, Fariq recently yanked
out a front tooth and replaced it with a gold one.
   War and political chaos have created a smuggler's paradise.
   The flood of more than 5 million Afghan refugees to Pakistan,
Iran, Dubai, Western Europe and the United States has caused great
misery, but from it has blossomed a global network of import-export
businessmen.
   Truckers, currency dealers, buyers and sellers are scattered
around the world, and making money has become even easier since the
government in Kabul discarded Marxist theory.
   Kabul's streets are lined with car repair shops that switch
steering wheels from the left to the right so vehicles can be sold
in Pakistan and India. Towers of new truck tires awaiting re-export
stand like totem poles in alleys of the old city's bazaar.
   ``Our business climate is better than paradise,'' former Finance
Minister H.H. Tarzi said in an interview. ``I myself would like to
be an Afghan businessman.''
   Before the war, Afghanistan was dirt poor. Its per capita gross
national products, $115, was among the world's lowest. Twelve years
of war and the failed communist experiment has made the country
even poorer.
   Afghanistan has no heavy industry and its natural gas wells have
been capped for more than a year. Its only exports are traditional:
carpets, dried fruit and karakul, the curly fleeced skin of newborn
lambs.
   The name of the game in Afghanistan is re-export _ which usually
means smuggling _ to Pakistan, Iran and India.
   Aryobi's firm, Saraj Trading Co., operates from a mud-brick
courtyard off an alley in Kabul. He estimates that $1 billion worth
of goods are smuggled to Pakistan, India and Iran each year.
   During the 1980s, re-export to the Soviet Union hovered around
$400 million a year, said Aryobi, who got into the import-export
business by selling Japanese TVs to Soviet soldiers. The Soviet
trade dropped to about $50 million when the Soviet army left in
February 1989, after more than nine years in Afghanistan.
   Smuggling profits don't stay long in Afghanistan. Aryobi uses
Deutschebank in Frankfurt and Fariq, his trucker, has accounts with
Chase Manhattan in New York.
   Afghan businessmen can make a success of smuggling because the
economies of Pakistan, Iran and India remain generally closed to
the outside world.
   Ever since Pakistan and India won independence from Britain in
1947, they have tried to protect local industry by imposing huge
tariffs on imported goods.
   Customs duties are 150 percent for tires and can reach 200
percent for television sets. Iranian tariffs also are high.
   Some countries, like Japan, make things better; others, like
China, make them cheaper. Enter the smuggling Afghans.
   Afghanistan always has been a marketplace. Centuries before
Christ, traders crisscrossed its mountains on their way to the
Middle East and Asia. Silk routes to China passed through
Afghanistan, and Chinese curios still turn up in the dusty junk
shops of Kabul's Chicken Street.
   Before the civil war, an estimated 50 percent of Afghanistan's
imports were re-exported. Now, with the collapse of the economy,
the Chamber of Commerce says about 95 percent of imports are
shipped out again.
   The business centers on the aging warehouses along the muddy
Kabul River.
   Trucks heavy with goods inch out of dusty alleys and bounce over
potholed streets. Boys prod tires with pressure guages. Drivers
with full black beards and wildly colored turbans check their
AK-47s, firing rounds into the air.
   A year after the Soviet army arrived in December 1979, Aryobi
abandoned his livestock business for import-export. A chance
meeting with a Japanese businessmen brought him his first shipment
of television sets.
   Since 1980, Aryobi says, about 500,000 TVs have moved through
his riverside warehouses to neighboring Pakistan and some have gone
on to India. He also re-exports 100,000 pairs of tires a year,
usually Indian tires to Pakistan and Japanese to India.
   Aryobi, 35, does not flaunt his wealth, but 43-year-old Fariq is
nouveau riche, his shirt unbuttoned, barrel chest draped in golden
chains, fingers laden with rings of lapis lazuli.
   When Fariq replaced the tooth with gold last year, he didn't use
a painkiller. ``I wanted to feel my wealth,'' he said, flashing a
newly metallic smile.
   In 1983, Aryobi's profits became a political liability. The
communist regime of Babrak Karmal imprisoned him for ``price
gouging'' and he spent nearly three years in solitary confinement.
   The government's attitude toward business began to change after
1986, when the Soviets installed Najibullah, who uses only one
name, as president.
   Under a policy called National Reconciliation, Najibullah
returned to the traditional Afghan way of solving problems.
Merchants, tribes and local militias were given autonomy as long as
they pledged loyalty to the government.
   Afghanistan's central bank recognized the bustling currency
market in Kabul's old city. State monopolies on sugar and food
transport ended and some state-run firms were sold to private
investors.
   The biggest boon came when the state-run Afghan Cart Company
began to encourage smuggling by selling merchants licenses to
import goods, including televisions and other electronic items.
   ``We needed the money,'' explained Tarzi, the former finance
minister. More than 15 percent of government revenues now come from
sales of such licenses.
   A recent Aryobi deal illustrates the intricacies of Afghan
re-export.
   In early February, a Pakistani trader wanted to smuggle Indian
tires from Afghanistan to Pakistan.
   He went to Peshawar, Pakistan, and deposited 50 percent of the
purchase price with a currency dealer, a refugee from Afghanistan.
The currency dealer sent a telex to his uncle in Kabul's currency
market, authorizing him to pay Aryobi the funds.
   Aryobi, who doesn't like to keep money in Kabul, transferred a
portion to his bank in West Germany through Afghan money dealers in
Dubai. He got in touch with Fariq and, within a week, drivers were
hauling Indian tires east to Pakistan.
   On the way, the trucks passed through hostile territory,
controlled by Afghan rebels. Truckers paid off the guerrillas, who
operated ad hoc ``toll booths'' along the way.
   The tires arrived at the frontier at night and were smuggled
into a warehouse. The next morning, a string of pickup trucks moved
them to Pakistan's biggest city, Karachi, where they were sold. The
Pakistani trader then paid the balance in Peshawar.
   ``We always work like this,'' Aryobi said, fingering copies of
the telex traffic. ``It's pure trust. That's the Moslem way.''

<HEAD>45 Years in Jungle To Avoid ``Disgrace'' of Surrender</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHIBA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shigeyuki Hashimoto says just watching the
pace of modern Japanese life makes him tired, but he has a rare
perspective: Hashimoto spent 45 years as a guerrilla fighter in the
Malaysian jungle.
   He was working in Malaya when World War II ended and joined
guerrillas of the Malaya Communist Party.
   ``I always missed Japan and always wanted to come back, but to
do so would require a surrender,'' Hashimoto said in an interview.
``Japanese people in my generation were taught that surrender was
more disgraceful than death.''
   Hashimoto, 71, and 79-year-old Kiyoaki Tanaka emerged from
jungle sanctuaries on the Malaysia-Thailand border in January when
the Communist guerrillas ended one of the world's longest
insurgencies.
   Belief in the shame of surrender made fierce fighters of
Japanese soldiers and motivated a few to hold out on remote islands
long after the war ended. The last member of the Japanese Imperial
Army to surrender was Lt. Hiroo Onoda, who gave up in the
Philippines in 1974.
   Hashimoto and Tanaka were not in the wartime army, but were
working for a Japanese ironworks in Malaya when the war ended. They
joined the guerrillas, fighting British colonial troops first and,
after Malaysian independence in 1957, the non-communist government.
   ``Japan invaded Malaya and other Southeast Asian countries
during the Pacific War claiming it would free the region from the
colonization of European countries and the United States, but
history has proven that what Japan really did in the region was not
better than what other invaders had done,'' Hashimoto said in an
inverview.
   ``After Japan surrendered ... I thought about what I could do
for Malaya's independence and decided to help the communist forces,
which were also fighting for independence,'' he said.
   ``Japan may have surrendered, but we were still fighting a war
against Britain. ... I was never a communist, but we fought for a
common goal. They also accepted us very warmly.''
   Hashimoto said he was one of seven Japanese civilians and about
14 soldiers who joined the guerrillas in 1945, and that only he and
Tanaka survived.
   He would not give details about the many years in the tropical
jungle, but said life there was ``quite comfortable because it was
never cold and there was plenty of food.''
   ```We ate almost everything,'' including the meat of elephants,
tigers, monkeys and wild pigs, he said.
   Since his return to Japan, Hashimoto has lived with his younger
brother, Noriyuki, in a two-bedroom apartment in Chiba, just east
of Tokyo. He is not eligible for a veteran's pension, but said a
small welfare payment was enough for his modest needs.
   He said he rises before dawn, as he did in the jungle, and goes
for a walk around the town, then spends the day reading and
watching television.
   Beginning in 1970, the guerrillas had shortwave radio and
Hashimoto learned of his homeland's postwar redevelopment. ``I knew
Japan had fully recuperated from the destruction of the war and had
become a major economic power,'' he said.
   Even so, the modern scene amazed him.
   ``I never saw that many people and cars in my life,'' he said.
``It got me tired just by looking at them. People in the street
were also walking very fast.''
   Of Japan's proper role in the world, he said: ``We should always
think in terms of what's good for the rest of the world as well as
what's good for Japan.
   ``One country should never cause troubles in other countries for
the sake of its own gains. In that sense, it was wrong for Japan to
expand to the Southeast Asia in the way it did and start the
Pacific War against the United States.''
   Freedom, he said, is ``a beautiful thing, but my feeling is that
some people are taking the spirit of freedom wrongly and thinking
they are free to do anything. I think it is important for us to
know that real freedom should not cause troubles for others.''
   Hashimoto said he would spend his remaining days visiting
relatives of fallen comrades.
   ``I am too old to start something new, but I want to go around
Japan to meet families of my colleagues and tell them how they were
doing in the jungle,'' he said.

^Dollars, Spent or Invested, with a Social Conscience</NOTE>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Time was when buying a can of beans was as
easy as pie.
   You had to consider whether the beans would be tasty and
nutritious and wouldn't have too much salt.
   It's not that simple any more. Now a savvy consumer considers
whether he should be buying his beans in biodegradable containers
and, beyond that, the social policies of the company that cans the
beans.
   Does it hire and promote women? Trade with South Africa? Also
manufacture cigarettes? Pollute? Recycle? Test its products on
animals?
   Some investors also are raising questions like that. They want
to know whether the companies they support do more than merely make
a profit. They want their investment dollars to have a social
conscience.
   That process of looking into corporate policies has been given a
lot of names: ``green consumerism,'' ``economic democracy,''
``corporate responsibility'' or ``empowerment.'' Opponents might
call it supermarket socialism.
   ``We call it casting an economic vote,'' said Leslie Gottlieb,
representative of the Council on Economic Priorities, a 21-year-old
nonprofit research organization and a proponent.
   ``In the '90s, people have a need to be empowered,'' she said.
``They want to know the policies behind the companies they support
and invest in. We no longer want to be guided only by advertising
slogan.''
   Last year, the council published a booklet, ``Shopping for a
Better World: A Quick &amp; Easy Guide to Socially Responsible
Supermarket Shopping,'' which rates companies and products on 10
criteria.
   The council took a chance and initially published 100,000
copies. The booklet is now in a mass market paperback published by
Ballantine. Total sales have exceeded 699,000.
   Growth has been rapid, too, in investment funds that buy stocks
only in firms that meet ``social responsibility'' criteria.
   The ``socially responsible'' investment funds of Calvert Group
of the Washington suburb of Bethesda, Md., favor firms that avoid
South Africa, Northern Ireland, nuclear power, weapons of mass
destruction and animal testing; have progressive records on equal
opportunity and promotion of women into the corporate boardroom;
make safe, non polluting and recyclable products and use
alternative fuel sources.
   ``It turns out that of the top 1,000 publicly traded companies,
60 percent pass our criteria,'' said Steve Schueth, Calvert vice
president for socially responsible investing.
   John Schultz, president of the Social Investment Forum, a
Minneapolis-based trade association, said the amount of money put
in such ``screened'' investments went from $40 billion in 1984 to
$500 billion this year.
   Schueth said the phenomena goes back to the 1920s, when church
groups steered their investment money away from stocks in tobacco,
alcohol or gambling firms. ``Socially responsible'' investing is
much further advanced in Europe, where it is pushed by the
``green'' environmental movement.
   In America, ``it is growing, but it is still minuscule because
99 percent of all decisions are made on other grounds,'' said
sociologist Amitai Etzioni of George Washington University, who has
kept an eye on the phenomenon.
   ``It is still so small that statistics cannot put a handle on
it,'' he said. ``I don't know if it is one-eight of 1 percent or
one-eighth of one-eighth of 1 percent.
   ``It is essential to note that we are only talking about what
business does at the margins,'' Etzioni added. ``No one in his
right mind thinks that business should dedicate itself solely to
doing good.''
   Still, there's a philosophical argument against subjecting
business decisions to a ``socially responsibility'' test.
   Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman, a well-known
conservative, makes a distinction between how people spend and
invest their own money and other people's money.
   With their own money, they can do what they like, he said; but
if they spend or invest on behalf of others it is irresponsible to
make the decision on criteria not specified by the money's owner _
usually to maximize profits or get the best buy.
   ``I doubt very much that much of the endowment of Harvard
University, to take one example, was contributed by people who
intended that Harvard should sacrifice income for some supposedly
superior purpose,'' said Friedman.
   (Harvard may disagree. The university announced recently that it
has weeded tobacco stocks from its endowment's portfolios.)
   Argued Friedman: ``The fundamental principle is very simple.
Responsibility is individual and not social. The very concept of
social responsibility is a snare and a delusion.''
   As for whether the movement is a growing and permanent one, that
depends.
   Said Schultz: ``If you make the decision that a corporate
relationship to society is important, it is very difficult to
unmake the decision.''
   He said it was ``the kids at the school lunch counter'' who
compelled the nation's major tuna canners to stop buying tuna that
had been caught by methods that also kill dolphins. As adults, he
said, those kids will continue to press for business decisions made
with a social conscience.
   Said Friedman: ``If society continues moving in a socialist
direction, then it will be a permanent part of the landscape. If we
should move in the opposite direction, then it will not be a
permanent part.''
   So there's no telling if it will ever be easier to buy a can of
beans.

<HEAD>Rice Boom Brings Prosperity to Vietnamese Villages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DA TON, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dramatically larger crops have brought
television and motorbikes to once-poor villages and turned a nation
with chronic food shortages into the world's third-ranking rice
exporter.
   Nature has been kind the past two years, but the engine for
growth has been the Communist Party's retreat from the disaster of
collective agriculture and adoption of free-market policies that
gave farmers incentives.
   Vietnam's rice boom may be the biggest success story of the
economic reforms many communist-ruled countries adopted in recent
years. Industry and other sectors of the Vietnamese economy have
fared poorly.
   Truong Cong Tin, deputy director of the government Institute of
Agricultural Science of South Vietnam, said agriculture appears
able to lift Vietnam's overall economic development. About 80
percent of the 65 million Vietnamese work on the land.
   Aid officials said the progress in traditionally impoverished
villages of the north may help reduce the huge flow ``boat people''
out of the country.
   In 1988, the north imported 300,000 tons of rice and appealed
for emergency foreign aid for provinces where millions of people
were hungry because of devastating typhoons. Officials said some
farmers had to eat their rice seed stocks.
   Now the north feeds itself for the first time in decades and
last year even exported about 40,000 tons of rice, said Tran Bach
Ngoc, an official of the state rice export company Vinafood. The
south produced the rest of the record 1.4 million tons of rice
exported.
   Officials said Vietnam had exported about 600,000 tons of rice
in the first half of 1990 and the year's total might surpass 1989.
They said improvements, such as replacing antiquated milling
machines, could make Vietnam a threat to Thailand and the United
States, the leading exporters.
   ``Before, we worked in the fields very regularly, sometimes
eight hours a day, but we didn't work very hard,'' said Le Minh Re,
51, of Da Ton village on the outskirts of Hanoi, the national
capital in the north.
   ``We did not get the amount of rice equal to the effort. Now if
we work hard, we will have more rice and can use it for our own
needs. Now even some city people rush here to rent out land from
the cooperative to farm.''
   Re is starting a lucrative silkworm industry and building a
house for his son.
   Brick houses have replaced most thatched huts in Da Ton and a
new school was built last year. Farmers who once took their goods
to market on bicycles use Japanese-made motorcycles. One of every
five families has television.
   ``Some bought black-and-white TVs and now they've changed to
color,'' said the head of the cooperative, Le Van Bui. During the
interview, he was distracted occasionally by the late-morning soap
opera.
   Bui and other officials identified the key reform as Communist
Party Resolution 10, adopted in April 1988 after several years of
poor production.
   Resolution 10 gave farmers long-term leases on the land,
encourageing them to enrich it. It also reduced the role of the
cooperative so farmers would do most of the work individually, not
as part of unmotivated work groups.
   Today, cooperatives like the one at Da Ton are involved in
helping farmers get supplies and technical aid, not in actual
production.
   Improving a system introduced in 1981, authorities also
increased the amount of the crop farmers could sell on the free
market, and low prices paid by the state were brought into line
with the free market.
   Greater state investment and technical improvements increased
production, particularly in the Mekong Delta of the south, where
one of the world's great rivers nourishes verdant ricelands.
   Last year, the government provided irrigation for about 250,000
acres of rice paddies that had depended on rain, said Tin, of the
research institute.
   He said that allowed two good crops a year instead of one, and
with the addition of fertilizer, the farms switched to high-yield
varieties that produce two or three times as much grain.
   To boost production further, he said, the government must
increase support to farmers and attract foreign investment in
agriculture.
   An immediate problem is a fertilizer shortage that Western
businessmen said was hurting production.
   The Soviet Union has supplied 90 percent of Vietnam's needs
under a barter contract that expires this year, but says future
economic deals must be based on commercial merit, not the
``fraternal socialism'' of the past.
   Frictions could increase in the global rice trade. Vietnam,
whose major customers include China, India and African countries,
has penetrated traditional Thai markets with prices $30 to $40 a
ton lower than Thailand's. After Thailand complained, the
Vietnamese agreed to raise their prices.

   You can look at it as a problem to be solved,
which is probably why it hasn't been, or you can view it as an
opportunity. It is health care, and how it can be made affordable.
   Americans haven't dealt well with the issue in the past. They
have even tried to ignore it, but it won't be ignored. They have
attempted to make it somebody's else's responsibility, but by its
nature it is very personal.
   The issue seldom has been faced head-on.
   Individuals attempt to pass responsibility to insurers,
government and business. Government fears the responsiblity, and so
does business, and the two have bucked the issue back and forth for
decades.
   None has managed to keep the costs down _ not the individual,
not the insurer, not the government, not the provider _ and so
those costs rise every year at a rate that exceeds the consumer
price index.
   Last year, health care costs jumped 8.5 percent, nearly double
the general rate of inflation. You can look back 20 years or so,
and month by month the story is almost always the same: The rise in
health care costs leads the list.
   In a sense, the issue _ on the critical list for decades _ now
is becoming grave. It is eating up the gross national product; it
accounts for 12 percent now, and seems headed for 15 percent, maybe
by the year 2000.
   U.S. per capita spending on health care is double that of
Germany or France. Last year, says consultant Foster Higgins &amp; Co.,
the bill for employer-sponsored medical plans jumped 20 percent to
$2,600 per employee.
   The future holds this: a growing bill for AIDS, and a population
that not only is growing older but living longer. By the turn of
the century about 13 percent of the American population will be
over age 65.
   The picture just described is gloomy. Almost always it has been
portrayed that way, and there has been a very un-American tendency
to be routed by the facts and, it must be conceded, even to lie
down in defeat.
   Gradually, however, more American business people are viewing
the situation as one ripe for innovative approaches. Where such a
challenge exists, they reason, there must be opportunity too.
   Here are some of the ways:
   _Hospital management companies. These were the first businesses
to accept the challenge, and some have demonstrated they can
provide good health care and make a profit.
   Now, some see the gravity of the health care situation as
offering a new opportunity, especially in acute care facilities.
   _Health education programs. They are becoming more vital to
corporate plans, putting the emphasis on prevention. The cost of
prevention, business now recognizes, is a small fraction of the
cost of correction.
   _Incentive programs, such as that developed at Mount Vernon
(N.Y.) Hospital by Dr. Douglas Ratner, to encourage better living
habits and thus avoid costly treatments when health deteriorates.
   His program, Wealth From Health, offers cash benefits to workers
who take responsibility for maintaining their health through
sensible living styles. The program is now under consideration by
corporations.
   _Free-standing surgery centers. They specialize in surgical
procedures rather than treating a full range of medical problems.
Limited in scope, they are proving to be efficient medically and
financially.
   _Rehabilitation centers. Why maintain patients in fully equipped
hospitals when they don't need such services? Companies
specializing in rehabilitation have shown they can help patients,
and make a business profit doing so.
   _Home health care. Some of the fastest growing young companies
are in this field. In a sense, they bring the hospital _ a very
stripped down version _ right to the patient's home.

<HEAD>Early Evening With a ``Scuff'' Called Duvall</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In auto racing, a ``scuff'' means a tire that's
been around the track a couple of times, that's got a few bumps and
bruises. A new tire is too slick, drivers say, and needs a lap or
two to ``scuff'' it in.
   In acting, there are scuffs as well. One might be defined as a
straight-talking Academy Award winner who wants directors to leave
him alone, will turn down a part if the money's not right and has
little use for the old Hollywood movies.
   Someone, perhaps, like Robert Duvall.
   ``Some actors like to talk a lot, and I don't particularly like
to talk a lot,'' Duvall says, leaning forward, coming down hard on
the word ``like.''
   ``You just go out and do it. Sometimes you should film
rehearsals, there's something in rehearsals that's lost in film.''
   Duvall will tell you he didn't care about auto racing before
making ``Days of Thunder'' and doesn't care about it now. He also
didn't spend much time talking to star Tom Cruise (though he
respects the young actor), and would have preferred a less
elaborate production, one that didn't have ``15 chiefs putting in
their opinions.''
   But the actor did enjoy hanging out with race car builders while
doing location work in the Carolinas, part of the research that
went into his role as crew chief and mentor to Cruise, a flashy,
hot-tempered driver.
   ``When the guy comes with the blueprints from Detroit, these
guys don't need blueprints,'' Duvall said in an interview at his
apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side. ``They just do it off the
top of their heads. They're sleepers, in a way. There are some
pretty bright guys out there, and sometimes you count them out.
   ``Guys like that are off-the-cuff guys. An awful lot of
knowledge is given off the cuff. These guys are a reservoir of
information.''
   Duvall has always prided himself on being that kind of actor,
getting inside his characters without worrying about motivation or
the Method or any other fancy technique.
   In ``Days of Thunder,'' he plays Harry Hogge, a tight-lipped
kind of guy, a philosopher tucked under a race cap muttering wisdom
about brakes and tires, talking like a man who's answering
questions asked long ago.
   Check out Duvall's apartment and you'll think a lot about
history. The outside is unimpressive, a modest-looking brownstone
notable only for a long, gray awning; it's the kind of building you
walk right by.
   But inside, the ceilings are over 20 feet high, and the walls
are covered with tapestries, books and country music tapes. The
building dates back to the turn of the century, and the great tenor
Enrico Caruso once lived in his apartment.
   On the mantelpiece sits the Oscar he won as country singer Mac
Sledge in ``Tender Mercies.'' Family pictures are propped up on the
piano and sketches of tango dancers _ the profession of Duvall's
fiancee _ hang throughout.
   ``By the time the shade had reached the river, Augustus would
have mellowed,'' Larry McMurtry wrote in the novel ``Lonesome
Dove,'' describing the ex-Texas Ranger played by Duvall last year
in the acclaimed television adaptation.
   It's early evening, and Duvall, dressed in a striped polo shirt
and slacks, mellows as he talks about his long career; all else is
quiet except for an antique French clock that chimes gently in the
background.
   ``Way back when I was in college,'' recalls Duvall, born in
1931, ``there was a wonderful man named Frank Parker, who had been
a dancer in World War I. We did a full-length mime play and I
played a Harlequin clown. I really liked that.
   ``Then, I played an older guy in `All My Sons,' and at one point
I had this emotional moment, where this emotion was pouring out.
Parker said at that moment he didn't think acting can be carried
any further than that. And this guy was a very critical guy. So I
thought, at that moment at least, this is what I wanted to do.''
   He appeared on stage in New York in the late 1950s and broke
into film in 1962 as Boo Radley in ``To Kill a Mockingbird.'' He's
since played scuffs in uniform (``The Great Santini,'' ``Apocalypse
Now,''), scuffs in cowboy hats (``Tender Mercies,'' ``True Grit'')
and scuffs in suits (``The Godfather,'' ``Network'').
   Duvall won the best actor Oscar in 1983 for ``Tender Mercies.''
He's received Academy Award nominations for best actor in 1980 for
``The Great Santini,'' and for best supporting actor in 1972 for
``The Godfather'' and ``Apocalypse Now'' in 1979. He considered
appearing in ``The Godfather III,'' scheduled for release in
November, but said he couldn't agree on salary.
   ``I've lost projects I really liked, and then 24 hours later
...,'' he said, pausing, marking off the time with two quick
handslaps, ``I've forgotten all about it.Sometimes just the will to
do it is the hardest part. I lose something, so what? No big deal.''
   It's an unromantic view, similar to the thinking of playwright
Horton Foote, who won Oscars for the screenplays of ``Tender
Mercies,'' and ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' and wrote the upcoming
Duvall film, ``Convicts.''
   ``My first memory was of stories about the past,'' Foote once
observed. ``A past that, according to the storytellers, was
superior to the life then being lived.
   ``It didn't take me long, however, to understand that the
present was all we had, for the past was gone and nothing could be
done about it.''
   ``You go to old movies,'' Duvall said, ``and you see crappy
acting, except for a handful like Spencer Tracy. `Gone With the
Wind' is a travesty. That's one of the worst movies I ever saw in
my life. I can go see a student film better than that one.
   ``I've got a quarter of my career left and I got a lot of stuff
I want to do. When I was doing `Colors' in 1988 with Sean Penn,
someone asked me how I do it all these years, keep it fresh. Well,
if you don't overwork, have some hobbies, you can do it and stay
hungry even if you're not really hungry.''

<HEAD>300-Year-Old Battle Still a Current Event in Ulster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three centuries on, the Battle
of the Boyne still counts as a current event in Northern Ireland.
   Every 12th of July finds hundreds of flute and drum bands out on
the streets of villages and towns, rattling windows with thunderous
lambeg drums and tootling stirring ditties that cast the Battle of
the Boyne as a Protestant triumph over a Roman Catholic despot.
   Stern men in dark suits and bowler hats, black umbrellas tightly
furled, march in the orange sashes of the Loyal Orange Institution.
Banners salute King William III, ``King Billy,'' the victor at the
River Boyne.
   ``Your Fourth of July, your Declaration of Independence, is seen
by Americans as the point in history where they secured their
freedom, secured their liberty as individuals from an oppressive,
tyrannical power,'' said Ronnie Hanna, general manager of the
Ulster Society. ``We would see 12th of July in similar terms.''
   ``If you were an Englishman ... you might say this is a kind of
bizarre continuation of a religious controversy,'' said A.T.Q.
Stewart, a professor of history at Queen's University in Belfast.
   In fact, Stewart said, ``it is about a problem that exists now.''
   That problem, which underlies 21 years of violence and nearly
2,800 deaths, is a population divided between 1 million Protestants
loyal to British rule and 600,000 Roman Catholics who identify with
Ireland.
   The parades combine history and current events. As they have
every year since 1985, Orangemen will reaffirm their opposition to
the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which gave the Irish government a say in
the province's affairs.
   The 12th is a public holiday in Northern Ireland, but not a
mandatory one. It is a Protestant holiday, honoring a Protestant
king.
   ``The Sash My Father Wore,'' one of the most popular of the
Orange marching songs, says the winners at the Boyne fought to
maintain ``our unity, religion, laws and freedom.''
   An exhibition at the Ulster Museum, however, stresses that the
battle was an episode in a larger European struggle against King
Louis XIV of France.
   ``None of the kings in conflict cared particularly about Ireland
and the Irish,'' says a panel at the exhibit. ``James came to
Ireland solely to recover his English throne, William solely to
defeat James.''
   James II, a convert to Roman Catholicism, was removed from the
English throne in the ``glorious revolution'' of 1688. His daughter
Mary and son-in-law, William of Orange, were invited to rule.
   With backing from Louis XIV, James tried to make a comeback
through Ireland.
   On July 1 (July 12 on the modern calendar), William commanded
Dutchmen, Danes, French Huguenots, English, Germans and northern
Irish Protestants. The forces James led were from France, Germany,
England and Ireland.
   James made his stand at the Boyne, the last physical obstacle
between William's army and Dublin. William had superior numbers and
proved to be the superior tactician.
   ``Inevitably, it was all far more complicated than the
traditional symbols, even to the point that there were people from
the same families on different sides,'' said William Maguire,
curator of the Ulster Museum exhibition.
   Indeed, Pope Innocent XI sided not with the Catholic Louis, but
with King William. The Protestant king's men wore sprigs of green,
a color now always identified with Ireland and opposed to the
orange.
   ``What often strikes me as a historian is that everybody knows
today that what's happening is immensely complicated, and everyday
life is immensely complicated, and yet you are somehow expecting a
simple version of the past and are content with it, as if the past
never was real life,'' Maguire said.
   James fled Ireland after the battle, although his forces were
not finally defeated until the battle at Aughrim in western Ireland
in 1691.
   ``The Irish attached a rude name to James, called him James the
s---,'' Maguire said. ``That's his popular Irish title, and James
went off blaming the Irish for letting him down, quite unjustly.''
   The Orangemen, with their banners showing King Billy astride a
pawing white horse, often have cast the battle on religious lines.
The old marching song ``Protestant Boys'' recalls ``when James,
half a bigot and more of a knave, with masses and Frenchmen the
land would enslave.''
   Catholic nationalists and Protestant unionists agree on what
William represents. In the 1920s, Irish rebels attacked the statue
of William in Dublin, even to the extent of trucking it to a
junkyard and lopping off its head.
   The Boyne Valley is in Ireland, halfway between Dublin and the
border with Northern Ireland. The Orange Order's hopes for a big
300th anniversary ceremony on the battlefield were dropped because
of strenuous opposition.
   Although the songs sometimes give the impression the Orange
Order fought at the Boyne, it was founded in 1795 after a skirmish
between Protestants and Catholics in County Armagh.
   In his book ``The Narrow Ground,'' Stewart notes that Orange
parades were blamed for half a dozen riots in Belfast between 1813
and 1914.
   It was a Protestant parade that led to street battles in
Londonderry in 1969 that drew the British army into Northern
Ireland and revived the Irish Republican Army's armed campaign
against British rule.
   ``The provocation alleged by Catholics may arise simply from the
fact that Orangeism is a symbol of something intensely hated; or
from the display of party colors and playing of party tunes, or
from that most menacing of sounds, even to Protestant ears, the
thunder of Orange drums,'' Stewart wrote.
   For unionists, history is a 17th century drama of peril,
resistance and triumph. The threat came in 1641, when the Irish
rebelled and murdered Protestant colonists; resistance in 1688,
when the apprentice boys slammed the gates of Derry against James;
victory in 1690.
   ``You have to remember that 1641 was within living memory for
most people in the 1690s,'' Hanna said. ``This is why people rushed
to Londonderry in 1688, 1689, because they thought it was a rerun
of 1641.''
   ``It has often been said that we have a siege mentality,'' said
George Patton, executive officer of the Orange Order's Grand Lodge
in Belfast.
   ``I'm not sure whether it's a mental state, or an actual thing.
We've been under attack almost continuously. We're still under
siege to a degree. Today, it's the IRA murdering our people.''
   Patton said the three Orange lodges will be out marching early
in his village of Scarva, population 400, then travel to Tandragee
for the district parade with 18 other lodges, then join a
countywide parade.
   On the 13th, Scarva is overrun with 50,000 people or more for
the annual ``sham fight,'' a half-hour Battle of the Boyne with
wooden swords.
   The Orange Order has about 100,000 members, including most of
Northern Ireland's leading Protestant politicians, and is a potent
force in the province.
   ``It's due to the Orange Order largely that the Battle of the
Boyne has been singled as being the crucial thing,'' Maguire said.
   ``The Battle of Aughrim was a far greater battle, far more
decisive, far more bloody. But of course, from a public relations
point of view it was far less interesting. There were no kings
there.''

<TEXT>
   Frank Godfrey thinks the Battle of the
Boyne is part of Ireland's common heritage, north and south.
Michael Bell says the battle ``symbolizes everything that's rotten
in Ireland.''
   Bell's view prevailed when people living near the mouth of the
River Boyne contemplated the prospect of thousands of members of
the Loyal Orange Institution coming to commemorate the battle.
   ``It would lead to possible injury, confrontation and loss of
life,'' said Bell, the local member of Parliament. He estimates
security would have cost 500,000 Irish pounds ($800,000).
   ``We didn't have anything to celebrate,'' he said. ``We lost the
battle. If people wanted to celebrate something that is effectively
a symbol of the divisions in our country, I didn't think we should
be part of that.''
   ``My answer to that is that we didn't lose the Battle of the
Boyne; we lost nothing, in fact,'' said Godfrey, a member of the
local council who lives outside Drogheda in a thatched farm house
identified in big painted letters as ``Boyne Cottage.''
   ``The battle of the Boyne was fought between two foreign
monarchs, King William of Orange, a Dutchman, and King James II, an
Englishman,'' he said. ``The battle could have been anywhere in
Europe, and it was fortunate that it was here. ... It's part and
parcel now of our history and our common heritage.''
   George Patton, executive officer of the Orange Order's Grand
Lodge in Belfast, said landowners at the battle site asked as much
as 50,000 pounds ($80,000) to rent a field for the day and the
order couldn't buy adequate insurance.
   ``Oh, there was a lot of hostility toward it, yes,'' he said.
``There were statements made by elected representatives, and if I
had said a similar thing about nationalists or Catholics in
Belfast, I would be in the Crumlin Road (prison) for incitement to
hatred.''
   An unscientific telephone survey by The Drogheda Independent
found most of those responding opposed to an Orange celebration,
editor Paul Murphy said, but added: ``If I had to judge it, I would
say the people of Drogheda are largely indifferent.''
   Murphy said there had been more controversy over the opening of
Irish Cement's new shale quarry near Godfrey's cottage in Donore.
Local opponents of the quarry have the vocal support of Northern
Ireland Protestants, who resent the desecration of the battlefield.
   Unlike Britain, Ireland issued a postage stamp commemorating the
battle. Drogheda's civic fathers loaned their mace and sword, given
to the town by William III, to the Ulster Museum in Belfast for its
exhibition.
   The Irish government declares its door open to Northern
Ireland's Protestants, but Godfrey said: ``When they came knocking
and said they want to come down and have a religious service on the
site of the Battle of the Boyne ... the government practically
ignored the plea.''
   Bell said: ``Thirty thousand Orangemen. We need that like we
need a hole in the head.''

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There will be many tunes at
12th of July parades in Northern Ireland, but one likely to be
heard everywhere is ``The Sash My Father Wore.''
   Although the Orange Order was founded nearly a century after the
Battle of the Boyne, the song connects its traditional orange sash
with the victory of King William III in 1690 and the battles at
Derry, Aughrim and Enniskillen:
   
   Sure I'm an Ulster Orangeman, from Erin's Isle I came,
   To see my British brethren all of honor and of fame.
   And to tell them of my forefathers who fought in days of yore,
   That I might have the right to wear, the sash my father wore!
   
   Chorus:
   It is old but it is beautiful, and its colors they are fine.
   It was worn at Derry, Aughrim, Enniskillen and the Boyne.
   My father wore it as a youth in bygone days of yore,
   And on the Twelfth I love to wear the sash my father wore.
   
   For those brave men who crossed the Boyne have not fought or
died in vain,
   Our unity, religion, laws, and freedom to maintain.
   If the call should come we'll follow the drum, and cross that
river once more,
   That tomorrow's Ulsterman may wear the sash my father wore!
   
   Chorus.
   
   And when some day, across the sea to Antrim's shore you come,
   We'll welcome you in royal style, to the sound of flute and drum,
   And Ulster's hills shall echo still, from Rathlin to Dromore,
   As we sing again the loyal strain of the sash my father wore!
   
   Chorus.

<HEAD>Private Armies Control Much of Central Colombia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN GUTKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PUERTO BOYACA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An alliance of private armies
apparently financed by drug traffickers has taken over this
tropical town and much of central Colombia.
   After driving out leftist guerrillas, the vigilantes also
evicted beggars and prostitutes and opened dozens of schools.
   ``Welcome to Puerto Boyaca, the anti-subversive capital of
Colombia,'' says a sign at the town's entrance.
   The private armies have become a dreaded part of Colombia's
violent society, and the government says they have turned into
right-wing death squads.
   Ranchers organized them, with the army's blessing, about 10
years ago to fight guerrillas who were extorting money as a
``revolution tax.''
   If the money was not paid, guerrillas would kidnap ranchers,
burn down their buildings and rustle their cattle.
   Drug traffickers got into the act when the ranchers ran short of
money and weapons, says a report by Colombia's secret police that
was seen by The Associated Press.
   Death squads began roaming the region, and the army has been
either unable or unwilling to stop massacres of peasants.
   Vigilantes surrounded houses of suspected leftists, called the
inhabitants out and shot then down. In Segovia, a central Colombian
town with a leftist mayor, gunmen drove through the streets and
shot 43 people to death.
   Cocaine barons were glad to help the vigilante operation because
leftist guerrillas had kidnapped several members of their families
for ransom and the traffickers had bought hundreds of thousands of
acres in the region as investments.
   With the guerrillas gone, the private armies have offered to lay
down their arms if a deal can be struck with the government.
   At the end of June, Interior Minister Horacio Serpa said the
government was willing to take action leading to conditional
amnesty for such minor offenses as illegal posession of weapons,
but not for murder.
   Ivan Duque, spokesman for the armed groups, said Serpa's
statement was vague and ``does not offer any guarantee to farmers
and ranchers that they will be protected against guerrillas.''
   A prominent human rights activist said of the ranchers: ``They
have set up a mini fascist state right in the middle of Colombia.''
He asked that his name be withheld because of a recent attempt on
his life.
   Puerto Boyaca is a rough town of dirt streets lined with
concrete buildings. Hard-looking men in cowboy boots and Panama
hats hang out at the pool hall, some wearing mirrored sunglasses,
open shirts and gold chains.
   Parked outside are Ford Broncos and Chevy Blazers, status
symbols of underlings in the cocaine traffic.
   The town is about midway on the Magdalena River, which runs
almost the length of Colombia and empties into the Caribbean. The
private armies control the Magdalena Medio, a surrounding region
that covers much of central Colombia.
   In the past decade, tens of thousands of Colombians have been
killed by drug traffickers, leftist guerrillas and right-wing
paramilitary groups.
   ``The self-defense groups managed to ... create this climate of
peace you see here in Puerto Boyaca,'' Duque said. The vigilante
spokesman recently was elected an alternate federal senator.
   Peace does reign in the town, but critics say that's because all
opposition has been silenced.
   Local politics and the press are controlled by the Association
of Cattle Ranchers and Farmers of Magdalena Medio, known by its
Spanish acronym Acdegam.
   Members say the association provides vital services neglected by
the central government. It runs 33 schools and a pharmacy, and even
offers classes in dance and painting.
   The building Acdegam occupies is painted pink. Plastic flowers
adorn the halls and desks.
   Human rights groups say the organization is a front for death
squads.
   ``Paramilitary groups from Magdalena Medio have ordered the
massacre of many innocent peasants,'' said the activist who spoke
with an AP reporter.
   Duque and the mayor of Puerto Boyaca, Gustavo Londono, described
allegations of atrocities as a plot by leftistss to discredit
honest ranchers and farmers.
   ``We are not drug traffickers, murderers or robbers,'' Londono
said.
   People who live in Magdalena Medio were subjected first to
extortion, kidnappings and murder by leftist rebels, then to the
right-wing vigilantes who replaced them.
   ``How can anyone speak out against what's going on here?'' said
a 23-year-old woman sitting with her baby in Puerto Boyaca's park.
``They control everything.''
   According to the police report, ``the economic crisis
confronting the self-defense groups was resolved through an
alliance with drug trafficking'' in 1985.
   In return for money, the private armies helped process and
smuggle cocaine and killed opponents of drug trafficking, it said.
   No one, including the government, denies that elements of the
Colombian army initially armed and trained vigilante groups.
   ``It was the government which created them by decree, armed
them, and trained them, but when convenient, the government washes
its hands of everything.'' Duque said.
   The report by the secret police implicated the armed groups in a
1988 massacre of 20 peasants in northern Colombia and other
atrocities. It said they were involved in many of the 1,000 murders
since 1985 of members of the left-wing Patriotic Union Party.
   Magdalena Medio's private armies have close ties to armed
right-wing groups elsewhere in Colombia, the report said.
   The government has accused Henry Perez, reputed leader of the
private armies, and Luis Rubio, former mayor of Puerto Boyaca, of
ordering massacres of peasants.
   Both are at large. A judge who issued arrest warrants for them
has been murdered.
   Duque, who leads peace negotiations with the government, said
the private armies are fed up with violence and want to emulate
guerrilla groups that have laid down their arms or are in the
process of doing so.
   ``The greatest danger in Colombia is being alive,'' he said.

   Perched high in a redwood tree, his head
fixed squarely in the rifle-sight of a policeman below, Earth
First! activist Dan Johnson watched as a logger climbed toward him.
   Then a strange thing happened. The logger stopped a few feet
below Johnson and the two began to talk, about trees and jobs and
spotted owls.
   ``Of course, I saw a lot of holes in his arguments, but he
probably saw a lot in mine, too,'' Johnson recalled. ``We had a
really good talk, up there in the tree.''
   Talking? It's new ground for Earth First!, whose militant
approach to defending nature has angered authorities and
embarrassed mainstream environmentalists for 10 years.
   Earth First! has put on a kinder, gentler face for ``Redwood
Summer,'' its campaign to halt logging in California's last
unprotected groves of ancient redwoods. Pounding spikes into trees
to make logging hazardous is out. Climbing trees, and refusing to
leave when lumberjacks arrive, is in.
   As Earth Firsters nationwide gather for a camp-out starting
Monday at Montana's Beaverhead National Forest, organizers from
California see the nonviolent approach as a way of widening their
group's appeal.
   They hope to attract activists from around the nation and
convince local timber workers that Earth First! targets corporate
bosses, not the rank-and-file.
   But the change is more than just tactical. Stung by FBI
investigations, death threats and a car bombing in May that injured
two activists, many Earth Firsters are running scared of the
violence stirred up by their own burn-the-bulldozers brand of
rhetoric.
   Any softening is relative, of course. Earth First! still ranks
as perhaps the nation's most extreme environmental group, with a
famous contempt for authority and a prickly adherence to its credo,
``No compromise in the defense of Mother Earth.''
   The group's founding in 1980 was inspired by the late Edward
Abbey's novel ``The Monkey Wrench Gang,'' which romanticized
environmentalists who destroyed billboards and bulldozers while
plotting to blow up Arizona's Glen Canyon Dam.
   In 1981, Earth First! activists draped a 300-foot banner,
painted to resemble a crack, over the dam. In 1983, co-founder Dave
Foreman was dragged 100 yards by an Oregon logger's truck when he
lay down in front of it.
   More recently, Earth Firsters have chained themselves to
tree-crushing machines in Texas, blocked logging roads in
Washington, and occupied road-building equipment in Arizona. This
summer in Northern California, more than 50 have been arrested for
sitting in trees, blockading sawmills and picketing government
offices to protest the cutting of old-growth redwoods.
   Such acts of civil disobedience are the public side of Earth
First! But police believe the group is more destructive when
nobody's looking.
   Last year in Arizona, an 18-month FBI investigation ended with
the arrests of three Earth First! activists who allegedly cut
through the leg of an electric transmission tower. The FBI claimed
they were practicing for an assault against nuclear facilities in
California and Colorado.
   Foreman also was arrested, on charges that he helped plan the
scheme. All four have denied the charges; Foreman faces trial in
September.
   Earth First! leaders insist the group does not condone property
destruction.
   ``It's not Earth Firsters who monkey-wrench. It's individuals,''
said Darryl Cherney, one of the two activists injured May 24 in
Oakland when a pipe bomb exploded in the back seat of their car.
Cherney, 33, suffered a cut over one eye. Judi Bari, 40, suffered a
broken pelvis and is still hospitalized.
   Immediately after the explosion, authorities portrayed Cherney
and Bari as inept bomb-makers transporting the device for some
terrorist purpose. But charges have yet to be filed against the
pair, and they insist they were victims, not perpetrators, of the
blast.
   Cherney said he and Bari had received more than 30 death threats
since announcing plans for Redwood Summer in March. One letter,
from ``The Stompers,'' claimed to be from disgruntled timber
workers. It warned: ``If you want to be a martyr, we will be happy
to oblige.''
   Authorities said they are investigating all angles. ``We haven't
ruled out the possibility that they might have been targets of the
device rather than transporters,'' said FBI spokesman Duke Diedrich.
   But Earth First! doesn't trust the FBI.
   Foreman claims the bureau wants to discredit Earth First! He has
obtained FBI wiretap transcripts in which an undercover agent tells
other agents that Foreman's arrest would ``send a message'' to
radical environmentalists. ``That's all we're really doing,'' the
agent said, then noticed his microphone was on and added, ``We
don't need that on tape. Hoo boy.''
   The FBI probe compounds problems Earth First! has brought on
itself.
   Once just a handful of self-described ``rednecks for
wilderness,'' the group now claims about 5,000 activists in dozens
of chapters nationwide.
   There are no membership requirements, no central control _ and
sometimes it seems as if there's no control at all.
   Redwood Summer organizers have recruited protestors from around
the nation. The result has been an ideological stew of hippies,
anarchists and pagans, to name a few, all marching under the Earth
First! banner.
   ``We used to be a small, autonomous group,'' said Mickey Dulas,
a California Earth Firster since 1987. ``Now there are people
arriving every day. We don't know their tolerance for violence. We
don't know if they're narcs.''
   One previously high-profile California activist is in hiding,
reportedly fearful of death threats and FBI infiltrators. And
Foreman won't attend this week's national gathering. ``I think the
law enforcement agencies are going to disrupt things,'' he said.
   Paranoia has infected the movement.
   ``Unfortunately, along with our many battles for wilderness, we
must now also wage a battle of self-preservation,'' editor John
Davis wrote in the latest issue of the Earth First! Journal, the
group's newsletter.
   But Davis is confident the cause will prevail. ``Earth First!
has prospered through the years,'' he wrote, ``largely because we
are too disorganized to squelch.''

   Loggers, miners and ranchers burned by
monkey-wrenching ``eco-warriors'' no longer have to suffer
silently. They can call 1-303-TESTIFY.
   The hot line _ the letters stand for ``Tell of Environmental
Sabotage and Terrorism Interfering with Freedom '' _ is run by the
Mountain States Legal Foundation, a conservative law firm that
believes the news media have glamorized the bulldozer-burning,
tree-spiking exploits of radical environmentalists such as the
Earth First! group.
   ``They all treat these people as some modern-day Robin Hoods
whose concern is not the poor of the forest, but the trees. And I
think that's a terrible disservice to the American people,'' said
foundation president William Perry Pendley.
   Pendley's mission: to rally those who believe in multiple use of
the nation's public lands and galvanize public opinion against
environmentalists who would ``lock up'' those lands for wildlife.
   The Denver-based legal foundation carries on work begun in 1978
by its first chief legal officer, James Watt, who later rose to the
top of environmentalist hate-lists as President Reagan's interior
secretary.
   Watt no longer is with the foundation, but its work continues,
funded by individuals, timber and ranching groups, and corporations.
   Pendley said he favors a thriving environment with lush forests,
sparkling streams and fresh air. But he also values the logging,
mining and grazing that help feed, clothe and shelter Americans.
   ``Our belief is ... we can protect the environment and still
have respect for property rights, and still have an economic
system,'' Pendley said.
   That message is no easy sell, he said. It must compete with the
cuddly critters inevitably featured on posters urging people to
``Protect Wildlife.''
   ``Being an environmentalist is a feel-good thing. It doesn't ask
you to make any hard decisions whatsoever. It just says `feel good,
care, like animals,' '' he said.
   ``What can I put up (on posters) _ `Cut Trees?' `Produce
Income?' `Graze Cattle?' `Mine For Ore?' It's not feel-good.''
   Instead, Pendley hits the road. He regales sympathetic industry
groups and trade associations with horror stories gleaned from
newspapers and from the several calls that come in each month to
the hot line.
   He tells of 18-inch spikes driven into trees to spoil them for
logging, of cattle killed on public land, of tiny spikes scattered
on the ground to puncture trail-bike tires.
   Records of the hot line calls are filed away; eventually,
Pendley's group hopes to collect enough evidence to file a suit
against the environmentalists.
   ``I frankly think that a lot of these people, a lot of the
environmental terrorists, are just thugs that get off on violence,
that enjoy vandalism, that enjoy sabotage,'' Pendley said. ``And
they say, `Hey, we're doing this for the environment, so it's OK.'
''
   Pendley has little chance of swaying unrepentant Earth First!
activists, who call his hot line with news of what they consider
real vandalism: federally approved timber sales, drilling and road
projects.
   But he hopes for better luck in appealing to the public.
   ``We have the working men and women of this country who believe
in what we believe in,'' he said. ``When they are put at risk, in a
situation when they are threatened with the loss of their
livelihoods and futures, then they become energized and activated.''

<HEAD>Vietnamese Students Demand Better University Conditions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not grades and social
events that preoccupy science students at Ho Chi Minh University,
but crumbling buildings, primitive equipment, tattered books and
crowded dorms.
   In a decrepit building that wasn't new in French colonial days a
half century ago, a stairway reeked with the stench of a toilet.
   In the physics lab, students used equipment that belonged in a
museum. The newest book in the dusty chemistry library was
published in 1974.
   Students said those who had to live on campus were packed seven
or eight to rooms about 14 feet square that had one table, a single
light bulb and only intermittent electricity.
   Medical students said they didn't get enough to eat. ``That's
why we are so skinny,'' said Tran Thanh Cuong, 27.
   For the past two years, Vietnamese students have been
increasingly vocal in demanding better conditions and even got the
Marxist curriculum revised.
   Sources said the authorities have yielded in hopes of avoiding
the kind of student protests that challenged the Chinese regime
last year, helped bring down Communist governments in Eastern
Europe and cause street battles with police in South Korea.
   Although the leadership may fear it, students in Vietnam don't
appear ready to demonstrate for democracy. Vietnamese and Western
sources say there have been no major demonstrations since the war
ended in April 1975.
   No students have been detained for political activity, but any
who advocated overthrowing the Communist Party would be arrested,
said Do Van Chung, head of the Education Ministry's department of
student enrollment and management.
   ``I'm sure some students think they can follow the example of
the Chinese students, but we haven't seen it openly expressed,'' he
said.
   A Westerner said he heard many people question Communist rule
during his year at a Vietnamese university, but never a student.
   ``I ask them and they say, `Here, we are concentrating on money
for food','' the Westerner said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Chung said students are ``the central issue in all the
universities and colleges'' and teachers must meet them often to
hear complaints. He said this was part of the government's
3{-year-old reform program, not a reaction to events abroad.
   Last year, the government doubled the stipend given each
student, which still equals less than $6 a month, and said
admission to universities would depend on examinations, not family
connections. The first privately financed university, Thang Long,
has opened in Hanoi, the capital.
   In 1988, several hundred students in Ho Chi Minh University's
economics school got the more dogmatic Marxist tenets deleted from
the curriculum and study of free markets included.
   They made their demand in a rare teach-in, said Nguyen Cong Khe,
an editor of the Weekly Review of Youth magazine, which joined
other publications in supporting the students.
   Most of the complaining is in Ho Chi Minh City, formerly Saigon,
capital of South Vietnam, but grumblings also have increased in the
north, which has been under Communist authority since 1954.
   Hanoi University's rector, Nguyen An, said the school responded
to complaints last year by renovating the cafeteria and
dormitories, but the students ``are far from satisfied; their
demands are always increasing.''
   Chung said 165 students at Hanoi's Transportation College
boycotted a meal last year to protest bad rice. He said the
government ordered the rice replaced, criticized the rector and
fired the cafeteria manager.
   Many students interviewed said they feared unemployment after
graduation and Chung said the government was reducing the number of
student places in the universities because of the bleak job
situation.
   Vietnam, with a population of 65 million, has only about 120,000
full-time students at its 98 colleges and universities.
   A Western source said Vietnamese students, unlike those in
China, had little sense of collective interest and no tradition of
protest. Most are from the conservative countryside, and few
Vietnamese have studied in the West since 1975.
   Clearly there are anger and frustration of the kind that, in
Burma in 1988, turned scattered fights and economic protests into a
nationwide uprising against the government.
   Several weeks ago, some Vietnamese and Cambodian students at Ho
Chi Minh University were injured in a fight over the theft of a
motorbike.
   Late in 1989, a group of students vandalized the Ky Hoa
amusement park in Ho Chi Minh City after a drunken quarrel with a
guard there, said Nguyen Thi Ngoc Phuong, a teacher at the
university.
   In another incident last year, university students beat up two
security men after arguing over a bicycle collision and authorities
jailed the men briefly to placate the students, Ms. Phuong said.
   In both cases, she said, the students shouted for ``more
democracy,'' but meant the freedom to do as they pleased.

   The pamphlet had been buried in a time
capsule for more than a century, its authors long dead. And by the
time it reached Sherelyn Ogden, the words within had been lost to
the ravages of acid and time.
   ``I unwrapped it, and it was a little heap of crumbs, just a
heap of crumbs,'' she said. ``There was just no way of telling what
anything was.''
   Ogden is a document preservationist, but this pamphlet _ printed
on the acidic paper that came into vogue after the Industrial
Revolution _ was beyond preservation. It was a casualty of the war
being waged to halt the disintegration of our nation's history
before it all turns to dust.
   ``It's very urgent,'' said Merrily Smith, a preservationist at
the Library of Congress. ``Almost all of the books that were
produced after 1850 had a lot of acid in them. There's huge numbers
of brittle material.
   ``And if the movement towards embrittlement can't be stopped,
then we're looking at a tremendous loss of scholarship,'' she said.
   The problem dates to the middle of the 18th century, when demand
for paper exploded. Manufacturers abandoned the traditional cotton
and linen rags from which they made paper for cheaper, more
available wood pulp.
   To keep ink from spreading over this low-quality paper, the
manufacturers added aluminum sulphate and alum-rosin, chemicals
that cause paper to become increasingly acidic and brittle over
time.
   While Europe also is affected, the situation is considered
critical in the United States, due to the relative youth of the
nation's paper record.
   Today, an estimated 77 million books in American research
libraries are dying. The New York Public Library has said 70
percent of the books printed in this century will be unusable by
the year 2000.
   Some 3.25 million volumes in the Library of Congress alone are
considered too brittle to be subjected to normal handling, Smith
said.
   Staff members at the Northeast Document Conservation Center, the
nation's largest, are working to preserve some of the best of
America's past. In addition to classic volumes of writing, the
center has rescued original drawings by Frank Lloyd Wright,
Benedict Arnold's oath of loyalty to the United States and John F.
Kennedy's fourth-grade report card.
   The pace at the Northeast Center in Andover does not seem
frantic; staff members sit on high stools under warm and bright
lights, their heads bent as they touch cracked and stained pages.
Some, wearing white aprons, poke at paper floating in the large
shallow baths that take up much of the room.
   On a recent day, the book bindery was still, but for the small
gestures of a single staff member peering at shreds of paper _ some
no bigger than a fingernail _ strewn about a large easel.
   Ann Russell, the center's executive director, agrees that the
task of stalling the erosion of millions of books is no less than
an emergency. Every day is another book too brittle to be read, an
ineradicable stain on an Ansel Adams original print, a piece of
history gone.
   ``Some of the kinds of materials we work on, like nitrate
photographic negatives, some of our clients are monitoring their
collections and every month they can say how many more of them have
faded,'' Russell said. ``They're just watching their images
disappear.''
   The cost of the conservation war will be dear, in part because
of its labor-intensive nature.
   At the center, workers peel away damaging adhesives, remove the
books from their bindings and wash paper in a buffer solution. They
add new backings of Japanese paper, which is strong, translucent
and acid-free. They touch up photographs and rebind books in
leather with tones painstakingly matched to the original. They keep
a written record of all that they do.
   In one case, the patient was a huge map of Europe used in the
field by General John J. Pershing in World War I, with 1,200 tiny
pins to mark troop movements and color codes signifying each unit's
strength.
   Staff members picked off the pins, recorded their locations and
the colors underneath, treated the map and returned each pin to its
spot. The project, commissioned by the West Point museum, took two
months.
   The Committee for Preservation and Access reported a typical
large university research library would spend $240 million over 20
years to maintain and microfilm its holdings. Books can sometimes
cost $1,000 and up to salvage, said Ogden.
   The Massachusetts town of Marblehead paid $150,000 for the
center to preserve handpainted wallpaper hanging in a historic
mansion.
   In addition to having their collections restored book by book,
institutions also may use mass deacidification processes, which
employ chemical solvents and do not involve taking apart the book.
These methods are much cheaper, averaging between $5 and $10 a
volume, Smith said.
   Libraries also are putting parts of their collections on
microfilm, which can cost about $50 per volume, Smith said.
   A concerted effort to identify the nation's most complete
collections and microfilm them is under way, led by the National
Endowment for the Humanities, Russell said.
   Hope for the future, however, experts agree, lies not only in a
mad scramble to hold on to what's been written. Today's books must
be printed on acid-free, or alkaline, paper, preservationists say.
   Paper manufacturers are beginning to listen, Russell said.
   ``It's finally starting to happen. At this point, they've really
heard the message,'' she said. ``Every major manufacturer has at
least one alkaline mill, and now they have some stake in promoting
this as a product.''
   The change comes none too soon. The advance of brittle books is
outpacing the preservationists, they say.
   In the Library of Congress, which spends ``millions'' on
preservation, workers transfer between 11,000 and 13,000 volumes on
microfilm per year, Smith said. Meanwhile, about 70,000 of the
library's volumes move into brittle status annually, she said.
   ``It's not for lack of interest or for lack of money,'' she
said. ``It's just that there's lots of money to be spent on this. I
would say it's a race against time and we're losing.''

<HEAD>Senators Eye Savings and Loan Crackdown as Crime Bill Nears Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Private citizens frustrated by the pace of
prosecution in the $325 billion savings and loan mess could
themselves sue alleged defrauders and pocket damages under a plan
sponsors want to add to the Senate's omnibus crime bill.
   The so-called ``bounty hunter'' plan is drawing fire from the
Justice Department, which says it might end up snarling criminal
investigations already under way.
   But sponsors say it could prove to be precisely what is needed
to prod the cleanup into high gear.
   ``The United States has just experienced the greatest financial
theft in our history _ carried out by thousands of people _ and the
wheels of justice grind with agonizing slowness,'' said Sen. Paul
Simon, D-Ill.
   The General Accounting Office estimates that the savings and
loan bailout will cost taxpayers between $325 and $500 billion,
depending on inflation, interest rates and other economic
conditions.
   The bounty hunter plan is the last unresolved point in the
wide-ranging crime package, which is set for a vote on Wednesday.
   Chief provisions of the package call for curbs on nine
semiautomatic assault weapons, plus capital punishment for 30
federal crimes ranging from presidential assassination to espionage.
   Some Senate liberals are disgruntled about the death penalty
provisions and conservatives are ill at ease with any restrictions
on the right to bear arms.
   Always anxious to show crime-fighting zeal in an election year,
though, senators are expected to whisk the package through without
difficulty once the savings and loan dispute is wrapped up.
   The bill then goes to the House, where the Judiciary Committee
already is at work on a distinctively different anti-crime
blueprint.
   The ``bounty hunter'' plan is cosponsored by Simon and Sen.
William V. Roth Jr., R-Del. Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., has urged
something similar.
   Endorsed by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, the plan would cover
savings and loan fraud under the False Claims Act _ which allows
individuals to file fraud suits and pocket a portion of the damages
as a reward.
   Of course, those filing suit would have to have inside knowledge
of specific savings and loan fraud. And before setting off on their
own, they would first have to give federal prosecutors a chance to
act on the problem.
   Critics at the Justice Department, however, say the False Claims
Act is unconstitutional and ought to be junked.
   The department prevailed on senators two weeks ago to postpone
action on the plan. It argued that federal agents on the trail of
S&amp;L swindlers were liable to get sidetracked into endless reviews
of individual claims under the measure.
   It also said the plan might spawn a quagmire of conflicting
court cases and ultimately torpedo efforts to put S&amp;L crooks behind
bars.
   By postponing action on the proposal, the Senate gave sponsors
additional time for their sales pitch.
   There's a game plan, however, in case talks fizzle. If that
happens, lawmakers intend to go ahead and vote on the crime package
and bring the savings and loan provisions to the floor later as a
separate bill.
   The Senate already has done the hard work on the crime bill,
maintaining its curbs on semiautomatic assault weapons despite a
fierce lobbying campaign by the usually influential National Rifle
Association.
   In other Capitol Hill action this week, congressional budget
negotiators plan to meet with White House counterparts in search of
an agreement to cut the federal budget deficit by $50 billion in
the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.
   Agreement has been elusive after nearly two months of talks. But
the bargaining intensified after President Bush eased his position
against taxes on June 26 _ saying he now believes they must be
included in any budget pact.
   Participants say they hope a package of higher taxes and
spending cuts can be agreed to before Congress leaves for its
August recess.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee has scheduled closed
sessions much of the week to craft a defense authorization bill for
the next fiscal year.
   Controversial issues on the agenda include the Bush
administration's planned purchase of 75 B-2 stealth bombers at more
than $815 million each, spending on the Strategic Defense
Initiative and the fate of the V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft.
   Complicating the issue is uncertainty over the size of the total
budget. President Bush has proposed $307 billion in military
spending, but lawmakers have balked at that amount.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services panel, has
said that the committee will fashion two bills _ one to his budget
range of $289 billion to $291 billion and another to the Senate
Budget Committee total of $286 billion.

<TEXT>
   When leaders of the world's seven richest
industrial nations gather here for their 16th annual economic
summit, the talks are likely to focus on Soviet aid, global trade
disputes and environmental degradation.
   Here are sketches of the leaders and their priorities for the
summit.
   
   UNITED STATES
   President Bush has proclaimed ending the stalemate on global
free trade talks as his No. 1 priority for the summit. But to
achieve that goal, he needs to reach a compromise with the
Europeans, who are resisting America's call for a 10-year phase-out
of costly farm subsidies. Perhaps as a bargaining ploy, Bush
intends to show the world leaders a good time in his adopted
hometown, kicking things off with a rodeo, barbecue and country
music extravaganza Sunday night. Bush has been riding high in the
public opinion polls but he has been jolted by the adverse reaction
to his turnaround on the question of tax increases.
   
   JAPAN
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu was considered a stopgap head of
government when he assumed the leadership role in August 1989 after
two predecessors resigned in quick succession. Yet, he led his
conservative Liberal Democratic Party to a strong victory in
February elections and now stands strong in the polls. He has made
easing trade tensions with the United States a high priority and
has forged a close working relationship with Bush. Kaifu will push
for ending economic sanctions imposed on China following the
pro-democracy crackdown. But Kaifu's bid to unfreeze $5.2 billion
worth of development loans is opposed by other summit countries.
   
   WEST GERMANY
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl is steering his country to
unification with East Germany and has made no secret of his desires
to be the first chancellor of a unified Germany. To win Soviet
support for speedy unification, Kohl is pushing for an economic aid
package for the Soviet Union. While denying that they are trying to
``buy off'' the Soviets, West German leaders concede that they need
Soviet agreement on various aspects of unification, such as the
disposition of the 380,000 Soviet troops in East Germany.
   
   BRITAIN
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is the dean of
summiteers, having celebrated her 11th year in office in May. But
high inflation and an unpopular new tax have left her Conservative
Party trailing in the polls. Thatcher must call an election by June
1992 and for the first time since she came to power, polls now show
that a narrow majority of Britons think she will be defeated. Her
main aims at the summit will include arguing against any
large-scale handouts to the Soviet Union.
   
   FRANCE
   President Francois Mitterrand's popularity ratings have dropped
sharply in recent months, but he still has five years to go in his
second seven-year term and thus isn't considered in severe
difficulty. Mitterrand is expected to join Germany in pushing for a
Soviet aid package. Mitterrand, long a champion of greater aid to
the developing world, will push for more extensive efforts to trim
the $1.3 trillion Third World debt burden.
   
   CANADA
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney comes to Houston with a satchelful
of political problems. He has just lost his battle for ratification
of a constitutional amendment giving Quebec distinct status and his
popularity rating is at the lowest point for any Canadian prime
minister in history. He is expected to use the economic meeting to
reassure Canada's foreign partners that the country is not falling
apart and Canada remains a safe place for foreign investors.
Mulroney also seeks a commitment for more resources to fight global
pollution.
   
   ITALY
   Premier Giulio Andreotti, a virtual fixture in Italian
government for 40 years, heads to the summit with the perennial
problem facing Italy's coalition Cabinets _ bickering among the
partners. The Christian Democrat six-time premier has headed this
coalition since July 1989. Italy plans to push for cancelling the
debt owed to governments by the world's poorest countries. He will
also voice support for the Soviet aid proposal and urge a crackdown
on auto emissions as a way of protecting the environment.

<HEAD>Pope's Coming Visit Signals End of Church-State Conflict</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-Change in Burundi</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN EDLIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first visit to this predominantly
Roman Catholic nation by Pope John Paul II will symbolize the end
of a conflict between church and state.
   John Paul, on his sixth tour of Africa in September, will be
greeted in Burundi by President Pierre Buyoya, an army major who
seized power in a coup prompted by his predecessor's crackdown on
Catholics.
   Between 1985 and 1987, Col. Jean-Baptiste Bagaza expelled most
foreign missionaries; detained local priests, including one who
died in prison, and prohibited church services during the week.
   Bagaza, a member of the ruling minority Tutsi tribe, accused the
church of sowing the seeds of revolution among the majority Hutus.
   Some churches were banned, including Jehovah's Witnesses and
Seventh-day Adventists, and several Catholic organizations were
proscribed.
   By early 1987, religious education had been halted, prayer
meetings in villages were forbidden and all church councils had
been dissolved.
   Discontent spread among Burundi's 6 million people, two-thirds
of whom are Catholics.
   Buyoya took advantage of the angry mood to overthrow Bagaza on
Sept. 3, 1987.
   He has encouraged the return of foreign missionaries, sought the
advice of church leaders in unifying the country and lobbied
vigorously for the papal visit.
   ``The pope's arrival will signal the end of an ugly chapter in
our history, and the Catholic church can only profit from that,''
said the Rev. Adrien Ntabona, secretary-general of the Catholic
Bishops' Conference.
   Residents of this scruffy capital on the shores of Lake
Tanganyika are benefiting from the pope's pilgrimage two months
before he arrives.
   Bulldozers and graders are repairing main roads and potholed
streets. Government buildings are being given a facelift and
homeowners are promised handsome rewards for renting rooms to
Catholics from out of town.
   Several of Burundi's 204 Catholic priests advised Buyoya's
military government on the unity charter he announced in May.
   Ntabona said: ``The significance of the pope's visit is that it
comes at a time when our church is being renewed and revitalized.
The church is today socially better organized than any other group,
including political parties, and it is in a strong position to
influence unity between the two peoples.''
   With government support, priests are broadcasting sermons
explaining what unity will mean to Hutus and Tutsis.
   ``Most Hutus and Tutsis want peace,'' Ntabona said. ``Only a few
extremists want conflict. The church can help the moderates
triumph.''

<HEAD>Doctor, Aides Try to Reduce AIDS Among Street Prostitutes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The streetwalker's hollow eyes gave her away:
She needed a fix. Behind her on the empty street, a van approached
and she glanced over. Maybe she could turn a quick trick.
   The driver of the white Dodge had a different idea. He wanted to
test her blood for AIDS and ask a few questions, and he offered a
bag of condoms and $10 _ three times the amount she might make for
a sexual favor.
   But more, he offered to open a rare line of communication with a
world ravaged by AIDS.
   ``I really need your help,'' said Vanessa, 37, as she stepped
into the van. She nestled into the comfortable back seat and
stretched out her thin arm.
   The inch-long track marks along its length told her tale. They
also indicated a more than one-in-two chance she was infected with
HIV, the AIDS virus.
   Vanessa is one of 1,600 streetwalkers a New York doctor, Joyce
Wallace, has tested and counseled about AIDS. Ms. Wallace's van and
a crew of six roam New York's red-light districts.
   She has found that in the nation's largest city, a third of all
streetwalkers are infected with AIDS. Equally important, she found
most were infected by dirty needles or drug-using boyfriends _ not
by their clients.
   And in a separate study, she found scant evidence streetwalkers
are passing the virus to clients.
   A national study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control reached
similar conclusions. The incidence of AIDS infection among
prostitutes ranged from zero in southern Nevada to almost 50
percent in northern New Jersey.
   In the open back of Ms. Wallace's van, driver John Reid gently
asked Vanessa about her sex and drug habits while Karen Heagarty
took a blood sample. They listened to her story.
   ``It's like fighting a war down here,'' said Vanessa, dressed in
a tight skirt and white halter blouse. ``Before I end up dead, I
want to get out of this.''
   Ms. Wallace has heard this tale many times over the past eight
years. In 1982, with a boyfriend in tow for protection, she began
combing the 11th Avenue ``stroll'' in Manhattan to test street
women and question them about their sex and drug practices.
   In 1988, Ansell Inc., which manufactures Lifestyle Condoms,
donated a $15,000 van. Last year, with a $140,000 grant from the
CDC and the state Department of Health, Ms. Wallace and her staff
began cruising areas prostitutes were known to frequent.
   The van is ready for war. Armed with boxes of condoms, needles
and pamphlets on safe sex, Ms. Wallace's team does battle three
times a week.
   Besides the $10 and a clear plastic bag of condoms streetwalkers
are given, they get an additional $20 if they stop by Ms. Wallace's
Greenwich Village office to pick up their test results.
   ``These are throwaway women,'' Ms. Wallace said. ``Their contact
with the establishment is only occasional. It's a judge, a police
officer who wants to move them off a street corner, a school that
failed them.''
   Data from this year has not yet been tabulated. But from the 950
women tested last year, Ms. Wallace drew a startling profile:
   _Homeless: 45 percent.
   _Drug users: all but 48.
   _Mothers: 88 percent. The children of 90 percent lived in foster
care or with relatives.
   _High school dropouts: 50 percent.
   _Black: 49 percent; Hispanic: 27 percent.
   _HIV infected: 33 percent.
   The high incidence of poverty and drug addiction brings added
risk of AIDS infection for both the woman and her client, former
prostitutes said.
   Many streetwalkers today are amateurs, not the ``professional''
women of previous years, said a former prostitute of eight years
and drug user of 10 who asked to be identified only as Joellen.
   ``They run down the price because they are basically keeping a
drug habit, they don't take the time to screen their partners and
they often don't use condoms,'' said Joellen, of Prostitutes of New
York, a support group.
   Women are working longer to make the same money, Joellen said.
The price of a trick is $3 for streetwalkers in some neighborhoods.
Prostitutes who work out of brothels or hotels earn more.
   Streetwalkers used to earn up to $40 for a trick, Joellen said.
   Despite the potential risk of AIDS, the clientele hasn't
changed, she said, drawing a profile of the average john in New
York as either an awkward college-age man or a ``suburban daddy.''
   Johns are ``just as resistant to using condoms as they ever
were,'' Joellen said. Beverly, a 27-year-old streetwalker, said
some men will pay more for sex without condoms.
   ``The men somehow think they are immune to AIDS,'' Joellen said.
   On the whole, the johns are not yet being infected with AIDS,
although the risk is there.
   Ms. Wallace has tested the blood of 500 men who say they have
had contact with prostitutes since 1978, and has found only three
who apparently were infected by it. Each of the three had had more
than 600 encounters with hookers and had never used condoms.
   About half the streetwalkers said they used condoms with clients
at least some of the time. Most did not use them with husbands or
boyfriends.
   Most streetwalkers were infected by their intravenous drug-using
boyfriends or through their own drug use, Ms. Wallace said. At
least 58 percent of the women who injected drugs were infected with
AIDS.
   Ms. Wallace is raising money for the city's first drop-in center
specifically for prostitutes, a place to get medical treatment, eat
a hot meal, take showers and be counseled.
   Back on the street, Vanessa stepped from the van clutching
condoms, information about drug rehabilitation programs _ with
waiting lists a mile long _ and a number to call for her test
result.
   ``I want to start over but there's not much chance for me,'' she
said. ``Where do I begin?''

<TEXT>
   Marie Steinwachs admits she, of all
people, should have known better.
   Steinwachs, assistant director of the Household Hazardous Waste
Project at Southwest Missouri State University, was washing dishes
recently when she decided to add a dash of bleach to the water. A
flu had struck her household and she wanted a little extra
germ-killing punch.
   But soon after adding the bleach, Steinwachs felt her throat
tighten and her eyes water.
   ``I grabbed the bottle of dishwashing liquid and sure enough,
the label said `Do not mix with chlorine bleach,' '' she said.
   American homes are filled with products that can cause serious
injury or death if used or disposed of improperly.
   With an estimated 27,000 household products containing hazardous
materials available in stores, even experts like Steinwachs make
mistakes that put health and the environment at risk.
   Informing adults and children about the dangers of everyday
products, from aerosol sprays to wood preservatives, and suggesting
safer alternatives is the mission of the Household Hazardous Waste
Project.
   Founded in 1987, the state-funded program is gaining attention
for its education efforts in an era of increased health and
environmental awareness. It recently received one of 21 ``Renew
America'' awards from the National Environmental Awards Council, a
coalition of environmental advocacy groups. President Bush honored
project founder and director Sondra Goodman and other winners at
the White House.
   Perhaps the Waste Project's biggest claim to fame is a 178-page
booklet _ printed on recycled paper, of course.
   The booklet spells out which products can endanger health and
pollute the environment, recommends safer alternatives, and advises
how to safely use, store and dispose of hazardous products.
   About 7,000 copies of the ``Guide to Hazardous Products Around
the Home'' have been distributed in the United States, Canada,
Europe and Japan, Goodman said.
   Goodman, an agronomist by training, said the Waste Project grew
out of a curiosity about the possible dangers posed by cleansers
and chemicals she used in her home.
   ``I began to research the issue and I was really surprised by
some of the health aspects of these everyday products,'' she said.
``I thought, `This can't be right.' ''
   For example, Goodman said she had no idea the mothballs she
placed in her closet were classified as a pesticide and could
spread poisonous vapors.
   Nor did she know that tossing a worn-out ``button'' watch
battery into the trash could put humans and wildlife at risk. Such
batteries can leak or explode, injuring trash haulers, and the
lead, mercury and other metals they contain can seep into the soil
in landfills and pollute ground water.
   ``Once I became aware of the dangers many household products
pose, I changed my buying and usage habits to make my home more
safe,'' she said.
   She also helped start the Waste Project, with input from a
variety of community health groups and a grant from an agency of
the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.
   Goodman and her five-member staff operate on a $115,000 annual
budget. They lend their expertise to cities, civic groups and
businesses around the state. Project members also help set up or
direct consumers to recycling outlets for waste oil, transmission
fluid, automotive batteries, paint and button batteries. In
addition, they answer thousands of calls about the use, storage and
disposal of such wastes.

   Here is some advice from the ``Guide to Hazardous Products
Around the Home'':
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Before you buy a product:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Read the label. Make sure it is the product you want to buy and
that you're comfortable with the ingredients.
   Buy the least hazardous product. Let the signal words serve as a
guide. With pesticides, ``DANGER'' means highly toxic, ``WARNING''
means moderately toxic, and ``CAUTION'' means slightly toxic.
   With household products, ``POISON'' means highly toxic,
``DANGER'' means extremely flammable or corrosive or highly toxic,
``WARNING'' or ``CAUTION'' means less toxic. Buying products
labeled ``non-toxic'' may be a way of identifying a safer product;
however, be aware that the word non-toxic is an advertising word
and has no federal regulatory definition.
   Avoid aerosol products. Aerosol disperses the substance in tiny
droplets that can be inhaled deeply into the lungs and absorbed
into the bloodstream. In addition, aerosol cans may become
explosive when heated.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Once it's in your home, use it safely:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Read labels carefully before using hazardous products.
   Use the proper safety equipment when working with hazardous
chemicals.
   Leave products in the original containers with the label that
clearly identifies the contents. Never put hazardous products in
food or beverage containers.
   Do not mix products unless directed to do so by label
directions. This can cause explosive or poisonous chemical
reactions. Even different brands of the same product can contain
incompatible ingredients.
   Use only what's needed for a job. Twice as much doesn't mean
twice the results. Follow label directions.
   If pregnant, avoid toxic chemical exposure. Many toxic products
have not been tested for their effects on fetuses.
   Avoid wearing soft contact lenses when working with solvents and
pesticides. They can absorb vapors from the air and hold the
chemical near your eyes.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Store it safely:
   Keep products out of reach of children and animals. Store
hazardous products on high shelves or in locked cabinets, away from
food.
   Make certain products are clearly labeled. Make sure lids and
caps are tightly sealed and childproof.
   Store volatile chemicals or products that warn of vapors or
fumes in a well-ventilated area, out of reach of children and pets.

   A new test can detect Down's syndrome in fetuses
in one day rather than the standard three weeks, a company says.
   The procedure should not replace standard testing yet, but in
the future it may provide faster and cheaper results for expectant
couples, said Stephen Turner of Oncor Inc.
   The company, based in Gaithersburg, Md., said its testing system
can detect abnormal numbers of certain chromosomes in fetal cells
that are extracted from the womb using standard procedures.
   Down's syndrome is a form of mental retardation caused by having
three copies rather than two of chromosome No. 21. It occurs in
about one in every 800 births.
   Oncor said its testing system can also detect disease-causing,
abnormal numbers of copies of chromosomes 13, 18, X and Y. But it
cannot detect other chromosomal abnormalities or defects in
specific genes, Turner said.
   Oncor, which develops genetic tests, started selling the Down's
syndrome portion of the system in June.
   Traditional chromosome testing takes about three weeks because
once cells are extracted from the womb, they must be grown in the
laboratory and treated before their chd chromosome analysis. It can indicate
high-risk samples for
priority testing and confirm cases that were difficult to diagnose,
Turner said.
   In the future, he said, he believes the test will be used by
itself to ``allow a one-day answer to people and eliminate the
anxiety they have now'' in waiting three weeks. It should also cut
the cost of testing, he said.
   Dr. Charles Epstein, chairman of the National Down Syndrome
Society's science advisory board, said the new test could be useful
if further research shows it to be accurate.
   People who seek chromosome testing are ``under tremendous
emotional stress and would like to get the answers more quickly,''
he said.
   Aubrey Milunsky of the Boston University School of Medicine said
he believes the test's accuracy will prove acceptable, and that it
could promote chromosome testing for women younger than 35.
   Insurance companies generally will not pay for testing in such
women because they run less risk of chromosomal abnormalities than
older women do. Most laboratories charge $600 to $800 for the
standard analysis, Milunsky said.
   The new test should be far less expensive, so more younger women
could afford it, he said. Insurance companies might eventually
cover it, he said.
   If a test result is negative, a woman could be assured with a
high degree of certainty that her fetus is free of the
abnormalities the test seeks, he said. A positive result should be
confirmed by standard analysis, he said.

<HEAD>`Hot Spot' Forms Hawaii Islands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BEN DIPIETRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hawaiian folklore tells of the movements of the
volcano goddess Pele from one island to another. Without knowing
it, the tellers of these tales were chronicling the scientific
process that formed the Hawaiian archipelago.
   Legend has it that Pele was being chased from island to island
by her sister and nemesis, Na Maka o Kahai, goddess of the sea. In
reality, the ``chase'' was the formation of the islands, part of a
900-mile string of volcanoes that have been active on the Pacific
plate for 70 million years.
   These volcanic islands were formed after passing over a ``hot
spot'' in the Earth's mantle that remains in a fixed location under
the plate, said Reggie Okamura, who has studied volcanoes at the
U.S. Geological Survey's Hawaiian Volcano Observatory for 32 years.
   This hot spot remelts the portion of the rock passing over it,
creating magma. The intense heat forces the magma to rise through
the crust. The new magma builds on the previous eruptions in a
layered fashion to form massive undersea mountains whose tips
eventually rise above sea level and become islands, he said. These
are known as shield volcanoes because of their gently sloping
contours.
   ``The process that's happening now pretty much is what happened
earlier to form the other islands,'' Okamura said.
   The Pacific plate is moving northwesterly at a rate of about
four inches a year, Okamura said. Each island _ beginning with
Kauai and Niihau and followed by Oahu, Molokai, Lanai and Maui and
Hawaii _ were active volcanoes at one time.
   A large portion of Hawaii Island, the youngest in the chain,
currently sits over the hot spot. It is the island's location that
presently accounts for the volcanic activity at Kilauea, which has
been in continuous eruption since 1983. About 160 acres of new land
have been created as a result, Okamura said.
   Three of Hawaii Island's five volcanoes have been active in the
last 200 years. The other two, which already have passed over the
hot spot, have been dormant for 3,000 and 6,000 years, respectively.
   Scientists say a new seamount is forming southeast of Hawaii
Island and is about 600 feet below the surface. When it breaks sea
level, thousands of years from now, Loihi will be the newest
Hawaiian island, Okamura said.
   The process that forms Hawaii's volcanoes is different from the
one that forms volcanoes on the continental United States, such as
Mount St. Helens, which blew its top off in a spectacular eruption
in 1980.
   The Cascade range that includes Mount St. Helens was formed by
the subduction of the Juan de Fuca plate with the North American
Continental plate. As the Juan de Fuca plate is pushed deeper into
the earth, the friction melts the rock to form highly pressurized
magma that can be released with explosive force, Okamura said.
   While lava from Hawaii's volcanoes sometimes shoots hundreds of
feet into the air, it's unlikely enough pressure could be built up
to cause such a violent eruption as the one at Mount St. Helens, he
said.
   Magma _ called lava only after it reaches the surface _ moves
through the island's volcanoes via a series of tubes and vents. The
tubes are formed when the crust over a lava flow cools, thickens
and stops moving. The rest of the lava continues to pass under it.
   The tubes and vents are created by a system of dykes and sills.
Most of these are found in fractured areas of the volcano known as
rift zones. Lava also can flow over the volcano's crater, or
caldera, Okamura said.
   There are two kinds of lava _ pahoehoe and a'a _ identical in
chemical composition. Pahoehoe lava is black and smooth and
swift-moving. A'a lava is rougher, more fragmented and
slower-moving. Most lava erupts as pahoehoe, with some changing to
a'a as its temperature and gas content decrease. The lava mainly is
composed of silica, iron, magnesium, calcium, potassium, sodium and
other minerals, Okamura said.

<HEAD>Fat-Eating Couch Potatoes Face Increased Risk of Colorectal Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STANFORD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People increase their risk of colon and
rectal cancer when they eat a lot of saturated fat and don't
exercise, according to a study of Chinese residents of North
America and China.
   ``This is a message everyone needs to hear _ not just the
Chinese,'' said Stanford University epidemiologist Alice S.
Whittemore, chief author of the study. The findings are to be
published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute this
month.
   ``We began the project because we noticed that the rate of
colorectal cancer is four to five times higher among
Chinese-Americans than among Chinese in China,'' said Anna
Wu-Williams, a co-author at the University of Southern California.
   She said the rate of colorectal cancer among Chinese men in Los
Angeles County and San Francisco was close to rate of white men in
those areas, so the researchers set out to find out what changed
after the move to the United States.
   Wu-Williams said the study found about a fivefold increase in
risk of colorectal cancer associated with a sedentary lifestyle and
a diet with more than 20 grams (about two-thirds of an ounce) of
saturated fat a day for men in North America.
   The risk of colorectal cancer is increased only about 20 percent
among sedentary people who eat a low-fat diet, she added.
   The university said the researchers interviewed 905 colorectal
cancer patients and 2,488 healthy people. All were Chinese. About
half of each group lived in China and half in North America. The
researchers compared patterns of diet and activity.
   After lung cancer, colorectal cancer is the second leading cause
of cancer death in the United States, with an estimated 110,000 new
cases of colon cancer and 45,000 new cases of rectal cancer this
year, according to the American Cancer Society. The group said
annual U.S. deaths total 60,900 from colon cancer and 7,600 from
rectum cancer.
   The cancer group said previously identified factors that raise
the risk of colorectal cancer include inflammatory bowel disease
and a personal or family history of cancer or polyps in the colon
or rectum. It listed a high-fat, low-fiber diet as a suspected risk
factor.

<HEAD>Terminal Disease Was Common Ground that Led Couple to Altar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It all started with a letter.
   He wrote her because he'd heard they had something in common.
They talked some on the phone and eventually met.
   ``Pretty quickly we decided we were right for each other,'' he
said.
   What Melissa Mery and Peter Bennett had in common was the
inherited, incurable, life-threatening disease called cystic
fibrosis.
   What kept them together _ and led to their recent marriage _ has
less to do with disease than with the contagiously positive
attitude they share.
   ``Their marriage is a remarkable thing,'' said Nemr S. Eid,
Mery's physician and co-director of the CF clinic at Kosair
Children's Hospital.
   ``The reason it's remarkable is that CF has been considered to
be fatal and is very scary to people. But here we have two
youngsters with the disease deciding to face life together with
enthusiasm and courage and stamina.''
   Each understands the other's symptoms, why they cough a lot and
easily get short of breath.
   And they could skip the part about why they must take pills at
mealtimes or go through painful and time-consuming physical therapy
several times a day or sleep with oxygen tubes in their noses.
   At 24, Bennett can describe how his disease has affected him
with a mix of emotional insight and medical knowledge. The day
before his wedding, he polished off the thesis for his master's
degree in mechanical engineering. He's waiting for word on a job.
   Mery, 20, is softer-spoken. She has contributed stories about
her experiences to local and national publications. And she's now
plotting what will be their masterpiece, she says _ a joint
autobiography.
   Bennett and Mery already have lived well beyond the age anyone
thought possible at the time they were diagnosed _ he at 6 months;
she at 3 years. Because of advances in both treatment and
understanding of the disease, half of all people with CF now live
beyond age 21.
   When they considered marriage, they thought about problems they
might face with employers, medical bills _ and, most of all,
watching the one you love repeatedly battle disease.
   ``Each time one of us has been sick, we've been looking at how
we support each other,'' says Bennett. ``If Melissa's in the
hospital, for example, is it going to bring me down? If I'm doing
bad, will it bring her down?''
   What they found is ``the reverse,'' he says. ``We look at the
positive things.''

<HEAD>Happy Thoughts About Higher Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Improve your personal finances by paying higher
taxes!
   Outlandish as it may sound, that's the idea bandied about by
many financial analysts these days. So far, sophisticated investors
on Wall Street seem to be buying it.
   Of course, only a short time has passed since President Bush's
reversal late last month of his long and outspoken stand against
tax increases.
   Assuming that he and Congress now will agree on a plan aimed at
raising revenues of the federal government, it remains to be seen
what specific form the tax measures might take.
   Still, people in the investment world, long noted for
free-market preferences and distaste of anything that smacks of
bigger government, have so far behaved as though they are pleased
to see what has happened.
   Indeed, the news was greeted by a rise in both stock and bond
prices as interest rates fell.
   That reaction goes against a lot of traditional thinking about
economics and finance.
   How well would an economy already struggling with tight credit
conditions and weak consumer spending bear the added burden of a
tax increase? What havoc might a recession wreak on the investment
markets at a time when the stock market has only recently hit
record highs?
   Most economists concede that those are legitimate and worrisome
questions. For the moment, however, they say investors seem to be
betting that such perils will be averted.
   The optimistic case rests on two main expectations _ that a tax
increase would help break a persistent logjam in Washington and
reduce the federal budget deficit, and that interest rates would
drop as a result, probably with a push from the Federal Reserve.
   From that, individuals and family money managers might reap such
prospective benefits as lower mortgage rates, and support for the
slumping real estate market. Bond prices would rise, taking with
them the net asset values of the public's large holdings of income
mutual funds.
   Progress on the deficit, furthermore, would bring relief on what
John Connolly, an analyst at the Wall Street firm of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc., calls ``the No. 1 economic problem of the United
States _ the failure of domestic savings to satisfy our investment
needs.''
   Dependence on foreign capital to fill the gap has helped drive
U.S. interest rates to persistently high levels in comparison with
the inflation rate, Connolly says.
   The government's borrowing to cover its deficit has diverted
capital that could be contributing to prosperity and growth in the
private economy.
   Much of this argument is general and theoretical. It provides no
specifics on how savers and investors can make their paychecks and
savings stretch further.
   Some also might protest that lower interest rates could actually
cause savers more pain than gain in the short run, by reducing the
dollar returns available on investments like money-market mutual
funds and bank certificates of deposit.
   But anything that provides long-term influences for lower
interest rates and higher stock prices would logically stand to
help the budgets of a great many households.
   Eventually, a more prosperous economy and a government on
sounder financial footing might put pressure on politicians to
lower taxes once again.
   That, at least, is the kind of reasoning that has governed the
response of large investors so far.
   If their optimism should falter, it stands to reason that they
will serve notice of their change of heart in the financial
marketplace. The ``announcement'' would come in the form of a drop
in the stock market and a rise in interest rates.

<HEAD>Soviet Delegation Tours Grain Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the opening bell rang and traders at the
Minneapolis Grain Exchange started shouting and gesturing wildly,
eight agriculture officials from the Soviet Union appeared both
amused and confused.
   The Soviet delegation toured the Grain Exchange Tuesday to learn
more about buying and selling in a free market economy.
   ``It's not just me. The majority of us do not understand,'' said
Victor Shtepo, a deputy of the Supreme Soviet.
   Under an agreement signed last month by President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet Union will buy at
least 10 million metric tons of wheat each year over the next five
years.
   ``We would hope that by that time, the Soviet Union will have a
very active cash and futures market that may link with the
Minneapolis market, and we could trade spring wheat around the
world,'' said James Lindau, president of the Grain Exchange.
   Lindau said the Minneapolis Grain Exchange ``represents a
significant model of what might develop in the Soviet Union.''
   During the tour, the Soviet visitors were able to see firsthand
the grading of grain to determine its price and to observe the
furious activity of transactions in the trading pit.
   The Soviet officials questioned Lindau about the workings of the
market system, asking how prices are determined, how much money the
traders make and how information is relayed to other parts of the
world.
   The delegation also watched a slide presentation about the Grain
Exchange and the trading process.
   Because of similar climates in Minnesota and parts of the Soviet
Union, a type of wheat known as hard red spring wheat is a
productive crop in both places, Lindau said. He said Minnesotans
are in a good position to help Soviet farmers increase their
knowledge and technology.
   ``We know the difficulty in trying to grow crops in the northern
climate where weather is probably our worst enemy,'' he said.
   The Soviet visitors said they were happy with the tour.
   ``Whether we want to our not, we've got to move to a free
market,'' said Boris Palagnyuk, a Supreme Soviet deputy. ``We're
very happy that this was included in our programs.''

<HEAD>Dollar Higher, Share Prices Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen on
speculative buying today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange fell on profit-taking, market analysts said.
   The dollar closed at 151.00 yen, up 0.70 yen from Wednesday's
close of 150.30 yen. It opened at 150.65 yen and ranged between
150.55 yen and 151.15 yen.
   Buying by life insurance companies gave the dollar upward
momentum throughout the day, dealers said. It fluctuated as the
life insurers sold to take profits, but remained above Wednesday's
levels because of demand from overseas investors, they said.
   ``The life insurers are buying as a purely speculative hedge,''
said Kaneo Ogino of Goldman Sachs in Japan. ``The market was moving
quickly.''
   He said the dollar seemed to be testing a ceiling of 151.15 yen.
   The U.S. currency had been mainly declining since June 25, when
it closed at 155.62 yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues fell 94.25 points, or 0.29 percent, to 32,351.67 yen. The
index gained 31.32 points on Wednesday.
   An estimated 430 million first-section shares changed hands in
thin trading.
   Stock prices gained momentum late in the morning as index-linked
buying nudged the market out of its early doldrums, traders said.
   Buying has been sustained recently by dealers and institutional
investors anxious to support the market before new issues resume
Friday, traders said.
   ``There was strong institutional support for the last few days,
but today the institutions wanted to take profits,'' said
Christopher Leighton, sales manager at Schroders Securities.
   New share sales were suspended in January, when the Tokyo market
began a 3-month-long nosedive in which the Nikkei shed one-quarter
of its value.
   The resumption of equity issues is seen here as one sign that
the market is back to normal, although some dealers said they
questioned the amount of support available for more shares.
   ``It's difficult enough to interest people in what stocks are
available now,'' Leighton said.
   In bond dealings, the price of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds fell to 86.86 points as of 4 p.m. (3 a.m.
EDT) from Wednesday's close of 87.11 points. The yield stood at
7.220 percent, up from the previous day's 7.165 percent.

   Stock prices fell Thursday, hurt by a lack of

   Compounding the problem was growing concern that the pound's
strength would hurt companies with overseas earnings, dealers said.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index

   Here is an icy thought that, oddly, might make a
hot summer seem even hotter: The savings and loan bailout, which
could cost taxpayers $300 billion, may be just the tip of the
iceberg.
   If the tip is equal to a sum of that size, the single most
expensive governmental cost in peacetime, then how massive must the
bulk of the berg be?
   Conceivably, in the trillions of dollars, says economist Ronald
Utt, who points out that financial obligations of agencies
underwritten by the federal government now total $5.8 trillion.
   ``And much of that obligation is in bad shape,'' says Utt, vice
president of the U.S. Chamber Foundation, a former employee of the
White House Office of Management and Budget and a former Heritage
Foundation fellow.
   Potentially, he says, these financial obligations represent a
staggering breakdown of government. And, a growing number of
critics are saying, the lack of public information on the matter
represents a communications breakdown.
   Most people, it seems safe to say, cannot imagine that other
financial breakdowns are threatened, reasoning that if that were so
they would have heard of them. But that logic breaks as throroughly
as the communications.
   The obligations Utt refers to are spread among deposit insurance
programs, loan and pension guarantees, direct loan programs such as
those administered by the Small Business Administration, and debts
of five government enterprises.
   Utt's chilling observations are contained in a paper written for
Heritage, a conservative think tank whose opinions sometimes have
been influential in the Bush and Reagan administrations.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., says Utt, is by no
means the only federal credit program confronted with huge losses.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Federal Housing
Administration lost money in 1988 and 1989 and seemed destined to
lose again in 1990. The FHA, he says, has seen the level of claims
against its shrinking reserves rise nearly three times in three
years.
   Further, he states, ``Half of the farm loans made by the Farmers
Home Administration are in default, and half of these defaulted
loans have been in that condition for more than three years.''
   On and on it goes.
   The federal government, he notes, stands behind nearly $500
billion in guaranteed Veteran's Administration and FHA mortgages,
$48 billion in guaranteed student loans ...
   ``... and a host of other guarantees ranging from rural
electrification to shipbuilding loans, and from small business
disaster loans to loans for building plants to convert grain to
ethanol.''
   All together, he estimates, the contingent liability associated
with loan and deposit guarantees totaled $3.5 trillion at the end
of fiscal 1988. And other insurance programs _ flood insurance, for
instance _ add $500 billion more.
   How could such massive obligations not rise to the surface and
break more forcefully into the media? How can such dangers lurk so
near and not cause more concern?
   Utt doesn't have an answer to those questions, but he does
suggest that both Congress and taxpayers played a role.
   Most lawmakers, he says, ``tried to convince Americans that the
crisis was just an isolated incident, and that the vast bulk of the
government credit programs are well-managed and pose little risk to
the taxpayer.''
   And for their part, many taxpayers have wished this to be so.
   It isn't, says Utt, who advocates passage of an Omnibus Credit
Solvency Act ``to fundamentally restructure these many programs in
order to reduce taxpayer exposure to costly program failures.''
   Before it is too late, he adds.

   The forecast was for above-normal rainfall over most of the
Midwest during the latter half of next week.
   Some private forecasters continue to predict an extended period
of hot, dry weather in the southern Corn Belt. But the fears of
widespread crop stress that boosted corn and soybean prices earlier
this week are fading, said Walter Spilka, a grains analyst with
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   ``The bottom line is probably that those traders who were buying
in anticipation of a weather event now are selling in anticipation
of a non-event,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 3 cents to 3{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.20} a bushel; corn was
3 cents to 9{ cents lower with July at $2.87 a bushel; oats were 5
cents to 5} cents lower with July at $1.35 a bushel; soybeans were
17 cents to 21 cents lower with July at $6.30{ a bushel.
   Livestock futures were narrowly mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork bellies were down sharply.
   Live cattle were .03 cent lower to .13 cent higher with August
at 72.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent lower to .50
cent higher with August at 83.65 cents a pound; live hogs were .35
cent lower to .08 cent higher with July at 61.75 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .07 cent to 1.82 cents lower with July at
56.60 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Tuesday. The
markets were closed Wednesday for Independence Day.

<HEAD>Saturn Plant Adds Jobs But Raises Quality of Life Questions</HEAD>

   Author Peter Jenkins likes to tell the
story about how he walked across the country and picked Middle
Tennessee for his home.
   Then came the day he heard General Motors Corp. had decided to
build its biggest automobile plant a mile from his 150-acre farm.
   Neither he nor many Tennesseans are sure the impact from the
investment, which is costing GM at least $3 billion, is totally
welcome in the rolling hills and horse country, now facing
pressures ranging from overcrowded schools to new sources of
pollution.
   ``I look out my window at night and I see this red glow. They
keep the lights on there,'' Jenkins said in an interview.
   GM's Saturn Corp. plant, nearly complete, is expected to begin
sending cars to dealers nationwide any week now. But life in tiny
Spring Hill has long since changed.
   The solitude of Spring Hill, population 1,094, was shattered
first by news media publicizing the bucolic charm of the area, one
of several GM was considering as the home for what it hoped would
be the car of the future.
   Then came the speculators, who drove up the price of real estate
after GM's July 30, 1985, announcement that it had determined
Spring Hill was the ideal location.
   The company's first new nameplate since 1917 _ the compact will
compete primarily with the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla and cost
$10,000 to $12,000 _ will be built here by a combination of
Tennesseans and transplants from other GM factories, many of whom
were laid off in earlier cost-cutting drives.
   For many Tennesseeans, there is irony in GM's migration to their
state. Decades ago, during the Depression and war-boom years, the
migration mainly went the other way, as Tennesseeans moved north
seeking jobs in Detroit.
   Tennessee politicians were elated when GM announced it would
build a plant and hire 6,000 employees to produce a car line called
Saturn. That number has since been halved, but the financial impact
on the local economy has nonetheless been far-reaching.
   For example in Maury County, where the plant is based, $200
million has been spent for goods, services, salaries and taxes. GM
provided $1.25 million for a new Spring Hill city hall.
   At the same time, the impact of such a major new employer has
strained government services, especially public education. Maury
County school officials are building a new elementary school and
need about 30 new teachers to deal with 800 additional students _
an 8 percent increase in 1991 enrollment.
   ``The new elementary school, we believe, should relieve
overcrowding in the elementary grades,'' Maury County school
Superintendent Jerry Battles said. ``However, we expect a
continuing enrollment pressure at our middle school and high
school.''
   In addition, the influx of non-Tennesseeans has created greater
pressure to accomodate people from diverse cultural and ethnic
backgrounds, which center largely along the differences between
Southerners and Northerners.
   ``A lot of the automotive plants up North are in the downtown
area. So, those people may be urbanites and accustomed to a faster
pace of life than the people who live in the smaller towns in
Middle Tennessee,'' said Dan Cornfield, a sociology professor at
Vanderbilt University.
   ``There seems to be schisms between Northerners who've moved
down and Southerners who've lived here. They don't always share the
same lifestyles. So, you may get a segregation of people, not in
terms of race.''
   Almost half of the transplanted Saturn workers have settled in
Maury County, which includes Spring Hill and Columbia, the county
seat, the Maury County Chamber of Commerce has estimated.
   About a third moved north of Spring Hill in Williamson County,
an affluent bedroom community next to Nashville.
   For transplants and natives alike, the biggest drawback to GM's
arrival has been housing prices, which have multiplied and made it
difficult for many families to find affordable places to live.
   ``The cost of land came back down from the high, but it's still
higher than it was on announcement day,'' said Bill Chaffin, an
official of the Maury County Chamber of Commerce.
   ``We have crowded streets that fall under the heading of _ I
guess you'd say _ a problem. We've had a lot of interesting new
people move in, which is not a problem. We've had our anxieties of
growth.''
   That kind of anxiety is the last thing author Jenkins expected
when he'd finished ``Walk Across America.''
   ``I think that for those of us who live in Middle Tennessee _
not just Spring Hill _ when you have a corporation as strong and as
mighty as General Motors, we have to make sure we protect the
lifestyle we love, the pace of life and the quality of southern
lifestyle which I chose over any other lifestyle.
   ``We need to be vigilant _ and people tend to lose that sense of
vigilance _ before it's too late,'' he said.

   Stock prices showed a broad loss today after the
momentum of a week-long advance ran out.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 69.30 points over
the five sessions before the July 4 holiday on Wednesday, fell
28.71 to 2,882.92 by noontime on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 318 up, 956 down and
483 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to chase after the market's
recent rally, given widespread doubts about prospects for corporate
earnings in a sluggish economic environment.
   Earnings reports for the second quarter of the year are due in
large numbers over the next three weeks or so.
   A monthly report due from the Labor Department on Friday isn't
expected to dispal very many doubts about the business outlook.
   If the figures don't show significant new weakness in the job
market, analysts say, the Federal Reserve probably won't see any
reason to move immediately toward any relaxation of its credit
policy.
   Interest rates were little changed in the credit markets today.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down \ at
47}; Exxon, down { at 46~; General Electric, down { at 70|;
Bristol-Myers Squibb, down | at 63}, and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, down | at 38.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.81 to 194.80. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 1.70 at 358.97.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 61.81 million shares at

   Some offshore oil workers were returning to
work on the fifth day of a strike over wages, and Norwegian
petroleum production was up to half the normal level, the national
news agency NTB reported Thursday.
   Phillips Petroleum Co. of Norway said workers called off their
walkout at the Ekofisk fields, a key junction for pipeline
deliveries of natural gas to Europe. Production from some other
Norwegian North Sea fields is routed through Ekofisk to Britain and
West Germany.
   ``In theory production from all seven Ekofisk area fields can
begin on Thursday, within 12 to 16 hours'' said Sander
Bull-Gjertsen of Phillips. Ekofisk produced 220,000 barrels a day
of crude in April.
   About 4,000 workers went on strike Sunday when the Norwegian
Federation of Oil Workers and the Norwegian Confederation of
Business and Industry failed to reach agreement on demands for wage
increases and protection of jobs from automation.
   The government invoked compulsory arbitration, making the strike
illegal, on Monday. Officials said they acted to protect the
national economy.
   Phillips, meanwhile, dismissed several workers, sent lay-off
warnings to 161 people and flew in alternate crews.
   About 1,000 oil workers initially defied the government order
and appeals from the Norwegian Federation of Oil Workers union to
return to work. But the strike gradually lost support during the
week.
   Workers were reported on the job at fields besides Ekofisk
Thursday and the national oil industry association said ``there is
now a certain hope'' of the strike ending at additional fields.

   Lending by the World Bank, the biggest source
of aid to the Third World, has declined in the past 12 months for
the first time since 1985, the bank reported today. The decrease
was due partly to a reduction in loans to China after tanks rolled
into Tiananmen Square last year.
   Figures for the bank's year, which runs from July 1 to June 30,
were made public by Moeen A. Qureshi, a Pakistani who is the bank's
senior vice president for operations.
   New loans for the year just ended came to $20.7 billion. That
was $600 million less than the $21.3 billion of the year before.
   Loans to China dropped by more than $700 million falling to $590
million from $1.3 billion in the year before the suppression of the
democracy movement.
   Just after the Chinese government moved its military forces
against demonstrators, Bank President Barber Conable withdrew $780
million worth of loans for China from consideration.
   Then President Bush asked the bank to halt lending to China.
Later there was international agreement that new loans should be
limited to basic human needs.
   The past year also brought a large drop in World Bank lending to
India, where loans fell to $1.9 billion from $3 billion the year
before. But bank officials said that was a coincidence and not the
result of policy.
   Mexico displaced India as the biggest borrower, taking $2.6
billion compared with $2.2 billion in the previous year.
   Lending by the bank had been rising steadily, and is expected to
increase again in the next 12 months.
   The bank is now playing a much bigger role in what used to be
considered the ``Second World,'' European countries that have been
under communist rule.
   ``We have initiated lending to Poland for a total of some $780
million this fiscal year ... and have continued our programs in
Hungary,'' Qureshi said at a news conference last week.
   ``We are preparing support programs for Bulgaria and
Czechoslovakia, both of which are expected to become bank members
in the coming year, and are ready to resume our activities in
Romania.''
   The late Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu paid off almost
all Romania's debts but the country has remained among the bank's
151 member countries.
   The Soviet Union has never belonged. Treasury Secretary Nicholas
F. Brady spoke recently of creating some tie between the Soviets,
the bank and its sister organization, the International Monetary
Fund.
   The Soviets will be a member of the new European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, but for three years it will be able
to borrow only as much as it contributes in the form of paid-in
capital.

   The U.S. dollar strengthened in European trading
today, boosted by technical factors.
   Gold prices declined.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar recovered the previous
day's losses when traders bought the U.S. currency to cover short
positions. There was also some speculative buying of dollars.
   Dealers said the dollar also got a boost from cross-trading,
which saw it gain against the German and British currencies.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 151.00 Japanese yen from
Wednesday's 150.30 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at
150.50 yen.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7795, cheaper for buyers
than Wednesday's $1.7845.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
late rates included: 1.6497 German marks, up from 1.6467; 1.3990
Swiss francs, up from 1.3920; 5.5357 French francs, up from 5.5260;
1.8582 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8535; 1,210.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,207.75, and 1.1627 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1620.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.6540 West
German marks; 150.87 Japanese yen; 1.4020 Swiss francs, 1,214.00
Italian lire and 1.1626 Canadian dollars.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $359.75 a troy
ounce, down from $362.20. In Zurich the price was $359.50 bid, down
from $362.35. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold closed at $360.95 bid, up
from $357.55.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $4.88 a troy ounce, down
from $4.93.

<HEAD>Greyhound's Lead Bank Creditor Wants Bankruptcy Case Moved to
Dallas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for Greyhound Lines Inc.'s largest bank
creditor have asked that the bus company's bankruptcy case be moved
to Dallas.
   In a motion filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Brownsville,
attorneys for Security Pacific Business Credit Inc. accuse
Dallas-based Greyhound of ``forum-shopping'' in filing for
protection from creditors in Brownsville.
   ``The filing of these proceedings in Brownsville exemplifies ...
the use of the venue statue as a tactical weapon to unfairly
disadvantage creditors in this proceeding,'' the filing said.
   It notes that most of the expected witnesses either live or work
in the Dallas area, or can travel there with ease; and that the
company's records are in Dallas, as are attorneys for most of the
parties.
   It also says few of the company's debtors are in the Brownsville
area.
   Greyhound sought Chapter 11 protection on June 4, citing costs
associated with a violent strike by bus drivers. Greyhound's Eagle
Bus Manufacturing Co. Inc. subsidiary is located in Brownsville.
   Greyhound spokeswoman Liz Dunn said the company would oppose the
move.
   No hearing on the request has been set.
   Security Pacific Business Credit, an affiliate of Security
Pacific Corp., has a $147.2 million secured claim against Greyhound.
   An attorney for the main creditors' committee said the group has
not decided whether to oppose or support the change in venue.

<DATELINE>VIGO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joel Vazquez never thought independence in
Namibia would make any difference to his life as an ocean-roving
commercial Spanish fisherman. He soon found himself beached like a
trawler at low tide.
   When the new southern African nation was established in April,
it ordered the Spanish fleet, one of the Western world's largest,
to vacate the rich waters off the Namibian coast. The move idled
Vazquez's ``Ur Elza'' and 34 other trawlers, along with 1,500 crew
members.
   ``A fisherman with a true calling for the sea doesn't know what
to do when he faces life on land,'' said Vazquez, 36. The fishing
crisis could spell an end to his 13 years at sea.
   The ships forced from Namibia are part of the 175-vessel
deep-sea fleet that forms the heart of the Spanish fishing
industry. It directly employs 5,000 people and indirectly employs
an additional 45,000 canners, marketers, shipbuilders and suppliers.
   Ninety percent of the fleet is based in the jagged estuary of
Vigo of northeast Spain, the most important fishing port of the
12-nation European Community.
   Industry officials say much more of the fleet will be forced to
drop anchor indefinitely because other countries besides Namibia
have moved to evict foreign fleets from heavily fished breeding
grounds.
   Argentina began shutting out Spanish trawlers last year, and the
United States and Canada banned them from territorial waters in the
early 1980s. Morocco has restricted foreign fishing off the Saharan
banks, and Britain is limiting access to waters off the Falkland
Islands in the South Atlantic.
   Spain's commercial fishermen partly blame Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez for failing to challenge the increased protectionism. The
government says that's part of the price for Spain's membership in
the EC, which has given it less control over guarding the overseas
interests of many Spanish businesses.
   ``The result has been a growing economic depression for
Vigo-based ship owners and all related sectors,'' said Gloria Sio,
editor of the industry magazine Industrias Pesqueras.
   Sio said the presence of the idled ships in Vigo harbor
underscores what she called the administration's failure to control
public financing for new ships while fishing grounds kept
diminishing.
   ``Right now, there are at least 40 ships too many for the places
available to fish,'' Sio said.
   Statistics compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture's fishing
division show how the industry has become less productive and the
country more reliant on imports.
   In 1987, for example, the deep-sea fleet's catch totaled nearly
635,000 tons, vs. about 553,000 tons last year. Frozen-fish imports
have nearly tripled since 1984 to roughly 28,000 tons, while
exports have declined by more than 28 percent to roughly 25,000
tons.
   For now, the ministry has approved a plan to pay idled fisherman
their average monthly wage of about $600, with a stipend to cover
social security payments.
   The Namibian government says part of the reason for the eviction
order to the Spanish ships was to assess the productivity of
domestic breeding grounds that produce Hake, an important food fish.
   But the Namibians have said a study will take at least four
months, and they won't open negotiations on a new accord with the
Spanish until afterward.
   ``Our future is totally uncertain,'' said Jose Fuertes, managing
director of Spain's Hake Fishing Ship Owners Assocation.
   ``The administration has had plenty of time to see Namibian
independence coming and to reach a bilateral accord to permit
Spanish fishing, but it was just incompetent,'' he said.
   Unions and shipowners are outraged that Spain and the EC are not
fiercely defending the Spanish fleet's right to fish overseas.
   On May 31, 5,000 people marched through Vigo as the Citizens
Movement to Save the Fleet, with backing by politicians,
fishermen's unions, shipowners associations and chambers of
commerce. Gonzalez's Socialist party and the Socialist General
Workers Union were absent.
   Serafin Sa, spokesman for the Communist Fisherman's Union,
claimed EC Fishing Commissioner Manuel Marin, a Spanish Socialist,
has been inept in defending the interests of Spanish fishermen
against those of low-cost fishing nations such as the Soviet Union,
Romania and Poland and in foreign fishing banks, especially those
off Canada.
   ``The great irony is that while Spanish ships are being forced
out of foreign hake and cod banks from Canada to Argentina, these
countries are using basically protectionist measures in turn to
dominate our own EC markets,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The nation's Big Three automakers said Thursday
that late-June sales of North American-made vehicles rose 7.1
percent compared with last year, stoked by strong truck sales.
   For the first six months of the year, Big Three car and truck
sales were 6.3 percent behind last year. The six-month period
provides a better picture of the companies' sales than the 10-day
periods.
   This year's sales rate for domestic vehicles overall has been
meandering below last year's rate. Recent economic reports have
shown slow growth in the economy coupled with slightly weakened
consumer confidence.
   Those factors, along with automakers offering reduced incentive
packages compared with last year's, have combined to depress car
and truck sales overall.
   But strong sales of trucks by General Motors Corp. and Ford
Motor Co. bucked that trend in late June. Chrysler Corp.'s truck
sales lagged behind last year's pace.
   The Big Three said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate
of 39,716 during the June 21-30 period this year compared with a
rate of 37,084 during the same time last year.
   Car sales were up 3.7 percent and truck sales rose a hefty 12.8
percent in late June.
   For the first half of the year, Big Three car sales were off 9.8
percent and truck sales were down 1.6 percent compared with the
first six months of last year. Together, cars and trucks made by
the three companies were selling at an average daily rate of 33,025
through June of this year, compared with the 35,260 daily vehicle
sales average last year.
   GM was the only one of the Big Three to report gains in
late-June sales of cars and trucks. The nation's largest automaker
said its car sales during the period rose 12.9 percent and truck
sales increased 29.9 percent, for a combined 17.8 percent increase.
For the first half of 1990, GM's cars and trucks were selling at a
rate 3.5 percent lower than last year.
   Ford reported its combined car and truck sales for late June
were up 2.7 percent from last year's rate. A 4.7 percent decline in
car sales was offset by a 14.1 percent increase in truck sales,
mainly because of the new Explorer sport-utility vehicle. During
the first six months of this year, Ford's car and truck sales were
down 7.8 percent.
   Chrysler, which has been struggling all year with sagging sales,
reported an 11 percent decline in its vehicle sales in late June,
with car sales falling 10.8 percent and truck sales dropping 11.3
percent. So far this year, Chrysler's car and truck sales rate is
13 percent lower than last year.

   Stock prices took a downward turn today after
the momentum of a week-long advance ran out.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 69.30 points over
the five sessions before the July 4 holiday on Wednesday, dropped
37.13 to 2,874.50 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 1 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 347 up, 1,079 down
and 482 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to chase after the market's
recent rally, given widespread doubts about prospects for corporate
earnings in a sluggish economic environment.
   Earnings reports for the second quarter of the year are due in
large numbers over the next three weeks or so.
   A monthly report due from the Labor Department on Friday isn't
expected to dispal very many doubts about the business outlook.
   If the figures don't show significant new weakness in the job
market, analysts say, the Federal Reserve probably won't see any
reason to move immediately toward any relaxation of its credit
policy.
   Interest rates were little changed in the credit markets today.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down &rsqb; at
47|; Exxon, down | at 46}; General Electric, down 1 at 70&lsqb;, and
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down \ at 38&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.51 to 194.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 2.51 at 358.16.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 112.33 million shares with an
hour to go.

<DATELINE>STRATFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>

   It looks like something that should be
piloted by little green men from Mars, but Sikorsky Aircraft's
newest flying machine doesn't need anyone in the cockpit,
extra-terrestrial or otherwise.
   After four years of secret research, the helicopter pioneer has
unveiled the Cypher, its entry in the race to develop a pilotless
aircraft.
   The Cypher looks like two large ceiling fans bolted together to
form the spokes of a fiberglass doughnut. It's 5} feet in diameter
and weighs about 300 pounds, light enough to be carried by two
people.
   A mock-up sits inside a storage building at Sikorsky's
headquarters in Stratford, Conn. awaiting wind tunnel tests.
   Sikorsky, a division of United Technologies Corp., won't start
production until it receives orders for the Cypher.
   But company executives predict the aircraft, known in the
industry as an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle or UAV, will be a big hit
with military and civilian customers for reconnaissance missions,
search-and-rescues, fly-overs of forest fires and surveillance of
illicit drug operations.
   ``You can just use your imagination and think about Mount St.
Helens or Chernobyl, anywhere you want to get in without risking
life,'' said William Tuttle, a Sikorsky spokesman.
   The American military has used remote-control airplanes for
years, mostly as decoys to draw enemy fire away from planes with
pilots aboard. But Pentagon strategists have decided they need a
more versatile, helicopter-like aircraft that can take off and land
vertically and maneuver in inaccessible areas.
   ``If Custer had one of these UAVs, he might have won at Little
Big Horn,'' said Ray Coleman of the Pentagon's Joint Office for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.
   The office was established in 1988 to look at the most promising
vehicles. It invested a modest $160,000 in research on the Cypher
last year, although Congress has prohibited the office from
spending money on actual production.
   Work on the Cypher began in 1986 when Sikorsky was awarded an
eight-month study contract by the Pentagon's Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency. The company refused to discuss the actual
cost of Cypher, because of the intense competition for government
contracts.
   The Cypher uses technology developed by Sikorsky nearly two
decades ago for its XH-59A helicopter, which used a coaxial rotor
or double rotary blade to operate.
   The double blades rotate in opposite directions, giving the
craft greater stability, especially on takeoffs and landings. The
blades rotate within a fiberglass tube, where the Cypher's fuel and
payload are stored.
   The Cypher is controlled by a computer programmed before
takeoff, but its flight pattern can be altered after takeoff if
necessary, said James Cycon, Sikorsky's chief engineer for the
Cypher project.
   Sikorsky engineers say they're particularly proud of containing
the blades within a tube, because the innovation makes the Cypher
safer for people on the ground during takeoffs or landings. The
blades of competitors under development are exposed, like a
helicopter's.
   Cycon said the Cypher is designed to hover 8,000-10,000 feet in
the air for about four hours. It can carry a 150-pound payload,
such as a surveillance camera.
   The Cypher can be launched vertically from a small area, like
the deck of a patrol boat. Sikorsky also is studying the
possibility of launching Cypher from Black Hawk helicopters, which
it makes for the Army.
   Sikorsky first flew a radio-controlled, 5-foot-diameter version
of the Cypher in the summer of 1988 in West Palm Beach, Fla., to
prove it could actually fly using the coaxial rotor technology,
Cycon said.
   That vehicle has since been retired and is on display at
Sikorsky headquarters.
   During the design work for Cypher, Cycon kept a sign on his wall
that said, ``Time to make the doughnuts,'' and says his children
are still kidded about having a father who makes flying saucers.
   Cypher's success would allow Sikorsky to expand into new markets
in the face of defense cuts. The company has already been forced to
lay off about 300 of its 12,000 workers because of lower military
demand.
   But Sikorsky faces stiff competition in the field of pilotless
flight. A number of domestic and foreign companies are vying for
defense contracts and are further along in developing their
products, Coleman said.
   The Pentagon already has a contract with Canadair to conduct a
six-month test of that firm's CL227, or Peanut, he said. The
British company ML Aviation has developed a pilotless vehicle
called the Sprite, which resembles a flying barbecue grill.
   ``The unmanned air vehicle market is expected to grow
dramatically in the next 10 years,'' said Mark Bobbi of Forecast
International, an independent market research firm specializing in
aerospace and defense. ``But I don't think the Cypher will help
Sikorsky much in the next five years.''
   Sikorsky recently submitted information about the Cypher to the
Army, in hopes the Army will decide to order some vehicles so
production can begin.
   Larry Dickerson, another Forecast International analyst who is
watching the UAV industry, said Sikorsky's success will depend on
how it markets the Cypher.
   ``It's very new and looks different, but the military is pretty
conservative-minded about new and different things,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices fell sharply
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, led by steep losses in the
corn market after the National Weather Service predicted wetter
weather for the Midwest.
   Several contracts for delivery of new-crop corn plunged the
permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel, largely in reaction to
a six-to-10-day outlook issued Wednesday by the weather service.
   The forecast was for normal temperatures and above-normal
rainfall over most of the Corn Belt during the latter half of next
week.
   Some private forecasters continue to predict an extended period
of hot, dry weather in the southern Corn Belt.
   But analysts said the National Weather Service forecasts
typically take precedence over private forecasts in influencing the
market.
   ``When the National Weather Service comes out with that kind of
news, it kind of sets the tone for everybody,'' said Michael
Gazall, a research analyst with Refco Corp.
   At the close, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 5\ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.18\ a bushel; corn was 4
cents to 10 cents lower with July at $2.85} a bushel; oats were 4{
cents to 5{ cents lower with July at $1.35{ a bushel; soybeans were
7 cents to 23 cents lower with July at $6.29 a bushel.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Help-wanted advertising registered a lackluster
performance in May, indicating a cautious attitude among many
employers around the nation, the Conference Board reported Friday.
   The seasonally adjusted Help-Wanted Advertising Index, compiled
from a survey of ad volume in 51 newspapers across the country,
registered 137 in May, down 2 points from April and 15 points below
the year-ago level, the board said.
   ``The word `cautious' best describes the labor market right
now,'' said Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein. ``There is a
definite softness in demand: consumers, government and some
elements of business investment appear quite sluggish.''
   Most regions of the country _ particularly New England and the
middle Atlantic states _ registered declines in help-wanted ads,
and Goldstein noted that the drops show no sign of ending soon.
   But many southern states as well as parts of Texas and Oklahoma
registered gains.
   Goldstein said export-driven economic growth is expected to
boost labor markets in the West later this year and then sweep
eastward.
   Ad volume has proven to be sensitive to labor market conditions
and helps gauge changes in the local, regional and national supply
of jobs.

   The dollar closed moderately higher on world
currency markets Thursday in light and uneventful trading.
   Gold prices fell. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold bullion
for current delivery traded at $361.40 a troy ounce, off 70 cents
from late Tuesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late
bid for gold at $360.50, off 50 cents.
   U.S. financial markets were closed Wednesday in observance of
Independence Day.
   Traders in the United States and Europe attributed the dollar's
rise to technical factors. Lou Calvello, a trader with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said several dealers were buying
dollars to square up their positions ahead of Friday's release of
unemployment data for June.
   The market has been anticipating the Labor Department's report
for several days. ``Hopefully it will spark some activity,'' said
Jim Chorek, an analyst with MMS International in Chicago.
   Trading was particularly thin, with many U.S. investors absent
from the market as they extended their Fourth of July holiday,
dealers said.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 151.00 Japanese yen from
Wednesday's 150.30 yen. Later in London, the dollar traded lower at
150.50 yen. But in New York, the dollar closed higher at 150.57 yen.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.7795, cheaper for buyers
than Wednesday's $1.7845. In New York, it cost $1.7815 to buy one
pound.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.6497 German marks, up from 1.6467;
1.3990 Swiss francs, up from 1.3920; 5.5357 French francs, up from
5.5260; 1.8582 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8535; 1,210.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,207.75, and 1.1627 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1620.
   In New York the dollar settled at 1.6517 West German marks;
1.3998 Swiss francs; 5.5430 French francs; 1,212.00 Italian lire,
and 1.1640 Canadian dollars.
   Gold prices fell after rising in Asia. Gold traded in London at
a late bid price of $359.75 a troy ounce, down from $362.20. In
Zurich the price was $359.50 bid, down from $362.35. Earlier in
Hong Kong, gold closed at $360.95 bid, up from $357.55.
   Silver prices slipped. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.869 a troy ounce, down from
Tuesday's $4.919. In London the metal traded at a late bid price of
$4.88 a troy ounce, down from $4.93.

   Energy futures prices finished lower but above
the session's bottom levelsThursday after prices recovered amid
renewed buying.
   Trading was slow on the New York Mercantile Exchange with many
market participants still absent after the mid-week holiday break.
Markets and many businesses were closed Wednesday for Independence
Day.
   The contract for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate
slumped 30 cents to $16.50 per 42-gallon barrel, resuming the slide
that was temporarily interrupted by Tuesday's 8-cent gain.
Contracts for delivery during September through November also
posted losses.
   Crude prices headed downward early in the day due to selling
motivated in part by resolution of a strike that disrupted oil
output from the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. A bearish supply
and demand report from the American Petroleum Institute late
Tuesday also provided a selling incentive.
   But the August contract rebounded from its low point of below
$16.30 a barrel when buyers looking for bargains entered the market.
   Among refined products traded on the New York Merc, unleaded
gasoline for August delivery slid 1.14 cents to 54.95 cents a
gallon after losing 0.59 cent on Tuesday. Later contracts also
settled lower.
   Wholesale home heating oil for August delivery settled at 48.33
cents a gallon, off 0.13 cent. The contract fell 0.10 cent Tuesday.
The September through November contracts declined also.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract fell to $1.514 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.525 Tuesday. It was $1.519 on Monday.

   Stock prices lapsed into a broad decline
Thursday after the momentum of a week-long advance ran out.
   Trading was light, as expected, throughout the postholiday
session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 69.30 points over
the last five sessions before Independence Day on Wednesday,
dropped back 32.42 to 2,879.21.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
397 up, 1,058 down and 495 unchanged.
   Analysts said traders were reluctant to chase after the market's
recent rally, given widespread doubts about prospects for corporate
earnings in a sluggish economic environment.
   Earnings reports for the second quarter of the year are due in
large numbers over the next three weeks or so.
   A monthly report due from the Labor Department on Friday isn't
expected to dispal very many doubts about the business outlook.
   If the figures don't show significant new weakness in the job
market, analysts say, the Federal Reserve probably won't see any
reason to move immediately toward any relaxation of its credit
policy.
   Interest rates were slightly higher in the credit markets
Thursday. Prices of long-term government bonds fell about $2.50 for
each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.40
percent-8.45 percent range.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 128.32 million
shares, against 130.05 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 153.23 million shares.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down { at
47{; Exxon, down | at 46}; General Electric, down ~ at 70\; Boeing,
down { at 59\, and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down { at 38&lsqb;.
   Auto stocks were weak. General Motors dropped 1&lsqb; to 47\; Ford
Motor 1 to 44, and Chrysler \ to 15\.
   Genentech rose { to 29 and Eli Lilly gained 1{ to 86\. A group
of researchers in Milwaukee said a study suggested that some
characteristics of phsyical aging in men could be reversed with a
growth hormone made by the two companies.
   Microcom, traded in the over-the-counter market, tumbled 2| to
6&lsqb;. Late Tuesday the company revised downward the earnings it
reported for its last fiscal year, and increased its estimate of
the loss it expects for the quarter ended June 30.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $36.23 billion, or 1.05
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.16 to 194.45.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.82 to 418.89, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 4.48 at 355.68.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 2.57 to 459.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 358.49, down 2.18.

   Strong sales of North American-made light trucks
and Japanese cars assembled in the United States pushed the
late-June vehicle sales rate 11.9 percent higher than last year,
automakers said Thursday.
   However, sales for the entire month, with imported cars and
trucks included, were 1.9 percent behind last year's pace. Car and
truck sales for the first six months of this year were 4.3 percent
lower than last year.
   The 10 major U.S. car and truck makers reported they sold
vehicles at an average daily rate of 46,293 during the June 21-30
period this year compared with a rate of 41,372 during the same
period last year.
   Car sales by General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. rose 3.7 percent while sales of U.S.-made Japanese cars
increased 62.3 percent. The Big Three commanded 80.7 percent of the
market during the period.
   Truck sales by GM, Ford and Chrysler rose 12.7 percent over last
year.
   Economist Tom Webb of the National Automobile Dealers
Association in McLean, Va., said the late-June numbers don't
necessarily reflect a change in the sluggish trend of the U.S. auto
market this year.
   He said the assessment could change if the next two or three
sales periods unexpectedly maintain the pace set in late June.
   Webb said he was surprised at the vigor in the late-June truck
sales figures for GM and Ford.
   ``The strength you see in the truck model is the APV (minivans)
for General Motors and the Explorer (sport-utility vehicle) for
Ford,'' he said. GM's light truck sales during the period rose 29.9
percent and Ford's increased 14.1 percent. Chrysler's fell 10.8
percent.
   ``June ended strong for GM with car and truck sales up,'' said
J.B. Fitzpatrick, GM's marketing and product planning staff vice
president. ``Our lower inventory position should provide for a
smooth transition into the 1991 model year.''
   GM was the only one of the Big Three to post a gain in late-June
sales of its domestically made cars, increasing 12.9 percent over
last year based on double-digit increases in sales from its two
largest divisions, Chevrolet and Pontiac.
   Ford's car sales dropped 4.7 percent during the period and
Chrysler, which has been struggling with sluggish car sales for
months, reported an 11.3 percent decline in late-June sales.
   Among the Japanese ``transplants,'' only Nissan Motor Co. Ltd.'s
U.S.-made cars showed a decrease in late June, falling 19.9 percent.
   The auto industry has been plagued recently by a sluggish U.S.
economy and reports of sagging consumer confidence. Automakers use
incentives to spark sales and reduce inventories of unsold new
vehicles, but lately they've been shying away from wholesale use of
the enticements.
   Incentives, whether cash rebates or low-interest loan offers,
carve into companies' profits and can create price confusion in the
market. Consequently, the programs offered now cover fewer vehicles
than programs last year and generally offer consumers lower rebates
and less attractive financing deals.
   Also, inventories are estimated to be in the 60-selling-day
range, considered a good level for this time of year. Each of the
Big Three recently announced modest price increases.

<HEAD>Visa, Mastercard, File Major Suit Against Nationwide Telemarketers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The largest telemarketing fraud ever
uncovered by Visa and Mastercard recruited small businesses to
launder credit card charges, the companies contend in a
multimillion-dollar lawsuit unsealed Thursday.
   Federal criminal investigations also are under way in the case,
described as a chain of operations conducting business nationwide
from bases in Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and other states.
   The suit says the scam began with postcards telling consumers
they had won free cars, watches or $5,000 prizes. When they phoned
they reached ``boiler rooms'' and were pressured to buy water
purifiers, security systems, travel packages and vitamins, it says.
   The defendants claimed that winners' identities were verified
through their credit card numbers. The defendants also implied that
Visa and Mastercard sponsored the giveaways, the suit says.
   The suit also alleges the telemarketers misrepresented goods,
failed to deliver them and sent multiple bills for the same product.
   ``Defendants' scheme undermines a cornerstone of the charge card
system: that member financial institutions be able to evaluate the
honesty, integrity and credit worthiness of those from whom they
accept charge card deposits,'' Visa and Mastercard said in the suit
in Los Angeles federal court.
   The suit seeks unspecified millions of dollars in actual damages
and $10 million in punitive damages, alleging racketeering, fraud,
trademark infringement and interfering with contractual
relationships.
   ``It's the largest single telemarketing operation that Visa and
Mastercard ever came across,'' said Visa spokesman David Brancoli.
   He estimated such schemes cost the companies up to $200 million
per year. Federal Trade Commission officials believe consumers have
lost $1 billion a year to telemarketing fraud for the past five
years.
   A central aim of the suit is to stop boiler room operators from
using third parties to process sales drafts. Banks usually won't
set up Visa and Mastercard accounts for telephone sales operations
because too many customers refuse to pay, leaving the banks holding
the bag, the suit says.
   The suit alleges that some defendants were ``brokers'' who
advertised in newspapers like the Los Angeles Times for businesses
to launder sales drafts for a fee, typically 6 percent of sales.
   Counting broker fees, telemarketers may pay 20 percent or more
of the gross sales to have their drafts deposited, said Daniel H.
Bookin, a San Francisco attorney for Visa and Mastercard.
   That compares to 2 percent to 3 percent at legitimate businesses
with merchant accounts at banks.
   ``If these guys couldn't launder, they'd be out of business,''
Bookin said.
   Visa and Mastercard persuaded U.S. District Judge Edward
Rafeedie last week to issue a temporary restraining order barring
the telemarketers from using third parties to process credit card
drafts. A hearing on a permanent injunction is set for July 16.
   The Postal Service and the Secret Service are conducting
criminal probes, according to the suit and one of the defendants,
Lorraine G. Doty.
   ``This thing is much bigger than what is laid out in this
lawsuit,'' Ms. Doty said in a telephone interview from Florida.
   Ms. Doty said she and another defendant, Lillian Whitman, had
shut down their boiler room operation in Clearwater, Fla., after
learning that using third parties to process sales drafts violated
credit card agreements with banks. She declined further comment,
saying she hadn't talked to a lawyer.
   A central defendant is Donald Gaines of Clearwater, who the
complaint accuses of running boiler rooms and, through a Phoenix
business, acting as a broker for small businesses willing to
launder charges.
   Reached at another business in Overland, Kan., Gaines declined
comment, saying he had not seen the lawsuit.
   Altogether, the suit names 10 individuals and 11 companies as
defendants.
   ``We have documented $4 million in losses, but we're sure the
total is far larger,'' Bookin said.
   Processing of third-party sales drafts is outlawed in only three
states: California, Florida and Wisconsin. There is no federal law
against it, although abuses can be prosecuted under other federal
statutes such as mail fraud and wire fraud.
   Mastercard and Visa have joint programs to warn businesses that
laundering is banned by their agreements with banks and to detect
the practice. They also are jointly lobbying to have such
laundering made a federal crime.

   Assets of the nation's 513 money market mutual
funds fell $2.24 billion in the latest week to $382.70 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$444.9 million decline the previous week, according to the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group .
   Fund assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week ended
March 21, 1990.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 250
general purpose funds fell $723.9 million to $133.21 billion,
assets of 102 broker-dealer funds dropped $1.29 billion to $157.88
billion, and assets of 161 institutional funds declined $222.8
million to $91.61 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.68 percent from 7.67 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield was unchanged at 7.67 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
45 days, up from 44 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.16 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.18 percent a week earlier. The North Palm Beach,
Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on
special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, was unchanged
at 5.04 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.91
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the
previous week. Yields were 8.10 percent on 1-year CDs, unchanged;
8.10 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and 8.17 percent on 5-year
CDs, unchanged.

   Rite Aid Corp., charged along with its
president with trying to bribe a state pharmacy board member, was
singled out and badgered by Ohio regulators, the company's attorney
charged before a jury Thursday.
   Attorney George Moscarino contended the Ohio State Board of
Pharmacy had a vendetta against Rite Aid and launched a flawed
investigation into the bribery claim. He said the panel had become
angry over Rite Aid's questioning of certain drugstore rules.
   ``There was a (pharmacy board) blitz of only the Rite Aid
stores,'' Moscarino said in opening statements in Cuyahoga County
Common Pleas Court. ``The evidence will show they were peeved at
Rite Aid.''
   An indictment unsealed in August charged Rite Aid and President
Martin L. Grass, 36, with trying to bribe Melvin Wilczynski, a
voting member of the pharmacy board. The indictment included a
charge against Grass of possession of a criminal tool, an aircraft
he used to fly to Cleveland for the alleged deal.
   Prosecutors say Grass on April 27, 1989, gave Wilczynski a check
for $33,000 with the stipulation that he step down from the board.
   Prosecutors say the company was trying to pack the board, whose
members are appointed by the governor, with members to its liking.
   Rite Aid, based in Shiremanstown, Pa., and one of the nation's
biggest drugstore chains, has denied the charges, saying the
corporate check was a legal buyout of Wilczynski's consulting
contract with a troubled chain that Rite Aid acquired.
   Assistant Cuyahoga County Prosecutor William Caine said Thursday
that Wilczynski, a licensed pharmacist and still a member of the
board, was surprised to learn that Rite Aid planned to buy out his
contract with Lane Drug Co., a Peoples Drug Store Inc. division
Rite Aid acquired last year.
   Caine said Wilczynski was summoned to Rite Aid offices in Toledo
and told by Grass that the company wanted him to resign from the
pharmacy board. When Wilczynski told Grass he wanted to remain,
Caine said, Grass' response was, ``You're out in left field.''
   ``I think it's very telling in this whole transaction that, as
Mr. Grass sat there in this small room ... he couldn't look Mel
Wilczynski in the eye,'' Caine said.
   Prosecutors said they will show a videotape, made secretly with
Wilczynski's cooperation, showing Grass handing Wilczynski a check
and copies of resignation letters for him to sign.
   The videotape was made at a hotel near Cleveland's airport,
prosecutors said.
   The government said it seized the undated, variously-worded
resignation letters to Gov. Richard Celeste, among other documents,
during Grass' arrest in the hotel room.

   Corn and soybean futures prices wilted Thursday on the Chicago
Board of Trade after the National Weather Service issued a rainy
forecast for the Midwest.
   Wheat and oat futures also fell but not as steeply as corn and
beans, which are grown mainly in the Midwest and would benefit from
additional moisture.
   On other commodity markets, most oil futures fell; copper
futures advanced; precious metals were lower; and livestock and
meat futures were mixed.
   Corn futures settled 4{ cents to 10 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $2.86 a bushel; soybeans were 7
cents to 23 cents lower with July at $6.28{ a bushel; Wheat was 1{
cents to 5\ cents lower with July at $3.18\ a bushel; oats were 4{
cents to 5{ cents lower with July at $1.35{ a bushel.
   Most contracts for delivery of new-crop corn plunged the
permitted daily limit of 10 cents a bushel, largely in reaction to
a six-to-10-day outlook issued Wednesday by the weather service.
   The forecast was for normal temperatures and above-normal
rainfall over most of the Corn Belt during the the latter half of
next week.
   The losses wiped out gains that had mounted over the past week
in reaction to predictions, mostly by private meteorologists, that
a pattern of unusually warm, dry air was setting up in the Corn
Belt.
   Some private forecasters continued to predict an extended period
of hot, dry weather in the Mississippi Delta region, where some
soybeans are grown.
   ``There's enough conflict out there to satisfy the bulls and the
bears,'' said Michael Gazall, a research analyst with the
commodities brokerage Refco Inc.
   ``But when the National Weather Service comes out with this kind
of news, it kind of sets the tone for everybody,'' he said.
   Walter Spilka, grain analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co., said the forecast provided an opportunity for profit-taking.
   ``The bottom line is probably that those traders who were buying
in anticipation of a weather event now are selling in anticipation
of a non-event,'' he said.
   Oil futures finished mostly lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange in the first trading day since Tuesday's bearish petroleum
stocks report from the American Petroleum Institute. The markets
were closed Wednesday for Independence Day.
   The API report showed an unexpected 429,000-barrel increase last
week in U.S. crude oil stocks. Traders had expected crude stocks to
fall by about 1 million barrels.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 30 cents lower to 6
cents higher with August at $16.50 a barrel; heating oil was .08
cent to .23 cent lower with August at 48.33 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.14 cents lower to .10 cent higher with
August at 54.95 cents a gallon.
   Copper futures rose strongly on New York's Commodity Exchange as
troubles mounted at copper mines in various locations.
   Prices spurted higher early in the session following news of an
explosion at a Chilean Copper Co. mine in Chile that was expected
to decrease production by 20,000 metric tons this year.
   Meanwhile, a strike at Asarco Inc.'s Ray copper mine in Arizona
stretched into its fifth day Thursday, and unionized miners in Peru
opened a three-day national assembly to discuss a possible strike
against Peruvian mining companies.
   Copper futures settled 1.9 cents to 2.95 cents higher with July
at $1.171 a pound.
   Gold and silver futures slipped on the Commodity Exchange,
giving back some of the moderate gains posted over the past five
sessions.
   Gold futures finished 80 cents to $1.10 lower with July at
$363.30 a troy ounce; silver futures were 5 cents to 6.1 cents
lower with July at $4.869 a troy ounce.
   Hog futures climbed sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
amid a combination of higher cash prices and bullish chart signals.
Near-term pork bellies fell sharply on signs of burdensome
supplies. Cattle futures were mixed.
   Live cattle ended .28 cent lower to .25 cent higher with August
at 73.02 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent to .62 cent
higher with August at 83.87 cents a pound; hogs were .20 cent to
.98 cent higher with July at 62.65 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .33 cent higher to the limit 1.5 cents lower with July
at 56.17 cents a pound.

   World Bank President Barber Conable on
Thursday urged the United States and other creditor nations to
reduce debts owed them by Poland and other ``middle income''
countries.
   The bank, the world's biggest source of aid to developing
nations, considers the middle income countries as ranging from
Bolivia, where the average citizen earns about $570 a year, to a
country like Greece, where the average annual income is $4,800.
Poland's per capita income is about $2,750 a year.
   ``Poland's debt situation must be dealt with in some way,''
Conable said, noting that Poland is nearly $45 billion in debt.
   ``Clearly the debt service ... would make it very difficult for
Poland to resume growth and to make the necessary investments for
getting a functioning economy with moving parts,'' he said.
   ``Debt service'' refers to payments of interest and principal.
   Most Polish debt is owed to governments, with West Germany and
France the biggest creditors. About $3 billion is owed to the U.S.
government's Export-Import Bank and Commodity Credit Corp.
   The World Bank has lent Poland $780 million in the past 12
months. Conable said that was done on the assumption that some
international settlement would be made on the remainder of Poland's
official debt.
   He said the debt burden makes it difficult for such countries to
lure the investment they need to raise standards of living. Their
own earnings go to keep up with the debt and foreign investors are
wary as long as the burden exists.
   He noted that President Bush last week suggested that help with
official debt be given in Latin America.
   ``Clearly there are middle income countries elsewhere and other
creditors besides the United States which must addresses this
issue,'' he said.
   ``We hope it will be discussed at Houston and ... it will be
constructive if something could be worked out.''
   Bush and leaders of six other major industrial countries hold
their annual economic summit in Houston beginning Monday.
   Conable mentioned Eastern European countries, North Africa,
Nigeria and the Ivory Coast as candidates for help. He pointed out
that there already has been considerable reduction of official debt
for the poorest countries _ especially in Africa _ and that a plan
pressed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady deals with debts to
commercial banks.
   The World Bank estimates that of $1.039 trillion worth of
long-term debt owed by Third World countries, $517 billion comes
from official sources. That includes tens of billions owed to the
World Bank itself, which Conable did not discuss.
   He suggested that government creditors might offer help of the
same kind they have given the poorest countries. These ``Toronto
terms,'' named after the city where creditor governments agreed on
them, include reduction in total debt, reduction of interest
payments, and a long stretch-outs of repayments.

   Federal regulators on Thursday ordered
President Bush's son, Neil, to appear at a public hearing to
explain why as a savings and loan officer he approved loans to a
business partner.
   Administrative charges of conflict of interest against the
president's son will be taken up at the September hearing,
regulators said.
   The loans to business partner Bill L. Walters and purchases of
property from him totaled more than $100 million, according to the
Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   At the time of the transactions, the younger Bush was a director
of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association in Denver.
   Bush in a reply denied that he had violated his duty as a
director. He denied a number of specific charges and said in
response to others that he ``lacks sufficient present knowledge or
information to form a belief as to the allegations.''
   The administrative charges filed in February and Bush's reply a
month later both were made public for the first time Thursday under
a new thrift office policy. The House Banking Committee released a
preliminary draft of the charges in June.
   An administrative law judge is scheduled to hear the Bush case
Sept. 25 in Denver before making a recommendation to thrift office
director Timothy Ryan.
   James Nesland, an attorney for the younger Bush, said a public
hearing could be exploited for political purposes but expressed
confidence that the judge would render a fair opinion.
   ``I think it's unfortunate if it creates a political sideshow or
a media sideshow, but I'm still confident the administrative law
judge will decide the case on its merits,'' he said.
   Separately, the thrift office announced it was seeking a record
$24 million in restitution and civil penalties from the former
chairman of Columbia Savings and Loan Association of Beverly Hills,
Calif.
   The office alleged that Thomas Spiegel spent millions of the
thrift's eposits on limousines, corporate jets, luxury condominiums
in resort areas, trips to Europe for himself, $7,000 in tickets to
a Michael Jackson concert and a $55,000 gun collection, including
Uzi submachine guns.
   Spiegel, a close associate of former Drexel Burnham junk bond
chief Michael Milken, built Columbia into one of the nation's
largest thrifts and the industry's biggest holder of junk bonds,
with $3.7 billion at the end of 1989.
   Columbia is still operating, but analysts predict it eventually
will be seized by the government. Spiegel stepped down in December.
   Edward Harshfield, Columbia's current chief executive, said in a
statement that the institution's current management cooperated with
the thrift office and said the allegations do not reflect on
current management or the institution as a whole.
   Spiegel, meanwhile, denied the charges and accused the agency of
waging a politically-motivated ``trial by press release.''
   Bush served on the board of Silverado from August 1985 to August
1988. It collapsed in December 1988 at an estimated cost to
taxpayers of $1 billion. He has denied any wrongdoing.
   The charges said Bush as a director of Silverado voted to
approve loans totaling $45 million to Walters, an investor in and
lender to Bush's oil exploration company, JNB Exploration Co. He
also voted to approve Silverado's purchase of $58.4 million in
properties from Walters, the document said.
   The thrift office also said Bush inadequately disclosed his ties
to Kenneth Good, a developer who defaulted on loans to Silverado.
   Ryan will decide after reviewing the administrative hearing on
the case whether or not to issue a cease-and-desist order against
Bush prohibiting him from violating regulations in the future.
   The agency is not seeking any more serious penalties, such as
financial restitution or banning Bush from working for a bank or
S&amp;L.
   From now on, the agency generally will release charges and
conduct hearings in public for the officers of thrifts already
closed or seized by the government. In order to avoid the danger of
depositor runs, proceedings against open S&amp;Ls generally will
continue to be conducted in private, Ryan told a news conference.
   ``The public has a major stake in the cleanup of the thrift
industry, and as a general rule I believe it is reasonable to make
enforcement proceedings open when dealing with government
controlled thrifts,'' Ryan said.
   He said he offered Treasury Department officials a chance to
offer advice on the policy, but they declined.
   The documents on three other unrelated cases also were released.

<HEAD>Judge Says National Intergroup's Poison Pill Has To Go Before
Shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National Intergroup Inc. said Thursday it
would appeal a Delaware judge's ruling that shareholders must be
allowed to vote on changes in the company's anti-takeover
provisions.
   National Intergroup amended its poison pill strategy in January,
diluting the voting power and market value of its shares for
investors who own more than 10 percent of the company. The
threshold had stood at 20 percent.
   Vice Chancellor Maurice Hartnett of Delaware's Chancery Court on
Tuesday said National Intergroup acted improperly and called the 10
percent limit ``extremely low.''
   Hartnett said National Intergroup's board must present the
changes to the stockholders at its July 25 meeting in Pittsburgh.
   The ruling is a boost to Centaur Partners, a New York
partnership that owns 16.53 percent of National Intergroup, and
Walker Street, another partnership that owns 8.4 percent of the
company.
   Centaur Partners, which earlier this year tried unsuccessfully
to gain control of National Intergroup's board, and Walker Street
had brought the court action against the company.
   National Intergroup issued a statement saying they would appeal
the decision. The company said lowering the threshold was ``a
necessary and appropriate response to the threat to shareholders
posed by Centaur's acquisition program.''
   National Intergroup, formerly the majority owner of National
Steel Corp., has announced the sale of most of its metals and other
businesses, leaving behind its drug distribution company. Last
month, National Intergroup announced it would change its name to
FoxMeyer Corp., the name of its drug company and move to Dallas.

<HEAD>Judge Rejects Partial Verdict in Futures Traders Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday rejected a partial
verdict in the fraud and racketeering trial of three commodities
traders and directed the jury to continue their deliberations.
   In the ninth day of their deliberations, the jurors sent U.S.
District Judge Ann C. Williams a note saying they had reached
verdicts on some of the counts, and were deadlocked on the others.
   ``We feel further deliberations would be unproductive,'' wrote
Benita Engledinger, the jury's foreman.
   After 20 minutes of discussion among lawyers at the judge's
bench, Williams brought the jurors into the courtroom and told
them, ``You must continue your deliberations.''
   The jury was weighing charges against Robert M. Mosky, 34, Danny
L. Scheck, 28, and David Zatz, 43. Mosky is a Chicago Mercantile
Exchange floor broker portrayed by prosecutors as the leader of a
fraud scheme in the Merc's Swiss franc futures trading pit.
   He is the only defendant charged with racketeering.
   The Swiss franc traders were the first to stand trial on charges
stemming from a continuing FBI probe of corruption at the Merc and
the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's biggest commodity markets.
   The jury began deliberating June 22 after nearly seven weeks of
testimony.
   Mosky's lawyer, Elliott Samuels, said the prolonged
deliberations were wearing on the defendants and their lawyers.
   ``It's tough. It's hard on the nerves,'' said Samuels.
   The defendants were accused of shifting their personal losses
from trading errors into their customers' accounts, then hiding
their practices by changing or destroying trading records.
   Mosky, Scheck and Zatz were charged last August with more than a
dozen counts each of mail or wire fraud, and violations of the
Commodity Exchange Act. Each count carries a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a $150,000 fine.
   If convicted of racketeering conspiracy, Mosky faces a maximum
prison term of 20 years. He also could be forced to forfeit
personal assets.

<HEAD>Mazda To Begin Marketing Cars in East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mazda Motor Co. will begin selling cars in East
Germany this fall, opening about 50 dealerships in East Berlin,
company officials said Friday.
   Following similar moves by Japan's other large auto
manufacturers, Mazda said it plans to sell between several hundred
and 1,000 cars this year.
   Officials said that already more than 500 East Germans have
applied for dealership contracts.
   Nissan Motor Co. announced late last month that it intended to
open between 60 and 70 dealer outlets in East Germany by the end of
1990.
   Toyota Motor Co., Japan's largest car manufacturer, and
Mitsubishi Motor Co. have also indicated that they plan to begin
marketing their vehicles in East Germany.
   Though car sales in East Germany totaled a modest 195,000
vehicles in 1989, potential demand is very strong as East Germany
moves toward economic and political unification with West Germany,
company officials said. Japanese automakers estimate 1990 sales in
the East at around 350,000 vehicles.
