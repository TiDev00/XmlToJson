   Two members of a religious cult avoided
prison terms Friday for their roles in helping to conceal the
slayings of a family of five last year.
   Dennis Patrick and his wife, Tonya, got 18 months in prison, 90
days in jail and one year probation, but the prison terms were
suspended and they were given credit for jail time already served.
   Judge James W. Jackson said Patrick must continue the counseling
he is receiving along with his wife and their 10-year-old daughter,
Molly.
   ``We're very happy, very much relieved with the sentence that
was given,'' Patrick said. ``This has been a real tragedy in the
lives of many people.''
   In a separate courtroom, Mrs. Patrick wept as she read a
statement to Judge Martin O. Parks.
   She said she had been afraid to notify authorities about the
murders of Dennis and Cheryl Avery and their three daughters
because cult leader Jeffrey Lundgren told her he would kill her
daughter if she did not cooperate.
   Investigators said Lundgren, who admitted to shooting the
Averys, at one time also intended to kill the Patricks.
   The Patricks said they still feared Lundgren, who last month was
sentenced to death.
   The couple pleaded guilty last month to one count each of
obstruction of justice. Prosecutors had reduced their original
charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated murder.
   During testimony, witnesses said Patrick helped dig the pit
under the Kirtland barn where the Averys were killed and buried in
April 1989. He said he was told the pit was to be used for
baptisms.
   Mrs. Patrick testified that Lundgren forced her to become his
``captive wife'' and live with him in his tent when the cult
members moved to the wilderness in West Virginia after the
slayings.
   Prosecutor Steven LaTourette said the Patricks should have
revealed the murders to FBI agents who came to the farm the day
after the killing. The agents questioned cult members about rumors
that they were planning to take over the Kirtland Temple of the
Reorganized Church of Latter Day Saints by killing its leaders.
   Lundgren's wife, Alice, is serving five consecutive life
sentences in prison for complicity in the murders.
   The Lundgrens' son, Jeffrey, must serve at least 120 years in
prison for his conviction on four counts of aggravated murder in
the deaths of four of the Averys. He was acquitted in Cheryl
Avery's death.

   Fred L. Hartley, whose push for innovation
and alternative energy boosted Unocal Corp. from a small oil
company to an international conglomerate, died Friday. He was 73.
   Hartley, the first to hold the chairman emeritus title, died at
his Palos Verdes Estates home after a long illness, said spokesman
Mike Thacher.
   ``Mr. Hartley was a creative engineer, an executive of vision
and a man of great integrity who led Unocal for a quarter
century,'' said Unocal chairman Richard J. Stegemeier.
   Hartley, a chemical engineer, joined Unocal in 1939. As a
research engineer at the refinery in Los Angeles he helped design,
patent and run numerous petroleum processing plants.
   Hartley once sparred with raider T. Boone Pickens.
   In 1985, after a three-month skirmish, Pickens surrendered a
takeover battle against Unocal and agreed to sell his stock back to
the company at a slight loss.
   It was Pickens' first defeat in three years of assaults on big
oil firms.
   In 1953, Hartley proposed a program to sell and license Unocal
technology to other companies. He became vice president of research
in 1956, senior vice president four years later and president and
chief executive by 1964.
   He became chairman a decade later and served as a director until
his death.
   Hartley is best known for worldwide licensing of Unicracking, a
process that converts heavy, sulfur-filled crude oil components
into high-grade transportation fuels. He was a strong advocate of
alternative energy sources, including oil shale and geothermal
power.

   Rei Kawakubo at Comme des Garcons is being saluted
for a summer ready-to-wear show keyed to wearability. Some think it
was her prettiest ever.
   When a way-out designer like Kawakubo goes straight, the results
might be boring or pretty.
   There was a little bit of both in this show Thursday, as some of
Kawakubo's minimalist styles - simple gray chiffon tunics over
tights or lean jumpsuits - looked cool and wearable, though not
exciting.
   However, she presented some stunningly attractive numbers: a
whole line of white heavy-lace guipure jackets and jumpsuits or
simple V-necked dresses to the knee. They were terribly appealing
for summer.
   Her most beautiful idea of all was in the cathedral-window silk
prints. Lightly veiled in chiffon, the slim pants, tunics and
skirts glowed with the colors and motifs like the rose or lunette
windows of Chartres.
   Another Japanese going for prettier commercial ideas was Yohji
Yamamoto. He threw in some of his usual black or navy ideas, with a
tad of asymmetry.
   But with little flared shorts and jersey tank tops or A-line
short tunics, the effect was quite perky.
   Yamamoto went in for some color over black body stockings or
catsuits - beautiful in royal blue or emerald cotton crochet
tunics, jackets, or cap sleeves. He often tied the crochet work on
with satin ribbons, a fun new idea if perhaps a bit complicated for
dressing.
   White and black were worked in with similar tying on of various
sleeves, cowls, collars and skirt shapes - sometimes in stiffened
white linen with drawstrings.
   Pantsuits often came out with cutouts and asymmetrical details -
perhaps a shoulder wrap turning into a criss-cross sleeve feature.
   The sculpted or ``crimped-paper'' effect, effect, however,
looked more suited to the runway than to a traveling woman today.
   The Japanese clothes had a figure-hiding side to them -
concealing the body with the panels, the tunics, the lace.
   Angelo Tarlazzi, on the other hand, spared the body nothing. His
collection was angled for the youthful figure with tiny, clinging
stretch mini-suits, or leg-revealing full skirts.
   Like many other designers, Tarlazzi loved the lingerie look. He
trotted several fitted pastel slips out of the underwear closet.
They usually had lace-edged tops with spaghetti straps, plus black
lace gussets in the flared skirts. They would be perfect under a
suit if you got tired of wearing them out to the disco.
   Another young Tarlazzi theme was done with eyelet: The cutest in
this vein, with shorts or minis, had red scalloped edges on the
shorts and fichu wrap tops.
   His shirred, clinging print micro dresses with their lacy edges
looked as if he took very seriously the bathing-suit evening-dress
idea started by Emanuel Ungaro a couple of seasons ago.
   For his second collection shown in Paris, English designer John
Galliano went in for some off-the-wall models that outdid the
Japanese of yore.
   His silhouettes were often quirky and asymmetrical, even
including a paper-doll paper dress with cutouts. Galliano had a
tendency to show a lot of skin, with some curious results, since
the outfits were obviously not beachwear.

<HEAD>Hollywood Builds New Calcutta Slum</HEAD>

   As if Calcutta didn't have enough slums,
Hollywood built another one. The collection of patchwork shacks is
so authentic that filmmakers had to erect a fence to keep out
people hoping to move in.
   The 600-foot-long street of 52 houses is the location for the
movie based on Dominique Lapierre's best-selling novel, ``City of
Joy,'' a story about a rickshaw puller and a Polish priest in the
slums of Calcutta.
   But it is more than just a movie set. The dilapidated homes are
careful replicas of slum shacks made of tin, mud, stone, wood and
tiles.
   They were based on dozens of photographs from slum quarters in
Calcutta, Bombay and New Delhi, said Philip Kohler, the production
manager.
   And they are so authentic ``we had to build a 10-foot fence
around the lot to keep out people who wanted to move in,'' Kohler
said.
   The homes were built on a lot owned by the national oil company
near Calcutta's docks in the heart of the industrial zone. They
will be demolished when filming is completed.
   The film for Warner Bros. is to be directed by Roland Joffe, of
``The Killing Fields'' and ``The Mission.'' The 12-week shooting
schedule begins in February.
   Calcutta has 300 slum neighborhoods, known as bustees, housing
an estimated 43 percent of the city's 12 million residents. Some
estimates say up to 300,000 people are homeless street-dwellers.
   ``City of Joy'' is about one of them, Hasari Pal, an
impoverished villager who brought his family to the city when he
could no longer meet debts from his small landholding.
   After working as a rickshaw puller - a human horse in the last
major city of the world where men still pull rickshaws - Pal can
afford to move into the slum of Ananda Nagar, which is Bengali for
City of Joy.
   From the beginning, the movie project ran into political
problems. Last year the state government of West Bengal objected to
putting Calcutta's poverty under the filmmakers' kleig lights.
   The film company argued that the movie would highlight the
city's ``indomitable spirit,'' according to news reports at the
time.
   ``We feel there is no need to show only slum-dwellers to show
the indomitable spirit of Calcutta,'' retorted Parvatheneni
Upendra, the information and broadcast minister of the federal
government in New Delhi.
   The information minister for the Communist-led state government
at the time, Budhadev Bhattacharya, also objected to the film. He
complained that the book was written ``from an imperialist point of
view.''
   Details of the negotiations that cleared the way for the film
have not been disclosed. The estimated $5 million the company is
likely to spend in Calcutta may have helped persuade the
authorities to reconsider.
   Kohler also said there was a contribution to an undisclosed
charity of an unknown amount.
   The Polish priest has been written out of the preliminary
script. He is replaced as the main character by an American doctor
who comes to Calcutta to help the lepers and the poor.
   The doctor is a secondary character in Lapierre's 1985 book.
   The rewrite could reflect the sensitivity in this predominantly
Hindu nation about Christian missionaries, or the filmmakers'
belief that the doctor would have wider audience appeal than the
priest.

<TEXT>
   Operation Desert Shield, along with
holding off Iraqi soldiers, is also shielding the desert from
another force that each year devastates Saudi rangeland: millions
of Iraqi sheep.
   An inadvertent side effect of impending war, conservationists
say, is that Iraqi herders have ceased their traditional migration
across the border to find pasture for sheep, goats and camels.
   That, they say, is no small windfall to Saudi Arabia, where a
loss of plant cover threatens to convert arable range into
wasteland across much of the country.
   ``Tanks and jeeps running around up there are nothing compared
to what happens from overgrazing,'' said Graham Child, senior
consultant to the National Commission for Wildlife Conservation and
Development.
   Crisis or not, the commission is pressing ahead with a 10-year
plan to protect endangered habitats and restock them with
disease-free gazelle, ostrich and native birds.
   The measures have already brought the Arabian oryx back from
extinction in the wild. Two species of gazelle are being bred by
the hundreds.
   There are also some new houbara bustards, large birds beloved by
Saudis who hunt them with falcons.
   Arabian rangelands, slowly degrading for a thousand years, now
suffer badly from Saudi Bedouin now able to use water trucks to
graze their animals on fragile land they could not reach before.
   Under historic accords, Iraqi and Jordanian nomads have crossed
regularly into northern Saudi Arabia to find fresh range. They have
benefited from the same generous subsidies allowed the Saudis.
   At the same time, swift rural development in Saudi Arabia
brought new roads, irrigated farming and other incursions on
natural habitats.
   Saudi leaders realized they faced a crisis in the mid-1980s when
hunters consistently camehome empty-handed. In 1986, the
commission was set up to do something about it.
   Within four years, 57,692 square miles were designated protected
areas. Specialists came in to shape a wildlife research center from
a neglected private zoo on the late King Khalid's farm north of
here.
   At a second center, scientists experimented with ways to breed
enough houbara bustard chicks to save the threatened wild
population.
   ``They've achieved an enormous amount in three years,'' said
Doug Williamson, an English-based biologist who runs the King
Khalid Wildlife Research Center.
   ``Things are far from perfect, but there is goodwill and money
is being committed,'' he said.
   Abdul Aziz abu Zinada, the commision's secretary-general, said
his priorities were protecting habitats, seeking environmental
legislation, restocking wildlife and building public awareness.
   Conflict with Iraq has stalled plans for regional cooperation,
he said, but international organizations have continued to help
with data and advice.
   ``Now in the north you can see idmi (sand gazelle) where they
had almost disappeared,'' Abu Zinada said. ``It is thrilling.''
   At the King Khalid Center, scientists have all but eliminated
the tuberculosis which, traced back to a gift deer from Spain, had
crippled herds left for years in a single enclosure.
   Soon the 600 to 700 gazelles now thriving as a result of the
program will be breeding hundreds of kids a year to be released
into the wild, Williamson said.
   The center has two pairs of afri, or Saudi dorcas gazelles,
among the last 27 believed left in the world.
   Altogether, there are 20 species from five continents.
   The animals thrive in separate pens and paddocks and include a
mix of indigenous species and gifts from visitors. There are idmi,
rheem (mountain gazelle), other rare gazelles, Arabian oryx,
zebras, ostriches and assorted extras, including a mad half-goat,
half-ibex that thinks it's a deer.
   Williamson, an antelope specialist who worked in Botswana's
Kalahari Desert, is also conducting research on how gazelle cope
with roasting desert temperatures.
   ``We haven't been affected much by the Iraq crisis,'' he said,
echoing remarks by scientists conducting other commission projects.
   ``There is a lot to do still, but we're doing it.''

<HEAD>Drugmaker Fined $1 Million In Generic Drug Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A generic drug manufacturer was fined $1
million Thursday for bribing and lying to Food and Drug
Administration officials in applying for approval of drugs, the
Justice Department said.
   American Therapeutics Inc., of Bohemia, N.Y., was fined after
pleading guilty to five charges in U.S. District Court in
Baltimore.
   ATI pleaded guilty to interstate travel in aid of racketeering,
making false statements to a government agency, failing to follow
required drug manufacturing practices, obstruction of an agency
investigation and making unlawful payments to FDA officials.
   Judge John Hargrove fined ATI $1 million on the first four
counts and $500,000 on the bribery charge. The $500,000 fine was a
concurrent fine, meaning ATI must pay a total of $1 million.
   ``(The case) reveals a depressing and sinister picture of the
generic drug industry,'' U.S. Attorney Breckinridge Willcox said in
a statement.
   ``Unfortunately, the picture will get even darker. As heinous as
the conduct of American Therapeutics and its former chief executive
is ... the conduct of ATI was altogether commonplace,'' he said.
   As part of a plea bargain agreement, the company agreed to
assist prosecutors in a continuing investigation of possible
misconduct by former ATI employees.
   The company admitted to substituting newer pills of the
anti-hypertension drug clorazopate dipotassium for older ones in
reserve samples, which are required by the FDA for testing
purposes. The FDA investigated the drug after hearing complaints
that it crumbled in storage, prosecutors said.
   The company also admitted that it submitted false data and
prepared false records for two other generic drugs it had submitted
for approval, prosecutors said.
   Clorazopate dipotassium made it to the market, but the other two
did not, Justice Department spokesman Michael Robinson said.
Whether the drug posed a health risk to consumers was not known, he
said.
   The company engaged in the actions at the direction of its
former chief executive officer and president, Raju Vegesna,
prosecutors said.
   Vegesna was convicted in April of giving $60,000 in bribes to
employees of the FDA's generic drug division in exchange for
favorable treatment of drug applications.
   The division where the employees worked is responsible for
reviewing applications from pharmaceutical manufacturers who want
to produce and market generic equivalents of brand name drugs.
   ``We are grateful that the Vegesna chapter in ATI's history
finally has been concluded,'' said Dr. John Meloy, a director of
ATI. ``ATI has been committed from the outset to fully cooperate
with the government and to ensure that there are not safety and
effectiveness concerns about any ATI product.''
   The pleas Thursday were part of an ongoing investigation of
fraud in the generic drug industry being conducted by the Justice
Department, the U.S. Attorney's office, the FDA and the Department
of Health and Human Services Inspector General.
   The investigation already has led to the felony convictions of
four former FDA employees, five generic drug company executives,
three drug companies and one industry consultant.

   The U.S. Postal Service unveiled one of
two 1990 Christmas stamps Thursday and offered a ``first issue''
postmark for stamp collectors.
   The stamp, which shows a white Christmas tree against a red
background with the words ``Season's Greetings'' printed across it,
was issued at a ceremony near Hiwan Homestead Museum in Evergreen.
   Evergreen was chosen because of its obvious connection to the
evergreen tree depicted on the stamp. The other stamp was issued
Thursday in Washington, D.C., officials said.
   Each year, the Postal Service releases Christmas stamps in a
town whose name has a holiday ring. Past sites include Santa Claus,
Ariz., and Bethlehem, Penn.
   The Evergreen post office held an open house to celebrate the
stamp unveiling and collectors lined up to obtain ``first-issue''
postmarks.
   The rest of the world had to wait until Friday to buy the stamp.

   In yet another threat against the old Soviet way
of life, Jane Fonda and her workout show have muscled into Red
Square.
   Ms. Fonda ran circles around the Kremlin Thursday in a promotion
for her exercise tapes, which will be broadcast on Soviet TV
starting next week.
   Soviet citizens are not particularly health conscious or fit,
but the several hundred Soviet women who jogged with Jane showed
that not all Russians are couch potatoes, or standing in line to
buy them.
   ``This is something we do in the United States very frequently
and I wanted to bring it to Moscow and share it with you,'' Ms.
Fonda said before setting out.
   Wearing a white track suit, snug black and purple midriff-length
shirt and sunglasses, she led the joggers in a 1{-mile run.
   The joggers went down the cobblestone road from St. Basil's
Cathedral, along the Moscow River embankment, up a hill past the
outer Kremlin wall and then back to Red Square past the Lenin
Mausoleum.
   Twenty minutes later, surrounded by star-struck youths and
dozens of cameras, Ms. Fonda arrived at the finish line, where the
crowd was entertained by the Red Army band and a small circus bear.
   Burly security guards helped push through the crowd to get Ms.
Fonda into her car. Her companion, broadcast mogul Ted Turner, had
to follow later in a separate car.
   Turner was here for Friday night's Soviet premier of the U.S.
classic movie ``Gone With the Wind.'' His company owns MGM
Entertainment and the movie is part of its library.
   Turner was making his eighth visit to the Soviet Union since
1984.
   ``I'm a great believer in the Soviet Union and I think they'll
get their economy solved,'' he said. ``Then there'll be tremendous
opportunities, pent up demand for all sorts of products.''

   If the federal government shuts down because

Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter will be among those essential
employees to remain on the job.
   With a few restrictions, that is.
   For example, if no budget agreement is reached, Bush has said he
will shut down the government Saturday morning, when federal
spending authority is due to expire.
   The goal is for Congress and Bush to agree on a $500 billion
deficit-reduction plan to guide government spending over the next
five years. The Agriculture Department's share, as approved this
week by House and Senate farm bill negotiators, is $13.6 billion.
   Yeutter, meanwhile, is to leave Sunday for meetings next week in
Argentina, Brazil and Chile on the current Uruguay Round of talks
in Geneva under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
   Kelly Shipp, Yeutter's press secretary and director of the
USDA's office of public affairs, said that ``if on Sunday, the
government's not up, then he will not go'' on the South American
trip.
   That is one example of what a shutdown will mean at the
department. Yeutter and selected aides would still be considered
essential, would work and collect their pay. But most of USDA's
100,000 full-time employees would not.
   ``No one can tell you today, precisely, all the people who would
be essential in the event of a shutdown,'' Shipp said Thursday in a
telephone interview. ``I can give you broad categories ... that's
why they have to leave it up to the discretion of the various
managers.''
   In other words, there is no central board or office that
designates ``essential'' employees. Each USDA agency, from the
Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service to the Rural
Electrification Administration, handles its own designations.
   Shipp said a ``very, very rough'' estimate is that 20,000 to
30,000 USDA employees would be considered essential in a
government-wide shutdown of services. Those would include about
7,500 federal meat and poultry inspectors, who would remain on the
job.
   There are several general guidelines used to help determine
essential duties and employees, the spokeswoman said. Those
include:
   -Functions that affect the health and safety of the general
public. Meat and poultry inspection is an example.
   -Employees who are needed to conduct an orderly shutdown of the
government.
   -Those whose jobs involve the safety and security of government
facilities. Forest rangers and others needed to protect federal
property would be in this category.
   Some other jobs that could be considered essential include
workers needed to maintain feed and water for animals at USDA farms
and laboratories. Those would include quarantine stations operated
by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.
   Workers and technical people involved in campaigns against
intruding pests, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly, could be kept
on if their duties are essential to the program.
   Shipp said the campaign this week against Africanized honeybees
in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas would be another example of
essential work.
   As for Yeutter's staff, no determination would be made until an
actual shutdown began, she said. But receptionists and some other
office people probably would be furloughed.
   Essential people would ``not necessarily'' include Yeutter's
senior aides, Shipp said. It would depend on what kind of
activities they were overseeing.
   Would Shipp remain at work in a shutdown? ``I don't know,
because it depends on what's going on,'' she said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department says China has
bought an additional 299,740 metric tons of U.S. wheat under a
price subsidy program.
   Officials said the subsidies for wheat sold to China have about
doubled from what they averaged only a few months ago.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Thursday that three private
exporting companies made the deals under the Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for the first three months of
1991, he said. It was the first wheat sale to China under EEP since
Aug. 1.
   The sales were part of 2 million tons authorized China under EEP
on May 2. Dickerson said China has about 460,000 tons remaining in
its current allocation.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 11 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by USDA at around $2.42 per bushel, the
wheat would have a farm value of around $27 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $41.38 per ton, or
about $1.13 per bushel.
   That was double the bonuses paid on China's previous wheat
purchase on Aug. 1, which averaged $20.40 per ton, or 56 cents per
bushel. A glut of wheat from bumper harvests in key producing
countries has pressured world prices, thus requiring larger
subsidies to keep U.S. grain competitive.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Bunge Corp., 150,000 tons;
Louis Dreyfs Corp., 100,000 tons; and Tradigrain Inc., 49,750
tons.
   With the latest sales, China has bought nearly 2.8 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1990-91 wheat marketing year that
began June 1, compared with 5.6 million tons in 1989-90.

   A federal judge lowered Charles H. Keating
Jr.'s bail Thursday from $5 million to $300,000, allowing the
former savings and loan chief to walk out of jail after a month
behind bars.
   Relatives whisked away a smiling Keating after his release.
   U.S. District Judge John G. Davies reduced Keating's bail,
saying Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner arbitrarily set it as
much as 50 times higher than that of his co-defendants, who already
had made bail.
   ``I can see no rational reason whatsoever ... for this disparate
treatment among defendants,'' Davies said.
   Keating, 66, an Arizona developer, was jailed on charges of
fraudulently selling junk bonds issued by his American Continental
Corp., which owned the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   A federal bailout of Lincoln Savings is expected to cost
taxpayers $2 billion, which would make it the nation's costliest
thrift bailout.
   The bail decision came as the Senate Ethics Committee
investigated whether five senators who received campaign
contributions from Keating improperly intervened with banking
regulators on Keating's behalf.
   Keating's family posted the reduced bail.
   One of Keating's attorneys, Jeffrey Powell, said Keating would
return to his home in an exclusive Phoenix suburb and begin
preparing his defense.
   ``I'm extremely pleased,'' Powell said. ``But I think it's
unfortunate it took us 33 days to get to this point.''
   Deputy District Attorney Paul Turley said prosecutors would not
appeal Davies' bail ruling but contended Klausner ruled carefully
in considering bail.
   ``I believe Judge Klausner viewed all the evidence in front of
him and that evidence supported the bail amount without any
arbitrariness,'' Turley said.
   When Klausner initially set Keating's bail at $5 million,
Klausner described it as 2 percent of the alleged $250 million in
losses to people who invested in worthless bonds through
Irvine-based Lincoln Savings.
   Davies called that proof of arbitrary bail and said the
Constitution allowed bail to be set only high enough to ensure a
defendant would appear to answer charges.
   The 42-count state grand jury indictment accused Keating and
three of his former officials of misleading investors about the
security of American Continental junk bonds sold at Lincoln
branches.
   At the end of a two-day hearing last month, Klausner let stand
the $5 million bail he set earlier. He said the potential 10-year
prison term in the fraud case might make flight likely for Keating,
who also faces a federal criminal investigation and civil lawsuits
including a $1 billion racketeering case.
   Keating appealed his $5 million bail to the federal court aftr
exhausting appeals through state courts, going all the way to the
California Supreme Court without success.
   In federal court, Keating appealed the bail on constitutional
grounds.
   ``The bottom line is there was a violation of Mr. Keating's 8th
Amendment rights'' against excessive bail, Davies said.
   Keating was not in court, although several family members were.
   Davies' ruling followed an impassioned plea by a character
witness, former Keating attorney John ``Jack'' Quinn of Los
Angeles.
   In Washington, the Senate Ethics Committee adjourned Thursday
without announcing a decision on whether to intensify its
investigation of three senators: Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   Committee documents obtained by The Associated Press show the
three had more extensive dealings with Keating than previously
acknowledged.
   Quinn described Keating as obsessed with clearing his name and
described him as a devoted, God-fearing family man.
   Keating is ``probably the most vilified man since Richard
Nixon'' and must be free to defend himself, Quinn said.
   To qualify for bail, Keating agreed to surrender his passport,
restrict his travel to the 48 contiguous states, report to Los
Angeles County authorities by phone every week and provide
authorities with a detailed itinerary of any trips planned.

<HEAD>Report: Interior Department Fails to Protect Endangered Plants,
Animals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Anastasia Island cotton mouse is gone
forever.
   So is the insular long-tongued bat of Puerto Rico and the Texas
Henslow's sparrow.
   All are victims of mismanagement and a shortage of money that
has kept the Interior Department from adequately enforcing the
federal law that is supposed to protect endangered species,
according to government auditors.
   A report by the department's inspector general's office said
Thursday that hundreds of other rare animals and plants may become
extinct without any federal effort to save them because of
shortcomings in the federal endangered species program.
   During the past decade, 34 species have disappeared because of
inadequate protection under the Endangered Species Act, the
internal report said. It cited underfunding and personnel shortages
and blamed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for not adequately
managing the program.
   Craig Rieben, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service,
acknowledged a huge backlog of endangered species cases, but he
maintained the problem largely involves a lack of money.
   ``Working with the (budget) constraints that we are, we feel
that we're doing the best job possible. That's not to say that more
couldn't be done,'' he said.
   The internal report said it could cost as much as $4.6 billion
to protect all of the presently known endangered species, while the
Fish and Wildlife Service is provided about $33 million a year to
administer the program.
   The cost of merely listing the current leading candidates for
protection was estimated at $36 million. The agency's listing
budget is $3.5 million.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service has put about 50 plants or animals
on the threatened or endangered list yearly, but has a backlog of
601 applications where the species probably deserve immediate
protection, the investigators said.
   An additional 3,000 species are suspected of being endangered,
but ``are receiving little or no protection'' while they await the
federal review, the report added. It estimated that at the current
pace it would take the agency almost 50 years to bring those
species under the protection of federal law.
   The Endangered Species Act, enacted in 1969 to protect species
in danger of extinction, has been under attack in recent months,
largely because of a bitter controversy over how to protect the
Northwest's spotted owl.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service last summer declared the owl
threatened, and the Bush administration has been trying to come up
with a way to protect the bird while limiting the loss of 20,000
jobs in the timber industry.
   The owls are rapidly dying off because of intense cutting in the
old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest. Any owl protection
plan is likely to include restrictions in cutting.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan caused an uproar last summer
among environmentalists when he suggested the endangered species
law be made more flexible to take economic considerations into
account in some circumstances.
   In its report on the enforcement of the law, the department's
investigators concluded the Fish and Wildlife Service ``has neither
developed nor implemented a basic management system for effective
administration of the (endangered species) program.''
   It said investigators also found that in addition to the huge
backlog of petitions to list species for protection, the agency has
failed to develop recovery plans for many plants and animals
already under the law's protection.

   Bill Cosby would rather switch than fight.
   The star of NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' made good on a promise
Thursday as the program dumped a disputed opening credit sequence
and replaced it with the title scene from last year's show.
   The rejected sequence featured Cosby's television family dancing
in front of a colorful mural. Last year's showed them dancing in
front of the Apollo Theater marquee.
   The dropped sequence drew complaints from a Harlem art teacher
who said students at the Creative Arts Workshop for Homeless
Children got no credit for inspiring the mural.
   Cosby had accused workshop director Brookie Maxwell of ``trying
to hold us up,'' and said his order to drop the sequence was a
matter of principle.
   Maxwell had said the children deserved credit and should be paid
if the idea was marketed. Workshop lawyer Vivian Pollack said no
specific financial demands were ever made.
   The original mural, ``Street of Dreams,'' was painted by
workshop students on a Harlem building and shows children playing
and laughing. A similar mural was used in ``The Cosby Show'' title
sequence.
   Negotiations to end the dispute, including a financial
settlement offer from the show's producer, Carsey-Werner Co.,
failed to resolve the conflict.

   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - Actor and peace activist Ed Asner told
Oklahoma teachers they can help humanity better itself, but warned
that idealism means taking risks.
   ``It's our responsibility and our duty to point out the wrongs
we see around us,'' Asner said Thursday in a speech to the Oklahoma
Education Association.
   Asner, best known for his portrayal of Lou Grant on two
television series and a school principal on ``Bronx Zoo,'' said
personal involvement is a must for teachers to convey high ideals
to students.
   The former president of the Screen Actors Guild and backer of
many humanitarian and political organizations warned educators
their job is made more difficult by mass media distractions.
   ``I get to the kids' minds before you do,'' Asner said, quoting
statistics that show children typically have viewed 5,000 hours of
television by the time they start school.

   LAS VEGAS (AP) - Veteran entertainer Art Linkletter says older
people can still get a kick out of life.
   ``I'm 78 and still alive and doing what I want to stay alive and
be fulfilled,'' Linkletter told a seminar for seniors Wednesday. He
encouraged them to ``save your self-esteem and your identity'' by
staying young emotionally.
   Linkletter is author of 23 books, including his latest, ``Old
Age is Not For Sissies.'' He says everyone needs ``something to
hope for and something to love.''
   Linkletter, the host of long-running TV shows ``House Party''
and ``People Are Funny,'' also said taking things easy shouldn't
wait until old age.
   ``Live your life so you don't destroy yourself en route,'' he
said.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - ``Mod Squad'' regular Clarence Williams III,
who played the ultra-hip undercover police officer Linc Hayes,
returns to TV on the other side of the law in an upcoming episode
of ABC's ``Gabriel's Fire.''
   Williams, known on ``Mod Squad'' for his huge Afro hairstyle and
delivery of late 1960s slang lines like ``Solid, man'' and ``Keep
the faith, baby,'' will play a street gang leader on the Nov. 1
episode of ``Gabriel's Fire.''
   Williams has appeared in few acting roles since ``The Mod
Squad'' was canceled in 1973. He reprised his role in the 1979 TV
movie ``The Return of the Mod Squad'' and in 1984 played the father
of rock star Prince in the movie, ``Purple Rain.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - Connie Chung says women in TV make tongues wag
more than their male counterparts, especially when there's a hint
of conflict.
   Speaking about NBC newswoman Jane Pauley's sudden departure from
the ``Today'' show earlier this year and her replacement by the
younger Deborah Norville, Chung said the change got more attention
because the central figures were women.
   ``When Chris Wallace and Bryant Gumbel and Jane Pauley were on
`Today' together and it didn't work out and Chris left - OK, that
was a one-day story,'' Chung said in the Oct. 21 edition of Parade
magazine. ``When it's a woman, like Jane ... wow!''

   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) - An obsessed fan who harassed
``Rocky'' and ``Rambo'' star Sylvester Stallone for years was
ordered to stay away from the actor's home and office.
   Elsie Wade of Santa Monica was ordered Thursday to stay at least
200 yards away from Stallone's Malibu beach house and the offices
of his White Eagle Enterprises. The order lasts three years.
   Stallone had sought the injunction because the woman delivered
more than 200 cards and letters to his home over a two-year period,
placing up to 10 letters a day in his mailbox.
   Stallone and Ms. Wade didn't attend the brief court session.
   Many Hollywood celebrities have been plagued by obsessive fans,
including Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Michael J. Fox, Olivia
Newton-John and Sharon Gless.

   President Bush's apparent decision to sign yet
another stopgap spending bill represents his latest reversal in a
budget debate that has seen more than a few presidential
flip-flops.
   Earlier this week, the president declared in political
appearances in Texas and Iowa that he would not sign another
short-term bill when the current one expires at midnight tonight.
   ``Lest there be any doubt, let me make clear to Congress just
how serious I am about meeting that Friday deadline,'' he told a
Republican audience in Dallas on Monday. ``This Friday, time's up.
The American people deserve more than this stopgap government.''
   But his spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Thursday that Bush had
decided to sign such a measure after all, so long as ``satisfactory
progress'' is made by tonight toward a final budget compromise.
   ``We'll decide at the time (midnight tonight) what satisfactory
progress is,'' Fitzwater added.
   The White House, sent scrambling several times over the past
days to explain, interpret or deny a Bush budget turnabout, found
itself in the same position once again Thursday.
   Asked why the president had changed his mind on whether to sign
another stopgap bill, Fitzwater insisted that he really hadn't.
   ``The point is, we want to get a budget agreement, we want a
budget. And if we've got two bills, we've been in conference, we've
worked out something that's reasonable, we're willing to sign a CR
to get it,'' Fitzwater said.
   A CR is a ``continung resolution,'' legislative jargon for a
stopgap spending bill.
   A House-Senate conference committee must reconcile vast
differences between the House-passed budget, which Bush opposes,
and the Senate version, which he supports.
   ``The president wants to get a budget and he feels this is the
best way to get one,'' Fitzwater said.
   So far in the deliberations on a budget for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1, Bush:
   -Abandoned his 1988 ``read my lips: no new taxes'' campaign
pledge and endorsed a package proposing $134 billion in new taxes
over five years, including levies on cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline
and luxury items like yachts and furs. The plan was rejected by the
House.
   -Appeared to contradict White House chief of staff John Sununu's
declaration in a television interview that the administration would
not support any increase in income taxes. Bush, at a news
conference early last week, said he was open to a compromise that
would include higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans in exchange
for a cut in capital gains taxes.
   -Backed away from this formula under pressure from Republican
leaders, according to participants at a White House meeting at
which Bush renewed his opposition to any increase in income taxes.
   -Added to the confusion and mixed signals as he jogged in St.
Petersburg, Fla. He responded ``read my hips'' and pointed to his
buttocks when asked by a reporter if he was dropping his support
for a lower capital gains tax.
   -Suggested late last week that he could support a package to
raise the top tax bracket from the current 28 percent to 31 percent
if it were accompanied by a decrease in capital gains taxes to 15
percent. But then he said he wouldn't push such a plan because he
didn't think it could muster enough votes to pass Congress.
   Bush said in political speeches this week in Dallas, Omaha,
Neb., and Des Moines, Iowa, that he was ready to close down the
government again, if necessary, as he did over the Columbus Day
weekend.
   ``There have been 37 of these emergency measures since 1981 -
seven in one year alone - just to keep the government's door
open,'' he told the Omaha audience. ``I am sickened by such
mortgaging of our children's future.''
   But, Fitzwater said Thursday, ``Closing down the government is
only something you do if you absolutely have to.''

   Even for the acrimonious standards of Britain's
parliamentary debates, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and
opposition leader Neil Kinnock exchanged some pretty tough
language.
   Debating education policy Thursday, the Conservative prime
minister called the liberal Labor Party leader a
``crypto-communist'' and he labeled her a ``crank.''
   The government plans to give vouchers for parents to send
children to schools of their choice and apparently to encourage
schools to opt out of control by left-wing local authorities. Labor
says the move is elitist.
   ``Of course you hate choice, of course you hate higher
standards, of course you hate opportunity, you are a socialist -
you are a crypto-communist!'' she shouted at Kinnock.
   ``It is a long time since we had quite such a tantrum from
you,'' Kinnock replied. Earlier, Kinnock told Mrs. Thatcher: ``You
are a crank.''
   The prime minister's question time - a twice-weekly, 15-minute
session - has become increasingloy rowdy and ill-tempered in recent
years.

   Two white supremacists pleaded innocent
Thursday to burning an Israeli flag on a sidewalk last month.
   A Nov. 29 trial was scheduled for Matt Hale, 19, and Steven
Thornhill, 17, both from East Peoria.
   Each man faces a possible fine of $40 to $300 if convicted of
violating a city ordinance on public burning. They are free on $50
bond.
   The flag was burned Sept. 23 as the two demonstrated on a street
corner.
   Hale, leader of the American White Supremacist Party, didn't
deny burning the flag and said he wants to use the case to test the
ordinance banning burning.
   ``If someone has the right to burn the American flag, they have
the right to burn the Israeli flag. I know if I had burned the
American flag, I'd have the ACLU defending me,'' Hale said.

<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats are the ones boasting about the
Republican candidate seeking to replace GOP Rep. Lynn Martin in the
U.S. House.
   Republican John Hallock is ``probably the worst candidate in the
country this year,'' says Howard Schloss, a spokesman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington.
   Hallock was clocked driving 107 mph by a state trooper and has
been embarrassed by public disclosure of a child support dispute
with his ex-wife.
   ``He's gotten a lot of press for his inability to obey the
law,'' Schloss said. ``He's doing everything possible to lose the
race.''
   Democrat John Cox hopes Hallock's problems will help him break a
GOP stranglehold on the northern Illinois district. Martin is
giving up her House seat to challenge Democratic Sen. Paul Simon.
   Rockford, where Hallock lives, anchors an eight-county GOP
stronghold bordering Iowa and Wisconsin. The city has been
represented in Congress by Republicans for all but two of the past
135 years.
   But the 1989 election of a black Democrat as Rockford mayor
signaled a potential shift in voter loyalties.
   Cox, a lawyer, has a history of taking on entrenched
Republicans. He won the first of two consecutive terms as JoDaviess
County state's attorney in 1976, becoming the first Democrat
elected to that post since 1933.
   Hallock has raised $500,000, Cox $250,000. National committees
for both parties are contributing manpower and money in what is
likely to be the only competitive race in the region.
   Republicans are counting on a boost from the Martin-Simon race.
Although she trails Simon substantially in published polls,
Republicans hope the Rockford-area congresswoman will draw well in
her home district and pull extra votes for Hallock.
   Hallock, a state representative since 1979, has soft-pedaled his
personal troubles and tried to shift attention to his differences
with Cox on taxes.
   Hallock pleaded guilty last summer to a May 11 speeding ticket.
A state trooper said Hallock was driving 107 mph on Interstate 55.
After missing his court date, Hallock pleaded guilty to going 95
mph and paid a fine and court costs of $400.
   In September, Hallock was stopped for speeding in a 30 mph zone,
but was released with an oral warning, state police said.
   ``Let's not make more of it than it is,'' Hallock said. ``I got
a speeding ticket. We all make mistakes.
   ``It's the credentials of a candidate that's important, not his
driving record.''
   Hallock also has come under attack for his position on abortion.
He supports the right to abortion through the first trimester of
pregnancy, but not after. He has voted in the state legislature for
parental notification and consent for underage girls seeking
abortions. He is against federal funding of abortions.
   Cox staked out a pro-choice position early and has the support
of abortion rights groups.
   Hallock has attacked Cox as a proponent of higher taxes.
   ``My options don't include any tax increase,'' Hallock said.
``My options are cutting the budget, collecting back taxes and a
balanced budget amendment.''
   Cox said he has not supported five tax increases, as Hallock
says, but suggested five areas where revenue could be raised if
necessary. He said he favors increasing the income tax rate for
people making more than $150,000 a year from 28 percent to 35
percent, to pay for the thrift bailout ``and perhaps budget
reduction.''
   He criticized Hallock as a career politician who embodies the
problems in Washington and the lack of public respect for
government.
   ``The first thing we have to do is get credibility back to our
leaders in Washington,'' Cox said. ``It's experienced legislators
in Washington that have gotten us into the budget deficit mess.''

<HEAD>Rivals Tap Washington Ties in Battle For Open House Seat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is 8 a.m. at La Colline, a fashionable
Capitol Hill restaurant, and Connecticut Democrat Toby Moffett is
trolling for campaign dollars.
   Suddenly, who should step around the bend - doing the same thing
- but Gary Franks, Moffett's Republican opponent in the race for
Connecticut's 5th District House seat.
   ``It was incredible,'' Moffett said. ``We just shook hands and
said `hi.'''
   By coincidence, Moffett and Franks rented separate rooms for
fund-raising breakfasts at the same time on the same day.
   Both candidates are tapping their Washington connections as they
battle for a congressional seat that has been controlled by
Republicans for 12 of the last 18 years. The seat is being vacated
by Republican Rep. John Rowland, who is running for governor.
   ``This race will probably be in the top 20 in terms of national
interest,'' said Doug Sosnick, political director of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
   Franks, 37, is hoping to become the first black in Connecticut
history to serve in Congress, his campaign says. And he would be
the first black Republican in the House since 1935. The alderman
from Waterbury, Conn., is one of three black Republicans running
for the House this year.
   Moffett, 46, is a liberal-leaning Democrat seeking to return to
Congress, where he served four terms from another district. He
moved so he could seek the open House seat.
   Moffett ``wandered into the wrong district,'' says Franks.
   During the campaign, Franks has hobnobbed at the White House
with President Bush. Both are Yale University graduates and were
campus athletes. Bush is committed to a campaign swing through
Connecticut before Election Day. The Republican Party also promised
to provide Franks' campaign the maximum $63,000 in cash and in-kind
contributions.
   In the current political climate, insider status can be a
disadvantage. So Moffett is trying to exploit Franks' ties to
Washington.
   ``We just can't match that,'' he said of Franks' ability to draw
attention and campaign visits from GOP bigwigs. ``They just drop in
on you like paratroopers; a Cabinet member a day, the president.''
   But Moffett has ties of his own.
   The Democrat has tapped into alliances formed during his years
on Capitol Hill to pick up $120,565 from political action
committees.
   Moffett also has used his status as an ex-congressman to lobby
on the House floor against decreases in Medicaid benefits.
   Franks calls Moffett ``a tax-and-spend career politician.''
   Trying not to seem too much the insider, Franks notes that he
disagrees with the president on the deficit-reducing budget plan
because it calls for tax increases.
   He also claims underdog status in the race. Moffett ``has higher
name ID than a little alderman from Waterbury,'' he says.
   Moffett frequently refers to Franks as ``a creature of the
Republican National Committee'' and brands his opponent as too
conservative for Connecticut.
   ``The Republican Party is controlled by conservatives and the
conservatives think Franks will be another Jesse Helms,'' Moffett
said. ``He forgot where he came from and I didn't.''
   Sosnick says the Republicans desperately want a black to win.
   But Mark Nuttle, executive director of the Republican National
Congressional Committee, said, ``It makes no difference whether
you're black or white.'' The goal, he said, is holding onto the
seat now held by Rowland, a Republican, and defeating Moffett, a
well-known Democrat.

<HEAD>Senate Candidate Cautioned By Medical Board, Alleges GOP `Dirty
Trick'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Kentucky's medical licensure board chided
Dr. Harvey Sloane, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, for
writing prescriptions with an expired federal drug registration.
   But the board said Thursday no formal sanction was warranted.
Sloane said the inquiry into his writing prescription refills for
himself was ``a carefully orchestrated ... Republican dirty
trick.''
   A spokesman for Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell accused Sloane
of ``outrageous lies.''
   It was the second inquiry by the state Board of Medical
Licensure into Sloane's prescriptions.
   Last fall, the board advised Sloane to stop prescribing sleeping
pills for himself. Sloane, who no longer has an active medical
practice, said he wrote refills of the pills because of arthritis
pain in his hip and back pain from a degenerative disk disease. He
did not write the original prescriptions.
   The inquiry was prompted by the disclosure that Sloane's Drug
Enforcement Administration permit to write prescriptions had
expired in February 1987.

<HEAD>Wilson Criticized For Campaign Contributions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Environmentalists called Republican
gubernatorial candidate Pete Wilson ``Pesticide Pete'' for
accepting $80,909 in campaign money from the pesticide industry.
   Wilson's campaign said the environmentalists were engaging in
smear tactics.
   The National Toxics Campaign said Wilson ranked third in the
U.S. Senate among recipients of pesticide industry contributions
between 1983 and 1988. The organization said Wilson ranked behind
Sen. Steve Simms, R-Idaho, and Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.
   ``We had been wondering why Pete Wilson decided to oppose `Big
Green' (environmental initiative Proposition 128), and now we've
finally got an answer that makes sense,'' said Sierra Club member
Bob Hattoy.
   Wilson spokesman Otto Bos accused the National Toxics Campaign
of a ``big lie.'' He said Wilson was ranked ``third-best Republican
in the entire U.S. Senate on the environment by the national League
of Conservation Voters.... The voters are much smarter than to fall
for the `big lie,''' Bos said.
   He did not dispute, however, that Wilson received the
contributions.

   As if Congress didn't have enough trouble, now
the roof is leaking.
   Already besieged by a storm of criticism for its handling of the
budget crisis, Congress experienced a rainstorm Thursday that
caused a massive leak in the Capitol Dome and shredded flags flying
over congressional office buildings.
   Crews quickly threw plastic sheets over statues and leather
upholstered benches in the Rotunda as puddles formed on the floor.
   ``This is symbolic of what is happening to our government,''
Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., said while rain dripped down a marble
likeness of Abraham Lincoln.
   Fatigue is taking its toll on lawmakers as debate, droning on
practically around the clock, moves Congress painfully toward the
end of its 101st session.
   The Republican side of the House burst into angry shouting late
Wednesday when Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., was awakened from a nap
in time to break a 206-206 tie on a vote that would change U.S.
policy toward Angola.
   ``You already said time had expired,'' screamed Rep. James
Quillen, R-Tenn. But the speaker overruled the protest.
   ``Tempers are pretty short around here,'' Rep. Byron Dorgan,
D-N.D., said Thursday.
   Even in the Senate, where time has never been an object and
long-winded pontification is high art, enough was getting to be
enough.
   ``The speeches have been persuasive, the speeches have been
powerful, the speeches have been emotional, most of all the
speeches have been plentiful,'' Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said during debate on deficit-reduction.
   ``If we could have charged fees for the speeches made in this
chamber on the need to reduce the deficit, we could have reduced
the deficit just by that fee. We could have a balanced budget by
now. In fact we would have a surplus,'' Mitchell said.
   ``People look puffy,'' said news photographer Wally McNamee.
Three other photographers sitting at lunch with him nodded,
commenting on which members of Congress looked the most tired.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., acting as president pro tempore
Thursday, announced a Senate vote as 45-57 and reporters dutifully
wrote it down.
   Minutes passed before anyone noticed it totaled 102, two more
than the full membership of the Senate.
   Weary elevator operators, working 15-hour days, slumped in the
corners of their lifts.
   ``You get tired and you miss your kids and your family misses
you,'' said a cashier in the House restaurant, which stays open as
long as members are debating on the floor.
   The eight months pregnant wife of a top Democratic staffer said
that if the lawmakers didn't finish their work soon, ``they're
going to have divorce lawyers walking around the halls of
Congress.''
   Still, there was some room for humor.
   In the lounge area off the House chamber, a photographer was
taking pictures of the members for their voting identification
cards next year, even though they're all facing election next
month.
   ``That's the overconfidence booth over there,'' said Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass. ``That's the `What, me worry?' booth.''
   Sitting for his official photo, Rep. Bob Wise, W.Va., quipped:
``With the anti-incumbent thing out there, it makes you feel good
for a little while.''

<HEAD>Report: Researchers Killed Birds in Oil Spill Study</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska oil spill researchers killed as
many as 350 birds this summer as part of a study commissioned by
the federal government, a newspaper reported.
   The researchers fitted the dead birds with radio transmitters
and smeared some with oil, then tossed the bodies into the sea to
track their progress, The Sacramento Bee reported Thursday.
   The federal government commissioned the $600,000 study to help
its case against Exxon Corp., owner of the tanker that ran aground
and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William
Sound in March 1989, the newspaper said.
   By tracking the dead birds, researchers hope to develop a
formula to estimate the number of birds killed in the spill.
   During a highly publicized program after the spill, the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service said 797 birds had been rescued, cleaned
and released, the newspaper said. Thousands more birds were
believed to have died then.
   The birds killed this summer were shot on islands, most in
national wildlife refuges, outside the spill zone, the newspaper
said without providing specifics. The birds included murres,
scoters, common eiders, cormorants, ancient murrelets and auklets.
   The research was conducted by a Portland, Ore., company,
Ecological Consulting Inc., under a contract with the U.S.
Department of Justice and the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bee
said.
   The study is among a series of research projects upon which the
federal government will rely to try to prove natural resources
damages.
   Jack Hession, Alaska representative of the Sierra Club, said the
study is important. ``On the other hand, it's unfortunate they had
to collect live birds for the study,'' he said. ``Why didn't they
use dead birds they collected last year?''
   Bruce Batten, a spokesman for the Fish and Wildlife Service in
Anchorage, said the government knew the study would be
controversial.
   ``The Justice Department felt strongly that this study needed to
be done to make its case,'' he said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Congress Challenges the President - Again</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blame the Founding Fathers if you like, but
there is still disagreement in America's third century over who
decides whether to go to war - the president, Congress or both.
   The undeclared war in Vietnam almost tore the country apart.
Today, the possibility that President Bush might send American
troops into action against Iraq is driving a wedge between Congress
and the executive branch.
   At this point, emotions are under control. There are few
anti-war protests. But if Americans fight and die in the Persian
Gulf the country could be torn apart again.
   The problem basically is a constitutional one, but don't look to
the Supreme Court to settle it.
   Even the Warren Court, which did not shrink from controversy
over segregation, gerrymandered legislatures and heavy-handed
police interrogations, avoided judging the legality of the Vietnam
war.
   The justices hoped that somehow the White House and Congress
would work it out, but they never came to an agreement.
   The root of the problem is that the Constitution gives Congress
the right to declare war while designating the president as
commander-in-chief.
   At first blush, that may seem a workable arrangement. But the
White House and Congress have been wrestling over powers of war and
peace ever since.
   Toward the end of the Indochina war, after thousands of
Americans had died in combat, Congress' decision to enact the War
Powers Act in 1973 reflected widespread public disapproval of the
powers assumed by the White House.
   Passed over President Nixon's veto, the law attempted to make
sure Congress would serve as a rein on the White House in future
conflicts.
   The law requires the president to withdraw American troops from
combat or from situations of ``imminent involvement of
hostilities'' within 60 days unless Congress gives its approval.
The deadline can be extended by 30 days at the president's request.
   Some members of Congress are trying to apply the resolution to
today's situation in the Persian Gulf. They are particularly
anxious because Congress may adjourn late next week until
mid-January.
   The concern is that Bush will send Americans to war while
Congress is away.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III assured the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee on Wednesday that the administration would
consult with congressional leaders during the adjournment period.
   But Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, D-Md., told Baker that ``consultation
is not authorization.''
   Sarbanes, one of several senators who challenged the
administration's approach, lectured Baker: ``The notion that the
president alone would be able to commit American forces in a
military assault - in effect without receiving a shared decision by
the Congress - is contrary to the Constitution.''
   And Sen. Nancy L. Kassebaum, R-Kan., while describing herself as
not a supporter of the War Powers Act, still advised Baker that
``it is the law of the land, and as long as it is the law of the
land I think we have to adhere to it.''
   Actually, in the 17 years of the law's existence, Congress has
never required that troops be brought home. Congress tried to force
the president to carry out the law only once, when Marines landed
in Lebanon in 1983. But it extended the deadline for 18 months and
the Marines were withdrawn in the meantime.
   The current debate is over who decides to go to war. Some of the
members of Congress who are challenging the executive branch seem
inclined to support force against Iraq. Others are skeptical of the
wisdom of such a move.
   Among them is Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., who told Baker: ``I
feel very strongly, absent some severe provocation, that it would
be a tragic mistake of lasting proportions if we started the
shooting.''
   Ultimately, Bush may have to face the War Powers issue, although
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., drawing on his experience as
a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, suggested another
approach Thursday in a brief interview.
   Moynihan took the position the president has the authority to
send U.S. troops into action under Article 25 of the U.N. Charter,
which binds nations to abide by U.N. resolutions.
   As Moynihan explained it, the president could arrange with the
Security Council to make American troops available for combat under
a council resolution. But even then, the senator said, Congress
would have to approve the agreement.

<TEXT>
   A document written by Sen. Alan Cranston's
fund-raiser provides a textbook lesson in approaching political
donors and shows that the California Democrat never did so
unprepared.
   Ironically, Cranston, D-Calif., was told in the 1988 memo to be
aware of one couple's desire ``to keep Trent Lott out of the
Senate.''
   Lott, R-Miss., not only won, he's now one of the six Ethics
Committee members deciding how to proceed in an investigation of
Cranston and four other senators involved in helping Charles H.
Keating Jr., the former owner of the failed Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   The committee met Thursday without taking action and was
resuming deliberations today in the case of the ``Keating five''
senators.
   The panel is deciding whether to follow its special counsel's
advice to advance its investigation of Cranston, Sen. Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich. The
counsel advised dropping investigations against Sens. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   The 1988 memo from fund-raiser Joy Jacobson provided advice on
how Cranston should approach potential donors for a Democratic-run
voter registration project. Keating gave $850,000 to the project,
the bulk of the $1.3 million he and associates contributed to the
five senators' campaigns and causes.
   Jacobson advised Cranston to approach a California couple
``about giving $250,000 and giving directly to the efforts in four
states.''
   One was Mississippi because ``it will be a priority with them to
keep Lott out of the Senate.'' The memo said the couple knew
Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio ``is going to have a very
tough race,'' and so would Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
   The memo went on: ``North Carolina: you will need to explain how
this effort is building toward defeating (Republican Sen. Jesse)
Helms in 1990.''
   Jacobson also advised Cranston to approach Ann Cox Chambers, a
daughter of Cox Communications founder James Cox, and her daughter.
   ``Anne is an avid Democrat who was one of Jimmy Carter's biggest
supporters,'' the memo said. ``Before asking her for money, you
should determine what her main political interest currently is.
Rebuilding the Democratic Party in the South? (Sen. Albert) Gore
(D-Tenn.) for president? Southern Senate races? etc.''
   Cranston should approach Florida corporate chief executive
officers, the memo said, because ``these are all companies that
gave large amounts to Graham's races for governor.'' Bob Graham, a
Democrat, was governor of Florida and now is one of the state's
senators.
   The memo asked that Cranston meet with A. Dano Davis, saying:
``CEO of Winn-Dixie, we asked Graham to arrange this meeting
because Winn-Dixie is one of the companies that has given to
VoteAmerica, our Republican counterpart.''
   Winn-Dixie is a Florida-based supermarket chain.

<TEXT>
   The government and Ford Motor Co. are
investigating reports of brake disc corrosion in all Ford Taurus
and Mercury Sable models, a problem that could cause brakes to
fail.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday
it had upgraded the probe from a preliminary evaluation - an
examination of paperwork - to an engineering analysis, in which
engineers will study the possibly defective parts.
   The investigation could result in a recall.
   Ford said it was conducting its own investigation of all its
models that have the same brake rotor and hub assembly as the
Taurus and Sable. They include the Lincoln Continental, Ford
Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar.
   Agency spokesman Tim Hurd said there had been six complaints of
front disc brake corrosion in the Taurus and Sable. An estimated
1.8 million of the vehicles are on the road.
   The complaints allege that the discs deteriorate and fail. The
problem has been blamed for one accident and a minor injury.
   The problem appears to be centered in Northern climes where
roads are heavily salted in the winter, Hurd said.

   Charities not connected with the United Way
are getting a larger chunk of the contributions raised through
campaigns at the workplace, a report says.
   The report was issued Thursday by the National Committee for
Responsive Philanthropy, which has campaigned for giving workers
access to newer and smaller charities that are not usually part of
United Way campaigns. The committee, representing more than 300
fund-raising organizations, was established in 1976 to monitor
developments in philanthropy.
   Alternative organizations are getting 10.1 percent of the money
raised in workplace campaigns, the report said. Ten years ago, it
said, alternative groups got 3.5 percent of the total.
   Among the alternative organizations are some health agencies
such as the Muscular Dystrophy Association; international agencies
such as CARE and Oxfam America; arts funds; the United Negro
College Fund; and agencies that raise money for social action
causes and women's and environmental groups.
   All told, United Way campaigns are expected to raise $3.2
billion in contributions this year, two-thirds of it through
payroll deductions and other employee contribution programs.
Organizations not under the United Way umbrella are expected to
raise $205 million from employee contribution programs.

<HEAD>Surgeon General Expresses Concern About Fortified Wine Product</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young people may be drinking a fortified wine
product - containing 20 percent alcohol - unaware it is far more
potent than wine coolers, the surgeon general says.
   Surgeon General Antonia Novello said Thursday ``it scares me to
death'' that people, particularly young people, may buy Cisco
without realizing its high alcohol content.
   She said she is especially concerned that in some states the
product can be sold in convenience stores, and is often placed in
stores next to wine coolers, which have about 4 percent alcohol.
Ordinary table wines have about 12 percent alcohol content.
   Others, including the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug
Dependence, also have expressed concern about the product, made by
Canandaigua Wine Co. in Canandaigua, N.Y.
   ``This poses a serious safety and health risk,'' said Christine
Lubinski, a spokeswoman for the council's Washington office.
   A 100-pound person who drinks two 375 milliliter bottles of
Cisco within an hour could die from acute alcohol poisoning, she
said. A 150-pound person who drinks one bottle within an hour would
have a blood-alcohol content level of 0.11, which is more than the
legal limit for driving in all states but Georgia, she said.

<HEAD>Three Supremacists Convicted of Plotting To Bomb Gay Disco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal jury Thursday convicted three
white supremacists of plotting to firebomb a gay Seattle disco.
   The jury convicted Stephen Nelson, 35, of Hayden Lake, Robert
Winslow, 29, of Laclede, and Procter James Baker, 58, of Coeur
d'Alene, after deliberating three hours Wednesday night and all day
Thursday, said Jim Martin of U.S. District Judge Harold Ryan's
office.
   During 10 days of testimony from about 50 witnesses, defense
attorneys charged FBI informant Rico Renaldo Valentino encouraged
the three to take action and even bankrolled them.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Ron Howen rejected that allegation. He
played about 100 hours of secret recordings and videotapes of the
defendants as they said the back alley of the nightclub would
resemble a ``meat grinder'' when the homemade bombs exploded.
   The recorded conversations also included profanity-laced talk of
blowing up a Jewish synagogue and killing and maiming minorities in
the Puget Sound region.
   ``This is not just some fantasy,'' Howen said Wednesday in his
closing argument. ``This is real.''
   ``We were here because of what they did, not what they talked
about,'' Howen said after the ruling. ``They were constructing a
device for the purpose of killing, wounding and maiming people.''
   The trio is tied to the white separatist Aryan Nations (Church
of Jesus Christ, Christian) at Hayden Lake. Rev. Richard Butler,
founder of the white-separatist group, testified Valentino
displayed lots of money and bravado around the defendants.
   Butler earlier beat charges he intended to overthrow the
government. He declined to comment after Thursday's verdict.
   Nelson and Winslow face up to 25 years in prison. They were
convicted of conspiracy to bomb; knowingly making, receiving or
possessing bombs or grenades; carrying firearms in relation to a
crime of violence; and crossing state lines to commit a crime.
   The two were arrested May 12 near Seattle as they accompanied
Valentino in his van containing hidden FBI microphones.
   Inside the van, FBI agents found the makings of a firebomb: a
one-pound can of smokeless explosive powder, a portion of steel
pipe and screw-on end caps, fuse and a propane tank. Also
discovered were a loaded shotgun and revolver belonging to Nelson.
   Baker was arrested the same night at his Coeur d'Alene home. A
search of his Kendrick cabin yielded a partially assembled pipe
bomb. He was found guilty of conspiracy and bomb-possession counts,
which carries imprisonment of up to 15 years.
   Sentencing was set for Jan. 11.
   Valentino, a 53-year-old former professional wrestler who once
performed as the ``Masked Avenger,'' posed as a tax protester
fleeing the Internal Revenue Service to infiltrate the Aryan
Nations for 3{ years.

   The Senate passed a bipartisan budget early
Friday aiming the sting of deficit-reduction at virtually all
Americans, raising taxes on gasoline, alcohol and tobacco while
paring Medicare and other programs.
   Lawmakers adopted the measure 54-46, paving the way for
bargaining with the House and President Bush over a compromise bill
that could end the year-long budget stalemate. Negotiations were
set to begin later Friday.
   ``This is the first step we must take to reduce the staggering
deficits that are essentially bleeding us dry,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   The House has approved legislation relying heavily on tax hikes
on the wealthy to close the federal deficit. It contains no change
in the current 9 cents a gallon gasoline tax, which the Senate
would boost to 18{ cents. Both versions slash spending on programs
ranging from agriculture to veterans' benefits.
   The Senate approved the bill shortly before 1:30 a.m., ending a
long day that saw lawmakers dump an attempt to scale back the gas
tax increase and substitute a series of tax increases on the
wealthy. ``Let's go and get it from those who've got it,'' said
Sen. Barbara Mikulski, D-Md., but her plea was rejected, 55-45.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the
president was prepared to sign separate legislation keeping the
government in funds through next Wednesday. The House approved the
measure 379-37, and its expected quick approval by the Senate would
avert the threat of a second government shutdown in two weeks.
   With the immediate crisis of a closed-down government solved, a
new non-fiscal problem emerged. The famous Capitol dome sprung a
leak during a rainstorm, forcing workers to cover statues with
plastic sheets and prompting metaphorical comparisons between
Congress' home and its budget process.
   Lawmakers' eyes were on the calendar, with Election Day less
than three weeks off. To diffuse possible blame, Senate leaders
crafted a broadly based collection of $250 billion worth of new
taxes and spending reductions.
   Leading Democrats promised to try to change the bill during
negotiations with the House, though Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, acknowledged, ``We can't guarantee the result.''
   The president had said as recently as Monday that he would not
sign another emergency spending-authorization extension, but press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater said late Thursday that Bush would sign
a bill keeping the government going through next Wednesday if
``satisfactory progress'' was being made.
   Without such an extension, the government's authority to spend
money would expire Friday night.
   But the president also took the offensive, trying to turn the
tables on House Democrats who have spent the last few weeks
accusing him of protecting the rich.
   He said most Americans would be hurt by a House provision
delaying annual inflation adjustments in income-tax brackets and
personal exemptions.
   ``The opposition is trying to say `favor the rich,''' Bush said.
``I'm saying I'm favoring incentives, investment, and ...
protecting the working men and women of this country.''
   As senators neared the end of debate, they voted 69-31 for items
sought by airlines. Many local noise restrictions would be
superseded by federal rules to be written later, and limits on
flights into and out of airports in New York and Chicago would be
slightly relaxed.
   The tax increases and spending cuts were to be the lion's share
of $500 billion worth of deficit cuts over the next five years,
including $40 billion this year. Most of the rest of the savings
would come from defense cuts in separate legislation.
   Although that Senate-House bargaining was not expected to begin
formally until Thursday evening, some lawmakers were already
beginning to glimpse the shape of a final package.
   House Democrats meeting privately early in the day were told by
leaders that some gasoline tax increase was virtually inevitable,
said one lawmaker who demanded anonymity. But they said they would
demand some form of higher taxes on the rich in return.
   The House approved no gasoline tax increase in its budget. But
Democrats at the meeting seemed to agree that if the
9-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax was boosted by 6 cents, ``most of us
wouldn't go crazy,'' the lawmaker said.
   ``The major issue with us in the House is hanging onto some
notion of progressivity,'' said Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., a member
of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.
   House Budget Committee Chirman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said he
believed the House would also drop its provision halting, for one
year, the annual inflation adjustment made in income-tax brackets
and the personal exemption.
   Several Senate Republicans said they were not immovably opposed
to boosting the tax rate on the richest Americans to 31 percent
from its current 28 percent - depending on what trade-off they
received.
   ``The real question is whether 31 percent is OK with the
president,'' said Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis. ``We've just been told
31 percent is not OK, but we've also seen the president change his
mind before.''
   Just a week ago, Bush repeatedly shifted his position on whether
he would accept higher taxes on the rich.
   The president also had earlier said he would close the
government unless a deficit-reduction deal was completed by Friday
night - a deadline Congress seems all but certain to miss. But the
White House softened that Wednesday, saying the requirement was for
substantial progress in the right direction.
   The Senate measure limits deductions for people earning more
than $100,000, imposes the 1.45 percent Medicare tax on the
paychecks of many upper-middle class people for the first time, and
boosts levies on yachts and furs.
   It also raises the 9-cent-a-gallon federal gasoline tax to 18{
cents by 1992, increases levies on alcohol and tobacco products,
and makes Medicare benefits a bit less generous for 33 million
elderly and handicapped people.
   In contrast, majority Democrats pushed their own bill through
the House Tuesday that leans much more heavily on the country's
wealthy - a theme they hope will improve the party's election
prospects.
   The House bill raises the income-tax rate on the richest
Americans from 28 percent to 33 percent and adds a 10 percent tax
on people earning $1 million annually. It guarantees that no matter
how many deductions are claimed, a wealthy person would pay income
taxes of no less than 25 percent, an increase from the current 21
percent.
   The House measure reduces Medicare benefits by less than the
Senate would, and contains similar tax increases on alcohol,
tobacco and luxury items. But it gives a modest tax break to
middle-class people who sell property.

<HEAD>Man Charged After Tape of Child Abuse Found</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former maintenance man in this Washington
suburb is being held in a Texas jail on a morals charge after
police said a videotape showing him sexually abusing a 6-year-old
girl was found in his abandoned car.
   William Boyd McIntyre, 29, was arrested in New Boston, Texas, on
Tuesday and charged with indecency with a child by sexual contact,
a felony, police said. He was lodged in a Texarkana, Texas, jail in
lieu of $50,000 bail.
   Police said McIntyre's car, found abandoned in Interstate 95,
was about to be demolished last month at a wrecking yard when a
workman found the tape.
   He took it home, played it and then turned it over to police
after seeing scenes of a man molesting a young girl.
   New Boston Police Chief Kerry Pinkham told The Washington Post
that Fairfax police traced McIntyre to the Texas community, where
the young girl and McIntyre both resided. Authorities said the tape
was made in December 1987 and that the girl, now 9, apparently has
no memory of the incident.

   All you need to know to get into the Chicago
Blues Ensemble is how to pluck out a couple of chords and sing in
the shower.
   By the end of an eight-week course, students are transformed
into toe-tapping, hard-playing blues performers with dark glasses
and a new attitude. They're ready for their final exam - in a local
bar.
   ``Blues is the people's music,'' said Jon Spiegel, one of the
ensemble's directors. ``If you can plant the seed of obsession,
then it's really great. After that, you just stand back and
steer.''
   The training is open to all instruments and some students bring
in violins or dulcimers, but most favor guitars, pianos, basses and
harmonicas. Everybody has to sing a solo before they're through,
and the lessons teach more than music, Spiegel said.
   ``You can see the change in the students,'' he said. ``They
first come in wearing oxford shirts, and by the end of the eight
weeks they're wearing sharkskin suits and wide ties.''
   The program is offered by the Old Town School of Folk Music.
Typically, about 45 students of varying experience levels separate
to work in small groups. Most take music lessons during the week
and meet each Wednesday to apply the theories they've learned.
   ``You get a lot out of playing with other people of all levels
and from all walks of life,'' said George Minkel of Bridgeview.
``I've been a closet player for years. So this is wonderful.''
   Directors help students develop the best group sound, while
focusing on the emotional extremes that are the root of the blues,
Spiegel said.
   ``Play an angry note,'' Spiegel told a bass player during one of
the Wednesday night sessions. The student answered with a
screeching sound that bounced off the walls and echoed through the
room.
   ``Now, play one that's real sublime,'' Spiegel said. The
responding tone wafted mellowly around the room.
   The group then played a rendition of the blues standard
``Crossroads,'' with Rich Yeater, a mild-mannered computer
consultant, pounding the piano keys and belting out the lyrics.
   ``It's the first time I've done this,'' he said after his solo
singing debut. ``It's exciting, very different and a lot of fun.
Playing with a group forces you to be more disciplined.''
   Final exams take place in a local bar where the groups take the
stage during an open microphone night.
   ``The best thing about this class is that, while they probably
won't be the best group up there, they definitely won't be the
worse,'' Spiegel said.
   Some of the ensemble groups go on to perform regularly, but few
are willing to quit their day jobs for life in Chicago's smoky
blues clubs.
   ``Well, the option's always open,'' said Kevin Hauser, a
35-year-old train conductor and guitar player from suburban
Elmhurst. ``I'll wait to see if the audience wants an encore after
our first session.''

   A $15 billion child care bill, including
grants to states and a tax credit for poor families, was approved
by the Senate today as part of a deficit-reducing tax package.
   Senate leaders reached agreement with the Bush administration
earlier in the week on a scaled-down version of a bill providing
assistance to working families with children.
   They put the package into the budget bill and sent it back to
the House in an effort to break a year-long stalemate and bypass a
conference committee that has been unable to resolve differences.
   Rep. Gus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the House Education and
Labor Committee, called the Senate version disappointing and said
he would seek changes.
   The central element of the bill, $13 billion over five years, is
an expansion of the earned-income tax credit for low-income working
families with children. The cost would be offset by a continuation
of the 3 percent telephone excise tax, which otherwise would expire
at year-end.
   The other major element is a new program of grants to the states
for child care assistance. States could pass along the money
directly to families to offset part of their child care costs, or
the money could go as a subsidy to day care centers.
   The Senate bill would provide $2.5 billion over three years for
those grants, with money in the final two years to be negotiated
later. That is less than what House sponsors sought.
   Church-run child care centers would be eligible for the money.
   To reach agreement with the White House, Senate Democrats
accepted reduced federal safety and quality standards for child
care providers from previous versions of the bill, and removed
provisions expanding money for the Head Start child-development
program.
   Also eliminated is a provision passed by the House to provide
money for local governments to establish after-school child care
programs based in the public schools.
   Another key difference is in the structure of the grant program.
House sponsors wanted the program established under the Social
Security Act, which would make it an entitlement program that is
automatically in the budget. The Senate's version would require the
program to compete for appropriations each year.
   Federal child care assistance was backed by both presidential
candidates in 1988, but the issue has been stuck in conference
committee since clearing the House and Senate.

   Japan is planning a sweeping program to keep carbon
dioxide emissions from rising beyond 1990 levels in order to help
stop global warming, the governing Liberal Democratic Party said.
   The plan will be presented to the Cabinet for approval on
Tuesday, a party official said Thursday.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the plan
calls for more solar energy, nuclear power, hydraulic power and
rail transportation. It also includes using heat from trash
incinerators to generate electricity and developing low-pollution
automobiles.
   The Environment Agency said Japan discharges 2.5 tons of carbon
dioxide per person each year, twice the world average but about
half that of the United States.
   Carbon dioxide from the burning of oil and coal are blamed for
the ``greenhouse effect,'' which raises world atmospheric
temperatures and could cause harmful changes in the weather.

   The refugees had been at sea for about 10 days when the USS

   He said the boat was crowded and found not to be seaworthy, and
the Vietnamese were allowed to board the frigate. The boat was
found about 350 miles off the coast of the Philippines.
   Saunders said the refugees would be taken to the Philippines and

   Fear of in-flight clashes between
militant smokers and non-smokers has prompted Lufthansa to drop
plans to ban smoking on domestic flights, the airline says.
   The national German carrier had planned to ban smoking on the
flights with the start of its winter schedule on Oct. 28.
   But Lufthansa said Thursday that passenger reaction to its plans
had been ``extremely divided,'' although a majority of smokers had
indicated their willingness to accept the ban.
   But since federal lawmakers had decided not to pass no-smoking
legislation, barring smoking on flights could lead to
``polarization and confrontations among passengers,'' the airline
said.
   It said it could not allow passengers and cabin crews to be
involved in such situations.
   Smoking is banned on U.S. domestic flights.

   Defense Minister Safa Giray has resigned,
becoming the second minister in a week to leave the government,
according to news reports.
   In a letter to Prime Minister Yildirim Akbulut, Giray said he
was stepping down because he was ``convinced that the relationship
of trust between us has been damaged,'' the semiofficial Anatolia
news agency reported Thursday.
   The report did not elaborate, and further information was not

   Giray, 59, a civil engineer, had been defense minister since
March 1989 and served in all Cabinets since 1983.
   Foreign Minister Ali Bozer resigned last Friday after Turkish
media reports that President Turgut Ozal had taken over foreign

   The government will halt airline flights and sea traffic at its

   Libya marks Oct. 26 as the ``Day of Mourning,'' commemorating
the deportation of 4,000 Libyans to remote Italian islands during
colonial rule between 1911 and World War II.
   In recent years, Libya has renewed claims for reparations from
the colonial period. The Italian government says it met its
obligations with payment of $6.7 million under a 1956 agreement
with the Libyan monarchy.
   Gadhafi deposed the monarch in a 1969 coup.

   A Puerto Rican cargo ship rescued
four Cuban lifeguards who spent five days in the Atlantic in a
rubber dinghy after fleeing their homeland, U.S. immigration
officials said.
   The men set sail Saturday and were rescued Wednesday 25 miles
north of Cuba, said Monserrate Diaz, a spokesman for the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   ``They're in good shape because they're all lifeguards,'' Diaz
said. All four are in their 20s, he said.
   He said the Cubans fired flare guns when they sighted the cargo
ship, the Sea Land Consumer.
   Diaz said the Cubans told authorities they fled their country
because they wanted freedom and were ``living like prisoners.'' He
did not elaborate.
   Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the Cubans
had hoped to reach Key West, Fla., and were seeking political
asylum in the United States.

   Of course you film fans are familiar with the
classic ``Killers of Sheep.'' Or the unforgettable ``Primary.'' How
about the evergreen ``Meshes of the Afternoon''?
   OK, so maybe not.
   Those three head-scratchers were among 25 films selected to join
the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.
   The Registry's second list, announced Thursday in Washington,
tilted heavily toward the often neglected documentary, which
comprised 20 percent of the selections.
   Included were the admirable ``Harlan County, U.S.A.,'' Barbara
Kopple's 1977 Oscar-winning study of a Kentucky coal miners'
strike, and ``The River,'' Pare Lorentz's lyrical plea for soil
reclamation, made for the government in 1937.
   The other three documentaries selected may be worthy of
``treasure'' status also, but are they more deserving than ``City
Lights,'' ``Stagecoach'' or ``Rear Window,'' which didn't make the
list in 1989 or this year?
   James H. Billington, the librarian of Congress, explained that
films on the list were chosen because they ``impressively display
the depth and variety of the American creative spirit'' in
filmmaking.
   ``This is not Academy Awards night,'' Billington said. ``These
are not annual lists of the `best' American films.''
   The new list shows a healthy regard for the comedy: Howard
Hawks' wacky ``Bringing Up Baby'' from 1938; Harold Lloyd's best
silent, ``The Freshman,'' from 1925; Greta Garbo's only comedy,
``Ninotchka,'' a 1939 film directed by Ernst Lubitsch; and the
madcap 1933 Marx Brothers' feature, ``Duck Soup.''
   The musical was recognized with the best of Fred Astaire and
Ginger Rogers, ``Top Hat,'' from 1935; the Maurice Chevalier
romance, ``Love Me Tonight,'' produced and directed by Rouben
Mamoulian in 1932; and Walt Disney's ``Fantasia,'' from 1940.
   Coincidentally, ``Fantasia'' is in re-release and winning far
more praise and patronage ($11 million in 10 days) than when it was
first shown.
   Some choices were unassailable: ``All About Eve,'' ``All Quiet
on the Western Front,'' ``Dodsworth,'' ``The Godfather,'' ``Raging
Bull,'' ``Red River,'' ``Rebel without a Cause,'' ``Sullivan's
Travels,'' ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.''
   John Cassavetes' 1974 ``A Woman Under the Influence'' was a more
idiosyncratic selection. Cassavetes was a pace-setter of the new
realism, but his films, including this one, were often overlong and
self-indulgent.
   Last year's list produced only one head-scratcher: ``The
Learning Tree,'' Gordon Parks' 1969 reminiscence of his Kansas
childhood, admirable but hardly a classic.
   Charles Burnett made ``Killers of Sheep'' in 1977, ``Meshes of
the Afternoon'' is an 18-minute film directed by Maya Deren in 1943
and ``Primary'' is a Time Inc. film made in 1960.
   ``All About Eve'' was made in 1950 by director Joseph L.
Mankiewicz. ``All Quiet on the Western Front'' was directed by
Lewis Milestone in 1930. ``Dodsworth'' was a 1936 film directed by
William Wyler. Francis Ford Coppola made ``The Godfather'' in 1972.
   Martin Scorsese directed ``Raging Bull'' in 1980. Nicholas Ray
directed James Dean in ``Rebel Without a Cause'' in 1955. Hawks
made ``Red River'' in 1948. ``Sullivan's Travels'' is a Preston
Sturges film made in 1941. John Huston directed ``The Treasure of
the Sierra Madre'' in 1948.
   Also named to the 1990 list were Edwin S. Porter's ``The Great
Train Robbery,'' a 12-minute classic made in 1903; John Ford's
``How Green Was My Valley'' from 1941; and Frank Capra's ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' from 1946.
   The 1988 law that established the National Film Registry called
for 25 registry listings each year for three successive years. It
requires companies to label videocassettes of films on the list
that have been colorized or otherwise tampered with.
   This year's list was based on 1,500 nominations from the public.
It was narrowed by a 14-member National Film Preservation Board
representing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the
American Film Institute, movie and television producers, directors,
broadcasters, screen writers, the Screen Actors Guild of America,
film critics and scholars.
   The final choices were made by Billington, a cultural historian
and movie buff, based on consultations with advisers including the
staff of the library's division of motion picture, broadcasting and
recorded sound.
   Films are eligible for the registry 10 years after their first
theatrical release. They need not necessarily be American films,
the library said, but the first 50 movies in the registry all were
made in the United States.

   A new poll indicates 70 percent of the people in
Britain, Germany, France, Italy and Spain support the use of
military force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   The survey, commissioned by British Kuwaitis, also says 69
percent approve of President Bush's decision to send armed forces
to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.
   Britons are the most ``hawkish'' of the Europeans: 86 percent
percent back military action to free Kuwait and 80 percent support
Bush's action, according to the poll released Thursday by Gallup, a
leading British poll company.
   In a corresponding U.S. poll, 70 percent of Americans said they
supported Bush's decision to move troops into the gulf.
   ``It seems George Bush would do better in this country than his
own,'' Gordon Heald, Gallup managing director, told a news
conference.
   Heald said British public opinion had hardened since a Gallup
poll in September, when only 75 percent supported the use of force
to free Kuwait.
   An average of 67 percent across the five countries said they
support the use of military action to protect the West's oil
supplies, the survey found.
   Sixty-one percent overall favor military action to defend Saudi
Arabia and the gulf states. Fifty-eight percent overall support the
use of military force to topple Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
researchers found.
   Youssef al-Youssef, a spokesman for Britain's Kuwaiti community,
said: ``We have always viewed Britain and the United States as
being the world leaders in the gulf crisis. It is very pleasing to
see this is reflected in public opinion.''
   Britain, France, Italy and Spain have contributed to the
U.S.-led international force which has been deployed in the Persian
Gulf since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2. Germany's Constitution
prevents it from doing the same.
   Gallup questioned 500 people in each of the five countries for
the poll, commissioned by the London-based Association for Free
Kuwait. The margin of error is 5 percent.
   Heald said 86 percent of Britons support military action to free
Westerners prevented from leaving Kuwait and Iraq. Sixty-three
percent support military action even if it means putting hostages'
lives at risk, he said.
   ``I find this staggering, because Britain has by far the most
hostages,'' Heald said. The Foreign Office says 1,400 Britons are
still trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   In France, the survey found, 75 percent support military action
to free Kuwait, and 82 percent back military action to free the
hostages. But only 49 percent support military action if it means
putting hostages at risk.
   Seventy-three percent are firmly behind Bush's response to the
Iraqi invasion.
   In Germany, 63 percent favor the use of force to free Kuwait, 70
percent back military action to free the hostages and 75 percent
support Bush's decision.
   Heald said Spain and Italy were the least supportive: only 59
percent of Italians and 66 percent of Spaniards back military
action to free Kuwait.
   Only 59 percent of Italians and 53 percent of Spaniards approve
of Bush's decision to move troops into the gulf.

   Leftist guerrillas bombed the German Embassy,
power lines and about 10 other targets, blacking out half of the
capital, police said.
   Police had no immediate details on casualties or damage from the
attacks Thursday night, but early reports indicated a private guard
was killed in an attack that set a steel foundry afire.
   The Shining Path guerrillas also lit fires in the shape of the
communist hammer and sickle on hills above Lima, typical of their
night attacks.
   Police said they detained 400 suspects.
   The guerrillas carried out at least a dozen attacks
simultaneously Thursday evening, said police. Targets included a
shopping center, a police station, state mining company offices and
a hydroelectrical station.
   The rebels bombed high tension towers on the outskirts of the
capital, blacking out half of Lima, police said.
   Television reports showed extensive damage to the arage of the
German Embassy, and witnesses said they saw a woman place an
explosive at the garage door. The embassy had no immediate comment.
   The Maoist Shining Path have often attacked embassies in the
past, calling them ``representatives of imperialism.''
   The attacks broke a lull in violence in the capital. Human
rights groups say more than 500 people were killed in September,
the highest toll of the year, but few attacks occurred in Lima.

<HEAD>Movie Version of Orwell's `1984' to Premiere in Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union soon will be watching Big
Brother.
   The movie version of George Orwell's bleak classic ``1984,''
depicting the terrifying world of an omnipresent government, will
have its Soviet premiere in the next few months, its executive
producer said.
   Marvin J. Rosenblum, a Chicago lawyer who bought the rights for
the movie in 1980 from Orwell's widow, said the film will be shown
in Moscow in conjunction with a conference sponsored by the
Cinemacentre on ``Art, Politics and Freedom of Expression.''
   ``It's like breaking down the Berlin Wall,'' Rosenblum said
Thursday night.
   Orwell wrote his fictional account of total conformity, thought
control and constant surveillance in 1948 and published it in 1949.
The Soviet government didn't even acknowledge its existence until
1984, when it published a review.
   Excerpts from the novel, including the omnipresent warning of
Orwell's imaginary regime that ``Big Brother is Watching You,''
first were published in Soviet newspapers in 1988 as tight
restrictions on information eased under Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   But Soviet people had read copies smuggled into the country,
Rosenblum said. ``I've talked to a lot of Russians, and there's
always been a lot of interest in it. All the intellectuals are
aware of it.''
   While a date for the showing has not been set, Rosenblum said he
expects it will come in early December or January. He is about to
begin negotiations with Soviet distributors for nationwide showings
of the film, made in 1984 and starring John Hurt and Richard Burton
in his last movie before his death that year.
   No political problems exist in negotiating a distribution
contract, Rosenblum said. Previously only one agency had permission
to import films, but that has changed.
   ``Now just about anybody can do it,'' Rosenblum said, adding
that a person must be sure whom he's dealing with to make sure he
gets paid.
   ``I'm willing to take payment in rubles,'' he said. ``I'm just
going to look for a reputable distributor who's going to do a good
job getting it out to the Russian people.''
   The film has been shown in at least 20 countries, but not in
most of the Soviet bloc.
   Rosenblum bought the rights to distribute the film in the Soviet
Union for an undisclosed amount from the British company Virgin
Vision, whose parent company had put up the $8 million to film the
story.
   Orwell wrote ``1984'' in 1948 as the Cold War between the United
States and the Soviet Union was turning into a deep freeze. Orwell
said the novel was meant to depict any totalitarian government,
left or right, and not the Soviet Union in particular.
   But the book was often read as an indictment of the Soviet
system and became required reading in many American high schools. A
generation of students learned of the world of doublespeak where
war means peace, the Ministry of Truth disburses lies and the
Thought Police can set straight anyone who doesn't love Big
Brother.
   An earlier movie version of ``1984'' came out in 1955 and was
received so poorly Orwell's widow vowed never to let it be filmed
again.

<HEAD>Senate Approves 23 Diplomatic Nominees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate early today approved 23 of
President Bush's nominees for diplomatic posts, but only after
Republican leaders threatened to hold GOP opponents of the
nominations on duty for an all-night session.
   Among the nominees approved on a block vote, after the Senate
completed action on a deficit-reduction bill, was George Fleming
Jones as ambassador to the tiny South American state of Guyana.
   Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the top Republican on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a frequent thorn in the side
of State Department officials, had vehemently opposed Jones'
nomination.
   However, ``holds'' that any single senator can put on a nominee
to block or delay Senate confirmation were removed from the 23
nominees Thursday after Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas
suggested keeping the Senate in session through the night to act on
them.
   ``These people have families and have made plans,'' Dole said.
``It's unfair to keep them twisting in the wind.''
   Under the Senate's complex parliamentary rues, continuing to
block their confirmation would have required opponents - but hardly
anyone else - to remain on the Senate floor.
   Helms, according to sources who asked not to be identified, has
suspected Jones, a career foreign service officer, of being
involved in the 1986 leak of a secret Chilean report about the
death of an American during a violent protest in Santiago. The
senator was infuriated when his own office was blamed for the leak.
   Among the other nominations of career foreign service officers
confirmed to ambassadorial posts today were Eugene Scassa for
Belize, Richard C. Brown for Uruguay, Michael Martin Skol for
Venezuela, Stephen Rogers for Swaziland and Gordon L. Streeb for
Zambia.

   George Washington has been found innocent of
treason against the British crown in a mock trial which featured
real British and American judges and lawyers and actors playing
historical figures.
   The participants playing Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin
Franklin and Lord North, the British prime minister during the
American Revolution, testified at the trial set in 1779, which was
filmed Thursday for television.
   The American statesmen, in 18th century dress, were played by
members of the Philadelphia-based Royal Pickwickians, a troupe
which combines acting with historical research. North was played by
Prof. Bruce Collins also in period costume.
   Washington, speaking through Bill Sommerfield, who played him,
said he was elated by the unanimous ruling of the three judges.
   ``Justice has been done,'' he said. ``We've been vindicated and
now I must go back and pursue the war with vigor and bring it to a
just conclusion.''
   The armistice ending the Revolutionary War was not announced
until 1783.
   The team of American defense attorneys argued that Washington
acted in self-defense since the British had declared war in effect
with their litany of abuses, hurting the colonists economically and
depriving them of liberties.
   ``We have a right to defend ourselves to resist those acts of
tyranny,'' James Figliulo, another Chicago lawyer told the court.
``We ask only to be free, we ask only to govern ourselves. We tried
time and time again to address our grievances and make our point.
Those petitions, remonstrances and requests were repeatedly
rejected by the Parliament and the King.''
   The defense argued that Lord North and King George III had
treated the colonists like slaves.
   Prosecuting Washington under the Treason Act of 1351 was Sydney
Kentridge, the human rights lawyer who defended Steven Biko in
South Africa. He argued that the conditions in the colonies could
not have been so bad since 221,000 people had migrated to America
between 1760-75.
   ``The moral pretensions of this case are ill-founded,''
Kentridge said. ``What is this slavery that the Colonies say they
have, which thousands of people cross the Atlantic to be part of.''
   In his summing up, Kentridge called on the three judges hearing
the case not to find Washington guilty of treason which is
punishable by hanging, but to ``make a declaration that Washington
was guilty of treason,'' and allow him to return to America.
   The three judges - Lord Bridge of Harwich, a senior Law Lord;
Sir Patrick Neill, a British appellate judge; and U.S. Federal
Judge A. Sherman Christensen from Utah - ruled that the way Britain
governed the colonies forced the Americans to react.
   The colonists ``only as a last resort, were driven to the
Declaration of Independence,'' Lord Bridge said.
   The defense attorneys' wives and other Americans, in the
audience of 280 which paid $34 to watch the trial, waved tiny
colonial American flags as the verdict was announced.
   The International Scholarships for Young Lawyers will receive
the proceeds from the trial, which will be shown at a later date on
British and U.S. television.
   The trial came about after Lord Goff, a member of the House of
Lords made the treason charge at a June meeting of the American
Inns of Court Foundation.
   Lawyers from Chicago and New Jersey took up the gauntlet and
traveled to the history-laden Lincoln's Inn for the trial.
   The Inn, an oasis of Georgian office buildings and tidy gardens
in central London, was founded in the 14th century. It is the
oldest of four Inns of Court which train and admit barristers,
lawyers who argue cases in Britain's senior courts.
   Barristers-in-training must spend 18 months following senior
barristers through the courts and the Inns, so-called because many
barristers used to work and live there.

   The U.S. dollar firmed against the yen Friday in
Tokyo for the first time in two weeks, while this week's
bullishness on the stock market continued.
   Although it opened at a 22-month low of 124.75 yen, the dollar
regained lost ground to finish at 125.25, up .85 yen from
Thursday's close of 124.40 yen. The currency ranged between 124.05
yen and 125.45 yen.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average closed
at 24,481.49, up 114.41 points, or .47 percent, from Thursday's
close of 24,367.08 points.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 10-year government bonds fell
slightly to 84.53 points at 2 a.m. EDT from their previous close of
84.73. Their yield rose to 7.795 percent from 7.750 percent.
   Currency dealers said caution among buyers about the weekend,
typical on Fridays, prevailed.
   ``Market players are wary about the speed of the dollar's fall
yesterday. So the dollar will not fall radically today, unless for
some reason it drops below 123 yen,'' said Katsunobu Motohashi of
Yasuda Trust and Banking.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Friday he was not
considering any measures to support the dollar. The dollar's
decline is not ``abnormal'' or ``too fast,'' he said.
   Buyers were also cautious on the stock exchange, traders said.
Many were stalling their purchases for next week, said Nobunao
Nakamura of Nomura Securities co.
   Stocks that had fallen in the past, including shipbuilding,
finance and non-life insurance shares, rose. Foreign buyers also
boosted prices, Nakamura said.

<HEAD>Pakistani Politicians Striking At United States To Hit Ms. Bhutto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Benazir Bhutto's political opponents
have found a potent response to growing sympathy for the ousted
prime minister: America-bashing.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan ousted Ms. Bhutto, accusing her of
corruption and mismanagement, on Aug. 6. She is running in next
week's general election despite facing a court battle.
   Khan's hand-picked caretaker government is pressing an
aggressive campaign against her. It has filed charge after charge
against her, her father-in-law and a half-dozen former Cabinet
ministers alleging they used their power to get rich fast. It
jailed her husband on charges of kidnapping and extortion.
   The government also branded Ms. Bhutto an unbeliever, an enemy
of Islam and a traitor.
   But the initial onslaught only damaged the credibility of the
president and the caretaker government, making both appear
vindictive and generating sympathy for Ms. Bhutto and her populist,
center-left Pakistan People's Party.
   It seemed nothing could stop her unexpected rebound.
   Then U.S. Ambassador Robert Oakley, in a speech in Washington,
noted that Ms. Bhutto's opponents are not above reproach.
Pakistanis have voiced similar views, but many were outraged by
Oakley's comments.
   Newspapers wrote numerous editorials accusing Washington of
blatant interference and suggested U.S. influence over this country
of 110 million people should be greatly curtailed. Some caretaker
ministers called Oakley's statements undiplomatic; one demanded
that Washington replace him.
   Pakistan is the third-largest recipient of American aid after
Egypt and Israel. It also has been conduit for an estimated $300
million in assistance to the Moslem resistance during the
12-year-old war in Afghanistan.
   The Oakley fire subsided briefly. Then 53 U.S. senators
reportedly wrote a letter to President Bush warning that economic
and military aid would be cut off if Ms. Bhutto were disqualified
from the election.
   Forty-four Pakistani senators wrote a blistering response,
saying that was a matter for the court - not the U.S. Congress - to
decide.
   In the rhetoric of the People's Party, Ms. Bhutto ``became the
American puppet, someone willing to give away her country's
sovereignty,'' said one Western diplomat, insisting on anonymity.
   ``It played nicely into her opponents' hands,'' the diplomat
said. ``They parlayed it nicely into an election issue and dampened
the PPP. Now the momentum may be swinging the other way.''
   Ms. Bhutto, who was educated in the United States, is considered
by many in the West, especially the United States, as a symbol of
democracy in South Asia. She has capitalized on that image and
cemented strong ties to Washington.
   An undercurrent of anti-Americanism always runs through
Pakistan, which tends to blame the United States for all its
problems during times of crises.
   It surfaced again on Oct. 1 when Washington suspended a $573
million aid package demanding greater assurances that Pakistan
neither possesses nor wants to possess nuclear weapons.
   The caretaker government blamed Ms. Bhutto for the aid
suspension, a charge she dismissed.
   ``Ms. Bhutto, her mother and the PPP have been lobbying in the
United States to get our aid stopped,'' caretaker Prime Minister
Ghulam Mustafa Jatoi charged Thursday, referring to the Pakistan
People's Party.
   ``They have been working against the national interest for the
sake of their petty benefit to pressure the government of Pakistan
and to win in the election,'' he said.
   Even though he mentioned no one by name, Pakistan's most
powerful soldier, Army Chief-of-Staff Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, issued
his own warning - to the Americans and to Pakistan's next prime
minister. Military sources said it was the first time he has made
such comments.
   In an hourlong speech to his troops earlier this week, Beg vowed
Pakistan would not compromise its principles. He warned leaders not
to look for ``outside direction or guidance.
   ``And those looking for such political guidance and support for
promoting their political ambitions are certain to be frustrated,''
he said.
   ``There's a lot of nationalism now in Pakistan,'' said one
Commonwealth diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``There's a growing feeling that Pakistan needs to be more aligned
with the Islamic world and less with the Western world.''

   A scientist dismissed from an Environmental

vigorous tobacco industry lobbying says he will fight to be

   The industry charged that the scientist's ``long and intense

colleagues said his credentials are impeccable.
   Dr. David Burns of the University of California, San Diego,
learned Thursday he had been removed from the EPA's Scientific
Advisory Board studying the dangers of second-hand cigarette smoke.
   The dismissal ``damages my credibility and the credibility of
the panel, and as a matter of public policy I feel compelled to try
to reverse the decision,'' he said. ``It is a substantial insult to
my professional status, and I can't let that go unanswered.''
   Stephen Bayard, manager of the EPA project to assess passive
smoking's health risks, said ``I've never seen anything like this''
in 12 years at the agency.
   ``I'm disturbed about this,'' he said. ``I think it was lousy. I
think it shows undue pressure, personally, from the tobacco
companies and the Congress.''
   Burns said he had been told in an Aug. 10 letter he was on the
EPA panel. The same day, the Tobacco Institute, an industry group,
wrote EPA Administrator William Reilly protesting Burns' selection.
   ``Frankly, we are mystified how an individual with Dr. Burns's
long and intense involvement with the antismoking movement can be
expected to contribute to a reasonable, objective examination'' of
the EPA reports, the letter said.
   Burns has worked on the surgeon general's smoking reports since
the 1970s. He was editor of the 1986 report that said passive
smoking can cause disease including lung cancer in healthy
non-smokers.
   Brennan Dawson, a Tobacco Institute spokeswoman, said, ``We want
a fair panel that will look at it objectively. Our concern is that
Mr. Burns is unable to do that.''
   On Sept. 18, Rep. Thomas Bliley, R-Va., wrote the EPA without
mentioning Burns by name but urging the panel ``consist of
qualified individuals who have not already prejudged this issue in
any manner.''
   Bliley is a strong tobacco industry ally. Philip Morris is the
largest private employer in his congressional district. Bayard said
Bliley's letter was factor was a factor in Burns' dismissal.
   Burns said: ``I am surprised that an EPA review would be swayed
by pressure from the tobacco industry on an issue of science, when
the tobacco industry is on record as disputing even the scientific
evidence that cigarette smoking is related to lung cancer with
active smokers.''
   Robert Flaak of the advisory panel, who told Burns he had been
removed, said he could not comment on the decision.
   Donald Shopland, coordinator of the National Cancer Institute's
smoking control program, defended Burns, his long-time colleague.
   ``I don't know of anyone else you could point to that would have
the degree of expertise he would possess on smoking in general and
the whole issue of passive smoking in particular,'' Shopland said.
   Bayard said Burns was among 16 or 17 researchers who already had
submitted a preliminary review of the EPA's report on passive
smoking's health risks, and Burns' comments ``were by far the best
comments that I received.''
   Bayard said he was concerned Burns' exclusion would compromise
the final report's quality.
   ``If I feel there's tampering with the committee, am I going to
get a good review out of it? I have my concerns,'' he said.

<HEAD>AIDS Carrier Convicted of Exposing Boy to Killer Virus</HEAD>

   An AIDS carrier was convicted of exposing an
8-year-old boy to the killer virus in a sexual assault case that
was the first test of the state's novel AIDS exposure law.
   Randall Lee Dempsey, 34, was found guilty Thursday of criminal
transmission of HIV, the organism that causes AIDS, and aggravated
sexual assault.
   Jurors deliberated more than 11 hours before convicting Dempsey
of forcing the boy to perform oral sex. The boy had testified
against Dempsey.
   Dempsey could face up to 30 years in prison on the assault count
and a maximum seven-year term on the AIDS exposure count.
   The Illinois AIDS exposure law, which took effect in September
1989, requires only that offenders know they are infected when they
engage in activities that could transmit the virus to others.
   Conviction does not require that the victim develop AIDS. One of
the main ways the disease is spread is through sexual contact.
   Dempsey, of rural Marion in south-central Illinois, twice tested
positive for HIV, the AIDS virus. The boy, now 9, has not been
tested to see if he carries the virus. He was attacked in May and
his mother said ultimately he will be tested.
   The man, who moved back to Illinois from California after
learning he carried the AIDS virus, denied the charges and claimed
the boy fabricated the tale with his mother's help.
   The boy reported the sexual encounter the following morning
after Dempsey tried to silence him with promises of a pet turtle,
Williamson County prosecutor Charles Garnati said.
   
   Defense lawyer Larry Broeking told jurors during closing
arguments, ``The defendant uncategorically denies that it
happened.''

   Angola's Marxist government and
U.S.-backed rebels locked in a 15-year-old war have agreed to a
U.N. plan to ship food to 1.9 million Angolans threatened by
famine, U.N. officials said.
   ``United Nations relief convoys will begin to move urgently
needed humanitarian supplies to drought and war-induced famine
areas in Angola effective Nov. 1,'' U.N. spokesman Francois
Giuliani said Tuesday.
   The operation involving 130 million tons of food and other
relief supplies will cover nine of Angola's 18 provinces, officials
said.
   The Angolan relief plan is based on the methods used by
Operation Lifeline Sudan, which established ``corridors of
tranquility'' in Sudan so food could be shipped to the rebel-held
south, and garrison towns there controlled by the government.
   Operation Lifeline Sudan is believed to have saved 100,000
Sudanese lives in 1989-90.
   In Angola, ``The question of the safety of relief workers and
the security of relief convoys ontinues to be of prime concern top
the United Nations, considering that a cease-fire has yet to be
declared,'' said a U.N. announcement.
   Peace talks between the UNITA rebels and the government of
President Eduardo dos Santos have failed to produce an agreement.
   ``Firm assurances have been sought and received from the
government of Angola and UNITA that they will facilitate the safe
passage of convoys, ensure the safety of relief personnel and fully
support'' the relief program, it said.
   Officials from the World Food Program and the U.N. Children's
Fund have made safe-passage arrangements with the government for
the areas it controls, and will meet shortly with UNITA
representatives to make similar plans for rebel-held territory.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar will launch an
international fund appeal for the program in November.
   The first phase of the program, from October 1990 through the
end of March 1991, is expected to cost about $75 million, mostly
for food and logistics, but with about $22.5 earmarked for non-food
supplies and services.
   Angola, once one of southern Africa's more prosperous nations,
has been reduced to abject poverty by civil war since 1975 with
Jonas Savimbi's rebels, who take their name, UNITA, from the
Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total Liberation
of Angola.
   Perez de Cuellar said he hoped that the relief operation will
``help to promote the peace process that is already under way.''
   Savimbi and dos Santos met for peace talks in June, 1989, in
Gbadolite, Zaire, to sign peace accords, but the process broke down
over misunderstandings over Savimbi's future political role and the
war resumed.
   Cuban troops are withdrawing from Angola, however, under the
southern Africa accords that led to Namibia's independence, and the
Soviet Union and United States are trying to help their proxies
resolve the conflict.

<HEAD>Computer Companies Will Delete Offending Symbols From Games</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Swastikas and a Star of David will be deleted
from two companies' computer games after the Anti-Defamation League
of B'nai B'rith complained, the games' makers said.
   A spokeswoman for the New York-based ADL said the league
contacted NEC Technologies and Nintendo of America earlier this
year asking that the symbols be removed from two computer games and
an instruction booklet.
   ``In letters to ADL, both companies informed the league that
they had taken action to have the offensive symbols removed,''
spokeswoman Barbara Walden said Thursday.
   Walden said NEC's ``Syber Corp'' game uses swastikas as weapons
in action scenes. The object of its ``Neutopia'' game is to destroy
``bosses,'' one of whom wears the six-pointed Star of David on his
chest.
   She said Nintendo's ``Legend of Zelda'' has a swastika in its
instruction booklet.
   Grant Schneider, a spokesman for Wood Dale, Ill.-based NEC, said
the company was surprised by the ADL request.
   ``We have third-party software developers who develop the
games,'' Schneider said. ``Somehow, whoever programmed these things
apparently put these in.''
   ``We notified the game developers ... and said they had to
remove these from the games,'' he said.
   He said if any consumer who purchased one of the games is
offended, NEC will replace the game with another of the consumer's
choosing.
   Schneider also said NEC would beef up the screening process to
make sure offensive images don't appear in games in the future.
   Richard Lindner, a spokesman for the Redmond, Wash.-based
Nintendo, said the symbol in the ``Legend of Zelda'' instruction
booklet is not, technically, a swastika.
   ``It's something called a manji,'' Lindner said. ``It's a
reversed swastika symbol that has significance in the Hindu
religions and other Asian religions.''
   But Lindner said Nintendo will remove the symbol and, further,
has invited the ADL to conduct a sensitivity training session for
its game developers.
   ``Nintendo has a pretty stringent software development
standard,'' Lindner said. ``Things that are offensive to any
particular religious group are not supposed to be in games.''

<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TV replay of last year's San
Francisco earthquake caused panic among many residents of a
northern Philippine city that was ravaged by an earthquake in July.
   The tension Thursday in the mountain resort city of Baguio died
down only after authorities at the U.S.-run Camp John Hay explained
that footage shown by the Far East Network were from the San
Francisco earthquake, which occurred Oct. 18 last year.
   Local reporters in Baguio, about 130 miles north of Manila, said
he old TV reports caused hundreds of residents to leave their
homes and stay outdoors, causing heavy pedestrian and vehicular
traffic. Schools and offices shut down.
   FEN is the U.S. military's television in the Philippines and is
widely viewed by Filipinos living near the six U.S.-run military
bases in the country. Camp John Hay is a U.S. rest and recreational
facility in Baguio.
   In July, an earthquake which measured 7.7 on the Richter scale
hit a wide area in the northern Philippines, leaving nearly 1,700
people dead and widespread damage. In Baguio, at least 400 people
died in the temblor.
   More than 1,070 aftershocks of that earthquake have been
recorded. The last one which was strong enough to be felt occurred
last Sunday.
   The FEN aired old footage of the San Francisco earthquake which
included ``bulletin notices.'' Many residents mistook the messages
as new bulletins, causing the panic, reporters added.
   The earthquake that hit the San Francisco-Oakland area measured
7.1 on the Richter scale and killed 67 people.

<HEAD>Carbon Monoxide Reaches `Potential Hazard' Levels In 2 Tractor
Pulls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tractor pulls can produce not only noise and
skidmarks but potentially hazardous levels of carbon monoxide,
federal health officials say.
   Tractor pulls typically feature a dozen or so truck rigs
outfitted with super-powerful engines competing in pulling 50-ton
sleds across a dirt floor.
   Carbon monoxide levels during two tractor pulls in a Winnipeg,
Manitoba, hockey arena ``represented a potential health hazard to
both participants and observers,'' the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control reported Thursday.
   Carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas in all exhaust and
smoke, can cause headache, dizziness, cardiac problems and even
death.
   The problems may not occur at other tractor pulls. U.S. health
officials aren't sure whether the problem was peculiar to Winnipeg
Arena, where attempts to decrease carbon monoxide levels didn't
work.
   ``I wish I knew,'' said Dr. Ruth Etzel, a researcher with the
Center for Environmental Health at the Atlanta-based CDC. ``We
would certainly like to see some data so we would know if this is a
problem.
   `We were quite surprised at the levels of carbon monoxide that
can build up in these things.''
   The findings from the 1988 events at Winnipeg Arena prompted the
cancellation of a February 1989 tractor pull in the building,
constructed in the early 1950s.
   Health officials didn't report any incidents of carbon monoxide
poisoning during either Winnipeg event, although some members of
the ambulance crew did report severe headaches, Etzel said.
   But the officials urged arena officials not to allow future
tractor pulls, and the arena management agreed, said Rod Thiessen,
director of operations for Winnipeg Arena. ``They've never come
back and made them safe enough,'' he said.
   At the start of a February 1988 pull at Winnipeg, health
inspectors measured airborne carbon monoxide levels averaging 62
parts per million - nearly twice the Winnipeg Health Department's
recommended indoor one-hour guideline of 33 parts per million. By
the event's end, the level had increased to 262 parts per million.
   For a November 1988 event there, roof louvers were opened, the
time of the event was extended and one fewer pull was run. Still,
according to the CDC, carbon monoxide levels then went from 78
parts per million to 436.
   Adverse health effects have been reported in people breathing a
constant 15 parts per million, the CDC said.
   Mike Weber, a spokesman for TNT, one of the largest tractor-pull
promoters, said his group has ``never had any problems'' like those
at the Winnipeg arena.
   ``We present motor sports events in all the major arenas across
the country, and we take every precaution. We do constantly monitor
our emitted fumes ... it's worked very well for us,'' said Weber,
director of public relations for the United States Hot Rod
Association, sanctioning body for TNT events. TNT was not involved
in the Winnipeg pulls, he said.

   Opera star Beverly Sills, at a Catholic
fund-raiser, denounced violence and explicit sex in the arts. But
she added that ``you can't criminalize imagination.''
   ``We have laws today that tell us we can't smoke on airplanes,
but you can freely sing - if you'll pardon the expression - about
the joys of violating a woman's body in monstrous detail on
commercial recordings because it's a constitutional right,'' Sills
said.
   She addressed about 1,000 politicians and pundits Thursday night
at the 45th annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner. The
$500-a-plate affair dinner, run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of New York, benefits health care causes.
   ``We do not need self-appointed vigilantes to insist upon
legislating artistic work, because you can't legislate taste,'' Ms.
Sills said. ``You can't criminalize imagination. You shouldn't
throw artists in jail.''
   Instead, she said, higher moral standards are needed.
   ``Now I'm all for artistic freedom - I used to be a performing
artist myself - but we as a society are growing dangerously out of
touch with our conscience,'' she said.
   ``We don't need more laws to be enacted; we need to be outraged
and worried about our kids. We will not accept the lowest common
form of human behavior as the price for free expression.''
   Ms. Sills spoke at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel at what has been
called the city's most important non-political political event.
Among prominent guests were Mayor David Dinkins, former Mayor
Edward Koch and syndicated columnist William F. Buckley.
   Last year first lady Barbara Bush gave the keynote. In 1988,
George Bush and Michael Dukakis, then rival presidential
candidates, traded barbs. Other past speakers include John F.
Kennedy, Richard M. Nixon, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson
and Winston Churchill.
   Smith was governor of New York from 1923 to 1928, the year he
became the first Catholic to be nominated for president.
   Ms. Sills, 61, is a soprano who directed the New York City Opera
from 1979 to 1989 after retiring from the stage.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo did not attend the dinner. Cuomo is Catholic
and favors abortion rights, and he has been criticized by church
officials who say Catholic politicians should support the church's
anti-abortion stance.
   Cuomo's aide, Karen Polk, said he had made a prior commitment to
speak at a state school boards conference in Rochester.

<TEXT>
   Opponents of the U.S. military buildup
in the Middle East are resurrecting 1960s-style peace activism for
nationwide protests Saturday. Among the demonstrators will be labor
unions and veterans' groups.
   Rallies scheduled for at least 15 major U.S. cities will cap a
week of smaller protests and the debut of a televised peace message
starring Ron Kovic, the hero crippled in the Vietnam War who became
a staunch anti-war activist and wrote his story in ``Born on the
Fourth of July.''
   A wide-ranging coalition of groups is sponsoring the weekend
protests. Demonstrators staged a '60s-style teach-in rally at
Harvard University on Thursday and other protests elsewhere earlier
in the week.
   Organizers hope the mass protests will sap support for the
Persian Gulf military buildup arising after Iraq's conquest of
Kuwait in early August.
   ``Once people see thousands out in the street, we can build on
that,'' said Charles Twist, spokesman for the New York Coalition to
Stop U.S. Intervention in the Middle East.
   The 30-second TV spot starring Kovic debuted Thursday and was
set for broadcast in 50 U.S. cities. In it, Kovic says American
troops are risking their lives ``not to defend democracy, but to
protect the big oil companies.''
   Money for the TV message was raised from veterans and peace
groups. Kovic also is scheduled to address a rally in Los Angeles
on Saturday titled ``Stop the U.S. War for Oil - Bring Back Our
Sons and Daughters.''
   ``The government's doing a good job at a media blitz for the war
in the Middle East, but very little information is getting out
about how this crisis was created or what the underlying motives
are,'' said Eric Larsen, a Marine reserve noncommissioned officer
who says he will refuse to go to Saudi Arabia if called there.
   ``Once they have the facts, people will turn against this
policy,'' he said.
   At least one counter-demonstration was planned for Saturday by
Atlanta-area families of soldiers stationed in the Middle East.
   The cost of the U.S. troop deployment will figure prominently in
protesters' rhetoric, organizers said.
   ``The front pages are full of the budget crisis,'' Twist said.
``It doesn't take much to make the connection that we're spending
billions to keep our troops there at the same time we're cutting
Social Security.''
   That has helped draw labor unions to the movement.
   ``You've got inflation, budget cuts, joblessness and now the
war,'' said Nan Genger, a United Auto Workers official helping
stage a rally Saturday in Boston. ``Right now, working people are
under attack.''
   Veterans' groups also have joined the coalition.
   ``The days of U.S. veterans blindly supporting their government
are over since Vietnam,'' said Winston Warfield, president of the
400-member Smedley D. Butler Brigade of Veterans for Peace.
   Besides Los Angeles and Boston, rallies were planned in
Albuquerque, N.M., Birmingham, Ala., Chicago, Cleveland, Honolulu,
Houston, Minneapolis, New York, Olympia, Wash., Portland, Ore., San
Diego, San Francisco and Seattle.
   Demonstrations also are scheduled Saturday for cities in Canada,
Europe and Australia.
   Rallies were held on Tuesday in Honolulu, Washington, Houston,
Seattle and San Francisco in support of Jeffrey Paterson, a
22-year-old Marine corporal who refused to go to the Middle East
with his unit.

<HEAD>Police Official Says Secret Services Covered Up Jet Tragedy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's No. 1 police official says secret service
agents covered up evidence that would show a domestic airliner that
blew up over the Mediterranean ten years ago was shot down, news
reports said.
   The DC-9 jetliner, of now defunct Itavia airlines, was flying
from Bologna to Palermo, Sicily, on June 27, 1980, when it blew
apart. All 81 people aboard were killed.
   Italy at the time was wracked by terrorist attacks from both the
left and the right, and a bomb was first suspected. But
investigation over the years - especially after the retrieval of
the undersea wreckage seven years later - pointed to the
possibility of a missile.
   Vincenzo Parisi, chief of the national police force, told a
parliamentary committee Wednesday that he believes a missile shot
down the plane, newspapers reported.
   He was also quoted as saying that while elements in the Italian
secret services acted to cover up the downing, they weren't
involved in the missile-firing.
   He did not elaborate on the alleged cover-up. Investigators have
complained that the secret services were not fully cooperating in
the probe and that key radar tapes were missing.
   The head of the military branch of the secret services at the
time of the plane crash was a general who was later identified as a
member of Propanganda Due (P-2), a Masonic lodge that sought to
destabilize the Italian government.
   Parisi, who became assistant director of the civilian secret
service a few weeks after the plane went down, didn't identify the
nationality of the missile. However, he ruled out U.S. involvement,
the reports said.
   None of the past investigating commissions has identified the
nationality of the missile, if there were one, although Italy,
France, the United States and Libya have been named in media
reports as the chief possibilities.
   A Libyan connection was raised with the discovery, reported in
July 1980, of a Libyan MiG jetfighter which had crashed in southern
Italy. Some reports contended that U.S. fighter planes were chasing
a Libyan jet over the Mediterranean and fired a heat-seeking
missile that mistakenly hit the passenger aircraft.
   France was implicated in some reports because of the presence of
an aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean the evening of the
tragedy.
   French, U.S. and NATO officials have denied there was any
military activity in the skies that night.
   Parisi, in his testimony before the commission, discounted the
theory that the aircraft was accidentally hit by a missile.
   ``The case must be inserted in the national and international
terroristic panorama of the last 20 years,'' La Stampa, a national
daily, quoted him as saying.
   Parisi's testimony was the first by a high government official
to link the missile-firing theory to terrorism.
   The plane tragedy, known as the ``Ustica case'' from the name of
the tiny island near where the craft went down, has been one of the
more sensational unsolved cases among several Italian tragedies.
Parisi's account seemed to raise more questions than provide
answers.
   ``I can't give the origin nor the nationality'' of the missile,
another account, by Il Messaggero, quoted Parisi as saying. ``I
accuse no one because I haven't the elements to do so.''

   Elojia Macias may hear the beat of a
different drummer, but a judge says she must get in tune with the
rest of her church's flock.
   In a lawsuit, Father Alexander Wangler of Our Lady of Sorrows
Catholic Church accused Ms. Macias of disrupting church services by
singing her own songs, causing ``confusion and disruption.''
   At first she sang from her pew, the lawsuit said, but then she
got up and started singing through the sound system.
   Because of her actions, the church suffered a ``loss of good
will, spiritual tranquility and membership,'' the lawsuit said.
   State District Judge John Specia issued an injunction Thursday
ordering Ms. Macias to cooperate or risk being held in contempt of
court.
   Father Wangler said the first test should occur at Sunday's 9
a.m. Mass.

   A device that takes over the function of the
heart - pumping oxygenated blood throughout the body - could more
than double the number of people who survive sudden cardiac arrest,
researchers say.
   In its first human test, the pump kept blood flowing through one
woman for 15 hours until doctors got her heart working properly
again.
   ``Had they not gotten approval ... to use this machine, I can
question whether I'd be alive,'' said Sharon Wilczynski, 29, who
survived her heart attack although she was clinically dead several
times during the ordeal.
   ``What else could they have done?'' she asked.
   About 10 percent of people who suffer sudden heart attacks
survive. The pumping device could save an additional 10 percent to
15 percent, Dr. Samuel Tisherman of the University of Pittsburgh
Medical School said Thursday.
   ``This is just the beginning in new vistas in resuscitation,''
Tisherman said.
   The device adds oxygen and heats the blood outside the body
before pumping it back inside. It is called an emergency
closed-chest cardiopulmonary bypass. It is designed for use after
the failure of manual resuscitation methods, commonly known as CPR.
   ``If CPR doesn't work within a few minutes, we normally are
dealing with a hopeless situation,'' said Dr. Peter Safar, who
developed CPR and directs the university's International
Resuscitation Research Center.
   The equipment assembled by Pitt researchers is a smaller version
of heart-lung machines that sustain patients during open heart
surgery, Safar said. It consists of an oxygenator, oxygen tank,
pump, heat exchanger, battery pack and several feet of tubing.
   Two plastic tubes are inserted into a patient's femoral artery
and vein at the groin area. Blood flow is maintained so the brain
and other vital organs are not damaged while attempts are made to
restart and stabilize the heart.
   Although paramedics reached Miss Wilczynski within five minutes
of her attack on July 26 and administered CPR, her heart beat only
intermittently and stopped before she reached Presbyterian
University Hospital's emergency room.
   She was hooked to the bypass machine within 50 minutes.
   After two hours, her heart was beating but unstable, so doctors
let her sleep while the machine maintained blood flow. The next day
her rested heart stabilized.
   Tests indicate she suffered no brain damage.
   ``We went to my sister's recently and passed a funeral
procession,'' Miss Wilczynski said from her home in Coraopolis.
``It was an odd feeling, like `there but for the grace of God go
I.' ''

<HEAD>Sam Kinison's Bodyguard Testifies In Rape Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man hired to protect comedian Sam Kinison
testified he had sex with the comic's girlfriend as Kinison slept,
but said it wasn't rape.
   Unway Carter, 22, took the witness stand Thursday at his rape
trial. He said Kinison's girlfriend consented to have sexual
intercourse with him.
   The 6-foot-4, 300-pound Carter testified that Kinison's
22-year-old girlfriend told him afterward: ``We can't let Sam know
anything happened.''
   The woman testified Tuesday that Carter burst into her bedroom
and raped her repeatedly.
   The incident occurred June 21 after Carter, who said he had been
paid $100 to act as Kinison's bodyguard, helped the comic into bed.
Carter said Kinison was intoxicated.
   He said he heard the woman yelling at Kinison soon afterward
about alcohol and infidelity. Carter said he and the woman had sex
when he went to comfort her after the alleged fight.
   Carter faces five felony charges: three counts of rape and two
counts of sexual assault.
   Kinison, the former preacher known for his raunchy, loud comedy
diatribes, may not testify because he apparently was asleep and did
not realize what happened until authorities arrived.

<TEXT>
   A court has confirmed the ouster of
Benazir Bhutto's government, handing the former prime minister her
second legal setback in less than a week.
   Acting Chief Justice Saeeduzzaman Sadiqqi on Thursday also
upheld the dismissal of the Sindh provincial legislature controlled
by Ms. Bhutto's populist Pakistan People's Party.
   Ms. Bhutto is not expected to challenge either ruling, fearing
an appeal could delay the Oct. 24 parliamentary elections, a party
spokesman said on condition of anonymity.
   The Sindh High Court's decisions mirrored a ruling by the Lahore
High Court last week in Pakistan's prosperous Punjab Province, a
stronghold of Ms. Bhutto's political opponents.
   The Lahore court upheld her dismissal, ruling corruption and
mismanagement had paralyzed her government.
   Both rulings are expected to help Ms. Bhutto's political
opponents stem the momentum her party has gained in recent weeks.
   Three lawyers, all members of Ms. Bhutto's party, filed lawsuits
asking the court to rule her dismissal unconstitutional and to
restore her government and the provincial government.
   But Sadiqqi told the packed courtroom it was too late to put the
brakes on the election with less than a week to go.
   ``It is difficult to reverse the election process,'' the judge
said.
   Ms. Bhutto joined with two smaller liberal parties to form the
People's Democratic Alliance. Her key opponent is a coalition of
nine parties espousing ideologies ranging from right-wing to
religious fundamentalism.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed her government Aug. 6 and,
in a scathing critique of her 20 months in power, accused her of
corruption and power abuse that crippled the National Assembly, the
lawmaking lower house of Parliament.
   Kahn also criticized the 37-year-old former prime minister's
inability to stem the growing tide of violence in Sindh, her home
province, where at least 500 people had been killed since last May.
   Sadiqqi said the president was justified in his decision.
   Ms. Bhutto's party and a small Indian immigrant party have been
blamed for much of the violence.
   The Mohajir Qami Movement, or Refugee People's Party,
representing Indians who immigrated to Pakistan after partition of
the subcontinent, are bitter opponents of Sindhi nationalists, who
want greater autonomy or independence from Pakistan.

   The death toll in a mine explosion
in northern Moravia has climbed to 21, the state news agency CTK
reported today.
   Eight miners were reported still missing after rescue workers
recovered the bodies of 21 miners killed in an accident that CTK
said was probably caused by a leakage of methane.
   Ten miners were injured, and four of them remained hospitalized,
the agency said.
   CTK said the explosion occurred about 2,400 feet underground
Thursday.
   It was the second-worst mine accident in Czechoslovakia in the
last 10 years, CTK said. The worst accident occurred in September
1981 in Northern Bohemia, killing 65 people.

   The dollar recovered from overnight lows but was
still down against all major currencies except the yen in European
trading late this morning.
   Gold prices were higher, capping a technical rally that started
on Thursday, dealers said.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar's recovery was spurred
by remarks from an anonymous Bank of Japan official that a dollar
plunge should be avoided and that monetary officials must watch the
situation carefully.
   Dealers said the Japanese statement had put at least a temporary
floor under the dollar at 1.500 German marks and 126.00 yen.
However, they said the room for increases above those levels was
also limited.
   The dollar has been declining on expectations of a cut in the
U.S. federal funds interest rate, the protracted and unsuccessful
attempts to cut the U.S. budget and a belief by some traders that
the United States is on the verge of recession, dealers said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose against the yen for the first time in
44 trading days. It finished at 125.25 yen, up 0.85 yen. Later in
London, the dollar was quoted higher at 126.85 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   -1.5065 German marks, down from 1.5115
   -1.2710 Swiss francs, down from 1.2735
   -5.0473 French francs, down from 5.0630
   -1.6880 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7035
   -1,129.00 Italian lire, down from 1,132.75
   -1.1650 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1750
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9570, up from
$1.9540 late Thursday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$371.75 per ounce at midmorning, up from $367.75 bid per ounce late
Thursday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $371.75, up from $366.50 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $6 to close at a bid $375.58.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.24 a troy ounce,
from Thursday's $4.18.

<TEXT>
   Gubernatorial candidate Jon Grunseth
said a lie detector test shows he is innocent of allegations that
he swam nude with teen-age girls.
   Grunseth, an Independent-Republican, used the test results to
get a critical boost from his party Thursday. After his campaign
manager, Leon Oistad, discussed the results with party leaders, the
14-member IR executive committee gave Grunseth a vote of confidence
at its meeting in Bloomington.
   ``Jon was our candidate, and the lie detector test proved beyond
a doubt that the allegations were false and there was no reason he
should not be moving ahead with his campaign,'' IR Party Chairman
Bob Weinholzer said.
   Less than three weeks before the election, Grunseth wanted to
rebut allegations by two young women that he swam nude with four
teen-age girls at a 1981 party, tried to touch the breast of one
and served beer to minors.
   The Grunseth campaign refused to release details of the test
procedures, the questions asked and the identity of the test
administrator before a news conference today. Grunseth took the
test Wednesday night, campaign officials said.
   Oistad acknowledged that lie detector tests are not 100 percent
reliable, but he asked, ``How else does Jon prove a negative?''
   The women's attorney, Robert Tennessen of Minneapolis, did not
return a reporter's telephone call for comment. The women's
allegations have been corroborated by several other people at the
party, while Grunseth has obtained sworn statements from 16 people
who support his version.
   Grunseth faces Gov. Rudy Perpich, the Democratic-Farmer-Labor
Party nominee.

   The federal government wants more Americans to
get their vaccinations - not just kids, but grown-ups too.
   ``Despite the continuing occurrence of vaccine-preventable
diseases among adults in the United States, safe and effective
vaccines recommended for adults are not optimally used,'' the
Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   Examples cited by the CDC in its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly
Report:
   -While influenza vaccine is about 75 percent effective in
reducing deaths in high-risk older people, a 1987 survey found just
32 percent of adults over 65 had taken flu shots.
   -Five states had large college-based measles outbreaks in 1989;
only one had a pre-enrollment immunization requirement for
students.
   -Health care workers get between 6,000 and 8,000 new hepatitis B
infections each year. But in 1988, only 19 percent of U.S. and
Canadian medical schools required hepatitis B vaccinations.
   -Pneumococcal vaccine is more than 60 percent effective in
preventing invasive pneumococcal infections, which cause as much as
one-fourth of all pneumonia cases and 40,000 deaths a year. But a
1985 study concluded only 10 percent of high-risk people got the
shots.
   Between 1985-89, adults made up 92 percent of the nation's
tetanus patients, 87 percent of hepatitis B patients and 45 percent
of rubella patients; all are vaccine-preventable diseases, the CDC
said.
   The National Coalition for Adult Immunization, a coalition
including the American Medical Association, the American Lung
Association, CDC and other medical groups and drug companies, has
established a series of standards for adult immunizations. The
group recommends ``all health providers routinely determine the
immunization status of their adult patients'' and offer them the
shots they may need.
   If the standards are implemented, it ``could markedly improve
delivery of vaccines to adults'' by the year 2000, the CDC said.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of a Houston gallery fear
anti-Semitism may be behind the theft of three drawings depicting
scenes from the Holocaust and three other works by the same artist.
   Officials of Hooks-Epstein Galleries said Thursday more costly
works were ignored as six sketches by respected artist Jerome
Witkin, valued at $5,850, were removed early Wednesday.
   ``Was it just plain art theft, or was it anti-something art
theft?'' gallery owner Charles Hooks said. ``It's a puzzlement.
It's just maddening.''
   Hooks said the thief singled out renderings of the crematorium
floor at Auschwitz and the women's barracks and a latrine area in
the Birkenau concentration camp, then removed a nude and two
drawings of women from another wall.
   ``We think it was an anti-Semitic act,'' said Hooks' wife, Geri.
``This is the first show we have had here in 20 years that has any
religious significance.''
   ``Maybe they were trying to throw us off by taking the women,''
Mrs. Hooks said.
   Police report no progress in the burglary, which Hooks said
occurred about 4 a.m. when the glass front door was shattered.
Police responded to an alarm within minutes, but the burglar or
burglars had disappeared.
   The owners said they do not believe the thief felt rushed. The
slender brass rods that held the pictures were still in place and
nothing else in the gallery was disturbed.
   The three Holocaust sketches, hanging on a wall facing the
entrance, were carefully lifted from their places in a row of four
pictures.
   Hooks said the thief had to brazenly walk by a wall-size window
facing the street to remove the three other pictures.

<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With little apparent controversy, the city
health department has begun dispensing birth control pills and
condoms at seven middle and high schools.
   The clinics began distributing the contraceptives last month to
reduce the risk of pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases,
said Elias Dorsey, acting city health commissioner.
   Health clinics at selected schools have counseled sexually
active city students and prescribed contraceptives since 1985 as
part of a broad range of medical care offered to youngsters who
might not otherwise get it. Middle school begins with sixth grade.
   ``With kids 14 or 15 years old, you have to do it right now,''
Dorsey said.
   The distribution of condoms has become the subject of a major
policy debate this fall for school boards in Talbot County, Md.,
and New York, but the Baltimore school board did not consider the
issue because it was a health department matter, board president
Joseph L. Smith said.
   A survey of parents this spring found overwhelming support for
dispensing contraceptives at the clinics, said Dr. John Santelli,
the health department official who runs the program. Both he and
school officials said the policy change had not been controversial.
   Abstinence from sex is an option discussed with students at the
clinics and in health classes, Santelli said.
   About 5,000 students, around two-thirds of the total at the
seven selected schools, are enrolled in the clinics, Santelli said.
   Baltimore led the nation's big cities in the percentage of
babies born to teen-agers in 1988, the most recent year for which
figures are available, and teen-agers accounted for 30 percent of
the city's gonorrhea cases last year, according to the city's
health department.
   Parents must sign a consent form before their children are
enrolled in the clinics for most types of medical care, except
treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, alcoholism,
drug abuse, and dispersal of contraceptives.

   Here's one teacher who doesn't spend all

   Martha Krieger, a Huron High School teacher of family living and
home economics at Huron High School in this Detroit suburb, writes
steamy romances novel by night.
   The 54-year-old Taylor has written four historical romance
novels in the past five years, all under the pen name Allison
Knight.
   Her latest, published by Zebra Books, is ``Sea-Spun Ecstasy,''
set against the 1831 hurricane that devastated Barbados.
   Explains Krieger: ``I'm telling love stories in the way I think
others want to experience love.
   ``I'm writing what every woman, and man, would like to have in
their lives but nine out of 10 don't. It's a means of escape.''
   Krieger, who said she receives modest royalties, believes her
status as a novelist helps her communicate with students. It shows
them ``I'm not a stuffy old schoolteacher. I know what the world is

   Actor Robert Tessier, whose baleful looks
helped him portray tough guys and villains in such movies as ``The
Deep'' and ``The Longest Yard,'' has died. He was 56.
   Tessier died of cancer in Lowell, Mass., on Oct. 11, said a
longtime friend, Diane Haggert. He had returned to his hometown
after learning his illness was fatal, she said.
   Known for his trademark shaved head, Tessier's first prominent
role came in 1970 with ``Cry Blood, Apache.'' Other film credits
included ``Hooper'' and ``Hard Times.'' His last picture was
``Night-wish,'' released this year.
   He also worked in television, playing Rude Water in the
acclaimed miniseries ``Centennial.'' Other TV appearances included
``Charlie's Angels,'' ``Vegas'' and ``The Fall Guy.''
   Tessier earned the Silver Star and two Purple Hearts while
serving in the Korean War. He came to Los Angeles in the 1960s to
find work as an actor and was befriended by Lindsay Crosby, Dennis
Hopper and Dan Haggerty. His first roles were in low-budget
motorcycle pictures.
   Tessier is survived by two sons, three daughters, his mother and
two sisters.
   A memorial celebration was scheduled for Sunday at the Outlaws,
a club in the Los Angeles suburb of Playa del Rey.

<HEAD>Collective Presidency Accepts Croatian, Defers Debate on Nation's
Future</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with parliamentary debate postponed,
comment from Jovic, Mesic. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's Parliament today moved
to defuse mounting ethnic and political tension and warnings of
impending civil war by naming a Croatian reformer to the country's
collective presidency.
   A crucial parliamentary debate on whether Yugoslavia remains a
federation or becomes a looser alliance was then postponed until at
least November.
   The two moves indicated that the country's quarrelling political
leaders had decided to put off at least for now a showdown in their
power struggle over Yugoslavia's future.
   Deputies loudly applauded a conciliatory speech by outgoing
President Borisav Jovic, a Serb who holds the annually rotating
chairmanship of the collective ruling body.
   ``All bridges have not been burned. There are still
possibilities for the crisis to be overcome,'' Jovic said after the
Croatian Stjepan Mesic was named to the presidency.
   ``We are obliged not only to offer hope to the upset and
frightened citizens but, I believe strongly, we can justify the
trust they laid in us in these hard times,'' Jovic added.
   Communist-ruled Serbia staunchly opposes the confederacy plan
pushed by Slovenia and Croatia.
   Under it, Yugoslavia would become a loose alliance of sovereign
states. There would be no central rule or national capital, and
each state would decide how it would deal with each other on an
individual basis.
   Serbia calls for a ``modern federation'' that would keep central
rule in Belgrade, the capital of the country and Serbia.
   Deputies from Serbia - the largest republic and Croatia's
traditional rival - had earlier blocked the election of Stjepan
Mesic, charging he was a Croatian nationalist who seeks
independence for his republic.
   But those objections apparently were dropped following moves
within the eight-member presidency to ease tension.
   The presidency contains representatives from each of
Yugoslavia's six republics and two provinces. Croatia had
officially been without a representative in a dispute over Mesic's
nomination. He was proclaimed a member to the applause of hundreds
of deputies.
   In the growing split between the country's Communist and
non-Communist republics, Croatia on Thursday ordered its militia
reserves to mobilize.
   The order was reported by the republic's television on Thursday
and rebroadcast by Serbian television in Belgrade. It said only
that Croatia was conducting a ``routine check'' of reserve units.
   The national news agency Tanjug said it had learned that arms
had been distributed to some reserve forces.
   Leading Yugoslav politicians warned hours before the
mobilization that ethnic and political struggles could lead to
civil war.
   Croatian President Franjo Tudjman said ``if necessary, the
entire Croatian people at home and abroad will fight to protect the
democracy it won.''
   Croatia would not tolerate any ``solutions that have proved
fatal for the economic and democratic development,'' he said.
   Croatia and Slovenia elected center-right governments this year
and are seeking greater independence. Belgrade is in Serbia, which
is still controlled by Communists.
   In recent months, members of the Serbian minority in Croatia
have staged demonstrations and seized arms from police, and Serbia
has talked of absorbing areas of Croatia where there are large
numbers of Serbs.
   Slovenia's delegate in the collective presidency, Janez
Drnovsek, said that Serbia's Communist leaders were ``forcing the
federal concept that could only lead to the breakup of the
country.''
   But, he added: ``At this moment it would be extremely risky to
stop a dialogue between republics that would lead to the final
breakup.''

<HEAD>Thatcher Suffers Stunning Defeat in Election For Seat of Slain
Legislator</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EASTBOURNE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a stunning defeat for Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, the centrist Liberal Democratic Party
today won this Conservative Party stronghold in a special
parliamentary election.
   The Liberal Democrats took Eastbourne, a prosperous south
England coastal town, in a huge 20.5 percent swing against the
government. Balloting was to replace a legislator slain by the IRA.
   The Tory trouncing was among the worst electoral setbacks
suffered by Mrs. Thatcher since she came to power in 1979. It
prompted speculation she might feel forced to shelve any plan to
call a general election next year, a year before her third
five-year term expires.
   Still, the result had scant impact on Mrs. Thatcher's control of
the 650-member House of Commons, where the Conservatives have 373
seats, Labor 226 and the Liberal Democrats now have 20.
   The rest are split among minority regional parties.
   The victory by Liberal Democrat David Bellotti, 47, appeared in
part a backlash to the Tory campaign theme that a vote for the
opposition would be ``a moral victory for terrorism.''
   It marked a revolt against government economic policies of
trying to squeeze 10.9 percent inflation with nearly two years of
high interest rates and an unpopular new local tax imposed in the
spring. Critics also pointed to what they have said is
under-funding of the health, education and welfare services.
   ``It is a very poor result for us; there are no bones about
it,'' Conservative Party chairman Kenneth Baker acknowledged when
the result of Thursday's ballot was declared early today.
   Bellotti, scooping 51 percent of the vote, overturned a near
17,000-vote Conservative majority in Eastbourne to in by a
comfortable 4,550-vote margin.
   The Conservatives' Richard Hickmet went down with 18,865 votes.
   The vote for the socialist Labor Party, with a yearlong lead in
national opinion polls but no hope in Eastbourne, collapsed to just
2,308, or 5 percent.
   Eastbourne had been Tory territory for more than 70 years and
ranked among the dozen safest Conservative Party seats in the
country.
   ``This is a fine result for us and a disastrous one for the
Conservative Party,'' said Bellotti, 47, a local authority
counselor and director of the Young Men's Christian Association.
   Ian Gow, the previous legislator and a close aide to Mrs.
Thatcher, was killed July 30 when the outlawed Irish Republican
Army blew up his car. He was an outspoken opponent of the IRA's
violent campaign against British rule in Northern Ireland.
   The slaying of Gow, among the most audacious attacks in IRA
violence this year, stunned this sedate, 18th-century resort
community.
   Liberal Democratic leaders hailed the victory as restoring the
party's fortunes after internal feuds slashed the centrists'
support to single figures in poll ratings, compared with a
one-fifth share in the 1987 general election.
   Labor leader Neil Kinnock said Eastbourne ``shows that people
will vote against the Tories any time, any where.''
   But observers said a modest revival of the centrists, who helped
Mrs. Thatcher to victory in the past two elections by splitting the
left-of-center vote, could benefit her again.
   Eastbourne epitomizes south England Tory territory - negligible
unemployment, a high proportion of retirees and an abundance of
small businessmen, and voters strong on law and order.

   A coal mine that has been burning for
more than two days, driving about 50 people from their homes, will
be sealed in an attempt to extinguish the smoky blaze, a spokesman
said this morning.
   The decision to seal the mine's seven openings was made after
engineers drilled tubes 100 yards into the earth and concluded the
fire had spread farther than they thought and had grown in
intensity, said Robert Toothman, spokesman for National Steel Corp.
   The steel company owns the Mathies Coal Co. mine near this
western Pennsylvania town.
   The fire spewed thick smoke and invisible carbon monoxide.
Fifteen to 20 families living within a mile of the mine's
northernmost portal were ordered out of their homes Wednesday
evening because of the fumes, said Washington County emergency
services spokesman Philip Garrow. Most of them went to stay with
relatives or friends.
   It could take several days before the mine is sealed and the
evacuation order is lifted, and then several months before the fire
is completely smothered, Toothman said.
   ``We're going to try to cut off all the air,'' he said.
   The fire began early Wednesday at the mine southwest of
Pittsburgh near the juncture of two interstate highways.
   The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette quoted unidentified Mathies miners
as saying the main fire was sparked by a high-voltage line that
collapsed in a primary tunnel. Toothman said he was unable to
confirm those reports.
   Dark smoke filled the valley near the portal, but authorities
were more worried about the amount of invisible, odorless, toxic
carbon monoxide in the atmosphere, Garrow said.
   ``As long as the fire is burning, you'll get carbon monoxide,''
he said.
   A separate fire in the mine's maintenance shop was contained by
cutting off air to the area, Toothman said. The blast that started
that fire Wednesday slightly injured 11 firefighters.

   For the New York Philharmonic, it was supposed
to be a night of Beethoven and Shostakovich. The fates made it a
night of Leonard Bernstein.
   The official catalog of his works says Bernstein led 74
orchestras. But this was HIS orchestra, and the musicians came to
pay tribute to THEIR laureate conductor, who led them through 1,244
concerts during his 47-year association with the Philharmonic.
   They let his music do the talking.
   ``Tonight's concert is not an evening in which we want to dwell
on the passing of a giant, but rather what he has left us,'' guest
conductor Leonard Slatkin told the audience at Avery Fisher Hall on
Thursday night.
   So four nights after Bernstein's death at age 72, Beethoven's
``Violin Concerto'' became Bernstein's ``Serenade for Solo Violin,
String Orchestra, Harp and Percussion'' (1954); Shostakovich's
``Symphony No. 4'' became Bernstein's ``Symphony No. 1
(Jeremiah),'' written in 1942.
   Also added were his ``Chichester Psalms'' (1965) and his
overture to ``Candide'' (1956). The substitute Bernstein program
was being repeated Friday night, Saturday and Tuesday.
   It was an extraordinary concert.
   There weren't many smiling faces among the audience or
musicians. Slatkin's brief introductory comments, followed by the
whimsical ``Candide,'' broke some of the tension.
   Then came the eclectic ``Serenade,'' which Bernstein's program
notes says is supposed to be based on Plato's ``Symposium.'' It
begins with a lyrical praise of the Eros, the god of love. The
piece is sometimes jocular, sometimes melancholy, sometimes
assaulting and sometimes hedonistic. It ends in drunken revelry, an
intrusion of jazz - as if Bernstein was looking down from heaven
and telling the audience, ``It's O.K. to smile tonight.''
   The soloist - concertmaster Glenn Dicterow - played with much
agility, especially through the difficult double stops and
especially considering the lack of preparation time.
   The mourning returned after intermission, but not without
optimism.
   ``Jeremiah'' begins with suspenseful strings, followed by a
cantorial French horn, a melodic return to the strings and then a
prophetic blaring of brass. The second movement continues the
point-counterpoint of brass versus strings (Jeremiah versus the
corrupt priests, with Nebuchadnezzar looming on the horizon). In
the third movement, Jerusalem has fallen to the Babylonian king.
Judea is exiled. Jeremiah weeps.
   ``How she sits desolate -
   ``The city once so full of people -
   ``She is become as a widow.''
   During her chanting of the prophet's ``Lamentations,''
mezzo-soprano Wendy White had to wipe a tear from her eye. S did
members of the audience.
   Last on the program was another Hebraic elegy, ``Chichester
Psalms.'' The New York Choral Artists and a boy soloist joined the
orchestra.
   Two harpists dominated the center of the crowded stage.
   ``Awake, psaltery and harp!'' the choir begins in Hebrew.
   ``I will rouse the dawn.''
   In the second movement an angelic 8th-grader, Evan Weber, sings
King David's 23rd Psalm, ``The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not
want.''
   After he finishes, the men's chorus bellows: ``Why do the
nations rage?''
   The piece, however, ends in a Mahlerian motif and chorus
declaring a message Bernstein had sought for society:
   ``Behold how good,
   ``And how pleasant it is,
   ``For brethren to dwell
   ``Together in unity.''
   To emphasize the point after the final note, Slatkin suspended
his hands for several long moments of silence. Then came the
cascade of applause. For Leonard Bernstein.

<HEAD>U.S., British Hostages Reported Moved to Eastern Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FAROUK NASSAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American and British hostages held by
pro-Iranian extremists have been moved from Beirut's southern slums
to eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, Lebanese military intelligence
sources said today.
   The hostages were moved last week, before Saturday's attack by
government troops and the Syrian army that crushed Gen. Michel
Aoun's rebellion in the Christian heartland northeast of Beirut,
the sources said.
   ``We have accurate information the captors whisked the captives
out from south Beirut a few days before the attack,'' one source
said.
   ``The Syrians are certainly aware of the transer. They control
all roads from Beirut to the Bekaa. But we do not know whether they
had any role in it,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Another army intelligence source, who also spoke on condition he
not be named, confirmed that the hostages were moved to the Bekaa.
   ``But we don't know whether they were tipped off about the
attack and asked to make the transfer, or they took the move for
other considerations that we are not aware of,'' he said.
   The tank-led attack on Aoun was mounted from three directions,
one of which was the densely populated Shiite Moslem southern
slums, a major power base of the Iranian-backed fundamentalist
Hezbollah.
   Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be the umbrella of
Shiite extremists holding most of the Western hostages in Lebanon.
   The Western hostages are six Americans, four Britons, two West
Germans and an Italian. The longest held is Terry A. Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   Both intelligence sources said the hostages spirited to the
Bekaa were the six Americans and two of the Britons: Anglican
church envoy Terry Waite and journalist John McCarthy.
   ``We believe they are now held in Sheik Abdulla barracks in
Baalbek and in the nearby village of Nabi Sheet,'' one source said.
``But we do not know who, or how many, are held in either place.''
   Sheik Abdulla barracks, a former Lebanese army garrison, is the
command post of about 3,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards who were
stationed in the Bekaa after Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon.
   Nabi Sheet is a Hezbollah base 12 miles southeast of Baalbek,
which is about 40 miles east of the Lebanese capital.
   The Syrians, who maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
Arab League peacekeeping mandate, have often skirmished with
Hezbollah militiamen in Beirut and the Bekaa but have carefully
avoided confrontation with the Iranian guards.
   Syria was the only active Arab ally of Iran during its
eight-year war with Iraq. Syria and Iraq are governed by rival
wings of the Arab Socialist Baath Party. The Syrians were
instrumental in arranging the release of two American hostages and
two Swiss captives of the Red Cross this year.

   Intense storms that sped across the Eastern Seaboard spun off
tornadoes that killed one person in Virginia and destroyed homes
and injured at least 50 people in Baltimore suburbs.
   Thursday's storms poured rain into the halls of Congress in
Washington, D.C., and left tens of thousands of people without
electricity from Virginia to the New York City area.
   The storm system, although strong, passed quickly through most
areas, and today's forecast called for generally fair weather and
reduced winds.
   Some homes in Baltimore's suburbs were condemned early today
after a tornado ripped through the area, tearing off roofs and
tossing uprooted trees through the air.
   ``I didn't hear nothing until the roof was on top of me. All of
a sudden, the whole roof caved in,'' said Alverta Payne, 80. She
escaped her home in Reisterstown, Md., by crawling through the
wreckage of her third floor.
   In Virginia, the storm system produced two tornadoes, the
weather service said. One took the life of a farmer and left a
trail of damage across the state.
   Russell Martin, 73, was crushed to death when the old wooden
barn in which he took cover was shattered by a tornado early
Thursday night, King William County Sheriff W. Wayne Healy said.
   The storm front dropped six inches of rain in Albemarle County
before it headed to sea.
   Storms hit Washington, D.C., with 60 mph winds that knocked down
trees. Heavy rain poured through the west side of the Capitol dome
and into the Rotunda, forcing workers to cover a half-dozen statues
with plastic sheeting.
   Utility companies said as many as 80,000 customers lost power in
the District of Columbia and neighboring Virginia.
   Another 80,000 homes in Baltimore lost power as winds of 75 mph
or more blew down utility lines, and power was also out in 2,000
homes in parts of Delaware. Four schools were closed in northern
Delaware and four elementary schools were closed in Baltimore
County this morning.
   Fifty to 70 people were believed hurt in Baltimore, authorities
said, but most of the injuries appeared to be minor.
   In Reston, Va., residents of the Southgate condominium complex
said winds toppled trees and ripped holes in the roofs of several
homes.
   ``We've got trees uprooted, trees down, limbs all over the
place. Parts of roofs are missing,'' said Tish Hidebrand, who works
at the condominium complex.
   Strong winds from a severe thunderstorm buffeted Newark
International Airport in New Jersey and damaged some homes in the
state. Air traffic was not disrupted and the only reported injuries
were five people hurt when winds overturned a storage trailer near
a taxi area, the officer said.
   In Montgomery Township, N.J., high winds damaged seven homes and
sent eight people to the hospital with non-life-threatening
injuries.
   Montgomery police Lt. Kenneth Chrusz said one home was ``reduced
to kindling'' and another was ``virtually torn in half'' by the
high winds.
   In counties surrounding New York City, more than 90,000
customers temporarily lost electricity, utility officials said.
   In Rhode Island, thunderstorm winds flattened a hotel in a
resort area, but no injuries were reported. The 10-room Paddy's
Motel along Westerly's Misquamicut Beach was closed for the
off-season when the storm hit. A few weeks earlier and the motel
would have been crowded, a fire official said.
   Utility officials said about 1,700 customers, most in the
southwest part of the state, were without power early today.

   Hurricane Nana moved northwest over the open
Atlantic toward Bermuda early today, with top winds of 75 mph,
forecasters said.
   A hurricane warning for the island was expected to be posted
later today, according to the National Hurricane Center in suburban
Coral Gables.
   At 9 a.m. EDT, Nana was centered about 275 miles south southwest
of Bermuda.
   The eighth hurricane of the Atlantic hurricane season was headed
northwest at near 10 mph and a turn to the north was expected later
today, according to Robert Case, a hurricane specialist at the
center.
   ``It appears as though the center (of the hurricane) is going to
come pretty close to the island in the next 24 to 36 hours,'' Case
said. ``But because it's such a small hurricane, it could pass by
the island entirely.''
   Hurricane force winds extended only 25 miles to the east of
Nana's center, Case said. He said early today that there was only a
30 percent chance Nana's center would pass within 65 miles of
Bermuda when it reaches the area early Saturday.
   The system formed Tuesday off Puerto Rico as a tropical
depression, and achieved hurricane strength Thursday.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 through Nov. 30.

   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato took to the Senate floor
this week, scolding his colleagues for spending beyond their means.
   ``What about some fiscal discipline? What about a freeze?'' the
New York Republican demanded. ``What about maybe a cut? What about
eliminating some programs?''
   Hours later, D'Amato's press secretary was on the phone giving
reporters what has become the senator's nightly pork report - i.e.,
a list of millions of dollars for New York projects won by
D'Amato's legendary tenacity on the Appropriations Committee.
   D'Amato had taken credit for a $17 million appropriation to help
build a road bypassing the town of Corning; $100 million over six
years to help clean up two polluted lakes and the Long Island
Sound; $11 million to build a second railroad track between the tip
of Manhattan and Penn Station; and $1.45 million to buy land for a
veterans' cemetery somewhere around Albany.
   Is Congress trying to cut spending or bring home the bacon?
   The answer is, both.
   On the floors of the House and Senate, Congress has been
debating proposals to reduce thebudget deficit by $500 billion
over the next five years. Meanwhile, conference committees have
been meeting to craft appropriations bills that will spend the
government's money.
   The timing could hardly look worse.
   Just this week, one of the 13 Senate appropriations
subcommittees received a wish list of 2,800 special projects from
various senators, said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.
   ``Those same senators then come in here with unctuous,
pontificating statements about how, if we could just freeze this or
that, we could get the deficit under control,'' Bumpers said on the
Senate floor Wednesday.
   And with elections less than a month away, members need to look
fiscally tough at the same time as they're taking credit for this
bridge or that veterans' hospital.
   Take Rep. Doug Barnard Jr., a Georgia Democrat locked in a tense
re-election race. On Tuesday, Barnard issued a press release saying
he had voted against the House budget package because it would have
increased taxes by $149 billion over five years.
   ``If the rest of the Congress had followed my lead and voted for
across-the-board cuts and freezes to spending bills all year, we
wouldn't be faced with trying to find massive cuts here at the 11th
hour,'' he said.
   The next day, Barnard issued another release bragging that Fort
Gordon - in his district - will get $10.6 million from federal
coffers for a ``soldier support center'' that would consolidate all
administrative offices.
   The Army originally requested the money for fiscal 1992, Barnard
noted, but he petitioned the House Appropriations Committee to fund
the center a year sooner.
   ``Everybody wants to reduce the deficit but nobody wants to
contribute to the reduction,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole said
earlier this week.
   Yet, the Kansas Republican recently took credit for helping win
$28 million for military projects back home, as well as $1 million
to relocate a soup kitchen.
   Of course, only the politically naive would expect a senator or
congressman to give up money for a pet project, right?
   Well, maybe not.
   Last week, Rep. Carl Pursell, R-Mich., walked into the energy
and water development appropriations conference and asked that $3
million to clean up the Rouge River near Detroit be stricken from
the bill, the money returned to the Treasury.
   ``As far as I know, it was an unprecedented move - removing a
project from a bill,'' Purcell said afterward on the House floor.
``If each member of this body followed suit, and would give up any
of their projects, the numbers would begin to become significant.''

   Governing party officials postponed a planned
mission to Washington today after a U.S. congressional committee
decided not to demand the resignation of a Japanese Cabinet
minister for his remarks about American blacks.
   The U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee voted Thursday to
condemn Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama's remarks, but amended
its resolution at the last minute to remove a call for his
resignation.
   Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party immediately postponed
the trip by a delegation of lawmakers, who had planned to try to
soothe the anger of members of Congress over the remarks.
   On Sept. 21, after a police roundup of foreign prostitutes in a
red-light district in Tokyo, Kajiyama compared the arrival of the
prostitutes to blacks moving into neighborhoods in the United
States and forcing whites out.
   His remarks were immediately condemned in the United States, and
Kajiyama retracted the comments four days later and apologized.
   ``Now that the resolution has been modified, it may be better to
find a more appropriate time to consult with (members of Congress)
rather than go there hastily,'' Ichiro Ozawa, secretary general of
the governing party, told reporters today.
   Kyodo News Service reported that Kajiyama expressed relief when
he learned that the resolution did not include a call for his
resignation.
   ``I am aware of the passage of the bill, but I can't comment on
it because I have not heard about the details,'' Kyodo quoted him
as saying.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said it was
``regrettable'' that the resolution was approved. When asked to
assess the affect the remarks had on bilateral relations, he
acknowledged that ``it is a serious incident.''
   Watanabe urged Americans not to conclude that Japanese are
racists. ``It is wrong to assume that all the Japanese are sharing
that view represented in the statement made by Mr. Kajiyama,'' he
said.
   Meanwhile, opposition party leaders attacked Kajiyama and
demanded that Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu dismiss him, but Kaifu
said he had no intention of doing so.
   Kaifu has repeatedly called the remarks ``inappropriate'' and
rebuked Kajiyama, but protests continued to grow both inside and
outside of Japan.
   In the United States, the Congressional Black Caucus prepared a
resolution demanding Kajiyama's resignation, and some black groups
called for a boycott of Japanese products.
   In hopes of stopping the passage of the resolution, the justice
minister sent a letter of apology Wednesday to Rep. Ronald Dellums,
who chairs the 24-member caucus, but the group refused to withdraw
the resolution.
   Kajiyama is the latest of a series of Japanese politicians who
offended minorities with public racial remarks.
   In 1986, then Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said Americans
have a lower intelligence level than Japanese because the
population includes a considerable number of blacks, Puerto Ricans
and Mexicans.
   In 1988, former Finance Minister Michio Watanabe said American
blacks have few qualms about going bankrupt and implied that they
walk away from debts.

<HEAD>Infant Goes Home After `Miraculous' Recovery from Heart Defects</HEAD>

   A nearly 3-month-old baby was released
from the hospital after recovering from serious heart defects that
once made him a transplant candidate.
   Weston Kilpatrick left Loma Linda University Medical Center in
good condition Wednesday, but still faces the prospect of future
surgery to repair remaining defects, hospital spokesman Dick
Schaefer said.
   ``We're very excited and cautiously optimistic as we take Weston
home,'' said his father, Layne Kilpatrick, a 31-year-old
pharmacist. ``He's doing well. Although the future is uncertain for
Weston, he has amazed us.''
   ``Everyone's really excited that Weston can get home in this
sort of shape without a transplant,'' said Dr. Steven Gundry, who
performed surgery to repair some of the defects that didn't heal.
   Weston was born July 27. He suffered several congenital cardiac
defects, including underdevelopment of the left side of his heart,
underdeveloped heart valves, an open duct between two arteries and
a narrowed aorta, which is the main artery carrying blood from the
heart to the rest of the body.
   Layne and Janet Kilpatrick and their 4-year-old daughter,
Danielle, moved from the central California community of Lompoc to
Redlands in order to be near their son while he waited for a donor
heart.
   Gundry repaired the duct and artery problem Oct. 7 after the
usually fatal underdevelopment of the heart's left pumping chamber
got better on its own. The valves also showed some improvement.
That recovery, which doctors called virtually miraculous,
eliminated the need for a heart transplant to save Weston's life.
   ``Weston has continued to improve,'' Gundry said Wednesday. ``He
still has problems with one of the valves in his heart and a few
small holes in his heart. But right now he's really amazed all of
us.''
   Schaefer said the holes allow a small amount of blood to flow
between chambers of the heart in an unwanted manner and may require
corrective surgery later.
   Loma Linda has become a leading center for newborn human heart
transplants since 1984, when Dr. Leonard Bailey implanted a
baboon's heart in the infant known as Baby Fae in an attempt to
save her life. She suffered a more severe underdevelopment of the
left side of her heart.

<HEAD>Gambino Sons, Others Arrested on Extortion Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two sons of the late crime boss Carlo Gambino
were arrested on charges of monopolizing trucking in the city's
garment district with threats, extortion and violence.
   State indictments accuse Thomas and Joseph Gambino, along with
five other trucking executives, of dividing the district into
zones, each run by a specific mob-controlled trucking company that
agreed not to compete in another's territory.
   With competition eliminated, mob truckers could charge
extortionate rates and extract millions of dollars more in profits
than a legitimate trucking concern would have earned, District
Attorney Robert Morgenthau said Thursday.
   That caused ``a `mob tax' on every garment shipped in New York
City, which is ultimately passed along to the consumer,''
Morgenthau said.
   If a garment shipper used an independent trucker, Morgenthau
said, the mob truckers would make the shipper pay them anyway.
   The suspects used their reputations as gangland figures to scare
dozens of manufacturers and contractors into cooperating, he said.
   During the two-year investigation, undercover police ran a dress
shop, Morgenthau said. The officers also ran a small trucking
company.
   One indictment charges Thomas Gambino, 61; brother Joseph, 54;
and their employees John DiSalvo, 39, and Raymond Buccafusco, 61,
with enterprise corruption and 52 other counts of larceny by
extortion, coercion and restraint of trade.
   Thomas Gambino was the head of the criminal enterprise while his
brother and DiSalvo were his principal operating officers,
Morgenthau said.
   The millionaire Gambino brothers are sons of the late ``boss of
all bosses,'' Carlo Gambino, who ran the gang that bears his name
and is now allegedly controlled by John Gotti.
   If convicted, they face up to 25 years in prison and loss of
their trucking companies. The companies, also charged in the
indictment, are Consolidated Carriers, Clothing Carriers,
Greenberg's Express, and GRG Delivery Corp.
   Named in a second indictment on charges similar to those in the
first are Michael Vuolo, 55; David Stuart, 49, of Hollywood, Fla.;
Stuart's son, Mark, 27; and six companies they own.
   At arraignment in Manhattan's state Supreme Court, the city's
trial-level court, Acting Justice Herbert Altman set bond ranging
from $50,000 for Buccafusco and Mark Stuart to $1 million for
Thomas Gambino. The defendants later posted bond and were released.

   Black plumes rising five miles above
Neptune's moon Triton may be swirling funnels called ``dust
devils'' instead of volcano-like geysers as many researchers
believe, a study published today says.
   ``The majority theory is still that they're geysers. But we're
having a lively debate,'' said planetary scientist Andrew Ingersoll
of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
   At least four plumes were discovered in photographs taken by the
Voyager 2 space probe when it zoomed past Neptune and Triton in
August 1989. The plumes of nitrogen ice, nitrogen gas and carbon
dust rise five miles high, then flatten into clouds that drift 90
miles downwind.
   Because they are so tall, ``a lay person would call them
volcanoes. But the proper technical term is geysers - if that's
what they are,'' said Edward Stone, Voyager's chief scientist and
director-designate of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, Ingersoll and
Caltech graduate student Kimberly Tryka argue the plumes are
five-mile-tall dust devils, similar to those on Mars and on Earth's
windy deserts.
   ``A dust devil forms when the floor of the desert gets much
hotter than the air right above it,'' Ingersoll said Thursday.
   ``The air near the ground is very buoyant and just rises. If
there's a little breeze blowing, it can get spinning. You get this
narrow column that extends up to 2,000 feet. On Mars, they extend
up 3{ miles.''
   Ingersoll said he thinks the plumes are dust devils because they
remain narrow as they rise off bare spots on Triton's icy surface.
Volcanoes and geysers usually form umbrella-shaped plumes, he said.
   A study by Laurence Soderblom and Randolph Kirk of the U.S.
Geological Survey in Flagstaff, Ariz., and Robert H. Brown of Jet
Propulsion Laboratory says nitrogen and methane ices that cover
much of Triton's surface act like a greenhouse, trapping heat from
the sun.
   They say the heat vaporizes underground ice, which then erupts
through overlying ice to form geysers.
   The debate is important for ``understanding the solar system in
which we live,'' said Roger Yelle, a planetary scientist and geyser
advocate at the University of Arizona, Tucson.
   Ingersoll said the main problem with the dust-devil theory is
that Triton's atmosphere is so thin wind shouldn't be able to whip
up dust and nitrogen ice. For dust devils to form, Triton's dust
and ice would have to be 1,000 to 10,000 times less ``sticky'' than
similar materials on Earth, Ingersoll said.
   The flight past Neptune and Triton capped an $865 million
exploration of four planets and more than 50 moons by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Voyager 1 and 2 space
probes.
   The twin craft were launched in 1977. Both visited Jupiter and
Saturn. Voyager 2 went on to Uranus and Neptune. The Voyagers now
are zipping toward the edge of the solar system.
   Neptune is usually the eighth planet from the sun. But because
of Pluto's elongated orbit, Neptune now is temporarily the ninth
and outermost planet.

   A judge today cleared a company and seven of its
former employees of manslaughter charges in the sinking of a ferry
off Belgium three years ago that left 193 people dead.
   The justice, Sir Michael John Turner, told the jury on the 27th
day of the trial to find P and O European Ferries (Dover) Ltd.,
three former directors and two seamen not guilty.
   He said the prosecution had failed to legally prove
manslaughter.
   Turner also ordered the jury to acquit two other seamen when the
prosecution said it would drop its case against them.
   Relatives of the victims fought for more than three years to
bring what is believed only the second charge of corporate
manslaughter against a company. In the first case, a construction
company was acquitted in 1965.
   The judge told the jury that ``evidence already called is such
that you, properly directed, could not properly convict the company
and the five most senior defendants.''
   All defendants had denied a single charge of manslaughter. Only
one person who died in the sinking of the Herald of Free Enterprise
ferry was named in a test case to simplify the charges.
   They were the ferry company, chief marine superintendent Jeffrey
Develin, deputy chief marine superintendent John Alcindor,
technical director Wallace Ayres, senior master John Kirby, master
of the Herald David Lewry, chief officer Leslie Sabel, and
assistant boatswain Mark Stanley.
   The prosecution dropped its case against Sael and Stanley.
   They had been accused of unlawfully killing Alison Gaillard, 27,
a passenger aboard the Herald of Free Enterprise when it capsized
outside Belgium's Zeebrugge harbor on March 6, 1987.
   The ferry set sail with her bow doors open. The man responsible
for closing them, Stanley, had been asleep in his cabin, and Sabel,
the officer responsible for ensuring they were closed, admitted he
had not fulfilled his duty.
   The charges alleged there was an obvious and serious risk that
because of the failure by the defendants to do their duties the
Herald would sail with open doors, capsize and cause death. The
defendents allegedly either gave no thought to the risk, or if they
recognized it, still took it.
   But the judge said there was no direct evidence that a
reasonably prudent person occupying the position of any of the five
senior defendents would have perceived that the risk was obvious or
serious.
   Victims' families were ``very disappointed and saddened'' by the
outcome, said Maurice de Rohan, chairman of the Herald Families
Association and the father of Mrs. Gaillard, the one victim named
in the manslaughter charge.
   The company, which was covered by insurers, has settled
piecemeal most claims by survivors and relatives.

   Mayor Marion Barry today withdrew his request
for a new trial on a misdemeanor cocaine possession.
   ``I have spoken with my client, and he has decided to withdraw
that motion for a mistrial,'' defense lawyer L. Kenneth Mundy told
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson during a
pre-sentencing hearing.
   Barry, scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 26, faces up to a year in
prison and a maximum fine of $100,000. He did not attend today's
court session.
   Law enforcement officials had said U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens
might consider retrying the mayor on a dozen charges the jury could
not resolve if Barry pushed ahead with his request for another
trial. Stephens had said earlier that he would not conduct another
trial.
   Mundy said today that the decision to withdraw the request was
reached before the government filed papers opposing the motion.
   On Thursday, Mundy had asked that the sentencing be delayed
because he hadn't had enough time to respond to a pre-sentencing
report prepared by the mayor's parole officer.
   ``We disagree wholeheartedly with the pre-sentencing report,''
Mundy said.
   The report was not released in open court, but Mundy said his
chief objection was its apparent conclusion that Barry has neither
shown remorse nor taken responsibility for his actions by admitting
to prior drug use.
   ``There is an ongoing probe of Mr. Barry, and some of the
questions being asked (of witnesses) involve drug use by Mr.
Barry,'' Mundy said. ``It would have been very perilous for him to
make any pre-sentencing statement to the parole officer until we
know that there will be no other trial.''
   The judge denied the request to delay sentencing.
   According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts, the report
said Barry ``affirmatively denied'' using drugs.
   If a defendant admits guilt in a pre-sentencing report, he often
is given a lighter sentence than if he denies culpability.
   In his motion for retrial, Mundy had argued that Barry should
receive a new trial because some of the jurors witnessed a drug
sting at the hotel where they were sequestered.
   A jury convicted Barry on Aug. 10 of one misdemeanor cocaine
possession count, acquitted him of another and deadlocked on a
dozen other counts, including a charge resulting from his Jan. 18
arrest in an FBI sting operation at a downtown Washington hotel.
   Barry chose not to seek a fourth mayoral term next month, but is
running for the city council.

   A female jail guard and an escaped male
inmate were arrested at a motel in Canada a day after their
disappearance was featured on a television show, authorities said.
   Edgar Eugene Kerns, who escaped from the Allegany County Jail on
Aug. 29, and guard Sandra Kay Beeman were arrested Thursday after a
viewer of NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' contacted authorities, the
Allegany County Sheriff's Department said.
   Royal Canadian Mounted Police also arrested another high-profile
prison escapee this week as a result of a television show.
   Lawrencia ``Bambi'' Bembenek was captured Wednesday in the
tourist city of Thunder Bay, Ontario, after a tip came from someone
who had seen her case described on ``America's Most Wanted.'' The
one-time police officer and former model fled to Canada with her
fiance after escaping from a Wisconsin prison three months ago.
   In the Maryland case, the sheriff's department alleges that
Beeman let Kerns and another inmate escape. The other inmate, James
Vernon Barnes, 35, of Romney, W.Va., was captured in Hampshire
County, W.Va., four days after the jail break.
   Kerns, 29, and Beeman, 46, of Frostburg, spent several weeks at
a motel in Hamilton, Ontario. They moved several miles away to
another motel Wednesday night and were arrested there early the
next day, the sheriff's office said.
   They were held by authorities in Hamilton, about 30 miles south
of Toronto.
   Kerns faced charges of grand larceny, assault and passing a bad
check. Barnes was serving 50 years on kidnap and rape charges in
Virginia when he was transferred to Allegany County to be tried for
kidnapping, rape and possession of a deadly weapon.
   For three days after the escape, authorities believed Beeman was
a hostage. One of the escapees allegedly had his arm around
Beeman's neck when the three left the jail.
   Beeman, a guard at the jail for 10 years, was dubbed a fugitive
after she called her 21-year-old daughter in Frostburg and told
her, ``I'm fine. I'm with him,'' authorities said.
   Beeman has been charged with aiding an escape, a felony with a
maximum penalty of 10 years in jail.
   Ms. Bembenek and Dominick Gugliatto were arrested after
authorities were contacted by an ``America's Most Wanted'' viewer
who recognized Ms. Bembenek in a Thunder Bay restaurant.
   Ms. Bembenek was serving a life sentence for the 1981 killing of
Christine Schultz, the previous wife of Ms. Bembenek's
then-husband. Authorities allege Ms. Bembenek, 32, killed Mrs.
Schultz out of resentment for the $700-a-month alimony payments she
was receiving.

   ``We must show the spiritual side of our life,'' Solti said.
``What could be a better ambassador for that than the Chicago

   Weary from a bruising battle over the federal
budget, the Senate is wading into another fight over whether to
renew strict anti-obscenity restrictions on the National Endowment
for the Arts.
   The debate pits Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and his conservative
allies against supporters of a bipartisan compromise proposal,
which would have the courts decide whether federally supported arts
projects are obscene.
   At issue before the Senate was an $11.7 billion appropriations
bill for the Interior Department and several other federal agencies
in the 1991 fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. The Senate measure
contains $170 million for the NEA and the same anti-obscenity curbs
that Congress imposed a year ago.
   Acton on the bill was delayed until late tonight or Saturday so
the Senate can tackle more pressing end-of-session legislation,
including a stopgap resolution extending government spending
authority through Wednesday.
   The Senate bill ignores a House-approved compromise that would
omit any explicit obscenity ban. The House bill would require the
NEA to recoup its money from grant recipients who later are
convicted of violating obscenity laws.
   A similar judicial approach to the ``obscene art'' issue had
been approved on a bipartisan 15-1 vote by the Senate Labor and
Human Resources Committee, but Helms effectively blocked floor
action on that measure.
   In a move apparently aimed at placating Helms, the Senate
Appropriations Committee voted to keep the NEA alive for one more
year, trim its proposed $175 million budget and reinstate the
strict, Helms-inspired obscenity ban for another year.
   The bill also would allow NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer to
continue to require grant recipients to sign a non-obscenity pledge
before they can receive federal funds. The pledge, which the House
voted to scrap, has caused widespread protests in the arts
community and is the target of three federal lawsuits.
   Current law forbids the endowment to finance any works that
``may be considered obscene,'' including depictions of homosexual
and sadomasochistic activities, the sexual exploitation of children
and ``individuals engaged in sex acts.''
   The House voted to scrap the obscenity restrictions and extend
the NEA's statutory authority for three years, with a first-year
budget of $180 million compared with $171 million last year. The
House bill said only that obscenity lacks artistic merit, is not
protected speech and ``shall not be funded'' by the endowment.
   Last year the NEA awarded $153 million in grant money to nearly
4,500 artists and arts institutions, from opera and ballet
companies to painters and poets. Most of the grants required
matching funds from private sources.
   Whatever the outcome of the Senate debate, it will remain for
negotiators to reconcile differences between House and Senate
versions before a final bill is ready for enactment.
   The Senate compromise bottled up by Helms was drafted by
liberals Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
and conservatives Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Nancy L. Kassebaum,
R-Kan.

<HEAD>BUDGET AND TAXES</HEAD>

   -The House and Senate are searching for a compromise budget
reduction package. The government is scheduled to run out of money
at midnight tonight, but White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said the president was prepared to sign legislation to keep the
government in business for another five days until final budget
details are worked out.
   The House-passed bill would hit hard at higher-income Americans,
chiefly by raising the maximum 28 percent tax rate on top earners
to 33 percent and imposing a 10 percent surtax on those with
incomes over $1 million. The Senate bill would not change tax rates
but would limit itemized deductions of those with incomes over
$100,000.
   Final passage is needed on 13 appropriations bills financing
government agencies in the new budget year, which started Oct. 1.

package would have to be approved subsequently in both the House
and Senate.

   -Senate leaders and the Bush administration have reached
agreement on the broad outlines of legislation providing assistance
for low-income families. But major differences with the House
remain an obstacle to passage.
   The latest Senate version is a five-year, $15 billion package.
Most of the money would go for an expansion of earned income tax
credits for low-income working families with children.

<HEAD>ASSAULT WEAPONS</HEAD>

   -The Senate has approved an omnibus anti-crime bill that would
ban the sale of nine semiautomatic assault weapons. But the House
version contains no such provision. Instead, the House may vote on
a bill to outlaw ownership or sale of semiautomatics the Treasury
Department deemed not suitable for sporting purposes. The
politically influential National Rifle Association opposes both
bills and House sponsors are clearly nervous over whether their
measure could survive on the floor at this stage.

agriculture programs for the next five years awaits final passage

<TEXT>
   A family-run shipping business with a history of
accidents and illegal operations was ordered to pull its barges out
of the spill-plagued New York harbor.
   The action by the state Department of Environmental Conservation
was the first time it has exercised its authority to ground an
entire fleet of barges since the department was created in 1970.
   Commissioner Thomas C. Jorling said the companies and
individuals named in his order have a record so bad that, ``their
continued operation presents an imminent danger to public health
and irreparable damage to the environment.''
   One of the company's barges, operating illegally, sank Sept. 27
at the First Marine Shipyard on Staten Island, spilling 50,000
gallons of oil into a waterway known as the Kill Van Kull.
   That was only the latest in a series of unrelated spills that
have dumped more than 1 million gallons of petroleum products into
the harbor during the past year.
   The three companies named in the order are among the 45 or so
owned by the family of former city Ports and Terminals Commissioner
Susan Frank, as well as her mother, brother and sister.
   They control at least 19 barges - about 10 percent of all
commercial barges operating in the harbor, Jorling said.
   The companies are Berman Enterprises Inc. of New York City, and
General Marine Transport Corp. and Standard Marine Services Inc.,
both of Bayonne, N.J.
   Also named were 72-year-old Evelyn Berman Frank, who heads
General Marine; Peter Frank, president of General Marine; and Jane
Frank Kresch, secretary of Berman Enterprises.
   Telephoe messages left at their offices were not immediately
returned.
   The barges are to remain docked at least until a hearing Oct.
30, at which time the company will be allowed to present its case.
After that, the environmental conservation department will
determine whether to lift the shutdown order or allow the companies
to operate under restrictions.
   The companies are also the subject of an ongoing criminal
investigation, Jorling said.
   In addition to the sinking of the Sarah Frank last month, the
companies have been responsible since 1983 for nine known oil
spills, three groundings, two collisions and 21 other cases in
which the Coast Guard assessed penalties, Jorling's order said.
   They have also been involved in fires and explosions that have
resulted in the deaths of two people and serious injuries to
others, it said.

   A third death was confirmed in an
outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis, a mosquito-carried disease that
has spread to 18 Florida counties, health officials said.
   A 69-year-old Orange County man who died Oct. 13 was a victim of
encephalitis, bringing to three the total deaths in the outbreak,
said Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services spokesman
Ernie Durfee on Thursday.
   His identity wasn't immediately released.
   Tests also were performed Thursday to determine whether a
91-year-old man who died Monday in Martin County was a victim of
the disease, but Durfee said they were incomplete. Local health
officials said he had suffered flu-like symptoms that closely
matched those of encephalitis.
   Three cases were confirmed Thursday in central Florida, bringing
to 46 confirmed cases statewide. An additional 23 people have
passed the first of two confirmation tests.
   ``We're still classifying it as an outbreak, not an epidemic,''
Durfee said.
   So far, the outbreak was confined to central and southern
Florida.
   In 1977, the last major outbreak, 110 cases were reported and
eight people died.
   Because encephalitis is carried by mosquitos that prefer to bite
after dark, health officials have urged people to wear long
clothing when going outside at night. Municipalities have stepped
up spraying of insecticide, and outdoor activities such as prep
football games have been moved to daytime.

<TEXT>
   Scores of armed policemen raided the offices of
the renamed East German Communist Party to seek clues in an alleged
$65 million fraud case.
   A Berlin prosecutor said, however, that the raid shortly before
midnight on Thursday at the offices of the Party of Democratic
Socialism turned up no such information. The prosecutor spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The raid was the latest action by the united German government
against vestiges of the old, often corrupt regime that ruled former
East Germany for 40 years. It came on the first anniversary of
Communist Party boss Erich Honecker's ouster as leader of the
former hard-line government.
   German law enforcment officials said they raided the offices to
check on suspicions that the former Communists may have illegally
transferred $65 million to the Soviet Union.
   Party chief Gregor Gysi and other top party officials today
protested the action at the Berlin offices, saying it violated
their rights and would only radicalize former Communists trying to
fit into the new society.
   ``I'm exhausted with this daily struggle to destroy us,'' he
said.
   Gysi said an unspecified sum had been transferred to the Soviet
Union to cover living expenses for German students the party had
sponsored there.
   He said such payments were an ``old financial burden'' inherited
from the former Communist Party.
   Gysi's office was among those searched by 150 police officers
wearing bullet-proof vests. The party headquarters is near
Alexanderplatz, the central square of former East Berlin.
   Also searched was the office of Hans Modrow, former premier of
the Communist caretaker government that ran East Germany after the
old regime was ousted following mass demonstrations last year.
   Gysi, Modrow and 23 other members of the former Communist Party
are members of the united German Parliament. East German lawmakers
were added to the West German legislature when the two nations
united on Oct 3.
   The former Communists finished third in East Germany's state
elections in March.
   Former functionaries in the old party are believed holding
millions of marks in property and cash because of their position of
privilege during the old regime.
   A police spokesman said the offices were raided ``because of the
danger of delay.''
   Germany has been struggling with how to deal with the remains of
the old Stalinist order that ruled the nation with an iron fist.
   Lawmakers are debating whether to grant amnesty to the thousands
who worked for eastern Germany's secret police and government. More
than 60 former East German spies have been arrested in western
Germany in recent months.
   Authorities also are trying to decide whether to prosecute
members of the old power elite for corruption, abuse of power and
other charges.
   Prosecutors are investigating whether to charge Honecker, 78,
who is suffering from kidney cancer in a Soviet military hospital
oustside Berlin.
   But they have been unable to make sufficient progress in their
criminal probe to arrest the deposed East German leader, officials
said today.
   Berlin Justice Department chief Jutta Limbach said various
factors, including a lack of a sufficient number of prosecutors,
has slowed the investigation.

<TEXT>
   A tour operator has told an
investigator that he witnessed Texas' Democratic gubernatorial
candidate Ann Richards using cocane 13 years ago, a newspaper
reported today.
   The Richards campaign denied the allegation.
   The Albuquerque Journal said tour operator J.D. Arnold of Santa
Fe, N.M., told a Bexar County, Texas, sheriff's investigator that
he saw Richards use cocaine in a foyer outside a restroom at the
Stoneleigh P. bar in Dallas. He said the incident occurred during
the early morning hours of Dec. 7, 1977, after a fund-raising
banquet for then-congressman Jim Mattox.
   Richards' staff said Arnold is a former aide to Mattox, whom
Richards defeated in a bitter Democratic primary runoff this
spring.
   After Richards refused to say yes or no when asked during a
debate whether she had ever abused illegal drugs, Mattox sought to
make that question a primary campaign issue.
   The Richards campaign said Arnold is an unreliable source
because of his past run-ins with the law and that Arnold's charge
is a tactic by Richards' opponent, Republican Clayton Williams.
   Judy Powers of Los Alamos, N.M., said she was at the gathering
that night and said Richards never was there.
   ``I don't know why he'd want to help Clayton Williams,'' Ms.
Powers said. ``He's been a lifelong Democrat. But I do know that
Ann Richards was not there.''
   Jim DeLesdernier, chief of the criminal investigation division
for the Bexar County sheriff's office, said he flew to Santa Fe on
Monday to talk to Arnold as part of an investigation into drug
trafficking in the San Antonio area. He said the trip was not
politically motivated and refused to say whether there had been an
allegation of cocaine use by Richards.
   DeLesdernier said Sheriff Harlan Copeland authorized the trip to
interview Arnold. He said that although Arnold's charges involve
events past Texas' five-year statute of limitations, he believes
they could lead to more recent incidents.
   ``Don't you think that on the surface it stinks?'' Monte
Williams, a spokesman for Richards, told the newspaper. After the
story was published today, the Richards campaign scheduled an
afternoon news conference.
   Williams called it ``laughable'' that the Bexar County sheriff
would spend tax money to research an allegation of an incident from
1977, adding that it was ``a sign of how desperate the Clayton
Williams campaign has become.''
   Reggie Bashur, a spokesman for Williams, said today that the GOP
campaign had nothing to do with Arnold or his charges.

<TEXT>
   The first democratically elected Hungarian
leader to visit the White House in four decades is taking home a
packet of Bush administration pledges to help his ailing economy.
   ``Our visit here has opened a new era in U.S.-Hungarian
relations,'' Prime Minister Jozsef Antall said at a farewell news
conference.
   Among Antall's worries as he tries to steer the Central European
country toward political democracy and a free market system is
spillover from a faltering Soviet economy.
   Bush said Thursday the United States would provide $47.5 million
in agricultural credits and loan guarantees to help Hungary recover
from a drought-inflicted grain shortage.
   Bush also announced he would push for international lending
concessions for Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland, and that U.S.
travel restrictions on Hungary's diplomats would be lifted. In
addition, Hungary will establish a consulate in Los Angeles.
   Antall stressed Bush's promise to encourage American firms to do
business in Hungary. ``It is very important to us to see American
investments in Hungary and we would like to see them strengthened
in the future,'' he said, speaking through an interpreter.
   Antall said his delegation had discussed with U.S. officials how
to insulate Hungary from economic chaos should the already
faltering Soviet economic go into a deeper tailspin.
   Despite Hungary's break from communism its ties to Moscow are
still strong.
   Besides his meeting with Bush, the Hungarian leader visited
Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher, before being honored at a White House state dinner
Thursday night.
   In his welcoming remarks to Antall, Bush answered Hungary's
request for what one administration official referred to as a
``strong signal'' to foreign investors. ``I encourage more American
businesses to find out what Hungary has to offer,'' the president
said.
   ``Hungary is no longer an emerging democracy. Hungary is a
democracy,'' he said.
   To help Hungary stabilize its economy as it moves from communism
to a free-market system, Bush called on the International Monetary
Fund to make lending concessions to it and other Eastern European
countries.
   He said the lending organization should make $5 billion
available to compensate the new democracies for the burden they are
suffering by supporting United Nations sanctions against Iraq.
   ``We understand that the loss of export markets and rising
energy costs complicate your historic effort to transform a
centrally planned economic system to a free-market economy,'' Bush
told Antall.
   Hungary plans to send a military medical unit to Saudi Arabia,
where the bulk of the U.S. troops are stationed in opposition to
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein, said Deputy Assistant Secretary of
State Curtis Kamman.
   Bush told the Hungarian he was pleased with Antall's support for
the U.S.-led opposition to Iraq.
   He also said he would seek acceleration by the Wold Bank of aid
in the energy field, drawing on $9 billion already committed to
Central and Eastern Europe.
   Antall said the president had ``granted us everything that we
could have enumerated as our request or as our complaints.''
   In fact, he said in a toast at the state dinner that Bush is so
popular in Hungary that he probably could find a good political job
there when he is through being president of the United States.
   ``I'm sure the Hungarian nation would surely elect you as
president,'' Antall told Bush.

   The family of a woman who has suffered two
strokes is asking a County Court to remove the feeding tubes that
keep her alive.
   Joseph M. Ragona filed suit Thursday, the day after Orphan's
Court Judge Frank P. Eagen declared Ragona's wife, Ruth,
incompetent and appointed him as her guardian. The couple's four
children filed affidavits supporting their father's request.
   Named as defendants are the hospital and state Attorney General
Ernest D. Preate Jr., whose responsibilities include representing
``the state's interest in the preservation of life, prevention of
suicide and maintenance of the ethical integrity of the health care
profession,'' according to the suit filed in Lackawanna County
Court.
   The petition said that Mrs. Ragona ``stated in unequivocal terms
to her family member that she did not want her life to be
prolonged by artificial means or other mechanical life-sustaining
procedures.''
   Mrs. Ragona, 63, suffered a stroke in 1984 and has remained
hospitalized at Moses Taylor Hospital since a second stroke Feb. 8.
   The woman's physician, Dr. Vithalbhai D. Dhaduk, said in a
letter that Mrs. Ragona does not understand or react to questions,
and that there is ``no chance that she will improve.''
   The petition argues that Mrs. Ragona has the right to be removed
from the tubes because of ``Pennsylvania's doctrine of informed
consent prohibiting a physician from instituting any medical
procedures without a patient's express consent.''
   Hospital spokeswoman Tricia Pahoski said the hospital would not
comment on the case. The attorney general's office also said there
would be no immediate response.
   Last June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 in a Missouri case
that under that state's laws, the state could keep a patient on
life support in the absence of ``clear and convincing proof'' that
the person would want to die.

   Some cars caught fire and rescuers needed several hours to clear

   There are no speed limits on most highways in western Germany

   Police said the farmers arrived at an administrative center in

   The governing National Party
agreed to open its membership to all races Friday when the last of
four provincial congresses voted to support the proposal of
President F.W. de Klerk.
   ``Our goals are beyond reproach and we can say with elation that
the National Party is on course,'' de Klerk told 1,000 congress
delegates meeting in Pretoria.
   All four provincial congresses easily passed the measure, which
called for eliminating racial qualification for membership.
Approval by the congresses permits the party hierarchy to make the
change.
   The move represented a sharp reversal for the National Party,
which implemented the apartheid system of racial segregation and
white dominance after gaining power in 1948.
   The party has traditionally been the political domain of
Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended whites who domiate the government.
   Despite the move, it was not clear if many blacks would join the
National Party. African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela has
said any prominent black would be commiting political suicide if he
joined the governing party.
   Even if blacks were to join the National Party, South Africa's
constitution prohibits them from voting in national elections.
   De Klerk has pledged to end apartheid and negotiate
power-sharing with the black majority. He also has sought the
lifting of international economic sanctions imposed against South
Africa to protest apartheid.
   Foreign Affairs Minister Pik Botha told the congress South
Africa had emerged from international isolation since de Klerk
became president just over a year ago. He noted that world leaders
who previously rejected South African leaders now receive them.

<HEAD>Two Dissidents Sentenced to Jail Terms; Monks Warned</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Burma's military rulers have sentenced two
dissidents jail terms, a government spokesman said Friday. It was
the latest crackdown on the party that won free elections but has
been barred from taking office.
   Also, Buddhist monks have been warned to stop refusing to
perform religious ceremonies for soldiers and their families.
   The dissidents were members of the National League for
Democracy, the pro-democracy force that easily won elections held
on May 27. But the military has refused to relinquish control, and
most of the party's leaders have since been arrested.
   The military government took power in 1988 by brutally crushing
a nationwide pro-democracy movement. Human rights groups including
the London-based Amnesty International say troops killed several
thousand people that year.
   A government spokesman told a news conference Friday that the
seven-year jail terms for the two dissidents were handed down
Thursday by a military tribunal.
   The two - Ohn Kyaing and Thein Tan - were arrested on Sept. 6
and accused of inciting unrest in the central city of Mandalay.
   Ohn Kyaing was a central committee member for the league in
Mandalay and Thein Tan a party organizer.
   At a meeting in Rangoon Thursday, Prime Minister Gen. Saw Maung
told 19 senior Buddhist monks their boycott of the military must be
lifted by Saturday, but he did not say what he would do if the
monks refused.
   His comments were broadcast on state radio and television.
   Monks in some monasteries in Mandalay and in the capital,
Rangoon, began refusing to perform religious services for troops
and their families after the army broke up an anti-government
demonstration in Mandalay on Aug. 8.
   During the protest, troops killed four people, including two
Buddhist monks, according to Western diplomats in Rangoon.
   According to a transcript of his comments seen in Bangkok, Saw
Maung said: ``I have tolerated as much as I can ... I have decided
to take measures that should be taken.''
   About 85 percent of Burma's population of 40 million are
Buddhist and some 200,000 monks live in monasteries around the
country. In Buddhist societies, monks play an important role in
family celebrations and rites.
   The Young Monks Organization of Mandalay announced its boycott
on Sept. 6.
   A Western diplomat in Rangoon, contacted from Bangkok, called
the monks' action ``the equivalent of excommunication.''
   Saw Maung claimed there were no deaths during the August
demonstration and told the monks the boycott was uncalled for. He
also emphasised his efforts to promote Buddhism.
   Also at Friday's news conference, government spokesman Maj. Than
Tun denied foreign news reports that four people were killed when
authorities broke up a hunger strike at Rangoon's Insein jail on
Sept. 23.
   He said about 20 inmates were involved in the three-day strike.

   A man who was convicted of torching
his 6-year-old son in a motel room in 1983 will stay in San Quentin
Prison because he violated his parole, officials said.
   Charles Rothenberg's parole is revoked for eight months, Jim
Dowling, spokesman for the Board of Prison Terms, said Thursday.
Rothenberg will be credited for the time served since he was
arrested in Oakland on Sept. 10, the spokesman said.
   Rothenberg was en route to a job interview in Oakland with a
parole agent when he ducked out of a doughnut shop and eluded
authorities for four hours before he was captured and taken to San
Quentin.
   ``He deliberately violated his parole,'' Tipton Kindel, a
spokesman for the California Department of Corrections, said at the
time. ``We don't know why he would jeopardize what freedom he had
to live on the outside ... but it was a big mistake on his part.''
   Rothenberg, 50, was convicted of attempted murder, arson and
other charges for pouring kerosene over his son, David, and setting
the boy on fire. David was severely disfigured.
   Rothenberg served six years and five months of his maximum
13-year sentence before he was paroled Jan. 24. He was freed early
for good behavior and put on three years of strictly supervized
parole.

<HEAD>Police Raid Offices of Former Communist Party</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East Germany's former Communists claimed Friday
their democratic rights were trampled when a small army of police
raided their headquarters in a fruitless hunt for criminal
evidence.
   About 150 armed lawmen burst into the headquarters shortly
before midnight Thursday to search for clues to allegations that
the party had recently funneled $65 million into the Soviet Union.
   However, a Berlin prosecutor, speaking on condition of
anyonymity, said the raid at the party's Berlin offices turned up
no such information.
   The former Communists have renamed their organization the Party
of Democratic Socialism.
   The raid was the latest action by the united German government
in its effort to sift through the remains of the authoritarian
government that ruled East Germany for 40 years.
   There is widespread belief that Communists in the often corrupt
former government squirreled away billions in property, cash and
valuables in the waning days of their rule.
   The raid came on he first anniversary of Erich Honecker's
ouster as Communist leader of the hard-line government.
   Gregor Gysi, the current party leader who also holds a
Parliament seat in the united Germany, denounced the raids as
illegal and an infringement on the democratic rights of party
members.
   He claimed that persecution of former Communist Party members,
whose current party now professes a form of democratic socialism,
would only serve to radicalize them.
   ``I'm exhausted with this daily struggle to destroy us,'' he
said.
   The raid also drew criticism from the left-leaning Social
Democrats, Germany's main opposition party; and the Free Democrats,
who are part of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing coaliton.
   Martin Hirsch, a former Supreme Court judge and Social Democrat,
said the raid was tantamount to ``attacking gnats with iron bars.''
   ``The (party of former Communists) is in fact a political
opposition, but it is not outlawed,'' Burkhard Hirsch, spokesman on
law enforcement matters for the Free Democrats, said in an
interview released before publication of the Cologne Express
newspaper.
   Berlin Interior Senator Erich Paetzold said authorities received
a tip on Thursday that the party was making a big money transfer to
the Soviet Union.
   A police spokesman said the raid was necessary ``because of the
danger of delay.''
   Gysi said the money was transferred to the Soviet Union to cover
living expenses for German students the party had sponsored in that
country.
   He said such payments were an ``old financial burden'' inherited
from the former Communist Party.
   Gysi's office was among those searched by 150 police officers
wearing bulletproof vests. The party's headquarters is near
Alexanderplatz, the central square of former East Berlin.
   Also searched was the office of Hans Modrow, former premier of
the Communist caretaker government that ran East Germany after the
old hard-line government was ousted by mass demonstrations last
year.
   Gysi, Modrow and 23 other members of the former Communist Party
are members of the united German Parliament. East German lawmakers
were added to the West German legislature when the two nations
united on Oct. 3.
   The former Communists finished third in East Germany's first
free elections in March.
   The united Germany has been struggling with how to deal with the
remains of the old Stalinist order that ruled the eastern territory
with an iron fist.
   Lawmakers are debating whether to grant amnesty to the thousands
of people who worked for the notorious secret police.
   They are also weighing criminal charges agains the old leaders.

<HEAD>Earthquake Rattles Eastern Canada, Northern New York</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A moderate earthquake shook eastern Canada and
northern New York and Vermont early Friday, but there were no
reports of damage or injuries.
   The quake struck the Canadian cities of Ottawa and Montreal, and
was felt in the New York cities of Syracuse, Albany, Rochester and
Buffalo, as well as Montpelier and Burlington in Vermont, according
to U.S. and Canadian officials.
   The quake, which struck just after 3 a.m. (same time EDT),
measured 5.2 on the Richter scale, said Maurice Lamontagne, a
seismologist with the Geophysics Divison of Energy Mines and
Resources in Ottawa.
   However, the U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colo., said the
quake measured 4.7 on the Richter scale. The quake's epicenter was
about 70 miles north of Ottawa, said Lamontagne and Bruce
Presgrave, a geophysicist in Golden.
   In Canada, the quake was also felt in North Bay, Ontario, and
Quebec City, said a spokesman for Emergency Preparedness Canada.
   There were no initial reports of damage, but an Ottawa resident
said houses rattled during the tremor, which lasted about 10
seconds. A Montreal resident said the quake felt mild.
   Police in Ottawa, the nation's capital, said they were kept busy
chasing burglar alarms that were set off by the quake. ``Motion
detectors don't like those things,'' Const. John Swardfager said.
He said the area gets two or three tremors a year, but most are
undectable.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs.
   Canada's earthquake zones lie along its west coast, along the
Rockies, in the Yukon and High Arctic, in western Quebec and along
the east coast.
   Most of the quake zones are sparsely populated and major damage
or loss of life is uncommon.

<HEAD>Four Charged With Treason in Continuing Crackdown on Dissent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>BY CHEGE MBITIRU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Kenyans, including two lawyers and a
leader of an underground opposition group who recently returned
from exile, were charged Friday with treason, a capital offense.
   The arrests were the latest in a government crackdown that began
in July after an abortive pro-democracy rally sparked riots in
Nairobi and the countryside.
   President Daniel arap Moi has repeatedly accused those who
advocate a multiparty system of seeking the overthrow of his
single-party government.
   Prosecutor Alex Etiang told a magistrate's court the four
arrested men had, acting with others, ``intended the overthrow of
the government of Kenya by unlawful means.''
   The four - Koigi wa Wamwere, Rumba Kinuthia, Mirugi Kariuki, and
Geofrey Kuga Kariuki - were ordered held in custody until Nov. 2,
when they are to appear in the High Court.
   Wamwere, a former legislator, and lawyer Kinuthia were arrested
in the capital, Nairobi, in a predawn raid Oct. 8. Mirugi Kariuki,
also a lawyer, was picked up the same day in a provincial town of
Nakuru, 100 miles northwest of Nairobi.
   Geofrey Kariuki's arrest had not been announced prior to his
court appearance. His profession and his relationship with Mirugi
Kariuki, if any, could not be determined immediately.
   The government said in a statement that police had ``recovered
assorted arms and ammunitions'' in arresting Wamwere. The following
day, local newspapers published photographs of AK-47 assault rifles
and grenades.
   Newspaper editors said the state-owned Kenya News Agency
provided the photographs.
   The four are among at least a dozen people, including
businessmen, lawyers and a parliamentarian, who are known to have
been arrested in an ongoing crackdown on dissidents and critics of
Moi's government. Many others have been brought in for questioning.
   Wamwere is a long-time critic of Kenya's establishment. He had
been twice detained without trial or charge and in 1986 fled to
Norway in 1986, claiming his life was in danger. He was granted
political asylum.
   In 1988, Wamwere announced he had formed the opposition Kenya
Patriotic Front.
   Kenyn law permits detention without trial or charge of
individuals that the state considers a threat to security.
   Wamwere had no access to his lawyer or family since his arrest
and his attorney, Japhet Shamalla, and Niels Dahl, the Norwegian
ambassador, this week protested to the government.
   Kinuthia has been associated with advocates of multiparty
politics in this East African nation. He recently made public his
resignation from the ruling party, saying he no longer subscribed
to its doctrines.
   Mirugi Kariuki, a former detainee, practiced law in Nakuru.
   Three of the advocates of a multiparty system arrested in July -
two former Cabinet ministers and the son of Kenya's first Vice
President Oginga Odinga - remain in detention.
   The state said 20 people were killed by security forces in
July's riots, but the London-based human rights group, Africa
Watch, claimed the number was more than 100.

   Fire in a San Jose State University
dormitory this morning injured at least 21 students, including two
who were critically burned and another who suffered a broken back,
authorities said.
   The fire at Andrew Moulder Hall in downtown San Jose was
reported shortly before 6 a.m. and put out within an hour, said
Teresa Zagalo, a dispatcher with the San Jose Fire Department.
   The fire department listed 23 injured, but three hospitals
reported treating 21, including two students who were listed in
critical condition and four others in serious condition,
authorities said.
   The cause of the blaze remained unknown this morning, said
university spokeswoman Lori Stahl. The three-story coed dormitory,
which was evacuated, housed about 160 students, she said.
   Three male students were taken to Santa Clara Valley Medical
Center, where two were in critical condition with burns on 40
percent to 55 percent of their bodies, said Chris Reilly, a nurse
recruiter at the hospital.
   A third student had burns over 5 percent of his body and was
listed in serious condition, she said.
   Ten students were taken to San Jose Medical Center, where three
were in serious condition, one with a broken back, and two with
burns to the hands and face, said hospital spokeswoman Christi
Welter. Others were being treated for smoke inhalation and minor
injuries, she said.
   Eight others were taken to Alexian Brothers Hospital. Six had
been released, and two were still being treated in the emergency
room at midmorning, said spokeswoman Nancy Manalo.
   The status of the two other students that the fire department
had listed as injured was not immediately known.

   A woman enraged by roaches sparked an
explosion by fumigating with nine pesticide foggers.
   ``That's probably about eight too many for her apartment,''
police Sgt. Steve LaRoche said. ``Her apartment no longer has any
windows in it.''
   A large crack also divides the living room ceiling, but none of
the other apartments in her building were affected when vapors
mixed to cause the insecticide eruption Thursday afternoon.
   The resident - who was not identified by police - was unhurt
during the blast at her two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment,
LaRoche said.
   It appears the bug foggers did the trick.
   ``I think she scared them all away,'' LaRoche said. ``They will
not be back for a while.''
   Neighbors stayed away, too, until firefighters flushed out fumes
with fans.

<HEAD>Baker Urges Day-To-Day Cooperation With Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III today
proposed extending U.S.-Soviet cooperation to virtually day-to-day
exchanges on issues such as military doctrine, arms proliferation
in the Persian Gulf and other regions, and economic reform in
Europe.
   ``Cooperation can become the norm, not the exception,'' Baker
said in a speech to a private group that promotes superpower
understanding.
   ``Common problems can best be solved mutually, not
unilaterally.''
   The largely philosophical proposal, which Baker described as ``
new pathways,'' of cooperation, marked a growing attempt by the
Bush administration to expand on joint efforts to contain Iraq in
the Persian Gulf.
   With the two powers moving to complete new treaties limiting
their forces in Europe as well as long-range nuclear weapons, Baker
said he would propose to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Schevardnadze setting up a working group to exchange information
about military doctrine and strategy.
   Also, he said, the U.S. and Soviet officials should meet
regularly on converting weapons and military facilities to peaceful
uses, and also on how to contain the proliferation of arms around
the world.
   ``We both see proliferation as perhaps the greatest security
challenge of the 1990s,'' Baker said in accepting the George F.
Kennan award from the American Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations.
   Having cooperated to try to deny weapons to Iraq, Baker said,
``working together, we may be able to inspire a more comprehensive
approach to nuclear, chemical, biological and missile
proliferation.''
   The award, named for an American diplomat who played a leading
role in framing the U.S. foreign policy toward the Soviet Union
after World War II, was shared with Shevardnadze.
   ``Cooperation can operate in a regular, almost day-by-day
fashion to manage problems as they evolve.'' Baker said. ``A
pathway assumes that cooperation may prevent future problems as
well as resolve past ones.''
   Beyond issues of war and peace, Baker said, ``we need to build
pathways'' to enhance prospects for economic growth, protect the
environment and assure a steady supply of resources.
   ``We would invite the private sector and non-governmental
organizations, and develop new U.S.-Soviet exchanges,'' he said.

<HEAD>China Makes Second Wheat Purchase Of Week Under Subsidy Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought an additional 449,370 metric
tons of U.S. wheat under a price subsidy program, the second
purchase this week, the Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Officials said the subsidies for wheat sold to China have
doubled from what they were a few months ago.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said eight private exporting
companies made the deals under the department's Export Enhancement
Program, or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for the first three months of
1991, he said. On Thursday, the department announced sales totaling
299,740 tons, the first to China under EEP since Aug. 1.
   The sales were part of 2 million tons authorized China under EEP
on May 2. Dickerson said China has only about 10,000 tons remaining
in its current allocation.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 16.5 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by USDA at around $2.42 per bushel, the
wheat would have a farm value of around $40 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $43.87 per ton, or
about $1.20 per bushel.
   That was double the bonuses paid on China's wheat purchase on
Aug. 1, which averaged $20.40 per ton, or 56 cents per bushel. Huge
crops in many countries have pressured world prices and triggered
competition among exporting countries.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Cargill Inc., 75,000 tons;
Continental Grain Co., 59,520; J. Aron and Co., 90,000; Garnac
Grain Co. Inc., 45,000; Mitsubishi International, 30,000; Ferruzzi
U.S.A. Inc., 75,000; Tradigrain Inc., 29,850; and Woodhouse Corp.,
45,000.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 3.2 milion tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1990-91 wheat marketing year that
began June 1, compared with 5.6 million tons in 1989-90.

   A man who called himself ``The Shoe
Bandit'' was sentenced to 10 years in prison for two burglaries in
which he stole women's shoes.
   Tasso Young Hunter, 30, was sentenced Thursday by Circuit Judge
R. Hudson Olliff. He pleaded guilty Oct. 4.
   When arrested in August, Hunter was found with 22 pairs of
women's shoes, including a pair from each of two burglary victims
in the apartment complex where he lived. He also took an
undetermined amount of women's cothing and cash.
   Police found a note by Hunter listing his shoe-theft victims. He
wasn't charged in all of the cases.
   Before his arrest, one of the burglary victims was threatened
with an expletive-filled note signed ``The Shoe Bandit.''
   Hunter has nine previous convictions since 1980 for burglary,
theft and firearms offenses. He was released from prison in April
1989 after serving three months of an 18-month sentence for
possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.

   The army overran Tamil rebel bunkers
and reached two villages in a bid to expand its small foothold in
the Jaffna Peninsula, military officials said Friday.
   Three soldiers and 10 Tamil Tiger guerrillas were killed in
Thursday's fighting south of the government-held Palali airstrip,
the officials said.
   Lawrence Thilaker, a spokesman for the Tamil Tigers based in
Paris, said the rebels lost 15 fighters while ``stopping government
troops trying to expand their perimeters around camps.''
   ``This is a heavy loss,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   The government launched its latest offensive Wednesday, pushing
out of Palali toward Jaffna town, eight miles to the south.
Military officials said 18 guerrillas and seven soldiers have been
killed in the fighting.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said 20
soldiers were wounded. They said army units reached Punnalia and
Mallakan Kudduwan, about two and a half miles from the airstrip.
   Four soldiers were killed and 43 wounded on Wednesday, the army
said.
   Thilaker, the Tamil spokesman, said he had reports that ``the
government has lost more than 50 soldiers ... and many more have
been critically injured in hand-to-hand combat.'' He did not
specify when the casualties occured.
   The peninsula, located 180 miles north of Colombo, has been
under an indefinite curfew since Tuesday. Civilians were warned by
leaflets dropped from army aircraft to evacuate areas near the
military camps.
   The Tamil Tigers hold Jaffna town and most of the rest of the
Jaffna Peninsula. Palali has frequently come under mortar attack
from Tamil guerrillas, who have been fighting the
Sinhalese-controlled government since 1983.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the insurrection.
   Jaffna town, 185 miles northeast of Colombo, is the guerrillas'
chief stronghold.
   The rebels want to create a separate homeland in northeastern
Sri Lanka for the island's Tamil minority. Tamils, who make up 18
percent of the nation's 16 million people, have long complained
that the Sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs and education.
   Sinhalese, who comprise 75 percent of the population, have
controlled the government and military since the island, once known
as Ceylon, became independent from Britain in 1948.

   The state's eight public universities

Jr.'s birthday.
   The 12-member state College Board on Thursday unanimously
endorsed a September decision to declare the civil rights leader's
birthday a holiday for college students.
   The vote, without discussion, came minutes after a speech by
white supremacist Richard Barrett denouncing ``Kingism'' as a
threat to national unity.
   In September, board members approved the holiday 6-5, with one
member absent. Board guidelines require a second confirmation vote
on any change of university policy, including mandated holidays.
   ``I am pleased the board chose to reaffirm its position,'' said
Commissioner of Higher Education Ray Cleere. ``They listened to
opinions on all sides and then made their decision.''
   King's birthday is Jan. 15, but the universities can declare the
holiday on a date near that.

<TEXT>
   Senior House Democrats today indicated a
willingness to negotiate a deficit-reduction plan that includes
some increase in the gasoline tax, but insisted President Bush must
accept a higher burden on the rich.
   ``Obviously, compromises are required,'' House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley told reporters after a party caucus. ``The insistence of the
president in having no income tax changes (affecting the rich)
seems to be inexplicable and inflexible.''
   At the White House, Bush said the Senate bill ``offers some real
hope for getting the budget deficit matter under control,'' but
would not discuss what he thinks the final version should contain.
   ``I, for the first time, feel optimistic that we can get this
job done for the American people,'' Bush said.
   The Senate, meanwhile, approved a bill to extend temporary
funding for government operations past tonight's midnight deadline
and White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater indicated Bush was
likely to sign it.
   Bush, Fitzwater said, wants to satisfy himself ``that
satisfactory progress is being made'' on the budget before signing
the measure.
   Foley said Democrats will insist House and Senate negotiators
moderate a Senate proposal to increase the gasoline tax by 9{ cents
and raise Medicare premiums.
   The conferees began working on a compromise measure after the
Senate passed its deficit plan on a 54-46 vote this morning.
   ``One more big hurdle and then we'll have the job done,'' said
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Congressional leaders had hoped to work out differences in time
to get an agreement to Bush before midnight, but they indicated
today that a final bill is unlikely before next week.
   The House measure, vastly different from the Senate bill, would
take three-fifths of its revenue from higher income taxpayers. The
Senate wants to raise money by increasing the tax on gasoline,
alcohol, cigarettes and luxury items.
   Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., said another ``area that's likely to
be negotiated'' is a House provision forgoing next year's inflation
adjustment in parts of the tax system, something Bush has
criticized.
   That provision, vigorously opposed by the Senate, would raise
taxes on all lower- and middle-income taxpayers.
   As the Senate completed work on the bill, many Republicans still
weren't forgiving Bush for abandoning his pledge to oppose tax
increases.
   ``Raising taxes in the face of a recession is a hare-brained
idea,'' said Sen. Bill Armstrong, R-Colo., who voted against the
measure.
   The Senate deficit plan would raise the 9-cent gasoline tax to
18{ cents a gallon; limit itemized deductions of those with incomes
over $100,000 a year; boost the Medicare tax for people earning
over $51,300, and make permanent the expiring 3 percent tax on
telephone service.
   The House version, which Bush has promised to veto, would get
most of its revenue from higher-income people. But it also would
hit lower- and middle-income people across the board by blocking
next year's scheduled inflation adjustments in tax brackets and
personal exemptions.
   Despite stark differences that have prompted cries of class
warfare from critics, the bills agree on many points.
   Either would raise consumer taxes on tobacco, alcoholic
beverages, airplane tickets and expensive cars, boats, furs and
jewels. Medicare beneficiaries would have to pay higher premiums
for Part B coverage and more out of pocket for doctors' bills
before Medicare starts paying.
   Both bills include changes in scores of federal fees and benefit
programs, all designed to save money and reduce the budget deficit.
These range from $13.5 billion of cuts in farm programs, to higher
penalties on businesses where safety violations are found, to
tightening eligibility requirements for student loans.
   The mixture of tax increases, user fees and benefit reductions
would provide about half the $500 billion, five-year deficit
reduction on which Congress and the Bush administration have been
trying to find agreement for five months.
   The other half also is making its way through Congress. These
savings will be made by slowing the growth of spending for the
military and hundreds of other government programs that are subject
to annual appropriations. About $70 billion in interest will be
saved by reduced borrowing.
   Most of the attention is focused on the tax and Medicare
provisions.
   Senators defeated three major amendments Thursday that were
aimed at reshaping the Senate version more in the mold of the House
bill. Mitchell cautioned that such changes would doom the whole
bill.
   Two of the amendments included provisions raising the 28 percent
top income tax rate paid by the nation's 700,000 wealthiest people
to 33 percent, as the House bill would do. The money would have
been used to moderate increases in Medicare costs and to scale down
the boost in gasoline tax.
   ``The president has said he will veto any legislation that
includes a 33 percent rate on the highest-income individuals,''
Mitchell said. ``I don't agree with the president ... but that is
the reality.''
   Bush also opposes the House provision that would require
taxpayers to forgo next year's scheduled ``bracket creep``
adjustment in tax brackets and personal exemptions. That would mean
higher income taxes for all but the wealthiest Americans.
   Senators, apparently fearing that any significant change in the
tax bill could destroy the coalition that held it together, even
rejected a proposed ``millionaires-for-Medicare'' swap. That
amendment would have imposed an 18 percent surtax in millionaires
in order to reduce Medicare patients' out-of-pocket expenses.

   The family of Gen. Michel Aoun drove to
Beirut's airport today to board a flight for Paris, but France and
Lebanon remained locked in a dispute over the fate of the defeated
rebel commander.
   Witnesses said a convoy of six French Embassy cars accompanied
by four Lebanese military police jeeps left the embassy compound in
the eastern suburb of Hazmiyeh and drove to the airport in
Syrian-controlled south Beirut.
   Two Air France executive jets had flown in earlier to evacuate
Aoun's wife, Nadia, and their three daughters - Mireille, 22,
Claudine, 19, and Chantal, 17 -and transport them to France, where
they will live in exile.
   Aoun remained in the French Embassy, where he has been granted
asylum.
   The Lebanese government has refused to allow Aoun to leave the
country, insisting that he face trial for a variety of crimes and
the alleged theft of at least $75 million from the ailing state
treasury.
   Earlier today, President Elias Hrawi accused Aoun - who took
refuge in the French Embassy with his family on Saturday - of
ordering his troops to continue fighting even after he broadcast
his message of surrender.
   ``I'm in the French Embassy. The outcome (of the battle) will be
favorable to us. Go on. Go on fighting,'' Hrawi quoted Aoun as
telling his forces last week in a radio message.
   ``These were the orders Aoun radioed to his forces, even after
his message of surrender was broadcast,'' Hrawi said in remarks
released by his office.
   Hrawi's government also denied press reports that scores of
Aoun's defeated soldiers were massacred after surrendering to the
Lebanese and Syrian forces who ended Aoun's 11-month mutiny on
Saturday.
   Prime Minister Salim Hoss said France's call for a United
Nations investigation of reports of such killings was based on
``biased rumors.''
   The Defense Ministry said in a communique that reports that
Aoun's troops were massacred after surrendering were ``absolutely
baseless.'' The communique said Aoun's troops who died ``fell in
the military operation.''
   The eight-hour, air-and-ground assault killed 350 people and
wounded 1,200 by police count. Police said the fatalities included
at least 100 Syrian soldiers. But The New York Times, citing
doctors at East Beirut hospitals and Syrian officers, said in
today's editions that the death toll was at least 750.
   Military sources speaking on condition of anonymity described
``ferocious hand-to-hand fighting'' between the advancing Syrian
troops and Aoun's forces on the eastern edge of his 80-square-mile
enclave in the Christian heartland.
   One source said that after Aoun's address was broadcast, one of
his officers told the Syrians he was surrendering, but then opened
fire when the Syrians came forward. The Syrians responsed by
pounding the Aoun forces' position with rocket launchers and tank
cannons, then stormed it with tank-led forces, according to the
source.
   The Defense Ministry's communique came a few hours after France
urged U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to investigate
reports of summary executions of Aoun's vanquished troops in the
enclave northeast of Beirut.
   French and British press reports said about 100 of Aoun's 15,000
troops were killed after surrendering. The French Foreign Ministry
said France was trying to obtain information about the reports but
also wanted a U.N. probe.
   French opposition leaders today demanded tougher French action
in response to the allegations. One of them - Alain Juppe,
secretary-general of the conservative Rally for the Republic party
- said the government should demand an emergency session of the
U.N. Security Council in order to force the withdrawal of Syrian
troops from Lebanon.
   A police spokesman in Lebanon said on Thursday that by the time
police examined the bodies of the slain troops they found ``no
solid evidence that the soldiers were liquidated.''
   ``None of the corpses we examined had hands tied behind the back
and very few of the dead soldiers were hit in the skulls with
bullets,'' said the spokesman, who could be named in line with
regulations.
   Associated Press photographer Ahmed Azakir, who visited the
government hospital in suburuban Baabda on Tuesday, reported seeing
more than 50 bodies of Aoun's troops in the morgue. He said none
had their hands tied.
   Most of Aoun's troops declared allegiance to Hrawi's army under
Gen. Emile Lahoud, a Maronite Catholic like both the president and
the defeated general.
   The leftist newspaper As-Safir - in a front-page, eight-column
headline - said the call for a U.N. investigation was part of a
French effort to ``distort the operation of unifying Beirut.''

   The White House opened the door today to the
possibility of a last-minute compromise to avert a threatened
presidential veto of the Civil Rights Act of 1990.
   But presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater suggested the
prospect was a long shot. He said Bush might decide by day's end go
ahead with a veto - and staple to it a legislative proposal more to
his liking.
   The only way that a veto can be avoided, Fitzwater said, would
be if Congress agreed to pass a separate measure that would in
effect rewrite the civil rights bill to meet the administration's
objections.
   Meanwhile, civil rights leaders demonstrated in front of the
White House and sought a meeting with Bush in their efforts to
persuade him to sign the bill.
   ``We are asking that, before he makes a decision to veto it,
that he would meet with the civil rights leadership,'' said
Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP.
   Hooks said that Bush had told him in a telephone conversation
that he was exploring possible ways to avoid a veto, including
passage of follow-up legislation.
   ``There is room for hope'' that Bush might reverse himself,
Hooks said.
   Fitzwater said that any such follow-up legislation would have to
make it clear that the civil rights legislation would not result in
hiring quotas for minorities.
   The spokesman said he was skeptiocal, however, that Congress
would go along with such an approach just two days after they
passed the initial measure.
   He said it seemed doubtful that the president would agree to the
civil rights leaders' requests for a meeting, since ``there's no
doubt in our minds about their views. They want us to sign the
bill.''
   The bill, passed by Congress earlier this week, would make it
easier for minorities to bring discrimination cases against their
employers. The administration has claimed the measure would
virtually force companies into establishing hiring quotas in order
to defend themselves against such suits.
   Hooks was among several hundred chanting demonstrators who
gathered outside the White House.
   White House congressional liaison Frederick McClure greeted them
at the gate, then escorted a small delegation onto the grounds,
where he accepted the demonstrators' written request for a meeting
with Bush.
   Hooks said the demonstrators represented ``civil rights
organizations from all over the nation, women's groups, hispanic
groups, from the Jewish community, from the black community and
from the liberal Republican groups.''
   ``The consequences of a veto is that President Bush will not be
living up to his promise of representing all the people, and that
gentler, kinder nation that we were looking for will not come to
pass,'' Hooks said.
   The legislation seeks to reverse a series of Supreme Court
rulings that sponsors of the measure claim have weakened
anti-discrimination protections in the workplace.

   A 21-year-old man has died of a head
injury from a collision with a teammate during a softball game.
   Robinson M. Leake IV died Thursday at Our Lady of the Lake
Regional Medical Center, a nursing supervisor said.
   Baton Rouge recreation officials said Leake was injured Tuesday
night in a game at a park near Zachary.
   ``They were going for a pop-up fly and (the teammate's) knee
must have hit Rob somewhere on his head and ... knocked him out,''
said Bob Crosby, director of recreation for the East Baton Rouge
Parish Recreation and Parks Commission.
   He said Leake was taken to a hospital, then taken to Our Lady
for emergency surgery when his head began to swell.
   Leake was a student at Louisiana Tech University in Ruston and a
member of the Louisiana Army National Guard.

   A part-time musician and teacher outshouted
the competition Friday to become the first town crier in this
historic northern England city in over 100 years.
   Brian McKusker, 35, outbellowed the four other finalists for the
$7,200-a-year job.
   York received 20 applications for the position, some from as far
afield as San Diego, Vancouver and Calgary.
   McKusker, who admits the salary is ``nothing to shout about,''
will begin work on Nov. 19 in a new gold-trimmed uniform. He will
work six days a week for three hours a day, shouting the news
headlines in the walled city's four squares.
   It is the first time since 1872 that an active town crier has
been on duty in York, 150 miles north of London.
   Records show the first crier was installed in 1272 and was a
continuous tradition until 1872 when the job became vacant and
remained unfilled, until Friday.

   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint

the top U.S. field commander and to consult with U.S. and Saudi
officials in Jiddah and Riyadh, the Pentagon said Friday.
   It will be Powell's second trip to Saudi Arabia since President
Bush ordered U.S. troops to the gulf area on Aug. 7 in response to
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The Pentagon provided no other details on the Saudi trip. Among
the unresolved issues in Operation Desert Shield is the
establishment of a command structure for the multinational forces
in and around Saudi Arabia. Also under consideration is a U.S.
policy for rotating ground, air and naval units to keep the forces
fresh.
   Powell also will stop in Brussels, Belgium, to attend a NATO
meeting and in Paris for talks with his French counterpart, Gen.
Maurice Schmitt, before returning to Washington on Oct. 25.

   A large bear with a penchant for trendy
California kiwi fruit sent a farmworker up a tree, then took a nap
in a walnut nursery while a throng of officials decided to let a
sleeping bear lie.
   Black bears are common in the Sierra Nevada and foothills, but
rarely venture into flat, inhabited areas such as southern Butte
County in the middle of the Sacramento Valley.
   ``In talking to the ranchers out there, it's the first time
anyone in that area has seen a bear in 20 or more years,'' said
Earl Young, Butte County rabies control director.
   Young didn't see the bear, but found evidence the animal was
snacking on kiwi fruit before it encountered humans.
   ``These animals enjoy the kiwi. Judging from the prints, the
bear appeared to be about 250 pounds,'' Young said.
   John Kusic said one of his farmworkers spotted the bear
Wednesday morning trotting through a kiwi vineyard.
   Officials from the Butte County Sheriff's Department, the county
Health Department, the state Department of Fish and Game and U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service were called in.
   The officials found the bear that afternoon curled up for a nap
in a walnut nursery nearby. After checking to see if the animal
appeared healthy, they decided to back off and leave him be.
   ``He hadn't really caused any damage. And the feeling at the
scene was that nobody wanted to see the bear hurt. ... Apparently
he was just asleep and wanted to be left alone to enjoy his nap,''
state Warden Terry Hodges said.
   Police said Friday the bear has not been spotted since
Wednesday.

   Jurors in the 2 Live Crew obscenity
trial listened intently today as the defense's first witness - a
Duke University professor - told them that vulgar rhymes and angry
expressions have long been used in black art and music.
   They were told that blacks have used such vulgar expressions to
express anger at black stereotypes and oppression for centuries.
   ``They embrace the stereotype over and over again that you can
have no reaction but to bust out laughing,'' said Henry Louis Gates
Jr., a black professor of English literature who is a literary
critic of black art and culture.
   Gates explained the centuries-old black art of ``signifying,'' a
verbal form of mockery that can be used to compliment or to insult
someone. He said the practice - exemplified by a needling jibe such
as ``your mama wears army boots'' - dates back to slavery times.
   ``It's a way the black people could fight against the oppression
of their white masters. They would mock each other to release anger
and tension,'' Gates said.
   ``Rap is an old tradition in Afro-American culture,'' Gates
said, noting that soul singers James Brown and Isaac Hayes often
spoke during their songs. He said the early form of scat singing
also was a predecessor of rap.
   Group leader Luther Campbell and members Chris ``Kid Ice''
Wongwon and Mark ``Brother Marquis'' Ross were arrested on
misdemeanor obscenity charges after a June 10 adults-only concert
in Hollywood.
   The three face up to a year in prison and $1,000 in fines, if
convicted.
   Campbell said Thursday that state prosecutors so far have failed
to prove that a concert by 2 Live Crew was any more obscene than
what is seen in nearby adult clubs and bookstores.
   ``We sing about oral sex, but the bookstore just down the street
from the (Broward County) Sheriff's Office has pictures of oral
sex,'' Campbell, leader of the Miami-based group, said during a
break in Thursday's trial.
   Referring to a nude dancing club in Fort Lauderdale, he added:
``Solid Gold is getting butt-naked and all you have to do is pay to
go there.''
   On Thursday, defense attorney Bruce Rogow grilled Broward
Sheriff's detective Eugene McCloud, a vice squad investigator.
Rogow demanded to know why bookstores could sell obscene magazines
and videotapes, and yet black rappers could not perform songs with
sexual and vulgar lyrics.
   ``Is it illegal to say, `F--- you, (Gov. Bob) Martinez?,'''
Rogow asked.
   ``No,'' McCloud responded.
   ``Is it illegal to say, `F--- you, (Broward Sheriff Nick)
Navarro?,''' he asked again.
   Again, McCloud responded, ``No.''
   Under the state's obscenity statute, the prosecutors must prove
that 2 Live Crew's concert as a whole - not just the lyrics -
lacked serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
   The disputed concert came four days after a federal judge in
Fort Lauderdale ruled the group's sexually explicit album, ``As
Nasty As They Wanna Be,'' was obscene. Songs on the million-selling
album refer to oral and anal sex and violence against women.
   Two weeks ago, record store owner Charles Freeman of Fort
Lauderdale was convicted of peddling obscenity for selling the
album.
   The band members' trial is set to continue through the weekend.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
emissary to Iraq met with President Bush today and stressed hopes
that the Persian Gulf crisis can be settled without war. Bush
agreed, but made clear there can be no compromise rewarding Iraq,
and that military force remains an alternative.
   ``I believe we should not rule out the possibilities of peaceful
solution util we have exhausted all options,'' Yevgeny Primakov
told reporters as he left the White House.
   Before the meeting, Bush vowed anew that Iraq's aggression and
takeover of Kuwait will ``not be rewarded by some compromise.''
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said he emphasized during the
session that ``the international focus is the use of sanctions and
diplomacy to accomplish the peaceful withdrawal of Iraq from
Kuwait, but that the international community is prepared to
consider alternative options.''
   Primakov, who visited Baghdad two weeks ago, conferred with Bush
in the Oval Office. The president was joined by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, and
Scowcroft's deputy, Robert Gates.
   The Soviet official said it would be ``assuming too much'' to
think that today's meeting had brought the crisis closer to an end.
   Primakov said he agreed with Bush that the nations of the world
should not relax their insistence on an Iraqi withdrawal from
Kuwait.
   ``One cannot allow a situation where actions which are
incompatible with a civilized society would be in order,'' Primakov
said through a translator.
   He said that Bush ``also believes and thinks that all the
objectives that have been set must be accomplished through
complying and implementing United Nations resolutions. In this, our
positions are the same.''
   Asked if he were hopeful that a peaceful settlement could be
achieved, Primakov replied, ``I cannot say that I have become less
moderately optimistic that I used to be before.''
   Primakov was asked earlier if he were bringing a message from
Saddam about possible steps to defuse the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``No message from Saddam Hussein because I am not a messenger,''
Primakov said. Asked if he were carrying a message from Gorbachev,
Primakov replied curtly: ``Best regards.''
   Bush turned aside questions about the session. However, in a
meeting earlier with Italian-American leaders, Bush said he sees no
chance for compromise in the gulf crisis, as has been suggested in
some diplomatic quarters.
   ``I am as determined as I was the day the first troop left, that
Saddam Hussein's aggression not be rewarded by some compromise, not
be rewarded by failing to get him totally out of Kuwait or restore
the legitimate rulers ... The bottom line is he can't prevail.''
   Primakov came to the White House with assurances of solid
Kremlin support for tougher international sanctions aimed at
forcing Iraq out of Kuwait.
   U.S. officials said Primakov stressed that Moscow wants to keep
working through the United Nations to reverse the Aug. 2 invasion
with political and diplomatic measures. Primakov stopped in Rome
and Paris this week on his way to Washington.
   Among the new steps under consideration are demanding
reparations from Iraq for what Baker calls ``the rape of Kuwait''
and possibly an international trial of President Saddam Hussein as
a war criminal.
   The U.N. Security Council has banned virtually all trade with
Iraq, but after more than two months of occupying Kuwait the Iraqi
leader has not bowed to the pressure.
   Primakov gave no indication in his talks with Italian and French
officials, or in his meeting Thursday with Baker, that Gorbachev
has an alternative formula to end the Persian Gulf standoff, the
U.S. officials said before today's White House meeting.
   Primakov presented nothing new to Baker and Dennis B. Ross, head
of the State Department's policy planning staff, ``nothing they had
not heard before,'' said an official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``I haven't heard about an Iraqi plan or a Gorbachev plan,'' the
official told The Associated Press. ``There is nothing here that
sent people down the aisles saying this is something new.''
   The official referred to published reports that Primakov was
carrying a Gorbachev plan or one from Baghdad, where he met with
Iraqi leaders two weeks ago.
   After seeing Baker on Thursday, the Soviet envoy ruled out any
deal with Saddam that would reward the Iraqi leader for pulling
troops out of Kuwait.
   ``We should look for some possibilities to avoid, from my point
of view, the military clashes, but not reward Iraq, of course, with
its actions,'' Primakov said in halting English before climbing
into a waiting black limousine.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Liberal Democratic Party, derided by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher just last week as a ``dead parrot,'' is
back in business after a stunning election upset over the
Conservative Party.
   ``The parrot has twitched,'' Conservative Party Chairman Kenneth
Baker said Friday of the Liberal Democrats' victory in a special
parliamentary election in the prosperous south England town of
Eastbourne.
   The town has been Tory territory for more than 70 years.
   ``Some dead parrot... It's given her a nasty nip,'' said the
Liberal Democrats' leader, Paddy Ashdown.
   The centrist party, whose most famous member is John Cleese of
``Monty Python'' fame, posted a huge 20.5 percent swing against the
government in Thursday's election to replace a Tory legislator
killed by the IRA.
   The Conservatives were burdened by voters' unhappiness over high
interest rates, health and welfare cuts and an unpopular new tax.
   And their candidate didn't help himself by claiming that a vote
for the opposition was a vote for the Irish Republican Army.
   The defeat ranked among the biggest electoral humiliations of
Mrs. Thatcher's 11 years in office and may force her to rethink any
plans to call an election next year. She has until late 1992 to
call elections.
   For the Liberal Democrats, Eastbourne was pure gold:
resuscitation for a party in such bad shape that after four years
of splits, name changes, name calling and new emblems, most voters
don't know its name.
   Sweeter still, the victory came a week after Mrs. Thatcher got
the big laugh at her party's annual conference by borrowing a Monty
Python sketch to spoof the Liberal Democrats' latest emblem, a
yellow bird in full flight.
   ``This is an ex-parrot,'' Mrs. Thatcher intoned.
   ``It is not merely stunned. It has ceased to be, expired and
gone to meet its maker ... It has rung down the curtain and joined
the choir invisible. This is a late parrot.''
   And that led her neatly into the wonders of Thatcherism. ``And
now for something completely different...''
   The joking didn't seem so funny on Friday, when Eastbourne's
near 17,000-vote Tory majority crumbled to a 4,500-vote Liberal
Democrat win.
   ``It shows the Liberal Democrats are now establishing themselves
as a decisive force in the defeat of Thatcherism,'' Ashdown
declared.
   With 20 members in the 650-seat House of Commons, where the
Conservatives have 100 seats more than Labor, the Liberal Democrats
have been more of a derisive force in recent years. Support slipped
from about 20 percent in the 1987 election to 10 percent in opinion
polls now, compared with 47 percent for Labor and 37 percent for
the Conservatives.
   The Liberal Democrats fought the 1987 national election in an
alliance with the Social Democratic Party, led by former Labor
Foreign Secretary David Owen.
   Owen then spurned Ashdown and soldiered on with the remainder of
his party until the final humiliation: his party's candidate
finished behind the nominee of Screaming Lord Sutch's Monster
Raving Loony Party in the town of Bootle's by-election in the
spring.
   Meanwhile, the merged centrists tried one name after another to
accommodate social democratic and liberal sensitivities.
   A Gallup poll during the Liberal Democrats' conference last
month - when they adopted the bird - showed that 75 percent of
voters didn't know the party's name. And 80 percent of the 900
people questioned had no idea what the party stands for.
   The centrists, generally an earnest lot who are hot on issues at
the neighborhood and town levels, traditionally do well in local
elections.
   It wasn't all bad news for the Tories. Observers noted that a
revival of the center would, as in the past two general elections,
help the Conservatives by splitting the left-of-center vote.

but you can freely sing - if you'll pardon the expression - about
the joys of violating a woman's body in monstrous detail on
commercial recordings because it's a constitutional right,'' Sills
told about 1,000 people Thursday night at the 45th annual Alfred E.
Smith Memorial Dinner.
   The $500-a-plate dinner, run by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of New York, benefits health care causes.
   ``We do not need self-appointed vigilantes to insist upon
legislating artistic work, because you can't legislate taste,'' Ms.
Sills said. ``You can't criminalize imagination. You shouldn't
throw artists in jail.''
   Instead, she said, higher moral standards are needed.
   ``Now I'm all for artistic freedom - I used to be a performing
artist myself - but we as a society are growing dangerously out of
touch with our conscience,'' she said.
   Ms. Sills spoke at the Waldorf-Astoria at what has been called
the city's most important non-political political event. Among
guests were Mayor David Dinkins, former Mayor Ed Koch and
syndicated columnist William F. Buckley.
   Ms. Sills, 61, is a soprano who directed the New York City Opera
from 1979 to 1989 after retiring from the stage.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Barry Levinson, one of the most bankable of
directors with credits like ``Rain Man'' and ``Good Morning,
Vietnam,'' says movie makers' power over the world outside
Hollywood is overrated.
   ``I don't think filmmakers can influence or affect anything,''
he said during a recent interview while promoting his newest movie,
``Avalon.''
   ``I think sometimes we can make a ripple,'' Levinson said,
``but, I mean, we're just a teaspoon in the ocean.''
   Levinson got his break in Hollywood writing comedy scripts for
``The Tim Conway Show'' and ``The Carol Burnett Show'' 20 years
ago. He takes a rather dim view of television, but says it's hard
to overstate its influence.
   ``I don't think it's the culprit; it's not the only thing that's
wrong with our society,'' he said.
   ``But if you had to ask me what was one of the (main) things
that has been influential over the last half of the 20th century,
I'd have to say it's television. I don't think we know its
ramifications - psychologically, sociologically - but it's
frightening.''
   Playing in limited release, Levinson's autobiographical
``Avalon'' collected $201,574 for a spectacular per-screen average
of $28,796, according to figures released Monday by Exhibitor
Relations Co. Inc. ``Avalon'' opened nationwide on Friday.

   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Sportscaster Red Barber and National
Public Radio host Bob Edwards finally spoke face to face Friday
after nearly 10 years of conversing over the phone.
   Millions of listeners hear Barber in his distinctive Florida
drawl talk by telephone with Edwards at 7:35 every Friday morning
on the ``Morning Edition'' program.
   But the pair has never done a broadcast in person. Edwards was
in Florida's capital, which is Barber's home, for a fund-raiser to
benefit the NPR affiliate WFSU.
   ``This will be a little easier for me because I'm a little hard
of hearing, and now I can read your lips,'' said Barber, 82.
   ``And I'm making no campaign promises,'' joked Edwards.
   The 3{-minute show, which began in 1981, is by far the most
popular segment on NPR, generating thousands of telephone calls and
letters, Edwards said.
   ``I think it's because Red is a real person, he's not plastic,''
he said. ``He's the kind of person you want to meet and talk with
over the fence in the back yard.''
   Barber has been involved in broadcasting for 60 years, starting
with the Cincinnati Reds. He is best known as the voice of the
Brooklyn Dodgers from 1939 to 1953 and his trademark ``Oh Doctor!''
marking big plays.

   LONDON (AP) - Novelist Frederick Forsyth was divorced by his
actress wife, Carrie, on Friday on grounds they have lived apart
for two years.
   Forsyth, 52-year-old author of the best-sellers, ``The Day of
the Jackal,'' ``The Dogs of War'' and ``The Odessa File,'' did not
contest the divorce.
   The couple, who had been married for 17 years, have two
children, Frederick, 13, and Shane, 11.
   The divorce was granted by E.J. Holman, sitting as an assistant
recorder in the London Divorce Court. Afterwards, Mrs. Forsyth
attended a short hearing in private to deal with arrangements for
the children, which were not disclosed.

<HEAD>Hard Times for Soviet Soldiers in United Germany</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The once-mighty Red army has fallen on hard times
in the new Germany. Its military mission is over, its presence is
resented by many Germans, and its soldiers are deserting in droves
to avoid going home.
   Once they were crack front-line troops in the Cold War. Now the
Soviet soldiers stationed in what was East Germany find themselves
a relic of a bygone era.
   Final withdrawal of the 600,000 troops and dependents is not
scheduled until 1994. Already, the strain is showing.
   The Soviet forces are a heavy financial burden for newly unified
Germany, now saddled with enormous costs of the merger.
   The Bonn government agreed to pay upwards of $800 million this
year to maintain the Soviets. Germany will also pay billions to
retrain and build new housing for the troops.
   ``A nightmare'' is how Heinrich Vogel, head of the Federal
Institute for Soviet and International Studies, describes the
problems associated with the presence of the Soviet troops.
   The soldiers face uncertain futures in the Soviet Union, where
jobs, housing, and food are scarce. The temptation is great to stay
in newly reunited Germany, where life is easier and consumer goods
abundant.
   Some Soviet soldiers are resigned to going home, but want to buy
as much as possible to take with them.
   The entry to the Soviet base at Wuensdorf, south of Berlin, is a
cross between a used-car lot and a central Asian bazaar. Soldiers
are snapping up everything from leather coats to used BMWs.
   Others are deserting to try to stay in Germany. The Interior
Ministry said Friday that 53 Soviet soldiers had registered for
asylum in the last two months. The figure is almost certainly
higher, as it takes weeks to register the cases.
   Authorities in Berlin said 10 Soviet soldiers a day were seeking
asylum before unity on Oct. 3. The number fell when the Soviet
military introduced harsher punishment for deserters - the maximum
penalty is death.
   A German Foreign Ministry spokesman acknowledges the problem is
``delicate.'' The Bonn government, he said, is trying to work with
the Soviet government on the desertion problem.
   German government officials do not know how many Soviet troops
will try to avoid returning home, but they agree that unity and
Germany's liberal asylum laws make it easier to consider staying.
   Desertion was almost impossible while the Berlin Wall stood.
East German police were required by treaty to turn deserters over
to the Soviet military.
   Once the wall fell, a Soviet soldier could cross into West
Germany and apply for asylum.
   Police in unified Germany are not required to return deserters
to Soviets military authorities, who have now stepped up patrols to
curb desertions.
   Although there is resentment of the Soviet presence, there is
sympathy for the plight of individual soldiers. A week ago, Soviet
military authorities were unnerved by an outpouring of civic
support in Weimar for Oleg Luchak, a young Soviet deserter on
trial.
   A group of young Germans sheltered the family and lawyer of the
young soldier, who said he left his unit because of ``extreme
necessity.'' Townspeople lit candles on a fence in front of the
courtroom.
   A week later, the Soviets reversed a longstanding policy of no
fraternizing between the soldiers and local residents. They invited
the town to visit the base. A similar invitation has been extended
to the residents of Franfkurt an der Oder, a town on the Polish
border.
   Even before the new ``open door'' policy, the barrier between
Germans and Soviet soldiers had begun to collapse. Soviet soldiers
began receiving German currency on July 1.
   But they found themselves second-class citizens in a land of
plenty. A private's monthly wage is only $16.
   Violence, theft and corruption are on the rise among troops
desperate for money.
   Police report that hard-pressed Soviet soldiers are selling
weapons including machine guns and grenades as well as uniforms.
One officer reportedly rented out the men from his unit to help on
a local collective farm.

<TEXT>
   An array of imported food can be seen in
Baghdad grocery stores these days, despite the United Nations trade
embargo imposed on Iraq in retaliation for its invasion of Kuwait.
   But many of the items on store shelves are from what Iraqis call
their 19th province - Kuwait, which was stripped of consumer goods
after Iraq took over on Aug. 2.
   Buyers in Baghdad can find mackerel from China, sardines, tuna
and pineapples from Asia, olives from Morocco, butter cookies from
Denmark and grape juice from Austria. They can even get American
hot sauce.
   But whether they can afford the items is another question.
Prices are rising beyond the reach of the common man in this city
of 4.5 million.
   At Baghdad's popular riverside fish restaurants almost all the
tables are full, and diners have a choice of roast chicken, baked
fish or beef. But a chicken lunch in an average restaurant costs
$15.
   Motorists at Baghdad's open market pack their cars with whatever
food is available.
   ``Before, I used to buy food for the whole month; now I buy all
the food I can get,'' a taxi driver said.
   The basics - wheat, milk, sugar and tea - are not available and
``this is hurting many average Iraqis,'' said a European diplomat,
who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The government has rationed these items along with cooking oil,
soap, detergent and rice.
   ``The milk situation is pretty grim,'' said an Iraqi official,
who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He would not give any figures, but said: ``I would say that
pretty soon, we will be in a serious crisis.''
   ``Our assessment is that without any external help, Iraqis can
last four to five months,'' said an Asian diplomat. ``And by that
time, their winter wheat crops will be ready.''
   He noted that Iraqi farmland is very fertile and abundantly
irrigated by rivers.
   ``Like any other developing society, farming had been neglected
in Iraq, but now it appears that the government is serious,'' he
said.
   Before the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait brought on the U.N.
embargo, Iraq had imported most of its food.
   Now, in an effort to fight the blockade, the government has
asked farmers to triple wheat cultivation by devoting all farmland
into the crop.
   Financial incentives have been offered and orders issued that no
land should go to waste.
   ``We expect big response and big success,'' said Deputy Prime
Minister Sadoun Hamadi.
   ``These objectives center on the main issue of self-sufficiency
in grains, at least at a minimum level, although some say that we
are able to go beyond that,'' Hamadi said.
   State television runs programs on how to raise poultry, an Iraqi
staple, and cultivate the ubiquitous date palm.
   ``There is tremendous enthusiasm,'' said Jihada Samran Abedhi, a
50-year-old mother of seven children, who heads a collective farm
at Sholei, 16 miles west of Baghdad.
   About 200 men and women work on the farm.
   ``We are planting wheat on 80 percent of our land this season,''
she told a group of reporters. ``We are also planting barley, beans
and potatoes.''
   ``We know about efforts by imperialist America to starve us, but
this is not going to work,'' Mrs. Abedhi said as she drove off to
instruct a group of farmers.
   Availability of fertilizers is uncertain, and spare parts and
lubricants for agricultural equipment, as well as imported seed,
may run out because of the trade embargo, diplomats said.
   ``If the government succeeds in promoting agriculture the way it
is doing now, it will suddenly be a big plus point in fighting the
blockade,'' said the European diplomat.
   ``But then you just cannot survive on wheat,'' he said. ``They
need cooking oil, sugar and beans.''
   While there appear to be no critical food shortages yet, the
U.N. blockade is reportedly hitting Iraqi industry hard.
   ``At least 60 percent of the industry is either closed or about
to close down,'' the Asian diplomat said. ``Many are running below
25 percent capacity.
   ``Time will come when Iraqis will need cement, steel or plastic.
Where are they going to get it from?''

<HEAD>Bush Says Iraq Will Not Be Rewarded With Compromise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush promised Friday that Iraq's
aggression will ``not be rewarded by some compromise'' and said
that American forces in the Persian Gulf are ready for military
action if necessary.
   Bush met for more than an hour with senior Soviet official
Yevgeny M. Primakov, who was sent to Iraq two weeks ago by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in search of a political settlement.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush
emphasized that ``the international community is prepared to
consider alternative options'' if sanctions and diplomacy fail to
drive Iraq's army out of Kuwait.
   Fitzwater said, ``The president's resolve was firm and firmly
expressed.''
   The United States has provided the bulk of troops - more than
200,000 - and naval units to defend Saudi Arabia and the gulf. The
Soviet Union, while solidly backing economic pressures against
Iraq, has made only a minimal contribution to the multinational
force in the gulf.
   Emerging from the meeting, Primakov expressed hopes for a
peaceful outcome but said the Soviet Union strongly supports United
Nations resolutions and sanctions against Iraq.
   ``I believe we should not rule out the possibilities of a
peaceful solution until we have exhausted all options,'' the Soviet
official told reporters in the White House driveway.
   At the same time, he said Iraq's aggression was unacceptable.
``One cannot allow a situation where actions which are incompatible
with the civilized society would be applauded,'' he said.
   Primakov said he was not carrying any message from Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein ``because I am not a messenger.''
Similarly, White House officials said there were no new proposals.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, asked if there
were any signs that Iraq was willing to compromise, said, ``Not
that I'm aware of.''
   Even before Primakov arrived at the White House, Bush emphasized
U.S. unwillingness to make any concessions to Saddam.
   ``I'm determined as I was the day that the first troop left that
Saddam Hussein's aggression not be rewarded by some compromise,''
the president said. ``Not be rewarded by our failing to get him
totally out of Kuwait or restore the legitimate rulers.''
   In remarks to Italian-American leaders, Bush said, ``the bottom
line is, he can't prevail.''
   In his private talks with Primakov, Bush said U.S.-Soviet
cooperation has been an important factor in isolating Saddam.
   Fitzwater said Bush told Primakov ``there is no interest, either
on the part of the United States or the international community,
for any partial solution to the blatant aggression that Iraq has
perpetrated against Kuwait.''
   Fitzwater said Bush had told Gorbachev, at their September
summit in Helsinki, that U.S. forces in the gulf ``are available
should their use be necessary, and that point was made again
today.''
   Primakov outlined his personal impressions of Iraqi leaders,
whom he knows well, and discussed the situation in the gulf and the
prospects for a diplomatic solution. Fitzwater did not characterize
Primakov's remarks.
   The Soviet official replied guardedly when reporters asked if he
were optimistic about chances for a peaceful settlement. ``I cannot
say that I have become less moderately optimistic than I used to be
before,'' Primakov said.
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater said there was an urgent need for steps to
be taken at the U.N. to help the handful of American officials who
are keeping the U.S. embassy in Kuwait open in defiance of Iraqi
occupying forces.
   ``Clearly some kind of action will need to be taken in the not
too distant future to either resupply the embassy or to remove or
otherwise ensure the safety of our citizens there,'' he said. ``So
it is an imminent question that we need to deal with, and we think
the U.N. is the appropriate forum to do that.''

into a building where his opponent, Neil Hartigan, has his office.
   State police were investigating the incidents, which occurred
while Democrat Hartigan and Republican Edgar participated in a
televised debate at the state Capitol Thursday night.
   A shot was fired into a glass-fronted building housing the
office of Hartigan, who is Illinois attorney general. State police
were summoned.
   An hour or so later, an anonymous caller phoned Gov. James R.
Thompson's mansion and told executive security personnel, ``You can
tell Jim Edgar that he'll get trouble from us too.''
   Edgar is the secretary of state.

<HEAD>Richards Ad Attacks Williams' Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrat Ann Richards is using Republican
Clayton Williams' own words in a new attack ad aimed at her
opponent in the Texas governor's race.
   The ad repeats Williams' controversial joke about rape, plus a
more recent comment that he hoped Richards, a recovering alcoholic,
``didn't go back to drinking again.''
   The commercial ends with an announcer asking, ``Governor
Williams?''
   The commercial is ``evil and malicious,'' said Gordon Hensley, a
spokesman for the GOP candidate.
   ``The more the people see of him, the better for us,'' said
Richards consultant Glenn Smith.
   The most controversial of Williams' remarks was a joke about
rape, made last March, when he likened bad weather to rape and said
if it were inevitable ``relax and enjoy it.''
   Williams quickly apologized, saying he didn't mean to offend
anyone.

   Jon Grunseth told about 100 cheering
supporters Friday that he's staying in the governor's race. He says
a lie detector test has shown him innocent of allegations that he
swam nude with teen-age girls.
   ``I'm in until November sixth,'' Grunseth, an
Independent-Republican, told a news conference on the state Capitol
steps.
   The lie detector test, Grunseth said, ``exonerates me on every
charge leveled at me. But I know the media and I know you will have
doubts. That's your job,'' he said.
   Grunseth has accused Gov. Rudy Perpich and his supporters of
being behind the allegations. The governor, his aides and family
members also should take lie detector tests, said Grunseth.
   Two young women alleged that he swam nude with four teen-age
girls at a 1981 party, tried to touch the breast of one of them and
served beer to minors.

<HEAD>Martinez Charges Chiles-MacKay Will Raise Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez said Friday that
Democratic foes Lawton Chiles and Kenneth ``Buddy'' MacKay are
liberal ``Washington insiders'' out to raise taxes.
   Chiles has indicated he might revive the state tax on services
next year.
   Martinez focused on that point before the Florida Association of
Realtors convention.
   Martinez promoted the service tax, then repealed it, three years
ago. Real estate commissions were exempt from the services tax for
sales of homestead properties.
   Chiles said he wouldn't rule out raising taxes and would take a
look on how to make a services tax fairer than the repealed
version.
   Martinez has signed the biggest tax increases in Florida
history. His popularity plummeted after the services tax
controversy.
   Chiles told the convention that Martinez was hardly a
tax-cutter.
   ``I want to find out what the hell we've done with the $3.8
billion that we've raised over the last four years,'' Chiles said.
   The two have a debate scheduled for Oct. 30.

<HEAD>Ferry Operator, Seven Men Acquitted of Manslaughter in Ferry
Disaster</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday acquitted a company and seven of
its former employees of manslaughter charges in the sinking of a
ferry off the coast of Belgium three years ago.
   The disaster on the Herald of Free Enterprise left 193 people
dead.
   The justice, Sir Michael John Turner, told the jury to find P
and O European Ferries (Dover) Ltd., three former directors and two
former seamen not guilty on the trial's 27th day. He said the
preosecution had failed to prove manslaughter.
   He also ordered the jury to acquit two other former seamen when
prosecutors said they would drop their case against them.
   If convicted, the company would have faced an unlimited fine and
the seven men could have received a maximum sentence of life
imprisonment.
   Relatives of the victims fought for more than three years to
bring what was believed to be only the second charge of corporate
manslaughter against a company. In the first case, a construction
company was acquitted in 1965.
   In explaining the acquittal, the judge told jurors the
``evidence already called is such that you, properly directed,
could not properly convict the company and the five most senior
defendants.''
   The Herald of Free Enterprise, a car and passenger ferry,
overturned off the Belgian port of Zeebrugge carrying 454
passengers and 80 crew members on March 6, 1987.
   Headed for the southern English port of Dover, it had set sail
just six minutes earlier with its bow doors open.
   All the defendants had denied the manslaughter charge. Only one
person who died in the sinking of the ferry was named in the test
case to simplify the charges.
   The defendants were accused of unlawfully killing Alison
Gaillard, 27, a passenger who was on a day trip aboard the ferry.
   Besides the company, the defendants were the chief marine
superintendent Jeffrey Develin, deputy chief marine superintendent
John Alcindor, technical director Wallace Ayres, senior master John
Kirby, and master of the Herald David Lewry.
   Chief officer Leslie Sabel and assistant boatswain Mark Stanley
were the two defendants whose cases were dropped by prosecutors.
They said it was not in the public interest to proceed.
   Stanley, the man responsible for closing the bow doors, was
asleep in his cabin, and Sabel, the officer responsible for
ensuring they were closed, has admitted he did not fulfill his
duty.
   Turner said there was no direct evidence that a reasonable
person occupying the position of any of the five senior defendants
would have perceived the risk as obvious or serious.
   Families of the victims were ``very disappointed and saddened''
by the outcome, said Maurice de Rohan, chairman of the Herald
Families Association and the father of Mrs. Gaillard.
   But he said, ``the fact that it came to court and that corporate
responsibility was accepted as a possible verdict was important.
Society progresses in steps. We believe that we have progressed.''
   The company has settled piecemeal most of the claims by
survivors and relatives.
   Another judge who headed a 1987 inquiry into the disaster blamed
the tragedy on sloppy management at the company, formerly called
Townsend Thoresen, but he ruled that no statutory offense had been
committed by the ferry operator.
   An inquest earlier had returned a verdict of unlawful killing.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and his main
political rival, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, are deadlocked
over the economic and political future of the Soviet Union.
   After Yeltsin quit the Communist Party last July, Gorbachev
sought to compromise with him over how to shift the country from a
centrally planned to a market-driven economy.
   Those efforts broke down a month ago, and the dispute
intensified on Tuesday after Gorbachev disclosed his latest reform
package.
   Gorbachev's plan, overwhelming approved Friday by the
legislature, stops far short of the more radical one adopted last
month by the Russian Federation parliament, which Yeltsin heads as
president of the republic.
   Thus Gorbachev is trying to carry out moderate reform against
opposition from the largest of the 15 Soviet republics. Russia has
more than half the Soviet Union's population and the lion's share
of its natural resources, including oil, coal, gas, timber, gold
and diamonds.
   Gorbachev took Yeltsin to task on Friday in a speech to
lawmakers.
   ``Comrade Yeltsin's assertions are strange, to say the least,''
he said. ``I'm under the impression that the Russian leadership is
afraid of difficulties and wants to pass on responsibility for
possible difficulties and consequences .... onto central organs of
power.''
   Yeltsin, for his part, derided Gorbachev's program hours after
it was disclosed on Tuesday, calling it ``another endeavor ... to
perpetuate the system hated by the people.
   Yeltsin predicted ``it will take less than six months to realize
that the chosen road is another blunder,'' adding: ``If we
procrastinate and put off further, there will be nothing to reform
because the economy will simply fall to pieces.''
   The government seems already in pieces, and that will hamper any
reforms Gorbachev puts forward, says Ed Hewett, an economist at the
Brookings Institution in Washington.
   ``What is important is confidence in the government, and that is
falling,'' he said. ``Even if you produced a very detailed plan
that was very radical, but gave it to a government that has a
reputation of doing nothing, little could happen.''
   Beyond the question of confidence and rivalry, the heart of the
dispute between Gorbachev and Yeltsin concerns the political
structure of the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev seeks in his program to preserve ``the integrity of
the union as a federation.''
   Yeltsin says the republics should take control of their own
economies, then negotiate new forms of cooperation among
themselves, not unlike the East European nations that broke from
Moscow last year.
   Besides a rebellious Russia, Gorbachev faces a growing
separatist movement in the second-most populist republic, the
Ukraine.
   Nearly all of the Soviet republics have declared some form of
economic and political sovereignty, including the three Baltic
republics, which have declared outright independence.
   Whether or not Gorbachev the reformer believes in Yeltsin's
radical prescription, Gorbachev the politician is chained to a
top-heavy government bureaucracy that perpetuates central rule.
   The normally tame state news agency Tass on Thursday endorsed
the plan supported by Yeltsin. It is named after its principal
author, economist Stanislav Shatalin.
   ``Gorbachev is unwilling to consider radically breaking the
managerial structures amid increasing political instability,'' an
inevitable result of Yeltsin's plan, the news agency said.
   But, Tass said, the plan ``is possibly the only form of surgery
that can help the ailing Soviet economy recover.''
   Gorbachev's defenders - who include many reformist economists -
said his program represented the speediest possible path to doing
away with the heavily centralized system, which has produced
consumer shortages and a technologically moribund society.
   Abel Aganbegyan, a pioneer of Soviet reform, told lawmakers
Wednesday that Yeltsin was motivated by ambition and not economics.
   ``He made a political speech and would have spoken this way
regardless of what we had proposed,'' Aganbegyan said.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda, one of the most traditionalist
publications, defended Gorbachev, saying the nation has inherited
``a pitiful legacy'' from the central planning system.
   Pravda praised a number of Gorbachev's proposed steps that would
have seemed politically impossible a year ago, but are now being
criticized by Yeltsin and others as half-way measures. They
include:
   -Laying ``the foundations for a voluntary unification of
sovereign republics within the framework of a federative and strong
union.''
   -Establishing ``an internally convertible ruble'' to ``open up
broad opportunities for the influx of foreign investments ... which
the country badly needs.'' A convertible currency is one that can
be exchanged for other monies on the open market.
   -Creating a central bank, similar to the U.S. Federal Reserve,
to regulate credit rates and monetary supply - bold new steps in a
Soviet economy where credit has been all but unavailable and the
government has printed rubles to meet its spending needs.
   -``Energetic measures ... for denationalizing and demonopolizing
the economy, for promoting entrepreneurship and elements of
competition.''
   But those proposals don't meet the demands of Russia and other
republics. If trends continue, the central government could lose
authority, and it would fall to the republics to reconstitute the
nation.

<HEAD>Washington Mayor Won't Seek Retrial In Drug Possession Conviction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry's attorney on Friday
withdrew his request for a retrial on the mayor's misdemeanor
cocaine possession conviction.
   ``I have spoken with my client, and he has decided to withdraw
that motion for a mistrial,'' defense lawyer L. Kenneth Mundy told
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson during a
pre-sentencing hearing.
   Barry, scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 26, faces up to a year in
prison and a maximum fine of $100,000. He did not attend Friday's
court session.
   Law enforcement officials had said U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens
might consider retrying the mayor on a dozen charges the jury could
not resolve if Barry pushed ahead with his request for another
trial. Stephens had said earlier that he would not conduct another
trial.
   Mundy said the decision to withdraw the request was reached
before the government filed papers opposing the motion.
   In the 10-minute hearing Friday, Mundy asked that the sentencing
be delayed because he hadn't had enough time to respond to a
pre-sentencing report prepared by the mayor's parole officer.
   ``We disagree wholeheartedly with the pre-sentencing report,''
Mundy said.
   The report was not released in open court, but Mundy said his
chief objection was its apparent conclusion that Barry has neither
shown remorse nor taken responsibility for his actions by admitting
to prior drug use.
   ``There is an ongoing probe of Mr. Barry, and some of the
questions being asked (of witnesses) involve drug use by Mr.
Barry,'' Mundy said. ``It would have been very perilous for him to
make any pre-sentencing statement to the parole officer until we
know that there will be no other trial.''
   The judge denied the request to delay sentencing.
   Mundy originally asked for a retrial because he said some of the
jurors were compromised when they witnessed a drug sting operation
at the hotel where they were sequestered.
   A jury convicted Barry on Aug. 10 of one misdemeanor cocaine
possession count, acquitted him of another and deadlocked on a
dozen other counts, including a charge resulting from his Jan. 18
arrest in an FBI sting operation at a downtown Washington hotel.
   Barry, said in advance of his trial that he would not seek
re-election, but announced his candidacy for the city council after
the conclusion of his trial.

<HEAD>Mideast Crisis, Oil Crunch, Signal Harder Times For Farmers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mideast crisis and the oil crunch are
helping set the stage for some rougher times ahead for farmers, an
Agriculture Department report said Friday.
   Net cash income of farmers - the difference between grosscash
income and cash expenses - is still expected to be at a record
level in 1990, probably in the range of $59 billion to $63 billion.
   That is unchanged from previous forecasts by the department's
Economic Research Service.
   ``However, abundant crops, lackluster commodity prices, the oil
shock and a weaker global economic outlook are putting downward
pressure on farmers' receipts and boosting expenses for this
quarter and into next year,'' the report said.
   Farmers have ``undergone a major financial restructuring'' since
the previous oil shock and recession in the early 1980s, it said.
Total farm debt has dropped about one-third from the 1983 peak of
$193 billion.
   ``With a lighter debt burden and record income this year, U.S.
farmers are in a stronger position to withstand a drop in income,''
the report said.
   The agency did not make a prediction of 1991 farm income,
however. That forecast is expected to be announced during the
department's annual outlook conference here Nov. 27-29.

<TEXT>
   Amnesty International on Friday called on the
Lebanese government to launch an independent investigation into
reports Syrian forces executed at least 30 supporters of Gen.
Michel Aoun.
   The Lebanese government has denied that scores of soldiers loyal
to Aoun were massacred after surrendering to Syrian and Lebanese
forces who crushed his 11-month rebellion.
   President Elias Hrawi said Aoun ordered his troops to keep
fighting even after he had broadcast a surrender message and taken
refuge in the French embassy in Beirut on Oct. 13.
   Amnesty also called on Syrian authorities to investigate the
role of their troops in the incidents, which it alleged took place
during Aoun's defeat on Oct. 13-14.
   ``Although the full circumstances are not clear, the killings of
prisoners are said to have been carried out by Syrian troops in
retaliation for shootings of their soldiers by Aoun supporters,''
Amnesty said in an urgent appeal.
   Earlier this week, journalists in Beirut reported seeing a
number of corpses in the mortuary at Baabda Hospital in Beirut.
   Amnesty said it did not have any names of the victims, ``but
they are mostly reported to have been young men who were partially
stripped and had their hands tied behind their backs before being
shot in the head at close range.''
   The London-based human rights organization said it was concerned
about the safety of prisoners reportedly held by the Lebanese and
Syrian armies. Amnesty said some of the prisoners had reportedly
been taken from Lebanon to undisclosed places of imprisonment in
Syria.
   ``Amnesty International has previously received reports of
extrajudicial executions and torture of prisoners by Syrian forces
in Lebanon. Torture of prisoners is widespread in Syria,'' the
rights organization said.

   Twenty federal workers were arrested in front
of the White House Friday as they chanted ``Furlough Bush, tax the
rich,'' in a protest over the budget stalemate.
   The 20 members of the National Treasury Employees Union arrested
for demonstrating without a permit were among about 200 unionized
workers who rallied to protest the possibility of another
government shutdown.
   Over the last several weeks, the nation's 2.4 million federal
workers have faced furloughs and a government shutdown due to
Congress' and the Bush administration's inability to agree on a
deficit-reduction plan.
   The government did shut down over the three-day Columbus Day
weekend, but the impact was limited.
   House and Senate negotiators worked Friday to find a compromise
so another shutdown could be avoided, although the White House has
indicated it would back an emergency spending bill to keep the
government operating.
   ``It's come to this,'' Robert Tobias, the president of the
140,000-member union and the first to be arrested.
   ``This president and his predecessor have bashed the government
work force for more than 12 years and demeaned the valuable public
service it provides,'' Tobias said.
   Nearby, the American Federation of Government Employees held a
separate rally. A few dozen workers marched in front of the White
House chanting ``Read my lips, tax the rich.''

   United Press International and Reuters settled
a courtroom battle over photo services Friday, agreeing that
Reuters will continue to supply the American wire service with
foreign news photos but will cover the United States for itself.
   The legal settlement arose out of a 1984 agreement calling for
UPI to supply Reuters with photographs from the United States and
for Reuters to provide UPI with pictures from other countries. The
agreement was to run for 10 years beginning in 1985.
   Reuters later sued to void the agreement. UPI filed a
counterclaim saying Reuters had negotiated in bad faith.
   The news organization said the settlement does not call for any
compensation or monetary damages. UPI will have the option of
ending the exchange agreement by giving Reuters 30 days notice, it
said.
   Otherwise, the London-based agency will supply UPI with foreign
news photos withut charge until September 1992. After that, UPI
will have the option of subscribing to the Reuter service.
   Reuters will cover the United States with its own resources and
will not use UPI pictures, the announcement said. It said UPI will
sell its news photo service outside the United States without
involvement by Reuters.
   In a separate statement, UPI announced the establishment of the
Helen Thomas Unipresser Award, a $1,500 prize to be given annually
to a UPI journalist for ``achievements in gathering and reporting
the news with accuracy and fairness.''
   Winners of 12 new monthly Unipresser awards will compete for the
annual prize.
   Ms. Thomas, 70, joined UPI's Washington bureau in 1943 and has
covered the White House since 1960.

<HEAD>Battle For Provincial Afghan Capital Enters Sixth Day</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PESHAWAR, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslem guerrillas and government
troops battled a sixth day Friday for control of the provincial
capital of Zabul in southern Afghanistan, diplomatic and rebel
sources said.
   No casualty figures were known for either side.
   The guerrillas, known as mujahedeen or Islamic holy warriors,
have fired a steady barrage of mortars into the besieged garrison
overlooking Zabul's capital city of Qalat, about 220 miles
southwest of Kabul, the Afghan capital, the sources said.
   About 500 soldiers barricaded in the fort were blasting
resistance positions around Qalat with heavy aerial and artillery
attacks, according to the sources, who insisted on anonymity.
Afghan warplanes airlifted arms, ammunition and food to the troops,
they said.
   Hundreds of government soldiers surrendered to the mujahedeen
earlier this week, they said.
   On Oct. 4, the guerrillas captured Tarin Kot, the capital of
Uruzgan province which shares a border with Zabul. It was the
guerrillas' biggest success since Soviet troops withdrew from
Afghanistan in February 1989.
   Qalat is considered strategically more important because its
highway links eight Afghan provinces with Kabul.
   Diplomatic sources said Qalat's fall would not dramatically
alter the military balance between the guerrillas and forces loyal
to President Najibullah. But they said it would step up pressure on
Najibullah and his Soviet backers to reach a settlement to the
12-year-old war, the bloodiest and costliest conflict of the
decade.
   After the last of the 115,000 Soviet Red Army troops left
Afghanistan, Washington and Moscow intensified discussions on how
to end the war.
   The two superpowers have agreed that elections should be held to
decide the political future of the country, but they still disagree
on what role Najibullah would play in an interim government.
   Washington insists he must relinquish control over the military
and intelligence agencies, a demand that Najibullah and Moscow
reject.
   Moscow continues to send an estimated $500 million in weapons
and supplies to Kabul every month. The United States provides about
$300 million to the resistance annually.

   Iraq on Friday ordered all foreigners in occupied Kuwait to
report to authorities or face punishment, and announced it would
ration gasoline to save imported chemicals used in refining fuel.
   The gasoline rationing was the latest indication that
international trade sanctions against Iraq are having an impact.
The U.N. embargo was imposed two months ago to force Iraq out of
Kuwait, which it invaded Aug. 2.
   In New York, there was good news about oil. Prices were down
$2.00 a barrel in early afternoon trading on the New York
Mercantile Exchange to $34.70. Traders said prices eased after
conciliatory remarks by an Iraqi official.
   Iraq's deputy prime minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, said Thursday
in Amman, Jordan, that he thought both sides in the crisis were
reassessing their positions and that peace talks could be in the
offing.
   But in Washington, President Bush said he saw no chance for
compromise in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``I am as determined as I was the day the first troop left, that
Saddam Hussein's aggression not be rewarded by some compromise,''
Bush said in a meeting with Italian-American leaders.
   Bush met later with a Soviet envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, who said
he agreed that the world should not relax its insistence on an
unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
   ``One cannot allow a situation where actions that are
incompatible with a civilized society would be in order,'' Primakov
said after the meeting.
   A report published in Iraqi newspapers Friday said all
foreigners in Kuwait must register with local authorities before
Nov. 5.
   Those who fail to do so ``will be responsible before the law,
and their residency cards will be canceled,'' the report said.
   Under Iraqi law, foreigners found without residency cards are
punished with fines and imprisonment. The exceptions are citizens
from Arab Cooperation Council nations - Egypt, Jordan and Yemen.
   About 400,000 foreigners are believed in Kuwait, including 2,000
Westerners that the U.S. State Department says are hiding from
Iraqi soldiers.
   Hundreds more are held in Iraq, many at strategic sites to deter
attack by the multinational force. About 200,000 U.S. soldiers and
thousands from other nations are facing an estimated 430,000 Iraqi
troops in the region.
   Saddam's forces overran his southern neighbor in a dispute over
oil, land and money. With Kuwaiti oilfields, his share of world
reserves increased to 20 percent, second only to Saudi Arabia.
   Despite Iraq's vast reserves, the Oil Ministry announced Friday
gasoline rationing would begin next week. The U.N. embargo on Iraq
has squeezed Baghdad's supply of imported chemicals used in
refining oil.
   ``There is nothing to get worried about. ... The rationing is
just a precaution,'' said oil minister Issam Abdul-Rahim
al-Chalabi.``There is a lot of waste and by introducing the
rationing we are going to cut that waste.''
   Iraq is already rationing food staples such as milk, meat and
bread. Baghdad says there are shortages of all such products - and
many more.
   Car owners were ordered to pick up ration coupons at special
centers, although the minister did not say how much gasoline would
be allocated to each person or how long the rationing would last.
   Iraqis rushed to gasoline stations to stock up on gasoline
Friday and long lines formed outside gas stations.
   In Moscow, U.S. Defense Secretary Richard Cheney praised Soviet
cooperation in bringing diplomatic and economic pressure to bear on
Iraq and said ``we have not given up on that policy.''
   ``I have also made it clear ... that we have not ruled out other
options,'' said Cheney. He declined to speculate on possible U.S.
military steps.
   Cheney later traveled to Paris for three days of talks with the
French government on cooperation in the gulf crisis. France has
deployed 13,000 troops in the gulf, the second-largest Western
contingent after the United States.
   At the United Nations, the Security Council was considering a
resolution that would allow nations hurt by Iraq's invasion to seek
reparations from Baghdad's frozen assets abroad or against its
future oil earnings, diplomats said.
   The resolution also threatens Baghdad with unspecified ``further
enforcement measures,'' condemns Iraq's human rights violations in
Kuwait, and demands that Iraq release all Western hostages, the
diplomats said.
   No vote has yet been scheduled on the new resolution, they said.
It would be the 10th U.N. Security Council resolution condemning
Iraq.
   In other developments:
   -U.S. military officials in Saudi Arabia said there had been
2,500 interceptions, 240 boardings and 11 ``diversions'' of
commercial ships since the embargo against Baghdad was imposed.
   -Iraqi troops have placed explosives at oil fields, gas and
gasoline storage tanks as well as on bridges and viaducts in
Kuwait, according to Sheik Mishal Mohammed al-Sabah, a member of
the emirate's exiled ruling family.
   He was quoted as telling the Amsterdam newspaper De Telegraaf
that Iraq plans to blow up the facilities if its soldiers are
forced to withdraw.
   -Canada suspended operations at its embassy in Kuwait, Ottawa
said Friday. Saddam ordered embassies in Kuwait closed after he
annexed the emirate, and although only the British, French and U.S.
embassies now remain open, most nations still recognize Kuwait as a
separate nation.

   Everybody made a motion in Judge Milton
Wharton's courtroom.
   To the pop jazz beat of Sade's ``Smooth Operator,'' the judge,
jurors, attorneys and spectators stretched and swayed under the
guidance of an aerobics instructor in St. Clair County Circuit
Court Thursday.
   Wharton said he thinks the four-minute session, held during a
break in the trial of a personal injury lawsuit, helps keep people
alert.
   ``I think it's probably very valuable for the jurors,'' said
defense attorney Ann Hamilton, who participated in the aerobics.
``I think it helps keep them alert and attentive.''
   The aerobics break was intended to let jurors exercise more than
their civic duty.
   ``Sitting and listening can be very fatiguing,'' Wharton said.
``I saw no reason why exercise couldn't be beneficial to jurors who
are forced to be inactive for long periods of time.''
   The session Thursday was the third aerobics break during the
trial.
   ``OK you guys, spread out,'' aerobics instructor Jan Voellinger
said as the jury stood and stretched the length of one wall in the
small courtroom.
   They began with simple inhaling and exhaling, followed by neck
movements, looking to the right, center and left.
   The jurors then rolled their shoulders, punched the air and
bobbed their hips.
   ``It does help relieve a little tension,'' Hamilton told the
instructor. ``Can I do it during the closing arguments?''

   A school janitor on Friday denied he tried to
electrocute his boss because of a poor work evaluation.
   Richard Dale Langston pleaded innocent to a charge of attempted
murder and was returned to jail under $150,000 bond. A pre-trial
hearing was scheduled for Nov. 5.
   Langston, 26, of Lynwood, was arrested Oct. 12 after boarding a
jet at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport with a one-way ticket
to Hawaii.
   Prosecutors allege that Langston wired a chain link fence at
Kellogg Middle School in Seattle in an attempt to electrocute his
supervisor, Jeffrey Minnix.
   When Minnix touched the fence the morning of Oct. 9, showers of
sparks and smoke went off, said Dan Donohoe, a King County
prosecutor's office spokesman.
   Minnix was saved from serious injury because he still wore his
insulated motorcycle gloves, said Donohoe.
   A bare wire had been connected to the fence and plugged into a
portable school building, he said.

<HEAD>Baker Proposes New Pathways Of Superpower Cooperation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Friday proposed new cooperation with the Soviet Union to punish
nations that spread nuclear technology and to prevent regional
conflicts like the one that now threatens the Persian Gulf.
   ``Our search for points of mutual advantage has been
productive,'' Baker said in a major foreign policy speech. ``And
the search must continue - in new, ambitious ways. We now need to
pursue our hopes for the post-Cold War future.''
   Specifically, Baker called for cooperation ``in a regular,
almost day-by-day fashion,'' over a wide range of world problems,
including threats to the environment and uncertain access to vital
resources.
   ``These paths should cross at all levels - among persons,
groups, firms, institutions, cities and states,'' Baker said.
   Baker sounded a note of caution in an otherwise optimistic
assessment of the chances of moving beyond an easing of Cold War
tensions to cooperation on several levels.
   While hailing the growth of political democracy and the
decentralization of economic power in the Soviet Union, Baker said
the process was marked unfortunately by ``a deterioration in Soviet
life.''
   Standards of living are falling shortages are spreading and this
fall's harvest is rotting, Baker noted. Moreover, he said,
``freedom has unleashed age-old ethnic animosities that often shout
down the voices of tolerance.''
   Calling for understanding of the hardships ``a great people is
now enduring,'' Baker said ``this other, darker side of the Soviet
revolution concerns all of us.''
   However, he said he stands ``on the side of hope, hope for a new
Soviet Union built on democratic values.''
   Baker delivered the speech to The American Committee on
U.S.-Soviet Relations, a predominantly liberal private group that
urged cooperation with Moscow long before it became U.S. policy in
the last years of the Reagan administration.
   The Committee presented Baker with its George F. Kennan award,
named for the American diplomat who helped originate the post-World
War II policy of containing the Soviet Union and who later
advocated superpower cooperation.
   Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister, is the
co-recipient. He received his award earlier in the month in New
York.
   Baker's proposal for joint management of problems by Washington
and Moscow began on the military level since a central concern of
cooperation up to now has been how to cope with huge arsenals of
nuclear and conventional weapons.
   With new treaties to reduce arms nearing completion, Baker
called for exchanges with Moscow that would enable the United
States ``to learn more about the doctrine and strategy Soviet
leaders follow for use of those weapons.''
   In this vein, he said he would propose to Shevardnadze the
establishment of a U.S.-Soviet working group on ways the two sides
could deter attack and on the conversion of weapons to peaceful
uses.
   Turning to other topics, Baker said Iraq's ``brutal subjugation
of Kuwait leaves no doubt that even though the danger of
U.S.-Soviet confrontation has eased the world remains a dangerous
place.''
   Therefore, he said, the United States and the Soviet Union
should collaborate to try to anticipate regional conflicts and try
to resolve them before they lead to war.
   Also, Baker said, the incipient nuclear programs of Iraq and
North Korea ``are the best argument that our non-proliferation
effort needs a new impetus to cope with a new danger.''
   Consequently, he proposed the United States and the Soviet Union
agree that stopping the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons and missiles ``must be a central part of our agenda.''
   Baker said the Bush administration, therefore, would work with
the Soviet Union ``to explore sanctions'' imposed by the two
superpowers on nations that amass weapons of mass destruction.

   Rapper M.C. Hammer, whose hit ``U Can't
Touch This'' is the theme song of the Oakland Athletics and the
Cincinnati Reds, is buying a $5 million mansion in the Fremont
hills.
   Hammer's new 12.5-acre spread includes a V-shaped, one-story,
11,000-square-foot house with three master bedrooms, four
dishwashers, a media room, exercise room, recording studio and a
rehearsal hall for his chorus line.
   Two swimming pools, a reflecting pool and a nine-car garage
round out the new digs, which Fremont developer John Dyer described
as a ``Beverly Hills type of house.''
   Hammer, 27, is a former batboy for the A's. He hit the big time
with ``Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em,'' which sold 7 million copies.
   Hammer was raised in an East Oakland housing project and has
lived in Fremont for five years.
   Real estate agents tried to interest Hammer in mansions in the
exclusive suburbs of Atherton, Woodside and Blackhawk, but Hammer
considers Fremont home.
   ``We're not competing to have the biggest house in Fremont,''
said Hammer's older brother and manager, Louis Burrell. ``We just
count our blessings that we can build the house we dreamed of
having. This is not an egotistical statement or anything.''
   Hammer moved to Fremont after a stint in the Navy. Burrell, 30,
followed a year later, and their mother and two older brothers also
have moved here.
   Hammer has a recording studio and a practice studio in Fremont
for himself and his dancers, Burrell said Wednesday.
   The new house, described as a modern, Mediterranean style, will
replace Hammer's current 4,700-square-foot, four-bedroom home
valued at $750,000.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 88-year-old Spanish immigrant who waited more
than four decades to have his novel published is among nominees for
fiction in the 1990 National Book Awards.
   Felipe Alfau was one of five novelists nominated in the fiction
category. Others included two first-time novelists, Elena Castedo
and Jessica Hagedorn, and writers Charles Johnson and Joyce Carol
Oates.
   The nominations were announced Thursday by the National Book
Foundation, the non-profit organization that sponsors the annual
awards.
   In the non-fiction category, authors were nominated for works
about the Morgan banking family, former President Nixon, American
artist Jackson Pollock and Harold Ickes, a member of Franklin
Roosevelt's cabinet.
   Alfau wrote ``Chromos,'' published by Dalkey Archive Press, in
the 1940s. The book is about the experiences of a group of
Spaniards who move to Manhattan in the 1930s.
   A translator for a New York bank before retiring, Alfau also
wrote the 1936 novel ``Locos: A Comedy of Gestures'' and is the
author of a children's book.
   Castedo, who grew up in Chile and worked at odd jobs while
traveling around the world, was nominated for ``Paradise,''
published by Grove Weidenfeld. The book is about a Latin American
ghetto family.
   Hagedorn, a poet, playwright and commentator for public radio,
wrote ``Dogeaters,'' published by Pantheon Books. Her first novel
explores native tradition and popular American culture colliding in
the Philippines, Hagedorn's homeland.
   Johnson, a professor of English at the University of Washington,
was nominated for ``Middle Passage,'' published by Atheneum
Publishers, about a newly freed slave's voyage on a slave ship
bound for Africa in 1830.
   Oates, who won the National Book Award for fiction in 1970 for
her novel ``them,'' is nominated for ``Because It Is Bitter, and
Because It Is My Heart,'' published by E.P. Dutton-William Abrahams
Books. Her 20th novel is about a young white woman and a black
classmate brought together by a murderous street fight.
   Finalists in the non-fiction category include:
   -Ron Chernow for ``The House of Morgan: An American Banking
Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance,'' publisher Morgan Entrekin
Books-Atlantic Monthly Press.
   -Samuel G. Freedman for ``Small Victories: The Real World of a
Teacher, Her Students and Their High School,'' publisher
HarperCollins.
   -Roger Morris for ``Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an
American Politician,'' publisher Henry Holt.

<HEAD>Troops Clash With Palestinians in Gaza, At Least 10 Wounded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops shot and wounded at least 10
Palestinians in the occupied Gaza Strip Friday during a violent
protest of the killings on Jerusalem's Temple Mount earlier this
month.
   The clash was sparked by hundreds of worshipers in the Khan
Yunis refugee camp who marched out of mosques and paraded with
outlawed Palestinian flags chanting, ``Our blood for Al Aqsa, for
Saddam,'' Arab witnesses said.
   They were referring to the Al Aqsa mosque, on the Temple Mount,
where at least 19 Palestinians were killed on Oct. 8.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is viewed by most Palestinians as
a hero because he has tried to link the Israeli-Arab conflict to
the Gulf crisis.
   Arab reports said soldiers fired live ammunition, tear gas and
rubber bullets to disperse the Gaza demonstraters. Hospital
officials said 10 people were admitted with live bullet wounds and
over 50 were treated for injuries from rubber bullets.
   The army said its troops opened fire after coming under a hail
of stones and that 13 Palestinians were ``slightly'' wounded from
live ammunition and rubber bullets.
   In Jerusalem, meanwhile, police used water cannons to disperse
hundreds of Moslem youths who were protesting at being barred from
prayer services at Al Aqsa mosque for a second consecutive week.
   Police blocked all residents of the occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip from attending the services, as well as all men from
Jerusalem under age 45. As a result, fewer than 2,000 Moslems were
at the service.
   Before the 34-month Palestinian uprising, on a normal Friday,
the Moslem Sabbath, more than 10,000 Moslems would pray at Al Aqsa
and the Dome of the Rock mosques on the Temple Mount.
   Moslem religious leaders charged Friday that Israel was
interfering with their freedom of religion and demanded that all
Moslems be admitted to the Mount for worship.
   In a sermon at Al Aqsa, Moslem preacher Mohammed Hussein said
the police step was ``an action of hate.''
   ``I say to the occupation authorities that you are preventing
worshipers from getting into the house of God. This is not in the
religion of Moses or Jesus,'' Hussein said.
   The Temple Mount, known as Haram es-Sharif in Arabic, is one of
the holiest sites in both Islam and Judaism. The Oct. 8 clash, in
which 140 Palestinians were also wounded, was prompted when
Palestinians threw stones at Jews worshiping at the Western Wall
below.
   Jews revere the wall, also known as the Wailing Wall, as the
last remnant of their ancient temple. Palestinians said the stoning
began when rumors spread that Jewish zealots planned to march on
the Temple Mount.
   In the occupied territories, Moslems were blocked from attending
Friday prayers by army curfews in scattered areas. Curfews kept
145,000 people in their homes in Nablus, the West Bank's largest
city, and in nearby refugee camps.
   Also Friday, a Jerusalem magistrate's court ordered two
prominent Palestinians kept in jail while police continue an
investigation into whether they incited the Oct. 8 violence.
   Faisal Husseini, the leading PLO activist in the occupied
territories, was ordered held seven more days, and Sheik Mohammed
Jamal, deputy Moslem leader of Jerusalem, was remanded for five
additional days. Both deny the allegations.
   In his remand ruling, Judge David Cheshin said there was ``more
than sufficient grounds to support suspicions that the two incited
worshipers on the Temple Mount to throw stones,'' the Itim news
agency said.
   The Temple Mount killings were condemned in a resolution passed
unanimously by the U.N. Security Council last week. Israel has
refused to cooperate with a U.N. probe into the incident, but has
launched its own investigation into the deaths.

   Rescue workers on Friday found
three more bodies in a mine where a small earthquake triggered a
rock slide, bringing the death toll to nine, officials said.
   One person was still missing following the rock fall Thursday at
the Anglo American Corp. mine near Carletonville, about 40 miles
west of Johannesburg.
   A quake measuring 3.7 on the Richter scale shook the area
Thursday morning, causing a slide about 1.5 miles underground at
the Western Deep Levels' West mine.
   The bodies of six mine workers were found Thursday, and three
more were recovered Friday, a spokesman said. Six people were
injured, he said.
   Dogs trained to search by smell were being used to try to find
the last missing miner, officials said.
   The tremor was the second to affect the mine in two days. A
small quake Wednesday caused a slide that killed three miners.
   The company also said that earth tremors Thursday caused
collapses at another mine, and three employees were missing.
   It said rescue teams were searching for the men, who had been
working about a mile below the surface at the Vaal Reefs South Mine
near Orkney, about 120 miles southwest of Johannesburg.

<HEAD>Trial of Former Securitate Chief Suspended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Bucharest military court decided
Friday to suspend the trial of former Communist dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu's secret police chief because of insufficient evidence.
   Gen. Iulian Vlad, the former head of the feared Securitate, or
secret police, was charged with ``complicity to genocide'' in the
deaths of more than 1,000 Romanians during the revolution against
Ceausescu last December.
   He would face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted.
   But a statement by the court, carcial news
agency Rompres, said ``the prosecution has not succeeded in
convincing anyone that Vried on the offilad was guilty of mass murder.''
   The prosecution can appeal the court's ruling within 10 days,
and Vlad, 59, will remain in police custody until then.
   The case was withdrawn and will be transferred to the
prosecutor's office for ``completion of investigation,'' the court
said.
   If the prosecution decides Vlad could be guilty of another
offense, then a new trial could be held. If the prosecution does
not appeal the court's decision or loses the appeal, Vlad will be
freed.
   About 40 witnesses have testified so far. Most maintained that
Vlad did not give any orders to fire on demonstrators during the
revolution that ended with the execution of Ceausescu and his wife,
Elena, on Dec. 25.

<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Friday cited
Soviet cooperation in the Persian Gulf as helping end his
skepticism toward the Kremlin and fostering a belief that Moscow is
no longer an adversary.
   ``I think that while I did in fact begin as a skeptic, based on
past experience, I have been persuaded by the events of the last 18
months that indeed we have entered a new era of U.S.-Soviet
relations,'' Cheney said at a joint news conference with Soviet
Defense Minister Marshal Dmitri T. Yazov.
   During his four-day Soviet trip, which ended Friday, Cheney met
with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Yazov and other leaders,
visited an elite Soviet airborne unit and toured an underground
air-defense post and a MiG-29 factory. He departed for Paris after
the news conference.
   ``President Gorbachev, in his conversations with me, reiterated
the strong support of the Soviet government for the international
effort that has been mounted through the United Nations and the
support of the Soviet people for the position of forcing Saddam
Hussein to halt his aggression and to withdraw from Kuwait,''
Cheney said.
   ``The United States is undertaking a fundamental revision of its
military strategy as a result of the significant improvements we
have seen in U.S. Soviet relations,'' he said he had told Soviet
officials.
   ``I am very positive about the changes we have seen to date. I
think that the evidence is overwhelming that there is indeed change
underway in Soviet foreign and military policy,'' Cheney said.
   He cited proposed treaties to slash conventional and strategic
forces, along with ``Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe,
reunification of Germany, (and) cooperation in the U.N. Security
Council in opposing Saddam Hussein's aggression in the gulf.''
   Cheney, while praising Soviet help in bringing economic and
diplomatic pressure to persuade Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait,
said, ``I have also made it clear, as have other officials of our
government, that we have not ruled out other options.''
   The Soviet defense minister emphasized that, ``We should look
for political options to revolve the problem of the gulf.''
   ``I believe that if we succeed in resolving this conflict by
political means, it would be a ... good warning to those who people
who try to disrupt peace in the future,'' Yazov said.
   Yazov hailed the superpower military talks, saying, ``We have
never had such frank talks about deep cuts in our forces.''
   He also said that with completion of a proposed treaty to slash
superpower strategic nuclear arsenals by up to half, the Soviet
Union might reduce its production of rockets by 50 percent as well.
   But until such weapons are eliminated altogether, he said the
Soviet Union would continue to replace about 10 percent of its
strategic rocket force every year, to assure that they were in a
state of readiness.
   Cheney, in remarks Wednesday to the Soviet lawmakers, said he
was worried because the Soviet Union was conducting tests on four
new ballistic missiles to replace the latest generation of weapons.
   Responding to questions about the turbulent Soviet political
situation, Yazov repeated his denials of rumors of a possible
military coup at the Kremlin to restore a hard-line stance toward
ethnic and regional unrest.
   ``The Armed Forces of the Soviet Union are part and parcel of
our people of this country and they will never raise arms against
their people,'' Yazov said.
   Yazov declined to clarify conflicting reports about whether
nuclear weapons had been removed from some areas such as the Baltic
and Caucasian republics. But he did say that long-range nuclear
forces were stationed only in Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine.
His remark did not appear to cover shorter-range nuclear weapons
that might be stationed, or might have been removed, from other
republics.
   Yazov also said the military would hold its customary parade on
Red Square this Nov. 7, the 73rd anniversary of the Bolshevik
Revolution. But he said similar parades might be restricted to
military bases in cities where local authorities chose not to
celebrate the holiday.

   A county judge skipped his usual opening
prayer for the court Friday after a federal judge ruled the
blessing unconstitutional.
   U.S. District Judge James McMillan ruled Thursday that Judge
Bill Constangy's prayer was tantamount to government establishing
religion.
   The ruling decided a lawsuit against the Mecklenburg district
judge by the American Civil Liberties Union and five Charlotte
lawyers who objected to Constangy's morning invocation.
   ``With all due respect for Judge Constangy's sincerity, I must
conclude that his prayer in the courtroom is contrary to the law of
the land,'' McMillan wrote.
   ``Judge Constangy's prayer, uttered in good faith to an audience
that may include people of different faiths (or no admitted faith
at all) is an obvious violation of the First Amendment,'' he wrote.
   Constangy said he will appeal the ruling.
   ``I do not want anybody to be disappointed,'' said Constangy,
who was appointed to the bench in 1989. ``This is just the first
round.''
   Each day since taking office Constangy has recited a 67-word
prayer he composed:
   ``Oh Lord, our God, our Father in Heaven, we pray this morning
that you will place your divine guiding hand on this courtroom and
that with your mighty, outstretched arm you will protect the
innocent, give justice to those who have been harmed and mercy to
us all. Let truth be heard and wisdom be reflected in the light of
your presence here with us today. Amen.''
   Constangy, a Roman Catholic, said he intended the prayer to be
``very nonsectarian, nonproselytizing.''
   ``There are three reasons why I open with prayer,'' Constangy
said. ``They are to express a reverence for God, to set proper tone
for the court and to continue the American tradition of opening
deliberative bodies with prayer.''
   Constangy said that before the lawsuit he heard complaints from
only two attorneys. One of them joined the lawsuit.

   While troops conduct maneuvers in
the desert and pilots fly training missions, naval interceptions to
enforce the embargo against Iraq are the only truly operational
element of Desert Shield.
   U.S. military officials said Friday there have been about 2,500
interceptions and 240 boardings the past two months.
   U.S. warships had a role in 191 of the boardings, the officials
said. The British, Australian and Spanish navies have participated
jointly in some.
   In 11 cases, commercial ships were diverted to ports other than
their destination after being suspected of carrying cargo bound to
or from Iraq, the officials said in a report.
   The embargo was imposed on Iraq following its Aug. 2 takeover of
Kuwait. Navies from about a dozen nations are taking part in the
gulf efforts.
   The U.N. Security Council imposed a trade embargo on Iraq
following its takeover of Kuwait. Later the same month, the Council
voted to back the sanctions with military might.
   Navies from about a dozen nations are taking part in the gulf
efforts.
   On a handful of visits to vessels in the Persian Gulf region,
reporters have heard radio traffic exchanges between naval ships
and commercial vessels and have seen demonstrations of how the
boarding teams operate.
   But none of the journalists covering Operation Desert Shield
have been present in instances in which warships fired warning
shots to force merchant ships to stop. Nor have they seen any
boarding by inspection teams.
   After questioning ships as to their cargo and destination, the
warships may send boarding teams to determine whether the cargo is
bound to or from Iraq in violation of the U.N. restrictions.
   Ships whose cargo or documents are suspect are then directed to
ports other than their intended destination.
   U.S. officials have offered little to explain why the media have
not been allowed to visit American warships performing embargo
duty, or why details have been provided by the navy in only a
handful of cases.
   Navy Cmdr. Mike Doubleday, a spokesman for the U.S. Command in
Riyadh, blamed logistical problems, especially transportation for
journalists.

<HEAD>Two Sections of Line to be Inspected For Alleged Corrosion Flaws</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two sections of the trans-Alaska oil
pipeline will be dug up to check claims that corrosion flaws were
covered up earlier this year.
   Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. will begin the work next week if
the company can quickly find a contractor agreeable to the state
and to federal agencies, said Marnie Isaacs, a company spokeswoman.
   The decision to dig comes a week after Ed Thompson, a former
employee of Thorpe Technical Services Inc. claimed his employer -
an Alyeska contractor - falsified corrosion detection tests and
tolerated widespread drug use among employees while working on the
pipeline.
   David Vickery of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management said his
agency, the Interior Department and other federal agencies agreed
Thursday to dig at two sites Thompson mentioned in his letter after
interviews with others involved in the original inspections.
   The two small sections of line to be dug up are at Atigun pass,
171 miles south of Prudhoe Bay, and near Delta Junction. From 80 to
160 feet of line will be dug up for the inspections.
   Vickery said the agencies will meet again next week to decide
about more digs in other areas.
   Doug Mertz, a state assistant attorney general working on the
investigation, said it is clear that ``a substantial number'' of
pipe sections will have to be dug up and reinspected. He said he
does not know exactly how many or where.
   Isaacs said the company agreed to reinspect the two sections at
the informal request of the federal agencies, and would not favor
more digging until results are known from the first digs and after
an investigation and audit of the original inspection project is
complete.
   She said the digs and reinspections will cost less than $100,000
for both, but did not have a precise figure.
   The inspections will not impact the flow of oil through the
pipeline, Alyeska said.
   The Persian Gulf crisis has prompted increased oil production on
Alaska's North Slope.
   Since last summer, Alyeska has increased flow by about 300,000
barrels a day to its current level of 1.95 million barrels daily,
Isaacs said.
   State and federal officials say they won't agree to increase the
pressure of oil in the pipeline - a factor in increasing the flow -
until the inspection issues are settled. Officials are concerned
that increased pressure on a weakened section of the line could
cause a leak.
   By using chemicals that reduce the friction of oil flowing
through the line, Alyeska could pump 2 million barrels a day ``and
still honor the pressure limits we currently operate under,''
Isaacs said.
   Alyeska runs the trans-Alaska pipeline for the seven major oil
companies that on it. The 800-mile line provides one-fourth of
U.S. oil production.
   Isaacs said that while Alyeska has no worries about the
integrity of the pipeline, it is concerned about the alleged
mismanagement of the inspectors.
   Dale Thorpe, president of Thorpe Technical Services, said he
welcomes the inspections as a chance to vindicate the quality of
the company's work.
   ``I think it's great,'' he said. ``We know the exact results of
what's going to happen.''

<HEAD>Prosecutor Challenges Postponement of Mandela Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government prosecutor Friday
challenged a local judge's decision to postpone until February the
trial of Winnie Mandela and seven of her former bodyguards on
charges of kidnapping and assault.
   Mrs. Mandela, wife of African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela, has denied any wrongdoing. She and the others are accused
of abducting and beating four young men at her house in the Soweto
black township.
   The leader of her bodyguards, Jerry Richardson, earlier was
convicted of murdering one of the four and was sentenced to death.
   The eight defendants appeared Sept. 24 in magistrate's court in
Soweto, where her attorney argued that the original Oct. 30 trial
date left Mrs. Mandela insufficient time to prepare.
   Magistrate T.F. Veldman postponed the Supreme Court trial until
Feb. 4.
   Transvaal Attorney General Klaus Von Lieres on Friday asked the
Supreme Court to rule that a magistrate lacks the power to change
the Supreme Court trial date Von Lieres set.
   The delay in challenging the postponement was not immediately
explained.
   The Supreme Court reserved judgment.
   The charges stem from a December 1988 incident that killed
14-year-old Stompei Seipei.
   During Richardson's trial, the three other alleged victims
testified they were abducted by members of the Mandela United
Football Club - Mrs. Mandela's bodyguards - and taken to her home.
They said Mrs. Mandela whipped them and that the others also
assaulted them.
   If convicted of the charges against them, the defendants could
receive punishment ranging from a suspended sentence to the death
penalty. Lawyers said the death sentence has never been imposed for
kidnapping in South Africa.
   White and black leaders fear Mrs. Mandela's trial could strain
relations between the ANC and the government as they try to start
talks on ending apartheid.
   Youths on the soccer club Mrs. Mandela formed played few matches
and were accused of terrorizing the Soweto neighborhood where she
lived.
   According to testimony at Richardson's trial, the bodyguards
accused Seipei of being a police informer and the other three of
having homosexual relations with the white minister at their church
home.
   No evidence was presented that Seipei, a well-known
anti-apartheid activist, was a police spy. The Methodist Church
cleared the minister of any misconduct.

<TEXT>
   Ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
spoke to a campaign rally Friday that attracted 100,000 people and
predicted her party would ``wash away'' the opposition if there's
no fraud in next week's elections.
   After arriving three hours late, Ms. Bhutto spoke to the
supporters from a 10-foot high stage surrounded by barbed wire to
hold back the surging, screaming crowd.
   Huge posters of Ms. Bhutto, kneeling with her covered head bowed
in prayer, towered over the crowd in Liaqat Park, the site where
Pakistan's first prime minister, Liaqat Ali Khan, was assassinated
39 years ago.
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan used his constitutional power to
oust Ms. Bhutto Aug. 6 and replace her with a caretaker government.
He charged her administration had plundered the national treasury
and engaged in corruption and nepotism.
   Ms. Bhutto claims the charges were a false pretext for a
politically motivated action.
   A court Thursday upheld the legality of her dismissal. But Ms.
Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples' Party (PPP) has gained momentum in
recent weeks heading into Wednesday's election, presumably due to
the perception that she is being persecuted.
   The 37-year-old Ms. Bhutto was joined on the Rawalpindi stage by
her partners in a three-party coalition that faces a right-wing
alliance of nine parties.
   She warned the candidates to be wary of rigging by the
army-backed caretaker government and predicted attempts would be
made to control the voting.
   ``If there is no rigging, a PPP flood will wash away my
opponents,'' she said.
   She also said only her return to power would ensure a
restoration of the $573 million U.S. aid package to Pakistan.
   ``America stopped its aid because democracy ended when my
government was dismissed,'' she told the rally.
   The United States technically suspended aid to Pakistan on Oct.
1 after President Bush failed to guarantee to Congress that
Islamabad was not developing nuclear weapons.
   A decision on whether to renew the aid would come some time
after a new Pakistani governmient was elected, officials in
Washington have said.
   Western diplomats said the 37-year-old former prime minister has
a strong lobby in the U.S. Congress.
   ``There is still that image of Benazir Bhutto as the shining
example of democracy in South Asia,'' said one diplomat, who
insisted he not be identified further.

<HEAD>International Panel To Review Hormone That Increases Cow's Milk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international panel said Friday it would
include in a list of chemicals to be reviewed in 1992 a
controversial drug that could induce cows to give more milk.
   The drug, bovine somatotropin or BST, is still under review by
the Food and Drug Administration for possible use by U.S. dairy
farmers. Tests indicate the synthetic hormone could increase a
cow's milk production by 10 percent to 25 percent.
   The Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods met
in closed session here this week. The agenda included the setting
of priorities for future reviews.
   The committee was established in 1985 to create standards for
safety of veterinary drug residues in food-producing animals,
although it has no regulatory authority.
   Its parent, the Codex Alimentarius Commission, was founded in
1962 by the United Nations to develop food standards and guidelines
to protect consumers and defend fair trade.
   The committee's priority for 1991 included several groups of
tranquilizers, anti-parasitic drugs and antibiotics.
   For its 1992 review, the committee selected several more groups,
including bovine somatotropin, also known as BGH, or bovine growth
hormone.
   The committee reported after the meeting that porcine
somatotropin, or PST, which is being developed for swine, would not
be scheduled for review at this time.
   ``One criterion for review is that the product be currently
marketed in at least one country,'' the committee said in its
statement. ``PST is not currently marketed.''
   An important part of the committee's job is to designate
reliable test methodology for detecting drug residues in food,
which is essential to national residue monitoring programs.
   The panel said it agreed on ``validated test methods'' for
albendazole and ivermectin, anti-parasitic drugs used in cattle and
sheep, and carbadox, which is used to treat diarrhea diseases in
swine.
   Thirty-four countries and seven international organizations were
said to have been represented at the conference.

   The U.S. ambassador got hearty cheers
instead of angry jeers when he showed up for the unification bash
in Berlin. What a difference a year makes.
   German grumbling about the U.S. military had reached new peaks
before the East bloc started crumbling, the two Germanys began
marching to unity, and Washington decided to start cutting back on
its troop levels.
   Some Germans are still dissatisfied with the disarmament plans
announced so far. But anti-American sentiments have significantly
quieted.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bonn is no longer besieged by German
journalists who ask why the American military seems insensitive to
Germans' wishes.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters made a lot of German friends
last year when he voiced his support for unity, and Germans greeted
him with cheers when they spotted him at Berlin's unity party.
   His predecessor, Richard Burt, was often heckled and booed
because he was the symbol of the U.S. military presence at a time
of growing German impatience with NATO troops.
   German officials have welcomed the pending U.S. troop pullouts
and are eager for the military property that will become available
to them.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said last month that 30,000
soldiers would be withdrawn from Germany.
   Across the former West Germany, officials are drawing up plans
for the property, which is sorely needed in a country with a severe
housing shortage.
   But at the same time, there is worry about thousands of civilian
jobs that will be lost because of the troop reductions.
   There have been estimates that across Germany about 108,000 jobs
are threatened by the U.S. cutbacks.
   American officials say Germany gets an annual infusion of about
$8.75 billion because of the U.S. troop presence alone.
   Some experts have said a total pullout of all NATO troops from
Germany could bring economic disaster.
   ``I think that many Germans are now starting to realize what an
economic boon it is to have the Americans here,'' says Harry
Spittler, owner of Harry's Gift Shop in Kaiserslautern. Like many
businesses in the area, Spittler's store relies heavily on the
business of American GIs.
   Germans may be having kinder thoughts about their American
guests now that many of them are about to leave, but the upcoming
cutbacks have also caused some new friction. Some state and local
officials had hoped to get their hands on properties that aren't
being immediately abandoned.
   The troop reduction plans have also caused disputes among
Germans.
   In some areas, people have been arguing over whether military
air bases should become commercial airports. Many citizens ask why
the noise of military aircraft should be replaced with that of
commercial planes.

   While overworked prosecutors try to build a case
against former East German Communist leader Erich Honecker, he is
still able to travel abroad and enjoy other freedoms, the
investigation team chief said Friday.
   ``There is no arrest warrant against Honecker,'' said Christoph
Schaefgen, whose team has been poring through about 400 large
spiral binders concerning Honecker.
   Toppled from power a year ago, Honecker is being investigated
for corruption and ``murder and causing bodily harm'' for the
shoot-to-kill orders for would-be escapees from East Germany. About
200 people were killed trying to flee East Germany.
   Investigators are seeking enough evidence to arrest and jail the
78-year-old deposed party boss before trial.
   Honecker has been quoted as saying he wants to stay in Germany,
but he has previously noted his wish to visit Chile, where his
daughter Erika lives with her husband and child. There is also
speculation he could head to the Soviet Union, where some of his
top spies reportedly have found refuge.
   ``As a prosecutor, I am strictly bound to the provisions of the
criminal law, and I can only hinder freedom of travel when the
conditions have been met,'' said Schaefgen.
   Honecker reportedly is suffering from cancer, but looked fit in
recently shot TV news footage taken outside the Soviet military
hospital where he is staying.
   Berlin justice officials heightened interest in the case by
announcing a news conference Friday to give an interim report on
the criminal probes into Honecker and others.
   Some people had expected the announcement of his pending arrest.
Instead, Schaefgen said a heavy workload so far has hindered
progress in the Honecker case.
   Schaefgen said under German law prosecutors must turn their
attention to the cases of two members of Honecker's former regime
who are already jailed - Erich Mielke, the former East German
secret police chief, and former government trade union boss Harry
Tisch.
   ``This means that we have not been able to devote ourselves to
the Honecker probe with as much intensity as you would have
expected,'' the prosecutor said.
   He said the stepped-up probe against Honecker would begin ``as
soon as possible.''
   Both Miekle and Tisch are charged with corruption, and Mielke is
also being investigated for complicity in murders of East Germans
after they had abandoned their country.
   Berlin justice department chief Jutta Limbach said a lack of a
sufficient number of prosecutors also has slowed the probe against
Honecker.
   ``This takes time and patience,'' said Ms. Limbach, who urged
prosecutors from other parts of Germany to come to Berlin to help
relieve the workload.
   Ms. Limbach said using former East German prosecutors would be
difficult until a full review of their past.

Story</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ann Richards on
Friday denounced a New Mexico man's allegation that he saw her use
cocaine 13 years ago and called it a ``smear'' by GOP candidate
Clayton Williams.
   ``This stinks to high heaven,'' Richards told reporters.
   Richards, a recovering alcoholic, has been dogged by drug
questions since February. During a televised debate, she refused to
say whether she had ever used illegal drugs.
   ``My political opponents cannot resist using my illness when all
else is failing in their campaigns,'' Richards said.
   Reggie Bashur, a Williams consultant, said the Republican's
campaign had nothing to do with the charge. ``We are not involved
and Ann Richards knows it,'' he said.
   ``As far as we're concerned, this comes totally out of left
field. It's unfortunate that Ms. Richards is so shrill and so
panicked,'' Bashur said.
   The allegation was contained in a story published Friday by the
Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal. It was reiterated later in the day at a
San Antonio news conference held by Bexar County Sheriff Harlon
Copeland.
   ``That story and the actions of the Republican sheriff of Bexar
County have taken the Clayton Williams' smear campaign to new
lows,'' Richards said.
   The newspaper and the sheriff cited interviews with J.D. Arnold,
a Santa Fe, N.M., tour operator. Arnold also was a press secretary
to former Rep. Jim Mattox, now state attorney general, who lost the
gubernatorial nomination to Richards in April.
   Copeland said Arnold gave a sworn statement that he saw Richards
use cocaine at the Stoneleigh P. bar in Dallas on Dec. 7, 1977,
following a Mattox fund-raiser.
   ``I just can't understand why anyone who is a drug user would
try to get into high office,'' Copeland said. ``Ann Richards: Did
you use drugs or did you not use drugs?
   He denied he had a political motive in making the allegation
public, saying Arnold's name surfaced during a San Antonio drug
trafficking investigation.
   ``This is a dangerous and unpardonable subversion of the police
function of Bexar County by a campaign that has not only lost its
momentum, it has lost its moral compass,'' Richards said. ``The
actions of the Bexar County sheriff represent an abuse of power.''
   Arnold told the Albuquerque newspaper he made the allegation
public ``because I can't stand Ann Richards.''
   ``I'm so sick of her,'' he said. ``I'm sick of everything she's
done. It all goes back to the comments she made (about Mattox),
like `He's like a chicken-killing dog.'''
   ``The affidavit described in the article of J.D. Arnold is not
true,'' Richards said.
   Richards introduced to reporters two women who said she hadn't
attended the 1977 party - her longtime friend Betty McKool of
Dallas and Martha Harris of Austin. McKool said Richards was with
her that night. Harris said she attended the party and Richards
wasn't there.
   Richards accused Williams of trying to divert attention from an
investigation into his ClayDesta National Bank and its practices of
giving car loans to high-risk customers.
   Williams has denied any wrongdoing.

<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill presented to Zambia's parliament
Friday would rewrite the constitution to allow opposition parties
for the first time in 17 years.
   The bill, signed by Attorney-General Frederick Chomba, repeals
Article IV of the constitution, which made President Kenneth
Kaunda's United National Independence Party the only legal
political party.
   Zambia's rubber-stamp parliament routinely passes any initiative
that is passed to it by the executive.
   Kaunda, 66, led the British colony to independence in 1964 and
imposed a one-party state in 1973.
   The onetime missionary teacher has often argued that democracy
in Africa unleashes tribal conflicts and hinders development.
   But faced by dwindling popularity due to widespread corruption,
mismanagement, inflation and unemployment, he promised multiparty
elections next year.
   In June, at least 27 Zambians were killed by security forces
during nationwide demonstrations against increased food prices, the
bloodiest urban violence since Independence.
   At the height of the rioting, jeering crowds called for Kaunda's
resignation, one of the first public expressions of opposition to
his leadership.
   Kaunda's main challenge springs from the fledgling Movement for
Multiparty Democracy, a congress of opposition groups planning to
establish one rival political party.
   The movement's chairman, former Cabinet minister Arthur Wina,
and its secretary, businessman Akashambatwa Mbikusita-Lewanika,
have been appointed by Kaunda to a 22-member commission that is
redrafting the constitution.

   The Pentagon said Friday it is shipping
several hundred of its best tanks from storage depots in Europe to
Saudi Arabia to join U.S. forces arrayed against Iraq.
   The transfer of M1A1 main battle tanks to armored units in the
Saudi desert is the latest indication of a declining U.S. emphasis
on defending against a Soviet ground attack in Europe.
   The Pentagon also said the Bush administration is in the final
stages of approving the sale of 220 older M60 tanks in Europe to
Saudi Arabia, Oman and Bahrain. It said the sale would ``contribute
to the security in the Persian Gulf area.''
   The announcement did not say exactly how many M1A1 tanks were
being transferred to U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, but it appeared
the total was 300 to 400.
   The M1A1 is the latest model produced in the United States. It
has better protection against chemical and biological weapons
attack, and its German-designed 120mm gun is more capable than the
105mm gun on the older M1 tanks. The M1A1 also has better armor.
   The M1A1 also has better armor and it is the first American tank
with a ``microclimatic cooling system'' designed to combat the
effects of excessive heat on the tank's engine and weapons system.
It also has a thermal sighting system that gives the tank an added
capability to fight at night and in low visibility.
   About 600 M1 and M1A1 tanks already are deployed to Saudi Arabia
with the 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and other armored units, so
the addition of M1A1s from Europe would bring the total U.S. tank
strength to nearly 1,000. That compares with the 3,500 Iraqi tanks
that the Pentagon says are deployed in Kuwait and southern Iraq.
   In its announcement, the Pentagon said the tanks being
transferred to Saudi Arabia won't be needed in Europe once the
Conventional Forces in Europe treaty is completed, which could come
by the end of the year. The CFE treaty requires the NATO countries
to reduce their tank inventory to 20,000, meaning that about 4,000
tanks will have to be destroyed.
   The Pentagon said that the administration has proposed to the
NATO allies that the M1A1 tanks being sent to Saudi Arabia be
counted against the NATO total under CFE, meaning the M1A1s would
not have to be destroyed even if returned to Europe.

<TEXT>
   Alexander E. Barkan, longtime head of the
AFL-CIO's political action committee, has died, the labor
federation announced Friday.
   Barkan, who had been active in the trade union movement since
1937, died Thursday at Sibley Hospital after a long illness. He was
81.
   ``To know Al was to be lifted by his great vitality and
single-mindedness with which he pursued trade unionism in general
and election victories in particular,'' said Lane Kirkland,
president of the 14.2 million-member AFL-CIO.
   Barkan was a native of Bayonne, N.J. He studied economics and
political science at the University of Chicago. The AFL-CIO said he
became committed to unionism, in part, as a result of attending
lectures by and discussion groups with famed civil rights attorney
Clarence Darrow.
   In 1937, Barkan joined the staff of the Textile Workers
Organizing Committee. Following the merger of the AFL and the CIO
in 1955, Barkan was appointed assistant director of the
federation's Committee on Political Education, or COPE.
   He was appointed COPE director in 1963 by then AFL-CIO President
George Meany, overseeing the powerful labor federation's millions
of dollars worth of political contributions and channeling its
manpower into political campaigns. He retired in 1980.
   Barkan is survived by his wife, Helen, two daughters and four
grandchildren.

   Deficit-reduction bills passed by the House
and Senate would cut taxes for many of the 70 million couples and
individuals with incomes under $20,000 a year.
   Although the aim of the bills is to raise taxes, the legislation
would reduce the burden on that large class of taxpayers by
boosting the earned-income credit for poor working families with
children. The increase is designed to offset higher consumer taxes
in both bills.
   The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the Senate bill would
raise the tax burden on people in the $20,000-to-$50,000 income
range by about 2.8 percent, three times as much as would the House
bill.
   People making between $50,000 and $75,000 would pay 1.9 percent
more under the Senate bill and 1.4 percent more under the House
bill. Those between $75,000 and $100,000 would see a 2.5 percent
tax increase under the Senate measure and 1.5 percent in the House
bill.
   The Senate would boost the tax burden of people with incomes
between $100,000 and $200,000 by 3.5 percent - five times as much
as would the House bill. The over-$200,000 group would pay 3.7
percent more in the Senate bill and 7.4 percent more under the
House version.
   Here is how the bills compare:
   GASOLINE: The Senate would raise the 9-cent gasoline tax to 18{
cents a gallon by 1992 and the 15-cent diesel tax to 24{ cents. No
increase in the House bill. Neither bill affects heating oil.
   INDEXING: The House would forgo for one year the annual
adjustments to income tax brackets and personal exemptions, which
are designed to protect against inflation-caused tax increases
known as bracket creep. As a result, all except the wealthiest
people would pay higher taxes every year in the future. The Senate
has no such provision.
   ALCOHOL: House: Raise the $12.50-a-gallon tax on 100-proof
liquor by $1, or 20 cents a fifth; double the beer tax to 32 cents
a six-pack; raise taxes on most wines, including, for example,
table wine, which would go from 3 cents a 750-milliliter bottle to
25 cents. Senate: Raise liquor $1.20; double beer; raise table wine
to 21 cents.
   TOBACCO: Both raise the 16-cent cigarette tax by 4 cents in 1991
and another 4 cents in 1993. Snuff, cigars and other tobacco would
face 25 percent tax increases each year.
   AIR TRAVEL: The 8 percent tax on airline tickets, scheduled to
drop to 4 percent at year-end, would rise instead to 10 percent.
   TELEPHONES: The Senate, but not the House, would make permanent
the 3 percent tax on local and long-distance phone service, which
is due to expire Dec. 31.
   LUXURIES: Either would impose a 10 percent tax on the portion of
the price of cars above $30,000; boats above $100,000; jewelry
above $5,000; furs above $10,000 (House) or $5,000 (Senate), and
private planes $100,000 (House) or $250,000 (Senate).
   TAX RATES: The House bill would raise the top rate paid by the
wealthiest people, now 28 percent, to 33 percent. It would impose a
10 percent surtax on those with taxable incomes over $1 million.
The Senate bill would do neither. The House, but not the Senate,
would raise to 25 percent the 21 percent alternative minimum tax,
paid by some high-income people with large amounts of deductions
that otherwise could reduce tax liability to near zero.
   ITEMIZED DEDUCTIONS: The Senate would limit itemized deductions
(except those for medical expense, casualty losses and investment
interest) of people with adjusted gross income over $100,000. Only
95 percent of deductions would be allowed against the portion of
income above $100,000.
   CAPITAL GAINS: The House would allow a person to avoid tax on
half of up to $200,000 of capital gains earned in a lifetime; the
gains could come from most investments other than stocks or
collectibles. A person with annual income under $100,000 could
avoid tax on another $1,000 a year of gains, including those from
the sale of stock. No capital gain would be taxed at a rate above
28 percent. The Senate bill has no capital gains provisions.
   LOW-INCOME: Both bills would increase the earned-income tax
credit, which benefits low-income working families with children,
as a way of offsetting some of the increased excise taxes. The
Senate plan expands child care benefits.
   MEDICARE TAXES: The House would increase to $100,000 and the
Senate to $89,000 the $51,300 maximum annual wage to which the 1.45
percent Medicare tax applies. The tax is withheld as part of the
Social Security tax. The Senate would require all state and local
government workers and their employers to pay the tax; the House
would continue exempting workers hired before April 1, 1986.
   MEDICARE PREMIUMS: House would raise the $28.60 monthly premium
for Medicare Part B insurance to $46.20 by 1995. Senate: $47.
   MEDICARE DEDUCTIBLE: House would raise to $100 through 1995 the
present $75 deductible, which beneficiaries must pay before
Medicare starts paying for doctor bills. Senate: $150.
   SOCIAL SECURITY: Both would require all state and local
government workers not covered by a public pension to pay Social
Security taxes.
   ENERGY INITIATIVES: The Senate bill earmarks $3.5 billion worth
of incentives for increasing U.S. oil and gas exploration and
production. The House does not.
   EXPIRING PROVISIONS: The Senate, but not the House, would extend
through 1991 at a five-year cost of $5.5 billion 11 targeted tax
breaks that are expiring. Principal beneficiaries include workers
who receive tuition aid or group legal services from employers;
businesses that hire the poor; investors in low-income rental
housing; self-employed who buy their own health insurance;
businesses that increase spending for research; and low-income
people buying a first home.
   CONTRIBUTIONS: The Senate, but not the House, would permit
upper-income people subject to the alternative minimum tax to
deduct the current value of artwork donated to a museum. Present
law allows them to write off only the purchase price.
   BUSINESS: Both bills would raise taxes on life insurance
companies by $8 billion. They would extend for five years an
expiring 0.2 percent surtax that employers pay for unemployment
insurance. Senate, but not House, would prohibit corporations from
deducting interest paid on overdue taxes.
   MEDICAL DEDUCTIONS: The Senate, but not the House, would deny a
medical expense deduction for cosmetic surgery unless prescribed to
repair damage from an accident or a birth defect.

   The city's suspended police chief
maintained his innocence Friday on charges of siphoning $58,000 in
special investigation funds.
   ``Our day in court will come, and we'll have a chance to prove
our innocence,'' Gordon Urlacher said after a brief federal court
hearing.
   Urlacher, 47, was arrested Thursday in the mayor's office and
charged with embezzlement and misapplying public funds. He was
released on $50,000 bail.
   The chief and four other police department employees were
suspended with pay. The others were not arrested.
   Urlacher posted the deed to his parents' home in Penfield, a
Rochester suburb, as bail security. His mother, Marion Urlacher,
signed the document and kissed her son before U.S. Magistrate
Kenneth Fisher.
   Fisher scheduled a Nov. 6 preliminary hearing.
   The criminal complaint accuses the police chief of stealing at
least $58,000 from department special investigation funds since
1989.
   The FBI was contacted earlier this month by an informant who
worked in Urlacher's office and claimed to have helped Urlacher
take the money, some of it set aside to buy drugs in undercover
investigations.
   The arrest and suspensions stunned department employees.
   ``We're all real devastated by it,'' said police union President
Ronald Evangelista. ``If I had to pick four or five more honest
cops, I probably couldn't. We're going to support these people
until they're proven to hav done something wrong.''
   Deputy Chief Terrence Rickard, one of those suspended, said he
worried about the department's reputation. He also denied any
personal wrongdoing.
   ``I hurt for every one of these guys I've got out there with a
badge,'' Rickard said.
   In a news conference Friday, Mayor Thomas Ryan called the arrest
of Urlacher ``by far'' his most difficult day in office.
   ``The events of the past 24 hours have had a profound effect on
the residents of this city, the employees of the city, the members
of the Rochester Police Department, and on myself personally,''
Ryan said.

   A City Council committee seeking to ensure that
Houston laws governing sexually-oriented businesses are legal
brought in an expert to talk about the difference between male and
female breasts.
   The panel held a hearing Thursday on a proposal to toughen the
ordinance governing adult entertainment and related businesses.
   ``I tell you, it was difficult to keep a straight face,'' said
Councilwoman Christin Hartung, who chairs the committee addressed
by Gayle Beck, a University of Houston professor and sex therapist.
   ``She did not give us any anatomy lessons, nor did we ask for
them,'' Assistant City Attorney Paul Bibler said.
   Councilman Dale Gorczynski summarized what the committee
learned: ``Exposed male breasts are not arousing to women in our
culture, but exposed female breasts are arousing to men.''
   The proposed ordinance would regulate such businesses as strip
clubs and adult-video stores. City officials want the law to
withstand potential sex discrimination claims from people who may
question why women must cover their breasts and men don't.
   They look to the experience of Fort Worth, where it is illegal
for women to publically expose their breasts.
   A Fort Worth topless club called Sinbad's won a challenge to the
city ordinance last year, complaining that police harassed the
business and bothered customers. Last week the Texas Supreme Court
decided not to review the case, letting the earlier decision stand.
   Houston restricts the location of strip clubs, modeling studios
and massage parlors. The council wants to further restrict them.
   The proposed ordinance will get a council hearing next month.

<TEXT>
   Stanford University scientists have
found a chemical ``off switch'' that stops the replication of DNA,
a discovery they believe could improve understanding of cancer,
AIDS and other diseases.
   The researchers said in the October issue of Cell they
identified a protein that inhibits replication of DNA in E. coli, a
common bacterium. Stopping the DNA keeps the cell from dividing.
   While the bacterium is a relatively simple organism, DNA works
essentially the same way in bacteria as in plants, animals and
humans, researchers said. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the
genetic code found in all cells.
   ``There's a universal use of basic biochemical patterns
throughout nature that warrants our confidence that regulation of
these processes, when understood in one system, will become easier
to understand in all systems,'' said Arthur Kornberg, a
biochemistry professor at Stanford.
   Kornberg, who won the 1959 Nobel Prize in medicine for earlier
research in DNA replication, was co-author of the report written
after nine years of experiments.
   ``We now believe we have most of the molecules that operate the
switch of replication in pure form,'' Kornberg said.
   ``If you know the anatomy of the switch, if you have the hood
off ad can see how the motor works, you can then determine what
factors provoke it to get started replicating or keep it in
check,'' he said.
   Kornberg's team, also led by Deog Su Hwang, a Stanford
postdoctoral fellow, found that the ``off switch'' for DNA
replication is a protein called 33-kDA. The protein prevents the
twin spiraled strands of DNA molecules from replicating.
   The team found the ``on switch,'' a tiny segment on each
chromosome activated by enzymes, in 1981. Chromosomes are formed of
DNA.
   Kornberg emphasized that the new discovery was only a tool for
further research into the code that tells cells when and how to
start and stop duplicating.
   John Minna, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute,
called the Stanford finding ``very exciting.''
   ``Clearly, this is a major new finding about the biochemistry of
DNA replication by Dr. Kornberg, the founding father of the whole
field,'' he said.
   There are many diseases in which the cell's ability to control
DNA replication is impaired, Minna said.
   ``It could have profound implications for cancer and AIDS,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   Human error caused a 9-foot-long
aluminum beam to be left inside the engine compartment of the space
shuttle Atlantis, damaging the craft, investigators concluded
Friday.
   The beam was discovered Oct. 3 when the shuttle was lifted into
an upright position in an assembly room, said J.B. Kump, a
spokesma for Lockheed Space Operations Co. of Titusville. The
company is NASA's primary shuttle contractor.
   The beam, part of a work platform, banged around inside the
compartment and caused about 25 dents and dings. The damage was not
expected to delay a secret military flight by Atlantis, set for
around Nov. 10.
   A nine-member Lockheed team blamed human error and not worker
fatigue, experience or scheduling, Kump said. The team based its
finding on employee interviews.
   The beam has since been removed.
   Kump said ``appropriate disciplinary actions'' would be taken
against the employees involved. He refused to elaborate.
   Hugh Harris, a National Aeronautics and Space Administration
spokesman, described the mistake as serious. The incident would be
taken into account in the agency's next evaluation of Lockheed's
performance, Harris said.

   Democrats pushed President Bush to accept
higher taxes on the richest Americans Friday as Congress began a
final drive to craft a compromise deficit-reduction bill.
   Republicans warned that pressing Bush too hard would merely
invite a veto.
   Bush, meanwhile, signed a stopgap spending bill to keep the
government functioning through next Wednesday to give Congress more
time to work on a final budget compromise.
   He signed the legislation shortly before leaving the White House
for a weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp David, Md.
   GOP lawmakers mustered around a bipartisan budget the Senate
adopted early Friday imposing only modest tax increases on the
wealthy and doubling the gasoline levy. Democrats preferred a
House-passed version leaning heavily on the rich, leaving the
gasoline tax alone and easing cost increases on Medicare
recipients.
   ``We believe in tax fairness and progressivity, and that's what
we're going to fight for,'' said House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo.
   ``You can bet your life if a package is going to pass in this
House it's going to include the rich,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee.
   But as House and Senate budget-writers began bargaining over a
$250 billion, five-year package of taxes and spending cuts,
Republicans warned that Democrats could not go too far without
risking a veto by Bush.
   ``I don't know why we have to go through a process of producing
a bill that will not be signed,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of New
Mexico, ranking Republican on the Budget Committee.
   Bush reiterated his preference for the Senate version and said,
``I, for the first time, feel optimistic that we can get this job
done for the American people.''
   The president visited the Capitol for about an hour, urging
lawmakers to quickly fashion a compromise plan.
   ``He said nobody is going to get all he wants,'' Senate Minority
Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said afterward.
   But with Election Day barely two weeks off, senators who just
hours earlier were united behind their compromise budget exhibited
some of the same partisan strains that have divided House Democrats
and Republicans for weeks.
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said he
did not feel obliged to fight for his chamber's deficit-cutting
package. ``I much prefer the House package with regard to revenues.
It puts a heavier burden on the wealthiest Americans to pay their
fair share.''
   Responded Domenici: ``I don't think any good purpose is served
by Chairman Sasser choosing sides. Frankly, the House bill isn't
that great.''
   Although the pressure of another threatened governmental closure
was lifted, budget writers planned to work through the weekend in
hopes of allowing Congress to adjourn for the year by midweek.
   Lawmakers and staffs met throughout the Capitol, tackling a task
whose complexity was symbolized by the legislation itself: a
half-foot stack of paper weighing 13 pounds.
   The legislation is the major part of a plan to cut the deficit
by $500 billion over the next five years, including $40 billion
this year. The rest of the savings would come from cuts in the
defense budget, and savings on interest payments on the debt.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley said Democrats would insist that the
Senate moderate its doubling of the 9-cent-per-gallon gasoline tax
and its steeper increases in out-of-pocket Medicare costs for
beneficiaries.
   He also noted that Democrats remain behind the House plan's
higher taxes on the rich. That package increases the income-tax
rate the richest people pay from its current 28 percent to 33
percent and puts a 10 percent surtax on people earning $1 million
annually.
   ``Obviously, compromises are required,'' Foley, D-Wash., told
reporters after a party caucus. ``The insistence of the president
in having no income tax changes (affecting the rich) seems to be
inexplicable and inflexible.''
   Lawmakers have talked for days about a possible compromise
boosting the top tax rate to 31 percent.
   Bush has said he would accept that increase only in return for
deep cuts in the capital gains tax, a trade Democrats are unwilling
to make. But Republicans would not flatly rule out that higher tax
rates on the rich would emerge.
   ``I can't support an increase in the tax rates,'' said Sen. Bob
Packwood, R-Ore., ranking Republican on the Senate Finance
Committee. But he added, ``I may get rolled'' during House-Senate
negotiations.
   Bush strongly opposes a House provision that would, in effect,
cause slight income-tax increases on most Americans. It would delay
for one year the inflation adjustment made in tax brackets and the
personal exemption. Democrats have said that provision is likely to
be altered or eliminated.
   Both the House and Senate bills would increase taxes on tobacco,
alcohol, airline tickets and luxury items such as private planes.
Both would enlarge tax credits for low-income people.

<HEAD>University of Arkansas Researchers Receive Superconductor Patent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The patent on what is billed as the
world's most advanced superconductor has been snared for the
University of Arkansas by two researchers.
   Zhengzhi Sheng, a physics researcher at the university, and
Allen Hermann, then a professor, developed a thalium-based
superconductor in 1988 that produced temperatures above 120 degrees
Kelvin, or minus 234 degrees Farenheit.
   The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted the school the
patent last week, a university spokesman said. It will protect the
rights to a material that holds the world record as the
highest-temperature superconductor.
   The patent was featured in the Oct. 15 cover story of
Superconductor Week, published in Washington. The article said
``the award gives the university the dominant patent in the
field.''
   Sheng and Hermann have been among leaders in a worldwide race to
develop superconductors that can operate at temperatures high
enough to make their use practical.
   A superconductors generates electricity without resistance when
cooled.
   Scientists say a practical superconductor would significantly
reduce the energy required to power manufacturing operations,
transportation networks and households.
   The inventors and the university will split the first $200,000
of profits the patent generates. Sheng and Hermann will receive 35
percent of all other proceeds. The university will get the rest.
   Sheng heads the university's superconductivity team. Last month,
he was among five recipients of the Awards of Excellence issued by
the World Congress on Superconductivity in Houston.
   Herman left the University of Arkansas last year and is now at
the University of Colorado.

   The president of Ecuador's Congress
rejected a vote of no-confidence directed against him on Friday,
throwing the legislature of this small Andean nation into crisis.
   ``They'll have to take me out in a coffin,'' said Averroes
Bucaram, a populist politician elected to head the Congress two
months ago.
   The crisis arose after three congressmen who supported Bucaram
switched votes this week to a group backing President Rodrigo
Borja. That gave Borja's coalition a 38-to-34 seat edge in the
single house of Congress.
   Borja's coalition voted late Thursday to remove Bucaram. Social
Democrat Edelberto Bonillo was then elected in his place.
   But Bucaram refused to leave. He said in a radio interview
Friday he slept in his office Thursday night and still tends to
``congressional business.''
   Bucaram said the no-confidence vote was linked to his attacks on
Borja's Cabinet. In the two months Bucaram has presided over
Congress, legislators have censured and forced two Borja ministers
to resign.
   This country of 10.5 million people returned to civilian
government in 1979. Congress has been a political battlefield since
then. Coalitions formed by the 16 political parties shift
constantly and many congressmen have little party or ideological
loyalty.
   Congressional officials said Friday they replaced heavy crystal
ashtrays on the floor of Congress with smaller ones made of
aluminum, after a congressman was severely cut above the eye by an
ashtray hurled by an opponent last week.

   A prominent Norwegian activist
investigating alleged human rights abuses against ethnic Albanians
was detained by police for about five hours Friday, a colleague
said.
   Bjorn Cato Funnemark, leader of the Norwegian Helsinki
Committee, was detained near Pristina, capital of Kosovo province,
said Tanja Petovar, Yugoslav spokeswoman for the Helsinki
Committee.
   Ms. Petovar said Funnemark was held five hours by Serbian
police, who kept Funnemark's passport and personal papers. It was
not clear if the documents were returned.
   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Funnemark was stopped while driving in a car with three ethnic
Albanians, who were not detained.
   Serbian and Yugoslav authorities could not immediately be
reached for comment.
   Serbs have taken control of the ethnic Albanian-dominated
province struggling to regain autonomy. Albanian-language
newspapers have been closed and radio and television stations were
seized.
   More than 60 ethnic Albanians have died in clashes with
Serb-dominated security forces the past 18 months.
   The International Helsinki Federation and other organizations
have recently issued critical reports on the rights situation in
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise about 90 percent of the 1.9
million people.
   ``This represents another serious violation,'' Ms. Petovar said.
   She said Funnemark, who has investigated rights abuses in
Romania, Ireland, Bulgaria and Turkey, ``is one of the most
prominent human rights experts in Western Europe.''
   In September, Serbian police detained a group from the Vienna,
Austria-based International Helsinki Federation. They were expelled
from Yugoslavia and barred from returning to the country for three
years. Authorities later lifted the ban.

   The voted Friday to spend more than $41
billion on dams, highways, airports and various military and
university projects as other lawmakers began struggling to reach a
final accord on reducing the federal deficit.
   In a rush to finish its work next week and avoid having to
return after the November elections, House members voted
overwhelmingly in favor of a transportation spending bill and
another energy and water spending bill together amounting to $33
billion.
   Also passed by voice vote was an $8.4 billion appropriations
bill for military construction projects, including $3.3 billion to
build new housing for families of servicemen and women and nearly
$1 billion as the second installment in closing more than 80
military bases over the next few years.
   The bills were produced by House-Senate conference committees
that reconciled separate versions passed earlier by each chamber.
   House members hope their votes on the so-called conference bills
reflecting compromises with the Senate will be the last they have
to cast. However, if senators balk later at the deals their
negotiators struck, the House could be required to consider them
again.
   Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., a member of the House Science and
Technology Committee, griped that members of Senate and House
appropriations committees had included some $90 million in projects
paid for by the Energy Department for home-state universities.
   ``Eight of those 10 projects happen to be in states or districts
of people who happen to be on the conference committee,'' he
complained. ``We're allocating money not based on anything other
than who's in the room divvying up the money.''
   But his motion to eliminate the projects was defeated 308-108 as
the chairman and top Republican on the House Appropriations
Committee's energy and water subcommittee said all the projects are
justified.
   ``There's nothing unusual about this,'' said the panel's
chairman, Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala. ``We need more labs; we need more
scientists; we need more emphasis put on these programs.''
   Rep. John Myers of Indiana, the top Republican on the panel,
said all of the projects had been examined in either House or
Senate hearings before appropriations subcommittees.
   Among the 10 recipients of the funds are research centers at the
University of Alabama and the University of Indiana.
   Among the projects hurt in the deficit-cutting effort was one of
President Bush's favorites - the proposed $8 billion super collider
atom smasher in Texas.
   Bush's request of $318 million to begin actual construction of
the giant particle accelerator had been approved earlier by both
the House and Senate. But it was slashed to $243 billion by their
negotiators last week.
   The House-Senate negotiators also dropped provisions from the
Senate's transportation money bill that would have required testing
of a mass transit workers for illegal drug use and prohibited truck
bus drivers from using radar detectors.
   But they retained a measure in the House bill that would require
states to suspend the drivers licenses of convicted drug offenders.
   ``This is going to send a message to our young people that if
they want that all-important symbol of adulthood, the drivers
license, they'd better say no to drugs,'' said the measure's
sponsor, Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.

   President Bush was confronted by a last-minute
appeal and demonstration by civil rights leaders Friday as he
weighed whether to carry through on his threat to veto the civil
rights minority-hiring bill.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said there was a
long-shot possibility that a compromise could be reached, but he
also indicated Bush might simply veto the bill.
   ``We will staple our new bill to the veto message and send it
right back up,'' Fitzwater suggested.
   However, another admininistration official said Friday that the
administration was preparing new proposals for Congress to consider
that offers a compromise on the sticky question of whether the bill
would result in hiring quotas for minorities.
   This official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
White House could have a draft ready this weekend to send to
Capitol Hill, where Congress members will be meeting on the federal
budget.
   The civil rights bill had not been sent to the White House from
Congress by the time Bush left to spend the weekend at the
presidential retreat at Camp David, Md.
   Meanwhile, Sen. James M. Jeffords, R-Vt., one of five
Republicans who met Thursday with Bush to discuss the bill, said he
remained optimistic that Congress could draft follow-up legislation
that would satisfy the president's objections.
   ``I talked to the president again this afternoon,'' Jeffords
said. ``We are optimistic, there has been movement on both sides.''
He said Bush set no deadline.
   The measure, passed earlier this week, would make it easier for
women and minority workers to bring discrimination suits against
their employers. The White House contends the bill would force
employers to establish hiring quotas - something that sponsors
dispute.
   The bill, which is the top legislative goal of national civil
rights groups, would reverse a series of Supreme Court rulings that
sponsors of the measure say have weakened anti-discrimination
protections in the workplace.
   Fitzwater said the only hope of heading off a veto was
congressional action on separate legislation that would, in effect,
modify the civil rights bill to meet the administration's
objections.
   Meanwhile, civil rights leaders demonstrated in front of the
White House and sought a meeting with Bush in a last-ditch effort
to persuade him to sign the bill.
   ``We are asking that, before he makes a decision to veto it,
that he would meet with the civil rights leadership,'' said
Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP.
   He said that Bush had told him in a telephone conversation
Thursday that he was exploring possible ways to avoid a veto,
including passage of follow-up legislation to soften his objections
to the main bill.
   Hooks suggested that civil rights leaders were not willing to
endorse any compromise that would water down the legislation. But,
he said ``there is room for hope'' that Bush might reverse himself
and sign the bill.
   Fitzwater said, ``The president certainly wants a strong civil
rights bill. He is committed to it. Let's erase this legal question
and make it a true civil rights bill.''
   He hinted that Democratic sponsors of the civil rights bill that
passed Congress were more interested in playing politics with the
issue than in ironing out differences with the administration.
   ``There's been nothing to change our belief that it's a quota
bill. The only issue is, is there any way to get it changed at this
late date in a way that will be satisfactory,'' Fitzwater said.
   Hooks was among several hundred chanting demonstrators who
gathered outside the White House.
   White House congressional liaison Frederick McClure greeted them
at the gate, then escorted a small delegation onto the grounds,
where he accepted the demonstrators' written request for a meeting
with Bush.
   Demonstrators held aloft a large banner that said: ``Mr.
President, Sign the Civil Rights Bill.''
   Hooks said the demonstrators represented ``civil rights
organizations from all over the nation, women's groups, Hispanic
groups, from the Jewish community, from the black community and
from the liberal Republican groups.''
   ``The consequences of a veto is that President Bush will not be
living up to his promise of representing all the people, and that
gentler, kinder nation that we were looking for will not come to
pass,'' Hooks said.

<HEAD>Activist, Anti-War Berkeley Class of 1970 Comes Back to Graduate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of California at Berkeley
class of 1970 carried signs and burned flags to protest the Vietnam
War. Saturday, they'll return to formally graduate 20 years late.
   ``I've always felt that I was denied some right of passage
because we didn't have a graduation ceremony,'' Ken Sherman, a
Beverly Hills literary agent, said Friday.
   ``They were afraid we would use it as a forum for protest and
agitation. And I'm sure we would have.''
   In May 1970, tensions were high on the campus as students
stepped up their anti-war protests when President Nixon sent troops
into Cambodia.
   Earlier that month, on May 4, four students were killed by
National Guardsmen during a war protest at Kent State University in
Ohio.
   California Gov. Ronald Reagan reacted to the Ohio killings by
ordering the Berkeley campus shut down for two days. With
graduation only weeks away, students and faculty began to plan
protests they intended to stage at graduation to protest violence
against activists.
   ``There was a very tense and unusual atmosphere on the campus at
that time. It was like it was under siege,'' said Ray Colvig, a
spokesman for the university now and then. ``There was a threat
that commencement might be boycotted or that there would be a large
demonstration.''
   Hoping to avert trouble, Chancellor Roger Heyns canceled
commencement exercises at Berkeley's Memorial Stadium, where 3,300
students were to graduate. Instead, the school's academic
departments held their own small ceremonies, a tradition that
continues today.
   ``I didn't know about the small ceremonies we were supposed to
have, so I missed out,'' said Sherman, who will speak at Saturday's
ceremony. ``I have always felt that I had unfinished business.
Taking part in commencement will be a closure of sorts, an ending
of part of my life.''
   The ceremony was the idea of Class of '70 member Carol Orsborn,
who suggested it to the alumni association last year. The
association organized the event. More than 200 people from the
class are expected to attend.
   ``Our generation went to sleep for a while,'' said Orsborn, who
once gave up her Phi Beta Kappa key in a protest.
   ``But I don't think idealism is dead, but maybe it's been
dormant in a lot of us,'' she said. ``Somehow, I think that this
graduation ceremony will give us back some of that feeling.''
   Orsborn has a San Francisco public relations company and a
family. Her two children will attend commencement with her.
   Orsborn is author of ``Enough is Enough: Exploding the Myth of
Having it All.'' The 1985 book shot down the notion that women with
careers and families needed to be superwomen, working at the top of
their fields while performing as perfect mother and wife.

   House and Senate negotiators approved a
compromise bill Friday protecting additional acres from timber
cutting in the massive Tongass National Forest in Alaska.
   But the agreement, which is expected to be approved by the two
chambers, didn't go as far as environmentalists had wanted.
   The Tongass, stretching across nearly 17 million acres of the
Alaska panhandle, is the world's only remaining temperate zone rain
forest and home to a rich array of wildlife including grizzly bears
and bald eagles. It also is a major source of timber.
   ``Half a rain forest is better than no rain forest at all,''
said George Frampton Jr., president of the Wilderness Society,
adding that he would have preferred a bill much more restrictive to
timber interests.
   ``With the Congress about to adjourn we were forced to take it
or leave it,'' said Frampton.
   The legislation declares about 1 million acres off-limits to
timber harvesting and creates off-limits buffers 100 feet wide
along rivers and streams important to fishing. The House
legislation would have protected nearly twice as many acres from
timber cutting.
   The legislation made a number of changes in the management of
the forest and timber sales by the U.S. Forest Service.
   Environmental groups for years have criticized practices
required by 1980 legislation, and have argued that in some years
the Forest Service netted only 2 cents from timber sales for every
$1 of expenditures.
   The bill requires the Forest Service to prepare only enough
timber for sale to meet ``market demand'' instead of the automatic
450 million board feet annually specified in existing law. It also
eliminates the automatic appropriation of $40 million for timber
management, requiring that the forest compete with others federal
forests each year for funds in the normal budget process.
   In Juneau, meanwhile, Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper welcomed the
agreement, calling it a ``compromise (so that) Alaska's timber
industry can remain healthy while the environment and other uses of
the forest can be protected.''
   He said under the forest management program and modifications in
timber contracts ``abuses of the past will be minimized and
management of the forest will be improved.''
   ``Southeast Alaskans who are directly affected can finally
breathe a sigh of relief that this issue is behind us after so many
years,'' said Cowper in a statement.
   Mike Francis, a forestry expert for the Wilderness Society, said
that while the changes are welcome they will not necessarily reduce
the amount of timber cut in the Tongass.

<TEXT>
   Salvadoran guerrillas have
begun a diplomatic offensive and increased their military activity,
hoping the mixture will bring progress in stalemated peace talks
with the government.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, began
meetings Thursday with Latin American and European governments. The
night before, rebels attacked the base of El Salvador's air force
on the eastern edge of the capital, damaging several helicopters.
   Rebel spokesmen said the actions were intended to bring movement
in peace talks with the government of President Alfredo Cristiani.
Monthly talks began last spring but have not progressed
significantly toward ending the decade-old civil war that has
claimed about 72,000 lives.
   Salvador Samayoa, a member of the FMLN's diplomatic policy
commission, said in Germany on Thursday that the military activity
is part of a strategy ``to push along the negotiations process.''
The next round is to begin Nov. 4 in Mexico City.
   Each side accuses the other of inflexibility and negotiating in
bad faith.
   A key sticking point is a rebel demand that the army be reduced
and that officers responsible for human rights abuses be purged.
   The army has agreed in principle to clean its ranks but says it
will do it itself without outside participation.
   At the U.N. General Assembly this month Cristiani offered a
unilateral cease-fire if the FMLN would do the same.
   The rebels said they would not lay down their arms without
resolving the causes of the war - social injustice and military
impunity.
   The rebel Radio Venceremos, commenting Friday on the air force
attack, said ``the operations of the last hours also are a clear
signal to the American government and to some congressmen who want
to referee the conflict using the blackmail of military aid.''
   The Senate voted Friday to halve El Salvador's expected $85
million military aid, but stipulated the aid would be restored if
the rebels walk away from the peace talks.
   ``If the Salvadoran and U.S. governments really want to end the
war, then we say it's up to them at the negotiating table,'' the
rebels said. ``Let's talk about the causes of the war and arrive at
agreements. Then we can achieve not only a cease-fire, but a
definitive peace.''
   The government hopes the FMLN will be weakened politically by
the collapse of patron governments in Eastern Europe. The left
holds out hope that the end of the Cold War will allow
anti-Communist governments to see that El Salvador's often brutal
armed forces are to blame for the country's woes.
   Defense Minister Col. Rene Emilio Ponce attributed the increase
in activity to internal divisions within the FMLN, which
incorporates five rebel armies.
   ``Within the FMLN there are people who agree to solving the
conflict through dialogue and negotiations, but there is another
group, possible the largest, that is for a military solution,'' he
said.
   The guerrillas deny they are divided over strategy.

   A Defense Department satellite to be carried

strategic and tactical reconnaissance information from the Persian
Gulf region, says a report to be published Monday.
   The satellite will orbit at 460 miles altitude, far lower than
the usual military spacecraft which are placed in a path 22,300
miles above Earth, Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine says
in the Oct. 22 edition.
   A satellite orbiting at 22,300 miles will remain over one spot
on the earth's surface, making such an orbit ideal for
communications satellites.
   Atlantis' mission, like all Defense Department shuttle flight,
is secret. The date for liftoff has not been set, pending a test
for fuel leaks scheduled for Wednesday.
   Aviation Week said the satellite weighs 22,000 pounds, making it
one of the heaviest military payloads to be put in space. It will
have digital cameras and other sensors which will focus on the
Persian Gulf region, the magazine said.

<TEXT>
   Jeffrey MacDonald, the Green Beret doctor
convicted more than 20 years ago of killing his wife and two
daughters, deserves a new trial because of suppressed government
evidence, his attorneys said Friday.
   Lawyer Harvey Silverglate said in court papers that private
investigators turned up forensic notes and testimony about an
alleged confession by a one-time suspect that could clear
MacDonald.
   ``This evidence was in the government files and not disclosed to
the judge, nor to the jury, nor to MacDonald,'' Silverglate said.
   Silverglate, from Boston, said the evidence was found in Army
records. Notes by forensic investigators refer to long, blond hairs
found in a hair brush and black wool fibers found in the mouth and
hand of MacDonald's wife, he said.
   It was at least the third time this year Silverglate announced
that suppressed government evidence had been found, but it was the
first time a motion was filed in federal court.
   MacDonald, a Princeton-educated Army doctor, was convicted in
1979 of the bludgeoning and stabbing deaths of his pregnant wife,
Colette, and two small daughters, Kimberly and Kristen, at their
Fort Bragg, N.C., apartment in February 1970.
   MacDonald has maintained he and his family were attacked by
three men accompanied by a woman with a floppy hat, blond hair and
boots. He said the woman chanted, ``Acid is groovy, kill the
pigs.''
   MacDonald, 47, is serving three consecutive life sentences at
the Terminal Island federal penitentiary in San Pedro, Calif. He
was transferred there from a Phoenix prison three years ago to be
near his mother, who is in poor health.
   The trial drew widespread attention. Author Joe McGinniss wrote
a best-selling book, ``Fatal Vision,'' about the case in 1983. The
book was made into a television movie. McGinniss concluded
MacDonald was guilty.
   The case has taken many twists through the legal system. The
U.S. Supreme Court turned down several motions for retrials.
   Silverglate said that after filing Freedom of Information Act
requests, private investigators were allowed to examine the Army's
records and found notes written by forensic investigators who
examined the MacDonald home shortly after the murders.
   The notes referred to the blond hairs from the hair brush and
fibers found in the mouth and hand of Colette MacDonald,
MacDonald's wife, Silverglate said.
   Silverglate is one of the attorneys who won an acquittal for
Claus von Bulow, who had been convicted of killing his wife in
1982.
   A one-time suspect in the case, Helena Stoeckley, a chronic drug
abuser, allegedly confessed to the crimes to various people on
several occasions. The testimony of those people to whom Ms.
Stoeckley allegedly confessed was not allowed during the trial.
   Ms. Stoeckley testified during MacDonald's trial that she often
wore blond wigs and black clothing. She died in 1983.
   James Blackburn, the former U.S. attorney who prosecuted
MacDonald, said officials did not suppress evidence.
   ``I'm not aware of any evidence that was ever suppressed by the
government or any evidence that was kept from the defense to which
they were lawfully entitled,'' Blackburn said.
   MacDonald was convicted on the basis of a fiber-and-blood
reconstruction of the crime because there were no witnesses and no
definite motive could be established.

   Canada has suspended operations at its besieged
embassy in Kuwait and the five Canadians who kept things going
there arrived in Baghdad on Friday night, External Affairs Minister
Joe Clark said.
   He said the three diplomats and two wives were tired but well,
and commended them for their work under trying circumstances for
nearly two months.
   Clark said the embassy is not officially closed and that this
did not mean Canada recognized Iraq's claim to Kuwait.
   Iraqi forces cut off electricity and water to foreign compounds
in Kuwait, which President Saddam Hussein claims as Iraq's 19th
province.
   The five Canadians, led by charge d'affaires William Bowden,
left Kuwait City with an escort Friday morning in three cars. The
trip took 10 hours.
   The diplomats planned to stay with staff from the embassy in
Baghdad.
   The Canadian action occurred the same day a report was published
in Iraqi newspapers saying all foreigners in Kuwait must register
with local authorities before Nov. 5 or face a fine and punishment.
   Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2 and four days later said it had
annexed the oil-rich nation. Saddam ordered embassies in Kuwait
closed.
   The Belgian and German embassies in Kuwait closed Oct. 12, and
the Dutch, Italian and Polish embassies withdrew their last
diplomats from Kuwait City in the week before that.
   Although only the British, French and U.S. embassies now remain
open, most nations still recognize Kuwait as a separate nation.
   The U.S. Embassy maintains about 10 diplomats led by Ambassador
W. Nathaniel Howell. An unknown number of American private citizens
also have taken refuge there.
   About 600 Americans are stuck in Kuwait, some in hiding and
several reported to be desperately ill.
   The American diplomats have been surviving mainly on canned food
and the occasional loaf of bread carried in by local staff.
   At the U.S. embassy, power and water are cut. The Americans must
forgo baths and boil water form the swimming pool to drink. They
use outdoor latrines and sometimes sleep outdoors to keep cool,
despite the swarms of mosquitoes.

   Martha ``Sunny'' von Bulow's children
say they are outraged by ``Reversal of Fortune,'' the movie that
portrays their mother as a sloppy drunk obsessed with drugs before
she slipped into a coma.
   ``Our mother ... is unable to respond to an assault on her
character and reputation,'' Ala Isham and Alexander Auersperg said
in a statement. Isham and Auersperg haven't seen the movie, but
read an early copy of the screenplay, their spokeswoman, Maureen
Connelly, said Friday from New York.
   The heiress has been in an irreversible coma in New York since
1980. Her husband, Claus von Bulow, was convicted, then retried and
acquitted of twice trying to murder his wife at their Newport
mansion.
   The movie, starring Glenn Close as Mrs. von Bulow, focuses on
von Bulow's successful appeal after the first trial. It is based on
a book of the same name by Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz,
who masterminded the appeal.
   The film portrays Mrs. von Bulow, who serves as the narrator, as
a heavy drinker and a drug user who would resort to hiding her
drugs so those around her couldn't destroy them.
   Isham and Auersperg said their mother was shown ``as pathetic
and self destructive.''
   ``We reject this injurious and erroneous portrayal and ask the
public to do the same in the knowledge that our now defenseless
mother was warm and caring and devoted to her family,'' they said.
   Isham and Auersperg, who believed in their stepfather's guilt,
filed a $56 million civil lawsuit against von Bulow after his
acquittal, claiming he tried to kill their mother to inherit her
money.
   The lawsuit was settled out-of-court in 1987 with von Bulow
agreeing to divorce his wife and renounce all claims to her vast
fortune. His share of her estate was estimated at $25 million.
   The divorce has not been finalized, Connelly said, because Von
Bulow has not filed, as he agreed he would in 1987. Connelly said
it would require a series of complex legal maneuvers for Sunny's
guardians to dissolve the marriage on her behalf.
   Von Bulow also agreed to give up any rights to book or movie
deals about the family infighting.
   Von Bulow could not be reached for comment Friday at his London
apartment.
   As part of the settlement, Cosima von Bulow, the only child the
couple had together, agreed to drop two countersuits. She received
an equal share, $35 million, of her maternal grandmother's estate
in return.
   Jeremy Irons plays von Bulow in the movie. Ron Silver plays
Dershowitz. ``Reversal of Fortune'' opened in New York on Wednesday
and will open elsewhere in November.

<HEAD>Panama Asks Venezuela to Extradite Noriega's Defense Forces Chief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Panama on Friday asked Venezuela to
extradite a former military commander charged in the murder of a
critic of former dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Dr. Hugo Spadafora, a popular supporter of various Central
American causes and a critic of Noriega's government, was found
slain near Panama's border with Costa Rica in 1985. His body showed
signs of torture and had been decapitated.
   The Panamanian Foreign Ministry is seeking the extradition of
Col. Roberto Diaz Herrera for trial as an ``accomplice in homicide,
criminal association, crimes, abuse of authority and cover ups,''
lawyer Julio Berrio said.
   Diaz Herrera was the chief of staff of the Panama Defense
Forces, which Noriega headed. The PDF was disbanded by the United
States after it invaded Panama in December and ousted Noriega, now
jailed in Miami awaiting trial on drug charges.
   Diaz was detained for unrelated reasons in 1987 - after accusing
Noriega of murder and corruption - and since 1988 has been living
in Venezuela.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Southern Command in Panama announced Friday
it was investigating a break-in at an ammunitions bunker at Rodman
Naval base.
   The Southern Command said the break-in was discovered Wednesday,
the day before Panamanian authorities announced they had smashed a
military coup plot. It wasn't known if the two events were related.
   ``A thorough investigation of contents is currently under way to
determine whether anything has been stolen,'' the Southern Command
said.
   News reports said weapons and mines were taken.
   Attorney General Rogelio Cruz on Thursday accused retired Col.
Eduardo Herrera and his brother, Capt. Francisco Herrera, of
planning to take over military installations in a coup attempt.
   Eduardo Herrera was the first head of the Public Forces, the
national police force set up to replace the PDF after the U.S.
invasion. His brother is retired and lives in Miami. Neither has
been arrested.
   The Herrera brothers are not related to Col. Diaz Herrera.

   Two men were injured Friday when a truck
hurtled into the cafe where they were having breakfast, knocking
them from their seats in a shower of glass.
   ``I just heard the crash and watched the bumper,'' said Robert
Rasmusson of Minot.
   Rasmusson, 31, and Thomas Krebsbach, 38, of Max were in a booth
in Barb's Cafe when the accident happened.
   Walter St. Croix was driving his truck through a nearby
intersection when he swerved to avoid another driver, police say.
The driver, Jennifer Crooks, 18, of Minot was ticketed for
allegedly running a red light.
   St. Croix's truck went over the curb and into the cafe, crashing
through the front window.
   The truck stopped when it hit a supporting pillar inside the
restaurant, police officer Jason Olson said.
   ``We kind of went underneath (the truck) and were pushed
along,'' Rasmusson said.
   St. Croix, 54, Minot was not hurt. Rasmusson and Krebsbach
suffered minor injuries.

   Soviet gross national product dropped 1.5 percent
in the first nine months of 1990 while consumer prices rose 5.6
percent, signs of what the official news agency called a
``deepening crisis.''
   Tass reported the statistics Friday, the same day the national
legislature approved a plan to move to a more market-oriented
economy over the next few years.
   ``The (statistics) statement says the situation results from
looser control of the economy, disruption of economic links and the
worsening of discipline,'' Tass reported.
   The statement said total industrial output declined .9 percent.
The jobless rate stood at 2 million people, although Tass did not
report a percentage change or give a comparison with 1989.
   The statement said inflation stood at 9 percent for the
nine-month period, but incomes grew an average of 14.4 percent.
   The statement said food production was up 1.4 percent over the
same period last year.
   But it added that ``the production and procurement of certain
kinds of farm produce dropped. The grain harvest has not been fully
collected in a number of regions.''

   The suspected ``Bikerbank'' bandit accused of
at least 22 bank robberies was ordered jailed for 15 days while
police continue their investigation, Israel army radio said Friday.
   The robber, who reportedly fled heists on a red-and-black
motorcycle, has become a folk hero among some Israelis for his
ability to elude police for nearly two years.
   The suspect, arrested earlier Friday in the Tel Aviv suburb of
Ramat Gan, was ordered held by the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court,
according to radio reports.
   Under Israeli law, suspects are remanded into custody until
police complete their investigation and decide if charges will be
brought.
   The court ordered a ban on publication of the suspect's name and
picture until police finish their questioning.
   But before the ban was issued, media reports said the suspect
was 37 years old, married and came from a ``very wealthy'' family
in Ramat Gan. Some reports said the man fell into debt after he
built a $1 million home.
   During the past few months, the motorcycle bank robber has been
the subject of prime-time television reports and series of articles
in daily papers. News reports say his loot totaled about $150,000.
   Israel army radio said police searched his home and found two
pistols, an air rifle and letters to his family apologizing for his
crimes.

<TEXT>
   Lebanese military intelligence sources
said Friday that Moslem extremists last week transferred the
American and British hostages they are holding from Beirut's
southern slums to east Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
   The switch was made before government troops and the Syrian army
launched a joint attack Saturday that ended the 11-month rebellion
by Gen. Michel Aoun in the Christian heartland northeast of the
capital, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A source reported, ``We believe they are now held in Sheik
Abdulla barracks in Baalbek and in the nearby village of Nabi
Sheet, but we do not know who, or how many, are held in either
place.''
   One source said the Syrians had to know of the move, since they
control the roads from Beirut to the Bekaa, ``but we do not know
whether they had any role in it.''
   The sources said those transferred included the six Americans
held and Britons Terry Waite, the Anglican Church envoy, and
journalist John McCarthy.
   Two other Britons, two West Germans and an Italian also are
held.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The
Associated Press, is the longest held. He was abducted on March 16,
1985.
   The Saturday attack came from three directions. One was the
Shiite Moslem southern slums, a power base of the Iranian-backed
fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella of Shiite zealots
holding most of the hostages.

   Hubert de Givenchy's summer ready-to-wear show
Friday burst out with lovely and wearable styles. This past master
of couture made the luxury clothes look very expensive, which they
are.
   It was a gilded collection, featuring gold threads in the first
knit items right through gilt nailheads all over, plus gold lame
shining through the colorful silk print dinner dresses at the end.
   On a new youth kick, the man who invented Audrey Hepburn's best
``gamine'' styles for her films more than 30 years ago gives his
latest styles modern updates. Among the youngest: a strapless
cable-knit top with a shortie black tulip-wrap skirt rimmed in gold
button details.
   His ballooning silky harem pants looked refreshing this week.
Everybody else is showing pants that look as though they'd been
molded on the model.
   Givenchy showed many well-cut straight trousers with good
cardigan and cable-knit tops, or jackets cut long and straight or
rather full. The fine poplins, linens and plenty of gold buttons
should please the rich set of a certain age.
   Younger fans will like his airy organza dresses and
off-the-shoulder minis in harlequin or bold fruit and flower
prints.
   The serpent theme gliding through a few collections here looks
gaily-colored on bright leather belts, narrow skirts, sleeve
details.
   Karl Lagerfeld also aims for younger looks, continuing his leggy
themes with good jackets and loose tops he started last year.
   Some of the best of this slim-leg look topped by flowing jackets
or cape effects came out in silky jersey fabrics in colors ranging
from subtle linden green or beige to salmon.
   Lagerfeld's pants are cigarette-slim, or simply cotton tights.
The young, but not very flattering, favorite style is to cut off
the dark tights at various lengths along the leg, showing bootees
below.
   Lots of ideas popped up from little apron outfits with shirred
waists right through to plaid jackets of all lengths and cuts worn
over the tights with matching plaid small boots.
   Bright piping on asymmetrical little dresses or sleeveless white
jackets had a certain young charm, along with the buttoned plastron
effects over short linen dresses in bright red or sky blue.
   Lagerfeld also went in for some graphic and check effects, using
checked sheer wraps over maillot bathing suits, and sequined
checkerboard decor for the evening wear in trapeze topped minis or
slinky sheaths.
   Bernard Perris also went all-out for graphic prints and sequined
late-day wear, in minis, long pants, and easy toppers.
   This designer has a raft of summer ideas, ranging from lace-up
safari styles to neon-striped graphics and body-molding leather
outfits in hot shades of vermilion, bright blue and cyclamen.
   His luscious sheer white embroidered blouses with tight sequined
black pants and gold belts evoked a brassy pirate set to swing at
the disco.
   Thierry Mugler put on a show worthy of a striptease nightclub,
but not all went smoothly.
   Danielle Mitterrand, wife of the French president, and Culture
Minister Jack Lang were among those who waited nearly two hours in
sauna-type heat waiting for the show to begin.
   Before Mugler wound up with a nearly nude Diana Ross (with
chunky glass just decently covering the strategic points and a
fuchsia tulle cape), he'd brought out several other Imam and other
famous models, clothed in outrageous costumes.
   It was mainly lycra and skin, plus a few little bunnies in
bloomer-playsuits, and even a Chinese-lantern outfit in acid shades
of pink and green.
   The rare true dress or suit was applauded, in one case a
pleasantly draped white sheath as worn by famed model of the 1970s,
Lauren Htton.
   Another audience came back later to see Madonna swan down the
catwalk. But most observers agreed: Mugler should either make
clothes and show them as such or take up showbiz as his real
profession.

   Twenty crewmen of a Portuguese

freighter collided off southern Morocco, a Spanish navy spokesman
said.
   He said the Greek vessel, the Ionian Wind, rescued 10 of the
Ihla de Sao Vicente's crew from the sea after the collision late
Thursday 240 miles south of Grand Canary Island. The trawler was
badly damaged, he reported, adding that low visibility was one
apparent factor in the ship crash.
   The Ionian Wind searched for the missing sailors, joined by
eight nearby ships and by Spanish airplanes on Friday, the
spokesman said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The fishing boat was headed home to northern Portugal when the
accident occurred in northwestern African waters.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Plan to Freeze Hindu-Moslem Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government, trying to defuse a
Hindu-Moslem dispute that has claimed scores of lives, proposed
Friday to allow Hindus to build a temple at a sacred site without
destroying a mosque already there.
   But Hindu traditionalists rejected the plan, which was unveiled
at the end of a frantic day of meetings and two sessions of Prime
Minister V.P. Singh's Cabinet.
   Singh's government is under threat of collapse if no solution to
the conflict is found by the end of the month.
   The dispute concerns a 16th century mosque in the holy town of
Ayodhya. Hindus say it was built on the foundations of a temple
over the traditional birthplace of the Hindu god Rama.
   A fundamentalist group, the Hindu World Council, has vowed to
begin rebuilding the temple on Oct. 30. Moslems have said they
won't let that happen.
   Officials fear a bloodbath unless a settlement is found. Riots
between the two religious communities have claimed thousands of
lives over the decades, and violence over Ayodhya left more than 80
people dead earlier in the month.
   The secretary of the Hindu group, Ashok Singhal, said the
government plan was unacceptable because it left the mosque in
place.
   The government has said it will not allow the mosque to be
displaced, and has urged all sides to await the decision of the
courts on dozens of petitions.
   Police and paramilitary forces have sealed off Ayodhya, 300
miles east of New Delhi, and about 5,000 Hindu politicians and
activists have been detained.
   Information Minister Parvatheneni Upendra said the prime
minister's plan calls for the government to acquire properties
around the disputed site. Land would be made available for the
construction of a temple, while cases pending before a local court
could be transfered to the Supreme Court for quick handling.
Meanwhile, the mosque would stay.
   Upendra said the Bharatiya Janata, a right-wing Hindu party that
is a key government ally, had indicated it might support the prime
minister's plan. But a Bharatiya Janata leader denied that.
   ``It seems the government is more keen to assuage the sentiments
and protect the interests of the Moslem community with disregard to
the sentiments of tens of millions of the overwhelming majority,''
said party secretary J.P. Mathur.
   Lal Krishna Advani, head of Bharatiya Janata, has been leading a
6,000-mile pilgrimage to rally public opinion for the temple. Army
troops were deployed along the route of his caravan.
   Hindus comprise 82 percent of India's 880 million people, while
Moslems make up 12 percent of the population.

   Jurors who found two white teen-agers guilty
of the racially motivated drive-by slaying of a black man
recommended Friday that they go to prison for life with the
possibility of parole.
   The jury deliberated about six hours on the fates of Matthew
Faessel and Michael Stringer. The youths face formal sentencing
Nov. 21.
   Faessel, 19, and Stringer, 18, were found guilty of first-degree
murder Wednesday in the 1988 death of Tony Montgomery. Under Nevada
law, the jury had to recommend a sentence to the judge.
   Both teen-agers must serve at least 20 years before becoming
eligible for parole.
   Assistant District Attorney Ed Basl urged life in prison without
the possibility of parole for both teen-agers. He did not seek the
death penalty. The defense sought life sentences with possible
parole.
   Basl has maintained that Faessel and Stringer were white
supremacist skinheads who gunned down Montgomery, 27, in the font
yard of his sister's northeast Reno home because he was black.

   Observers from 18 countries will monitor
Pakistan's parliamentary election next week, U.S. organizers of the
effort said Friday.
   Asia, Africa, Europe and North and Central America are
represented on the 40-member team, which includes about 20
Americans and people from Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Poland, Namibia
and the Philippines, countries that themselves had international
observers at recent elections.
   Politicians, parliamentarians, regional specialists and others
on the mission will ``demonstrate the international community's
continued support for free and fair elections and democratization
in Pakistan'' and provide the world ``with an objective assessment
of the Pakistani electoral process,'' said the National Democratic
Institute for International Affairs, international arm of the U.S.
Democratic Party.
   It said the delegation is scheduled to arrive in Islamabad,
Pakistan's capital city, on Sunday, then separate into smaller
groups to visit polling places and counting centers throughout the
country on Wednesday, the day of the election. A news conference on
its findings is planned next Friday in Karachi.
   In addition to the United States, participatants come from
Bulgaria, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Egypt, the Gambia, Japan, Kenya,
Namibia, New Zealand, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Senegal, Sri
Lanka, Turkey, Britain and the African National Council, a major
black organization in white-ruled South Africa, the announcement
said.
   It noted that U.S. members include both Republicans and
Democrats.
   The institute recalled that it organized the 25-member
international delegation that monitored Pakistan's 1988 federal and
provincial elections, and that the team rated them as generally
free and fair and conducted in a process that ``compared favorably
with those used in other democratic countries.''
   It was the 1988 election that brought to power Pakistani Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was dismissed by Pakistani President
Ghulam Ishaq Khan in August and accused of mismanagement and
corruption. She and her Peoples Party have been campaigning
vigorously for parliamentary seats.

<TEXT>
   The president of Brazil's giant
state oil company Petrobras resigned Friday and accused the
government of keeping oil prices artificially low.
   Petrobras President Luis Octavio da Motta Veiga announced his
resignation at an afternoon press conference in the company's
headquarters in Rio.
   ``I turned in my resignation because ofthe bad conduct inside
the government regarding the pricing system for oil products,''
Motta said.
   He said the government was ``squeezing'' the company to keep
fuel prices low and avoid a renewed burst of inflation.
   ``This is a policy followed by this government and past
governmanets and it has never succeeded,'' Motta said. ``The
government is using Petrobras as a smokescreen to cover up for
economic problems.''
   Domestic fuel prices have been raised five times since the
Persian Gulf crisis broke out beginning Aug. 2 with the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait. The government last raised fuel costs by 20
percent on Oct. 9.
   Economists say the jump in oil prices poses a serious threat to
President Fernando Collor de Mello's Mar. 15 austerity plan to curb
four-digit inflation.
   Higher oil prices has helped push inflation up from 3.3 percent
in April to 9.6 percent in June, 10.5 percent in August and nearly
13 percent in September.
   Motta said Petrobras needed at least a 40 percent increase in
fuel prices to offset an internal deficit of $1.2 billion.
   He said the company's debt was rapidly mounting because
Petrobras was selling oil domestically for the equivalent of $20 a
barrel and paying $32 a barrel for low-grade imported oil.
   Brazil produces an average of 665,000 barrels of oil daily and
imports about 450,000 barrels a day.
   On Monday, Economy Minister Cardoso de Mello told a Senate
committee in Brasilia, the capital, that Petrobras was inefficient,
overpaid its workers, and withheld information about its costs in
order to win internal price increases.
   Motta was replaced early Friday evening by Eduardo Teixeira, the
No. 2 official in the Economy Ministry and a close friend and aide
of Cardoso de Mello, according to presidential spokesman Pedro Luiz
Rodrigues.

   A 13-year-old honor student was
sentenced Friday to 30 years in prison for fatally stabbing a
schoolmate 97 times, but the sentence will be evaluated when he
turns 17.
   Terrence, who was 12 when the slaying occurred, showed no
emotion when the verdict was read Thursday or when the sentence was
ordered.
   He will begin his sentence at a state youth facility. When he
turns 17, a judge will decide whether to release him or order him
to serve the rest of his sentence in a state prison.
   Terrence Sampson was convicted of murder in the December 1989
death of his next-door neighbor, Kelly Brumbelow, 13. He was tried
under a law allowing youths as young as 10 to be tried as juveniles
and adults.
   Kelly was found dead under a wood pile in the Sampson's
backyard.
   The two were honor students in the seventh grade at C.D. Fulkes
Middle School. Terrence played on the football team and Kelly was a
cheerleader.
   The boy's attorney, Chris Gunter, said he will appeal the
conviction.
   `Like I said in my closing arguments, no matter what the facts
are, he was just 12 years old at the time, and I really do question
whether he understood the concept of death,'' Gunter said.

   For the first time, the film version of George
Orwell's anti-totalitarian novel ``1984'' will be shown in the
Soviet Union.
   ``It's like breaking down the Berlin Wall,'' said Chicago lawyer
Marvin J. Rosenblum, executive producer of the 1983 movie starring
John Hurt and Richard Burton, who died a few months later.
   Orwell's bleak classic, depicting the world of Big Brother, was
aimed at any totalitarian regime, left or right, but it was often
read as an indictment of the Soviet system.
   Until last year, the book was banned in the Soviet Union.
   ``But people have read it under the covers,'' Rosenblum said.
``I've talked to a lot of Russians, and there's always been a lot
of interest in it. All the intellectuals are aware of it.''
   Rosenblum bought the rights to make the film from Orwell's widow
in 1980. It was shown in a score or more countries, but was
forbidden in what used to be the Eastern bloc.
   The movie will premiere in Moscow in early December or January
in conjunction with a conference on art and freedom of expression,
Rosenblum said Thursday. His next step is negotiating distribution
of the film throughout the Soviet Union.
   Rosenblum paid an undisclosed sum for rights to distribute the
film in the Soviet Union. The rights were owned by the British
company Virgin Vision, whose parent company put up the $8 million
to film the story.
   ``I took a calculated risk and decided the amount of money I was
paying for this was worth the milestone - just to see the
headlines, `1984 Premieres in Moscow,' '' he said.
   ``I'd like to make money on this. But if all that really happens
is that a significant number of Russians see the film, I would not
be unhappy,'' Rosenblum said.
   For the Moscow showing, Rosenblum said actors may read the lines
to the audience during the movie. He said he didn't know if
nationally distributed films would be dubbed or sub-titled.
   No political problems now exist in negotiating a distribution
contract in the Soviet Union, Rosenblum said. In the past, only one
agency had permission to import films.
   ``Now just about anybody can do it,'' Rosenblum said.

<HEAD>Final Ruling: Former Dictator Rios Montt Barred from Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALFONSO ANZUETO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An appeals court eliminated former
dictator Efrain Rios Montt from the Nov. 11 presidential election,
issuing a final ruling Friday that Rios Montt's past activities
disqualified him.
   The Court of Constitutionality said Rios Montt was ineligible
under an article of the constitution that bars anyone who came to
power in a coup from being elected president.
   Rios Montt, a retired general, lead a military junta after the
March 23, 1982, coup that overthrew elected President Fernando
Romeo Lucas Garcia.
   On June 9, 1982, he named himself president. In August 1983 he
was ousted in another military coup.
   Neither Rios Montt nor his supporters could be reached for
comment Friday night.
   The decision left a field of 12 candidates, most of them
rightists, running to replace President Vinicio Cerezo, a Christian
Democrat, whose term expires Jan. 14. The Constitution prohibits
Cerezo from running for another 5-year term.
   Rios Montt's bid for the presidency was first refused when he
tried to register Aug. 22, and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal
upheld that decision.
   But he was registered provisionally under a temporary injunction
issued while courts reviewed the case. The Supreme Court later
ruled him ineligible, but the Court of Constitutionality was the
final arbiter in the matter.
   Because the Constitution links an entire ticket to its
presidential candidate, the decision also bars Rios Montt's running
mate, Harris Whitbeck Pinol, and his three-party coalition's
congressional candidates.
   Rios Montt is backed by the National Unity Front, the
Institutional Democratic Party and the Guatemalan Republican Front.
   Rios Montt's law and order image at a time of increasing crime
and allegations of government corruption had given him a strong
position in some polls.
   While president, the born-again Christian general addressed the
nation in televised Sunday sermons and ordered crackdowns on
corruption.
   He also sent more than a dozen people before firing squads for
alleged involvement with leftist insurgents. Some were executed
during a visit by Pope John Paul II.
   A bloody military campaign against leftist rebels in the
northwest highlands under Rios Montt's regime killed thousands of
peasants, most of them Indians.

   This is not where a gubernatorial candidate
should prepare for his first debate with a powerful incumbent: Gate
76, lower level, Port Authority Bus Terminal.
   But there stood Republican Pierre Rinfret, clutching a $39.55
one-way ticket Friday morning.
   Rinfret, a millionaire economist running a cash-starved
campaign, glad-handed fellow passengers and the bus driver before
boarding a Greyhound bound for Syracuse and a showdown with Gov.
Mario Cuomo. Lack of party funds forced him to use mass transit, he
said.
   ``Is this a publicity stunt? Yeah, in part. But we're out of
money,'' said Rinfret. Three aides accompanied him on his excursion
north.
   So exactly how much money is left in the Rinfret warchest?
   ``We got a big check yesterday - $1,000. Now we've got $1,100 in
our account,'' Rinfret joked.
   Rinfret got a lot of mileage out of the stunt even before the
bus left. Four local television crews and a pair of radio reporters
showed up.
   His arrival in Syracuse several hours later and 30 minutes
behind schedule was less postitive. Striking Greyhound workers
greeted him with cries of ``Scab!'' and a sign reading ``Wrong Way
Rinfret.''
   The debate itself, to also feature Conservative Party candidate
Herbert London and Right-to-Life Party candidate Louis Wein, didn't
seem to excite Rinfret as much as his first bus ride since 1941.
   ``It's not a debate, it's a charade of a debate. I don't
consider Wein or London candidates. That's another charade,'' he
said. ``Cuomo is a ghost governor. He only shows up where he wants
to show up under certain conditions.''
   Rinfret, wearing a blue suit, appeared out of place as he
awaited the bus among the police, passengers and occasional
homeless person. He perked up when another rider recognized him.
   ``Mr. Rinfret,'' the woman said as he walked past.
   ``You recognize me!'' replied an exuberant Rinfret.
   ``I saw you on TV,'' she responded.
   The gubernatorial hopeful than shook hands with other
passengers, many of whom didn't seem to know who he was. Yet
Rinfret remained upbeat about his trip and his chances.
   ``I think you might see the best political overturn in this
century,'' said Rinfret. ``We are neck and neck with Cuomo in some
heavy Democratic areas.''
   Recent polls indicate Rinfret is more neck and neck with London
than Cuomo. But he glossed over those numbers.
   As with much of Rinfret's campaign, the Greyhound caper didn't
go off all that smoothly. The candidate almost boarded the wrong
bus; the right bus left 13 minutes late.
   But all ended well. Rinfret waved goodbye from a window seat.
   After the debate, Rinfret said he was being flown back to New
York City by Jefferson County Republican Chairman Ronald Trickey
aboard a private plane.

<HEAD>Faced With Loss of Liquor, Elks Lodge Asks To Allow Women</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Elks lodge faced with losing its liquor
license because of an ordinance banning discrimination by private
clubs is asking the all-male group's national leaders to admit
women.
   The Annapolis Elks Lodge 622 voted 48-3 Wednesday night to ask
the Elks national convention to change its bylaws to admit women.
   If approved by the national convention next summer, the change
would mean that every Elks lodge in the country could admit women,
said George Bond, Exalted Ruler of the Annapolis lodge. The issue
came up at the national convention of the 2,300-lodge fraternal
benevolent society two years ago and was defeated, he said.
   The new ordinance, effective Jan. 1, will deny liquor licenses
to private clubs with bylaws that discriminate on the basis of
race, gender or ethnic background.
   If the Annapolis lodge loses its liquor license, it might sue to
overturn the law or sell its building and move out of town, Bond
said.
   ``We like Annapolis,'' he said. ``We've been here 90 years. We
need the liquor license to sustain the lodge and our charitable
works.''
   Another organization, the Eastport Democratic Club, changed its
bylaws to admit women after the new ordinance was approved earlier
this year, but later denied membership to three women who applied.
That prompted a city alderman to consider tightening the law.
   The two clubs have no black members.
   To give the Elks lodge time to change its bylaws, Alderman Wayne
Turner has proposed delaying implementation until August 1991 for
clubs whose bylaws are set by natinnal memberships. The council's
rules committee is considering Turner's measure.
   The ordinance was approved in February on a close vote, 5-4.
Some city alderman who supported the measure don't object to
extending its implementation.
   ``As long as they're moving forward in good faith, I have no
problems with extending it,'' said Alderman Ruth Gray, who voted
for the ordinance.
   Alderman Carl Snowden, who sponsored the anti-discrimination
measure, lauded the Elks vote, but said his support of the
extension hinges on how seriously the club recruits black men.
   ``I very much would like to see a compromise struck with the
Elks lodge. If there is this good-faith effort I wouldn't have any
problem whatsoever in voting to amend the law,'' he said.
   Alderman Wayne Turner, who voted against the ordinance, said the
Eastport club is proof the law won't work.
   ``I don't believe anyone on the council believes in
discrimination,'' he said. ``But, it's a state issue, not a city
issue. Anyone who had a problem with the club should have went
through the state.''

   Here is the the 58-39 roll call by which the
Senate voted to reject administration-backed provisions on aid to
El Salvador.
   On this vote, a ``yes'' vote was a vote to support the
administration-backed amendment to the foreign aid bill that would
have restored the full $85 million in planned military aid unless a
cease-fre in the civil war there were achieved in 60 days. A ``no''
vote was a vote against the amendment, thus affirming the Senate's
earlier decision to cut the military aid by half.
   Voting ``yes'' were nine Democrats and 30 Republicans.
   Voting ``no'' were 44 Democrats and 14 Republicans.

<HEAD>Arson Suspected In Dorm Fire That Critically Injures Two Students</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators believe someone
deliberately set a fire that swept through a San Jose State
University dormitory on Friday, injuring 21 people.
   One student, unable to breathe because of the thick smoke that
filled Andrew Moulder Hall, jumped from a third-floor window and
suffered a back fracture but was in stable condition, authorities
said.
   Other students trapped by the flames that erupted shortly before
6 a.m. leaned out the windows, screaming for help as firefighters
set up ladders to rescue them. Fire crews led other students, still
clad in robes and slippers, down stairways to safety.
   ``My roommate and I heard this crackling noise and we opened our
door and smoke just gushed in our faces,'' said Anita Rich, one of
the 178 residents of the brick building. ``We couldn't see where we
were running. We just ran.''
   Fire officials said they suspect arson is to blame for the blaze
started on or near a couch on the third floor. They would not
discuss all the reasons for their suspicions but said one was that
the couch was not in its usual place.
   ``There appears to be a couch that was moved from one part of
the dormitory to another on the third floor. And according to arson
investigators, the couch was involved,'' said campus Police Chief
Ric Abeyta.
   The state fire marshal was investigating the fire at the
state-run university with 31,000 students about 40 miles south of
San Francisco.
   More than 30 firefighters put out the blaze in less than an hour
as paramedics took 21 students to three hospitals near the downtown
campus.
   Two male students were in critical condition with burns at Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center. Bryan Young, 20, had burns over 55
percent of his body, and Thomas Byrd, 18, suffered burns over 40
percent of his body, according to a shift supervisor at the
hospital.
   The university moved Moulder Hall students to vacant rooms at
nearby dormitories, sent counselors to the hospitals and set up a
hotline for families and friends to check on students.
   In the afternoon, they allowed Moulder Hall residents to return
to their rooms to retrieve their belongings. Most fled the burning
building in bathrobes, without keys, wallets or valuables.
   ``You just get out of there. You don't think,'' said junior Jana
Garrett, who wore a blue robe and fuzzy slippers.
   Students, most still groggy from sleep, were further befuddled
by thick smoke.
   ``It was pretty freaky. The hall was completely dark,'' said
Karsten Adam, who grabbed a gas mask he had hung on his wall as a
decoration before running down the hallway. ``I was thinking of
jumping out the window because there was so much smoke out there.''
   Moulder Hall was not equipped with sprinklers because it was
built in 1958, before they were required. But the dorm's fire alarm
system worked perfectly, university officials said.

   Republican gubernatorial candidate Pierre
Rinfret came out firing Friday in his first debate against
Democratic Gov. Mario Cuomo, saying the incumbent deserves a
``double F'' in economics.
   Rinfret's comment set the tone of the debate, which also
included Conservative candidate Herbert London and Right-to-Life
candidate Louis Wein.
   Rinfret, a millionaire Manhattan economist and former teacher
said: ``If Mario ever came into a class of economics of mine ...
I'd give him a double F. His numbers are the phoniest I've ever
heard.''
   Cuomo, seeking a third, four-year term countered, ``If ever I
came to your economics class, I shouldn't be flunked, I should be
committed.''
   The candidates were questioned by a panel of three reporters.
The debate, which had no audience, was taped for broadcast by
stations around the state over the next several days.
   Rinfret and London repeatedly attacked Cuomo's handling of the
state economy, noting New York's credit rating is at its lowest
ever and residents have just been hit with a record $1.8 billion
tax increase.
   ``It's not a bad idea for Mario to resign before he gets thrown
out in an election,'' Rinfret said.
   London said the state had ``a budget out of control.''
   Wein said if he couldn't be elected, he would prefer to see
Cuomo re-elected. He called Cuomo ``a man of decency and
intelligence.'' Wein's praise drew a sharp rebuke from Rinfret, who
pointed at Cuomo and said, ``This man is the enemy.''
   Cuomo accused the other candidates of using inaccurate
statistics when they criticized his tenure as governor.
   ``It's easy to answer these questions if you just make up
facts,'' Cuomo said.
   Cuomo has agreed to participate in only two debates. The other
is set for Nov. 4, two days before the election.
   Rinfret took a bus to get here from New York City to dramatize
his campaign's lack of funds, but he was to fly back in a private
plane provided by a GOP county leader.
   Rinfret had asked the Syracuse television station hosting
Friday's debate, WTVH, to pay airplane fare for him and a
half-dozen aides. The station refused.
   Leading up to Friday's debate, Cuomo has largely ignored his
rivals and concentrated on public appearances that stress his
record as governor.
   Cuomo said Thursday that he's never been a fan of debates.
   ``In a debate, it's a joke or who calls who a name,'' he
complained.

   House and Senate negotiators reached agreement
late Friday on an intelligence bill that would provide for a
suspension of covert lethal aid to rebels in Angola if the Marxist
government agrees to elections, sources said.
   The bill, agreed to after day-long talks between the two
intelligence committees, also would phase out a covert aid program
to Cambodian rebels and trim roughly $50 million from the
administration's $300 million request for aid to rebels in
Afghanistan.
   The changes reflect dwindling support on Capitol Hill for proxy
wars in the Third World that were a leading feature of President
Reagan's anticommunist crusade. With thawing relations between the
United States and the Soviet Union and reduction of Soviet support
of client groups, much of the rationale for U.S. involvement in
those conflicts has evaporated.
   On Angola, the committees agreed to provide that military aid to
the UNITA rebels - about half the total $60 million annual support
- could be suspended if the president certifies that the Luanda
government schedules free elections in which the rebels are free to
participate.
   But members deleted key provisions passed by the House earlier
this week that would have permitted Congress to make the decision
to suspend military aid if the president did not.
   On Cambodia, the roughly $13 million aid program for
non-communist resistance factions fighting the communist Phnom Penh
government would be ended early next year and converted to an open
program of humanitarian aid, the sources said.
   And aid to the mujaheddin rebels fighting the Soviet-supported
Afghan government would be cut by about $50 million, said officials
who spoke only on condition of anonymity. The cut was a compromise
between a Senate-passed $100 million cut and the full $300 million
the House adopted.
   The negotiators also left in place a House-passed provision that
would disburse the Afghan rebel aid in two six-month installments,
providing a point where aid could be ended at mid-year if
U.S.-Soviet talks result in a withdrawal of aid by both
superpowers.
   Also included in the compromise bill were changes that arose out
of the Iran-Contra scandal, including a new requirement that
presidential authorization for covert operations must be in
writing.
   Money for various programs covered by the bill is provided in
various parts, some of them secret, of the defense appropriations
bill. The sum spent for intelligence activities of all kinds is
believed to be about $30 billion.

   American Kevin Kenner won the top prize
awarded Saturday in the prestigious 12th International Frederic
Chopin Piano Competition.
   The jury awarded no first prize, apparently agreeing with the
audience that the competitors performed with technical skill but no
genius. Deliberations continued for three hours past the scheduled
announcement.
   Kenner, a San Diego resident studying in Hanover, Germany, was
awarded the silver medal with a prize of $2,100.
   ``I am happy and relieved,'' said Kenner, 27, as he was hugged
by his wife and his teacher in the lobby of the National
Philharmonic Hall, where the three-week competition was staged.
   Yukio Yokoyama, a 19-year-old Tokyo native studying in Paris,
won the third-prize bronze medal, with a prize of $1,575.
   Fourth places went to Corrado Rollero, 21, of Italy, and
Margarita Shevchenko, 23, of the Soviet Union. Fifth places were
awarded to Anna Malikova, 25, of the Soviet Union and Takako
Takahashi, 26, of Japan.
   The judges awarded no prizes for the best performance of a
Chopin mazurka or for the concerto. The award for the best
polonaise went to Kenner and Wojciech Switala, 23, who withdrew
from the third round after being the only Pole to reach the
semifinal.
   The competition has been staged since 1927 to honor Chopin, the
composer born in 1810 near Warsaw. He studied at the Warsaw
Conservatory but settled in Paris, where he gave his first concert
in 1831 and went on to use his romantic compositions to establish
the piano as a solo instrument.
   He never returned to his homeland but recalled Poland in his
polonaises and mazurkas. He died of tuberculosis in 1849 and was
buried in Paris. His heart, however, was interred in a Warsaw
church, and Poles embrace him as a national hero.
   The 12th staging of the competition by the Chopin Society in
Warsaw attracted nearly 140 competitors. The seven finalists
performed Chopin's concertos in E minor or F minor on Thursday and
Friday.
   The winner was to be announced by the jury at 11 p.m. Friday,
but was not presented until about 2 a.m. Saturday. Meanwhile, the
anxious contestants mingled with autograph-seekers and an
international audience of Chopin enthusiasts.
   Only one American has ever won the first prize, Garrick Ohlsson
in 1970, and none have placed second.
   Kenner, born 1963 in Coronado, Calif., studied with a
Polish-American teacher before attending the Peabody Conservatory
of Music in Baltimore.
   He called the judge's withholding of a first prize
``disappointing'' but ``very strange and very interesting.''
   He noted the competition is among the most prestigious for
pianists and has served to launch many careers.

   A man described by prosecutors as the single
biggest supplier of Southeast Asian marijuana to the United States
was sentenced Friday to 25 years in prison and fined a maximum
$6.25 million.
   Brian Daniels, 44, a New York native who lived in Thailand for
10 years, had pleaded guilty to smuggling tons of marijuana into
the United States from Southeast Asia between 1984 to 1988.
   The shipments included multi-ton deliveries to Seattle, Southern
California, Oregon, Nevada, Britis  Columbia and Mexico, according
to court documents. Among them was a shipment of 72 tons of
high-grade Laotian marijuana seized in June 1988 aboard the
Encounter Bay, an oil-supply vessel, off the Washington coast.
   ``Marijuana, regardless of what anyone feels about it, is
illegal and it makes you money,'' U.S. District Judge John
Coughenour said. ``You have to keep in mind there are a lot of kids
in this country affected by marijuana - and for whom the first step
to drugs is marijuana.''
   Prosecutors contended Daniels turned drug profits into $10
million in personal assets, none of which has been recovered by the
federal government.
   Daniels' lawyer, J. Williams Beard, said most of Daniels' assets
were in Thai real estate holdings and attempts to turn them over to
the U.S. government had failed. Beard said Daniels' first wife
holds the deeds to the property and refuses to surrender them.
   Under Thai law it is illegal for a woman married to a foreign
national to hold property, but the Thai government has not
cooperated in securing the assets, Beard said.
   ``I wish to assure your honor that I have no hidden funds or
assets stashed away for a rainy day,'' Daniels said during the
hearing.
   Daniels, who has eeen held in Pierce County Jail in Tacoma,
pleaded guilty last December to one count of operating a continuing
criminal enterprise. In September, Daniels pleaded guilty to two
counts of conspiracy that he earlier agreed would be part of the
plea package. They involved schemes to import 17 tons of marijuana
to San Diego and 42 tons of the drug to Reno.
   Daniels was sentenced by Coughenour to concurrent prison terms
of 25 years for the Reno conviction and 15 years for the San Diego
offense.

   Paint companies scrambled to alleviate
consumer fears Friday over reports that mercury in interior latex
paint can be harmful. Several of the companies said they have not
used mercury for years.
   The Environmental Protection Agency barred manufacturers from
adding mercury to paint after Aug. 20. Paint made before then can
still be sold, however.
   But the furor followed reports this week of a study that found
relatively high levels of mercury in people whose homes were
painted inside with latex paint containing mercury.
   The study, conducted in 1989, was published in Thursday's issue
of The New England Journal of Medicine. Concern about mercury in
paint arose last year after a 4-year-old Michigan boy suffered
mercury poisoning when his home was painted. He suffered severe
rashes, itching, sweating and a personality change.
   The EPA's 24-hour hotline for paint information - the National
Pesticide Telecommunications Network at 1-800-858-7378 - reported a
record 900 calls Thursday.
   A trade group for 550 manufacturers, including some of the
nation's largest, noted that paint used in the study and to which
the boy was exposed contained nearly three times as much mercury as
the EPA recommended at the time. The paint was made by the Mercury
Paint Co. of Detroit, Mich.
   ``It was almost certainly at the high end,'' said Marilyn
Ludwig, spokeswoman for the National Paint &amp; Coatings Association
in Washington.
   ``Vague directives'' led to the EPA declaring Mercury Paint's
mercury levels to be an ``unenforceable action,'' agency spokesman
Al Heier said.
   A telephone call Friday to Charles Soberman, president and owner
of Mercury Paint, was not immediately returned.
   Most uses of mercury were banned in the mid-1970s, except in
paint. Manufacturers had convinced the EPA they didn't have a good
alternative to mercury, Heier said. The element is used to preserve
the paint in the can and prevent mildew after application.
   The EPA estimates that before the recent ban, up to 30 percent
of interior latex paint contained mercury. But the industry
association believes just 10 percent to 15 percent contained the
element, Ms. Ludwig said.
   Consumers who own paint bought before the ban should call the
manufacturer to determine if it contains mercury, she said. If it
has more than 200 parts per million, she recommended using it only
outdoors.
   Health officials do not recommend removing latex paint from
walls. They believe the risk of mercury contamination is highest in
the first weeks after application. The mercury evaporates shortly
after the paint dries.
   Several manufacturers also criticized news reports as
misleading.
   Sherwin-Williams and Benjamin Moore, two of the nations largest
paint manufacturers, said their products haven't contained mercury
since 1973 and 1969, respectively.
   John Oberle, technical director for Montvale-based Benjamin
Moore, said alternatives to mercury that were less harmful to
people and the environment were employed in the mid-1970s, even
though they weren't as effective. Those alternative compounds have
since been improved, he said.

   Hurricane Nana weakened late Friday to a tropical
storm and forecasters expected it to slowly continue losing
strength as it remained nearly stationary in the Caribbean.
   Nana, which had been a minimal hurricane, had top winds of 70
mph, but still posed a threat to Bermuda.
   ``The storm is rather close to Bermuda and could still produce
tropical storm-strength winds on Bermuda,'' said Miles Lawrence at
the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables.
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT, Nana's center was located near 29.6 north
latitude and 66.2 west longitude, or about 200 miles
south-southwest of Bermuda.
   Nana, the eighth-named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
moved north-northeast near 5 mph and was expected to turn toward
the northeast Saturday.

   An attorney told jurors Friday they can
send a message to the racists of the world by returning a
multimillion-dollar verdict in a wrongful death lawsuit against a
white supremacist group and its leaders.
   Lawyer Morris Dees said in closing arguments that the evidence
was overwhelming against White Aryan Resistance founder Tom
Metzger, who is representing himself in court, as are his
co-defendants.
   ``We want you to come back with a verdict to tell ... the Tom
Metzgers of the world that this is not the way we run this
country,'' said Dees, whose clients are seeking $12.5 million in
damages.
   Metzger, 52, a television repairman from Fallbrook, Calif., is a
former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon. The lawsuit also names WAR and
Metzger's son John, 22.
   The suit accuses the Metzgers of inciting the November 1988
beating death of Mulugeta Seraw, 27, an Ethiopian who planned to
attend school in Portland. Seraw was attacked by three racist
skinheads as he returned home from a party. His head was split open
by a softball bat.
   Kenneth Mieske, Kyle Brewster and Steven Strasser pleaded guilty
to killing Seraw. Mieske and Brewster also are defendants in the
lawsuit.
   Seraw's family filed the lawsuit being heard in Multnomah County
Circuit Court before Judge Ancer Haggerty. Seraw's young son and
his father, who came from Ethiopia for the trial, sat in the front
row Friday.
   Tom Metzger was scheduled to give a closing statement Monday,
after which the case was to go to the jury.
   John Metzger, who heads the Aryan Youth Movement, a WAR spinoff,
told jurors the trial was a conspiracy between the plaintiffs and
the government.
   ``This whole thing is a joke,'' he said in a brief closing
statement. ``They want to destroy us because we're consistent.''
   ``I will continue what I'm doing because I'm right and I'm not
liable like they say,'' Metzger said.
   He complained to jurors that much of the testimony he and his
father wanted to introduce was ruled irrelevant.
   ``A lot of funny things went on in this courtroom that you'll
never know about and it's too bad,'' Metzger said.
   Dees aims to bankrupt WAR. He won a $7 million jury verdict
against the United Klans of America in 1987 after two Klansmen from
Mobile, Ala., killed a 19-year-old black man.
   Dees built his case against the Metzgers around the testimony of
Dave Mazzella, 21, a former leader in the Aryan Youth Movement.
Mazzella said the Metzgers sent him to Portland to organize
skinheads here and to teach them how to commit violence against
minorities.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
emissary to Iraq is calling on President Bush with assurances of
solid Kremlin support for tougher international sanctions aimed at
forcing Iraq out of Kuwait.
   U.S. officials said envoy Yevgeny Primakov stressed that Moscow
wants to keep working through the United Nations to reverse the
Aug. 2 invasion with political and diplomatic measures. Primakov
stopped in Rome and Paris this week on his way to Washington.
   Among the new steps under consideration are demanding
reparations from Iraq for what Secretary of State James A. Baker
III calls ``the rape of Kuwait'' and possibly an international
trial of President Saddam Hussein as a war criminal.
   The U.N. Security Council has banned virtually all trade with
Iraq, but after more than two months of occupying Kuwait the Iraqi
leader has not bowed to the pressure.
   ---&equals;
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - There is mackerel from China, sardines,
tuna and pineapples from Asia, olives from Morocco, butter cookies
from Denmark and grape juice from Austria. Even American hot sauce.
   The array of imported food available in Baghdad belies the U.N.
trade embargo imposed on Iraq in retaliation for its invasion of
Kuwait.
   But many of the items on grocery store shelves are from what
Iraqis call their 19th province - Kuwait, which was stripped of
consumer goods after the invasion.
   No one knows for certain whether Iraqis will ever feel the full
bite of the 11-week-old blockade, but it is changing how and what
they eat, and what they grow.
   But prices are rising beyond the reach of the common man in this
city of 4.5 million. A chicken lunch in an average restaurant costs
$15, and it is reported that such staples as wheat, milk, sugar and
tea are no longer readily available.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - After more than a month in jail, Charles H.
Keating Jr. won a bail reduction and headed home to prepare his
defense against the first criminal charges in one of the nation's
biggest savings and loan failures.
   U.S. District Judge John G. Davies ruled Thursday that the $5
million bail set by a state judge for the 66-year-old former thrift
operator was excessively high in the investment fraud case.
   Davies lowered bail to $300,000, and Keating's family posted it
by pledging their houses as security. Keating was released Thursday
night, smiling as he walked out of jail.
   Davies had heard an impassioned plea by Los Angeles lawyer John
``Jack'' Quinn, who has defended Keating against a slew of civil
charges stemming from the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association.

   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) - Colombia is trying to repair a judicial
system made powerless by drug traffickers, who often kill judges
and court officials they cannot bribe or coerce.
   President Cesar Gaviria, inaugurated Aug. 7, plans ``fortress
cities'' where judges can live and work free of intimidation that
presents them with a choice of ``plata o plomo'' - money or lead.
   ``The country's powerful crime organizations are leaving the
judicial system in complete impotence,'' said Fernando Carrillo,
judicial adviser to Gaviria.
   An elite corps of ``untouchables'' - specialized judges,
policemen and lawyers - is to be created and given constant
military protection.

   LONDON (AP) - The Liberal Democratic Party, derided by Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher just last week as a ``dead parrot,'' is
back in business after a stunning election upset over the
Conservative Party.
   ``The parrot has twitched,'' Conservative Party Chairman Kenneth
Baker said Friday of the Liberal Democrats' victory in a special
parliamentary election in the prosperous south England town of
Eastbourne.
   The town has been Tory territory for more than 70 years.
   ``Some dead parrot... It's given her a nasty nip,'' said the
Liberal Democrats' leader, Paddy Ashdown.
   The centrist party, whose most famous member is John Cleese of
``Monty Python'' fame, posted a huge 20.5 percent swing against the
government in Thursday's election to replace a Tory legislator
killed by the IRA.
   The Conservatives were burdened by voters' unhappiness over high
interest rates, health and welfare cuts and an unpopular new tax.

   TOKYO (AP) - When the heir to Japan's throne announced more than
30 years ago that he would wed a commoner, the nation's former
aristocracy lamented the end of an era.
   Already stripped of their titles by the Allied occupation forces
following World War II, they were being confronted with the end of
another birthright - supplying the throne with empresses.
   Michiko Shoda, the wealthy businessman's daughter who became the
first commoner to marry a future Japanese monarch, has since
brought a quiet revolution to an ancient and tradition-bound
institution. With the support of her husband, Emperor Akihito, she
has brought a secluded and often mysterious palace closer to the
people.
   Empress Michiko, who will be 56 on Saturday, will stand beside
her husband next month as he is formally coronated.

   BERLIN (AP) - The once-mighty Red army has fallen on hard times
in the new Germany. Its military mission is over, its presence is
resented by many Germans, and its soldiers are deserting in droves
to avoid going home.
   Once they were crack front-line troops in the Cold War. Now the
Soviet soldiers stationed in what was East Germany find themselves
a relic of a bygone era.
   Final withdrawal of the 600,000 troops and dependents is not
scheduled until 1994. Already, the strain is showing.
   The Soviet forces are a heavy financial burden for newly unified
Germany, now saddled with enormous costs of the merger.
   The Bonn government agreed to pay upwards of $800 million this
year to maintain the Soviets. Germany will also pay billions to
retrain and build new housing for the troops.

   CHICAGO (AP) - What began as a small conference of academic
radicals mushroomed into a weekend meeting of more than 1,000
activists and leftists - proof, organizers say, that the ethos of
the 1960s is alive and well.
   ``It's true that many of us are a little heavier around the
middle and losing hair,'' said Lauren Langman, 50, a conference
leader. ``But we're still here.''
   ``The radical left is still very much alive,'' agreed Carl
Davidson, 47, a former member of Students for a Democratic Society
and a conference organizer.
   ``Not all of us could marry Jane Fonda,'' he said, referring to
the actress' marriage to '60s radical Tom Hayden, now active in
mainstream California politics.
   A colorful band of political warriors - socialists,
environmentalists, feminists and others - registered for the
Midwest Radical Scholars and Activists Conference, which runs
through Sunday.

   MOSCOW (AP) - With popping flashbulbs, furs and limousines,
Hollywood made a classic entrance in Moscow on Friday night for the
Soviet premiere of ``Gone With The Wind.''
   The 1939 epic began an indefinite engagement in Moscow courtesy
of a British-Soviet joint venture and Ted Turner, the American
media mogul already known in the Soviet Union for his Cable News
Network and Goodwill Games.
   A Red Army band played outside the 2,500-seat Oktyabr theater
while moviegoers were treated to a yellow champagne-lookalike
before the opening. The VIPs got the real stuff, with caviar,
behind a guarded door.
   Hundreds of people jammed the sidewalk in front of the theater
on one of Moscow's main thoroughfares for a chance to view what
Turned called the American equivalent of Tolstoy's ``War and
Peace,'' another tale of lives torn asunder by a great war.

   Japan has conquered world market after world market
during its postwar economic resurgence, but its home-grown movie
industry is proving no match for ``Made in America'' films.
   Critics say rampant commercialism, self-censorship and shrinking
domestic audiences have badly damaged the Japanese industry and led
to mediocrity.
   But the biggest threat may be the popularity of American movies
in Japan, which has prompted Japanese investors to put their money
in Hollywood instead of local studios.
   ``The world has looked up to U.S. entertainment since the end of
World War II,'' says Bill Ireton, managing director of Warner Bros.
(Japan) Inc. ``To the Japanese, American movies are hip and trendy
and Japanese audiences would rather be dead than unfashionable.''
   Japan is the largest foreign market for U.S. films. American
movies accounted for 61 percent of all pictures seen here in 1989,
according to Ireton.
   The two top box-office draws last year among Japanese movies
were animated films. But even the No. 1 Japanese film, ``Kiki's
Delivery Service,'' brought in less than half the 4.4 billion yen
($32 million) earned by ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.''
   Akira Shimizu, a former critic who is general-secretary of the
Japan Film Library Council, says mediocre films are the result of
Japanese studios' emphasis on profit.
   Because quality movies cost more to make, he said, ``the old
masters who want to depict social problems have no opportunity to
make their films. ... It's a question of business.''
   There is more profit to be made targeting the largest
ticket-buying audience in Japan, women aged 18-25, with movies long
on romance, fuzzy animals and simplistic plots.
   Although Japan's four big movie studios are diversified and can
rely on profits from other pursuits, Shimizu believes the money
available to make quality movies won't increase.
   ``Such a golden age of Japanese films like the 1950s will never
happen again,'' he says.
   The film industry had its heyday in the 1950s and '60s, when a
young Akira Kurosawa was making such classics as ``Rashomon'' and
``Seven Samurai'' with Japanese backing.
   With 1.13 billion movie tickets sold, 1958 was the height of
Japan's postwar movie renaissance. But 10 years later, the
popularity of television had sent ticket sales slumping to 300
million.
   With the influx of videocassette recorders, the domestic movie
industry has been battered further, with only 143.5 million tickets
sold last year.
   For Japanese movie studios, there may soon be no business in
show business.
   Instead of boosting their own weak film industry, Japanese
investors have more faith in the ``Made in America'' stamp of
Hollywood. Japanese investors want popular American programming for
TV stations, cable companies, movie theaters and videocassette
ventures.
   Last year, SonyCorp. purchased Columbia Pictures Entertainment
for $5 billion. In September, Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.
confirmed it was conducting negotiations with entertainment giant
MCA, which owns Universal Pictures, in what reportedly would be a
$7 billion buy-out.
   Nomura Securities, electronics-manufacturer JVC Corp. and a
subsidiary of Pioneer Electronics Corp. also have invested in joint
ventures or U.S. companies involved in film production.
   An exception to this trend is a movie production and
distribution company set up earlier this year with 20 million yen
($146,000) by Suntory Ltd, which wants to create high-grade
Japanese films.
   A few directors such as Kohei Oguri, who won the silver prize at
the Cannes Film Festival this year, are making quality films with
their own money from commercial projects or funding from a few
large ``enlightened'' corporations such as Sony and Seibu,
according to Japanese film expert Donald Richie.
   And Shochiku Co., Ltd., one of Japan's major studios, has
decided to back Kurosawa's next film, ``Rhapsody in August,'' his
first picture with Japanese financing in two decades. The movie is
projected to cost about $10 million, considered too costly and
risky by most Japanese studios.
   Kurosawa has criticized a lack of freedom of speech in Japan,
suggesting self-censorship among filmmakers.
   ``Japan is supposed to be a place where there is freedom of
speech but if you try to deal with certain problems, you will not
get the money,'' he says.
   Filmmaker Noriko Sekiguchi got most of the funding for ``Senso
Daughters,'' a new documentary about terror and starvation in
Japanese-occupied Papua New Guinea during World War II, from the
Australian government.
   ``When the film was shown in France, Fiji and Australia,
Japanese diplomats told me it was interesting but that it should
only be shown in Japan to the Japanese. They told me I shouldn't
show the dirty side of Japan to others,'' Sekiguchi said.
   ``It's very difficult to really be open and speak your mind in
Japan. We have lots of movie technology, but the ideas and
philosophies behind good films are lacking.''

<HEAD>Kurosawa Gets Japanese Funding After 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICHIBU, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After 20 years, Japan is rediscovering a
native son -award-winning film director Akira Kurosawa.
   As he talks on the set of his next film, ``Rhapsody in August,''
it is hard to imagine that this smiling, soft-spoken man once
slashed his wrists in despair over the box-office failure in Japan
of one of his movies.
   ``I realize that Japanese audiences, compared to American
audiences, do not accept the kind of movies I am making, but it is
not because I am purposely making films for an American audience.
It is because of the level of the audience in Japan,'' Kurosawa
said.
   Kurosawa was accepted by Japanese studios and audiences from his
first film in 1941 until 1970. But since then he has been traveling
the world seeking funding for his film projects, despite winning
countless international awards, including two Academy Awards.
   ``I think when I talk about the low level of Japanese audiences,
what I really mean is that it is Japanese movie studios that head
the list of those incapable of appreciating good cinema,'' he said
in an interview.
   His Oscar-winning ``Dersu Uzala'' was funded and shot in the
Soviet Union, ``Ran'' was made with French money and last year's
``Dreams'' was backed by friend Steven Spielberg.
   Then came Kurosawa's honorary Academy Award last March in
Hollywood where he was lauded on stage by directors George Lucas
and Spielberg for lifetime achievement.
   Soon afterward, money flowed from an investment group headed by
Shochiku Co. Ltd., one of Japan's major studios, for his 29th
movie. ``Rhapsody in August'' is about the effect on one family of
the U.S. atom bomb attack on Nagasaki.
   So at age 80, Kurosawa has leaped into his next project instead
of spending his usual 5-year interlude combing the globe for
financing.
   ``The Academy Award showed very clearly how much the world
respects Kurosawa,'' said Toru Okuyama, co-chairman and chief
executive officer of Shochiku.
   ``As a Japanese filmmaker, I was bothered by the fact that he
has had to make his films with foreign capital,'' said Okuyama, the
producer of ``Rhapsody in August.''
   Although a cooling rainstorm rages outside the traditional
farmhouse Kurosawa has built for his set in rural Chichibu, inside
under hot lights Kurosawa's neon orange T-shirt is stained with
sweat. Perspiration runs down his face.
   Wearing a Greek fisherman's cap and dark glasses, he won't say
much about ``Rhapsody in August.'' He prefers that people see and
experience it themselves. But what most appealed to him about the
novel on which he based his screenplay was a heartwarming exchange
between an old woman and her four grandchildren.
   Kurosawa has added a Japanese-American character who comes to
Japan to meet his relatives. The part is played by Richard Gere.
   Although he tackled nuclear war in the 1955 ``I Live in Fear''
and in one of the vignettes in ``Dreams,'' Kurosawa says he wanted
to talk about the atom bomb again on a human level.
   ``There are so many ways in which we should be closer to
Americans and the issue of the atom bomb and nuclear war is one of
them. After all, we are all human beings,'' he said.

<HEAD>Old Soldiers Never Die, They Just Go to Cable</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You wouldn't consider the Discovery Channel or
the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network havens for shows about Things That
Go Boom.
   Two of the nation's biggest cable networks, they're places for
the performing arts, documentaries, science, nature and all that
good stuff, yes?
   Yes. But guess what? They're also a military buff's paradise,
offering shows that draw a large, mostly male audience, series that
one Discovery official says have been ``locomotives'' for his
network's schedule.
   The video winds of war come in three categories:
   - Grand old TV series about World War II, like ``Crusade in
Europe,'' or NBC's classic ``Victory at Sea.'' The latter, with its
memorable score by Richard Rodgers, was shown on A&amp;E in 1988, and
will return next year.
   A Rodgers score also is on ``Winston Churchill - The Valiant
Years,'' a 26-part ABC series of the early '60s in which Richard
Burton was the voice of Britain's wartime leader. It started its
second A&amp;E run this month.
   - Vietnam, specifically ``Vietnam - The Ten Thousand Day War,''
now on its second Discovery run, and A&amp;E's ``The Vietnam War With
Walter Cronkite,'' which starts repeats Nov. 14 as part of the
network's ``Our Century Series.''
   The Cronkite series, featuring CBS' Vietnam reports and footage,
was made in 1985 for the CBS-Fox Video programs sold in stores and
by mail.
   - Military things in general, typified by three series now on
Discovery: ``Wings,'' largely about military aircraft,
``Firepower,'' about weaponry new and old, and ``Carriers,'' about
the history of aircraft carriers.
   The last two are spin-offs of ``Wings,'' begun last year. Next
fall, ``Choppers,'' a 13-part history of helicopters, will join the
ranks, says Chuck Gingold, Discovery's senior vice president for
programs.
   Why so much history, particularly military history, on cable?
   Cost, says former NBC News president Reuven Frank - whose own
historical work will appear on cable Nov. 2 when A&amp;E shows ``The
Tunnel,'' his Emmy-winning 1962 NBC documentary about an escape
route dug beneath the then-new Berlin Wall.
   ``It's cheaper to run an old one than make a new one,'' Frank
says. ``Secondly, nobody in the United States is doing that kind of
stuff anymore.''
   Despite their supply of military history shows, neither
Discovery nor A&amp;E would qualify as The Armageddon Network.
   The war fare is only a portion of their daily offerings, which
range from ``Pasquale's Kitchen Express'' on Discovery to A&amp;E's
cablecast next month of a video version of ``Silas Marner.''
   But they ``do very well for us,'' says Brooke Johnson, A&amp;E's
programs vice president. ``For a while, they were inevitably among
our highest-rated programs. ... They're still unquestionably very
successful programs for us.''
   ``They've been locomotives for the schedule,'' says Gingold,
whose service is seen in 52.1 million homes. ``They've helped a
lot. The ratings are excellent.''
   And there's an odd thing he notes about the audience for
``Wings,'' a Discovery-repackaged series of documentaries from
various sources.
   The viewers aren't just a bunch of old and middle-aged fuds who
still can remember when fighter planes and even airliners had
propellers.
   ``We're getting the young male demographics,'' Gingold says.
``It's one of our youngest-skewing shows.''
   ``There's no question that there is a core group out there that
loves this stuff and will find it wherever it is,'' says A&amp;E's
Johnson, whose network is seen in more than 47.5 million homes.
   Military programs, in fact, were very helpful in getting A&amp;E
known to viewers in its early years, she says, because the
``historical stuff tends to appeal more to men, who tend to be
channel switchers.''
   Will the shows' popularity diminish in time?
   ``I don't think so,'' says Johnson. ``They have been very
popular for a number of years. ... I just don't see why they
wouldn't continue to be popular through the millenium. That's our
hope, anyway.''
   That may happen. But Frank, although speaking partly in jest, is
dour about the effect on future viewers.
   Networks no longer make historical series, he says, ``and all
you're going to get is recycled stuff. So in the year 2511, the
only history the kids will get is World War II. It'll end there.''

   ROCK AND JAZZ MEET IN LONDON and L.A.: Cable's Showtime network
tonight premieres a one-hour rock-and-jazz special, a two-city jam
session hosted by jazzman Herbie Hancock, who doubles as a player.
The special's London segment features the likes of Pete Townshend
and Bob Geldof, while the L.A. crew features Van Morrison, backed
by a band that includes jazz trumpeter Freddie Hubbard. The show is
the brainchild of producer-director Ken Ehrlich, whose
``Soundstage,'' a pop-and-jazz PBS series in the '70s, was one of
the best in the tricky art of televising music performances.

<HEAD>With More Private Sector Jobs, D.C.'s Economy More Subject to
Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GAITHERSBURG, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   J.S. Oberai still has his architectural
engineering job, and he's just bought a house in the suburbs. But
he's worried about the local economy, so he's selling his Porsche.
   At least he's trying to.
   ``I've had this car on the market for four months now,'' said
Oberai, who's asking nearly $11,000 for his 1984 model. ``It's
becoming rather difficult to sell right now - it seems people are
holding onto their money.''
   In the regions that are slipping toward recession, worrying
about selling a luxury car seems more whimsical than serious. But
in the Washington area, one of the wealthiest in America, it is a
sign of economic softness.
   The capital region has long been regarded as recession-proof,
largely because the biggest employer, the federal government, isn't
subject to the ups and downs that beset private companies. Unlike
auto workers, the area's 350,000 federal workers don't have to
worry about getting laid off in bad economic times.
   But the federal government's role in local employment is
shrinking. Less than 10 years ago, almost 26 percent of area
workers collected a federal paycheck; today, fewer than one in five
do.
   The makeup began to change during the economically robust 1980s,
when a number of private companies moved into the area or expanded
their operations here capitalize on a glut in government contracts.
   ``Washington is not as recession-proof as it used to be because
the mix of jobs has changed quite a bit,'' said Paul Getman, an
analyst at Regional Financial Associates, a Chester, Pa. firm that
monitors economic trends in different areas of the country.
   ``It used to be only a government town, but now you've had a
boom in the construction, service and retail industries, all of
which are suceptible to a downturn.''
   There's plenty of evidence of problems:
   - Several prominent local developers declared bankruptcy over
the summer, and others are on the edge of insolvency.
   - Garfinkel's, a venerable department store chain, went belly-up
over the summer. Ditto a chain of drug stores and the National Bank
of Washington, the city's second-largest.
   - Law firms are out recruiting bankruptcy specialists to fill
sudden gaps in their firms' talent roster.
   - Housing sales in the region fell 14 percent earlier this year
from the comparable period in 1989. Condominium sales slumped 24
percent.
   ``The economy clearly has slowed down, and the question of where
it bottoms out is what we don't know,'' said William Harris,
president-elect of the Greater Washington Board of Trade, the
region's largest business group.
   To put things in perspective, the area still has the nation's
highest median household income: $38,500. And while the national
unemployment rate climbed last month to 5.4 percent, the jobless
rate here has been stuck for several months at 3.2 percent.
   In the 1980s, development in the area took off at a breathtakng
pace, fueled by retailers and builders seeking to take advantage of
the steady influx of new residents.
   But growth eventually outstripped demand, and the first signs of
trouble came early last year when developers revealed they couldn't
fill their sparkling new office buildings.
   ``We've got an overbuilt office space market, and that filters
down to residential housing, and retailers too,'' Harris said.
``What you're looking at is three or four years of glut'' that
translates into about 45 million square feet of vacant office
space.
   Retail sales also have slowed and job growth is off. Local
governments are feeling the pinch, and budget squeezes mean fewer
new jobs.
   While federal spending in the area has slowed since the 1987 -
the last year of a seven-year, 170-percent spending boom - the
concentration of high-technology, research and development
companies located around Washington may cushion the region from the
effects of a further economic downturn.
   ``You're going to get the same kind of recession in Washington
that we are expecting elsewhere in the country, but it will come a
little later and be a little milder,'' Getman said. ``That's due to
the government buffer.''

<TEXT>
   Prime-time television has discovered another
personality to this steamy city with a seedy side.
   It's no longer the pastels, art deco and flamingos that ``Miami
Vice'' portrayed in an innovative way. It's ``la causa,'' Cuban
coffee and a multi-cultural city that CBS's new version of
``Wiseguy'' hopes to bring to audiences on Nov. 17.
   It's the flip side of Miami, say the show's promoters.
   ``There's more of Miami to be seen. They (`Miami Vice') showed a
large part of it, and beautifully, I miht add,'' said ``Wiseguy''
producer Alex Beaton. ``But that isn't all there is to Miami. We
are showing another side of Miami because we have a great emphasis
on the Cuban community, which is pretty important.''
   Many of the show's stars are Cuban-Americans, and an entire
episode was cast with Miami talent. Also, the show is negotiating
with CBS to simulcast in Spanish, which would be a first for
prime-time network television, Beaton said.
   Six episodes were shot in Miami and the production will shoot
seven more episodes in Vancouver, British Columbia, home for the
show's producer, Stephen Cannell Productions.
   The new episodes have some sharp differences with the original
top-rated show, producers say.
   ``I'm not sure `Wiseguy' is an applicable name anymore.
`Wiseguy' is a Mafia term,'' Beaton said. ``We're not dealing with
the Mafia here. We don't intend to. It's a new direction ... a new
look.''
   The Mafia motif is gutted for a cocaine cartel and free-Cuba
theme. Instead of Ken Wahl, the show's star is Steve Bauer, who was
born in Cuba but raised in Miami.
   ``It feels great to come home this way. I couldn't imagine a
more ideal situation really because of my family and growing up
here,'' said Bauer, whose family still lives in Miami. ``They asked
me to do the show and then they wrote (the role) as a
Cuban-American. ... It was tailor-made.''
   Bauer will play Michael Santana, an assistant U.S. attorney
fired from his job and disbarred. Santana also has a fondness for
rum and lives on his houseboat on the Miami River.
   Ken Wahl is not returning to the series. His old character,
Vinnie Terranova, will make several calls to Santana prior to
Terranova's disappearance. McPike (Jonathan Banks), the no-nonsense
point man, will return.
   The story will unfold with Santana infiltrating an air cargo
company owned by a good friend of his father, Rafael Santana,
played by Manolo Villaverde. The younger Santana then discovers
``irregularities'' in the company, and the drug smuggling scenario
begins to unfold.
   Bauer said his character believes in honor, justice and family,
but he's been knocked down in life.
   ``He's a student in life, but he's got his principles and he's
out there trying to do good,'' Bauer said in a recent interview.
   ``La causa,'' or ``the cause'' to free Cuba from Fidel Castro's
grip, will be a secondary story line with the elder Santana being a
Bay of Pigs veteran who takes potshots at the Cuban leader.
   ``I'm going to get a piece of Castro,'' Villaverde said. ``It's
like a little revenge.''
   Even though it's fiction, there are some streaks of reality in
the show.
   For example, Bauer's real father, Esteban Echevarria, 59, is a
pilot who flew 14 missions for the CIA in 1961, including three
during the failed Bay of Pigs assault. The plight of the Haitians
will be mentioned during an episode in which a boat filled with
citizens of the impoverished nation washes ashore at Key Biscayne.
   Both the writers and actors are painstakingly trying to erase
any stereotypes.
   ``Of course we are dealing with the problems, but there's a
different way of showing the problems and solving the problems,''
said Villaverde, who graduated from the University of Havana in
Cuba. ``If the writer knows what to project to the audience, than
we are all right. Some of the writers are doing excellent.''
   The quest to eradicate stereotypes has even reached Emmy-award
winning Villaverde's underwear.
   ``I don't think they wear those 100 percent nylon underwear,''
said Villaverde, referring to a director's instruction that he wear
nylon undershirts. ``I only wear cotton. So I said, `No, not for
me. I'd rather change into cotton.' '

<HEAD>Blues in the Garden of Eden</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As far as John Lee Hooker is concerned, the
blues wasn't born in the Mississippi Delta. He dates blues back
farther than that - to the Garden of Eden.
   ``When the world was born, the blues was born,'' he says simply.
``There wasn't no problem 'til God put man and woman together. Then
started love and heartache. It turned into blues.''
   The 73-year-old singer, guitarist and songwriter had a hit with
his first record, ``Boogie Chillen,'' in 1948. Since then, he's
been up and he's been down, opened for the Rolling Stones on one
tour, paid a lot of dues. His latest record, ``The Healer,'' has
brought him more attention than any record he's ever had.
   He was recently honored at a concert in Madison Square Garden,
and talked about the tribute a few days before.
   ``I'm glad to be here and alive,'' he said. ``I'm just proud and
I'm overjoyed that the people are doing this for me. It's a long
time coming but it got here.
   ``I paid so many dues. I've laid the path for so many other
musicians to follow my footsteps. I'm proud of that.''
   The concert, part of a 10-day Benson &amp; Hedges Blues Festival,
was a benefit for the 12-year-old Delta Blues Museum in Hooker's
birthplace, Clarksdale, Miss.
   A duet by Hooker and Bonnie Raitt, ``I'm in the Mood,'' won a
Grammy Award this year. A single now is out, ``Baby Lee,'' by
Hooker and Robert Cray. Raitt and Cray are on Hooker's ``The
Healer.'' So are Carlos Santana, Charlie Musselwhite, Los Lobos,
Canned Heat and George Thorogood.
   ``They wanted to do it because of the respect they had for me,''
Hooker says. ``They didn't need the money. It's brought more
attention to me than any album ever.''
   Hooker estimates that he has made between 65 and 70 albums, and
wrote or co-wrote all the songs on ``The Healer.''
   About the title:
   ``The blues is a healer. It's got a meaning to it. You do things
in your lifetime - at the time you did it you really wanted to do
it. In the end sometimes you see it wasn't good for you and you
say, `It served me right to suffer.' People hear that and say, `Oh,
that's a true lyric,' and feel better.
   ``I write songs people can relate to, young or old.''
   He recites his ``Think Twice Before You Go,'' a blues about
getting mad, storming out, then wanting to come back but it's too
late.
   ``People think you got to be poor and half starving to sing the
blues. Rich people can sing the blues. I ain't poor and broke. I
sit and sing the blues. I'm a human being. I like women. I've been
brokenhearted.
   ``You can have a room full of money, if you're sad and lonely,
that money is no good. You spend and spend and spend and it don't
take away the loneliness. You love a woman and you go out there and
you party and drink and come back home by yourself; you're lonely
with a hangover. The woman is still gone. You got the blues.
   ``I know it because I experienced it myself.''
   Appreciation of blues music never dies, Hooker says. ``It may
reach a certain level, then it stops. It is in a big rise now. Rock
'n' roll boomed way up and boomed down.''
   Hooker's stepfather taught him the guitar style he still uses.
``Nobody else plays this style,'' he says, adding that some try.
   ``I don't use a lot of fancy chords, just a solid driving,
moving, soulful beat. You hear the sound, it gets right to you.
   ``I never change. I keep the musicians around me doing something
different. You got to move with the times. But what they do fits
into what I'm doing.''
   Hooker lives in Vallejo, Calif., and tours two to four months a
year.
   ``I love to go in small nightclubs, dirt on the floor or
peanuts, people drinking at the bar, not dressed up. They're
shocked, thinking I shouldn't be in the funky little place with
them. They're the ones put me where I am. Rich men don't buy
records. They ain't got the time. Poor people is the ones that
support you. They work, buy your records, come out and see you when
you got a concert.''
   He has had ideas for songs while performing. ``You don't say it
right then. Later on, you think about it.
   ``You dream some of your best songs. If you don't put it down on
tape, it is gone from you.'' He can reach the button that starts
his tape rolling without getting out of bed.
   ``If I never made another album, people won't forget me,''
Hooker says. ``Long after I'm gone, I'll still be here - my songs,
my blues, in the minds of people.''

   The nation's second largest banking empire, and
the third biggest computer company. A major insurance conglomerate,
and an airline with routes in 36 states.
   So goes the ``honor roll'' of publicly held businesses that have
slashed or eliminated dividends in the past few weeks amid
deepening recession fears on Wall Street.
   Chase Manhattan, Unisys, Travelers Corp. and USAir Group are by
no means isolated cases. Through the first nine months of 1990,
corporations announced 278 dividend omissions or reductions,
according to Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
   It is shaping up as the biggest crop of adverse dividend actions
since 1982, S&amp;P says. On the other side of the coin, dividend
increases are setting their slowest pace since 1971.
   ``These statistics will likely get worse before they get better,
especially if a full-fledged recession develops,'' says Richard
Evans, research director at Dow Theory Forecasts, an investment
advisory firm in Hammond, Ind.
   All this has had a manifest impact in the stock market, which
has lately traded at its lowest levels since the spring of 1989.
Dividend cuts and suspensions are distinctly unpopular in the world
of big-time money management.
   But unsettling as these developments may be, some analysts say
investors should not necessarily take them as cause for despair
about the future course of stock prices.
   In fact, maintains Mark Stumpp at the investment firm of PDI
Strategies, it may even be a sign that stocks are due to take a
turn for the better in the not-so-remote future.
   To reach that conclusion, Stumpp examined how stock prices
performed since 1960 after years of varying degrees of dividend
growth.
   The peak dividend years, averaging payout growth of 13 percent,
were followed in the ensuing six-month periods by returns on the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock composite index averaging a paltry 1.8
percent.
   Within the three-decade sample, Stumpp found, as the
dividend-growth rates diminished, the stock market's performance
over the following six months steadily improved.
   At the other extreme, after years in which dividends eked out a
meager 0.3 percent increase, stocks chalked up an average gain of
10.1 percent.
   ``Abandoning stocks because dividend growth is low has a certain
intuitive appeal, but it's a poor investment strategy,'' Stumpp
concluded.
   Analysts say the reasons for this seeming anomaly aren't hard to
discern. For one thing, they say, corporate directors tend to
resist making dividend changes, either up or down, until the
underlying forces that mandate them are clearly established.
   If they act hastily, they risk hurting their credibility and
their companies' image of stability among investors and the other
constituencies, including employees and customers, with which they
must deal.
   So by the time a dividend is either raised or lowered, the
circumstances warranting the action tend to be well known among
stock traders.
   At any given time, furthermore, those traders are usually
preoccupied not with the present, but with trying to see as far
into the future as they can, always bearing in mind the business
cycle.
   ``Periods of high dividend growth tend to be followed by periods
of slower growth,'' said Stumpp. ``The investment implication is
that skyrocketing dividends signal that it's time to worry because
growth is likely to slow in the future.
   ``Our interpretation? Last year was the time to have been
worried about dividends.''

<HEAD>Wall Street Looks Past Recession, To Recovery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Don't worry about whether a recession has begun
in the U.S. economy. Get busy figuring out how, where and when it's
going to end.
   That's the watchword right now among traders seeking an edge on
rivals in the perennial guess-the-future competition that goes on
in the stock market.
   With the drop of better than 20 percent that took place in stock
prices from midsummer through early this month, these investors
reckon that a business slump is a foregone conclusion.
   Whether it eventually qualifies as a recession - defined as two
consecutives quarters of declines in the inflation-adjusted gross
national product - is, for them at least, a question of academic
interest.
   But the prospective starting point and timing of an economic
recovery is another matter, since they stand to help determine when
stocks might bottom out.
   ``The economy is facing a mild recession, not a collapse,''
asserts Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann &amp;
Co.
   ``Now is the time for portfolio managers to plan for economic
recovery next year. If our forecast of lower inflation in 1991 is
correct, then the bond market is poised for a major rally.
   ``That could create a tide that will lift all of Wall Street's
boats. Remember, the name of the game is to buy low, and sell
high.''
   Or as Rao Chalasani, analyst at Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben Inc.,
puts it: ``We believe the deceleration in downward momentum of the
stock market is visible. We expect the economy to be on its way up
starting in the second quarter of next year.''
   The big hazard now confronting the markets, many observers
believe, is the chance that recovery might begin from a much lower,
and later, starting point than is now generally foreseen.
   ``Though our numbers say mild recession, we remain wary,'' said
Maureen Allyn, chief economist at the money management firm of
Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark.
   ``Too much leverage has strained the financial system. The debt
overhang is outside the range of past experience, so history is no
guide to the troubles it might cause.
   ``We've little doubt that the dynamics of dealing with debt will
be intimately connected with what happens next in the economy.''
   Visions of recovery stirred in the stock market during the past
week, helping the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials to mount a
122.77-point rally to 2,520.79.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 5.98 to
170.40; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rose 9.81 to 337.37, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was off .26 at 293.71.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 180.28 million shares a day, up
from 156.19 million the week before.
   What worries some analysts more than the recent woes of stocks
and bonds is the ailing market for real estate.
   ``Falling real estate prices are driving bank balance sheets
into preilous territory around the globe,'' says Robert Barbera at
Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   But before too much more time has passed, Barbera argues,
problems in real estate and banking are likely to prompt a shift in
the credit policy of the Federal Reserve toward easier credit.
   ``Major declines for U.S. short term interest rates will
follow,'' he argues, ``and this fall will halt and then reverse the
slide for asset prices.''
   His conclusion: ``Recession, yes. Depression, no.''

deficit to its highest level in seven months, the government
reported.
   In its first report on America's trade gap since Iraq invaded

recipients will receive their biggest benefit boost in 8{ years
next January, a 5.4 percent increase that will give an average
retiree an extra $31 a month.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - A federal judge lowered Charles H. Keating
Jr.'s bail to $300,000 Thursday, ruling that $5 million bail set by
a state judge was unreasonably high for the former savings and loan
chief.
   U.S. District Judge John G. Davies said Thursday Superior Court
Judge Gary Klausner arbitrarily set Keating's bail.
   Klausner had described the $5 million bail as 2 percent of the
alleged $250 million in losses to people who invested in worthless
bonds through Irvine-based Lincoln Savings and Loan, owned by
American Continental Corp., which Keating headed.
   Keating's family posted the reduced bail.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Donald Trump has proposed a debt restructuring
to bondholders of his Taj Mahal casino and warned them that a
bankruptcy court filing may be the only alternative if the plan is
turned down.
   A representaive of the bondholders immediately rejected the
proposal Thursday, and said a Chapter 11 filing would be preferable
to the Trump plan.
   The restructuring, proposed by two Trump subsidiaries, Trump Taj
Mahal Funding Inc. and Trump Taj Mahal Associated LP, would give
bondholders a nearly 20 percent equity stake in the Atlantic City
casino in return for changes in the terms of its $675 million in
junk bonds.

   NEW YORK (AP) - AT&amp;T said its third-quarter profit rose almost 2
percent despite the sluggish economy, but earnings continued to be
dragged down by processing costs for the phone company's highly
popular new credit card.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, AT&amp;T said Thursday it
earned $712 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $699
million, or 65 cents a share, in the same quarter last year.
Per-share earnings remained stable due to a higher number of
outstanding shares in the most-recent quarter.
   Revenue advanced about 5 percent to $9.36 billion from $8.9
billion in the year-ago quarter.

ended July 28, compared with a loss of $63 million the previous

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The House has voted to curtail trade with
China for repressing its pro-democracy movement but - anticipating

threatens a future cutback.
   The measures passed Thursday would deprive China of
``most-favored-nation'' trade status, meaning sharply higher
tariffs on Chinese goods that could drastically reduce the volume
of trade between the two countries.
   However, President Bush, a former U.S. diplomat in China, was
expected to veto both, and supporters of the two measures
acknowledged they lacked the votes to override vetos.

<HEAD>Japanese Makers Announce New Lighter Laptop Computers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report</NOTE>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese companies are promising a new generation
of laptop computers made smaller and lighter by new power-saving
circuits and plug-in memory cards that replace floppy disks.
   ``Even though laptop computers were called portable in the past,
they really were a burden for people who had to carry them around
all day,'' said Isao Hirano, a spokesman for Fujitsu Ltd., Japan's
largest computer maker. ``We've changed that now.''
   Fujitsu on Thursday introduced a thin new laptop-size personal
computer, the FM R-CARD, which uses a full-size keyboard but weighs
only 2.2 pounds - less than half the weight of many other laptops.
   It uses power-saving technology developed by Poqet Computer, a
U.S. company that sells a miniature 1.1-pound computer in the
United States. Fujitsu owns 58 percent of Poqet and manufactures
its computer, which is about half the size of a normal laptop.
   Such technology, which cuts electricity to circuits that are not
being used, is important for portable computers because it extends
battery life and allows the use of smaller, lighter batteries.
   Instead of the heavy battery packs used by most portable
computers, which must be recharged every few hours, Fujitsu's FM
R-CARD runs for eight hours on two regular alkaline penlight
batteries.
   The FM R-CARD, going on sale in Japan in January for 238,000
yen, or about $1,900, uses a unique Fujitsu computing standard and
is not directly compatible with computers made by International
Business Machines Corp. Officials said they don't plan to market
the laptop overseas, but wouldn't be surprised if Poqet introduces
a similar model that is IBM-compatible.
   Earlier this week, Japan's NEC Corp. announced a diary-size
computer, the PC-98 HA, which weighs 2.4 pounds. Because of its
small keyboard, NEC officials said they expect it will be used
mostly for data retrieval, scheduling and light word-processing.
   The NEC model, which also is not IBM-compatible, goes on sale in
Japan next week at 198,000 yen, or about $1,585. No plans have been
made for overseas marketing, officials said.
   Like the Fujitsu, the NEC model uses plug-in memory cards
instead of floppy disks.
   The cards, which look like thick credit cards, contain an array
of memory chips and can be used to store both programs and data,
like floppy disks. But they are smaller, use much less electricity
and are 100 times faster, said Yoshihiro Satoh, general manager of
Fujitsu's personal computer systems engineering division. In
addition, computers using them don't need a floppy disc drive,
saving weight.
   The cards are expected to begin appearing on many other portable
computers following an agreement last spring between U.S. and
Japanese industry groups that established uniform standards for
them.
   Spreadsheet and word-processing programs already are available
on memory cards, and Japanese software makers plan to produce
magazine-like cards containing ``lifestyle'' data such as
restaurant listings and tourist guides.
   But one obstacle will be price, with program cards costing a
minimum of about 10,000 yen, or $80 dollars, to produce, Fujitsu
officials said. By contrast, floppy disks cost less than a dollar
to make.
   ``It will take a while, but memory cards will catch on,'' said
Katsushi Shiga, an analyst for Dataquest Japan, the Japanese branch
of a U.S. computer industry research company. ``Experienced
computer users will be slower to adapt because they tend to feel
uneasy without floppy disks, but new users are quickly accepting
them.''
   Also this week, Intel Corp. of the United States announced in
Japan a new powerful microprocessor, the 386 SL, that will allow
laptop makers to increase performance while curbing electrical
consumption. Like the Fujitsu laptop, it monitors the computer's
circuits and shuts off those not being used.

<HEAD>Trump Outlines Debt Restructuring Proposals, Warns Bankruptcy
Filing Possible</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump has unveiled a new debt
restructuring proposal for bondholders of his Taj Mahal casino -
and warned them that if they turn the plan down, everyone could end
up in bankruptcy court.
   But if the developer meant to frighten bondholders Thursday with
the specter of a Chapter 11 filing, it didn't work. A
representative of the investors said bankruptcy court would be
preferable to Trump's plan.
   The restructuring, proposed by two Trump subsidiaries, Trump Taj
Mahal Funding Inc. and Trump Taj Mahal Associated LP, would give
bondholders a nearly 20 percent equity stake in the Atlantic City
casino in return for changes in the terms of its $675 million in
junk bonds.
   The plan, outlined in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, calls for the interest rate on the bonds to be lowered
to 9 percent from their current 14 percent and for a Nov. 15
interest payment on the casino's $675 million in junk bonds to be
met by issuing additional bonds.
   Some future interest payments would also be made with new bonds,
and the maturities of some issues would be extended under the plan.
   In the filing, Trump said the restructuring proposals ``are
(the) only alternative to bankruptcy.''
   ``The company and partnership believe that the terms of the
amendments (to the bond terms) are more favorable'' than the
treatment bondholders would receive in bankruptcy court, Trump said
in the filing.
   But Wilbur Ross, a bondholder representative, wasn't impressed
by Trump's statement. Ross said Taj Mahal investors would get a
better deal through a Chapter 11 filing than the 19.9 percent stake
being offered by Trump.
   ``It doesn't make any sense for us to make hundreds of millions
of dollars in economic concessions they want and let 80 percent go
to the Trump Organization,'' said Ross, who represents 10
institutions that hold about one-third of the Taj Mahal bonds.
   Ross noted in a telephone interview that the investors hold the
first mortgage on the casino, which would place them at the front
of the line of creditors in a bankruptcy court reorganization.
   Ross, who is senior managing director of Rothschild Inc.,
declined to discuss how large an equity stake the bondholders were
seeking from Trump and indicated that negotiations would continue.
   Stephen Bollenbach, chief financial officer for the Trump
Organization, did not return a reporter's phone call seeking
comment on Ross' statement.
   Both sides have already rejected restructuring proposals put
forth by one another.
   In the SEC filing, Trump said bankruptcy court would have a
negative impact on the Taj Mahal's image. The glitzy casino opened
earlier this year amid much publicity and fanfare, but like other
Atlantic City casinos, it has been struggling in an uncertain
economy.
   Trump has been forced to negotiate with bondholders because his
three casinos - which also include Trump Castle and Trump Plaza -
have been unable to generate enough cash to pay all their bills.
   The Wall Street Journal reported last week that Trump also has
been forced to restructure $100 million in bank loans to Trump
Castle and the Taj Mahal.
   And earlier this year, the developer negotiated a $65 million
bank bailout that was supposed to give him breathing room to repay
his loans, which together are believed to total more than $3
billion.

<TEXT>
   UAL Corp., having removed its largest shareholder
as a hostile takeover threat, now faces another challenge: possibly
bitter negotiations with its three major unions.
   The employees' failed seven-month effort to buy the parent of
United Airlines has left behind resentment toward managers who
rejected to last-minute buyout proposals that lacked firm financing
commitments.
   To make matters worse for employees, they've apparently lost a
key supporter.
   Consiton Partners, UAL's largest shareholder, Thursday agreed
not to take part in any attempt to take over UAL for the next 2{
years. In exchange, the investment firm got two seats on the UAL
board.
   ``Coniston, once an ally, is now part of the establishment,''
Stephen Dexter of Kemper Financial Services Inc., said referring to
Coniston's support for the employee's buyout attempt.
   Coniston, which owns 11.8 percent of UAL common stock, had
threatened to oust UAL directors unless a union-led buyout was
approved. The $4.4 billion buyout bid failed last week when the
unions were not able to raise financing.
   In November 1989, Coniston bought 2.5 million shares of UAL
stock for an average disclosed price of $161 a share. Faced with
paper losses of $100 million, Coniston this spring was threatening
a proxy fight with the UAL board.
   Chicago-based UAL also agreed Thursday to repurchases of up to 2
million shares of its stock to improve shareholder value.
   UAL stock, which peaked at $296 last year, closed Thursday on
the New York Stock Exchange at $94.75, up $5.
   Earlier Thursday, the three major unions at United Airlines said
they would band closer together so they can fight any company
attempts to gain concessions.
   More than 80 leaders of unions representing pilots, flight
attendants and mechanics met Wednesday in Chicago.
   ``It was generally determined that in light of (UAL Chairman
Stephen) Wolf's record of aggressive concessionary bargaining
tactics, labor at United must continue to mature (their)
alliance,'' the union statement said.
   UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins said the company had no comment on the
union statement.
   Some observers say the company needs concessions from the unions
to meet its expansion goals. Unions say they are looking for major
improvements in wages and benefits, and some think the potential
exists for a major national labor dispute.
   All of United's 47,300 union employees, comprising about
two-thirds of UAL's labor force, are working under extended
contracts.
   No dates have been set for talks. But they're not expected to
begin before November.

   After more than a month in jail, Charles H.
Keating Jr. won a bail reduction and headed home to prepare his
defense against the first criminal charges in one of the nation's
biggest savings and loan failures.
   U.S. District Judge John G. Davies ruled Thursday that the $5
million bail set by a state judge for the 66-year-old former thrift
operator was excessively high in the investment fraud case.
   Davies lowered bail to $300,000, and Keating's family posted it
by pledging their houses as security. Keating was released Thursday
night, smiling as he walked out of jail.
   Davies had heard an impassioned plea by Los Angeles lawyer John
``Jack'' Quinn, who has defended Keating against a slew of civil
charges stemming from the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association.
   Reimbursing the thrift's federally insured deposits could cost
taxpayers as much as $2 billion. It would be the nation's costliest
thrift bailout.
   Quinn said Keating had wrongly become ``the most vilified man
since Richard Nixon,'' but would never skip bail after his family
put up their homes as security.
   ``I'll tell you what would have an impact on Charlie Keating -
the thought of his children and grandchildren losing the places
they live,'' Quinn said.
   Keating was not in court. Several family members were.
   The savings and loan chief with powerful political connections
came to symbolize the excesses of the thrift industry with his
investments in risky real estate ventures and junk bonds.
   He controlled the Irvine-based Lincoln Savings through his
American Continental Corp. in Phoenix, Ariz., drawing huge salaries
and maintaining a lavish personal lifestyle.
   He contends he is being victimized by authorities who failed to
prevent the nation's S&amp;L debacle and now seek to make him a
scapegoat.
   Shirley Lampel, a bondholder who claims she was cheated by
Keating, said, ``He belongs in prison. I hope he'll be back there
soon .... He's a con man.''
   His lawyers say he is broke. They said that while jailed he
could never defend himself adequately against the many cases
stemming from Lincoln's collapse and American Continental's filing
for bankruptcy protection.
   Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner refused to lower Keating's
bail last month. He noted that the 42-count indictment against
Keating carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, giving
Keating ample reason to flee prosecution.
   Davies disagreed, ruling Klausner arbitrarily set Keating's bail
as much as 50 times higher than that of his three co-defendants.
   Those three, former top officials of Keating's companies, face
identical charges and already have posted bail.
   ``The bottom line is there was a violation of Mr. Keating's
Eighth Amendment rights'' against excessive bail, Davies said.
   The judge ordered Keating to surrender his passport, restrict
travel to the Lower 48 states, report to Los Angeles County
authorities by phone every week and give them a detailed itinerary
of any planned trips.
   Keating attorney Jeffrey Powell said Keating would return to
Paradise Valley, Ariz., to prepare his defense against charges that
he defrauded investors who bought now-worthless American
Continental junk bonds at Lincoln branches, Powell said.
   ``I'm extremely pleased,'' Powell said. ``But I think it's
unfortunate it took us 33 days to get to this point.''
   Deputy District Attorney Paul Turley said prosecutors would not
appeal the bail reduction.
   The criminal case is separate from charges in civil suits that
contend Keating looted Lincoln.
   The bail decision came as the Senate Ethics Committee
investigated whether five senators who received campaign
contributions from Keating improperly intervened with banking
regulators on his behalf.
   The committee adjourned Thursday without announcing a decision
on whether to intensify its investigation of three senators: Alan
Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and Donald W. Riegle
Jr., D-Mich.

<HEAD>Iraq Orders Fuel Rationing, Foreigners in Kuwait to Register</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Squeezed by the U.N. embargo that
apparently cut off refinery materials, the government today
announced it will ration gasoline beginning next week.
   It also ordered all foreigners hiding in occupied Kuwait to
report to authorities or face unspecified punishment.
   The Oil Ministry ordered car owners to go to special centers set
up by the ministry to obtiin ration coupons. The order was carried
today by all Iraqi government newspapers.
   The order did not say how much gasoline would be alloted under
the restrictions that go into effect Tuesday, but long lines seen
forming at gas stations in Baghdad early today.
   The rationing order covers cars, buses and trucks, but not
kerosene and liquefied gas, which is widely used for cooking and
other domestic purposes.
   The directive comes one day after Iraq announced it would sell
its oil at $21 a barrel, the market price before its invasion of
Iraq and half the current rate on world markets.
   Sources in Baghdad, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
decision may have been taken because Iraq lacks imported materials
used in refining oil as a result of the United Nations trade
embargo imposed after the invasion.
   During its eight-year war with Iran that ended in 1988, the
Iraqi government did not impose oil rationing.
   The order applied to Iraq's 18 provinces, but not to Kuwait,
which Iraq invaded and annexed two months ago and now calls its
19th province. The Oil Ministry's order did not explain why Kuwait
was not included in the rationing.
   Another report published in Iraqi newspapers Friday said all
foreigners in Kuwait must register with local authorities before
Nov. 5.
   Those who fail to do so ``will be responsible before the law,
and their residency cards will be canceled,'' the report said. It
gave no other details.
   Under Iraqi law, foreigners who are found without residency
cards are punished with fines and imprisonment.
   The exceptions are citizens from Arab Cooperation Council
nations - Egypt, Jordan and Yemen.
   The Iraqi military has seized Western men and scattered them
throughout Iraq at strategic military sites to deter attack by the
U.S.-led military forces in Saudi Arabia and nearby Gulf regions.
   About 400,000 foreigners are believed to remain in Kuwait,
including about 2,000 Westerners said by the U.S. State Department
to be in hiding from Iraqi soldiers.
   An estimated 1 million foreigners were in Kuwait before the
invasion.

   Charities not connected with the United Way
are getting a larger chunk of the contributions raised through
campaigns at the workplace, a report says.
   The report was issued Thursday by the National Committee for
Responsive Philanthropy, which has campaigned for giving workers
access to newer and smaller charities that are not usually part of
United Way campaigns. The committee, representing more than 300
fund-raising organizations, was established in 1976 to monitor
developments in philanthropy.
   Alternative organizations are getting 10.1 percent of the money
raised in workplace campaigns, the report said. Ten years ago, it
said, alternative groups got 3.5 percent of the total.
   Among the alternative organizations are some health agencies
such as the Muscular Dystrophy Association; international agencies
such as CARE and Oxfam America; arts funds; the United Negro
College Fund; and agencies that raise money for social action
causes and women's and environmental groups.
   All told, United Way campaigns are expected to raise $3.2
billion in contributions this year, two-thirds of it through
payroll deductions and other employee contribution programs.
Organizations not under the United Way umbrella are expected to
raise $205 million from employee contribution programs.

<HEAD>Maxwell House Account Moves in Kraft General Foods' Ad Roster
Shakeup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the coffee tastes a little better at Ogilvy &amp;
Mather these days, it may be because Maxwell House is back on the
agency's menu of U.S. advertising assignments.
   Kraft General Foods said Thursday it has realigned assignments
for its advertising agencies and said it will pay them more for
advertising that works better.
   The biggest shift in ad assignments gives the domestic Maxwell
House coffee account, estimated at more than $70 million a year in
billings, back to Ogilvy which lost it 16 months ago.
   The changes were part of a series of new policies and practices
that the huge food marketer said are designed to strengthen its
ties to its ad agencies, enabling them to develop expertise in a
brand and apply it around the world.
   Glenview, Ill.-based Kraft General Foods is one of the nation's
biggest advertisers, spending an estimated $900 million a year to
promote products that include Post cereals, Jell-O desserts, Oscar
Mayer meats and Birds Eye vegetables. The company declined to say
how much it spends on advertising.
   As a major advertiser, the moves being made by Kraft General
Foods could influence relations between other companies and their
ad agencies.
   Ogilvy, a New York-based subsidiary of the British marketing
company WPP Group PLC, had created Maxwell House ads for more than
30 years but lost the U.S. account in the summer of 1989 to the
agency D'Arcy Masius Benton &amp; Bowles.
   Eric Strobel, senior vice president-marketing for Kraft General
Foods, said the switch back to Ogilvy did not reflect
dissatisfaction with D'Arcy's work.
   He said Ogilvy had continued to handle Maxwell House in some
other countries even after losing the U.S. account.
   ``This takes advantage of the worldwide capabilities of Ogilvy &amp;
Mather,'' Strobel said.
   D'Arcy continues as one of Kraft's major agencies on brands such
as Entenmann's baked goods, Cool Whip topping and Crystal Light
beverages.
   Officials of the two ad agencies declined to discuss their
reactions to the moves. But Clayton Wilhite, president of D'Arcy
Masius Benton &amp; Bowles USA, said the loss ``will have an impact on
the agency'' that was being assessed.
   In a pair of other major account moves, Kraft said it was giving
the Chicago-based Leo Burnett agency responsibility in the United
States for Kraft Real Mayonnaise advertising while J. Walter
Thompson of New York gets the Miracle Whip salad dressing account.
   The Kraft mayonnaise account had previously been handled by
Young &amp; Rubicam in New York while Foote Cone &amp; Belding
Communications in Chicago had Miracle Whip. The trade journal
Advertising Age said Kraft General Foods spent about $51 million on
the two accounts last year.
   In addition to the account switches, Strobel said the new policy
calls for agencies to be paid 16 percent of ad billings for
superior work, 14 percent for ads that meet agreed-upon goals and
13 percent for ads that fall short.
   For years, agencies have often paid ad agencies 15 percent of
billings for their work. In recent months, however, a number of
advertisers and agencies have adopted compensation systems that
reward work for improved sales and penalize campaigns failing to
produce desired results.
   Julian Clopet, president of Ogilvy &amp; Mather-North America,
applauded the new policies advanced by Kraft General Foods. ``It is
treating another person like a partner,'' he said.

   An executive with 20 years in the
heavy-truck business has been nominated to head Mack Trucks Inc.,
the troubled Allentown subsidiary of French automaker Renault SA.
   Elios Pascual, general-secretary of Renault Vehicules
Industriels, was nominated by the Mack board's nomination and
compensation committee to replace Ralph E. Reins, Mack announced.
   ``His knowledge and experience will be critical to our taking
all necessary steps to return Mack to profitability while
maintaining and increasing Mack's market share,'' Jean-Pierre
Capron, RVI chief executive officer, said in a statement Thursday.
   Pascual, 49, is in charge of RVI's long-term strategic planning
and administration. A career RVI employee, he has been a member of
Mack's board of directors and its executive and finance committee
since 1983.
   The Mack board will vote on Pascual's nomination later this
month. He would assume office at the end of the month.
   Renault announced Oct. 1 it had acquired control of Mack after
several years of holding a 44.5 percent stake. Its intervention
allowed Mack to renegotiate $498 million in bank loans, averting
possible bankruptcy.
   Mack has said it expects 1990 to be its second consecutive year
with a loss of more than $180 million.
   The departing Reins will become president of the automotive
group at United Technologies Corp. of Hartford, Conn., effective
Oct. 29.

   Denny's Inc., the family restaurant chain,
said it will move its headquarters to Spartanburg, S.C. to
centralize its operations with those of its parent company, TW
Services.
   Denny's also said Thursday it had appointed Bernard Scott, 57,
as chief executive. Scott replaces Sam Maw, a TW Services executive
who has operated the 315-restaurant chain since 1988.
   Thursday's announcement of the move surprised many of the 500
headquarters executives in Irvine, said Roger Shively, vice
president in charge of human resources. It was not known how many
jobs, if any, would be cut in the move, which will take two to
three years.
   ``There are certain people who we have asked to make the move.
We will consider requests from anybody else,'' Shively said.
   Denny's, which began as a doughnut shop in 1953, underwent a
face lift in 1987 after it was bought by TW Services. Menus were
updated, restaurants were renovated and the work force was slashed
by about 25 percent.
   Since then, the chain's revenues and profits have grown.
   In the first six months of this year, Denny's reported earnings
of $58.7 million, up nearly 20 percent from the $49 million in
earnings for the same period in 1989.
   TW Services, a $3.5 billion conglomerate, also owns Canteen
Inc., El Pollo Loco, Hardee's and Quincy's Steakhouse chains.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Parliament today gave preliminary
approval to Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic reform plan, after he
accused his key rival of shirking responsibility for the
transformation to a free-market system.
   The Supreme Soviet voted 356 to 12 in favor of the plan, with 26
abstentions, and began debating possible amendments.   President Gorbachev
said his plan, a compromise forged from a
series of competing proposals, was ``the only rational course of
action.''
   He acknowledged that the huge Russian Federation wants faster,
more radical reforms, but said its leaders, including Boris N.
Yeltsin, are afraid of the social and economic disruptions they
would cause.
   In a 50-minute speech, Gorbachev also dismissed concerns that
the switch from a centrally planned system was a retreat from
socialism.
   Yeltsin, president of the Russian Federation, has lambasted
Gorbachev's program as a ``catastrophe'' that is ``doomed to fail''
within months after touching off inflation and unemployment.
   He said Russia, the largest and richest of the 15 Soviet
republics, may proceed with its own 500-day plan as early as Nov.
1.
   Gorbachev said he shared many of Yeltsin's concerns about the
country's worsening economy and his fears of inflation. But he
noted the Russian parliament recently raised the wholesale prices
of meat, and said this touched off a wave of inflation.
   ``Comrade Yeltsin's assertions are strange, to say the least,''
Gorbachev said. ``I'm under the impression that the Russian
leadership is afraid of difficulties and wants to pass on
responsibility for possible difficulties and consequences .... onto
central organs of power.''
   Gorbachev appealed to the Soviet people and lawmakers at all
levels of government to approve his plan, stressing ``we cannot
delay any longer.''
   Leaders of the republics were invited to join the 542 national
lawmakers in listening to Gorbachev's speech in the Supreme
Soviet's beige marble hall, but Yeltsin was not present. The speech
received only five seconds of lukewarm applause.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, who drafted a conservative
reform plan, told the legislature that implementing tough changes
``would not bring glory'' to those who carry out the orders.
   He called on opponents to ``discard political and other
ambitions'' and warned, ``If changes turn into chaos, violence
becomes very possible.''
   Gorbachev's plan would transform the moribund Soviet economy in
four stages.
   It sets no deadline for the switch from a centrally planned
economy, but says other countries have achieved similar goals in 18
months to two years.
   The plan begins by cutting the budget deficit and the nation's
money supply, increasing production of consumer goods, raising bank
interest rates for savings and introducing land reform.
   In the second stage, prices on roughly 70 percent of all goods
and services would be freed to respond to market forces and small
private businesses would be encouraged.
   The third stage calls for a free market for housing, a modern
banking system and entrepreneurship. The final stage would end
government monopolies in many industries and allow the ruble to be
freely traded against other world currencies.
   The plan would give the ethnically and geographically diverse
republics more clout in running the economy. They would have the
right to control most of the resources in their territory, override
price increases approved by central authorities and decide whether
to break up collective farms into private plots.
   All but two republics have declared some form of autonomy from
the Kremlin. Russia, the biggest and richest of them, threatens to
implement its own reform plan as early as Nov. 1, setting up a
separate currency and customs system.
   Gorbachev tried to merge the radical 500-day plan already
adopted by the huge Russian republic with several other proposals,
including a far more conservative plan drafted by Ryzhkov.
   The Soviet people are unlikely to endure the inflation and
unemployment expected to accompany any switch to a market economy
unless it has confidence in the leader carrying out the reforms.
   Gorbachev, facing a breakdown of the economic system, realized
this in late July when he set up a committee with Yeltsin to forge
a compromise. But the two leaders quickly broke ranks, and their
rift is widening.
   Even Tass, traditionally loyal to the Kremlin, jumped on
Yeltsin's bandwagon.
   It said Thursday in an unsigned commentary that Yeltsin's plan
``is possibly the only form of surgery that can help the ailing
Soviet economy recover.''
   The government now sets prices on nearly all products and
subsidizes many unprofitable factories. Under a market system, most
prices would be decontrolled and unprofitable businesses would
close, forcing workers to seek new jobs.
   ``Everything will depend on who implements this program,''
Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak said in an interview.
   Referring to Ryzhkov, he said: ``If it is done by the current
government, nothing will come of it. It could be a catastrophe.''

<TEXT>
   Nissan Motor Manufacturing Corp. U.S.A.
has bought options on about 900 acres in Tennessee and Alabama for
a plant to build engines, a company executive said.
   The sites under consideration would be used for a new plant that
also would build major components for the Japanese carmaker that
builds Sentras and light pickup trucks at its Smyrna, Tenn.,
plant., near Nashville.
   Nissan is looking at Decherd, Tenn., - about 60 miles south of
Smyrna - and at Athens, Ala. - about 90 miles south of Smyrna.
   Nissan still is examining the sites and has not made a
recommendation to the company's board, according to Gail Neuman,
Nissan vice president and general counsel. Details of the options
were disclosed Thursday.
   Nissan has said it would like to have components plant in the
United States and that there is no room for such expansion at its
Smyrna plant.
   The Smyrna plant is undergoing a nearly $500 million expansion
that will add 1.7 million square feet and a third car line in 1992.
   Ms. Neuman said Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. may not decide before
year's end on whether to go ahead with plans for a U.S. components
plant. Site selection must be made by next June, when the options
expire.

   The stock market rose sharply today, extending
Thursday's rally as oil prices and interest rates receded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 36.39 to
2,489.11 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by nearly 5 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 585 up, 125
down and 266 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 34.57 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Oil prices, which have turned downward of late, took a big drop
in today's activity.
   Crude oil futures for November delivery fell almost $3 a barrel,
to the neighborhood of $34 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The resulting letup in inflationary worries helped push interest
rates lower in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government
bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates,
rose about $10 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Analysts said that gave stock traders the encouragement they
needed to keep following through on the rally that began Thursday.
   Gainers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, up 1 at 106&rsqb;; General Electric, up 1 at 55{; Ford Motor,

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
2.11 to 169.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 2.71 at 294.55.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 64.85 to
2,452.72, for its biggest single-day gain since it climbed 78.71 on
Aug. 27.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 5 to 2 on the

<HEAD>Mobil Agrees To Phase Out Use Of Deadly Acid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Mobil Oil Corp. settled a city
lawsuit against its refinery here by promising to get rid of deadly
hydrogen fluoride and submit to outside safety inspections.
   Under the agreement, Mobil would be allowed to develop and use a
derivative of hydrogen fluoride that would not form a toxic, acid
cloud. The corporation also has seven years to phase out of
hydrogen fluoride use.
   The agreement Thursday settles an action filed by the city
alleging use of the lethal cloud-forming acid threatened thousands
of residents.
   The case was set for trial Nov. 5.
   A trial would have ``shown the world how dangerous (hydrogen
fluoride) is and how poorly managed the plant was operated,'' said
Councilman Dan Walker.
   The lawsuit, filed early this year, stems from a November 1987
explosion and fire sparked when hydrogen fluoride overflowed into a
tank and mixed with another chemical.
   The blast caused $17 million damage, injuring four workers and
six bystanders.
   Hydrogen fluoride is used to manufacture high-octane gasolines
and forms a heavy cloud when exposed to air. City officials feared
a refinery accident or leak could send such a cloud over
residential neighborhoods.
   Refinery Manager Joel Maness said he expected the settlement to
end several years of acrimony between Torrance and Mobil.
   ``We feel strongly that we have a safe operation,'' Maness said.
``But I never mind having another set of eyes take a look at our
operations and our procedures.''
   An inspector will advise the plant on safety considerations. The
independent reviewer will be chosen by joint agreement between
Mobil and the city. The bill will be paid by the company, court
documents said.
   The inspector will report to retired Superior Court Judge Harry
V. Peetris, who will act as an arbitrator on future disputes over
the phase-out program. Peetris also will be paid by Mobil.

   Sir Terence Conran, the British design maverick
who created the Conran and Habitat home furnishing stores, has left
the retailing giant he founded.
   The company, Storehouse PLC, said Friday that Conran has
resigned as a non-executive director to pursue other commitments.
   Conran, 59, relinquished his duties as chairman in May, after
heading the group since its formation in 1986.
   He has bought from Storehouse the main London store bearing his
name for $6.9 million and intends to open additional stores. He
also is a director of RSCG Conran Design and of the publisher
Conran Octopus, and has property and restaurant interests.
   In July, Conran sold a 4.9 percent stake in the company to
investors, reducing his holding to 2.2 percent.
   Storehouse, whose profits have come under pressure from
increased costs and heightened competition, has embarked on a
program of widespread management restructuring and disposals.
   Storehouse Chairman Ian Davison told shareholders that he didn't
expect six-month profits, to be released in November, to match
those of a year ago. In the six months ended Sept. 16, 1989, the
company earned 7.3 million pounds, or $14.3 million, on revenue of
535 million pounds, or $1.05 billion.

   Wheat and soybean futures prices rose slightly in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, reflecting new
export demand. Corn futures were narrowly mixed.
   The crop markets opened mostly lower but wheat quickly rallied
following an Agriculture Department announcement that China bought
about 450,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices.
   Government figures showing increased export demand for soybeans

<HEAD>Judge Agrees to Keep P-I-E Rolling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal bankruptcy court judge has
agreed to allow Olympia Holding Corp. of Miami to use certain funds
to keep its P-I-E International trucking company operating until
the next court hearing Nov. 4.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George L. Proctor ruled Thursday that
Olympia could use $24.4 million in cash from accounts receivable to
fund P-I-E's operations through Nov. 4.
   On Tuesday, Olympia filed for Chapter 11 protection from its
creditors while it develops a reorganization plan, listing debts of
$237 million and assets of $169 million. P-I-E is Olympia's only
subsidiary.
   ``The action of the court today was a vote of confidence in
P-I-E's management and employees in their ability to reorganize,''
said Olympia attorney Steve Busey.
   As part of the plan to reorganize, the parent of the
Jacksonville-based motor carrier said up to one-fifth of its 7,500
workers would be laid off and about 50 of P-I-E's 230 terminals
would be closed.
   P-I-E, which had revenues of $512 million last year, plans to
reduce its annual sales volume to about $350 million by cutting out
inefficient, unprofitable terminals.
   ``As the volume goes down, employment levels will have to be
lowered. The layoffs will affect everyone from terminal managers
down to janitors,'' said P-I-E President Gerard W. McIntyre.

<TEXT>
   Blaming fuel prices in part, Midway Airlines
anounced today it will be closing down its hub operations in
Philadelphia and concentrate on its Chicago hub.
   The cutback includes the sale of 11 gates at the Philadelphia
airport to USAir for approximately $68 million. The deal includes
routes to Toronto and Montreal as well as a cargo building, vehicle
maintenance building and related operations space. The sale is
subject to federal government approval.
   Midway will still serve Philadelphia, but with connector flights
to Chicago, according to David R. Hinson, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``The unprecedented increases in the cost of aviation fuel since
August have added more than $10 million to the company's monthly
operating costs,'' Hinson said. ``These additional costs have led
to substantial operating losses.''
   Midway president Thomas Schick said during a news conference in
Philadelphia the decision was a difficult one.
   ``We would have preferred to stay in Philadelphia, but the
economic reality forces us to leave,'' Schick said.
   Midway will retain two gates.
   The cutbacks will be accomplished in stages, Hinson said. The
final cuts will occur next April. Schick said there will be layoffs
from the staff of 810 who now work in Philadelphia. He did not say
how many would lose their jobs and how many would be transferred.
   Midway moved into Philadelphia in November of 1989 with the
purchase of gates and space from the ailing Eastern Airlines.
   Midway currently offers 61 flights daily to 17 destinations,
accounting for one-sixth of the airline's operations.
   As Midway moves out of its Philadelphia hub, Hinson said 14 new
destinations will be added to the Chicago flight schedule.

<TEXT>
   A former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond
salesman today described a climate of fear at the investment bank
after client Ivan Boesky began cooperating with the government, but
he didn't back a bribery charge against Michael Milken.
   Terren Peizer, testifying with immunity, said that as Milken
learned the news of Boesky's November 1986 plea agreement for
securities fraud from a financial news ticker, Drexel's top junk
bond financier ``lost his train of thought and concentration and
started going, `Uh, uh.' ''
   Boesky became Milken's chief accuser in a traumatic financial
scandal that eventually brought both Drexel and Milken down.
   Government witnesses testifying Thursday offered vivid details
of possible insider trading, bribery and influence-peddling between
Drexel junk-bond division employees and their customers.
   But as in previous testimony during Milken's pre-sentencing
hearing, no direct evidence was established linking Milken to a
string of crimes alleged by the government.
   The second of three transactions presented at the hearing by
prosecutors involves allegations of bribery and misappropration for
personal gain of securities in the Drexel-financed buyout of Storer
Communications Inc.
   Peizer also said Milken ordered him to turn over a blue ledger
book containing a list of trades between Drexel and David Solomon
of Solomon Asset Management, who had a close relationship with
Milken and has been linked by the government to wrongdoing.
   The witness said he handed the book over to a Drexel executive,
Lorraine Spurge, in a kitchenette at Drexel's Beverly Hills,
Calif., junk bond department after turning on a water faucet in
case anyone was listening.
   ``Everyone was running faucets'' at Drexel after Boesky's plea
deal, Peizer said.
   But like other witnesses, Peizer did not link Milken directly to
a bribery scheme involving Storer stock as alleged by prosecutors.
   The hearing was called by U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to gain
insight into Milken's character for sentencing. The government says
Milken engaged in lawbreaking far beyond crimes to which he has
pleaded guilty and therefore deserves a long prison term.
   Milken, 44, pleaded guilty in April to six felony counts related
to illegal trading and agreed to pay $600 million in penalties. He
faces up to 28 years imprisonment.
   Prosecutors charged that Milken established a partnership known
as MacPherson Partners largely to reward customers who bought
hard-to-sell Storer securities with company stock warrants sold
below market value.
   Two government witnesses testified the stock warrants were
offered to induce big investors to buy certain preferred securities
in Storer. But neither could link Milken to any such activity.
   Benalder Bayse Jr., former manager of high-yield bond funds for
First Investors Management Corp., offered a picture of corrupt
behavior by other Drexel employees at the Beverly Hills division.
   He said a Drexel salesman, Roy Johnson, sought a guarantee he
would funnel Drexel First Investors' business after steering him to
the job. He said Johnson claimed he had spoken with Milken about
negotiating his compensation at First Investors.
   ``He told me they wanted total control over the account if they
were going to endorse me for the job,'' Bayse testified.
   Bayse admitted that Johnson offered him - and he bought - a
personal interest in MacPherson after he committed about $10
million in the preferred securities for First Investors.
   But he said he wasn't bribed to invest in Storer for First
Investors and bought the preferred securities because Milken
assured him the Storer deal was sound.
   Bayse said Johnson told him that ``because I was a good
customer'' he would receive other investment tips. He said Johnson
told him one of his accounts ``was accumulating the equity'' of
Republic Air but that ``you didn't hear that from me.'' Republic
shortly thereafter received a takeover offer from Northwest
Airlines.
   Thomas Connors, who headed Drexel's preferred stock group,
testified that the Storer stock warrants were offered to some
customers to induce participation.
   He said one customer, Richard Grassgreen, bought a personal
investment in MacPherson after purchasing the warrants on behalf of
Kinder-Care Inc. A lawyer for Grassgreen told Wood on Wednesday his
client was being investigated by the government in connection with
the trading. Grassgreen resigned Thursday as chairman of Enstar
Group Inc.
   In its pre-sentencing memo, prosecutors said five
Milken-controlled partnerships bought 82 percent of the Storer
warrants and made $172 million. They charge Milken was guilty of
fraud in the sale of the warrants, controlling the market for the
securities and using them as gratuities for customers.
   The partnership was formed shortly after the $2.5 billion buyout
of Storer by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. Drexel provided nearly
$1.5 billion in financing for the deal.

<HEAD>PPG Earnings Up Slightly in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PPG Industries said Friday its third-quarter
profits rose 0.3 percent as the company's glass and coatings
operations posted gains.
   Vincent A. Sarni, chairman and chief executive officer, said
higher sales from acquisitions, foreign currency translation gains,
modest improvements in North American auto production and increased
European business contributed to sales and earnings gains in the
glass and coatings divisions.
   For the three months ended Sept. 30, profit totaled $107.1
million, or $1 a share, compared with $106.7 million, or 97 cents a
share, in the same period of 1989.
   The latest quarterly earnings included a charge of 4 cents a
share related to the restructuring of PPG's ink business. The 1989
quarterly results included a gain of 13 cents a share from business
divestitures and realignments.
   Sales increased 8 percent to $1.47 billion in the third quarter
from $1.36 billion.
   Sarni said PPG remains optimistic that 1990 results will exceed
those of 1989 despite recent international political developments
and a sluggish second half.
   ``Improved operating efficiencies experienced by each of our
major businesses are expected to contribute significantly to the
company's 1990 earnings improvement,'' he said.
   Profits in the first nine months of the year increased nearly 3
percent to $373.4 million, or $3.47 a share, from $363.8 million,
or $3.25 a share.
   Sales increased nearly 5 percent in the nine-month period to
$4.52 billion from $4.31 billion.

<HEAD>Management Rule No. 1: Control Your Fate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It is generally considered a principle of good
management in governmental and business affairs to maintain as many
options as possible and in that way to protect yourself from
others.
   It applies equally to the President of the United States and his
fiscal policies, to the management of a corporation, and to the way
an individual automobile driver handles himself on the highway.
   Stated another way, it means you should never get into a
position that allows friend, competitor or enemy to seize the
initiative from you and make decisions affecting your life, liberty
or future.
   It isn't practiced well these days, and it isn't difficult to
cite the examples.
   You may begin with the price of oil. Its fluctuations in the
past week have affected the value of the dollar, the prices of
stocks, the potential level of inflation, the balance of payments
and the future of the economy.
   All those factors involve the futures of Americans from the
President to the latest infant born, but the influences on them are
largely from without. Americans have lost their options. They do
not control their destiny.
   Neither do many corporations.
   The fate of Robert Campeau, a successful Canadian builder, is an
example. He mortgaged everything in order to become the world's
biggest merchant, the head of Allied and Federated stores. Then his
creditors took it from him.
   Donald Trump can tell you what it's like. He sat on an imaginary
throne of great wealth and believed it was real. But now his
creditors are disgruntled, and some of them sound determined to
reclaim throne, tiara and robes.
   Individuals did it, too. When times were good they made good
incomes, and they traveled and bought nice cars, big houses and
lots of adult toys. They spent, and then they borrowed more. Then
the economy turned down.
   All this is a vast departure - governmental, corporate, personal
- from the American ideals of half a century ago, when people
worked to pay off the home mortgage, government balanced the budget
and businesses watched their dimes.
   Traces of the old still may be found, but those who hold to
those ideals do so quietly, as if they possessed a treasure they
cared not to share. All in all, the old methods have disappeared,
replaced by ``creative'' management.
   As a nation, the United States owes a vast bill to other nations
because it consumed so much. Japan and Europe were eager to serve
this American appetite, and in doing so they accumulated billions
of American dollars.
   Those dollars didn't just sit over there. They helped finance
productive enterprises that competed with the United States. Then
some of the money was returned to America, to purchase American
stocks and real estate.
   Japanese and other foreign investments helped shove securities
prices to unprecedented highs, and Americans cheered. But then the
foreigners began taking their money home again, a major factor in
the big stock market collapse.
   In the 1960s, Americans were known as the greatest managers, and
their methods were studied and copied. Good business schools were
rare in Europe and Japan, and so their students came to America to
learn how to do things.
   Americans also began sending their management authorities
abroad, not necessarily because they wanted to teach foreigners but
because they no longer wished to listen to their home-grown
experts.
   Soon after, domestic production quality and efficiency seemed to
go into a decline as it rose abroad, and American companies soon
were being beaten on their own turf by imports.
   They had given away their options and delivered their fate into
the hands of others, one of the most basic management errors anyone
can make, but one that is being made over and over again.

<HEAD>Midway Shutting Down Philadelphia Hub</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE LINDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Midway Airlines announced Friday it would
sell off its unprofitable hub operations at the Philadelphia
International Airport and end 61 daily flights by April 30 as it
faces even greater losses due to fuel prices.
   Midway will start dropping flights in January and shift
passengers to other airlines as the flights are phased out.
   President Thomas Schick said at a news conference that Midway
would sell 11 gates, a maintenance building, baggage, cargo and
ticket facilities, and Canadian routes to Toronto and Montreal to
USAir for approximately $68 million.
   Midway, whose main hub is at Chicago's Midway Airport, had
obtained the Philadelphia assets - plus 16 DC9 planes and slots in
Washington and New York - a year ago from Eastern Airlines for
$205.6 million. The selloff, Schick said, would cost his airline
about $30 million.
   David Hinson, Midway chairman and chief executive officer, said
in a statement that the sale was necessary to stabilize the
airline's financial condition and return it to profitability.
   ``We must close this USAir transaction to obtain the cash
resources we require,'' he said. Hinson said the losses, if left
unchecked, would ``threaten the company's continuing viability.''
   Said Schick: ``We felt it was prudent to make this move now to
make sure we could survive the fuel crunch'' caused by the Persian
Gulf crisis. The higher fuel prices are costing Midway $10 million
more in monthly operating costs, which Schick said is not being
replaced through higher fares.
   He said there will be some cuts from the 810-member work force
in Philadelphia. Many will be offered jobs at other Midway
locations.
   The sale is subject to federal approval.
   Effective Jan. 8, all non-stop service, involving 41 flights,
will be discontinued between Philadelphia and the following cities:
Albany, Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y.; Boston; Hartford, Conn.;
Columbus, Ohio; Las Vegas; New Orleans; Providence, R.I.; and
Montreal.
   Service on 20 daily flights from Philadelphia to Chicago,
Toronto, and points in Florida will continue through April 30.
   Schick said Midway will continue service out of Philadelphia
after April 30 by renting at least two gates. At the same time,
Midway will accelerate development of its Chicago hub starting Jan.
8 with additional flights to 14 destinations. The airline will use
aircraft redeployed from Philadelphia.
   Midway has offered service between Philadelphia and Chicago
since 1981. It made Philadelphia a hub a year ago when Eastern
moved out.
   Schick said Midway had high hopes for its Philadelphia hub and
was looking forward to showing a profit in the last three months of
1990 until Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   ``The shock to the petroleum market more than doubled our fuel
costs, and we decided we didn't want that problem to manage us,''
he told reporters in explaining why Midway, established 11 years
ago, was going to concentrate its business from Chicago.
   ``We feel this move back to our core business is the right way
to go, and will allow us to continue to grow in the future,'' he
said.
   ``This is a hard business decision, and one we didn't reach
easily. We would prefer to stay in Philadelphia but the economic
reality forces us to leave,'' Schick said.

   The stock market gained more ground today,
extending Thursday's rally as oil prices and interest rates
receded.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 64.85 on Thursday,
climbed 25.00 to 2,477.72 by 2 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 1,066 up,
457 down and 399 unchanged.
   Oil prices, which have turned downward of late, took a big drop
in today's activity.
   Crude oil futures for November delivery fell nearly $2 a barrel,
to the neighborhood of $35 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The resulting letup in inflationary worries helped push interest
rates lower in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government
bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates,
rose about $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Analysts said that gave stock traders the encouragement they
needed to keep following through on the rally that began Thursday.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 1 at
47~; General Electric, up &lsqb;&rsqb; at 54|; American Express, up \ at 18|,
and Pepsico, up | at 24{.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage fell 6\ to 31|. On Thursday the
company said it was charging $124 million in losses to reserves on
its mortgage portfolios for the third quarter.
   Applied Materials tumbled 4\ to 18} in the over-the-counter
market. The company said its revenues and profits for the fiscal
quarter ending Oct. 28 wouldn't live up to expectations.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.72 to 168.85. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.29 at 293.13.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 138.37 million shares with two

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Executives of General Motors Corp. and the United
Auto Workers union signed a new three-year labor contract Friday
guaranteeing the wages of about 300,000 U.S. workers.
   GM Chairman Robert Stempel and UAW President Owen Bieber signed
the documents as more than three dozen members of both bargaining
teams sat around the huge bargaining table in GM headquarters.
   Bieber is now expected to turn up the heat on Chrysler Corp.
when bargaining with the No. 3 automaker intensifies next week. But
he would talk only of the contract with GM.
   ``It's clearly a document I think speaks well for the workers
and the company, all of us together, to see to it we have a good,
successful operation here in the next three years and beyond,''
Bieber said. ``I think it's historic in many ways.''
   Stempel said the contract would help GM become more competitive
with Japanses automakers operating in the United States.
   The GM-UAW agreement was reached Sept. 17, two days after the
1987 contract expired. It was ratified in union voting late last
month by a 4-to-1 margin.
   The contract includes three years of wage guarantees for workers
laid off due to sales dips, no changes in cost-of-living or health
care provisions, and a 3 percent increase in base wages in the
first year along with 3 percent lump-sum payments in each of the
next two years.
   The agreement raises the base wage for a GM assembler, the most
common classification of worker, by 42 cents an hour to $14.44
before cost-of-living adjustments.
   The union used its contract with GM as a model for a three-year
agreement reached Oct. 7 with Ford. That agreement is expected to
be ratified when rank-and-file voting ends Sunday for Ford's
100,000 workers.
   Next up is Chrysler and its 50,000 workers, and the union
intends to use the contracts reached with GM and Ford as the base
for negotiations, even though Chrysler is in worse financial shape.
   The talks are expected to begin Monday or Tuesday at Chrysler
headquarters in Highland Park.

<DATELINE>MADRID, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Independent truck drivers on Friday ended
an 11-day strike that had forced factory shutdowns, disrupted fresh
food distribution and cost the Spanish economy more than $500
million, according to official estimates.
   Luis Soldevilla, who represented the 8,000 striking drivers in
negotiations with the government, announced the decision to end the
strike after an eight-hour meeting with Transport Ministry
officials.
   Government officials had agreed to negotiate with the truck
drivers on Wednesday after striking drivers agreed to remove
pickets from border areas and urban wholesale markets.
   Early reports indicated the agreement would establish a sliding
scale on which hauling rates would increase with the price of fuel.
   The agreeement also would provide increased government benefits
for the self-employed truck drivers, according to reports.
   The strike began Oct. 9 and forced automobile plants in Spain
and France to shut down and restricted production at steel, paper
and electrical appliance factories.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed narrowly
mixed Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade as harvest-related
selling offset buying linked to new export sales of wheat and
soybeans.
   The Midwestern corn and soybean harvest accelerated Friday as
dry weather returned to the region, analysts said. Fieldwork was
expected to continue at a brisk pace although showers were expected
to move into the region late in the weekend.
   Wheat futures drew light support from an Agriculture Department
announcement that China bought about 450,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices.
   Government figures showing increased export demand for soybeans
provided support in the bean market.

rose about $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Analysts said that gave stock traders the encouragement they

<HEAD>American Brands Reports 39 Percent Increase in Quarterly Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OLD GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Brands Inc. reported Friday
that its net income rose 39 percent in the third quarter, due
partly to increased cigarette sales and the sale of a
Netherlands-based tobacco company.
   Net income for the consumer products holding company in the
quarter ended Sept. 30 was $231 million or $1.16 per share,
compared with $166 million or 86 cents per share last year.
   All per-share amounts reflect a two-for-one stock split
effective Oct. 9.
   Third-quarter revenue rose 26 percent to $3.9 billion, from $3.1
billion last year.
   ``Our largest core business, tobacco, had another excellent
quarter with record results and higher cigarette unit sales both
internationally and domestically,'' said William J. Alley, the
company's chairman and chief executive officer.
   Alley reported worldwide cigarette sales increased 6.8 percent
over last year's third quarter, while the July sale of Theodorus
Niemeyer, a Netherlands tobacco company, brought a net gain of $31
million or 16 cents per share.
   American Brands' distilled spirits business posted revenue gains
of 32 percent to $236 million while operating income rose 12
percent to $28 million.
   American Brands also makes and markets hardware and home
improvement products, office products and life insurance.
   For the first nine months, the company had net income of $585
million or $2.97 per share, up 27 percent from $459 million or
$2.38 per share in the same period last year.
   Revenues rose 11 percent to a record $10 billion, from $9
billion last year.

<HEAD>Cable Regulation Bill Dead, Backers Say</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Subs 2nd graf to clarify compromise. Also moving on general
news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate backers of a bill to regulate cable TV
prices said Friday the compromise measure was dead for the year
after they failed to move it to a floor vote.
   The defeat marked the end of three weeks of private negotiations
between Sens. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and Tim Wirth, D-Colo., to
soften language in the bill that would have prevented cable
programmers from making exclusive contracts with cable system
operators.
   It also culminated a two-year effort to meld two dozen cable
bills into a law that would address rising concerns about shoddy
service and cable charges, which have risen 43 percent in the last
three years. Cable fees were deregulated by Congress in 1987.
   Gore and Wirth had reached a compromise they hoped would make
the bill palatable to the White House, which has threatened all
along to veto the measure.
   But White House chief of staff John Sununu this week urged
several Republican senators to place a ``hold'' on the bill to
prevent its coming up for a floor vote, congressional and industry
sources said.
   In addition, several amendments would have required hours of
debate that couldn't be scheduled this late in the congressional
session, said the sources, who requested anonymity.
   Gore, speaking on the chamber's floor Friday, said it had become
``painfully clear that the White House, with anti-consumer
ideology, has successfully killed cable legislation for this
Congress by urging a number of our Republican colleagues to put
`holds' on the cable legislation.''
   He predicted ``a new round of rate increases for cable
television all over the United States.''
   The cable industry was dead-set against the contract exclusivity
provisions. The Wirth-Gore amendment would have allowed some
exclusive contracts.
   Gore claimed that proponents of regulating cable charges would
propose a stronger bill next year, when telephone companies, which
failed in a massively financed lobbying effort this year to be
allowed into the cable TV business, are expected to resume their
campaign.
   The ``wireless cable'' and back yard and direct-broadcast
satellite industries, championed by Gore, also are expected to seek
bigger gains against their wired cable competitors next year.
   Wirth, whose district includes several major cable companies,
had almost single-handedly stalled the bill three weeks ago. He
complained that legislation that had started out as a modest
attempt to restrain prices and improve service had been loaded down
like a ``flatbed truck'' with business restrictions.
   The House and Senate bills aimed at requiring cable systems to
provide a ``basic tier'' of local broadcast and public TV channels
and at requiring the FCC to monitor rates for cable-owned
programming, such as MTV.

<HEAD>Europeans Can't Overcome Stalemate on Farm Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European Community agriculture ministers
failed Friday to break a deadlock over a plan to cut government
payments to farmers, casting doubt on the outcome of key world
trade negotiations.
   The ministers, struggling with the proposal for the third time
in two weeks, gave up and asked their foreign ministers to try to
settle the dispute on Monday in Luxembourg.
   ``It's a very sad day for the EC,'' said British Agriculture
Secretary John Gummer, who supported the plan for a 30 percent cut
in key farm subsidies.
   ``It's very sad that some countries have put their own
nationalist views ahead of our own interests and those of the whole
world,'' he said.
   The community's proposal was drawn up in attempts to end a
bitter fight with the United States over farm supports in the
Uruguay Round of world trade talks.
   The United States, backed by Australia, Argentina and others,
wants the community to make deep cuts in its costly farm programs.
They contend resolution of the farm dispute is key to a successful
outcome of the trade talks.
   The four year negotiations, involving 100 industrialized and
developing nations, are an ambitious effort to overhaul the world
trading system and reduce protectionist barriers.
   But the community's inability to endorse a modest package of
farm cuts throws a shadow over the talks, due to end in December in
Brussels.
   ``It's not possible to have a (trade) agreement without an
agriculture agreement,'' said Gummer. ``For many poor countries
agriculture is all they've got.''
   Italian Agriculture Minister Vito Saccemandi told reporters the
ministers gave up after failing to get ``total solidarity'' for the
proposal put forward by the European Commission, the community's
executive body.
   Germany's farm minister, Ignaz Kiechle, hardened his opposition
to the package and demanded compensatory measures to make up for
income losses to farmers, officials said.
   ``If there is no change in the position of the commission, then
there will also be no change in our position,'' Kiechle told
reporters.
   The Germans ``clearly did not come for a solution,'' said
Gummer.
   Ray MacSharry, the commission's top farm official, defended the
proposal as ``reasonable and realistic'' and said it was
``politically and socially possible to implement.''
   The proposal would snip farm subsidies on cereals, rice, sugar
and livestock by 30 percent over a 10-year period, starting in
1986. A 10 percent cut was proposed in fruits, vegetables and
tobacco.
   No specific reductions were outlined for the community's export
subsidy program, used to help pricey European products find buyers
on the world market. But there were hints the community was willing
to discuss some cuts.
   Commission officials who drew up the original plan have so far
been unwilling to tamper with the wording.
   Denmark, Britain and the Netherlands supported the proposal from
the outset. Italy and Belgium were said to be leaning toward it at
the end.
   If the foreign ministers failed to act next week, the issue
could be added to the agenda of the leaders of the dozen nations at
the European Community summit Oct. 27-28 in Rome.
   Because of the deadlock, the community was forced to miss last
Monday's deadline for presenting final offers in the Uruguay Round
talks. The community is the only major member of the negotiations
which has not yet produced its proposal.
   In its latest offer, the United States asked trading partners to
pare export subsidies by 90 percent and farm income supports by 75
percent over a 10-year period starting in 1991.
   It also called for converting non-tariff barriers to imported
goods into tariffs - giving a numerical value to barriers that
restrict imports of foreign goods - and then trimming the rates by
an average of 75 percent, again over 10 years.
   In the Uruguay Round, negotiators are trying to lower barriers
to trade in 15 areas, including not only agriculture, but also
textiles, manufactured goods and services, such as investment.
   The talks are held under the auspices of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, a forum and an agreement for promoting freer
world trade.
   Community members are: Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain.

<HEAD>Bank Of New England Reports Third Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS TORCHIA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bank of New England Corp. reported a loss of
$123.2 million or $1.78 a share in the third quarter, due largely
to a $100 million provision for possible credit losses, company
officials said Friday.
   The company blamed its losses on the slowdown of the New England
economy, worsened by rising oil prices and Middle East
uncertainties.
   BNEC also suffered a $48 million loss in operating earnings for
the quarter, the company said. A $31 million gain, due partly to
reduced pension obligations because of a smaller work force, helped
offset the losses.
   ``It just portrays a picture of how difficult it is for a weak
bank to function in an economic environment that is still
deteriorating,'' said James Moynihan, a bank stocks specialist for
Advest, a Hartford, Conn.-based brokerage firm.
   The company also presented an exchange offer Friday to the heads
of committees representing holders of the company's $706 million in
debt.
   The exchange, if agreed upon, would recapitalize the holding
company, officials said.
   Despite the loss, BNEC has made strides in its strategic
recovery program, company Chairman Lawrence K. Fish said in a
statement.
   Non-performing loans decreased $93 million for the quarter to
$2.136 billion on September 30, Fish said.
   Costs dropped from the $90 million a month operating level in
January to $71 million a month at the end of September, he said.
   By September 30, the company's workforce had been reduced to
12,500 from over 17,500 in January. The holding company had planned
to reduced its employees by 6,000 by the first quarter of 1991.
   ``I think they're probably two to three months behind schedule,
but nevertheless they are making progress,'' Moynihan said.
   Bank of New England is a Boston-based bank holding company with
assets of $23 billion. It has offices in Maine, Connecticut and
Rhode Island.

<HEAD>The Lower the Expectations, the Better Things Look</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES M. KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If only President Bush had tried a little
reverse psychology.
   The nation stumbled into a budget crisis after the president and
congressional leaders peddled a plan for tax increases and spending
cuts that few constituencies were willing to buy.
   The budgeteers might better have nursed their plan along with
less fanfare, rather than promote such a bitter pill as a miracle
cure for the widening federal deficit.
   The strategy is called lowering expectations and it worked
wonders this past week on Wall Street, where the stock market
rallied even while digesting big doses of bad news.
   Lowest of all expectations were those for the repair of the
ill-fated budget compromise itself. Investors were prepared for any
disappointment after watching the messy collapse of the original
deal.
   The markets were likewise girded for disaster on the corporate
and economic fronts.
   How else to explain a $4.25 rise in Digital Equipment Corp.
stock to $51 on Thursday in response to a 83 percent drop in the
computer company's quarterly earnings?
   Answer: The market was prepared for a loss. Any sign of
profitability from Digital was cause for celebration.
   Among other less-than-calamitous results, Citicorp reported a 38
percent plunge in quarterly profits, but staved off a dividend cut.
BankAmerica's profit rose 11 percent. Coca-Cola's earnings
increased 9 percent. IBM earnings were up 27 percent.
   That's not to say there weren't some results that smarted even
when viewed through rose-colored glasses. Losses for the fiscal
year at Macy, the big retailer, were said to have tripled to more
than $215 million. MCI, the communications company, suffered a $176
million third-quarter loss after taking a big charge to upgrade
equipment. AMR, parent of American Airlines, said quarterly
earnings sank 52 percent and predicted worse for the fourth
quarter.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ECONOMY: Inflation Bad, But Understandable</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Low expectations also cushioned the impact of the government's
economic numbers.
   Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was up 0.8
percent in September, which computes to a 9.5 percent annual rate.
But the jump was mostly due to the runup in oil prices from the
Persian Gulfcrisis. So-called ``core'' inflation - prices excluding
food and energy - was 0.3 percent for the month, down from 0.5
percent in August.
   The pickup in inflation was good news to 40 million Social
Security recipients, who will be getting the biggest boost in
benefits in 8{ years. Based on the CPI report, the government
announced a 5.4 percent rise in benefits beginning in January.
   Among other bad numbers, the merchandise trade deficit widened
in August, and housing starts extended their slide to eight months
in September.

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Milken Hearings Claim Victim</HEAD>

   Grassgreen's name surfaced at the hearings in connection with
Drexel's sale of Storer Communications securities, which

six felonies, will learn his own fate after the hearings conclude.
   Unfortunately for people like Grassgreen, Judge Kimba Wood

<HEAD>DEALS: Trump Threatens Bankruptcy, Sir James Makes a Swap</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump launched an offensive in his debt wars by unveiling
a new repayment plan for bondholders of his Taj Mahal casino. The
carrot came tied to a stick, in the form of a warning that turning
the plan down would land everyone in bankruptcy court.
   The threat didn't much frighten bondholders, who said a
bankruptcy court fight would be preferable to Trump's new deal.
   The restructuring would give bondholders about a 20 percent
equity stake in the Atlantic City casino in return for easier
repayment terms on $675 million in junk bonds.
   The bondholders said their status as first mortgage holders on
the palatial Taj would usher them to the front of the creditors'
line in bankrupcty court.
   Across the Atlantic, another big dealmaker was cutting a
Trump-sized deal of his own. Sir James Goldsmith, a corporate
raider in semi-retirement, re-emerged with a friendly swap of
assets with Hanson PLC.
   The deal involved trading Hanson's 49 percent stake in Newmont
Mining, the leading U.S. gold company, for Sir James' Cavenham
Forest Industries, a major American timber company.
   The ``trees-for-gold'' exchange was deemed an even trade at $1.3
billion. Sir James said he liked the long-term outlook for gold
despite its recent market slide.

<HEAD>AIRLINES: Final Chapter for UAL Deal</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. filed a record $22 billion order for new Boeing
aircraft, then made peace with Conston Partners, its largest
shareholder and the inspiration behind a failed takeover attempt by
the company's unions.
   The developments virtually snuffed out any remaining chance for
the union buyout, which had been on and off for a year.
   Coniston agreed not to participate in any attempt to acquire UAL
for the next 2{ years in exchange for two seats on the board of the
parent of United Airlines.
   The investment group had threatened to oust UAL directors unless
the buyout was approved. But the $4.4 billion bid failed last week
when the unions exhausted their financing options.
   The company now must turn attention to negotiating new contracts
with the disgruntled unions.
   Elsewhere, Northwest Airlines was trying to explain how hand
soap got into the hydraulic systems of two jets. The so-called
honest mistake was made by an Atlanta mechanic who inadvertantly
filled a hydraulic supply tank with a small amount of liquid soap.
The planes were flown for about 10 days without incident before the
contamination was discovered.

<HEAD>Pulitzer Reports 56 Percent Drop in Third-Quarter Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pulitzer Publishing Co. on Friday reported a 56
percent drop in profits for the third quarter, the third straight
quarter of falling profits for the St. Louis-based media company.
   The company, which reported a 33 percent decrease in profits
last quarter and a 70 percent decrease in the first quarter,
continued to blame soft newspaper advertising conditions.
   In addition, third-quarter profits were affected by costs
related to the purchase of a television station, WDSU-TV in New
Orleans, in December.
   Net earnings for the quarter ended Sept. 30 were $1.4 million,
or 13 cents a share, down from $3.2 million, or 31 cents a share,
for the same period last year.
   Revenues of $98 million were up 3.5 percent from last year's
$94.6 million.
   ``While our third-quarter results are disappointing, we are
optimistic over the long term as we continue to emphasize market
share and cost control,'' said Joseph Pulitzer Jr., chairman of the
board.
   For the first three quarters, net income was $6.9 million or 66
cents a share, down from $13.2 million or $1.26 a share during the
same period last year. Revenue for the year increased to $297
million from $256 million.
   Pulitzer's newspaper operations include two major metropolitan
dailies, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and The Arizona Daily Star in

<HEAD>Phone Company Hoping to Trim Payroll by 1,600</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southwestern Bell Corp. hopes to trim 1,600
management-level employees from its telephone subsidiary by the end
of the year with a voluntary incentive program, company officials
said Friday.
   ``That's kind of a target number. If it goes above or falls
short then that's what we get. It's not locked in concrete,'' said
Bob Dickemper, vice president of human resources for the company.
   Changes in the way the company is run and improved technology
have reduced the company's needs for managers, he said.
   Southwestern Bell, like many other large corporations, has tried
for the past several years to give more responsibility to employees
at all levels and decrease the layers of management.
   The company conducted a similar job-reduction program in 1986
and 2,000 managers left their jobs, Dickemper said.
   The telephone subsidiary, which provides phone service to 9.5
million homes and businesses in Missouri, Kansas, Texas, Oklahoma
and Arkansas, will limit by state the number of managers who take
advantage of the program.
   ``There should really be no widespread impact on any particular
community,'' he said.
   Incentives will vary by length of employment, Dickemper said,
with a maximum payout of one-year's salary to employees with more
than 20 years of service.
   About 17,000 of the telephone subsidiary's 58,000 workers have
managerial positions.
   On Thursday, the company reported a third-quarter profit of $323
million, or $1.08 a share, an increase of 9.5 percent from the same
period a year ago.
   The cost of the incentive program announced Friday will be
charged to fourth quarter operations, Dickemper said, but he
declined to estimate how much it would be.

<TEXT>
   Billionaire Harold Simmons' NL Industries Inc. may
try to increase its investment in Lockheed Corp., documents show.
   In a filing with the Securities Exchange Commission on Thursday,
Houston-based NL Industries said it is again considering buying a
controlling interest in the California-based defense contractor.
   NL holds holds just less than 20 percent of Lockheed's
outstanding common shares and has repeatedly sought to increase its
stake. Earlier this year, NL lost a bid to unseat Lockheed's board
of directors and is currently challenging the voting rights of
Lockheed's stock option plan. The plan controls about 17 percent of
Lockheed stock, complicating chances for a hostile bid for the
company.
   In September, Lockheed refused NL's offer to acquire 10 million
Lockheed shares held in the employee stock plan for $35 each. That
would have boosted NL's stake to 35.6 percent.

   A small independent record label, American
Gramaphone, is offering customers a chance to listen to albums over
the telephone before they buy them.
   The Omaha record company believes the new ``personal preview''
service that uses a 900 telephone number is the first of its kind.
   ``As far as I know, for music and for being able to give people
their own choice as to what they are going to be able to hear,
there is no one else,'' said Richard Musil, director of consumer
response marketing for American Gramaphone.
   A person uses a touch-tone phone to call a 900 number and gets a
recorded message asking the caller to choose one of the 60 albums
in American Gramaphone's catalogue.
   Two selections from the album are played, lasting about a minute
each. The caller can listen to excerpts from four albums during
each call. A $2 charge is automatically added to the caller's
monthly telephone bill.
   If the caller buys an album during the call, $2 is deducted from
the price of the album.
   American Gramaphone is an independent label that is best known
for representing the groups Mannheim Steamroller and C.W. McCall.

   Lawmakers who for more than a year have wanted
to use trade to punish China's repression of democracy said Friday
they have pretty much given up the idea in the waning days of the
Congressional session.
   The House voted 247-174 Thursday to overrule President Bush's
decision in May to allow China to retain the low ``most favored
nation'' tariffs on its $12 billion in annual exports to the United
States through next year.
   That effort died when the Senate, rather than break off debate
on a deficit reduction bill, did not act before a midnight deadline
that Congress established in August for passing the resolution.
   ``I continue to believe that the president's renewal of this
special trade status is wrong,'' Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, said today. ``It is a signal to the Chinese
leadership ... that the United States views its brutal human rights
violations with complacency.''
   But Mitchell expressed no desire to bring before the Senate its
last few days in session a weaker version also approved by the
House that to make future renewals of China's most-favored-nation
status more difficult.
   That weaker version would condition the low tariffs on a
requirement that Beijing make ``substantial progress'' on meeting
several human rights objectives.
   Even if Mitchell brought the alternative to the Senate floor,
lawmakers said supporters lacked the two-thirds majorities needed
in both houses to override what administration officials said would
be a sure veto by Bush.
   ``The president was once the ambassador to China and he's got
his mind made up on it,'' said Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., chairman
of the House Ways and Means Committee's trade subcommittee. ``And
we don't have the votes to override him.''
   Bush, the American envoy to China during the 1970s before the
United States formally recognized its communist government, has
maintained that suspending most-favored-nation status would hurt
the Chinese people.
   ``It's no secret that the administration has been consistent in
its strong opposition to passage of both the bills,'' State
Department spokeswoman MargaretTutwiler said today.
   She said either measure ``could seriously damage our goal in
advancing U.S. economic, human rights and other foreign policy
interests in China as well as our interest in reaching a peaceful
settlement in the Persian Gulf and Cambodia.''
   Lifting the most-favored-nation trade status - granted to China
in 1980 - would increase tariffs on its exports to the United
States tenfold, drastically reducing the $18 billion in two-way
trade last year.
   Even though the measure was certain to be vetoed, sponsors said
its passage was needed nonetheless to send Chinese leaders a
message to end their repression of dissidents.
   ``We have to play the `good cop-bad cop' routine so the
president can tell the Chinese that Congress is tough and means
business,'' said Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.
   Before the Senate missed the deadline, the Chinese Foreign
Ministry said the House vote ``will exert destructive impacts on
the economic and trade relations between the two countries and will
surely result in a serious slide back of the bilateral relations.''

   Meredith Corp. said Friday its earnings
shot up more than six times in the first quarter of its fiscal
year, reflecting one-time gains from the sale of assets.
   Earnings from continuing operations nudged up just 1.3 percent
for the diversified media company with interests in publishing,
broadcasting and real estate. Meredith is best known for its Better
Homes and Gardens and Ladies' Home Journal magazines.
   It reported profit of $60.9 million, or $3.62 a share, in the
first quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $9.3 million, or 50
cents a share, in the same period a year ago.
   The latest results included gains of $49.3 million from
Meredith's share of thesale of Meredith-Burda printing business to
R.R. Donnelley and Sons Co. and almost $3.6 million from the sale
of Sail magazine to Cahners Publishing.
   Revenue rose 3.6 percent to $179.4 million from $173.1 million a
year earlier.
   Earnings from continued operations rose to almost $5.4 million,
or 32 cents a share, from nearly $5.2 million, or 28 cents a share.
   Jack Rehm, Meredith's president, said the improvement in
first-quarter earnings from continuing operations reflected
increased profits from broadcast operations and higher interest
income.
   The interest income was associated with a note received from the
sale of the printing operation that had been jointly owned with the
Burda family of Germany.
   ``The Broadcasting Group benefited from lower operations
expenses. The reduction was primarily due to lower programming
costs that resulted from the fiscal 1990 write down of syndicated
programming investments,'' Rehm said.
   The broadcast writedown was just one of several factors that
produced a $49.9 million loss in the fourth quarter and a loss of
$26.4 million for the full fiscal year that ended June 30.
   Rehm reported operating earnings were held down in the first
quarter by a reduction in the number of advertising pages in
magazines, a drop in results from real estate operations and
heavier returns of book club products.
   A previously announced program to repurchase stock reduced the
average outstanding shares to 16.8 million as of Sept. 30 from 18.7
million a year earlier.
   In trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, Meredith stock
gained 50 cents to close at $21.75 per share.

   The group of European investors
that wants to buy part of the state phone company ENTel said Friday
it can't come up with the down payment by the Nov. 8 deadline.
   ``We need a few days more,'' officials from France Cables and
Radio and the Italian telecommunications company STET were quoted
as saying by the Diarios y Noticias news agency. The government did
not have an immediate comment.
   The U.S. phone company Bell Atlantic Corp. won the bid last June
but was forced to withdraw when it could not meet an Oct. 8
deadline to hand over the down payment.
   STET and France Cables and Radio took Bell's place, and agreed
to pay a down payment of more than $100 million cash and assume
some Argentine foreign debt by Nov. 8.
   Representatives have met for two weeks with government officials
to iron out the sales contract.
   ENTel, an aging system of 3 million lines that requires massive
investment the government cannot provide, will be divided into two
regional companies.
   A consortium led by the Spanish telecommunications company
Telefonica agreed to pay $100 million cash and and nearly $2.9
billion in debt securities for 60 percent of ENTel's southern
section.
   STET, France Cable and Radio, the U.S. bank J.P. Morgan and Co.
and the Argentine shipping-banking firm Perez Companc agreed to pay
about $2.5 billion in cash and debt securities for 60 percent share
of ENTel's northern section.

<HEAD>Trump Offers 20 Percent, Rating Agency Says Try Half</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump has offered investors in his Taj
Mahal bonds nearly 20 percent of the hotel and casino's equity, but
a debt-rating service says the bondholders are in a strong position
to get up to half.
   The way Fitch Investors Service Inc. figures it, the Taj Mahal's
cash flow can only cover half the interest expense on its $675
million in junk bonds that pay 14 percent interest.
   ``The bonds are worth half their par value based on the
company's inability to service the debt on the books,'' said Wayne
Josephson, one of the Fitch analysts who prepared the report on
Trump's Taj Mahal, one of the debt-dogged developer's most
worrisome problems. ``In restructuring we suggest bondholders would
demand to be compensated for the loss in the value of their
bonds.''
   However, Stephen Bollenbach, Trump's new chief financial
officer, doesn't agree. On Thursday, Trump announced he had offered
Taj bondholders 19.9 percent of the casino in return for reducing
the interest rate to 9 percent. Trump said in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing that bankruptcy court may be the only
resort if the offer is turned down.
   The day before the SEC filing, Bollenbach said the Taj Mahal's
long-term prospects are not as bad as the Fitch calculations
suggest.
   ``There's plenty of public data out there that would indicate
that on an ongoing basis the property could do much better than
that,'' Bollenbach said.
   ``It's one of the ironies of the world we live in today. Here's
the Taj Mahal that's a brand new business that's doing a terrific
business but because of the way it's financed it's not currently
covering its debt service.
   ``That doesn't mean it's a business that's permanently impaired.
I think the bondholders realize that.''
   Wilbur Ross, adviser to bondholders and a senior managing
partner at Rothschild Inc., rejected the Trump offer. In a
statement, Ross said he is pushing for majority interest in the
Atlantic City resort in exchange for an interest-rate cut smaller
than the 5 percent reduction suggested by Trump.
   ``We're miles apart on just about every single issue,'' Ross
said.
   According to the Trump filing, the bondholders earlier this
month sought 85 percent of the equity in the hotel and casino.
   Ross said the bondholders stood to get a better deal than
Trump's latest offer if the business filed for bankruptcy
protection.
   In addition to the interest-rate cut, Trump also wants the
bondholders to let him make a $47.3 million interest payment Nov.
15 with more bonds, allow some of the interest in the future to be
paid with more bonds and extend the issue's maturity two years to
September 2000.
   Fitch concludes that bondholders are bearing most of the risk in
Trump's casino bonds, since the developer has not guaranteed them
with his own money and his 100 percent ownership in the Taj Mahal,
Trump Plaza and Trump Castle is pledged to his bank lenders.
   The banks, Fitch says, would be willing to relinquish their
claim to some of the equity to keep the Taj a going concern. A Taj
failure could ripple throughout Trump's empire, making the banks'
potential losses extend far beyond Atlantic City.
   One thing on Trump's side: The bondholders, who stand a good
chance of getting the casino from a bankruptcy court, don't have a
license to operate the place. The New Jersey Casino Control
Commission would represent yet another hurdle for the bondholders
trying to keep their investment alive.
   ``Without a license to operate a casino, bondholders hold the
first mortgage on an empty building without any operating
business,'' Fitch said.
   With a shortage of people looking to own an Atlantic City
casino, selling the elaborate property could be tough.
   Casinos are historically thought of as recession-proof, but
aren't getting that treatment this time around.
   Atlantic City casinos, which depend on middle-class daytrippers
from the economically slumping Northeast, are seen as particularly
vulnerable.
   While Las Vegas attracts higher-income gamblers who stay for
days at a time, the typical Atlantic City visitor has less
discretionary income and is likely to feel the pinch of a recession
sooner.
   Also, Atlantic City casinos in general are deeper in debt than
those in Las Vegas.
   ``Their cash flow is so tight to service the debt, that even a
mild slowdown could make the difference between having enough cash
or not having enough cash,'' Josephson said.

<HEAD>Varity Corp. Clears Way for Move to Buffalo </HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Varity Corp. has reached an agreement with
Canada officials and the Canadian Auto Workers Union allowing the
company to move its headquarters from Toronto to Buffalo next year,
officials said.
   Varity, formerly Massey-Ferguson Ltd., was saved from bankruptcy
by a multi-million dollar bailout by the Ontario and Canadian
federal governments in 1981.
   The manufacturer of farm equipment and auto parts agreed to pay
penalties of $21 million in Canadian dollars ($18 million U.S.) to
the Ontario and Canadian governments, as well as about $27 million
in Canadian dollars ($23 million U.S.) to pay outstanding claims by
workers who lost their jobs after a 1986 plant closing.
   The agreement, announced Thursday by Ontario Premier Bob Rae and
Varity, clears the way for Varity to relocate about 50 workers here
after the company's reincorporation in the United States. The
company's 1,200 permanent manufacturing and processing jobs would
remain in Canada.
   Sheila Copps, a Canadian parliament member, criticized the
settlement, saying it offers ``peanuts and crumbs'' to about 450
Varity workers she said will lose their jobs at a plant in Windsor,
Ontario.
   But Neil D. Arnold, the company's senior vice president and
chief financial officer, said Varity was ``determined to reach a
reasonable settlement, remembering that the governments' timely
investment nearly 10 years ago helped us keep afloat and gave us
the opportunity to undertake our strategic recovery plan.''
   Varity, with annual sales of $2.4 billion (U.S.), would rank
among the top 130 companies in the Fortune 500 list of largest U.S.
public firms.
   Fifty percent of Varity's sales are in the United States, with
Canada accounting for just 4 percent of its worldwide business.
   Varity first announced the move to the United States in July,
but the plans had been threatened until Thursday's agreement.
   The agreement, which has been approved by the two governments
and Varity's board of directors, was designed to compensate the
Canadian government for its bailout, and to excuse Varity from its
1986 promise to keep its headquarters in Canada.
   Varity has purchased a mansion in Buffalo that company officials
said is the probable site for its headquarters.
   The move to Buffalo must first be approved by the company's
board, then submitted to its shareholders, 82 percent of whom are
Americans.
   A decision on the move could be made by late March, said Jack R.
Nowling, a Varity spokesman.

   The stock market swept ahead for the second
straight session Friday in buying inspired by falling oil prices
and lower interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 68.07 to 2,520.79
on top of Thursday's 64.85-point gain.
   For the week the average rose 122.77 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,129 up, 499 down and 375 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached 221.48 million
shares, up from 204.12 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 255.82 million shares.
   Oil prices, which have turned downward of late, took a big drop
in Friday's activity.
   Crude oil futures for November delivery tumbled more than $3 a
barrel, to less than $34 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   The resulting letup in inflationary worries helped push interest
rates lower in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government
bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates,
rose more than $5 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Analysts said that gave stock traders the encouragement they
needed to follow through on the rally that began Thursday.
   Many observers agree that a break in oil prices and interest
rates would go a long way toward cushioning the impact of the
recession that is presumed to have begun around midyear.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up 1{ at
48&rsqb;; International Business Machines, up 2\ at 107|; Coca-Cola, up
2&rsqb; at 45}; Exxon, up 1&rsqb; at 49~, and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 2\ at 80&rsqb;.
   Among retailing issues, Sears Roebuck rose 2 to 25~; Woolworth
1&lsqb; to 27&lsqb;; Wal-Mart Stores 1&rsqb; to 27}; K mart | to 24~; J.C. Penney
~ to 41~, and Toys R Us } to 23&lsqb;.
   Federal Home Loan Mortgage fell 5 to 31&rsqb;. On Thursday the
company said it was charging $124 million in losses to reserves on
its mortgage portfolios for the third quarter.
   Applied Materials tumbled 3~ to 19&lsqb; in the over-the-counter
market. The company said its revenues and profits for the fiscal
quarter ending Oct. 28 wouldn't live up to expectations.

<HEAD>Precious Metal Rally Continues Amid Hopes Fed Will Ease</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Precious metal futures prices rose for the third straight day
Friday, partially offsetting recent steep losses as a sharp drop in
oil prices stirred speculation that interest rates may fall.
   On other commodity markets, copper futures rose sharply,
livestock and meat futures were mixed; and grains and soybean were
mixed.
   Gold futures settled $2.70 to $2.80 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the spot price, represented by the contract
for October delivery, at $372.80 a troy ounce; silver was 5.8 cents
to 6.1 cents higher with October at $4.258 a troy ounce.
   Platinum outpaced the other precious metals. Platinum futures
ended $10.50 to $11.50 higher on the New York Mercantile Exchange
with October at $407.70 a troy ounce.
   The metals virtually ignored a number of traditionally bearish
signals including sharply higher stock prices, a stronger dollar
and a drop in oil prices.
   Instead, metal traders focused on the deflationary implications
of lower oil prices, which fell on perceptions that the Iraq-U.S.
standoff in the Middle East is moving toward a peaceful settlement.
   The letup in inflationary worries prompted speculation that the
Federal Reserve Board may take action to lower bank lending rates.
   ``The last time the Fed indicated it was easing credit policy
back in July, that's when gold accelerated to the upside,'' said
Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst for PaineWebber Inc.
   John Jonat, who trades precious metals for Deak International
Inc., also said gold's rise was a spillover from the platinum
market, which was boosted by strong Japanese demand.
   Both Jonat and Peter Cardillo, commodity trading adviser for
Jesup, Josephthal &amp; Co., said gold could climb as high as $390 an
ounce before hitting pressure to fall.
   In petroleum trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, light
sweet crude oil ended $2 to $3.01 lower with November at $33.79 a
barrel; heating oil was 6 cents to 8.11 cents lower with November
at 88.40 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 4 cents to 5.05
cents lower with November at 87.91 cents a gallon.
   Strength in the stock market contributed to a strong rally in
copper futures on the Commodity Exchange. Copper has many
applications in the manufacturing and construction industries, so
its price responds strongly to economic signals.
   Copper futures ended 1.5 cents to 3.8 cents higher with October
at $1.267 a pound.
   Cattle futures rose moderately on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in line with stronger cash-market fundamentals. Traders
also evened their positions ahead of the government's quarterly
cattle-on-feed report, which will be released Monday afternoon.
   Hog futures fell slightly while pork bellies advanced.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .50 cent higher with October at
79.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .60 cent
higher with October at 86.85 cents a pound; live hogs were .20 cent
lower to .13 cent higher with October at 57.17 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were 1.17 cents to 1.8 cents higher with
February at 67.17 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures were little changed on the Chicago
Board of Trade as harvest-related selling offset buying linked to
new export sales of wheat and soybeans.
   Wheat futures drew light support from an Agriculture Department
announcement that China bought about 450,000 metric tons of U.S.
wheat at subsidized prices.
   Wheat futures finished unchanged to } cent higher with December
at $2.63} a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1 cent higher with December
at $2.28\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to \ cent lower with
December at $1.23 a bushel; soybeans were { cent to 3 cents higher
with November at $6.11{ a bushel.

<HEAD>The Hartford Refutes Consumer Group Claims Of Financial
Vulnerability</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds two grafs at end with USF&amp;G statement. Also moving on
general news wires.</NOTE>

   The consumer group Public Citizen admitted
Friday it made a mistake in putting the ITT Hartford Insurance
group on a list of five property and casualty insurance companies
it said could fail in the event of a recession.
   ITT Hartford said it was Public Citizen, not the insurance
company, that ``flunked the test.''
   The consumer group, affiliated with Ralph Nader, issued a
statement acknowledging the error but standing by it's report's
``fundamental conclusion: property and casualty companies should
improve their business practices to avoid solvency problems in the
future.''
   Public Citizen said Monday that the Hartford, Aetna, American
International Group, Liberty Mutual and United States Fidelity &amp;
Guaranty each failed four of six tests that it used to measure
vulnerability to insolvency.
   The group said none of the companies was on the edge of
insolvency but ``the underlying weakness in their financial
condition is clearly evident.''
   All five companies, along with the Insurance Information
Institute, took issue with the report. Some described it as
irresponsible.
   One of the six tests used by Public Citizen was whether a
company's surplus - the available backup funds for use in cases of
catastrophic or unexpected losses - had declined since 1972.
   It found that Hartford's surplus, measured in 1967 dollars, had
dropped from $1.1 billion in 1972 to $735 million in 1988, a
decline of 33 percent.
   Jim Westervelt, vice president and group comptroller for the
Hartford, said the figure used for 1972 represented the surpluses
of all of the Hartford companies.
   The 1988 figure, on the other hand, represented only the
consolidated surpluses of Hartford Fire Insurance Company and its
property and casualty subsidiaries.
   The company said, and Public Citizen acknowledged, that use of
the correct figures would have shown that the Hartford's 1988
surplus was up 6 percent from 1972.
   ``As a result, The Hartford should not have been included among
the companies most financially vulnerable in the event of an
economic downturn,'' Public Citizen said.
   It's statement said that data in the industry publication Best's
Aggregates and Averages, which it used to determine shrinkage of
surpluses, ``does not clearly indicate the pooling arrangements
within the Hartford in 1972.''
   Using the correct figures, it said, ITT Hartford has failed
three, not four, of the vulnerability tests.
   ``The Hartford's surplus has not deteriorated, and the company
should not have been listed as one of the five companies that were
found to have failed this test,'' the company said.
   Joel Freedman, a Hartford vice president in Washington, said the
Hartford had not examined whether the figures for the other four
companies were wrong.
   ITT said its independent auditors, Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., had
confirmed the error.
   ``Public Citizen, in fact, has flunked the test,'' ITT Hartford
said in a news release.
   Freedman said the company had been damaged because of
policyholders, agents and shareholders becoming concerned about the
Public Citizen report.
   Meanwhile, USF&amp;G issued a statement from its Baltimore
headquarters saying that in applying its six tests Public Citizen
``misapplied critical financial data relating to USF&amp;G and
overlooked other financial information.''
   ``USF&amp;G's own analysis contradicts Public Citizen's conclusions
and establishes that USF&amp;G falls safely within the group of other
financially strong insurers analyzed in the report who were not
singled out,'' the statement said. ``Public Citizen's report was
shallow and misdirected.''

<HEAD>Dollar Stronger in New York, Weaker in Europe; Gold Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished mostly stronger in domestic
trading Friday after weakening in Europe, but foreign exchange
brokers said the U.S. currency remained wobbly because of American
economic uncertainty.
   Gold and silver prices rose.
   ``This is volatile stuff,'' said Lloyd G. Atkinson, chief
economist for the Bank of Montreal, ``and all indications are that
this is going to continue for some time.''
   Traders said the foreign exchange markets continued to display
pessimism about the dollar, especially in light of the prolonged
political stalemate in Washington over the budget deficit.
   ``Forex players remain skeptical of the dollar's upside
potential at this point,'' said Michael Faust, a currency analyst
with Money Market Services in Chicago.
   ``We've had comments all week from Japanese, U.S. and German
officials that they're either happy with the dollar right now or
they welcome further gains in the yen or the mark at the expense of
the dollar,'' Faust said.
   The dollar had fallen through a psychological barrier of 1.50
German marks to 1.4970 in New York Thursday, but it rebounded
Friday, closing at 1.5025 marks.
   In New York, traders said, the dollar's behavior was largely
influenced by the oil market. Oil fell by about $3 a barrel, easing
inflation fears and thereby helping the dollar rally a bit.
Inflation erodes the value of dollars.
   The dollar rose against the Japanese yen Friday, ending a long
slide.
   In Tokyo, the dollar finished trading at 125.25 yen, up 0.85
yen. Later in London, it was quoted at a higher rate of 125.90. In
New York, the dollar closed at 125.95 yen, up from 124.40 late
Thursday.
   In London, the cost for one British pound rose to $1.9590 from
$1.9540 late Thursday. At closing in New York, one pound cost
$1.9585, less expensive than Thursday's $1.9710.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.2680 Swiss francs, up from 1.2590; 5.0295 French
francs, up from 5.0165; 1,124.25 Italian lire, up from 1,122.00;
1.1731 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1698.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday
included: 1.5040 German marks, down from 1.5115; 1.2700 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2735; 5.0380 French francs, down from 5.0630;
1.6940 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7035; 1,127.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,132.75; 1.1675 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1750.
   Gold closed at $372.80 on the New York Commodity Exchange, up
from 370.10 Thursday. Republic National Bank quoted a late bid for
bullion of $372.75, up $1.75.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $372.75 a troy ounce
from $367.75 bid per ounce late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to a
closing bid of $372.50 from $366.50 late Thursday. Earlier in Hong
Kong, gold rose $6.00 to close at a bid $375.58.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled
at $4.295 per troy ounce, up from $4.198 Thursday. Silver bullion
rose in London to a late bid price of $4.28 a troy ounce from
Thursday's $4.18.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Rise as Dollar Climbs, Oil Price Drops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government bond prices rose Friday, boosted by a
runup in the value of the dollar and a drop in oil prices, traders
and analysts said.
   The price of the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond climbed
11-16 point, or about $6.88 per $1,000 in face amount. Its yield,
which falls when the bond's price rises, slipped to 8.75 percent
from 8.81 percent late Thursday.
   Bond prices opened higher, following a rise on overseas markets.
Bonds were boosted abroad by a dip in oil prices, said William
Pike, a managing director in the government bond-trading department
of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   The bond market has closely tracked oil prices since Iraq's Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait. The oil price rise has fueled fears of
increasing inflation, which reduces the value of fixed-return
securities such as bonds.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract for
the benchmark grade of oil fell $3.01 a barrel to settle at $33.79.
Oil prices fell amid signs of good supplies and slackened demand,
as well as indications that Iraq may be willing to negotiate a
pullout from Kuwait.
   Bond prices also were boosted by a jump in the value of the
dollar in foreign exchange, said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief
economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Inc. A stronger
dollar makes U.S. securities more attractive to global investors.
   In addition, Ricchiuto said, the bond market was boosted by a
report showing the economy continues to decline. The monthly index
on regional industrial activity put out by the Federal Reserve Bank
of Philadelphia fell to its fourth-lowest level ever last month, he
said.
   Signs of economic softening often boost bond prices because they
make it more likely the Federal Reserve will ease interest rates.
   Meanwhile, in the corporate bond market, prices of many
high-yield ``junk'' bonds rose sharply, boosted by the overall rise
in the bond market and a jump in stock prices. However, the rise
did not erase the losses junk bonds have suffered in recent days.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
issues rose from &lsqb; point to 9-32 point, intermediate-term issues
rose 13-32 point to 23-32 point, and long-term issues rose as much
as } point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial information
service.
   The movement of one point is equal to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.50 to 1,156.45.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.44 percent as the
discount dropped 3 basis points to 7.22 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 7.54 percent as the discount dropped 1
basis point to 7.18 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.51
percent as the discount slipped 5 basis points to 7.04 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 7 13-16 percent, down from
7 15-16 percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 8-32 point to 88 22-32. The average
yield to maturity fell to 7.77 percent from 7.79 percent late
Thursday.

   In the Soviet Union's most radical departure from
Communist economics in 70 years, the legislature voted Friday to
transform the economy into the market-oriented system advocated by
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   But a rift with the Russian Federation, the country's largest
republic, threatened to disrupt the effort.
   The Supreme Soviet voted 333-12, with nine abstentions, in favor
of Gorbachev's plan to free most prices of government control, end
most government monopolies and encourage free enterprise in this
nation of 285 million residents.
   Lawmakers had given the bill preliminary approval earlier before
debating amendments.
   It is an ambitious outline for ending chronic shortages of food
and housing, integrating the Soviet Union in the world market and
encouraging people to work harder and enjoy the benefits.
   The plan partially reverses decades of tight central control of
the nation's economy, unleashing market forces to determine prices,
what products to make, how to make them and where.
   Hours after the plan was approved, the government's statistics
agency released dismal figures for the economy's first nine months
of 1990. Gross national product was down 1.5 percent and inflation
was 9 percent, Tass reported.
   The plan hopes to reverse those trends, but its success rides on
officials in the 15 Soviet republics who must put it into effect
through local legislation.
   And the republics - increasingly anxious to break away from
central control because of decades of unfair treatment under
Kremlin economic policies - may not cooperate as much as necessary.
   The blueprint came under fire even before Friday's vote from
Gorbachev's main political rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, president of
the Russian Federation. On Friday, Gorbachev launched a
counterattack.
   ``Comrade Yeltsin's assertions are strange, to say the least,''
Gorbachev told the 542-member legislature.
   ``I'm under the impression that the Russian leadership is afraid
of difficulties and wants to pass responsibility ... onto central
organs of power,'' he said.
   Gorbachev said he shared many of Yeltsin's concerns about
deteriorating political and economic conditions and inflation. But
he accused the government of the Russian republic of contributing
to inflation with its recent decision to raise wholesale meat
prices.
   Yeltsin has lambasted Gorbachev's plan as a ``catastrophe'' that
is ``doomed to fail'' within months. He has said his own republic,
the largest and richest, may proceed with its own 500-day plan for
switching to a market economy as early as Nov. 1.
   In a 50-minute speech Friday, Gorbachev tried to persuade the
republics to sign onto his plan. Supporters say it allows the
republics wide latitude to tailor reforms to local conditions.
   He called the plan the only ``rational'' course of action. But
his speech won only five seconds of lukewarm applause.
   Stanislav Shatalin, author of the 500-day plan that Russia
adopted, told a news conference that although the Supreme Soviet
did not choose his plan, he endorses Gorbachev's outline.
   And in a clear reference to Yeltsin, he said the program's
success depends on ``political stabilization.''
   ``The republics' survival will depend on whether they act in
concert or not,'' Shatalin said.
   Another economist, deputy Soviet premier Leonid Abalkin, said
Yeltsin's actions could bring on ``chaos and disintegration,'' and
he called for people to express ``confidence in the president.''
   That confidence will be crucial to people's willingness to
endure the unemployment and inflation expected as the reforms
proceed.
   The reforms touch on the fundamentals of socialism, including
private ownership of businesses and of land. The republics were
left to decide who should be allowed to have private property and
whether to allow private ownership of land.
   Gorbachev acknowledged that some people were asking whether the
transition to a market economy was a departure from socialism.
   ``We are striving, not through declarations but in reality, to
strengthen socialism'' by maximizing potential, he told the
lawmakers.
   Gorbachev's plan would transform the moribund Soviet economy in
four stages. It sets no deadline for the switch, but says other
countries have achieved similar goals in 18 months to two years.
   The plan begins by cutting the budget deficit and the nation's
money supply, increasing production of consumer goods, raising bank
interest rates for savings and introducing land reform.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Rejects Request to Halt Planned Joint Trial</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES thruout with court ruling</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court on Friday rejected a
request that it halt the planned trial of 20 consolidated asbestos
injury claim cases.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied a request by USX
Corp. for a stay of Monday's scheduled trial before U.S. District
Judge Thomas D. Lambros. Chief Judge Gilbert Merritt said the court
would give its reasons for the denial in a memo to be issued next
week.
   The Pittsburgh-based USX is a defendant in three of the 20 cases
Lambros consolidated in his Cleveland court. Lambros and other
judges have consolidated asbestos cases in an effort to get rid of
backlogged cases.
   Still pending before the appeals court is USX's separate request
for an order prohibiting Lambros from proceeding with the
consolidated cases and requiring assignment of the cases to other
judges in northern Ohio.
   USX argued that the cases in which the company is a defendant
are unsuitable for what would amount to class-action grouping with
other, dissimilar cases. Lambros, a respondent in the USX petition,
has not filed a response to the request that the cases be
reassigned, court spokeswoman Debra Nagle said.
   The appeals court gave him until Tuesday to do so.
   Plaintiffs in the cases are Gret Lakes mariners who claim they
may have contracted cancer or other ailments because they were
exposed to asbestos or asbestos-containing material while on board
USX Corp. ships.
   Lambros and the other judges who consolidated the cases have
said it appears the defendants do not have enough money to pay all
the claims and costs in thousands of pending lawsuits.
   Defendants in some of the cases have objected to the judges'
efforts to consolidate their cases, saying they prefer to go to
trial and defend themselves independently of other plaintiffs.

<HEAD>TI Posts $7 Million Loss in Third Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. lost $7 million in the
third quarter, the company said Friday, blaming higher investment
spending and lower prices for semiconductors.
   The Dallas-based company said the loss amounted to 19 cents a
share, compared with a profit of $65 million, or 67 cents a share,
in the same quarter of 1989.
   Revenue totaled $1.68 billion, up 7 percent from $1.57 billion
for the same period last year.
   Third-quarter results also were hurt by the temporary disruption
of business at TI's semiconductor assembly-and-test operation in
Baguio, Philippines, following an earthquake in July. The plant was
closed one month.
   Jerry R. Junkins, TI's chairman, president and chief executive
officer, said in a letter to stockholders that ``although TI's high
level of investment is having a negative effect on current
financial performance,'' the company is making progress in the
semiconductor and defense electronics markets.
   He also said TI's more aggressive protection of its patents,
starting in 1986, ``has thus far generated cumulative royalty
revenues of more than $650 million.''
   The company is holding talks with Japanese and Korean chip
manufacturers to renegotiate patent agreements. Junkins said TI
expects to earn ``a significant ongoing stream of royalty revenue''
from those agreements.
   Junkins said the semiconductor market was sluggish in the third
quarter due to a worsening domestic economy.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Michael Milken stammered and rose from his desk
after learning speculator Ivan Boesky was cooperating with the
government's insider trading investigation in late 1986, a Milken
subordinate testified.
   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond salesman Terren
Peizer described on Friday a climate of fear after the Boesky deal.
   The comments came during a pre-sentencing hearing before U.S.
District Judge Kimba Wood on a series of alleged crimes the
government says were committed by Milken beyond those to which he
has pleaded guilty. Prosecutors hope to convince Wood that Milken
deserves a stiff punishment.

   DETROIT (AP) - Executives of General Motors Corp. and the United
Auto Workers union have signed a new three-year labor contract
guaranteeing the wages of about 300,000 U.S. workers.
   GM Chairman Robert Stempel and UAW President Owen Bieber signed
the documents Friday.
   Bieber is now expected to turn up the heat on Chrysler Corp.
when bargaining with the No. 3 automaker intensifies next week.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Midway Airlines says it will sell off its
unprofitable hub operations at the Philadelphia International
Airport and end 61 daily flights by April 30 as it faces even
greater losses due to fuel prices.
   The selloff, said Midway President Thomas Schick said, would
cost his airline about $30 million.
   David Hinson, Midway chairman and chief executive officer, said
in a statement that the sale was necessary to stabilize the
airline's financial condition and return it to profitability.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The consumer group Public Citizen has admitted
it made a mistake in putting the ITT Hartford Insurance group on a
list of five insurance companies it said could fail in the event of
a recession.
   ITT Hartford said it was Public Citizen, not the insurance
company, that ``flunked the test.''
   The consumer group, affiliated with Ralph Nader, on Friday
issued a statement acknowledging the error.
   Public Citizen said Monday that the Hartford, Aetna, American
International Group, Liberty Mutual and United States Fidelity &amp;
Guaranty each failed four of six tests that it used to measure
vulnerability to insolvency.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Senate backers of a bill to regulate cable TV
prices say the compromise measure is dead for the year, after they
failed to move it to a floor vote.
   Friday's defeat marks the end of three weeks of private
negotiations between Sens. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., and Tim Wirth,
D-Colo., to soften language in the bill to prevent cable
programmers from making exclusive contracts with cable system
operators.
   It also culminated a two-year effort to meld two dozen cable
bills into a law that would address rising concerns about shoddy
service and cable charges, which have risen 43 percent in the last
three years.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Lawmakers who for more than a year have wanted
to use trade to punish China's repression of democracy say they
have pretty much given up the idea in the waning days of the
Congressional session.
   The House voted 247-174 Thursday to overrule President Bush's
decision in May to allow China to retain ``most favored nation''
status.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he
disagreed with Bush's decision, but Mitchell said supporters lacked
the two-thirds majorities needed in both houses to override what
administration officials said would be a sure veto by Bush.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - An international panel said it would include
in a list of chemicals to be reviewed in 1992 a drug that could
induce cows to give more milk.
   The drug, bovine somatotropin or BST, is still under review by
the Food and Drug Administration for possible use by U.S. dairy
farmers. Tests indicate the synthetic hormone could increase a
cow's milk production by 10 percent to 25 percent.
   The Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods met
in closed session Friday.

   BOSTON (AP) - More bad news surfaced for one of New England's
largest banks. The Bank of New England Corp. reported a loss of
$123.2 million or $1.78 a share in the third quarter, due largely
to a $100 million provision for possible credit losses.
   The company blamed its losses on the slowdown of the New England
economy, worsened by rising oil prices and Middle East
uncertainties.

<HEAD>Kellogg Says International Sales Boosted 3rd Quarter Profit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Kellogg Co. said Friday that rising
international sales of its ready-to-eat cereal overcame slow U.S.
sales growth for a 31.8 percent jump in third-quarter profits,
exceeding analysts' expectations.
   The world's largest cereal maker said its net income rose to
$162.3 million, or $1.34, for the three months ended Sept. 30, from
$123.1 million, or $1.02 a share, for July-September 1989.
   Net sales reached $1.35 billion for the period, up from $1.20
billion a year earlier, Kellogg said.
   ``In the United States, our ready-to-eat cereal business
continues to be soft,'' said William E. LaMothe, chairman and chief
executive officer.
   Kellogg held about a 38.5 percent share of the U.S. cereal
market, down about two percentage points from a year earlier, said
food industry analyst Timothy Ramey of County NatWest USA in New
York.
   But the company, which makes cereal in 16 countries and sells it
in 130, had substantial gains in sales volume overseas and was
helped by favorable currency exchange rates, LaMothe said.
   Ramey said Kellogg's earnings exceeded his and many other
analysts' expectations by about 10 cents a share. He credited
strong international sales and cost-control programs by Kellogg.
   For the first nine months of the year, the company had net
earnings of $394.3 million, or $3.26 a share, on net sales of $3.82
billion, compared with net earnings of $412.3 million, or $3.38 a
share, on sales of $3.56 billion in the first nine months of 1989.
   Kellogg said the nine month earnings in 1989 were inflated by an
accounting change, however. Without it, net earnings for the
year-earlier period would have been $364.2 million, or $2.99 a
share, the company said.

   Michael Milken stammered and rose from his desk
after learning speculator Ivan Boesky was cooperating with the
government's insider trading investigation in late 1986, a Milken
subordinate testified Friday.
   Another witness offered the first evidence Milken may have
misled an important client during the $2.5 billion buyout of Storer
Communications Inc. in late 1985, then the biggest takeover deal
ever.
   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk-bond salesman Terren
Peizer described a climate of fear after the Boesky deal in which
workers speculated about government wiretaps and turned on water
faucets to drown conversations.
   Milken's lawyers raised the possibility of the first public
testimony by Milken after four years at the center of the
government's Wall Street probe. Defense lawyer Arthur Liman said he
may call Milken to the stand at the end of the special
pre-sentencing hearing in Manhattan federal court.
   The hearing before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood focuses on
alleged crimes by Milken beyond those to which he has pleaded
guilty. Prosecutors hope to convince Wood that Milken deserves a
stiff punishment by depicting a pattern of systematic lawbreaking
by the former head of Drexel's junk-bond operation.
   Milken, 44, pleaded guilty in April to six felony counts related
to illegal trading and agreed to pay $600 million in penalties. He
faces a maximum 28 years imprisonment.
   Theodore Ammon of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., an investment
firm that was one of Drexel's biggest customers, testified Milken
and associates received millions of dollars in equity in KKR's
Drexel-financed takeover of Storer without the firm's knowledge.
   The testimony was important because it suggested Milken may have
tried enrich himself, associates and customers while misleading KKR
about the reason. Ammon said Milken had told him the equity was
intended for third parties as an inducement to buy risky Storer
preferred securities.
   Prosecutors had charged earlier that Milken created partnerships
to reward customers who bought the risky Storer securities with
company stock. The government said the stock constituted a bribe.
   But the defense maintains that Milken and his associates had
acquired the equity because they had committed to purchasing more
than half of the $261 million preferred stock offering.
   Peizer, who sat beside Milken on Drexel's X-shaped trading desk,
said when news of Boesky's November 1986 plea deal crossed the
financial news ticker, Milken ``lost his train of thought and
concentration and started going, `Uh, uh.''' Boesky became Milken's
chief accuser. Milken has admitted lawbreaking with Boesky.
   But Liman questioned Peizer's version of the events. Peizer said
after the Boesky announcement Milken walked into the office of his
brother, Lowell. Liman said Lowell Milken was out sick that day.
   While searching his desk for documents subpoenaed by the
government, Peizer said Milken ``said something to the effect that
if you don't have them you can't provide them.'' He said Milken
then opened one of his desk drawers, which was empty.
   But under questioning, Peizer said he did not assume Milken was
telling him to discard documents. Peizer said Milken never asked
him to dispose of any records and he never did.
   On Thursday, two government witnesses testified that stock
warrants were offered to induce big investors to buy risky Storer
preferred securities, but neither could link Milken to any bribery
or misappropriation.
   Ammon testified Milken called him late in the Storer deal saying
he needed to halve the purchase price of the warrants to $5 million
to attract more interest in the preferred.
   Ammon said he learned about the Milken-led partnerships almost
two years later, and argued with a Drexel executive about the firm
retaining so much equity. But he said KKR probably would have done
the deal regardless, and he conceded KKR had given Drexel broad
latitude to constuct the terms.
   Peizer said he sold a large block of the preferred issue to
David Solomon of Solomon Asset Management, a longtime Milken
customer, after Milken suggested the equity ``sweetener.'' Peizer
said he learned later that Solomon had sold the preferred stock to
his own clients but kept the warrants for himself.
   It was unclear whether Solomon took the warrants on his own or
via an arrangement with Drexel. Peizer said he did not believe the
equity constituted a bribe.
   Solomon was involved in one of the transactions in Milken's
guilty plea and is cooperating with government prosecutors.
Prosecutors said he will not be called as a witness on Storer.
   Peizer also said Milken ordered him to turn over a blue ledger
book tallying possibly rigged trades between Solomon and Drexel.
Peizer said the ledger was an accounting of how much money Solomon
owed the firm.
   The witness said he handed the book to a Drexel executive,
Lorraine Spurge, in a kitchenette at the junk bond department after
turning on a water faucet in case anyone was listening. Liman said
Spurge has denied Peizer gave her the book.
   ``Everyone was running faucets'' at Drexel after Boesky's plea
deal, Peizer said.
