   President Corazon Aquino on Wednesday
ordered a limited truce with Communist rebels in metropolitan
Manila and areas leveled by a deadly July earthquake.
   Mrs. Aquino said the decision was taken in reaction to
widespread calls for a peace in this violence-wracked island nation.
   ``In response to the peoples' call for a genuine peace, I have
directed the Armed Forces of the Philippines to maintain the
suspension of offensive military operations in the
earthquake-affected areas and the National Capital Region District
Command,'' she said in a statement.
   Justice Secretary Franklin Drilon, a member of the Cabinet
security committee, said the truce would apply in the Manila area
and the provinces of Benguet, Mountain and Nueva Vizcaya, which
were badly damaged by the July 16 quake. The quake killed hundreds
of people.
   The statement avoided the word ``cease-fire.'' Deputy Press
Secretary Horacio Paredes said the military was ``allergic'' to the
word ``cease-fire.''
   Mrs. Aquino gave no timetable for the truce. There was no
immediate reaction from the underground Communist Party of the
Philippines, which has been waging a 21-year insurgency.
   Last week, the rebel National Democratic Front said a cease-fire
would be ineffectual unless the government offered an agenda to
solve the nation's problems, including poverty, ``reppression'' and
the continued presence of U.S. military bases here.
   The military has objected to ``cease-fires'' because it feels
the term gives an unacceptable status to the rebel New People's
Army. The military believes a 60-day nationwide cease-fire declared
in December 1986 enabled the rebels to regroup and retrain.
   Earlier Tuesday, supporters of Ferdinand Marcos marched through
Manila to mark the late president's birthday. President Aquino
again refused to allow Marcos to be buried in the Philippines.
   Marcos' widow, Imelda, appealed to Mrs. Aquino on Monday to
allow her to bring home the remains of her husband from Hawaii.
Marcos died there last Sept. 28.
   ``(The return of Marcos) has to await a more propitious time,''
Mrs. Aquino said in a statement read by Press Secretary Tomas
Gomez. ``Prudence dictates that additional occasions for
debilitating and distracting activities be avoided.''
   Mrs. Aquino has refused to allow the Marcoses to return, citing
security concerns. Marcos was ousted from the presidency in
February 1986 and driven into exile by a civilian-backed military
uprising.
   After a Roman Catholic Mass for Marcos, House of Representatives
minority leader Rodolfo Albano read a statement praising the former
Philippine leader. Albano said Marcos was a ``good man judged at a
wrong time by the wrong minds,'' apparently referring to Mrs.
Aquino's government.
   ``Everyone has human faults, for who has none?'' the statement
said. ``It is said that when a man is gone, only his misdeeds are
often remembered, no matter how few, forgetting all his good
deeds.''
   The statement also appeared as a full-page advertisement in
several Manila newspapers.
   Among those who attended the Mass were some former members of
Marcos' Cabinet, several congressmen and retired generals.
   About 1,000 people marched through Manila to mark Marcos' 73rd
birthday Tuesday.
   Mrs. Aquino said she would make no deals with Mrs. Marcos
regarding the ex-president's burial until the former first lady
returns money allegedly taken from the Philippines. The Aquino
government has accused the Marcoses of plundering up to $10 billion
during 20 years in power.

   President Bush won resounding bipartisan
praise Tuesday for a speech explaning his Persian Gulf policy as a
leading Democrat warned Iraq's leader that if he starts a war, ``we
will finish it.''
   But Democrats showed less enthusiasm for portions of the
president's address to lawmakers that emphasized the inability of
congressional budget negotiators to reach a deal on the deficit.
   Moments after Bush assured Congress that Iraq's aggression
against Kuwait would fail, House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt,
D-Mo., responded in the official Democratic reaction: ``The
president has asked for our support. He has it.''
   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, of Kansas, said, ``If there
are any fence-sitters on the president's decisons in the Middle
East, this speech ought to push them off the fence.''
   Dole said Bush reminded lawmakers that Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein ``has sounded the wake-up call on the defense front. It's a
little premature to be spending a peace dividend when we're
deploying 140,000 troops on the sands of Saudi Arabia.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a frequent Bush critic, was
just as effusive on the Persian Gulf policy, saying Congress ``has
real respect for what has been achieved by the president in
marshalling the international community.''
   But Kennedy was among Democrats expressing some discord over
Bush's comments that ``Most Americans are sick and tired of endless
battles in the Congress and between the branches over budget
matters.''
   ``The use by the administration of this crisis in order to
enhance the defense budget,'' Kennedy said, ``will not be tolerated
or accepted.''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said, ``Democrats are quite
angry'' about Bush's remarks on the budget, and added, ``If the
president and the Republicans think that because of the Persian
Gulf they are riding high and can get their way on a budget
agreement, that's not going to happen. This speech didn't help on
the budget.''
   Bush was called ``a courageous leader'' by Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., and Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H. said the president gave ``a
very tough, steely speech. He just drew the line. It's important
that the American people continually be reinformed and reinforced
as to what the stakes are here.''
   Rep. Larry Smith, D-Fla., a frequent critic of Republican
policies, backed the president's prediction that Saddam Hussein's
aggression would fail, saying he hopes Saddam ``gets the message
and begins to act on it.''
   But he said Bush could have could have acted more quickly in
trying to get American civilians out of Kuwait and Iraq before they
became hostages.
   That remark did not sit well with House Republican Whip Newt
Gingrich, of Georgia, who countered, ``I don't know of any
practical method by which we could have intervened once the
invasion took place.''
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said
Bush broke little new ground, but ``essentially laid out in one
document a very comprehensive argument for our position in the
Gulf.''
   Gephardt contrasted his party's backing for the administration
with criticism of Germany and Japan for not doing enough to support
Operation Desert Shield.
   While concentrating on the United States' response to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait, Gephardt also stumped for the Democratic
position in crucial budget talks, reminded Americans of Bush's new
willingness to raise taxes, and called for cuts in expensive
defense programs.
   And he indirectly criticized Bush and his predecessor, Ronald
Reagan, for the lack of an energy policy during the past decade.
   Gephardt said the United States was in the Persian Gulf ``not
simply for oil, or to save emirs and kings, but to defend the most
fundamental values of a more stable and decent world.''
   ``Firmly, clearly and unequivocally, wemust say to (Iraqi
President) Saddam Hussein: Let our people go. Let Kuwait go. And if
you start a war, know that we will finish it.''
   Declaring that the nation's vital interests are at stake,
Gephardt said ``We cannot and will not permit the invading forces
of a fanatical regime to control half of all the oil reserves which
are the lifeblood of the world economy.''
   Criticizing German and Japanese contributions so far for
Operation Desert Shield, Gephardt noted that those countries, along
with members of NATO, ``depend far more heavily on Mideast oil than
we do.''
   ``When countries like Egypt can stand beside us, when young
Americans stand on front lines, only miles from the threat of
poison gas, the least the Japanese and Germans can do is support us
_ and not just with words; they must respond to our potential
sacrifice of lives with at least a financial sacrifice of their
own.''
   Referring to closed door budget talks underway at Andrews Air
Force Base, Gephardt said Democrats offered cuts in domestic
programs but ``will never abandon the cause of working families.''
   He contended Bush has given a ``commitment to raise taxes,'' and
said the higher tax burden must be borne by wealthy Americans.
   Without specifically mentioning the Republican administrations
of Bush and Ronald Reagan, Gephardt criticized the nation's
free-market energy policies of the past decade. He said the nation
``must not be permanently faced with a choice between standing up
against aggression or standing still in gas lines.''
   He also pushed hard for proposed Democratic cuts in the defense
budget, saying the planned ``Star Wars'' anti-missile system, the
radar-evading B-2 bomber and the MX missile ``are costly systems
designed for a Cold War that we have already won.''

   It's hard to calculate the total cost to the
nation of the savings and loan disaster or to imagine just how much
money $500 billion, the government's latest estimate, really is.
This, the final part of a three-part series, ``S&amp;Ls on Main
Street,'' examines the implications of the debacle _ which reach
beyond dollars.

   Donald Janke has worked for 40 years in savings
and loans, taking in government-guaranteed deposits and lending
them to homeowners as mortgages.
   His Marquette Savings and Loan and the Midwest as a region still
make a profit with these non-glamorous transactions. Wisconsin's
S&amp;L trade group even ran a series of ads last year saying ``We Dare
To Be Dull.''
   But although Janke and others in America's heartland had nothing
to do with the freewheeling deals and bungling behind the S&amp;L
fiasco, they're still liable for the bailout.
   ``The guys who made prudent investments and are running an
honest shop are paying for the sins of the guys who ran off with
the loot. It just isn't fair,'' said James Grohl, senior vice
president of the 2,400-member U.S. League of Savings Institutions.
   Janke said S&amp;L failures elsewhere cost him an extra $80,000 a
year in operating costs: higher insurance premiums, triple the cost
of federal oversight, cuts in stock dividends.
   And he's also lost face.
   ``I really don't like to tell people what I do anymore,'' he
said. ``I tell them I'm a banker.''
   There are millions of people like Janke _ people who do not work
for a troubled savings and loan, and do not have accounts or loans
with one; people who do not live in towns where real estate values
have plunged because of S&amp;L problems; people whose businesses have
been unmolested by the crisis.
   But every single one of them will suffer because of what what
U.S. Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa and a member of the House Banking
Committee, calls a ``fiscal Vietnam'' and ``the biggest public
gaffe of the century in terms of finance.''
   Leach figures the S&amp;L bailout will cost the average American
family $20 a month for the next 30 years.
   It would cost anywhere from $147 billion to $203 billion to set
everything right if a check were written today, according to
various estimates.
   The latest government estimate is $160 billion, plus another
$340 billion in interest to pay it off over 30 years, for a total
of $500 billion.
   ``People have a hard time comprehending greed at so large a
scale,'' Leach said.
   So what do these monumental numbers really mean?
   The $500 billion tab is enough to give $2,000 to every man,
woman and child in the United States _ or $100 to every human on
the planet.
   With just the $160 billion, Uncle Sam could pay for the next 53
years' worth of the government's AIDS research, education and care.
He also could just about wipe out the federal budget deficit,
estimated at $169 billion for 1991.
   But let's make this easier and focus on a trifling $1 billion.
   Even Donald Trump could appreciate $1 billion, which was the
cost of his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. A mere $1 billion
would cover the $450,000 monthly allowance outlined by his
creditor-bankers for the next 185 years. And if the courts approve
the $25 million divorce settlement with his wife, Ivana, Trump
could afford 40 failed marriages.
   He also could buy a $40,000 Cadillac every day for the next 72
years.
   Of course, $1 billion is pennies compared to what some
economists say the tab ultimately could balloon to: $1 trillion.
   ``Only one segment has deep enough pockets to make good on the
money _ that's the U.S. taxpayer,'' said James Barth, former chief
economist for the Office of Thrift Supervision and now a finance
professor at Auburn University.
   ``The money spent on the S&amp;L bailout is money that could have
been spent on education, travel, home, food. It just means people
will have less money,'' Barth said. ``It's a redistribution of a
good part of their income in ways they wouldn't ordinarily want
to.''
   Some economists don't believe a tax increase will be needed
because the government will cover the damage over time. But that
doesn't mean the crisis will have no trickle-down impact.
   ``In the long run, you might see slightly higher interest
rates,'' said Robert Litan, a senior fellow with the Brookings
Institution.
   The bailout's price tag has prompted the rumblings of a regional
war roughly between the Rust Belt and the Sun Belt. Not only will
taxpayers have to bail out the S&amp;L bunglers, but the Northeast and
Midwest will have to bail out the South and West.
   Edward Hill, a professor at Cleveland State University,
calculated that 37 states and the District of Columbia will be net
losers because they'll have to ship money to 13 states who come out
ahead.
   ``The bailout will result in a massive geographic transfer of
wealth to the Southwest, as well as a transfer of wealth from
taxpayers to savers,'' Hill said.
   Assuming a bailout cost of $203 million, Hill figured that
residents of Connecticut will be hardest hit, each paying out
$1,237 more in taxes than they receive in money from the bailout.
   Texas residents will benefit by $4,775 per person. Other big
winners are New Mexico, $4,349; Arkansas, $4,106; and Arizona,
$2,143.
   A bill sponsored by the 18-state Northeast-Midwest Congressional
Coalition would shift a greater share of the bailout to the South
and West _ particularly Texas.
   ``This bill is saying that any state which helped create the
10-gallon hatful of trouble for the rest of the country must be
held accountable,'' said U.S. Rep. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine.
   In Wisconsin, where only two of 66 S&amp;Ls have failed, the bailout
will cost $592 for every man, woman and child, according to Hill's
study.
   The inequity isn't lost on conservative Midwesterners like
Joseph Sulewski of the Milwaukee suburb of Shorewood, a 49-year-old
Wisconsin Gas Co. worker who can add the S&amp;L bailout to his
mortgage, car loan, utilities and other monthly bills.
   ``Isn't what happened like embezzling, but doing it legally?
It's a crying shame,'' Sulewski said. ``Everybody's going to pay
for it for years and years. Everybody's going to be hurting for
that.''

   The Royal Opera has opened its new season with a
revival of its celebrated production of ``Turandot'' and unanswered
questions about the company's financial future.
   The opera house in Covent Garden is spending its way toward a
$9.45 million deficit. Seat prices are the highest in its history
and extra money from sponsors and the government is looking harder
than ever to come by.
   There was 10 minutes' applause for the cast headed by Dame
Gwyneth Jones, the Welsh soprano and a Covent Garden favorite
Monday night in her 49th performance of the title role, and Russian
tenor Vladimir Popov, now a U.S. citizen, as Prince Calaf.
   They were joined by conductor Sir Colin Davis, who was presented
with the Royal Opera House silver medal to mark his 25th
anniversary with Covent Garden.
   ``Few have done more for opera, for this country and this
house,'' said general director Jeremy Isaacs from the stage.
   The company premiered this production of Giacomo Puccini's last
opera in Los Angeles in 1984 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and
claims that it revived interest in opera in that city.
   The revival was dedicated to Dame Eva Turner, the British
dramatic soprano, who died on June 16 at age 98. Turandot was her
finest role between 1928 and 1947. For 10 years after her
retirement she was a professor of voice at the University of
Oklahoma.
   The Royal Opera is staging nine new productions this season,
starting with ``Siegfried'' on Oct. 4, as well as revivals. The
house is open six days a week with opera and ballet and claims to
be the busiest in Europe.
   The best stalls seats on Monday were $168. Best grand tier seats
were $190. The cheapest seats, which have a restricted view, range
from $8.50 to $38.
   Rodney Milnes, editor of Opera magazine, other critics note that
although it's the well-heeled who are mostly seen at Covent Garden,
the opera house is the recipient of the largest slug of public
money for the performing arts in Britain _ $28.3 million this year.
   Taxpayers, especially those outside southeast England which
contributes 84 percent of the opera house audiences, ``are hardly
getting a good return for the money taken from them,'' Milnes
complained in London's Evening Standard.
   ``We are pleased to get the show on the road again,'' said Ewen
Balfour, director of public relations at the opera house, after
Monday's opening.
   ``We are as concerned about the high prices as everyone else _
some seats are double those at the Bastille (the new opera house in
Paris). But our income still isn't enough,'' he said.
   He said salaries account for 60 percent of the budget and
increased by 8 to 9 percent last year, when the opera house's
increase from the government was 1.7 percent.
   ``Our turnover last season was 39 million pounds ($73.7
million). Attendances averaged 92 percent for opera and 91 percent
for ballet and yet we face a deficit. We are now waiting to see
what the government will give us in November,'' Balfour said.
   He said the venerable opera house, opened in 1858, is busier
than ever and has had to take on extra staff to operate an
all-night stage crew.
   ``It's a chicken and egg situation: if you want to do exciting
things you have to charge high prices; if you charge high prices
you have to give the public something very good. It's distressing
for us that the middle income group, especially school teachers,
can no longer afford to come and that they aren't introducing
people to the delights of coming here,'' he said.

   A bronze sculpture at the base of a
neon-outlined 16-story office tower here honors real estate
developer Conley Wolfswinkel's parents, ``without whose love and
guidance this building never would have been possible.''
   Not exactly. Western Savings &amp; Loan Association, and ultimately
the U.S. taxpayer, helped, too.
   The now-defunct S&amp;L paid Wolfswinkel $52.5 million _ the amount
of his loan _ for the tower three years ago. Government regulators
sold the building this summer for $20.3 million.
   Loss to taxpayers: more than $32 million, just on that building.
   Such dealings, multipled over and over again across the country,
illustrate where the money went in the S&amp;L fiasco.
   First Texas Savings and Loan loaned $325 million to build
Stonebridge Ranch, a planned community north of Dallas. First Texas
failed, and regulators this year could muster only $61 million for
Stonebridge from a Japanese investor, leaving taxpayers on the hook
for $264 million.
   Tales of fraud, high-living and rip-offs dominate the coverage
of the S&amp;L crisis, but analysts and regulators say only a fraction
of the money lost _ estimated to run as high as $500 billion _ was
stolen outright. Most of it was gambled away on risky real estate
deals.
   ``It was like staking poker players (to) piles of chips while
allowing them to keep any winnings, even as the government agreed
to pay all the losses,'' said Sherman Maisel, former Federal
Reserve Board governor.
   Fraud accounted for about 3 percent of the total being absorbed
by taxpayers, according to consultant Bert Ely. The bulk of the
losses come from devalued real estate and excessive interest rates
paid by sick S&amp;Ls to attract depositors.
   ``The crook-bashing is troubling. They make convenient
scapegoats to avoid focusing attention on the failed government
policies that caused this,'' Ely said.
   ``We've wasted the economic resources of the 1980s on unneeded
investments,'' he said. ``We're already had the binge. Now we've
got the hangover for it.''
   Ely estimates the loss today at $147 billion. He figures $28
billion went down the drain in property that is worth less now than
when it was financed or bought by a thrift.
   The rest was lost in a variety of ways:
   _ Excess interest paid to attract deposits, or just to keep pace
with the high-flying thrifts that offered above-market rates to
provide more cash to gamble.
   _ Excess operating costs _ exorbitant salaries, unneeded branch
offices, lavish decorations, jets, yachts and fancy parties, Ely
said.
   _ Fixed-rate mortgages made before 1983 and squeezed by higher
interest rates.
   _ Interest paid to keep ailing thrifts alive instead of closing
them and paying off depositors immediately.
   ``It's a massive government failure,'' said Robert Litan, a
senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ``Most of the money was
lost in wild gambles. The government let them do it. There was no
supervision.''
   Some profited through the whole episode. People who originally
sold land made a bundle. Money was paid to contractors, developers,
suppliers and construction workers in a building boom that went
bust when regional economies nosedived.
   But fraud has generated the biggest headlines, even though the
U.S. Justice Department estimates criminal acts in about 30 percent
of the failed S&amp;Ls.
   ``You've got a lot of creeps in there, but criminal fraud didn't
create the problem,'' said Doug Tillet, spokesman for the Justice
Department. ``We see an awful lot of stupidity and bad judgment.
That's not prosecutable.''

   Virginia Zimmer watches for death.
   It's grim work, but she can't let death have the final say.
   At St. Alphonsus Regional Medical Center, Zimmer matches organ
donors with people from all over the country who also watch for
death.
   There are miracles, and she somehow finds ways to turn grief and
tragedy into joy.
   ``I tell people it's the gift of life _ it's the finest gift we
can give,'' she says.
   For the thousands of seriously ill with diseased hearts, kidneys
and livers, the choice is simple _ a transplant or death. They wait
anxiously for the call that another person has died so they might
live.
   The donors share a profile. They die quickly, violently. It may
be a traffic accident, a blood vessel exploding in the brain, a
suicide. In any event, the brain is destroyed while the organs
still function.
   Almost always, they're young.
   ``They're 16- to 20-year-olds. . . . That's why it's difficult.
They're the hope of the family. They die, and it's tough,'' says
Zimmer, 55.
   The awful moment comes when the family is told their loved one
is dead. Machines can maintain the organs in a brain-dead person
for a couple of days at most. Zimmer must work quickly,
compassionately.
   Gently, she tells the family of the donor program. She answers
questions. The grieving struggle to understand.
   ``Eighty percent say yes,'' she says. ``I've never had anybody
get angry with a request to donate. They can only say no.''
   In 1986, Zimmer volunteered to coordinate organ donation at St.
Alphonsus on top of her regular duties as a nurse educator. Her 24
years as an intensive-care nurse were ideal training.
   The volunteer work grew into the full-time position she assumed
in August working with all the hospitals in southwestern Idaho. A
top priority for Zimmer is to educate the public about the donor
program.
   Her first year, she managed 13 donor cases. There were 14 the
following year. Then eight. And only four donors so far this year.
   In any given year, only 8,500 to 12,000 people can be considered
to be donors, says Wanda Bond, a spokeswoman for the United Network
for Organ Sharing in Richmond, Va.
   ``It may be that hospitals already burdened with bureaucracy and
red tape see the donor program as just one more thing to do,'' Bond
says. She also thinks stricter drunken driving laws, higher seat
belt use and motorcycle helmet laws all may affect the number of
available donors.
   Nationally, donors of solid organs such as the heart, lungs,
liver, kidneys and pancreas fell from 3,975 two years ago to 3,898
in 1989. Yet the number of transplants rose more than 5 percent to
13,384, through multiple use of donor organs.
   Zimmer says up to a half-dozen recipients may benefit from the
organs of one donor. A donor also can provide eyes for cornea
transplants, bone to graft onto shattered limbs and skin to protect
burn patients.
   ``When they can donate, it helps the donor family almost as much
as the recipient family,'' Zimmer says.
   After a patient has died and permission is obtained from
relatives to donate organs or tissue, an intricate choreography
involving scores of people is performed. Most of the work must be
done within 12 to 18 hours.
   ``We treat (the donor) respectfully,'' says Merry Reed, an
intensive-care nurse at St. Alphonsus. ``But we can't treat them as
though they're going to get well. Now you're working to save
another life _ or three or four lives _ with the organs.''
   If the heart or other organs have been donated, Zimmer is on the
phone with the national organ-sharing network for its lists of the
people needing organ transplants.
   The lists are brutally efficient. Only the most feeble rise to
the top. The likelihood of survival through an organ transplant
increases only as a person's medical condition deteriorates.
   Lab work is done to check for hepatitis and AIDS. Blood pressure
is stabilized. The chest is measured. The kidneys are kept working.
Organ recovery teams fly in from Salt Lake City or Portland, Ore.
   A heart must be transplanted within four hours after being
removed from a donor. Lungs, two hours. A liver, 24 hours. Kidneys,
72 hours.
   More than 17,000 people in the United States are waiting for
kidney transplants. Nearly 1,000 need liver transplants. An
additional 1,700 need hearts.
   Nine months ago, Virginia Zimmer's own son, Joe, died in a car
wreck. He was 28 and strong, a former Marine. The nurses at St.
Alphonsus, out of respect for their co-worker's feelings, didn't
ask her the obvious question.
   Zimmer, in her grief, didn't remember until it was too late.
   ``I could have donated his eyes,'' she says.
   She pauses.
   ``The ones who feel badly are the ones who weren't asked.''

<HEAD>`Executioner' Goes to Work on Brazil Bureaucracy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many government employees refer to Joao
Santana as The Executioner because he makes heads roll. Others call
him Judas or Satan.
   Santana's official title is secretary of public administration.
His daunting task is to clean up Brazil's bloated and corrupt
government bureaucracy.
   It is no surprise that, in a nation where one in six citizens
works for some level of government, he has many enemies.
   In four months, Santana ordered 200,000 civil servants fired,
retired or ``sent home'' with pay but no extras in hopes they would
resign, according to government figures. That is half the target
President Fernando Collor de Mello, who took office March 15,
announced for his entire five-year term.
   Santana also oversaw the auction of 20 government-owned
mansions, formerly used rent-free by top bureaucrats, and ordered
the sale of 19,700 apartments, 4,800 vehicles and five airplanes.
   When he took office, Collor said, the bureaucracy was consuming
95 percent of tax revenues and causing a $31 billion deficit, which
was considered the main reason inflation had reached 5,000 percent
a year.
   He ordered a 25 percent reduction in the government's 1.6
million employees as part of his anti-inflation plan and chose
Santana, 32, to do the job.
   After Santana went to work, the Government Employees Union of
Brasilia held a ``symbolic funeral'' for The Executioner and he
even received physical threats.
   Santana said he feels most Brazilians support him.
   ``I don't consider myself a satan and the administrative reform
is not the work of the devil,'' he said in an interview. ``On the
contrary, the reform will exorcize the state's infernal inability
to attend taxpayers who deserve good services.''
   The reforms, including wiping out 12 Cabinet ministries and
closing dozens of state companies and agencies, cut expenses in
June to just 50 percent of tax revenues, he said.
   Politicians now seek his endorsement and people stop him in the
street to urge greater reductions, he said.
   ``A month ago, few congressmen wanted to have their picture
taken next to me,'' Santana told the interviewer. ``Now, many do. I
even taped political TV spots where I say, `I'm with this candidate
because he's just like me'.''
   Santana entered politics as a leftist opponent of the military
regimes that governed Brazil for 21 years until 1985. In 1979, he
helped found the Marxist-oriented Workers Party that now is the
Collor government's main opposition.
   He later abandoned leftist politics, graduated from the Sao
Paulo Univeristy Law School and worked in the Sao Paulo state
government. When Santana's friend Zelia Cardoso de Mello was chosen
as Collor's economy minister, she recommended him to carry out the
bureaucratic reform.
   Brazilian presidents have tried, or promised, to shrink the
bureaucracy for 50 years, without success.
   Jose Sarney, Collor's predecessor, established a Ministry of
Debureaucratization and declared in a speech, ``Spending is
forbidden.'' The bureaucracy got bigger.
   Joao Geraldo Piquet Carneiro, who directed the same task in the
military years, said the problem was not too many government
workers, but poor distribution of them.
   ``The number of civil servants is not disproportional to the
population'' of 150 million, Piquet Carneiro said, but added that
it was easier to fire workers than to reassign them.
   Santana acknowledged the reforms had ``political enemies'' and
had cost the president support in Congress.
   Many dismissed employees have gone to court seeking
reinstatement. The government lost a court case on reducing the pay
of workers ``sent home.''
   Another obstacle is a clause in the 1988 constitution that says
government workers with five years of seniority cannot be fired.
   According to Santana, the main resistance is in Brasilia, the
capital, which has 70,000 civil servants, and Rio, a former capital
that still has 160,000 government functionaries.
   A survey of 590 government workers in Brasilia revealed, to the
surprise of many people, that 58 percent felt the layoffs were
necessary.
   ``I sleep soundly,'' Santana said. ``When I finish the reform we
will have fewer public functionaries and more well-paid
professionals.''

   It's so damp and musty in Jim Lewis'
leaky office at NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center that tiny
mushrooms sometimes sprout on his moss-flecked window sill.
   Down the hall, Mary Spaulding leaves a garbage can near her door
to catch drips from the ceiling that periodically flood the floor.
   The sprawling, concrete block structure, which houses the
electronic systems laboratory, is the most dilapidated building at
Mashall. Marshall is NASA's most dilapidated major field center.
The oldest section was built by the Army in 1957 as part of
Redstone Arsenal.
   ``What we hope is we don't have Legionnaires' disease up
there,'' Lewis said, pointing to moldy ceiling tiles above his
leaking, tar-splotched window.
   NASA's buildings are crumbling, much as its image has this
summer.
   A shuttle has not flown in more than four months because of
hydrogen leaks that have crippled two of the fleet's three
spaceships. NASA thought it had fixed all of Columbia's leaks, but
hydrogen flooded the rear compartment last week during fueling for
a third launch attempt and the countdown abruptly was halted.
   Workers at Cape Canaveral on Monday installed new fuel pumps in
an attempt to eliminate the latest leaks and clear the way for a
fourth launch attempt early next week. The astronomy mission has
been on hold since May.
   In addition to leaky shuttles, NASA has spent the summer
contending with mirror flaws in the Hubble Space Telescope that
prevent a sharp focus, communications problems with the Magellan
spacecraft orbiting Venus, and growing criticism over the proposed
space station Freedom.
   Still, it is the day-to-day working conditions that are the
immediate worry of NASA employees nationwide. The problem is aging
buildings and not enough money to maintain them, according to the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``Almost all of NASA's facilities were built in the mid-1960s,''
said Ted Ankrum, who oversees the agency's construction and
maintenance projects. ``It's all coming up on 30 years, and 30
years is about the lifetime for roofs. It's the lifetime for
heating and air conditioning systems. It's the lifetime for paving
and runways.
   ``It's the lifetime for very many things, so that what we've got
are a lot of building shells and a lot of things inside that need
to be replaced.''
   The to-be-fixed list is a handyman's nightmare.
   Leaky roofs abound, including the one on the 525-feet-tall
Vehicle Assembly Building at Florida's Kennedy Space Center, the
second largest building in the world in terms of volume. Rain, on
occasion, has splashed down on computers in the adjoining launch
control center.
   Ventilation systems and heating boilers are so old that parts
are no longer available and NASA must make its own components.
Obsolete circuit breakers at Kennedy and Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, Calif., pose so much danger that power must be
turned off before workers can test them.
   While less menacing, old electric switchboards at Langley
Research Center in Hampton, Va., ``look like they came from `The
Bride of Frankenstein' movie,'' Ankrum said. Langley, NASA's oldest
field center, was established in 1917 as the first national
aeronautic laboratory.
   NASA's northernmost center, Lewis Research Center in Cleveland,
has the worst roads in the agency _ they're cracked and potholed.
Inside the older buildings, asbestos fills ceilings, walls and
steam piping; it is a problem at other centers, too.
   The decay prompted NASA this year to conduct its first
agency-wide study of field center maintenance. A rating system was
needed to help NASA appropriate repair funds to the places most in
need, Ankrum said.
   Of the 14 sites included in the three-month survey, the worst
was Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, a subsidiary of
Marshall. Marshall was next, with more maintenance problems than
any of the seven other major field centers.
   Several of the smaller field installations, which like Michoud
report to field centers, were excluded from the study because of
financial constraints, Ankrum said.
   NASA officials insist none of the maintenance problems
jeopardize workers' safety. Every so often, though, shuttle
operations fall victim to building disrepair.
   Last April, a corroded pipe sprayed water on electrical
equipment at Kennedy. The accident interrupted final prelaunch
testing of the Hubble telescope inside the shuttle Discovery.
   In August, following Atlantis' move from the launch pad back to
the Vehicle Assembly Building, work on the leaky shuttle was halted
half a day when water dripped from a sprinkler onto power
transformers. A worn valve was to blame.
   NASA officials say they are doing what they can.
   New buildings are going up at just about every center, or are
about to. Restorations are planned, including a $13.5 million
modernization of the building in which Lewis, Spaulding and about
500 others work.
   ``Had it been maintained properly, it might not cost so much to
modernize,'' said Edwin Jones, chief of project management at
Marshall.
   ``It's like the old Fram Filter commercial,'' Ankrum said. ``You
change the oil now or you overhaul the engine later.''
   NASA is seeking $186 million for maintenance for fiscal 1991,
which begins Oct. 1. Congress appropriated $141 million for the
current fiscal year. About $400 million will be needed annually for
maintenance during the next few years, Ankrum said.
   The agency also is requesting $175 million for restoration and
modernization for fiscal 1991, up from the current $158 million.
   ``I think we've gotten our message across,'' said NASA
Administrator Richard Truly. ``And that is that these hard-to-sell
items like preventive maintenance _ you know, it doesn't go
anywhere, it doesn't take any pictures, it's not very sexy if you
will _ are very, very important.''

   This year, NASA conducted its first agency-wide study of
maintenance so it could better distribute building repair funds to
the eight major field centers and their subsidiaries.
   NASA teams visited 14 sites. All but the smallest installations
were included in the three-month survey, which was completed in
June.
   The results are as follows, with the first being the center with
the most maintenance problems. Included with each listing are the
center's location, average building age and function.
   1. Michoud Assembly Facility, New Orleans. Average building age
is 34.6 years. This subsidiary to Marshall Space Flight Center
builds external tanks for the space shuttle.
   2. Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala., 32.5 years.
Provides the shuttle engines, external tanks and solid rocket
boosters, and manages Spacelab missions and development of space
station habitation modules.
   3. Plum Brook Station, Sandusky, Ohio, 33.4 years. This
subsidiary to Lewis Research Center is for the most part inactive,
but hypersonic aeronautical research facilities are being
reactivated.
   4. Tie between Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, 39.3 years, and
Stennis Space Center, Bay St. Louis, Miss., 24.2 years. Lewis is
the lead center for aeronautic propulsion research and technology,
and is developing space station power systems. Stennis tests the
shuttle's large propulsion systems.
   5. Tie between Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., 26.1
years, and Wallops Flight Facility, Wallops Island, Va., 37.7
years. Goddard manages Earth-related space science projects and
controls Hubble Space Telescope. Wallops, a subsidiary of Goddard,
directs sounding rocket program for Earth observations.
   6. Ames Research Center, Mountain View, Calif., 35.3 years.
Conducts aeronautic and scientific research involving new
technology.
   7. Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral, Fla., 23.6 years.
Directs shuttle launch operations.
   8. Langley Research Center, Hampton, Va., 38.1 years. Conducts
research in aeronautics and space technology. It is NASA's oldest
field center, having been established in 1917 as the first national
aeronautical laboratory.
   9. Johnson Space Center, Houston, 25.4 years. Oversees astronaut
selection and training, serves as Mission Control base and is
program manager for the shuttle and space station truss system.
   10. Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., average
building age unavailable. Manages deep space, planetary missions
such as Magellan and Galileo. This government-owned center is
operated by the California Institute of Technology.
   11. Ames-Dryden Flight Research Facility, Edwards Air Force
Base, Calif., 27.2 years. This subsidiary of Ames Research Center
conducts flight testing and serves as the primary shuttle landing
site.
   12. Slidell Computer Complex, Slidell, La., 26.6 years. This
subsidiary of Marshall provides computer services support to
Michoud and Stennis.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pollsters asked New Yorkers if they agreed with
this statement: ``To live in New York, people need to be a little
crazy.'' More than half gave the only sane response _ yes.
   In the poll commissioned by Time magazine, 52 percent adjusted
their straitjackets and agreed that life here is indeed easier for
the slightly daft.
   There is no evidence that most residents of Phoenix or Atlanta
have ever claimed that insanity enhances life in their communities.
Do New Yorkers really see themselves as teeth-grinding,
neck-bulging, fist-pounding loonies? Is the nation's largest city
also its craziest?
   Dr. Elliot Wineburg, a professor of clinical psychology at Mount
Sinai Hospital and an expert on urban stress, was not convinced.
   ``People like to go along with legends. They're admitting to a
proud sort of craziness,'' he said. ``It's a kind of boot camp
attitude toward life in the city.''
   Wineburg said many New Yorkers lay claim not to psychosis, but
to the fanatic's mania: for opera, stocks, sculpture or basketball,
all of which the city has in unrivaled abundance.
   But he conceded that the city probably has a disproportionate
number of stress-related conditions such as headaches, high blood
pressure, irritable bowels and ringing ears. Also, an awful lot of
people seem to talk to themselves while walking down Fifth Avenue.
   This all may be linked to population density. The country as a
whole has about 63 people per square mile; San Francisco, the
second densest city, has 14,000 per mile.
   New York City, on the other hand, has 23,000 residents per
square mile, not including commuters, and Manhattan a whopping
58,000. Overall, New York is more than twice as dense as all but a
few American cities.
   Unlike the rats in laboratory experiments, who occupy an airy,
well-lit cage, New Yorkers are packed into an environment of
bursting water pipes, runaway cabs, late subway trains, crumbling
bridges and narrow sidewalks.
   And they are in far more danger than most Americans. Forget the
comparisons to contemporary Detroit or turn of the century Dodge
City; there is no spot on the planet where more middle class people
run a higher risk of being robbed at gunpoint.
   Fordham University sociologist Marc Miringoff has compiled an
``Index of Social Health'' for the city based on factors such as
crime, drug and child abuse, unemployment and school attendance.
Since 1974 the index has declined from 75 on a scale of 100 to 44.
   ``You can see this pathology in the street, and it affects
you,'' he said. ``It makes you feel as if you want to run.''
   ``A big problem is that many people feel they can't control this
environment,'' Wineburg said. ``When you commute over a bridge
every day and you find out it's going to be under construction for
two years, that's very upsetting.''
   ``When your car is stolen and it turns out a traffic officer did
it, that's very upsetting.''
   Although the stress of the city may not cause mental illness,
Wineburg said, ``It can be the straw that breaks the camel's back.''
   His advice to the stressed: Leave early if you're always late;
find someone with whom to share your urban horror stories; learn
not to internalize tension; reward yourself at the end of the day
or week; see a doctor.
   No problem there, except during August, when most doctors go on
vacation. Although the city has only 41 percent of the state's 17.5
million residents, it has 80 percent of its 2,500 psychiatrists.
There also are droves of psychologists, especially in Manhattan,
which has 2,194 of the city's 3,153.
   Many of these people will tell you New Yorkers aren't crazy,
just different. Humorist Calvin Trillin, a 30-year resident, says
that if a 300-pound man costumed as Eleanor of Aquitaine walked
onto a crosstown bus carrying both an attache case and a rib roast,
the other passengers might glance up for a second.
   Then, he says, ``They'd go back to their tabloids.''

<HEAD>Jaffna's Residents: Trapped Between Rebels and Air Force Bombings</HEAD>

   EDITORS: A Sri Lankan journalist recently slipped into the
Jaffna Peninsula, virtually cut off from the world since the
government's latest offensive against Tamil rebels began Aug. 22.
He wishes to remain anonymous for reasons of personal security.
This is his report.
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>JAFFNA, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As the shadows of two helicopter
gunships loomed over the city, people ran for cover shouting
``Heli! Heli!'' to warn their neighbors.
   Minutes later, high-caliber machine guns opened up a deadly
chatter of fire from the sky. Bullets thudded into walls, shattered
the few remaining glass panes and ricocheted off tile roofs.
   Then came the bombers. Ten planes dropped bombs over densely
populated Jaffna, powdering the debris of already devastated houses.
   Despite the intensity of the Sri Lankan air force attack on the
town held by Tamil rebels, there were few casualties.
   ``We are like rats,'' said Sathasivan Krishnamurthy, a
60-year-old newspaper vendor. ``They can't kill us because we go
into the ground.''
   His house has a trench dug into its floor but no roof.
Krishnamurthy's wife and daughters cook and wash dishes in the
trench, apparently unconcerned, during the bombing runs.
   In the three months since the rebels resumed their war against
the government, Jaffna, a town of 60,000 people, has come under
almost daily bombardment.
   Its main market, on an open square in the center of town, is a
heap of rubble. So is the bus terminal. The railroad station is a
mass of twisted railway lines and concrete. The coaches of what was
once a passenger train lie on their side, pockmarked with bullet
holes.
   The 1,200-bed Jaffna Hospital is empty, shot full of bullets.
Stray cattle graze on the unkempt lawn. Mongrels lie in the
corridors.
   The Tamil Tiger guerrillas who hold the town claim the
government has killed at least 4,000 civilians in the Jaffna
Peninsula and other districts of northeastern Sri Lanka since the
fighting resumed June 11. Military officials say there have been
civilian casualties but refuse to give a number. No one is sure of
the real toll.
   Ponniah Balasingham, a member of Jaffna's municipal corporation,
estimates damage to his town at $3.9 million. ``I don't know how we
can get people to pick up their lives again,'' he said. ``The
situation is hopeless.''
   Perhaps for the first time in the 7-year-old war for an
independent Tamil homeland, public opinion is turning against the
rebels who patrol the streets with automatic rifles.
   Residents don't talk easily to strangers, but when they do, many
express resentment. Some don't like being ordered around by the
teen-age cadres. Others fear extortion.
   Yogaratnam Yogi, one of the senior leaders of the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, says taxes are levied on those who wish to
leave the city for safer areas and those who have relatives working
abroad.
   ``We want each family to give us two gold sovereigns (about
$250) if they decide to abandon Jaffna,'' the bespectacled Yogi
said. ``It is part of the war effort. We also take this from people
who have relatives working abroad.''
   Residents said that amount, usually in the form of jewelry, has
been collected from every family, regardless of whether they want
to leave or receive money from abroad. The Tigers issue receipts,
which allow residents to obtain passes for moving around the city,
the residents said.
   People who don't have passes are often shot, they said.
   Besides the attacks, lives are imperiled by a drastic shortage
of food. Yogi claimed many people in Jaffna have starved to death,
but said he did not have figures. A municipal official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, also said there had been some starvation
deaths, but he, too, had no figures.
   Yogi said at least 150 to 200 Tigers had died in the fighting,
including at least 100 in the bid to capture Jaffna Fort, the only
government garrison in town.
   The government says about 1,000 rebels have been killed.
   More than 200 policemen and soldiers are stranded in the
star-shaped 17th century garrison, subsisting on occasional
airdrops of food. Around the fort is a no man's land. The air force
has leveled the buildings facing the fort to deprive the rebels of
cover for an advance.
   Two hundred yards away, the Tiger fighters are dug into a maze
of underground bunkers. By the government's count, Tiger snipers
have picked off 13 of the fort's defenders, who numbered 250 before
the siege.
   Before June 11, the Tamil war had killed at least 11,000 people.
Jaffna, the largest town on the northern peninsula of the same
name, is part of the region the Tamils claim as their homeland.
   It has always been at the forefront of the fighting between Sri
Lanka's Tamil minority and the Sinhalese who control the government
and army. The Tamils allege discrimination by the Sinhalese, who
comprise 75 percent of the population.
   From 1983, when the insurgency began, until 1987, the peninsula
was under attack and a blockade similar to the one now in
operation. In 1987, Indian peacekeeping troops landed in Jaffna
after a peace accord between the rebels and the government.
   The peace plan failed and the rebels turned their guns on the
Indians. Jaffna came under the command of the Indian soldiers, but
the rebel presence remained powerful.
   The Indians left the Indian Ocean island this spring after 2{
years of unsuccesful attempts to quell the Tigers. A brief peace
ended June when the militants reneged on a cease-fire with the
government.
   Attackers have found the city difficult to enter by ground. A
single causeway links Jaffna Peninsula to the rest of the island
nation, and it has been mined by the rebels. The coast offers
little facility for landing and is also well-guarded.
   What's left is aerial bombardment, which doesn't seem to daunt
the rebels but has destroyed any semblance of normal life for
civilians.
   Scouring shops for food, going for a haircut or to meet friends
or even moving from one room to another are abruptly cut short by
the call: ``Heli, heli.''
   Then it's a dive for the nearest trench as the helicopter
gunships swoop down again.

<TEXT>
   In this city of contrasts, fear is the
common denominator. It's the tie that binds rich and poor, the
powerful to the powerless, the denizens of ramshackle box-like
houses with the elite in the corridors of the presidential palace.
   ``You don't understand fear,'' said one Iraqi, who nervously
cast sidelong glances while speaking to a Western reporter on a
Baghdad street. ``Here we live with fear every day.''
   Executions are common in Iraq for a variety of offenses, Western
diplomats said. A joke about President Saddam Hussein can earn a
careless comic years in prison. Some people simply disappear.
   ``There are an awful lot of executions here,'' said one European
diplomat. ``Mondays and Thursdays are the hanging days in the
prisons.''
   The climate of fear is so pervasive that Iraqis tell Western
reporters they are not particularly frightened of war with the
United States. After eight years of fighting Iran, they're
accustomed to war.
   But they are afraid of the U.N. sanctions, afraid their children
might go hungry and afraid to complain or openly question the
government or its policies.
   Some Western journalists were encouraged by Information Minister
Latif Nasaif Jasim to talk to Iraqis. The journalists were then
detained for hours for doing just that. A diplomat later cautioned
reporters about interviewing Iraqis on the street.
   Iraq, explained one diplomat, has a state security apparatus
that employs about 100,000 people. There are informers everywhere.
   But despite the elaborate internal security system, there are
signs that Iraq's climate of fear extends as far as the
presidential palace.
   ``After what happened in Bulgaria and Romania, Saddam hired
three foreign security agencies for his own security,'' said one
diplomat, referring to the collapse of the Stalinist dictatorships
in Eastern Europe.
   The agencies revamped the president's personal security
operation, training Iraqi bodyguards to be ``better, sharper,'' the
diplomat said.
   ``He's scared, scared of assassination,'' said a European
diplomat of Saddam. ``He hasn't been with the people in ages.''
   However, foreign diplomats with long experience in Iraq insist
that Western hopes that Saddam will be toppled in a popular revolt
are just wishful thinking.
   ``Iraqis may go through moments of despair, but don't think they
will overthrow the government,'' said one senior Western diplomat.
``There simply isn't a parliamentary democracy ready to emerge.''
   Saddam has ruthlessly stamped out any opposition, said the
diplomats. Scores of army officers were reportedly executed for
opposing Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   ``There's no opposition here that I know of. You can be assured
that Saddam would hear of it before I would, and then you can be
assured there would be no opposition by the time I heard about
it,'' said one diplomat.
   ``If I could think of them, they' be dead,'' agreed a European
diplomat.
   Any attempt to kill Saddam would have to come from foreign
assassins or from his tight circle of close associates, the
diplomats said. And they contend that Saddam is keenly alert.
   ``While you were playing ball in your backyard, he was
organizing coup d'etats. He has spent his whole life taking part in
such things,'' a Western diplomat said. ``Whatever else he is, we
have to accept that he's a very clever man.''
   To protect himself, Saddam has given special privileges to the
men in the army and state security, who with their families make up
a significant portion of Iraq's estimated population of 17 million.
He has cleverly courted the people who officially own guns.
   Despite the fear and repression, diplomats in Baghdad contend
Saddam has a lot of genuine followers.
   Pictures of Saddam dot the landscape in Baghdad. They hang from
buildings and on the walls in offices, hotels, apartments and
restaurants.
   The president in a variety of poses and dress waves or smiles
benevolently from billboard-sized portraits in major traffic
circles.
   ``Many people support him from deep in the heart,'' said one
diplomat. ``He has improved life for many people and taught them to
be proud.
   ``They won a war. Now they're defying a superpower. It looks
like they can do anything they want as a nation and no one can stop
them.''

<HEAD>Analysts: It's a Crisis the Country Can Live With</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush goes before Congress and the
people tonight at the pinnacle of his power in the Persian Gulf
crisis, with the country and much of the world behind him but a big
question mark ahead of him.
   Assume 90 days pass. Saddam Hussein's Iraq has neither gone to
war nor withdrawn from Kuwait. The American troops are still
sweating it out in Saudi Arabia. Starving hostages are paraded on
television. The embargo is fraying. A recession and inflation are
setting in. The president appears to be a prisoner of his policies.
   It sounds like what happened _ and then some _ to Jimmy Carter,
who saw his popularity surge when Americans were taken hostage in
the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979, then fall as low as it has gone
in the modern presidency as Carter seemed obsessed by the crisis.
   By learning from Carter, Bush can avoid the pitfalls of a
dragged-out crisis, say observers of politics, public opinion and
international affairs
   Their conclusion: America can adjust to this crisis, even over
the long haul.
   One says Bush may have made a mistake even by deciding to
deliver tonight's high-profile, expectations-raising address to
Congress.
   ``A big-deal speech might not be the wisest thing for the
president to do as far as keeping concern about the crisis under
control and keeping the issue from becoming all-consuming,'' says
political scientist John Mueller of the University of Rochester,
author of ``War, Presidents and Public Opinion.''
   But the consensus seems to be that Bush can keep public and
world support behind him, at least for the rest of the year, even
if the crisis turns into a stalemate and begins pinching at home.
   ``I don't see it all unraveling for President Bush,'' says
Thomas Mann, a Brookings Institution expert on the ways of
Congress. ``To the extent we avoid a hot war and continue to
maintain overwhelming international solidarity, the public will not
desert the president, nor will Congress.''
   Mann says Bush has been able to ``avoid some of Carter's more
obvious mistakes.'' Carter erred, he says, by ``stopping all
government and mobilizing all attention on gaining the release of
the hostages.''
   He says, too, that criticism of the president on other issues _
the state of the economy, for example _ isn't going to take a
holiday.
   ``I think the consensus will be supportive of the president and
his efforts until there are some really important consequences,''
says Ada W. Finifter, a Michigan State University political
scientist and expert on public opinion.
   By ``important consequences'' she means ``if we start getting a
body count'' in a dragged-out war, the economy turns severely sour
or the government has to cut popular spending programs.
   As for stalemate, she says, ``We've had soldiers stationed all
over the world for many, many years; diplomatic stalemate is not
necessarily a problem.''
   A disagreeing view comes from Patrick Glynn, an arms control
adviser in the Reagan administration. He believes the crisis must
be resolved next month if it to end favorably for the United States.
   ``If we don't have a war or a diplomatic solution by October,
then we've lost and it will only be a matter of time,'' Glynn says.
   ``Our power position will erode, public support will erode,
international solidarity will disintegrate and it will only be a
matter of time before we are forced to make an unsatisfactory
compromise. ... An ambiguous solution is a Bush defeat and a big
defeat for the country.''
   Madeleine Albright, who advised Democratic presidential
candidate Michael Dukakis on foreign policy in 1988 and teaches at
Georgetown University, believes Bush must keep explaining U.S.
policy if he wants to retain public support.
   ``He is going to have to keep going on television or people will
start wondering why they have to be there forever,'' she says.
   Mueller of the University of Rochester says Bush would be wise
to ``prepare the American people for a fairly long siege'' and then
make a show of going about his business _ working on the deficit,
for example.
   But Mann of Brookings says the other problems are so severe _
the S&amp;L crisis, the possible danger of a banking crisis, a soft
economy, the budget deficit _ that Bush might do well to focus on
the Middle East.
   Murray Weidenbaum, who was an economic adviser to President
Reagan, says Bush can expect a recession _ one seems likely in any
event _ as the result of higher oil prices and lower supplies, but
he believes the downturn will be relatively short and mild.
   ``It's not the double-digit unemployment and the double-digit
inflation of a decade ago,'' says Weidenbaum. But ``it's not going
to be good news for the White House.''
   Mueller foresees a ``national frustration'' setting in if the
gulf situation turns into a holding operation. But he think the
public will understand if Bush explains that going to war against
Iraq simply would result in too many American battle deaths.
   He recalls ``the tremendous frustration'' the public felt after
a 1983 barracks bomb killed 241 U.S. Marines in Lebanon. But Reagan
said he could not strike back because there was no target to hit
``people understood that; they bought that.''

   If Edward Norton were running for Congress and
his wife Eleanor didn't mail their tax returns for eight years,
would that be the end of his career?
   Political analysts think probably not. But they see dimmer
prospects for his wife, whose real-life District of Columbia
congressional bid appears to be sinking under the weight of her
husband's tax revelations.
   ``I can't recall a male candidate who's been penalized by
something that his wife has done,'' says Jane Danowitz, director of
the Women's Campaign Fund. ``And yet we see scores of women that
people are attempting to bring down by citing their husbands'
indiscretions.''
   Norton is not the only candidate having husband trouble this
year.
   Democrat Dianne Feinstein is on the defensive about her wealthy
husband's complex business dealings, investments and contributions
to her campaign for governor of California.
   And in Colorado, Democratic Senate candidate Josie Heath's
husband retired from Manville Corp. earlier than he had planned
when Heath's primary opponent tried to tie her environmental record
to Manville's asbestos problems.
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, a law professor and former Carter
administration civil rights official, had projected a winning image
of strength and competence. The disclosure that her husband hadn't
filed the couple's D.C. tax returns since 1982 _ and hadn't told
her _ was disheartening to many supporters.
   The Norton debacle reminded many of Geraldine Ferraro's ordeal
as the Democratic nominee for vice president in 1984. Her husband,
John Zaccaro, initially caused a flap by refusing to release his
income tax returns.
   The situation escalated with questions about his father's Mafia
ties, an alleged illegal bribe and a conservatorship that he was
found to have mishandled. Zaccaro eventually was acquitted by a
jury of the bribery allegation.
   Two years before Ferraro's troubles, Democrat Roxanne Conlin was
coasting toward the governorship of Iowa. Then she disclosed that
she and her husband, a real estate investor, were worth $2.2
million but had paid no state income taxes and made only a token
federal payment the year before.
   Voters didn't buy her explanation that she owed no taxes because
of her husband's business losses _ especially since he was using
real estate tax shelters that she had campaigned against.
   A husband's dealings also proved fatal in 1987, when California
Secretary of State March Fong Eu dropped out of a Democratic Senate
primary race rather than meet financial disclosure requirements
regarding her income. Eu said her ``married relationship is such''
that she couldn't reveal details of her husband's interests in Hong
Kong and Singapore.
   While recent history is dotted with troublesome husbands, it is
harder to find cases in which men have paid for their wives'
behavior.
   There was Marion Javits' lucrative consultant work for the
Iranian government, which greatly embarrassed her husband, the late
Sen. Jacob Javits, R-N.Y. And Sen. Mark Hatfield's wife triggered
an ethics probe by accepting $55,000 in real estate fees from a
Greek businessman.
   However, Danowitz said ``these people made the personality
column but not the front page. It's been a personal interest story
rather than something terribly damaging'' to the politician.
   The disparity is attributed by many to a patronizing view of
women: they are presumed to have less influence over their
husbands, less of a power base in the outside world and less
potential for creating a conflict of interest.
   ``It's a double standard,'' says John Reilly, the political
adviser who was in charge of selecting the Democrats' 1984 vice
presidential candidate. ``It's a throwback and it bothers me.''
   As more political wives pursue careers of their own, analysts
wonder if their activities will be scrutinized as carefully as
those of the political husbands now in the spotlight.
   ``It may be that when women come of age in all aspects of our
society, they'll have an equally detrimental effect on the
campaigns of their spouses,'' Danowitz joked.
   But for now, the Norton saga is another cautionary tale for
women.
   ``It certainly will redouble everyone's efforts to ensure that
women running for office know everything there is to be known about
their family circumstances,'' said Wendy Sherman, executive
director of Emily's List, a Democratic fund-raising group that
endorsed Norton.

<TEXT>
   Animal rights activists have gone to court in an
attempt to block the trade of an aggressive dolphin from the New
England Aquarium to a secret Navy training center in California.
   Opponents of the swap claim the Navy trains dolphins for
hazardous duty.
   A lawsuit seeking to block the trade was filed Monday in federal
court by Steven Wise, an attorney for Citizens to End Animal
Suffering and Exploitation. He said a hearing would be held
Wednesday or Thursday.
   The aquarium wants to trade Rainbow, a 450-pound male, to the
Naval Ocean Systems Center in San Diego, Calif., for a partly deaf
female dolphin.
   The Navy center said it trains and studies 142 marine mammals in
underwater surveillance and other activities.
   Opponents say the aquarium lacks the required paperwork for the
trade.

   Spc. Curtis Young is usually the quiet
one of the 256th. But this night, riding to the gym, he blurts out,
``I'm beginning to believe I made a mistake here.''
   ``My Momma's got other boys and none of them was interested in
the military,'' he said, ``and here I am and look where they're
sending me.''
   Young, a 25-year-old prison guard, is going to the Mideast along
with 14 fellow members of the 265th Quartermaster Detachment, a
water purification unit of the South Carolina National Guard.
   He is not the only one a little disconcerted about his situation.
   No one among this group of friends and neighbors from Allendale,
S.C., is happy about going to a potential war zone. There is no
strutting or bravado about the subject. There is hardly any talk
about Iraq or Saddam Hussein or the geopolitical issues the
part-time soldiers are caught up in.
   They make bad jokes about being gassed. They laugh about the
combinations of bad timing and fate that have put them in the
situation. But there is surprisingly little complaining.
   ``I never thought when I joined that I'd wind up in Saudi
Arabia,'' said Henry Harris, a 51-year-old teacher. ``But it's our
duty to go.''
   The reasons the men did join the Guard are varied. Money.
Education. Security. Friendship. Some joined because they served in
the regular military; others because they hadn't.
   ``I wanted to try something different,'' said Sgt. Earnest
Deloach. ``I guess I got different.''
   The National Guard offers members a variety of advantages. The
first is money. For serving one weekend a month and two weeks each
summer, a guardsman can get a minimum of $4,000 to $8,000 a year
depending on rank and years of service.
   The salaries and other Guard spending can add up for a
community. In Allendale County, the Guard estimates it has a $1
million impact on the economy.
   A second reason to join is security. If you complete 20 years of
service you get a pension and guaranteed health care for you and
your spouse. More than half the 265th has 16 or more years of
service already.
   The Guard also offers education. You can attend special schools
that teach you a trade. There also are programs to help pay college
expenses.
   Spc. Bobby Youmans, another prison guard, had planned to start
college under the program. His call-up has put those plans off.
   But Youmans spoke of another reason he joined the Guard 11 years
ago.
   ``It gives you a chance to meet with other people,'' he said.
``You get to move in other circles. Instead of going with the same
crowd every weekend, you can hang out with the people you meet
through your unit.''
   Youmans, 29, explained all this to Young, a newcomer who has
been in the unit three years.
   Young is whippet-thin and usually quiet until he steps out on
the basketball court. Then he is a one-man cheering section,
talking incessantly, yelling for the ball and giggling hoarsely.
When he runs down the court his face is in near joy.
   Young and Youmans work together on the middle shift in the
maximum security lockup at the Allendale Correctional Institution.
Riding back from the gym, they wondered if the guys back at the
prison miss them. Youmans thought they might.
   Young didn't seem to care.
   ``That's one job I ain't in no hurry to get back to,'' he said.

<HEAD>USDA Rumor Mill Turns on Spending Splurge, Layoffs</HEAD>

   Psst. They're getting a new carpet down the
hall, check it out. Psst. Guess who's buying new computers for the
office? Psst ....
   The hallway chatter at the Agriculture Department is rife with
such nuggets, sometimes not so trivial in this time of budget
balancing and spending crunches.
   After all, unless Congress and the White House reach and
agreement on how to whack $50 billion or so from next fiscal year's
federal budget, it'll get pretty serious for government workers by
Oct. 1.
   In the USDA, for example, thousands of workers will have to take
unpaid furloughs from their jobs as their contribution to fiscal
solvency.
   Meat and poultry inspectors will take holidays toward the end of
the first two-week pay period of October. County offices that make
payments to farmers in crop programs will close early.
   Offices that take applications for emergency loans won't be
servicing those quite so handily. Dairy farmers and other producers
sharing in price support benefits will take pay cuts.
   But if the government is so hard up, why all the talk about the
Farmers Home Administration, the Agriculture Stabilization and
Conservation Service, the Foreign Agricultural Service and other
agencies buying all sorts of goodies before the fiscal year runs
out on Sept. 30?
   ``There's always been some of this,'' one mid-level employee
said Monday. ``But I can't remember when it's been this blatant to
unload money.''
   The employee and several others, who insisted on anonymity,
referred to their agencies splurging in the last few months _ money
that comes out of the current fiscal year's budget.
   Obviously, one said, the agencies would rather spend unused or
otherwise unneeded funds on expanding or remodeling offices with
new furniture, drapes, computer equipment and other job-related
devices than to lose the money by not spending it at all.
   Kelly Shipp, chief spokeswoman for Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter and director of the department's office of public affairs,
discounted such talk and said year-end spending is ``highly, highly
scrutinized'' by federal procurement officials.
   Certain deadlines and procedures have to be met by those who
spend USDA money, she said, and policies are in place ``so there
isn't unwise spending'' as the fiscal year winds down.
   But Shipp said there are lots of variables in government
procurement and that often new purchases are put off until the end
of the year when it's clearer how much money is available.
   ``You put off things that are legitimate purchases,'' she said.
``You want to make sure there are adequate funds. So there are some
legitimate reasons why people wait till the year end.''
   One of the unwritten rules among bureaucrats is to guard against
having next year's spending request cut sharply by the Office of
Management and Budget in the White House, or by an economizing
appropriations committee on Capitol Hill.
   After all, if the Forest Service or the Extension Service isn't
using all the money authorized in 1990, why should additional funds
be provided in 1991?
   ``That's the vicious circle of how we legislate,'' Shipp said in
a recent interview. ``It's not so much the mentality of the
bureaucrats; it's the way the rules are set up. If there's a
weakness ... it's that sometimes the (congressional) appropriations
committee will look at your current services and cut you back.''
   Thus, she said, an agency doesn't get any credit for not
spending money it had available.
   ``You can't carry over money, so the system doesn't have any
incentive built into it to encourage (savings),'' the spokeswoman
said. ``I'm surprised with the way people do try to save money.
People do, everybody tries to save money.''
   Shipp recently moved into another office as part of her new
assignment as USDA's director of public affairs. She kept the old
carpet but wants it purged of silverfish and any other stray bugs
that might be present.

<HEAD>Administration Threatening Veto of Cable Restrictions Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is threatening to veto
a bill that would impose restrictions on the cable TV industry,
beset by consumer complaints of price gouging, poor service and
unfair marketing.
   The House on Monday approved, by a voice vote, legislation to
impose federal limits on the price of basic cable service. It would
force price rollbacks on the worst offenders and open up the video
entertainment business to new forms of competition.
   The legislation, which now goes to the Senate, would partially
re-regulate an industry that has grown rapidly since deregulation
in 1984 and, in some areas consumer advocates say, has begun to
look like a runaway monopoly.
   ``This bill will not only allow the Federal Communications
Commission to rein in the renegades in the cable industry, but it
also takes realistic steps to ensure competition so consumers will
have real choices in the future regarding video services,'' said
Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
telecommunications subcommittee.
   A similar bill was approved by the Senate Commerce Committee in
June and awaits action by the full chamber.
   The Bush administration adamantly opposes the bill, and the
Office of Management and Budget said Monday the president's top
advisers would recommend a veto if the legislation were to win
congressional approval.
   An administration statement said among other problems, the
measure may violate the First Amendment because it prescribes rules
for the signals a cable system must carry.
   Rather than impose regulations, the administration argued,
Congress should consider opening new competitive opportunities in
the industry by allowing telephone companies, now barred from the
cable television business, to enter the field.
   Under the House measure, the FCC would be required to set a
maximum allowable price for basic cable service, defined as all
local commercial and public broadcasts together with any public,
educational or governmental-access programming. The basic package
could also include C-SPAN, which broadcasts congressional
activities, at the option of the cable company.
   The commission also would be required to monitor service charges
imposed on subscribers for any changes in the type of service they
receive. That provision stems from complaints that some cable
operators charge excessive fees to discourage subscribers from
switching to lower-cost options.
   The FCC would not be able to regulate rates charged for premium
channels such as Disney, Showtime and Home Box Office, but would be
empowered to force price rollbacks on cable systems with rates
deemed unreasonable or abusive.
   Since the 1984 Cable Act deregulated the industry, the number of
cable subscribers has soared along with complaints about high
prices, bad service and unfair marketing practices that force
consumers to buy services they don't want.
   The industry has grown into ``an unregulated monopoly'' in which
``quality goes down while prices go up,'' said Rep. Dennis Eckart,
D-Ohio. The bill approved by the House gives local governments more
clout in making sure local companies live up to their franchise
agreements while opening the field to competition from technologies
such as direct satellite broadcasts, he said.
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
has reported that from 1987 through 1989 rates for the
lowest-priced cable service rose an average of 43 percent, from
$11.14 to $15.95 per subscriber, while the average number of basic
channels rose from 24 to 31. The price increase was far higher than
the rate of inflation for that period.

   The Bush administration is trying to line up Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and Syria in an informal alliance to isolate Iraq.
   But Israel, long America's most reliable friend in the Middle
East, could wind up being the odd man out.
   As the United States grows closer to the three Arab countries,
its strategic dependence on Israel for such missions as
pre-positioning weapons and support facilities grows less critical.
   Egypt and Saudi Arabia, hesitant only a few years ago to be
closely identified with the United States, have been driven by
their fear of Iraq's President Saddam Hussein into unabashed ties
with Washington.
   They are ready to create a new and permanent security structure
with the United States in the Persian Gulf.
   And Syria has suddenly become candidate to join the coalition
despite its record of human rights abuses and terrorism
accusations, including sponsorship of a radical Palestinian group
suspected in the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland in
December 1988 in which 280 people perished.
   Baker announced Monday at NATO headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium, that he will go to Damascus to meet with President Hafez
Assad.
   The purpose, Baker said, was to explore ``how we might cooperate
to achieve what happens to be our mutual goals.''
   He said the joint aim was to isolate Saddam with a strict
economic boycott and to confront him with an international ground
and sea force.
   Baker acknowledged the United States had ``differences'' and
``difficulties'' with Syria and would discuss them with Assad when
they meet Friday. But Baker did not dwell on the terrorism and
human rights problems.
   While constructing this new alliance, the Bush administration
has begun to put more pressure on Israel to make peace with
Palestinians and to return territory Syria and Jordan lost in their
humiliating defeat in the Six-Day War of 1967.
   President Bush and Baker have revived consideration of an
international peace conference. It is an idea that drives Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir up the wall because he fears that a
Soviet-Arab coalition would force unfavorable terms on Jerusalem.
   Bush on Sunday also called for implementing ``sooner, rather
than later,'' 1967 and 1973 U.N. Security Council resolutions
providing for Israel to give up the Golan Heights to Syria and the
West Bank to Jordan.
   The president made the statement in Helsinki, Finland, at the
windup of his summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   It obviously pleased Gorbachev, who said the Arab-Israeli
dispute was of ``equal concern'' with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
_ ``even more,'' in fact, he said.
   Bush and Baker also have reversed the two-decade-old U.S. policy
of trying to undercut Soviet influence in the Middle East. Baker
called that approach ``old thinking.''
   Israel has been taking the administration's advice and
maintained a low profile since Iraq invaded Kuwait five weeks ago.
The United States, after all, had adopted the Israeli view that
Iraq posed a grave danger in the volatile Middle East and was
organizing a campaign designed to cut Saddam down to size.
   Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy met with Baker in Washington
last Thursday and emerged on a first-name basis, praising Bush and
Baker as courageous.
   ``Mr. Secretary, or rather my friend, Jim, I can go home with a
positive feeling and happy, fully believing in our possibility of
cooperating and working together,'' Levy said.
   Perhaps that spirit still prevails.
   Even as the United States proceeded with its new makeshift
alliance, former Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
recently: ``I believe the U.S. will achieve its goal and the
situation will return to what it was'' before the Iraqi invasion.
   And yet Baker's mission to Damascus after he completes talks
here Thursday with Soviet leaders will draw the United States
closer to the Arabs with unforeseen consequences for Israel.
   In the meantime, the administration's plan to isolate Iraq is
being tested by the restoration of diplomatic relations by Baghdad
with Iran.

<HEAD>Activation of Reserve Cargo Ships Behind Schedule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first large activation of reserve U.S.
cargo ships is behind schedule, but the Navy says it's satisfied
with the fleet's performance in transporting supplies to the
Persian Gulf.
   The Navy has activated 42 ships of the 96-ship Ready Reserve
Force, but 26 of them did not meet individual readiness timetables
of either five, 10 or 20 days, according to official figures
supplied to The Associated Press.
   The crisis in the gulf region provided the Navy with its first
opportunity to activate the Ready Reserve Force, created in 1976
and positioned in ports around the country.
   Vice Adm. Stanley R. Arthur, deputy chief of naval operations
for logistics, said there were ``glitches'' in getting the reserve
fleet ready to transport helicopters, tanks, howitzers and other
equipment.
   But he told a House Merchant Marine subcommittee that the
vessels _ mostly of 1960s and 1970s vintage _ have ``exceeded
expectations.''
   Delays were caused in part by equipment failures, including
problems with steam boilers, and by the time necessary to find
merchant seamen to run the ships.
   Some ships have been delayed for weeks, while others missed
their deadlines by only a day.
   The figures were provided to The Associated Press by the
Maritime Administration, a Transportation Department agency that
maintains the cargo ships until they're needed by the Navy's
Military Sealift Command.
   Seven ships met their timetables and nine were not counted
against the deadlines because they needed major repairs. The Navy
activated these nine ships knowing they would not meet the
timetables, Maritime Administration officials said.
   The ships are crucial to supplying U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia
because heavy military equipment will not fit in the containers
used in modern cargo vessels.
   The reserve force includes: roll on-roll off ships, where
equipment can be driven up and down ramps; break bulk carriers,
where equipment is placed on platforms and then hoisted on the
vessels; ships that carry barges or other floating devices that can
be sent with their equipment down rivers; and ships that have
cranes aboard to load and unload cargo without the need for
unloading facilities at a port.
   Among the Ready Reserve Force ships activated so far, all but
one were assigned either a five- or 10-day period for the Maritime
Administration to make them ready for Navy sealift duty.
   Of those in the five-day period, 24 were delivered to the Navy
late, four were tendered on time and seven were in need of repairs
and therefore not counted against the timetable.
   Among the 10-day ships, two were delivered late, three were
turned over before the deadline and one was in need of repair.
   The single 20-day ship was in a repair yard and not counted
against the timetable, although it was fixed and given to the Navy
before the deadline.
   The Ready Reserve Force is part of the 217 ships in the National
Defense Reserve Fleet that are considered militarily useful.
   Many of the vessels date back to the World War II era. Congress
is considering legislation that would force about 100 of the oldest
ships to be sold for scrap to U.S. salvage firms.
   Arthur said three of those ships are in the Ready Reserve fleet,
including two that were activated. But the rest are in the portion
of the national defense fleet that is unlikely to be called to duty.
   Those ships built before Jan. 1, 1946 would, under the
legislation, be sold to domestic salvage companies.
   ``These World War II-era ships are floating rust buckets,'' said
Rep. William Broomfield, R-Mich., who with Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,
sponsored the bill to junk the older ships in the fleet.
   During a Monday subcommittee hearing, the two pressed for
passage of their bill.
   ``I do not pretend to be an expert in maritime affairs. But I
recognize junk when I see it,'' Broomfield said. Added Wyden:
``These are the oldest, most decrepit portions of the fleet and
they serve no useful purpose.''
   But Robert Martinez, deputy administrator of the Maritime
Administration, said the outward appearance of the older ships is
poor, but the interiors are protected by dehumidification.
   He said it would be a mistake to dispose of the vessels
``without any recognition ... as to U.S. national security
requirements.''
   Martinez said his agency already has a successful program to
exchange outmoded ships in the fleet for newer vessels that will
upgrade the reserve fleet. This program, he said, is a way of
modernizing the reserve fleet.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said he was considering
whether to ask that the government resume subsidies to the U.S.
maritime industry that were eliminated by the Reagan
administration, The Washington Post reported today.
   Skinner, in an interview with the newspaper, said he would not
make a recommendation, however, until his department has had a
chance to study U.S. shipping performance in Operation Desert
Shield.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Consider Free Mail for Persian Gulf Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 100,000 U.S. troops on duty in the Middle
East could begin sending letters home by simply signing their names
on the envelopes under legislation moving rapidly through Congress.
   On a unanimous voice vote, the Senate on Monday approved a
measure by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to provide free mail
privileges, last widely used during the Vietnam War, to American
service personnel in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf region.
   Similar legislation, which has been endorsed by the Bush
administration, was introduced in the House by Rep. William Ford,
D-Mich., chairman of the its Post Office and Civil Service
Committee. Ford said he hopes the House will vote on it early next
week.
   Several lawmakers who visited with U.S. troops in the region the
past two weeks while Congress was on vacation said a common
complaint they heard was the inability to find stamps.
   ``No one needs to be told that mail is the crucial link between
the fighting man or woman and his family and friends back home,''
he said. ``They did not have stamps, they could not get stamps and,
if by some chance stamps came their way, they were soon stuck
together by the humidity and the sweat.''
   The measure would apply only to mail sent from the Middle East
to the United States. It would cover letters, post cards, and audio
and video cassettes but not other items.
   Under current law that dates from World War I, troops get free
mailing privileges only during combat. The Postal Service estimates
the free mail privileges would cost taxpayers $500,000 a month.

<HEAD>Candidate's Mailing Includes Offers for Condoms</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Note subject matter</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homosexual congressional candidate is
soliciting political contributions in a campaign mailing that also
offers condoms and subscriptions to gay magazines.
   Sean O'Brien Strub's marketing and direct mail company recently
targeted the gay market with packets to about 100,000 households
across the country.
   Enclosed with Strub's political pitch comes an offer for a
pamphlet from the Gay Men's Health Crisis that promises ``hotter,
safer sex for gay men.'' Each pink, black and silver envelope
contains postcards that can be mailed away for products or
services, including condoms.
   Strub, an openly gay Democrat from Rockland County, N.Y.,
northwest of New York City, is hoping to defeat nine-term incumbent
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.
   Strub faces one of the few Democratic primaries in New York
today. He is running against John Dow who, at age 85, is trying to
recapture a long-lost congressional seat. Dow served in Congress
from 1964-68 and from 1970-72.
   Strub said he has resisted being labeled ``the gay candidate.''
   ``I'm no more the gay candidate than Ann Richards is the woman
candidate for Texas governor or than David Dinkins was the black
candidate for mayor or than Ben Gilman is the Jewish candidate,''
he said.
   Asked whether it bothered him to have his appeal sandwiched in
with condom offers, Strub said: ``You've got to look at it as one
of the ads. If I bought an ad in a magazine and that was one of the
ads, would I be upset? No.''
   Strub's campaign bought the advertising space, at cost, from
Strub's company, he said last week.
   ``My company didn't make money from my campaign,'' he stressed,
although the card pack is a profit-making enterprise.
   The 32-year-old Strub said he was confident he'd win today's
primary.
   If he beats Gilman in November, he would become the first person
elected to Congress as an openly gay candidate. Two members, Reps.
Barney Frank and Gerry Studds, both D-Mass., revealed their
homosexuality after they were already in office.

<HEAD>Policy Makers Ready To ``Rachet up The Pressure'' Around Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
vowing to hold on to Kuwait, policy-makers in Washington and Moscow
are studying what steps the United Nations can take to tighten the
noose around Iraq.
   ``There are a lot of ways you could rachet up the pressure'' in
a series of small steps, said a State Department official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in
their Helsinki Summit communique, said: ``We are determined to see
this aggression end, and if the current steps fail to end it, we
are prepared to consider additional ones consistent with the U.N.
Charter.''
   Four days after the Aug. 2 invasion and occupation of Kuwait,
the Security Council ordered a complete embargo on trade with Iraq,
with the only goods exempted being medicines and medical equipment
``and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs.''
   On Monday, Saddam tried to skirt the oil blockade by offering to
give away crude oil to any Third World country that sends tankers
through the blockade to pick it up, an indication Baghdad is
becoming desperate in its attempt to break out of international
isolation.
   But for any move Saddam makes, the Security Council can offer a
countermove.
   The U.N. ambassador for the exiled Kuwaiti government, Mohammad
Abulhasan, on Thursday proposed that the Security Council urgently
consider ``blocking the air corridors, seizing Iraqi ships, going
to a formal (naval) blockade.''
   All those moves are possible under Chapter Seven of the U.N.
Charter, which goes so far as permitting ``demonstrations,
blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of
Members of the United Nations.''
   However, a State Department official, speaking privately, said
Monday that Washington and Moscow want to move cautiously: ``The
immediate concern is how do you make the current sanctions stick.''
   The Soviets have said they would be willing to send troops to
the Persian Gulf if there were a joint U.N. military command, and
if they would be under the command of a Soviet general.
   Gorbachev, however, said in Helsinki that the Soviet Union is
not now considering even sending ships to help enforce the embargo.
   ``I don't see the point of doing that now,'' he said, and Bush
replied, ``I'm not disappointed in that answer.''
   The State Department official said, ``There are a lot of ways
you could rachet up the pressure, through being more and more
explicit about the resolutions already in place, short of major
Chapter Seven actions.
   ``The thrust is to make sure other countries live up to these
angles,'' he said.
   India, Bangladesh, the Philippines and other nations are already
petitioning the Security Council's sanctions committee for
permission to ship food into Iraq and Kuwait to feed the hundreds
of thousands of their people who are still stranded there.
   The council's sanctions committee has not yet determined that
conditions in Iraq or occupied Kuwait are desperate enough to allow
the import of food as a ``humanitarian'' step.
   The Kuwaiti ambassador and other diplomats have spoken of the
possibility of having the Security Council impose an air blockade
on Iraq, comparable to the current naval embargo enforced by the
U.S.-led fleet in the Persian Gulf.
   But the U.S. official said ``you could say that shipment of
cargo by air is already prohibited by the sanctions; that is both a
service and an export, and clearly ruled out.''
   If countries neighboring Iraq allow the use of their airspace
for Iraqi flights, they would be ``facilitating transshipment,''
which the U.S. official said also would violate the embargo.
   Nations that violate a Security Council embargo may be subjected
to sanctions themselves.
   Some American officials believe a formal council resolution
endorsing an air embargo is not just unnecessary but could also
lead to dangerous confrontations.

<HEAD>Energy Official: Heating Oil Supplies Adequate Barring Problems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe cold or operating problems at oil
refineries could force heating oil shortages this winter, but
otherwise adequate supplies are expected, Energy Department
officials say.
   That assessment came Monday during a congressional hearing at
which several congressmen expressed concern about the outlook.
   ``There now is a very small margin of safety,'' said Rep. Philip
Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the House energy and power subcommittee,
who suggested that the Energy Department ``tends to underestimate
what can go wrong.''
   The reliance on foreign oil and lack of a domestic energy
program by the Bush administration was expected to come under
renewed attack today as another House subcommittee looks into what
measures should be to improve energy efficiency and conservation.
   Among those scheduled to testify before the House Interior
subcommittee on water, power and offshore energy resources will be
the sponsors of legislation that would require automakers to
sharply increase the fuel economy of automobiles.
   A bill that would call for a fleet average fuel economy
requirement of 40 miles per gallon by the end of the decade could
come up for Senate floor action later this week, according to
Senate sources.
   On Monday, Energy Department officials cautiously predicted
adequate fuel oil for this winter, but said the situation could
change for the worse if there is a severely cold winter or if
operating problems develop at refineries, which are have been going
at near-maximum 96 percent capacity. Further disruptions to Mideast
oil shipments, also could cause shortages, they said.
   Several congressmen complained the assessment was based on
``rosy assumptions'' and suggested that it provides little comfort
to Americans relying on oil to heat homes and factories.
   Calvin A. Kent, head of the Energy Information Administration,
told Sharp's subcommittee that U.S. petroleum stocks ``appear
adequate'' and that the shortfall of an estimated 1 million barrels
of crude oil a day worldwide toward the end of the year ``can be
handled'' as increased prices dampen demand.
   Kent said that refineries were operating at their maximum, but
that the capacity to refine crude both in the United States and
elsewhere ``appears to be adequate ... and will remain so over the
next three to six months.''
   Nevertheless, several other congressmen reiterated their call
for President Bush to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve. Sharp said the president should consider ``at least a
modest'' drawdown of the 590-million barrel reserve ``to get
confidence up and hopefully force prices down.''
   The Bush administration has rejected use of the reserves unless
there are ``significant supply interruptions.''
   Rep. Terry Bruce, D-Ill., said he was ``nervous'' about the slim
margin in refining capacity. ``I fear we will run out of heating
oil, gasoline and jet fuel,'' he said.
   Kent gave these assessments on the expected supply of various
refined crude oil products:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Heating Oil</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Current stocks are ``well above normal'' and rising. Supplies in
the Northeast, which relies heavily on oil to heat homes and
factories, are 16 percent above last year. The stocks ``appear to
be adequate, barring any unusually cold weather or refinery
breakdowns.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Gasoline</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Localized supply problems could develop. Inventories are at the
lowest level since July 1988 _ 5.9 million barrels above the
minimum operating inventory required to prevent shortages. Stocks,
while tight, ``should be adequate to see us through the fourth
quarter.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Jet Fuel</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Supply is above last year's levels but still tight and problems
could develop late in the winter. Demand from the military is
300,000 barrels a day greater than normal because of the Persian
Gulf deployment.

<HEAD>Report: World Facing Education Crisis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A global education crisis is underway with
more than 100 million youngsters in the world's poorest countries
not receiving any formal schooling, a report says.
   There will be more than 1 billion illiterate adults by the end
of the decade if the United States and other nations fail to
address this Third World education crisis, said the report released
by RESULTS Educational Fund, an international citizen lobbying
group.
   The report precedes a ``World Summit for Children,'' scheduled
for Sept. 29-30 at the United Nations, and calls on President Bush
to use his speech to the group to launch a new U.S. foreign aid
basic education initiative.
   The main recommendation of the report is that the United States
double within the next three years the annual amount of foreign aid
going to basic education. In evaluating America's current
contribution, the report found that less than 1 percent of U.S.
foreign aid goes for that purpose.
   Furthermore, the report said, U.S. aid in basic education will
decrease this year by 25 percent, from $129.5 million in fiscal
year 1989 to $96.9 million in fiscal year 1990, a drop of more than
$32 million.
   To reverse the decline, the United States must increase the
amount of its foreign aid going to basic education to at least $370
million per year, the group said. Just by shifting a small portion
of current aid funds away from less productive spending, such as
military foreign aid, would provide all the new funding needed, the
report added.
   The report said that Bush, by launching the new initiative,
could prompt similar efforts by other donor nations and ``make a
powerful contribution to making basic education and literacy for
all a global reality.''
   Right now, there are more than 850 million adult illiterates,
with close to 98 percent of them in the developing nations, and
more than 60 percent of them women, the report said. Women made up
86 percent of the 154 million new adult illiterates from 1960 to
1985; and more than 100 million primary-age children, mostly girls,
currently are not enrolled in school.
   Thirty-four countries have literacy rates of about 40 percent or
less. In 15 more, at least one-third of all adults are illiterate,
the report said.
   RESULTS Education Fund is a non-partisan, non-profit
organization. Most of the statistics were gathered during a March
world conference in Thailand and from information tallied by
countries since 1946, officials said.

<HEAD>Neil Bush Could Repeat `Misconduct' at Another S&amp;L, OTS Warns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neil Bush is capable of repeating the conduct
that harmed a collapsed Colorado savings and loan by becoming a
director at another thrift, regulators have told an administrative
law judge.
   In written arguments submitted Monday to Judge Daniel J.
Davidson, the Office of Thrift Supervision opposed Bush's request
to dismiss the government's conflict of interest case against him.
   The president's son was an outside director of Silverado
Banking, Savings and Loan Association, a Denver thrift that failed
in late 1988 at a cost to taxpayers estimated at $1 billion.
   The OTS is seeking an order against Bush which effectively would
bar him from working for a bank or a savings and loan.
   In his arguments filed late last month, Bush said there was no
possibility that he could continue the alleged abuses since
Silverado already has been taken over by the government. Bush, 35,
continued to deny any wrongdoing.
   The thrift agency called that argument ``specious.'' Under the
S&amp;L bailout legislation enacted by Congress last year, regulators
are supposed to stop harmful practices whether or not the practices
would damage a specific institution if continued, the OTS said.
   ``Bush is perfectly capable of becoming a director at another
institution and repeating his misconduct there,'' the agency's
brief said. ``Indeed, throughout these proceedings he has evinced
no willingness to consider that he has done anything wrong, nor
even any understanding that he ever had potential conflicts of
interest.
   ``In fact, the reasons that moved a $2 billion institution to
invite the then-30-year-old Bush, who had no experience in (savings
and loan operations) to become a director are even more forceful
today.''
   The OTS said it is clear that Bush's conduct ``was contrary to
generally accepted standards of prudent operation'' and could cause
harm to any financial institution if continued.
   The regulators have accused Bush of conflict of interest for not
disclosing his business ties to two big Silverado borrowers,
developers Kenneth M. Good and Bill L. Walters.
   Bush also could be a target of a negligence lawsuit that the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is considering filing against him
and other former Silverado directors.
   Bush has been ordered to appear at a public hearing on Sept. 25
in Denver before Davidson, who will then make a recommendation to
OTS Director Timothy Ryan.
   ``They don't answer anything,'' said Bush's attorney, James
Nesland, referring to the latest OTS brief.
   Nesland noted that the OTS arguments don't address the fact that
the proposed order against Bush would be the first against an
outside director after the institution has been closed.
   Nesland and Bush continue to maintain that the regulators'
actions are politically motivated.

   The humiliating removal from power of
Kuwait's royal family has raised questions about how long other
longtime rulers can survive in desert kingdoms carved out by the
swords of their Bedouin ancestors.
   The Iraqi takeover of Kuwait five weeks ago showed the weakness
of its emir and, by extension, of the other five conservative
dynasties running the region's oil-producing states.
   Middle East observers say the winds of political change were
already blowing and that Iraq's seizure of Kuwait has set in motion
forces that will spell the end of the old order _ one way or
another.
   Even the manner in which Saudi Arabia and other monarchies
appealed for help as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gobbled up
Kuwait underlined their inherent weakness.
   The invasion crystalized differences between Arab states and
split them into two camps: pro-Iraqi and pro-Saudi.
   Bahrain, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and, above all,
Saudi Arabia, had no choice but to line up behind Kuwait.
   After years of playing East against West, they are now
irrevocably linked to the West and the United States, which is seen
by most Arabs as Israel's protector.
   That puts them on a collision course with alien ideas and
Western political values, including a belief in pluralistic
democracy.
   ``Most people in the gulf expect some democratic changes after
this, and most governments are prepared to move. But don't expect
them to go the whole hog, establishing parliaments and the like,''
said Brian Pridham, director of Exeter University's Center for Arab
Gulf Studies in England.
   ``These regimes won't even consider it, and I'd hate to think
what would happen if they did.''
   Saddam's actions also have sharpened the Arab world's focus on
economic imbalances _ oil states that sit atop fabulous wealth,
while most states are deep in the red.
   ``The Kuwaiti Revolution of Aug. 2 has sounded the alarm bell
for other Kuwait-type regimes. It signaled a radical change of
system ... a new political era in the Arab Gulf region,'' the
official Iraqi News Agency declared.
   Even if Iraq is forced out of Kuwait and the deposed al-Sabah
family restored, it would be the status quo ante.
   ``It will not be possible for Western democracies to reinstall a
demonstrably non-democratic system in Kuwait,'' said Pridham.
   ``There will certainly be changes, some checks and balances,
some forms of democracy in an Arab style which will vary from state
to state,'' he said.
   Democracy is rare in the Arab world. Of 17 Arab states,
including Kuwait, six are secular dictatorships and six are
aboslute monarchies. Only five have introduced some minimal
elements of pluralism.
   Political evolution in the Arab world is slow. Neither Islam nor
Arab nations have democratic traditions. The six gulf kings are
remnants of the emirs, shieks and shahs who ruled throughout the
region for centuries.
   Libya, Egypt, Iran, Yemen and Iraq were all ruled by monarchs
who have been killed or ousted by coups since 1952. All, like the
dynasties of the gulf, had ruled with the support of Britain and
other colonial powers. Some were even hand-picked in London.
   But the gulf dynasties have hung on to power. Several can trace
their roots back more than 300 years.
   The emirs rule more or less benevolently. Some of the kingdoms,
observers say, are among the best governed nations in the Middle
East.
   Thanks to oil revenue, people enjoy a high standard of living
and a measure of personal freedom. The press may be censored, but
reporters are not hanged.
   Gulf sheiks wield power with an 18th century sense of noblesse
oblige, but no concessions to the democratic reforms sweeping much
of the rest of the world. They rule by edict, forbid political
parties, and reject popular governing bodies.
   Blessed with huge oil reserves and small populations, the rulers
have shown enough social concern and material largesse to keep most
subjects happy.
   Bahrain and Kuwait experimented with popular assemblies, but
they didn't last long. Elections and parliaments in an Arab context
are often looked upon as foolhardy steps toward chaos.
   ``Just look at Lebanon,'' Pridham said, ``That's what they think
democracy looks like in the Middle East ... These regimes were
horrified at the changes that swept Eastern Europe.''
   Moreover, recent elections in Jordan and Algeria saw Islamic
fundamentalists make significant gains, a specter that haunts gulf
rulers who have embraced many aspects of Western life.

<HEAD>Agreement Reached on Curbing Industrial Pollution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Negotiators are reporting the first
breakthrough in drafting a compromise clean air bill with a
tentative agreement between the House and Senate on the control of
smog-causing pollution from industry.
   Congressional sources emphasized, however, that there remained
major differences that have yet to be resolved despite mounting
time pressures. Congress plans to adjourn in early October.
   The sources, who demanded anonymity, said staff negotiators
agreed Monday on measures to be taken against industry to control
urban smog. They opted for tougher House provisions that would
require even small businesses to install new control equipment in
areas with severe pollution.
   The staff agreement was reached with the knowledge of lawmakers
on the House-Senate conference committee, although committee
members must still formally sign off on it, said one source close
to the negotiations.
   The committee has tried since June to resolve differences in
separate clean air bills that were approved by wide margins in the
House and Senate early this year.
   The agreement on so-called Title I, which includes the
industrial smog-control provisions and general air quality goals
for communities, was considered a major step forward in the
discussions.
   ``This is one of the major hurdles,'' said Daniel Weiss, who has
followed the clean air debates for the Sierra Club, an
environmental group.
   The massive and complex legislation calls for steep cuts in acid
rain, tougher emission controls on automobiles, requirements that
oil companies produce cleaner fuels and controls on toxic chemical
releases. The new requirements are predicted to cost industry $25
billion a year when all take effect at the end of the decade.
   The price tag has caused industry to intensify its lobbying
against portions of the bill in view of skyrocketing oil prices and
the increasing prospects of a recession.
   The Bush administration had opposed the stronger industrial smog
controls tentatively agreed to Monday, saying that if small
companies are required to install new control equipment the
legislation will become too expensive. Environmentalists argued
that small polluters account for nearly half of the smog in many
urban areas.
   Under the agreement, factories and businesses that release as
little as 25 to 50 tons of pollution annually would be required to
comply with new controls. The Senate bill had exempted facilities
that release less than 100 tons of pollution per year.
   Meanwhile, other controversial parts of the bill remain to be
worked out, including whether to provide financial assistance to
workers who lose their jobs because of tougher pollution controls.
   Some lawmakers have also suggested that parts of the bill should
be re-examined in light of the Mideast crisis and the latest oil
shocks.
   ``We may have to begin to reassess what is realistic,'' said
Democratic Rep. Mike Synar of Oklahoma, a leading oil state. He
suggested that some pollution control requirements on the petroleum
industry and a mandate for cleaner fuels might have to be delayed.
   Nevertheless, the agreement Monday on industrial pollution
represents the most significant progress yet in crafting a final
bill.
   The staff agreement also includes deadlines on when communities
must comply with federal air quality requirements. Both the House
and Senate versions had similar deadlines, giving most cities five
to 15 years to bring their air into compliance with federal health
standards. Los Angeles was given 20 years.
   But the agreement goes along with a House provision that would
continue to require the federal government to impose air pollution
control plans if cities fail to do so. The Senate version would
have ended that federal requirement.

   Congressional candidate Eleanor Holmes Norton
received an apology from her husband as he explained at a news
conference that he ``simply procrastinated'' by not filing local
tax returns since 1982.
   ``It was always a situation where I said, `I'll do this
tomorrow,''' Edward Norton, an attorney, told reporters Monday.
``I'm the villain in this ... and I apologize to my wife and the
citizens.''
   Mrs. Norton was flanked at the news conference by her husband
and their two children.
   ``This matter, having been laid before the public ... (means)
the voters of the District of Columbia have all they need to decide
whether I should be the next congresswoman,'' Mrs. Norton said on
the eve of the city's Democratic primary.
   Her husband said he ``simply procrastinated'' in not filing the
joint tax forms his wife signed.
   Mrs. Norton said she even asked her husband, ``Are the taxes in,
and he said, `Yes.' If I had knowingly done this, why would I be
running?''
   The candidate's husband said he handles the family's finances.
However, he did not reveal why he failed to inform his wife of the
tax problem after she entered the race or why he did not file the
forms in the first place. The couple filed no local returns between
1982 and 1989.
   Norton and her three opponents are vying for the non-voting U.S.
House delegate seat held by Walter Fauntroy, who is seeking the
Democratic nomination for mayor of District of Columbia in today's
primary.
   The tax conflict has helped breath new life into the campaigns
of Norton's three opponents, all of whom trailed her by 10 points
or more in opinion polls taken before the controversy began.
   Local political observers suggest that veteran city councilwoman
Betty Ann Kane stands to gain most from Norton's problems.
   The Washington Post endorsed Kane on Monday after revealing that
it scrapped a planned Norton endorsement once the stories about her
tax situation surfaced.
   ``I am in this race to stay,'' Norton said at a campaign rally.
``Those that think they could chase this woman out of this race ...
don't know a fighter when they see one.''
   Norton headed the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
during the Carter administration.

<TEXT>
   The Bedouins of Jordan, hearing Holy War in
the wind, pray to Allah that a modern clash of wills will not make
their ancient desert life vanish in the sands.
   Among the Bedouins, for centuries guided more by water and whim
than by lines on a map, any conflict threatens to restrict
movement, further threatening a way of life already in danger.
   ``War will damage the whole world,'' said Mohammed Salim,
squatting on his heels in a burlap-rag tent near this city north of
Amman. ``And the Bedouin will suffer, especially.''
   He wonders if he can go to Saudi Arabia _ or if he wants to _
under a climate of hostility over Iraq's Aug. 2 seizure of Kuwait.
He worries about market shortages in Jordan.
   Far to the south near Petra, Ali Salim Bedol watched the Iraqi
leader Saddam Hussein on a television set in the concrete block
shelter given to him when Bedouins were evicted from the
2,000-year-old ruins, now a major tourist attraction.
   ``Saddam is a great man,'' he said, ``but we do not want war. No
one can win if there is fighting. We want only peace, to take our
goats and camels where we want and to live among Arabs.''
   About 150,000 Bedouins live regularly in Jordan, under black
goat-hair tents or in tumbledown hovels, making up 5 percent of the
total population. Some stay put, but most pick up and roam at will.
   Another 9,000 are nomads, drifting back and forth toward Saudi
Arabia, whence Bedouin tribes came when the Hashemite royal family
settled in Jordan after World War I. The family had left the Hejaz
_ Saudi Arabia's Arabic name.
   Despite the Bedouins' warlike reputation, and their deep sense
of honor, most seem to reject Saddam's call to arms.
   Instead, they follow events by radio, newspapers passed from
hand to hand, or the occasional word from travelers. They discuss
the crisis endlessly around campfires at night.
   ``They are hit hard by the crisis,'' said Rebecca Salti, who
runs a Save the Children crafts project for Bedouins in the desert
east of Amman. ``Many are afraid Israel will attack and overrun
their grazing lands.''
   Bedouins once bolstered the political and military power base
behind Jordan's King Hussein. Camel-mounted troops of the fabled
Arab Legion enhanced their prestige and mystique.
   But severe drought in the 1970s killed their animals and brought
many Bedouin families to the outskirts of towns. Army service paid
high wages, which inevitably meant changes in the old way of life.
   Today, many families live precariously at the edge, still
fiercely loyal to the king but marginal to life in Jordan.
   A Bedouin who would identify himself only as Salam keeps his two
wives, 19 children, two camels and small herd of goats in a tent
compound on a barren hillside near Zarqa.
   With no income beyond what his animals produce, he survives by
the curious Third World mathematics which defy all accounting. If
the crisis continues, he said, his delicate balance will tilt.
   ``Never mind,'' he said. ``For a poor man, there is no fear in
death. A Bedouin needs nothing. We make clothes from our goats. We
have yogurt, meat. That is enough.''
   But his sons are in school, and he thinks of the future. They
may be engineers or doctors by day and Bedouins when they return at
night, he said. He supports Saddam but wants no war.
   ``Every country will be different if there is war,'' he said.
``We will not escape.''
   Pressed for his full name, he chuckled and said, ``Salam Yachak
el Haya.'' It wasn't his name. In Arabic it means Salam loves life.
   Ali Salim Bedol is already suffering. He once earned a modest
living selling souvenirs to tourists at Petra. Now, the tourists
are gone.
   ``We will go to the desert if crisis comes,'' he said. ``There
will always be a Bedouin way.''
   His 17-year-old son, wearing a Mickey Mouse T-shirt and
captivated by the television, looked doubtful.

<HEAD>ACT Scores Unchanged From Year-Ago Levels</HEAD>

   Scores on the ACT college entrance exam were
stagnant for the fifth straight year, but blacks and other
minorities continued to show gains.
   The average composite score on the ACT, the predominant college
entrance test in 28 states mainly in the Midwest and West, was 20.6
on a scale of 1-36, according to American College Testing of Iowa
City, Iowa, which administers the exam.
   The average among students taking the test in 1989-90 was
unchanged from the previous year and has shown virtually no
movement in five years, ACT said Monday.
   The 817,096 students who took the exam last year were given a
new version, and therefore results were not directly comparable to
previous years. But ACT officials calculated that the 1990 scores
and the 1989 averages were unchanged.
   The scores offered school critics fresh evidence that nearly a
decade of reform has brought little genuine improvement.
   Two weeks ago, the College Board, which sponsors the SAT, the
predominant college entrance test in the 22 other states, reported
scores on the verbal section had sunk to their lowest levels in a
decade, and math scores were unchanged for the fourth straight year.
   ACT spokeswoman Patricia Farrant stressed in an interview that
``reform changes take a certain amount of time'' to show up in test
scores.
   ACT officials also insisted that the public should take heart
from the fact that 45 percent of students taking the test in 1990
took a solid core curriculum in high school, compared with 36
percent in 1987.
   Students taking at least four years of English,and three or more
years of math, social studies and science averaged 22.3 on the
exam. Students taking less than that amount of coursework averaged
19.1.
   The ACT also found strong year-to-year gains among virtually all
minority groups.
   Blacks' average scores rose 0.4 points to 17.0. Mexican
Americans scored 18.3, up 0.2. American Indians and Alaskan Natives
averaged 18.0, up 0.5.
   Puerto Ricans and other Hispanics scored 19.3, unchanged from
the previous year but up 0.3 from 1986.
   By contrast, white students averaged 21.2, or 0.1 lower than a
year ago and down 0.3 from 1986.
   The ACT is a four-part exam testing English, math, reading and
scientific reasoning.
   Both the SAT and ACT are supposed to test a student's readiness
for college. But the ACT is generally considered a broader test of
high school mastery.
   The new version of the ACT included new measures of writing
ability, new advanced math questions and a new reading test
stressing reasoning skills. The SAT also is being revised, for 1993.
   ACT officials have consistently declined to release
state-by-state test data, arguing it would invite inaccurate
comparisons. The College Board issues a similar caution each year
but nonetheless releases such data.

   Americans are finding down-home ways to rally around the flag.
But uneasiness over the prospect of a Persian Gulf oil war is
generating rumblings of protest.
   An ex-Marine in Virginia is mailing gift packs to troops in the
Persian Gulf. A North Carolina farmer mowed a giant ``U S A'' into
his bean field. An Indiana woman with three sons in the 82nd
Airborne Division founded Mothers Against Saddam Hussein, or MASH.
   On the other hand, 700 marchers in Seattle this weekend chanted:
``Hell, no, we won't go, we won't fight for Texaco.''
   ``There is a national consensus for now, but I think it's
thin,'' says Robert Karl Madoff, director of the Center for War,
Peace and the News Media at New York University. ``There's a sense
of foreboding. Bush stuck a stick into a hornet's nest.''
   When it comes to backing U.S. soldiers in the merciless Arabian
desert, David Heard of Manassas, Va., says color him ``true blue.''
   He and his wife, Jean, have started Operation Something From
Home with donations from around the country. Packages to soliders
include gum, Lifesavers candy, lip balm, liquid soap, playing
cards, dominoes, letters from school kids, Kleenex and toilet paper.
   ``They'll perform a lot better knowing the country is behind
them and that no rotten vegetables will be thrown at them when they
return home,'' said Heard, 55, a veteran of Korea and Vietnam who
has two sons serving in the Persian Gulf and a daughter and
son-in-law on active duty in Europe.
   Anna Goodwin of New Castle, Ind., has three sons in the 82nd
Airborne. She founded MASH as a support group for families who have
sons and daughters in the Middle East.
   Tom Herring, 51, sowed his feelings with a flag-bedecked
tractor. He carved ``U S A'' in a 75-by-300-foot patch to salute
pilots flying from Pope Air Force Base near Fayetteville, N.C.
``I'd like to take every inch of that dirt and shove it down
Saddam's throat,'' he said.
   How long the national mood remains steadfast is another matter
as America's attention is diverted to baseball stretch drives, the
opening of football season and the return to school.
   Blitzkrieg has turned to sitzkrieg while a U.N. embargo tries to
make Saddam back down in Kuwait. It could take months to wreck
Iraq's war-hardened economy.
   That's time for the U.S. economy to sputter, for gas and heating
oil prices to rise and for the price tag on Operation Desert Shield
to mount while the country presses it allies to pay their fair
share.
   The administration's line in the first post-Cold War crisis came
from Secretary of State James A. Baker: ``Stand firm, be patient
and remain united so that together we can show that aggression does
not pay.''
   But some on the Republican right urged caution. When President
Bush said ``our way of life'' was threatened, some saw it not as a
reference to democracy but to big cars and air conditioning.
   ``There are lots of things worth fighting for, but an extra 10
cents for a gallon of gas isn't one of them,'' wrote columnist
Patrick Buchanan. He said a war with Iraq ``has quagmire written
all over it.''
   Conservative Tom Bethell of the American Spectator wrote: ``It
is hard to understand why Americans are supposed to become outraged
_ and pay more at the pump _ because Kuwait's oil is now controlled
by a tyrant in a military uniform rather than oligarchs in
traditional attire.''
   The Nation magazine, a bellwether of liberal thought, called the
U.S. deployment ``naked imperial intervention'' and compared the
policy to ``many of Hollywood's disappointed summer blockbusters
that started out big but shriveled after a few weeks.''
   Elsewhere, the pulse of patriotism is strong. Students at Daniel
Webster Elementary School in Logan, Ind., wrote 4,000 messages to
mail to soldiers. One said: ``Everyone loves you. We hope you won't
have to fight. Be careful.''
   JoAnn McGrath has made 3,000 red, white and blue bows for folks
living near Fort Leonard Wood, Mo. KRST-FM in Albuquerque, N.M.,
adorned its billboards with a giant yellow ribbon for U.S. hostages
in the Mideast.
   There were different signs that the standoff may be a long one.
   The USO will have comic Jay Leno entertain troops at
Thanksgiving. ``We're all seeing that the enemy the troops are
fighting right now is boredom and loneliness,'' said Kevin
McCarthy, executive producer for the USO.
   Meanwhile, a peace vigil has entered its third week at a Seattle
park. Participants have replaced each other in shifts since Aug.
26, and organizers say the vigil will go on until a peaceful
solution is achieved.

<TEXT>
   AL-KHARJ, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Waves of grain that will
eventually provide U.S. soldiers with bread spring from the same
scorching reclaimed desert the troops were sent to protect.
   Saudi tomatoes, on the other hand, have it easier: they are
pampered in air-conditioned greenhouses.
   Agriculture experts say Saudi Arabia's drive to food
self-sufficiency is being pushed even harder by the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   Saudi Arabia, with annual rainfall averaging 4 inches, produces
all its own wheat and most of its milk and vegetables. ``It's an
amazing thing that they have done,'' said one Western diplomat.
   The kingdom is confident it can retain its position as the
world's sixth largest wheat exporter despite the loss of markets in
Iraq and Kuwait. The two countries bought 450,000 tons annually. In
all, Saudi Arabia exports 1.9 million tons to 42 countries.
   ``It won't hurt,'' said Mohammed Al-Basher, deputy director
general of the Grain Silos and Flour Mills Organization. ``To sell
Saudi wheat is not difficult.''
   The once desolate land that produced 3,000 tons of wheat in 1975
is expected to yield 3.2 million tons this year.
   Critics charge that the project hemorrhages cash and guzzles
water from under the desert at a rate that will dry up the precious
resource.
   However, government officials say the quantity of food grown and
its distribution mean any Iraqi attempt to attack one region or
blockade food imports could not interrupt supplies.
   ``We don't need to buy food in an emergency,'' said Al-Basher.
   An extremely costly subsidy program underwrote the achievement.
   Interest-free loans up to $5 million or more are available to
purchase land, machinery and irrigation equipment.
   The dairy herd you want is in Holland? No problem, the
government will pay for the shipping.
   ``Basically, farming is a license to make money,'' said another
Western diplomat, speaking like his colleague on condition of
anonymity.
   The government buys all the wheat produced for $400 per ton from
large corporate farms and $533 per ton from smaller producers. That
same ton sells for about $186 on world markets.
   The wheat milled into flour goes at the bargain-basement rate of
$117 per ton. Caterers supplying the estimated 100,000 U.S. troops
in Saudi Arabia buy their supplies from the government.
   The 1990 budget allocated almost $2 billion for subsidies, most
of that for agriculture.
   The government started to gently apply the brakes on subsidies
during the oil price drop of the late 1980s. It would like to see
production gradually concentrate less on wheat and more on crops
like flowers and vegetables, government officials say.
   But wheat still accounts for more than 65 percent of
agricultural production.
   While petrodollars were producing huge cash reserves, everyone
supported the agricultural development idea, said Omar S. Bagour, a
professor of economics at Abdul Aziz University in Jiddah.
   ``Now we are asking if we should have done it on such a massive
scale, whether this was the best approach.''
   Critics worry that the center pivot method of irrigation will
suck underground aquifers dry within 15 years. They think drip
techniques would be preferable to the trundling sprinklers that
allow so much to evaporate.
   Diplomats say the subsidy program will never be eliminated
because it was a political rather than an economic decision from
the beginning.
   It helped spread the kingdom's wealth in the central Najd
region, which had neither the oil deposits of the east nor the
trade and annual income from the vast Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca in
the west.
   The program also keeps the countryside populated in a country
bigger than Western Europe. Although most of the laborers, like
everywhere in Saudi Arabia, are Asians, the subsidies have even
tempted Bedouins to settle down.
   Among other projects, the subsidies spawned the largest dairy
farm in the world at Al-Kharj, 54 miles south of the capital,
Riyadh.
   The cows are sprayed with a fine mist most of the day, because
duping them into thinking they are in some drizzly northern climate
brings forth more milk.
   The 115-degree temperatures outside would curdle the milk within
hours. But a special cooling system on the high-tech farm keeps the
milk around 37 degrees as it is processed.
   Cucumbers and tomatoes grow in greenhouses that cover more than
an acre each. The windows are whitewashed, and air conditioners
blow cool air. Crop yields are about three times what they were in
the fields.
   The agriculture projects are widely viewed as a miracle in the
kingdom.
   Flying overhead, the harsh landscape is suddenly interrupted by
mile after mile of green.
   The sight is known to be a special favorite of the king.
   Said one diplomat: ``He's made the desert bloom _ at a price.
But it's a price he can afford, so why not?''

   With aid finally arriving and
fewer people crossing the Iraqi border, officials say they may be
turning a corner in this desolate refugee camp _ at least for now.
   Tens of thousands of destitute Asians and Egyptians are still
stuck in baking, dusty refugee camps throughout Jordan, with an
estimated 500,000 reported waiting to cross the border from Iraq.
   But after nearly three weeks of dealing with overwhelming
numbers, officials at the largest and most notorious of three
border camps said Monday that the number of residents had tapered
off.
   About 30,000 were at Shaalan I on Monday, compared with 45,000
late last week. And Jordanian officials say the ratio of arrivals
to departures from the border area has improved.
   Hundreds of thousands of refugees have crossed the Iraq-Jordan
border at the nearby Ruweishid checkpoint since Saddam Hussein's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 _ and more than 110,000 are stranded
in Jordan as attempts are made to get them transportation home.
   Most have been forced to make do in Shaalan I and the two other
squalid camps between the Jordanian and Iraqi checkpoints. They
wait up to two weeks to return to the home countries they left to
seek a better life in Kuwait.
   The International Organization for Migration said in Geneva on
Monday there are still 500,000 foreigners who want to leave Iraq _
so the refugee situation in Jordan could rapidly deteriorate with a
massive influx.
   Still, relief officials have had a respite from the chaos of
those first weeks.
   ``It is five or six times better than before,'' said Dr. Almadin
Azim, a physician at Shaalan I. ``In the beginning, you're not
ready to do all the things they ask of you.''
   Azim said he is still without medicines to treat the 60 to 70
scorpion stings that occur each night. There is also a shortage of
antibiotics for those allergic to penicillin.
   ``We need blankets, tents, milk,'' said Kriam Al-Hadid, the Red
Crescent official in charge at the camp. ``All the world must help
us.''
   Even more crucial is transportation. Most of the refugees are
stuck where they are because officials simply don't have enough
vehicles to move them.
   The International Organization for Migration said ``the
situation looks more optimistic'' a week after the start of an
airlift and a worldwide appeal for aid.
   But it said the aid was still insufficient.
   Pledged contributions of $30 million have enabled the agency to
schedule 107 flights that would repatriate more than 31,500
stranded people over the next 10 days, it said.
   On Monday, more than 10,000 people had crossed the border into
Jordan by 6 p.m. And 8,000 people had left, the official news
agency Petra said.
   Those figures compared favorably with last week, when arrivals
far outnumbered departures.
   Al-Haddid said there have been three births and one death from
natural causes since the camp opened almost three weeks ago.
   There were noticeably fewer people in the camp Monday than last
week.
   Many of their makeshift tents had been replaced by a sea of
aqua-colored plastic water bottles and other debris mingling with
the ochre dust stirred up by motor vehicles and desert whirlwinds.
   Several thousand had been moved down the road to a camp called
Rahima, Arabic for mercy.
   Tents were set up there for 5,000 to 6,000 people and more
shelters were en route, said Jim Nuttal, coordinator for Save The
Children.
   Nuttal said aid from the Jordanian government had improved.
   ``Right now, it's enough. We've got enough water. Everybody's
being fed,'' he said.
   At Azraq, 125 miles to the southwest toward Amman, a new camp is
being erected to replace another that was moved because it
threatened the capital's water supply.
   Workers sweated to complete a tent city there with a
high-pressure water pipe connected to the Amman-Azraq line. It will
be a temporary home to 30,000 people, many of whom now are at
Ruweishid.
   ``This is a camp. There it's just a gathering of people,'' said
Yves Etienne, a Red Cross engineer supervising construction of a
water tank.
   And how long would the refugees be housed at Azraq, he was asked.
   ``Only Allah knows,'' he answered.

<HEAD>Arab League Move Deepens Regional Split Over Iraqi Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab foreign ministers and senior officials
are moving the Arab League's headquarters from Tunisia to Cairo, a
move that signals a deepening of existing regional divisions.
   The decision was approved Monday by 12 of the league's 21
members _ the same majority that at an Arab summit earlier this
month condemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq and its supporters, including the Palestine Liberation
Organization, boycotted Monday's meeting.
   Iraq said it would not abide by the decision, indicating a
further split between Baghdad and its supporters and Egypt and the
11 Arab states that back the transfer.
   ``I have faith that the return of the headquarters to its site
in Cairo is necessary to maintain the role and essence of the Arab
League,'' Egyptian Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid said in his
message opening the meeting.
   ``Egypt will cooperate and coordinate with all Arab friends and
will continue the effort to keep the Arab League a home for all
Arabs at all times, based on its conviction that the league is
above all passing conflicts among the Arab states.''
   The message was read by Osama el-Baz, the deputy foreign
minister. Abdel-Meguid was unable to attend the session because of
minor injuries suffered during a car crash Friday.
   The league said its major departments would move by Oct. 31 from
the Tunisian capital of Tunis to its old site in Cairo. It said
other departments should be moved from Tunis to Cairo by Dec. 31.
   Announcement of the relocation is a formality to complement a
decision made in March in Tunis at a regular meeting of the Arab
League council.
   The league headquarters was transfered from Cairo to the
Tunisian capital in 1979 in retaliation for Egypt's signing of the
Camp David peace treaty with Israel.
   Egypt's membership in the Arab League was reinstated in 1989,
about a year after most Arab counties resumed diplomatic ties with
Cairo. Relations had been severed in reaction to Camp David.
   The Arab League's attempt to project Arab unity was shattered
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Egypt, Morocco and Syria sent
troops to Saudi Arabia to help defend it against possible Iraqi
attack, and most Persian Gulf nations condemned the seizure of
oil-rich Kuwait.
   But other nations, including neighboring Jordan and the PLO, did
not join the criticism. Pro-Iraqi demonstrations have been held in
Yemen, Tunisia, Mauritania, Libya, Jordan and the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   The nine Arab states or organizations that boycotted Monday's
meeting were: Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Mauritania, the PLO,
Sudan, Tunisia and Yemen.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Tokyo, Stocks Dip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen in
Tokyo Tuesday, while share prices fell in moderate trading.
   The dollar closed at 139.85 yen, 0.42 yen above Monday's finish.
After opening at 140.05 yen, the U.S. currency ranged between
139.55 and 140.25 yen.
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell
476.24 points, or 1.90 percent, to 24,604.66. An estimated 400
million shares were traded on the market's first section. On
Monday, the Nikkei index advanced 1,118.83 points in its sixth
largest daily gain.
   On the bond market, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds jumped to 8.365 percent from Monday's
close of 8.225 percent. Their price fell to 82.01 from 82.57.
   Traders said the Nikkei index slid mostly due to the yen's fall
against the dollar, as well as a fall in the price of government
bonds.
   ``First was the yen exchange rate. Second, bonds got cheaper,''
said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst at Nomura Securities.
   Profit-taking after Monday's big gain and the overnight rise in
oil prices also were factors in the falling stock market, traders
said.
   On the currency market, the U.S. unit regained strength in Tokyo
as Japanese investors started selling the yen to make up their
oversold dollar positions following recent substantial selling,
said Akiko Baba, a customer dealer with the Bank of Tokyo.
   She noted the overnight hike in oil prices in New York also
encouraged the dollar's strength, but added, ``The dollar's
increase is just a temporary move as part of technical adjustments,
because there are more negative elements to encourage dollar
selling than buying.''
   Ms. Baba said there is a growing market expectation that the
U.S. Federal Reserve Board will ease its monetary policy to cope
with a slowdown in the U.S. economy, a factor that would encourage
dollar selling.

<TEXT>
   Five more legislators and a former
representative who is now a judge have been implicated in a
Statehouse scandal in which three of five lawmakers previously
indicted have pleaded guilty to selling their votes.
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel filed court papers Monday that said
the six conspired to obtain money for their votes on a bill that
would legalize dog and horse racing. The bill was never put to a
final vote.
   None of the six has been charged, although they have
acknowledged being questioned by the FBI in connection with the
16-month investigation.
   All six are black. Some blacks, including Democratic
gubernatorial nominee Theo Mitchell, have questioned why so many
blacks have been implicated.
   ``Certainly it's a disproportionate number of black legislators
that were targeted,'' he said last month. Nineteen of the
Legislature's 170 members are black. Four of the five lawmakers
indicted in August are white.
   The U.S. attorney has strongly denied any racial motivation.
   During the investigation, FBI agents videotaped lawmakers taking
cash from lobbyist Ron Cobb, a former House member working
undercover for the FBI.
   Named as conspirators Monday were: Democratic Reps. Larry
Blanding of Sumter, James Faber of Eastover, Ennis Fant of
Greenville, B.J. Gordon of Kingstree, and Frank McBride of
Columbia. Also named was Circuit Judge Tee Ferguson, a former
Democratic House member from Spartanburg. He was suspended from
hearing cases.
   Also Monday, former Sen. Rick Lee, a Republican from Boiling
Springs, pleaded guilty to a bribery charge. Last week, former
Reps. Robert Brown, D-Marion, and Danny Winstead, R-Charleston,
entered similar pleas.
   No sentencing date has been set.
   Lee faces up to 20 years in prison, as do Brown and Robert Kohn,
a Republican from Charleston who has pleaded innocent. Winstead
faces 30 years.
   The fifth lawmaker indicted last month, Luther Taylor, a
Democrat from Columbia, faces 120 years.
   The filings Monday came in response to a request by Taylor's
attorney that prosecutors list the unidentified conspirators
referred to in the indictment against him.
   In the papers, Daniel also said Taylor took $2,800 from Cobb in
1988 and 1989 for voting to uphold a $2.8 million computer contract
won by National Advance System with Clemson University. The final
payment of $300 was filmed by the FBI, the papers said.
   Daniel said Taylor is on videotape saying that payment of
legislators has been business-as-usual for years. Taylor has not
been charged in the computer case, but Daniel argued that evidence
about the case should be admitted in court.

<HEAD>Time Stands Still as Beijing Awaits Asian Games</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bitter memories linger, but the scars of tank
treads and bullet holes have been patched up as Beijing residents
await the Asian Games.
   China remains, as always, the center of its own universe.
   Daily news broadcasts bring alarming reports from the Persian
Gulf that barely seem to touch this city of 10 million. There is no
stock market to plummet; no troops are being sent.
   Visitors to Beijing find the city at its best. Old apartment
blocks and courtyard houses facing the streets have been plastered
over and painted.
   Pink rose bushes and shrubs have been planted in preparation for
the Sept. 22-Oct. 7 Asian Games.
   Crimson banners proclaim: ``Warm welcome to our guests.''
   Beijing citizens have been instructed to kill pet and stray dogs
to reduce the risk of rabies and keep the city clean.
   Stern-looking men and women in yellow hats and red armbands are
stationed on street corners for bicycle traffic control and to
discourage littering and spitting _ a prevalent habit in this dusty
city _ with the threat of 5 yuan ($1) fines.
   There are few physical reminders of the violence of the spring
of 1989, when hundreds of unarmed civilians were killed as the
military cleared central Beijing of pro-democracy demonstrators.
   A year ago, the city was still subdued and foreign tourists
scarce. Soldiers armed with automatic rifles stood ominously at
major intersections and in the diplomatic quarters.
   The rifles have disappeared. This year, Beijing's posh
international hotels are filling up with foreign business
executives and tourists.
   Beijing in late summer seems a city suspended in time.
   ``No one expects anything to happen, no top leaders are likely
to drop from favor or die until the Asian Games are well out of the
way,'' said one Western diplomat.
   But the appearance of calm on twilight sidewalks crowded with
card players and watermelon vendors masks deep political
undercurrents.
   Video surveillance cameras stare down on evening strollers,
discouraging all but the most businesslike contacts between
foreigners and Chinese.
   ``You should never quote a Chinese person by name,'' one Chinese
journalist told a Western reporter. ``It's just too dangerous for
them.''
   Intellectuals ask foreign friends to call from public phones or
to just drop in to help skirt surveillance.
   ``Things look like they have improved,'' said one researcher.
``But for many of us, they are still pretty bad.''
   Despite a few gestures aimed at restoring its international
image, such as lifting martial law in Beijing and allowing
dissident astrophysicist Fang Lizhi to leave his year-long refuge
in the U.S. Embassy to travel abroad, the political noose is still
tight.
   The media is tightly controlled. Writers and artists must have
``a firm belief that only socialism can save China. ...''
propaganda official He Jingzhi said in a recent speech.
   A steady stream of local reports blames rising crime rates and
materialism on ``unhealthy Western influences.''
   The Communist Party refuses to budge from one-party rule,
although leaders acknowledge that they must stem widespread
corruption and improve living conditions to reclaim public support.
   The Asian Games _ aimed so clearly at repairing China's
tarnished image abroad _ appear to have done little to enhance the
government's image at home.
   A resident of one crumbling compound hidden by a fancy new gray
plaster wall called the renovation a ``sham.''
   Longtime foreign residents of Beijing say the leadership's
obsession with the Asian Games has done little to win public
support among residents who were asked to make ``contributions'' to
the $53 million fund needed to stage the games.
   ``We have a bad government,'' said one Chinese salesman. ``We're
poor, but they took even more money away from us to pay for the
Asian Games. It doesn't do us any good.''
   The government has tightened security in the city to gird
against possible terrorist attacks or protests by students and
workers seeking to take advantage of the large foreign presence
during the Asian Games.
   Some taxi drivers said they had stopped working nights because
they didn't like being stopped by police.
   Few observers expect the public, memories of last year's
violence still sharp, to be defiant.
   But glimmers of hope remain.
   ``Chinese people are very patient. They know that their
experiences helped the revolutions in Eastern Europe and they are
just waiting to see what will happen next,'' said one intellectual.
   ``There's alot of suspense,'' said one young Chinese man. ``You
just have to wait and see. In a way, it's exciting.''

<HEAD>Chicago Suburb Approves Nation's First College Tuition Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLIFF EDWARDS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The City Council in this Chicago suburb
has approved the nation's first tax on college tuition, voting to
charge students at Northwestern University and three other schools
up to $60 a year.
   Mayor Joan Barr immediately said she will veto the measure, and
Northwestern threatened to take the city to court.
   ``I do not believe Evanston should be the very first community
in the United States to tax education,'' the mayor said. ``Evanston
has always taken pride in its educational excellence.''
   The measure was approved 10-8 Monday night to make up for the
property taxes from which the schools are exempt and to give tax
relief to homeowners who saw higher bills in this community of
73,000 because of reassessment last year.
   The council could override a veto by a two-thirds vote.
   The tax of $15 per semester _ or per quarter, depending on how
the school's academic year is set up _ would generate an estimated
$500,000 a year toward the city's budget, which totaled $77.3
million in 1990-91, officials said.
   The measure would apply to three other schools _ Kendall
College, Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary and
Seabury-Western Theological Seminary.
   But the debate Monday centered on Northwestern and its
unwillingness to pay the city for police and fire protection. The
university has its own security force but occasionally asks for
assistance from Evanston police.
   ``All we are asking for is a basic principle, and that is a fair
share,'' said Alderman Jack Korshak, who proposed the measure.
``Five dollars a month. Each of you can judge for yourself the
extent to which this represents an insuperable burden to a
student.''
   University President Arnold Weber argued Northwestern students
couldn't handle the extra $60 because more than half already
receive extensive financial aid. Most of the school's nearly 10,500
students are undergraduates who pay tuition of $13,725 a year.
   Weber called the tax ``anti-education'' and ``anti-business''
and said it would destroy the relationship between the city and its
educational institutions. Northwestern, which owns 242 of the 5,400
acres in the community, has said it is typical for such
institutions to be exempt from property taxes.
   ``We have focused on Northwestern _ the big, the bad, and
apparently, the ugly,'' said Alderman David Nelson, who voted
against the tax. ``There are apparently going to be others caught
up in the maelstrom.''
   Northwestern officials have promised a court fight. They have
pointed out that the school brings about 500,000 visitors a year to
the city, pumps millions of dollars into the local economy and adds
many cultural advantages.
   No other U.S. city has a tuition tax, said Sheldon E. Steinbach,
vice president and general counsel of the American Council on
Education in Washington. The council represents 1,500 colleges and
universities nationwide.
   Bob Goritz, an Evanston resident and a lawyer, argued the tax
would not stand up in court.
   ``No matter what verbiage you put on the measure, it's a tax on
the occupation of being a student,'' he said. ``All you're going to
buy yourself is about five years of litigation that will result in
this being overturned.''

<HEAD>Chileans Charge U.S. Officials Contaminated Grapes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chilean Exporters Association is accusing
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of contaminating two Chilean
grapes with cyanide and setting off a public health scare in March
1989.
   A report issued by the association in Washington and Santiago,
Chile, concluded that, based on scientific studies, the grapes
could not have been tampered with in Chile or at the port of
Philadelphia where the poisoned grapes were found.
   ``The grapes were contaminated at the FDA laboratory in
Philadelphia,'' the report said. ``The manner in which the
contamination took place could have been accidental or
intentional.''
   FDA officials have said repeatedly that they believe the grapes
were poisoned in Chile before the ship left on its two-week voyage
to the United States.
   Of the report's conclusion, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said: ``We
think that's preposterous.''
   The FDA went looking for the grapes after the U.S. Embassy in
Santiago received an anonymous telephone threat March 2, 1989.
After it found the two tainted grapes, the FDA urged that all
Chilean fruit be removed from U.S. markets while more tests
continued.
   The association estimated the FDA's action cost the Chileans
more than $330 million as more than 6 million cases of fruit in the
United States were destroyed.
   The association said research at the University of California at
Davis showed that if the two grapes had been contaminated with
cyanide, other grapes in the same case also would have contained
the poison. However, none was found, the FDA has said.
   The studies also showed that because cyanide was found at such
high levels, it would have to have been introduced in the grapes
more recently than two weeks before, when the ship was in Chile,
the report said.

   UPI Confirms Bureau Closings In Three States

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International is closing its
bureaus in New Mexico, Wyoming and Montana, says a spokesman for
the news service.
   Spokesman Milt Capps confirmed on Monday a report on the
closures in The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune, but declined to specify
how many layoffs were involved.
   The Tribune said UPI's single-person bureau in Santa Fe was
closing on Sept. 21 as part of shutdowns in the three states. Capps
said the newspaper's account was ``essentially correct as far as it
goes.'' He said UPI would not, however, be leaving the three states
uncovered.
   ``We are expanding our stringer network in those states and
exploring a number of joint ventures at the state and regional
level,'' Capps said.
   Last month Capps confirmed a Washington Post report that 31 UPI
reporters and editors were being laid off, but he declined Monday
to provide an up-to-date account of how many have lost their jobs
nationwide.

   The dollar rose strongly in European trading this
morning, pushing through an important support level against the
German mark.
   Gold prices were sharply lower.
   The dollar closed in Tokyo at 139.85 yen, 0.42 yen above
Monday's finish. Later, in London, it was quoted at 140.32 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.5910 German marks, up from 1.5808
   _1.3290 Swiss francs, up from 1.3197
   _5.3300 French francs, up from 5.2985

   _1,187.00 Italian lire, up from 1,180.50
   _1.1670 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1703
   In London, the British pound was quoted at 1.8430 dollars,
compared with 1.8565 dollars late Monday.
   Traders in Milan, Italy, said the dollar's rise above 1.5900
marks was important but they doubted whether the U.S. currency had
the underlying strength to move past 1.600 marks.
   Dealers added that uncertainty about the Gulf crisis had lately
encouraged some dollar buying.
   Despite the U.S. currency's rise, ``people are still thinking
the trend is to go lower,'' said Masato Hayashi of the Bank of
Tokyo.
   In gold trading, London's major bullion dealers fixed a
recommended price of $378.40 at midmorning, down from $384.75
Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $378.60, down from $387.00 late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped $4.90 an ounce today, to close at

<TEXT>
   A Cuban exile who had been a fugitive for 12
years has pleaded guilty to conspiring to murder former Chilean
Ambassador Orlando Letelier by helping bomb the ex-diplomat's car.
   Jose Dionisio Suarez Esquivel, a member of the Cuban Nationalist
Movement, admitted in federal court Monday that he gave a blasting
cap to former Chilean intelligence agent Michael V. Townley, who
pleaded guilty to building the bomb that killed Letelier and an
associate on Sept. 21, 1976.
   Letelier, an outspoken critic of the right-wing military
government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, and the associate, Ronni
Moffitt, died after the bomb exploded beneath Letelier's car on
Embassy Row.
   Letelier had been his country's ambassador to Washington from
1971 to 1973. He also served briefly as foreign minister in the
leftist government of President Salvador Allende, who died in a
bloody military coup that overthrew his government in 1973.
   Two top military officials, including the head of the Chilean
intelligence agency, DINA, have been charged with participating in
the murder. But the Chilean government, which returned to civilian
control earlier this year, has refused to extradite the officials.
   Pinochet remains head of the Chilean army and military courts
retain jurisdiction over the two officials, Gen. Juan Manuel
Contreras Sepulveda and retired Lt. Col. Pedro Espinoza Bravo, the
former head of DINA.
   Under the deal approved by U.S. District Judge Aubrey E.
Robinson Jr., Suarez, 51, who was arrested April 11 in St.
Petersburg, Fla., cannot be sentenced to more than 12 years in
prison even though the charge to which he pleaded guilty carries a
maximum life sentence.
   Prosecutors also agreed not to prosecute his wife, Elizabeth
Gongora Suarez, for concealing a fugitive from authorities.
   Suarez also admitted that he, Townley and others went to
Letelier's residence two days before the bombing knowing that
Townley was to place an explosive device on the former diplomat's
car.
   Townley, an American-born DINA agent, pleaded guilty in 1978 to
building the bomb and putting it beneath Letelier's car. He served
a 40-month prison term and has cooperated with the government's
investigation.
   Former Chilean army Maj. Armando Fernandez Larios defected in
1987 and pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to the
conspiracy. Fernandez implicated his superiors in DINA and Pinochet
in the coverup of the Chilean military's involvement in the killing.
   Fernandez and Townley had been expected to testify against
Suarez, who was scheduled to go to trial next week. The government
agreed to drop four other charges against Suarez as part of the
deal.
   Investigators believe that Suarez may have detonated the bomb
with a remote electronics device from a car that he and Virgilio
Paz Romero, still a fugitive, used to follow Letelier, said a
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Defense attorney Paul Goldberger said Suarez's primary
motivation for pleading guilty was to help his wife avoid
prosecution. ``He's got a wife and a baby,'' the lawyer said.
   If Suarez is sentenced to 12 years, he would be eligible for
release after serving nine years of the prison term, Goldberger
said.
   U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens said that Suarez would have been
eligible for parole after 10 years even if he had received a life
sentence.
   ``We believe this is a substantial disposition, given his
relative degree of culpability,'' Stephens said.
   Washington lawyer E. Lawrence Barcella, who investigated the
case as a federal prosecutor, praised the plea bargain.
   ``While I think they had a good case, and I think they would
have prevailed, it would have been a very difficult effort given
the passage of time and the vagaries of a jury,'' Barcella said.
``You simply can't tell what is going to happen.''

   Another planeload of Western hostages arrived
from Iraq, with evacuees from Kuwait telling of food shortages,
nighttime gunfire and Iraqi roundups of young people suspected of
involvement in the resistance.
   The flight arrived Monday from Baghdad via London with 164
evacuees, 90 of them children.
   ``There is no law and order,'' said Thuraya, who would not give
her last name. ``A soldier can rape a father's daughter in front of
him and he can't do anything about it. And that is what really is
scary. You don't know if a soldier is going to crawl over your wall
at 5 o'clock in the morning.''
   Thuraya, 19, said people in their late teens and 20s are being
rounded up under suspicion they are part of the resistance movement.
   Those who talked Monday at Baltimore-Washington International
Airport did not want to be identified by their full names for fear
of retaliation against their families in Kuwait. About 20 of the
hostages were not U.S. citizens.
   One woman kissed the ground upon arriving. ``This is America, my
home,'' said Diane, who is headed for Milford, Conn., where she has
family.
   She brought along her 4-year-old son, but her Kuwaiti husband
chose to stay behind.
   She said fresh food is nonexistent. People have been reduced to
eating staples, such as rice, lentils, sugar and bread. At night
there is gunfire between the resistance and Iraqi soldiers, Diane
said.
   ``You can't leave the house,'' she said. ``The Iraqis are
destroying everything.''
   An exhausted Philadelphia woman, who was visiting her brother
and was trapped by the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion, said Kuwait is a ``a
ghost town.''
   ``Everything is broken down. They (the Iraqis) stole everything.
Supermarkets, there is no food,'' said Angel.
   Angel said Kuwaitis fear electricity and water will be shut off.
They are waiting for the United States to take some action.
   Angel said she went into hiding for five weeks after the
invasion. ``I could not even go to the window,'' she said.
   The evacuees were part of a group of 438 who arrived in London
on Sunday night after a 6{-hour flight from Baghdad.
   Debbie Edelen Hadi, of Louisville, Ky., said she escaped Kuwait
because U.S. Embassy officials there managed to smuggle her into a
group of 170 women and children of various nationalities who left
the country last week.
   She declined to provide more details of her escape ``because
there are others that we're trying to get out and we don't want to
jeopardize them.''
   Rene Hariri, a native of Rossville, Ind., was among more than
300 U.S. evacuees who landed Sunday at Charleston, S.C. She gave
birth Sept. 2 to a boy and left Kuwait with her other sons, ages 4
and 2, but left behind her husband.
   In Baghdad, Iraqi soldiers demanded travel documents for the
newborn, and Hariri, 33, worried she'd be separated from her
children.
   ``I guess I stupidly remained somehow confident that it really
wasn't going to happen, and it didn't,'' she said.

   A man accused of using a bow and arrow
to kill a poodle he caught rooting through his trash was fined
$2,000 and ordered to work 150 hours at the local Humane Society.
   Gary Rall, 42, also was placed on a year's probation Monday by
Judge Howard M. Fender after pleading no contest to cruelty to
animals.
   Fender specified that Rall not be allowed to put animals to
sleep.
   ``This is intended to be instructive to him,'' Fender said. ``I
don't want this to become a farce. I want to make sure he's not
involved in any dog killing at the humane society.''
   Witnesses said the postal worker shot the dog on March 12. The
animal, named Taffey, limped back to its home, where its owners
found it collapsed on the front porch, an arrow in its side. The
dog died in surgery.
   ``I can't see anything positive by sending him to jail even
though that's what we wanted at first,'' said the dog's owner,
Tommy Davis. ``Nothing's going to bring Taffey back.''
   Defense attorney William Harris said that Rall had received
death threats and that someone placed a fake bomb in his mailbox
over the incident.
   ``There's been a lot of cruelty visited on Mr. Rall as a result
of this,'' he said.

<HEAD>Reagan's Dream of Walk Through Wall Takes Place Wednesday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former President Ronald Reagan had a light
schedule in Berlin today, a day before he is to fulfill a dream of
walking through the now-crumbling Berlin Wall.
   Reagan, 79, and his wife Nancy arrived just after midnight
Monday to start a 10-day trip through Germany, Poland, the Soviet
Union and Italy.
   The Berliner Morgenpost daily greeted the Reagans with a story
recounting his speech June 12, 1987, before the wall, where he
challenged Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to ``open this
gate ... tear down this wall.''
   The wall now has been open since last November, when the
Communists then ruling East Germany, in a desperate attempt to
retain power, granted freedom of travel to its citizens. The
Communists have lost all power, and the two Germanys are to unite
into one country on Oct. 3.
   Reagan has a busy schedule Wednesday, when he is to walk through
the landmark Brandenburg Gate in the former area of the wall and
meet with democratically elected officials in East Berlin.
   He also is to give a speech Wednesday on the future of united
Germany.
   On Thursday he travels to Bonn, the West German capital, to meet
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and on Friday he is to be given a
ceremonial sendoff by U.S. military units at Tempelhof Airport in
central Berlin as he departs for Warsaw.
   Reagan was resting today after the long flight from California,
and had a dinner scheduled with Berlin community leaders in the
evening.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev went before
Parliament today and rejected the moderate economic plan his prime
minister had just presented to the body, instead endorsing a more
radical program.
   The stunning statement reflected dwindling confidence in Prime
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and put Gorbachev closer to the
position of radical reformers such as Boris N. Yeltsin.
   Yeltsin, the Russian republic president, asked the republic's
parliament last week to approve a radical reform plan drafted by
Stanislav Shatalin, a Gorbachev aide.
   Shatalin's plan would transfer enormous authority from
Parliament to the legislatures of the republics, which would then
have the power to scrap centralized economic planning, introduce
market mechanisms and legalize private property.
   Gorbachev rejected Ryzhkov's plan but said elements of it would
be combined with Shatalin's plan. He said the Shatalin program
appeals more to him because it integrates ``the ideas of
constituent republics.''
   ``If there is a real plan to stabilize finances, money
circulation, the ruble and the market, then we should adopt the
Shatalin idea,'' Gorbachev said. ``We should try and work out a
single document, and we are nearing it.''
   Gorbachev's remarks were reported by the state news agency Tass.
   He has avoided explicitly expressing a lack of confidence in
Ryzhkov, a close ally, but his statements sparked new speculation
that Ryzhkov would step down soon.
   Gorbachev said he would present a plan on Wednesday that would
be very close to the more radical plan proposed earlier by Yeltsin.
A commission with members appointed by the two men has been trying
to draft a common document for several weeks.
   Ryzhkov's speech drew fire from lawmakers in the national
legislature, and Gorbachev responded with a warning against
``shaking up all the political institutions in the country,'' Tass
said.
   ``This is unacceptable. In this case, we shall bury everything
we have achieved over these five years,'' said Gorbachev, who
became general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party in 1985.
   No prime minister in 73 years of Soviet history has been forced
to resign because parliament refused to endorse his program.
However, the Communist Party leader traditionally has been able to
force the retirement of the head of government.
   Several Russian parliamentarians rose to urge the body to call
for Ryzhkov to step down, but Yeltsin urged caution and stressed
first the adoption of the Shatalin plan by the legisatures of the
national and the republic governments.
   Ryzhkov's proposal today differed little from one tossed back at
him for reworking last spring.
   ``There is no principal difference. It's centralized leadership,
centralized prices, it's not possible to sell land,'' said Estonian
economist and legislator Siim Kallas.
   Leningrad mayor and national legislator Anatoly Sobchak on
Monday called for a vote of no-confidence in Ryzhkov, charging he
was unable to offer a realistic solution to the country's economic
crisis.
   The impasse increases the forces pulling the Soviet Union apart,
with 13 of the 15 republics already pressing for independence or
sovereignty.
   Shatalin said he expected his plan to be approved by the Russian
parliament. Since Russia is the largest republic by far, with three
quarters of the Soviet Union's land and half its population,
conflicting decisions by the Russian and Soviet governments would
be impossible to ignore.
   Shatalin, in an interview with the Interfax news agency, said
the central government would not support his plan because it would
undercut Kremlin power.
   ``There has never been a government in the entire world that
would voluntarily give up power and land,'' he said.
   The plan also calls for superiority of republics' laws over
national ones.
   Ryzkhov sharply criticized the Shatalin plan, saying it would
lower the living standard by 30 percent and force one of every four
collective farms into bankruptcy.
   He said only 25 percent of basic consumer products would remain
price-controlled under the Shatalin plan.
   Soviet studies have found that less than 10 percent of 2,000
everyday products are readily available in stores.
   The Ryzhkov plan called for a much slower transition to a market
economy. The latest version drops a controversial proposal to
double and triple the price of food, but retains drastic price
increases set for Jan. 1 for expensive consumer goods like
televisions, radios and refrigerators.
   Ryzkkov said the economic situation was worsening rapidly. He
said Western banks were growing reluctant to lend more hard
currency to the Soviet Union.

   Firefighters working in rugged
terrain today battled a brush fire, apparently started by target
shooters, that damaged five million-dollar homes and forced the
evacuation of about 175 people.
   Aided by parched undergrowth and stiff coastal winds, the blaze
had charred more than 2,640 acres and was 35 percent contained by
early today, the California Department of Forestry reported.
   The fire, which began about noon Monday, is believed to have
been started by target shooters at an illegal shooting site off a
back road, said department spokeswoman Audrey Hagen. A fire can
start when a bullet hits a rock and sets off a spark that ignites
dry brush, the department said.
   It quickly burned across canyons and hillsides about 30 miles
north of downtown San Diego, forcing overnight evacuations of homes
south of Escondido. Volunteers brought trailers to help evacuate
about 50 horses and other animals.
   ``I have never seen a fire going down a hill so fast,'' Ruth
Preston said as she watched firefighters protecting her hilltop
home. ``They told us they didn't think the fire would reach us,
that we didn't have anything to worry about, but then the fire
chief told us there was a wall of fire coming up and we that we had
to get out of there.''
   Forestry Department spokeswoman Carol Stein said the blaze still
threatened barns, sheds and maybe some homes, but officials
estimated the fire would be contained by evening and residents were
expected to be allowed back today.
   More than 600 firefighters on the ground, including inmates, set
back fires and bulldozed fire breaks to prevent the blaze from
reaching more populated areas and Interstate 15.
   Three helicopters and six air tankers dropped water and
retardant until the aircraft were grounded for the night.
   ``The difficulties of fighting this were the terrain was
extremely steep and inaccessible and it had very heavy fuel,''
firefighter Chris Fall said. ``This particular area had not burned
in 20 or 30 years and the brush was 6 feet thick.''
   Four homes sustained scorched roofs or other minor damage, and
the roof of a fifth home collapsed, Stein said. Three vehicles also
were burned.
   The lone reported injury was to a firefighter, who suffered a
knee injury, officials said.
   Trish Demopoulos, who also had to flee her hilltop home, said,
``Living in this area, we know there's always fire hazards, but you
think it will happen to everybody else, not you. This brings it
pretty close to reality.''

   Got a cellular phone, dude? Better check it in at
the counter.
   Theaters, restaurants and other businesses are increasingly
banning the portable phones, as customers complain of the impolite
user.
   ``They say they need them. Suddenly everyone's a doctor,'' said
manager Fredd Selgas of the Coconut Grove Playhouse, where patrons
are urged to check their phones at the door.
   Complaints about people taking calls in the middle of movies led
to a ban on the phones at all 18 Florida theaters owned by Wometco.
   ``Let's face it,'' said Wometco general manager John Wray.
``You're in the middle of a tense love scene and someone's phone
rings, and a guy says, `Hi, sweetheart. How're you doing?'
   ``We feel that it's a disturbing effect to the patrons and, as a
courtesy, they should not bring their phones in.''
   With the use of cellular phones increasing, cities may take
legislative action. In the Florida Statehouse, the phones are
banned from Senate and House floors, as well as in the public
galleries above.
   People who do not carry cellular phones don't like them in
public places, said Sheldon Brown, a manager at BellSouth Mobility.
But people who carry them disagree.
   ``If your livelihood depends on that telephone, and that's how
you support your family, understandably you want to take that phone
with you everywhere you go,'' said BellSouth marketing director
Leslie Girolamo.
   But dealing with them is another matter, and the problem in the
future could get out of hand.
   ``It could be like smoking _ they'll have a phone section and a
non-phone section,'' said Alfonso Blanco, manager of a cellular
phone store.

<TEXT>
   A man sent to prison for setting fire
to his son in 1983 is back behind bars today on charges of
violating his parole, authorities said.
   Charles Rothenberg, 50, allegedly slipped away from a parole
agent who had been following him Monday morning. He was in San
Quentin Prison by dinner.
   He will receive a hearing within 60 days on the alleged
violation and could get up to year in prison, said Corrections
Department spokesman Tipton Kindel.
   Rothenberg was convicted of attempted murder for pouring
kerosene over his son, David, and setting him afire in a Buena Park
motel room during a dispute with his estranged wife in New York.
   The boy, then 6, was rescued by motel guests but was burned over
90 percent of his body. He was severely disfigured.
   Rothenberg served six years and five months of his 13-year
sentence before being released on three years' parole in January.
The same conviction today could bring a life sentence.
   The parolee, who described himself as ``the most-watched man in
America'' after he left prison, always had at least one parole
officer watching him. He had been living in Alameda County; the
exact location was not revealed.
   California officials called the parole the most restrictive in
state history and said it costs taxpayers $18,000 a month. Besides
the 24-hour-a-day surveillance, it also includes strict rules on
travel, weekly psychiatric counseling and other requirements.
   On Monday, Rothenberg went into an doughnut shop and apparently
snuck out through a window or back door, Kindel said.
   Rothenberg telephoned another agent to say he would go to a
scheduled job interview. He was taken into custody when he arrived
there.
   ``He's always been under surveillance and he knows that. It's
part of the program,'' Kindel said. ``Up to this point, he'd been
doing what he was supposed to do. He'd been abiding by the rules,
keeping a low profile and trying to obtain employment.''
   Rothenberg's prosecutor wasn't surprised to see him back in
prison.
   ``It was predictable with Rothenberg,'' Orange County Deputy
District Attorney Tom Avdeef said. ``It was my feeling that he
wouldn't make parole, that he would violate it in some fashion
because of his background.''
   David Rothenberg, who lives with his mother and stepfather in
Orange County, said just before his father was paroled that he kept
a BB gun by his bed. ``I'd shoot his eye out if he ever came over.
I'd blind him,'' he said.

   Twenty Moslem militants were killed when
their bus exploded during a shoot-out with a government patrol on a
lonely country road in northern India today, official sources said.
   One paramilitary policeman also died, the sources said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   When news of the deaths reached Srinagar at midday, shopkeepers
in the downtown area _ a center of the Moslem separatist movement _
closed in protest, blaming the government for the killings.
   There were no immediate statements from the Moslem groups that
have been waging a violent campaign for independence from
predominantly Hindu India.
   The military sources said a patrol party encountered the bus at
3 a.m. near Thune, about 30 miles northeast of Srinagar, 400 miles
northwest of New Delhi.
   A constable ordered the bus to halt because it was violating a
curfew that is supposed to keep all private vehicles off the roads
in Kashmir after dark, the sources said.
   Gunmen inside the bus opened fire, killing Singh instantly, and
the rest of the patrol party returned fire, the sources said.
   They said the bus exploded because it was loaded with ammunition
and hand grenades.
   Sixteen bodies were recovered from the bus and four other
militants were gunned down by the patrol when they jumped from the
burning bus, the sources said. They said there were no survivors.
   Meanwhile, at the other end of Jammu-Kashmir state, thousands of
Hindus demonstrated against the Moslem secessionist movement. The
protesters boarded buses to leave Jammu town for Srinagar late this
afternoon, but state officials said they would not be allowed to
complete their journey.
   A bomb blew up the railroad tracks near Jammu this morning just
15 minutes before the scheduled arrival of a train carrying top
leaders of the protest, officials said.
   There were no injuries, state officials said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The train, which normally carries about 1,500 people, was late.
When the bomb exploded, the high-speed express was sitting at a
station 12 miles to the south, the officials said.
   They said they did not know who was responsible for the
explosion, which was heard more than two miles away.
   Members of the Hindu group, in telephone calls to news offices
in Jammu and New Delhi, blamed Kashmiri Moslem militants who are
fighting to secede from predominantly Hindu India.
   About 1,200 people have been killed in Kashmir, the
Moslem-dominated part of Jammu-Kashmir state, since last January
when the government started its heaviest crackdown to date on the
secessionists.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people are
Moslems, making it the only Indian state with a Moslem majority.
Most of the Hindus, who comprise 32 percent of the state's
population, live in the Jammu region.
   Nationwide, 82 percent of India's 880 million people are Hindus
while Moslems account for 12 percent.

   Kent State University has recalled 4,000
mailed catalogs and will destroy 16,000 others because the cover
features hooded Ku Klux Klan members.
   Beneath the hooded and robed Klansmen the cover of the catalog,
listing books being published by the university press, bears the
message, ``Kent State University Press Celebrating 25 Years of
Excellence.''
   The fall catalog never mentions that its cover is a duplicate of
one of its offerings, ``The Steel Valley Klan _ The KKK in Ohio's
Mahoning Valley,'' a book by Youngstown State University professor
William D. Jenkins.
   The Kent State University Press publishes scholarly works and
its catalog is sent to other colleges and universities around the
nation. Its catalog cover traditionally features a cover from one
of its books.
   ``The picture on the book makes sense because it's in the proper
context,'' Kent State University president Michael Schwartz said.
   ``However, the picture is totally inappropriate on the catalog
cover,'' he said. ``I certainly apologize to anyone who was
offended. I know I certainly was. KSU has always made multicultural

<HEAD>Police In Gainesville Sifting Through 500 Clues, Using DNA Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES MARTINEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities say more than 500 pieces of
evidence collected in the killings of five college students mostly
involve a single suspect, and genetic testing is under way on blood
and semen.
   Steve Platt, head of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's
Jacksonville crime lab, indicated Monday that police were
investigating whether the slayings involved sexual assault. He
refused to say whether the blood and semen were taken from the
crime scenes or from 18-year-old Edward Lewis Humphrey.
   Humphrey is one of eight suspects but ``he's the one we've
received the most information about,'' Gainesville police
spokeswoman Sadie Darnell said. ``I think that's why early on, he's
become the focus _ rightly or wrongly _ we still don't know yet.''
   Only about half the evidence has been processed at the crime
lab, where 17 technicians are working full time on the case, Platt
said.
   ``It's a slow, painstaking effort,'' he said.
   Genetic testing is a technique first used in courtrooms in 1986
to identify people by using deoxyribonucleic acid, the unique DNA
code everyone has duplicated in their body tissue, bone, hair roots
and various bodily fluids.
   A congressional study last month found that it is reliable
courtroom evidence if proper standards are followed in the tricky
lab tests done to match DNA taken from a person or a crime scene.
   ``We're not going to let time dictate this investigation,'' said
Lt. Spencer Mann, spokesman for the Alachua County sheriff's
department. ``We have to be right. We can't guess. We can't take
chances.''
   Police repeated warnings that the killer may still be on the
loose, and said no arrests are imminent.
   Humphrey remains jailed on $1.1 million bond in the Aug. 30
beating of his grandmother, an October 1988 armed burglary and
attempted rape in Indian River County, and an Aug. 25 assault on
two male University of Florida students.
   Investigators have said a shrewd and methodical killer late last
month stabbed four young women and one young man who were students
in this college town. The killer reportedly arranged body parts at
the slaying scene for maximum shock value.
   At the students' apartments, investigators finished their
searches over the weekend and landlords were preparing to find new
tenants.
   ``We'll renovate and then we'll rent it out,'' said Carol Hyde,
manager of the Gatorwood Apartments, where the bodies of Manny
Taboada and Tracy Paules, both 23, were found Aug. 28. ``There's
still blood on the walls.''
   Ms. Hyde said she would tell prospective tenants about the
gruesome murders. But Johanna Yarborough, manager of the apartments
where the mutilated nude bodies of Christina Powell, 17, and Sonya
Larson, 18, were found Aug. 26, said: ``If somebody asks, I'll tell
them, but it's not like I'm going to say, `Oh, by the way, two
girls were murdered here.'''
   Monday also marked the last day students could drop classes.
Administrators calculated 500 left the university as a result of
the killings, but interim registrar Steve Pritz said some students
regretted their decision and want to come back for spring semester.

<HEAD>Official Says Students, Monks Stoned Police During Burma Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,000 protesters including students
and Buddhist monks destroyed a fire station in central Burma, then
stoned security personnel, injuring 11 of them, a military official
said today.
   Two monks were arrested after the clash in Mandalay on Monday,
Col. Than Tun, deputy chief of military intelligence, told a news
conference.
   Mandalay, about 350 miles north of Rangoon, is the country's
second-largest city.
   Than Tun said six soldiers and five policemen were injured while
dispersing the crowd. Some demonstrators used stones and slingshots
against the security forces, he said.
   At the same news conference, the chief of military intelligence,
Maj. Gen. Khin Nyunt, warned people and political parties against
confronting the authorities.
   Anti-government unrest has grown in recent months after the
military government's refusal to hand over power to the
pro-democracy party that won the May 27 general election. The poll
was Burma's first free vote in 30 years.
   The National League for Democracy took 392 of the 485 contested
parliamentary seats, but the government has given no indication
when it will convene the new Parliament and step down.
   Mandalay has been the scene of much of the recent unrest. It was
a major focus of the 1988 pro-democracy uprising, which the
military crushed when it seized power in September that year.
   On Aug. 8, two monks and two students were killed during a
demonstration in Mandalay, according to Western diplomats in
Rangoon. Days earlier, a student was reportedly bayoneted in the
face by a soldier.
   The government has denied the reports.
   On Friday, the government announced the arrest of six leaders of
the National League for Democracy, including its acting leader, Kyi
Maung, and his deputy, Chit Khaing.
   Arrested with them were four senior league leaders from Mandalay
accused of inciting the August protests.
   The two main leaders of the league, Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo,
were placed under house arrest in July 1989.
   At today's news conference, government spokesman Col. Ye Htut
said the administration planned to consult with the political
parties and convene a national conference to seek opinions on the
drafting of a new constitution. The government has said a new
constitution must be approved before a new administration is formed.
   Western diplomats say this a delaying tactic, since it could
take years to draw up a new constitution.

   Barbara Bush says if Saddam Hussein is
concerned about Iraq's children, he should pull his troops out of
Kuwait and end the crisis threatening to plunge the region in war.
   Asked Monday what she would tell the Iraqi president if she had
the chance, the first lady said, ``I'd rather send a message to our
soldiers and tell them we want them home and that we're doing
everything we can for peace.''
   Hussein has charged that the United Nations embargo is
jeopardizing the lives of children in his country and throughout
the region.
   ``That's not what's killing the children of Kuwait or Iraq or
Egypt or anyplace else,'' Mrs. Bush said. ``He went into a country
and attacked it. We can't forget that.''
   In a voice fraught with emotion, she said in an interview, ``I
hope he'll take into consideration these children.''
   Mrs. Bush said the Persian Gulf situation is the worst crisis
her husband has faced in his 20 months in office, but he was
bearing it well.
   ``I don't think it's ever off his mind, but does he dwell on it?
No,'' she said. ``He does what he can. He's got a wonderful,
wonderful disposition.''
   She said she was not at all bothered by criticism of Bush's
proceeding with his Maine vacation while American servicemen were
being dispatched to the Saudi Arabia ``because I knew he was
working.''
   Mrs. Bush said she has not been offering the president advice on
the gulf crisis.
   ``I think wives in my case, under our system, do very well to
aid and comfort their husband and keep trying to make life as
peaceful as you can at home _ not needle, not give suggestions,''
she said.
   She charged that her son, Neil, has been singled out for
scrutiny in the Silverado savings and loan scandal only because he
is the president's son.
   ``It's darn unfair that they're only doing it to hurt George
Bush ... and they have succeeded,'' she said. Their 35-year-old son
is a former outside director of the Denver thrift, which collapsed,
costing taxpayers $1 billion.
   Mrs. Bush revealed that Millie, her 3-year-old English springer
spaniel which had been hobbling earlier this year, has lupus but
``she's in complete remission.''
   Millie's rambunctious pup Ranger has taken up permanent
residence in the White House, having outgrown the suburban yard of
son Marvin Bush and family.
   ``Millie has not been supplanted,'' insisted Mrs. Bush, patting
the dog throughout the interview.
   The dog is the star of a new as-told-to ``autobiography'' about
life in the White House. Mrs. Bush, the ghost writer, is devoting
the royalties from ``Millie's Book'' to her literacy foundation,
which just last week awarded $500,000 in grants.
   ``I think it's very easy reading,'' she said of the $17.95 hard
cover book, replete with scores of pictures of Millie with her
pups, the president, Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and other VIPs.
   Asked if she expected Bush to seek re-election in 1992, the
first lady said, ``I don't doubt that he'll run again. But if he
didn't, I certainly wouldn't be surprised _ nor would I be
frightfully disappointed.
   ``Twelve years is a long time,'' she said, counting his eight
years as vice president and four as president. She added with a
laugh, ``I'm sort of looking forward to seeing if I know how to tie
my own shoelaces anymore.''
   But when they do leave the White House, ``we will miss that
jumbo jet,'' she said, referring admiringly to the spacious new
$133 million Boeing 747 put into service last week as Air Force
One. ``I haven't seen anything like it.''

<TEXT>
   The U.S. military is training more
personnel to work in chemical decontamination wards at field
hospitals, which would likely be overwhelmed if Iraq were to
unleash a major poison gas attack.
   The training, taking place in at least one major U.S. base camp
in Saudi Arabia, comes as doctors and others who work in the
decontamination units question their ability to handle a steady
patient load over a lengthy period.
   Americans also are training Saudis in how to decontaminate
people who come in contact with chemicals. At one base, such
training is being conducted every other day with groups of 10 to 12
Saudis from military medical facilities.
   ``Even though Iraq is their neighbor and has had these chemical
weapons for years the Saudis were really unprepared,'' one Air
Force officer involved in the training said.
   Most commanders discount the likelihood of any Iraqi attack and
have expressed confidence that their forces could intercept any
missiles or planes carrying chemical weapons into Saudi territory.
   But as a precaution, the United States has set up a series of
field hospitals, each with a separate area for decontaminating
troops who come under chemical attack.
   Iraq has a large stock of chemical and nerve agents, Western
intelligence sources have said.
   Saddam Hussein boasted in April that Iraq has developed binary
weapons, warheads or shells in which two chemical agents are housed
in separate compartments. These mingle on impact to form deadly
gases.
   The Iraqis used chemical weapons _ mainly mustard gas and
blister agents _ against Iranian troops during their eight-year
war, which ended in cease-fire in 1988.
   These did not prove especially effective. Western analysts
believe that in military terms, the casualties were low _ less than
300 killed and possibly 20,000 injured.
   However, the gas attacks had a considerable impact on Iranian
morale, forcing infantrymen to wear the heavy protective suits and
gas masks and thus reducing their fighting efficiency by about
one-third.
   Most of the U.S. field hospitals in Saudi Arabia have permanent
staffs of about 20 people, with a goal of treating 30 casualties an
hour provided two- thirds of the patients are walk-ins.
   ``It's a bit optimistic in this weather,'' Capt. James T.
Walker, an Air Force doctor in charge of one of the field units,
said of the treatment targets.
   Walker said the units likely would need additional personnel in
the event of heavy casualties because the treatment staff would
have to work in bulky, protective clothing and wear gas masks, a
problem in the sweltering Saudi temperatures.
   ``We will need to rotate people because it's quite strenuous,''
he said.
   The facility Walker runs is training additional people from the
base's combat support group.
   A similar facility at another large American installation
already has added 19 people to its regular staff of 15, and has
contingency plans to draw more help from that base's support group
if necessary.
   ``It's going to be hard but I think it can be done,'' Air Force
Sgt. Keith Tucker, who runs that unit, said Monday when asked if
his staff could meet the treatment goals.
   He said it would not be difficult to train additional help
quickly: ``Anything that we do here can be taught to anybody.''
   In most cases, soldiers who come into contact with chemical
agents would be hosed down, then have their protective suits
stripped or cut off.
   If the agents had seeped through to their inside uniforms, those
too would be removed and any exposed skin treated, Tucker said.
   The British have provided the U.S. forces with scanners that
detect most chemical agents, and those would be used to scan
patients before they are sent to the field hospital for treatment
of other injuries.
   The decontamination tents are not air-conditioned, although some
can be equipped with cooling systems.
   Walker and Tucker said it can get stifling hot inside the tents
when they are filled with staff and patients.
   But Col. P.J. Pettijohn, the commander of Air Force personnel at
one large U.S. base camp, said it was unlikely the tents would be
air-conditioned because most chemical agents break down faster in
heat.
   ``Heat is not necessarily an enemy in this case,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The wife of a former Drug Enforcement
Administration agent accused of selling confiscated narcotics
pleaded guilty to failure to file an income tax return under a plea
bargain.
   Barbara Jackson, 42, of Claremont entered her plea before U.S.
District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. on Monday.
   Mrs. Jackson originally faced eight criminal counts, including
money laundering and tax evasion. Under the agreement with
prosecutors, she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for failing to
report about $28,000 in income for 1987.
   Her husband, former DEA agent John Jackson, 41, pleaded guilty
last month to stealing cocaine and heroin from the agency's
evidence vault in Los Angeles, drug trafficking and money
laundering. He had originally been charged with 16 counts.
   Both are awaiting sentencing; Mrs. Jackson could receive up to a
year in jail and a $25,000 fine, Jackson up to 45 years in prison
and fines of more than $4.5 million.
   The Jacksons were among five people indicted by a federal grand
jury in 1988.
   Another former DEA agent, Wayne Countryman, 47, of Walnut, has
pleaded guilty to narcotics conspiracy and tax evasion. A third,
Darnell Garcia, 43, of Rancho Palos Verdes, faces trial Oct. 9 on
six counts, including drug trafficking.
   The three former agents were accused of taking confiscated drugs
and selling them to drug dealers.
   A fifth person, Sherman Lair, 40, of Alta Loma, has pleaded
guilty to participating in a narcotics conspiracy. He was a Jackson
business associate.

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops of the dead President Samuel Doe
bombarded rebels in Monrovia with shells today in a desperate stand
from the roof of the fortified presidential mansion.
   An interim government named Aug. 30 in Gambia by a unity
conference said it was sending envoys to Monrovia in preparation
for taking over the country.
   But rival rebel forces control various sectors of the country,
and Charles Taylor's mainstream rebel National Patriotic Front
pledged Monday to keep fighting until a 3,000-strong West African
task force sent to end the war withdraws from the capital.
   Doe died after being wounded in fighting with a breakaway rebel
faction that captured him Sunday. The U.S. State Department
confirmed Doe was dead.
   The British Broadcasting Corp. quoted witnesses who visited a
rebel camp near Monrovia as saying Doe's mutilated body was on
display there.
   They did not say how he died but that they watched rebel leader
Prince Johnson interrogate Doe about the disappearance of millions
of dollars of state funds during his 10-year rule.
   Shells exploded and gunfire crackled in the ravaged capital
today as Johnson's fighters searched the city for Doe loyalists.
   Doe's elite presidential guard, which includes the feared
Israeli-trained Special Anti-Terrorist Unit, turned heavy artillery
on the roof of the multistory executive mansion on the rebels.
   West African soldiers sent to end the 8{ months of fighting were
ordered to intervene.
   The chairman of the Economic Community of West African States
said he told the force to protect loyalists and family members of
Doe who remained in the clifftop presidential residence.
   ``I think it is now urgent to try and do something about
protecting these 230 or so Doe supporters from factional or tribal
revenge,'' the chairman, Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara, said
in Harare, Zimbabwe.
   Johnson said Monday he would lead Liberia until the transitional
government is set up.
   But representatives of the government can expect a hostile
reception from Taylor, whose 10,000-strong rebel army is the
biggest in the country.
   He has called the interim government a ``puppet'' administration
of the West African economic group.
   A statement issued today in Banjul, Gambia, by the government's
president, Amos Sawyer, said the delegation's first priority would
be to distribute relief supplies and food in the capital, where
people are dying of starvation.
   Sources close to Sawyer said he was urged to send envoys by
Johnson and Brig. Gen. David Nimley, whom Doe loyalists named
acting president shortly after his capture.
   Liberia has been without effective government for months, and
Monrovia has been torn by fighting involving the two rebel armies
and Doe loyalists since mid-July.
   Taylor said Monday his movement would ``intensify its efforts to
bring this crisis to an end by moving into Monrovia at any
expense.''
   He spoke in a broadcast over the state radio, which is behind
his lines.
   He has made similar threats before, but his army of mainly
untrained peasant youths, who have overrun most of Liberia, has
been bogged down on Monrovia's outskirts for nearly three months.
   Some of the heaviest fighting has occurred since the West
African task force sailed in Aug. 14 to try to enforce a cease-fire.
   Taylor started the war when he invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec.
24. Johnson, who was one of Taylor's top commanders, quarreled with
him in March and formed a splinter group.
   The three warring factions have slaughtered more than 5,000 of
this country's 2.3 million people, often because of their tribal
affiliations. Half a million Liberians have fled to neighboring
states or are displaced within their country.
   Doe was a Krahn, one of 14 small tribes in Liberia. Johnson is
the son of a Gio, and Taylor is of mixed Americo-Liberian and
native ancestry.
   About 2,100 U.S. Marines are based on ships off Monrovia and
assigned to guard the U.S. Embassy and residential compound. They
have evacuated hundreds of foreigners from the city but have orders
not to intervene in the war.

   About 3,000 gallons of hydrochloric acid
leaked at a chemical plant today, forcing an evacuation of about
150 people.
   The leak in a plastic pipe at the Midwest Ralumac plant was
reported about 1:45 a.m. and plugged about 4 a.m., fire officials
said. No serious injuries were reported, and a cloud caused by the
spill dissipated late in the morning.
   A hazardous-materials team used a snow blower to spread about
15,000 pounds of soda ash to soak up the corrosive chemical, fire
Battlion Chief Randall Higgins said.
   Police Sgt. August Sims said the evacuees were mostly plant
workers in the industrial area on the city's southeast side. Fewer
than 30 were local residents, he said. The Midwest Ralumac plant
and at least one other were closed for the day.
   Higgins said the cause of the leak was under investigation. The
plant makes asphalt emulsifier.

<TEXT>
   Federal parole officers are recommending
that former U.S. District Judge Walter L. Nixon, who was impeached
and removed from office, be sent back to prison for carrying guns
on a turkey hunt.
   Herb Lepchenske, one of two officers who conducted a parole
revocation hearing Monday, said he will recommend Nixon serve 10
months of the remaining three years of his five-year sentence.
Nixon, 61, was paroled in November 1989 on a conviction of lying to
a federal grand jury.
   The seven-member Parole Commission in Atlanta will review the
recommendation, and could give Nixon as little as a reprimand or as
much as the full remaining three years of the sentence.
   At the hearing, Nixon said he was carrying guns in cases when he
was arrested April 25 for hunting wild turkey over a baited field.
Nixon, who is appealing his conviction on that state offense,
testified he had changed his mind about hunting that day and never
took the guns out.
   Chester Diaz, a state Department of Wildlife investigator,
testified that Nixon asked him to pretend he wasn't carrying a
rifle and a shotgun. Nixon knew the guns he had were illegal for a
felon and asked if he could switch them for an old-fashioned
muzzleloader, Diaz said.
   ``I told him `No, sir,''' said Diaz.
   ``I'm very, very remorseful for what I've done,'' Nixon said
Monday. ``I haven't slept much since this happened.''

   Japan, chided for moving slowly to aid the
international campaign against Iraq, is considering giving $2
billion to the three nations hit hardest by the economic sanctions
on Iraq, an official said today.
   The aid would go to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, said Hiroyasu
Horio, an official with the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry. He would not elaborate.
   Local news reports said the aid would be extended through the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and $600 million would
be sent as early as mid-September.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said figures were not
decided, but the government was moving to set them quickly.
   On Friday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady visited Tokyo
on a world tour seeking $10.5 billion to help the three nations
withstand the U.N.-imposed economic embargo on Iraq, which invaded
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Japan has already promised a $1 billion aid package for
multinational peacekeeping forces in Saudi Arabia, including food,
water, vehicles and prefabricated housing for non-military uses.
   But critics in the United States have complained that Japan
should do more since its economy depends heavily on oil from the
Middle East. Japan imports 99 percent of its oil.
   ``I hope that when the total shape of our contribution is
clearly shown, this kind of criticism will be greatly reduced,''
Watanabe said at a news briefing.
   ``Some of them (criticisms) are based on a lack of knowledge
about what we are doing and some of them are affected by previously
held perceptions of Japan.''
   Japan's constitution bans the use of force in settling
international disputes and Japanese law restricts the military to
Japanese territory, except for participation in ceremonial
occasions overseas.
   But Horio said the trade ministry is considering chartering
foreign airplanes to send provisions ``as soon as possible'' for
the multinational forces, possibly next week.
   ``The pressure from abroad is getting so strong,'' Horio said.
   Citing the constitution, Japanese airlines and unions have
demanded the government limit items they carry to non-military
goods, and refused to fly over dangerous areas.
   When Japan last week sent a Panamanian ship loaded with 800
vehicles and other equipment for the international peacekeeping
effort in the Middle East, its departure was held up for hours by
negotiations with a seamen's union that had refused to enter the
troubled region.
   Horio said the government plans to send more vehicles, 2,000
trucks and 100 buses for the gulf forces. But he refused to provide
details or the date of departure ``to eliminate unnecessary trouble
before the departure.''
   Kyodo News Service, quoting unnamed sources, said the government
is considering sending military personnel overseas by temporarily
transferring them to a new ``peace cooperation team'' to support
United Nations activities.
   Watanabe said nothing has been decided on that yet, but the
government hoped to have legislation ready by the end of this month
for presentation to Parliament.
   ``What we have determined is we should come up with a decision
to change the law so that we can send some people in addition to
money in this kind of juncture,'' he said. They might not be from
the defense forces, he said.
   Japan already has said it will send 100 medical personnel to
help the international forces in the Gulf. Watanabe said the first
group of 20 may be announced before the end of the week.
   He said that because of legal problems with sending personnel
abroad in such cases, ``we cannot fully establish ourselves as a
kind of initiator of (world) policy as we wish.''

   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy walked the plank and
dropped out of the governor's race after staging a mutiny the
minute Gov. Michael Dukakis left her at the helm to take part in a
trade mission to Europe.
   Murphy quit the race Monday, days after she ordered cuts in
state spending in Dukakis' absence _ and against his orders.
   Her maneuver was blasted as a desperate stunt to rescue her bid
for the Democratic nomination. But she denied those accusations and
said she was simply looking out for the state while Dukakis was
away.
   ``Now there can be no confusion,'' she said Monday in dropping
out. ``This is not a political ploy. It is an honest and necessary
act of leadership.''
   Her campaign said the main reason for her withdrawal was that
she could not win. Campaign strategist Michael Goldman said weekend
surveys showed her support growing, but not enough to land her the
nomination in the three-way primary Sept. 18.
   However, a poll released Sunday by The Boston Globe and WBZ-TV
said her unfavorable rating rose from 38 percent to 49 percent.
   On Friday, Murphy unveiled plans she said would save the state
up to $150 million and help overcome a deficit. She issued
executive orders to fire an estimated 1,000 workers and cut
salaries for others. She also asked agencies to cut their 1992
budgets 10 percent.
   ``Today it is even more clear to me that these disputes are
necessary,'' she said Monday. ``It is also clear that the political
dispute about my decisions is diverting attention away from the
very serious problems that made them necessary.''
   Dukakis had postponed his trip for five days waiting for Murphy
to unveil her fiscal plans. He finally left on Thursday with a
warning not to take any drastic action.
   In a statement released in Boston on Monday, he was conciliatory.
   ``I know something about disappointment in politics,'' he said.
``Evelyn Murphy ran a strong and progressive campaign and she put
her heart into it.''
   Dukakis is scheduled to return Friday.
   Murphy said she would help former Attorney General Francis
Bellotti, who leads in the polls for governor. However, some Murphy
backers could still vote for her because she left the race far too
late to have her name removed from the ballot.
   Bellotti predicted he would gain from her withdrawal because
``many of the people who were with Evelyn Murphy are people who
would normally be with me.'' John Silber, the other Democratic
candidate, countered, ``Her endorsement of Frank Bellotti means
Frank Bellotti has precisely one vote more than he had before.''
   Silber, on leave as Boston University president, has staked out
conservative Democrats and independent voters.
   Murphy, who strongly backed Dukakis in his presidential bid in
1988, admitted he could undo her orders. On Monday she reviewed
those plans with Finance Secretary L. Edward Lashman, who said the
projected savings were highly inflated.

<HEAD>Aquino Rejects Plea for Marcos' Remains to be Returned for Burial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Corazon Aquino refused
today, the birthday of her ousted predecessor, Ferdinand Marcos, to
allow his remains to be buried in the Philippines.
   Meanwhile, a bomb exploded at a parking lot inside the suburban
Philippine army headquarters, but no one was injured, army
spokesman Col. Benjamin Enrile said.
   There were no suspects, he said. It was the 20th explosion in
the capital since Aug. 13. Police believe most bombings were
carried out by right-wing extremists.
   About 1,000 of Marcos' supporters marked his 73rd birthday by
marching through through Manila's streets.
   Marcos' widow, Imelda, appealed to Mrs. Aquino on Monday to
allow her to bring home her husband's remains from Hawaii. Marcos
died there last Sept. 28.
   ``(The return of Marcos) has to await a more propitious time,''
Mrs. Aquino said in a statement read by Press Secretary Tomas
Gomez. ``Prudence dictates that additional occasions for
debilitating and distracting activities be avoided.''
   Marcos was ousted in February 1986 and driven into exile by a
popular revolution. Mrs. Aquino consistently refused to let him
return, citing security concerns, and she continues to bar Mrs.
Marcos from the Philippines.
   After a Roman Catholic Mass today for Marcos, House of
Representatives minority leader Rodolfo Albano read a statement
praising the achievements of the former leader.
   Albano said Marcos was a ``good man judged at a wrong time by
the wrong minds,'' apparently referring to Mrs. Aquino's government.
   ``Everyone has human faults, for who has none?'' the statement
added. ``It is said that when a man is gone, only his misdeeds are
often remembered, no matter how few, forgetting all his good
deeds.''
   The statement also appeared as a full-page advertisement in
several Manila newspapers.
   Among those who attended the Mass were some former members of
Marcos' Cabinet, several congressmen and retired generals.
   Mrs. Marcos said Monday in Honolulu that she was would do
``everything to support'' Mrs. Aquino and begged her to reconsider
her ban.
   Mrs. Aquino replied: ``Sincerity is subject to proof.''
   She said she would make no deals with Mrs. Marcos until the
former first lady returns money allegedly taken from the
Philippines. The Aquino government has accused the Marcoses of
stealing up to $10 billion during 20 years in power.
   The Marcoses face 35 civil suits in the Philippines. Mrs. Marcos
was acquitted in the United States of racketeering charges. Marcos
died before he could be arraigned.

<HEAD>Archbishop of Canterbury: No Shortcuts to Hostages' Freedom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Archbishop of Canterbury said today there were
signs of progress in efforts to free his envoy, Terry Waite, and
other Western hostages in Lebanon.
   The Most Rev. Robert Runcie, however, said he did not plan to
travel to Lebanon to try to speed any release.
   Runcie was speaking a day after released Irish hostage Brian
Keenan said Waite was ``definitely alive'' and the European
Community announced plans to normalize relations with Tehran.
   Iran has helped to negotiate the release of several Western
hostages.
   Waite's cousin, John Waite, had suggested that Runcie was ``the
obvious choice'' to travel to the Middle East to seek freedom for
the remaining 13 Western hostages.
   Runcie told a news conference that while he ``grieved'' for
Waite, a hostage for more than 3{ years, this was ``not the time
for gimmickry or the pursuit of tempting shortcuts.''
   Keenan, 39, is the first released hostage to report contact with
Waite.
   During an interview Monday with Independent Television News,
Keenan said he had been held in the same Beirut apartment as the
51-year-old Waite and that the Anglican envoy had been ill.
   Runcie said he was heartened to have ``clear confirmation'' that
Waite was alive. He said he was also encouraged by signs of a
diplomatic breakthrough in relations between the European Community
and Iran.
   ``We, too, have maintained our own direct contacts with Iran and
will continue to do so,'' he said.
   Full relations between the EC and Iran were suspended last year
when Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for the
death of Salman Rushdie, the British author of ``The Satanic
Verses.'' Khomeini said the book was blasphemous.
   Runcie said while the Iranians do not hold the hostages, ``they
undoubtedly have considerable influence with the captors.''
   ``They have demonstrated that influence three times this year
with the release of (Americans) Robert Polhill and Frank Reed and
Brian Keenan.
   Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beirut
hotel to negotiate with Islamic Jihad, an extremist Moslem group,
for the release of two U.S. hostages
   Six Americans, four Britons, two West Germans and an Italian are
still missing in Lebanon.
   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

   Eight passengers died and six were
seriously injured when unidentified gunmen ambushed a bus in
northeastern Uganda, it was reported today.
   New Vision newspaper said the ambush occured Monday near Soroti,
a trading town 190 miles northeast of Uganda's capital, Kampala.
   Anwdine Makoha, the driver, told the newspaper that the bus,
carrying 60 passengers, ``was showered with bullets from the
attackers who were hiding on the road side.''
   Makoha managed to drive the vehicle with the dead and wounded to
Soroti.
   Monday's attack came a day after rebels reportedly killed nine
civilians and wounded five others in attacks on vehicles along
Uganda's eastern border southeast of Soroti.
   The estimated 150 armed men in Monday's attack were believed
members of the rebel Uganda People's army.
   The loosely knit insurgency is led by Peter Otai, defense
minister in the administration of former President Milton Obote,
said Munno newspaper. Obote was ousted in a 1985 military coup.
   Sporadic rebel attacks continue despite intensified army efforts
to squash insurgencies in eastern and northeastern Uganda.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Upholds California's Assault Rifle Ban</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRESNO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a case closely watched by both
gun-control advocates and opponents, a federal judge dismissed a
challenge by the National Rifle Association on California's ban on
automatic weapons.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Dean Price said Monday that the
Second Amendment, which gives citizens the right to bear arms, does
not apply to laws passed by state governments, as the NRA contended
in their case.
   He also ruled that Californians' constitutional right of privacy
does not equate with the right of self-defense.
   The NRA and the Fresno Rifle and Pistol Club filed the lawsuit
in February to stop enforcement of California's ban on automatic
weapons. The ban took effect Jan. 1.
   ``We conclude that the Constitution has left the question of gun
control to the several states,'' Price wrote. ``There are no
federal constitutional provisions that have been offended by this
(state) act.''
   The decision quickly drew response from both sides of the
gun-control issue.
   ``The court's decision is a tremendous victory for public
safety,'' California Attorney General John Van de Kamp said.
   ``This is just another step in the ongoing situation ... the
hysterical reaction instead of making good laws,'' said Diana Weeks
of the Fresno Rifle and Pistol Club.
   Under the Roberti-Roos Assault Weapons Control Act of 1989, it
is illegal to sell, advertise, manufacture or import more than 50
specific types of semiautomatic rifles, pistols and shotguns.
   The bill was passed in the wake of a schoolyard shooting in
Stockton in January 1989 that left five children dead.

   A National Guard training exercise in
which guardsmen jump from a low-flying helicopter into a lake
killed one soldier and injured five others, one critically,
authorities said today.
   The body of Sgt. Chet May of Fulton washed ashore from Grenada
Lake on Monday night and was found by park rangers, Sheriff Weston
Birdsong said. The accident occurred Sunday.
   ``The six guardsmen were undergoing a helicasting operation
where they jump from a low-flying helicopter from 10 to 15 feet
above water,'' said Staff Sgt. Sandy Switzer of the Mississippi
Military Department in Jackson.
   ``They're outfitted with swim trunks and inflatable life
preservers.''
   Switzer said it was not known what caused the death and
injuries. Investigators from the Army Safety Center at Fort Rucker,
Ala., began reviewing the circumstances Monday.
   The exercise was a training drill for the Mississippi National
Guard's 2nd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group. It was not
related to the Persian Gulf crisis, a guard spokesman said.
   Cpl. Ronald S. Kelly of Jackson remained in critical condition
today at the Memphis Regional Medical Center, a hospital spokesman
said. Four other soldiers were treated for minor injuries.

<TEXT>
   NASA mechanics trying to beat a
launch deadline installed new fuel pumps in the leaky shuttle
Columbia in hopes of getting the spaceship aloft next week.
   Columbia, whose liftoff with the $150 million Astro observatory
has been delayed twice by fuel leaks and once by problems with one
of its telescopes, must take off next week or wait until after the
October launch of Discovery.
   Discovery will have to be delayed until late 1991 if it misses
its launch window.
   NASA planned to test Columbia's new pumps today by flushing the
system with helium. In the pumps that were removed earlier, helium
tests failed to find leaks, and officials planned to try again with
supercold liquid hydrogen to simulate actual fueling conditions,
agency spokesman George Diller said today.
   The space agency hasn't sent up a shuttle in more than four
months because of fuel leaks in two of its three shuttles that
forced a grounding of the entire three-vehicle fleet.
   Columbia's aft compartment flooded with hydrogen during fueling
for a launch attempt last week, and engineers suspected a bad fuel
pump. The leak was in a different area from the one that earlier
affected Columbia and Atlantis.
   ``It's been peaks and valleys, and we're in a little bit of a
valley with Atlantis and particularly Columbia right now,'' said
Dick Richards, commander of Discovery's upcoming flight.
   ``But I'm hoping ... that this thing will turn around and two
years from now we won't even remember these hydrogen leaks. I think
they'll be a little bit of a footnote in shuttle history.''
   Meanwhile, a leak in Discovery's cooling system has preparations
for that flight several days behind schedule. Its mission is to
deploy a satellite scientists hope will become the first spacecraft
to orbit the sun's poles.
   Discovery must be launched between Oct. 5 and Oct. 23.
Otherwise, its $750 million mission will have to wait until 1991,
when Earth is aligned properly again with the sun and Jupiter.
   The sun probe, called Ulysses, will use Jupiter's gravity to be
whipped into the proper orbit around the sun.
   Engineers have traced Discovery's leaks to a vent in the ammonia
boiler, which is losing about 1 percent of its Freon contents each
day. Mission managers are recommending NASA fly with the leaky
boiler as long as the leak remains small, Diller said.
   Minor leakage will not jeopardize Discovery's flight because
there still would be enough coolant for the four-day mission,
Diller said. The boiler is needed to cool the shuttle during
landings.
   ``The leak's not big enough to bother with, and it doesn't look
like it's going to change,'' Diller said. ``They don't think it's
worth the impact to go change it.''
   If the part had to be replaced, Discovery still could lift off
by Oct. 23, but ``it's going to make it a lot harder,'' Richards
said.

<TEXT>
   Record torrential rains soaked South
Korea today, causing massive landslides and widespread flooding
that left at least 30 people dead and 46 missing and forced 50,000
to evacuate their homes.
   The Central Disaster Relief Center said the Seoul area was
swamped by 15 inches of rain in 24 hours. Hardest hit was Suwon, a
city immediately south of Seoul, which had 16.8 inches, the center
said.
   The rainfall was the most in a single day in 70 years, and
property damage was estimated at $15 million.
   The center said 30 people were dead and 16 missing. News reports
said at least 35 people were killed and as many as 46 were missing.
About 50,000 people were homeless and in shelters in the capital
and surrounding areas, the reports said.
   The torrential rains were expected to continue until Wednesday,
and flood warnings were issued for Seoul and central provinces.
   ``This is the worst weather disaster in memory,'' President Roh
Tae-woo said after being briefed on the situation. ``Protecting
people from this rain is like fighting a war.''
   Two cruise ships tied to a pier in Seoul's Han River sank in the
storm after the mooring ropes loosened and the boats capsized in
swift currents, police said. Ten crewmen were missing and 20
crewmen were rescued, police said.
   At the port of Inchon, west of Seoul, nine houses collapsed in a
mudslide and 20 people were missing, police said.
   A Buddhist temple was buried in a mudslide with five monks
inside, and a factory dormitory collapsed, killing six sleeping
employees, news reports said.
   The disaster center provided the overall figures on dead,
missing and evacuated. The national news agency Yonhap said the
dead included a 9-year-old girl swept away by raging flood waters
and a 3-year-old sleeping in her parents home.
   U.S. and South Korean military helicopters and army trucks
evacuated schoolchildren and shopkeepers stranded on housetops and
buildings in rural areas outside Seoul. After nightfall, panic
prevailed in many flooded areas without electricity or telephones,
news reports said.
   One hospital on the outskirts of Seoul evacuated its patients,
and witnesses reported seeing some patients wading through
waist-high flood water with belongings held over their heads.
   Korean soldiers used rubber boats to rescue people stranded in
low-lying areas around Olympic Park, site of the 1988 Olympic Games.
   Traffic in the city of 10 million people was at virtual
standstill early in the day, but by nightfall many trucks, cars and
some buses were standing in gullies of water, abandoned by drivers.
   About 25,000 people were homeless and being sheltered in school
auditoriums and public buildings in areas around Seoul, relief
officials said.
   U.S. fighter planes based at Osan, 30 miles south of Seoul, were
moved and sandbagged after the airfield was flooded. About two
dozen Koreans in makeshift boats floated over a submerged fence
onto the runways and were rescued, a spokesman said.
   The water supply for the U.S. base was flooded and contaminated
and bottled water was trucked in for drinking, a spokesman for the
7th Air Force said.
   The wide Han River, which bisects Seoul, was above flood stage
at nightfall and rising, officials said. Water tanks, pieces of
machinery and parts of buildings were seen bobbing in the raging
waters.
   Roh ordered a mobilization of the military and all government
agencies to help minimize the loss of life and property damage.
Government offices were told to remain open around the clock.
   U.S. General Robert W. RisCassi, commander of the 43,000
American troops based in South Korea, offered to loan bulldozers,
sandbag fillers, road graders and large earth-moving equipment as
well as labor to assist rescue efforts.
   The largest single day rainfall in Seoul had been 13.9 inches in
1920. Record keeping began in 1907.

   Authorities failed to meet a deadline to
file an indictment against former Communist strongman Todor
Zhivkov, his lawyer said, and it was unknown whether prosecutors
planned to renew the case or drop it.
   Zhivkov, who is under house arrest, has been accused of abuse of
office, misappropriation of state property and incitement of
national hatred _ a term used to describe his persecution of ethnic
Turks.
   Reny Tsanova, Zhivkov's lawyer, said in a television interview
Monday that prosecutors must now seek another extension or
discontinue proceedings for lack of evidence. So far, they have
done neither.
   The investigation of Zhikvov, who was arrested in January, was
to have been completed by July 18 and a trial held by this fall.
   The prosuection had asked for an extension to complete its work,
but did not do so before Monday's deadline.
   There has been speculation that Zhivkov may be never tried for
lack of enough evidence.
   In the TV interview, Ms. Tsanova was asked why Zhivkov refuses
to appear before parliament after he offered in a letter to address
it. She said Zhivkov had not gone back on his commitment ``but the
question is at what moment.''

<HEAD>Police Use Tear Gas to Prevent Serbian Rally in Bosnia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FOCA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police used tear gas and truncheons to
disperse a rally by Serbs and head off clashes with Moslems in a
central Yugoslav town today, the state Tanjug news agency and
witnesses said.
   At least four people were injured and 22 detained after
stone-throwing protestors clashed with police, Tanjug said.
   The incident in the Bosnian town of Foca, 30 miles southeast of
Sarajevo, occurred when thousands of Serbs gathered for a rally to
air grievances against the Moslem population that had been banned
by local authorities.
   Tensions between Orthodox Serbs and Moslems living in Foca were
raised three months ago after a local transport company strike
polarized the two ethnic groups.
   Serb employees have demanded the sacking of the company's Moslem
director, while Moslem workers have opposed the move.
   Serbs in Foca say they are being harassed by Moslems and
scheduled the rally to draw attention to their complaints.
   But police riot squads, fearing clashes between Serbs and
Moslems, dispersed the crowd with tear gas and truncheons,
witnesses and Tanjug said.
   Later, a strong police presence ensured an uneasy peace,
witnesses said from Foca.
   On Sunday, police used force to prevent clashes between Serbs
and Moslems in the Serbian town of Novi Pazar, 110 miles south of
Belgrade.
   Moslems comprise more than 20 percent of Yugoslavia's 24 million
population. Considered a separate nationality within Yugoslavia,
they are showing increasing solidarity with pan-Islamic trends in

   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R.
Biden Jr. said today Supreme Court nominee David Souter should
answer specific questions on abortion and other politically
volatile issues at his confirmation hearings.
   ``At this fateful moment in our history we have a right to
know'' the answers to such questions, said Biden, D-Del. As
Judiciary Committee chairman, he will preside over the hearings on
Souter's nomination scheduled to begin Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the president of the National Organization for Women
charged that Souter's nomination is part of a right-wing campaign
to stack the court with justices hostile to the rights of women and
minorities.
   NOW President Molly Yard told a news conference Souter is
``almost Neanderthal'' and said his record indicates he would vote
to overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling that
legalized abortion.
   ``You're literally talking about women's lives,'' she said.
``That's what at stake.''
   Biden brushed aside any notion that it would be wrong to force a
Supreme Court nominee to give his views on such matters as
abortion, civil rights, and freedom of religion that will come
before the court.
   ``All signs point to the need for very extensive, detailed
questioning of this nominee,'' Biden said.
   He said he has not decided yet whether the federal judge from
New Hampshire should be confirmed. But he did acknowledge that ``a
number of questions have been raised in my mind.''
   He called the nomination ``the most important business to come
before the Senate this year'' and said Souter's impact on the court
would linger ``long after (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein has
bitten the dust, long after the current budget crisis has been
replaced by some other fiscal dilemma.''
   He said he was ``not looking for promises'' as to how Souter
would decide controversial cases but added that Supreme Court
candidates in the past had often been questioned about their
opinions on major issues.
   He said that was especially true in the cases of nominees ``such
as Judge Souter with very limited records that give rise to almost
total uncertainty.''
   Biden dismissed a statement by Souter that his judicial
philosophy is that of an ``interpretivist.''
   ``Many scholars and jurists travel on this common banner,''
Biden said. He said some of Souter's comments in the past ``could
place him among the more rigid of these interpreters.''
   The only way to determine precisely what the label means in
Souter's case will be to ask how he views specific issues, Biden
said.
   ``There's nothing wrong with putting to Judge Souter some rather
specific questions relating to constitutional issues, including
religion, free speech, civil rights and abortion and expect some
... specific answsers,'' Biden said.
   ``What little we know of Judge Souter, and it is quite
tentative, emphasizes how important it is that we thoroughly
question him,'' Biden said.
   Ms. Yard said the nominee interprets the Constitution according
to its original intent in 1787, ``a time when all blacks were
slaves and women were the property of their husbands. We cannot and
will not as women accept such a stacking of the court on behalf of
right-wing zealots.''
   Eleanor Smeal, head of the Fund for a Feminist Majority and
former NOW president, predicted that Souter, if confirmed to the
high court, would be ``a consistent roadblock to the advancement of
women and minorities.''

   A minister led a group of about 50
protesters today who gathered at the gate of Fort Hood to press the
Pentagon to stop using women soldiers in the Persian Gulf.
   The Rev. W.N. Otwell of Fort Worth said he has planned protests
at a number of military installations in Texas to oppose using
mothers in combat areas.
   Fort Hood spokeswoman Liz Crossan said about 50 people,
including women and children, participated in the hour-long
demonstration at the post's main gate. The protesters were asked to
leave after they moved just inside the main gate shortly after 7:30
a.m., said Ms. Crossan.
   Bell County deputies and state troopers were at the scene, but
there were no arrests, she said.
   Fort spokesman Lindsey R. Neas said under defense department
policy, women are not assigned to front-line units. But they may be
assigned to support units that are near combat areas and could
therefore be at risk, he said.

   At least 25 people died today
in black faction fighting, and African National Congress leader
Nelson Mandela said the government's failure to halt the carnage
put the peace process ``in distress.''
   Mandela led an ANC-delegation that met with President F.W. de
Klerk to discuss violence that has plagued black townships near
Johannesburg since Aug. 12, claiming more than 650 lives.
   ``The government came under heavy attack (during the meeting)
for its failure to take visible measures to deal with the
situation,'' Mandela told journalists, adding that he accused the
government of waging war against the ANC.
   He said the ANC would do everything possible to continue talks
with the government on a new constitution to give the black
majority political power.
   But there was no doubt ``the peace process is in distress,''
Mandela said.
   There was no immediate government comment on the meeting.
   Police said 22 people were killed early today in fighting in
Katlehong township and two were killed in Vosloorus. Rival bands of
Zulus and Xhosas fought with axes, spears and knives.
   At least one black man was hacked to death today and several
injured on a train in Johannesburg by men with machetes who
rampaged through carriages attacking passengers, police said.
   The fighting has largely pitted Xhosas and other blacks loyal to
the ANC against Zulus tied to the conservative Inkatha party. Both
factions oppose apartheid but differ over leadership and plans for
a future South Africa.
   Constitution Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen attacked
Mandela for his criticism of police during the fighting, and
charged the ANC was not helping to end violence. It was the
strongest attack on Mandela by the government in recent months.
   ``Mr. Mandela lays all responsibility for curbing violence on
the shoulders of the government. All political organizations have a
duty and responsibility actively to contribute towards calming
excited emotions and restoring peace and stability,'' Viljoen said
in a statement Monday night.
   ``The ANC ... must cease claiming total innocence for themselves
and their followers, and laying blame on their opponents, or the
police,'' he said.
   Mandela and the ANC, the country's largest black opposition
group, have repeatedly charged that police instigated violence or
aided Inkatha fighters. Police and government officials have
rejected the charges.
   Mandela told a weekend meeting of the Organization of African
Unity in Uganda that South Africa would be ``drowned in blood''
unless the government took steps to end the violence. He also said
the growing violence threatened to derail talks between the ANC and
the government on ending white minority rule.
   The ANC and the government are preparing for talks, expected
early next year, on sharing political power with the black
majority. De Klerk has promised to end apartheid.
   In other developments, a bomb exploded early today outside a
Johannesburg cinema where a liberal newspaper is holding a film
festival, police said. The bomb caused little damage and there were
no injuries, they said.
   The Weekly Mail is holding an annual festival of progressive
films at the cinema. Police said no group claimed responsibility
for the blast, but officers said it could be the work of whites
opposed to ending apartheid.
   Six political prisoners, all members of the ANC, were released
today in Cape Town. The men were freed under a recent agreement
between the government and the ANC on freeing political detainees.

   The Soviet Union and West Germany have reached a
compromise on how much money Bonn will pay Moscow for the pullout
of Red Army troops from East Germany. West Germany's finance
minister put the figure at $7.6 billion.
   Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, in an interview with wire
service reporters, refused to specify how much money or say how the
``compromise agreement'' was reached Monday, but he said it was
``something that will satisfy us and our partners.''
   ``A compromise is a compromise. The main thing is we have an
agreement,'' he said. ``This issue is no longer an obstacle.''
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel cited the $7.6 billion figure at a
meeting of conservative Christian Democrat and Christian Socialist
members of parliament in West Berlin today, the finance ministry
press office said.
   The West German television network ZDF said President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had reached an
agreement ``in principle'' on the money during the 30-minute
telephone call.
   Also Monday, German officials announced a $636 million deal with
Moscow to help troubled East GermThey are motivated by profit, greed and
avarice,'' said Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. ``Theirs is an attitude that I think really
is repugnant.''
   To express displeasure with the level of support, the Senate on
Monday adopted a resolution threatening a deterioration in U.S.
relations with any nation that doesn't contribute enough.
   In Tokyo today, a Japanese official said Japan was considering
giving $2 billion to the three nations hardest hit by the economic
sanctions against Iraq. That would be on top of $1 billion the
country has already pledged to support the military effort against
Iraq.
   Hiroyasu Horio, an official of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, said the $2 billion would go to Egypt, Jordan
and Turkey. News reports in Tokyo said the money would be extended
through the World Bank and International Monetary Fund with the
first $600 million being sent as early as mid-September.
   The Senate resolution, attached to a spending bill for the
Postal Service and other agencies, directed the president to
present Congress a detailed report on the administration's
cost-sharing efforts by Nov. 30.
   ``During his consultations with other international leaders,''
Bush ``should consider stressing ... that failure by any country to
actively contribute in the most appropriate manner for that country
could have a detrimental impact on its bilateral relationship with
the United States,'' the resolution said.
   The approval of the measure, the first such congressional action
since Bush ordered U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia, reflected
lawmakers' reaction to complaints by voters that the United States
is shouldering too much of the burden.
   The United States ``cannot play Uncle Sugar to the world,'' said
Sen. Dennis Deconcini, D-Ariz., one of the primary sponsors.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called Japan's $1 billion pledge only
a ``few token shillings.'' He contended that a more adequate
response, given Japan's economic standing, would be an $8 billion
pledge.
   ``The contemptible tokenism of the actions of the Japanese
government to date merit nothing but the world's contempt and
American hostility,'' McCain said. ``If combat arises, it will not
be Japanese boys whose lives are at risk, it will be American
boys.''
   Japan, which ran up a $49 billion trade surplus with the United
States last year, was singled out for the bulk of the criticism.
But senators said they also were unhappy with the response so far
by West Germany, which has agreed to supply air and sea transport
but turned down a U.S. request for more help in defraying the costs
of keeping troops in the Persian Gulf.
   West Germany and Japan both contend that their post-World War II
constitutions bar them from sending troops to the Persian Gulf.
   The United States is seeking approximately $28 billion through
the end of 1991 for the gulf campaign. Of that amount, $10 billion
would go to supply aid to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan and the
remainder would pay for the U.S. military buildup.
   While Brady had little luck getting much more than words of
encouragement from France, Britain, South Korea and Japan last
week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III reported more success
on a similar fund-raising mission to oil-rich Middle Eastern
nations.
   Baker said Monday that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
and the exiled government of Kuwait had pledged $12 billion, split
between the military effort and the economic assistance package.
   But some critics charged that consumers from America and other
countries were in reality footing the bill through higher energy
prices.
   Edwin Rothschild, head of the consumer group Citizen Action,
said the Saudis stood to make an extra $3.2 billion monthly from
the crisis based on a $10-a-barrel rise in oil costs since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait and a 2 million-barrel per day increase in Saudi
production. Their share of the U.S. military costs was reportedly
only $500 million a month.
   The administration has been stressing the need for a united
front against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, something analysts
say is not helped by the lukewarm reception by some allied
countries.

<HEAD>Panel Opposes Anti-Obscenity Curbs on Arts Endowment Grants</HEAD>

   An independent study commission, created amid
furor over government funding of controversial art, urged Congress
today not to impose anti-obscenity curbs on works subsidized by the
National Endowment for the Arts.
   It also called on the arts agency chairman, John E. Frohnmayer,
to scrap a requirement that grant recipients sign a pledge not to
use federal funds to produce works that might be deemed obscene.
   The bipartisan 12-member panel, established by Congress last
fall, also proposed overhauling the grant-making machinery of the
endowment.
   ``Maintaining the principle of an open society requires all of
us, at times, to put up with much we do not like, but the bargain
has proved in the long run a good one,'' the commission said.
   The House is preparing to begin debating soon legislative
proposals to extend the life of the embattled arts endowment, with
restrictions on the kinds of art that can receive federal funds.
The NEA's statutory authority expires Sept. 30.
   Rep. E. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., a key figure in House
negotiations on the endowment's future, said the report could serve
as the possible framework for a compromise. But he said Congress
probably will insist on including some anti-obscenity restrictions
in its final bill, even if it only reaffirms Supreme Court rulings
on the issue.
   Jeffrey Chester, a spokesman for the National Campaign for
Freedom of Expression, a non-profit artists' organization, praised
the proposal to eliminate Frohnmayer's anti-obscenity pledge for
grant recipients.
   But Chester expressed concern that the report, if endorsed by
Congress, would turn the NEA chairman into a ``new arts czar'' with
sole authority over final grant-making decisions, while diminishing
the traditional role of NEA peer-review panels in selecting grants
for approval.
   ``The commission is tightening the vise of censorship,'' Chester
said.
   The NEA has been buffeted for more than a year by criticism from
conservative lawmakers and religious fundamentalists over its
support for works that some regarded as pornographic or
sacrilegious.
   At the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Congress amended the
endowment's current $171 million budget last fall to include a ban
on support for works that ``may be considered obscene,'' including
homoerotic and sadomasochistic images.
   The commission unanimously urged Congress not to hobble the NEA
with anti-obscenity restrictions and, in effect, to trust the
endowment chairman to approve grants for works of artistic
excellence that are not obscene or otherwise illegal.
   ``Insuring the freedom of expression necessary to nourish the
arts while bearing in mind limits of public understanding and
tolerance requires unusual wisdom, prudence and, most of all,
common sense,'' said co-chairmen Leonard Garment, a Washington
lawyer, and John Brademas, president of New York University.
   At a news conference this morning, the study commission
recommended diminishing the role of the NEA's ``peer review
panels'' which select grant applications for approval, and giving
the NEA chairman sole, explicit authority to make final grant
decisions without restrictions by Congress.
   The report urged reviving a system under which committees of the
National Council on the Arts, the endowment's advisory body, would
review peer panel selections before final grant awards are made.
   With the aim of increasing the NEA's accountability to the
tax-paying public, the commission said the peer panels _ which
consist of outside artists and arts managers _ should be expanded
to include ``persons knowledgeable about the arts but not earning
their living in them.''
   The report declared that ``obscenity is not protected speech''
and that the NEA ``is prohibited from funding the production of
works which are obscene or otherwise illegal.'' But it said the
endowment should stay out of the business of defining what is
obscene, leaving that as a legal matter for the courts to decide.
   Likewise, the panel said it unanimously opposed ``legislative
changes to impose specific restrictions on the content of works of
art supported by the endowment.''
   It added: ``Content restrictions may raise serious
constitutional issues, would be inherently ambiguous and would
almost certainly involve the endowment and the Department of
Justice in costly and unproductive lawsuits.''
   The commission suggested that Congress instead approve a
``preamble'' to legislation reauthorizing the NEA, which would
declare that the arts ``belong to all the people of the United
States'' and should foster ``mutual respect for the diverse beliefs
and values of all persons and groups.''
   The obscenity ban approved by Congress last fall was prompted by
criticism of past NEA support for exhibitions of works by
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe, which contained sexually graphic
images, and by artist Andres Serrano, which some critics denounced
as blasphemous.
   After Congress acted, Frohnmayer instituted the anti-obscenity
pledge for grant recipients, which has caused widespread protests
in the arts community.
   By the NEA's latest count, nearly a dozen artists and arts
organizations have refused to sign the anti-obscenity pledge and
have forfeited their endowment grants. The pledge also is being
challenged on constitutional grounds in federal lawsuits in New
York and Los Angeles.

   A ban on parking along 17 miles of major Paris
streets went into effect Tuesday, part of a campaign to ease severe
traffic congestion.
   The restrictions prohibit parking at any time along a series of
designated ``red roads'' that form the major east-west and
north-south routes. A special force of 120 police and traffic
officers was assigned to enforce the new rules.
   On Tuesday, they limited themselves to verbal warnings, but
starting Thursday will tow away the cars of offending motorists.
Violators face fines of $85.
   The affected routes include some of Paris' best-known streets,
such as the Rue du Rivoli and the Boulevard Saint Michel. Even
delivery trucks are barred from stopping in some areas.
   Mayor Jacques Chirac said the restrictions are part of a plan to
limit the use of private cars in central Paris and give priority to
public transport. He said the city intends to compensate for the
ban by providing thousands of new parking spaces in proposed
underground garages.
   Some environmentalist groups have criticized the ban, saying it
will backfire by attracting more motorists with the prospect of
less congested streets.

   A letter said to have been written by
Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee was withdrawn from sale and will be
donated to a museum, an auctioneer said Tuesday.
   Michael Shortall of M. Shortall Auctions said the letter, which
belongs to the American de Krafft family, was taken off the market
``because of the great interest it aroused.'' He would not say
where the de Kraffts live in the United States because the family
wants to protect its privacy.
   The letter of thanks for a gift of a uniform and blankets was to
have been auctioned Monday along with other items from Heronden
Hall in Tenterden, Kent County, which belongs to the de Krafft
family. The family is selling the house and contents.
   ``The family now feels the letter is of such interest that it
should be in a museum,'' said Shortall. ``They are talking to
representatives of a British museum which exhibits American
items.'' He declined to name the museum.
   Shortall also declined to say whether the letter had been
authenticated.
   The letter is dated April 22, 1864, a year before the Civil War
ended with Lee's surrender at Appomattox. It was sent from Lee's
headquarters to a Maj. L.B. Ferguson in England.
   It acknowledges ``the uniforms and blankets you so kindly sent
me. We have, partly owing to your efforts and partly to the
exertions of our people, everything we actually want. All else we
can dispense with.''

   About 200 prisoners rioted at a Sydney
jail over a planned crackdown on the personal items they can keep
in their cells.
   A spokesman for Bathurst jail said two prison officers and eight
inmates required medical treatment after the Monday riot but were
not seriously injured.
   The new policy prohibits all items except televisions, radios
and books in cells. It was implemented after a prison officer was
stabbed with a syringe filled with AIDS-infected blood. The officer
subsequently tested positive for the AIDS virus.
   A spokesman for the Prison Officers Association, Dick Palmer,
said Bathurst inmates refused to leave the prison's main square
Monday afternoon to protest the new policy, which is being
implemented next week. They began smashing windows and destroying
prison property.
   Officers fired tear gas on the prisoners, who finally returned
to their cells after negotiations with prison officers.
   Palmer attacked the state government for the severity of the new
policy, saying his group was not consulted.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev ordered a
``thorough investigation'' into the ax murder of a prominent
Russian Orthodox priest, a presidential spokesman said Tuesday.
   Father Alexander Menn, a writer who was persecuted for his
evangelical activities, was bludgeoned to death with an ax while on
his way to church, according to media reports Monday.
   His body was found Sunday near his house in Zagorsk, 50 miles
east of Moscow, Tass said.
   Presidential Spokesman Vitaly Ignatenko said at a news
conference that Gorbachev had expressed ``profound regret'' over
Menn's death. ``Gorbachev gave instructions to law and order
officials to conduct a very thorough investigation into this
case,'' Ignatenko said.
   Ordained a priest in 1961, Menn was a theologian and a church
historian. He published several books and articles, as well as a
children's book. His popular history of comparative religion was
published in several volumes in Belgium.
   Authorities detained him for questioning several times, but he
was never held for long periods, according to a spokesman for
Keston College in Britain, a research center for religion in
communist countries.
   In 1988, with the easing of restrictions on religious
activities, Menn was one of the first priests to be invited to
visit schools and talk to children about the church.

<TEXT>
   A series of copy-cat suicides in Italy has led to
calls for the media to limit coverage of such deaths.
   One major newspaper said it would publish only scant reports
from now on, and the state-run RAI-TV said it was limiting coverage
to late-night newscasts, which have the fewest viewers.
   Since the beginning of September, 10 people have taken their
lives in a similar fashion _ running a tube from the exhaust pipe
into their car and turning on the ignition.
   Newspapers have paid considerable attention to the suicides,
examining the victims' pasts and editorializing on the ills of
modern Italian society that might lead someone to commit suicide.
   In one of the cases, police said they found a newspaper opened
to the story of a previous suicide on the seat next to the victim.
   After the ninth suicide last weekend, the Rome newspaper Il
Tempo announced in a front-page editorial that it would limit
further reporting on suicides to a few lines on an inside page.
   ``The information blackout ... can help to break the tragic and
repetitive chain,'' Il Tempo said.
   Indro Montanelli, editor of the Milan newspaper Il Giornale,
disagreed.
   ``In principle, there is no news that shouldn't be published. To
write about suicides is dangerous? In that case, we won't write
about rapes, robberies, murders, smoking, terrorism,'' Montanelli
said. ``If we follow that logic, we won't put out newspapers
anymore.''
   Gianni Rocca, deputy editor of La Repubblica of Rome, agreed
with Montanelli. ``For how long would we have to be silent about
such news? For a day, a week, for our whole life?'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Mongolia's first democratically elected
legislature, signaling the high priority given economic problems,
named the top price control official as premier, China's official
news agency reported Tuesday.
   In a dispatch from the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, Xinhua
said the legislature Monday confirmed President Punsalmaagiin
Ochirbat's nomination of Dash Bambasuren as premier.
   Bambasuren, 58, was chairman of the State Price and
Standardization Committee and is a graduate of the Soviet Economic
Statistics College, the report said.
   He replaces Sharavyn Gunjaadorg, 54, former minister of
agriculture. Gunjaadorg became premier in March during a shakeup of
top Communist Party and government ranks forced by pro-democracy
demonstrations.
   The demonstrations also led to elections in July for a new
national legislature, the 430-seat Great People's Hural. The
Communists, who have ruled Mongolia since 1921, retained power, but
most of the leaders of newly legalized opposition parties won
legislative seats.
   As a group, the Communist deputies are better educated and more
reform-minded than in the past. The party maintains it shares most
of the opposition's goals, including shaking up the long-stagnant
economy with market-style reforms and ending human rights
violations.

   The government has earmarked $50 million in
aid to help clean up Soviet industries that are polluting the
arctic regions of both countries, news reports said Wednesday.
   ``We are not doing this to solve a Soviet problem, but to solve
a Norwegian problem,'' said Prime Minister Jan P. Syse.
   Pollution from outdated Soviet smelters drifts into northern
Norway, damaging the fragile arctic environment. Syse made the
announcement late Monday at an Oslo concert held to benefit the
Norwegian ``Stop the Soviet Death Clouds'' movement.
   The grant will be distributed over five years. It requires
parliament's approval, and NTB reported that it has broad support
across party lines.

   Florida's weekly Lotto jackpot was
raised to $90 million today as sales continued at a pace that could
send the game past the $100 million mark before Saturday night's
drawing.
   The overnight $10 million increase in the prize money was
announced by Susan Nefzger, spokeswoman for the lottery.
   On Saturday, there were no winning tickets in a $50 million
lottery. The next day, the jackpot for the coming Saturday was set
at $75 million; on Monday, it was raised to $80 million.
   For the jackpot to reach $100 million, lottery officials
calculate that the state will have to sell $98 million tickets this
week. The previous record was $56 million in sales in one week, set
in April.
   Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul said Monday's sales raced well
ahead of the record pace.
   ``It's a little crazy here right now,'' she said. ``It's a
really hard issue for us because this is so outside of the norm.''
   April Fanaken of Fort Lauderdale was playing for the first time.
   ``I have never played. I am a teacher, and all my kids all day
long have been talking about `you never know,''' she said,
referring to the slogan used by the lottery.
   Extra maintenance people were added this week to keep terminals
working across the state and additional phone lines were installed
at lottery headquarters to handle increased telephone traffic, Mrs.
Paul said.
   The national record for a lottery prize is $115 million, which
was awarded in Pennsylvania to 14 ticket-holders, some of them
individuals and some groups.
   But the U.S. record of the largest single lottery prize still
goes to Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, who won a Florida Lotto
jackpot of $55.1 million two years ago.
   Lotto jackpots roll over when no one picks all the winning
numbers. The Lottery Department then estimates the size of the next
week's jackpot based on sales projections.
   The odds of someone picking the winning numbers are about
one-in-14 million.
   Another concern for lottery officials is the design of the
billboards announcing jackpot estimates, which don't have space for
a nine-figure jackpot. ``The boards were not originally prepared
for the extra digi,'' said Bernie Torra, spokesman for Ackerley
Communications of Miami, lottery billboard handlers in South
Florida. ``We're working on it.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush will tell Congress tonight that
the Persian Gulf crisis has forged ``a new world order'' in which
the superpower adversaries of the Cold War now stand united to
reverse Iraq's conquest of Kuwait.
   Bush will follow up the address with a televised message for the
Iraqi people declaring that the world is united against their
government's invasion of Kuwait.
   Bush, fresh from his one-day summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Helsinki, will go before a joint session of
the House and Senate with a nationally broadcast address at 9 p.m.
EDT.
   Aides said the president will seek the nation's support for his
decision to send more than 100,000 troops to the gulf region to put
pressure on Saddam and deter a possible invasion of oil-rich Saudi
Arabia.
   ``He's going to be very candid with them about exactly what
we're doing there and why and what our purposes are,'' said White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``It's going to require a
commitment of resources and time and energy by the American
people.''
   Then, on Wednesday morning, Bush will tape a television message
in the Oval Office, with Arabic subtitles and voice translation, to
spell out why much of the world has united against Iraq's conquest
of Kuwait. Fitzwater said the tape was being made as a
counter-offer to Iraq's proposal to send a team of interviewers to
question Bush.
   Fitzwater said it was irrelevant that Bush had chosen a forum
different from the one that Iraq suggested. ``The issue was, the
president said he would like to have equal kinds of access to the
Iraqi people that the United States has granted to Saddam Hussein,
and we assume that is the essence of the invitation,'' the
spokesman said.
   If Iraq declines to broadcast the tape, Fitzwater said, it will
be made available to other Arab countries, as well as nations
around the world.
   ``The Iraqi government has not been forthcoming in telling the
people of that country what's happening,'' Fitzwater said. He said
the people of Iraq are generally unaware of resolutions at the
United Nations and the Arab League condemning the invasion or the
flood of refugees that it has created.
   The address marks the third time that Bush has addressed
lawmakers during his 20 months in the White House. While Congress
has been largely supportive of his gulf policy, many of its leaders
have urged him to go before the nation with a speech spelling out
U.S. objectives and the risks in protecting the region's vast
supplies of oil.
   The occasion presents Bush with an opportunity to prod lawmakers
to conclude a long-stalled agreement with the White House to cut
the budget deficit by slashing spending and raising taxes.
   Fitzwater told reporters the gulf crisis ``points up the need to
put our domestic house in order and reach a budget agreement, on
defense as well as other domestic issues.''
   ``We're going to need all our strength to see us through in the
Persian Gulf,'' he said.
   Bush, in the last two weeks, has been promoting the thesis that
the United States and Soviet Union have moved even closer together
because of their joint opposition to Iraq's aggression. Fitzwater
said the president would expand on that theme tonight.
   ``First of all, he'll report to the Congress on the summit
meeting with Gorbachev,'' the spokesman said. ``Then he wants to
lay out to the Congress and the people the overall situation in the
gulf, the status of our forces, the role of the U.N.
   ``He will use the summit (in Helsinki) and the gulf situation to
talk about the changing East-West relations, a new world order in
which the superpowers join together in the U.N. auspices to
establish certain responsibilities for world stability,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Despite their agreement on forcing Iraq to retreat from Kuwait,
the United States and Soviet Union still have differences on
whether military force might eventually be needed.
   Gorbachev is pressing for a political solution in the gulf while
Bush has left military options open. Gorbachev did not make any
commitment to remove all of the Soviet trainers who are helping
Iraq's military, although Bush said their withdrawal would be
helpful.
   On the other hand, the two leaders moved toward agreement at the
summit to give Moscow a major role in Middle East peace efforts,
reversing a longstanding U.S. policy against Kremlin involvement.
   ``Under existing circumstances, we feel they can be helpful,''
Fitzwater said. However, he said the idea of a Middle East peace
conference, as espoused by Moscow, ``should not be linked to the
existing situation.''
   On the eve of today's speech, Fitzwater said Saddam was
``grasping at any straw he can find'' by mending relations with
Iran, once a bitter enemy, and by offering free oil to Third World
nations.
   ``The man is desperate, reaching out wherever he can,''
Fitzwater said.
   Bush, meanwhile, asked Congress for $14.2 million so the
government-financed Voice of America can broadcast its radio
programs 24 hours a day in the Persian Gulf and throughout the
Middle East.
   Currently, VOA broadcasts only 7{ hours a day. To pay for
increasing the Arabic service, Bush proposed cutbacks in radio
programs beamed to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   Also on Monday, Bush called the leaders of France, Egypt,
Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Canada to brief them on Sunday's summit
with Gorbachev.
   ``The response has been overwhelmingly supportive and almost
euphoric in many cases in terms of the Soviet Union and the United
States being able to come together this way,'' Fitzwater said.

<BYLINE>Mike Wallace Says Will Keep Working Until His ``Toes Turn Up''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mike Wallace, at 72 the senior citizen of CBS
News' durable ``60 Minutes,'' said Tuesday he'll retire only when
he dies _ or, as he put it, his ``toes turn up.''
   ``When, if retire?'' he asked, repeating a question about when
or if he'd ever retire. ``Toes turn up _ retire. As long as you
have a good time and as long as you can do the job, why retire?''
   Wallace, who with Harry Reasoner was on the staff of ``60
Minutes'' when it began 23 years ago this month, spoke at a
breakfast to publicize ``Mike Wallace, Then and Now, A CBS News
Special.''
   The one-hour program, scheduled for Sept. 26, is a retrospective
of his 40-year career in news, of which 31 years have been spent at
CBS.
   The program includes old black-and-white clips of his
smoke-wreathed ``Night Beat'' one-on-one series of the mid-1950s.
   The show, which began on local TV in New York and then appeared
on ABC, was responsible for first gaining Wallace fame as a
hard-boiled interviewer who rarely gave his subjects any slack.
   In those days, he said, ``interviews by and large were virtual
minuets. ... Nobody dogged, nobody pushed.''
   That's why, he theorized, ``Night Beat'' ``got attention that
hadn't been given to interview broadcasts before.''
   As a result of one interview on that show, Wallace said, he was
sued for libel. Then-Los Angeles Police Chief William Parker sued
because of remarks about him by mobster Mickey Cohen. Wallace said
ABC settled the lawsuit for $44,000. Wallace said it was the only
time money has been paid to a plaintiff in a suit in which he was
involved.
   The most publicized lawsuit against him was by retired Gen.
William C. Westmoreland, who sought $120 million for a 1982 ``CBS
Reports'' documentary, ``The Uncounted Enemy: A Vietnam Deception.''
   Westmoreland dropped the libel lawsuit in February 1985 after a
long trial. Lawyers for each side later said legal costs of the
suit totaled $12 million, of which $9 million was paid by CBS.

   West Germany will pay $7.6 billion to
the Soviet Union to help finance the pullout of Soviet troops from
East Germany, the Finance Ministry confirmed Tuesday.
   Finance Minister Theo Waigel cited the figure at a meeting of
Christian Democratic and Christian Socialist members of parliament
in West Berlin. He was confirming news reports Monday that West
Germany would pay that sum to help repatriate the 370,000 Soviet
troops stationed in East Germany.
   The Soviets are to be withdrawn over the next four years.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze announced agreement
on Monday evening without naming a figure. He called the terms of
the accord a ``compromise.''
   The two governments had been deadlocked over the costs of the
withdrawal of the Soviet troops and their dependents. In
particular, Soviet military officials had expressed concerned about
the housing shortage Red Army forces face when they return home.
   The West German contribution will go toward housing for the
returning Soviet soldiers and their families, as well as training
programs for the troops.

   ``We've gotten on the floor and I try to have him get out of

   Mrs. Gertson's prized possession is a card from television

Mrs. Gertson got a card that read:
   ``It is because of you and millions of Hulkamaniacs like you

   ``I think I'll frame it,'' Mrs. Gertson said.
   She takes professional wrestling seriously.
   ``I get as excited about it as I can and watch it at 2 p.m. most
afternoons and on Monday nights. I close the shades and take the
phone off the hook,'' Mrs. Gertson said.
   She said she doesn't think the matches are staged, and prefers
professional wrestling to television soap operas.
   ``If there is anything fake it's a soap opera?'' she asked.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon has detected ``some increase in
military activity'' inside Iraq near its borders with Turkey and
Syria, but a spokesman said today that there seems little
indication that hostilities in the areas were imminent.
   At a briefing, spokesman Pete Williams declined to offer much
detail about the movements.
   However, asked whether the movements involved air or ground
troops, Williams said that as a general matter _ and not
necessarily in this case _ such military activity could involve
``flights, training flights, that kind of thing.''
   Asked whether the movement indicated increased forces, he said,
``not necessarily.''
   ``We are aware of some increase in military activity near the
Syrian and Turkish borders, but there is nothing to indicate
imminent hostilities, and beyond that I cannot characterize that
activity for you,'' Williams said.
   Williams said that the number of Iraqi forces in and around
occupied Kuwait remained stable at about 265,000 troops and about
2,200 tanks.
   The spokesman said the status of the forces has not changed
substantially over the past week, and that while their military
posture remained defensive, it could become offensive ``very
quickly.''

   Iraq's Saddam Hussein is a frequent topic
of conversation at American Legion Post 133, where the talk is as
hot as Old Glory on fire.
   ``I think we should drop an atomic bomb on his doorstep,'' said
Haley Rhoden. ``I think we should get in there and whip them and
get out.''
   Others favored assassinating Saddam, whose soldiers invaded
Kuwait last month.
   The Russell Barrett Legion Post has been in operation for 70
years. It was named for a soldier killed in World War I.
   It has 300 members, most of them World War II veterans.
Legionnaires must have served in the military during wartime, and
the members here know the cost of war.
   Near the entrance is a bronze plaque listing the town's World
War II dead, and a sheet of paper under glass listing the Vietnam
dead. Each meeting ends with a 30-second pause to remember the
departed.
   This is a place where men brag about how many relatives have
gone to war, where patriotism is fashionable, and where the word
``peacenik'' is spat rather than spoken.
   T-shirts for sale behind the bar feature an American flag and
say: ``Just Try To Burn This Flag.''
   The legionnaires in this Yakima Valley farm town of 3,300 look
upon Saddam as a sort of ultimate flag-burner.
   ``He appears to me to be a little Hitler,'' said Del St. George,
an apple grower who served in the Navy in World War II.
   ``I still have a boy who is 21, and grandsons coming up, and I
don't want to see those boys getting shot at,'' St. George said.
``But if they stomp him quick it won't take that long.''
   His opinions were shared by several legionnaires after a recent
monthly business meeting.
   The men gathered in the dark bar, with its neon jukebox,
television and games, were unanimous in their support of President
Bush and the U.S. military effort against Iraq.
   ``Most veterans would be supportive of what the president is
doing,'' said adjutant Jack Yearout. ``I would hope that the
American people would have the patriotism and guts to stand behind
the president.''
   Yearout compared Saddam to Hitler or Stalin.
   ``Anybody that would gas his own people and use gas against his
enemy in spite of the U.N. charter, has to be stopped,'' he said.
   Ron Butler, a former policeman who is post commander, said the
United States was morally obligated to support Kuwait.
   ``We will lose men, no doubt, but they would be crazy to start
actual combat with us,'' Butler said.
   Farley Bennett, a Coast Guard veteran, said it is important for
the nation to make sacrifices to stop Saddam now.
   ``I had two brothers in Korea and two sons and a brother in
Vietnam,'' Bennett said. ``We are hero-happy boys.
   ``I don't think this is going to end without conflict. There are
going to be some boys die on both sides, but at least we've got
world support.''

   Swing Era band leader Lionel Hampton
welcomed a service bringing together members of black and white
Masonic lodges as a strong step toward racial harmony.
   He said the event highlighted his 52 years as a Mason.
   ``This is love, peace and harmony _ breaking down prejudice and
kicking it in the pants,'' said the 82-year-old musician, keynote
speaker at the service Sunday. ``I've finally seen it come to pass
that the black and white brothers can meet together.''
   The two lodges, one with 28,000 whites and the other with 2,000
blacks, last year became the first in the United States to grant
mutual recognition and certain membership privileges to each other.
Recognition allows a Mason to participate in activities in another
jurisdiction.
   The Masons are a fraternal group with 3 million members in the
United States and 6 million worldwide.

<TEXT>
   The president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce
on Tuesday called for a ``political revolution'' to solve the
nation's budget problems.
   ``It's an issue of over spending,'' Richard L. Lesher told
reporters at a briefing on the chamber's legislative agenda.
``We've said so many times that to balance the budget, you don't
have to cut spending below current levels. You need to cut the
growth in spending ...''
   Bush administration and congressional negotiators met throughout
the weekend but were unable to meet their Monday deadline for
reaching agreement on a deficit-reducing package for the fiscal
year beginning Oct. 1.
   Without an agreement, next year's shortfall could surpass $250
billion, the highest ever, and result in severe spending cuts on
most federal programs under the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law.
   Lesher said ``the whole process is so politicized that it's time
for a political revolution, hopefully led by the business
community, to demand that the problem be solved the same way all of
us solve domestic budget problems or corporate budget problems _ by
keeping spending in line with revenue.''
   Among the items on the chamber's legislative wish-list are a
balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution and enactment of
line-item veto authority for the president.
   Under current law, the president must accept or reject in their
entirety each of the 13 appropriations bills. Line-item veto
authority would permit him to throw out specific portions of the
bills without vetoing the entire legislation.
   Lesher said the chamber is concerned about the effects of forced
budget cuts on an economy that the organization predicts will fall
into recession later this year.
   ``We think that ($100 billion in cuts) would be a lot to
swallow,'' he said.

but it's also a serious offer. Moving, the musicians say, would
solve their problems with the orchestra's management and board of
directors.
   Orchestra officials said Monday that the Philharmonic may not
open its fall season on time Sept. 22 because the musicians are
refusing to negotiate cost savings.
   The orchestra, which has been running a $2.2 million deficit,
asked its musicians in July to agree to a wage freeze, a smaller
orchestra size and a shorter season to help cut $1.3 million in
operating expenses.
   Musicians took up a collection last week to run the $300
classified ad in Friday's edition of USA Today.
   ``We're going to entertain any offers that come as a result of
the ad,'' says Frances Morgante, a violinist and chairwoman of the
musicians' negotiating team.
   ``We're a superb orchestra, and everybody admits that. But we
constantly have to justify our existence, and we're tired of it,''
added Susie Myers, an English horn player.
   Management and the Orchestra Committee, which represents the
musicians, have not met in two weeks, said Wilfred J. Larson, the
orchestra's chairman.
   ``If there are no talks, we've got to shut the thing down,''
Larson said.
   The musicians blame bloated front-office spending for the
orchestra's problems.
   Administrators blame the budgetary shortfalls on delayed and
reduced funding from the state, county and city, and stalled
development efforts.

<DATELINE>SHAALAN III CAMP, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For each refugee who clears the
Jordanian border from Iraq to wait for a flight home, another drags
into the makeshift camps in no man's land.
   Authorities predicted a turn of the tide Monday, with the
proviso that they could not predict the flow from Iraq. On Tuesday,
Maj. Sabri Rubeihat, the Jordanian spokesman at the border, said
3,000 Asians were processed but 3,000 more arrived.
   Perhaps 50,000 are backed up at the border, but officials admit
they are guessing. One of those still trapped in the refugee camps
is Mohammed Sana Ullah from Bangladesh.
   ``This is a prison camp,'' he said Tuesday, tears streaming down
his dusty cheeks as he spoke at the Shaalan III Camp. ``We're dying
in this desert.''
   ``It's still a nightmare,'' said Jim Nuttal of Save the
Children. ``People think it'll all go away, but it won't. This will
go on for months.''
   Nuttal manages this latest encampment, a cluster of tents on
raw, scorpion-infested desert. The Shaalan I and Shaalan II camps
also receive refugees _ mostly Asians _ who have made their way
Kuwait, where food shortages and scattered shooting are driving out
hundreds of thousands of foreign workers.
   Shaalan III is also called Mercy Camp, but many of the 5,000
Bangladeshis brought here over the past few days from overcrowded
Shaalan I say that is a bitter misnomer.
   Ullah, who left the Bangladesh Air Force to work as a contract
sergeant in Kuwait, cornered Nuttal to demand action. First he
talked tough, detailing his 15 days' wait in what he called hell.
   Nuttal was sympathetic.
   ``We will stop it,'' he said. ``I promise you, every bit of
energy ... ''
   That was as far as he got. Ullah's nerves cracked, and he wailed
out his anguish.
   Sobbing, shaking, he waved an arm toward the tents and trucks
and strewn garbage and shouted: ``I'd like to burn all these bloody
damned things!''
   Around him, a crowd of gesticulating refugees added their own
pleas. They said they had seen buses taking people directly from
Shaalan I to Amman, meaning later arrivals were getting out first.
   Even more than the scarce food and water, or the lack of
shelter, the camp dwellers railed at the uncertainty. No one knows
when they will leave.
   Ullah suffers from a thyroid condition and is out of medicine.
Camp doctors want him to see a specialist, but he's afraid of
missing the bus that might take him a step closer to home. He said
he has been here 15 days.
   Friends listened to his complaints and nodded. One just shook
his head and observed, ``Kuwait was much better than this.''
   When the wind blows, Shaalan III is obliterated by dust. The new
latrines stink from 100 yards away.
   But the most desperate refugees describe Shaalan III as
luxurious compared to Shaalan I, which still houses about 30,000
Indians, Bangladeshis, Sri Lankans, Filipinos and other penniless
refugees.
   Camp shelters are marked with bits of cardboard torn from boxes
with inscriptions noting arrival dates going back to late August.
   The bare ground is ankle deep in powdery dust and filth, nearly
carpeted with smashed plastic water bottles, rotten tomatoes and
rubber shoes too worn out to save.
   On Tuesday, lunchtime meant a three-hour wait in the sun for two
flat pieces of Arab bread, a few small tomatoes and a plastic cup
of yogurt. Dinner was another wait for similar fare.
   ``We wait for everything,'' said Tajdeen Rajmuhammed from
Madras, India. ``One hour for a liter of water. Can you wash in one
liter? We walk a kilometer to go the bathroom where no one can see
us.''
   Mostly, they wait for hope. Each new outsider is besieged with
questions: about buses, about other camps, about the whereabouts of
consular officers.
   International contributions are in the tens of millions of
dollars, and up to 30 special flights a day carry refugees home.
   Aide workers blame the huge backup on a combination of factors:
a proud kingdom that called too late for help; a United Nations
tangled in red tape; impoverished home governments; and rich
nations worried about other aspects of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Most of the refugees have begun appealing directly to television
news crews that make the seven-hour round trip from Amman.
   At Shaalan II, regarded as a model camp next to the others,
refugees have painted messages on sheet of cardboard affixed to
tents.
   Filipinos wrote a message to President Corazon Aquino: ``We need
airplanes, not sardines.''
   Next to it, another reads: ``We don't need promises. Just get us
out of here!''

   Owe-ree-owes are not cookies, hawn.
   In the city that natives call Bawlmer, Owe-ree-owes are Orioles.
   Baltimore has a curious mix of Southern, Northern, Pennsylvania
Dutch, Appalachian and various immigrant speech patterns. And
Bawlmerese is most apparent in its stressed ``o'' sound, heard in
words such as oweshun and awl _ that's ocean and oil.
   ``It's not fully Northern and not fully Southern,'' said Allan
Metcalfe, executive secretary of the American Dialect Society.
   ``For example, Baltimore is on the border of where `cot' and
`caught' are said the same,'' he said.
   Hon becomes hawn and the Highlandtown neighborhood is known as
Hollandtown.
   Speech pathologist Linda Katz Wilner, who helps people rid
themselves of accents, said the peculiar ``o'' sound is produced by
the forced, constricted method Baltimoreans use to produce vowel
sounds.
   ``People speak with a very closed mouth, a lot of tension in the
lips,'' Wilner said. ``They're really not even rounding their lips.
It's almost a pumping of the jaw.
   ``Certain other sounds are reduced,'' Wilner said. ``Like the
`oi' sound in boil. People say `ball the water.' It's a diphthong.
It's supposed to be two sounds and they make it into one. For
example, instead of `my mother,' they say `mamother.'''
   So, next time a Hollandtown hawn asks what you want with your
crab cake, say, ``I'll have a Cowe-oke, but make it quick because
I'm going downy oweshun.''

   Leaders of exiled Iraqi opposition groups
are meeting in Syria to develop a strategy for toppling Saddam
Hussein and hope to form a government-in-exile, dissident sources
said Tuesday.
   About 12 parties and organizations were represented at the
meeting, which began in the Syrian capital of Damascus in late
August and is expected to conclude in late September, the sources
said.
   ``We're basically trying to produce a political alternative to
the present regime,'' said a member of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, one of the two main Kurdish organizations, in an
interview from London.
   The dissident sources, all speaking on condition of anonymity
from Paris and London, said they hoped the meeting would conclude
with the formation of an Iraqi government-in-exile.
   A leader of the Iraqi Islamic Labor Party, Abdel-Ameer Kassem,
told the Saudi Arabian newspaper Al-Yawm that opposition factions
had also ``agreed on a joint plan to overthrow the regime of Saddam
Hussein.''
   But in interviews, other dissidents said they wanted substantial
international support before beginning an internal war against
Saddam.
   ``Kurds and others would love to open up an internal front
against Saddam, but this is not yet it. This is not a declaration
of all-out war inside Iraq,'' a Paris source said.
   ``We're fearful of incurring his wrath, having him turn his army
against us without having any outside support.''
   For decades, Kurdish guerrillas in northern Iraq waged a fierce
battle for autonomy against Saddam's troops. But in 1988, shortly
after Iraq and Iran ended their eight-year war, Saddam launched an
offensive against the rebels that included chemical weapons.
   It was the first time any government had been reported to have
used chemical weapons on its own people, and it forced the rebels
to pull back somewhat.
   The various Kurdish groups opposed to Saddam have an estimated
20,000 armed men. The Patriotic Union member said from London the
Kurds were ready to face even the horrors of chemical warfare
again, ``if we have some guarantees that after Saddam is gone we'll
have a role in the new government.''
   One source said ``there's a lot of potential for making
trouble'' for Saddam while his attention is turned to his standoff
with other nations resulting from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   ``It's not a question of numbers. These are trained and
experienced guerrillas and they could tie up a lot of Iraqi troops
if they chose to do so. They have not chosen to do so _ yet,'' the
source said.
   But the sources said the opposition inside Iraq is fragmented,
weak and deep underground, and much of the 16 million population
has been cowed.
   During a break in the Syrian meeting, Patriotic Union leader
Jalal Talabani visited Iraqi dissidents living in Arab, European
and U.S. cities in a renewed effort to organize the opposition.
   ``These are groups holding very diverse political ideas, and the
circumstances are not easy. It may take a little while to produce
the basic framework of the government we'd like to see,'' another
source said.

   Three teen-agers who continued to profess their
innocence received maximum prison sentences of five to 10 years
today for the rape and assault of a woman jogging in Central Park.
   ``Give me the max,'' one of the defiant youths, Yusef Salaam,
told Judge Thomas Galligan before sentence was passed. ``Sooner or
later the truth will come out.''
   Galligan, in turn, denounced the three for showing no remorse,
``only defiance.'' On the night the jogger was attacked, he said,
``Central Park was turned into a torture chamber by mindless
marauders seeking a thrill.''
   Although the youths were tried as adults because of the
seriousness of the charges, Galligan had to sentence them as
juveniles because they were under 16 when the jogger was attacked
on April 19, 1989. An adult would have faced up to eight and
one-third to 25 years in prison.
   Salaam and Antron McCray, both 16, and Raymond Santana, 15, were
convicted Aug. 18 of attacking the woman and assaulting two men the
same night. They were acquitted of the top count of attempted
murder and a lesser count of sodomy.
   ``The intensity of the violence that occurred that night is
something no rational mind can explain,'' the judge said.
   He denied motions to have the three sentenced in Family Court,
asking, ``Is sexual brutality of a woman something that's
acceptable or tolerable because it happens at the hands of a 14- or
15-year-old? The answer is obvious.''
   At the hearing, William Kunstler, an attorney for Salaam, called
the proceeding ``a legal lynching.''
   ``I don't expect anything to happen here other than the judge to
sign the maximum,'' he told Galligan. ``I'm so sure of it I've
already filled out appeal papers.''
   The teens were accused of raping and trying to kill the jogger,
then 28, during her nightly run in Central Park. She had lost at
least three-fourths of her blood and spent two weeks in a coma, a
doctor said. Jurors said later they acquitted the youths of the
attempted murder charge because they were unsure the teens intended
to kill the woman.
   She battled back from her near-fatal injuries, eventually
returning to her Wall Street firm, where she is now a vice
president. She has resumed jogging.
   The woman, whose name has been left out of news stories,
testified at the trial about her continuing vision, balance and
other problems; she has no memory of the attack.
   Each defendant spoke briefly before sentence was passed.
   Salaam read a rambling, rap-style poem he had composed in jail
before he was bailed out; during the reading, he stopped once to
glare at prosecutors.
   ``I have not yet begun to fight,'' he concluded. ``This is only
the beginning.''
   McCray told the judge, ``I'm not going to let this stop me. I'm
going to make it.''
   Santana, who struck the meekest tone of the three, said simply,
``Everyone knows I'm innocent of the crime. I never did it.''
   After the sentence was passed, they were quickly moved from the
courtroom by corrections officers as some spectators in the room
raised their arms in support.
   The attack horrified New Yorkers because of its randomness and
brutality, but it also became an inspiration to people who followed
accounts of her recovery.
   During the trial, a detective testified that Santana told him he
counted 33 youths who entered the park shortly after 9 p.m. the
night of the attacks to ```wild' some joggers ... beat up and rip
off joggers and cyclists.''
   Their first victim was Antonio Diaz, a man they referred to as
``the bum.'' Diaz was kicked and pummeled senseless before the
group accosted several bicycle riders. The bikers escaped injury.
   Statements made by the defendants figured prominently in the
trial. Defense lawyers argued that the statments were coerced.
   In a videotaped statement to police, McCray said that when the
youths saw the jogger on the East 102nd Street crossdrive during
her nightly six-mile run, ``We all charged her.''
   The defendants told detectives the naked woman was struck with a
metal pipe, bashed in the head and face with a brick, cut on the
legs with a knife and sexually attacked in a frenzy of violence,
prosecutors said.
   Later, the rampaging youths attacked several other people _
teacher John Loughlin, hospitalized for two days with his injuries;
banker David Lewis, who escaped serious injuries because of his
speed; and John Goode, a British Airways employee who was punched.
   The three defendants were convicted of assault and robbery in
the attack on Loughlin and of assaulting Lewis. They also were
convicted of first-degree riot.
   On Monday, Galligan on Monday set a trial date of Oct. 11 for
two other defendants, Kharey Wise, 18, and Kevin Richardson, 15.
The teen-agers will be tried together in Manhattan.
   Another defendant, Steve Lopez, 15, will be tried separately,
probably not until next year.

   Three Democrats bid for the prize of
Rhode Island's Democratic nomination for governor Tuesday, buoyed
by indications that any of them could defeat Republican Gov. Edward
D. DiPrete.
   The three were Providence Mayor Joseph R. Paolino Jr., Warwick
Mayor Francis X. Flaherty and businessman Bruce G. Sundlun, who
lost to DiPrete in 1986 and 1988.
   DiPrete also faced a primary, but the challenge by former radio
talk show host Steve White was considered minor.
   DiPrete, who two years ago enjoyed voter approval ratings
topping 70 percent, is reeling in the polls. His approval now
hovers around 20 percent and is sinking in concert with the New
England economy.
   ``I think it would take almost a miracle for him to come back,''
said Professor Darrell M. West, who conducts polls for Brown
University's A. Alfred Taubman Center for Public Policy.
   In the 2nd Congressional District, Democrat Edward P. Beard, a
former hosuepainter whose trademark was the brush he carried in a
coat pocket on Capitol Hill from 1975-80, tried to win his old seat
back.
   He faced a stiff challenge from state Sen. John F. Reed, who had
the Democratic endorsement, lawyer Charles Gifford III and state
Rep. Rodney Driver.
   In the Republican 2nd District primary, accountant David
Gingrella tried to portray environmentalist Trudy Coxe as an
opportunist who ran only at the governor's urging.
   The seat is open because Republican Rep. Claudine Schneider is
challenging 30-year veteran Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell.

<TEXT>
   With the Democrats smelling DiPrete's blood, they spent $6
million by Labor Day in one of the nastiest primary campaigns ever
waged in a state known for its down-and-dirty politics.
   Flaherty cast himself as the campaign's conscience while Paolino
and Sundlun tangled like Roman gladiators. Sundlun accused Paolino
of being a machine politician beholden to contributors. Paolino
shot back that Sundlun just hadn't won anything, and that he had
run the Outlet stores into the ground.

   Russia's parliament voted overwhelmingly Tuesday
for a radical economic reform program, and Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev said he favored it over a moderate plan proposed by
his prime minister.
   Gorbachev's surprise statement undercut the authority of Prime
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov and added momentum to calls for
Ryzhkov's resignation.
   It also increased the chances that the radical plan, drafted
largely by economist Stanislav Shatalin, will go into effect
throughout the Soviet Union.
   Shatalin's plan calls for transferring most economic authority
from the national government to the country's 15 constituent
republics. The republics could then move rapidly to free prices,
privatize government industries, legalize private ownership of land
and take other steps toward a market-based economy.
   The national Supreme Soviet legislature and the parliament of
Russia, the largest of the 15 republics, met separately Tuesday to
consider the competing proposals.
   Ryzhkov addressed the national legislature in a cavernous marble
hall at the Kremlin, the centuries-old walled fortress that is the
seat of communist power.
   He charged that the Shatalin plan would lower living standards
by 30 percent, force one out of every four collective farms into
bankruptcy, and cause rapid inflation by decontrolling prices on
about 75 percent of basic consumer products.
   Ryzhkov called for retaining central control over the economy
and making a much slower transition to a market-based system. He
recommended keeping price controls on most food and household
products while raising the cost of some major items, such as
televisions, radios and refrigerators.
   He also said imports of consumer goods and medicines would have
to be cut by one-third because of a shortage of hard currency, and
he warned that the government budget would have to be cut to
prevent the $96 billion deficit from ballooning.
   Ryzhkov's speech caused commotion in the hall as some delegates,
led by Anatoly Sobchak, the reformist mayor of Leningrad, demanded
copies of the Shatalin plan and the opportunity to adopt it.
   ``If you ask me, I like the Shatalin plan better,'' Gorbachev
told the delegates in an animated, 15-minute speech about the need
to stabilize the Soviet economy, which is plagued by shortages of
bread, meat, paper, gasoline, tobacco and other ordinary goods.
   ``If there is a real plan to stabilize finances, money
circulation, the ruble and the market, then we should adopt the
Shatalin idea,'' Gorbachev said.
   Pounding the back of his hand on the lectern, the 59-year-old
Soviet leader defended the concept of a free market, which is
little understood and much feared by ordinary Soviet citizens.
   When price controls are gradually lifted, he said, ``we'll have
real prices that will estimate who is worth what. Then powerful
stimuli will be released for structural changes.
   ``Of course these will be painful changes. But so be it,'' he
said.
   In an auditorium 1{ miles away, the Russian parliament voted
213-1 with four abstentions to adopt the Shatalin plan and warned
that if the national legislature did not follow suit, Russia would
proceed on its own.
   ``These are two programs that cannot be combined and cannot even
supplement each other. They proceed from completely different
political and economic assumptions,'' said Boris Yeltsin, president
of the Russian republic.
   ``And if the (Soviet) Union does not follow this program, we,
Russia, as a sovereign state, will take this route ourselves,'' he
said.
   Russia is one of 13 Soviet republics that have declared
independence or sovereignty, defined as the right to overrule
national laws.
   The debates in both the Russian parliament and the national
legislature were punctuated by calls for the resignation of
Ryzhkov, 60, and his entire Cabinet.
   There appeared to be strong support for such a motion in the
Russian parliament, especially after Yeltsin alleged that ``the
current government will not implement this (radical reform) plan.
They will sabotage it.'' However, Yeltsin persuaded the delegates
to wait to see whether the Supreme Soviet adopts the Shatalin plan.
   In the national legislature, the moves against Ryzhkov were
derailed for the day when the chairman, Anatoly Lukyanov, asked for
a vote on whether to put the prime minister's resignation on the
agenda.
   The motion failed, 328-28 with 30 abstentions. But a delegate
claimed that if Lukyanov had phrased the motion differently _ to
call for a vote of no confidence rather than resignation _ it would
have passed.
   Ryzhkov indicated that he might step aside if his plan is
defeated.
   ``I take responsibility for it before the people and the Supreme
Soviet,'' he said.
   Leading economists and politicians, including Sobchak, have
urged Ryzhkov to step down because of his failure to deal with the
nation's economic problems.
   The prime minister's standing also was hurt Tuesday by a
front-page article in the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that said
he had recently bought a luxurious country home, or dacha, from the
government for 47,000 rubles, a fraction of its real worth.
   In parliament, Ryzhkov denied the story, saying he did not own a
dacha but uses one owned by the government.

   Friends of a man who shot himself on the roof
of a high-rise building after a five-hour standoff with police say
the suicide could have been averted had they been allowed to talk
with him.
   Police disagreed.
   At least five people said they approached police during Friday's
standoff and asked to speak with Paul Fisher but weren't permitted
to do so.
   ``If they let one of us up to see him, the guy would be alive
now,'' said Dave Dietz. ``I feel it in my heart.''
   Police Chief Mayer DeRoy said Fisher didn't want to talk to
anyone but DeRoy and the police officers who were on the roof
trying to persuade him to surrender. Allowing friends on the roof
could have aggravated the situation and endangered the friends, the
chief said.
   ``Paul Fisher didn't want anyone up there to talk to,'' DeRoy
said. ``He made that eminently clear.''
   Fisher, 30, of Pittsburgh, fired at least 11 shots into the air
from the top of the apartment building during the standoff but no
one else was struck. He left a suicide note saying he hoped to draw
fire from police.
   Fisher's friends, speaking Monday at a pub frequented by Fisher,
said he would not have hurt them or anyone else.
   The friends added they could have spoken to Fisher by cellular
phone without being endangered.

<HEAD>Three Whites Charged in Beating Death of Black Youth</HEAD>

   Three white teen-agers have been
charged with murder and ethnic intimidation in the clubbing death
of a black Detroit teen-ager who returned a shouted insult while
riding through a suburb.
   Charles Gibson, 19, was a passenger Saturday in a car driven by
a white friend when a group of whites pulled along side in a pickup
truck, the friend said Monday.
   The white teen-agers yelled, ``Hey, nigger,'' and Gibson shouted
back, `Hey, honkie,'' said Timothy Lange, 20. He said Gibson and
the whites got out of the vehicles at a red light and a fight broke
out.
   A witness reported seeing Gibson hit about 25 times on the head
with a long wooden stick, said William Lucas, a police detective in
Roseville, a mostly white, lower-middle class suburb.
   Gibson died Sunday at the University of Michigan Medical Center.
   Raymond C. Morris, 17, of Fraser and John J. Whitman, 19, of
Roseville appeared in court Monday and were ordered jailed without
bond until hearings set for Sept. 20.
   A 14-year-old from Roseville was returned to the county youth
home, with bond set at $110,000.
   Morris and Whitman face life in prison if convicted as charged;
the other youth could be committed to the state Department of
Social Services until age 19.
   Gibson's mother said her son neither sought nor ducked trouble.
   ``He didn't like violence, but yet he didn't want people to push
him around and call him names,'' Jama Gunn said. ``He named his
left fist Smith &amp; Wesson. He named his right fist .38.''

   A slice of American life was served up to hungry
Muscovites Tuesday as Pizza Hut opened two restaurants in a city
that is no stranger to shortages.
   While housewives queued nearby for scarce foodstuffs and
consumer goods, hundreds of curious young people and families
waited patiently in line in cool weather for hours to sample
deep-pan pizzas, garlic bread, Pepsi and fare from what was billed
as the first Soviet salad bars.
   ``It's a piece of America,'' gushed Georg Tsukonov, a
20-year-old student, outside the new Pizza Hut on Kutuzovsky
Prospekt, the main road leading west from downtown.
   ``It looks like a museum,'' marveled sailor Yevgeni Gerko,
gazing at the bright red furnishings, brass trim, fake tropical
plants and smiling young waitresses.
   A large, deep-pan Super Supreme pizza with everything on it _
pepperoni, ham, spicy pork, beef, mushrooms, onions, black olives
and green peppers _ emerged from an oven at the restaurant at noon,
marking the official opening.
   Waiting customers clutching Pizza Hut flags emblazoned with the
company's red roof logo, the Stars and Stripes, and the hammer and
sickle, oohed and ahhed, then excitedly tried to rush the door.
   Throughout the day, Pizza Hut officials kept the doors locked
and struggled to limit entrance to only a handful of people at a
time.
   The Kutuzovsky site has two identical dining rooms, for
ruble-and dollar-paying customers, and a takeout counter. Located
near a large foreigners' compound on the wide boulevard that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev takes to work every day, it expects
to make 5,000 pizzas a day.
   The smaller Pizza Hut on Gorky Street, minutes from the Kremlin,
has a takeout window selling slices of pizza for rubles.
   The Moscow menus are similar to those in the West, with the
addition of local favorites like borscht and a Moscow seafood
pizza: salmon, smoked sardines and onions. Only nine combination
pizzas are offered and no substitutions are allowed.
   ``People don't know what the products are,'' said regional
operations director Andy Rafalet. ``Let's make the choice a little
easier.''
   The choice was easy at the salad bar: no lettuce, but lots of
cabbage, a Soviet staple. Pizza Hut claims it's the first Moscow
restaurant to serve coleslaw, as opposed to pickled, cooked or raw
cabbage.
   Student Irina Shushukina said beer was being limited to one
bottle a person, and wine to one bottle per couple.
   Despite chronic food shortages and a poor food distribution
system in the Soviet Union, Pizza Hut said it hopes to buy most of
its raw ingredients locally, including flour for the dough.
   The restaurants' 300 young employees were hired from 3,500
applicants who replied to an ad in the Moscow Communist Party youth
newspaper. Besides learning how to make and serve pizzas, most had
to be taught to smile at customers, not snarl or ignore them like
many Moscow restaurant workers.
   ``You'll never see so many smiles elsewhere in Moscow,''
Tsukonov said. ``Maybe they're pretending, but it's fantastic when
you see people really smile. You understand that you are something
in the world, not part of a crowd.''
   The restaurants are the result of three years' negotiations,
even though Pizza Hut's parent company Pepsico Inc. has been doing
business in the Soviet Union for decades.
   Pepsico chairman Don Kendall cajoled then-Soviet Premier Nikita
Khrushchev into tasting Pepsi at a 1959 trade fair. Photographs of
Khrushchev and then-U.S. Vice President Richard Nixon sipping Pepsi
from paper cups were published in newspapers throughout the world.
   Pizza Hut said it expects to serve 50,000 customers a week,
roughly seven times the turnover of any of its American outlets.
McDonald's, which introduced American-style fast food to the Soviet
Union in January, still sells about 5,000 burgers an hour.
   The restaurants are part of a $3 billion trade deal, the largest
ever signed between the Soviet Union and a U.S. corporation.

<HEAD>Prisons Will Temporarily Keep Inmates Away From Dog Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The practice of inmates wrestling and
fighting with tracking dogs at the end of training exercises was
temporarily halted Tuesday by the state prison board.
   Members of the Texas Board of Criminal Justice unanimously
approved the recommendations of a board subcommittee that the
``contact'' practice be suspended until inmates have more
protective gear and policies are in place to ensure that only
volunteers are used for the exercise.
   Inmates still would be used in other aspects of dog training.
   Until now, an inmate would be given a head start and go into
hiding or climb a tree, and then, when the inmate was located by
the dog, he would briefly fight with the animal.
   Several prison board members said there was no evidence that the
dog training exercises had been conducted improperly.
   The dog training came under fire after board Vice Chairman Jerry
Hodge took two companions on an inmate hunt for sport.
   Hodge later had jackets made for them that dubbed the trip ``The
Ultimate Hunt.'' He has since apologized for the jackets but has
defended the practice of using inmates in the exercise.
   The board approved a formal selection system for inmates who
want to get involved with the dog program, with assurances that the
inmates are not being coerced.
   The prison system has about 1,000 dogs at various units.

   Defense attorneys for a woman whose
murder of a teen-ager was videotaped had difficulty getting even
her mother to convince the court she should not be sent to the
electric chair.
   Carol Hunt testified she doesn't want her 21-year-old daughter,
Deidre, to be executed but ``if it happens, it happens.''
   The defense testimony Monday was followed Tuesday by
prosecutors' presentation of psychologists to address Deidre Hunt's
emotional stability.
   Earlier in the sentencing hearing, Gainesville psychologist
Clifford A. Levin testified for the defense that Ms. Hunt is an
emotionally damaged person who was threatened and controlled by her
former boss and lover, Konstantinos Fotopoulos, 31.
   Ms. Hunt has been convicted of first-degree murder in the
shooting deaths of Mark Ramsey, 19, and Bryan Chase, 18. Police say
Chase was betrayed and killed after shooting Lisa Fotopoulos, who
survived her wounds and divorced her husband, Konstantinos.
   Circuit Judge James Foxman and the court last week viewed a
57-second videotape showing Ms. Hunt on Oct. 20, 1989, shooting a
teen-ager tied to a tree. Assistant State Attorney David Damore
said it was the execution of Ramsey, filmed by Fotopoulos.
   The judge also saw a videotape of Ms. Hunt's confession to
police when she was arrested in November. In it, she also admitted
to the murder-for-hire plot against Lisa Fotopoulos, which led to
Ms. Hunt's conviction for attempted murder and conspiracy, and
pending charges against Fotopoulos.
   The testimony of Ms. Hunt's mother and that of several aunts,
uncles and cousins focused on emotional and physical trauma they
say Deidre Hunt suffered. This included being raped at 11 by a
neighbor and being rejected by her biological father.
   Carol Hunt, 43, admitted shaking and hitting her daughter as a
youngster whenever she felt like it.
   ``It depended on my mood _ whether I hit her or hugged her,''
Mrs. Hunt testified.
   ``I ignored that she told me a 30-year-old man raped her at
11,'' Carol Hunt testified.

<DATELINE>TEHRAN, Iran (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's leaders are tight-lipped about
whether they will help their old adversary Iraq break U.N.
sanctions. But analysts believe Tehran won't risk international
outcry even though it wants an agreeable Iraq on its border.
   After talks with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, the first
senior official to visit Tehran in 15 years, the government
announced Monday it would revive full diplomatic relations with its
former war foe.
   Aziz is believed to have requested that Iran allow food,
medicine and other essential commodities to move across its
730-mile border with Iraq in violation of the international embargo
imposed on Baghdad for its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Iranian newspapers have argued that the country would not
violate the sanctions by supplying food and medicine because
humanitarian aid is permitted under the U.N. Security Council
resolution imposing the embargo.
   Unconfirmed reports from Baghdad said the Iranians already have
allowed rice, flour and wheat across the northern border.
   Western analysts believe Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani is
keeping everyone guessing on what Iran will do in hopes of striking
a bargain with the West in return for adhering to the embargo. Such
a deal could include financial aid for Iran, they say.
   A diplomat in Tehran, speaking on condition of anonymity, said:
``Whenever we've tried to analyze their situation logically we
found we were invariably on the wrong track.''
   However, a Western economic expert in Tehran, also speaking on
condition of anonymity, said smuggling along the frontier was
difficult to control and was certain to pick up as Iranians cash in
on Iraq's burgeoning black market.
   ``Anything more substantial than that would be politically and
economically dangerous for Iran because it would give the
international community the idea that they were subverting U.N.
sanctions,'' he said.
   Shaul Bakhash, a professor of history at Washington's George
Mason University, said in a telephone interview: ``It defies logic
that the Iranians would do anything to help Iraq consolidate their
hold over Kuwait.''
   Bakhash, an Iranian exile and former Tehran newspaper editor,
has written extensively on Iran.
   Aziz's visit and the restoration of full ties came three weeks
after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, under increasing pressure
from the buildup of U.S.-led forces in the gulf, caved in to
Iranian conditions to formally end the nations' 1980-88 war.
   Iraq granted Tehran partial control of its sole access to the
sea and withdrew its troops from Iranian territory seized during
the war.
   ``The Iranians have followed a clever policy of taking
everything that came their way since the invasion of Kuwait,'' said
another diplomat in Tehran. ``But they're fully aware that if
Saddam were to survive this crisis he would not want to share his
power in the gulf with anyone and that they could be next on his
hit list.''
   He cautioned against forming hard conclusions on Iranian
intentions because it was impossible to speculate on
behind-the-scenes maneuvering among members of the country's ruling
theocracy.
   Before Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, Iranian foreign exchange
earnings, desperately needed to revive its moribund economy, were
expected to fall short by at least one-third of the $17 billion
needed in 1990, according to Western estimates.
   But this was revised sharply upward after the price of oil,
Iran's principal export item, soared following the Iraqi invasion.
Experts now say revenues could reach $19 billion this year.
   That would strengthen Rafsanjani's hand against Iran's radicals,
his political rivals, who are bitterly opposed to his reforms and
efforts to re-establish ties with the West.

   Entertainer Shirley MacLaine says she is
scaling down her dancing and adding more singing to her repertoire
as age takes its toll.
   ``It's real life that's a problem. I can't run for a cab in the
rain in the streets of New York anymore,'' the 56-year-old Miss

   After 40 movies, five TV specials, six books and a half-century
of dancing, Miss MacLaine said on the new syndicated TV show
``Personalities'' that it was time to limit her activities.
   ``I think I'll just scale down the dancing,'' she said in the
interview broadcast Monday. ``It isn't that direly necessary to me.
At this stage, I think it's bombastic because of my age you can
still do this stuff.
   ``But I think I'll just pare down as age creeps up. I'll sing
more. I'll bring acting to song and acting to dance. I've got it
mapped out so I won't be a blithering idiot if I can't dance
anymore.''

<HEAD>Military Called in to Search Woods for Evidence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Investigators seeking the killer of
five college students called for military help Tuesday to comb 10
square miles of woodland where a suspect reportedly went on
nighttime ``reconnaissance missions.''
   Authorities would say only that they have a ``good idea'' of
what they are looking for, and that the search could strengthen or
weaken the case against 18-year-old University of Florida freshman
Edward Lewis Humphrey.
   ``This is based upon some information that he enjoyed being in
the woods, that he may have camped out, and enjoyed being solitary
in wooded areas,'' said police spokeswoman Lt. Sadie Darnell. ``We
don't want any information to go unchecked.''
   Several hundred members of the Florida National Guard, along
with reserve Army and Navy units, were being called up to assist in
the search of several heavily wooded, marshy areas around
Humphrey's apartment in southwest Gainesville.
   Alachua County Sheriff's Lt. Spencer Mann said the search could
begin as early as Thursday.
   Metal detectors, dog teams and deep-woods experts also will be
used.
   Mann again emphasized that Humphrey is only one of eight
suspects in the five gruesome slayings of the students. Four were
enrolled at the University of Florida, the fifth victim was a
student at Santa Fe Community College.
   ``This search does not denote that Edward Humphrey is `the'
suspect, and the only suspect,'' he said. ``A lot of resources have
been poured into suspects just as important as him.''
   Humphrey became a suspect in the slayings through a canvass of
the off-campus student apartment areas where the victims lived.
   People told investigators Humphrey was a volatile person with
emotional problems who wore military fatigues, had a fascination
for knives and went into the woods on nighttime ``reconnaissance
missions,'' police have said.
   Humphrey was jailed in lieu of $1.1 million bail in Brevard
County on charges in the Aug. 30 beating of his grandmother, an
October 1988 armed burglary and attempted rape in Indian River
County, and an Aug. 25 assault on two male UF students.
   Genetic tests were being run on blood and semen samples.
   The DNA analysis could take weeks, police said.
   Police balked at saying the semen indicated the victims had been
sexually assaulted.
   The nude, mutilated bodies of Sonya Larson, 18, and Christina
Powell, 17, were found Aug. 26 in their apartment. The next
morning, Christa Hoyt, 18, was found decapitated in her nearby
duplex. Manuel Taboada, and Tracy Paules, both 23, were found dead
Aug. 28 in another nearby apartment.
   Investigators have described the killer as shrewd and
methodical. They have reportedly said he left taunting ``messages''
to them, arranged body parts at the slaying scene for maximum shock
value, and enjoyed the power he's had over the life of this college
town.

<HEAD>Panel Opposes Anti-Obscenity Curbs on Arts Endowment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bipartisan study commission on Monday urged
Congress not to impose new anti-obscenity restrictions on the
National Endowment for the Arts, declaring that Americans must
``put up with much we do not like'' to preserve freedom of artistic
expression.
   The 12-member panel also urged NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer
to scrap a controversial requirement that grant recipients sign a
pledge that they will not use federal money to produce works that
might be deemed obscene.
   Frohnmayer has repeatedly resisted demands that he eliminate the
pledge, which has created a furor in the arts community, until
federal courts rule on lawsuits challenging its constitutionality.
He refused comment on the commission's report.
   At the same time, the commission proposed a major overhaul of
the endowment's grant-making procedures to ensure that the NEA
serves the interests of the American public and not a narrow
constituency of artists.
   The panel concluded that ``the endowment is not, in setting
policy and making grants, adequately meeting its public
responsibilities at the present time'' as steward of taxpayer funds.
   It proposed that the NEA chairman be given sole, explicit
authority to make final grant decisions and that the growing power
of ``peer review panels'' that select grant applications for
approval be diminished to an advisory role.
   The 94-page report of the commission, established by Congress
last fall, drew mixed reviews from lawmakers trying to negotiate a
compromise bill that would extend the endowment's life beyond Sept.
30, when its statutory authority expires.
   Rep. Tom Coleman, R-Mo., applauded the report as a possible
framework for a compromise, but criticized the panel for rejecting
his proposal to shift as much as 60 percent of federal grant money
to the control of state arts agencies.
   Coleman also served notice that the House probably will ignore
the commission's plea and approve some sort of ban on federal
subsidies for pornographic or blasphemous art, even if it only
embraces the Supreme Court's guidelines on obscenity.
   The commission, appointed by President Bush and the House and
Senate leadership, said it unanimously opposed legislative curbs on
the content of works financed by the arts endowment.
   ``Content restrictions may raise serious constitutional issues,
would be inherently ambiguous and would almost certainly involve
the endowment and the Department of Justice in costly and
unproductive lawsuits,'' the panel said.
   Instead, it suggested that Congress approve a ``preamble'' to
the NEA reauthorization bill declaring simply that the endowment
``serves all of the people'' and ``reflects the high place the
nation accords to the fostering of mutual respect for the disparate
beliefs and values among us.''
   The commission added: ``Maintaining the principle of an open
society requires all of us, at times, to put up with much we do not
like, but the bargain has proved in the long run a good one.''
   The independent panel was created in October to examine NEA
operations. At the same time, at the urging of Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., Congress amended the endowment's $171 million budget to
prohibit using federal funds for works that ``may be considered
obscene.''
   Conservative lawmakers and religious fundamentalists were
angered by NEA grants for exhibitions of works by photographer
Robert Mapplethorpe, which contained sexually graphic images, and
by artist Andres Serrano, which they denounced as sacrilegious.
   The commission's report concluded with an appeal for a dampening
of the emotionalism and partisan sniping over the endowment, which
co-chairman Leonard Garment, a Washington lawyer, called ``an
American treasure very much worth preserving.''
   ``There are many individuals on both sides of the current debate
who think the endowment a convenient and newsworthy vehicle to
advance their own objectives,'' the panel said.
   ``Some do not care a great deal about whether the agency
survives. America has had more than enough of this uncompromising
kind of behavior.''

<TEXT>
   A lobbyist on Tuesday defended his efforts to
help a client win a lucrative government-subsidized takeover of 15
savings and loans and said he was under attack chiefly because he
used to work for George Bush.
   ``I am proud of my service in the public and private sectors,''
Robert J. Thompson told the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on
business rights. ``I would do nothing to dishonor this record. I
have done nothing to dishonor this record.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, chairman of the subcommittee,
said lobbyists' practice of selling access to government officials
``goes directly to the heart of the simmering frustration people
are feeling about Washington and its ways, as well as the boiling
outrage they are expressing about the savings and loan debacle.''
   Metzenbaum and other senators questioned Thompson about what he
did to help James Fail, a Phoenix investor, take over the 15 Texas
savings and loans for a $1,000 cash outlay and win well over $1.8
billion in federal subsidies.
   As a result of those subsidies, Metzenbaum said, the Bluebonnet
Savings Bank of Dallas that grew out of the takeover is the
nation's most profitable savings and loan.
   Metzenbaum suggested Fail bought Thompson's assistance because
of Thompson's associations with high officials.
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, asked whether there was anything out
of the ordinary in how he dealt on behalf of Fail.
   ``No, sir. Nothing at all,'' Thompson replied. ``The process
that resulted in the creation of the Bluebonnet Savings Bank was
conducted with and supervised by officials of the federal
government and I fully followed all rules of propriety.''
   He added: ``I feel very strongly one reason I am here was that I
used to work for George Bush.'' Thompson was an adviser to Bush
when he was vice president, and also served for a time as an
assistant to President Reagan.
   If Bluebonnet continues to prosper, Thompson and his company
stand to gain, in addition to their retainer and hourly fees, 2
percent of Fail's earnings from the savings and loan plus a
$160,000 bonus.
   The subcommittee began looking into Fail's takeover after
disclosures that he was able to do it with only $1,000 cash out of
pocket and $70 million of loans from insurance companies he
controlled. During the investigation, the panel learned that Fail
had not disclosed that he had entered a guilty plea to a fraud
indictment against one of his corporations.
   Federal regulators have testified since that the plea should
have disqualified Fail from taking over the savings and loans.
Those regulators, led by M. Danny Wall, who headed the now-defunct
Federal Home Loan Bank Board, said they did nothing special for
Thompson.
   ``We've learned enough about the Bluebonnet deal to know that
all was not negotiated on the up and up,'' Metzenbaum said. If
regulators subjected other takeover deals completed in 1988 to the
same scrutiny given Bluebonnet and took appropriate action, he
said, ``billions of dollars will be recouped for the U.S.
treasury.''

   A district court on Tuesday sentenced a
19-year-old Soviet hijacker to four years in prison.
   Mikhail Mokretsov had surrendered to police after forcing a
domestic Soviet airliner to Stockholm in July.
   The prosecutor asked that Mokretsov be expelled to the Soviet
Union after serving his sentence. The court rejected the plea,
saying Mokretsov was only 18-years-old at the time of the hijacking
and that it was unlikely he would commit other crimes in Sweden.
   Thomas Rothpfeffer, Mokretsov's attorney, said he was
``satisfied and relieved'' that the court decided not to expel his
client. But he said the sentence was too harsh considering his
client's age and the circumstances.
   Mokretsov was one of three young Soviets who hijacked airliners
to Sweden in June and July. Courts extradited the other two
Soviets, saying Sweden should not become a haven for hijackers.
   For humanitarian reasons, Mokretsov was not sent back. He had
gone on a hunger strike, saying he would rather die in Sweden than
be jailed in the Soviet Union.

   Three defiant teen-agers, including one who
challenged the judge to ``Give me the max,'' received maximum
sentences Tuesday of five to 10 years in prison for the rape and
assault of a woman jogger in Central Park.
   Judge Thomas Galligan denounced the three for showing only
defiance. He described them as ``mindless marauders seeking a
thrill'' who turned the park into a torture chamber.
   Although the seriousness of the charges allowed the youths to be
tried as adults, Galligan had to sentence them as juveniles because
they were under age 16 when the jogger was attacked. An adult would
have faced up to eight and one-third to 25 years in prison.
   If their appeals fail, the youths will be eligible for parole in
five years.
   Yusef Salaam and Antron McCray, each 16, and Raymond Santana,
15, were convicted Aug. 18 of attacking the woman and assaulting
two men during a ``wilding'' spree that night. They were acquitted
of the top count of attempted murder and a lesser count of sodomy.
   The jogger, an investment banker, was attacked on April 19,
1989, while running in a relatively isolated section of Central
Park.
   Race _ she was white, her alleged attackers were black or
Hispanic _ and the city's growing concern with street crime made
the case a sensation.
   The woman, then 28, suffered brain damage, lost at least
three-fourths of her blood and spent two weeks in a coma, doctors
said. The woman, whose name has been left out of news reports,
testified that she has continuing vision, balance and other
problems, and has no memory of the attack.
   She battled back from her near-fatal injuries, eventually
returning to her Wall Street firm, where she is now a vice
president. She also has resumed jogging.
   Each of the youths addressed the court before Galligan sentenced
them.
   Salaam was the most defiant. He read a rambling, rap-style poem
he said he had composed in jail before he was bailed out.
   ``I look upon this legal lynching as a test by my God Allah,''
he told Galligan. ``I and many others know I told the truth. I
would never disrespect my own religion by lying.''
   ``Give me the max,'' he said. ``Sooner or later the truth will
come out.''
   McCray told the judge: ``I'm not going to let this stop me. I'm
going to make it.''
   Santana, whose tone was the mildest, said simply: ``Everyone
knows I'm innocent of the crime. I never did it.''
   Before he announced the sentence, Galligan said that ``the
intensity of the violence that occurred that night is something no
rational mind can explain.''
   He denied motions to have the three sentenced in Family Court,
saying: ``Is sexual brutality of a woman something that's
acceptable or tolerable because it happens at the hands of a 14- or
15-year-old? The answer is obvious.''
   Salaam had a new attorney at the sentencing: William Kunstler,
who implied that the defendants' videotaped confessions were
coerced: ``We all know what black youths in back rooms will say to
white cops.''
   ``I don't expect anything to happen here other than the judge to
sign the maximum,'' he told Galligan. ``I'm so sure of it I've
already filled out appeal papers.''
   During the trial, a detective testified that Santana told him he
counted 33 youths who entered the park the night of the attacks to
`` `wild' some joggers ... beat up and rip off joggers and
cyclists.''
   McCray said on videotape that when the youths saw the jogger
during her nightly six-mile run, ``We all charged her.''
   He said she struggled and screamed while several teen-agers
dragged her down a wooded slope into the darkness.
   On his tape, Santana admitted holding and kicking the woman and
feeling her breasts while others raped her.
   McCray said he kicked her, then held for the others. When it was
his turn, McCray said, he feigned the sex act to impress his
buddies.
   The defendants told detectives the naked woman was struck with a
metal pipe, bashed in the head and face with a brick, cut on the
legs with a knife and sexually attacked in a frenzy of violence,
prosecutors said.
   Galligan has set a trial date of Oct. 11 for two other
defendants, Kharey Wise, 18, and Kevin Richardson, 15. Another
defendant, Steve Lopez, 15, will be tried separately next year.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's nuclear power industry
costs too much to run and has little chance of survival after
unification, West Germany's environment minister said Tuesday.
   The minister, Klaus Toepfer, repeated earlier assessments that
East German nuclear standards are below those of the West.
   He told a Bonn news conference it would be an expensive and long
procedure to bring the East German plants up to European standards.
   The Soviet Union had supplied East Germany with the technology
to build nuclear power plants.
   East Germany has one operating reactor at a plant at Greifswald,
in the northern part of the country. Construction at another
nuclear power plant has been halted.
   Faulty design and human error were responsible for the 1985
Chernobyl nuclear disaster in the Soviet Union. It caused extreme
panic in West Germany, where the anti-nuclear movement is very
strong.
   East Germany derives 10 percent of its electricity from nuclear
power.

   A boy whose father set him on fire in
1983 said Tuesday he was glad his father was thrown back into
prison on parole violation charges eight months after his release.
   ``I was just glad they caught him and he was a couple hundred
miles away,'' said 14-year-old David Rothenberg. He learned of
Monday's news when his mother picked him up from the high school he
attends.
   ``If they didn't catch him, I'd be scared, but I think after
this he should be put in prison for life,'' David said.
   Charles Rothenberg was headed to a job interview in Oakland on
Monday when he ducked out of a doughnut shop and eluded a parole
agent who was watching him. Rothenberg was picked up without
resistance four hours later.
   ``He deliberately violated his parole,'' said Tipton Kindel, a
spokesman for the California Department of Corrections. ``We don't
know why he would jeopardize what freedom he had to live on the
outside ... but it was a big mistake on his part.''
   Rothenberg, 50, will remain at San Quentin prison until a
hearing, which must be held within 60 days, Kindel said. If it is
found there was a violation, he could be sentenced to 30 days to a
year.
   Rothenberg was placed on three years' parole after he served six
years and five months of his 13-year sentence.
   He was convicted of attempted murder, arson and other charges
for pouring kerosene over his son and setting the boy on fire.
David, who was 6 at the time, was severely disfigured from
third-degree burns over 90 percent of his body. The 1988 ABC-TV
movie ``David'' depicted the attack.
   Rothenberg and the boy's mother were living separately in New
York. Rothenberg took the boy to California for a vacation and set
fire to David after his wife told him in a telephone conversation
that he would not be able to see the boy again.
   After Rothenberg left prison in January, at least one parole
officer followed him at all times. He described himself as ``the
most-watched man in America.''
   Kindel said Rothenberg had not caused any problem during his
parole before Monday. ``He'd been abiding by the rules, keeping a
low profile and trying to obtain employment,'' Kindel said.
   After slipping out of the doughnut shop, Rothenberg phoned
another agent to say he would go to a scheduled job interview. When
he arrived, about 11:30 a.m., he was arrested.

<HEAD>Added Tension for Congressman: Son Is a Paratrooper in Saudi
Arabia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Jerry Costello finally heard from his son
last week. It was a note about the sun and sand on the other side
of the world _ in Saudi Arabia.
   The Illinois Democrat's 21-year-old son, Army paratrooper Jerry
Costello II, is a member of the U.S. military force in the Middle
East, a job that makes the Persian Gulf crisis a personal one for
the congressman and his family.
   In advance of President Bush's speech to Congress Tuesday on the
Mideast situation, Costello said he would be listening with special
interest.
   ``I'll be thinking about one soldier over there in particular,''
Costello said.
   His son has been abroad for more than a month, but like many
other families the father heard from the son only a few days ago.
   ``Basically the message was the conditions are not the
greatest,'' Costello said. ``But he's doing as well as the other
soldiers. He spent 95 percent of the letter telling us not to worry.
   ``When he sleeps, the soldiers try to get to the closest piece
of concrete because the concrete is cooler at night. It took him a
little while to get adjusted to the heat,'' Costello said.
   ``While they're working long hours,'' he added, ``it's still
very boring. The major problem they are confronting right now is
sitting in limbo not knowing what's going to happen.''
   Costello's son is in the Army's 82nd Airborne, based at Fort
Bragg, N.C.
   The congressman said the Army had refused to confirm his son's
deployment, but when thousands of paratroopers were sent to the
Persian Gulf in early August, he was certain Jerry II was part of
the group.
   The letter reached the family's Belleville, Ill., home Thursday.
   Costello said his daily routine hasn't changed much, but he and
his wife, Georgia, watch a lot of news as they try to catch the
developments in the Middle East.
   Constituents in his district have given him and his family ``a
very warm response.''
   ``On Labor Day, I walked in two parades and it was very touching
for me to hear the support,'' Costello said. ``In a grocery store,
a gasoline station _ people just want us to know they're keeping
our son in their prayers.''
   Although he's in Congress, Costello said his position doesn't
give him an advantage over others worried about sons, daughters or
spouses sent to the region.
   Several lawmakers have visited the soldiers in Saudi Arabia, but
Costello said he did not ask them to do any favors for his family.
As a courtesy, however, he was invited two weeks ago to a White
House briefing held by Bush.
   Costello recently bid farewell to about 200 soldiers deployed
from Scott Air Force Base, which is in his district.
   ``It was important for the parents to know they are not the only
ones affected,'' Costello said. ``Their U.S. congressman is, too.''

<HEAD>Violence Flares in Lobstermen's Territorial Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lobstermen are feuding again in the rich
lobster-fishing areas of Casco Bay, and in one dispute two
fishermen were tossed in the harbor, a gun was brandished and a
boat damaged.
   ``It's a territorial dispute,'' Maine Marine Patrol Lt. Joseph
Fessenden said Tuesday. ``It's a situation where there's a limited
area of space to fish.
   ``The lobstermen are competing for the same area and we've had a
situation where they've been cutting each other's traps,'' he said.
``There have been several lobstermen who've lost several thousand
dollars worth of traps. This has been happening throughout the
summer.''
   Discontent has been high among Maine's estimated 4,000 full-time
lobstermen. Strikes throughout the summer protested prices being
paid for lobster catches.
   Softshell lobsters often have sold for as low as $1.75 to $1.85
a pound wholesale this summer, said Bob Brown, president of the
Maine Import-Export Lobster Dealers Association. He said this price
resulted from supply and demand. Maine harvested about 22 million
pounds of lobster in 1988, 24 million in 1989 and this year's
prediction is 26 million pounds.
   Under pressure to maintain their income, the dozen boat crews
feuding in Portland Harbor have been suspicious of others taking
more than their fair share, Fessenden said.
   ``They call this area `the Bay of Pigs' and this is one of the
reasons,'' he said.
   Lobstermen have their own specially marked buoys attached to a
line of lobster traps. Every day, they travel through their
territory, stopping at each of their buoys to haul up their lines,
empty the traps, put in new bait and dump them back in the water.
   On Monday, a dispute between the captains of two boats, the B&amp;B
and the Rambler, turned violent in what Fessenden described as the
worst confrontation he has seen in 15 years as a Marine Patrol
officer.
   Fessenden said the B&amp;B pulled alongside the Rambler as its
captain, Matthew Chipman, 28, of Portland, was trying to pull up a
string of traps that had been cut.
   Norman Solak, 52, a longtime lobsterman from West Buxton, and
one of his crew, Edward Mains Jr., 36, of Gorham, boarded the
Rambler, Fessenden said.
   The two crews struggled, he said, and Solak and Mains were
thrown into the harbor.
   Fessenden said the Rambler's crew charged later in a radio call
to the Coast Guard that one of the B&amp;B's crew brandished a gun.
   The Marine Patrol and the Coast Guard confiscated three weapons
from the B&amp;B: a .30-caliber rifle, a .22-caliber handgun and a
.38-caliber handgun.
   One of the boats also was damaged in the confrontation, said a
Marine Patrol officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Fessenden said the Marine Patrol is investigating whether to
file criminal charges against the crews involved.
   ``It's highly illegal to molest another man's gear,'' said David
Dow, executive director of the Lobster Institute, a cooperative
research program at the University of Maine at Orono. ``It's an
automatic, three-year license suspension for anybody caught doing
it.
   ``But territoriality has been around for as long as anybody can
remember,'' Dow said. ``It's rare that you see a territorial
dispute flare up in this overt fashion. Most of the territorial
disputes are only handled in the thick fog and the black of night.''

<HEAD>Germanys Agree to Limit Western Intelligence Control of Stasi
Records</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany's intelligence agency cannot
freely pore over the files of 6 million East Germans compiled by
the former Communist regime, both nations agreed Tuesday.
   However, officials did not decide if the files could be moved to
what is now West Germany, an issue that has obsessed East Germans
as they prepare to unite with their Western neighbor Oct. 3.
   About 22 activists, some of whom helped lead the peaceful revolt
that toppled the Communist regime last autumn, have been occupying
the building where the files are kept.
   They are demanding that East Germans get to see information kept
on them by the former secret police, known as the Stasi, and that
the files remain in East German territory.
   Top officials from both Germanys agreed Tuesday only that the
records will not be merged with those of the West German secret
service.
   ``The Stasi files may not be used as regular working materials
by the secret service,'' said Guenther Krause, top aide to East
German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere.
   Krause spoke after a meeting with Rudolf Seiters, West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, and West German Interior
Minister Wolfgang Schaueble.
   A treaty laying the groundwork for unification calls for the
fate of the files to be decided by a united parliament being
elected Dec. 2.
   Critics say that ultimately will mean that West Germans, who
will dominate the new government, will have the final say over the
secret records of East Germans. East Germany's Parliament has yet
to vote on the unity treaty, and many lawmakers are demanding a
change in that provision.
   Any rule allowing East Germans to look at files must also apply
to West Germans, Krause said, since 2 million Western citizens are
believed to have files in the Stasi archives.
   Krause said the possibility of destroying files also must be
discussed and that he believed an overall agreement could be
reached this week.
   The files give a glimpse of a nation in the grip of a paranoid,
oppressive regime and contain intimate details of the personal
lives of both prominent people and average citizens.
   Because each file on one individual could contain up to 60 other
names, some officials are worried that granting someone access to a
file will give him or her information about many others.
   Western intelligence agencies are believed to be anxious to
disseminate the information compiled by the Stasi, which of all
Communist intelligence agencies was second only to the Soviet KGB
in skill and global reach.
   There have been reports, however, that some of the most
sensitive records were destroyed by the Stasi in the waning days of
the former Communist regime.
   East German Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel, constantly
under fire for the scores of former Stasi employees still working
in his agency, fired eight ex-secret police officials on Tuesday,
according to the East German news agency, ADN.
   Six of them were on a list published during the weekend of 150
reputed former Stasi agents still working in the government. The
list was published by the West German tabloid Bild.
   Fourteen people on the list purportedly worked in the East
German press center and the office of government spokesman Matthias
Gehler. Gehler said Tuesday that four are no longer with the press
department and 10 have been given leaves of absence.

<HEAD>Swiss Bank to Guarantee Portion of City Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swiss bank will guarantee part of the $375
million Philadelphia is seeking to keep from going broke, but not
as much as city officials had hoped.
   Swiss Bank Corp. said Monday it will back $50 million of the
temporary loan notes the administration of Mayor W. Wilson Goode is
trying to sell to raise cash.
   ``We could be willing to take $50 million, and to the extent we
got other banks (to guarantee other portions of the loan), the
amount of the letter of credit would go up from there,'' said John
P. Chamales, Swiss Bank first vice president.
   The bank was prepared to issue a letter of credit for as much as
$225 million if other banks assume the risk for the other $175
million, he said.
   A letter of credit would guarantee the notes will be repaid and
would aid the city in marketing the loan notes.
   The city would have to pay higher interest on notes issued
without a guarantee.
   City officials and a financial team headed by Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets were trying to persuade at least two other banks to
guarantee additional notes.
   Quoting unidentified sources, The Philadelphia Inquirer said
Tuesday city leaders are talking with Union Bank of Switzerland and
National Westminister Bank of London about joining Swiss Bank.
   Four local banks last week rejected a city request that each of
them guarantee $15 million in notes.
   The mayor has said the city will be out of cash by late this
month unless it receives a cash infusion. The notes would be repaid
from property and business tax receipts expected early next year.
   Even with the temporary notes, the city projects a $206.4
million deficit in the $2.1 billion general fund budget by June 30,
1991.

<HEAD>Barbara Bush Praises Kitty Dukakis for Writing `Painful' Book</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush says Kitty Dukakis would have
made ``a great first lady'' and deserves credit for writing so
frankly about her personal struggle with drugs and alcohol.
   Mrs. Bush praised the Massachusetts governor's wife for writing
``a very painful book'' with ``no meanness.''
   The first lady said she read Mrs. Dukakis' autobiography, ``Now
You Know,'' cover to cover in a day-and-a-half on her Maine
vacation.
   ``She tried to write about a really big problem she had ... very
honestly and very sincerely'' without casting blame on her
politician husband or anyone else, Mrs. Bush said.
   Dukakis was the Democrats' losing candidate in the 1988
presidential contest against Bush.
   ``She loves her husband,'' said Mrs. Bush. ``She looked all
around for someone to blame and she blamed herself, and she says it
would have happened win or lose, with any little thing that had
come up.''
   ``I think she would have made a great first lady,'' said Mrs.
Bush, who has sent Mrs. Dukakis a note expressing those sentiments.
   The book ``makes you also think he's a pretty nice fellow,'' she
said softly.
   ``People wonder how he could not have not known,'' she said.
   But defending Dukakis, she added, ``I've known a lot of people
who had this problem and the truth is men or women don't want to
know. And the other truth is that addicted people hide. Alcoholics
can hide it.''
   ``People have to understand that those things are not just
obvious to the person who's married to them. It should be, but
isn't,'' said Mrs. Bush.
   She said Kitty Dukakis' story puts the lie to the notion that
``an addicted person can't produce.''
   ``I remember George had someone work in his office a thousand
years ago that he discovered was an alcoholic. He'd produced for
years,'' said Mrs. Bush.
   ``It was one of the nicest things George Bush ever did. First of
all he went home with the man to tell his wife, which was over and
above and beyond the line of duty,'' she said. ``His wife said,
`Thank God somebody noticed. For 10 years I've been expecting the
shoe to fall.'''
   Bush ``also went with him to A.A. (Alcoholics Anonymous)
meetings, got him started,'' she recalled. ``The man is a big
George Bush backer 25 years later.''
   The first lady made the comments in an interview late Monday
with news agency reporters.

<HEAD>Killer Tomatoes From Space Seeds? Nope, State Fair First Prize!</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HUTCHINSON, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seeds that some had feared might produce
mutated killer tomatoes after nearly six years in space have been
vindicated _ they produced fruit that won first prize at the Kansas
State Fair.
   Six tomatoes grown from seeds that were part of a National
Aeronautics and Space Administration experiment beat more than
three dozen other entries.
   Kansas Cosmosphere planetarium director Roger Hoefer grew the
tomatoes. The space museum in the central Kansas town of Hutchinson
received seeds from NASA to show teachers how to do class projects
with them.
   ``I've grown tomatoes all of my life and I've never grown
tomatoes as pretty as these were,'' Hoefer said.
   When he entered the plate of six Rutgers tomatoes, he noticed
some other entries dwarfed his. Rutgers, named after the university
where the variety was developed years ago, is an old, stable but
small tomato.
   But the judge looked not for size but for conformity, uniformity
of shape and ripeness and freedom from skin blemishes and defects.
   Hoefer's space tomatoes were among the 10 plates of entries the
judge separated immediately from the rest. Closer examination put
Hoefer's entry in first in Saturday's judging.
   Hoefer didn't learn of the results until Monday.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``I looked down and they had
a blue ribbon on them.''
   More that 12 million seeds were on a satellite sent into orbit
in 1984 for 10 months of exposure to the radiation of space. The
idea was to test the durability of possible space station building
materials and to see if the radiation would cause mutations in the
tomatoes.
   But instead of 10 months, the satellite wasn't retrieved until
after nearly six years.
   The seeds were distributed to 4 million students and others
nationwide for planting.
   Controversy erupted when a NASA contractor warned there was a
remote possibility the seeds might produce toxic fruit. Some
teachers dropped the plant project. NASA suggested the tomatoes not
be eaten.
   But Hoefer said Cosmosphere employees and volunteers have been
eating the tomatoes all summer.
   Hoefer and Chuck Marr, a Kansas State University horticulturist
who supervised the tomato competition, agreed that growing
conditions and care had more to do with the prize tomatoes than the
fact their seeds spent time in space. Hoefer grew his in a
greenhouse.
   Hoefer said control plants grown from seeds of the same variety
that stayed on Earth yielded equal quality fruit.
   He said two plants showed abnormalities. One had unusual blossom
clusters and produced small, elongated tomatoes. The fruit had poor
flavor and few seeds. Another plant also had odd blossoms and in
one instance produced a pea-size tomato that never ripened.
   Hoefer is keeping the odd plants alive in case scientists at
NASA or Park Seed Co. of Greenwood, S.C., want to do tissue tests
to looked for genetic damage.

<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Saudi government has complained
to the U.S. military about the growing number of American troops
visiting Saudi towns toting weapons, officials said Tuesday.
   Saudi and U.S. officials sought to play down the significance of
the formal complaint, but it came amid growing signs the American
presence is causing cultural strains.
   ``We of course welcome the Americans and appreciate their
assistance, but there needs to be more sensitivity,'' a Saudi
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``There is no
need to carry weapons into town, and we are asking that they not do
this.''
   A military spokesman, Navy Capt. Michael Sherman, said all
American military personnel had been instructed to, when possible,
wear civilian clothes while visiting Saudi towns and not to carry
weapons.
   He said the instructions will be circulated again in light of
the Saudi complaint. But Sherman said it is inevitable that some
troops sent into town suddenly or on certain official business
would bring their weapons.
   ``There is a terrorist threat and these people should be able to
defend themselves,'' he said. ``But we want to keep that to a
minimum.''
   For the first few weeks of the American deployment, it was rare
to see uniformed U.S. military personnel in Saudi towns. But in the
past 10 days many units have sent troops into a few towns for
supplies they have been unable to get from the military. Those
soldiers often wander through streets and shops carrying M-16
rifles and other weapons.
   That prompted a number of recent complaints from Saudis to the
government of the kingdom's Eastern Province, the northeastern
sector of the country where most American troops are deployed.
   Some shopkeepers say the armed Americans scare people away, and
officials say the constant presence of weapons is heightening fears
that war is imminent.
   ``We have asked that they leave their machine guns behind when
they go into town,'' said the Saudi official.
   Another Saudi official said the Eastern Province government also
has been questioned in recent days about American military women
driving in the streets. Women are prohibited from driving in Saudi
Arabia.
   ``They are inquiries rather than complaints,'' said the
official, who also spoke on the condition he not be identified.
   U.S. military officials have said women would be confined to
driving on military installations and in their camps, but there
have been occasions when women have been seen driving military
vehicles in Saudi towns.
   The complaint and inquiries were not entirely unexpected.
   Saudi and American officials have said some conflicts are
inevitable as about 100,000 American troops, deployed since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, begin living in an Islamic culture.
   These officials said they have been pleasantly surprised that
such incidents have been kept to a minimum.
   But in recent days there have been other signs of strain as well
in the relations between the American military and their Saudi
hosts.
   Many military decisions are deferred to the Saudis because of
their sovereignty. But Americans have been irritated by a few
public statements by Saudi officials that the Americans have viewed
as bragging about controlling the U.S. troops.
   American field commanders are irate that they have not been
allowed to conduct live-fire testing of major weapons systems such
as M-1 tanks and Hellfire anti-tank missiles. These and other
systems are untested in combat and commanders believe some field
firing is essential to determine if desert conditions will affect
their weapons-guidance systems.
   The Saudis, according to U.S. military sources, have discouraged
the live firing because they do not want to upset or endanger local
residents, particularly desert-roaming Bedouins, or face criticism
within the Arab world for allowing the United States to show off
its military might.
   This dispute appears headed for resolution. The Saudis have
given permission for test firing of lighter weapons, perhaps as
early as this week, and say they are seeking to resolve concerns
over firing the heavier weapons.
   In another incident that prompted private criticism from Saudis,
a M-16 rifle leaned against a wall in a hotel restaurant slipped
and fell to the floor, startling Saudis and Kuwaitis in the
restaurant.
   Sherman said military personnel have been asked to leave their
weapons at a military office at the hotel if they are going into
the restaurant.

<HEAD>Study Finds Uninsured Got Less Heart Disease Treatment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Uninsured patients and those on Medicaid were
less likely to receive three common treatments for heart disease
than those with insurance, a study of 37,994 people in
Massachusetts has found.
   The study examined the care of heart disease patients admitted
to more than 100 Massachusetts hospitals in 1985.
   Researchers looked at three common but expensive treatments:
angiography, used to diagnose heart disease; and bypass grafting
and angioplasty, procedures to treat blocked coronary arteries.
   ``We found that the odds that privately insured patients
received angiography were 80 percent higher than uninsured
patients; the odds were 40 percent higher for bypass grafting and
28 percent higher for angioplasty,'' the authors wrote in
Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``Medicaid patients experienced odds similar to those of
uninsured patients for receiving angiography and bypass, but had 48
percent lower odds of receiving angioplasty,'' they wrote.
   ``This is very disturbing,'' Dr. Mark Wenneker, a health policy
researcher at New England Medical Center in Boston, said Tuesday.
   ``It's very possible that the uninsured and Medicaid people
needed these procedures and didn't get them, but we don't know
that,'' said Wenneker, the lead researcher.
   ``On the other hand, equally disturbing is the possibility that
there may have been no difference in what happened to insured
versus the uninsured, which raises the question of whether these
procedures were actually even necessary,'' Wenneker said in a
telephone interview.
   In an angiography, dye is injected into coronary arteries to
determine if there is any blockage.
   If blockage is found, an open-heart bypass operation may be
done, grafting a vessel from another part of the body to bypass the
blockage and allow enough blood to reach the heart.
   Angioplasty is an alternative operation in which a small balloon
is inflated inside the blocked vessel to push the clot into the
vessel wall and reduce the blockage.
   Angiography and angioplasty each generally cost more than
$1,000, while bypass operations usually cost several thousand
dollars, Wenneker said.
   The three are considered ``definitive procedures necessary to
diagnose'' and treat heart disease, Wenneker said.
   The researchers, however, did not examine the patients' outcomes
to see if any of them might have died or their conditions worsened
after not receiving the procedures, Wenneker said.
   They also did not determine whether it was the decision of the
physician, hospital or patient to forgo the procedures.
   Their study did conclude that the patients' insurance status was
a major factor, and that the procedures were done less often on
those with lower incomes. And it suggests that quality of care may
depend on a patient's insurance status.
   ``Although the central mission of many hospitals was once the
provision of charity care, rising costs and an increasingly
competitive health care marketplace have influenced the willingness
of hospitals to care for uninsured patients,'' the researchers
wrote.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. James Todd, the AMA's
executive vice president, said changes are needed in the financing
and delivering of health care to make sure treatment does not
depend on economics.
   ``Many hypotheses could be advanced to explain these differences
but all would raise the issue that the volume and location of care
seem related to the availability of funding,'' Todd wrote.
   ``The medical profession stands ready to participate in any
program that brings equity to the system,'' he said. ``It does not
stand ready to abandon its advocacy for patients in the name of
expediency.''

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Up Only Slightly but Worse Figures Predicted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deficit in the country's broadest measure
of foreign trade rose slightly in the April-June quarter to $21.84
billion, still the second-best showing in six years, the government
reported Tuesday.
   However, private economists forecast that the deficit will head
sharply higher in the months ahead as the Persian Gulf crisis
boosts America's foreign oil bill and cuts into Americans' overseas
earnings.
   The Commerce Department report showed that the nation's current
account trade deficit was up a slight 0.8 percent from a first
quarter gap of $21.67 billion, which had been the best showing
since a $21.2 billion deficit in the first three months of 1984.
   The current account is the most important trade statistic
because it measures not only trade in merchandise but also in
services and investment flows between countries.
   The strong showing in the second quarter resulted from a record
level of U.S. merchandise sales balancing a deterioration in
investment earnings, which went into deficit for the first time in
a year.
   Analysts forecast that the deficit for the rest of this year
would rise as a result of the crisis in the Middle East.
   Under their scenario, higher oil prices will boost America's
import bill while slower worldwide growth as a result of the
turmoil will cut down on American export sales as well as dampen
overseas earnings by U.S. companies.
   ``Our economy is now tied more than ever to foreign growth.
Slower growth overseas will reduce demand for U.S. exports and
reduce our earnings on overseas investments,'' said Stephen Cooney,
director of international investment for the National Association
of Manufacturers.
   David Wyss, senior financial economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, said
the trade deficit could widen by 25 percent in coming months
because of the fallout from the Persian Gulf. That forecast would
represent a blow to Bush administration hopes for a continued
strong trade performance to bolster a weak domestic economy.
   Wyss predicted the trade deficit would start narrowing again by
the second half of next year as oil prices begin to come down but
he said this estimate was dependent on events in the Persian Gulf.
   ``If shooting starts, then oil prices go higher and the trade
deficit gets a lot worse,'' he said.
   For the second quarter, the merchandise trade deficit narrowed a
sharp 14.1 percent to $22.6 billion, reflecting a big drop in oil
prices and a record level of exports.
   The surplus in the services account, which reflects such things
as tourism and payments for services running from architects to
lawyers, totaled $6.08 billion, up 1.3 percent from the first
quarter.
   However, these improvements were offset by the fact that the
investment category moved into deficit for the first time in a
year. The deficit in the second quarter was $637 million, compared
to a surplus of $2.0 billion in the first quarter.
   The other category in the current account, unilateral transfers
such as foreign aid and pension payments to Americans living
overseas, showed a deficit of $4.71 billion in the second quarter,
39 percent larger than the first quarter deficit.
   Even with the improvement in the first six months, the United
States started the 1990s in a vastly different position from a
decade earlier.
   Then, America was the largest creditor nation. It ran surpluses
in its current account as the earnings on its overseas investments
were enough to offset perennial deficits in merchandise trade.
   But as Americans handed over billions of dollars to foreigners
to pay for imported merchandise, the investment cushion eroded and
disappeared altogether in 1985 when the United States became a net
debtor for the first time in 71 years.
   That means that foreigners now own more in U.S. assets than
Americans own overseas, a development which has led some to fear
America is losing control of its economic destiny to foreigners.
   At the end of 1989, the country's net debtor position was put at
$663.7 billion, up a sharp 25 percent from the previous year. Many
analysts believe it will hit $1 trillion before beginning to
improve.

   A veteran prosecutor forgot which side
of the bar he was on when he pleaded innocent Tuesday to three
charges that he knowingly received stolen antiques and burglarized
a house.
   ``Your honor, at this time the people ... '' Santa Clara County
assistant District Attorney Alan W. Nudelman began, apparently
forgetting he was the accused.
   ``Pardon me,'' he told Municipal Court Judge Jean Westenkamp.
``I would enter a plea of not guilty to all charges.''
   The judge set Oct. 10 for the next court appearance for
Nudelman. A date for a preliminary hearing will be set at that time.
   Nudelman was arrested Aug. 26 in a parking lot in Los Gatos
after allegedly buying a sink and a desk from a suspected burglar.
The transaction was secretly videotaped by officers.
   Nudelman, 45, has said he didn't know the items were stolen.
   ``The only comment that I have is that Alan Nudelman has
committed no crime and therefore expects to be completely
exonerated,'' said his attorney, Kenneth W. Robinson.
   Police said they obtained Nudelman's permission before they
searched his Los Gatos home and found more than 70 allegedly stolen
items.
   Deputy Attorney General Michael O'Reilley contended that about
50 of those items belong to an 87-year-old woman whose home and
storage building were raided by burglars.

<TEXT>
   Israel on Tuesday welcomed its 100,000th
immigrant this year, the latest newcomer in a flood that has proved
a mixed blessing for the Jewish state.
   The immigrants, almost 90 percent Soviets, are helping to build
Israel's Jewish population and fulfilling the national goal of
``the ingathering of the exiles.'' But the wave of immigration, the
largest since the early days of the state, is severely straining
resources.
   Just slightly larger than New Jersey and with a population of
about 4.5 million, Israel is grappling with how to resettle the
150,000 Soviet Jews expected this year and the 1 million who could
arrive by the decade's end.
   Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz on Tuesday predicted that a
total number of immigrants this year may reach 200,000.
   Housing shortages already have developed, unemployment is rising
and the budget deficit is soaring.
   Michael Kleiner, chairman of the Parliament's absorption
committee, estimates Israel will need to spend $30 billion over the
next four to five years to resettle the newcomers.
   ``We will have to readjust our national spending, tap world
Jewry and Israel's other foreign friends, take out loans, anything
we can think of to cover the costs,'' Kleiner said.
   Peretz went to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport to greet the
100,000th immigrant of 1990. He was Yitzhak Krasiltchik, 80, a
native of the Soviet city of Leningrad, who arrived on a flight
with 140 other Soviet Jews via Warsaw.
   Krasiltchik, who walks with a cane, was helped into a limosine
at the foot of the jet's ramp and ferried to the arrivals lounge,
where he was serenaded by Israeli children carrying colorful
balloons.
   About 88,000 of the newcomers this year have been Soviets, the
government says.
   Immigration from the Soviet Union in August was a record 17,484,
said Yehuda Weinraub, a spokesman for the Jewish Agency. He said
1,340 arrived from other countries.
   To many in Israel, the importance of the immigrant wave is in
building the Jewish population in the Arab-dominated Middle East.
   Jews already constitute a substantial majority in Israel,
numbering more than 3.7 million compared with 850,000 Arabs.
   But the Arab birthrate remains nearly twice that of the Jewish
rate, and there are 1.7 million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which Israel controls through a military government.
   With the exception of Egypt, Israel remains the enemy of the
Arab states that surround it.
   Housing Minister Ariel Sharon, in Moscow to encourage more
immigration, said there was strength in numbers.
   ``Peace depends on the number of Jews who come to Israel,'' he
said.
   In addition to contributing to security, the arriving Soviets
could greatly increase Israel's pool of talent. The government
estimates that nearly one-quarter of the new arrivals are doctors,
engineers, scientists, teachers and other professionals.
   Still, absorbing the immigrants carries a high price tag and
Israel is increasingly looking for help abroad.
   The Jewish state has budgeted $2.3 billion over the next three
years for immigrant absorption and recently approved a new housing
construction program that will cost $400 million this year alone.
   Help from abroad includes more than $740 million funneled this
year through the Jewish Agency, a quasi-governmental organization
that assists in resettlement.
   The international Israel Bond campaign has pledged to raise a
record $1 billion this year for the immigrants.
   Israel also is seeking $400 million in loan guarantees from the
United States to build new housing. The guarantees have been held
up by U.S. demands that Israel ensure none of the funds goes to
settling the newcomers in the occupied territories.

<HEAD>Preliminary Figures Will Be Increased, Census Director Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local government officials complaining that
preliminary 1990 census figures are too low will soon see the
numbers rise, the director of the U.S. Census Bureau said Tuesday.
   ``The census count will increase in practically every
jurisdiction throughout the country because of ongoing coverage
improvement programs,'' said Barbara Everitt Bryant. ``We expect to
add millions of persons before the count is delivered to the
president.''
   The deadline for getting the count to President Bush is Dec. 31,
according to federal law.
   The census bureau is now in its ``post-enumeration survey''
stage to recheck the preliminary U.S. population figure of
245,837,681.
   Bryant described to a House subcommittee the methods the bureau
is using to recheck the figures. They include:
   _Recounts in areas where the preliminary numbers have been
challenged by local governments.
   _Addition of probationers and parolees not counted at their home
addresses.
   _Addition of people at the address they report as their usual
residence, if at first count they were somewhere else.
   _Recanvassing based on information obtained by the bureau
through calls to its 800-numbers, construction permits, media
reports and other sources.
   _Addition of people answering ``Were You Counted?'' forms.
   _Reinterviews.
   _Addition of overseas military and civilian federal employees
and their dependents.
   Bryant said that over 39,000 cities, counties and other local
governments received preliminary housing unit counts in August.
Each has three weeks to challenge the figures. A challenge could
lead to a recount.
   By Oct. 15, all late census interviews must be completed. After
analyzing the data, the secretary of commerce will decide by next
July 15 whether to adjust the census for under-counts or
over-counts, Bryant said.
   Rep. Thomas Sawyer, D-Ohio, chairman of the House Post Office
and Civil Service subcommittee on census and population, said
``accuracy has never been more important than in 1990 when
operational problems have raised many questions about the
thoroughness of the count.''
   Several members appearing before the subcommittee said their
districts were miscounted. Some questioned the categories into
which people were placed as inevitably resulting in the United
States appearing more white than it actually is.
   Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif., said Asian and Pacific Islanders
were being categorized as Caucasians.
   ``To group the Asian-Pacific Islanders with the group most
likely to be over-counted is a disservice,'' said Mineta.
   Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., called it ``continued
insensitivity toward Asian-Americans as a minority group.''
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, criticized preliminary figures for
his state that showed the predominantly white, suburban counties
had more population in 1990 than in the census bureau's 1988
projection, while the heavily Hispanic counties showed less.
   ``Are we to believe that the Census Bureau consistently found
more whites than they estimated, but was unable to find even the
number of Hispanics that they had estimated in 1988?'' he said.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., saying ``almost everything that
could have gone wrong with the census in New York, did,''
criticized the post-count review for not addressing inhousehold
misses _ those people who weren't counted as part of a household in
which all the other members were counted.

   President Bush and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III have revived talk of a Mideast peace conference, but a
senior U.S. official said Tuesday the idea is premature.
   ``This is not the time,'' said the official, who is here with
Baker for talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other
Soviet officials on a variety of issues.
   First, the official said, the basis of negotiations between
Israel and Palestinian Arabs would have to be worked out. And, he
said, even if there is a conference the negotiations would be
carried out between the two sides.
   The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, tried to
soften the impact of the statements by Bush and Baker at last
weekend's Helsinki summit meeting the Soviet Union.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who the Americans want to
induce to negotiate withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza, is
opposed to an international peace conference. He is concerned that
the Soviets and the Arabs would use such a gathering to collaborate
on terms unfavorable to Israel.
   ``We will not participate in such an international conference,''
Shamir said last week after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze raised the idea.
   But Bush and Baker, eager for Soviet cooperation against Iraq,
said subsequently that a conference on the Middle East would be
appropriate under certain conditions.
   The official concurred. ``At the appropriate time, we`d be in
favor of it,'' he said. ``It can be helpful.''
   But, he stressed, the United States would be the judge of when
conditions were right.
   First, he said, the basis for negotiations would have to be
``substantially developed.'' And, he said, ``the conference would
have to be properly structured, moving toward negotiations in a
bilateral way.''
   The idea that the United States would judge the timing, and that
the negotiations would remain in the hands of Israel and its Arab
neighbors, is bound to please Jerusalem.
   Shamir has said he is willing to negotiate with Palestinians
from the West Bank and Gaza after leaders are chosen in an election
and after a trial period of limited self-rule.
   Gorbachev, however, on Sunday described the Arab-Israeli dispute
as being of ``even more'' concern than Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

   Moslem militants opened fired on police
at a car checkpoint Tuesday and 23 people were killed, including 17
militants aboard a bus that exploded in the shootout, the
government said.
   It said two police were among the dead.
   The account could not be independently confirmed.
   Government officials, who cannot be indentified under briefing
rules, said police stopped the bus at a Border Security Force
checkpoint early Tuesday near Thunu, about 30 miles northeast of
Srinagar, because the bus was defying a curfew.
   When the bus stopped, four men jumped out of the vehicle and
began firing at the policemen, the officials said. The policemen
returned fire and two police and four militants from the bus were
killed.
   A stray bullet hit a pile of ammunition inside the bus,
triggering the explosion and fire, the officials said. They said
the bodies of all 17 militants inside were charred beyond
recognition.
   A government statement said security forces recovered a large
quantity of ammunition, grenades and rocket launchers from the bus.
It did not explain how the ammunition survived the blast.
   There were no immediate statements from Moslem militant groups
that are fighting for the secession of the Moslem-dominated
Jammu-Kashmir state from the predominantly Hindu India.
   At the other end of the state in Jammu town, about 6,000 Hindus
demonstrated against the Moslem secessionist movement.
   Prior to the demonstration, a bomb blew up the railroad tracks
near Jammu, just 15 minutes before the scheduled arrival of a train
carrying top leaders of the protest. There were no injuries and no
one claimed responsibility, state officials said.
   The train, which normally carries about 1,500 people, was late
and the bomb exploded when the train was at a station 12 miles from
Jammu.
   About 1,200 people have been killed in Kashmir, the
Moslem-dominated part of Jammu-Kashmir state, since January, when
the government started its heaviest crackdown to date on the
secessionists.
   About 64 percent of Jammu-Kashmir's 6 million people follow
Islam, making it the only Indian state with a Moslem majority. Most
of the Hindus, who comprise 32 percent of the state's population,
live in Jammu region.
   Nationwide, 82 percent of India's 880 million people are Hindus
while Moslems account for 12 percent.

<HEAD>UPI Closing Bureaus in Six States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   United Press International is closing bureaus
in six states as part of a general restructuring of the news
service, a UPI spokesman said Tuesday.
   Spokesman Milt Capps confirmed that one-person bureaus in Grand
Rapids, Mich.; Bismarck N.D.; Syracuse, N.Y. and Santa Fe, N.M.
were being closed, as were offices in Montana and Wyoming.
   Capps denied, however, what he said was the ``erroneous
impression that we are doing anything but increasing our coverage
in these states.''
   He said UPI would rely more on stringer networks and its joint
venture partners, which include TV's Financial News Network, States
News Service and Financial World Magazine.
   Asked if other bureaus had been closed, Capps said, ``I have no
further announcements.'' He declined to give details on future
closures or how many bureaus UPI now operates in the United States,
but said ``a change up and down in staffing will be continuing for
several months.''
   Last month he confirmed a Washington Post report that 31 UPI
reporters and editors were being laid off.
   He said UPI was realigning staff throughout the organization
this summer and fall with a shift toward specific fields such as
business and finance and sports.
   ``The upshot is that virtually every bureau in the system
worldwide is affected either by increases or decreases.''
   ``We are developing what we think is a new role for UPI after 83
years which entails not only strong general news service but
increased emphasis on focused news reports that can command a
premium in the market place, including media and corporate
subscribers,'' he said.
   ``The bottom line is we can now say we have more people writing
for UPI across the board than a year ago,'' he said.

   Nelson Mandela accused the
government Tuesday of waging war against his African National
Congress and said failure to halt black factional fighting
threatened talks on ending apartheid.
   Mandela held an urgent meeting with President F.W. de Klerk as
vicious black factional fighting left at least 24 people dead.
Police said unrest in black townships around Johannesburg continued
into the night, with shacks burned in Tokoza and running clashes
between black factions in Katlehong.
   ``We will do everything in our power to ensure that the peace
process remains on track, but the government has to do its part,''
Mandela said in Pretoria after Tuesday's meeting. ``If it is
dragging its feet as it is doing now, then the peace process is
definitely threatened.''
   De Klerk said in a brief statement the growing sense of urgency
in the country demanded that leaders get the chance to complete
talks on a new constitution. He offered no new steps on ending the
violence.
   About 700 blacks have died since clashes pitting Xhosa and other
blacks linked to the ANC against Zulus loyal to the conservative
Inkatha movement erupted a month ago in Johannesburg-area townships.
   The fighting spread from eastern Natal Province, where the
ethnic and political warfare has killed more than 5,000 blacks in
five years. Mandela said the government had failed to take
``visible measures'' to halt the fighting, such as sending in its
powerful military.
   The government sent military units to the black townships almost
two weeks after the violence erupted Aug. 12. The fighting raged on.
   The government ``cannot be allowed to talk peace and negotiation
while it conducts war against the ANC,'' Mandela said.
   An ANC statement issued later noted that the government had
established the Kwazulu homeland in Natal, and it alleged that
Kwazulu leaders were using the power they received from the
government to carry out warfare against political opponents.
   Mandela has previously warned the violence threatened
negotiations on ending apartheid and political power for blacks,
but the talks with the government have continued.
   Mandela also has appealed for his supporters to lay down their
arms. The continued violence indicates he lacks control over the
townships.
   ``If the government fails to take action, and if the violence
continues to rise, and if the people continue to demand to be
armed, we will find it difficult to oppose that demand,'' he said
Tuesday.
   The ANC lacks a significant arsenal, however. It suspended its
mostly ineffective armed struggle against the government this year
as a prelude to peace talks.
   Most of the street fighting has involved crude weapons such as
axes, machetes, clubs, spears and gardening tools.
   De Klerk's statement said ending the violence depended on a
political solution as well as possible steps by the government. It
said recommendations from Mandela's delegation would be considered.
   Police said 20 people were killed early Tuesday in Katlehong,
while one person died in Tokoza and three were killed in Vosloorus.
   At least one black man was hacked to death Tuesday and several
injured on a train in Johannesburg by men with machetes who
rampaged through carriages attacking passengers, police said.
   Mandela and the ANC, the country's largest black opposition
group, have repeatedly charged that police have instigated violence
or aided Inkatha fighters. Police and government officials have
rejected the charges.
   Random attacks on blacks in the past week have also led to
allegations that right-wing whites are involved in a secret
campaign to instigate violence.
   The government has said it was investigating reports that whites
with blackened faces took part in some attacks.
   The ANC and Inkatha blame each other for the fighting, but the
ANC has refused to meet with Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi.
Both groups oppose apartheid but differ on the shape of a future
South Africa.
   The ANC claims Buthelezi spread the violence from Natal to the
Johannesburg area to broaden his constituency. Inkatha accuses the
ANC of launching a terror campaign to monopolize power among black
opposition groups.

<HEAD>Profile of Academician Who Drew Radical Economic Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Economy, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stanislav S. Shatalin, who drew up the economic
plan approved by the Russian parliament Tuesday, supports private
ownership of property, a multiparty system and cuts in military
spending.
   Although a member of the Communist Party since 1963, the frail
economist who looks older than his 56 years says he is inclined
toward the party's social democratic wing. He says he even
considers President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, head of the Soviet
Communist Party, to be a social democrat at heart.
   Shatalin was appointed in March to Gorbachev's advisory group,
the Presidential Council, with the responsibility of formulating
socio-economic policy.
   When asked in April by an interviewer for the radical weekly
Moscow News whether he and Gorbachev were like-minded, Shatalin
said they were in the sense that both were willing to listen to
people ``who don't hold our views.''
   An academic secretary with the Economics Department of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences since 1989, Shatalin has been studying
economic science for more than 30 years.
   ``For me, socialism first means real pluralism in the economy,
including private ownership in its modern form,'' primarily stocks,
he said in the interview. ``Second, it is progressive profit taxes.
Third, it's social protection, including unemployment benefits,
retraining benefits, etc. These mechanisms work well in many
civilized countries.''
   ``Fourth, it is social justice,'' he said. ``Not the demagoguery
about social justice that was practiced in this country for
decades, but social justice based on an efficient economy.''
   While not a close confidante of Gorbachev, he said he likes the
Soviet leader's ``honesty, benevolence (and) quickness of mind,
free from dogmatism. Perhaps he, too, discerned in me some
qualities that we have in common.''
   ``I regard myself as a Russian intellectual,'' Shatalin told
Moscow News. ``Russian intellectuals used to take to heart and do
take to heart the misfortunes and hopes of the Russian people and
all Soviet citizens.''

<HEAD>Florida Ups Jackpot to $90 Million</HEAD>

   The jackpot for the next Florida Lotto
drawing was set at $90 million Tuesday and fast ticket sales meant
prospects were improving for a $100 million prize, lottery
officials said.
   ``If we have an incredible day today, it's possible,'' said
Lottery Secretary Rebecca Paul. ``I probably need another 24 hours
to know for sure.''
   Mrs. Paul said 75 percent of a week's Lotto tickets are usually
sold Thursday, Friday and Saturday, when the drawing is held. The
$90 million figure is a projection that includes estimates for
those three days.
   ``Sales through 11 a.m. Tuesday are about 100 percent higher
than the best week on record,'' she said.
   But she didn't think Florida would be able to top Pennsylvania's
record $115 million jackpot, shared by several winners on April 26,
1989.
   ``I don't think there's enough time for the jackpot to go that
high,'' Mrs. Paul said.
   With no winner in the last three weekend drawings, the Lotto has
reached its highest total since the game began in Florida in 1988.
   ``It's created a great deal of interest'' she said.
   Lotto jackpots roll over when no one picks all the winning
numbers. The Lottery Department then estimates the size of the next
week's jackpot based on the rollover and sales projections.
   On Saturday, there were no winning tickets in a $50 million
lottery. The next day, the jackpot was set at $75 million; on
Monday, it was raised to $80 million.
   Florida's best previous week in lottery sales was in April when
a $58.3 million jackpot was shared by several winners.
   The world record of the largest single lottery prize still goes
to Sheelah Ryan of Winter Springs, who won a Florida Lotto jackpot
of $55.1 million two years ago.
   Players select six numbers from one to 49 and must hit on all
six to collect the grand prize, which would be paid out over 20
years. Multiple winners would share equally in the jackpot.
   The odds of someone picking the winning numbers are about one in
14 million.

<HEAD>NIH Approves Gene-Therapy Experiments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Institutes of Health on Tuesday
approved the human gene-therapy trials, experiments that scientists
say will begin a new chapter in medicine.
   Approval was given to use gene therapy to treat a rare immune
disorder in children and a lethal form of skin cancer.
   The agency's green light, which was expected, follows the NIH
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee's July 31 recommendation that
the tests be approved.
   The experiments still must be approved by the Food and Drug
Administration before they can begin.
   In the trials, patients would be treated with cells that had
been altered by the addition of new genes.
   Genes, which direct the actions of cells, will cause the treated
cells to produce special proteins that will either amplify a
biological action or replace proteins that were missing.
   In the protocol for treatment of severe combined immune
deficiency disease, a human gene that instructs a cell to make
adenosine deaminase, or ADA, would be inserted into the patient's
white blood cells. The disease is caused by a deficiency of ADA.
   The other experiments would involve patients with melanoma. A
gene for the cancer-killing tumor necrosis factor would be inserted
into a patient's tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, which are
cancer-killing white cells.

<HEAD>Burned Boy Points To Alleged Attacker, Tells Tale of Torture</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 12-year-old boy set ablaze by a neighborhood
bully in an abandoned building pointed out his alleged attacker in
court Tuesday and told a tale of kidnapping, torture and immolation.
   David Opont also testified that the attacker laughed at him when
he rolled in the snow to put out the fire.
   David attracted national sympathy after the March 7 attack with
reports he resisted efforts by his attacker to make him take drugs.
   ``He tried to put what he was smoking in my mouth,'' David said,
speaking in Creole through a translator. ``I shook my head because
I didn't want to take it. He set fire to my shirt.''
   David, a native of Haiti, suffered massive burns. Doctors
initially gave him a 50 percent chance of surviving. After numerous
skin grafs he left a hospital last month. Celebrity hospital
visitors included former President Reagan, Bill Cosby and baseball
star Dwight Gooden.
   A 14-year-old boy is on trial in Brooklyn Family Court on
charges of attempted murder, assault, kidnapping, attempted
robbery, robbery and possession of a weapon.
   David said he fled the basement with his clothes on fire after
his attacker went upstairs.
   ``When I came out there was snow on the ground and I rolled on
the floor so the fire stopped,'' David said. ``I saw him laughing.
He was laughing, Ha! Ha! Ha!''
   Assistant Brooklyn District Attorney Deborah Lashley asked the
boy, ``David, do you see the person who burned you on March 7?''
   He pointed and stared straight at the defendant, who sat
motionless.
   The accused teen-ager, whose name is being withheld because of
his age, faces three years' confinement if convicted in the
non-jury trial.
   David told the judge the attack began with a shakedown by a boy
who he said had robbed him and others the day.
   The attacker, who David thought was about 20 years old, went
through the other boy's pockets and then told him to leave, David
testified.
   ``He said he was a detective and he was looking for kids who
were taking drugs,'' David said. ``I felt like I've never taken
drugs, so why would he come to me?
   ``I was about to run, but he said he was a detective. That's why
I didn't run,'' he said, adding he was then led into the basement.
   ``He said he puts people who use drugs in there,'' David said.
   David said his hands were tied behind his back and he was
sandwiched between two loose doors discarded in the basement.
   ``I heard something like paper being ripped. Then I felt
something hot on my back. I got up and started crying,'' David said.
   David said the boy repeatedly asked him if his parents used
drugs,
   ``I told him no one in my family took drugs. He told me I was
lying and he hit me with a shovel and then he tied me to a metal
pole. He tied my feet and he asked me again: Did my mother take
drugs? Did my father take drugs?''
   David said the boy then tried to force him to smoke something,
but he wasn't sure what it was.
   The attacker picked up the shovel again and set something on it
ablaze. The attacker then put it against David's shirt, setting his
clothing on fire, David testified.

<HEAD>Borough Hopes To Say `Bye, Bye, Blackbirds'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDSOR, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Residents of this southeastern Pennsylvania
town have declared war on some loud, messy visitors.
   Droves of blackbirds swarm into the east end of Windsor each day
at dusk to roost in a stand of trees, and residents want relief
from the mess, the smell and the loud chirping.
   In retaliation, the people plan to ``bomb'' the birds with some
manmade noise of their own.
   The Windsor borough government plans to buy 100 rocket bombs and
set them off, 20 at a time, five nights in row, in the birds'
roosting area. Borough engineer Gordon Brown hopes the birds will
cry foul and leave. The anti-bird ammunition will cost about $30.
   Local resident Bill Hollar said the east end has been plagued by
the roosting blackbirds all summer.
   ``It is solid with birds,'' Hollar said. ``The ground is covered
(with droppings), and it's so bad the kids can't go out to play.''
   This isn't the first time the borough has had a problem with
some not-so-fine feathered friends.
   Ten years ago, borough officials tried driving a flock of
starlings away from the water company pump house by spraying water,
blowing sirens and firing shotguns into the air.
   When that failed, the city finally cut down two acres of trees
around the pump house.

   There's one rare black mink coat for a mere
$50,000, a gem-encrusted butterfly brooch for a quarter million,
and a New Orleans Mardi Gras excursion for about six grand.
   For less extravagant shoppers, how about the lead item in this
year's Neiman Marcus Christmas catalogue: His and Hers 1990
``chairpersons.''
   Straight-backed wooden chairs designed by artist Philip Grace
become life-size portraits of your choice. At $6,000 each, they're
art you can really use.
   ``People are always interested in seeing what we have for the
His and Hers gifts. Every year we look for something that hasn't
been done before,'' said Jan Roberts, Neiman vice president of
public relations in New York.
   ``Some years they're really expensive gifts, some years they're
animals. It doesn't always have to have the same feel,'' she said.
   The tony, Dallas-based department store on Tuesday began sending
out 3 million copies worldwide of its holiday wish book famous for
items ranging from the silly to the sublime.
   This year there's the usual Russian caviar packed in gold-lined
tins at $295 per gram, as well as knickknacks, clothes, food and
other things, many at regular department store prices.
   In the one-of-a-kind category is an original Gypsy house
trailer, ornately carved and painted, supposedly ``once both home
and transportation to an important English Gypsy.''
   Ms. Roberts said the caravan, obtained from a Midwestern
collector is ``really spectacular ... a little museum on wheels.''
   ``We will probably sell it,'' she said.
   She said the company already has received inquiries about
another singular item _ Napoleon's spectacles.
   The gold-rimmed reading glasses used by the French emperor,
possibly for occasions of state, are priced at $90,000 and come
with a certificate of authenticity and leather case.
   The 1991 Mardi Gras trip offers ``a special cachet to join the
elite inner circle'' of New Orleans revelers. It includes five days
and four nights of debauchery for $5,898 for one person, $600 each
additional person.
   ``And there's a lot of stuff in this book that's just for you
and me,'' Ms. Roberts said. ``Things that are still whimsical and
unique, but aren't necessarily expensive.
   ``One of my favorites is the gold Slinky. It would make a great
executive gift,'' she said.
   The gold-plated toy, which is a large spring that ``walks'' down
stairs, is $55.
   Also for executive-level children is a dollop of Silly Putty in
its own engraved sterling silver egg for $95 to commemorate the
40th anniversary of the novelty.
   And for the family pet there's a Pooch Palace, described as ``a
canine dream home.'' It's 6 feet tall with an AstroTurf base and a
car door window permanently rolled down. All for only $3,220.

   More than 250,000 seriously mentally ill
Americans have been left untreated and are living miserable,
sometimes violent lives on the streets and in shelters and jails,
according to a report Tuesday by two advocacy groups.
   In all, one researcher said, about half of the estimated 2
million people who have a serious mental illness are not receiving
treatment.
   The report lays much of the blame on psychiatrists and
psychologists, many of whom the groups say were trained with public
funds but have abandoned the public system for more lucrative
private practice.
   The advocacy groups, Public Citizen and the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill, also fault the priorities of many public
programs that they said spend too much of their resources providing
such services as stress management instead of treating people with
severe mental illnesses.
   ``Care for the seriously mentally ill is a national disaster,''
said Laurie Flynn, executive director of the alliance.
   Dr. Sidney Wolfe, who heads the health research group of Public
Citizen, founded by consumer advocate Ralph Nader, said some
communities have built ``great model programs.'' Therefore, he
said, ``it becomes more and more intolerable when (others) don't
adopt them.''
   The American Psychiatric Association objected strongly to the
report's ``snide, scapegoating'' statements about psychiatrists,
saying they have had ``a historic commitment'' to providing
services for the severely mentally ill who rely on the public
system. Twenty percent of psychiatrists work in the public sector,
which the APA said is a higher percentage than in any other area of
medicine.
   APA spokesman John Blamphin said psychiatrists would not be
opposed to donating an hour of their time a week to public
programs, as the report recommends, ``if that's also required of
others'' working in the health field.
   The report, ``Care of the Seriously Mentally Ill: A Rating of
State Programs,'' evaluates the services provided by each state and
scores them accordingly. The groups began this biennial review in
1986.
   The report assesses hospital services, outpatient and community
support services, vocational rehabilitation, housing services and
programs for seriously emotionally disturbed children.
   Vermont ranked highest, scoring 17 of a possible 25 points. New
Hampshire and Rhode Island each scored 16; Connecticut and Ohio, 15
each, and Colorado, 14.
   Hawaii finished last, as it did in the 1986 and 1988 reports,
with 2 points. Idaho and Wyoming each scored 3; Mississippi and
Montana, 4 each; and Nevada and Texas, 5 each.
   Overall, the New England states tended to score among the
highest while more Western states were at the bottom of the list.
   ``We think that there is kind of a culture of caring that has
grown up in some states and not in others. Clearly this is
strongest in New England and weakest in the West,'' said Dr. E.
Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist with Public Citizen's health research
group.
   ``In the West, with Texas as a good example, it's kind of a
macho mentality. You're supposed to take care of yourself,'' he
said.
   All told, he said, as many as one million seriously mentally ill
people nationwide are not actively receiving treatment.
   The report said one of the major reasons the public system is so
lacking is that mental health professionals, many of whom were
trained with the help of government funds, don't want to treat the
seriously mentally ill.
   Rather, the report said, most psychologists and psychiatrists
spend their time in their offices, counseling people with
relatively minor mental health problems, Torrey said.
   Since the federal government began subsidizing training of
mental health professionals in 1945, the number of psychiatrists
has grown from 3,000 to 40,000, the report said. The number of
psychologists has risen from 4,200 to 70,000 and psychiatric social
workers, from 2,000 to about 80,000.
   To illustrate his point, Torrey said that while Princeton, N.J.,
has one psychiatrist for every 250 people, Jersey City, N.J., has
one for every 13,600 people.
   ``The professionals who have been trained with public funds have
gone off to private practice and left the seriously mentally ill in
the public sector without any care,'' he said.
   The gap is being filled by foreign medical students, who now
constitute about two-thirds of the psychiatrists in public
psychiatric hospitals and clinics in the United States, the report
said.

<TEXT>
   While shooting her new film ``The Sheltering
Sky'' in the middle of the Sahara Desert, Debra Winger began to
cope with the emotional toll of the last five years of her life.
   ``I have to admit that the last few years weren't so good for
me, that I got overwhelmed by life _ marriage, a baby, a house _
overwhelmed,'' the 35-year-old actress told Vanity Fair in its
October issue. ``But somewhere in the middle of the desert in
Niger, I met up with my nerve and took it back.''
   In the last several years, Winger ended her relationship with
Bob Kerrey, then governor of Nebraska and now a U.S. senator,
married actor Timothy Hutton, had a baby, divorced Hutton, reunited
with Kerrey and watched her red-hot career turn lukewarm.
   She starred in two box-office disappointments, ``Betrayed'' and
``Everybody Wins.'' Her earlier credits included ``Terms of
Endearment,'' ``An Officer and a Gentleman'' and ``Legal Eagles.''
   Her latest movie, ``The Sheltering Sky,'' is based on Paul
Bowles' existential novel about an American couple who travel
through North Africa to save their marriage, only for one to lose
life and the other sanity.
   The movie, directed by Bernardo Bertolucci and also starring
John Malkovich, was shot in six months, beginning in Tangier and
ending in the Sahara Desert.
   Bertolucci said Winger has ``a terrible reputation'' among
directors, and he originally wanted Melanie Griffith and William
Hurt for the starring roles. But he also called the actress ``a
Stradivarius which can play itself.''

<HEAD>Relaxed Environmental Rules On Drilling Proposed For U.S. Forests</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Forest Service staff has drawn up
suggestions for relaxing environmental protection to boost
production of oil and gas from national forests, officials said
Tuesday.
   The four-page ``Proposed Strategy for Mitigating Persian Gulf
Situation'' cites estimates of almost 7 billion barrels of
undiscovered, recoverable oil on Forest Service lands, but says
environmental regulations are slowing or blocking exploratory
drilling to find the oil.
   It cites the loss of about 4.5 million barrels of oil per day
from Iraq and Kuwait because of a worldwide embargo.
   ``We have been considering some things the Forest Service can
do,'' said Tom King, the service's geology program manager. ``We at
no time intended to imply that we're going to go out and commit
environmental rape and ruin. We're not in that business.''
   He referred to the proposal as an ``idea document'' which has
not been approved by senior agency officials. King said he was
designated to respond to queries about the proposals Tuesday in the
absence of the service's director of minerals and geology.
   The Forest Service proposals were reported in Tuesday's
Washington Post.
   David Alberswerth, public lands director of the National
Wildlife Federation, told the Post he considered the document ``one
of many similar ill-conceived initiatives that we will see form the
oil industry and its allies in government.''
   The Forest Service controls 191 million acres of public lands,
of which about 14 million acres are leased to oil and gas
producers, down from 35 million acres in 1983.
   The staff proposal said 40 environmental impact statements on
drilling leases in the national forests were scheduled for
completion between 1992 and 1995.
   ``Given the Persian Gulf situation, consideration should be
given to expediting the schedule,'' it said, adding that perhaps
some of the impact statements could be replaced by more expeditious
environmental assessments.
   The paper said requests to drill should be dealt with as quickly
as possible.
   ``We need to act on these wells if, in our professional opinion,
the impacts to the environment are within acceptable limits,'' it
said. ``If lawsuits are filed, perhaps the courts will be lenient
given the national interest that is at stake.''
   Other proposals in the document do not call for relaxed
environmental standards, but for mobilizing forest service
personnel to deal with existing regulations more quickly.
   ``In the event that a forest cannot ensure an immediate response
to a request to drill, specialized teams should be assembled from
other forests,'' it said. ``Drilling should be given the same
urgency and management attention as fire.''
   The proposals also suggest that Congress might act to streamline
current environmental regulations, ``since there is a perception
that federal lands possess good drilling prospects in areas that
have been overly protected.''

   The United States and the Soviet Union, eager to
conclude a conventional forces treaty by year's end, may drop
provisions limiting troops in Europe, a senior U.S. official said
Tuesday.
   Such a move would leave only one stumbling block to finishing
the accord _ a prospective ban on non-nuclear aircraft. The
official said that provision may be dropped as well.
   ``We have the clock ticking,'' he said. ``We're getting to the
point where we are going to have to wrap this up.''
   A 35-nation summit conference to sign the treaty is being
planned in Paris in mid-November. The pact is being negotiated in
Vienna between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   The official spoke to reporters, here with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, one day before the victorious World War II
allies take a historic step to reunite the Germany they defeated 45
years ago.
   A dispute over missile launchers in what is now East Germany _
which threatened to delay eventual German sovereignty, was resolved
on the eve of the ceremony, West German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher said without providing details.
   The conventional forces treaty would set limits on tanks,
artillery and other non-nuclear weapons _ and on non-nuclear
aircraft unless they are dropped from the treaty.
   ``Aircraft and manpower have been very difficult,'' said the
official, who requested anonymity. ``So we are considering removing
limits on aircraft as well.''
   The Soviets have argued that some of their planes the United
States wants scrapped have defensive missions and should not be
limited.
   The Soviet Union already is withdrawing thousands of troops from
Eastern Europe and has agreed to remove the 350,000 men based in
East Germany within four years of German unification, due Oct. 3.
   The United States agreed in February to limit U.S. forces in
Europe to 225,000, with a ceiling of 195,000 on Soviet troops.
   But the Soviet pullout from East Germany will leave Moscow with
far fewer troops. Consequently, Soviets negotiators want to lower
the U.S. ceiling.
   Baker discussed the issue briefly with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze and British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd,
representing the British at Wednesday's ceremonies, in separate
sessions here.
   Under Secretary of State Reginald Bartholomew has been
conducting negotiations on the troop question with the Soviets here
since Monday.
   If omitted from the treaty, troop reductions would be governed
by events in Europe and by budget decisions in Washington and
Moscow, the official said.
   As for the issue of eventual German sovereignty, Genscher told
reporters that there was still disagreement over the kind of
military maneuvers that could be held in what is now East Germany.
   At issue in the missile question is whether launchers capable of
packing nuclear-tipped missiles could be deployed in East Germany.
   Earlier Tuesday, a U.S. official said the matter was ``a tough
question of definition.''
   A way, he said, must be found to delineate the kind of missile
that would not carry nuclear weapons and therefore would be
acceptable in Moscow for basing in the area. The launchers would be
under NATO control but could be operated by Germans, who have
forsworn having nuclear weapons of their own.
   Baker, Hurd, Genscher, Shevardnadze and the foreign ministers of
France and East Germany will sign on Wednesday an accord known as
the Two-Plus-Four agreement on the reunification of Germany.
   While reunification is set for Oct. 3, final German sovereignty
requires the four World War II victors to relinquish their joint
postwar powers, including control and access to Berlin, which once
again will be the German capital.
   This week, the Soviets and West Germans compromised on the money
Bonn would pay for the withdrawal of the troops. The Soviets had
demanded about $12 billion while Bonn offered nearly $4.5 billion.
   On Monday, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
announced the compromise, which West German television placed at
about $7.7 billion. Moscow has said that the returning Soviet
troops will need housing and job training _ a considerable burden
for the ailing Soviet economy.

<HEAD>Safety Board Faults Pipeline Company for Fishing Boat Explosion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The failure of a natural gas pipeline company
to make sure a 16-inch pipeline was securely buried beneath the
Gulf of Mexico caused a fiery accident last year that killed 11
crew members of a fishing boat, the National Traffic Safety Board
said Tuesday.
   The safety board also said that the failure of the Office of
Pipeline Safety to require pipeline operators to inspect and
maintain submerged pipelines contributed to the accident in shallow
waters a half-mile off Sabine, Texas.
   But it said the pipeline safety office needs more personnel and
resources to accomplish its mission.
   The board said that while the fishing boat, the Northumberland,
was either very close to or penetrating the sea bottom at the time
of the accident on Oct. 3, 1989, the ship was not responsible
because it was operating in its normal area and at a reasonable
speed.
   The accident, the board said, ``would not have occurred'' had
the Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America ``maintained the pipeline
at the depth required by the permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers.''
   A spokesman for the company, which has headquarters in Lombard,
Ill., said there would be no comment until officials had a chance
to review the safety board's conclusions.
   In more than 20 recommendations, the safety board, an arm of the
Department of Transportation, urged a program be put into operation
to inspect the company's submerged pipelines and to maintain them
in accordance with permits requiring them to be safely buried.
   The board has no enforcement powers, but can only make
recommendations to governmental agencies and private companies for
safety improvements.
   The board urged safety programs be established to warn vessels
of the dangers of submerged pipelines and said navigation charts
should be revised to warn mariners that submerged pipelines may not
be safely buried.
   In discussing the accident, safety board members said there are
more than 18,000 miles of submerged pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico
alone but that the exact length of the system or the precise
location of all of its components is not known.
   ``There are no records to verify how many miles of pipeline are
out in the gulf,'' said board member Susan M. Coughlin.
   She questioned whether actual inspection of the pipeline system
should begin before promised technology is developed to do the job
without the costly and time consuming use of divers.
   But other members said the board has an obligation to the safety
of seafarers to urge that work begin now to see that submerged
pipelines are in fact safely buried.
   The safety board said that inspection by divers after the
accident showed that while the pipeline should have been buried
some nine feet below the sea bed, it was in fact lying on its
surface.
   When the Northumberland hit and ruptured it, the safety board
said, ``natural gas from the high pressure pipeline was released
and ignited, engulfing the vessel in flames within seconds.''

   Gov. Rudy Perpich sought the Democratic
nomination for a record fourth term Tuesday in the face of a strong
primary challenge from his former commerce commissioner, Mike Hatch.
   Six Independent-Republicans, including state Auditor Arne
Carlson, sought the GOP gubernatorial nomination.
   The state's other big race was between state Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Nichols and Carleton College political science
professor Paul Wellstone for the Democratic nomination to challenge
Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, who faced token opposition in the
GOP primary. A third Democrat in the race was Gene Schenk.
   Perpich had the Democrat-Farmer-Labor endorsement over Hatch and
Kent Herschbach, while the Independent-Republicans endorsed
businessman Jon Grunseth over Carlson and four other candidates,
including Doug Kelley, a former aide to U.S. Sen. Dave Durenberger
and a former federal prosecutor.
   The other GOP candidates were Beatrice Mooney, Mary Jane Rachner
and Samuel A. Faulk.
   In the Senate race, the Democrats endorsed Wellstone. Boschwitz
was opposed by John Zeleniak.

<TEXT>
   Perpich, 62, has served 10 years as governor, longer than anyone
in Minnesota history. Hatch, 41, campaigned in part on the theme
that the incumbent has been around too long and has become
distracted.
   Perpich had banked on the hope that voters would focus on
achievements such as Minnesota's improved economy and the June
visit of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Dubbed ``Governor
Goofy'' in a Jan. 22 Newsweek magazine article, the governor
referred to the moniker in one television ad while saying his
successes prove otherwise.
   Hatch's campaign contrasted his abortion-rights stance with
Perpich's anti-abortion stand, and said providing affordable health
care to all Minnesotans was a top goal.
   Wellstone actively campaigned for the Senate in a repainted
school bus. Because he continued working as agriculture
commissioner, Nichols limited his campaigning to nights and
weekends.
   Wellstone, a member of the Democratic National Committee, led
the Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign in Minnesota.
Nichols is a former state senator.

<HEAD>Secret Police Use Glasnost to Improve Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new public relations department in the KGB is
using a film titled ``The Secret War'' to wage a very open campaign
of its own to improve the security agency's tarnished image.
   ``We are having troubles because the Soviet public doesn't
understand what we do,'' said the head of the new section, Maj.
Gen. Alexander Karbainov.
   Since the advent of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost,
the Soviet press has been filled with accounts of terror by the
secret police in the early decades of Communist rule.
   Millions died and millions more were sent to labor camps,
particularly under Josef Stalin, whose bloody rule lasted from the
1920s until his death in 1953.
   ``Stalin turned the Cheka (secret police) into a virtual organ
of personal power,'' Karbainov told a news conference for Soviet
and foreign reporters in the Lubyanka, the drab downtown
headquarters of the security service.
   The Soviet foreign and domestic intelligence operations are
combined in one service, the KGB, unlike the United States, where
the functions are divided between the Central Intelligence Agency
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
   During the news conference, Karbainov disclosed little new about
the internal workings of the KGB, arguing it was necessary to
preserve secrecy about operations, budget and the number of
employees.
   ``Everything relating to the aims, directions and results of KGB
work should be open to the public, while methods, forms and
techniques used to perform specific operations and security agents
should remain hidden from public view for the time-being,'' he said.
   Karbainov, a 44-year-old former satellite communications
engineer, sketched out an ambitious public relations program he is
running from a labyrinth of rooms that includes the offices of
Felix Dzerzhinsky, founder of the Soviet secret police, and Yuri
Andropov, the former KGB chairman who headed the country in 1982.
   The KGB is releasing a long-delayed film, ``The Secret War,'' on
its battles with Western intelligence agencies, as well as
television specials on its efforts to fight terrorism, ethnic
violence and black-marketeering.
   KGB officers showed reporters an exhibition of photographs and
newspaper clippings of various Western intelligence operations
against the Soviet Union; all had been reported in the Soviet press.
   Karbainov said the KGB also is starting a promotional
periodical, and will issue accreditation to a limited number of
journalists to enter the Lubyanka to view the exhibitions and sip
coffee in a newly created ``press bar.''
   ``We're trying to fight the stereotypes of old,'' he said.

   NASA expects to be ready for another
attempt to launch Columbia on Tuesday at the earliest and will have
only a few days to get the shuttle off the ground, officials said
Tuesday.
   If Columbia fails to lift off next week, the mission will have
to wait until after Discovery is launched next month, said Bascom
Murrah, a NASA official in charge of Columbia's prelaunch
operations.
   ``We're doing the best we can,'' Murrah said. ``It's a tough
business.''
   Columbia's astronomy mission with a $150 million observatory
called Astro has been delayed twice by hydrogen leaks and once by
problems with a telescope aboard the shuttle. The latest scrub
occurred last week after hydrogen flooded the aft compartment.
   NASA installed a new set of recirculation pumps Monday and
planned to test them late Tuesday and early Wednesday by flushing
helium through the system.
   In the pumps that were removed earlier, helium tests failed to
find any leaks, said NASA spokesman George Diller. Officials
planned to try again with supercold liquid hydrogen to simulate
actual fueling conditions.
   Murrah said Columbia will be ready for launch no sooner than
Tuesday. NASA hoped to announce a launch date on Wednesday.
   Complicating matters for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration is the Air Force's plans to launch a Titan 4 rocket
with a secret military cargo early next week from nearby Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station. One to two days are needed between
launches because of range safety requirements.
   Also looming over NASA's flight plans is the need to launch
Discovery between Oct. 5 and Oct. 23 with a satellite that will
explore the sun's polar regions.
   If NASA misses that deadline, Discovery's $750 million mission
will have to be postponed until late 1991, when Earth is aligned
properly again with the sun and Jupiter.
   The satellite, called Ulysses, will use Jupiter's gravity to be
whipped into the proper orbit around the sun. It will be the first
spacecraft to circle over the sun's poles.
   Preparations for Discovery's flight have been running several
days behind because of a leak in the shuttle's cooling system, but
launch managers are juggling the work schedule to make up for the
lost time.
   The problem has been traced to a vent in an ammonia boiler, and
mission managers have recommended that Discovery fly with the leaky
boiler as long as the leak remains small. Given the amount of
leakage _ about 1 percent a day _ there would be more than enough
coolant to last the four-day flight, Diller said. The boiler is
needed to cool the shuttle during landings.

<TEXT>
   An Alabama professor urged a Senate committee
Tuesday to reject President Bush's nominee to a federal appeals
court because of his wife's current and his own previous membership
in an all-white country club.
   George Munchus III, associate professor of business at the
University of Alabama at Birmingham, said confirmation of U.S.
District Judge Joel Dubina to a seat on the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals would have ``a double chilling effect'' on civil rights
litigation in Georgia, Alabama and Florida.
   Munchus, who is executive director of the Center for Human
Rights in Birmingham, argued in testimony before the Judiciary
Committee that Dubina's resignation from the Montgomery Country
Club and his wife's subsequent membership ``is subterfuge of the
highest order and most reprehensible.''
   ``If non-whites and women are expected to have full faith and
confidence in our federal judicial... system, this country can ill
afford the Joel Dubina types to serve,'' Munchus said.
   The committee last month unanimously approved a non-binding
resolution which said that belonging to exclusionary clubs is
``inappropriate for persons who may be nominated in the future to
serve in the federal judiciary.''
   Dubina testified that his wife joined the club in 1986, shortly
after he had resigned his membership prior to his nomination as a
U.S. District Court judge.
   But Dubina said he has not visited the club nor enjoyed any club
privileges since resigning, and he said his wife has promised to
resign if the club ever rejects a qualified black applicant.
   During questioning by Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., prior to
Munchus' testimony, Dubina said the club does not bar members on
the basis of race or religion, but he acknowledged that it has no
black members. He said no black has ever applied for membership.
   After he resigned, Dubina said his wife was offered ``a lady
resident membership'' and she accepted. He said her grandfather was
a member, her father is a member, and she ``grew up in that club.''
   Two black lawyers from Montgomery, Kenneth Thomas and Circuit
Court Judge Charles Price, both testified in support of Dubina, who
was nominated to the seat that was left vacant when U.S. Circuit
Judge Robert Vance was killed in a mail-bomb explosion last
December.
   The all-white membership at another Birmingham Country Club,
Shoal Creek, threw professional golf into turmoil earlier this
month as some commercial sponsors threatened to withdraw from
televising the PGA Championship there. Shoal Creek later admitted a
black member.

<TEXT>
   Former President Reagan, once lambasted by
angry demonstrators in divided Berlin, was hailed Tuesday as a
returning hero.
   On Wednesday, Reagan is to cross into East Berlin at the
Brandenburg Gate, where he gave a speech in 1987 challenging Moscow
to tear down the Berlin Wall. That visit was marred by
demonstrations by 25,000 people opposed to U.S. foreign policy.
   Now that East and West Germany are to reunite in October, the
atmosphere is transformed. On Tuesday, the 79-year-old saw only
cheerful faces in his brief contact with the public.
   About 100 Germans and foreign tourists gathered outside the
Bristol Kempinski Hotel to see Reagan and his wife Nancy leave for
a diplomatic dinner. They applauded and called for autographs.
   The Berliner Morgenpost daily welcomed Reagan's visit with a
headline saying his walk through the Brandenburg Gate will mean
``Reagan's Dream Fulfilled.''
   Reagan and his wife arrived in Berlin early in the day to open a
10-day European trip.
   During his 1987 visit, Reagan voiced skepticism about reforms
started by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He said the one
thing Moscow could do to advance the cause of peace would be to
dismantle the Berlin Wall.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate,'' Reagan said. ``Mr. Gorbachev,
tear down this wall.''
   The former Communist rulers of East Germany opened the wall in
November in one of their last, desperate acts to stay in power.
   On Wednesday, Reagan will travel about a mile into East Berlin
to meet with officials there _ now democratically elected.

<HEAD>Asian Countries Hail Agreement Among Warring Cambodian Factions</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Communist Vietnam and pro-Western Asian
nations on Tuesday welcomed an agreement among Cambodia's warring
factions, but cautioned of further obstacles before peace comes to
that war-torn nation.
   The official Vietnam News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry
statement as saying the agreement Monday in Jakarta, Indonesia,
``is a decisive step leading to the reconvening of the Paris
international conference on Cambodia. The peace process, however,
still has to overcome numerous obstacles and hurdles.''
   ``Together with other countries participating in the Paris
international conference on Cambodia, Vietnam will do its best to
contribute to the success of the conference in achieving an overall
political solution to the Cambodia issue,'' it said.
   In Paris in July and August of 1989, 19 nations failed to
produce a peace accord and concluded there must be substantial
progress among the Cambodian factions themselves before the
conference could be reconvened.
   Vietnam has been the main backer of the Phnom Penh government.
   Most Southeast Asian nations have supported the three-party
guerrilla coalition, but also have stepped up mediation efforts in
recent years to end the 11-year-old civil war.
   A Thai government spokesman announced that Premier Hun Sen of
Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government will visit Thailand on
Wednesday to discuss the next step of the peace process with Prime
Minister Chatichai Choonhavan, a key mediator.
   The Cambodian government and the three guerrilla groups battling
it agreed in Indonesia to accept as a basis for a settlement a U.N.
Security Council plan. The plan calls for a major U.N. role in
administering the country until elections are held.
   The factions also agreed to form a Supreme National Council to
represent the country and be the source of authority during the
transitional period.
   Hun Sen also called in Jakarta for an immediate cease-fire, the
official Cambodian news agency SPK reported. It did not say how the
guerrillas responded, but they have previously supported a truce
only in the context of a comprehensive political settlement.
   The Security Council plan envisions a U.N. peacekeeping force of
as many as 10,000 soldiers and 10,000 civilian workers.
   The operation could cost the United Nations up to $5 billion
over one or two years, according to U.S. officials.
   State-run Radio Thailand reported Tuesday that Chatichai
welcomed the Jakarta agreement, and said his country may be willing
to join the U.N. peacekeeping force.
   Thailand gives aid and sanctuary to the guerrillas but also has
been a prime mediator since Chatichai took office in August 1988.
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke also reiterated his country
would be willing to contribute troops to the U.N. operation. He was
addressing the Parliament in Canberra.
   Foreign Minister Wong Kan Seng of Singapore, a major source of
arms for the guerrillas, welcomed the Jakarta agreement and said it
should be followed by reopening the Paris conference.
   The Japanese government, which hosted Cambodian peace talks in
June where the first consensus on the Supreme National Council was
reached, also welcomed the outcome at Jakarta.
   In the June talks, final agreement could not be reached because
of objections from the hard-line Khmer Rouge guerrilla group, which
said it was not being treated on an equal status with the
government.
   ``Of course, there still remain several problems, such as how
actual suspension of military actions is to be realized, how the
United Nations will be involved in the administration of that
country in the interim period, and other problems,'' Japanese
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Taizo Watanabe said.
   The guerrilla coalition consists of the Communist Khmer Rouge
and two non-Communist forces led by former Premier Son Sann and
Prince Norodom Sihanouk.
   The resistance coalition has been battling the government
Vietnam installed in Phnom Penh after it invaded in late 1978 and
toppled the Khmer Rouge.
   The Khmer Rouge had during nearly four years of rule tried to
transform Cambodia into a radical agrarian society, causing the
deaths of nearly 1 million people due mostly to starvation and
executions.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronaut Bruce McCandless II, who will be
remembered in history books as the first human to float free in
space, has retired from NASA and the Navy.
   While his name is not well known, his picture is. The photograph
of McCandless suspended against the black of space with the blue
Earth off to one side is one of the most famous.
   ``I've been government property since the age of 17,'' said
McCandless, 53, in an interview from the Johnson Space Center.
``I've been here for 24 years in the astronaut office. It was time
for a little bit of a change of pace.''
   McCandless, a Navy captain, remained in the service while
serving with NASA. He had to retire under Navy regulations because
he was not promoted to flag rank and had 32 years of service.
McCandless graduated from the Naval Academy, ranking second in a
class of 899.
   He said he hopes to work as a consultant with contractors
involved in the Hubble Space Telescope project. McCandless had a
key role, as an astronaut, in developing the telescope and he was
part of the space shuttle crew that launched it in April.
   McCandless helped develop the space agency's Manned Maneuvering
Unit, a jet-powered backpack, and was the first to wear it in space
on a flight in February 1984.
   He was the first human to move in space untethered, looking like
a helpless teddy bear swaddled in white.
   ``That may have been one small step for Neil, but it's a heck of
a big leap for me,'' said McCandless as he floated out of the cargo
of space shuttle Challenger. He was parodying Neil Armstrong's
first words when he stepped on the moon on July 20, 1969.

   Officials of states that claim they
are becoming the nation's toxic waste dumps criticized the federal
government Tuesday for not penalizing states that fail to take care
of their own hazardous poisons.
   Environmental officials from 13 of the 17 states that receive
more toxic waste for disposal than they ship out opened a two-day
conference to form an association that could file lawsuits against
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   Top EPA officials appeared before the state representatives, who
demanded that the EPA get tough on violators of a 1986 federal
program aimed at making states deal with hazardous waste.
   The ``capacity assurance'' program required all states to come
up with a toxic waste disposal plan. EPA officials said all 50
states and the District of Columbia met last October's deadline for
submitting proposed plans but only 38 were approved by the federal
agency.
   Alabama and South Carolina, with major hazardous waste landfills
inside their borders, organized the association of ``net importer
states'' to work collectively to make exporter states share the
disposal problem.
   ``If you don't do something pretty quickly, you will force the
states to do something we don't want to do,'' Bill Child,
representing the Illinois state EPA, told Russ Wyer, director of
the Waste Management Division at EPA headquarters in Washington.
   Leigh Pegues, director of the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management, said a lawsuit against EPA was not out of
the question. He said EPA Administrator Bill Riley and his deputy,
Hank Habicht, turned down invitations to attend the Alabama meeting.
   Wyer promised to return to Washington with the states'
complaints but did not promise EPA would take stronger measures
against non-complying states. However, he said the agency would
``evaluate sanctions'' that could be imposed for failure to meet
the deadline in the capacity assurance program.
   The ``net importer states'' claim EPA has failed to withhold
Superfund cleanup money from states that have failed to meet the
program's requirements.
   ``They haven't done anything,'' said Pegues, whose state is home
to the nation's largest commercial hazardous waste landfill, a
toxic dump run by Chemical Waste Management Inc. at Emelle in rural
west Alabama.
   EPA officials blamed regional differences throughout the country
and the problems some states have with the staffing of their
environmental agencies, which are assigned the job of complying
with the federal program.
   At a luncheon Tuesday, Alabama Gov. Guy Hunt said Alabama and
the 16 other importer states ``continue to manage more than our
share of the problem.''
   Asked about the possibility of a lawsuit against EPA, N.G. Kaul,
representing the New York Department of Environmental Conservation,
said that would be a ``last resort.''
   But he said the EPA has yet to act against New Jersey, which,
according to Kaul, has been ``looking for a landfill site almost 10
years.''
   Greer Tidwell, director of the Atlanta regional office of the
federal EPA, promised the state officials he would try to arrange a
meeting next month with top EPA officials in Washington to discuss
the state officials' complaints about the agency.
   Delegates to the coastal conference represent California,
Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Nevada, New York, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, South Carolina and Alabama, according to
Catherine Lamar, a spokeswoman for the Alabama Department of
Environmental Management.
   Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho and Oregon are among the 17 net
importer states but did not have representatives at the meeting.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney disclosed
Tuesday that the cost of the U.S. military buildup in the Middle
East could total $15 billion in the next fiscal year, but promised
disgruntled lawmakers ``a significant increase'' in help from Arab
nations and other American allies.
   Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
giving Congress its first major update on the massive American
military deployment that was begun in early August.
   Cheney's cost figure was above the $1 billion-a-month estimate
generally used by government officials, and he added that costs
``would multiply many fold'' if U.S. troops become involved in
combat.
   Several senators used Tuesday's session to show their distress
over the amounts of military backing supplied by Arab nations in
the region, and financial support from U.S. allies heavily
dependent upon Persian Gulf oil supplies.
   ``There's something missing here,'' protested the committee
chairman, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., complaining that no Arab military
forces with heavy armaments such as tanks or artillery were on the
ground in Saudi Arabia.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, criticized both the West German
government and the Japanese for offering little support to an
operation that was vital to keeping oil supplies flowing to their
economies.
   ``I find it appalling,'' Cohen told Cheney and the general.
``This kind of cooperation from the allies ... is not going to
stand well with me and I hope with a lot of other members'' when it
comes time to consider the amount of U.S. funding that will go to
U.S. military forces helping provide for the defense of Western
Europe and the Far East.
   In his testimony, Cheney told the senators that by Sept. 30, the
end of the 1990 fiscal year, ``we will have spent more than $2.7
billion in additional costs over and above budgeted funds'' on the
new operation in the Middle East.
   ``We expect these incremental costs to total about $15 billion
in fiscal year 1991 if the crisis continues for the entire fiscal
year,'' Cheney's statement said. ``If the conflict occurs, these
costs would multiply many fold.''
   Such costs would wipe out any ``peace dividend'' derived from
cuts in Pentagon spending in reaction to easing of tensions in
Europe _ absent contributions by U.S. allies to help pay the bill
for Operation Desert Shield.
   Three nations _ Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates _ said this week they would contribute about $12 billion
to the Mideast effort against Iraq, including money for nations
hurt by their support of the economic embargo.
   Cheney said he couldn't pledge that the total cost of the U.S.
operation would be offset, ``but I think a sizeable amount will
be.''
   Meanwhile, a Pentagon spokesman said Tuesday the United States
had detected ``some increase in military activity'' inside Iraq
near its borders with Turkey and Syria, ``but there is nothing to
indicate imminent hostilities.''
   The spokesman, Pete Williams, said that while the forces'
posture remained defensive, it could become offensive ``very
quickly.''
   On another subject, Williams said the naval embargo operation
had logged some 750 intercepts, but he cautioned that those can
involve the same ship being contacted more than once.
   He said some 40 boardings have been conducted, including 35 by
U.S. ships. He would not disclose the names of the other nations
involved.
   Also, Williams disclosed that permission has been granted for
U.S. troops to conduct live-fire training exercises in Saudi Arabia.
   The approval was granted Monday for the live firing of artillery
and guns up to 105 mm, and approval was being sought for 120 mm
weapons, he said.
   At the Senate hearing, Cheney said the Pentagon was ``taking
measures'' to enhance the protection of U.S. troops and civilians
overseas and at home, believing that ``terrorism is potentially a
significant weapon in the Iraqi arsenal.''
   The State Department returned Iraq to its list of states
abetting and aiding terrorism on Sept. 4, Cheney said.
   ``During this period of heightened tension, the terrorist threat
to our forces in Saudi Arabia and to U.S. personnel and interests
worldwide is, and will remain, high,'' Cheney's testimony said.
   Cheney disclosed that U.S. officials ``have received bomb
threats, death threats, and verbal warnings from international
terrorist organizations'' but he added that ``no specific credible
threats'' have yet been identified.
   On the subject of contributions by nations benefiting from U.S.
defense of Saudi Arabia, Cheney told the senators, ``I can assure
you that is a subject we are working on.''
   ``There are in fact forces from other Arab nations en route, or
will shortly be en route, a significant increase in the military
capability of the allies' forces that are being deployed,'' Cheney
said.
   However, Powell interjected that ``these other forces are still
some time from being there.''
   Cheney reminded that the Egyptians and Moroccans, as well as
``eight, nine, ten,'' other Arab countries have pledged to increase
their commitments to the region. But Nunn dismissed the
contributions as ``very small'' in number and ``very light'' in
terms of armament.
   Cheney also noted that few countries other than the United
States have the logistical capability of moving heavy forces abroad.

<HEAD>Catholic Panel Investigates Contributions to Woman Involved with
Archbishop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Catholic review committee is
investigating a Georgia parish's charitable contributions to the
woman whose intimate relationship with former Atlanta Archbishop
Eugene A. Marino led to his resignation.
   The Rev. Peter Dora, spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of
Atlanta, said Tuesday that St. Pius X Church in Conyers, Ga., gave
Vicki Long $1,000 to $2,000 over several years.
   Dora said the Rev. John P. Walsh, pastor of St. Pius, turned
financial records over to the archdiocese after the review
committee was appointed last month.
   At the time the money was given, Walsh was unaware Ms. Long was
receiving money from anyone else, Dora said. ``He certainly was not
aware she was involved with anyone in the church,'' he added.
   Dora said Walsh had been at St. Pius about two years and had
served at St. John's in Hapeville, where Ms. Long is a member now,
from 1979 to 1983. He said he did not know when the money, which
came from the St. Pius parish funds for the poor, was given to Ms.
Long.
   He also said Walsh ``has stated unequivocally that he was not
involved'' with Ms. Long.
   Walsh was not at his church Tuesday and could be reached for
comment. Ms. Long's attorney, Gloria Allred of Los Angeles, did not
immediately return a phone call.
   The review committee also is examining the financial records of
the archdiocese and two parishes pastored by the Rev. Michael
Woods, who resigned Aug. 4, saying he had been intimately involved
with Ms. Long.

<HEAD>Attorneys Differ on Whether Rodney Dangerfield Deserves Respect</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Rodney Dangerfield said Tuesday
comic who complains of getting no respect received none when he was
allegedly injured in a steam room accident at Caesars Palace in
March 1988.
   But an attorney for the resort countered that Dangerfield
created his own problems, saying the eye injuries he blamed on
Caesars were self-inflicted.
   Caesars' lawyer Louis Meisinger told jurors in U.S. District
Court in his opening statement they would know why Dangerfield gets
no respect once the civil trial ends.
   Dangerfield is suing Caesars for $225,000 in lost wages plus
damages of $5 million in connection with the accident. Caesars is
countersuing Dangerfield for $100,000 plus punitive damages.
   Dangerfield left Caesars following the March 1988 incident. He
now performs across the Strip, at Bally's Hotel.
   Attorney Barry Langberg said Dangerfield had performed nearly
1,000 shows in Las Vegas without a cancellation until his eyes were
burned in the steam room accident March 16, 1988.
   He said Caesars tried to escape blame for the accident and
refused to pay Dangerfield $225,000 for five performances he missed
after the accident.
   Meisinger described Dangerfield as a ``petulant performer'' and
said his injuries were ``a figment of his fertile, comedic
imagination.'' He called on the jury to ``send a message to
peformers like Mr. Dangerfield that they are not special and cannot
do things like that.''
   Lawyers for both sides huddled for more than an hour before
opening arguments began Tuesday, reviewing a series of motions. One
issue is whether to allow claims raised by Caesars in court papers
filed last month.
   The resort claimed in the papers that Dangerfield used large
amounts of marijuana, cocaine and vodka.
   Dangerfield denied the allegations Monday. ``Anybody who knows
me knows it's untrue,'' he said after jury selection.
   The drug issue was not raised in opening arguments.
   Langberg said Dangerfield's eyes were injured by a burst of
steam when he entered a steam room.
   Dangerfield missed shows March 17, 18 and 19, when two shows
were scheduled, then performed shows March 20 and 21 while in pain,
Langberg said.
   Caesars officials paid Dangerfield for only three nights on
March 22. He went on stage and announced to a packed house that he
wouldn't be performing that night, and suggested the audience get
their money back, Meisinger said.
   ``We think this is a simple case that the Caesars that injured
Rodney Dangerfield through its negligence should pay him,''
Langberg contended.
   Meisinger said Dangerfield is attempting to blame Caesars for an
eye problem the comic has had since the 1970s. He said
Dangerfield's eye problems have been compounded by a medication he
continues to use despite doctors' warnings that it could severely
damage his eyes. He said Dangerfield applied the medication to his
eyes 10 times in one hour the day after the steam room incident.
   ``Mr. Dangerfield essentially applied poison to his own eyes,''
Meisinger said. ``The injury was a self-inflicted act by Mr.
Dangerfield.''
   Meisinger said Dangerfield visited doctors in the days after the
accident.
   ``These doctors will testify they thought he could have
performed, but they thought he was not motivated to perform,''
Meisinger said. ``This is a case of a performer who got very, very
mad when Caesars said `we expect you to live up to your contract.'

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Troops loyal to slain President Samuel
Doe bombarded rebels from atop the executive mansion Tuesday, and a
West African leader said Doe's death would make it more difficult
to end the war.
   Two days after rebels led by Prince Johnson attacked Doe and his
entourage at the headquarters of the West African task force, the
late president's men used heavy cannons to beat back insurgents.
   Throughout Monrovia, shells exploded and gunfire crackled as
Prince Johnson's fighters scoured the city for Doe loyalists.
   Survivors from Doe's elite presidential guard turned heavy
artillery, placed on the roof of the seaside executive mansion,
onto the rebels and the war-ravaged city. The guns normally face
out toward the Atlantic Ocean.
   Gambian President Sir Dawda Jawara said Doe's men had asked the
five-nation West African force to help them evacuate the capital.
Jawara said aid would be offered on humanitarian grounds.
   ``I think it is now urgent to try and do something about
protecting these 230 or so Doe supporters from factional or tribal
revenge,'' said Jawara, chairman of the 16-member Economic
Community of West African States.
   The Community ordered a 3,000-member task force into Liberia
last month to help quell the 8{-month-old civil war, often marked
by tribal fighting. The soldiers are from Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea,
Sierra Leone and Gambia.
   Jawara, who was visiting Zimbabwe, said that rather than
speeding the war's end, Doe's death Monday likely would increase
bloodshed.
   Witnesses said Doe's mutilated body was on display at Johnson's
headquarters outside the city. Johnson had said Doe would be
court-martialed, but within a day of his capture Sunday he was
reported dead from gunshot wounds.
   The West African force commander, Lt. Gen. Arnold Quainoo of
Ghana, said Tuesday that 78 people were killed when Johnson's men
attacked Doe's entourage on Sunday. Among the dead was Defense
Minister Brig. Gen. J. Boima Barclay.
   Quainoo said in a statement Doe told him he had come to express
his surprise that Quainoo had not paid him a courtesy call.
   The statement said: ``General Doe talked at length to the effect
that he was not ready to submit the sovereignty of his country to
any power or indeed regional organization.''
   Quainoo said Doe accused the United States of destroying
Liberia. Doe said he ``feared no one and would fight to the end.''
   The statement said Johnson and about 40 of his men then arrived
and protested Doe's visit. An argument ensued that degenerated into
a shootout.
   Quainoo and other West African officers tried to persuade
Johnson and his men to stop, ``but failed, except that they did not
kill Doe, who was shot in the legs and taken away.''
   Doe's removal from power had been the key demand of Johnson's
rival, Charles Taylor. But Taylor's spokesman, Tom Woewiyu, said
Taylor now was insisting on withdrawal of the West African force
before accepting a truce.
   Plumes of smoke rose Tuesday and sounds of gunfire and shelling
echoed from eastern Sinkor suburb, from where Taylor's fighters
again tried to move into Monrovia.
   It was unclear how strong Taylor's forces are. At one point he
claimed 10,000 fighters. But reporters who visited his camp said
many insurgents have returned to their villages, and those who
remain include many young boys with no training.
   Taylor, a former bureaucrat, overran much of Liberia with little
difficulty after leading a rebel army in an invasion Dec. 24. But
he has been blocked in the eastern suburbs of Monrovia for more
than two months.
   Johnson, a former lieutenant in Doe's army, broke with Taylor
earlier this year and advanced on the capital.
   In Abidjan, capital of Ivory Coast, a group of Johnson
supporters took over the Liberian Embassy. Ambassador Harold Tarr
and his staff abandoned the office Monday after they heard Doe was
dead.
   Liberia has been without effective government for months. Since
mid-July, Monrovia has been torn by fighting involving the two
rebel armies and Doe loyalists. Much of the capital is without food
and water.
   An interim government named at a national unity conference in
Gambia on Aug. 30 _ but rejected by Taylor _ said Tuesday it was
sending a delegation to Monrovia to prepare its installation.
   Sources close to Amos Sawyer, who was named president of the
interim government at the Aug. 30 conference, said he was urged to
send envoys by Johnson and Brig. Gen. David Nimley, whom Doe
loyalists named acting president.
   Doe took power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist
descendants of freed American slaves who had discriminated against
Liberian natives. The rebels accused Doe of misappropriation of
state funds and other corruption.
   But the civil war has been fought largely upon tribal lines. Doe
was from the Krahn people, one of 14 small tribes in Liberia.
Johnson is the son of a Gio, and Taylor is of mixed
Americo-Liberian and native ancestry.
   Americo-Liberians are the descendents of American slaves who
founded Liberia in 1847.

   TV coverage of a superpower huddle to discuss
the Middle East crisis and a late-summer premiere proved no
competition for the Miss America pageant, which was the
most-watched show on television last week.
   Saturday night's crowning of Marjorie Judith Vincent from
Illinois breezed past a CBS update on the Helsinki superpower
summit and NBC's debut of ``The Fanelli Boys'' situation comedy,
according to figures released Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   NBC's live broadcast of the Miss America pageant grabbed a 17.8
average rating, well ahead of the network's ``The Golden Girls,''
which occupied the No. 2 spot with a 15.9 average.
   Each ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
   In the No. 6 slot was Sunday's ``60 Minutes,'' featuring a
segment by Dan Rather in Helsinki, where President Bush and Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev discussed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Landing in the No. 4 spot was NBC's Saturday night premiere of
``The Fanelli Boys,'' a half-hour program focusing on four Italian
brothers in Brooklyn and their widowed mother.
   NBC again won the overall prime-time ratings war with a 10.7
average. ABC scored a 9.4, barely edging out CBS with 9.3.
   With the exceptions of ``The Fanelli Boys,'' ``60 Minutes'' and
the Miss America pageant, reruns dominated every other position in
the Top 10.
   Finishing third was NBC's ``Cheers.'' In fifth place was ABC's
``America's Funniest Home Videos.'' CBS's ``Designing Women'' tied
for seventh place with ABC's ``Roseanne.''
   ``A Different World,'' on NBC was No. 9. NBC's ``The Cosby
Show'' locked with the network's ``Unsolved Mysteries'' in a tie
for 10th place.
   Bill Cosby and his family again topped Bart Simpson and his
animated clan, as ``The Simpsons'' ranked 53rd in its second week
since moving to Thursdays at 8 p.m., opposite ``The Cosby Show.''
   ABC continued to trounce the competition in network news wars.
The latest ratings showed Peter Jennings and ABC well in front with
a 9.8 average. CBS and Dan Rather were second with 8.4 and NBC and
Tom Brokaw were last with 8.3.
   Here are the top 10 prime-time shows, their network and rating:
   ``Miss America Pageant,'' NBC, 17.8; ``The Golden Girls,'' NBC,
15.9; ``Cheers,'' NBC, 15.4; ``The Fanelli Boys,'' 15; NBC,
``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC, 14.8; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS,
14.7; ``Designing Women,'' CBS, ``Roseanne,'' ABC (tie), 14.2; ``A
Different World,'' NBC, 13.8; ``The Cosby Show,'' NBC, ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' NBC (tie), 13.7.

<HEAD>Judge Rebuffs Attempt to Withdraw Guilty Plea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Tuesday denied a motion by
convicted spy Jonathan J. Pollard to withdraw his 1986 guilty plea
to selling a wide range of defense secrets to Israel.
   U.S. District Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. also rejected
allegations by Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz
that federal prosecutors improperly supplied the judge with
information that influenced the decision to impose a life sentence
on the former civilian Navy intelligence analyst.
   Dershowitz based his allegation on a conversation he says he had
last fall with former Supreme Court Justice Arthur Goldberg, who
died Jan. 19 at the age of 81, according to court papers unsealed
Tuesday by Robinson.
   Dershowitz said in an affidavit that Goldberg told him of a
conversation with Robinson in which the judge explained why he gave
Pollard a life sentence.
   Goldberg quoted Robinson as saying that information from
prosecutors that Pollard had sold Israel U.S. spy satellite photos
of tests of Israeli-made missiles in South Africa ``weighed
heavily'' in the decision to impose a life sentence, according to
the affidavit.
   In his opinion, Robinson denied receiving the information, which
he said was false, and added that the claim of improper contact by
prosecutors ``is based upon pure hearsay, twice over.''
   The judge rejected a defense request that he retire from the
case.
   Pollard received a life sentence in 1987 for his guilty plea to
conspiracy to commit espionage.
   At sentencing, prosecutors said that Pollard had given Israel
enough classified documents to fill a large closet.
   In his motions, Pollard claimed that prosecutors reneged on
their promise not to seek life sentence by framing their
pre-sentence arguments to ensure that Robinson imposed the life
term anyway.
   Prosecutors denied in court papers that they improperly gave
Robinson any information about Pollard's spying that was not
produced during the trial.
   The government noted that the testing of the Israeli Jericho
missiles in South Africa did not occur until July 1989, ``and
hardly could have formed the basis of a sentencing decision made in
1987.''
   ``We think it more likely that, assuming that there was some
conversation between Chief Judge Robinson and Justice Goldberg,
that they discussed current events, and that their conversation has
been distorted in the retelling,'' said a government brief.
   Dershowitz, who served as one of Goldberg's law clerks in the
1960s, quoted the former justice as saying that he thought that
because Robinson is black, he would be ``particularly sensitive''
to evidence of an Israeli-South African connection.
   Robinson did not specifically say whether he ever talked with
Goldberg about the case except to say: ``The court's recollection
of events is in stark contradition to that claim.''
   Prosecutors dryly noted in their pleadings that it was
convenient for Dershowitz to claim he received information from
someone now deceased.
   This argument prompted Pollard's defense attorney, Hamilton P.
Fox III, to file a separate affidavit stating that Dershowitz
contacted him almost two months before Goldberg's death to relate
the details of the conversation.
   Goldberg was appointed to the Supreme Court by President Kennedy
but resigned from the high court when President Johnson named him
ambassador to the United Nations.

   The envoy of the Arab League said Tuesday
he is resigning because he opposes Arab acceptance of the U.S.-led
military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   It was the second time this month a top official has announced
his intention to step down from his post at the 21-nation
organization, which is deeply torn by divisions over the gulf
crisis.
   The group's U.N. envoy, Clovis Maksoud, appealed Tuesday that
the ``wound inflicted on Kuwait ... not lead to amputation of part
of the Arab body politic.''
   Maksoud told a news conference he can longer no longer reconcile
his own convictions in favor of a larger Arab role with Arab
acceptance of the buildup of U.S. and foreign forces in the gulf.
   He complained that Arab nations were losing credibility because
of their failure to act together. He said they were becoming
``marginalized'' because the United States, not an Arab front, was
resisting Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
   He said Arabs must seek a ``third way'' between accepting Iraqi
domination of Kuwait and allowing the U.S. military buildup.
Hundreds of thousands of U.S. and Iraqi troops are poised on
opposite sides of the Kuwaiti-Saudi border in a standoff.
   Maksoud said he favored ``breathing space'' to permit an Arab
solution to what he called an Arab problem, including a significant
Arab military force to replace the U.S.-led military operation.
   In his comments, Maksoud also said the gulf crisis should not
deflect Arab states from their fundamental aim of reaching a just
settlement with Israel.
   Maksoud, a Lebanese scholar who has represented the league for
11 years at the United Nations and in Washington, said he had
sought unsuccessfully to resign in August because of fatigue and
philosophical differences.
   On Tuesday, he said he would step down but pledged to remain in
a caretaker capacity until a successor is chosen.
   On Sept. 3, Chedli Klibi of Tunisia, secretary-general of the
Arab League, resigned his post.
   Some diplomats said he was upset about the decision to move the
Arab League headquarters back to Cairo from Tunis.
   Maksoud said his own decision had nothing to do with the Cairo
move.
   Egypt took the lead last month at an Arab League summit in Cairo
to respond to the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. A majority of members
decided to send forces to the Persian Gulf to counter Iraq.
   In his comments Tuesday, Maksoud said that he favors an Iraqi
withdrawal, restoration of Kuwait's government, a pullout of
foreign forces, and a temporary deployment of an Arab force.

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Move For More Tax Collectors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Tuesday rejected President
Bush's request for money to hire 1,050 more tax collectors but
approved $80.4 million for a new federal courthouse in
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert C. Byrd's home state.
   On a 93-6 vote, the Senate approved a $20.7 billion
appropriations bill covering spending by the Treasury Department,
Postal Service, offices of Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle, and
several other agencies in fiscal 1991, beginning Oct. 1.
   Voting against the legislation were Sens. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.,
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; Trent Lott, R-Miss.;
Connie Mack, R-Fla., and William Roth, R-Del.
   The bill slashes the $6.1 billion that Bush wanted to spend this
year on buying new computers for the Internal Revenue Service and
expanding its enforcement capabilities by a total of $228 million.
   But it adds more than $170 million for lawmakers' pet projects
in the form of new construction for the General Services
Administration, the government's landlord, to a version the House
approved in July.
   Included in that amount is the $80.4 million for a proposed new
federal building-courthouse in Charleston, W.Va., the capital of
Democrat Byrd's home state.
   By a 65-34 vote, the Senate effectively rejected an effort by
Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, to restore Bush's request for $55.5
million to hire 1,050 more IRS agents to try to recover some of the
estimated $96 billion in uncollected taxes and penalties owed the
government from 1989 alone.
   Opponents said the amendment would violate the budget law
without cuts in other areas.
   ``This is not a budget buster; it's a revenue raiser,'' Glenn
retorted, citing estimates by congressional auditors and the IRS
that the new agents would raise at least $2 for every dollar spent
on hiring them.
   However, neither Glenn nor any other lawmaker mentioned the
proposed new West Virginia courthouse or other senators' pet GSA
projects in the legislation. The bill now go to a conference
between House and Senate negotiators.
   By a 63-36 vote, the Senate rejected an effort by Helms to put
it on record in firm opposition to abortion as part of a United
Nations convention on the rights of children.
   Helms wanted to attach his measure to an amendment by Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J., urging Bush to sign the U.N. convention on the
rights of children and sending it to the Senate for ratification.
Bradley's amendment was later adopted on a voice vote.
   ``The reason we were able to get this convention passed last
year by the United Nations ... was that it was neutral on
abortion,'' Bradley said, urging defeat of Helms' measure. ``It's
left entirely to the laws of the nations.''
   Also adopted on a 97-2 vote was a non-binding resolution by Sen.
John Heinz, R-Pa., saying that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
should be tried as a war criminal if fighting erupts between his
and U.S. troops in the Middle East. Voting against the resolution
were Sens. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., and Bob Kerry, D-Neb.
   In addition to the IRS cuts, the Senate also trimmed the request
by Bush and the House's appropriation for the U.S. Postal Service
by $14 million to $508.7 million.
   And the Senate trimmed another $50.3 million from Bush's request
for running the White House but left intact the administration's
recommended appropriation of $626,000 for operating and renovating
Quayle's government-provided home in Washington.
   The House had approved all of the $329.97 million sought by Bush
for running the White House and the various executive offices such
as the Office of Management and Budget and the Council of
Environmental Quality directly under the president.
   Also added to the House version of the bill was a measure sought
by government executives over the past five years to revise the
federal pay system by linking salaries to comparable private jobs
in various cities.
   While federal pay is higher for many jobs in some low-cost
areas, nationwide it is 28 percent below the average paid by
private businesses for identical skills, according to government
studies.
   In a major compromise with the administration, the bill would
give the president authority to revise the pay system but would
also allow him to adjust the appropriate levels downward.
   The Senate has estimated the cost of catching federal workers up
to their private industry counterparts in high-cost cities at $5
billion over the next five years.
   Another pay amendment by Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., added
to the legislation would increase the wages of some 60,000 federal
law enforcement officers by $2,000 to $5,000 a year.

   The Bush administration on Tuesday threatened
a veto of a $283 billion military spending bill if approved by the
House, contending the package would hamper U.S. efforts against
Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams raised the veto possibility as
the House took up the military blueprint for fiscal 1991 in a
climate of diminishing concern about the Soviet Union but growing
worry about Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   ``If the House bill is enacted in its present form, then the
president's senior advisers and the secretary would recommend that
the president veto it,'' Williams said at a Pentagon briefing.
   The bill, crafted by the House Armed Services Committee prior to
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, would slash nearly $2 billion from
President Bush's request for the Strategic Defense Initiative, halt
production of the B-2 bomber and cut U.S. troop strength by 129,500.
   Williams singled out those provisions, in particular the troop
reduction that far exceeds the 38,000 proposed by the
administration.
   ``That would pose an undue risk to national security, greatly
complicate the department's ability to deal with the current crisis
in the gulf and also rob the department of the flexibility we need
to manage the force draw-down in an effective way,'' he said.
   The Pentagon spokesman also criticized a provision in the bill
that would require the Defense Department to come up with a plan by
1994 to ``dual base'' all military units _ permanently stationing
all American troops in the United States and ordering short-term
rotations overseas.
   ``A U.S. withdrawal worldwide would create a potential vacuum
and increase the potential for regional differences to turn into
major crises,'' Williams said.
   Rep. David O'B. Martin, R-N.Y., sponsor of an amendment to
eliminate the dual-basing provision, said if the measure ``isn't a
return to isolationism, I don't know what would be.''
   The House planned to take up that issue Wednesday as well as
several amendments requiring U.S. allies to share a larger portion
of the cost of stationing troops overseas.
   The main proponent of dual-basing, Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., said last week that the recent deployment of U.S. troops
to the gulf strengthens her argument.
   ``We're much better off keeping people in the United States
rather than these very expensive, forward deployed'' locations,
said Schroeder who chairs the House Armed Services subcommittee on
military installations and facilities.
   In action on the bill Tuesday, the House rejected an amendment
that would have forced the Navy to close the planned ``home port''
battleship base at New York City's Staten Island, an installation
in which the Pentagon has invested more than $230 million.
   By a vote of 230-188, the House approved a measure that would
prevent closure until after a Pentagon plan on naval installations
is submitted to Congress.
   The decision was a victory for Rep. Susan Molinari, R-N.Y., a
lawmaker who has served in the House for just six months, and a
defeat for Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., a senior member of the
House Armed Services Committee and chairman of the seapower
subcommittee.
   Molinari, who represents Staten Island, argued that the facility
is more than 95 percent complete and singling out one installation
for closing would undermine the all-or-none base closure process
adopted by the House several years ago.
   ``Your military installation could be next,'' Molinari warned
members always conscious of projects in their home districts.
   She shared her victory with her father, Guy, a former member and
the Staten Island borough president who made a rare appearance in
the House to help his daughter.
   The House also overwhelmingly approved a measure sponsored by
Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., to create a professional work
corps within the Pentagon to purchase weapons and other
defense-related items.
   Meanwhile, a group of House Republicans reaffirmed opposition to
the bill, saying that the $24 billion cut from Bush's request of
$307 billion in military spending for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 ``threatens the security of the United States.''
   In a statement issued after a meeting with Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney, the House Republican Policy Committee said the bill's
cuts in strategic modernization and personnel ``could seriously
jeopardize our nation's ability to undertake military operations
similar to Operation Desert Shield now under way in Saudi Arabia.''
   Democrats, however, hailed the legislation as an appropriate
response to the changing threat to the West.
   ``The House Armed Services Committee has fashioned a bill that
makes real progress toward restructuring United States military
forces to meet changing circumstances of the 1990s and beyond,''
Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla. said during debate on the House floor.

   Two suspected Colombian drug traffickers
were extradited to the United States on Tuesday, the first such
extraditions since President Cesar Gaviria took office last month.
   Jose Hilario Ortiz and Raul Hernan Buchelli, who both face drug
trafficking charges in the United States, were placed on board a
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration plane bound for Miami,
national police chief Gen. Miguel Gomez said in remarks broadcast
by the RCN radio network.
   Ortiz faces drug trafficking charges in Connecticut and Buchelli
is wanted in Florida, said a police spokesman, requesting
anonymity. No further details were immediately available.
   Buchelli is wanted on charges of conspiracy to smuggle and
distribute heroin and money laundering, while Ortiz pleaded guilty
to a cocaine trafficking conspiracy charge and fled the country
before sentencing, according to U.S. court records.
   Buchelli's brother, Guido Lucio, also faces drug trafficking
charges in the United States. But he was released last week after
the government rejected a U.S. request for his extradition, citing
insufficient evidence.
   Colombia has extradited 24 suspected drug traffickers to the
United States since August 1989, when the government launched a
major anti-drug crackdown after the murder of a presidential
candidate.
   Twelve of those extradited have either been convicted at trial
or pleaded guilty; one was acquitted. An additional nine are
awaiting trial.
   The crackdown prompted the Medellin cocaine cartel to declare
``total war'' on the government a year ago.
   Tuesday's extraditions were the first of suspected drug
traffickers to the United States since Gaviria was inaugurated Aug.
7. He has pledged to continue the war against the cocaine cartels
waged by his predecessor, Virgilio Barco.
   Last Wednesday, Gaviria modified the country's extradition
policy.
   In a nationally televised speech, Gaviria said drug traffickers
who turn themselves in and confess their crimes would be tried in
Colombia and not face extradition to the United States.
   Under the decree announced by Gaviria, Colombian judges would be
also empowered to impose shorter sentences for suspects who confess
and cooperate with local investigations.
   The country's drug barons have so far offered no reply to
Gaviria's offer.
   Gaviria's offer appeared to be, at least in part, a response to
repeated offers from the drug traffickers to surrender to Colombian
judges in return for a promise to end the extraditions that had
been resumed last year by Barco.
   The drug traffickers have feared extradition to the United
States because they would have little influence over the judicial
process there. Cocaine cartel members have traditionally been able
to either bribe or threaten their way out of Colombian jails.
Judges who refuse to be intimidated have often been slain.
   In his speech last week, Gaviria announced that three Colombians
would soon be extradited to the United States, but he said three
other U.S. extradition requests had been turned down.
   The third suspect set to be extradited, Joaquin Oswaldo Gallo
Chamorro, was still being held in Colombia on Tuesday. Authorities
did not say why he was not sent to the United States with Ortiz and
Buchelli.
   With the latest extraditions, the U.S. Justice Department is
still seeking to extradite 14 suspected drug traffickers held in
Colombia.
   Colombia's Cali and Medellin drug cartels supply most of the
cocaine consumed in the United States and Europe. Authorities blame
the Medellin for killing about 550 Colombians the past year,
including three presidential candidates.

<HEAD>Senate Endorses Prosecuting Saddam In Event of War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate overwhelmingly approved a
resolution Tuesday saying the United States should prosecute Saddam
Hussein and other Iraqi leaders as ``war criminals'' if hostilities
break out in the Persian Gulf.
   The non-binding resolution, passed on a 97-2 vote, declared that
Saddam ``has violated standards of civilized conduct by willfully
seeking to endanger the lives of foreign civilians in Kuwait and
Iraq.''
   The resolution was passed just hours before President Bush was
appearing before a joint House and Senate session to report on the
crisis triggered by Saddam's invasion and occupation of neighboring
Kuwait.
   ``It is the sense of the Senate that in the event of hostilities
between the United States and the government of Iraq, it shall be
the policy of the United States to pursue Saddam Hussein and other
such perpetrators as may be determined responsible in order to
bring them to justice as war criminals,'' it said.
   Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., the principal sponsor, told his
colleagues ``the most important way that we can safeguard our
hostages against any kind of harm coming to them in the future is
for the Senate to go on record by a recorded, overwhelming vote.''
   ``If Saddam Hussein and his henchmen place the hostages in
harm's way in the event of hostilities,'' Heinz said, ``we will see
to it that they are tried as war criminals just as surely as the
Nazi war criminals were tried, convicted and sent to punishment in
Nuremberg.''
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. said he shared the frustration of his
colleagues over the plight of Americans still in Iraq and Kuwait,
but said the resolution was reckless.
   ``I appreciate this is a sort of an amendment that looks
relatively harmless,'' Kerrey said. ``But it seems to be it's
possible, given that we've heard over and over and over that there
are people in this world that pay attention to our resolutions ...
that this sends precisely the opposite message.''
   ``I'm concerned for hostages. Everyone is,'' he said. ``But what
happens if this, in fact, sends precisely the opposite message. I'm
not skilled in the psychology of somebody who takes hostages and
holds them.''
   Heinz countered that ``this senator does not want to take the
chance that, by inaction, by our failure to speak out, that we
would run the very considerable risk that he (Saddam) might once
again misread the intentions of those of us who have legitimate
concerns.''
   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., said he thought the resolution was
premature, and asked Heinz whether the administration had requested
it.
   Heinz replied that he had consulted with administration
officials and that no objections had been raised.
   ``In the end, and there will be an end, Saddam Hussein will not
prevail,'' he said. ``And it is important for him to know that when
he comes to the end of this story, that justice will be done. That
message is probably the best message we can send against the kind
of mistreatment of our hostages that took place in Iran.''
   Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., joined Kerrey in voting against the
resolution, which was an amendment to a $20.7 billion
appropriations bill financing Treasury Department, Postal Service,
White House and other federal agencies.

   The Quebec government on Tuesday rejected an
offer from Mohawks holed up in this town west of Montreal to end a
two-month impasse by surrendering.
   In a brief statement by Premier Robert Bourassa, the government
called the proposal ``unacceptable'' because it ``contradicts
fundamental principles of democracy and our justice system.''
   ``There is no question of a special category of individuals
receiving treatment under the law different from any other citizen
of Quebec,'' the statement said.
   The Mohawk offer hinged on creation of a special commission that
would exercise ultimate authority for determining any criminal
charges. The panel would produce a final report within 60 days.
   The Mohawk proposal called for the commission to be composed of
Iroquois, Canadians, Quebecers and international human rights
delegates.
   It would oversee the surrender of about 50 Indians in a
drug-treatment center at the Kahnesatake community in Oka, about 18
miles from Montreal, said Oneida leader Bob Antone.
   The Mohawks, about half Warriors and half women and children,
retreated to the center on Sept. 1, when the army moved onto the
Mohawk settlement.
   Mohawks from Kahnesatake have been in a standoff with Quebec
police and the Canadian army since July over the attempt by Oka
officials to expand a golf course on land the Indians claim as
ancestral.
   On July 11, provincial police tried to storm a Mohawk barricade.
One officer was killed, but it is not clear by whose gunfire.
   Another community of Mohawks had blockaded a key Montreal bridge
in sympathy with the Kahnesatake Indians, but that bridge was
reopened last week.

<HEAD>Evanston, Ill., Mayor Promises Veto Of College Tuition Tax</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>

   A plan to tax Northwestern University
students will likely die in coming days. But curing the bad blood
that has developed between the city and school probably will take
longer, officials said Tuesday.
   ``I think it's a matter of getting people to talk more,'' said
university spokesman Ken Wildes. ``But then, I guess communications
is usually the problem.''
   In what City Clerk Kirsten Davis called ``an act of
desperation,'' the City Council in this north Chicago suburb of
75,000 voted 10-8 Monday to assess a tuition tax on students at
Northwestern and three other colleges. It would amount to up to $60
a year per student.
   Mayor Joan Barr immediately said she would veto the ordinance.
   The veto message will likely be put before the council at its
Sept. 24 meeting and there's little chance the two-thirds majority
could be mustered for an override, Ms. Davis said.
   The measure makes Evanston the first community in the nation to
impose a student tuition tax, according to the American Council on
Education. Council members said the tax was needed to compensate
the city for revenue lost through the schools' property tax
exemptions.
   The measure would apply to three other schools besides
Northwestern _ Kendall College, Garrett Evangelical Theological
Seminary and Seabury-Western Theological Seminary.
   But debate has centered on the city's best-known school. And
officials say Monday's vote was just a symptom of a longstanding
disagreement between the university and the lakefront community,
which estimates the tax would generate $500,000 a year.
   ``This whole tuition tax would have gone away if Arnold Weber
had gotten up and promised something _ some little thing,'' Ms.
Davis said, referring to Northwestern's president. ``It could be a
fire engine, it could be lower tuition for residents, it could be
creating a series of management seminars for city department heads.
   ``Just something to give us the feeling they would be good
corporate citizens.''
   City officials complain that Northwestern has refused to pay a
fee for city services such as police and fire protection. It pays
no property taxes on 242 acres of university-owned land and
buildings _ including some commercial property _ and has refused to
make a financial contribution to its host community, Ms. Davis said.
   ``There are a lot of little things they could have done,'' she
said. ``But everything we've asked, they've said no.''
   Evanston officials have estimated the city could have a $2.5
million budget deficit for the fiscal year starting in March. And
it's estimated that city residents already pay 25 percent more in
property taxes because the schools are exempt, Ms. Davis said.
   ``This problem has been a subject of discussion for probably 10
years,'' she said, adding that a tax like the one passed Monday has
twice been rejected by the council.
   But Northwestern's Wildes said the last time a tax was
considered, the city and university resolved the issue by agreeing
to work together toward economic development in Evanston.
   He said that, since 1983, the university has ``poured $25
million'' into such ventures, including a 26-acre research park
that helps fledgling businesses. Wildes said there haven't been any
conversations about additional contributions from Northwestern
since then.
   Northwestern officials also have noted that the school is the
largest employer in the city and generates millions of dollars in
business for local merchants. They also say they pay almost $1
million in utility taxes, plus a tax on sales of tickets to
athletic events.
   At Monday's meeting, Weber called the tax ``anti-education'' and
``anti-business,'' adding that more than 50 percent of the students
already receive extensive financial aid. Most of the school's
nearly 10,500 students are undergraduates who pay an annual tuition
of $13,725.

   The Agriculture Department is making it easier
for farmers to pay back the advance subsidies they received for
crops later lost to drought.
   The Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service had a
policy that farmers had to pay the money back all at once unless
they proved that would keep them from feeding or sheltering their
families.
   However, the conservation service decided last month to offer
installment plans to farmers who can show a one-time payment would
``create an undue financial hardship.'' The payments can be
stretched over three years at 9 percent interest, according to the
conservation service.
   County conservation service offices were notified of the policy
change on Aug. 22.
   ``We're trying to find a way so that those who need help can get
relief and work it out in three years,'' said Keith Bjerke,
administrator of the service.
   The government has collected more than $500 million of the $840
million in advance payments that farmers must pay back for 1988 and
1989, Bjerke said.
   Advance deficiency payments for 1988 and 1989 were supposed to
be paid back by July 31. Unless the farmer pays the money back or
works out an installment plan, the government can recover the money
by taking it out of future payments or loans.
   Farmers and members of Congress had been pressuring the
conservation service to relax its repayment policy.
   The Senate version of the 1990 farm bill contains a provision
that is more lenient than the new policy. The conservation service
would be required to offer installment plans to any farmer in a
county that received a disaster declaration for two of the previous
three years. Farmers in adjacent counties also would qualify.
   However, the farm bill is not expected to become law before
October.

   Imprisoning a 77-year-old woman because
she failed to tell where her daughter has been hiding with her two
children shows the U.S. court system at its worst, women's rights
advocates said Tuesday.
   Superior Court Judge Mark A. Pfeiffer on Monday sent Mary Pigeon
to prison for an indefinite term, saying he would release her only
if she tells where her daughter and granddaughters are.
   ``I'm really concerned about the inappropriateness of this type
of technique to squeeze information out of a 77-year-old woman,''
said Lynn Heufelder, director of the Women's Resource Center in
Newport.
   The Rhode Island Women's Political Caucus said the incarceration
``shows the judicial system at its worst.''
   The judge ``has shown little wisdom, no compassion and dangerous
rigidity,'' said Elizabeth Morancy, chairwoman of the caucus.
   Pfeiffer should have considered home confinement as an
alternative, she said.
   The National Organization for Women's Rhode Island affiliate
also objected to the decision, its president, Susan Luckel, said.
   ``We think it's reprehensible,'' she said, adding the group
would discuss the case at its Thursday meeting.
   Elaine Yates and the children, Kimberly Ann, then 3, and Kelly
Ann, then 10 months, left their Warwick home in August 1985 after
Mrs. Yates found her husband with another woman on the family boat.
   Ms. Morancy said Mrs. Pigeon's plight was a family rights issue,
a sentiment echoed by Ms. Heufelder.
   ``It seems to me at this point that the government is preying on
the family relationship and to pick on a 70-plus-year-old-woman for
a decision made by her daughter is not right,'' Ms. Heufelder said.
   Russell M. Yates Jr. later acknowledged hitting his wife and
cutting her forehead with a diamond ring when they argued about the
boat incident. After she left, he sued for custody of the children
and won when his wife did not contest the lawsuit. He then sued
Mrs. Pigeon, seeking the girls' return.
   The couple has not divorced. Yates says he does not want to give
his wife the legal opportunity to change her and the girls' names.
   A year ago, Pfeiffer ordered Mrs. Pigeon to tell her son-in-law
where his wife and daughters are and to pay $23,000 in damages. No
money has been paid.
   When Monday's deadline came with no disclosure of the family's
whereabouts, Pfeiffer said he was left with ``no alternative'' but
to send Mrs. Pigeon to jail for contempt of court.
   ``I have no desire to punish this woman,'' he said.
   Mrs. Pigeon has maintained she does not know where her daughter
took her granddaughters. Pfeiffer says he believes otherwise.
   ``I feel very sad about it, and I wish Elaine would come home,''
Mrs. Pigeon said after the sentencing.
   Mrs. Pigeon was working at the Adult Correctional Institutions,
spokesman Joseph DiNitto said.
   ``She's down in our kitchen,'' DiNitto said. ``It's very light
janitorial work, sweeping floors, stuff like that.''

   Former Vermont Gov. Richard A. Snelling's comeback bid got off
to a fast start Tuesday as he swept to the Republican nomination
for the office he once held for four terms. Also trying a comeback
was ousted Gov. Evan Mecham of Arizona.
   In the nation's capital, Jesse Jackson was making his first run
for an office other than president.
   Arizona Republicans were deciding whether to give Mecham another
shot at the office he lost 2{ years ago through impeachment.
Pre-election polls showed him trailing Phoenix developer J. Fife
Symington. Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard was heavily favored
to emerge as the Democratic nominee.
   Incumbents challenged within their own parties included Gov.
Rudy Perpich of Minnesota and Rep. Roy Dyson of Maryland, both
Democrats.
   Vermont's lone congressman, Republican Peter Smith, was
challenged by conservative Timothy Philbin, who pledged to serve
only one term if elected.
   Snelling, who defeated Richard Gottlieb, will face Democrat
Peter Welch, who also overwhelmed his primary opponent, William
Gwin.
   With 3 percent of precincts reporting, Snelling had 2,415 votes
or 88 percent and Gottlieb had 345 votes or 12 percent. Welch had
2,051 votes or 93 percent and Gwin had 154 votes or 7 percent.
   People went to the polls in 10 states and the District of
Columbia, but politics had a low priority among Americans whose
attention was riveted on events in the Persian Gulf.
   Three Republican governors _ Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, Edward
DiPrete of Rhode Island, and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin _ had
token primary opposition.
   With polls indicating DiPrete is vulnerable, three Democrats _
Mayors Joseph Paolino of Providence and Francis Flaherty of Warwick
and businessman Bruce Sundlun _ were competing to run against him.
   In the race to succeed Democrat William O'Neill as governor of
Connecticut, Rep. Bruce Morrison and state legislator William Cibes
faced off in the Democratic primary.
   After serving four two-year terms as governor of Vermont,
Snelling, a Republican, decided not to run again in 1984. He was
succeeded by Democrat Madeleine Kunin who announced her retirement
this year.
   Snelling and Democrat Peter Welch had token opposition for their
party nominations.
   The list of politicians attempting comebacks also included
former Sen. John Durkin of New Hampshire and ex-congressmen Edward
Beard of Rhode Island, Dan Marriott of Utah and 85-year-old John
Dow of New York.
   Perpich, ridiculed as ``Governor Goofy'' by his critics, was
challenged by his former commerce commissioner, Mike Hatch, for the
Democrat-Farmer-Labor nomination.
   Minnesota Republicans had an equally spirited contest with
Auditor Arne Carlson and businessman Jon Grunseth the
front-runners. Carlson led pre-election polls despite the fact
Grunseth had the endorsement of the Independent-Republican party
leadership.
   Dyson came under criticism for his ties to defense contractors
and recently the hawkish congressman's prospects were further
shaken by disclosure that he was a conscientious objector during
the Vietnam war. His chief Democratic opponent was state legislator
Barbara Kreamer. Eight Republicans were lined up to challenge Dyson
in November and a recent poll said any one of them could beat him.
   Durkin, who served one six-year Senate term and then was
defeated for re-election in 1980, was seeking the Democratic
nonmination for the seat now held by Republican Sen. Gordon
Humphrey. Durkin's principal primary opponents were Nashua Mayor
James Donchess and businessman John Rauh.
   Rep. Bob Smith and lawyer Tom Christo were competing for the GOP
nomination to succeed Humphrey.
   After 12 years in the U.S. Senate, Humphrey announced he was
ready to leave Washington to run for a seat in the New Hampshire
Senate. But his path to the state legislature wasn't clear. State
Rep. Jack Sherburne waged a vigorous campaign for the nomination,
calling Humphrey ``a converted extremist'' who was ``largely
ineffective'' in the U.S. Senate.
   In the New Hampshire Democratic gubernatorial primary, former
state party chairman Joe Grandmaison was favored to overcome two
rivals who have attacked him for his ties to Massachusetts Gov.
Michael Dukakis.
   Beard lost his House seat in 1980 to Republican Claudine
Schneider who is running against Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell.
   Dow last served New York in the House in 1972. His primary
opponent, Sean O'Brien Strub, is homosexual. The primary winner
would challenge Republican Rep. Benjamin Gilman.
   Marriott, who served four terms in Congress before losing a 1984
bid for governor, was competing against Genevieve Atwood for the
chance to challenge Democratic Rep. Wayne Owens in November.
   Jackson was running in a Democratic primary for nomination to
the symbolic office of ``shadow senator'' from the District of
Columbia. Voters in the nation's capital will elect two
``senators'' and one ``representative,'' positions with no official
standing and created to lobby Congress to support statehood for the
city.
   Five candidates were competing for the Democratic nomination to
succeed Marion Barry as Washington's mayor. Barry, awaiting
sentencing on a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge, has said he
plans to run as an independent for an at-large seat on the city
council.
   The race to succeed Walter Fauntroy as the District of
Columbia's non-voting delegate in the House was abruptly
spotlighted last weekend when front-runner Eleanor Holmes Norton
conceded that she and her husband failed to file city income tax
returns over an eight-year period.
   Norton, a law professor and former Carter administration
official, said her husband did the family taxes and she signed the
returns but he never mailed them.

   The day's primaries settled the fall campaign lineups for all
but a handful of states. Voters in Massachusets, Hawaii, Florida,
Washington, Louisiana and OKlahoma will complete the process in the
coming weeks.
   Jackson's only previous bids for elective office were his two
campaigns for president. He moved to Washington a year ago and
considered entering the race for mayor, but then announced he would
concentrate on campaigning to have the city named the 51st state.
   In Connecticut, Rep. John Rowland captured the GOP nomination
for governor without primary opposition. The two major party
nominees face a formidable general election obstacle in ex-Sen.
Lowell Weicker who is running as an independent. Opinion polls show
Weicker leading either Democrat and Rowland, although he was
defeated when he ran for re-election to the Senate in 1988.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and his Republican challenger,
Pierre Rinfret, already had their respective party nominations and
were not on the primary ballot.
   The same was true of Pell and Schneider in Rhode Island.
   Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Thomas Loftus was unopposed for the
Democratic nomination to challenge Thompson.

   Talk show host Larry King apologized Tuesday
for saying Miss Pennsylvania Marla Wynne was the ugliest contestant
in last week's Miss America Pageant.
   A judge at the pageant in Atlantic City, N.J., he named Ms.
Wynne the homliest of the bunch during an appearance Monday on
``The Joan Rivers Show.''
   ``She was one of the 10 finalists and she did a great
ventriloquist bit . . . The dummy was prettier,'' he said.
   ``He was kidding,'' said Eileen Murphy, a spokeswoman for
``Larry King Live'' on CNN. ``He was on the show with Joan Rivers.
Joan's a comedian. He reacted to her in a comedic way. He regrets
the incident and he apologizes.
   ``In retrospect he realizes it was not funny,'' she said. ``He
certainly did not mean to be offensive.''
   King sent a dozen long-stemmed red roses and a telegram to Ms.
Wynne apologizing for his comments, which he said ``were made in
jest with no intention to offend.''
   ``You are a bright shining talent,'' King wrote. ``... Half the
women in America would kill to be in your shoes. In this case I'm
the real dummy.''
   After King's remarks, Ms. Wynne's father, Gary Wynne of Easton
told WAEB-AM radio Tuesday the family and the Miss Pennsylvania
Pageant were considering unspecified legal action.
   The contestant's mother, Marlene Wynne, said the apology was
necessary, but it needed to go further.
   ``I think he and Marla should talk about it,'' she said. ``He
has hurt her very deeply and he has hurt many other people.''
   She said the family had spoken to an attorney and was told King
had the right to express an opinion.
   Ms. Wynne was invited to appear on Rivers' show, said Dennis
Stewart, chairman of the Miss Pennsylvania Scholarship Pageant Inc.
He said they were discussing an appearance later in the week.
   ``If people get a chance to see her, that's as much as a
rebuttal to what Larry said,'' Stewart said.
   ``She is by far not ugly,'' Mrs. Wynne said. ``For him to attack
any girl who was on that stage, in his position as a judge, I think
is contemptible.''
   Ms. Murphy said King might agree to a meeting.
   ``His top priority now is to clear the air,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov denied
charges Tuesday that he took advantage of his post to buy a country
home for a fraction of its value.
   The allegations worsened Ryzhkov's problems on a day when he
suffered heavy criticism in the national parliament for his
economic reform plans.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda, one of the nation's largest newspapers,
said Tuesday that the prime minister had paid 47,000 rubles for a
country home, known as a dacha, outside Moscow.
   The official exchange rate for the ruble is about $1.60 or 16
cents, depending on the transaction.
   However, in his comments to the Supreme Soviet, Ryzhkov said,
``We do not own a dacha.'' He said he lives in a government-owned
dacha reserved for the prime minister.
   However, Ryzhkov said he had considered buying his own home
recently because he was tired of public complaints about special
privileges for officials.
   ``I did have such a thought, in order to live as a free man,''
he said. But he said he could not afford the 300,000-ruble price on
his government dacha.
   Because most Soviets live in cramped apartments with no hope of
ever owning their own home, official dachas are a particular sore
point.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said Ryzhkov was out buying a dacha while
vigorously fighting proposals to legalize private land. The
proposals would allow millions of Soviets to join him as residents
of single-family homes.
   The newspaper also said that as prime minister, Ryzhkov had
unique access to his pick of dachas near Moscow, where demand far
outstrips supply.

<TEXT>
   Gunfire broke out Tuesday at a high school
described by students as fraught with gang and drug activity, and
three teen-agers were wounded.
   Students said a feud between two gangs and their offshoot groups
led to the shootings. Witnesses reported hearing arguing before the
shots and said one boy had been teased for wearing the wrong color
of clothing.
   ``I was diving out of the way,'' said student Ursula Hall. ``I
almost got shot. I was scared, I was terrified.''
   Police arrested and charged three males in the shootings at Sam
Houston High School. The victims and suspects all are students at
the school, officials said.
   ``According to the wounded people, they are accusing the ones
who did the shooting of being members of a gang,'' said San Antonio
School District Superintendent Victor Rodriguez. He later confirmed
that gangs were involved.
   District spokesman Bobby Zamora said classes were dismissed, and
some students went home by bus.
   Rene Gaines, another school district spokeswoman, said classes
would resume Wednesday with extra guards stationed at Sam Houston.
Counseling will be available for students trying to cope with the
violence, she said.
   Otherwise, ``it's school as usual,'' Ms. Gaines said.
   Students and parents described the 1,400-student school as a
dangerous place where gangs and drugs are prevalent. Several
spectators booed and shouted at the superintendent when he told
reporters Sam Houston is as safe as possible.
   Police arrested an 18-year-old, Kenneth Wolford, and charged him
with two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, police
Sgt. Paul Buske said.
   Two others, both juveniles, also were charged with two counts of
aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, he said.
   A 16-year-old boy shot in the chest was in fair condition at
Wilford Hall Medical Center, said hospital spokesman George
Kelling. Another boy was shot in the foot and a third was shot in
the thigh and calf, officials said. Both were in fair condition at
Medical Center Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Inez Eisazadeh.

<TEXT>
   The heaviest single-day rainfall in 70
years drenched South Korea on Tuesday, killing at least 45 people
and forcing more than 350,000 to flee their homes.
   President Roh Tae-woo said relief efforts were like ``fighting a
war.''
   The Seoul area was swamped by 15 inches of rain in 24 hours. The
most rain fell at Suwon, just south of Seoul, which had 16.8
inches, the main disaster relief center said.
   A 100-yard section of the Han River's bank just west of Seoul
burst overnight, sending tons of water into a farming area of rice
paddies and villages. Officials said the 300,000 residents were
being evacuated.
   ``No amount of words can describe this situation,'' said Police
Lt. Kim Sung-ho from the scene. ``It's hellish.''
   Thousands of people were stranded on rooftops, and thousands
were ferried to higher ground.
   Official figures said 45 people were known dead, 31 missing and
66,000 homeless. However, the figures did not take into account the
new flooding from the Han or the evacuations there.
   The Central Disaster Relief Center said the rainfall was the
heaviest in the country in a single day in 70 years. Property
damage was initially estimated at $25 million.
   The airfield at the 7th U.S. Air Force headquarters south of
Seoul was flooded and F-16 jet fighters were sandbagged. About two
dozen Koreans in makeshift boats floated over a submerged fence and
onto the flooded runways and had to be rescued, a spokesman said.
   U.S. and South Korean military helicopters and large army trucks
evacuated children and shopkeepers stranded on tops of houses and
buildings.
   One hospital on the outskirts of Seoul evacuated its patients,
and witnesses reported seeing patients wading through waist-high
water with belongings held over their heads.
   ``This is the worst weather disaster in memory,'' Roh said after
briefings at the Han River Flood Control Center. ``Protecting
people from this rain is like fighting a war.''
   Korean soldiers used rubber dinghies to rescue people stranded
in low-lying areas around Olympic Park. The Olympic Expressway was
flooded and nearby riverside park areas were submerged.
   A Buddhist temple was buried in a mudslide with five monks
inside, news reports said.
   The national news agency Yonhap said the dead included a
9-year-old girl swept away by flood waters and a 3-year-old
sleeping in her home.
   In the port of Inchon west of Seoul, nine homes were buried in a
landslide and 20 people were missing, police said. More than 15,000
chickens drowned at a chicken farm.
   Some Seoul-area subway stations were closed after water poured
into them. A major commuter line serving areas west of Seoul
stopped completely, stranding thousands of commuters. Schools were
closed in the capital.
   At Suwon, dozens of factories manufacturing electronics,
instruments, television sets, footwear and tires were flooded. One
factory dormitory collapsed, killing six sleeping workers inside.
   Two cruise ships broke free from their moorings and capsized on
the Han River. Twenty crewmen were rescued but 10 were missing,
police said.
   Railroad lines to areas south and east of Seoul were flooded.
Many roads in rural areas and some sections of highways were washed
out, and sections of a mountain highway leading to the east coast
collapsed, officials said.
   Rain stopped overnight and the three-day storm was heading
southeastward away from the peninsula.

<HEAD>Beleaguered Florida Citrus Growers Gets Good News; Feds Drop
Quarantine</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Citrus growers eager to bounce back from a
subpar harvest got some good news Tuesday when federal agriculture
officials dropped a 6-year-old quarantine.
   Florida's billion-dollar citrus industry, hoping for a sunnier
future after a crippling Christmas freeze, also welcomed an
optimistic report on increased citrus planting.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department announced that as of Sept. 18 it
will officially remove the remaining citrus-canker quarantine
restrictions imposed in September 1984.
   ``We were pleased to see it,'' said Dan Gunter, executive
director of the Florida Department of Citrus. ``This will open up
all the markets to Florida. It was time for the USDA to
deregulate.''
   Federal quarantine restrictions came after an outbreak of a
leaf-spotting disease in dozens of citrus nurseries. It was
believed to be a rapidly spreading Asiatic strain of citrus canker,
which can devastate groves.
   More than 20 million young trees were uprooted and burned,
before scientists determined that the disease was not spreading to
mature groves and did not constitute a major threat to fruit or to
other citrus-producing states.
   Restrictions were gradually relaxed after follow-up research
showed that the disease was only distantly related to Asiatic
canker.
   Lack of faith in Florida citrus, brought on by the canker
quarantine, cost growers dearly, said Bobby McKown, executive vice
president of Florida Citrus Mutual, the largest growers' trade
association in the state.
   He called it ``a major step forward for the citrus industry.
It's been a long six years since the quarantine was first imposed.''
   Meanwhile, a biennial survey conducted by state and federal
officials showed a 5 percent increase in citrus acreage despite
nearly 86,000 acres lost because of the Christmas freeze.
   ``That's good news _ a very encouraging report,'' Gunter said.
   Commercial citrus acreage increased to 732,767 acres, 5 percent
more than the 697,929 acres reported in 1988, according to the
report.
   Growers planted 120,696 acres in 1988 and 1989. They lost 85,858
acres of trees _ most of it to the December freeze _ leaving a net
gain of 34,838.
   The 1989-90 orange harvest, projected before the December freeze
at 130 million 90-pound boxes, came in at about 110 million boxes.
It was the decade's second-lowest production.
   The grapefruit crop of about 36 million boxes was the smallest
since the 1967-68 season.
   The canker scare prompted other citrus states, including Texas
and California, to ban imports of Florida fruit that was not
inspected and treated before being shipped.
   Connie Riherd, assistant director of the Florida Agriculture
Department's Division of Plant Industry, said she hoped that other
citrus-producing states ``take the federal lead and not impose
their own regulations against Florida fruit.''
   ``The wealth of biological information that has been reviewed
(by federal and state scientists) shows that the nursery strain of
the disease is not of quarantine significance,'' Mrs. Riherd said.
   The canker-eradication effort led to some 60 lawsuits by nursery
owners who suffered losses because of the destruction of their
young trees. At last report, these lawsuits totaled about $200
million and the state was still trying to negotiate with litigants
and impose some court-ordered settlements.
   The cost of the canker-eradication battle to the industry and
state and federal agencies exceeded $100 million.
   ``This shows positive results following a major freeze,'' said
Harry Whittaker of the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service,
which compiled the survey results. ``We see continued interest by
growers in new plantings.''

   Aircraft could be better designed to survive
explosions but there will never be a bombproof jumbo jet, according
to a government report released Tuesday on the terrorist bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103.
   The Air Accidents Investigation Branch reported that the Pan Am
Boeing 747 broke apart within three seconds of the explosion of a
bomb in a forward baggage compartment, leading to the deaths of 270
people on Dec. 21, 1988.
   None of the 259 people aboard the aircraft appeared to have been
fatally injured by the initial explosion or by fire aboard the
aircraft, the report said. Eleven people were killed on the ground
in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   ``It should be possible to limit the damage caused by an
explosive device inside a baggage container on a Boeing 747 or
similar aircraft to a degree which would allow the aircraft to land
successfully, albeit with severe local damage and perhaps resulting
in some loss of life or injuries,'' said the report.
   The report said the plane, which had just reached a cruising
altitude of 31,000 feet, rapidly disintegrated following the
explosion.
   The investigators urged that aircraft manufacturers and
government regulatory agencies consider various design changes,
including skin panels that would blow away cleanly, venting an
explosion without leading to the tearing away of more skin.
   The report was limited to structural and technical issues, and
did not address questions of airport security.
   In Renton, Wash., a spokeswoman for the Boeing Commerical
Airplane Group said the aircraft company would review the report's
recommendations, even though the company has never specifically
studied how to structurally strengthen its planes to withstand a
bomb explosion.
   ``It's Boeing's feeling that the only way to prevent an
explosive from destroying a plane is to avoid allowing the
explosive to be placed on the plane in the first place,'' said
spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese. ``What you're asking the manufacturer
to do is respond to unknowns. How do you design a plane to become
terrorist-proof?''
   The police investigation into the bombing continues. A public
inquiry is to open in Dumfries, Scotland, on Oct. 1 to investigate
the circumstances that led to the deaths.
   Chief Constable George Esson of the Dumfries and Galloway
Constabulary confirmed in December that Ahmed Jibril's radical
Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command, had been under investigation.
   Esson also confirmed investigators' interest in Mohammed Abu
Talb, a member of another radical Palestinian group who was
convicted in Sweden of being involved in bombings against American
and Israeli targets in Europe.
   Some authorities believe the bombing was carried out by a
terrorist group working on behalf of Iran in retaliation for the
shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane over the Persian Gulf
by a U.S. warship.
   Scottish police reported in February 1989 that the New
York-bound 747 was brought down by a bomb consisting of Semtex
plastic explosives hidden inside a radiocassette recorder. They
said the recorder was probably checked aboard the flight in
Frankfurt, West Germany.
   The explosive device was inside a luggage container that was
loaded in the forward hold, and was about 25 inches from the
aircraft's skin, the report said.
   The explosion blew a large hole in the fuselage structure and
shattered the main cabin floor, the report said. Large cracks
spread as pressurized air blew out of the rupture.
   The main body of the aircraft rolled left and down, while the
nose snapped off to the right and struck the No. 3 engine, knocking
it free, the investigators said.
   The disintegrating main body of the aircraft, including the fuel
tanks, fell on the town of Lockerbie at speeds up to 300 mph,
causing fires and a huge explosion, the report said.
   The investigators, led by D.A. Cooper, chief inspector of air
accidents, recommended that aircraft be designed to channel the
force of any explosion to sections of the skin designed to burst
cleanly without causing further structural damage.
   The report also suggested strengthening the floor over the
baggage compartment and filling internal cavities with energy
absorbing materials.
   Even then, the investigators said, there was no guarantee that
an aircraft would survive an explosion.
   The report said such variable factors as the size of the
explosive charge and the location of the bomb make it ``unrealistic
to expect to neutralize successfully the effect of every potential
explosive device likely to be placed on board an aircraft.''
   The investigators also called for new designs for flight data
and voice recorders. The ones aboard Flight 103 failed instantly
and captured no data about the explosion, the report said.

   Here is the advance text of the Democratic
response Tuesday night to President Bush's address to Congress. The
response was given by Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the majority
leader of the House of Representatives.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Good evening.
   I have been asked to give the Democratic response to the
President's speech. But tonight, in this crisis, we are not
Republicans or Democrats. We are only and proudly Americans.
   The President has asked for our support. He has it. The effort
will not be easy; it involves burdens and bravery, perhaps more of
each than any of us can now predict. The end of what John Kennedy
called ``the long, twilight struggle'' has not put an end to the
darkness of aggression and conflict.
   Yet as Americans, we enter this new world with a remarkable
degree of purpose and confidence. Here at home the sense of unity
and the absence of widespread opposition to this action in the
Persian Gulf testify to our powerful, instinctive feeling that this
is a cause worth standing and fighting for.
   We are standing _ and if necessary we will fight _ because a
vital national interest is at stake. We cannot and will not permit
the invading forces of a fanatical regime to control half of all
the oil reserves which are the lifeblood of the world economy.
   Yet more is involved here than national interest, as important
as that is. There has been, and there always should be, a moral
component of American foreign policy. This has sometimes been
criticized as weakness; in truth it is our greatest strength. When
our policy has a moral center, we gain the unbreakable resolve that
comes from standing for things we believe in.
   So we are now in the Persian Gulf not simply for oil, or to save
emirs and kings _ but to defend the most fundamental values of a
more stable and decent world. We defending basic rights _ of
families to be safe in their homes, of nations to be secure within
their borders, of individuals to travel freely and without fear.
   The tyrant who rampaged into Kuwait has also murdered his own
citizens with poison gas, plotted to acquire nuclear weapons, waged
genocide against a minority people, and now taken hostage thousands
of men, women and children.

   To watch him on television touching the head of a hostage child
stuns and then outrages us.
   Firmly, clearly and unequivocally, we must say to Saddam
Hussein: Let our people go. Let Kuwait go. And if you start a war,
know that we will finish it.
   We have learned before that the large conflicts which engulf the
world begin from small and unanswered aggressions. If the civilized
world had looked the other way, the Iraqi war machine could have
rolled across the Arabian Peninsula. It would be only a matter of
time until Iraq had ballistic missiles with chemical, biological
and nuclear warheads that could reach Israel, Egypt and Europe
itself.
   But this time, other nations have acted in time.
   Among them is the Soviet Union, a nation we did not often praise
in the years of the Cold War. From the summit at Helsinki, where
President Gorbachev and President Bush stood in common purpose, we
could see beyond the present shadows of war in the Middle East to a
new world order where the strong work together to deter and stop
aggression.
   This was precisely Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill's
vision of peace for the post-war period. Their hope, suspended in
time for fifty years of Cold War, has come alive in this new,
post-Communist era.
   America is still the leader _ the only power capable of
summoning a grand and global alliance on the scale we have seen in
Operation Desert Shield. But it is not enough for other nations
just to share our commitment. They must also share the burden.
   When Bangladesh is putting troops in harm's war, so should our
powerful and prosperous allies.
   When Japan, Germany, and other NATO countries depend far more
heavily of Mideast oil than we do, they can and should contribute
to defend their own vital interests in the Persian Gulf.
   When countries like Egypt can stand beside us, when young
Americans stand on front lines, only miles from the threat of
poison gas, the least the Japanese and Germans can do is support us
_ and not just with words; they must respond to our potential
sacrifice of lives with at least a financial sacrifice of their own.

   We are there because it is right. But it is also right to tell
our friends that they, too, have to stand up to international
immorality and aggression. The United States will do its part _ and
we will also insist that other countries carry their share of the
struggle.
   We have not finished the job, but how powerful are the signs of
a new world coming. Today we can see Egyptian or Saudi troops
wearing Hungarian gas masks or carrying Russian rifles, standing
guard in the desert next to a Pfc from Pittsburgh who is wearing a
chemical-proof suit made in Israel. The infamy of Saddam Hussein
has made us United Nations in deed as well as name.
   But ultimately, for America to lead the world, we must put our
own economic house in order. For as another American president
reminded us, ``We cannot be strong abroad if we are weak at home.''
   For a decade America has been left with no real energy policy at
all. It is time for energy security _ more production, more
conservation, more support for new forms of fuel. But our aim
cannot be to make America safe for isolationism. Rather we must
secure America's capacity to act overseas without maximum damage
from an oil embargo. This nation must not be permanently faced with
a choice between standing up against aggression or standing still
in gas lines.
   Economic strength also demands action on the budget deficit.
   To help the President write a budget, we Democrats have offered
cuts in domestic programs while trying to protect the most
important ones. But we will never abandon the cause of working
families. They benefited the least from the decade of the 80s; they
should not have to sacrifice the most in the decade of the 90s.
They already pay for government; their student loans have already
been cut, and their sons and daughters are at risk in the Persian
Gulf.
   The standard of fairness should also be applied to President
Bush's commitment to raise taxes. The working people who got almost
nothing from the tax cuts of the past must not be asked to pay most
of the tax increases of today. Just as we must ask wealthy nations
to pay their fair share to deter aggression, so we must ask wealthy
Americans to pay their fair share to prevent recession and reduce
our debts.
   Beyond this, we must be vigorous in shaping the defense policy
that we now need _ one that is more relevant and more responsive.

   We can and will afford weapons critical to efforts like
Operation Desert Shield: tanks, precision missiles and fast sealift.
   But Star Wars, the B-2 Bomber and the MX Missile are costly
systems designed for a Cold War that we have already won. We can
and must reduce the part of the Pentagon budget that is nothing
more than shadowboxing with the past.
   But for all of us tonight, our deepest concern is for the most
fundamental realities _ the hundreds of American families with a
loved one held hostage _ the hundred thousand young Americans in
uniform: daughters, sons, husbands, wives and friends, who have
been so swiftly sent to Saudi Arabia. A few days ago on a trip to
that country, I saw them transforming the trackless desert sand
into the frontier of international defense.
   I spoke with a solider who described telephone lines melting in
the Saudi sun. Pilots told me of cockpit temperatures reaching 140
degrees.
   There was another young man who was supposed to be married next
Sunday. But his wedding must wait. Before toasting his bride, he
will be drinking six to seven gallons of water each day just to
survive the unyielding heat.
   None of the young men and women I met doubted their mission.
They react to such problems as sand blowing into a machine or a
gearshift with that remarkable American sense of ingenuity; they
respond to frustration with that irreverent American sense of
humor. They worry most about their families worrying about them.
   Randy King of Arkansas handed me a scribbled note for his
mother: ``Doing fine. Having no problems. Please write. Love ya,
Randy.''
   And Ronald Lloyd of Idaho spoke for most of the troops when he
asked me to tell his family to ``send stamps and cookies _ and
plenty of both.''
   Their courage commands our support. We will stand behind them as
one, indivisible nation.
   We will challenge other countries to match their resolve and
sacrifice.
   We will insist that to ignore aggression is to invite aggression.
   We will try to solve this crisis peacefully, but without
appeasement.
   And if our soldiers have to fight, we will make sure they win.
   Tonight that is our common purpose and our prayer _ for them _
and for our country.

   So if ever there was a time to put country before self and
patriotism before party, that time is now. Let me thank all
Americans, especially those in this chamber, for your support for
our forces and their mission.
   That support will be even more important in the days to come.
   So tonight, I want to talk to you about what is at stake _ what
we must do together to defend civilized values around the world,
and maintain our economic strength at home.
   Our objectives in the Persian gulf are clear, our goals defined
and familiar:
   _Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait completely, immediately _ and
without condition.
   _Kuwait's legitimate government must be restored.
   _The security and stability of the Persian Gulf must be assured.
   _Americans citizens abroad must be protected.
   These goals are not ours alone. They have been endorsed by the
U.N. Security Council five times in as many weeks. Most countries
share our concern for principle. And many have a stake in the
stability of the Persian Gulf. This is not, as Saddam Hussein would
have it, the United States against Iraq. It is Iraq against the
world.
   As you know, I've just returned from a very productive meeting
with Soviet President Gorbachev. I am pleased that we are working
together to build a new relationship. In Helsinki, our joint
statement affirmed to the world our shared resolve to counter
Iraq's threat to peace. Let me quote: ``We are united in the belief
that Iraq's aggression must not be tolerated. No peaceful
international order is possible if larger states can devour their
smaller neighbors.''
   Clearly, no longer can a dictator count on East-West
confrontation to stymie concerted U.N. action against aggression.
   A new partnership of nations has begun.
   We stand today at a unique and extraordinary moment. The crisis
in the Persian Gulf, as grave as it is, also offers a rare
opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation. Out
of these troubled times, our fifth objective _ a new world order _
can emerge: a new era _ freer from the threat of terror, stronger
in the pursuit of justice, and more secure in the quest for peace.
An era in which the nations of the world, East and West, North and
South, can prosper and live in harmony.
   A hundred generations have searched for this elusive path to
peace, while a thousand wars raged across the span of human
endeavor. Today that new world is struggling to be born. A world
quite different from the one we've known. A world where the rule of
law supplants the rule of the jungle. A world where the rule of law
supplants the rule of the jungle. A world in which nations
recognize the shared responsibility for freedom and justice. A
world where the strong respect the rights of the weak.
   This is the vision I shared with President Gorbachev in
Helsinki. He, and other leaders from Europe, the Gulf and around
the world, understand that how we manager this crisis today, could
shape the future for generations to come.

   Liberal U.S. Rep. Bruce A. Morrison
defeated liberal state Rep. William J. Cibes Jr. in the Democratic
primary for governor Tuesday in this economically slumping state.
   He will face former Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., a Republican
running for governor as an independent, and GOP nominee John G.
Rowland, a three-term congressman, in the general election.
   With 55 percent of the precincts reporting, Morrison had 61
percent, or 41,879 votes, to Cibes' 39 percent, or 26,536 votes.
   For the first time in a generation, Democrats are heading into
the fall elections as clear underdogs, largely because of the
state's flagging economy and record-setting tax increases over the
past two years.
   Democratic Gov. William A. O'Neill decided in March not to seek
a third term.
   Morrison tried to paint Cibes as an O'Neill crony responsible
for the tax increases and has criticized Cibes' call for a state
personal income tax. Cibes raised questions about the way Morrison
raised money and for the congressman's refusal to present a
detailed plan for bailing the state out of the economic slump.

   Second: the Congress should, this month, enact a prudent
multi-year defense program _ one that reflects not only the
improvement in East-West relations, but our broader
responsibilities to deal with the continuing risks of outlaw action
and regional conflict. Even with our obligations in the Gulf, a
sound defense budget can have some reduction in real terms, and we
are prepared to accept that. But to go beyond such levels, where
cutting defense would threaten our vital margin of safety, is
something I will never accept.
   The world is still dangerous. Surely that is now clear.
Stability is not secure. American interests are far-reaching.
Interdependence has increased. The consequences of regional
instability can be global. This is no time to risk America's
capacity to protect her vital interests.
   Third: the Congress should, this month, enact measures to
increase domestic energy production and energy conservation _ in
order to reduce dependence on foreign oil. These measures should
include my proposals to increase incentives for domestic oil and
gas exploration, fuel-switching, and to accelerate the development
of Alaskan energy resources, without damage to wildlife.
   As you know, when the oil embargo was imposed in the early
1970's, the United States imported almost 6 million barrels of oil
per day. This year, before the Iraqi invasion, U.S. imports had
risen to nearly 8 million barrels per day. We had moved in the
wrong direction. Now we must act to correct that trend.
   Fourth: the Congress should, this month, enact a five-year
program to reduce the projected debt and deficits by $500 billion _
that is, by half a trillion dollars. If, with the Congress, we can
develop a satisfactory program by the end of the month, we can
avoid the ax of ``sequester'' _ deep across-the-board cuts that
would threaten our military capacity and risk substantial domestic
disruption.
   I want to be able to tell the American people, we have truly
solved the deficit problem. For me to do that, a budget agreement
must meet these tests:
   _It must include the measures I've recommended to increase
economic growth and reduce dependence on foreign oil.
   _It must be fair. All should contribute, but the burden should
not be excessive for any one group of programs or people.
   _It must address the growth of government's hidden liabilities.
   _It must reform the budget process, and further: it must be real.
   I urge Congress to provide a comprehensive five-year deficit
reduction program to me as a complete legislative package _ with
measures to assure that it can be fully enforced. America is tired
of phony deficit reduction, or promise-now, save-later-plans.
Enough is enough. It is time for a program that is credible and
real.
   _Finally, to the extent that the deficit reduction program
includes new revenue measures, it must avoid any measure that would
threaten economic growth or turn us back toward the days of
punishing income tax rates. That is one path we should not head
down again.

   I have been pleased with recent progress, although it has not
always seemed so smooth.
   But now it is time to produce.
   I hope we can work out a responsible plan. But with or without
agreement from the budget summit, I ask both Houses of the Congress
to allow a straight up-or-down vote on a complete $500 billion
deficit reduction package _ not later than September 28.
   If the Congress cannot get me a budget, then Americans will have
to face a tough, mandated sequester.
   I am hopeful, in fact I am confident, the Congress will do what
it should. And we in the Executive Branch will do our part.
   In the final analysis, our ability to meet our responsibilities
abroad depends upon political will and consensus at home. This is
never easy in democracies _ where we govern only with the consent
of the governed. And although free people in a free society are
bound to have their differences, Americans traditionally come
together in times of adversity and challenge.
   Once again, Americans have stepped forward to share a tearful
goodbye with their families before leaving for a strange and
distant shore. At this very moment, they serve together with Arabs,
Europeans, Asians and Africans in defense of principle and the
dream of a new world order. That is why they sweat and toil in the
sand and the heat and the sun.
   If they can come together under such adversity; if old
adversaries like the Soviet Union and the United States can work in
common cause; then surely we who are so fortunate to be in this
great chamber _ Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, Conservatives _
can come together to fulfill our responsibilities here.
   Thank you, good night, and God Bless America.

budget to Congress; Democrats' response</NOTE>

   Budget negotiators from the White House and
Congress are moving toward an agreement to pare next year's federal
deficit by $50 billion, including higher premiums for better-off
Medicare recipients, participants said Tuesday.
   One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the two
sides had agreed to increase taxes and fees by $25 billion next
year and $130 billion over five years.
   Democrats and Republicans have dramatically narrowed their
differences over military cuts, the official said. They are
discussing reducing the $303 billion defense budget by $10 billion
to $11 billion next year and by $170 billion to $200 billion over
five years.
   There was still disagreement over how deeply domestic programs
should be cut and whose taxes should be raised. But participants
were optimistic after a fifth day of bargaining at Andrews Air
Force Base in Maryland, 10 miles outside Washington.
   Some of those involved said a deal could be struck Wednesday or
Thursday that would cut the deficit $50 billion next year and $500
billion over five years.
   In his speech to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night,
President Bush said he was ``pleased with recent progress'' at the
talks. He called on the bargainers to send him a deficit-cutting
plan by month's end, saying the crisis in the Persian Gulf has made
it even more urgent to help the nation's economy.
   ``Americans must never again enter any crisis _ economic or
military _ with an excessive dependence on foreign oil and an
excessive burden of federal debt,'' the president said.
   The president restated several of the demands he has been making
for months for a budget agreement. Among them are tax breaks for
oil exploration, research and development and home purchases.
   He also said he wanted a cut in the capital gains tax rate. He
warned that raising income tax rates is ``one path we should not
head down again.''
   If Congress does not send him a deficit-cutting plan by the end
of September, he warned, Americans would have to face a massive
spending cut triggered by the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law.
   In the formal Democratic response to Bush, House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said Democrats at the budget summit were
working on behalf of the country's working families.
   ``Just as we must ask wealthy nations to pay their fair share to
deter aggression, so we must ask wealthy Americans to pay their
fair share to prevent recession and reduce our debts,'' he said.
   He also said that savings could be found in the Pentagon's
budget by eliminating weapons designed for war against the Soviet
Union, such as Star Wars anti-missile defenses, the B2 bomber and
the MX missile, weapons he called ``shadowboxing with the past.''
   ``I'm optimistic,'' said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., one of the
bargainers. ``We're going to try hard to finish as soon as we can.''
   ``I'm on the positive side of the mood swing,'' White House
Chief of Staff John Sununu told reporters at the White House.
   Until Tuesday afternoon, the mood had been decidedly downbeat.
   One of the major problems unresolved by the bargainers was how
much money should be cut from domestic programs. The range under
discussion was $90 billion to $130 billion, with Democrats at the
lower end and Republicans favoring steeper cuts.
   Those programs include benefit programs such as Medicare and
general government efforts such as road and bridge building,
anti-crime measures and environmental efforts.
   Also still in dispute is which taxes will be increased.
Democrats have proposed increasing income tax rates for the wealthy
and raising energy taxes, while Republicans are still pressing for
a cut in the capital gains rate.
   Officials said that both sides are willing to accept an increase
in the payments the better-off elderly make for the Medicare
program's coverage of their doctors' bills.
   It would be the first time that monthly Medicare premiums were
set according to the income level of the recipient. Currently,
everyone pays $28.60 per month.
   A number of plans have been proposed, the officials said. Under
one, individuals at the top of the scale earning $40,000 annually
and couples making $51,200 per year would pay monthly premiums of
close to $115.
   The plan could run into considerable opposition, however.
Officials noted that it was likely to stir up the same opposition
that led to the defeat last year of a proposal increasing Medicare
coverage for serious diseases and boosting the premium to pay for
it.
   If adopted, the boost in Medicare premiums could raise as much
as $6 billion next year and up to $30 billion over five years, one
official said.
   Democrats are still proposing a 4 percent sales tax on energy
and a separate, 7-cent-per-gallon increase in the federal gasoline
tax. The combined effect of the two would be to raise the federal
gasoline levy by 11 cents per gallon. The current rate is 9 cents
per gallon.
   Democrats have dropped their insistence that the top income tax
rate on the wealthiest taxpayers be increased from 28 percent to 35
percent, one official said. But the Democrats are continuing to
press for a 10 percent surcharge on the income taxes of Americans
earning more than $500,000 annually.
   The two sides have agreed to extend some minor taxes that would
otherwise expire, such as the 3 percent tax on telephone calls.
They are also ready to agree to increase taxes on alcoholic
beverages and on luxury items such as expensive automobiles.
   Although the negotiators are close to agreeing on a defense
budget figure, no decision has been made on whether to count the
costs of U.S. military operations in the Middle East.
   With many of the bargainers sensing that an agreement could be
near, they have planned to resume their talks Wednesday at Andrews.
According to one official, they plan to return to the Capitol in
the evening for some votes. The official said that House Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., who is chairman of the talks, has
said that the bargainers should then return to Andrews and plan to
work for as long as it takes to reach a deal.
   The new fiscal year begins Oct. 1. Unless a deficit-cutting
package is in place by then, the Gramm-Rudman law will impose $100
billion in cuts on the $1.2 trillion federal budget. Reductions of
that degree would stagger most federal programs within weeks,
officials agree.
   Before the talks at Andrews began, congressional leaders had
said they had to strike a deal by this past Monday to be able to
move the legislation through Congress in time for the new fiscal
year. Without action, next year's shortfall could exceed $250
billion, the highest amount ever.

<TEXT>
   Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the United States
Congress, distinguished guests, fellow Americans, thank you very
much for that warm welcome.
   We gather tonight, witness to events in the Persian Gulf as
significant as they are tragic. In the early morning hours of
August 2nd, following negotiations and promises by Iraq's dictator
Saddam Hussein not to use force, a powerful Iraqi army invaded its
trusting and much weaker neighbor, Kuwait. Within three days,
120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait, and
moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia. It was then that I decided to
check that aggression.
   At this moment, our brave servicemen and women stand watch in
that distant desert and on distant seas, side by side with the
forces of more than 20 other nations.
   They are some of the finest men and women of the United States
of America. And they're doing one terrific job.
   These valiant Americans were ready at a moment's notice to leave
their spouses, their children, to serve on the front-line half-way
around the world. They remind us who keeps America strong. They do.
   In the trying circumstances of the gulf, the morale of our
servicemen and women is excellent. In the face of danger, they are
brave, well-trained and dedicated.
   A soldier, Pfc. Wade Merritt of Knoxville, Tennessee, now
stationed in Saudi Arabia, wrote his parents of his worries, his
love of family, and his hopes for peace. But Wade also wrote: ``I
am proud of my country and its firm stance against inhumane
aggression. I am proud of my Army and its men ... I am proud to
serve my country.''
   Let me just say, Wade, America is proud of you. And is grateful
to every soldier, sailor, marine and airman serving the cause of
peadce in the Persian Gulf.
   I also want to thank the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
General Powell, the chiefs here tonight, our commander in the
Persian Gulf, General Schwartzkopf, and the men and women of the
Department of Defense _ what a magnificent job you are doing and
thank you very, very much..
   I wish I could say their work is done. But we all know it is not.

   Gen. Augusto Pinochet, marking the 17th
anniversary of the coup he led in 1973, said Tuesday he would stage
another takeover again if confronted with similar circumstances.
   ``Should the circumstances of 1973 repeat, I would act in the
same manner,'' the 74-year-old army commander and former president
said.
   ``My only goal then was to rescue Chile'' from ``a Marxist
government that was working to disintegrate the country,'' he told
a group of right-wing politicians.
   Meanwhile, police said three people were injured, one of whom
was shot in the arm, and 48 arrested in scattered clashes
throughout the city linked to the anniversary.
   Most of the incidents occurred when rival groups celebrating or
denouncing the anniversary clashed in the streets. Police used
water cannon to disperse people, and the government said calm had
been restored by midafternoon.
   Police said they were investigating the wounding of a
21-year-old man who was shot as he left Santiago's main cemetery
after visiting the tomb of Salvador Allende, the man Pinochet
toppled in the coup.
   Pinochet spoke briefly to the leaders of the Independent
Democratic Union, a rightist group, who visited him at his home to
``thank him'' for the 1973 coup that ousted Allende, a Marxist who
was elected president by the Chilean populace.
   Pinochet led the armed forces in the coup, which took place
during a time of deep social, political and economic crisis.
   Pinochet stayed in power for 16{ years until March 11, when he
was succeeded by President Patricio Aylwin, an elected civilian.
   After relinquishing the presidency to Aylwin, Pinochet remained
commander in chief of the army, sheltered by a special clause in
the 1980 constitution written by his government that prevents
Aylwin from firing him.
   The coup anniversary was marked by the military with a series of
private ceremonies at barracks throughout the country.
   The civilian government ignored the celebrations, but ministers
and officials attended a Catholic Mass at the presidential palace
for the hundreds of people who died in the coup and in the severe
repression that followed it.
   Among those who died was Allende, who was killed the day of the
coup as his presidential palace in downtown Santiago came under
heavy ground and air attack.
   Leftist politicians and relatives of the victims visited
cemeteries to pay tribute to the dead.
   Hundreds paraded in front of the new marble mausoleum where
Allende's remains were reburied one week ago at Santiago's main
cemetery. They were led by Allende's widow, Hortensia Bussi, his
daughters and other relatives and aides of his government.
   In Santiago, police used water cannons to scatter small groups
of demonstrators both celebrating and denouncing the coup
anniversary. Twelve people were briefly detained, according to
deputy Interior Minister Belisario Velasco.
   Also in Santiago, two bombs went off during the night, police
said, causing no victims but damaging a bank and the office of a
right wing party. No victims were reported.
   Several hundred people gathered early in the morning in front of
Pinochet's house in a fashionable Santiago neighborhood, to cheer
the former president as he left for a ceremony and Mass at the
Military Academy.
   Many of the demonstrators later marched through the Providencia
district streets chanting slogans against the Aylwin government.
They also chanted ``Pinochet will come back, Pinochet will come
back.''

   A Boeing 727 jet carrying 18
people apparently crashed southeast of Newfoundland on Tuesday
after straying off course over the Atlantic Ocean, officials said.
   The Faucett airliner was en route from the Mediterranean island
of Malta to Miami with a refueling stop scheduled for Gander,
Newfoundland, said an airline operations manager in Miami.
   Faucett officials said the 18 on board were all from Peru, where
the airline is based, but that one of the crewmen lived in Miami.
   Transport Canada spokesman Lily Abbass said the jet was off
course and was believed to have gone down Tuesday afternoon about
250 miles southeast of St. John's. She said the crew declared a
low-fuel emergency 30 minutes after it was due in Gander. She said
the message was relayed by two U.S. aircraft.
   A spokesman for the Search and Rescue Coordination Center in
Halifax said Tuesday night that a weak signal from the jet's
emergency transmitter was picked up by satellite after radio
contact was lost.
   However, rescue officials said each time the satellite made a
pass over the area, the signal seemed to come from a different
location _ sometimes hundreds of miles apart.
   Rescue officials assumed the jet ditched in the sea and
dispatched three Aurora airplanes and three Labrador helicopters to
the area where the plane was last heard from. Weather conditions
were described as good and the seas calm.
   Some of the planes arrived in the area Tuesday evening but
spotted nothing. Two coast guard vessels, two fisheries patrol
vessels and two destroyers were also dispatched to the search area.
   The Boeing 727 _ no longer in production _ was designed to
withstand a landing at sea and can float for several hours, Boeing
spokesman Tom Cole said from Renton, Wash.
   The jetliner stopped in Keflavik, Iceland, en route. But a
refueling supervisor at Keflavik said there was no problem during
the stopover.
   Jens Gudmundsson, supervisor of the air traffic control center
in Reykjavik, Iceland, speculated the pilot ``got lost.''
   ``Nobody knows why the aircraft lost track,'' said Betty
McDaniel, a Faucett spokeswoman in Miami.
   The jet had been under contract to Air Malta since May and was
being returned to Miami for service in the summer months, according
to Jose Lazaga, the airline's vice president for marketing in Miami.
   He said the 18 aboard included crew and relatives of the
airline's employees.
   Those in the plane included an infant and up to four women, said
Ms. McDaniel.
   Faucett is a Lima-based carrier that operates both commercial
and cargo flights.

   The State Department issued an urgent appeal
Tuesday night through the Voice of America to American women and
children and Arab-born male American citizens in Kuwait, asking
them to get in touch with the embassy there immediately.
   Women and children ``seeking to depart the country must contact
the U.S. Embassy without delay if they wish to be assured
departure,'' the appeal said.
   ``Iraqi authorities are continuing to permit American women and
dependent children to leave the country. Additional evacuation
flights are being arranged, but we cannot guarantee how long these
flights can continue.''
   Adult male American citizens born in Kuwait, Iraq or any other
Arab country should also get in touch with the embassy immediately
``as it is our understanding that they may be eligible for
departure,'' said the statement.
   But adult male U.S. citizens born in the United States ``remain
subject to detention and arrest and Iraq will not, repeat not''
permit them to leave, the department said.
   In addition to the Voice of America, the BBC, British
Broadcasting Corp., also was carrying the appeal to Americans, the
department said.
   Earlier in the day, the department announced that Arab-born
males would be allowed to leave.
   Until now, the Iraqis generally had not allowed American males
to leave, restricting departures to U.S. women and children.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said he had no
estimate on the number of American males who will be eligible to
leave under the new rules. There are an estimated 1,700 Americans
in Kuwait and 100 in Iraq.
   Asked why the Iraqis were drawing distinctions between Americans
born in the United States and Arab-born American males, Boucher
noted that men from Arab countries have been allowed to depart Iraq
and Kuwait since the invasion began.
   ``This (new rule) is maybe in their interpretation somehow
consistent with that,'' he said.
   Additional evacuation flights carrying Americans from the two
countries are planned for Wednesday and Friday. About 160 American
women and children arrived in Baltimore on Monday, raising the
total since the evacuations began to an estimated 600.
   Boucher said Voice of America broadcasts to Iraq and Kuwait are
alerting Americans there to the new procedures.
   ``U.S. citizens, male, born in the United States, remain subject
to detention and arrest, and Iraq will not permit them to depart
the country,'' Boucher said, quoting from the VOA broadcast.
   He added that just under 90 American males remain in Iraqi
custody. One was released to the custody of the U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad on Monday, he said.

<HEAD>Women More Likely Than Men To Suffer Sexual Harassment in Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Women in the armed forces appear almost four
times as likely as men to be subjected to sexual harassment, the
Pentagon reported Tuesday.
   According to a survey of 38,000 military men and women, the most
common form of harassment was teasing or suggestive remarks, but 15
percent of the women and 2 percent of the men said they had been
pressured for sexual favors.
   ``Five percent of the females and 1 percent of the male
respondents reported actual or attempted rape or sexual assault,''
said the Pentagon's summary of findings.
   The survey was ordered in 1988 by then-secretary Frank Carlucci
in response to a recommendation from a task force set up to advise
the Defense Department on women in the military.
   Survey respondents in the four armed services and the Coast
Guard were queried between December 1988 and April 1989. About 60
percent of those contacted returned replies.
   There was ``virtually no difference'' between female and male
response rates, but actual numbers were not given. The proportion
of women varies from service to service, but they are about 11
percent of today's 2 million people in the armed services.
   Overall, the Pentagon said, 22 percent of active duty personnel
indicated they had experienced ``some form of sexual harassment
ranging from sexual jokes to actual assault'' while at work the
previous year.
   Christopher Jehn, assistant secretary for force management and
personnel, said the department was concerned about the incidents
reported and was carefully reviewing the findings.
   Jehn said in a statement he was heartened by evidence in the
study that most of those who had been harassed ``also believed that
we are moving in good faith to do something about it.''
   The survey, first to consider active duty personnel only, will
provide a ``statistical benchmark for use in evaluating the
effectiveness of ... policies designed to prevent sexual harassment.
   The survey found that 64 percent of the women, but only 17
percent of the men, had experienced some form of sexual harassment
on the job in the previous year.
   Other findings:
   _Eighty-two percent of those women victims, and 74 percent of
their men counterparts, said the harassment took the form of sexual
teasing, jokes, remarks or questions.
   _Sixty-nine percent of the female victims and 54 percent of the
male victims said it took the form of suggestive looks, gestures or
body language.
   _Sixty percent of the women victims and 51 percent of the men
victims reported touching, leaving over, cornering, pinching or
being brushed against in a deliberately sexual manner.
   The study said perpetrators of the experiences described by
females were men acting alone 75 percent of the time while 22
percent of the incidents were brought on by more than one man.
Incidents started by women were not mentioned.
   Among men victims, 50 percent of the perpetrators were women
acting alone and only 10 percent involved a group of women. But the
other 40 percent of the incidents directed against men were caused
by men alone or in a group with other men and women.
   The study said nearly three-quarters of the respondents said
policies had been established at their posts to reduce sexual
harassment. About a quarter of the personnel either did not know of
any such policies and believed that none had been put in place.

   The Progressive Conservatives jumped
to an early lead Tuesday night in elections for the Manitoba
legislature.
   Preliminary returns showed the Progressive Conservatives winning
30 places in the 57-seat legislature, followed by the New
Democratic Party with 19 seats and the Liberals with eight.
   If the results hold up, Manitoba Premier Gary Filmon would win
the legislative majority that eluded him in 1988.
   Filmon has been heading a minority government since the 1988
election in which his Progressive Conservatives won 24 seats. The
Liberals hold 21 seats and the New Democrats 12 in the current
legislature.
   In Tuesday's election, the Progressive Conservatives built on
their base in the farm belt by making inroads in the city of
Winnipeg, formerly a Liberal stronghold.
   The Progressive Conservatives campaign chairman Nate Nurgitz
said the deciding factor for the party seemed to be Filmon.
   ``The big factor for us was the popularity of Gary Filmon _ the
strength of his leadership,'' he said, while awaiting returns at
the party's campaign headquarters.
   Filmon's popularity increased after he successfully fought the
Meech Lake constitutional accord which would have granted special
status to French-speaking Quebec.

   President Bush prodded Congress on Tuesday to
move swiftly on measures to increase energy production, including
opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska to oil
exploration.
   Bush, in comments prompted by the Persian Gulf crisis, called on
Congress to enact his proposals by the end of the month.
   In his televised address to a joint session of Congress, the
president noted that the country's foreign oil imports have
increased since the oil embargo of 1973.
   Imports were 6 million barrels a day before that, and, he said,
``This year, before the Iraqi invasion (of Kuwait), U.S. imports
had risen to nearly 8 million barrels per day. We had moved in the
wrong direction. Nowe we must act to correct that trend.''
   Bush put Congress on notice that he will be reviving the Alaska
drilling proposal, a proposal that has been dormant since last
year's Alaska tanker spill off Valdez.
   The issue is sensitive for environmentalists, who say the oil
companies should be forced to keep their hands off the pristine
refuge on the north coast of Alaska.
   Bush said Congress should enact his proposals for: increasing
incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration; encouraging
conversion from oil to natural gas and accelerating the development
of Alaskan energy resources, ``without damage to wildlife.''
   Bush has long supported oil exploration in the wildlife reserve,
but Congress must approve.
   His proposals on so-called fuel switching are embodied in Clean
Air Act revisions, currently being worked over in a conference of
the House and Senate.
   On incentives for domestic oil and gas exploration, Bush's 1991
budget contains several proposals, including temporary tax credits
for exploratory drilling expenditures and for new oil recovery
projects; and more favorable deductions for drilling costs of
independent producers.
   Bush did not mention that he has blocked new exploration in
promising areas off the California coast, and administration
officials have said he has no intention of changing his mind on
that issue.

   Cracks appeared Tuesday in the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq
as Saddam Hussein sought to circumvent the economic noose around
his country.
   Japan, meanwhile, announced it would increase its aid to
countries hardest hit by enforcing the sanctions. Hoping to defuse
criticism that it is not doing its share to oppose Baghdad, Japan
said up to $2 billion in aid may be sent to nations most affected
by the U.N. embargo on Iraq.
   President Bush on Tuesday night promised a joint session of
Congress and a nationwide radio and television audience that
``Saddam Hussein will fail'' to make his conquest of Kuwait
permanent.
   ``America must stand up to aggression, and we will,'' said Bush,
who added that the U.S. military may remain in the Saudi Arabian
desert indefinitely.
   ``I cannot predict just how long it will take to convince Iraq
to withdraw from Kuwait,'' Bush said.
   More than 150,000 U.S. troops have been sent to the Persian Gulf
region to deter a possible Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia.
   Bush's aides said the president would follow his address to
Congress with a televised message for the Iraqi people, declaring
the world is united against their government's invasion of Kuwait.
Saddam had offered Bush time on Iraqi TV.
   The Philippines and Namibia, the first of the developing nations
to respond to an offer Monday by Saddam of free oil _ in exchange
for sending their own tankers to get it _ said no to the Iraqi
leader.
   Saddam's offer was seen as a none-too-subtle attempt to bypass
the U.N. embargo, in effect since four days after Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, by getting poor countries to dock their tankers
in Iraq.
   But according to a State Department survey, Cuba and Romania
have struck oil deals with Iraq and companies elsewhere are trying
to continue trade with Baghdad, all in defiance of U.N. sanctions.
Romania denies the allegation.
   The report, made available to The Associated Press, said some
Eastern European countries also are trying to maintain their
military sales to Iraq.
   A well-informed source in Tehran told The Associated Press that
Iran has agreed to an Iraqi request to exchange food and medicine
for up to 200,000 barrels of refined oil a day and cash payments.
There was no official comment from Tehran or Baghdad on the
reported food-for-oil deal.
   But the source, who requested anonymity, said the deal was
struck during Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz's visit Sunday to
Tehran, the first by a senior Iraqi official since the 1980-88 gulf
war. After the visit, the two countries announced they would resume
diplomatic relations.
   Well-informed oil industry sources in the region, contacted by
The AP, said that although Iran is a major oil exporter itself, it
currently has to import about 150,000 barrels of refined oil a day
for domestic use because of damages to refineries in the gulf war.
   Along similar lines, ABC News reported that following Aziz's
visit, Iraq is apparently prepared to give Iran all the oil it
wants to make up for the damage Iraq inflicted on Iran during their
conflict.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, meanwhile, met in Moscow
with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, two days after
the U.S.-Soviet summit that produced a joint demand that Iraq
withdraw from Kuwait.
   During the summit, Bush encouraged Mikhail Gorbachev to withdraw
190 Soviet military specialists from Iraq, where they remain to
fulfill contracts. Shevardnadze told the Soviet parliament Tuesday
the specialists had not reneged on those contracts for fear it
would jeopardize the 5,800 Soviet citizens in Iraq.
   In his speech, Bush said his heart went out to the families of
the hundreds of Americans held hostage by Iraq, but he declared,
``Our policy cannot change, and it will not change. America and the
world will not be blackmailed.''
   The president added: ``Vital issues of principle are at stake.
Saddam Hussein is literally trying to wipe a country off the face
of the Earth.''
   In other developments:
   _A U.S. diplomat in Baghdad said Tuesday up to 800 Americans and
Britons will fly out of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait this week, most of
them women and children leaving their husbands behind. Saddam has
said he is keeping foreign men as human shields against attack.
   On Monday, a planeload of 164 Westerners arrived in Baltimore
from Iraq. Evacuees spoke of food shortages in Kuwait, nighttime
gunfire and Iraqi roundups of young people suspected of involvement
in the resistance.
   ``There is no law and order,'' said Thuraya, 19, who would not
give her last name. ``A soldier can rape a father's daughter in
front of him and he can't do anything about it.''
   _The State Department said Iraq had told U.S. officials that
American males residing in Iraq and Kuwait who were born in Arab
countries will be allowed to leave. Iraq generally has not let
American males leave. It was not known how many men the Iraqi move
could affect.
   _A Pentagon spokesman said ``some increase in military
activity'' had been detected inside Iraq near its borders with
Turkey and Syria. He said there was little indication hostilities
are imminent.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the cost of the U.S. military
buildup in the Middle East was rising above the $1 billion-a-month
estimate generally used by government officials. He said the total
cost _ if no shooting war breaks out _ could total $15 billion in
the next fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   Cheney promised disgruntled lawmakers ``a significant increase''
in help from Arab nations and other U.S. allies for Operation
Desert Shield.
   Japan, which has been accused of responding too slowly to the
crisis in the gulf, said Tuesday it may give $2 billion to Egypt,
Jordan and Turkey, hit hardest by the U.N. prohibition on trade
with Iraq.
   ``The pressure from abroad is getting so strong,'' said Hiroyasu
Horio, an official with the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry.
   Local news reports said the aid would be extended through the
World Bank and International Monetary Fund, and $600 million would
be sent as early as mid-September.
   On Friday, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady visited Tokyo on a
world tour seeking $10.5 billion to help Egypt, Jordan and Turkey.
   Japan has already promised a $1 billion aid package for
multinational peacekeeping forces in Saudi Arabia, including food,
water, vehicles and prefabricated housing for non-military uses.
   But critics in the United States have said Japan should do more
because its economy depends heavily on oil from the Middle East.
Japan imports 99 percent of its oil.
   Japan's constitution bans the use of force in settling
international disputes and Japanese law restricts the military to
Japanese territory, except for ceremonial occasions.
   On Monday, Saddam offered developing nations free oil if they
would send their tankers to pick it up.
   The first two countries to respond Tuesday _ the Philippines and
Namibia _ said no. Manila said it had already fulfilled its oil
requirements, and Namibia said it would not ``sell its
sovereignty'' for Iraqi oil.
   Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez dismissed Saddam's
offer of free oil as a ``propaganda ploy.'' Venezuela, an OPEC
member, has led a drive among oil-producing nations to boost
production to make up for the shortfall caused by the loss of Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil from the world market.
   Their oil makes up 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. Only
Saudi Arabia has higher reserves.
   But according to the State Department, Cuba, which faces an oil
deficit because of reduced Soviet deliveries, has received a
shipment of Iraqi petroleum since U.N. sanctions were imposed five
weeks ago. And Romania, it said, expects to receive oil indirectly
from Iraq.
   Romania's ambassador to the United States, Virgil
Constantinescu, denied that claim Tuesday, calling it ``absolutely
false and without foundation.''

   U.S. Rep. Roy Dyson, who was considered one of
the most vulnerable Congressmen, won the Democratic primary Tuesday
and Gov. William Donald Schaefer easily won the party's nomination
for another term.
   Teacher and part-time house-painter Wayne Gilchrest emerged from
a crowded field as Dyson's Republican challenger.
   Dyson's campaign was rocked by the disclosure that, despite his
hawkish support for defense spending, he was a conscientious
objector during the Vietnam War.
   The news offered an opening to Dyson's chief Democratic primary
opponent, state legislator Barbara Kreamer.
   With 70 percent of the precincts reporting, Dyson had 56
percent, or 20,639 votes, to Kreamer's 30 percent, or 11,100 votes.
Two minor candidates split the remainder.
   Gilchrest, who narrowly lost to Dyson in 1988, won in an
eight-way race with 5,317 votes, or 32 percent.
   Schaefer, seeking a second term, got 77 percent, or 270,626
votes, with 77 percent of the precincts reporting. Real estate
agent Fred Griisser had 23 percent, or 78,921.
   Schaefer will face William S. Shepard, a retired foreign service
officer, who won the Republican primary with 54 percent, or 56,958
votes. Shepard beat Ross Z. Pierpont, loser in 10 previous tries
for public office, who got 46 percent, or 49,287 votes.
   Shepard was the early favorite, but lost a lot of support when
he chose his wife, Lois, as his lieutenant governor running mate.

   Dyson, seeking his sixth term, had close links to defense
contractors implicated in a 1988 Pentagon bid-rigging case. He
returned $20,000 in campaign contributions from those firms.
   Also in 1988, his top aide, Thomas Pappas, jumped to his death
from a New York City hotel room. The suicide followed a newspaper
report that former campaign staffers had complained Pappas made
bizarre and unreasonable social demands on them.

   Carol Bellamy, the New York City Council
president whose political career foundered with a 1985 primary loss
to then-Mayor Edward I. Koch, won the Democratic nomination for
state comptroller Tuesday.
   With 67 percent of the vote counted, Bellamy, 48, beat
Westchester County Clerk Andrew Spano, 72 percent to 28 percent.
She had 176,201 votes to Spano's 68,596.
   Bellamy will face Republican incumbent Edward Regan in the Nov.
6 election.
   The race for the Democratic comptroller's nomination was the
only statewide primary in New York.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, who is seeking a third, four-year term this
year, was unopposed for the Democratic nomination.
   Bellamy, a former state senator, was considered a potential
candidate for governor in the future should she succeed in winning
the comptroller's job.
   In an unusual congressional primary in Rockland County, former
Rep. John Dow, 85, defeated Sean O'Brien Strub, an acknowledged
homosexual, for the nomination to oppose Republican Rep. Benjamin
Gilman.
   Strub, 32, solicited political contributions in a campaign
mailing that also offered condoms and subscriptions to gay
magazines.
   Dow served in Congress from 1964-68 and from 1970-72.
   With 96 percent of the vote counted, Dow had 6,374 votes or 55
percent to 5,169 votes or 45 percent for Strub.

   President Bush will tell Congress tonight that
the Persian Gulf crisis has forged ``a new world order'' in which
the superpower adversaries of the Cold War now stand united to
reverse Iraq's conquest of Kuwait.
   Bush, fresh from his one-day summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Helsinki, will go before a joint session of
the House and Senate with a nationally broadcast address at 9 p.m.
EDT.
   Aides said the president would seek the nation's support for his
decision to send more than 100,000 troops to the gulf region to put
pressure on Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and deter a possible
invasion of oil-rich Saudi Arabia.
   ``He's going to be very candid with them about exactly what
we're doing there and why and what our purposes are,'' said White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``It's going to require a
commitment of resources and time and energy by the American
people.''

   Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy walked the plank and
dropped out of the governor's race after staging a mutiny the
minute Gov. Michael Dukakis left her at the helm to take part in a
trade mission to Europe.
   Murphy quit the race Monday, days after she ordered cuts in
state spending in Dukakis's absence _ and against his orders.
   Her maneuver was blasted as a desperate stunt to rescue her bid
for the Democratic nomination. But she denied those accusations and
said she was simply looking out for the state while Dukakis was
away.
   ``Now there can be no confusion,'' she said Monday in dropping
out. ``This is not a political ploy. It is an honest and necessary
act of leadership.''

   The humiliating removal from power of
Kuwait's royal family has raised questions about how long other
longtime rulers can survive in desert kingdoms carved out by the
swords of their Bedouin ancestors.
   The Iraqi takeover of Kuwait five weeks ago showed the weakness
of its emir and, by extension, of the other five conservative
dynasties running the region's oil-producing states.
   Middle East observers say the winds of political change were
already blowing and that Iraq's seizure of Kuwait has set in motion
forces that will spell the end of the old order _ one way or
another.
   Even the manner in which Saudi Arabia and other monarchies
appealed for help as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein gobbled up
Kuwait underlined their inherent weakness.

   With President Saddam Hussein of Iraq
vowing to hold on to Kuwait, policy-makers in Washington and Moscow
are studying what steps the United Nations can take to tighten the
noose around Iraq.
   ``There are a lot of ways you could rachet up the pressure'' in
a series of small steps, said a State Department official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in
their Helsinki Summit communique, said: ``We are determined to see
this aggression end, and if the current steps fail to end it, we
are prepared to consider additional ones consistent with the U.N.
Charter.''
   Four days after the Aug. 2 invasion and occupation of Kuwait,
the Security Council ordered a complete embargo on trade with Iraq,
with the only goods exempted being medicines and medical equipment
``and, in humanitarian circumstances, foodstuffs.''

would that be the end of his career?
   Political analysts think probably not. But they see dimmer
prospects for his wife, whose real-life District of Columbia
congressional bid appears to be sinking under the weight of her
husband's tax revelations.
   And Norton is not the only candidate having husband trouble this

wealthy husband's complex business dealings, investments and

   Sonia Johnson's life took a dramatic
turn after she was excommunicated from the Mormon Church a decade
ago for actively supporting the proposed Equal Rights Amendment.
   Devastated at first, the onetime devout Mormon became a lesbian
and feminist activist, giving lectures and writing. Now she's
setting out to change the world.
   ``I think of what my mother said, `If you want something done
right, do it yourself,' '' Johnson says. ``Why don't we just do it?
We're going to try to figure out how we would make a world, how
would we make a society?''
   The ``we'' is a handful of lesbians planning an experimental
community based on a simple philosophy that Johnson is sure will be
misunderstood: Everyone does what she wants to do all the time.
   ``We have to trust that our desires are wholesome and good and
that our feelings reflect those desires,'' she says. ``We want to
make a world based on women's values. And we're adamant in only
doing what we want to do.
   ``I'm 54 and for the rest of my life I'm going to do what I want
to do.''
   Johnson envisions a society based on peace, love, harmony, joy
and laughter _ and work.
   The underlying theory is that women will want to work if their
duties are in harmony with their values, and that they'll even
delight in doing it because it will suit them.
   The plan for a new society is Johnson's latest endeavor since
the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints excommunicated her
in 1979 for opposing church authority by actively working for the
ERA.
   Distraught at first, Johnson says now that the ouster, followed
shortly by a painful divorce, led her to a fulfilling career as a
speaker and author.
   ``It was a great boon that the Mormons gave me this new
profession,'' says Johnson, a former university professor with a
doctorate in English education. ``They excommunicated me to shut me
up and really they just gave me a forum. Women don't get that much
poetic justice, so I just revel in it.''
   Johnson ran for president in 1984 on both the Citizens Party and
the Peace and Freedom Party tickets, finishing with 71,947 votes.
Two years earlier, she received 40 percent of the vote in a
second-place finish in the race for president of the National
Organization for Women.
   Today, Johnson sees NOW as a white, middle-class, professional
organization that tries to get women into the mainstream of the
country.
   ``I don't want mainstream,'' she says. ``I want to make another
stream.''
   ``Women have been trying to get men to change the world, saying
they've got to do right by us,'' she says. ``Activism in the
women's movement has been to try to get men to change things. But
this is the way men do worlds. They know the problems, but on the
whole, they think the world is pretty amazing. We're asking the
wrong people to change things.''
   Johnson and her group of six or seven women are looking for a
site for their community.
   She is sure they can successfully divvy up duties depending only
on what they want to do. Some will want to grow vegetables, she
says. Others might want to build or cook or paint or clean or
landscape or fix a leaky faucet.
   Johnson envisions other communities based on the same
philosophy. Hers would focus on gay women because that's where her
interests lie, but she sees other minienvironments comprised of
heterosexuals or gay men.
   The communities could interact, for example, by providing
vegetables to those whose residents didn't want to grow crops or by
doing carpentry for those whose dwellers lacked either the skill or
the desire.
   Her theory leaves room for jobs no one would want to do. How
many people, for instance, really want to clean toilets?
   Suppose, Johnson says, that each of the women in the community
checks out her feelings and finds that, nope, cleaning toilets
doesn't fit in.
   ``But because these women believe that their desires are perfect
guides to behavior, none of them says, `It's got to be done,' ''
she wrote last spring in Woman of Power magazine. ``Trusting their
feelings and knowing that they spring directly from their values,
they realize that since none of them wants to clean it, something
is wrong with the toilet, not with them.''
   For one thing, toilets are too high for most women, Johnson
says, and they waste countless gallons of water. A toilet also
takes ``marvelous, scientifically unreproducible organic matter . .
. and carts it off,'' she says.
   The women thus could decide to replace the conventional toilet
with custom-made composting toilets, she says.
   Johnson feels hundreds of thousands of people across the country
are potential members for new communities like the one she
envisions.
   ``One thing I absolutely know for sure is that this doesn't
work, what we're doing now,'' she says.

   Eastern Europe's tilt toward the West and
Japan's economic ascent in the East appear to be nudging Americans
out of a long-standing apathy toward foreign languages.
   ``There's definitely a boom going on in language studies in this
country,'' said Charles Stansfield of the Center for Applied
Linguistics in Washington. ``The number and percentage of people
studying are as high as they've ever been.''
   About a third of U.S. high school students are taking a foreign
language class this fall, Stansfield estimated, reflecting a steady
rise since the 1970s, when the figure was as low as 23 percent.
   College students and adults also appear to be more immersed in
language studies, educators say, although recent comprehensive
statistics are not available in those categories.
   Educators, however, wonder how long foreign languages will
remain ``a la mode.''
   The United States is solidly entrenched as the most monolingual
of all developed countries. Language training professionals use
such words as ``abysmal'' and ``shameful'' to describe Americans'
foreign-language skills.
   The explosive growth of English in Eastern Europe and its
acknowledged status as the region's No. 2 tongue could give
Americans even more of an excuse to stick with English.
   But developments of the past few years show foreign language
studies on the upswing in the United States.
   For the first time since the mid-1970s, more than a million
college students were studying foreign languages in 1986, the
latest year for which nationwide statistics are available.
Japanese, Chinese, Russian and _ since the fall of the Berlin Wall
_ German all have gained, experts say.
   Consider:
   _ Thirty states have either begun or increased foreign language
requirements for their public schools in the last 10 years, said
Jamie Draper, acting director of the Joint National Committee for
Languages in Washington.
   In at least five states _ Connecticut, Louisiana, New York,
North Carolina and Virginia _ half of all elementary and secondary
school students are now studying a foreign language, according to
the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages. No state
could make such a claim a decade ago, and the council said Arizona
and California will join the group soon.
   _ Japanese language enrollment tripled the past four to five
years to more than 30,000, said Richard Lambert, director of the
National Foreign Language Center at Johns Hopkins University. More
than 300 U.S. schools now have programs in Japanese, compared with
only a few a decade ago.
   Michigan recently required that all high schools offer courses
in Japanese. And under a new pilot program, children in a handful
of communities _ mostly in California, Hawaii and New York _ are
taught Japanese beginning in first grade.
   _ German, which gradually declined in popularity in the 1980s,
has led a resurgence of some Eastern European languages in the
months since the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain were yanked down.
   In the last year, enrollment is up 52 percent for German and 44
percent for Russian at New York-based Berlitz International Inc.,
the largest private language school in the country. Across
Manhattan, the World Trade Institute Language Center says German
enrollment is up 30 percent to 40 percent. Neither company would
release enrollment figures.
   ``People feel that in the long run, these languages will help
their careers,'' said Anthony Tedesco, North American vice
president for Berlitz.
   _ Interest in Russian has soared since Mikhail Gorbachev opened
up the Soviet Union through his policies of ``glasnost.''
   Enrollment in undergraduate Russian classes has risen 40 percent
the last three years at the University of California at Los
Angeles' Center for Russian and East European Studies, considered a
gauge of collegiate interest nationwide in those languages.
   Chinese was the second fastest-growing foreign language, behind
Japanese, in secondary schools from 1983 through 1986, the last
period for which statistics were compiled by the Modern Language
Association. It grew 28 percent during that span to 3,400 students
and continues to surge, experts say.
   ``You can't ignore a language spoken by one-fifth of the human
population and consider yourself to be part of the world,'' said
Norman Colb, schools superintendent in Mamaroneck, N.Y. The New
York City suburb has one of 40 U.S. schools with a grant to teach
Chinese.
   Spanish remains the most widely taught foreign language at the
college level, followed by French, which it surpassed in 1970. Then
come German, Italian, Russian, Latin and Japanese.
   ``Now we're constantly bombarded with other languages because of
satellites, cable TV and increased foreign travel,'' said
Stansfield of the Washington linguistics center. ``We can no longer
demand that our (international) business be done in English.''
   The percentage of high school students studying foreign
languages is now just below the all-time peak year of 1934, when
more than a third of secondary students were in language courses.
   But other developed countries require more of their students.
   The Japanese have made a great effort to learn English,
requiring it be taught from elementary school on, Stansfield said.
Foreign language study is mandatory in continental Europe starting
in seventh grade. Secondary school requirements in Britain also are
tougher than in the United States.
   Skepticism remains among educators and language professionals
whether the U.S. ``boom'' will continue without tougher university
requirements and a government push. Even with the surge in
interest, a Gallup Poll taken last year showed that 71 percent of
504 colleges and universities surveyed still did not require
foreign-language and literature courses.
   But business demands are perhaps the biggest key.
   ``People have got to be shown that there's a place to use it,''
said Lambert of the National Foreign Language Center. ``If we can
establish that there's more need for foreign languages in the
business world and elsewhere, then we'll be seeing an upward trend
for a long time.''

<HEAD>Most Promising Young Conductor Matures</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riccardo Chailly, once one of Europe's ``most
promising young conductors,'' feels that he's entered maturity now
that he's become director of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of
Amsterdam.
   Previously, he and Simon Rattle were the wunderkind conductors
of Europe.
   ``I was always the youngest,'' the 37-year-old conductor said.
``Now is the time to stop it. I started conducting at the age of
14. At whatever I was doing, I was only facing older people. Now is
really the time when I'm not any more the youngest.''
   Chailly (pronounced shy-YEE) was 35 when he became the
Concertgebouw's fifth music director. His predecessors had all been
younger when they started.
   The Royal Concertgebouw, recognized as one of the best
orchestras in the world, will tour in the United States Sept.
17-Oct. 7, its first tour in five years. Chailly will conduct.
   The Concertgebouw celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1988, and
the title Royal was bestowed. Also that year, Chailly became music
director, the first who isn't Dutch. He was born in Milan, the son
of Italian composer Luciano Chailly.
   The name Chailly is French. The ancestor who left France,
Chailly says, was a commissioner for Napoleon. The name was de
Chailly until World War II, when the conductor's father dropped
``de'' which indicated French aristocracy.
   The Royal Concertgebouw does have ``a Dutch sound _ its own
identity of sound . . . clarity, lightness, a wide range and
capacity without ever running into the danger to be bombastic. A
superficial way of playing is completely hated by the orchestra,''
Chailly said.
   ``It is so easy to be proud, to sleep on your own glory. They
also are very aware of that. We are daily devoting ourselves to
protecting that sound.
   ``The Netherlands woodwinds are a very special color _ light,
brilliant, transparent, but never thin.'' The first flutist, he
says, plays a wooden flute.
   Chailly speaks English to the orchestra. ``I studied Dutch one
month in Italy with great effort. It's a very difficult language in
terms of grammar and diction. Thank God in Holland by the first
year of school they learn English. I feel at home talking English.''
   Chailly conducted in England for 10 years, and was principal
guest conductor of the London Philharmonic from 1983-'86.
   He conducted for the first time in Amsterdam in 1985, and didn't
know that Bernard Haitink, music director since 1961, was going to
retire. ``I did my debut with great excitement. It was my first
time ever in front of such an orchestra. Sometimes it's the best
way _ not to know and just go and do your music.''
   When Chailly graduated from music conservatory in Italy at the
age of 19, Claudio Abbado named him assistant conductor at La Scala
for two years. He had studied conducting and composing, but says he
was horrible at composing. The study helped him in interpreting
music.
   In summer breaks, he played drums in a jazz band in northern
Italy. He found that valuable for conducting, too. ``It helped me
develop a clear and determined sense of rhythm. And playing
percussion gave me a sense of the independent use of my hands.'' He
beats time with his right hand and indicates expression with his
left.
   His conducting debut was in Padua at 14, in a concert for young
people. Through his teen years, he conducted Mozart, Bach and
Vivaldi in chamber music concerts in small Italian cities.
   Chailly headed the Berlin Radio Orchestra from 1982 to '89. But
his major international debut was at the Chicago Lyric Opera in
1974 when he was 21, conducting ``Madama Butterfly.''
   That came about through a happenstance that wouldn't be believed
if it was put in a movie.
   The year before, in Sienna, Italy, Chailly ran into Bruno
Bartoletti, artistic director of the Chicago Lyric, when he dropped
into a bar on his way to conduct the final piece at a summertime
concert. He impulsively invited Bartoletti to attend. Bartoletti
couldn't; he was on his way to dinner. But he did go to the concert
late, just as Chailly walked on stage. Impressed with what he
heard, he brought the young man to Chicago.
   Chailly and the Concertgebouw have five new recordings this year
on London Records. His most recent opera recording, with the
Bologna Opera Orchestra and Chorus, is ``Rigoletto,'' starring Leo
Nucci, Luciano Pavarotti and June Anderson.
   Chailly doesn't guest conduct, except in Berlin. ``Before, I was
a little bit of a wild horse. I liked very much traveling. From
1976 to '85 I came to the U.S. every season, to do opera and
symphony. I used to work every six months in England. Now I haven't
been there since six or seven years.
   ``I've got two chief conducting posts. The wild horse time of
the past is over.''

<HEAD>Why is Consumer Credit So High?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans often exhibit a basic instinct about
financial cycles, especially the down side of them, showing by
their behavior that they sense trouble before it descends on the
economy in general.
   They are, you might say, at the very front line of the economic
battle for survival, and out there in the foxholes they pick up the
little hints and signals of rising prices, job insecurity, credit
strains and the like.
   Their test is a practical one: If the money in the wallet
doesn't go as far as it used to, then inflation is creeping higher.
If their neighbor's work week is reduced to four days, they think
about recession and their own job security.
   Presented with such evidence, consumers in the past consumed
less, read price tags that might have been ignored earlier, paid
down credit lines, postponed vacations, decided to use the old car
just one more year.
   Some evidence of hunkering down had begun to appear in the
economic statistics over the past few months, including an
improving savings rate. But then came a report that, at first
glance, seems to blow away the thesis.
   That report: Consumer debt grew during July at an annual rate of
7.4 percent _ the fastest in nine months _ and most of that
increase was in revolving credit, which includes the use of bank
and other credit cards.
   It provokes the question: Has their instinctive intelligence
about such matters deserted the consumer? Or, is the growth in the
use of credit card debt an indication that today's consumer is
forced to the wall?
   Once, not long ago, it was impossible for consumers to obtain
credit that would permit them to spend in defiance of a downturn.
It was a mechanical matter; that is, no bank would give them credit
with which to spend.
   Over the past decade that situation has changed totally. Almost
no consumer needs to fill out a loan application, one of those
old-fashioned questionnaires that asked how much you made, how much
you owed, what the money was needed for.
   Instead, they have a pre-arranged line of credit with the
lender, who quickly delivers the money and agrees not to ask any
embarrassing questions, such as whether the borrower is employed or
whether he intends to repay.
   The oddity of this is that while lenders have created an
easy-credit society for consumers they, and their federal
regulators, have progressively cracked down on loans for healthy
business enterprises.
   A crackdown on production, small as it might be, eventually
leads to an imbalance of supply and demand. But coupled with a
simultaneous spur to consumption through easy credit, it
conceivably could create serious problems.
   The statistical evidence leaves unresolved the reason why
consumer credit grew so much in July.
   It might just be additional evidence of strains on the consumer
wallet as the economy slows, which is bad enough. But it could be
something else, too.
   It could be an indication that a lot of American families are
heading into a deeper hole than if they didn't have the easy use of
credit, heading into a situation from which it won't be easy to
recover.

<HEAD>More Students Entering Workforce Today _ Under Warranty</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LORI DODGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>O'FALLON, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This year's seniors at Fort Zumwalt high
schools will be armed with more than just diplomas when they
graduate: They'll also each be backed by a three-year warranty.
   In a small but growing number of schools, educators are adding
an extra stamp of approval to their products _ ``satisfaction
guaranteed.''
   ``The diploma used to be the guarantee,'' said Fort Zumwalt
superintendent Bernard DuBray. ``But now we need to go above and
beyond.''
   Warranties such as Fort Zumwalt's typically guarantee that a
graduate has learned the basic skills necessary to perform an
entry-level job. If not, the school promises to provide additional
training free of charge.
   ``It's accountability,'' said Bernard Sidman, superintendent of
the Plymouth-Carver Regional School District in Massachusetts,
which first included a three-year warranty with graduates' diplomas
last spring and so far has had no students sent back.
   ``You hear an awful lot about the quality of public education
and about public institutions of education not meeting their
responsibilities in preparing students for entry into public
life,'' Sidman said.
   ``We felt that if we were going to be asking the community to
support us, maybe we should put ourselves on the line.''
   But let the buyer beware: The amount of training received by
guaranteed graduates may vary. Some schools simply warranty all
their graduates. In others, the warranty program is designed mainly
for students who want jobs straight out of high school.
   At Prince George's County School District in Maryland, students
who want to be under warranty take a semester class focusing on job
skills. The class has been developed with input from area business
and industry leaders.
   In Missouri's Blue Springs School District, the state's largest,
the graduate guarantee is printed on the back of a laminated
wallet-size diploma.
   ``We've got some tremendous young people coming out of our
system,'' said superintendent Charles McGraw. ``The nation's
educational system is getting a bad rap and we wanted to make a
point that our graduates had the skills to be good employees.''
   But it's not enough just to warranty students if there's no
recognition of what entry-level jobs in today's business world
require, said Fritz Edelstein, senior fellow at the National
Alliance for Business in Washington, D.C.
   Entry-level jobs are much more complex today, and school studies
should reflect that, Edelstein said.
   McGraw agreed.
   ``I think we went through a time when the curriculum was out of
date,'' he said. ``The curriculum has been slow changing _ it
hasn't kept up with the progress of technology that the business
world required. So this is an attempt to be up to date.''
   For instance, McGraw said, mechanical drawing is out,
computer-assisted drafting is in. At the junior high level, a new
exploratory course called industrial technology is being offered to
introduce students to robotics, broadcasting, electronics and
computer science, he said.
   Educators say skill guarantees have helped create a line of
communication between schools and businesses.
   ``It's a feedback system,'' said Gary Marx, associate executive
director of the American Association of School Administrators in
Arlington, Va. ``It's a way for the schools to say to an employer,
`It's all right to come back and let us know if there's something
missing here.' ''
   In the Harlem Consolidated School District outside Rockford,
Ill., this year's seniors will be able to earn a ``certificate of
employability.''
   The idea came about through meetings between school
administrators and corporate leaders from the community, assistant
superintendent Wayne Musholt said.
   During discussions, company executives expressed concerns about
the employability of some of the students graduating today,
particularly those who were not college-bound.
   ``Their concern was that some of the students didn't always have
the best work habits and attitudes and we decided there ought to be
a way of certifying them,'' Musholt said.
   To gain the certificate, students will have to earn the required
number of high school credits and be absent no more than six days a
year. In addition, their work ``attitudes'' will be rated by their
teachers.
   The program at Prince George's County schools has received high
marks from business and industry leaders, said Bonnie Jenkins,
director of public affairs.
   ``The response has been overwhelmingly positive so far,'' she
said.
   Employers prefer the students who have completed the special
semester course, which emphasizes such areas as work habits and
attitudes, reasoning and problem solving, and oral communication
skills.
   ``So it's giving them an edge,'' she said.
   Last year was the first for the project, and no students have
been referred back for more training, Jenkins said.
   Guarantees rekindle employers' interest in high school graduates
and encourage potential dropouts to stay in school, said Thomas
Shannon, executive director of the National School Boards
Association in Alexandria, Va.
   ``This is adding a new dimension to the diploma,'' he said.
``It's a gimmick _ it's right out of Madison Avenue _ but secondly,
it also sends a powerful message to the school staff that your work
is really on the line.''

   At one time Ray Liotta would have been perfectly
happy to just stay home.
   His mother was the movie fan of the family; Liotta preferred
sports. He went out for the senior play in high school only after
quitting the basketball team because of a fight with his coach.
   And when Liotta decided to study acting at the University of
Miami, he wasn't doing it out of a compulsion to entertain or a
need for artistic expression. He simply had nothing better to do.
   ``My parents wanted me to go to college and I didn't want to
go,'' said Liotta, who stars with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci in
``GoodFellas.''
   ``My parents then suggested I take a year off and find out what
life's all about. I decided to go to the University of Miami and
take drama so I wouldn't have to take a math class. And when I got
there, I didn't want to do anything.''
   But he changed. Not right away; Liotta had no great desire to
act immediately after graduating. But by 1986, when he hustled his
way into a small, but memorable role in ``Something Wild,'' the
actor was hungry for work.
   Now, after ``Dominic and Eugene'' and ``Field of Dreams,'' the
offers come to him. Liotta didn't have to beg for the starring role
of ``GoodFellas.'' He wanted the part and director Martin Scorsese
wanted him. Even De Niro put in a good word.
   The movie runs more than two hours and covers four decades.
Liotta is in virtually every scene.
   ``You have to have a certain amount of confidence to be an
actor,'' Liotta said in an interview. ``In this film, I had to show
jealousy, rage, happiness, anger . . . everything was there. You
want to take that challenge as an actor. It was pretty intense.
   ``I had 80 costume changes, one day's in the '50s, the next
day's in the '80s. Emotionally, it was all different things. One
day I'm sweet. Then the next day I'm coked out of my mind. We'd
span 20 years at one location.''
   ``GoodFellas'' is based on Nicholas Pileggi's best-selling
novel, ``Wiseguy.'' Liotta plays Henry Hill, a half-Irish,
half-Sicilian Brooklyn kid drawn to the fast-paced gangster life
who eventually hooks up with mobsters De Niro and Pesci.
   Off screen, Liotta had to fit in as well. De Niro and Scorsese
have worked many times before, notably in ``Raging Bull'' and
``Taxi Driver.'' Liotta, knowing this was his chance to establish
himself as a major star, did his best to treat the film like just
another job.
   ``These guys have made major, major movies. They're considered
geniuses and brilliant and all that. I just approached it as a
game, just telling a story, no big deal. I read the book about five
years ago and thought, `Geez, I could do this.' ''
   Liotta began acting in soaps shortly after graduating from
college. He worked for three years on ``Another World,''
appreciating the steady work and learning how to feel comfortable
in front of a camera. But after appearing in the short-lived TV
series ``Casablanca'' and ``Our Family Honor,'' he struggled to
find work.
   Having nothing to do wasn't much fun anymore. When Liotta
learned there was an opening for a violent ex-con in ``Something
Wild,'' he pushed hard, trying unsuccessfully to get an audition
and finally calling on his friend, Melanie Griffith, the film's
star.
   ``I said, `Let me phone Melanie'; she was already cast.
(Director Jonathan) Demme was down to three guys and it was the
final week of casting. She said, `Great idea, I'll do that.' I wish
she had thought of that before. I was just so angry about trying to
get in and the part called for an angry guy. I went in angry and
luckily it worked out.''
   He played nice for ``Dominic and Eugene,'' starring as a quiet
medical student who takes care of his retarded brother, and was a
good guy in ``Field of Dreams,'' appearing as the ghost of baseball
great Shoeless Joe Jackson.
   All his characters are motivated by passion, the actor says. For
``GoodFellas,'' it was the drive for money and power. There was his
wife (Griffith) in ``Something Wild,'' his brother in ``Dominic and
Eugene'' and baseball in ``Field of Dreams.''
   Liotta's own passion came during those frustrating times before
``Something Wild,'' when he and fellow unemployed actors Kevin
Costner and Andy Garcia would hang out and try to keep their
spirits up, like frustrated minor leaguers just begging for the
manager to hand them the ball.
   ``I didn't have any doubts about my ability,'' Liotta said. ``I
wasn't wondering when I was going to get a break. I'm not being
cocky, it was tough, no question about it. You see these people,
and think, `I can't do that?' I can at least do it as well, and
with more commitment.''

<HEAD>From South America, Chile Peppers Conquered the World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Chile peppers burn your fingers and can make you cry and sweat,
but still, people come back for more. Cooks and diners over much of
the planet are devoted to them.
   ``The Whole Chile Pepper Book,'' published this week, is for
those who take chiles seriously. If you're among the unschooled,
thinking hot is some chiles and hotter is just some more, you have
a lot to learn.
   And these historians of heat, these cherishers of chiles, may
convert you.
   There are, of course, people who treat the fiery pods as a test
of their bravery, and authors Dave DeWitt and Nancy Gerlach tell
chile-eating contest tales such as John Espinosa's 1988 chow-down
of 29 jalapenos in two minutes flat.
   In 1956, Newsweek reported, contestants in Lousiana were
required to eat progressively hotter peppers and were penalized if
``they winced, shuddered or flinched,'' according to DeWitt and
Gerlach.
   But the authors frown on considering chiles merely a mild danger.
   ``You ought to encourage people to appreciate the finer
qualities of chile peppers than only the burning sensation,'' said
DeWitt, who with Gerlach, a dietitian, has written two previous
cookbooks and edits the Whole Chile Pepper magazine in Albuquerque,
N.M.
   ``They're healthy, they're addictive _ the more you eat of the
spicier foods, the less you want to go back to meat and mashed
potatoes,'' said Jane Butel, a chef and author who owns Pecos
Valley Spice Co. in New York City. ``A little bit can change the
entire complexion of food.''
   When a diner requested some hot sauce at the Fourth Street Grill
in Berkeley, Calif., recently, chef Kurt Koessel sent out crushed
red chiles, a bottled sauce from the Yucatan Peninsula and three
sauces from Belize.
   ``We want to make food that wakes up your mouth, food that isn't
just incidental on the table,'' he said. ``We want it to interrupt
the conversation.''
   To that end, his menu included pineapple habanero chile salsa
with mint and coriander; poblano chiles stuffed with smoked
chicken, apples and jicama; and even a cascabel chile creme brulee
(``You taste the sweetness first. That kind of coats your tongue
and when that fades away, the heat comes on at the end,'' Koessel
said).
   Chiles have at various times in various places been used as
currency, considered an aphrodisiac and been prized as a key to
eternal youth. The authors note their use for more than three dozen
ailments.
   Sometimes, they say, the peppers are cited as the cure and the
cause. Mexicans commonly treat stomachaches by chewing and
swallowing a Serrano chile, while Americans often complain that
chiles give them stomach trouble.
   Nutritionally, they're a bargain. Chiles contain few calories.
Three and a half ounces of fresh chiles contain more than twice the
recommended dietary allowance for vitamin C.
   And then, there's the firepower.
   The heat source, capsaicin, has no flavor, color or odor. It is
measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography in Scoville Units,
named for a pharmacologist who came up with an early measure of
heat.
   Habaneros, also called Scot's Bonnet or Scotch Bonnet, are the
hottest chile known, measuring 200,000 to 300,000 Scoville Units,
the authors say. They quote a Dominican priest, Francisco Ximenez,
as saying in 1722 that a single habanero pod would ``make a bull
unable to eat.''
   The authors quote a 1980 Science News report noting that a
single drop of capsaicin diluted in 100,000 parts of water will
produce a persistent burning on the tongue; diluted in 1 million
parts, it produces a perceptible warmth.
   ``We are not preaching that people submerge the flavors of food
in so much heat that they break out in a sweat and start gagging,''
DeWitt said. ``It does take some getting used to.''
   Novices might avoid, for example, recipes in ``The Whole Chile
Pepper Book'' for Pepper-Peanut Beef Kabobs from Nigeria, which
rate an eight on a heat scale from one to 10; the Berbere Paste
from Ethiopia, rated at nine; or the Sri Lankan Black Curry, an
eight.
   Most of the 180 recipes in ``The Whole Chile Pepper Book''
(Little, Brown and Co., $16.95 paperback) measure four to six, and
that's the range DeWitt said he generally enjoys.
   But the point is to eat chiles, he said. Daily.
   The only requirement of ``The Whole Chile Pepper Diet'' is
chiles in at least one meal a day, 365 days a year.
   ``I eat chile pepper in some form every day, sometimes just a
saay, I had a simple hamburger with sliced
jalapenos on it. Yestelsa on eggs. Todrday, I had some enchiladas,'' DeWitt
said.
   ``I have to have them every day,'' Koessel said, adding that he
finds chiles erotic and curative as well as delicious.
   ``Sometimes you get into a macho thing with them,'' he said.
``On Sunday mornings at the restaurant, if we've had a long night
on Saturday, maybe had a little bit to drink, we have oysters with
habanero sauce. . . . You wake right up.''
   The authors say the earliest evidence of chiles in the human
diet is from Mexico, traced to 7500 B.C.
   Chiles, which are not related to black pepper, are native to
South America and inititally were spread by birds carrying seeds,
the authors say. Then Columbus brought seeds to Europe and from

   The drama that plays daily in criminal
courtrooms around the country is mostly tragedy, and Judge Earl
Strayhorn knows its characters and sad speeches well. Still, in
this second part of the series ``City Faces, City Fears,'' the
jurist who grew up in the inner city says he cannot let his
``sorrow and pity'' cloud the tough judgments he must make.

   It's late morning in Judge Earl Strayhorn's
chambers and today's topic is wasted lives. One young man is dead
in a shooting over drugs. Another, a 19-year-old gang member, will
pay for the crime.
   Now it's bargaining time.
   The 19-year-old's lawyer pleads for mercy. The prosecutor talks
of murder. Then the judge makes his offer: 20 years, take it or
leave it.
   Minutes later, the boyish cocaine dealer, jaw jutting, head
cocked back defiantly, pleads guilty to murder. His mother,
straining to hear in the court's front row, cups her tearful face
in her hands. As she leaves, she's comforted by a youth whose
T-shirt has a moniker on the back: ``Killer.''
   So goes another day in the Cook County courts, another day where
dreams die, where mothers cry, where the strangest and saddest
stories are told, where a few words from the honorable Earl
Strayhorn can mean life or death.
   ``Yes, this IS justice,'' the judge says of the five-minute
bargaining session he estimates saved seven trial days. ``He's not
walking away with a slap on the wrist. Twenty years ain't chopped
liver. The penitentiary is not a country club.''
   For almost 20 years, Strayhorn has judged the crimes and
misdemeanors of urban America. This tart-tongued veteran of the
nation's largest court system says he's a pragmatist, not a
dreamy-eyed crusader out to right every wrong.
   ``I am NOT society's avenging angel,'' he declares. ``I am NOT
sitting in order to act as the conscience of society and to impose
the horrible wrath of the Lord on people who commit horrible
crimes.''
   And he has heard his share: the teen who threw her baby down a
garbage chute into a compacter, the guy who axed his grandmother to
death, the man who hacked off his lover's head and toes and mailed
them.
   ``Life in this day and age is cheaper than a piece of meat in
the meat market,'' Strayhorn says. ``People will haggle over the
cost of steak more than they will consider the worth of a human
life.
   ``I cope with that. But,'' he adds slowly, ``I never get used to
it.''
   In fact, Strayhorn believes the world has turned harsher since
he first donned black robes: more vicious crimes, more drug use,
younger offenders.
   But this man who has climbed the steps of the Depression-era
criminal courts building for 42 of his 72 years, as a prosecutor,
defense attorney and now judge, decided long ago not to allow the
cruelty eat him up.
   ``I put a shield on. I don't let it get behind that shield,'' he
says, sitting in his chambers, lined with awards, memorabilia and
photos of his wife, lawyer-son, doctor-daughter and grandchild.
   Strayhorn disposes of 500 to 550 cases a year, about 60 percent
in pleas or bench trials. In 1989, 28,647 felony cases were filed
in the county's criminal division, more than triple the number of a
decade earlier, officials say. An estimated 75 percent were tied to
drugs.
   Strayhorn says being a black raised in Chicago _ he now lives a
15-minute drive from work _ better prepared him to be a judge: He
understands the environment and experiences of many who become
court statistics.
   But when the white-haired, bespectacled judge takes the bench in
his cavernous marble and wood courtroom, he's no soft touch.
   ``Why are you wearing that junk?'' he snaps at a bearded drug
offender whose earring he takes as a sign of gang membership.
``When you come into court, you better take it out. You're caught
with them, their dirt is going to spill over on you and I'm going
to send you to the penitentiary. Do you understand?''
   A suspected burglar fares no better. His lawyer wants his bond
reduced, arguing that he supports four children. Strayhorn asks how
much he gives the mother each week and questions his claim that a
job's waiting. The man mumbles a confused answer.
   Strayhorn interrupts, snarling at the lawyer: ``Don't make him
lie. Tell him to SHUT UP.... That's why he's here. He's a liar!''
   ``You can't put anything over on the guy,'' says Jack Murphy, a
prosecutor. ``He's seen it all. He's heard it all.''
   But Strayhorn has a lighter side, too. He teases a balding
lawyer: ``This case has got all the hair on it you lost off your
head.'' He needles another, ``You're starting off on the short end
of the stick. This one happened in my neighborhood.''
   And at a civil marriage ceremony for a jail inmate, Strayhorn
suddenly looks up from his paperwork and barks: ``Hey, man, kiss
her!''
   After a generation on the bench, Strayhorn says punishment
remains the toughest part of the job.
   He has imposed the death penalty twice, though he morally
opposes it, and once sentenced a gang rapist to 125 years,
prompting the man to retort: ``I hope you croak in bed tonight.''
   But he also acknowledges he probably gives more probation than
other judges _ in about 85 percent of his cases.
   ``My probation is harder to do than doing time,'' he argues.
``You have to use some self-discipline. ...That's punishment,
particularly when they know what they've got hanging over their
head is a big sword.
   ``If I send this malleable kid down to the penitentiary, all
he's going to learn down there is how to be a bigger, worse
crook,'' he adds.
   When ordering probation, Strayhorn always tells criminals what
their prison sentences will be if they violate it. He gives no
second chances.
   ``I'm arrogant,'' he says. ``I have confidence in myself. I feel
I'm better than most and as good as the best.''
   Still, he says, ``not a day goes by that I don't remember that I
am black and being a judge really hasn't changed that.''
   It becomes a theme when he speaks to groups of young people.
   ``When does a black person become a nigger in our society?'' he
says he asks such groups. ``And their eyes widen and then somebody
says, `I don't know, when?' I say, `When you leave the room.' ''
   ``The moral of the story ... I know I'm good, but I'm still
black. That means I'm not going to receive the benefit of being
good merely because I have been good. I'm going to have to be
something more.''
   Strayhorn says he knows racism and other urban ills often are
factors in crimes. That doesn't sway him.
   ``All I can do is put a Band-Aid on the cancer,'' he says. ``If
I allow my sorrow and my pity and my understanding that there is an
explainable reason this person is just a step above an animal, if I
allow the feeling to outweigh my judgment, I'm not going to be a
good judge.''

   Drug cases have clogged urban courts, delayed
civil matters, overcrowded jails and stirred new debate over the
best possible solution _ legalization or more judges.
   ``If you want to look at the largest single cause of caseload
glut, drugs are it,'' said Albert Alschuler, professor at the
University of Chicago Law School. ``We're having fewer and fewer
trials, particularly on the civil side. No one can afford to wait.
The system's just become unworkable.''
   Much of the impact is on state courts, which process about 97
percent of drug arrests. But the federal system also is feeling the
crunch. Consider:
   _ Drug cases in federal courts increased by 280 percent since
1980, Chief Justice William Rehnquist said last December in his
annual end-of-the-year report. He urged Congress to act immediately
on a proposal to create new judgeships.
   In July, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a measure to
create 77 new judgeships. The bill is pending in the Senate.
   _ Federal drug cases represented more than 26 percent of new
criminal filings, and up to 60 percent in some districts, Rehnquist
said. Nearly 55 percent of criminal appeals involved drug offenses,
compared with 30 percent in 1980.
   _ The drug caseload rose by 56 percent in 17 big-city courts
between 1983 and 1987, according to a 1989 report, ``The Impact of
Drug Cases on Case Processing in Urban Trial Courts.'' Among the
major increases: Boston _ 175 percent; Jersey City, N.J. _ 114
percent; the Bronx borough of New York City _ 109 percent; and
Oakland, Calif. _ 95 percent.
   _ Drug-related cases made up about a quarter of felonies
disposed of in 26 big-city courts in 1987, the report said. It
noted that number actually is low because it doesn't count
incidents in which drugs were involved but didn't constitute the
most serious charge.
   The situation has turned even grimmer since then; in Detroit,
the percentage of state court drug cases more than doubled from
1987 to 1989, said John Goerdt, the report's co-author and senior
staff attorney at the National Center for State Courts.
   Drug cases, he added, are ``starting to show up in family
courts, in juvenile courts, with abused and neglected kids.''
   When courts are stressed, ``nobody can render the same quality
of justice,'' said James Fyfe, a criminal justice professor at
American University in Washington, D.C. ``We all know the old saw
that justice delayed is justice denied. ... Evidence disappears.
Recollections grow dimmer.''
   Complicating matters, experts say, are new mandatory sentencing
laws, leading some defendants to seek trial rather than pleading
guilty, adding to the backlog.
   In Goerdt's report, jury trials in the 26 big-city courts
disposed of only 6 percent of all felonies in 1987.
   While some propose more staff, U.S. District Judge Robert W.
Sweet in New York last year became the first federal judge to
publicly advocate drug legalization. The burden is so great, he
said, that in September 1989, no federal juries in Manhattan were
available to hear civil trials.
   Others who have previously supported legalization include
Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke and conservative columnist William F.
Buckley.
   Regardless of different proposals, experts agree the impact is
enormous.
   ``The taxpayers are spending lots of money to warehouse people
in jail,'' Alschuler said. ``(Inmates) are sleeping on floors on
mattresses. ... Everybody in the system suffers.''

<HEAD>Scientists Watch Life Appear on Forbidding Volcanic Isle</HEAD>

   Nearly 30 years ago, a new volcanic island
appeared in the North Atlantic, and it has been off-limits to all
but scientists ever since. AP Science Editor Paul Raeburn is one of
the few people to visit this most recent addition to the Earth's
real estate.

<DATELINE>SURTSEY, Iceland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the early morning darkness on Nov.
14, 1963, a sudden turbulence rocked a fishing vessel 20 miles
south of Iceland.
   When day broke, the thick smell of sulfur hung over the deck,
and a towering column of smoke rose nearby. The crew of the
Isleifur II watched as a fiery undersea eruption gave birth to a
glowing volcanic island.
   That island, now called Surtsey, is the newest place on Earth.
   Before the lava cooled, Icelandic scientists decided Surtsey
should be preserved as a natural laboratory.
   ``I foresaw this was a golden opportunity to see how life would
settle on the island,'' said Sturla Fridriksson, a biologist at
Iceland's Agricultural Research Institute in Reykjavik.
   ``I went out there in the first phases of the eruption and saw
that birds were already using that dry place. The seagulls were
apparently the first living things to set foot on the island.''
   For nearly 30 years now, Surtsey has given scientists a glimpse
of what might have happened when life appeared on the primordial
Earth billions of years ago.
   The latest studies reveal the appearance of the first true plant
communities on the island, said Fridriksson, who has studied
Surtsey almost from the beginning.
   Geologists, too, have an opportunity for unique research.
   ``This is a chance for people to observe the formation of
oceanic crust, except that it's above the water,'' said Kathleen
Crane of the Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory in Palisades,
N.Y., who has spent time on Surtsey. ``We know there must be
thousands of Surtseys, maybe millions, on the ocean floor, but we
can't see them.''
   Surtsey _ named after Surtur, a giant in Old Norse mythology who
came from the south bearing fire _ has been visited by fewer than
100 people.
   Access is strictly controlled by a committee of Icelandic
scientists. Before stepping foot on the island, visitors are
instructed to empty their pockets, shoes and trouser cuffs to
prevent accidental importation of seeds.
   The island is about 90 minutes by boat from Iceland's Westmann
Islands, a volcanic archipelago off Iceland's southern coast. Boats
can't dock on the island, so visitors transfer to a small rubber
dinghy to get to a black-sand beach littered by driftwood from as
far away as Siberia.
   ``You may even get coconuts here,'' said Jon Olafsson, a chemist
at Iceland's Marine Research Institute.
   Further inland, the black sand beach gives way to a colorful
patchwork of red, yellow, orange and blue soils. Steam curls from
gaping vents, or fumaroles. In some spots, volcanic ash has
hardened into tuff, a natural concrete. In other places, molten
lava has cooled into hazardous fields of jagged black rock,
razor-sharp but soft enough to break off in the hand.
   Arni Johnsen, now an editor at Iceland's largest newspaper and a
sometime member of parliament, was recruited to move to the island
as caretaker a few months after the eruption began.
   His job was to keep intruders away and monitor scientific
experiments in between researchers' visits.
   ``Sometimes I woke up in the night falling from my bed with the
earthquakes,'' said Johnsen, who was then 20 years old. ``But you
get used to it. The island was moving all the time _ like a heart.''
   Once he was trapped in a lava flow, and had no choice but to
make a dash across the molten rock. His shoes burned completely
away. ``I was in socks when I came off the lava _ Icelandic thick
wool socks,'' he said. ``I only burned my feet a little.''
   A day after the crew of the Isleifur II spotted the smoke from
the eruption, the lava had broken the ocean's surface, rising 425
feet from the ocean floor in only two days.
   Lightning and thunder accompanied the glowing craters, fissures
and boiling water.
   ``The atmosphere was primeval,'' said Fridriksson.
   The eruption continued for four years. Two other smaller islands
also were formed, but quickly disappeared under the pounding of the
waves and the wind.
   ``The wind erosion is important,'' said Sveinn Jakobsson, head
of the geology department at the Icelandic Museum of Natural
History. ``This is a very stormy place.''
   The assault of the elements is wearing Surtsey down, too. When
it was formed, it covered 270 hectares, or about one square mile.
Now it has shrunk to about three-fourths of that. It also has
slumped from a height of 575 feet to about 490 feet.
   ``It started to diminish very quickly,'' said Jakobsson. ``Then
the rate of erosion went down. During the past five years, it's
something like one hectare per year.''
   The erosion also is changing Surtsey's composition. Geologists
observed that certain elements, including sodium, potassium,
calcium, aluminum and silica, were leached out of the ash. Iron and
titanium weren't.
   The process is just now resulting in the first bits of true soil
on the island, Jakobsson said.
   Despite the erosion, the island is not likely to disappear as
quickly as its two former neighbors, he said.
   ``What's going to save Surtsey is the tuff,'' he said. ``We are
pretty certain this island will last for a long time _ probably
several hundred years, possibly several thousand years.''
   Fridriksson made his first discovery a few months after the
eruption began.
   ``I went out there in the spring to see if I could find forms of
life,'' he said, ``and I found seeds of sea rocket and lyme
grass.'' When he brought them back to his laboratory, they sprouted.
   ``That was proof they could survive the transport,'' he said. He
determined that seeds were arriving by way of ocean currents, in
the wind and through more unorthodox means.
   Some, for example, arrived clinging to ``mermaids' purses,''
cast-off egg cases of the flat fish called skates. Snow buntings
brought seeds from Scotland in their gizzards.
   Fridriksson found the first plant on Surtsey, a lone sea rocket,
during the first summer. That was a second milestone.
   ``It's one thing to get dispersed to an island, and altogether
another thing to be a successful colonist,'' he said.
   The next milestone Fridriksson searched for was the appearance
of permanent colonists. ``There are many that have established
themselves as single examples and have not been able to multiply,''
he said.

   Sea sandwort appeared on the island for three or four years
before it began producing seeds and became a permanent resident, he
said.
   Another milestone is just now occurring: The isolated patches of
sea sandwort are developing into plant communities.
   ``Gradually sand drifts into this mat, and it forms a sand
dune,'' Fridriksson explained. Seeds of lyme grass germinate in the
sand, sheltered by the sandwort.
   The black-backed seagull uses the patch for nesting. ``It brings
in food for the young, and the excrement from the young and the
adult bird fertilize the plant,'' he said.
   Interactions like that are the culmination of nearly 30 years of
the development of life on Surtsey, Fridriksson said.
   And he expects the island to continue to develop in wondrous,
unpredictable ways.
   ``Whenever you come to Surtsey, you always find something new,
something surprising which you haven't expected,'' he said. ``It's
a revelation. And it directs one's thoughts to the origin of life
on Earth _ and to the fate of life.''
   For life on Surtsey eventually will disappear.
   ``Surtsey will become steeper and smaller,'' Fridriksson said.
``Finally, it will become just a rock that will be broken up by the
waves. . . .
   ``And that will be the end. Those who study that will be able to
tell how a society is built up _ and how it's destroyed.''

   Surtsey, like Iceland itself, is a piece
of the mid-Atlantic ridge.
   Extending from Greenland to Antarctica, the ridge is the Earth's
largest geological feature. It was formed when continent-sized
plates of the Earth's crust started to separate, allowing molten
magma to well up in between.
   The ancient Icelandic parliament site of Thingvellir, east of
Reykjavik, lies astride the gap between the North American and
Eurasian plates.
   ``You can see North America on one side, and right next to you,
Eurasia,'' said Kathleen Crane of the Lamont-Doherty Geological
Observatory in Palisades, N.Y., who has done research on Surtsey.
   The two continents move an average of nearly an inch farther
apart each year.
   Icelanders revel in their country's unusual origin, Crane said.
   ``You go into the bookstores and the hot sellers are people's
Ph.D. theses about volcanology,'' she said.

   A lasting icon of America's vitality is its
cities: skyscrapers crowd the horizon, universities and medical
centers teach and heal, a glittering nightlife beckons with cafes
and theaters. But there is another image of the cities: a montage
of homeless people sleeping on heating grates, of crime victims
bleeding in ambulances, of poverty and drugs and fear and
hopelessness. This story launches an intermittent series, ``City
Faces, City Fears,'' which looks through the eyes of urban
Americans at the pressures they face every day.

   For the Turners, there could be no place to live
but the city.
   Their condo has everything: a harbor view, a Jacuzzi, proximity
to dozens of chic restaurants. It's a quick walk to work for John,
a venture capitalist. Carole sells Japanese prints from the
building. Their sailboat is moored outside, convenient for a
weekend ride to Marblehead.
   ``We all like city life,'' says Carole. ``The suburbs are too
stifling, too boring. Here, there's everything.''
   Crime is mostly a rumor. Some cars have been burglarized, but
there's a guard downstairs and a neighborhood network of doormen
and valet parkers keep watch. Fourteen-year-old Brian rides the
subway to private school without incident. His closest brush came
when he saw a shoplifter arrested at Filene's.
   ``He was very shocked by it,'' said his mother.
   Three miles and a world away, the Rev. Bruce Wall takes four
boys, ages 14 to 16, to a pizza parlor in the city's
violence-scored Dorchester section to hear what they have to say
about their lives.
   ``Did they talk about basketball or girls, jobs, cars or their
future? No. They said, `We know that we're either going to get shot
or stabbed,' and they discussed which they'd rather have happen to
them,'' said Wall.
   ``Their choice in life was to be shot.''
   More than 20 years ago, after riots scorched Detroit, Newark,
Los Angeles and other cities, the President's National Advisory
Commission on Civil Disorders _ the Kerner Commission _ issued a
warning.
   U.S. cities, it said, were ``moving toward two societies, one
black, one white _ separate and unequal.''
   After two decades of waxing and waning federal aid to the
cities, the warning seems prophetic. ``Now it is coming true,''
said Fred Harris, who, as an Oklahoma senator, served on the Kerner
Commission.
   Two years ago, Harris, a University of New Mexico professor,
headed a private commission that reviewed the state of the cities.
It concluded that instead of street rioting, urban centers are now
undergoing ``quiet riots,'' daily encounters with poverty, crime,
family dissolution, housing and school deterioration.
   Disproportionately, these riots hurt the minorities and poor of
the city; the battle lines are set along neighborhood boundaries of
wealth and race.
   Again, two societies.
   Amid the new construction of office buildings and million-dollar
condominiums, pockets of poverty are growing deeper and wider.
   Amid the explosion of technology, schools are crumbling and
illiteracy rates remain high.
   Amid the lifesaving techniques of organ transplants and laser
surgery, the life expectancy rate is dropping for those in the
inner city.
   Two societies, separated by income, opportunity, even, in a
sense, by language.
   William Labov, a University of Pennsylvania linguist, has made a
study of urban dialects. While the verbs and nouns sound the same,
the polarization within the city is creating two separate
languages, Labov said.
   Labov uses the example of the word ``be,'' as in ``She been
married.''
   ``To most white people it means she was married; to most blacks
it means she was married and has been married a long time,'' he
said. ``The machinery of language is changing and the differences
can lead to misunderstanding.''
   This fragmentation of the city is most glaring in the
once-muscular industrial centers of the North and East, which have
seen a decline in population or only scant growth. Cities of the
Sun Belt and the West are experiencing steady population growth,
with the exception of oil region towns like Denver, Dallas and
Houston. Yet all urban centers share some of the same issues.
   One major problem is the migration of the middle class, both
white and black, from inner-city neighborhoods to the suburbs and
beyond.
   In their wake are left poorer neighborhoods with less political
power and fewer resources.
   Statistics illustrate some of this trend. Gary Orfield, a
University of Chicago political scientist, said many northern
cities have seen white populations drop by a sixth and black
populations slip by a 20th. The number of Hispanics in many urban
areas has doubled.
   As a result, nearly 40 percent of the nation's minority students
and 30 percent of its poor children now are educated in urban
school districts.
   While much of the nation prospered in the steady economic growth
of the 1980s, many inner-city neighborhoods headed in the opposite
direction. Poverty rates for the nation's central cities rose from
12.7 percent of the population to 19 percent.
   A drive through the city can illustrate the effects of growing
poverty.
   ``In Chicago, there are neighborhoods where you can count up the
number of bank branches and retailers that have closed up and five
liquor stores have taken their place,'' said Greg Duncan, program
director of the University of Michigan's Survey Research Center.
   ``You can clearly see neighborhoods shifting from working class
to hardcore poverty.''
   Harris points to Detroit as another example. Through the 1980s,
the city lost many of its jobs and nearly a third of its population.
   ``People, black and white, who could, moved out to the
suburbs,'' he said. ``A lot of poor blacks have moved in. The
movement of blacks and whites to the suburbs and the middle class
has been a very good thing for them, but it hasn't been that good
for the city.''

<HEAD>BOSTON: the city.</HEAD>

   But which part of the city? Within each city are many different
cities: the city of neighborhoods and the city of business and
shopping districts, some sparkling and rich, some decaying and poor.
   Many downtowns have blossomed, with new office towers, new jobs
and a range of stores and restaurants catering to the urban
professional, from Neiman-Marcus to Mrs. Field's cookies.
   ``The city offers more,'' said George Jedlin, a Boston real
estate agent who lives in a downtown condominium. ``I've been to
the theater 15 times this year, and I love to eat. In the suburbs,
there are no restaurants.''
   But while many cities have seen commercial construction grow,
residential construction has remained static or fallen. Most of the
deficit has been in affordable housing.
   A report last year by the non-profit Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities said that while the number of renters with annual
incomes less than $10,000 rose from 8 million to 11.6 million from
1978 to 1985, available low-rent units decreased by half a million.
   ``Chicago has had an incredible investment in the Loop at the
same time we have many dying neighborhoods,'' said Orfield. ``The
way things are going,'' he warned, ``we'll have people living not
too far apart from each other, but in different worlds.''
   Orfield also notes that the downtown boom, while creating jobs
for those in the suburbs, has brought little improvement for
minority city dwellers.
   ``Chicago employment statistics show only one out of six young
black men have a job. If that is true, you have a calamity,'' said
Orfield.
   Many would argue there are calamities taking place each day.
Calamities of drugs, of gangs, of violence.
   One telling statistic: Homicide is the leading cause of death
for black males ages 15 to 19. Some might be not be surprised if
the carnage was taking place only in Detroit or Washington, D.C.,
but it is happening, too, in cities like Boston, Milwaukee and St.
Louis.
   Irving Spergel, a University of Chicago sociologist and an
expert on street gangs, said such groups always have existed. What
is new is their longevity and firepower.
   ``Unlike before, the kids don't leave the gangs as they get
older, because there's no place to go,'' he said. ``Drug
trafficking makes for a good opportunity. And the weaponry has
improved.''
   If parts of the city have become a war zone, many of its
citizens are exhibiting something akin to battle fatigue.
   Michael McKeon, an Evanston, Ill.-based pollster who has worked
with the Democratic National Committee, said interviews with city
residents show a growing resignation to the problems.
   ``To them, there has become a basic irrelevance to the system,''
he said. ``The lady who lives in the high-rise condo and the kid in
the poor neighborhood have some of the same fears and frustrations
about living in the city, but they're not angry with the
government. How can you get angry at its failure to deliver when
you don't expect it to work in the first place?''
   Yet through it all, the people of both cities, the city of the
rich and the city of the poor, remain committed to their home.
   ``You can have a mansion in the suburbs for what you can get in
the city,'' said Judy Krupnik, who lives in a one-bedroom Boston
condo. ``But in a city, you feel more vibrant. You feel a different
pulse.''
   For Pam Jones, a mother of two in Boston's mostly black Roxbury
section, it is a sense of community. Jones moved back to the city
neighborhood where she was raised and intends to stay, despite the
threat of crime made real by the sound of gunfire in the night.
   ``I like the neighborhoods here. I like the people,'' she said.
``We are not thinking about leaving. We are trying to do what we
can to turn things around and make it a neighborhood that we can be
proud of.''

   Thursday evenings are family time at the home of
Antonio and Carolyn Benson, a time reserved to discuss schoolwork
or chores. But one Thursday, Benson gathered his boys, ages 5, 8
and 11, in the living room and reviewed what to do when they hear
gunshots.
   ``I told them that no matter where they were, at home or in a
car, they should get down on the ground; that they shouldn't be
looking around or curious about what's happening,'' said Benson, in
the even tone of a parent telling a child to look both ways before
crossing the street.
   The sound of gunfire isn't yet that common on the quiet street
in Boston's Dorchester section where Benson grew up and now tries
to raise his boys to manhood. But there are other troubling sounds,
sounds of a distant storm.
   Like the talk about the two teen-agers shot up on Greenwood
Avenue last winter, and, closer to home, talk about the bullet that
went through a neighbor's window down the street.
   There are whispers about the Greenwood Gang, a group of teens
believed to be dealing drugs a few streets over, and the Junior
Greenwoods, a gang of boys younger than 11-year-old Victor Benson,
in a rush to mimic the hard ways of their older brothers.
   ``They do bad things, like robbing ladies,'' Victor explains
with a nervous smile.
   It is boys like Victor and his brothers, Giovanni and Stefon,
who are key to which side will win the inner city wars. Tony and
Carolyn Benson envision their sons as ``aware young black men,''
future professionals who can save their community from chaos. ``Me
and my Dad want me to be a lawyer,'' says Victor, who then lists
other goals more common for a boy his age: an artist, a football
player, a track star.
   ``When I grow up I want to be a police officer,'' Giovanni pipes
in. His father winces when the 7-year-old assumes a combat shooting
stance and makes gun noises.
   It is a reminder for Benson, a 28-year-old schoolteacher, that
these days his boys are at risk as potential fodder for the drugs,
the gangs and the associated dangers of the street.
   ``I don't have a lot of fear for myself, but I am afraid that
something could happen to one of my boys,'' says Benson. ``I'm
afraid we're going to lose a lot of our kids in this generation.''
   The Bensons do their best to keep their sons from temptation.
Victor and Giovanni are in a program that sends them to school in
the affluent suburb of Weston. After school and on weekends, they
are kept busy with activities like junior track, basketball and
family outings.
   ``We've got to have alternatives for them; we try to keep them
in programs,'' says Carolyn, who works in the state Department of
Social Services. ``I try to be with my kids, know where they are
and who their friends are.''
   Victor turns quiet when asked about going out alone. For the
most part, his time is structured, but sometimes, in the summer, he
rides his bicycle around the neighborhood. ``I get a little nervous
about going outside,'' he says. His eyes go wide when asked what
he'd do if recruited by a gang.
   ``I'd run,'' he explains patiently. ``If you join a gang, you
have to do something bad. And sometimes when you join a gang and
you want to get out, they shoot you.''
   Each day at school, where he teaches English, social studies and
reading to 11- and 12-year-olds, Benson is reminded of the dangers
of the city.
   ``We have kids who come from homes with drug addiction or
alcoholism and they grow up too quick,'' he says. ``I see young men
out there who are searching for strong male role models. When they
don't see that at home, they look to somebody who is strong,
somebody who's making it, and that's the drug dealers.''
   Despite the stray bullets, the gangs, the drugs and the crime,
the Bensons want to stay in the neighborhood where they both grew
up.
   Tony has tried to make their neighborhood safer. He persuaded
some drug dealers hanging out on his street to take their business
elsewhere. He also tried setting up a Crimewatch program to combat
a rash of burglaries. But after a few meetings, ``folks got
disinterested.''
   ``People are busy trying to maintain their own life and their
own families,'' he says. ``They just don't have time for anybody
else.''
   ``If it becomes unbearable, I'd like to move to a place that's
quiet with a yard and homeowners on the street,'' says Carolyn.
``But I don't want to live in a suburb. I've lived my whole life
here.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Reports issued last year by the National Center for Health
Statistics paint a grim picture for people in the inner city:
   _ Homicide is the leading cause of death for black males ages 15
to 19. Between 1984 and 1987, the rate jumped 53 percent for this
group. The latest figures show that 60 young black males per
100,000 are homicide victims. Eight out of 10 of those deaths are
due to firearms. The overall homicide rate is six times higher for
blacks.
   Forty-one percent of black male teen-age deaths are related to
firearms, compared to 16 percent for white male teens. Drug-related
homicides are twice as common for blacks as they are for whites.
   _ Inner-city residents face a much greater risk of AIDS
infection.
   The rate of infection rose 51 percent among black males age 13
and older. It increased 30 percent for white males. The infection
rate rose 42 percent for white females. But it rose 74 percent
among black females and 97 percent among Hispanic females, at risk,
in part because they face a greater chance of having sexual
partners who are intravenous drug users.
   In New York and New Jersey, AIDS is the leading cause of death
among black women ages 15 to 44. AIDS now is the 10th leading cause
of death among blacks nationwide. It is the 15th for whites.
   Other diseases take a greater toll on the inner-city population.
Among blacks, the death rate for kidney disease and diabetes is
more than twice that of whites. For influenza and pneumonia, the
rate is 1{ times higher. Hepatitis B strikes blacks at a rate four
times higher than whites.
   Black infants face twice the risk of dying as white babies.
   All these factors combined to lower black life expectancy. In
1987, the last year data was available, white life expectancy rose
to 75.6 years, up from 74.4 in 1985, while black life expectancy
dropped from 69.7 to 69.4 years.

<HEAD>Report Says Domestic Policies Still Hamper Food Output in Much of
Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The vastness of Africa south of the Sahara is
matched by the awesome poverty and food shortages in some of the 38
countries that make up the region.
   Yet, some of those nations have had glimmers of success in
boosting food production, and an Agriculture Department review
suggests others could follow if reforms are carried out effectively.
   The report by Shahla Shapouri and Stacy Rosen of the
department's Economic Research Service said market-oriented
reforms, better weather and more help from the world community have
helped brighten the outlook for some of the sub-Saharan countries.
   Poverty is rampant. The region's 38 countries have a combined
gross national product _ the sum value of all goods and services in
a year _ of about $150 billion, about the same as Belgium's.
   But the region's population is 500 million, about 50 times that
of Belgium. Since 1965, population has grown at the rate of 3
percent a year, doubling since then.
   Arable farmland, taken for granted in the United States and many
other countries, is at a premium in sub-Saharan Africa.
   Of the 38 countries, 13 do not have enough arable land to meet
the needs of growing populations under subsistence farming
practices. These are Botswana, Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho,
Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Somalia and
Uganda.
   ``These nations account for one-third of the region's land area
and half of its population,'' the report said. ``However, several
have vast amounts of land that is underutilized because of
rudimentary farming practices.'' The report also cited government
taxing policies.
   One of the major problems of agriculture in the developing world
is the availability and proper use of materials that can boost
production. These include fertilizer, improved seed, pesticides,
irrigation and other ``inputs'' that have become commonplace in the
developed world.
   But throughout sub-Saharan Africa, ``capital inputs are seldom
applied to food production,'' the report said.
   ``Fertilizer and tractor use is the lowest in the world and, for
the most part, uneconomical,'' it added. ``That's because grower
prices are often held down by government policies.''
   For example, researchers found that the use of fertilizer in the
region averages about 5.6 kilograms per hectare, compared with 26
kilos in India and 48 kilos in Mexico. A kilogram is about 2.2
pounds and a hectare is 2.47 acres.
   ``Crop varieties are mostly traditional and, although adapted to
the harsh climate, yields are low even under favorable growing
conditions,'' the report said.
   Thus, it would follow that ``any improvement in technology
should substantially affect productivity'' in the region's
agriculture.
   ``For example, in some areas of Zimbabwe, Zambia and Kenya, use
of hybrid corn has increase yields to 5 to 7 tons per hectare, more
than four times the region's average,'' the report said.
   A metric ton of 2,205 pounds is equal to about 39.4 bushels.
Five to seven tons per hectare _ 2.47 acres _ would be in the range
of 197 of about 80 to 97 bushels per acre.
   By comparison, the average U.S. corn yield this fall was
estimated in August at 7.39 tons per hectare, or 117.7 bushels per
acre.
   The report noted, however, that the Foreign Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations has said that improved methods
and greater investment in inputs might not be enough in all
countries in the region.
   ``Arable land is in such short supply in several sub-Saharan
countries _ including Burundi, Lesotho, Mauritania, Rawanda and
Somalia _ that they could not achieve self-sufficiency by the turn
of the century even if their technologies were to match those now
used in Asia and Latin America,'' the report said.
   Still, changes in government policies so farmers would have
higher prices and other incentives would boost total production.
   ``A realistic price policy, however, is only one essential
element in a comprehensive government package designed to increase
output,'' the report said. ``Further government actions on wage
rates, interest rates, population control, trade and food aid are
needed to ensure agriculture's growth.''
   Structural adjustment policies have been adopted by many
sub-Saharan countries, but researchers found that response has been
mixed.
   ``Even under the reforms, governments in most countries of the
region continue to control many agricultural prices, marketing and
farm input supplies,'' the report said.

   Mercedes-Benz doesn't think
it will be able to shrink the annual $18 million-plus bill it's
been paying for violating federal fuel efficiency regulations,
company executives said.
   Companies selling cars in the United States must pay a penalty
if the average fuel economy rating for those cars doesn't meet
certain standards. A gas-guzzler tax may also be imposed on the
company's least efficient models.

   Jet fuel costs have soared since Iraq invaded
Kuwait, but it's anyone's guess whether an airline ticket will cost
you more or less in coming months.
   ``Indications are that they're going up,'' said Raymond E.
Neidl, an airline analyst with Dillon, Read &amp; Co. Inc. ``Airlines
are getting around that by jacking up the basic fare and then
offering various discounts.''
   For the time being, some fares are rising and others are falling
in a phenomenon that Neidl described Monday as ``turmoil in
pricing.''
   The latest price changes are a temporary round of cheaper fares
to Europe.
   Trans World and Northwest announced over the weekend that they
were offering some special low fares on trans-Atlantic flights, for
fall and winter tickets purchased by Sept. 21. On Monday, airlines
saying they would follow suit included USAir and Pan Am.
   Other carriers were studying the overseas fare cut. They are
also keeping an eye on what comes from a round of domestic fare
increases that were announced recently by Pan Am and Alaska Air
Group.
   Since the Persian Gulf crisis began, the price airlines pay for
jet fuel has shot up some 40 percent, from around 60 cents per
gallon to between 80 and 90 cents per gallon.
   That rise puts the sluggish airline industry in a bind. If crude
oil maintains its current high price, airlines can expect to pay an
additional $4.5 billion per year for fuel, according to an industry
group, the Air Transport Association.
   Finding a way to pay for more expensive fuel is not easy. Any
airline that goes out on a limb by raising fares runs the risk of
losing business in the highly competitive market.
   Last month, the major U.S. carriers said they would raise their
domestic fares by 5.3 percent in response to the inflated cost of
jet fuel, but analysts and industry sources said the higher fares
would not pick up the entire increase in the industry's jet fuel
tab.
   Two airlines then decided they would charge fliers more money on
domestic flights.
   Alaska Air announced an additional 4.7 percent fare increase, to
take effect Oct. 1, and Pan Am announced an additional 4.4 percent
fare increase, to take effect Sept. 18.
   Neidl said Alaska Air can probably pull off its increase,
because it is a regional carrier that serves some Alaska
destinations that other airlines cannot reach. He found Pan Am's
move intriguing.
   ``Pan Am is never going to get away with that if other airlines
don't match it,'' Neidl said Monday. ``They're going to have a hard
time holding that because they're going to lose traffic.''
   Domestically, Pan Am is too small to be a price leader, he said.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Elizabeth Hlinko would not say whether her
carrier is concerned about scaring off travelers.
   ``This is something we're monitoring,'' Ms. Hlinko said. ``At
this point, we're planning on putting it (the increase) into
effect.''
   Other airlines said Monday they were watching Pan Am's move, but
none would say whether it was considering a similar increase.
   ``Before we would strongly consider a fare increase, we would
have to see jet fuel costs remain high,'' Northwest spokesman Doug
Miller said. ``We certainly don't want to raise fares. You always
run the risk of inhibiting traffic.''
   Neidl viewed the cheaper fares to Europe as a temporary
marketing strategy that airlines often use in an attempt to lure
``discretionary travelers,'' non-business passengers who might
decide on a relatively short notice to take an overseas vacation.
   ``This happens all the time during the slow seasons,'' he said.
``You don't want to fill up all your seats that way.''
   After Oct. 1, international flights might start costing more.
The International Air Transport Association recently agreed to fare
increases of 5 percent to 8 percent that are still being processed
by various governments.
   Some U.S. airlines plan to go along with those increases, while
others were not yet ready to say what they will do.

<HEAD>Federal Money Minders Split Over Capital Requirements</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal bank regulators say they are still
at odds over the amount of capital that banks should maintain to
avoid a savings and loan-like debacle in the banking industry.
   In testimony before a Senate panel Monday, the Controller of the
Currency and the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said
their dispute has narrowed since January but they still disagree
firmly on lowering the capital standards for all banks.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman said a drop in federal
requirements so that banks must maintain capital standards of at
least 3 percent of assets should be limited to only the healthiest
of the nation's 12,400 banks.
   But Controller of the Currency Robert L. Clarke thinks raising
the standard any higher would supercede plans to make a risk-based
capital standard the primary focus for evaluating the adequacy of a
bank's capital.
   By the end of this year, all banks and thrifts will be required
to have 7.25 percent capital to risk-adjusted assets. That ratio
will grow to 8 percent by the end of 1992.
   Seidman told the Senate Banking Committee that he and Clarke
``agree on many more things than we disagree on'' but ``I don't
think we can continue with these differences without causing real
harm to the system.''
   Capital is the basic yardstick for measuring a financial
institution's soundness. The more capital a bank has, the more
losses it can absorb without failing, conversely the less capital,
the more likely losses could force a failure.
   Legislation passed by Congress last year set minimum capital
standards for savings and loans, but there is no minimum set by law
for the amount of cash and assets easily converted into cash banks
must have to offset the risk of loans and investments.
   Currently the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC and the Office of
the Controller of the Currency have a gentleman's agreement that
banks must maintain a leverage ratio _ capital to total assets _ of
6 percent.
   The Fed has adopted new standards, effective Dec. 31, that would
require the most highly-rated banks to have at least a 3 percent
ratio of capital to total assets, with other banks required to have
another 1 percent or 2 percent in capital.
   Seidman said he was willing to go along with that as a
compromise although the FDIC chairman preferred the ratio up around
4.5 percent.
   But the OCC, which oversees some 4,000 national banks around the
country, wants to set the requirement at 3 percent for all banks.
   Seidman said that was too low and would reduce the capital
requirements of some 10,000 banks.
   ``There are three lines of defense in keeping industry losses to
a minimum and avoiding a taxpayer bailout,'' Sen. Donald W. Riegle
Jr., D-Mich., the committee chairman, said at the hearing's start.
   The first is careful lending practices at banks and thrifts, he
said. The second is the capital maintained by financial
institutions and the third is the federal deposit insurance fund.
   Asked by Riegle if the agencies could settle their differences,
Controller of the Currency Robert Clarke said ``the differences are
extremely minimal.''
   But Seidman shook his head during Clarke's answer.
   ``This disagreement may sound like regulators splitting hairs, 3
percent and 4.5 percent. There's only a 1.5 percent difference but
it is a very material difference when one looks at the banking
system,'' insisted Seidman.
   At 3 percent, he said, substantially all smaller banks would
have a lower minimum standard, eliminating a check on financial
institutions with potential exposure to interest rate risks.
   Riegle asked Seidman and Clarke, who were joined at the hearing
by Fed Governor Wayne D. Angell and Timothy Ryan, director of the
Office of Thrift Supervision, to try and work out their differences
and report back to him in 30 days.

<HEAD>Government Sentencing Report Expected To Include Unproven Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Milken, who pleaded guilty to six
felonies to settle securities fraud charges, is expected to face a
slew of new allegations the government hopes will induce a judge to
stiffen his prison sentence.
   The government agreed not to indict Milken for any other
financial crimes when it accepted his guilty plea in April. But
federal courts have allowed prosecutors to air a range of charges
at sentencing that a defendant hasn't been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to.
   Milken, the former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s
high-yield bond department, admitted six felonies and agreed to pay
$600 million in penalties to settle a 98-count fraud and
racketeering indictment.
   Attorneys said Monday the government will detail a host of other
unproven crimes before U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood as she
prepares to sentence Milken Oct. 1.
   Wood could refuse to consider any new charges outright _ as
happened in a case before another judge this year. Or she could
scheduled a hearing on the claims that might include testimony by
admitted inside trader Ivan Boesky.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said the government was to
present its report to Wood on Thursday. He declined to comment on
the contents, but stressed the government's right to go beyond
Milken's guilty plea.
   Under the plea agreement signed by Milken, the government can
``bring to the court's attention'' conduct that was not included in
the plea. Milken also agreed not to dispute making the government's
final sentencing report public.
   The Justice Department agreed not to request a specific
sentence. Milken faces a maximum 28 years in prison. The charges to
which he pleaded guilty were not among the most serious in the
indictment.
   Milken is entitled to rebut any charges the government may make
in its sentencing report and can defend himself at a hearing, which
either side can ask the judge to hold.
   Attorneys for former Milken associates who cooperated with the
government's nearly four-year investigation said they had been told
that prosecutors planned to bring their full case against Milken to
Wood's attention.
   ``We've gotten wind of such a hearing,'' said Aubrey Harwell
Jr., who represents former Drexel bond salesman Cary Maultasch.
``We understand the government is contemplating . . . calling
numerous witnesses.''
   A spokesman for Milken declined to comment.
   Such hearings, which can include evidence, testimony and
cross-examination as at a trial, are rare. Attorneys said a Milken
hearing could last up to three months and feature testimony by
Boesky, who served two years in prison after settling insider
trading charges. Boesky was Milken's chief accuser.
   Earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Pierre N. Leval refused
to admit charges that former Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. arbitrager Robert
M. Freeman committed 20 crimes in addition to a single charge of
insider trading he admitted.
   ``The government, of course, had the opportunity to charge the
defendant with those 20 crimes. Instead it made a plea bargain with
the defendant agreeing . . . to prosecute this single charge,'' he
wrote.
   But Leval added that it was not necessarily improper for the
government to point to other offenses adding to its call for a
hefty sentence. The Milken case may qualify because of its scope
and the wide public attention it has generated.
   Attorneys said no matter how devastating the new charges, Milken
would be unlikely to request a public hearing because testimony
could add to the hundreds of pending civil lawsuits stemming from
his crimes.
   The sentencing report is ``less damaging than having all the
evidence laid out,'' said one attorney who asked not to be named.
``It provides a road map to civil plaintiffs. It doesn't give it to
them on a silver platter.''
   The rationale for allowing unindicted criminal allegations is
that a judge should consider negative information at sentencing as
well as positive information, such as letters from friends.
   A federal appeals court in 1980 endorsed the practice in an
organized crime case. The decision was upheld by the Supreme Court,
even though many lawyers maintain it's unfair to defendants.
   ``Since when in this country can you go to jail for things a
jury hasn't found you guilty of at a hearing where hearsay is
admissible and by a standard that is less than proof beyond a
reasonable doubt?'' asked Gerald Lefcourt, attorney for former
Drexel trader Bruce Newberg, who was indicted along with Milken
last year and convicted in a separate case.

<HEAD>Most Non-Economic Issues Wrapped Up Between UAW and GM</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most non-economic national contract issues have
been wrapped up by United Auto Workers union and General Motors
Corp. negotiators, leaving tough issues for the last four days of
bargaining.
   A UAW source, speaking Monday on the condition of anonymity,
said tentative agreements have been reached on nearly all
non-economic issues facing bargainers working against a midnight
Friday deadline.
   ``There's not too much left,'' he said.
   Bargaining continued over the most important issue _ job
security. Negotiators are making progress, but the source declined
to give details.
   While most issues have economic considerations, non-economic
issues typically include military leave, legal assistance and union
dues checkoff. Frequently, negotiators strive to resolve
non-economic issues early so they can concentrate on the tougher
economic points, including job security, wages and benefits, time
off and pension matters.
   UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich said last Thursday that about
half of the non-economic issues had been resolved, and the pace of
negotiations at that point was faster than he has seen in any set
of talks.
   UAW national contracts with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp. expire at midnight Friday. The union is focusing bargaining
at GM, which has about 300,000 UAW-covered employees.
   The union has said that after a contract is ratified at the
world's largest automaker, it will be used as a pattern for
agreements with Ford and Chrysler.
   Negotiations between the union and Ford and Chrysler have been
put on ice since GM was chosen as the UAW's bargaining target late
last month.
   Ford sent home all of its national negotiators last week to
concentrate on local contracts, spokesman Dick Routh said Monday.
There are 79 UAW locals at Ford facilities and four have reached
local agreements, all of which expire Friday like the national
contract, he said.
   At Chrysler, UAW and company negotiators have been meeting
occasionally in subcommittees focused on certain areas of the
contract, such as wages, job security or health and safety. Company
spokesman Lee Sechler said local agreements at about 60 UAW locals
at Chrysler facilities remain unresolved.
   Expiration dates on those agreements vary, but most of the
assembly plant contracts expire Friday.
   The tone of the negotiations between the union and GM has been
quiet. Little public information has leaked out of the fifth-floor
negotiating suite at the GM Building just north of downtown Detroit.

<HEAD>Oil Profits from Gulf Crisis Help Saudis Pay for U.S. Support</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Tuesday AMs report.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Windfall oil profits, the result of
increased production and higher prices, have given Saudi Arabia a
painless way to finance much of the cost of the U.S. military
deployment in the Persian Gulf, industry analysts say.
   An irony of the crisis is that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is
effectively paying for the military might that's been arrayed
against him.
   The crisis triggered by Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait has
pushed oil prices up from around $15 a barrel to as high as $32.
   Prices are higher partly because of the U.N. embargo on Iraqi
and Kuwaiti output, which has taken about 4 million barrels a day
off the market.
   The Saudis and the United Arab Emirates are picking up most of
the slack to replace those 4 million barrels. Saudi Arabia alone
has boosted production from 5.3 million barrels a day to around 7.5
million without incurring any increased production costs.
   Almost all the increased production comes from Saudi Aramco, the
Saudi government-owned refining and exporting corporation in which
the major American oil companies once had a share.
   But U.S. and Saudi officials said Aramco easily increased its
production without spending a dime.
   ``It still costs only $1, $1.25 to get a barrel of oil out of
the ground. Beyond 7.5 million barrels a day they incur extra
costs,'' said an American official who spoke on condition he was
not identified.
   The result is a windfall estimated at $100 million a day, more
than enough to pay part of the cost of keeping foreign troops on
Saudi soil to protect King Fahd's throne.
   Saudi officials have refused to say how much they will
contribute to the U.S. operation. But one said: ``Americans won't
be disappointed in what Saudi Arabia's willing to do.''
   The ease with which Saudi Aramco boosted production was
underscored by the American official, who said: ``They did it on
short notice without an increase in marginal cost.''
   Furthermore, Nassr Ajmi, Aramco's executive vice president, said
the corporation could keep up production levels of 7.5 million
barrels a day indefinitely without incurring higher costs.
   ``Higher prices will be good in the short run,'' said Prince
Abdullah bin Faisal, head of the royal commission for the
industrial port cities of Jubail on the Gulf and Yanbu on the Red
Sea coast.
   If, however, Saudi Arabia wants to produce even more oil _ it
has the largest reserves in the world _ it must pay to do so.
   Officials say Saudi Aramco's plans to increase its sustainable
capacity to 10 million barrels a day would involve substantial new
investment in plant and equipment.
   Estimates are that Aramco plans to spend $10 billion to $14
billion on its expansion.
   Another variable for Aramco is personnel. About 3,000 Americans
are employed by the corporation, many in key techological and
management jobs.
   More than 13,000 other foreigners, mainly Asians on contract
work, are employed by the oil giant. The Saudis make up the
remainder of 50,000-strong workforce.
   There have been reports of widespread resignations since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. But Aramco officials said only 27 Americans
have quit recently.
   Saudis and American businessmen both say that in boom times,
filling even key jobs, is not a problem. But it may cost money in
the form of higher salaries and more incentives.
   ``In a time of crisis one can buy expatriates,'' said Dr. Bakr
Abdullah Bakr, rector of the King Fahd University of Petroleum and
Minerals.

<HEAD>Feds Block $3 Billion Sale of `Junk' Bonds to Investor Group</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have blocked Columbia
Savings &amp; Loan from selling $3 billion of its junk bonds to a group
of Canadian and Hong Kong investors.
   Regulators said Monday that the troubled thrift failed to seek
any all-cash bids. Columbia chief Edward G. Harshfield said in a
brief statement that the thrift obtained ``the most favorable bid.''
   The Office of Thrift Supervision also said it could not approve
the sale in its current form, because the troubled thrift neglected
to seek an adequate number of bids for the junk bond portfolio.
   Columbia at one time had the thrift industry's largest portfolio
of high-yield, high-risk junk bonds. The thrift is based in Beverly
Hills.
   The Los Angeles Times, in today's editions, quoted unidentified
sources as saying L. William Seidman would support a cash deal in
which Columbia gets rid of the junk bonds for good.
   Seidman chairs the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the
Resolution Trust Corp., the agency formed last year to handle
failing thrifts.
   Regulators have held off seizing Columbia while its managers
tried to find a buyer for the junk bonds, despite the fact that the
thrift is insolvent.
   Columbia was $350 million in the red according to the latest
report, largely due to the declining value of the junk bond
portfolio but also because of recent real estate losses.
   In late July, Columbia agreed to sell the bonds for $3 billion
to a partnership assembled by Gordon Investment Corp., a merchant
bank based in New York and Toronto. A principal of Gordon
Investment is Hong Kong billionaire entrepreneur Li Ka-shing, who
could not be reached for comment.
   Under the proposed deal, Gordon America LP would have paid $300
million down and given Columbia a 10-year note for the remaining
$2.7 billion at an interest rate of 10.5 percent.
   If the value of the bonds fell 10 percent below the purchase
price, the buyers could have walked away from the deal, losing
their down payment but avoiding further losses.
   In that case, the junk bonds would have wound up back in the
hands of Columbia _ and, if the thrift were seized _ of the
taxpayers.
   In its announcement, the OTS said the proposed 10-year
non-recourse note for 90 percent of the purchase price raised ``a
significant legal issue'' under the S&amp;L bailout legislation enacted
last year.
   ``I hope additional bids ... will result in a proposal that we
can quickly approve,'' OTS Director Timothy Ryan said in a
statement. ``We appreciate the manner in which the current
management of Columbia ... has dealt with this and other problems
inherited from the Thomas Spiegel era.''
   Spiegel, the former chief executive officer of Columbia, has
been accused by the regulators of breaching his duty to Columbia's
shareholders and showing a ``reckless disregard'' for the law that
resulted in excessive personal enrichment. Spiegel has denied the
allegations.
   The OTS announced last Thursday that it had added a new
allegation against Spiegel, who had earlier been accused of
squandering $19 million.
   The agency now accuses Spiegel of causing a $29.2 million loss
to Columbia from the construction of a new headquarters building
``without any attempt to limit costs.'' The new building included a
large multi-level gymnasium and ``survival chamber'' bathrooms with
bullet-proof glass and an independent air and food supply, the OTS
said.
   Spiegel, who feared a terrorist attack, also has been accused of
spending at least $91,000 of Columbia's funds to buy an assortment
of about 80 guns.
   Columbia, which is trying to sell the building, has removed the
gymnasium and the elaborate bathrooms. The building cost Columbia
more than $54.7 million and has a market value of around $24
million, according to the OTS.
   The new charge put Spiegel at the top of the list of S&amp;L

followed by Charles Keating Jr., the former head of the collapsed

<HEAD>Swiss Bank To Guarantee Portion of City Loan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Swiss bank will guarantee part of the $375
million Philadelphia is seeking, making it the first institution to
risk helping the financially troubled city.
   Swiss Bank Corp. will back $50 million of the temporary loan
notes the administration is trying to sell to raise cash, The
Philadelphia Inquirer reported today.
   City officials and a financial team headed by Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets were trying to persuade at least two other banks to
guarantee additional notes.
   John Chamales, Swiss Bank first vice president, said the bank
was prepared to issue a letter of credit for as much as $225
million if other banks subcontract for the other $175 million and
assume some of the risk, the newspaper reported.
   Quoting unnamed sources, The Inquirer said city leaders are
talking with Union Bank of Switzerland and National Westminister
Bank of London about joining Swiss Bank.
   The administration of Mayor W. Wilson Goode has said the city
will be out of cash by late this month unless it receives a cash
infusion. The notes would be repaid from property and business tax
receipts expected early next year.
   Even with the temporary notes, the city projects a $206.4
million deficit in the $2.1 billion general fund budget by June 30,
1991.

<HEAD>Mercedes Continuing to Pay Fuel Penalties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GROSSE POINTE SHORES, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatively stable car sales
will force Mercedes-Benz to pay more than $18 million in
fuel-consumption penalties next year, company executives say.
   ``If you build large automobiles, as Mercedes-Benz does, it will
be very difficult for anybody to deal with it,'' Albert Weiss,
general marketing manager for Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc.,
said Monday of potentially higher fuel-economy standards.
   Congress is considering a bill that would boost the corporate
average fuel economy standard by 20 percent in 1995 and by 40
percent in 2001. That would push the current 27.5 miles per gallon
standard to around 40 mpg by the end of the century.
   Companies selling cars in the United States must pay a penalty
if the average fuel economy rating for those cars doesn't meet
certain standards. A gas-guzzler tax may also be imposed on the
company's least efficient models.
   ``You're not going to have a 4,000-pound car with 40 miles per
gallon and have performance,'' Weiss said.
   Mercedes-Benz's corporate average fuel economy in 1990 is 21.2
mpg, which forced the company to pay about $18.6 million in
fuel-economy penalties for this year, said Peter Patrone, the
company's product planning manager. In 1989, the company paid $20.4
million for an average fuel economy of 21.4 mpg.
   The decrease in penalty and average fuel economy stemmed from a
0.9 percent drop in sales of Mercedes cars between the two years,
Patrone and Weiss said. Through the first eight months of 1990,
Mercedes has sold 48,029 cars.
   Company officials don't expect the 1991 penalty to differ much
from 1990 because sales and fuel efficiency should be relatively
the same.
   Comments by Weiss and Patrone came as the company introduced its
18-car lineup of 1991 models. Half of those vehicles will be
assessed a gas-guzzler tax ranging from $500 to $1,300, depending
on the vehicle.
   Without the gas-guzzler taxes, base prices for 1991-model cars
range from $28,050 for the 190E with a 2.3-liter, four-cylinder
engine and a manual transmission, to $89,300 for the 500SL with a
5-liter V-8 engine and an automatic transmission.
   The two SL coupes, the 300SL with a 3-liter engine and the
500SL, were redesigned for the 1990 model year. Weiss and Patrone
said company officials were surprised at the popularity of the
500SL version, despite its higher price tag and lower, 16-mpg
average.
   About 75 percent of the car models sold last year were the
500SL, they said.
   That indicates that buyers of Mercedes cars aren't worried as
much about the fuel efficiency of their automobiles. Since Iraq
invaded Kuwait nearly six weeks ago, Mercedes dealers haven't
reported any slowdown in sales, Weiss said.
   ``The cost of fuel doesn't seem to be a problem at this time,''
he said. For the 1990 model year, Mercedes expanded availability of
diesel engines, which are more fuel-efficient than same-size
gasoline engines.
   For 1991, the company will offer three cars with turbocharged
diesel engines in the United States, except for California. The
diesel-powered cars flunk stringent California emissions standards.
   One diesel car, the 350SD Turbo, is new for 1991. The 190E 2.3
is the only other new car the company is introducing for the 1991
model year.
   Mercedes is offering two new kinds of traction control devices
for its 1991-model cars.

<HEAD>Chileans Charge U.S. Officials Contaminated Grapes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: This was included in PM-Washington in Brief on general news

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Chilean Exporters Association is accusing
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of contaminating two Chilean
grapes with cyanide and setting off a public health scare in March
1989.
   A report issued by the association in Washington and Santiago,
Chile, concluded that, based on scientific studies, the grapes
could not have been tampered with in Chile or at the port of
Philadelphia where the poisoned grapes were found.
   ``The grapes were contaminated at the FDA laboratory in
Philadelphia,'' the report said. ``The manner in which the
contamination took place could have been accidental or
intentional.''
   FDA officials have said repeatedly that they believe the grapes
were poisoned in Chile before the ship left on its two-week voyage
to the United States.
   Of the report's conclusion, FDA spokesman Bill Grigg said: ``We
think that's preposterous.''
   The FDA went looking for the grapes after the U.S. Embassy in
Santiago received an anonymous telephone threat March 2, 1989.
After it found the two tainted grapes, the FDA urged that all
Chilean fruit be removed from U.S. markets while more tests
continued.
   The association estimated the FDA's action cost the Chileans
more than $330 million as more than 6 million cases of fruit in the
United States were destroyed.
   The association said research at the University of California at
Davis showed that if the two grapes had been contaminated with
cyanide, other grapes in the same case also would have contained
the poison. However, none was found, the FDA has said.
   The studies also showed that because cyanide was found at such
high levels, it would have to have been introduced in the grapes
more recently than two weeks before, when the ship was in Chile,
the report said.

   Norway's daily crude oil flows averaged
1.428 million barrels in July, the month before Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait, down 7.9 percent from a year earlier and 9.8 percent from
the previous month, according to official figures released Tuesday.
   The latest production results compared with 1.550 million
barrels in July 1989 and 1.584 million barrels in June 1990.
   The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate said total offshore
petroleum production in July was 7.7 million tons, down from 8.3
million tons reported in June. July production was divided into 5.9
million tons of oil, 1.6 million tons of natural gas and 200,000
tons of condensate, it said in a news release.
   Norway's North Sea fields produced a total of 60.7 million tons
of oil equivalent during the first seven months of 1990, compared
to 59.7 million tons reported for the same period of 1989, it said.

<TEXT>
   Pizza Hut opened its first two Soviet restaurants
today, dishing out American-style fast food to wide-eyed customers
as perplexed by their spanking clean surroundings as by the menu.
   ``It looks like a museum,'' said sailor Yevgeni Gerko, one of
about 300 Soviets who waited in line for up to four hours for the
official opening.
   ``We want to know the American style of eating,'' he said,
gazing through the window at Pizza Hut's restaurant along
Kutuzovsky Prospekt, on which President Mikhail S. Gorbachev drives
to work.
   The second, smaller, restaurant is on Gorky Street, a main
thoroughfare near the Kremlin that already boasts the only Estee
Lauder and Christian Dior outlets in the country.
   Just after noon, a large, deep pan Super Supreme pizza with
everything on it came out of the Kutuzovsky restaurant's oven, the
first of 5,000 it expects to serve daily.
   Waiting customers, clutching Pizza Hut flags emblazoned with
American and Soviet symbols, oohed and aahed, then tried to rush
the door. Pizza Hut officials struggled to limit entrance to a
handful of people at a time.
   Pizza Hut is selling its meals for both dollars and rubles. The
menu is similar to those in the West, except only nine pizza
combinations are offered and no substitutions are permitted. A
special Moscow Seafood pizza topped with salmon, smoked sardines
and onions was created to appeal to Soviet tastes.
   ``People don't know what the products are,'' explained regional
operations director Andy Rafalet. ``Let's make the choice a little
easier.''
   Choice was easy at the salad bar: no lettuce, but lots of
cabbage, a Soviet staple.
   The Kutuzovksy site, near a large foreigners' compound, has
separate dining rooms for ruble- and dollar-paying customers, plus
a takeout counter. Gorky Street has a window selling pizza slices
for rubles.
   The restaurants' 300 Soviet employees were chosen from 3,500
applicants. Rafalet said most will earn 300 rubles ($480) a month,
slightly higher than the average monthly salary of 250 rubles
($400).
   Pizza Hut's parent company, PepsiCo Inc. of Purchase, N.Y., has
been doing business with the Soviets for more than 30 years, since
chief executive Donald Kendall cajoled then-Premier Nikita
Khrushchev into tasting Pepsi at a 1959 Moscow trade fair.
   Three years ago, the Moscow City Council invited PepsiCo to
bring its family-oriented restaurants to the Soviet capital. The
city has a 51 percent stake in the joint venture which owns the two
restaurants.
   ``We hope to revolutionize the food and restaurant industry,''
Kendall told an opening ceremony.
   ``My 30 years in dealing with the Soviets has taught me that
while initial negotiations can be long and sometimes frustrating,
that once you sign an agreement and open your business, the Soviets
are equal to any partner in the entire world.''
   Pizza Hut originally announced it would open its Moscow
restauarants in September 1989, but construction did not begin
until January.
   Pizza Hut says the four ovens in its bigger restaurant can
produce 5,000 pizzas daily, and it expects to serve 50,000
customers a week, about seven times the turnover of any Pizza Hut
in the United States.
   McDonald's Moscow outlet still sells 5,000 burgers an hour and
the lunchtime lineup is 90 minutes long.
   The restaurants are part of a $3 billion deal in which the
Soviets will build at least 10 ships, mostly oil tankers, for
PepsiCo to sell or lease, and PepsiCo's exclusive right to market
Stolichnaya vodka in the United States was extended to the year
2000.
   In return, PepsiCo agreed to double its soft drink production in
the Soviet Union.

   Stock prices were mostly lower in early trading
today as the market remained concerned about rising oil prices and
the Iraqi standoff, analysts said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was down 7.67
points to 2,607.92 as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancing ones in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
396 up, 481 down and 496 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to a light 14.81 million shares as
of 10 a.m. EDT.
   Trading volume remains thin as investors seem inclined to stay
out of the market while the Mideast situation remains unresolved,
analysts say.
   Analysts say stock investors remain concerned about the
troubling rise in oil prices. On Monday, stock prices tracked the
decline and later rise in crude prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the October contract for
crude oil rose $1.26 Monday to close at $31.30 a barrel.
   The stock market received no help from abroad today. In Japan,
the key Nikkei Stock Average fell 476.24 points, or 1.9 percent,

<HEAD>Reports Say Hearst in Talks to Buy RJR Nabisco's ESPN Stake</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hearst Corp. may buy the 20 percent stake
that RJR Nabisco Inc. holds in the ESPN sports cable television
network, published reports said Tuesday.
   RJR Nabisco has been exploring its options on its ESPN interest
for more than a year. The remaining 80 percent of the cable service
is owned by Capital Cities-ABC Inc., the company that owns and
operates the ABC Television Network.
   The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times each reported
Tuesday that Hearst and RJR Nabisco were in talks with Hearst about
selling the stake.
   Although no agreement has been reached, the Journal story said
people familiar with the discussions said Hearst may pay $180
million to $200 million for the stake, or below the $250 million
that it said RJR Nabisco had hoped to get.
   Officials for Hearst, RJR and Capital Cities-ABC all declined
comment.
   ESPN is one of the largest cable networks, available to about 61
percent of U.S. households with television. It had a pretax profit
of about $125 million last year but expects lower results this year
because of losses on its coverage of major league baseball.
   RJR Nabisco has reportedly had trouble finding a buyer for its
interest because its stake gives it no management authority over
the service and no guarantee of a dividend.
   RJR Nabisco said in August 1989 that it had hired the investment
firm Lazard Freres &amp; Co. to advise it on its ESPN stake, saying
several parties had expressed interest in it but that it had not
decided what to do with it.
   The company took that step after being acquired for $24.5
billion in April 1989 by a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp;
Co.
   Hearst, which owns magazines and newspapers, already has ties to
Capital Cities-ABC. It owns several ABC-affiliated television
stations and is a partner with Capital Cities-ABC in the Lifetime
and Arts &amp; Entertainment cable networks.

<HEAD>Group Promotes Franchising, Sets Sights On Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   By his own estimate, Arthur Karp has devoted only
30 days this year to running his chocolate-chip cookie business. He
says he has a more pressing mission: to sell the world on the
concept of franchising.
   As chairman of the International Franchise Association, Karp
spends most of his time leading business groups on international
trade missions.
   The opportunities have been plentiful since the dearth of
communism in Eastern Europe, Karp said. The new democracies are
hungry for Western-style products and government officials have
been bending over backwards to allow U.S. franchises, he said.
   ``There are opportunities there for people of vision that are
just laying around on the street,'' Karp said in a recent interview
at the Atlanta offices of his franchised Great American Chocolate
Chip Cookie Co.
   ``In the future, when they talk about the `good old days,'
they're going to be talking about the 1990s.''
   IFA's push in Eastern Europe comes on the heels of a decade of
sharp growth in franchising in the United States.
   Domestic franchises are expected to account for $716 billion in
retail sales in 1990 _ a third of the nation's total retail sales,
according to IFA. That's more than quadruple the $160 billion in
sales from franchises during 1983, the Washington-based group said.
   The number of franchises is expected to grow to 533,000
establishments this year, up from 442,400 in 1980, IFA said. It
said a rash of gasoline station shutdowns in the early 1980s had
offet the establishment of new franchises, but the total number of
franchises has risen steadily since 1984.
   Under a franchise agreement, a company grants a franchisee the
right to sell its products or services in a certain area. The
franchiser usually provides business guidance, promotional
assistance, financing and other benefits in exchange for a
percentage of the sales or profits.
   The support system behind the arrangement provides a safety net
for the franchisee that leaves less room for error as a business
develops, Karp said.
   ``You're not reinventing the wheel,'' he said. ``We (the
franchiser) have probably run into the problem that that individual
is facing 100 times before. And we've learned how to handle it . .
. from marketing to construction to purchasing, to whatever it is.''
   Economist Al Niemi agreed that Eastern Europe presents favorable
opportunities for selling consumer goods, though he cautioned that
those going there in search of a quick buck likely will be
disappointed.
   ``It's going to take longer than some people think,'' said
Niemi, dean of the University of Georgia College of Business
Administration. ``There's a basic infrastructure there that needs
to be rebuilt.''
   Niemi said the demand for consumer goods in the former communist
strongholds is enormous. To suddenly provide a U.S.-style variety
of products, he said, ``would be like going to fantasy land.''
   John Amos, executive director of Dallas-based I Can't Believe
It's Yogurt, said he has made contacts in Eastern Europe from his
participation in IFA trade missions. But he said he believes it
will be a few years before Poles and Romanians are licking yogurt
cones.
   ``I think there are enormous opportunities in the Eastern Bloc
countries, but it will be some time before the logistical system is
in place to support the growth,'' Amos said. ``You can take almost
any commodity there on the back of a semi and sell it. But there
are no systems in place to support distribution.''
   In addition to the Eastern Bloc countries, Karp also has led
trade missions to Australia, Switzerland, France, Spain and Mexico
during his one-year term as head of IFA.
   Karp's role usually involves meeting with government officials
while representatives of the companies seek contacts with local
business leaders. Karp said he has encountered no hostility toward
the importing of U.S. franchises, and dismissed the notion that the
traveling companies would be viewed as moving in to take business
away from local entrepreneurs.
   ``They're not just going in and opening businesses,'' he said.
They're seeking local people.
   ``The McDonald's in Madrid is run by Spaniards. It employs
Spaniards and pays taxes to the government of Spain. The American
concept of retailing is still the best in the world, and we're
exporting that.''

   Lance Lundberg surveys the businesses in his
``portfolio'' much like a card player eyeing his hand.
   There have been cable TV companies in need of broadcasting
equipment; a cruise line that could use some advertising exposure;
and a papermaker with a surplus of baby wipes.
   The companies' needs were skillfully matched through swaps and
trades that Lundberg, a 34-year-old Harvard MBA, arranged under the
age-old system known as bartering.
   Bartering has been around since cave days and continues to be a
method of commerce among corporations of every size worldwide.
According to the Alexandria, Va.-based International Reciprocal
Trade Association, more than 400 ``exchanges'' help an estimated
220,000 businesses _ usually small ones _ trade goods and services.
   But exchanges account for only a fraction of the pie. When
direct swaps among large corporations are considered, industry
experts say barter is responsible for up to $12 billion of domestic
trade a year.
   Lundberg's ICON International puts a new twist on what
traditionally is a quid pro quo transaction. By footing the bill
himself in many cases, Lundberg is leveraged into the transaction,
which makes him more of a financier than just a stockpiler of
surplus goods and services.
   Take, for example, a cable televison channel that needs
broadcasting equipment. ``I purchase it (the equipment), lease it
to them, and over the life of the lease take payment in a stream of
30-second commercial units,'' Lundberg said.
   Since the price of air time has been increasing at an average 30
percent a year, Lundberg is left ``holding a portfolio much like a
portfolio of stocks. I can trade out when I think values have
peaked.''
   By trading out, he means swapping the commercials for, say,
Radisson Hotel rooms. Or, from time to time, Lundberg trades
merchandise for cash, like the baby wipes he sold for James River
Corp. ``You can't endlessly trade, or you won't have money to pay
the light bill,'' he said.
   Much of ICON's success resulted from Lundberg's apt targeting of
once-fledgling cable TV channels like Financial News Network, ESPN
and Arts &amp; Entertainment, which had spare capacity at low cost. The
cable clients ``got at a very early developmental stage cash-free
financing'' while Lundberg cheaply built a foundation from which to
trade.
   Now he's building another base in the travel and accommodation
industry. All inventory is computerized and is periodically
reviewed so values can be reassessed.
   Four years into his venture, Lundberg boasts an impressive
client list, including 3M Corp., James River, the Raddisson hotel
chain, Norwegian Cruise Line, Time Warner Inc. and People magazine.
   ICON began taking shape in 1985, when Lundberg met John Fentener
van Vlissingen, a wealthy Dutch businessman and chief executive of
Holland's Noro Group. Noro helped set up meetings with
``sophisticated, substantial individuals,'' as Lundberg refers to
them, so he could pitch his idea.
   Within six months, 60 European investors had anted up $60,000
each for a piece of a mutual fund; another $500,000 was raised
through a separate pool of U.S. investors.
   Lundberg was somewhat surprised at the interest in his new
venture. ``Selling a new idea is sometimes easier than selling an
operating business,'' he said. ``You're really enthusiastic _
you're in there selling sizzle. When you get going, you're selling
steak, and there's a big difference.''
   Today, ICON is a $20-plus million company growing at an annual
rate of 60 percent. Lundberg now employes a staff of 25 at a
midtown Manhattan office so new that the company's name has not yet
been stenciled on the front doors. Annual returns have been
``volatile, but never negative'' and have averaged 16 percent a
year, he said.
   Born in Amherst, Mass., Lundberg studied English and
administrative sciences at Yale University before moving on to
Harvard University. He left the consulting firm Booz Allen &amp;
Hamilton to found a company that oversaw a network of cash
machines. ``I can't say it was a success, but we preserved our
investors' capital and learned a lot,'' he said.
   So far, the boyish Lundberg has received high marks from
clients. Daniel Infanti, a spokesman at Sharp Electronics Corp. in
Mahwah, N.J., said his company has dealt exclusively with Lundberg
in a handful of deals involving laptop computers, fax supplies and
other office goods valued anywhere from $100,000 to more than $1
million.
   ``The use of barter helps us in times when we have distressed
merchandise,'' Infanti said. ``It gives us a good outlet for
products that become outdated in a very short period of time.''
   But Infanti said that generally ``barter is the type of business
relationship that makes most manufacturers uneasy. There is very
high turnover in the (barter) companies, and you don't always get
what you think you're getting.''
   Jeff Stutin, director of marketing services for Norwegian Cruise
Line in Coral Gables, Fla., echoed that sentiment. With some barter
companies, ``you'll end up with things you weren't exactly
expecting _ like prices of TV spots that were double what they
normally would be,'' he said.
   Lundberg said the large capital base he started with ``made it a
lot eaiser to deliver'' quality goods. And unlike many traditional
barter exchanges, he doesn't do most of his business in distressed
merchandise.
   By the end of the year, Lundberg will decide whether to open a
European office, which also could begin by targeting emerging cable
TV networks.
   He said a handful of major companies have expressed an interest
in acquiring ICON, and he's not necessarily adverse to the notion.
But he's keeping mum on what he wants in exchange for his company.

   Gov. Bob Martinez today asked state
agencies to cut their budgets 5 percent in the wake of gloomy
economic forecasts projecting a more than $500 million shortfall in
tax collections.
   ``Obviously now the budget was adopted based on a forecast that
isn't living up to its billing and we're going to have to make that
change,'' Martinez said. ``It's never easy to do, but it's the only
responsible thing to do.''
   The governor and the state's elected Cabinet members will likely
make the actual reductions, which could include layoffs and service
cuts, at their Sept. 25 meeting after the agencies report back with
recommendations, sasid state Budget Director Patti Woodworth.
   State economists Monday night came up with a new tax collection
forecast for the fiscal year that began July 1 showing a reduction
of $521.8 million from the estimate made in the spring.
   That amount would be cut from the $11.4 billion in general state
revenues that fuel the $27.4 billion budget.
   When July collections came in $48.8 million below projections,
the governor and Cabinet imposed a freeze on hiring, purchases and
some travel. The new cuts are likely to go much further.
   Woodworth said she couldn't predict whether agencies would have
to lay off workers but that some services would have to be pared.
   ``We've got to take a look at our priorities and see what we
need to fund and what we can put off until next year,'' she said.
``I think some services are going to be affected.''
   The Legislature approved some $1.5 billion in new taxes during
the spring session, but it wasn't enough to make up for the lagging
collections in existing taxes.
   The major culprit is the sales tax, which will come in some $300
million below the original projection.

   Oil prices fell this morning as traders realized
there was no truth to the Mideast rumors that pushed crude futures
contracts into a late afternoon surge on Monday.
   Light sweet crude dropped 60 cents to $30.70 per barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange in late morning trading of October
contracts.
   ``The main reason was that Europe traded down, because they
realized the rumor wasn't true. That was the one on Jordan,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Oil prices had shot up late Monday on a rumor that Iraq had
moved troops into Jordan. The markets had also been moved by
unfounded rumors that Saudi Arabian oil facilities had been
attacked and that shots had been fired in the Persian Gulf standoff.
   Unleaded gasoline and home heating oil futures were down for
October contracts this morning, while natural gas was unchanged.
   Gasoline fell 1.07 cents to 93.65 cents per gallon, while
heating oil fell 1.59 cents to 84.30 cents per gallon. Natural gas
was unchanged at $1.525 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   Futures contracts for later months were mixed.

   Soybean and corn futures prices rose modestly
this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade after the Agriculture
Department reported further deterioration last week in the
condition of those crops.
   Wheat and oat futures were narrowly mixed in early tradeing.
   The USDA said Monday in its weekly crop-progress report that 52
percent of the soybean crop was in good to excellent condition as
of Sunday compared with 58 percent a week earlier.
   Dry weather has placed stress on soybean plants in the Southeast
and Mississippi Delta regions, although current rainy conditions
are believed to be easing those problems.
   In the corn fields, the USDA rated 76 percent of the crop good
to excellent compared with 79 percent a week ago.
   A National Weather Service forecast for cool, dry weather in the
Midwest during the first half of next week was also supportive,
analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to \ cent

   The U.S.-Japanese relationship, which has been
strained in recent years because of a huge trade imbalance, could
be headed for more bumps in the road over the issue of support for
the campaign against Iraq.
   Members of Congress were using strong words such as ``greedy''
and ``contemptible'' to described their feelings Monday about
Japan's failure to be more generous in response to President Bush's
request for the allies to bear a greater share of the burden in the
Persian Gulf crisis.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady met with Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu last Friday to ask that Japan more than
double the $1 billion contribution it has proposed making to
support the Persian Gulf effort.
   Brady, however, left Tokyo without any commitments for increased
aid.
   ``They are acting totally within the character that they usually
do. They are motivated by profit, greed and avarice,'' said Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. ``Theirs is an attitude that I think really
is repugnant.''
   To express displeasure with the level of support, the Senate on
Monday adopted a resolution threatening a deterioration in U.S.
relations with any nation that doesn't contribute enough.
   In Tokyo today, a Japanese official said Japan was considering
giving $2 billion to the three nations hardest hit by the economic
sanctions against Iraq. That would be on top of $1 billion the
country has already pledged to support the military effort against
Iraq.
   Hiroyasu Horio, an official of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry, said the $2 billion would go to Egypt, Jordan
and Turkey. News reports in Tokyo said the money would be extended
through the World Bank and International Monetary Fund with the
first $600 million being sent as early as mid-September.
   The Senate resolution, attached to a spending bill for the
Postal Service and other agencies, directed the president to
present Congress a detailed report on the administration's
cost-sharing efforts by Nov. 30.
   ``During his consultations with other international leaders,''
Bush ``should consider stressing ... that failure by any country to
actively contribute in the most appropriate manner for that country
could have a detrimental impact on its bilateral relationship with
the United States,'' the resolution said.
   The approval of the measure, the first such congressional action
since Bush ordered U.S. troops to Saudi Arabia, reflected
lawmakers' reaction to complaints by voters that the United States
is shouldering too much of the burden.
   The United States ``cannot play Uncle Sugar to the world,'' said
Sen. Dennis Deconcini, D-Ariz., one of the primary sponsors.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., called Japan's $1 billion pledge only
a ``few token shillings.'' He contended that a more adequate
response, given Japan's economic standing, would be an $8 billion
pledge.
   ``The contemptible tokenism of the actions of the Japanese
government to date merit nothing but the world's contempt and
American hostility,'' McCain said. ``If combat arises, it will not
be Japanese boys whose lives are at risk, it will be American
boys.''
   Japan, which ran up a $49 billion trade surplus with the United
States last year, was singled out for the bulk of the criticism.
But senators said they also were unhappy with the response so far
by West Germany, which has agreed to supply air and sea transport
but turned down a U.S. request for more help in defraying the costs
of keeping troops in the Persian Gulf.
   West Germany and Japan both contend that their post-World War II
constitutions bar them from sending troops to the Persian Gulf.
   The United States is seeking approximately $28 billion through
the end of 1991 for the gulf campaign. Of that amount, $10 billion
would go to supply aid to Egypt, Turkey and Jordan and the
remainder would pay for the U.S. military buildup.
   While Brady had little luck getting much more than words of
encouragement from France, Britain, South Korea and Japan last
week, Secretary of State James A. Baker III reported more success
on a similar fund-raising mission to oil-rich Middle Eastern
nations.
   Baker said Monday that Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
and the exiled government of Kuwait had pledged $12 billion, split
between the military effort and the economic assistance package.
   But some critics charged that consumers from America and other
countries were in reality footing the bill through higher energy
prices.
   Edwin Rothschild, head of the consumer group Citizen Action,
said the Saudis stood to make an extra $3.2 billion monthly from
the crisis based on a $10-a-barrel rise in oil costs since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait and a 2 million-barrel per day increase in Saudi
production. Their share of the U.S. military costs was reportedly
only $500 million a month.
   The administration has been stressing the need for a united
front against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, something analysts
say is not helped by the lukewarm reception by some allied
countries.

   Cuba and Romania have struck oil deals with
Iraq and companies elsewhere are trying to continue trade with
Baghdad, all in defiance of United Nations sanctions, a State
Department survey finds.
   Some Eastern European countries also are trying to maintain
their military sales to Iraq, said the report, made available to
The Associated Press.
   It said Cuba, facing a substantial oil deficit because of
reduced Soviet deliveries, has received a shipment of Iraqi
petroleum since U.N. sanctions were imposed five weeks ago.
   The report added that Romania expects to receive oil indirectly
from Iraq.
   ``I'm authorized to deny most categorically this allegation,
which is absolutely false and without foundation,'' Virgil
Constantinescu, the Romanian ambassador to the United States, said
today.
   ``Romania has adhered strictly to the U.N. resolution imposing
sanctions against Iraq and is determined to carry out this policy
despite the hardships it faces as a consequence of the embargo and
the blockade.''
   Constantinescu said Iraq had offered to ship about 1 million
metric tons of oil worth $120 million since Aug. 2, and the
Romanian government had rejected it.
   The compilation of efforts to circumvent the embargo was made
available as concern increased that the sanctions might jeopardize
the well being of innocent Iraqis. Shortages of goods are said to
be increasingly widespread.
   At their Helsinki summit, President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev agreed it was appropriate to allow food
shipments to Iraq and occupied Kuwait ``in appropriate
circumstances.''
   But they said any such shipments should be subject to careful
monitoring by appropriate agencies.
   Bush is banking on the sanctions to force Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait.
   The updated State Department study and previous reports strongly
suggest that the willingness to comply with the sanctions is less
than unanimous.
   Before the summit, China and Iran indicated a desire to send
food and medicine to Iraq and several other countries said they
wanted to send humanitarian shipments to their citizens stranded in
Iraq.
   The State Department report indicated that two unidentified
Western European companies have been attempting to ship food
clandestinely to Iraq. Syrian farmers are trying to take advantage
of the country's long border with Iraq for the same purpose, it
said.
   The report added that private entrepreneurs in East Asia and
Africa also were pursuing trade with Iraq.
   Because of the growing political acceptability of selling to
Iraq goods needed for survival, these transactions are regarded as
somewhat less serious than others mentioned in the report.
   The document said some unnamed East European countries are
attempting to continue military trade with Iraq and that several
Western European countries are bidding for a share of the Iraqi
market for manufactured goods.
   Cuba has had friendly ties with Iraq for some time but had
nonetheless refrained from supporting Saddam in the U.N. Security
Council, where it holds one of 10 rotating seats.
   Cuba has either supported the council majority or abstained on
votes applicable to Iraq.
   ``Cuba has taken delivery of Iraqi oil,'' the State Department
report said. Just two weeks ago, Cuba announced drastic energy
conservations measures to compensate for a 2-million-ton shortfall
in deliveries from the Soviet Union.
   Romania's interest in buying Iraqi oil could be related to that
country's concern over the fate of its citizens in Iraq. It has
indicated a desire to send food and medicine to Romanians trapped
in Iraq.

<TEXT>
   The Vancouver Stock Exchange
slumped to a record low Monday following word that a critical
report on the exchange was being prepared by the ABC Television
Network.
   The exchange's index, tied heavily to mining and other resource
development stocks, plunged 12.20 points to 674.20, surpassing the
previous record low of 685.85 on Aug. 23.
   The Vancouver market has been generally soft in recent weeks,
but many analysts blamed the latest decline on nervousness over a
report believed to be set for broadcast on ``PrimeTime Live,''
which has a weekly audience of 10 million to 13 million viewers.
   Exchange officials said last week that ``PrimeTime'' staff,
posing as members of a New York investment club, used a hidden
camera to film three promoters making what were said to be false
claims and leaking insider information.
   A promoter is someone who hypes a stock to investors.
   ``The ABC thing has got everyone upset,'' said promoter Murray
Pezim, who was interviewed with his consent by ``PrimeTime'' chief
correspondent Chris Wallace.
   ``I could tell right away they were trying to take shots,''
Pezim said.
   Severe repercussions followed critical reports on the exchange
last year in Forbes and Barrons.
   ``The Forbes article came out of the blue, but there's some
anticipation with respect to this report,'' said Max Meier,
president of Pacific International Securities Inc. ``I would think
the damage is being done now rather than later.''
   John Wheeler, a director of McDermid St. Lawrence Ltd., played
down the impact of the prospective ABC program.
   ``This market is down for lots of good reasons,'' he said.
``Precious metals have been beaten up badly, it's the end of the
drilling season in the north, and recent results in Eskay Creek (a
major gold source in northwestern British Columbia) have been
disappointing.
   ``But probably more than anything we are in a global bear
market, and junior stocks all over the world have been beaten up,''

<HEAD>Two Commodity Fraud Trials Under Way in Chicago</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with opening statement in yen traders'
trial and jury selection in soybean traders' trial; no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen traders engaged in ``systematic cheating
of customers'' in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Japanese yen
pit, a prosecutor said today, as two more commodities fraud trials
got under way.
   ``You will be hearing about whispered conversation after
whispered conversation,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Huestes told
jurors in opening statements.
   ``This case is about systematic cheating of customers in the
Japanese yen pit,'' she said in the courtroom of U.S. District
Judge William T. Hart, in a trial stemming from an FBI sting
investigation at the world's two largest futures exchanges.
   Meanwhile, jury selection was completed this morning in the
other trial _ being held in the courtroom of Judge George Marovich
_ for soybean traders from the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Huestes said the government would attempt to show systematic
collusion between brokers and yen traders at the Merc to defraud
the broker's customers. She said the motivation was ``plain and
simple greed.''
   Huestes spent most of the first hour of her opening statement
explaining what the commodities pits are and what futures contracts
represent.
   In both cases, the defendants are accused of cheating customers
while executing their orders on the exchanges' trading floors.
   The charges stem from an unprecedented undercover investigation
in which FBI agents posed as corrupt traders. They secretly
tape-recorded conversations among traders at the two commodity
exchanges.
   A federal grand jury indicted 48 people in connection with the
probe. Twenty have pleaded guilty and one pleaded no contest.
   In the first trial to result from the investigation, a U.S.
District Court jury in July convicted two Swiss franc traders of
relatively minor trading violations and acquitted a third.
   The jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious
charges, including a racketeering count against one of the three
defendants. The men are scheduled to be tried again on those
charges early next year.

   POWERS OF THE REPUBLICS: Shatalin's plan, which amounts to a new
political structure of the Soviet Union, calls for creation of a
voluntary economic union of the 15 republics of the Soviet Union.
According to an early draft obtained by The Associated Press, each
republic:
   _ would be sovereign, and have many of its laws would supercede
those of the national government. The draft did not state whether
this referred to all issues or only economic ones.
   _ would be given broad economic authority that could enable it
to move rapidly to free prices, privatize government industries,
legalize private ownership of land and take other steps toward a
market-based economy.
   _ would control its own finances.
   _ would own its natural resources.
   _ would be entitled to a share of the national gold and hard
currency reserves.
   _ would control its own decisions on trade with other republics,
with prices and volume of trade set in contracts.

   POWERS OF THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT:
   The national government would retain control of:
   _ defense.
   _ economic forecasting.
   _ the money supply.
   _ national scientific research.
   _ the space program.
   _ nuclear energy program.
   _ the railroads.
   _ communications.
   _ those prices the republics allow it to regulate.

<TEXT>
   A major Japanese company has begun marketing
something consumers have long awaited _ a videocassette recorder
that automatically cuts out commercials. Even the maker's own.
   And while sales have been good, the product has raised the ire
of television networks, which argue that the possibility of fewer
people viewing commercials may prompt advertisers to pay less for
air time.
   Advertisements for the VCRs, which are made by Mitsubishi
Electric Corp. and are priced from $600 to $1,200,boast that ``with
this convenient function, you can automatically cut commercials ...
and enjoy the programs you want to watch without the ads.''
   The technology is aimed mainly at producing uninterrupted
recordings of Western movies, which are often broadcast on two
audio channels _ a main channel for the Japanese-language
soundtrack and a sub-channel for the original language.
   The bilingual programming was introduced on major network
schedules in 1978, after being developed by the Japan Broadcasting
Corp. about a decade earlier.
   Special signals during these broadcasts, which are usually
reserved for movies, news and foreign-made programs, serve as a
``cue'' for the new machines, telling them when to start and stop
recording.
   Such programs, however, account for only a fraction of the total
broadcasting fare, rendering Mitsubishi's ``auto-cut'' capability
useless for much of the day's programming.
   Even so, the idea has made television networks nervous.
   Two months after Mitsubishi's videocassette recorder hit the
market in April, Japan's largest privately owned network, the Tokyo
Broadcasting System, began mixing electronic static with its signal
to foil the ``auto-cut.''
   ``If viewers want to edit out commercials themselves, they are
free to do so,'' said TBS spokesman Akitsuna Furuya. ``But we
believe that, if taping is to be done, it should accurately reflect
what we broadcast.''
   Furuya added that the technology doesn't just edit out
commercials. ``It also cuts out the movie reviews that come at the
beginning and end of the broadcast.''
   The National Association of Commercial Broadcasters, a
federation of Japan's commercial stations, also expressed
reservations.
   ``Commercial television is based on advertising, so we obviously
are against the idea of cutting out ads,'' said an official with
the association, who requested anonymity.
   ``They don't have much of a share in the market yet, so we
haven't really been forced to take any position either way. But if
other companies started making similar machines, we would probably
have to protest,'' the official said.
   Mitsubishi spokesman Masahiro Suekuni said that when developing
``auto-cut,'' Mitsubishi was also aware that it, too, could be the
victim of ad-editing.
   ``But we decided that was something which couldn't be avoided.''
   He added that Mitsubishi doesn't expect ``auto-cut'' to have
much effect on broadcasters.
   ``Most people will continue to watch TV as it is broadcast,'' he
said.
   The Japan Video Association says nearly 70 percent of all
Japanese homes have a VCR, one of the highest ratios in the world.
While not giving exact figures, Suekuni said Mitsubishi has a
double-digit share, but still lags behind other home electronics
giants like Matsushita, which makes Panasonic and National brand
products.
   Because of the high percentage of homes that already have VCRs,
producers are finding it increasingly difficult to keep sales up
and have had to seek out new options, such as ``auto-cut,'' or
lower prices.
   ``It's a slow market in general,'' Suekuni said. ``But sales of
videos with the `auto-cut' function have been better than average
for a new product.''

<HEAD>Company to Appeal Ruling in IBM Copyright Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer services company said Tuesday it
would appeal a judge's ruling that it violated an IBM copyright for
a key component needed to run IBM's largest computers.
   U.S. District Judge Thomas N. O'Neill Jr. in Philadelphia ruled
Friday that Allen-Myland Inc. violated IBM's copyright for the
``microcode'' needed to operate its 3090 series mainframes. O'Neill
is scheduled to determine damages at a later date.
   Allen-Myland, based in Broomall, Pa., reconfigures International
Business Machines Corp. computers for customers, such as splitting
large computers into smaller versions.
   O'Neill found that the company, in dividing a computer, copied
IBM's microcode for one of the two computers that resulted.
   Microcode is the circuitry in a computer's central processor
that translates programming commands into language recognized by
the processor.
   Under a contract with IBM, Allen-Myland was required to obtain
the second set of code from IBM, said IBM spokesman Brian Doyle.
   The judge also found that Allen-Myland misrepresented to
customers that this second set of code came from IBM, Doyle said.
   Allen-Myland's president, Larry Allen, said his company contends
that microcode ``is part and parcel of the machine and that
customers should be allowed to alter that.''
   He said the copied code was used solely in computers owned by
the same customer from which the copy was made, and that
Allen-Myland did not sell the copied code to other customers.
   In a blow to IBM, O'Neill also ruled that IBM's pricing of the
microcode violates a 34-year-old consent decree IBM entered into
with the Justice Department relating to competition. Doyle said IBM
would appeal that ruling.

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A.H. Robins Co. was ``in the wrong place at
the wrong time'' in manufacturing the Dalkon Shield, the former
head of the company said Tuesday.
   But E. Claiborne Robins Jr., who was president of the company
until it was acquired by American Home Products Corp. in December,
stopped short of admitting a mistake in putting the intrauterine
device on the market in 1971. It was withdrawn from sales in 1974
after questions arose about its safety.
   Robins spoke to a breakfast meeting of the Friends of the
Industry of Agriculture in Virginia.
   It was the first time he has spoken publicly about the Dalkon
Shield since A.H. Robins filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
from creditors in August 1985 as claims mounted against the IUD.
   At the time of the filing, Robins said, the company was spending
$15 million a month on Dalkon Shield-related legal fees and the
corporate treasury had fallen to $9 million, not enough to meet the
monthly payroll.
   Robins referred to the Dalkon Shield as an ``unfortunate
incident'' in an otherwise successful history for the firm, which
was founded in Richmond by his grandfather in 1866. Robins called
the business ``the most successful bankrupt company in the world''
that grew to annual sales of almost $1 billion when it was taken
over as part of a court-approved reorganization.
   A.H. Robins introduced Robitussin cough syrup to the market in
1949, Dimetapp cold medicine in 1961 and acquired Chapstick lip
balm in 1963, Robins said. He said the company never had a layoff,
and he praised its employees for sticking by during the bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The company's reorganization, which received final court
approval late last year, included the creation of a $2.5 billion
fund to pay almost 200,000 Dalkon Shield claims. Claims are still
being processed by a trust organization that is independent of A.H.
Robins and its new parent.
   Since leaving the company, Robins has gotten involved in the
wine business and has applied for a state wholesale wine and wine
importer license.
   He described the new venture as an effort to turn ``a hobby into
a business.''

<TEXT>
   David LaRoche reassumed his role as head
of NECO Enterprises Inc. on Tuesday, only 2{ weeks after stepping
down from the real estate holding company.
   LaRoche gave up the position on Sept. 23 to Paul E. Buff, who
was appointed president and chief operating officer.
   At the time, Buff said the change was made because ``LaRoche did
not have sufficient time to handle day-to-day operations.''
   That was much the same reason Buff gave Tuesday when he
announced he would step down to become vice president. He said his
role as president of Quechee Lakes Corp. in Hartford, Vt., a NECO
subsidiary, gave him insufficient time to spend with NECO.
   ``It was probably a little premature the board electing me
president,'' he said. ``I just don't have the time to spend with
NECO.''
   LaRoche was out of the office Tuesday and did not return phone
calls. He is the company's majority stockholder, as well as
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Buff said the board discussed LaRoche's time constraints, but
felt ``he had the expertise and understood the company well enough
to do it.''
   Richard J. Hayes, NECO's departing treasurer and chief financial
officer, said the geographical distance between Vermont and Rhode
Island had made the job difficult for Buff.
   Hayes' resignation was announced Sept. 23. He said he would stay
until a replacement was found.

<HEAD>Collins to Dump Kentucky Fried Chicken Restaurants in
Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Collins Food International is getting out of
the domestic chicken business and trying to gain a greater stake in
its Sizzler restaurant chain.
   The Los Angeles-based Collins said Tuesday it had agreed to swap
its 209 U.S. Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants with PepsiCo Inc.
for PepsiCo stock worth about $122 million.
   PepsiCo is the parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken Corp.
Pepsico has been trying to turn the franchise around, in part by
renegotiating contracts with franchisees. Collins was the second
largest franchisee in the United States.
   The swap is part of a restructuring by Collins, a restaurant
operating company that also controls the Sizzler steak, seafood and
salad bar restaurant chain.
   The emerging company will own and operate 64 Kentucky Fried
Chicken restaurants in Queensland, Australia, and will operate or
subfranchise a total of 32 Sizzler restaurants in Australia.
Sizzler owns and operates or franchises a total of 664 Sizzler
Buffet Court and Grill restaurants.
   Collins said it would trade 1.25 shares of stock in a newly
organized, wholly owned subsidiary called New Collins for each of
the shares in the 34 percent of Sizzler Restaurants International
stock it does not already own.
   Collins' chief executive, Richard P. Bermingham, said the
restructuring would simplify Collins' corporate structure and give
Sizzler stockholders a chance at a tax-free swap for a stock with
increased market liquidity. He said the PepsiCo deal would provide
tax-free benefits to shareholders.
   Shareholders and regulators must approve the PepsiCo deal.
Closing of the Sizzler exchange is conditional on completion of the
PepsiCo transaction, receipt of enough shares to increase the
ownership of Sizzler to 80 percent, and approval by regulators.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa producing countries were advised Tuesday to
reduce drastically their areas under cultivation because of grim
prospects if output continues growing as it has in recent years.
   Increasing oversupply and persistently low prices are indicated
for cocoa under three of four projected scenarios in a study by the
International Cocoa Organization and the Geneva-based United
Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
   The market already has a heavy surplus, following six seasons of
overproduction. World stocks are at a record 1.37 million tons,
according to estimates released last month by the London-based
cocoa organization.
   In February, the price of cocoa dropped to its lowest in 14
years.
   Experts are projecting another world surplus in the 1990-91
season, which begins Oct. 1.
   Under the baseline scenario projected by the study, world cocoa
production will peak at 3.1 million tons in 2001-2002, compared
with estimated output of 2.361 million tons in 1990-91.
   The biggest increases are foreseen in Southeast Asia (up 62
percent) and Africa (up 32 percent), particularly in the Ivory
Coast, the world's biggest producer.
   Growth in Latin America is projected at only 10 percent because
output is expected to fall in Brazil.
   Demand should also grow through the period, the study says, but
not to a projected peak of 3.1 million tons until 2005. Use in
1989-90 is estimated at 2.211 million tons.

<HEAD>Discounter May Unveil New Symbol</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp.'s multibillion-dollar,
5-year plan to update its discount stores makes this a smart time
to say ``attention shoppers'' with a new logo as well, retail
consultants say.
   The company scheduled a news conference Wednesday at its Oak
Park outlet, prototype for its newer, brighter stores, where a new
sign was wrapped in a white tarpaulin marked with the old K mart
symbol.
   Company officials would not confirm a new logo was in the works,
saying only that a major announcement was planned.
   But the Detroit Free Press reported Monday that the store's red
K and turquoise m-a-r-t were taken down last week. The Detroit News
ran a picture Tuesday of new shopping carts found out back bearing
a changed logo.
   The new gray carts were marked with a big red K. Instead of
following the K in turquoise letters, the word mart is inside the K
in script.
   K mart announced plans earlier this year to remodel its stores
along the lines of the Oak Park store with its brighter lights and
wider aisles.
   ``You can change the inside of the store. But if you can't get
the customer in it, it doesn't mean anything,'' said Linda Morris,
retail analyst for PNC Financial Corp. in Pittsburgh, Pa.
   Morris said a new logo ``might say to the consumer, `Come in and
see us, we're different.'''
   With growing competition from discounters like Wal-Mart Stores
Inc. and Dayton-Hudson Corp.'s Target chain, ``They obviously have
to do everything they can to compete.'' said Otto Grote, analyst
for Derby Securities in New York.
   ``They're under a lot of scrutiny to bring the company
forward,'' Bloomfield Hills retail consultant Frederick Marx said.
   Anthony Camilletti of the Berkley store design company Jon
Greenberg &amp; Associates helped design the Oak Park store that opened
last year. He said designers talked with K mart officials at that
time about a storefront design that would integrate a new logo.
   K mart may have taken its time making a change because updating
a symbol as familiar as the red K can be risky, Camilletti said.
``You don't want to alienate that instant recognition.''

   Eastern Airlines unveiled Tuesday its latest
strategy to try to lure more business travelers, but the carrier's
survival was still in doubt at the end of court-appointed trustee
Martin Shugrue's ``100 Days'' campaign.
   Wednesday marks the end of the campaign, marketed through
perhaps the biggest media blitz in Eastern's history, in which
Shugrue vowed to improve the airline every day and get it headed in
the right direction.
   ``Congratulations. We're still here,'' he told some 1,000
employees packed into a steamy hangar at Miami International
Airport. ``We intend to be here for a good long while.''
   He also unveiled the company's new strategy for the business
traveler. Under it, Eastern is nearly doubling the size of its
first-class cabins, while offering a new ``corporate rate'' for
first-class travel that it says is 15 to 35 percent below full-fare
coach rates of its major competitors.
   On its B-757 planes, for example, Eastern will have as of Oct. 1
28 first-class seats, compared to 16. An Atlanta-Chicago
``corporate rate'' will be $313, available for $247 if purchased
three days in advance.
   The industry-average full-coach rate is $379, Eastern said, and
the average first-class rate is $565.
   Neil Monroe, Delta Airlines spokesman, said the Atlanta-based
competitor doesn't anticipate trying to match the Eastern fares.
   Shugrue said the airline was filling more seats, from 54 percent
in May to nearly 73 percent in August, but the carrier needs more
high-paying, frequent-flying business travelers. Its summer
passenger growth was spurred by sharply discounted fares geared
toward vacationing families.
   During questioning from mostly enthusiastic employees, and then
mostly skeptical journalists, Shugrue insisted his goal had been
accomplished. Eastern's passenger load and on-time performance are
up, and customer complaints are down, he said.
   He did acknowledge that Eastern still must climb from ``a large,
deep hole.''
   ``Airlines don't get in trouble in 100 days and they don't get
out of trouble in 100 days,'' Shugrue said. ``We're not there yet.
We still have a very long way to go.''
   Shugrue had little specific progress to report on two goals _
financial viability and labor peace _ he set in April when a
federal bankruptcy judge put him in charge of the troubled carrier,
moving aside controversial Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   In the second quarter, Eastern posted an operating loss of
$234.4 million, and a net loss of $129.3 million after sales of
assets. Shugrue said the airline's yield was better than expected
for August, but he declined to give figures.
   ``We made progress,'' he said. ``Yeah, we lost a little bit of
money.''
   He agreed Eastern's creditors ``are a little nervous'' about the
airline's financial prospects. He said Eastern's spending on
marketing, as well as an estimated $8 million to reconfigure its
first-class cabins, is an investment in the company's future.
   He was appointed to operate Eastern, not liquidate it, he said.
   Meanwhile, relations with Eastern's unions have deteriorated.
The Machinists union, whose March 4, 1989, strike spurred Eastern
to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, remains on strike,
and pilots and flight attendants unions are unhappy that few of
their members have gotten their jobs back in the 10 months since
they ended sympathy walkouts.
   ``It takes two to tango,'' said Shugrue, who said he wanted to
negotiate but refused to give in to unrealistic financial demands
or to bargain away the jobs of 18,000 Eastern workers who have
crossed picket lines.
   ``Look around, this is labor peace,'' Shugrue said, drawing
applause from employees.
   Frank Ortis, president of the Machinists Miami local, said
Shugrue hadn't live up to his promises.
   ``He in fact went just the opposite way,'' Ortis said. ``He's
continued on Lorenzo's path.''
   Shugrue's meeting with employees was filmed for future
commercials, as was a similar meeting that provided the basis for
the ``100 Days'' blitz.
   Ortis was critical of the media effort and plans to put leather
seats, airphones, new carpeting and other improvements in the
first-class section.
   ``They have had a lot of glitz, Madison Avenue, and the business
traveler is still not coming back. They're still losing between $1
million and $3 million every day,'' said Ortis, who pinned the
company's hopes on a merger or takeover by another airline.
   Shugrue said there have been contacts with other airlines, but
he said there was no major activity to report, and his focus is on
making Eastern viable independently.
   He said the improvements in first-class travel wasn't a gimmick,
but a ``fundamental change'' in marketing strategy after earlier
discounted first-class fares.

<HEAD>From Genius to `Vicious Criminal': Writers Tell It to the Judge</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The guy who rents Michael Milken a car in
Washington wants a federal judge to know that the financial felon
cares about the little guy. And he always rides a sedan _ never a
limo _ and pays his bills on time.
   CBS Inc. chief executive Laurence Tisch considers Milken ``a
person of high integrity'' whose criminal offenses belie his
character. Ordinary citizen J.B. Spence of Miami disagrees. He says
Milken is a ``vicious criminal and thief.''
   Friends, colleagues and strangers have barraged U.S. District
Judge Kimba A. Wood with about 300 letters appraising the former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond executive and offering ideas
for his sentence.
   The six-inch thick file is replete with testimonials that
portray Milken in a way few news reports of his illegal conduct
have: caring family man, devoted philanthropist, humble achiever
and driven but honest professional.
   ``He is not a man given to pomp or materialsm,'' wrote Samantha
Grier, a social worker who said Milken visited her ailing father in
the hospital. ``He is a man who uses a Bic pen as he works toward
creating his vision of a better world.''
   A handful of letters, all from people who don't know Milken
personally, are less flattering. One man was upset because Milken
was seen on television smiling as he entered federal court in April
to enter his guilty plea.
   ``I think he should languish in prison for at least 10 years,''
wrote Claude Daughtry, 72, of Berkeley, Calif. ``It will give him
plenty of time to rethink his scruples.''
   Milken faces up to 28 years in prison when he appears before
Judge Wood on Oct. 1. He pleaded guilty to six felonies involving
violations of tax and securities laws after a dogged four-year
government investigation.
   Those writing favorable letters urged leniency for Milken,
recommending some form of community service rather than prison
time. Most judges in recent Wall Street fraud cases have ordered
time as a deterrent to future crimes.
   Presentencing letters often are written at defense lawyers'
urging and the role the letters play in sentencing is up to the
judge. But they can be considered a measure of support; in
comparison to Milken's 300 letters, inside trader Ivan Boesky was
the subject of just 21 presentencing letters.
   The roster of letter-writers urging leniency for Milken includes
Time Warner Inc. Chairman Steven J. Ross; Armand Hammer, chairman
of Occidental Petroleum Corp.; former ``Let's Make a Deal'' host
and Milken friend Monty Hall; ex-football players Rosey Grier and
Fran Tarkenton; the chief of the Los Angeles police department;
takeover lawyers and Milken's old competitors; and educators from a
Harlem high school to the University of California at Berkeley's
business school, who praised Milken's wide educational activities.
   Some sought to distance Milken from other felons such as Boesky,
who swapped suitcases of cash for information and is widely
regarded as a pariah on Wall Street.
   Tisch said Milken's success is ``based on the merit and power of
his ideas, not improper dealings.'' A former Drexel associate, Paul
S. Levy, said Milken is not someone who ``wantonly and blatantly
flouted the law.''
   ``Good people make mistakes,'' he wrote. ``There were no
offshore accounts, bags of cash, calls from phone booths or clearly
identifiable, aggrieved victims. Michael is not a Pied Piper of
greed and lawlessness.''
   Wall Street lawyer Joseph H. Flom said that while he didn't
condone the acts to which Milken pleaded guilty, ``I can only
assume that they were the result of his preoccupation with his
clients' interests.''
   Hammer proclaimed that Milken through his junk bond revolution
that helped raise billions for corporations including Occidental
``led the charge which helped to assure that American democracy
could thrive.''
   Others are more personal. Friends and former secretaries recall
Milken delivering flowers after a family crisis, attending company
picnics, buying candy for their children at the movies and tutoring
disadvantaged children on Saturday mornings at ``Mike's Math Club.''
   The car dealer, Douglas Grimes, said Milken was his only client
who immediately called his California home, listened happily to a
tape of Grimes' original music and ``would always make a point to
ask how the business was going.''
   One writer said part of Milken's penalties should be used to
build an ``industrial exhibition village.'' Another said Milken
should be sentenced to help the Soviet Union, Hungary or Poland
reshape their economies, while living there. Others said Milken
should develop programs to finance low-income housing or feed the
hungry.
   Alfred Avins, an administrator at Northern Virginia Law School,
asked the judge to sentence Milken to law school _ at his
institution, on weekends, for four years.
   ``I believe that this will do more to rehabilitate Mr. Milken
than any form of incarceration,'' Avins wrote.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Higher; Gold Recovers in U.S. But Off Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose Tuesday but the Japanese yen
continued to take center stage on world foreign exchange markets.
   Gold prices posted minor gains after taking a steep tumble
overseas.
   Trading was choppy and thin in New York. Curreny dealers
reported the dollar initially surged, following the lead of Asian
and European markets, before settling back to end moderately higher
against most of its major foreign counterparts except the Canadian
dollar.
   Ian Foakes, foreign exchange manager at PaineWebber
International Inc. in New York, said a nervous mood prevailed in
the market, which was marked by volatility and slack activity.
   European currency dealers, meanwhile, said the dollar got a lift
from speculation that the cost of German unification will undermine
the mark.
   The West German government said Monday it would pay 12 billion
marks, or about $8 billion, to the Soviet Union to help repatriate
the country's soldiers from East Germany, but overall cost
estimates of unification run into the hundreds of billions of marks.
   The Japanese yen was the focus of activity on many foreign
exchange markets where dealers sold yen to pocket profits made
during the currency's recent advance.
   The yen, which suffered when tensions first flared in the Middle
East, has since regained strenth. The Bank of Japan's decision to
raise a key interest rate on Aug. 30 coupled with a recovery on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange had renewed buying interest in the yen.
   The dollar moved higher against the yen in New York, ending the
day at 140.305, up from 139.52 yen late Monday. Earlier in Tokyo,
the dollar closed at 139.85 yen, up 0.42 yen from Monday's finish.
In London, the dollar was quoted at 139.20 yen late in the session.
   British sterling benefitted from the profit-taking in yen but
still lost ground against the dollar. The pound finished at $1.8565
in New York, compared to $1.8580 late Monday. In late London
activity, a pound was quoted at $1.8490 compared with $1.8565 late
Monday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.5865 German marks, up from 1.5820; 1.3245 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3175; 5.3125 French francs, up from 5.3005;
1,183.00 Italian lire, up from 1,180.00; and 1.16095 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.16675.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with late levels on
Monday were: 1.5905 German marks, up from 1.5808; 1.3290 Swiss
francs, up from 1.3197; 5.3270 French francs, up from 5.2985;
1.7935 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7822; 1,186.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,180.50, and 1.1627 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1703.
   Precious metals dealers said trading lacked direction. Many
dealers are still feeling the sting from losses on gold purchased
when the prospect of a Middle East war was stronger, traders said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for September
delivery rose $1.90 a troy ounce to settle at $380.50, after
slumping $10.90 on Monday. Republic National Bank later quoted a
bid of $380.25 an ounce, or 35 cents higher than Monday's 4 p.m.
EDT bid.
   Gold traded in London at a late price of $381.25 per troy ounce,
down from $384.75 on Monday. In Zurich, gold was bid at $381.50 an
ounce, down from $387.00 late Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped $4.90 an ounce to $379.6.
   Silver prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange, silver for
September delivery settled at $4.777 a troy ounce, up from $4.755
on Monday. In London, the late silver bid was $4.81 a troy ounce,
up from $4.78 Monday.

<HEAD>Banking Industry Healthy, Executives Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Banking executives shrugged off a barrage of
negative reports on their industry Tuesday, pronouncing the
business sound but adding that it could be in better shape if
Congress relaxes restrictions on the kinds of products the banks
can sell.
   ``The commercial banking industry is healthy, strong enough to
weather a tougher economic climate in the 1990s,'' said Michael P.
Esposito, chief financial officer of Chase Manhattan Corp. at a
news conference held by the American Bankers Association.
   Esposito noted that the banking industry had almost $26 billion
in profits last year, while the savings and loan industry lost more
than $19 billion. He also said the threat to the banks by
potentially uncollectable loans to Third World nations had
diminished now that the banks have added billions of dollars to
their reserves for such loans.
   The bankers were on the defensive following a string of downbeat
assessments of the industry.
   The latest was a report by the General Accounting Office issued
Tuesday that said the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which
insures deposits at the nation's banks, could be wiped out by
losses banks are suffering from declining real estate values and
risky investments.
   The GAO, the auditing arm of Congress, said at least 35 of the
nation's 200 largest banks are likely to fail or require assistance
over the next year at a cost to the government of $4.4 billion to
$6.3 billion. The FDIC already faces losses of $2 billion this
year, in addition to losses of $5.1 billion in 1988 and 1989, the
GAO said.
   ``A $13 billion fund balance could be eliminated by the costs
related to one or more large money center banks with assets of $130
billion,'' said Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, who directs
the GAO. ``While I'm not saying that any money center banks are
currently in danger of failing, this demonstrates the vulnerability
of the fund.''
   But Esposito said he doubted the FDIC would run into trouble,
largely because the premiums banks pay into the fund have gone up.
   He conceded, ``There are going to be swings and cycles'' but
said the ABA's economists have drawn up projections that show the
fund will increase over time.
   Tuesday's GAO report came on the heels of an FDIC announcement
Friday that nationwide, commercial banks' profits fell 24 percent
during the second quarter. The performance of banks in the Midwest,
South and West improved during the period, but loan problems
increased in the Northeast and Southeast, the FDIC said.
   The bankers noted the industry has problem areas including the
Northeast and they said U.S. banks are becoming less competitive
with foreign banks.
   Their proposed solution to the latter problem is for Congress to
allow banks to sell securities, mutual funds, insurance and other
products that are now off-limits to the industry.
   The bankers used Tuesday's news conference to call once again
for changes in the Glass-Steagall and Bank Holding Company acts
that regulate the businesses that commercial banks may be involved
in.
   ``The rules the banking industry has to live with place us at a
disadvantage'' with foreign banks and non-banking lenders like
General Motors Acceptance Corp., said Esposito.
   GMAC, which is owned by General Motors Corp., finances loans and
mortgages for cars, trucks, homes and other properties.

<TEXT>
   Workers in the British North Sea oil and gas
industry said they planned to strike installations in one sector
for 24 hours beginning Wednesday morning.
   Ronnie McDonald of the Offshore Industries Liaison Committee
predicted 1,500 men would participate in the action starting at 7
a.m.
   Workers rejected any further job actions in a ballot conducted
by Shell U.K. Ltd. in the Brent field, McDonald said.
   He said the strike would be limited to the southern sector
gasfields. A total work stoppage throughout the British North Sea
would affect 10,000 workers on 100 platforms.
   The strikers, who want recognition of unions and higher safety
standards, brought work to a halt on a number of installations
throughout August. They protested the alleged refusal of the
employers in the Offshore Contractors' Council to organize a ballot
on union recognition and the refusal to reinstate 1,500 workers who
were fired for striking.
   A council spokesman said another strike would mean more firings.
   Safety has been a concern following a number of accidents in the
British North Sea. The area suffered the world's worst oil platform
disaster in July 1988 when an explosion and fire killed 167 men.
   A helicopter crash which killed six oil workers on July 25 was
the latest in a string of aircraft accidents in the oilfields over
the past four years.

<HEAD>Soybean Gains Mount with Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose strongly Tuesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade, extending a rally rooted in the worsening condition
of the new crop as harvest time approaches.
   Grain futures closed mostly higher, following the lead of the
soybean and soybean meal markets.
   On other commodity markets, oil futures retreated; platinum
futures dropped while other precious metals advanced; and livestock
and meat futures were mixed.
   Soybean futures settled 5 cents to 7\ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $6.25{ a bushel. Soybean meal
futures surged $2 to $4 with September ending the session at
$184.60 per ton.
   Wheat futures ended { cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
September at $2.67\ a bushel; corn was \ cent to 2 cents higher
with September at $2.41{ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 4\ cents
higher with September at $1.11{ a bushel.
   Soybeans built on Monday's solid gains after the Agriculture
Department released a weekly report showing deterioration of the
U.S. soybean crop.
   The USDA said 52 percent of the crop was in good to excellent
condition as of Sunday compared with 58 percent a week earlier.
   The USDA rated 76 percent of the corn crop good to excellent
compared with 79 percent a week ago.
   Dry weather has stressed soybean plants in the Southeast and
Mississippi Delta regions, although recent rains are believed to be
easing those problems, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president in the grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in Chicago.
   Nevertheless, ``the crop condition is worsening and it's
September already,'' said Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine
Corp.'s floor operations at the exchange.
   Zusel said traders' questions include whether the crop will come
back and ``how much will it be able to come back.''
   William Biedermann, research director with the Chicago-area
futures brokerage Allendale Inc., said any yield losses would only
worsen the supply prospects for the coming year.
   Experts already are projecting relatively tight supplies due to
an expected decline in South American soybean production and strong
world demand for soybean meal.
   Traders will get an update on harvest prospects after
Wednesday's close, when the USDA is scheduled to release a monthly
crop report.
   Analysts expect little change from the government's August
soybean crop estimate of 1.84 billion bushels. But the government
is expected to raise its corn crop projection to nearly 8 billion
bushels from last month's estimate of 7.85 billion.
   Oil futures ended mostly lower in a volatile session on the New
York Mercantile Exchange, reflecting perceptions of easing tensions
in the Persian Gulf area.
   In one sign of cooling hostilities, Iraq informed U.S. officials
that Arab-born American males residing in Iraq and Kuwait would be
allowed to return to the United States. The Iraqis previously had
allowed no U.S. males to leave the two countries.
   In a bearish surprise after the close, a weekly American
Petroleum Institute report showed a 2.1 million barrel increase in
U.S. supplies of crude oil last week.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled 30 cents to 89 cents lower
with October at $31 a barrel; heating oil was 1.70 cents to 3.17
cents lower with October at 83.03 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was 1.12 cents lower to .19 cent higher with October at 93.60 cents
a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures rallied modestly on New York's Commodity
Exchange, reversing some of Monday's steep losses. But platinum
futures continued to decline on the New York Merc, reflecting
weakening industrial demand for the metal, said William O'Neill of
Merrill Lynch Futures.
   Gold finished $1.70 to $2.40 higher with September at $380.50 a
troy ounce; silver was 2 cents to 2.2 cents higher with September
at $4.777 a troy ounce; platinum was $4.60 to $4.70 lower with
October at $452.80 a troy ounce.
   Higher cash markets continued to lift livestock futures on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange but pork bellies ended mostly lower
amid disappointment that the weekend meeting between President Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev produced no offer of food
export credits to the Soviets.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .40 cent higher with October at
78.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to .45 cent
higher with September at 87.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .02
cent to .55 cent higher with October at 50.72 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .45 cent lower to .10 cent higher with February
at 52.72 cents a pound.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House proponents of legislation to require
that new car fleets average 40 miles per gallon within a decade
asked House Speaker Thomas S. Foley on Tuesday to promise a vote
this fall.
   As the Senate prepared to begin debate on the bill, 13 House
supporters made their request in an apparent effort to prevent the
legislation from being trapped in the Energy and Commerce Committee.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., is a staunch
ally of the auto industry, which is fighting the bill.
   ``I know he's going to be opposed to it,'' Rep. Barbara Boxer,
D-Calif., told reporters. ``It's no secret. We may have to fight it
out on the floor. I only hope that we can get it to the floor.''
   A spokesman for Dingell declined to comment. Foley aides did not
immediately return a phone call.
   Boxer introduced a bill Monday identical to pending Senate
legislation that would require automakers to boost fuel efficiency
20 percent by 1995 and 40 percent by 2001.
   The bill is expected to reach the Senate floor this week. But a
spokeswoman for Majority Leader George Mitchell said the timetable
was uncertain because of other pressing business.
   The auto industry stepped up its attack on the bill, saying it
would cost up to 300,000 jobs and deprive consumers of such popular
family vehicles as station wagons and minivans.
   ``If the bill were enacted into law, we'd have economic disaster
on our hands,'' said Tom Hanna, president of the Motor Vehicle
Manufacturers Association, which represents the Big Three U.S.
automakers.
   Representatives of foreign car manufacturers and U.S. auto
dealers also criticized the bill at a news conference. The groups
are sponsoring newspaper and radio advertisements in hopes of
inspiring grassroots opposition.
   The United Auto Workers union was mailing 40,000 letters to
Capitol Hill urging the bill's defeat. The Bush administration
opposes it.
   Current law sets the minimum ``corporate average fuel economy''
or CAFE at 27.5 miles per gallon. The law requires that each new
car fleet _ all the cars a company manufactures in a given year _
meet that standard.
   Under the legislation, the typical new car fleet would average
34.4 miles per gallon in 1995 and 40.2 mpg by 2001.
   Proponents have sought tougher standards for years without
success. But they say momentum has swung their way since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait focused attention on the nation's reliance on
Middle Eastern oil.
   In a letter to Foley, Boxer and 12 other House members said,
``It is critical that the House speak out strongly in support of
efforts to promote efficiency and conservation.''
   It said, ``We are seeking a commitment that the House have an
opportunity to vote on the Bryan bill, or another auto efficiency
bill, before the end of the session.''
   The proposed CAFE standards could save 2.8 million gallons of
oil per day, nearly one-third of the nation's daily consumption of
imported oil, the letter said.
   It also contended there was ``no technological barrier to
meeting these higher standards; indeed, automobile industry
executives admit that a 50 mpg standard is feasible.''
   Automakers insist the only way to meet the proposed standards is
to reduce drastically the size of new cars. All available
fuel-efficiency technology already is being utilized and efforts to
improve are continuing, they said.
   Fuel costs determine energy efficiency, Hanna said. If the price
is down, consumers want larger cars and manufacturers meet the
demand. If the price rises, demand for smaller cars rises.

   National contract talks between the United Auto
Workers and General Motors Corp. continued Tuesday after a union
executive told local leaders to prepare the troops for a strike.
   Negotiators were working against a midnight Friday deadline to
reach a national contract covering about 300,000 active GM workers.
UAW contracts with Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. also expire at
the same time, but the union has chosen GM as its target for a
strike.
   In all, more than 450,000 active auto workers are covered by UAW
contracts with the Big Three automakers.
   The union's main bargaining goal is job security, and a union
telephone recording said Tuesday that little progress had been made
on that issue.
   ``The corporation must become more serious in their attitude,''
said UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich, in charge of the union's GM
bargaining team. He told local union leaders they should be ready
for a strike.
   ``I trust that you will do everything necessary to prepare the
membership for a disciplined response to whatever action is
required in the difficult days ahead,'' Yokich said.
   The last time the UAW struck GM over a national contract was in
1984, when the union staged a weeklong walkout at 12 assembly
plants and the company's Technical Center in Warren, Mich.
   This year, members of UAW Local 659 at GM's AC Rochester West
component plant in Flint staged a six-day strike that shut down
seven assembly plants and parts of more than a dozen component
factories.
   ``We haven't heard hardly anything,'' said UAW Local 662 Vice
President Larry Howerton of Anderson, Ind. ``We're going to have to
hear something pretty soon. We've got to be notified.''
   There has been little news coming out of the talks this year.
UAW and GM officials have been available to media only occasionally
and when they have appeared, they rarely talked about contract
details. They have preferred instead to say both sides were working
hard and there still was time to reach an agreement before the
deadline.
   So far, union officials have said tentative agreements have been
reached on nearly all non-economic issues, such as military leave
and jury duty provisions. But the economic issues, which include
job security, are the tough ones.
   The UAW leadership has a strong strike authorization vote under
its belt, clearing the way for it to call a strike against GM if an
agreement cannot be reached.

   The last time the United Auto Workers bargained a
pattern national contract with General Motors Corp., tensions were
high and a weeklong strike resulted.
   With three days left in this year's bargaining, the stress isn't
as noticeable as it was in 1984, and some even feel the union's
position has been strengthened since the last big strike.
   ``I feel that we are more on the offense than on the defense
now,'' said Larry Howerton, vice president of Local 662 in
Anderson, Ind. ``It seems like we were trying (in 1984) to hold
everything we got and (now) we're trying to get what we want.''
   But one basic fact underlies the process this time around, and
it has the attention of both sides. That's the loss of market share
to the Japanese.
   ``You're dealing with some very fundamental things here,'' auto
analyst Joseph Phillippi of Shearson Lehman Brothers said Tuesday.
   In past years, including 1984, negotiating arguments centered on
a percent or two in wages or on how financial guarantees for
laid-off workers would work.
   These days, the issues and especially their potential effects
are much deeper and, according to Phillippi, it's mostly due to the
growth of the U.S. manufacturing base by Japanese automakers.
   During the 1980s, the Big Three watched their collective share
of the U.S. auto market drop 6 percentage points to about 68
percent, while the share of cars with Japanese nameplates increased
about 6 points to 25.4 percent.
   ``It's become abundantly clear that we (U.S. automakers) are
unable to pry people out of their Nissans, Hondas or Toyotas and
get them to buy American products,'' Phillippi said. ``We've tried
cash, Japan-bashing, you name it and it hasn't worked.
   ``Any right-thinking individual has got to be really, really
concerned,'' he said.
   Because of that concern, Phillippi suggested, negotiators aren't
talking outside bargaining meetings.
   ``The people are under wraps,'' UAW Local 160 President Pete
Kelly, a member of the union's 1984 bargaining committee. ``There
is nobody down there who is going to buck the hierarchy of the
UAW.''
   Auto labor observers have said this year's talks have been
remarkably lacking in public details. Officially, union and company
officials say that indicates both sides are hard at work, toiling
against a midnight Friday deadline.
   UAW contracts with GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.,
covering more than 450,000 active workers, expire at the same time.
Late last month, the union chose to focus its bargaining at GM.
   The union plans to use a contract ratified by GM workers as a
pattern for agreements with Ford and Chrysler. It is expected to
take about two weeks for UAW members to vote on any tentative
agreement.
   In 1984, the union picked dual targets _ Ford and GM. With less
than a week remaining in the bargaining, the UAW targeted GM. Then
and now, the main issue was job security.
   But unlike this round of bargaining, tensions were much higher
six years ago, perhaps because of lingering anger over a series of
concession contracts the union signed a few years earlier with the
Big Three. At the time, the automakers were in the financial dumps.
   As the final minutes ticked off of the bargaining clock in 1984,
the UAW leadership couldn't hold its membership. Workers began
walking off their jobs before the midnight deadline.
   By the time UAW President Owen Bieber announced a strike at 12
GM assembly plants and its Technical Center in Warren, Mich.,
employees already were walking picket lines.
   The following day, not enough workers showed up at their jobs at
GM's Lordstown, Ohio, assembly plant, which was not officially
struck, and that factory shut down.
   The strike lasted for seven days, and the union bragged that it
had won major guarantees on job security and important wage and
benefit gains. Three years later, the union said it built on the
job security provisions of 1984.
   But since 1987, GM has closed four assembly plants, putting
about 9,000 UAW members on layoff.

   Stock prices fell marginally in light, quiet
trading Tuesday as the market remained concerned about oil prices,
interest rates and federal budget negotations, analysts said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks slipped 2.97 to
2,612.62.
   In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancing
ones by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock
Exchange-listed stocks, with 609 up, 835 down and 513 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 113.22 million
shares, down from 119.73 million Monday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 136.36 million shares.
   Oil prices seesawed below and above Monday's closing price,
taking stock prices along for the ride. At one point when oil
prices were higher, the Dow was down as much as 22 points.
   The October contract for crude eventually settled at $30.76 a
barrel, down 54 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Stock investors also remained wary about interest rates,
analysts say. Rumors over the past few days have said the Federal
Reserve would ease rates, but the central bank didn't take any
action.
   An additional uncertainty in the market was the fate of
congressional budget negotiations in Washington, said William R.
Rothe, a managing director at the brokerage Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc.
in Baltimore.
   Rothe said there were ``too many issues that remain unresolved''
for investors to commit money to stocks.
   The market received no help from abroad, with stock prices
closing lower in Japan and London.
   Tandem Computer was the most-active NYSE issue, falling 2&lsqb; to
11{ as 2.8 million shares changed hands. The company said its
growth rate may not be as high as stock analysts predicted and that
it was cutting costs to preserve profits.
   Several other technology stocks also were hurt. Compaq Computer
fell 2 to 43\ and Motorola slipped 1&rsqb; to 59~. Both also were on the
NYSE most-active list.
   But another computer stock, Texas Instruments, climbed 3{ to 29&lsqb;
on a Japanese newspaper report that the company is seeking $1.5
billion a year in additional royalty payments from Japanese
companies for two microchip patents.
   Among most-active blue chip issues on the NYSE, AT&amp;T was up } at
31&lsqb;, Philip Morris rose &lsqb; to 45, IBM advanced 1| to 107{ and
General Electric gained 1&lsqb; to 62\.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $6.995 billion, or 0.23
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
0.31 to 176.39.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 0.34 to 380.23, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index lost 0.59 to 321.04.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
2.24 to 379.49. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index slipped 0.20 to 323.01.

<HEAD>Steelworkers Approve Wheeling-Pitt Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of the United Steelworkers union
overwhelmingly approved a new contract with Wheeling-Pittsburgh
Steel Corp. on Tuesday, clearing a major hurdle in the company's
attempt to reorganize.
   Jim Bowen, USW District 23 director, said 4,615 steelworkers
voted in favor of the pact with 329 workers against it. A simple
majority was needed to approve the pact, which expires in March
1994.
   ``This is the very climax of what I think will be a very
important process for Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel and our union,''
Bowen said. ``I think these numbers reflect the confidence the
workers have in their union.''
   Leaders from all 13 Wheeling-Pitt locals urged their members to
vote for the pact, which affects 5,500 union workers in West
Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
   ``I learned a long time ago that if you ever get everything you
asked for you didn't ask for enough to start with,'' said Bowen.
``We asked for plenty and I'll tell you I think we got our fair
share of it.''
   Ray Johnson, a Wheeling-Pitt spokesman, said company officials
were surprised by the lopsided tally.
   ``We did expect a very good vote for it, but this was
overwhelming,'' he said.
   Bowen said the vote opens the door for Wheeling-Pitt officials
to file an amended reorganization plan with U.S. Bankruptcy Judge
Warren Bentz in Pittsburgh.
   ``The lawyers and accountants ought to quit playing their
games,'' said Bowen. ``They got their labor agreement. It's been
confirmed. Now I say to the judge and all the rest of them, It's
time to get this over with.''
   Wheeling-Pitt has been operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection since April 1985.
   Bentz still must review the labor agreement. Johnson said an
amended reorganization plan will be voted on by creditors,
shareholders and all Wheeling-Pitt employees.
   He said it will likely be another two months before an amended
reorganization plan incorporating the new contract is confirmed by
the bankruptcy court.
   The contract includes a wage increase of $1.50 per hour, which
would restore wages sacrificed earlier, and a $3,000 signing bonus
for each union worker.
   The company also agreed to give the steelworkers 2.2 million
shares of stock worth $22 million and a cash payment of $38 million
in return for wage concessions made in 1982 and 1985.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the American Stock Exchange said
Tuesday that he expects the globalization of securities markets in
the 1990s will lead to a shakeout among smaller exchanges in this
country.
   ``I would be very suprised to see more than three significant
marketplaces survive the 1990s,'' AMEX Chairman James R. Jones told
the National Economists Club.
   Jones, a former Oklahoma congressman, also said he expected only
one of those three survivors to trade solely through electronic
methods.
   Currently, the AMEX and the larger New York Stock Exchange trade
through the in-person auction system between buyers and sellers.
The 14 smaller exchanges are linked to the larger New York
exchanges to facilitate transactions.
   ``I think for most of the regional exchanges, they're going to
have a very difficult time in the 1990s and I think at the very
least, there will be joint ventures with the larger exchanges,''
Jones told reporters after giving a talk on the United States' role
in the stock markets of the 1990s.
   ``I don't know how exactly it's going to come out,'' he said.
``I think it's going to be very hard for some of the smaller
regional exchanges to compete, to have the capital needed for new
technology etc., etc. so I think you'll either see mergers or
perhaps joint ventures.''
   Just back from meetings of the international stock exchange
association, in Frankfurt and Berlin, Jones said the United States
also will have to liberalize its securities laws.
   ``We're going to have to revisit our own securities laws and ask
if we're going to make them so rigid that they would not be
competitive in the world market,'' he said.
   Jones also said it would be a mistake to impose a tax on
securities transactions, a revenue-raising plan said to be under
consideration by budget negotiators, when other countries are
lowering or eliminating theirs.
   He noted that options trading moved from Sweden to London after
the Swedish government imposed a transaction tax.
   A transaction tax ``would make us non-competitive,'' he said.

<HEAD>Thrift Agency Sells Junk Bonds in Open Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Resolution Trust Corp. on Tuesday offered
for sale on the open market part of its portfolio of high-risk junk
bonds, a spokeswoman for the agency said.
   ``We have been selling'' junk bonds, spokeswoman Kate Spears
said. She declined to provide any details.
   But bond traders said the RTC sold about $70 million of junk
bonds, nearly the full amount it had intended to sell.
   ``They traded very well,'' said Steve Shenfeld, a trader at
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York.
   Two of the issues the RTC sold, Golden Nugget and McCaw
Cellular, together accounted for some $25 million, said market
sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Other issues sold by
the agency included Eastern Airlines, Penn Traffic and Telemundo
Group.
   The RTC, the federal agency set up to dispose of failed savings
and loans, has around $2.9 billion of the high-risk, high-yield
junk bonds which it took over from the collapsed thrifts. The
once-thriving junk bond market has been cited as a factor in the
failure of some S&amp;Ls that invested heavily in the bonds and took
losses when the market weakened.
   ``The implications of what happened today are a positive,'' said
Joseph C. Bencivenga, the head of high-yield research at Salomon
Brothers Inc. in New York. ``It shows that the market is not dead
and investors are willing to pay for issues they consider to have
value.''
   Traders said they expect the RTC, which also sold junk bonds
last week, to offer more of the issues for sale later this week.
   ``They will be in the market (at various times) over many, many
months,'' Shenfeld said. ``In general, I think the RTC's portfolio
will eventually find a home.''
   On Monday, federal regulators announced they had blocked the
proposed $3 billion sale by Columbia Savings &amp; Loan Association of
its junk bonds to a group of Canadian and Hong Kong investors.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said it cannot approve the sale
in its current form because Columbia neglected to seek an adequate
number of bids for the junk bond portfolio. Columbia, a troubled
thrift based in Beverly Hills, Calif., failed to seek any all-cash
bids as part of the bidding process, the OTS said.
   Columbia at one time had the thrift industry's largest portfolio
of junk bonds.
   Regulators have held off seizing Columbia while its managers
tried to find a buyer for the junk bonds, despite the fact that the
thrift is insolvent. Columbia was $350 million in the red according
to the latest report, largely due to the declining value of the
junk bond portfolio but also because of recent real estate losses.
   Analysts have suggested that the regulators may be reluctant to
take over Columbia because they don't want the government to have
the junk bonds on its hands.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. announced an agreement Tuesday with
Siemens A.G., a West German electronics manufacturer, to
cross-license each other's essential patents for a pan-European
digital cellular telephone network.
   The agreement also covers technology for a proposed European
personal communications network, a type of cellular phone system in
which many more users would be able to gain access to the phone
network at once, and phone costs would be much lower than with
today's cellular systems.
   The agreement follows a similar pact two months ago between
Motorola and the Dutch communications company Alcatel N.V., also
designed to help clear the way for development of the proposed
cellular phone network based on a single standard throughout Europe.
   The companies each are supplying part of the network and need
the cross-licensing agreements to complete the system, said Mario
Salvadori, a Motorola spokesman.
   Bernard Smedley, a Motorola senior vice president, said the
agreements with European manufacturers demonstrate that ``the
appropriate forum for resolving intellectual property rights issues
... is among manufacturers through fair, bilateral negotiations.''
   Terms of the licensing agreements were not disclosed.
   Motorola, based in suburban Schaumburg, has been awarded
contracts to build digital cellular systems in several European
countries. It also is a minority owner of Mercury Personal
Communications Ltd., which is building a personal communications
network in the United Kingdom.

   It's no secret that the oil futures market loves
a good rumor, but the mill has been working overtime since the Iraq
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Somebody on the floor will say we heard this, this and that,
and people will start trading pretty quickly,'' said Ann-Louise
Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   ``I think this is a very unusual situation because ... we're in
an uncertain situation in the Middle East.''
   With most petroleum prices keying off futures, the gossip game
can eventually have an impact far beyond the trading floors. These
days, consumers fill their cars with gasoline or stock up on home
heating oil that costs more money, thanks in large measure to what
happened on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   ``Sure, rumors can ultimately affect the consumer,'' said Art
Wiese, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute. Gauging the
impact would be hard, however.
   ``You'd have to be able to determine fairly specifically what
the impact of the rumor was, versus all the other things going on
in the market all day,'' Wiese said.
   Executives of the Merc view any trading based on rumors as a
``momentary aberration,'' according to Neal L. Wolkoff, senior vice
president for regulatory affairs and operations.
   ``I would think that a market move of an hour would tend to be
corrected fairly quickly and would have a minimum impact on
people's pocket books,'' Wolkoff said in an interview Tuesday.
   But the price paid for current delivery of oil largely reflects
the price established in the futures market.
   Speculation on contracts for future delivery of petroleum
products has virtually eliminated long-term pricing in the
industry, forcing oil buyers to pay a price similar to the latest
Merc price.
   The effects of the grapevine were apparent Monday, when lower
oil prices were suddenly pushed higher late in the afternoon on
rumors that Iraq had either amassed troops on the Jordanian border
or even sent troops into Jordan.
   There were also rumors that Iraqi paratroopers had attacked
Saudi Arabian oilfields or that shooting had broken out in the
military standoff.
   Exchange officials said Tuesday they were looking into what
happened to determine whether any rumor was spread with an intent
to influence prices.
   ``We're trying to investigate,'' Wolkoff said. ``It's obviously
very difficult to get to the source of a story that gets started,
then somehow gets repeated, then somehow gets adopted.''
   The Merc would not hesitate to discipline anyone trying to
manipulate the market through rumors, or even to turn them in to
the Justice Department, Wolkoff said.
   As much as Merc managers dislike floor rumors, they have been
around since the exchange began trading oil in 1983.
   ``In the '80s, there were occasional rumors of the Ayatollah's
death,'' Wolkoff said, referring to past Iranian crises. ``There
were rumors that the president, President Reagan, died. These
things affected the markets across the board. The rumors of the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's death perhaps had more impact than
his death.''
   The latest oil crisis has seen more than just Monday's rumors. A
little more than a week earlier, oil markets in Asia were sent
tumbling by rumors that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had lost
power. That rumor had its own brief effects on the U.S. markets.
   ``First, I believe it was that there had been a coup and then
someone said he had been killed, and that's how the rumor
started,'' said Ed Kevelson, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. ``It affected Asia and it somewhat affected our opening here,
but by the time it got here it had been discounted.''

   Gasoline prices rose 2.1 cents per gallon

   AAA's Fuel Gauge Report found self-serve regular unleaded

   Prices increased in all regions of the country this week, but
the largest hikes were in the mid-Atlantic, Southwest and Midwest,
AAA said. It said supplies of gasoline remain adequate throughout

   Oil prices settled lower Tuesday after swinging
nervously during the day in response to shifting news from the
Middle East.
   ``It's really a very, very uncertain and skittish market,'' said
Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc.
   Light sweet crude oil for October delivery settled 54 cents
lower at $30.76 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Contracts for later months were also down.
   In early trading, oil fell as markets realized the rumors that
sparked a rally on Monday were untrue. But news later Tuesday
indicated Iraq was increasing its military activities near Syria
and Turkey, and oil shot back up.
   It dropped as traders began taking profits and developing a
sense that the price needed to move downward.
   ``It's difficult to come up with a reason in a market like
this,'' Hittle said. ``It's getting skittish on its own.''
   Other petroleum futures traded on the Merc were generally down.
   Unleaded gasoline for October fell 1.12 cents to 93.60 cents per
gallon, while later contracts were mostly down. Home heating oil
for October fell 2.86 cents to 83.03 cents per gallon, and later
months were also down.
   Natural gas for October was unchanged at $1.525 per 1,000 cubic
feet.
   Trader Ed Kevelson of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said heating oil
took the biggest fall in anticipation that American Petroleum
Institute statistics released after the market closed would show an
increased stockpile of distillates, which include heating oil.
   According to the API report, distillate stocks rose from 126.7
million barrels to 131.7 million barrels for the week ending Sept.
7, while distillate production and imports were down. The stockpile
of distillates had been 119.8 million barrels a year earlier, API
said.
   Crude oil imports for the week rose to 6.9 million barrels per
day from 6.8 million barrels, while crude stocks were up to 374.3
million barrels from 372.2 million barrels. A year earlier, crude
imports had been running at 6.5 million barrels per day, while the
stockpile had been 338.6 million barrels.
   Gasoline stocks stood at 211.1 million barrels, up from 210.5
million barrels a week earlier but down from 218.4 million barrels
a year earlier. Gasoline imports rose to 261,000 barrels per day
from 192,000 barrels a week earlier, but were down from 272,000
barrels a year earlier.
   Meanwhile, prices at the pump were up.
   The American Automobile Association reported a gallon of
self-serve regular unleaded rose 2.1 cents to $1.294 per gallon
nationwide since last Wednesday. The average retail price was 21.9
cents higher than Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded Kuwait and
sent oil markets into a state of chaos.

<HEAD>PBS To Provide TV Show Listings Through For-Profit Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A subsidiary of the Public Broadcasting Service
and another company said Tuesday they would launch a nationwide
system to transmit television show listings to viewers' homes to
help set videocassette recorders.
   The system would send the TV listings in the ``vertical blanking
interval,'' the empty space in a television signal that is seen as
black bar when a TV picture rolls.
   The system from PBS National Datacast, a for-profit PBS
subsidiary, and InSight Telecast would provide subscribers with
detailed on-screen TV show schedule information that could be used
to set a VCR through the use of a special device, the companies
said.
   The system is expected to be available in early 1992, the
companies said.
   National Datacast says it has been using the vertical blanking
interval to send information, such as stock quotes and credit card
verification data, since 1984.
   InSight is a provider of TV listings.

<HEAD>NYSE Board Approves Two Stages of 24-Hour Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday approved
two stages of its plan to implement 24-hour trading by the end of
the decade.
   Approved were two trading periods, called crossing sessions,
that would allow completion of trades after hours.
   The NYSE board also approved a series of rules for trading after
the exchange's regular hours of 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.
   Big Board president Richard A. Grasso said the plan ``reflects
the NYSE's commitment to innovative services for its customers and
positions the exchange competitively in the evolution of the
24-hour marketplace.''
   NYSE Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. unveiled the extended trading
plan earlier this year in response to increasing competition from
other markets.
   The first stage of the exchange's five-part plan was introduced
Aug. 3, permitting some late trades at the market closing price for
orders already in place.
   The two after-hours trading sessions approved Tuesday would be
instituted pending approval of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   The first session would run from 4:15 to 5 p.m. and permit
trading at the market's closing price. All orders placed during
this session would be matched up and executed at 5 p.m.
   The second session, running from 4:15 p.m. to 5:15 p.m., would
allow traders to execute computerized program trades based on
aggregate prices tied to a market index.
   The NYSE said the fourth phase of its plan, targeted for 1991,
would allow auctions several times during the night of all listed
securities. The fifth phase would provide for conventional trading
round the clock.
   Phelan has said 24-hour trading is planned for the end of the
decade, but other officials have said it could be in place within
five years.
   Round-the-clock trading now exists in the foreign currency and
U.S. Treasury bond markets, where dealers conduct transactions via
telephone and computer links. The two Chicago futures markets plan
to begin computerized, extended-hours trading in November.
   Also Tuesday, the NYSE board approved the formation of a market
for trading unregistered securities under a new federal regulation.
The NYSE said the new market could be in place by early 1991.
   The American Stock Exchange also has announced plans for trading
unregistered securities, which are placed privately with big
institutions. The SEC passed Rule 144a earlier this year easing
trading of such securities.

   The Russian republic's parliament voted
overwhelmingly for a radical economic reform program, and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said he favored it over a moderate
plan proposed by his prime minister.
   Gorbachev's surprise statement Tuesday increased the chances
that the radical plan will go into effect throughout the Soviet
Union.
   The plan calls for transferring most economic authority from the
national government to the country's 15 republics, which could then
free prices, privatize government industries, legalize private
ownership of land and take other steps toward a market-based
economy.

still in doubt at the end of court-appointed trustee Martin

   On Tuesday, Shugrue unveiled the company's new strategy for the

that it says is 15 to 35 percent below full-fare coach rates of

   ``Somebody on the floor will say we heard this, this and that,
and people will start trading pretty quickly,'' said Ann-Louise
Hittle, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   With most petroleum prices keying off futures, the gossip game

heating oil that costs more money, thanks in large measure to what
happened on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

<HEAD>Overbooked Passengers Can Sue Airline, Appeals Court Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Airline passengers bumped from overbooked
flights can turn down the free tickets and refunds they're offered
and sue for damages, a federal appeals court ruled Tuesday.
   In a case from Montana, a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said a federal ban on direct state
regulation of airlines does not prevent a passenger from suing
under ordinary state law for harm caused by airline practices.
   The ruling allows William D. West, a Helena, Mont., patent
lawyer, to pursue a suit against Northwest Airlines for selling
tickets that cannot be exchanged or refunded but are subject to
bumping when flights are overbooked. West is seeking punitive
damages.
   ``Selling nonrefundable tickets limits a traveler's ability to
make changes but not the airline's ability . . . to switch to a
smaller-size aircraft, increasing the chances of bumping,'' said
attorney Cornish Hitchcock of the Public Citizen Litigation Group,
a Ralph Nader organization that helped represent West.
   The right to sue for overbooking was established in a 1976
Supreme Court decision, a case that started when Allegheny Airlines
bumped Nader from a Washington-to-Hartford flight. In Tuesday's
ruling, the appeals court said the federal deregulation of airlines
in 1978 did not prohibit all such suits.
   The airline was studying the ruling Tuesday and had no comment,
said its lawyer, Jon Metropoulos.
   Hitchcock said West's case was unusual because it holds the
possibility of sizable damages if the airline is found to have
acted in bad faith under Montana law.
   Many airlines offer free-trip coupons to passengers on
overbooked flights. Federal law also entitles a bumped passenger to
a refund of the ticket price, up to $200, if a substitute flight is
more than an hour later than the original flight, or twice those
amounts if more than two hours late. Hitchcock said the typical
traveler probably should take one of those options rather than sue.
   ``We generally recommend that people take the money or take the
free ticket as a quick and easy way of resolving the matter,'' he
said. ``The litigation can drag on for some time and there's no
guarantee of recovery.''
   West was bumped from a Northwest flight from Great Falls, Mont.,
to Arlington, Va., in September 1986 when the airline switched from
a 146-passenger plane to a 78-passenger plane without warning
ticket agents. West, who had been scheduled to land in Arlington at
9 p.m., turned down an alternative flight to a nearby airport at 3
a.m. and instead rescheduled his trip two weeks later.
   His suit under Montana law for bad-faith dealing by the airline
was dismissed by U.S. District Judge Charles Lovell, which said it
was barred by federal law. But the appeals court disagreed.
   The 1978 federal airline deregulation law, which prohibited
state laws ``relating to rates, routes or services of any air
carrier,'' bars only those state laws that purport to regulate
airlines, said Judge Dorothy Nelson in the 3-0 ruling.
   ``State laws that merely have an effect on airline services are
not pre-empted,'' Nelson said. She said one such law was the
Montana statute invoked by West, requiring good-faith conduct
between buyers and sellers or any other parties in a contract.
   The court said it was not deciding whether West had a valid
claim under that law, only that he had a right to sue.

<HEAD>Salomon Inc. Agrees to Pay $83.75 Million to Department of Energy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salomon Inc. said Tuesday it has agreed to pay
the U.S. Department of Energy $83.75 million to settle claims of
alleged violations committed by the commodities broker Phibro Corp.
before it merged with Salomon.
   Salomon said the Energy Department alleged that it violated
crude oil price and allocation regulations. The brokerage was not
specific about the allegations in a brief statement.
   The payment would be far below the $311 million payment
originally sought by the Energy Department when it began
administratrative proceedings in September 1988.
   Salomon, which had set aside reserves for a payment, said
Tuesday the agreement would not affect earnings.
   Phibro merged with Salomon in 1981. The unit is now called
Phibro Energy Inc. The alleged violations were committed by Phibro
between 1978 and 1980. The regulations expired in 1981.
   In its statement Tuesday, Salomon said most of the DOE's
allegations are without merit, but it decided to agree to the
$83.75 million payment to avoid the cost of pursuing the matter in
the courts.

   Defense attorneys Tuesday mimicked the frenzied
action in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's Japanese yen pit as
opening arguments began in the trial of 14 currency traders accused
of cheating customers.
   Attorneys Ed Genson and Joseph Duffy, the first to make their
opening statements before U.S. District Judge William T. Hart,
imitated the rapid calls and hand signals of the pit. They
described the noise and stress caused by about 100 traders
competing for currency futures contracts every business day.
   They also questioned the worth, as evidence, of surreptitious
tapes made by undercover FBI Agent Dieter Volk, who posed as a
corrupt trader as part of a sting investigation at the world's two
largest futures exchanges.
   ``The pit is not a quiet, whispery place,'' said Genson,
attorney for independent yen trader Robert Bailin, 36.
   His comment was a challenge to the opening statement of
Assistant U.S. Attorney Lisa Huestes.
   ``You will be hearing about whispered conversation after
whispered conversation,'' Huestes told the jurors earlier Tuesday.
   Huestes said the government would try to show systematic
collusion between brokers and independent _ or ``local'' _ yen
traders to defraud the brokers' customers, often through locals
agreeing to buy brokers' erroneous contracts in exchange for
trading favors. She said the motivation was ``plain and simple
greed.''
   Duffy, defense attorney for John M. Baker, 51, said many of the
tapes Volk made of Baker were made in a bar, where Volk often
bought beers for the broker.
   ``The FBI recorded the musings of a drunk. That's not credible
evidence,'' he said.
   The charges resulted from an unprecedented undercover
investigation in which FBI agents posed as corrupt traders. They
secretly tape-recorded conversations among traders at the two
commodity exchanges.
   A federal grand jury indicted 48 people in the probe. Twenty
have pleaded guilty, and one pleaded no contest.
   In the first trial resulting from the investigation, a U.S.
District Court jury in July convicted two Swiss franc traders of
relatively minor trading violations and acquitted a third.
   The jury could not reach verdicts on scores of more serious
charges, including a racketeering count against one of the three
defendants. The men are to be tried again on those charges early
next year.

   Black-owned businesses increased more than
twice as fast as overall business growth over five years, the
Census Bureau reported Tuesday.
   But the money earned by black firms went up at only the same
rate as business overall, reflecting that the minority-owned
companies were relatively smaller than businesses overall.
   The bureau reported that black-owned businesses increased from
308,000 in 1982 to 424,000 in 1987, the most recent year for which
detailed information is available.
   That was an increase of 38 percent, compared with a rise of just
14 percent in the total number of businesses in the country.
   During the same period, receipts of black-owned firms rose 105
percent to $19.8 billion. Total business income increased 106
percent to more than $1.9 trillion in the same period.
   According to the Census report, based on the 1987 Economic
Census, 94 percent of black-owned businesses were sole
proprietorships.
   Receipts per company averaged $47,000 for black-owned companies
compared to $146,000 for all businesses. And 54 percent of
black-owned firms had receipts of under $10,000.
   About half of all black-owned businesses were service companies,
while 16 percent were in retail trade.
   By income, automobile dealers and service stations were the top
black-owned business, followed by business services, health
service, contractors and miscellaneous retail firms.
   New York, with 28,063 businesses, has the most black-owned
firms, the report said. Los Angeles was second at 23,932, followed
by Washington, 23,046; Chicago, 15,374 and Houston, 12,989.
