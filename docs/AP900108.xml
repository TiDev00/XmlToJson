   Former President Ronald Reagan received the NCAA's
highest award Monday night, but he wasn't a popular choice among
some college administrators who felt he hurt women's athletics
during his time in office.
   ``President Reagan did a lot of good things but it just happens
he didn't doLopiano, women's athletic director of the University of Texas.
   ``Reagan's record on women's athletics is abysmal. He set it
back 10 years. He was also the worst education president in the
last 40 years,'' said Lopiano.
   There was no organized protest during the two-hour award dinner,
but several women refused to stand with the rest of the crowd when
Reagan was introduced for the Theodore Roosevelt Award.
   The former presIdnt made no reference to the controversy in his
remarks to the audience of 2,000, and joked, ``Nancy has my
football sweater from Eurek!!3ollege and wait until I come home
with this.''
   Earlier, Lopiano remarked that ``Richard Nixon would be a better
choice. He was president when Title IX was promulgated.''
   Congress passed Title IX in 1972, forcing colleges and
universities to provide equal opportunity to males and females at
any school receiving federal funds. The act applieL sainly to
athletic programs.
   In 1984, the Supreme Court tightened the language of the act, in
effMcj striking down Title IX in regard to athletics since no
athletic department received federal funds. Reagan supported the
Supreme Court's decision.
   The Civil Rights Restoration Act, sponsored by U.S. Sen. Edward
Kennedy in 1988, brought back Title IX in regard to athletics. The
act was passed by Congress, but vetoed by Reagan. Congress,
however, overrode his veto, which restored the act.
   Former professional golfer Carol Mann resigned her seat on the
awards committee in protest of the NCAA's decision to honor Reagan,
objecting to his opposition to Title IX as it applied to athletics.
   The Theodore Roosevelt Award, nicknamed the ``Teddy Award,'' has
been presented since 1967 and is given by the NCAA to a
``distinguished citizen of national reputation and outstanding
accomplishment.''
   Reagan, }hh resides in Los Angeles, is a 1932 graduate of Eureka
College, where he played football.

   Not long ago, it looked as if Home
Shopping Network Inc.'s picture tube had gone kaput.
   The television retailer was losing money for the first time. A
big lawsuit against GTE Corp. boomeranged into a $100 million libel
award for the telecommunications giant. Analysts and investors were
ready to play taps for the company that had popularized zirconium
cube jewelry peddled live on TV.
   The tune has changed. Home Shopping Network is rebounding. Its
stock has more than doubled since hitting a low of $3 in mid-1989.
Sales are setting records. The GTE issue was settled in November
for $4.5 million in insurance.
   What had been diagnosed as a fatal cash hemorrhage turned out to
be just a near-death experience that led to some serious rethinking
by once-cocky HSN executives.
   ``The one thing you can say about Home Shopping Network is it
takes a licking and keeps on ticking,'' said Peter Grandich, a
securities analyst at Affiliated Financial Management Inc. in
Howell, N.J. ``After the GTE award, everyone thought the party was
over.''
   The relatively painless resolution with GTE was a fortuitous
boost for the 4-year-old company, now leaner after shedding several
unprofitable ventures to concentrate on TV sales operations.
   But HSN no longer is the undisputed titan of the TV marketplace
following the merger of two rivals. It also is engrossed in another
courtroom brawl, this time with junk-bond investment firm Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   That battle, which could determine the value of $100 million
worth of HSN securities issued in 1986, illustrates the company's
crash landing after years of heady expansion.
   In dispute are bonds that pay interest of 5.5 percent and are
convertible to HSN stock. They were an immediate hit, reflecting
investor confidence in the Clearwater, Fla.-based company that had
dazzled TV viewers with buying opportunities on items ranging from
ersatz diamond rings to vitamin pills.
   The price of HSN shares climbed to $47, making the convertible
bonds even more attractive.
   But rising costs and unprofitable diversification began to erode
gains, and the stock weakened. It took a big beating after HSN
became mired in the $1.5 billion suit against Stamford, Conn.-based
GTE, claiming an inadequate telephone system cost HSN $500 million
in business in 1986 and '87.
   When the date arrived to reset the bond's conversion rate in
1987, HSN shares were worth a fraction of their earlier value.
Drexel, the bond's underwriter, negotiated a conversion rate of
$7.05 a share, down from the original $28.50.
   Before the change could take effect, however, HSN sued in
federal court in Tampa claiming Drexel artificially manipulated HSN
stock down to get the lower conversion price on the bonds.
   HSN claimed Drexel's motive was to reap huge profits by selling
the bonds later if HSN's stock price rose. Drexel is fighting the
suit and a hearing is set for Jan. 17 in Tampa federal court.
   For its fiscal quarter ending Nov. 30, HSN reported sales up 27
percent from a year earlier to a quarterly record $255.2 million.
After-tax profit nearly doubled to more than $20 million.
   ``To paraphrase Twain, `Reports of our death were greatly
exaggerated,''' said Nando DiFilippo, HSN's general counsel.
   HSN also plans to discontinue its financial service operations
and scale down a pharmaceutical unit to include only its line of
vitamins. HSN now reaches about half the nation's homes via cable
or regular channels.
   ``We're going to stick with the business we do best: video
retailing,'' said Les Wandler, HSN's chief financial officer.
``When you have a gold mine, you mine gold. You don't go looking
for other business. We learned that.''
   The merger of two competitors, CVN Cos. of Minneapolis and QVC
Network of West Chester, Pa., could pose a strategic threat to HSN,
which tried unsuccessfully in 1987 to merge with CVN. But HSN
executives say they aren't worried.
   ``The more people get used to buying off television, the better
off everyone in the industry is,'' Wandler said.
   Larry Gerbrandt, a media analyst at Paul Kagen Associates in
Carmel, Calif., said the HSN stock could dip if bondholders
exercise their stock-conversion option once the Drexel suit is
resolved.
   But he said assets such as its St. Petersburg-based studios and
cable network give HSN intrinsic value.
   ``I see HSN well north of $12 a share,'' he said.
   ``The GTE suit was a misadventure that totally distracted Home
Shopping Network from its core business,'' said Gerbrandt.
``They've gotten a second chance.''

   After 10 years of focusing on shuttles,
NASA plans 64 space exploration missions this decade, creating a
data deluge that could swamp an agency already drowning in
information that's never been studied.
   ``We will acquire in the next three years what it's taken 25
years to get,'' said James Green, director of the National Space
Science Data Center at Goddard Space Flight Center. The volume will
double every two years after that, with a virtual information
explosion in 1996 from the Earth Observing System.
   EOS is expected to transmit more data in 30 hours than is
already stored from 25 years of space travel. Before EOS, the next
three years should see the launch of the Cosmic Background
Explorer, the Galileo mission to Jupiter, the Hubble Space
Telescope, Gamma Ray Observer, Ulysses mission to the sun, the Mars
Observer and the TOPEX Poseidon ocean-sensing satellite.
   Scientists hope EOS will yield data to such solve threats to the
Earth's survival as global warming and the thinning of the
protective ozone layer.
   The critical question is whether it will be in a form they can
use.
   Industry hasn't developed hardware or software to serve the
demands of disciplines as diverse as anthropology, zoology and
atmospheric physics, so it has been up to government scientists to
pioneer solutions that have put NASA at the cutting edge, but still
short of making computerized data easily usable.
   Observers say part of the problem lies with NASA itself. The
agency traditionally has been most willing to cut funds for
archiving data if it ran short of money when launching a space
mission. It is undergoing a change in focus, too, moving from an
era of general space exploration to one of information gathering _
and funding for that lags.
   In the fiscal 1990 budget, the data center received $4.7 million
for managing, archiving and distributing data, up from the 1989
budget allocation of $3.2 million. By comparison, NASA's entire
1990 budget was $12.5 billion.
   Green likens the data analysis and management after a space
launch to the ``the last puppy that comes to supper _ if there's
too many puppies, there's not much left.'' But while he agreed his
area frequently gets short shrift, he said funding increases show
the agency is moving in the right direction.
   ``The thing is you don't put the space probes up there for no
reason,'' said David Dickerson, an aide to Rep. Bill Nelson,
D-Fla., chairman of the House space science subcommittee. ``The
distance they travel is not what's important. It's the information
they send back. They're going to have to put increasing amount of
thought and resources to that.''
   Alan Robock, a University of Maryland meteorologist who is
testing NASA techniques for improving accessibility to data, said
the fault isn't just with the space agency. ``Computers and data
analysis are not nearly as sexy ... they're harder to sell to
Congress.''
   William Campbell, a NASA artificial intelligence expert, is
developing techniques to build intelligence into the data
gathering. Increasingly fast and sensitive instruments can gather
data faster than anyone can analyze or catalog it, Campbell said.
``It's not just the volume, it's the complexity.''
   He and other NASA scientists believe they are on the brink of
developing systems that would put the data in usable form almost
from the time instruments capture it in space by analyzing it with
the users' needs in mind.
   ``The idea is to build intelligence into the whole system from
the back end to the user,'' he said. ``This is a whole new way of
thinking about the problem. I contend it is the only hope.''
   In the five years since Green took over, the Space Science Data
Center has gone from a ``tape landfill'' to concentrating on data
accessibility. But as it struggles toward answers to the pending
data deluge, it is burdened with catching up from years of neglect.
   Of approximately 80,000 magnetic tapes dating to the early 1960s
that are in a climate-controlled federal warehouse in Suitland,
about half need to be restored, said Robert McGuire, who heads the
project. About 9,000 have been restored since the effort began in
July 1988.
   Another 30,000 to 40,000 tapes are at the Space Science Data
Center.
   Under Green, the center's goals shifted from storage to
accessibility and he said it now handles 6,000 requests a year _ up
from 2,000 five years ago _ using new computer networks to
universities and research centers, electronic mail, and the postal
service. Data in demand on climate, atmosphere and other subjects
are online in the computer in 15 systems. That information is
stored on magnetic diskettes or high-density optical disks that
hold as much as 40 of the sequential magnetic tapes and let the
user go right to the needed data.
   If the technology doesn't exist to manage data beamed back from
EOS, the instruments should be monitored only some of the time _ or
not launched, Green said. ``It doesn't do anybody any good if we
can't manage the data.''

<HEAD>Albania: Caught Between Isolation and Pressure for Change</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist leaders of isolated
Albania, Europe's last bastion of Stalinism, have staunchly denied
any intention of relinquishing their independence and following the
trend toward democracy in Eastern Europe.
   But Communist leader Ramiz Alia may come under increasing
pressure to change, both from abroad and inside the country, where
cautious reforms increasingly conflict with adherence to the rigid
communism of Albania's founding father, Enver Hoxha.
   There were unconfirmed reports of unrest at Tirana University's
student dorms last summer. Yugoslav media, in reports denied by
Albanian officials, have spoken of anti-government protests in the
cities of Shkodra and Korca last fall.
   King Leka I, the pretender to Albania's throne who has lived in
South Africa for the past 10 years, said in an interview published
Friday that leaflets urging Albanians to overthrow their hard-line
government will be dropped by balloon into the closed Balkan nation
bordering the Adriatic.
   Albanian emigre groups in Europe meanwhile are said by the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug to have petitioned West European
parliaments to help the Albanians win freedom.
   Outwardly, Alia has shown no sign of yielding to such pressure.
In a New Year's message to his people, he denounced what he called
a foreign ``campaign of slanders'' to get Albania to follow the
democratic trends in Eastern Europe.
   The very reference to Eastern Europe, and the specific reference
to campaigns abroad, may indicate that Alia faces questions about
reform at home.
   On Dec. 12, Alia justified the refusal to follow Eastern Europe
by stressing that Albania, which severed ties with Moscow in 1961
and China in 1978, is not like other Communist countries.
   Processes like those in Eastern Europe ``will not occur in
Albania,'' he said. ``Albania and Eastern Europe have developed
along completely different ideological, political, economic and
social roads,'' he added.
   Albania is the last East European country to revere Josef
Stalin, whose giant statue stands in the capital, Tirana.
   Even more important is Hoxha. He died in 1985, but his name
remains sacred for Albania's leaders, who last year opened a
costly, grandiose museum in Tirana that is intended to enshrine his
every deed and word in the national memory.
   Vistors to Tirana report that groups of schoolchildren are
guided repeatedly through the museum as part of their rigid
education as loyal citizens of Albania.
   Yet there are signs that young people, particularly, are
increasingly influenced by the Italian, Yugoslav and Greek
television broadcasts that amuse them instead of Albanian TV, which
broadcasts only in the evening.
   The attitude of the young _ whose protests sparked the
revolutions that toppled orthodox Communists in East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Romania _ is particularly important in Albania,
which has one of the highest birthrates in Europe.
   Perhaps because of youth's importance, Louis Zanga, an Albanian
specialist at the U.S.-financed Radio Free Europe radio station,
noted in August and September an unusual discussion of taboo topics
such as youth's love of rock music and fashions they can't find in
Albanian stores.
   According to Zanga, youth union leader Mehmet Elezi criticized
conservative bureaucrats for their handling of a poll of young
people, who, on guarantee of anonymity, unexpectedly spoke of their
love for rock music.
   ``Tomorrow, in a similar situation, young people will not
respond for fear of getting into trouble,'' Elezi reportedly said.
``And how will we then be able to figure out their thoughts?''
   Media in neighboring Yugoslavia, which accuses Albania of
fomenting unrest in its southern province of Kosovo, have detected
some other signs of change.
   The Belgrade daily Politika noted for example that a book
recently published by a former Albanian interior minister, Neshat
Tozai, described apparently for the first time harassment by the
dreaded Sigurimi, or security police.
   Romania's 23 million citizens eventually rose up against Nicolae
Ceausescu's equally feared security network. But there are only 3.2
million Albanians to control, and they have been virtually cut off
from the world since 1944, far longer than Romanians.
   But over the past two years, cultural exhibitions have brought
Albanians glimpses of West German and French arts. Popular Italian
singers toured last fall.
   Ambiguities abound in politics and economics. Alia, in an
apparent effort to assure Albanians they live in a democracy,
constantly exhorts officials to be closer to the people, yet
asserts that only Communists can rule.
   In the state-run economy, official plans are constantly reported
to be more than fulfilled, yet every leader's speech talks of
``deformations'' and problems in industry and agriculture.
   A severe drought last year caused rationing of energy, much of
which comes from hydropower. And Alia's bleak New Year's message
was more of the same: ``Economic austerity measures are demanded
everywhere,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Bridget Mergens and a group of friends wanted
to start a high school club _ something like the chess club, only
they would discuss the Bible.
   Five years later, Bridget Mergens Mayhew, now married and the
mother of a 13-month-old girl, is making her first trip to
Washington to listen to arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court in
a case that could provide an important ruling on church-state
relations.
   The court will hear an appeal Tuesday by Omaha Westside High
School officials who say allowing a Bible study group to meet at
the school after class would violate the constitutionally required
separation of church and state.
   Mrs. Mergens Mayhew came from a Roman Catholic family, joined an
interdenominational church group in high school and now is a member
of the Assembly of God. She wasn't expecting trouble when she asked
to start the Bible group.
   ``We wanted to be like the chess club, but talk about biblical
things,'' she said Friday. ``It scared the school so much.''
   By accepting the case, the justices agreed to review a 1984
federal law requiring that student religious groups receive the
same access as other extracurricular clubs to public high school
facilities.
   Westside school officials said a school policy requiring clubs
to be curriculum-related and have a school sponsor meant their
decision to keep out the Bible club was not in violation of the
federal Equal Access Act.
   Principal James Findley said he initially thought ``no
problem,'' when Miss Mergens, then a senior, said others at the
1,500-student school wanted to get together to read the Bible and
pray. The problem arose when the students wanted the group to be
recognized as a club, meeting after school hours, he said.
   School officials saw that as a violation of the separation of
church and state and had other concerns, Findley said.
   ``Our interpretation was, once we let that group meet, we would
have to let any group meet,'' he said. ``If a satanist club wanted
to meet, we think we'd have to allow that to happen. Those were our
concerns.''
   School officials said students are free to discuss religious
subjects, but they can't expect the school to endorse them and
permit equal access to all school resources.
   Mrs. Mergens Mayhew, who lives in nearby Bellevue, said she
feels the school discriminated against the students who wanted the
Bible group.
   ``For me, it's a religious issue,'' she said. ``But it's
important for more than the religious community.''
   As the case went through the federal courts, she found herself
reading about the Constitution and the nation's founders.
   ``They were religious men. They were godly men. They didn't want
one colony to push one religion on them. They wanted to pursue it
on their own. That's why they wrote the Constitution the way they
did,'' she said. ``Our forefathers were sharp guys.''
   The Supreme Court ruled in 1981 that state universities cannot
ban student groups from using campus facilities for religious
worship and study. But the justices have not decided if the rule
should apply to high schools.
   In the Mergens case, a federal court ruled in favor of the
school district, but the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
overturned the decision.
   The appeals court rejected the contention that high school
students are more impressionable than college students and should
be protected from student religious groups that may appear to be
sanctioned by school authorities.
   Robert Skolrood, executive director of the National Legal
Foundation, which is helping Mrs. Mergens Mayhew, said he would be
``terribly disappointed'' if the high court didn't uphold the
appellate decision.
   The students should be allowed to meet because it was their
decision, not the school establishing a religion, he said. That
means the case could have implications for the question of school
prayer, he said.
   ``Students have every right to do it if it's not the school
determining it,'' he said.
   Dick Shugrue, a Creighton University law professor, said the
court's decision may be made on much narrower grounds.
   Those backing the Mergens side believe if the case succeeds it
will be ``a stake in the heart'' of the high court's 1963 ban on
school prayer, Shugrue said.
   ``The hope of the Mergens supporters is that the court would
say, `We made a tragic mistake. ... By golly, let's put God back in
the public schools,' '' Shugrue said.

<HEAD>Guerrilla Movement Says No Talks Until All Restrictions Lifted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's main black
guerrilla movement said today that it would enter talks with South
Africa's white rulers only if granted the same political freedom as
the governing National Party.
   Until that occurs, the outlawed African National Congress will
seek to intensify its guerrilla campaign, the organization said in
a statement issued to mark its 78th anniversary.
   President F.W. de Klerk, since taking office in mid-August, has
eased restrictions on black opposition activity, freed several
jailed ANC leaders, and offered to negotiate a new constitution
that would extend political rights to blacks while protecting white
interests.
   The ANC, although reducing its guerrilla attacks to a low level
in recent months, has said it will not enter talks until de Klerk
lifts the state of emergency imposed in 1986, frees ANC leader
Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners and lifts bans on the
ANC and other militant opposition groups.
   The ANC said its forces ``would not be terrorized into
negotiations and could not be expected to enter into such a process
until they enjoyed the same freedom to engage in political activity
as did the ruling National Party.''
   ANC guerrilla commanders ``will remain at their active posts,
committed to the intensification of our armed offensive against the
violent apartheid system,'' the statement said. ``The people's army
must ... further develop its combat capacity inside the country, so
that it becomes a formidable force capable of delivering telling
blows against the apartheid regime on a continuous and nationwide
basis.''
   Undeer apartheid, the country's 28 million blacks have no vote
in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.
   The ANC said de Klerk ``still has a long way to go'' before he
could claim so have ended repression. It said the government bore
full responsibility for ensuring that negotiations toward a
peaceful settlement took place.
   The statement was issued by ANC headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia,
and was distributed in South Africa by the independent South
African Press Association.

   ``Oklahoma!'' may be the state song, but
that doesn't mean its the state's song.
   Oklahoma tourism officials discovered that recently when they
used the song in television ads.
   The tourism department paid more than $17,000 to play parts of
the song in commercials to attract tourists from neighboring states.
   When tourism director Glenn Sullivan learned the state had paid
to use its own state song in a non-profit endeavor, he asked his
staff to see if a refund was possible.
   A staffer uncovered a letter from lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II
that had been entered into the 1953 legislative journal after a
similar dispute.
   ``Tell your readers and all the people of Oklahoma that not only
may they play and sing it anywhere and everywhere to their heart's
content, but that we want them and urge them to do so,''
Hammerstein's letter said.
   His only restrictions were that the song not be used in a play
or ``against any dramatic background.''
   But officials from Albertco, which now owns rights to the
Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ``Oklahoma,'' said Friday they
would not grant a refund.
   Albertco said the published copy of Hammerstein's letter was not
signed and is not legally binding.
   Tourism spokesman Steve Paris said the company appears to have a
strong case. He said the department still may ask the attorney
general for an opinion.
   Tourism advertising manager Dennis Donaldson said it hardly
seems fair that the state should have to continue paying to use the
song or change the ads.
   ``After all, we let them use our state to do a play.''

``Chariots of Fire,'' has died at age 40 of complications from AIDS.
   Charleson was suffering from septicemia, a blood disease, and
died Saturday, said his agent, Michael Whitehall.
   English actor Ian McKellen said Charleson was ``the most
unmannered and unactorish of actors: always truthful, always
honest.''
   McKellen said Sunday night that Charleson was a very talented
actor and singer whose Hamlet ``cut right through the accretions of
the centuries ... he was a living modern.''
   He received wide acclaim when he replaced Daniel Day Lewis last
fall as Shakespeare's tormented Dane in the production at London's
Royal National Theater. Charleson's last performance came just nine
weeks ago.
   ``After nearly four hours on stage he was given a standing
ovation,'' Whitehall said. ``It was clear that he was exhausted but
his courage, not only in being on that stage but giving us the
performance of his life, left our applause and cheers seeming very
inadequate.''
   John Peter in The Sunday Times of London called Charleson ``a
princely Hamlet, every inch the king he should have been.''
   Earlier, the actor won praise in three American shows at the
same theater _ the musical ``Guys and Dolls,'' playing Sky
Masterson; Sam Shepard's ``Fool For Love,'' as the violently
passionate Eddie; and Tennessee Williams's ``Cat On A Hot Tin
Roof,'' as the self-lacerating Brick.
   Charleson found his widest public in Hugh Hudson's 1981 hit film
``Chariots of Fire,'' playing Christian runner Eric Liddell, who
refuses to run on Sunday because he doesn't believe in competition
on the Sabbath.
   The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture.
   Other movies included the 1982 Oscar-winning ``Gandhi,'' as a
priest who befriends the Indian leader, and the comedy ``Car
Trouble,'' opposite his ``Fool For Love'' co-star, Julie Walters.
   The son of a printer, Charleson was born in Edinburgh on Aug.
11, 1949. He won a scholarship to the capital's Royal High School
and studied architecture at Edinburgh University.
   He turned to acting while at the London Academy of Music and
Dramatic Art and began his stage career with a two-year stint at
the Young Vic Theater from 1972 to 1974.
   The bulk of his stage work was for Britain's two major
state-subsidized theaters. His first roles at the National were in
``Julius Caesar'' and ``Volpone'' in 1977. Credits at the Royal
Shakespeare Company include ``Love's Labors Lost'' and ``The
Tempest.''
   Charleson appeared last year, alongside McKellen, in a benefit
performance of Martin Sherman's play ``Bent,'' about the Nazi
persecution of homosexuals during World War II.
   Unlike Broadway, which has lost many leading figures to AIDS,
particularly in the musical theater, the British arts world has
been much less dramatically affected.
   McKellen said the Charleson family deserved praise for making
public the cause of his death.
   ``It's still very unusual for people in the public eye to say
they are HIV positive, that they have AIDS,'' said McKellen.
``What's wonderful is that the first tribute to him is that his
family should acknowledge the reason for his death.''
   There will be a private family funeral in Scotland later this
week and a memorial service in London later in the year, Whitehall
said.

   On a 12-acre patch of shrubs and tall grass
sits the boarded-up shell of a long-abandoned dinner theater. A few
miles away, a tony country club produces tennis players and
promises future profits.
   They seem to have little in common, but both carry a $1.9
million pricetag and are listed among hundreds of pieces of real
estate for sale as federal regulators try to unload properties held
by problem thrifts.
   There are no ``for sale'' signs in front of the Thousand Oaks
Racquet Club, but members have been wondering aloud what's been
happening to their dues since the federal government took over the
savings and loan that foreclosed on the property.
   ``We do have people who come in here and say, `I know this is
owned by the bank, and the bank is owned by the government, and how
safe are my dues?''' said Liz Gallacher, the new manager.
   The club boasts the only indoor tennis courts in San Antonio as
well as outdoor courts, a large swimming pool and seven acres of
land in a vibrant commercial area of the city.
   Club officials say control of Thousand Oaks, built in 1976, was
passed among several owners and managers before Mission Savings
Association foreclosed and took over the property in December 1988.
   It is now owned by Mission Texas Corp., a subsidiary of the
thrift now controlled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. The
club has been on the market about two months at $1.9 million.
   It's one of $19 million worth of Mission properties for sale,
said Mission President Keith Klein.
   Klein describes the racquet club as an ``income-generating''
property. Ms. Gallacher said she hopes the club will turn a profit
``pretty soon,'' although she offered no timetable.
   So why sell?
   ``We're not in the health club business,'' Klein said.
   The sale also fits the Bush administration's strategic plan for
bailing out the nation's savings and loans. The plan released
Wednesday instructs regulators to start selling real estate and
other assets from insolvent thrifts even before the government
officially closes the institutions.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., created in August and run by the
FDIC, controls 281 S&amp;Ls with combined assets of $104 billion. The
agency expects to take over 200 other institutions with total
assets of about $150 billion. Roughly half the assets are real
estate, covering tens of thousands of properties across the country.
   A few miles from Thousand Oaks, the former Fiesta Theater
Playhouse sits amid largely vacant land in San Antonio's northern
suburbs. The Bexar Savings Association, like Mission Savings a
small player in the thrift crisis and also under federal control,
is trying to sell the dilapidated dinner theater.
   ``The building is in absolutely deplorable condition because of
vandals and thieves and robbers and plunderers,'' said realtor
Terry Warth. The $1.93 million asking price is justified by its
12.55 acres, he said.
   Bexar Savings officers said they had no history available on the
property, and Warth said he knows little about the property's
financial history except that it's been idle about five years.
   At the country club, the possibility of yet another new owner is
seen is just one more step toward success.
   Ms. Gallacher said she hopes to stay as manager and rebuild
membership, which has fallen to about 600 from a peak of 850.
   She's trying to bolster its tennis pro roster, which now
includes the well-known women's coach from Trinity University,
Emily Foster.
   ``It's just going to take some hard work and diligence to get
things going, and I don't see any reason for it to fail anymore,''
Ms. Gallacher said. ``I plan on turning it around and making it a
success.''

<TEXT>
   Bush administration officials acknowledged
Sunday they have had ``some difficulties'' with Colombian
authorities over plans to deploy U.S. warships near Colombia to
help intercept drug smugglers' supply routes.
   But national security adviser Brent Scowcroft blamed the
problems on ``some premature and ... probably inaccurate leaks''
about U.S. intentions and predicted officials in Colombia and other
Latin American nations will come around.
   President Bush himself, jogging after church Sunday, turned
aside a question about whether he was positioning the aircraft
carrier John F. Kennedy off the coast of Colombia to help interdict
drug supplies by sea and by air.
   ``I will address myself ... to that question at a future date,''
the president said before an outing on the towpath of the historic
C&amp;O Canal above the Georgetown section of Washington.
   When a reporter said Colombia doesn't want U.S. warships off its
coast, Bush injected, ``We don't know all that.''
   However, Bogota's El Tiempo published a communique Sunday by the
government of President Virgilio Barco that said the Colombian
``government has not participated, nor will it participate, in any
joint operation with United States military forces, air or naval,
in the Caribbean Sea. In international waters it has not
participated, nor will it, and in territorial waters it has not
authorized (the operations), nor is it considering authorizing
them.''
   At a White House reception Sunday night, Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney declined to say where the Kennedy or other ships were now,
but told reporters, ``We're always active down in the Caribbean
anyway.''
   Cheney said he expects that within two weeks ``we will announce
in detail what additional steps we're taking in dealing with the
narcotics problem.'' He said he expects the Latin nations and
``anybody interested in halting the flow of illicit drugs into the
United States will be supportive.''
   Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said, ``We're not blockading Colombia. ... We always have ships in
international waters.''
   On ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,'' Scowcroft said
``We are looking at ways we might be able to improve interdiction
across the Caribbean.'' However, he said discussions with Colombian
authorities have not begun.
   ``There have been some difficulties,'' said Scowcroft, who
blamed them on ``some premature and ...probably inaccurate leaks
about what we had in mind.''
   ``The term that was in the paper, for example, is `blockade.'
Now, that's a very _ that's a warlike, negative term. What we would
be doing is _ if we did anything down there _ would be a
cooperative effort in conjunction with the countries there to help
get better control of the drug traffickers,'' said Scowcroft.
   ``I think it'll work out,'' he predicted.
   Pentagon sources said Saturday the JFK has been chosen to lead
an anti-drug interdiction effort off the Colombian coast, but final
decisions about when the warship may be put to work have not been
made.
   The JFK and an accompanying guided missile cruiser, the USS
Virginia, left Norfolk, Va., on Thursday for what the Pentagon said
were routine training exercises in the Atlantic.
   The White House acknowledged Dec. 28 that Bush had instructed
the U.S. military to draw up plans for interdicting drug supply
routes from South and Central America.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said then the final plans were still
being made, but added, ``We have decided to take certain actions to
help the countries of Latin America interdict these supply routes.''
   The New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that Colomian
officials were balking at the stationing of U.S. vessels off its
coast and had refused to meet last week with an American team sent
to explain the plan.
   The Times said the Pentagon wants to put ground-based radar
units in the mountains of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru, to be run by
Americans and military officers from those countries.
   The U.S. invasion of Panama on Dec. 20 to topple dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega has rekindled old fears in Latin America about U.S.
intervention in the region.
   Bush is scheduled to attend a drug summit Feb. 15 in Cartagena,
Colombia, with the presidents of Colombia, Brazil and Peru.
Peruvian President Alan Garcia, who said after the Panama invasion
he would not attend the summit, announced Sunday he will go if the
United States withdraws its troops from Panama by then.
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, went to St. John's Church across
Lafayette Square from the White House with the president's sister,
Nancy Ellis, widowed just nine days earlier.
   Afterwards, while Mrs. Bush went for her daily swim in the White
House's heated, outdoor pool, Bush and his younger sister drove to
the C&amp;0 Canal where she walked and he walked and jogged.
   ``Three-mile run, two-mile walk,'' Bush boasted as he finished
his nearly hour-long regimen beside the nearly frozen canal. He was
clad against the 39-degree chill in a blue Houston Astros baseball
jacket, sweatpants and cap.
   Mrs. Ellis' husband, Alexander Ellis II, a Massachusetts
insurance executive, died of a massive stroke on Dec. 29 at age 67.

<HEAD>At Least 6,000 Killed in Sri Lanka in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 6,000 people were killed in
Sri Lanka in 1989 in political violence associated with an uprising
by ultra-nationalist Sinhalese and a rebellion by Tamil
separatists, military officials say.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said at
least 500 people were killed each month as the Sinhalese militant
movement gained momentum and Tamil rebels turned their guns against
other members of their ethnic minority.
   The officials were speaking in response to a newspaper report
published Sunday that said at least 12,000 people were killed
during the year. The Sunday Times said an average of 1,000 people
died each month, quoting unidentified military sources.
   The Tamil separatist revolt, which began in 1983, has claimed at
least 11,000 lives. At first, the Sri Lankan army tried to quell
the secessionist campaign. Then Indian peacekeeping troops made an
attempt.
   The fighting now appears to have shifted to a battle for control
of Tamil-dominated regions of the country between the rebels and
moderates who accept regional autonomy in exchange for giving up
the seccessionist campaign.
   The Indian soldiers are scheduled to leave Sri Lanka by March
31, ending a military deployment that began in July 1987 after
abortive peace overtures to the rebels by the Colombo government.
   The overtures, coupled with the Indian military presence,
spawned a backlash by ultra-nationalist Sinhalese militants that
has escalated into an uprising against the government.
   The Sinhalese movement, launched in 1987, has claimed at least
6,000 lives. The killings include hit-and-run attacks on government
supporters by the militants and revenge killings of suspected
militants by pro-government vigilante groups.
   Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,
while Tamils account for 18 percent.
   Tamils launched their separatist agitation amid complaints that
the Sinhalese majority, which controls the government and military,
discriminates against them in jobs and education.

   The Cincinnati Reds gave outfielder Eric Davis
a three-year, $9.3 million contract Sunday that includes
performance bonuses that could make him the highest-paid player in
baseball.
   Davis, 27, will make $9.3 million over three years in base
salary, which includes a $1.5 million signing bonus. His agent,
Eric Goldschmidt, said Davis also can make additional performance
bonuses of $250,000 a year for winning Gold Glove, Silver Slugger
and National League Most Valuable Player honors.
   Although the average base salary of $3.1 million leaves Davis
behind Mark Davis' annual salary of $3.25 million as the highest in
baseball, the performance bonuses could boost him above that and
set a new high-water mark.
   Davis won all three honors last season by batting .281 with 34
homers and a career-high 101 runs batted in. He won his third
consecutive Gold Glove, Silver Slugger honors, and was chosen the
team's MVP for a season in which he made roughly $1.5 million.
   ``We trust that the signing of Eric Davis speaks for itself and
becomes a bellwether of things to come and indicates to the
baseball world that the Reds are in the hunt,'' General Manager Bob
Quinn said.
   Davis, a Los Angeles native, said Sunday he wanted to stay in
Cincinnati all along, as long as he could get an agreeable contract.
   ``It's something I wanted to do deep down in my heart, to stay
in Cincinnati,'' Davis said. ``I've always stated that this is my
home away from home.''

   As a boy growing up on a western
Minnesota dairy farm, Calvin Sperling would comb the Douglas County
countryside collecting bits of plants and trees.
   Today, he travels the globe for the U.S. government, searching
for hundreds of rare and threatened plants that scientists say
could help feed the planet and save American farmers billions of
dollars.
   As a plant explorer and botanist for the Agriculture Department,
Sperling leads the government's efforts to find seeds of endangered
species of plants that scientists may someday use to produce better
varieties of food crops.
   Sperling hunted for wild lentils and chickpeas in Turkey last
spring. He has explored forests in the interior of the Soviet Union
for wild apples, gone to Israel to collect wild wheat and searched
South American jungles for potato relatives.
   ``I've always had an interest in what was over the next hill,
you might say,'' Sperling said in a recent interview at his office
at USDA's Agricultural Research Service.
   The future of commercial agriculture could depend on what
Sperling finds.
   While whole species of plants are threatened with extinction,
scientists need seeds, or germplasm, from existing, sometimes wild,
varieties of plants to breed the hardier, higher-yielding crops
farmers need.
   Sperling's expeditions provide ``the raw material for
biotechnology,'' says Donald Falk, director of Harvard University's
Center for Plant Conservation.
   ``Biotechnology is the future of global agriculture. Global
agriculture is the future of being able to feed 10 billion
people,'' Falk said.
   What Sperling does is so critical to the future of agriculture,
Fortune magazine Jan. 1 named him one of the year's 25 ``most
fascinating business people.''
   In his starched shirt and silk tie, the well-coiffed 32-year-old
hardly looks like a botanist who spends weeks at a time crawling
through brush and jungles in some of the world's most remote
regions.
   But Sperling has had an insatiable curiosity about wild plants
since he was 12. The Alexandria, Minn., native moved from his
obsession with Douglas County flora to study botany at North Dakota
State University, later earning advanced degrees in biology at
Harvard.
   He joined the Agriculture Department as a research assistant
three years ago and was given a permanent position last year as the
only plant explorer in USDA's Germplasm Services Laboratory.
   It's Sperling's job to determine the government's priorities for
locating the seeds that should be added to its already extensive
collection.
   More than 250,000 seed samples are kept in cold storage at
USDA's National Seed Storage Laboratory in Fort Collins, Colo.;
other samples are stored at an additional 40 locations around the
country.
   ``A lot of what we do is literally banking. We're saving things
that we may need tomorrow,'' Sperling said. ``We need to preserve
as much diversity as we can so it's available.''
   Seeds arrive at Fort Collins from a variety of sources in
addition to Sperling's expeditions: other scientists, farmers, seed
companies, foreign countries and gardeners. Among the billions of
seeds in the collection are soybeans from China, rice from Japan
and corn from Brazil.
   At proper temperatures, seeds can survive 100 years or more.
   What seeds USDA scientists can obtain through exchanges with
foreign governments, they do. What they can't, it's Sperling's
responsibility to find.
   He may go himself, as he did with his trip to the Soviet Union
last year for wild apple seeds and cuttings that could lead to
hardier varieties of the fruit. Or Sperling may provide money and
technical assistance to university researchers.
   Sperling spends a quarter of the year in the field, the rest
deciding what should be collected next.
   His list of priorities runs from wild cranberries and grapes in
the United States to wild wheat in North Africa and alfalfa in
southwest Asia.
   Cranberries, for example, are one of the few crops native to
America, but scientists have never fully surveyed the various wild
varieties for their useful genetic traits, Sperling said.
   ``The best cranberry relish I've had was made from cranberries
in Minnesota,'' he said.
   Harvard's Falk thinks USDA's plant exploration is still vastly
underfunded, but he says Sperling has succeeded in steering the
government's efforts to a wider variety of crops.
   ``One thing he has done with the program is branch into a lot of
new crops,'' Falk said. ``Traditionally the government would ...
make sort of a half-hearted investment. Now there's a much more
aggressive program for a broad range of plant materials.''

   Despite the Bush administration's declared war
on drugs, fewer than 10 percent of the nation's cities report
making headway in their local battles, according to a survey
released today.
   ``There's been a lot of talk about drugs coming out of
Washington, and our city leaders are now sending back a message _ a
message that it's time for Washington to get a front-line report on
what's happening and what's needed,'' Alan Beals, executive
director of the National League of Cities, said in releasing the
study.
   ``The drug issue must be a national priority, local officials
are saying, because they cannot beat it on their own,'' he said.
   Officials in 58 percent of cities surveyed said drug problems
had worsened in their communities over the past year. Another 31
percent said the magnitude of the drug problem remained the same,
while only 9 percent reported progress.
   The league surveyed elected municipal officials _ mayors and
council members _ from 314 cities selected randomly from the 2,461
cities with a population of 10,000 or more. The survey included
questions on a variety of topics.
   Officials in 39 percent of the cities said they would have to
raise local taxes this year.
   Nearly half expect to increase various user fees, and almost
two-thirds say their city's spending will increase, Beals said.
   The league survey was conducted by telephone in November and
early December by the Center for Urban Studies at Wayne State
University in Detroit. The league said the results have a margin of
error of plus or minus 5.5 percentage points.
   Drugs led the list of top concerns of city officials. One in
five said that if they could meet with Bush on any topic, they
would focus on drugs.
   ``Clearly our local leaders believe there is a need for national
leadership and a stronger commitment of national resources to help
eradicate the poisonous and violent drug culture that has invaded
our cities,'' Beals said.
   The survey, he said, found discontent among urban leaders with
the federal government's allocation of money to fight drugs. The
$2.2 billion in federal drug assistance goes to the states, he
said, ``but it's needed in our cities where the war against drugs
is being fought.''
   He said the survey found nearly half, 47 percent, described
relations with their state government as ``fair'' at best, 22
percent said they were ``poor,'' and 28 percent said ``good.''
   Other top concerns cited by the city officials as needing
presidential attention were financial constraints and the lack of
federal aid to go with federally required local programs, solid
waste and other environmental problems, education and affordable
housing.
   Besides drugs, city leaders reported worsening conditions
involving the cost of living, affordability of housing, energy
costs, crime and solid waste.

   Actor Denzel Washington says his starring role
as a black Union soldier in the motion picture ``Glory'' helped him
renew his pride in his country.
   He said that before he read the script, he was unaware of black
soldiers' important role in the Civil War.
   ``In every class I ever took, the fact that some 200,000 black
men fought was never mentioned,'' he says in this week's People
magazine. ``You can go as far as saying that if they hadn't fought,
the North may not have won. I think it's especially good for black
Americans to know this, kids who don't necessarily feel that
they're a part of this country.
   ``Making this film has made me more patriotic, as corny as that
sounds,'' he said.
   ``Glory,'' the story of an all-black Civil War regiment, has won
critical acclaim. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association recently
nominated it for five Golden Globes.

   Filmmaker and Vietnam veteran Oliver Stone,
after making two movies on the war, is preparing a film on a man he
calls a warrior _ Jim Morrison, the late lead singer of the rock
group the Doors.
   Stone, who made the Academy Award-winning motion picture
``Platoon'' and ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' said even though
the Doors embraced war protesters, Morrison was a soldier on a
different front.
   ``In his own way, he was very much on the front line. He was a
warrior,'' Stone said recently. ``He was an outlaw rebel pushing at
boundaries. A searcher who wrote about sex and death, two things
any guy who'd been in Vietnam could relate to.''
   The as-yet-untitled movie, which will released in March,
presents a mine field of obstacles for Stone, such as explaining
Morrison's mysterious death of a heart attack at age 27 in 1971 and
contract stipulations from the Morrison estate limiting exploration
of Morrison's family life.
   ``Ideally, I would rather not be involved in this movie,'' he
said.
   So why is he?
   ``The fact is, I can't help myself. I've become obsessed with
Morrison.''

   Tom Cruise never complained as he slept on
the ground, dug fox holes and went without showers during filming
of ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' says an actor who played
alongside the star.
   Ben Wright, 20, of Carmel, has a small role in the movie about
Vietnam veteran Ron Kovic's struggle of coming home from the war as
a paraplegic.
   Wright said Cruise was one of the boys in the weeks of training
by Marines.
   ``We were digging fox holes. Cruise was digging right beside us.
He went all out and did everything we did,'' Wright said.
   Kovic's presence on the set was powerful, he said.
   ``You think it is just a film then you look over at him and
realize that he lived it,'' Wright said.

   British singer Phil Collins knows he doesn't

   ``I don't like to think of myself as a star,'' Collins said
recently. ``It makes me nervous. When you start thinking in star
terms, you start thinking you're better than everybody else.''
   Collins, whose latest solo album ``...But Seriously'' hit the
top of the charts three weeks after its release, said his success
has little to do with his appearance.
   ``Do I look like someone who's going to set feminine hearts
aflutter?'' asked the balding 38-year-old.
   But the author of eight No. 1 tunes during the past decade and a
member of the rock group Genesis bristles when critics call him a
lightweight on social issues.
   Many media critics said his recent No. 1 hit, ``Another Day in
Paradise,'' was unconvincing.
   ``How dare these critics say I don't know what I'm talking
about. I know what I see for myself, what I read about and see on
TV. I don't have to be homeless to be touched by what's happening
to these people,'' he said.

   Christina Orr-Cahall, who came
under fire for canceling an exhibition of homosexual photographs in
a Washington, D.C., museum, was named the new director of the
Norton Gallery.
   The board of the West Palm Beach gallery announced she will take
over on July 1.
   Ms. Orr-Cahall, 42, announced her resignation as director of the
venerable Corcoran Gallery of Art last month. Her decision in June
to cancel an exhibition of works by the photographer Robert
Mapplethorpe drew harsh criticism from the arts community.
   She has said she canceled the show to avoid embroiling the
Corcoran in a congressional battle over grant-making policies of
the National Endowment for the Arts.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., had attacked the endowment, an
independent federal agency, for underwriting the Mapplethorpe show,
which contained homoerotic and sadomasochistic images.
   Brant Snyder, Norton's board president, said the board voted
unanimously to hire Ms. Orr-Cahall. ``Her situation in Washington
just opened an opportunity for us,'' he said.

   The Queen Mary's owner, Walt Disney Attractions, has banned
facial hair on all crew members. The policy recently prompted the
firing of the first officer and several other mustachioed employees.
   But the prince didn't make a fuss during Friday's ribbon-cutting

<HEAD>VA Considering Ending Mobile Home Loan Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Veterans Affairs Department is hinting it
will try to pull out of the mobile home loan business this year,
saying a high default rate among active-duty members of the armed
services has compounded its losses.
   The program, begun in 1971 to help Vietnam veterans returning to
civilian life, is popular among junior members of the armed forces
who want to buy homes near bases for themselves and their fledgling
families.
   Personnel on active duty are considered veterans for purposes of
the program.
   More than half the 31,000 mobile home loans made since 1984 have
gone to such active-duty personnel, the VA says. During the same
period, the agency has had to pay some $147 million to lenders as a
result of 17,000 claims on mobile homes.
   The VA inspector general, in a pair of reports in September and
October, said the program has suffered from defaults by borrowers
in depressed oil-producing states and by military personnel who
abandon their property after transfers.
   The reports emphasized the problem with active-duty borrowers.
   Charles C. Partridge, legislative counsel for the National
Association of Uniformed Services, a multiservice advocacy group,
says that is unfair.
   He blames a ``chicken-coop mentality'' in the Defense Department
that ignores the housing needs of soldiers and the lack of programs
to help them make sound purchasing decisions or help them relocate.
   ``The guy gets an order for Korea, what's he going to do?''
Partridge asked. ``The DOD says `You bought it, you've got to sell
it.'''
   That problem may be helped with the implementation of a
relocation program mandated for this year by Congress.
   The Pentagon says there is nearly always a shortage of on-base
housing, making alternatives necessary. A mobile home mortgage
averages about $23,000, compared with $73,000 for a site-built home.
   The recommendation to end the program is contained both in the
September inspector general's report on the program and in an
inspector general's audit of the entire department a month later.
The September report was made available only recently.
   Both reports clearly state that R. John Vogel, VA head of
benefits, agreed to propose legislation in 1990 to end the program.
   However, recently asked directly about the timetable for such a
proposal, the VA's Keith Pedigo said only that the idea was ``under
active consideration,'' with a final decision expected by the end
of January.
   ``We've assessed the report, and we believe that given the
pitfalls of owning a manufactured home that most veterans would be
better off not availing themselves of this benefit,'' said Pedigo,
who reports to Vogel as director of the VA's loan guaranty service.
   ``The top purchaser of a manufactured home is an E-3 or E-4
stationed at Fort Bragg (N.C.),'' Pedigo said. ``One-and-a-half
years later he's rotated on his duty assignment to Germany or
somewhere else.''
   E-4s are the top grade of enlisted personnel _ corporals,
seamen, airmen and Specialist 4s _ and make about $950 a month.
Those who live off base receive a housing allowance of $314 a month
and a monthly food allowance of less than $150, tax free. There are
additional allowances based on regional costs.
   The 1988 poverty level was slightly more than $12,000 a year for
a family of four, although military personnel have benefits and
privileges _ such as free medical and dental care _ in addition to
pay.
   Pedigo said the trouble begins when a transferred soldier,
unable to sell the mobile home, abandons it. However, he could not
explain why the 1988 annual report of the VA cited military
transfers as the cause of only about 4 percent of foreclosures.
   ``Extensive obligations'' and ``curtailment of income'' were the
most frequently cited reasons.
   Veterans organizations, armed services advocacy groups and the
mobile home industry acknowledge flaws in the program, but argue
against throwing out the baby with the bath water.
   The pitfalls cited by the report include rapid depreciation of
mobile homes and a system that includes less durable items such as
furniture and other accessories in the invoice price, inflating the
value of the mortgage in relation to the value of the trailer.
   Under the VA program, private lenders make the mobile home
loans, with 40 percent of the amount up to $20,000 guaranteed by
the government. The program has guaranteed more than 112,000 loans
valued at more than $2 billion.
   Recent efforts have been made to strengthen the program,
including a 5 percent down-payment requirement and a debt-to-income
formula that borrowers must meet.
   The September report noted foreclosure rates of 28 percent to 40
percent from 1980 to 1989 in Colorado, Louisiana, Oklahoma and
Texas, all energy-producing states.
   The average foreclosure rate since the program began in 1971 is
27 percent, the inspector general says; the comparable rate for
``site-built'' homes is 5 percent since that home-loan program
began in 1944 to help returning GIs from World War II.
   The oil-patch depression has also caused problems and large
losses in the VA's regular home-loan program, which has been
criticized by the inspector general's office and the private
mortgage industry.
   The inspector general's September report says only 19 percent of
the Vietnam-era veteran population and 18 percent of the veteran
population overall are served by the six regional offices with the
most loan guarantees since 1984: St. Petersburg; Winston-Salem;
Waco, Texas; Houston; Atlanta; and Columbia, S.C.

   President Bush's triumph over Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega temporarily obscures serious foreign policy
problems that will make Bush's second year in the White House a
time of difficult decisions.
   Like bills and tax forms arriving after the New Year, the glow
of burgeoning democracy in Eastern and Central Europe is tempered
by economic, political and nationalist concerns.
   The acclaim accorded Bush in Congress and by the public for
flushing Noriega out of the Vatican Embassy in Panama makes little
difference to Latin Americans concerned that the United States is
reverting to a turn-of-the-century policy of military intervention
that provokes anger and resentment.
   Those concerns explain Bush's decision to send Vice President
Dan Quayle to the region _ as a personal emissary of assurances
that Yankee Imperialism has not come back.
   Back home, Bush must juggle the need to provide aid to Panama _
damaged economically first by Noriega's regime and then by the U.S.
intervention _ in the context of emerging democracies in Eastern
Europe and a budget that has little or no room for new spending on
foreign aid.
   Far more pressing and complicated than Panama is the situation
in Central and Eastern Europe. The revolution that swept old-line
Communist leaders from power in Poland, Hungary, East Germany,
Czechoslovakia and Romania largely met the U.S. test of peaceful
transition. Moreover, the new leaders are flirting in one way or
another with capitalism _ to the delight of the business-minded
Bush administration.
   The economic crash program in force in Warsaw is making this a
hard winter for Poles. Electricity for households is up 400
percent, bread prices have jumped by 38 percent and coal for
households by 600 percent.
   The government has ended almost all price controls and Poland is
bracing for a surge of inflation _ without an increase in workers'
wages.
   The $938 million in U.S. aid that Congress has authorized over
three years to Poland and Hungary might cushion the impact of the
painful drive to create the first market-oriented economy in
Eastern Europe, but the White House faces increased pressure from
Poland's constituents in America to do more.
   In Romania and, to an extent, in East Germany, the mood is mean.
   The summary execution of Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena,
and then the arrest of all the members of the Romanian Politburo
suggest the victims of the old regime intend to even the score.
   In East Germany, there are also signs of retribution that
Secretary of State James A. Baker III found ominous on his visit to
Potsdam last month. So far, the main targets are former officials
accused of corruption.
   If the attacks spread, there could be at least two consequences:
ethnic clashes in a revival of old nationalist animosities and an
interruption or even a reversal of the rebuilding of the Eastern
economies.
   Senior Bush administration officials see almost no likelihood
that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, trying to cope with his
own problems in the Baltics and in some of the southern republics,
would use Soviet troops against the revolutionaries.
   However, if Soviet troops in East Germany were attacked,
pressure would mount on Gorbachev to protect them.
   Apart from limited economic aid, the Bush administration is
trying a variety of approaches to keep the lid on and the reform
progressing. It supports stronger ties between the Eastern
countries and the European Community of Western Europe. It has
called for international monitoring of elections and is using
visits such as Baker's to East Germany as signs of supports.
   Summing up the situation, a senior U.S. official commented:
``1989 was clearly a year of tremendous achievement. The Soviets
lifted the hand of oppression, and for that we are appreciative.
But the key role was the role of the people, primarily attributable
to the people.
   ``Once people have begun to secure their freedom we have to look
at how they are going to form their governments. That is an agenda
for the international community.''

<HEAD>EEC Plan Could Help U.S. Exporters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Agriculture Department analysts say the
1992 plan by the European Economic Community to bring a
single-market approach to the 12-nation trading bloc could mean
benefits to American exporters, including farmers.
   ``A growing (EEC) economy with reduced internal barriers should
reduce business costs, stimulate increased efficiency, create new
wealth and encourage the growth of U.S. exports,'' said Richard B.
Helm and Clay M. Hamilton of the department's Foreign Agricultural
Service.
   The analysts, writing in the January issue of AgExporter
magazine, added: ``This should mean an expanded market as long as
the community does not raise new barriers to compensated member
states that may be hurt by the liberalized market.''
   Helm and Hamilton said the 1992 goal to ``harmonize'' tax and
non-tariff differences among member countries in the EEC will
include directives to carry out the plans. It's hoped that U.S.
agricultural exports will benefit as existing national laws imposed
without scientific justification are removed.
   ``However, depending on how the 1992 directives are drafted and
implemented, U.S. producers may have to adapt their products or be
restricted from the (EEC) market as a result of the harmonized
standards,'' the report said.
   Food and drink comprise the biggest industry in the EEC and is
``probably the one that would benefit most from a single market,''
the report said. A recent study by the bloc's commission identified
more than 200 non-tariff barriers in the food sector, including
requirements for labeling, packaging and ingredients.
   ``If harmonized food standards are to be put in place, these
measures should be abolished by the end of 1992,'' the report said.
``However, trade barriers in this area may be difficult to
eliminate because of traditional protectionist pressures or a
desire to maintain self-sufficiency.''
   The EEC for many years has ranked as a major foreign buyer of
U.S. agricultural products. Exports to the bloc in the year that
ended Sept. 30 were valued at $6.6 billion, second only to Asia as
a regional foreign market for American farmers.

   Most ``specialized'' hog farmers had little to
squeal about in 1987, a new Agriculture Department study shows.
   The department's Economic Research Service said U.S. farms had
$10.3 billion in cash receipts in 1987, the most since 1982.
   About 90,000 of the nation's 2.2 million farms had at least half
of their production in hogs in 1987. And about 41 percent of those
_ 36,700 hog farms _ reported at least $40,000 worth of total
agricultural production that year.
   These 36,700 farms met the agency's definition of specialized
hog operations as used in the study.
   ``Only 18 percent of all U.S. farms that produced any hogs were
classified as specialized hog farms, but they produced over 65
percent of the hogs in the United States,'' the report said.
``Hogs, in turn, amounted to about 76 percent of the specialized
hog farms' value of production in 1987.''
   By contrast, the 53,000 farms that specialized in hogs but had
total production of less than $40,000 in 1987 accounted for less
than 5 percent of the total U.S. hog sales.
   ``The remaining 30 percent of hog sales were from 115,000 farms
with over $40,000 total production but for which hogs were only a
minor enterprise,'' the report said.
   In their analysis, USDA economists Robert Dubman and Gregory
Hanson said that net returns _ described as ``the principal short
run measure of financial health'' _ averaged $36,376 for all
specialized hog farms in 1987. And that average included 14 percent
of the total farms that reported net losses that year.
   ``Net returns for specialized hog farms were higher than for
specialized cattle and dairy farms,'' the report said.
   The average net returns for dairy and cattle farms were shown at
$26,541 and $19,616, respectively.

   Agriculture Department scientists have
pinpointed the natural chemicals that make a ripened peach smell so
good.
   Chemists Robert J. Horvat, James A. Robertson and Glenn W.
Chapman Jr., identified five specific compounds from tree-ripened
fruit that, when mixed together in the proper quantities, are
essential to that tantalizing peach smell.
   The scientists work for the department's Agricultural Research
Service at the horticultural laboratory in Athens, Ga. A report
about their studies was released here.
   Among other things, the scientists found that the best smelling
peaches have to be less than four hours from the tree. But most
commercial growers have to pick the fruit ``a little on the green
side'' to the peaches can be shipped to market before they get soft
or overly ripe, Horvat said.
   Eventually, he said, the studies may show when peaches can be
picked for the best compromise between shelf life and aroma.
   ``But for real peach aficionados, the only answer to a perfect
smelling peach may be a peach tree in the back yard,'' Horvat said.

   BEN-GURION AIRPORT, Israel (AP) _ Dressed in heavy overcoats and
fur hats, clutching babies and bulky suitcases, the new Soviet
immigrants are arriving in the Promised Land.
   Most are driven to leave the Soviet Union because of a poor
quality of life and limited opportunities, anti-Semitism and a
desire to taste freedom while the door stays open.
   But unlike the first waves of Soviet Jewish immigrants, few of
the newcomers consider themselves pioneers ready to sacrifice
everything to build a nation for the Jewish people.
   Many are driven to Israel only by the recent U.S. immigration
restrictions.
   ``I can't call myself a Zionist. There was nothing of Jewish
tradition in my family,'' said Mikhail Weinrub, 28, who arrived
recently with his wife Rita, 31, and two children.
   The influx, which Jewish Agency officials say could total 1
million by the end of the decade, could offset a downward trend in
Jewish population growth and have a dramatic impact on society and
politics.
   In 1989, Soviet emigration reached a record 71,509 of which
11,994 settled in Israel and most of the rest in the United States.
Israeli officials predict up to 50,000 will arrive in the Jewish
state this year.
   Newcomers are led into Ben-Gurion's immigration hall, with its
orange and green plastic chairs, aging posters of Israeli tourist
sites and handwritten signs proclaiming in Russian, ``All Jews are
brothers.''
   The Weinrubs, both hydro-geologists from the Black Sea port of
Odessa, said they had long nurtured a dream of leaving the Soviet
Union, largely because of anti-Semitism and economic hardship.
   But going to Israel did not seem remotely possible.
   ``There were no links with Israel at all. ... People were afraid
even to speak of it,'' Weinrub said.
   Weinrub, weary from a sleepless night at Moscow's Sheremetyevo
Airport, a bus trip through Budapest and a night flight to Israel,
listed the reasons for emigrating as his blond wife Rita paced
nervously, cradling 18-month-old Nella.
   In Odessa, the family lived in a single room in a communal
apartment shared by other families. The windows looked onto a
narrow, dark passageway between two adjacent houses.
   The only way to move out was to prove the room was dark and be
placed on a waiting list for a new apartment in 10 to 15 years. But
first they needed a ``certificate of darkness'' from officials who
demanded a bribe that amounted to several years' salary, or about
$460 to $780.
   Instead of seeking their own place to live, they moved to a
two-room apartment they shared with Weinrub's parents, then to an
apartment with Rita's parents and finally lived with Weinrub's aunt.
   Two years ago, emigration restrictions were lifted and their
life took a new turn.
   They found a distant relative in Israel who was saved by
Weinrub's grandmother from hunger during World War II. She provided
an invitation, which is needed to start emigration procedures.
   Early in July, the Weinrubs applied to emigrate. They received a
visa in October. Their parents, who stayed behind, helped the
couple raise the $1,500 in rubles they needed to cancel their
Soviet citizenship and make the trip.
   In Odessa, there was also concern in the Jewish community about
anti-Semitic slogans shouted in the streets from right-wing youths
and tensions with Ukrainians over housing.
   ``Some literary magazines, like Moscow and Nash Sovremennik, are
simply anti-Semitic,'' Weinrub said. ``There, we read speeches from
a gathering of Russian Federation writers, and they declared they
were not anti-Semitic, they only hated Jews. This was very
unpleasant.''
   Other immigrants also listed anti-Semitism as a major motive
behind the exodus.
   ``There was anti-Semitism, of course. ... Just now, we heard
that a pogrom was about to take place on the date of some official
holiday, and the Jews stayed home for two days. Do you remember how
I was hiding you in the house?,'' said Brocha Much, 75, from
Khmelnitzkiy near Kiev, turning to her small grandson.
   ``We got out only after the radio started to deny that there is
going to be a pogrom,'' she said.
   Most immigrants interviewed said they did not believe Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms will succeed.
   ``Living standards have dropped, national tensions increased and
the economy deteriorated during perestroika,'' Weinrub said of
Gorbachev's reform program. ``I don't believe it would be
successful.''
   For him, the United States was never an option, in part because
he was put off by letters from friends and relatives who had gone
to America.
   ``I know what America is like. What Israel is like nobody knows
and that's interesting,'' he said. ``I was very impressed by the
fact that Israel has managed to achieve such a level in just 40
years.''
   The reasons are different for everyone. For Roman Kopelovitch,
an athletic 24-year-old engineer from Minsk, it was the environment.
   ``Yes, ecology. I'm an optimist by nature, and I don't believe
in Jewish pogroms. The situation in Minsk was quite pleasant and
stable,'' he said.
   ``But there is radiation,'' he said, referring to fallout from
the April 1986 accident at the Chernobyl nuclear reactor, some 200
miles from Minsk. ``The food products are poisoned by nitrates and
hydrates, and nobody cares.''
   Kopelovitch, waiting in line to see an immigration officer in a
tiny airport cubicle, said he preferred Israel because he brought
along ``a sick mother and a small child. I would not be able to
support them in the United States.''
   Surveying the immigrant-packed hall, where newcomers were
filling out typed forms, children played or slept in the chairs and
a youth from Uzbekistan clutched a cage of homing pigeons, he said:
   ``People are just fleeing from the Soviet Union. From everyday
hardships, anti-Semitism, and other troubles. A minority is driven
by ideology.''
   ``But there is something else. You keep a lion in a cage and
then you open a door, and the lion leaps out. Maybe it was well-fed
in the cage, and who knows what will happen outside. But the lion
has been inside the cage for too long.''

   The average price for a gallon of gasoline
rose more than 4.5 cents during the past three weeks due mainly to
a cold snap that slowed production, an industry analyst said.
   ``There was a supply curtailment because of the weather,''
analyst Trilby Lundberg said Sunday.
   New taxes effective this month accounted for about one-quarter
cent of the overall increase, said Ms. Lundberg, who heads the
Lundberg Survey of nearly 5,000 gasoline stations nationwide.
   According to the survey, the average price for gasoline as of
Friday was $1.1095 per gallon, a 4.54 cent increase over the
previous period.
   The survey usually is issued every two weeks but took a one-week
break for the holidays.
   For self-service, the average prices were: regular unleaded,
99.37 cents; premium unleaded, $1.1699; regular leaded, 98.06 cents.
   For full service: regular unleaded, $1.2824; premium unleaded
$1.4162; regular leaded $1.2589.

<HEAD>Ford Plans Front-Seat Air Bags in All Cars</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will make front-seat air bags
standard on its cars by the mid-1990s, the company's vice chairman
said.
   Currently, Ford offers the safety devices and manual seat belts
as standard on the driver side of about 1 million, or half, its
Ford, Lincoln and Mercury cars.
   Passenger-side air bags are offered in some Lincolns.
   ``All of our tests have shown that when the passenger is
properly positioned with the active belt plus the use of the air
bag provides the greatest protection in the event of an accident,''
Vice Chairman Harold Poling said Sunday night.
   Chrysler Corp. offers driver-side air bags on all its North
American-made cars. General Motors Corp. has them standard on about
500,000 cars, or about 15 percent. GM has plans to more than double
that number in the 1991 model year.
   The federal government required that cars made after Sept. 1,
1989, be equipped with either a driver-side air bag and manual seat
belts for front-seat riders, or automatic seat belts.
   By 1993, automakers must supply passive restraint systems such
as air bags or automatic belts for front-seat riders.

the former Panamanian dictator had turned against the United
States, according to a new book.
   Journalist Frederick Kempe's book said the payments were made
even after Noriega bribed U.S. officials to obtain secret
intelligence tapes and was linked to bombings aimed at American
targets.
   Noriega had been ordered to ``stir things up'' by
then-Panamanian dictator Omar Torrijos, who hoped to pressure the
United States to speed talks on handing over the Panama Canal,
according to the book, ``Divorcing the Dictator.''
   At the same time, Noriega discovered an extensive U.S.
wiretapping operation in Panama and bribed American officials to
hand over copies of intelligence tapes, according to excerpts of
the book printed in this week's Newsweek magazine.
   When the affair came to light, Lew Allen Jr., then head of the
National Security Agency, wanted to send a message to other
would-be turncoats by prosecuting Noriega and others.
   ``But CIA director Bush balked,'' the book said. ``This was an
Army matter, he said, and the embarrassed Army had opted to keep
the lid on.''
   Bush not only let Noriega and the others go unpunished, he opted
to continue paying Noriega $110,000 annually ``for his CIA
liaison,'' wrote Kempe, who works for The Wall Street Journal.
   ``Even back in 1976, Bush realized that paying Noriega didn't
mean buying him,'' he wrote. ``New intelligence in the fall linked
Noriega to a chain of three bombings aimed at American property and
civilians.''
   The White House did not immediately return telephone calls for
reaction Sunday night.
   The book is to be published in March by G.P. Putnam's Sons.

   Lawyers for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega are
rejecting the idea of a plea bargain, saying they will go to trial
if they fail to have all drug charges dismissed.
   ``The government chose to bring General Noriega to trial and
they shall have their trial,'' Frank Rubino, one of several lawyers
defending the former Panamanian ruler against U.S. indictments,
said Sunday on ABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''
   Another lawyer, Steve Kollin, told CBS' ``Face the Nation'' that
prosecutors had not offered a plea bargain, nor had he sought one.
   ``General Noriega is innocent of these charges,'' Kollin said.
``Plea bargaining takes place when somebody is guilty, in my
opinion.''
   President Bush last week, however, did not rule plea bargaining
out as an option.
   And the Baltimore Sun reported in today's editions that the U.S.
government has made an offer to a co-defendant of Noriega as it
seeks to bolster its case against the former Panamanian strongman.
   The U.S. Attorney's office has made a ``very preliminary'' offer
to Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, a former key Panamanian Defense Forces
official who surrendered to U.S. authorities before Noriega sought
sanctuary in the Vatican Nuncio. Specifics of the offer were not
reported.
   Del Cid is accused of acting as liaison, courier and emissary
for Noriega in his transactions with drug dealers.
   Plea bargains usually result in a guilty plea to lesser charges
in exchange for information the government can use in other cases.
Such action would prevent a trial and release of documents
sensitive to national security or embarrassing to the government
that Noriega's lawyers might want for the defense.
   Noriega's attorneys would not say whether they had specific
secret federal documents in mind.
   ``The defense team here will file motions appropriate to
receiving that information, whatever information is necessary to
represent the general properly,'' Kollin said.
   Rubino said the defense had been concentrating on getting the
case dismissed and had not begun looking for evidence to clear
Noriega in a trial.
   ``This would all be speculation as to what the government may
have,'' Rubino said. ``One thing I have never done in 16 years of
practicing law is to guess what may happen.''
   Both he and Kollin said pretrial publicity has made it
impossible for Noriega to get a fair trial.
   ``Pretrial publicity is amazing in the amount,'' Rubino said.
``Not only the amount but the type of publicity.
   ``The president of the United States said (Noriega) was a thug
and purveyor of drugs to children. Obviously, how can someone
strike that from their mind and give this man a fair trial?''
   Rubino said he would argue that the case should be dismissed
because Noriega was ``maximum leader'' of Panama when he was seized
and therefore immune from U.S. prosecution as head of state in a
foreign country.
   ``The intention of this administration is to make sure that Mr.
Noriega gets a fair trial,'' John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff,
said on CBS.
   ``We ought not to do anything that creates a different category
for the defendant once he enters the judicial system,'' Sununu said
in response to a question about plea bargaining.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, who appeared on ABC,
said the administration was not worried about documents that could
embarrass the White House and wouldn't try to block them.
   He said, however, he didn't know if any documents existed
relevant to the case that might harm national security.
   ``As far as I know there aren't any,'' Scowcroft said. ``You had
the attorney general saying he didn't anticipate any problems of
that character. I don't know whether the files have been searched
to the ultimate.''
   He emphasized that the case against Noriega was based on drug
trafficking.
   ``That's a fairly narrow part of his whole relationship with the
United States,'' Scowcroft said.
   Noriega began providing intelligence information about Latin
America to the U.S. government in the 1950s, while a student at the
military academy in Peru.
   Questions about his drug dealing began while Richard Nixon was
president and have arisen repeatedly through both Republican and
Democratic administrations.
   However, Noriega's usefulness as an intelligence source always
appeared to overshadow the suspected drug dealing and no action was
taken until the recent indictments.

<HEAD>Some Episcopal Bishops Hope to Rebuke Colleague Who Ordained Gay
Priest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of Episcopal bishops are seeking
penalties against a colleague for ordaining an avowed homosexual as
a priest.
   Bishop William Wantland of Eau Claire, Wis., said he and other
bishops plan to formally charge Newark Bishop John S. Spong with
violating the church's doctrinal teachings.
   A minimum of 10 bishops is needed to support a formal charge
against a bishop. Wantland said he has ``far more'' than 10.
   Last month, Spong ordained gay Deacon J. Robert Williams into
the priesthood at the All Saints Episcopal Church in Hoboken.
   Church traditionalists said Spong violated a resolution of the
church's General Convention that declares the ordination of a
practicing homosexual to be inappropriate.
   Spong has said he considers the 1979 resolution adopted by the
church's governing body as advisory, not church doctrine.
   He noted that the resolution had been opposed by 20 bishops,
including Presiding Bishop Edmond L. Browning.
   In response to the planned charges, Spong said he welcomed any
inquiry into his actions.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange rose back after an early
setback Monday, while the U.S. dollar edged up against the Japanese
yen.
   The dollar closed at 144.52 yen, up 0.37 yen from Friday's close
of 144.15 yen. It started trading at 144.55 yen and ranged between
144.47 and 144.75 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, market's key index, regained
20.20 points for the day, or 0.05 percent, ending at 38,294.96.
   The index, a 438.12-point loser on Friday, lost 145.13 more
points during morning trading as a decline in bond prices
discouraged market players, but it rose back in the afternoon as
investment trust companies conducted index-related buyings, dealers
said.
   The Nikkei's plunge Friday, the largest single-day loss since a
647-point drop posted Oct. 16, followed news reports that Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev had canceled all foreign appointments.
   But Radio Moscow Saturday denied the reports, and former Foreign
Minister Shintaro Abe announced the same day that he had received a
formal invitation to meet with Gorbachev in Moscow Jan. 15.
   Instability in the foreign exchange market was also responsible
for sending the index lower, said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with
Nomura Securities Co.
   ``The U.S. Federal Reserve's stance _ whether it will move
toward easy monetary policy or not _ has not yet been made clear.
And this is making the exchange rate move nervously,'' he added.
   In currency dealings, the market sentiment for the dollar
remained strong since the dollar rose last Friday following the
Gorbachev rumor, but participants were reluctant to push the
currency higher as they were afraid of additional intervention by
the Bank of Japan, traders said.
   The central bank was seen selling some $100 million around
144.60 yen shortly after the Tokyo market opened Monday.
   Traders said dollar buying by institutional investors and export
firms for dollar-based account settlements kept the dollar strong.

<HEAD>World Bank and IMF Guide Shift from Communist Economies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern European governments trying to move
from communist economies are turning for guidance to a pair of
worldwide bodies based in Washington.
   They are the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund,
both owned by 152 countries that have many different mixes of
public and private ownership. The United States takes a leading
role in both organizations.
   A senior IMF official said last week that the fund is in contact
with all the major Eastern European countries.
   The Soviet Union has said it wants to join, but the United
States has opposed that, saying the country is far from a market
economy. Poland and Hungary are already members. The new
Czechoslovak government says it would like to be.
   Managing Director Michel Camdessus of France put the final
touches to an accord with Poland that has brought decontrol of
prices, a convertible currency and other measures the fund
traditionally advises.
   The fund and bank influence governments mostly through loans and
the conditions attached to them. They promote conservative
policies: sale of state-owned industry, reduced government
deficits, abolition of price controls, holddowns of wages,
promotion of exports and cuts in subsidies.

<HEAD>Market Weak on East European Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern European governments have fallen in
love with free markets, but at least one free market doesn't love
them.
   The more democratic governments that have taken over from the
hard-line communists in Eastern Europe are still liable for the
debts incurred primarily during the 1970s when Western bankers
thought the Soviet bloc was a good credit risk.
   But there is waning hope among Western financial dealers that
the loans will ever be paid in full, even as Western governments
are seeking ways to support the democracy movement so that Western
bankers and businesses will invest in Eastern Europe.
   Western bankers fear the new Eastern European governments will
set their sights more on internal development programs and less on
paying off old debts.
   The old debts of Poland and some other Eastern European
countries are bought on the so-called secondary market by
speculators who want to collect the interest still paid on them by
the borrowers.
   Speculators also hope that they can sell the debt at a higher
price or that some day the debtor government will pay in full.
   Polish debt was selling in July for as much as 41 cents on the
dollar of the debt's original value. But Friday, Polish debt was
selling at just 17.5 cents on the dollar, and the debts of Hungary
and Bulgaria have started to show signs of weakness.

<TEXT>
   A family ``just trying to help people''
began regrouping today from a fire that raced through their
eight-bedroom house, killing six foster children and an elderly
houseguest who had been homeless.
   The owners of the house, Robert and Lois Mitchell, escaped
unhurt from early Sunday's fire, said Barbour County Coroner David
Childs.
   The Mitchells were able to escape with their three children and
two other foster children.
   The Mitchells' daughter, Michelle, who helped her brothers
rescue the two children but failed to reach the others, said her
mother was extremely upset.
   ``All she can say is, `My babies are gone,''' the daughter said.
   The fire destroyed their large one-story house in rural east
Alabama
   The cause of the fire was under investigation, said state Fire
Marshal John Robison.
   Two girls and four boys were among the victims. Childs
identified them as Kimberly Gilbert, 8; her 10-year-old brother,
Jessie; Kimberly Walker, 5; and her brothers Larry, 10, Jessie, 7,
and Marketta, 4.
   Also killed was Florene Burgess, 66. The Mitchells had taken the
homeless woman in ``out of the goodness of their hearts'' at the
request of a judge, Childs said.
   ``This is a case of folks who were just trying to help people,''
Childs said. ``There is no indication of foul play. She took all
the children to church on Sunday and kept them in good shape and
all.''
   The children who died had been assigned there by the state
Department of Human Resources, Childs said.
   ``This is the worst tragedy I've ever seen,'' said Childs, who
has been coroner for three years. ``This is the most (deaths) we
have ever had in a house fire in Barbour County.''
   The coroner said Mrs. Mitchell told him she thought the fire
started near the hot water heater, adding that the home itself was
not being heated.
   Michelle Mitchell, 23, said she was able to wake her brothers,
Eric, 23, and Michael, 21. The three rescued Kevin Boyer, 2, and
Brenda Gilbert, 12 but couldn't get to the others.
   ``These children will always be in our memories. We loved them
like our own flesh and blood. We will miss them dearly,'' Miss
Mitchell said in tears.
   Mike Gibson, a spokesman for the state Department of Human
Resources, said he understood the house had smoke detectors. All
private foster homes in the state are inspected before they are
certified, he said.
   The Mitchells were licensed to care for the large number of
children at their home, one of 4,000 license private foster homes
in Alabama, said county District Attorney Sam LeMaistre Jr.
   ``I think the fact that you see so many children in homes is an
indication that we've got a shortage of foster homes not only in
Barbour County but in the state and across the nation,'' LeMaistre
said. ``Funds are limited for foster care.''

   The trial of an Ivy League student accused
of crippling thousands of computer systems nationwide is viewed by
computer security experts as a chance to garner support for tougher
anti-hacker laws.
   ``It's a no-lose situation because the trial will showcase the
weaknesses of computer security and current computer security
law,'' said Harold Highland, professor emeritus of computer science
for the State University of New York and editor of ``Computers &amp;
Security,'' a trade journal.
   Jury selection was to begin today in the first criminal trial
under the 1986 federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.
   Robert T. Morris Jr., a 24-year-old suspended Cornell University
graduate student, is accused of designing and setting loose a
computer ``worm'' that reproduced wildly in November 1988.
   The worm immobilized an estimated 6,000 computers linked to a
research network, including computers at the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration facility at Moffet Field, Calif., and the
Air Force Logistics Command at Wright Patterson Air Force Base,
Ohio.
   It was at Cornell that authorities said Morris gained access to
the Department of Defense network that connects thousands of
computers at military facilities, corporate research centers and
universities.
   A Cornell commission concluded that Morris was guilty of
``reckless disregard'' for creating the program. Although the
university commission found him responsible, Morris has never
admitted creating the program or introducing it into the system.
   Morris, of Arnold, Md., faces up to five years in prison and a
$250,000 fine if convicted.
   With arguments expected to begin later this week in U.S.
District Court, computer security experts say the trial will focus
attention on the need for more stringent computer tampering
legislation.
   ``If the government loses, (computer security advocates) will
say there is a need for stronger laws. If the government wins,
they'll say he did it because the system is weak and we need to
tighten up the system,'' Highland said.
   ``Either way it goes, the pure attention is going to fuel the
cry for tougher laws and better security,'' said Christopher A.
Breceda, a top officer with American Computer Security Industries
Inc., a Nashville, Tenn.-based maker of security systems with
worldwide sales.
   Eugene Spafford, an associate professor of computer science at
Purdue University who has written about the case and is expected to
be a government witness, said losses from computer crimes in the
United States total about $7 billion annually.
   ``Ten years ago, these kinds of things didn't hurt anybody, but
you have to realize now all the places where computers are used and
the dangers involved in shutting down a system or damaging data,''
he said.
   The worm allegedly created by Morris did not destroy any data
and prosecutors have not estimated the monetary damage from the
worm. But Spafford estimated the one-day paralysis cost between $5
million and $15 million in lost time and in later protective work.

   Texans won't elect a new governor until
November. But they're already being treated to a two-party shootout
in the primary contests.
   State GOP leaders boast they will put the 20th century's second
Republican in the Governor's Mansion. Democrats say Republican Gov.
Bill Clements' lease on the residence is a temporary one for the
party.
   The 72-year-old Clements' decision not to seek re-election
cleared the way for well-funded, wide-open races in both parties.
Pundits predict the election could cost $50 million.
   The candidates in the March 13 primaries include a millionaire
cowboy nicknamed ``Claytie''; the 1988 Democratic National
Convention keynote speaker; the man who helped organize a rescue
raid into Iran; and a former governor hoping for a comeback.
   ``The decade of the 1980s was characterized by some as the
decade of the emergence of the Republican Party in Texas,'' said
GOP Chairman Fred Meyer. ``We're looking forward to the decade of
the '90s being the emergence of the Republican Party as the
majority party of Texas.''
   Democratic chief Bob Slagle said that won't happen, not even if
popular U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm tops the GOP ticket.
   ``I think we're going to beat the daylights out of them, to put
it politely,'' he said.
   The Democratic field is headed by a well-known trio:
   _ Former Gov. Mark White, 49, a Houston lawyer, who was ousted
in a 1986 grudge match by Clements, the man White had beaten in
1982.
   _ State Treasurer Ann Richards, 56, who denounced
then-presidential candidate George Bush at the Democratic National
Convention for being ``born with a silver foot in his mouth'' and
is author of an autobiography that took her on a national talk show
tour last fall.
   _ Two-term Attorney General and former Congressman Jim Mattox,
46, who kicked off his campaign by calling for creation of a state
lottery.
   Leading Republicans are:
   _ Midland rancher and oilman Clayton ``Claytie'' Williams, 58,
who said he's willing to spend $3 million of his own money.
   _ Dallas lawyer Tom Luce, 49, an associate of billionaire H.
Ross Perot who organized a mission into Iran that rescued Perot
employees and was recounted in the book ``On Wings of Eagles.''
   _ Kent Hance, 47, chairman of the oil-regulating state Railroad
Commission, who won headlines worldwide by attending meetings of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   _ Jack Rains, 52, a Houston lawyer and businessman, former
secretary of state and campaign strategist for Clements in 1986.
   Former San Antonio Mayor Henry Cisneros and state Agriculture
Commissioner Jim Hightower were once considered likely candidates,
but Hightower is seeking re-election and Cisneros is out of
politics after questions were raised about his private life.
   As governor, White pushed through sweeping school reforms that
included a rule in which students with failing grades were banned
from extracurricular activities such as sports. He also signed a
$4.8 billion tax increase and raised more than $1 billion in
temporary sales taxes.
   Hance was one of the leaders of a conservative Democratic
coalition known as the ``Boll Weevils'' from 1978 to 1984. He quit
Congress to seek the Democratic U.S. Senate nomination and after
failing, switched parties in 1985.
   Ms. Richards, who has had celebrities such as Lily Tomlin and
Phyllis George helping her at fund-raisers, said her financial
skills are needed in a state severely battered by depressed real
estate and oil industries.
   ``You know, Sam Rayburn used to say that any jackass can kick
down a barn, but it takes a carpenter to build one,'' she said of
the longtime U.S. House speaker from Texas.
   The Democrats have signed a good-behavior pledge, while the
Republican candidates are bickering like Democrats of old.
   Hance said Williams, founder of the Claydesta long distance
phone company and other enterprises, isn't qualified. Williams is
``a good fellow to go fishing with, but he'd be a disaster'' as
governor, Hance said.
   Williams said Hance is worried about recent polls showing
Williams as the front-runner in a campaign where he has pledged a
``real war on drugs'' that includes a plan to send first-time
offenders to a military-style ``boot camp.'' Democrats haven't
stayed completely above the fray.
   Mattox, who said a lottery is the answer to the state's budget
problems, released a poll showing him leading White and Ms.
Richards.
   In response, Ms. Richards' staff distributed copies of a
phone-in survey in which 56 percent of respondents said they
believed Elvis Presley is still alive.

   Revolutionary changes sweeping Eastern
Europe have professors and textbook publishers scratching their
heads about keeping up with history in the making.
   It's a mind-boggling world for Soviet bloc specialists, said
Sovietologist Ben Eklof of Indiana University.
   ``And it's very stressful,'' he said. ``I've begun to wish
everyone over there would play baseball for a month or so and give
me some time to rethink things.''
   The campus confusion started as Soviet bloc governments began
toppling in last fall. College syllabuses had to be tossed out and
curricula overhauled.
   ``Some of my colleagues are waiting for things to settle down,
but they might as well give up waiting because I don't think that
will happen for another generation,'' said Adam Ulam, who directs
Harvard University's Russian Research Center.
   ``It's exciting and tiring at the same time,'' said Henry
Krisch, an author and professor at the University of Connecticut.
``It's as though someone in history has hit fast forward and
processes that normally take a long time are seen in a short
period.''
   Independent political journals and newspapers have blossomed in
Eastern Europe. Artists and theorists are speaking out. Scholarly
exchange and travel opportunities are opening.
   In many cases, U.S. professors have opted to use newspapers and
free-form classroom debate on current events instead of the
standard and now outdated texts.
   ``Right now I'm in a quandary as to whether to offer my course
again next fall because I'm not sure if anything of a permanent,
published nature will be available,'' said Edwin Gere, a professor
at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
   Publishers have similar problems. The books from which
generations of high school and college students learned about the
Soviet bloc suddenly need daily revision.
   ``The academic headaches are reflected in the publisher's
office,'' said Frederick Praeger, editorial director at Westview
Press Inc.
   ``You cannot publish books that deal with the current situation
in the Soviet Union or Eastern Europe because it changes just about
every day,'' Praeger said from his Boulder, Colo., office. ``On the
day you publish, the book is out of date.''
   Sam Gesumaria, a vice president at Macmillan-McGraw-Hill's
school division, said editors in his New York office had updated
various social studies texts repeatedly since November.
   ``All textbook publishers are faced with the same problem right
now,'' he said. ``The best we can do is give some sort of
information about these changes, but we have to stop short of being
conclusive because these events aren't done yet. And we have a long
way to go yet, I suspect.''
   The Warsaw Pact's transformation may continue for years, but
textbook publishers need to deal with an immediate bottom line.
They've got to find a way to keep up with the change if they want
to keep selling books.
   Eileen Peters, vice president of Scott Foreman and Co.'s
international division, said several publishing houses were
considering supplements for college survey texts.
   ``Professors can change their reading lists from semester to
semester,'' she said from her office in Chicago. ``It's critical to
have the books up to date, because professors are going to go with
the book that has these changes in it.''
   Robert V. Daniels, an author and retired University of Vermont
professor, said some of the scholars working on specialized texts
have been tempted to sit back and wait for the events to unfold.
But he rejected the practice.
   ``That's ivory tower thinking!'' the author of ``Is Russia
Reformable?'' said. ``We can't be concerned that current events
will spoil our neat conclusions. More than ever we need analyses of
where we are.''

<HEAD>Eritrean Insurgents Claim Attack On Two Polish Ships In Red Sea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A spokesman for the Eritrean rebels has
claimed responsibility for attacks on two Polish ships in the Red
Sea and says any ship carrying weapons to Ethiopia through the sea
will be subject to Eritrean fire.
   ``We were sure that one of the two Polish ships was carrying
arms to Ethiopia,'' the Eritrean Liberation Front spokesman,
reached by telephone in another Persian Gulf state, said Sunday.
   He said the Eritrean forces, who have been waging a three-decade
war for their region's independence from Ethiopia, fully back
freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.
   But this does not mean that ships carrying arms to Ethiopia will
be allowed to use the waterway ``especially those coming from
Israel,'' said the spokesman, speaking on condition his name not be
used.
   Forces hostile to Ethiopia, including the Sudanese government,
have charged that Israel is bolstering Ethiopia militarily with the
aim of undermining the regional Arab nations.
   Shipping sources, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Polish motor vessel Adam Asnyk came under fire from Red Sea
shores on Thursday. It had come upon another Polish ship _ Boleslaw
Krzywousty _ stranded and ablaze 50 miles from Massawa on the
Eritrean coast.
   ``The Israeli presence in Ethiopia is a source of grave danger
to the Eritrean revolution and so we will not hesitate to attack
any Israeli ship carrying weapons to Addis Ababa government,'' said
the source.
   He said that with the Soviet-Ethiopian friendship treaty
expiring this year, Israel will become the main supplier of
weapons, ammunition and military advisers to Ethiopia.
   The Israelis have replaced the Soviet and Cuban military
advisers and experts, he added.
   The source also threatened the international companies who
signed a $70 million contract with Ethiopia to expand the port of
Assab, saying their interests would be endangered. He did not
elaborate.

<HEAD>Tower of Pisa Closes; Repairs Could Take Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PISA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Leaning Tower, whose tilt draws hundreds
of thousands of tourists a year but could also spell its downfall,
has shut its doors for repairs that officials say could take years.
   Thousands of sightseers climbed the stairs of the 800-year-old
tower Sunday before Mayor Giacomino Granchi locked the doors and
expressed hope the marble wonder can be reopened soon. He
reluctantly signed an order in December authorizing the closure for
three months.
   But Public Works Minister Giovanni Prandini, who led the drive
to close the tower, told a nationwide television audience he
expected the tower needed to be closed for several years.
   ``It needs an urgent intervention,'' Prandini said, but conceded
there is no agreement yet on the best project to stabilize the
tower, which is a national symbol.
   The 180-foot tower, begun by Bonnano Pisano in 1173, started to
tilt almost immediately because the ground shifted underneath. The
tower now leans about 13 feet off the perpendicular.
   Technicians have said the tower shifted less last year than its
average annual tilt of the last three decades _ 0.03 inches
compared to an average 0.045 inches. Some experts say the tower
should stand at least a hundred more years.
   The tower is an important source of income for Pisa, attracting
about 800,000 tourists a year paying $2.80 apiece to climb the
spiral staircase.
   Several thousand tourists turned out Sunday, with an Italian
soldier the last to go up the 293 steps before the closing,
broadcast by government-run RAI-TV.
   ``The tower is an important asset which belongs to everybody,
including the international community. We must keep this in mind,''
said the mayor.
   ``We have decided to close the tower for three months to do what
has to be done. I don't think it will topple soon and should never
close. I ask the minister to take his responsibility.''
   Prandini, interviewed in the RAI studios, pledged that a project
will be selected by the end of this year but when asked when the
tower would reopen replied ``We are talking about a few years.''
   ``I can promise that I will do all I can to hasten the
re-opening.''
   One plan which has been well-received by government experts
calls for a wheel-shaped support to be planted around the base of
the tower. The support would be connected by concrete spokes to the
marble foundation.
   The Public Works Ministry is awaiting a report on soil
conditions to decide whether the plan is feasible.
   Experts agree the tower must retain its famed lean and not be
straightened.

<HEAD>Army Arrests Over 100 Suspects, Six Houses Demolished or Sealed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army today rounded up more than 100
Palestinians suspected of belonging to PLO-led ``strike forces''
and demolished or sealed six homes during the night, officials said.
   The arrests were made in sweeps of Arab villages near Ramallah
in the occupied West Bank, and the military said the detainees
belonged to a terrorist organization recently uncovered in the area.
   Some of the suspects belonged to strike forces organized by
Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah wing of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, an army official said.
   The strike forces are underground groups that enforce orders of
the PLO-linked underground leadership of the Palestinian uprising.
   Military officials said the group was responsible for the Oct. 7
killing of a Palestinian in the West Bank village of Deir Al-Sudan
who allegedly assisted Israeli authorities.
   They were also suspected of stabbing and wounding two other
alleged collaborators and of torching and firebombing Arab-owned
cars as punishment for helping Israel, said the officials who are
not identified in accordance with army regulations.
   Four houses of alleged strike force members in the Ramallah area
were sealed during the night, the officials said.
   The army defends its policy of house demolitions and sealings by
saying it serves as a strong deterrent against future unrest, but
it has been criticized by the U.S. government and human rights
groups in Israel and abroad as collective punishment.
   A study released Dec. 20 by the Tel Aviv University's Jaffee
Center for Strategic Studies disupted army claims that house
demolitions reduced violence. It found that in many cases such
measures inflamed the situation.
   At least 245 houses have been demolished and 120 sealed since
the uprising began 25 months ago, according to army figures.
   Palestinian activists have killed 166 Palestinians, most for
alleged collaboration, during the uprising against Israeli rule of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, seized in the 1967 Middle East War.
   At least 646 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli gunfire in
the uprising, and 43 Israelis have been slain.

<HEAD>Veteran Character Actor Arthur Kennedy Dead at 75</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRANFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Actor Arthur Kennedy, who was discovered
by Jimmy Cagney and excelled in movies such as ``Peyton Place'' and
``Lawrence of Arabia'' and on Broadway, has died of cancer at age
75.
   Kennedy died Friday evening at the Connecticut Hospice in
Branford, where he was admitted in October, said Allan Nixon, a
longtime friend and fellow actor.
   Kennedy, a five-time Oscar nominee, won a Tony Award for his
role as Biff in Arthur Miller's ``Death of a Salesman.''
   On stage in the 1940s, Kennedy achieved prominence as a
character actor in other Miller plays, appearing in ``The
Crucible,'' and ``All My Sons.''
   Among his film credits were ``The Glass Menagerie,'' ``Elmer
Gantry,'' and ``High Sierra.'' Kennedy also starred several Italian
and Spanish films during the 1960s and 1970s.
   In a memorable role as the crusty American correspondent Jackson
Bentley in ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' Bentley delivered an
off-the-cuff eulogy for T.E. Lawrence, saying: ``He was a poet, a
scholar and a mighty warrior. ... He was also the most shameless
exhibitionist since Barnum and Bailey.''
   Born Feb. 17, 1914, in Worcester, Mass., John Arthur Kennedy
attended the Carnegie Institute of Technology and was brought to
the attention of Hollywood producers by Cagney, who had seen him
perform on stage in Los Angeles.
   He made his film debut in 1940 as the prodigy brother for whom
Cagney sacrifices all in ``City For Conquest.''
   During World War II, Kennedy worked at Warner Bros., appearing
with Ronald Reagan and Errol Flynn in ``Desperate Journey,'' a 1942
film about three prisoners of war in Nazi Germany who fight their
way to freedom.
   Kennedy received Academy Award nominations for ``Champion''
(1949), ``Peyton Place'' (1957), ``Some Came Running'' (1959),
``Trial'' (1955) and ``Bright Victory.''
   Kennedy lived for many years in Los Angeles, but moved to
Savannah, Ga. in 1986.
   Kennedy once told reporters in Savannah that while he
occasionally watched one of his old movies on television, he didn't
go out of his way to do so.
   ``It's more or less out of curiosity to see what I looked
like,'' Kennedy said.
   He also expressed little interest in contemporary films, saying
the two ``Godfather'' films were the only admirable efforts that
came to mind.
   Kennedy added that he had no great admiration for the current
crop of actors either, although his daughter Laurie works as an
actress in New York.
   ``I think they're accomplishing nothing, playing the same part
over and over again, generally speaking. It has nothing to do with
acting and it doesn't add up to much. They don't gamble with their
careers.''
   He was to be buried alongside his late wife of 45 years, Mary,
at his farm in Nova Scotia, Nixon said.

<HEAD>Rain Soaks Northern California, South</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More stormy weather today headed toward the Pacific Northwest,
which has been battered by heavy rain and high winds since Saturday.
   The rain was welcome in Northern California but caused mudslides
and power outages and threatened flooding in Oregon and Washington.
   Rain also continued today in parts of the South and the
mid-Atlantic Coast. Rain caused flooding Sunday near Albany, Ga.,
washing out roads and forcing some evacuations, and along the South
Carolina coast, where debris left by Hurricane Hugo blocked drains
and culverts.
   In the Northwest, storms sent trees, branches and power lines
whirling and caused at least two deaths in Oregon _ an 11-year-old
girl struck by a falling tree and a 23-year-old man killed in a car
crash on a rain-slickened road.
   Flood warnings were in effect today along many Oregon rivers,
swollen by the weekend storms.
   Waves 22 feet were forecast along the Washington coast today.
Unseasonably warm temperatures threatened to add melting mountain
snow to rivers swollen by rain.
   In California, 6{ inches of rain fell Sunday in Shelter Cove,
while 2{ inches fell in Eureka and Redding. At least 2 inches fell
in parts of Oregon and Washington.
   The storms also brought snow for Sierra Nevada and Cascade ski
areas suffering through a disappointing winter. More than 6 inches
of snow fell in higher elevations, and the National Weather Service
predicted as much as another foot today in the Lake Tahoe area.
   ``Oh, it's wonderful news,'' said Suellen McGeorge, spokeswoman
for Squaw Valley ski resort. ``It's a good, heavy wet storm. ...
It's really going to help.''
   The weather service posted winter storm warnings for this
morning in the western mountains of Wyoming, with the heaviest
snowfall expected in the Tetons and higher elevations of
Yellowstone National Park.
   High wind warnings, advisories or watches were in effect along
the Pacific coast, parts of Montana and Wyoming, northwest Nevada
and the foothills of northest Colorado. Winds Sunday gusted to 68
mph in Cheyenne, Wyo., and to 70 mph in the hilltops near
Rollinsville, Colo.
   Fair weather prevailed in much of the Midwest, northern Plains
and Upper Great Lakes, with record high temperatures Sunday in the
40s and 50s throughout Iowa and in parts of Nebraska, South Dakota
and Minnesota.
   Rain fell in North and South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia,
Alabama, Mississippi and eastern Arkansas.
   High temperature for the Lower 48 states Sunday was 85 degrees
at Vero Beach, West Palm Beach and North Dade County airport near
Miami, all in Florida.

<HEAD>Papal Nuncio Says Noriega Threatened Massacre Unless Granted
Refuge</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-After Noriega, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The papal nuncio in Panama said Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega threatened to start a massacre unless granted refuge in the
Vatican embassy in that country's capital, an Italian newspaper
reported.
   The envoy, Monsignor Jose Sabastian Laboa, was quoted in Rome's
Il Tempo on Sunday as saying he didn't have time to consult the
Vatican and made the decision by himself.
   ``I received two phone calls and he (Noriega) also sent an
officer with a message,'' Laboa was quoted as saying. ``He gave me
a quarter of an hour to decide: accept him or he would immediately
start a guerrilla war in the Chiriqui region. He threatened
massacres.''
   He said he immediately informed Gen. Marc Cisneros of the U.S.
Southern Command: ``He was speechless, for them it was a
humiliation.''
   In other interviews with Italian reporters, the nuncio said
Eliecer Gaitan, Noriega's personal security chief, provided
decisive help in persuading Noriega to leave the Vatican embassy
and surrender to U.S. troops.
   Laboa said Gaitan told Noriega he was ready to die with him but
by holding out they risked the same fate as Mussolini because U.S.
troops wouldn't stop Panamanians, who Gaitan said would one day
storm the embassy.
   Mussolini was shot and killed and then hanged by his feet in a
public square.
   Laboa has insisted that Noriega left the embassy on his own
accord on Wednesday and previously denied reports that he gave
Noriega an ultimatum to leave the mission 10 days after seeking
refuge there.
   Laboa said there was never any talk of granting concessions and
that once it was made clear that Noriega would not be sent to
another country it came down to getting him to accept guarantees
such as not facing the death penalty in the United States.
   ``He knows Panamanian prisons while I told him those in America
have TV and air conditioning,'' the nuncio was quoted as saying in
Turin's La Stampa and other newspapers.

<HEAD>Teen Charged With Making False Bomb Threat Against Delta</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A teen-ager who police say admitted guilt
has been charged with making a false bomb threat that disrupted
travel plans for hundreds of Delta Air Lines passengers last week.
   Colin Goodwin, 17, of Dunshaughlin in County Meath, was formally
charged Sunday in a district court. He was released on $1,400 bail
and ordered to surrender his passport pending a further appearance
in court Feb. 2.
   Detective Sgt. Daniel O'Riordan said that when the charge was
read over to Goodwin, the teenager replied: ``That's right, I made
that call.''
   Delta said it intensified security after receiving a threat
Thursday against its transatlantic operations, which include
flights to and from Germany, Ireland, England and France.
   Passengers were notified about the threats when they checked in,
said Delta spokesman Bill Berry in Atlanta, and several hundred
changed flights.
   ``We had several hundred passengers in this four-day period we
were in change their travel plans to another carrier,'' Berry said.
   He said Delta averages 4,000 transatlantic passengers a day, but
even the loss of a few means ``we're really concerned.''
   Berry said Goodwin was arrested Sunday morning at his home after
he allegedly telephoned his most recent threat to Delta's Dublin
office.
   A terrorist bomb explosion was blamed for the Dec. 21, 1988,
crash of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed
270 people. Pan Am was criticized afterward for not warning
passengers, although U.S. Embassy staffers in Europe had been
warned of threats against the airline.
   Delta passengers were notified about last week's threat when
they checked in, Berry said.
   A week earlier, Northwest Airlines received a bomb threat
against a flight from Paris to Detroit, but nothing happened.

<HEAD>Dollar Mixed, Gold Weaker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mixed against key currencies in
European trading this morning, as dealers focused on prospects for
the West German mark. Gold was weaker.
   Peter Kane, chief corporate dealer at Credit Suisse in London,
said the Italy's decision to devalue the lira by 3.01 percent on
Friday may reduce pressures on the European Monetary System in the
short-term but it ``hasn't changed the overall picture.''
   ``We will see a gradual strengthening of the mark once again,''
he predicted.
   David Clark, deputy forex manager at Commerzbank in London,
described the lire devaluation as largely a technical move that
certainly ``doesn't spell the end of the mark rally.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.52 yen, up 0.37 yen from
Friday's 144.15-yen finish. It opened at 144.55 yen and ranged
between 144.47 yen and 144.75 yen.
   Later, in London, it was quoted at 144.50 yen.
   The Bank of Japan sold some $100 million shortly after the Tokyo
market opened today, and fear of further central bank intervention
discouraged later dollar buying, dealers said.
   Mitsui Bank trader Yoshitsugu Hanada said the dollar-yen rate
moved little because the amounts of dollars and yen held by
investors were in good balance after wide swings and adjustments
following the New Year holidays.
   The dollar, which ended 1989 trading at 143.40 yen, opened on
Jan. 4 at 145.55 yen and was pushed down to 143.40 yen the next day
following central banks' intervention in Europe.
   ``But the basic sentiment for the dollar was getting stronger,
and speculative dealers were inclined to buy the U.S. currency
whenever it fell,'' Hanada said.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Friday:
   _1.6850 West German marks, up from 1.6810
   _1.5360 Swiss francs, down from 1.5365
   _5.7475 French francs, up from 5.7405
   _1.9095 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9030
   _1,258.00 Italian lire, down from 1,263.00
   _1.1597 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1595
   In London, the British pound traded at $1.6440 compared with
$1.6375 late Friday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $403.75 an
ounce at midmorning, down from $404.50 bid late Friday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $403.50, down $1.00 from late
Friday.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed at $401.56 per ounce Monday, down $2.10
from Saturday's close.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $5.29 a troy ounce, up
from Friday's $5.27.

<HEAD>American Once Held in El Salvador Says She Buried Items in Yard</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American woman who was imprisoned in El
Salvador after weapons were found buried in the yard of her San
Salvador home says she did bury personal objects outside the house
but not arms.
   After a talk at Riverside Church about her experiences in El
Salvador, Jennifer J. Casolo said Sunday she buried ``things that I
thought the security forces would be in disapproval of.''
   ``I had some project proposals for a medical clinic, a chicken
coop, things like that. And I had some musical tapes,'' she said.
``In El Salvador it is very common, from the time I got there, for
people to bury things.''
   She said she hid the items after a Salvadoran trade union was
bombed and the homes and offices of churchworkers were raided.
   Casolo, 28, of Thomaston Conn., worked in El Salvador for
Christian Education Seminars, a Texas-based ecumenical group that
arranges tours of the country.
   Her arrest Nov. 26 by government soldiers came in the midst of a
major offensive by leftist rebels involved in a decade-long civil
war against the government.
   The soldiers said weapons they unearthed in Casolo's yard had
been hidden there for rebels. But Casolo has denied all knowledge
of the weapons, saying they had either been placed there to frame
her, or had been buried before she moved into the house.
   She was freed from jail on Dec. 13 and expelled from El Salvador
after a military judge cited a lack of evidence.

<HEAD>Nixon Birthday a City Holiday, Presidential Library Nearly
Completed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former President Richard M. Nixon's
77th birthday Tuesday is a holiday in his hometown, which is
proudly planning for this summer's opening of the Nixon
presidential library.
   ``The interest has been fantastic. We call it `The Wonder Years'
syndrome,'' Hugh Hewitt, director of the library foundation, said
as he gazed over the library, a Spanish-style building described as
a ``window'' to Nixon's career.
   The Nixon Presidential Library and Birthplace, 30 miles
southeast of Los Angeles, will be the first of two presidential
libraries to open in Southern California. The Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library opens next year in Simi Valley, 75 miles away.
   The 40,000-plus residents of Nixon's hometown celebrate their
most famous citizen with a holiday Tuesday for the city's
approximately 100 employees. The City Council voted in September to
make the day a Yorba Linda holiday, the first such local honor for
Nixon.
   ``Fifteen years have elapsed since President Nixon's resignation
and history has shown the importance of his presidency,
particularly with respect to his brilliance in foreign policy,''
the holiday resolution said.
   The $20 million library rises prominently in the hilly community
among homes valued to $700,000. Construction workers are toiling
furiously to meet the July 19 opening.
   Unlike other presidential libraries, the 45,000-square-foot
Nixon library won't be operated with taxpayer dollars. The former
chief executive insisted on it.
   The Nixon library will hold another first among presidential
libraries _ it is to open without presidential papers.
   The federal government took custody of Nixon's presidential
materials _ 44 million pages and 4,000 hours of tape recordings _
when he tried to have some of them destroyed.
   ``Control over the papers has been in litigation for years. We
expect them eventually. What we have are reproductions of the Oval
Office papers. We have 8,000 core files,'' Hewitt said.
   Nixon, who lives in Upper Saddle River, N.J., resigned Aug. 9,
1974, after revelations stemming from a botched burglary at
Democratic headquarters at Washington's Watergate building during
his 1972 re-election campaign.
   ``It won't be a museum on Watergate, but we're not going to shy
away from it, either. It's part of what interests people about
Nixon,'' said Hewitt, noting current world events can be traced in
part to Nixon's actions in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
   The library was originally planned in San Clemente, site of the
Western White House during the Nixon presidency, but plans stalled
amid controversy over another development tied to the library.
   Visitors on a self-guided tour will start in the library's
293-seat theater with a 16-minute film on Nixon's life. They will
walk through the Alger Hiss Chambers and see the vintage ``Woody''
station wagon used on the campaign trail in 1950.
   Bronze, life-sized figures of 10 world leaders occupy another
large room. Also on display will be Nixon's vice presidential
papers and book manuscripts, exhibits on the Vietnam War and
prisoners of war, Nixon's diplomacy with the Soviet Union and China
and his debate with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.
   There also will be a section on former first lady Pat Nixon and
the couple's daughters, Tricia and Julie, as well as a garden
blooming with the Patricia Nixon Rose.

   The first captured security men loyal
to ousted President Nicolae Ceausescu went before military
tribunals today, accused of resisting the popular revolt that
toppled and executed the despised dictator.
   The first tribunal opened in the south Transylvanian city of
Sibiu, ruled until Dec. 22 by Ceausescu's son Nicu.
   ``A group of terrorists who fought against the people in the
army'' faced the military court, a spokesman for the revolutionary
government said.
   Aurel Dragos Munteanu, the spokesman and director of television,
told a news conference he did not know how many security men would
face trial.
   He gave no details of the exact charges in Sibiu or other
centers of heavy fighting such as Bucharest and the western city of
Timisoara, where the revolution began Dec. 17 when security forces
massacred anti-government protesters. Thousands of people were
killed in the uprising.
   The accused have no right of appeal, said Munteanu, but media _
foreign and domestic _ will have access to the tribunals.
   The National Salvation Front, which has been running the country
since Ceausescu was ousted Dec. 22, organized the secret military
tribunal that ordered the Christmas Day execution of the president
and his wife, Elena.
   It has since abolished the death sentence, so the captured men
of crack security units who battled the army after Ceausescu was
ousted face a maximim sentence of life in prison.
   Munteanu said those still under investigation include Nicu
Ceausescu and Gen. Iulian Vlad, the former head of Ceausescu's
dreaded Securitate security police, which Romania's new leaders
have ordered disbanded.
   Asked about weekend statements from President Ion Iliescu and
Vice President Dumitru Mazilu that free elections promised for
April could be postponed, Munteanu said he knew of no such
postponement as yet.
   The half-dozen political parties formed or reborn in the two
short weeks since Ceausescu was executed have charged that the
National Salvation Front would have an unfair advantage in any
early poll because of its control of media and the government.
   They have urged posponement of the balloting so they have more
time to organize campaigns.
   Some political groups have accused Romanian television of
boycotting their gatherings while giving ample coverage to the
National Salvation Front. Romanian TV cameras did not follow
demonstrations by two parties and students in Bucharest on Sunday.
   Munteanu countered these complaints by stressing he believed in
a free media and noting that representatives of the Peasant Party
and Liberal Party appeared on television Sunday night to present
their groups' programs.
   ``My personal standard of freedom of the press is the First
Amendment to the United States Constitution,'' he said.
   ``After these parties had registered, they were given access to
television,'' he said. ``Previously, there was no legal framework
for that.'' The Peasant Party was a power in Parliament before the
Communists abolished it in 1947, and both it and the Christian
Democrats have traditionally been anti-Communist.
   Since their renaissance, the two parties have joined forces in
preparation for the promised elections and have warned against a
Communist resurgence.
   They see the National Salvation Front, which includes several
former Communists in its leadership, as a de facto front for
Communism.
   On Sunday, about 300 supporters of the two parties led an
emotional march through the capital in memory for those who fell in
the uprising.
   As they knelt and prayed in the bitter cold that hovered near
zero, the marchers were joined by several thousand other people who
paced along the ice-covered sidewalks in a solemn half-mile
procession.
   Less than two miles away, about 2,500 students met for a rally
at the Polytechnical Institute to press for university autonomy,
more student say in determining the curriculum and a postponement
of examinations scheduled for Jan. 25. They also want an end to
required political indoctrination courses.
   Nicolae Costel, a Christian Democratic Party official, said
thousands more students had gathered in other cities, including
Timisoara.
   During Ceausescu's 24-year reign, courses that extolled the
virtues of ``scientific socialism'' were compulsory for all
students.
   Razvan Rusovici, a 21-year-old aeronautical engineering student,
expressed hope for the future: ``We want to be more like our
Western brothers and study what we really need and not what some
ignorant dictator imagines we need.''

   President Bush, saying productive
agriculture and a clean environment are compatible, urged America's
farmers today to support efforts to reduce contamination of
groundwater from pesticides and fertilizers.
   In an address to the American Farm Bureau convention, Bush also
said he will press in the 1990 farm bill for ``market-oriented farm
policies that allow producers more flexibility to decide what crops
to grow.''
   ``At the same time, we've got to maintain a safety net to
protect farmers from conditions beyond their control,'' the
president said in remarks prepared for delivery at the Orange
County Civic Center before touring high-tech agriculture and ocean
exhibits at Walt Disney's Epcot Center nearby.
   Bush also used the speech to push a major objective of his on
this year's congressional calendar: passage of a cut in the capital
gains tax cut. He said a tax reduction ``would apply to the sale of
farmland'' and ``will be one of my top priorities in this
legislative year.''
   ``With continued economic growth, we can keep rural America
going strong,'' he said.
   Bush said farmers have bounced back from trying times in the
1980s, with help from the 1985 farm legislation that led to lower
federal crop subsidies and more land in production.
   ``Surpluses have declined dramatically, and most of of good land
has been brought back into production,'' he said. ``Net farm income
reached a record level last year. ... The farm credit situation has
greatly improved, bringing more financial stability to rural
America.''
   But Bush added that market-oriented farm policies ``are only a
part of the agricultural picture. We've got to expand markets and
enhance productivity. We've got to assure the public that America's
food is the safest in the world, and we've got to protect our
precious environment.''
   ``We must recognize that productive agriculture and a sound
environment can be compatible, especially in terms of water
quality,'' the president said.
   The administration has already initiated a five-year effort to
protect groundwater from contamination by fertilizers and
pesticides running off farms, he said.
   ``We must keep your good land in business _ without unreasonable
burdens _ but we must also keep it good land,'' he said. ``I am
counting on your leadership as we work to expand farm productivity
while safeguarding the environment.''
   Without giving details, Bush said the administration also is
drafting legislation ``to protect the food supply without
overwhelming the agriculture industry.''
   He noted that farmers have a major stake in U.S. efforts to
foster free trade, including its recent ``bold proposal in the
Uruguay Round'' of international trade talks that would phase out
export-subsidies in five years and other trade-distorting practices
in 10 years.
   ``Any agreement we sign will be an agreement that's also good
for American agriculture,'' he promised.
   Bush pointed to the emerging economies in Eastern Europe as a
prime target for expanded farm exports. U.S. farm exports already
are at record levels after three years of growth.
   The trip was Bush's first public appearance since ex-Panamanian
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega surrendered last Wednesday to face
trial in the United States on drug-trafficking charges.
   It comes as U.S. officials acknowledged they are having ``some
difficulties'' arranging an increased role for the U.S. military in
the Caribbean off the coast of Colombia to help intercept drug
smugglers' sea and air routes.
   Bush, asked Sunday as he went jogging about reports that the
aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and other ships were steaming
toward Colombia, said, ``I will address myself ... to that question
at a future date.''
   When a reporter suggested that Colombian officials were upset,
Bush said, ``We don't know all that.''
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said discussions with
Colombian authorities have not begun.
   However, Bogota's El Tiempo published a communique Sunday by the
government of President Virgilio Barco that said the Colombian
``government has not participated, nor will it participate, in any
joint operation with United States military forces, air or naval,
in the Caribbean Sea.''
   ``In international waters it has not participated, nor will it,
and in territorial waters it has not authorized (the operations),
nor is it considering authorizing them,'' the statement added.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Sunday that he expected the
announcement of stepped-up military anti-drug efforts within the
next two week and predicted that the Latin nations and ``anybody
interested in halting the flow of illicit drugs into the United
States will be supportive.''

<TEXT>
   In Abraham Lincoln's day, souvenir-hunters and
job-seekers roamed virtually unchecked through the White House
night and day, and even the family's pet goats had the run of the
executive mansion, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian says.
   David Herbert Donald of Harvard University kept President and
Mrs. Bush and 125 others enraptured Sunday night with his
descriptions of the down-to-earth life the Lincolns led during the
Civil War.
   ``This is the first in a series of lectures on the men who've
held this office. And it seeks to make them come alive,'' Bush told
the audience gathered in the State Dining Room. ``What were they
like? How did they live? How was history, the history of America's
house, molded by their dreams?
   ``To occupy this office is to ask those questions and certainly
to feel a kinship with those who have gone before,'' said Bush, the
41st president.
   Lincoln, Donald said, came to Washington in 1861 from
Springfield, Ill., with few friends and no administrative
experience. He found himself a virtual prisoner in his own home,
besieged by job-seekers at every turn.
   The Kentucky-born Mary Todd Lincoln was regarded as an uncouth
frontierswoman by Washington's society elite. Their suspicions grew
when four of her brothers and three brothers-in-law enlisted in the
Confederate cause.
   The floors of the mansion's public rooms were covered in
oilcloth to make it easier to clean up the spills from overflowing
spittoons. Mrs. Lincoln made short work of a four-year
appropriation of $20,000 _ $200,000 in today's dollars _ to fix up
the mansion, spending it in weeks and running up other bills on
credit.
   ``Merchants showed her the best ... and she bought everything,''
Donald said. Lincoln fulminated, but Congress passed a supplemental
appropriation to cover the debts.
   The Lincolns were the first family to raise children in the
White House, with their two youngest sons, Willie and Tad, ages 10
and 8, commandeering the roof for a fort from which they ``fired''
on invisible rebels across the Potomac.
   Citizens showered them with gifts, including a pony and two
goats, which, ``like the public at large, had the run of the White
House,'' Donald said.
   But on Feb. 5, 1862, even as the Lincolns were host to 500
guests to show off the restored mansion, both boys lay seriously
ill upstairs with ``bilious'' fever _ possibly typhoid from the
White House's foul water supply, Donald said.
   Willie died two weeks later, leaving both parents
grief-stricken. Lincoln recovered, but his wife did not, lapsing
into a deep depression and becoming the dupe of spiritualists who
held at least eight seances at the White House.
   Lincoln attended one ``to find out who was preying on his wife's
mental instability,'' Donald said.
   Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation in the fall of
1862, and his Republican Party lost the congressional elections.
   As the war went poorly, Lincoln ate little and slept poorly in a
bedroom separate from his wife. Tad, beset with nightmares, often
slept in his father's bed.
   A year after Willie's death, the Lincolns began entertaining
again. Mrs. Lincoln continued her spendthrift ways, buying jewelry
and clothing galore, including 400 pairs of gloves in a three-month
period. She needed 19 wagons to cart her belongings to a summer
residence.
   Mrs. Bush said after Donald's lecture that she felt
``agonizingly sorry'' for Mrs. Lincoln.
   ``I hadn't known she had any happy times. All our pictures of
her are agonizingly sad,'' she said. ``We always think today our
lives are so complicated. Then you look at what Lincoln stepped
into. ... Things look pretty good for us.''
   Bush said he plans two more presidential lectures this year. He
did not say who will give them, but noted, ``I always love Teddy
Roosevelt.''

<TEXT>
   Communist officials began talks today
with members of the opposition, the Turkish minority and Slav
majority on ethnic conflicts that erupted in a wave of nationwide
protests last week.
   The meeting at the National Assembly building, chaired by
Parliament President Stanko Todorov, was called after four days of
nationalist rallies against a decision by Communist leaders
allowing ethnic Turks and Moslems to use their Moslem names and
practice their religion without restrictions.
   Ethnic conflicts have become more apparent in some parts of
Eastern Europe, where hard-line Communist regimes were replaced by
reformist governments last year.
   The government news agency BTA reported that representatives
from all official and opposition groups, as well as delegations
from dozens of cities were taking part in the forum, which the
agency termed unprecedented in Communist Bulgaria.
   Todorov on Sunday night called for the weeklong ``social forum''
on ``several aspects of the national question.''
   BTA did not identify who was taking part in the forum. It said
the meeting today was to discuss how to organize the talks and that
formal negotiations would begin Tuesday.
   However, BTA said the participants unanimously approved an
appeal to the people to call off all rallies and strikes to ensure
a ``peaceful and business-like atmosphere'' at the talks.
   At a rally Sunday, Bulgarian demonstrators threatened to start a
general strike if their demands were not met that a referendum be
held on the minority issue.
   News media controlled by the 2-month-old leadership that
replaced hard-liner Todor Zhivkov reported that local officials who
are holdovers from the old regime appeared to be using the ethnic
issue to try to stall reform.
   But the media also reported a resurgence of Turkish nationalism
in some areas, quoting witnesses as saying Turkish flags have been
seen flying over public buildings in one southern city.
   Premier Georgi Atanassov said the practice was illegal.
   The demonstrators demand the repeal of a Dec. 29 order restoring
rights to Bulgaria's 1.5 million ethnic Turks and Moslems.
   That decision reversed the assimilation policy introduced by
Zhivkov, who forced ethnic Turks to change their names to Bulgarian
ones and barred them from speaking Turkish in public.
   Nationalists among the Slav majority, who are mainly Orthodox
Christian, fear the Turkish minority is growing too fast and poses
a threat to the country of nearly 9 million. Slavs also are
suspicious of the loyalties of the Bulgarian Turks and ethnic
Bulgarian Moslems, known as Pomaks, since Bulgaria won independence
in 1877 from the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled it for 500 years.
   The government of Turkey, which lies on Bulgaria's southeastern
border, and some Bulgarian Turks have blamed Zhivkov's hard-line
Commmunist followers for instigating the unrest.
   Bulgarian Foreign Minister Boiko Dimitrov is to meet his Turkish
counterpart Mesut Yilmaz in Kuwait Tuesday for a second round of
talks on the minority issue.
   On Friday, thousands of Bulgarian workers walked off the job in
at least five cities. Other demonstrations took place over the
weekend.
   ``Bulgaria _ a one-nationality country,'' read banners carried
by some of the 10,000 ethnic Slavs who demonstrated in Sofia on
Sunday outside Alexander Nevski Cathedral.
   Standing in zero-degree weather, the protesters booed, hissed or
chanted ``Resignation! Resignation!'' as Atanassov and Interior
Minister Atanas Semerdzhiev tried to address them.
   In an apparent attempt to appease the protesters, Atanassov said
Bulgarian would remain the official language. But both his and
Semerdzhiev's speeches were drowned out.
   ``A hard time will befall the country whose people is divided,''
the official news agency BTA quoted Semerdzhiev as saying. He
appealed to the crowd not to undermine ``the tendencies towards
democracy in the country.''
   BTA said residents from the southern town of Kardzhali, where
almost half the 50,000 inhabitants are ethnic Turks, reported
seeing Turkish flags on public buildings.
   Atanassov, in a television address Sunday, said it was
``inadmissible to raise the flag of a foreign state at
demonstrations and rallies in public and private places.''
   He said the interior minister had been told to maintain public
peace and ``neutralize any anti-constitutional and extremist acts
under the framework of law.'' He did not elaborate.
   A leader of the influential independent trade union Podkrepa,
Nikolai Kolev, called for members to ``fight against all
destructive forces.'' In a statement broadcast on state TV he said
he thought nationalistic protests were being spurred by local
officials.
   While Petar Mladenov, who took over from Zhivkov as party leader
Nov. 10, has moved quickly to put new people in the leadership more
likely to support democratic reform, few changes have been made at
the local level.
   Some 320,000 ethnic Turks fled Zhivkov's persecution and
emigrated to Turkey last summer, but at least 50,000 returned
because of a lack of jobs and proper housing.
   Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, a revolt by ethnic Hungarians
against the Romanian government last month turned into a nationwide
uprising that ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.

<DATELINE>ANGELES CITY, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist guerrillas operating
around a U.S. base will step up attacks on American soldiers, local
officials and other ``anti-revolutionary elements,'' a rebel
spokesman said today.
   The ``new year offensive'' will involve fresh recruits ``ready
to strike any time at targets of opportunity,'' said Aryel Miranda,
spokesman of the New People's Army brigade based in this city 40
miles north of Manila.
   Angeles is the home of the U.S. Clark Air Base.
   Speaking to reporters over a radio link, Miranda said the
targets included those near Olongapo City, site of the U.S. Subic
Naval Base, 50 miles west of Manila, and the U.S. communications
facility at Camp O'Donnel in Tarlac province north of Angeles.
   ``We will not waste chances,'' Miranda said. ``We will already
confront them to hasten the national democratic revolution,''
Miranda said.
   The rebel spokesman said the offensive against U.S. soldiers and
Filipino ``collaborators'' was decided to coincide with talks on
the future of the bases, expected to begin by March. The lease on
the bases expires in 1991 and a new treaty is needed to extend
their stay.
   He said the guerrillas were not yet prepared to launch direct
attacks on U.S. facilities. He added that American civilians or
retired U.S. military personnel were not targets of the rebel
offensive.
   He said Friday's assassination of Javier Hizon, mayor of nearby
Mexico town, ``was just a first sampling'' of sporadic but
intensified attacks by the Mariano Garcia Brigade.
   Miranda said local officials led by Angeles Mayor Antonio Abad
Santos who allegedly are corrupt would be included in the offensive.
   Abad Santos was not available for comment.
   The urban guerilla squad was responsible for the killing of two
U.S. airmen and another American in October 1987.
   Last September, guerrillas ambushed and killed two U.S. civilian
employees working at Camp O'Donnel to coincide with the visit in
Manila of Vice President Dan Quayle.
   About 40,000 American troops, civilians and military dependents
are stationed at the six U.S. military installations in the
Philippines.

   Subway authorities said today they

subway stations.
   More than 130 workers will be deployed at 20 crowded stations in
Seoul to help commuters squeeze their way into cars and prevent
rush-hour delays, officials said.
   About 3 million people use four subway lines daily, with 1
million at rush-hours, causing congestion at key stations and

   Seoul plans to build three more subway lines in the 1990s to

   Radical students hurling firebombs
burned effigies of U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg and President Roh
Tae-woo today in the provincial city of Kwangju to protest Gregg's
visit, reports said.
   A separate group of 100 protesters threw human excrement and
tear gas powder near a police station several hundred yards from
the U.S. Cultural Center residence where Gregg visited, the reports
said.
   About 500 radical students yelling anti-American slogans hurled
firebombs and rocks at 900 combat-clad riot police outside the main
gate of Chosun University, reported Yonhap, the South Korean news
agency.
   Two black armored vans fired volleys of tear gas shells to break
up a campus rally, but groups of students and riot police clashed
in hand-to-hand fighting inside the campus for more than an hour,
Yonhap said. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   Gregg apparently did not see the fighting, news reports said. He
was the first U.S. ambassador to visit Kwangju, a provincial city
155 miles south of Seoul, since a 1980 civil uprising in which 200
were killed and 1,500 injured.
   Many Kwangju citizens believe Washington condoned the
mobilization of the Korean military to put down unrest and silence
government dissent. Washington has repeatedly denied the
allegations.
   ``Gregg came here under a scheme with Roh Tae-woo trying to
unilaterally shelve the Kwangju issue,'' yelled a student leader at
the rally, Yonhap said.
   The students vowed to continue their struggle to overthrow Roh's
government and punish the United States, which they claim played a
role in the uprising.
   The Hankook Ilbo, a Seoul daily newspaper, said police advised
against Gregg's visit, but U.S. officials insisted that an
explanation of the American role in Kwangju should be resolved
through dialogue.
   ``I came here not to make an apology but to express regret and
condolences to Kwangju citizens,'' Gregg told a news conference in
a downtown hotel, according to Yonhap, which said he denied any
U.S. involvement in putting down the uprising.
   Gregg reportedly told journalists the United States urged the
South Korean government in 1980 to settle the protests in Kwangju
peacefully, ``but our influence was not enough over the South
Korean government.''
   Anti-American sentiment in strong in Kwangju and the U.S.
cultural center has been attacked by radical students 28 times
since 1980. It was closed last year after U.S. officials expressed
concern for the safety of the staff.
   Gregg, a former CIA station chief in Seoul, has been the target
of protests since he was appointed ambassador last year. On Oct.
13, six radical students broke into his residence and hurled
homemade bombs at police before being overpowered. Gregg and his
wife, Meg, were unhurt.
   He arrived in Kwangju on Sunday for a three-day stay. Last week,
the U.S. Embassy issued a statement rejecting former President Chun
Doo-hwan's reference to an alleged U.S. role in the Kwangju
incident.
   Chun said in parliamentary testimony Dec. 31 that he, then an
army general, decided on the military suppression of the uprising
after receiving information from the United States that the
military threat from communist North Korea was increasing.
   The U.S. Embassy said the United States did not see any evidence
of a heightened threat from North Korea at the time.

   A woman said she won a $35 million Lotto jackpot
after Donald Trump and Malcolm Forbes told her the lucky numbers in
a dream, but a news report today said she later admitted it was a
hoax.
   Charlene ``Charlie'' Taylor pulled the prank with the help of
Alan Abel, a jokester whose previous feats included getting his own
obituary printed in The New York Times and staging fainting spells
in the audience of a ``Donahue'' TV show, the Daily News said.
   Taylor, 30, said she was a cosmetologist and had shown reporters
what she said was a photocopy of the ticket as she staged a
champagne party Sunday at $400-a-night suite at the Omni Park
Central Hotel in midtown Manhattan. But the photocopy _ which
listed the winning numbers 18, 25, 26, 32, 42 and 44 _ was fake,
the News said.
   The newspaper reported that Abel and Taylor admitted the hoax
after one of their reporters recognized Abel as the teacher of a
class she had once taken on practical jokes.
   Abel told the News the hoax took six months to plan, involved a
dozen actors and was a way to ``provide some levity in the news
between the ax murders and hostages. It's a grand satire.''
   Taylor told the News she is an actress-comedian from Manhattan.
   Lottery officials had been cautious all along, saying Sunday
night they could not confirm Taylor's claim until she turned in the
actual ticket, which Taylor said was ``in a safe place, safely
hidden away.''
   Her claim to be the winner was broadcast on local television and
radio stations and printed in local newspapers.
   The real holder of the $35 million Lotto jackpot _ the largest
individual lottery award in state history _ has yet to come
forward. Lottery officials say the lone winning ticket was sold in
suburban Westchester County.
   Taylor told reporters at the hotel Sunday night that the winning
numbers came to her in a dream in which Trump and Forbes ``were
circling around me, spewing out numbers and they told me the right
thing.''

   Three children, including a brother and
sister, fell through ice and drowned in a water-filled coal pit,
police said.
   From marks on the ice, ``you know they were playing one minute
and the next minute they were grabbing, clawing and scratching for
their lives,'' said Warrick County Sheriff Jeffrey T. Gore.
   Erin Hernandez, 11, her brother, Nathan, 12, and a friend, Tom
McNabb, 12, all of the Boonville area in southwestern Indiana, were
pronounced dead late Saturday by Vanderburgh County Coroner Michael
Miodus.
   They fell through a 2-inch layer of ice Saturday afternoon in a
pit owned by Peabody Coal Co. The children were submerged in the
water for at least a half-hour before rescuers reached them,
authorities said.
   Parents discovered the holes in the ice after the children did
not return for lunch as expected.
   The children had been told to stay away from the pits, ``but
they're kids,'' said Elizabeth Hernandez, Erin and Nathan's mother.

<HEAD>Scientists Checking Mount St. Helens for Clues to Future Activity</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists took samples of gritty ash
from the flanks of Mount St. Helens in hopes of learning whether
the volcano's latest burst will bring more explosive activity.
   Three scientists got within 12 miles of the crater on the east
flanks of the 8,366-foot mountain Sunday to gather ash from the
largest explosion in nearly four years.
   Dan Dzurisin, acting scientist in charge of the Cascades Volcano
Observatory in Vancouver, said the ash appeared to be pulverized
material from previously erupted lava.
   If an examination by microscope shows the ash is from a new
surge of magma or molten rock beneath the volcano, however, it
could be a sign of more explosions to come, Dzurisin said.
   Scientists also planned to fly in a helicopter over the crater
to determine whether there was an avalanche from the lava dome in
the eruption Saturday morning. Dense clouds prevented a flight
Sunday, Dzurisin said.
   The latest eruption, which came without preceding earthquakes,
sent ash as far as 90 miles to the east and destroyed two
seismometers and two tilt meters in the crater. No injuries were
reported.
   Seismographs and other equipment recorded the two-minute
explosion beginning at 5:37 a.m. Saturday. After a couple of hours
of small earthquakes beneath the volcano, seismic activity subsided
to normal levels, Dzurisin said.
   In the past few months, there have twice been lesser bursts from
the volcano. On Aug. 24, there was a minor eruption with no ashfall
detected. On Dec. 8, ashfall was limited to the crater.
   An eruption like Saturday's, without the small earthquakes in
advance to give a warning, is ``relatively new to us,'' Dzurisin
said.
   It was the most significant explosion since a series of small
explosions spit ash in the spring of 1986, he said.
   U.S. Forest Service and Wapato police officials received dozens
of calls Saturday, reporting light dustings of a fine, gritty,
gray-white ash in and around Yakima in the south-central part of
the state. Yakima is about 80 miles from the volcano.
   The volcano's last significantly large eruption was on March 19,
1982, when mud flowed from the crater six miles to the north fork
of the Toutle River, he said.
   The last dome-building eruption, a more quiet process in which
molten rock pushes upward to swell the huge mound of cooling lava
in the crater, was in 1986.
   Studying the recent ashfall could indicate whether the eruption
was part of a ``last gasp'' or the start of a more explosive phase
in the volcanic activity that began in March 1980, Dzurisin said.
   The cataclysmic explosion of May 18, 1980, leveled 230 square
miles, killed 57 people and sent up an ash cloud that circled the
globe. It also blew off the top 1,300 feet of the peak.

<TEXT>
   Opposition groups today questioned assurances
by Communist leaders that East Germany's secret police is being
disbanded and alleged that one unit had urged a coup to stop
democratic reforms.
   The opposition group Democratic Awakening today said opposition
representatives were suspending talks on East Germany's future with
the government until officials explain the domestic security
situation. Today's talks were covered on national television.
   A collapse of the talks could endanger the tenuous acceptance of
Communist Premier Hans Modrow's transitional Cabinet by the
opposition, which has been unable to present a unified front.
   Opposition groups earlier had threatened to leave the talks over
what they charge are government efforts to preserve a domestic
intelligence network that could stifle the reform movement.
   Rolf Henrich of New Forum, the largest opposition group,
disclosed what he said was a draft telex prepared by secret police
agents in the city of Gera on Dec. 9, urging authorities in East
Berlin to ``paralyze'' the opposition.
   Henrich said he was uncertain if the telex was ever dispatched,
but contended it ``called for a coup'' to end the democratic reform
movement.
   Communist Party chief Gregor Gysi and representatives of other
traditionally Communist-allied parties said they were unaware of
the message.
   Democratic Awakening leader Wolfgang Schnur demanded that the
national prosecutor's office and the Interior Ministry appear
before representatives of the opposition and government later in
the afternoon.
   The Modrow government, formed after a peaceful popular October
revolution toppled hard-line Communist leaders, has promised to
create the conditions for free and fair elections on May 6.
   As talks resumed today, the opposition demanded that the
government disarm agents of the former State Security Office by
Jan. 19 and drop plans to set up a new agency to succeed it before
the May elections.
   Peter Koch, an official named by the government to oversee
dissolution of the secret police, said authorities plan to
confiscate all of the former agency's arms by the end of this
month. Former agents are already barred from access to weapons, he
said.
   Reports last month by the official ADN news agency said the
force had been disbanded.
   Modrow said in an interview Sunday with Austrian television that
a security force is needed to prevent the spread of right-wing
extremism in East Germany.
   In today's session, some opposition leaders lashed out at
Communist authorities for allegedly trying to portray them as
right-wingers.
   Markus Meckel, a delegate of the opposition Social Democratic
Party, said recent government warnings about a rise of neo-Nazism
is aimed at justifying authorities' desire to preserve the secret
police.
   The negotiations, launched Dec. 7, includes some 40 delegates
from the Communists, other political parties long aligned with them
but now independent, and the pro-democracy opposition.
   The Communist Party has given up its constitutional monopoly on
power and has been tarnished by corruption charges against previous
Communist leaders.
   But the opposition has been hard-pressed to offer a credible
alternative to continued Communist rule.
   Pre-election unity announced by six East German reform movements
proved short-lived Sunday, with one group announcing it has
abandoned the coalition and New Forum saying it prefers to run
candidates independently.
   The United Left pro-reform group has withdrawn from the
opposition's Election Alliance 90 coalition announced on Thursday,
ADN reported.
   Bernd Gehrkes of United Left was quoted by ADN as saying that
his group was ``misleadingly presented'' in the announcement by the
Social Democrats, another of the pro-democracy groups, that six
movements were banding together to boost their election chances.
   Social Democratic leader Steffen Reiche said three days earlier
that his party had joined with New Forum, Democratic Awakening,
Democracy Now, the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights and the
United Left.
   But at a weekend congress in Leipzig, 150 delegates from New
Forum branches around the country declared that election of
individual, independent candidates was preferable to voting for
political parties or alliances, and that New Forum candidates would
rather run alone.
   Dozens of citizens' groups pressing for social, political,
environmental and economic reforms have sprung up throughout East
Germany since the Oct. 18 ouster of hard-line Communist leader
Erich Honecker and the nation's turn toward democracy and open
borders.

   A man planned to kill his former
girlfriend by hiring a hit man to inject her with the AIDS virus,
officials said.
   Charles Crewse, 55, of Springfield was being held on $100,000
bond in the St. Charles County Jail, accused of conspiring to
murder a 36-year-old woman who recently moved to St. Louis from
Springfield.
   He was accused of offering to pay a Springfield man $1,000 to
murder the woman by injecting her with the deadly virus, which the
accomplice claimed to have access to through contacts at a medical
center.
   The hired man changed his mind and told the former girlfriend in
October, said Detective David Asher of the Springfield police
department.
   Crewse was arrested Wednesday after he followed the woman home
from work and threatened her and her sister, Asher said.
   ``It's a bizarre situation, and we felt it was necessary to
proceed with charges,'' Asher said.
   The plot was reported to police in October but officials delayed
arresting Crewse until he made further physical contact with her,
Asher said.
   Crewse allegedly planned the murder since July, when the woman
ended her relationship with him, he said.

<TEXT>
   Last month's coup attempt was staged
by more troops than previously thought, and some senior officers
believed most of the armed forces were involved in the plot,
according to documents obtained today.
   The assessments were contained in sworn affidavits made to
military investigators probing the bloody Dec. 1-9 attempt to
topple President Corazon Aquino. The Associated Press obtained
copies of the statements from military sources.
   In one affidavit, a rebel army captain who later defected to the
government said coup plotters had expected priests, nuns,
government officials and civilians to join mutinous soldiers,
repeating the 1986 ``People's Power'' revolt that ousted the late
ruler Ferdinand Marcos.
   Capt. Jose Cruz, assistant chief of staff of logistics for the
Philippine military, said the failed coup that officials said left
113 dead was launched to combat alleged corruption, nepotism and
inefficiency.
   Cruz and seven other military officers affirmed their statements
Friday before a government panel investigating whether to file
rebellion charges against two retired brigadier generals implicated
in the failed putsch.
   Brig. Gen. Oscar Florendo, chief of the Civil Relations Service,
said a major enlisted men's fraternity has been linked to the coup
attempt and tried to assassinate him and other military officials,
the Philippines News Agency reported today.
   Florendo, quoting two captured rebel soldiers, said the Guardian
Brotherhood was involved in the coup attempt. Guardian members have
been linked to a previous coup attempt.
   Mrs. Aquino has also created a presidential commission to
investigate the coup attempt, arming it with emergency powers to
open bank accounts of suspected plotters.
   At least five flag officers, four of them at large, were
identified by the military as having joined the attempt. At least
20 officers, whose names had not been previously linked to other
rebellions, are being investigated for their role in the coup
attempt.
   Col. Abraham Paray, commanding officer of the Light Armored
Brigade, said he tried to dissuade rebel officers from using
violence when they seized the army headquarters on the first day.
   Paray said he asked the mutineers who were ``orchestrating their
actions'' and was told that most in the military hierarchy was
involved except Secretary of National Defense Fidel Ramos, Chief of
Staff Gen. Renato de Villa and constabulary chief Maj. Gen. Ramon
Montano.
   He said the rebels identified military backers, including the
commander of the elite Scout Rangers, Brig. Gen. Marcelo Blando,
who is is hiding, and the chief of the Southern Luzon command,
Brig. Gen. Alejandro Galido. Galido has not been charged but was
sent on leave for alleged health problems. He denied any role in
the coup attempt.
   ``But considering the big names that they dropped, I gathered
the impression that the majority of the Armed Forces of the
Philippines had a hand in the takeover,'' said Paray who was among
those held captive at the officer's lounge at army headquarters
Fort Bonifacio.
   In another affidavit, Cruz, who was also implicated but
acquitted in the August 1987 failed coup, said most Scout Ranger
companies joined the mutiny, including those from southern and
central Luzon Island. The specific units he cited had not been
previously linked to the coup attempt.
   Cruz said he had attended secret meetings since October with
plotters led by a Maj. Abraham Purugganan at the army headquarters.
A briefing was held on the eve of the mutiny and final instructions
made.
   ``It was also explained to us that on the morning of Dec 1 when
the major services have already occupied their respective areas,
the representatives of these major services will converge at the
Philippine army headquarters to be joined and attended by
government officials, politicians, media, cause-oriented groups,
priests and nuns and others,'' Cruz said.
   He said a junta was to then convene, adding that identities of
politicians or members of the junta were not mentioned.
   Cruz said he decided to defect on the first night and escaped on
foot during a power failure in the camp.

<HEAD>Court Lets Stand Ruling on Cordless Telephone Privacy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling
that people have no constitutionally protected right to privacy
when at home speaking on a cordless telephone.
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that law
enforcement agents acted unlawfully when, without obtaining a court
warrant, they monitored an Iowa family's cordless-telephone
conversations.
   Noting that the technology of cordless phones makes
conversations on them more susceptible to interception, a federal
judge said, ``Because there was no justifiable expectation of
privacy, the interceptions did not violate the Fourth Amendment.''
   The Constitution's Fourth Amendment generally bars warrantless
police searches and seizures, and since a landmark 1967 Supreme
Court decision police have been barred from secretly listening to
conversations over traditional phones without court warrants.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judge's ruling
in the Iowa case last June 15, making it binding law in seven
states _ Iowa, Arkansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North
Dakota and South Dakota.
   Today's Supreme Court action does not carry any direct impact on
any state aside from those seven.
   One of every four American homes has a cordless phone, according
to industry estimates. Over nine million of the phones were sold in
1989.
   The cordless phone relays a speaker's voice from a mobile
handset to a base unit through the use of low-power radio
transmissions. From the base unit, the signal is transmitted
through regular telephone lines.
   The phone can be used anywhere within a certain distance from
the base unit, usually a range of up to 700 feet. Conversations on
it, however, may be heard by another cordless phone nearby and on
the same frequency.
   Scott and Sheila Tyler of Dixon, Iowa, received a cordless phone
as a gift in June 1983. It was regularly used by the Tylers and
their children as another extension phone.
   Neighbors Rich and Sandra Berodt, who lived several blocks away,
soon discovered that their cordless phone would make ringing and
dialing noises whenever the Tyler phone was in use.
   Based on some conversations they listened to, the Berodts
suspected that Scott Tyler was involved in illegal drug dealing.
They contacted Everett Howard, an investigator with the Scott
County Sheriff's Department.
   Howard encouraged the Berodts to continue the eavesdropping, and
supplied them with recording equipment so conversations on the
Tylers' phone could be preserved on cassettes.
   The Berodts' suspicion about drug-dealing proved unfounded, but
over several months authorities relied on the tapes to charge Scott
Tyler with criminal theft and conspiracy. The tapes, however, were
barred as evidence at his criminal trial.
   Tyler was convicted in late 1984 on charges stemming from his
bilking two food companies out of $35,000. He was sentenced to 10
years in prison, but was released after serving 123 days.
   Tyler and his family later sued the Berodts, Scott County,
Sheriff Forest Ashcraft and sheriff's investigator Howard in
federal court.
   The lawsuit contended that the warrantless monitoring of the
Tyler cordless phone violated the family's Fourth Amendment privacy
rights.
   U.S. District Judge Harold D. Vietor in Davenport threw out the
suit, and the dismissal was upheld by the 8th Circuit court.
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for the Tylers said the
technological differences between a cordless phone and a
traditional phone are not enough ``to remove all Fourth Amendment
protection for the daily communications of millions of people.''
   ``Americans justifiably expect privacy in their residential
phone conversations,'' the appeal said. ``That expectation is not
based on faith in technology but on faith in our constitutional
system.''
   The case is Tyler vs. Berodt, 89-691.

   Afghan rebels today claimed they
killed 200 Communist soldiers and repulsed hundreds more in a
monthlong government assault on guerrilla positions in northwestern
Afghanistan.
   The official rebel information agency MIDIA said 70 rebels died
in the fighting, which also destroyed scores of homes in the
district of Shireen Tagab, about 75 miles south of Afghanistan's
border with the Soviet Union.
   The rebel agency blamed the destruction on ``indiscriminate
bombing and shelling,'' by government troops.
   Meanwhile MIDIA said Moscow sent two MiG-29 aircraft, reportedly
the latest in the Soviet fleet of fighter jets, to Afghanistan
along with a group of Soviet pilots. Like most reports from both
the rebels and the Afghan government, its authenticity could not be
independently verified.
   The pilots have been stationed in central Afghanistan's Bagram
airforce base, the country's largest, MIDIA said.
   U.S.-backed guerrilla fighters, based in Pakistan, have been
fighting for more than 11 years to topple successive Communist
governments in Afghanistan. Until a year ago, more than 103,000
Soviet soldiers fought alongside Afghan government troops.

Controversy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected the appeal of
a Tennessee high school student pulled from a race for student
council president after giving a speech officials deemed
disrespectful.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that officials at
Unicoi County High in Erwin, Tenn., did not violate Dean Poling's
free-speech rights.
   Poling was a junior running for student council president when
in May 1987 he delivered a school assembly campaign speech critical
of the school's administration.
   ``If you want to break the iron grip of this school, vote for me
for president,'' Poling told the assembly audience.
   He also singled out the school's assistant principal in charge
of discipline for criticism. ``The admninistration plays tricks
with your mind and they hope you won't notice. For example, why
does Mr. Davidson stutter while he is on the intercom? He doesn't
have a speech impediment,'' Poling said.
   Because of the speech, school principal Ellis Murphy
disqualified Poling from the student council presidency race. He
later was elected president of his senior class.
   Murphy said Poling's speech had a disruptive effect on the
school administration's authority, and had shown insensitivity and
bad taste in its remarks about the assistant principal.
   Poling's parents sued school officials and the school board in
their son's behalf, seeking $300,000 in damages for an asserted
violation of his free-speech rights.
   A federal judge threw out the suit without a trial, and the 6th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal by a 2-1 vote
last April 18.
   ``For all we know there may in fact have been an overreaction
(by school authorities),'' the appeals court said. ``But a federal
court is obviously not the ideal body to try to answer such a
question.''
   It added: ``Dean Poling appears to be an intelligent and
imaginative young man, and probably no more anarchistic than many
of his teachers at his age. Like most teen-agers, Dean doubtless
feels embarrassment very keenly _ but he may not fully have
appreciated that the assistant principals of this world are
sentient beings also, some of whom may even be capable of
experiencing embarrassment themselves.''
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Gilbert Merritt said Poling's
remarks amounted to ``political speech, pure and simple'' and that
the action taken against him was unconstitutional.
   In a landmark 1969 ruling, the Supreme Court said high school
students do not ``shed their constitutional rights to freedom of
speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate,'' and ruled that
officials wrongly had banned the wearing of anti-war armbands.
   But the court in 1986 gave school administrators broad
disciplinary powers that include suspending students who use vulgar
language.
   And in 1988 the justices gave school officials new authority to
censor student newspapers and other forms of student expression at
school-sponsored events.
   In the appeal acted on today, Poling said the test for whether
student speech is constitutionally protected ``is not rudeness or
impoliteness but disruption and disorder.'' The appeal said
Poling's 1987 speech was not disruptive and caused no disorder.
   School officials urged that Poling's appeal be rejected. They
said that his speech, unlike the wearing of an anti-war armband,
did not just happen to occur on school grounds but was part of a
school-sponsored activity.
   The case is Poling vs. Murphy, 89-678.

<HEAD>Court Won't Reinstate Award in Hired-Killer Case from Texas</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to reinstate a
$9.4 million award won, and then lost, by the family of a woman
whose husband hired her killer through an ad in Soldier of Fortune
magazine.
   The justices, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that threw out a much-publicized jury verdict against the
magazine.
   Although the case had been viewed as one testing the scope of
free-speech and free-press rights, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals did not invoke those constitutional issues in its ruling
last August.
   Instead, the appeals court relied on Texas liability law.
   Soldier of Fortune ``owed no duty to refrain from publishing a
facially innocuous classified advertisement when the ad's content _
at most _ made its message ambiguous,'' the appeals court ruled.
   The August decision overturned the $9.4 million award won in a
wrongful-death lawsuit filed by the son and mother of Sandra Black,
who was killed in her Bryan, Texas, home in 1985.
   Mrs. Black's husband, Robert, hired John Wayne Hearn for $10,000
to kill her after seeing his ad in a 1984 issue of the magazine.
The ad described Hearn as an ex-Marine and ``weapons specialist''
available for ``high risk assignments'' in this country or overseas.
   Black was convicted and sentenced to death for arranging his
wife's murder. He is a prisoner on Texas' death row. Hearn, also
convicted of two contract killings in Florida, is serving three
life sentences in a Florida prison.
   A federal jury in Houston ruled that Soldier of Fortune, based
in Boulder, Colo., and aimed at adventurers and military
enthusiasts, had negligently contributed to Mrs. Black's killing.
   The jury awarded Mrs. Black's son, Gary, and her mother,
Marjorie Eimann, $1.9 million in compensatory damages and $7.5
million in punitive damages.
   But the 5th Circuit court said, ``Without a more specific
indication of illegal intent than Hearn's ad or its context
provided ... (the magazine) did not violate the required standard
of conduct by publishing an ad that later played a role in criminal
activity.''
   After last August's ruling, E. Barrett Prettyman Jr., a lawyer
for Soldier of Fortune publisher Robert Brown, said the jury's
verdict ``would not only have put the magazine out of business but
would have had an extraordinarily harmful effect on magazines and
publishers of all kinds.''
   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Mrs. Black's son and
mother said the appeals court actually relied on the Constitution's
free-speech protections, not Texas law, in ruling for the magazine.
   ``Regardless of the label the court applies to its reasoning, it
appears that the First Amendment was the principal inspiration for
its ruling,'' the appeal contended. It said Hearn's ad was not
entitled to such protection because it was ``commercial speech
related to illegal activity.''
   The case is Eimann vs. Soldier of Fortune, 89-790.

<HEAD>Court to Review Dispute Over Welfare Aid in Virginia Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to review a
dispute over how much welfare aid some needy families are entitled
to receive.
   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal aimed
at limiting the payments in a Virginia case.
   At issue are features of the Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) program.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last March ruled partly in
favor of welfare officials and partly in favor of AFDC recipients.
   The appeals court said Social Security benefits paid to any
child in a household must be considered in determining eligibility
for AFDC payments to the family. That has the effect of reducing
AFDC payments.
   Virginia families participating in the program said the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, in restricting AFDC
benefits, misinterpreted a 1984 budget-cutting law.
   The 4th Circuit court also ruled that the first $50 a month
families receive in Social Security benefits must be disregarded
when determining AFDC payments.
   The Bush administration asked the justices to overturn that part
of the appeals court decision. A separate appeal filed in behalf of
the Virginia families involved in the case was not acted on today.
   Justice Department lawyers said the $50-disregard provision,
enacted by Congress in 1974, applies only to child support payments
made by an absent parent _ and not to Social Security benefits paid
to a child of a deceased or disabled parent.
   The 4th Circuit court disagreed.
   ``We perceive no distinction between support derived directly
from a father's wages and support provided indirectly through''
Social Security, the appeals court said. ``The money to support the
child comes directly through the father or indirectly through
insurance he earned when working.''
   Government lawyers said if the appeals court's view of the
$50-disregard provision were adopted nationwide, states and the
federal government would have to pump $44 million more each year
into the AFDC program.
   The 4th Circuit court's ruling is binding law in Virginia, West
Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina.
   The government appeal noted that the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals has issued a ruling that conflicts with the 4th Circuit
court decision.
   The case acted on today is Sullivan vs. Stroop, 89-535.

<HEAD>Opposition Leaders Take Steps to Reassure Lawmakers of Possible
Merger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY TUNNEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders considering a
merger of two political parties met today with their lawmakers in
efforts to convince them that the new alliance could curtail
opposition infighting.
   The Republican Democratic Party and the New Democratic
Republican Party, the nation's second- and third-largest opposition
parties, have agreed in principle to form a new political party by
merging forces for mid-year local elections, the first such
elections in South Korea in three decades.
   The combined party then could outshadow the current leading
opposition group, the Party for Peace and Democracy, and
potentially offer a forceful challenge to the governing party.
   Kim Young-sam, leader of the Republican Democrats, today said
the merger must be completed by March after ``prudently collecting
opinions'' within and outside the party.
   Kim Jong-pil, head of the smallest opposition party, told a
caucus of his lawmakers that the ``goal is to shift to a better
political system, which can operate better in the long run.''
   Kim Jong-pil is related by marriage to former President Park
Chung-hee and served as prime minister in the early 1970s. He also
was the organizer and first director of the national security
agency, formerly called the KCIA.
   Some lawmakers said they would boycott a move to join with Kim
Jong-pil's party because they did not want to be associated with
past authoritarian regimes and instead would form an independent
voting bloc in Parliament.
   South Korea has four political parties and most politicians
regard the system as unworkable. Repeated efforts among party
leaders to compromise have failed.
   In the 1987 presidential elections, opposition votes were split
by two main opposition parties, helping governing party candidate
Roh Tae-woo win by a narrow margin. The opposition leaders were
blamed by some for ignoring popular demand for a united opposition
candidate.
   Dissidents and radicals, claiming their views are not
represented by the four major political parties, have announced
plans to organize a progressive political party supported by
workers, farmers and the poor.

<HEAD>Court to Take Fresh Look at Labor Union Issue in Idaho Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to take a fresh
look at whether labor unions may be sued in state courts for
alleged failure to assure safe conditions for workers.
   The court said it will decide whether the United Steelworkers of
America may be sued for alleged negligence in a 1972 Idaho silver
mine disaster that killed 91 people.
   The disaster occurred May 2, 1972, at the Sunshine Mine in
Kellogg. The U.S. Bureau of Mines said an underground fire
apparently started when timbers and debris ignited spontaneously.
The 91 miners died of asphyxiation or carbon monoxide poisoning.
   Families of dead miners sued the union, alleging that a safety
committee member appointed by the union had failed during monthly
inspections to point out or correct such problems as corroded
oxygen-breathing equipment and padlocked rescue equipment.
   The Idaho Supreme Court ruled in 1986 that the union could be
sued in state court.
   But the justices told the state court to reconsider its ruling
after they, in 1987, gave unions new protection against such state
court suits.
   The 1987 ruling said such suits generally are pre-empted by
federal labor law. The justices stressed the need for 50-state
uniformity in interpreting requirements of collective bargaining
agreements.
   But the Idaho Supreme Court, in reconsidering the Sunshine Mine
case, said the negligence claims were different because a union
member was on the inspection team.
   The suit against the United Steelworkers does not depend upon
any interpretation of the union's collective bargaining agreement
with the mine owners, the state court said.
   ``We are not faced with looking at the collective bargaining
agreement to determine whether it imposes some new duty upon the
union,'' the state court said. ``Rather it is conceded the union
undertook to inspect and, thus, the issue is solely whether that
inspection was negligently performed under traditional Idaho
(personal injury) law.''
   The state court relied heavily on a 1988 Supreme Court ruling
that reinstated a suit against a union by a woman who said she was
fired improperly. The justices in that case said unions may be sued
for violating state laws as long as courts can decide the suit
without interpreting collective bargaining agreements.
   The case acted on today is United Steelworkers vs. Rawson,
89-322.

<HEAD>Court Rejects Challenge to Oregon Tax By Alaska, USAir</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed states to
impose on airlines a tax partially based on flight time over the
states.
   The court, without comment, rejected a challenge to an Oregon
tax described by two airlines as a toll booth in the sky.
   Lawyers for Alaska Airlines and USAir said, ``Oregon has erected
a toll booth at 35,000 feet for interstate airplanes wishing to
pass over the state.''
   The formula for calculating an airline's property taxes includes
the time an aircraft spends in the air over Oregon, even if the
plane does not land or take off from there.
   The two airlines said the tax for such flights almost doubles
the amount they owe Oregon each year. Alaska Airlines said it
amounted to an extra $750,000 for 1988.
   The Oregon Supreme Court upheld the levy last February.
   The state court said the tax is not an assessment on
overflights. ``More precisely, the formula reflected that portion
of time that each airline's aircraft property spent on the ground
or in the air in Oregon,'' it said.
   The state court also said there is an adequate connection
between the tax and the ``benefits, opportunities and protection
conferred or afforded'' the airlines by the state. The tax ``need
not be assessed only as compensation for services provided,'' it
added.
   The U.S. Supreme Court justices since 1977 has allowed states to
tax interstate business if the levy ``is fairly apportioned, does
not discriminate against interstate commerce and is fairly related
to services which the state provides to the taxpayer.''
   Alaska Airlines and USAir argued that Oregon provides no
services for overflights.
   Any monitoring of such flights is done by the federal
government, the airlines said. Any help the states might give for
emergency landings is compensated by a part of the property tax
assessed against schedued landings and departures, they added.
   Both airlines have flights in and out of Oregon, and they did
not challenge the portion of the property tax assessed against
those flights.
   But they said taxing aircraft ``simply because they have flown
over that state'' violates the Constitution's due-process
guarantees and its protection for interstate commerce.
   The airlines said Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have similar taxes.
   The case is Alaska Airlines vs. Oregon, 89-346.

<HEAD>Nebraska Challenge on Farm Support Payments Rejected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today let federal officials
place special limits on farm-support payments for married couples.
   The court, without comment, rejected a challenge to an
Agriculture Department regulation that treats a husband and wife as
one person when they apply for the payments.
   The case stemmed from a department rule limiting how much money
any person may receive in crop subsidies.
   A group called Women Involved in Farm Economics, or WIFE,
challenged the rule in 1988, when the maximum per-person payment
was $50,000.
   WIFE, founded in Sidney, Neb., in 1976, argued that married
couples are barred unfairly from applying for two payments even
though other farming partnerships are allowed to apply for multiple
payments.
   The regulation unfairly classified a husband and wife to be one
person regardless of their separate interests and responsibilities,
the group said.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the regulation in
June, overruling a federal judge who had thrown it out.
   The appeals court said treating a husband and wife as one person
in such cases is reasonable because of their ``financial
interdependence.''
   ``Married couples, as a group, are more likely than other
partners in farming enterprises to share completely in the products
of their efforts,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also noted that Congress now permits a husband
and wife to be treated as two people in special circumstances. The
amended law says couples may apply for double support payments if
each engaged in unrelated farming operations prior to marriage and
continue to operate separate farms during their marriage.
   The case is WIFE vs. Yeutter, 89-366.

<HEAD>Penthouse Publisher's N.J. Casino Suit Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today killed Penthouse
magazine publisher Robert Guccione's $400 million lawsuit against
the federal government in connection with the FBI's Abscam
investigation.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that dismissed
Guccione's suit.
   In Abscam, a highly publicized ``sting'' operation in the late
1970s, FBI agents posed as representatives of phony Arab sheiks
looking for investment opportunities.
   A key figure in the operation was Melvin Weinberg, a con man
turned FBI informant and middleman.
   Guccione said Weinberg promised him that the bogus sheiks would
finance an Atlantic City, N.J., casino if Guccione would take part
in bribing New Jersey officials to obtain a casino license.
   The magazine publisher said he refused to go along, and Weinberg
then spread rumors that Guccione had financial problems and was
connected to organized crime figures.
   As a result, the suit said, Guccione was unable to secure
legitimate financing for a casino from 1979 to 1983.
   A 1983 Senate report criticized the FBI for its handling of
Weinberg. The report said the Guccione episode is ``a chilling
reminder of the risks imposed by lax procedures and inadequate
supervision of an informant like Weinberg.''
   Guccione's suit accused federal officials of negligently
supervising Weinberg.
   The government enjoys broad immunity from being sued, but under
the Federal Tort Claim Act has surrendered some of that protection.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last May upheld a judge's
ruling that threw out the suit, ruling that the federal law does
not permit Guccione to sue.
   ``The United States is not liable for the intentional (injuries
caused by) those carrying out its business, even though (Guccione)
alleges a claim of primary negligence on the part of the United
States in failing to supervise or otherwise avoid foreseeable
risks,'' the appeals court said.
   The case is Guccione vs. U.S., 89-553.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
FBI agent's multi-million-dollar libel lawsuit over a book about a
deadly 1973 confrontation between Indians and federal agents at
Wounded Knee, S.D.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out
David Price's suit against Peter Matthiessen, author of ``In the
Spirit of Crazy Horse,'' and Viking Penguin Inc., the book's
publisher.
   On Feb. 27, 1973, an armed group of Indians with grievances
about the federal government's handling of Indian affairs occupied
the village of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.
   The FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs
police sealed off the village by setting up roadblocks. Before the
71-day standoff ended, two Indians were killed and a deputy marshal
was wounded.
   Two years later, two FBI agents were killed on the reservation.
Leonard Peltier, a leader of the American Indian Movement, was
convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the two killings.
   Price, an FBI agent assigned to the Pine Ridge Reservation
during much of the 1970s, contended in his suit that the book
falsely accused him of corruption and dishonesty for his role in
investigating the occupation and shootout.
   The 1984 suit had sought $25 million in compensatory damages,
plus punitive damages, legal fees and court costs.
   Faced with the suit, the publisher withdrew the book from
circulation.
   A federal judge dismissed the suit in 1988 after ruling that the
sued-over statements were expressions of Matthiessen's opinion, and
therefore absolutely immune from such legal action.
   By that time, court records indicate, the defendants had spent
over $1 million on the suit.
   The judge also said Price was a public official and that he had
failed to prove the allegedly libelous statements were published
with ``actual malice.''
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal last
Aug. 7, agreeing that the published statements about Price are
expressed as opinion, not fact.
   The appeals court said Price had failed ``to persuade us that
this is a factual matter capable of the jury's resolution, to show
that he could demonstrate its falsity, and to convince us that he
could show with clear and convincing evidence that the author had a
high degree of awareness of a particular statement's probable
falsity.''
   The appeals court added: ``That agent Price cannot surmount
these obstacles implies no condemnation of him ... In its entirety,
`Crazy Horse' focuses more on public institutions and social forces
than it does on any public official. The sentiments it expresses
are debatable. We favor letting the debate continue.''
   In his appeal, Price said the lower courts wrongly portrayed as
opinion, and not facts, ``allegations of specific criminal
wrongdoing.''
   The case is Price vs. Viking Penguin, 89-741.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to hear a
constitutional challenge to a federal rule banning telephone
companies from affiliating with cable television companies in their
service area.
   The justices, without comment, turned away arguments by a small
Indiana telephone company that the cross-ownership rule violates
its free-speech rights.
   Government lawyers said the appeal filed by the Northwestern
Indiana Telephone Co. (NITCO) should be rejected because the
company had failed to raise its free-speech argument with the
Federal Communications Commission.
   NITCO provides telephone service in five communities south of
Gary, Ind. The company is owned by Robert and Gerald Mussman; it
has been in their family since 1932.
   The FCC received a complaint in 1983 over NITCO's leasing space
on its telephone poles to Northwest Indiana CATV Inc. for cable
distribution lines. The cable company is owned by Robert Mussman's
son, Rhys.
   The commission in 1985 ruled that the affiliation between NITCO
and the cable company violated the cross-ownership rule in effect
since 1970. The commission ordered divestiture of the cable TV
facilities in three communities within NITCO's service area.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the commission's
order last April after refusing to rule on NITCO's constitutional
challenge because it had not been raised before the commission.
   Northwest Indiana CATV last July sold the cable systems that
were the subject of the commission's divestiture order.
   The case is Northwestern Indiana Telephone Co. vs. FCC, 89-501.

   A West German man and his South African
girlfriend were kidnapped and taken at gunpoint across the border
into Angola while canoeing on Christmas Eve, police and witnesses
said today.
   Axel Puhl, who has lived in the South African-controlled
territory of Namibia for 15 years, disappeared into Angola in the
area controlled by the U.S.-backed National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), friends said.
   He and his girlfriend, Anelise Gevers, were reported missing by
workers at a Mission Hospital near the Kavango River when they did
not return to their parked vehicles after a canoeing trip.
   Police said witnesses reported seeing unidentified men firing at
the canoes and forcing the two to the Angolan side of the river,
where they were taken away at gunpoint.
   Puhl, 43, works for Phillips Telecommunications, an
international company. The West German observer mission in Namibia
said it had been notified of the reported abduction and was

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal of Ohio Chemist Who Sued Texas Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today turned down the appeal
of an Ohio biochemist who sued for libel after he was called a
``quack'' and an ``outrageous hoke artist'' for opposing
fluoridation of San Antonio's water supply.
   The justices, without comment, let stand rulings that threw out
John Yiamouyiannis' suit against the San Antonio Express-News and
columnist Paul Thompson.
   The rulings also dismissed most of the libel allegations against
the Bexar County Medical Society and its spokesman, Dr. Randall
Priessig.
   Yiamouyiannis, a resident of Delaware, Ohio, became involved in
the public debate leading to a 1985 referendum on fluoridation in
the Texas city.
   In an Oct. 25 column, Thompson chastised local radio talk show
hosts for ``presenting an outrageous hoke artist and imported
fearmonger ... as if he had solid credentials.''
   ``Any radioman who can't spot the difference between a quack
like ... Yiamouyiannis and authorized spokesmen for the medical,
dental and research professions of the country ought to be kicked
off the air,'' Thompson wrote.
   The county medical association and Preissig also referred to
Yiamouyiannis as a quack, and asserted that he had headed an
institution that opposed the pasteurization of milk and vaccines
for smallpox and polio.
   A state judge threw out the libel suit before it reached a jury,
and a state appeals court upheld dismissal of most of the
allegations.
   The appeals court said most of the references to Yiamouyiannis
``are assertions of pure opinion,'' and entitled to absolute
immunity against libel suits.
   But the appeals court said the medical association and Preissig
could be forced to defend themselves at trial for the statement
about the institution Yiamouyiannis was said to have headed.
   The Texas Supreme Court refused to hear the biochemist's ensuing
appeal last Sept. 13.
   The appeal acted on today sought to reinstate the entire suit.
   The case is Yiamouyiannis vs. Thompson, 89-673.

   The justices said they will hear an appeal by a former post
office worker in Texas ordered to repay a bank $90,412 he allegedly
stole through credit card fraud. The worker pleaded guilty to a
single count of credit card fraud specifying only that more than
$1,000 had been stolen.
   Frasiel L. Hughey worked at a post office in San Antonio when he
was indicted for mail theft and credit card fraud. He pleaded
guilty to one count of running up charges of more than $1,000 on a
Mastercard issued by MBank USA to Hershey Godfrey.
   The government said it had evidence Hughey stole 21 cards issued
by MBank and warned him he might be ordered to repay the bank
$147,646.
   Hughey said he should be required to repay only $10,422, the
amount he said was charged to Godfrey's card.
   A federal judge sentenced Hughey to eight years in prison and
ordered him to repay $90,412 to MBank.
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the restitution
order last July.
   The appeals court gave an expansive intrepretation to the
federal Victim and Witness Protection Act.
   ``At the minimum, the (law) does not limit restitution to the
amount specified in an indictment,'' the appeals court said. ``The
restitution order (in Hughey's case) had a significant connection
with the conviction offense.''
   ``One of the principal purposes of the act was to ensure that
wrongdoers, to the degree possible, make their victims whole. If
restitution were limited to the count of conviction, given the high
levels of plea bargaining within our criminal system, in the
majority of cases a victim could not be made whole,'' the appeals
court said.
   The appeals court also rejected Hughey's plea that he is too
poor to pay.
   The Justice Department urged the Supreme Court not to disturb
the appeals court ruling. The department said limiting the amount
of restitution to the amount someone is convicted of stealing would
violate Congress's intent to compensate crime victims adequately.
   The case is Hughey vs. U.S., 89-5691.

   The Red Army will pull out an airborne
regiment, two tank battalions and 6,000 troops this year as part of
Moscow's unilateral troop withdrawal, a senior Soviet military
official said today.
   The troop cuts, to include also a mechanized infantry regiment,
will cover more that 40 military aircraft, 120 tanks, some 180
armored cars and 400 other motorized vehicles, said Col. Gen.
Grigory Krivosheyev, Soviet deputy chief of staff.
   ``The decisive majority of the troops pulled out from Hungary
will be demobilized,'' the news agency MTI quoted Krivosheyev as
saying. He did not elaborate.
   The cuts, which started last year, are part of the Soviet army
withdrawal plans from Eastern Europe announced by President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev in December 1988. According to the plan, the Kremlin
will remove 50,000 troops stationed in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany.
   There are some 52,000 Russian troops stationed in Hungary.

<HEAD>Religious Order Asks U.S., Nicaragua to Investigate Nuns' Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FOND DU LAC, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Roman Catholic order that lost two
nuns in a Nicaraguan ambush last week asked today that the deaths
be investigated by both the United States and Nicaragua.
   A statement from the Sisters of St. Agnes urged the two
governments ``to investigate fully the circumstances surrounding
this tragic incident so that justice can be served.''
   Sisters Maureen Courtney, 45, a native of Milwaukee, and Teresa
de Jesus Rosales, 24, of Nicaragua were killed in the ambush Jan. 1
in a remote region in eastern Nicaragua. Another nun and a bishop
were injured in the attack.
   The nuns were killed while driving in a white pickup truck
marked by yellow crosses. The truck was hit by both a rocket and
gunfire before the occupants identified themselves as religious
workers.
   The Nicaraguan government has blamed the attack on U.S.-backed
Contra rebels, but a spokesman for the rebels last week denied any
involvement.
   The Fond du Lac-based order's general superior, Sister Jean
Steffes, said it was obvious that the loss of innocent lives would
continue if there is no resolution of the decade-old civil war in
Nicaragua.
   ``We know that our sisters are being mourned by name, but we
grieve for the countless peasants, campesinos and others whose
names may not go down in history but who also left loved ones
behind,'' the statement said.
   The group has been serving in Nicaragua since 1945.

<HEAD>Initial Review of Louisiana Higher Education Left to Appeals Court</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 3rd graf, The justices, to show that stay now
lifted.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today left it to a federal
appeals court to take first crack at deciding whether Louisiana's
system of higher education must undergo sweeping changes to help
desegregate the state's public colleges and universities.
   The justices, in a brief order, said they do not yet have the
authority to review the case. The order means the case will proceed
to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   The justices last August blocked any ordered changes, but
today's action lifted that postponement. Enforcement of the
desegregation plan envisioned by a three-judge federal court could
begin unless the 5th Circuit court grants a similar stay.
   The three-judge court's July ruling would replace four governing
boards with a single board over all public higher education in
Louisiana, restrict admissions at some universities, limit degree
programs most schools can offer and establish a community college
system.
   The ruling also called for the gradual merging of the law
schools at Louisiana State University and Southern University, the
state's largest predominantly black school. Southern's 13,000
students attend three undergraduate campuses and the law school in
Baton Rouge.
   Of the current four boards, one governs the LSU system, another
governs the Southern University system and a third oversees all
other schools. Those three boards answer to the State Board of
Trustees for Higher Education.
   ``The present scheme ... has perpetuated illegal segregation in
Louisiana's higher education,'' the three-judge court ruled in a
case begun in 1974, when Justice Department officials sued in
behalf of black students.
   The four-board system has resulted in violations of a federal
anti-discrimination law and the federal Constitution, the
three-judge court said.
   The lower court ordered designation of Louisiana State
University as the unified system's flagship school, with the
greatest number of graduate and research programs and the strictest
admissions requirements.
   It also called for creation of an intermediate level of four
institutions, including Southern, to offer significant doctoral and
other graduate programs.
   Eight other schools, including the predominantly black Grambling
State University, would be designated as a third tier and limited
to offering undergraduate degrees.
   Four colleges would become part of the new community college
system.
   Court documents indicate that black enrollment at such
historically white schools as LSU, Louisiana Tech, McNeese State,
Nicholls State, Northeast Louisiana and Southeastern Louisiana is
less than 10 percent while blacks comprise over 99 percent of the
enrollments at Southern and Grambling.
   The three-judge court's ruling was appealed by the Southern
University board, Gov. Buddy Roemer's administration and Attorney
General William Guste.
   Roemer and Guste each said his appeal represented the state's
``official'' views in the case, and the governor in December asked
the justices to dismiss Guste's appeal.
   The attorney general's appeal sought to have the three-judge
court's ruling thrown out, arguing that ``statistics alone'' on the
race of students at each school cannot prove unlawful bias when
each school is open to students of any race.
   The governor's appeal also argued that the three-judge court
wrongly ruled that the state was guilty of unlawful bias, but did
not attack that portion of the lower court's order requiring one
governing board.
   Roemer has been a champion of a single-board system but has not
been able to get the state Legislature to go along with the idea.
   The Bush administration urged the justices to send the case to
the 5th Circuit court and not agree to handle an appeal directly
from the three-judge court.
   Justice Department lawyers argued that the case should have been
handled by a lone trial judge and not the special three-judge court.
   Taking issue with that view, Roemer attorney John N. Kennedy
told the justices, ``All of higher education in Louisiana is
awaiting final resolution.'' He urged the high court not to send
the case to the 5th Circuit court, where any decision is likely to
be appealed to the Supreme Court.
   ``Until this litigation is resolved,'' Kennedy said, ``the
operations of Louisiana's colleges and universities remains subject
to extraordinary confusion and instability.''
   The cases are Louisiana ex rel Guste vs. U.S., 89-556; Southern
University Board of Supervisors vs. U.S., 89-557; and Louisiana ex
rel Roemer vs. U.S., 89-771.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias called a
seven-hour truce today to allow the Red Cross to evacuate at least
17 bodies that had been lying in the fields of battle in southern
Lebanon.
   The bodies, wrapped in blankets and plastic bags, belonged to
militiamen of the Syrian-backed, mainstream Amal movement, which
has been fighting the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   The cease-fire near three southern villages took place a day
after Palestinian guerrillas deployed in southern Lebanon to form a
buffer zone to disengage the Shiite militias.
   But elsewhere in the Iqlim al-Tuffah province, particularly
around the villages of Jarjou, Jbaa and Ein Bouswar, Hezbollah and
Amal fighters kept up a steady exchange of artillery fire.
   The 17 victims recovered today raised the overall toll in the
17-day-old inter-Shiite battle to 94 killed and 275 wounded, by
police count.
   The International Committee of the Red Cross dispatched eight
ambulances and eight station wagons with medical teams from Beirut
to evacuate casualties trapped in the fighting, a Red Cross
statement said.
   It was unclear how many wounded people were evacuated.
   Statements by the commands of the rival factions in Beirut spoke
of dozens of decomposed bodies lying in the fields, in addition to
wounded civilians and combatants in urgent need of medical care.
   Police said both factions withheld fire in the villages of Kfar
Hatta, Kfar Milki and Kfar Beit as the Red Cross teams rolled in.
   About 700 Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas now man a
three-mile buffer separating the villages of Kfar Hatta, Kfar Milki
and Kfar Beit.
   That prevents the two sides from launching major ground attacks,
but it does not stop them firing artillery shells and rockets over
the heads of the Palestinian guerrillas in the buffer.
   The fighting had raged southeast of the Palestinian refugee
camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh near Sidon, a provincial
capital 25 miles south of Beirut.
   Police has said the guerrillas' intervention was ordered by PLO
chief Yasser Arafat to prevent either Shiite faction from gaining
territory from which the two camps, Arafat's main power base in
Lebanon, can be shelled.
   Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
said in an interview published by the conservative Beirut daily
newspaper Al-Anwar on Monday that the Shiitte war ``is drawing to
an end.'' He did not elaborate.
   The two Shiite groups for two years have struggled for power
within the 1.2 million-strong Shiite community, Lebanon's largest
sect.

<TEXT>
   A man who police say has a bullet lodged in
his skull from a shooting two months ago was holding five children
hostage at gunpoint today in a barricaded apartment, authorities
said.
   The man, whose name was not released, is the father of three of
the children, and the other two children are related, police said.
Their precise relation was not immediately known.
   The youngsters range in age from 18 months to 11 years.
   ``He's assuring us that they're all right,'' said police
spokesman Clyde Ross. ``We're taking him at his word at this time.''
   Police said that about 10 a.m., nearly 10 hours after the
incident began, the man began pushing furniture in front of the
door of the apartment in an apparent attempt to barricade himself
and the children inside.
   As he did so, armed SWAT team members with their guns drawn
surrounded the block of apartments where the downstairs unit is
located.
   Authorities also said they believe he had slapped at least one
of the children, but there was no indication the child was badly
hurt.
   The 30-year-old man apparently was shot about two months ago,
and the bullet never was removed from his skull, officials said.
   Police have talked on the telephone with the man, who was said
to be armed with a shotgun, but communication has been sporadic and
the man reportedly hung up on police at one point.
   Officers were called to the west San Antonio apartment complex
shortly after midnight following a report that a man was fighting
with his wife. The woman escaped the apartment and was treated for
facial abrasions at Methodist Hospital, officials said.

   An alleged Nazi war criminal who
fled the United States to avoid possible deportation to the Soviet
Union will go on trial in West Germany later this month,
authorities said today.
   Boleslav Maikovskis, 86, will go on trial Jan. 18 charged with
murder and complicity in the shooting deaths of 170 residents of a
Latvian village during World War II, according to a statement by
the state court in Muenster.
   He also was accused of ordering the hanging of a Jewish resident
in the Latvian village of Audrine, the statement said.
   Maikovskis, a former resident of Mineola, N.Y., fled the United
States in 1987. He was facing U.S. deportation proceedings for war
crimes allegedly committed when he served as a policeman in Latvia
during World War II.
   The Soviet Union in 1965 sentenced Maikovskis to death in
absentia for his alleged role in burning down a village and helping
kill more than 130 men, women and children in Audrine. The deaths
occurred while Maikovskis allegedly was acting as commander of a
pro-Nazi police force in the village during World War II.
   The United States began deporttaion proceedings against
Maikovskis in 1976, but they were delayed by several appeals. His
latest appeal was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1986, and he
fled to West Germany in 1987.
   Maikovskis applied for asylum in West Germany, but was arrested
in his home in Muenster, near the border with the Netherlands, in
October 1988.

<HEAD>Court to Rule on Tax Withholding in Pennsylvania Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today agreed to settle a
conflict over the government's power to keep taxes withheld from
businesses about to declare bankruptcy.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by the trustee of bankrupt
American International Airways seeking to recover $700,000 in taxes
paid to the Internal Revenue Service.
   The airline company had become delinquent by the spring of 1984
in withholding Social Security and income taxes from employee wages
and excise taxes collected from passengers.
   The IRS then ordered the airline to file monthly, instead of
quarterly, tax returns and open a special bank account to handle
the tax deposits.
   American International filed for bankruptcy on July 19, 1984, to
try and reorganize the business and pay off some of the money owed
creditors. That effort failed and three months later a trustee was
appointed to liquidate the company.
   The trustee sought to recover $1.6 million in taxes paid to the
IRS in the months leading up to the liquidation.
   A bankruptcy judge in Pennsylvania permitted the trustee to
recover $700,000 from the government and the IRS appealed to the
3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals based in Philadelphia.
   The appeals court ruled last June that the trustee may not
recover the $700,000. The balance collected by the IRS was not at
issue in the decision.
   The appeals court said that under federal law the withheld taxes
must be considered placed in a special fund held in trust for the
IRS and are not part of the company's property protected by the
bankruptcy proceedings.
   The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court to take the case
even though the government's position was upheld by the 3rd Circuit
court. The department said another federal appeals court has issued
a conflicting ruling and the high court should resolve the split.
   The case is Begier vs. IRS, 89-393.

   A bitter debate has erupted within
President Virgilio Barco's government over a beefed-up U.S. naval
force in the Caribbean, with Barco favoring the operation, a
newspaper reported today.
   Two opposition parties today protested the increase in U.S. air
and sea patrols in international waters in the Caribbean. The
United States said the operation is an attempt to deter drug
smugglers.
   On Sunday, Barco's foreign minister, Julio Londono Paredes,
reportedly said Colombia rejects any attempt to search Colombian
ships, even in international waters.
   Some news reports, based upon Londono's comments, interpreted
that to mean that Barco himself was angry with the United States
and that there was a rift between Washington and the Barco
government.
   Apparently the rift is within the Colombian government itself,
with the foreign minister and Barco at odds, a Bogota daily with
access to Barco advisers said today.
   Barco accepts the U.S. action and is at odds with his foreign
minister, La Prensa said. Londono has never been pro-American on
international issues, it said.
   The falling out between Londono and Barco started with the U.S.
invasion of Panama on Dec. 20, the newspaper said. The paper
indicated that Barco supported the invasion and Londono was opposed.
   La Prensa is owned by Juan Carlos Pastrana, the son of former
president Misael Pastrana. The daily has repeatedly shown that it
has reliable sources within the Barco government.
   Another Bogota newspaper, El Tiempo, on Sunday printed what it
said was a government statement saying Colombia would refuse to
take part in the U.S. anti-drug program. A government spokesman
today said no such statement existed.
   In Washington on Sunday, Bush administration officials
acknowledged ``some difficulties'' with Colombian authorities over
their plans to deploy warships in the Caribbean in a new campaign
against drug traffickers.
   The national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft blamed the
problems on ``some premature and ... probably inaccurate leaks''
about U.S. intentions.
   The Barco administration has since August been engaged in a
bloody war with cocaine barons. The government's war with
traffickers, while seen as courageous by other countries, has
received little support within Colombia.
   The opposition Conservative Party and the leftist Patriotic
Union Party today criticized the U.S. action.
   The U.S. Embassy in Bogota said Saturday the move to step up air
and sea patrols would be carried out ``far from the Colombian
coast.''
   The embassy announcement came amid persistent radio reports in
Colombia that a United States naval force was planning to enter the
Latin American country's territorial waters to set up a blockade
off its coast.
   The Bush administration has not said how many ships and aircraft
will participate in the drug interdicition operation off the
Colombian coast, though the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy will
reportedly be involved.
   The administration has not given the date on which the
operations are to begin. The JFK and an accompanying guided missile
cruiser, the USS Virginia, left Norfolk, Va., on Thursday for what
the Pentagon said were routine training exercises in the Atlantic.
   An aircraft carrier normally has eight or 12 smaller ships as
part of its battle group, along with an aircraft wing composed of
about 3,000 men and dozens of observation and tracking planes.
   It is estimated that drug cartels in Colombia are responsible
for processing and smuggling 80 percent of the cocaine sold on U.S.
streets.
   Soon after Barco intensified his government's struggle against
drug traffickers on Aug. 18, the United States pledged $65 million
in military aid to help in the fight.
   U.S. officials have said there are between 50 and 100 U.S.
military personnel in the country to help train Colombian security
forces to use the donated equipment.
   Months ago, the Barco administration ruled out the use of U.S.
military forces to fight drug traffickers within Colombia's borders.

   The woman who portrayed the kindly Aunt
Bee on television's ``The Andy Griffith Show'' left her house to
the town hospital and its contents to a center for public
television, an attorney said.
   ``Anybody who reads the will can see that she remembered those

   The huge brick-and-stone house where Ms. Bavier died in her
sleep was bequeathed to Moore Memorial Hospital in Pinehurst, where
the actress was treated several times.
   Ms. Bavier was admitted to two or three times to the hospital,
most recently around last August for an undisclosed ailment,
Williams said.
   The contents of the house, where Ms. Bavier died at 86 on Dec.
6, were donated to the University of North Carolina Center for
Public Television, he said.
   The garage contains her green 1966 Studebaker, which hasn't been
driven since 1983.
   Ms. Bavier shared her home with 15 cats. Her friends placed all
the animals in private homes, except for a black one that has been
too quick to catch.
   Ms. Bavier has lived in the southern North Carolina home since
1972.
   It showcased her belongings, including her cherished Emmy Award,
her collection of leather-bound books and photograph albums. The
pictures include photographs of a young Ron Howard from his days as
Aunt Bee's charge, Opie.

<HEAD>Billy Carter Autobiography Says Grand Jury Probes Bankrupted Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal investigations of Billy Carter's
activities destroyed him financially, the ``first brother'' of
former President Jimmy Carter said in a book he wrote before his
death in 1988.
   Grand juries investigated Billy Carter's role in the family
peanut warehouse and whether the business helped bankroll Jimmy
Carter's presidential campaign.
   The Senate held hearings into Billy Carter's involvement with a
deal between the Libyan government and an American oil company. And
the former president's younger brother also got into trouble with
the Internal Revenue Service.
   Carter wrote that testifying and defending himself was a
full-time job for two years, required four law firms and ``cost me
a small fortune.''
   The hearings ``wiped me out financially,'' Carter wrote in
``Billy,'' published by Edgehill Publications, a subsidiary of
Edgehill Newport, a center for the treatment of alcoholism and drug
abuse at Newport, R.I. The book is in limited national distribution
in hard cover and paperback.
   Carter had nearly completed the book before he died of
pancreatic cancer in September 1988. Writer Ken Estes and Sybil
Carter, Billy's wife of 33 years and co-author of the book,
completed the final chapter.
   In part, the book is an effort to ``set the record straight''
and a way for Carter to help others battling alcoholism, Mrs.
Carter said in an interview with The Albany Herald.
   ``He never ceased to be amazed that people would come up or send
letters that said: `I quit drinking because of you.' It really
touched him.''
   People identified with Billy because he said what he thought,
Mrs. Carter said.
   Billy Carter wrote of his years of high jinks during his
brother's presidency, but the book also covers his childhood, his
battle with alcoholism and his last days fighting cancer.
   He also wrote of his closeness to his mother, ``Miss Lillian''
Carter, and how they both enjoyed a good argument. Carter also
credited his mother, who died in 1983, for one of his best-known
quotes.
   According to Carter, his mother first turned the phrase: ``I've
got a son who thinks he can be president; a daughter (Ruth) who is
a faith-healer; another daughter (Gloria) who rides around on
motorcycles; and another son who drinks beer all the time. If I had
known they would turn out the way they have, I would have remained
a virgin.''
   Her son's widely publicized version was: ``I've got a mother who
joined the Peace Corps at 68; a brother who wants to be president;
a sister who is a holy-roller preacher; and another sister who
rides around on motorcycles. I'm the only sane one in the family.''
   He wrote: ``This is my last chance to give Mama proper credit.''

<HEAD>Texas Lawyers Asked to be Nicer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers and judges concede their profession
probably won't set any standards for social graces, but they're
giving good manners a shot nevertheless.
   A new Lawyer's Creed _ the first such statewide code in the
nation _ was recently approved by the Texas Supreme Court and the
Texas Court of Criminal Appeals.
   It asks the state's 52,000 lawyers for kinder litigation.
   No more obnoxiousness. No more tit-for-tat unprofessional
behavior. No more stalling tactics. And no ``allusions to personal
peculiarities or idiosyncrasies of opposing counsel'' will be
allowed, according to the creed. Lawyers and judges say the
let's-be-civil creed is overdue.
   ``It's kind of like dieting,'' Texas Supreme Court Justice
Eugene Cook said. ``It's a battle that we can win, but it's not
going to be done overnight.''
   Cook said the creed was initiated by Dallas and Houston legal
associations to fight bad behavior and needlessly aggressive
courtroom tactics.
   The offending behavior _ from rudeness to engaging in lengthy
procedural delays to even resorting to fistfights _ has been
clogging court schedules and hampering disposition of cases.
   Cook said some lawyers try to reschedule proceedings on dates
most likely to bother an opponent.
   ``If they know of a time that will be inconvenient _ say the day
your wife is having a baby or the week you've been planning all
year for a vacation _ that's when they'll schedule it,'' he said.
   ``Some people think that it's the way to practice law, to be
rude and abusive and try to intimidate the other side.''
   He said the problems have become increasingly common in the last
five years.
   U.S. District Judge A. Joe Fish said part of the problem may be
the increase of lawyers in the state's largest cities.
   ``I think the Rambo tactics arise out of the feeling that `I'm
never going to see the other lawyer again,''' he said.
   Dallas Bar Association president Al Ellis said financial woes
also have increased courtroom problems.
   ``As the law firms have gotten bigger and the economy has gone
down, there's been a lot of pressure on younger and
middle-management lawyers to produce, and some have responded with
this kind of behavior,'' he said.
   The 34-part Lawyer's Creed, developed by a committee with
representatives from 18 legal associations, relies on voluntary
compliance and includes no specific penalties.
   The creed includes requirements of civility toward peers and
judges and a ban on ``antagonistic or obnoxious behavior.''
   ``Some judges have copies of the creed pasted to their
courthouse doors,'' Cook said. ``They tell the lawyers, go outside
and read it and don't come back in until they learn how to act
accordingly.''

   A man trying to cross illegally into
Zimbabwe from Zambia at night was crushed to death by a rogue
hippopotamus, and his son was seriously injured by the beast,
police said Monday.
   The two-ton hippo chased Gibson Mtonga and his son, Chaipa, on
Saturday night as they were trying to cross the border near
Victoria Falls, said police spokesman Alfred Mulopa.
   Chaipa, 13, told police he was hurled several yards by the
animal, which then killed his father.
   Mulopa said they were turned back by Zimbabwean immigration
authorities earlier Saturday but apparently tried to cross the
border after dark.
   The Victoria Falls border post closes at night _ the time hippos
usually leave the water to forage on land.

   Police said Monday they have arrested a man in
Hong Kong in connection with the seizure of 143 pounds of heroin
concealed in cans of Chinese fruit imported to Los Angeles.
   The man was arrested Saturday after U.S. authorities discovered
the high-grade heroin hidden in 192 cans of litchis in syrup found
in Los Angeles last month, police said.
   The drugs would have sold for about $64 million in the United
States, the statement said.
   Officers of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and U.S. Customs
also arrested two men _ a Chinese and a Vietnamese _ in Alhambra,
Calif., on Saturday in connection with the drug bust, the statement
said.
   The man in Hong Kong was arrested after police raided sites in
the colony and uncovered a drug packaging center in an industrial
building, police said.
   No names were released and investigations into the case were
continuing.

<TEXT>
   A citizens' group has asked the government to stop
building a golf course near Tokyo unless it can show that weed
killers and other chemicals used on the course won't pollute their
water, an official said Monday.
   It was the first time such a request had been made to the
Environmental Disputes Coordination Commission, set up in 1972 to
settle pollution issues by arbitration, said Takashi Tachi of the
prime minister's office.
   Suzoko Ishizaki, one of the leaders of the group, said weed
killers and other chemicals to be used on the Seibu Hanno Country
Club course would contaminate water supplies in the city of Hanno.
   Country club official Tatsuya Hasunuma said the 345-acre course
had been approved in June after public hearings and environmental
assessment by the Saitama prefectural government, but the club is
ready to take any remedial measures that the government suggests.
   Tachi said the coordination commission would try to settle the
dispute through negotiations.
   The golf course, about 30 miles northwest of Tokyo, is to be
completed by 1992 at an estimated $105 million, Hasunuma said.
   Hanno already has six golf courses, with a seventh under
construction.
   As of February 1989, Japan had 1,640 golf courses, and more than
15 million of the nation's 120 million people play golf.

   NASA conducted a stop-and-go
countdown and waited until the last possible minute Monday before
it knuckled under to clouds and scrubbed the launch of the space
shuttle Columbia for 24 hours.
   ``Nice try,'' said launch director Bob Sieck.
   The launch was rescheduled for 7:35 a.m. Tuesday.
   Air Force weather officers had bet 80-20 against weather
permitting a launch Monday. But they said chances were 70-30 that
conditions would be favorable Tuesday with a potential for low
clouds and fog.
   Columbia, with a five-member crew, is scheduled to spend 10 days
in space to launch a Navy communications satellite and to retrieve
a bus-size scientific satellite that will crash to Earth in March
if the rescue fails.
   Despite Monday's rotten odds, NASA officials decided to go
through the complex launch routine on the slim chance of finding a
hole in the clouds and also to exercise the refurbished facilities
on launch pad 39A, which had not been used in four years.
   In fact, the count was interrupted once while six
troubleshooters checked a potential pressure problem with a valve
system that sprays the launch pad with 300,000 gallons of water
just before liftoff. The water absorbs the sound from the engines,
preventing it from bouncing back into the engines and causing
damage.
   The technicians determined that a zero pressure reading was
false and that the system was OK.
   NASA estimates that a launch abort on a weekday costs an extra
$624,000 at the Kennedy Space Center alone, including $377,000 in
lost fuel. There are additional costs at other NASA sites around
the world. The cost of a single shuttle launch is estimated between
$250 million and $300 million.
   Commander Dan Brandenstein and his crew had been strapped into
their flight seats for nearly four hours while weather reports
teetered between go and no-go. Finally, mission control in Houston
radioed: ``We're not going to make it.''
   Over the pad, the sky was fairly clear. But a 30-mile-wide bank
of clouds approaching from the west at 6,000 feet would have made
an emergency return difficult for Brandenstein, who would have to
land the unpowered space ship on a concrete runway near the launch
pad.
   It was the fourth postponement for this particular mission, but
it was only the first time that astronauts were on board, suited up
and ready to go into space.
   The mission is to be the first of 10 for 1990, the most for one
year since the Challenger explosion four years ago.
   During their flight, the astronauts first are to deploy a Navy
communications satellite.
   Then, they are to chase, capture and bring home a satellite
called the Long Duration Exposure Facility or LDEF. The satellite,
essentially a 12-sided frame, is packed with 57 experiments, many
testing the ddurability of various materials exposed to space.
   The satellite has spent nearly six years in orbit and, if it
isn't retrieved, trackers estimate atmospheric drag will make it
fall out of orbit and burn up about March 9, its experiments lost
forever.

<HEAD>Red Cross Removes Bodies From South Lebanon Battlefield</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AHMED MANTASH</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAMADE HILL, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias stopped
their war long enough Monday for the Red Cross to remove 17 bodies
from the battlefield in the villages and apple orchards south of
Sidon.
   The bodies, wrapped in blankets and plastic bags, were of
fighters from Amal, a mainstream militia supported by Syria. Amal
and and Hezbollah, a fundamentalist group loyal to Iran, have been
fighting since Dec. 23 for supremacy among the 1.2 million Shiites
in Lebanon, the nation's largest sect.
   A terrible stench filled the air as bodies were handed over by
Red Cross teams to Amal militiamen who returned them to their
families.
   Police say 94 people have been killed and 275 wounded in the 17
days of fighting in Iqlim al-Tuffah, the Apple Province. Amal and
Hezbollah have battled intermittently sice May 1987 and hundreds of
people have been killed.
   Palestinian guerrillas moved into a buffer zone between the two
sides Monday and a seven-hour truce applied in most villages.
   Iranian envoy Mohammad Ali Besharati, who is trying to mediate a
settlement, visited Syria and drove to Lebanon overnight for talks
with Shiite leaders. A similar mission last week by Besharati, a
deputy foreign minister, failed to stop the fighting.
   On Monday, the International Committee of the Red Cross sent
eight ambulances and eight station wagons with medical teams to
evacuate dead and wounded, a Red Cross statement said.
   Statements from the rival militias issued in Beirut spoke of
dozens of bodies in the orchards of Iqlim al-Tuffah, and of wounded
civilians and combatants in urgent need of medical care.
   Both factions withheld fire Monday in Kfar Hatta, Kfar Milki and
Kfar Beit as the Red Cross teams rolled in, but artillery fire
continued in Jarjou, Jbaa and Ein Bouswar, police said. No
casualties were reported.
   About 700 Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas man a
buffer line slightly more than a mile long that separates Kfar
Hatta, Kfar Milki and Kfar Beit. It prevents the two sides from
launching major ground assaults, but cannot stop artillery and
rocket fire.
   The battleground is ner Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh, Palestinian
refugee camps on the outskirts of Sidon, the ancient port 25 miles
south of Beirut.
   Police say PLO chief Yasser Arafat apparently ordered the
intervention to prevent either Shiite faction from gaining
territory from to shell the camps, which form his main power base
in Lebanon.
   Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,
said in an interview published Monday by Al-Anwar, a conservative
Beirut daily: ``The Apple Province war is drawing to an end. The
curtain will be lowered soon on that conflict.'' He gave no details.
   At his residence in Moslem west Beirut, President Elias Hrawi
received representatives of about 40 nations Monday in a
traditional audience marking the new year.
   ``I have taken over a state where man has been almost totally
destroyed'' by 14 years of civil war, Hrawi told the diplomats.
``My people want deliverance.''
   He said his government was determined to prevent Lebanon's
``disintegration on the eve of a new historic era of international
relations based on openness,'' a reference to superpower detente.
   Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic said political reforms designed to
bring peace between Christians and Moslems soon would be introduced
despite oppositon by Gen. Michel Aoun, the rebellious Christian
commander. The general opposes what he describes as Syria's
dominant role in most of Lebanon.
   Aoun commands 20,000 soldiers in the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave north and east of Beirut, where 1 million Christians live,
and refuses to turn over the presidential palace in Baabda, a
Christian suburb.
   Among those attending the meeting with Hrawi on Monday was
Spanish Archbishop Pablo Puente, the papal nuncio in Lebanon.
   At the Vatican, spokesman Joaquin Navarro said Puente would work
for a ``sincere and loyal dialogue among all parties, taking into
account above all those in a weak position who fear for the future
of themselves and the country.''

<TEXT>
   Students at public colleges and
universities should be kicked out of school for conviction of any
drug offense, Gov. Kay Orr proposed today.
   The Orr anti-drug plan, proposed in her annual state of the
state message, also would require students who enter public higher
education to certify they will be drug free before they can enroll
or receive state student aid.
   They would lose the aid and be expelled from school for any drug
conviction, including misdemeanors, and could re-enter school only
after completing a drug rehabilitation program.
   ``I want to make it crystal clear,'' said Mrs. Orr, a Republican
who is running for re-election this year. ``Nebraska intends to rid
inself of this evil which is corrupting our youth and spawning
crime in our streets. ... Drug abuse is a plague threatening every
single family.''
   Other measures the governor will press in the Legislature
include suspension of driver's licenses for those convicted of drug
offenses; creation of a separate ``corruption of minors'' felony
for those selling drugs to those under 18 or hiring them to work in
a drug operation; and boosting the punichment for first-time
possession of marijuana, which now carries just a $100 fine, to up
to a $500 fine and three months in jail.
   Gary Rex, an aide to the governor, indicated the administration
realized that some of the proposals, if enacted, might be
challenged in court on constitutional grouns.
   Responding to questions, he also acknowledged that people
convicted of other felonies, including murder, could still attend a
public college, university or technical community college _ but
someone convicted of a misdemeanor marijuana charge would be
expelled.

   Students from two opposition parties
battled each other with firebombs, guns and hockey sticks on three
campuses, and at least 30 people were wounded, police said Monday.
   Students in Debendra College near Dhaka burned and damaged about
a dozen dormitory rooms Sunday, injuring 19 residents, police said.
Clashes also took place Sunday at Mohan Chand College and
Government College in Sylhet, 120 miles northeast of Dhaka, police
said.
   Sangbad, a Bengali-language newspaper, said 11 students were
injured in Sylhet.
   All three schools were closed until further notice.
   The fights were between supporters of the Awami League and the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, officials said. Both parties oppose
the government of President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, but their
followers often clash with each other.
   Sangbad said the fighting began when the groups started
simultaneous marches and wanted to hold meetings at the same site.

<TEXT>
   Any celebration marking the 106th birthday
of the world's oldest living twins will be subdued Saturday because
both are ill, one in critical condition at their nursing home.
   Allie Hill and Maggie Lambeth, born Jan. 13, 1884, are at
Mountain Vista Health Park, which for three years has held rousing
birthday parties for the women.
   Earlier parties attracted political bigwigs, friends and many of
the 192 direct descendants of the identical twins.
   ``There'll not be a big celebration because of their medical
condition,'' nursing home Administrator Kathy McDonald said last
week. ``Let's face it, this is a miracle almost _ at 106 their
condition has been better than you can expect.''
   The sisters' longevity is documented in the 1990 Guinness Book
of World Records, which says the chance of identical twins both
reaching the age of 100 is said to be one in 50 million. One set of
twins, Eli and John Phipps, born in 1803, both reached the age of
108, Guinness says.
   Mrs. Hill, who is in critical but stable condition, has been ill
since Dec. 20, when she suffered what may have been a stroke,
according to family members. Her sister is confined to her room a
few doors down the hall.
   ``Things are not quite as well as they were last year. Since
she's been sick, I think all of her grandchildren have been here to
visit,'' said Mrs. Hill's daughter, Bertha Hoover of Gastonia.
   Mrs. Lambeth's daughter, Minnie Anderson of Asheboro, said her
mother has not been well for most of the past year, and a nurse
attributed her poor health mostly to her age.
   ``She's doing pretty good, as well as could be expected for her
age,'' Mrs. Anderson said. ``They've lived longer than most people
I know. I've enjoyed it.''
   However, Mrs. Anderson, 76, said she does not wish to duplicate
her mother's long life. ``I don't want to live that long. But I'll
have to live as long as the good Lord lets me,'' she said.
   The twins have had more than three parties during three years of
celebrity that has attracted worldwide attention.
   In March 1987, two months after the pair were feted on their
103rd birthday, a Japanese television crew footed the bill to stage
a re-enactment of the occasion for airing on an Oriental version of
``That's Incredible.''
   The sisters have received birthday greetings from Presidents
Reagan and Bush. Last year, more than 500 birthday cards arrived.
   The twins were born to John and Jane Cody Grubb on a farm in
Cid, about 10 miles from here. They grew up, married and raised
families in the community of their birth. They lived no more than a
couple of miles apart all their lives.
   At 20, Allie married James M. Hill, who died in 1955. They had
11 children, nine of whom are living. During the past year, Rosa
Garner, 84, her oldest daughter, has become a fellow resident at
Mountain Vista.
   Mrs. Hill has 30 grandchildren, 59 great-grandchildren and 21
great-great grandchildren.
   Maggie married David Elzie Lambeth when she was 21. He died in
1971. They had nine children, of whom six are living. There are 18
grandchildren, 31 great-grandchildren and 13 great-great
grandchildren.
   The twins get plenty of company. ``Seven days a week they have
visitors,'' Ms. Buie said. ``I doubt they've missed a day in a
year.''

   Eleven people, including three
Atlantic City councilmen, pleaded innocent Monday to charges they
sold or bought influence in the casino resort.
   Among those entering pleas in what prosecutors have called a
``city for sale'' scandal were Council President Walter E.
Collette, 61, and Councilmen Gene Dorn, 47, and Arnold Orsatti Jr.,
46.
   None of the defendants said anything during arraignment.
Superior Court Judges Manuel Greenberg and Robert Neustadter told
the defendants and their attorneys not to discuss the case publicly.
   Greenberg said all defense motions must be filed by April 1.
   Edwin J. Jacobs Jr., attorney for Collette, said defense
attorneys need the time to examine the more than 300 tapes made of
the defendants by Albert Black, a state informant.
   The city officials were arrested along with Mayor James L. Usry
on July 27 in a sting operation that alleged widespread corruption
in City Hall. Usry and three others were named Jan. 3 in separate
indictments, and their arraignments are scheduled later this month,
said Deputy Attorney General David Brody.
   Usry was charged with accepting $6,500 in bribes.
   Collette, Dorn, Orsatti and zoning board Chairman Kaleem
Shabazz, 52, are named with five other people on charges of
conspiring to use the City Council and zoning board to obtain money
and benefits as part of a racketeering enterprise.
   The probe began in late 1988 when Black, who manages a local
security agency, sought to refurbish a gas station and was
allegedly told he would have to make payoffs.

<TEXT>
   Romania's Roman Catholic bishops gathered
last week for the first time since 1948 to discuss ways of
rebuilding the church after 40 years of Communist suppression, an
Italian church official said Monday.
   Eleven bishops met Jan. 3-4 in Alba Julia to examine the new
prospects for the church following the fall of Nicolae Ceausescu's
hard-line regime, according to the director of the Italian Catholic
relief agency Caritas.
   Monsignor Giuseppe Pasini, who just returned from Romania, said
the meeting was attended by Archbishop Francesco Colasuonno, Pope
John Paul II's special envoy for Eastern Europe.
   Colasuonno met with the pope Monday, the Vatican said without
elaborating.
   Pasini said there are ``well-founded hopes'' the Vatican and
Romania can re-establish diplomatic relations, which were broken in
1950 when the papal nuncio was expelled from Bucharest.
   He said the Romanian bishops agreed on the need to re-establish
religious congregations, form a national bishops' conference and
obtain full freedom to exercise their pastoral duties.
   Pasini said there are an estimated 2.3 million Catholics in
Romania _ about 10 percent of the population. They include 1.45
million Latin rite Catholics, of whom 1 million are from the
Hungarian minority and 150,000 are German-speaking.
   But Pasini said those most urgently in need of help are the
pastors and followers of the Eastern or Byzantine rite Catholic
church, which was suppressed in 1948 and forcibly incorporated into
the Orthodox church.
   Their 1,800 churches were confiscated and bishops and priests
who refused to accept the merger were jailed, Pasini said. The
number of Eastern rite Catholics totaled 1.8 million in 1948, but
today's figure is not known because the faithful have been living
an underground existence, he said.
   Five Eastern rite bishops attended last week's meeting.
   ``The most shocking thing that came out of the meeting is the
state of poverty and abandon in which the Eastern rite Catholics
live,'' Pasini said.
   Last week, the new Romanian leadership abolished two 40-year-old
decrees that suppressed the Byzantine rite church.
   Pasini said the Latin Rite church also suffered under
Ceausescu's regime, with religious freedom severely restricted,
dioceses reduced from six to two, ordination of priests limited to
six a year and homes of clergy bugged by the secret police.

   A man convicted of killing his wife and
disposing of her body by using a wood chipper was sentenced today
to 50 years in prison.
   Richard Crafts, a former airline pilot, was sentenced after
Superior Court Judge Martin L. Nigro rejected a defense motion for
a new trial.
   Crafts told the judge that he had been wrongly portrayed as a
cold-blooded killer, but didn't address the issue of whether he had
killed his wife.
   ``A great deal has been said about my apparent lack of emotion _
`He has ice water in his veins,''' Crafts said during brief remarks
before he was sentenced. ``I have feelings like everyone else.''
   Crafts, 52, was convicted of killing 39-year-old Helle Crafts, a
Danish-born flight attendant, on Nov. 18 or 19, 1986, at their
Newtown home. Prosecutors said he cut the body with a chain saw and
fed parts through a wood chipper on a bridge between Newtown and
Southbury. He could have been sentenced to 25 years to life in
prison for his murder conviction.
   Craft's sister, Karen Rodgers, who has custody of the couple's
three young children, urged Nigro to impose the maximum sentence.
   ``I am concerned that Mr. Crafts has not publicly nor privately
demonstrated any remorse for the murder of his wife,'' Rodgers
said. ``I believe he has paid lip service only to the concerns of
his children.''
   The judge rejected a defense motion to set aside the conviction
and order a new trial, saying there was no evidence that the case
had been tainted by tape recording by state police.
   The Hartford Courant reported in November that Connecticut State
Police routinely tape-recorded telephone conversations at state
police barracks, including calls between suspects and lawyers. The
newspaper based its report on disclosures made during an unrelated
trial.
   Recording calls between lawyers and clients is forbidden under
federal law.
   Farver said he had no direct evidence that state police
illegally taped any telephone conversations with Crafts, and
acknowledged such an argument traditionally would be raised after
sentencing.
   But he said he wanted to formally raise the issue before
sentencing, and would reintroduce the argument on appeal.
   Police found body parts, including a fingernail and human
tissue, on the banks of the Housatonic River. The prosecution's
case also hinged on the testimony of witnesses who said they saw a
man with a wood chipper on the bridge Nov. 20.
   Crafts has been held at the Bridgeport Community Correctional
Center.

<HEAD>Internal Government Debate Over U.S. Naval Presence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An argument apparently has begun in the
government over increased U.S. naval activity in the Caribbean
against drug traffickers, which President Virgilio Barco is said to
favor.
   The United States has said it is increasing air and sea patrols
in international waters, and protests came Monday from the
opposition Conservatives and leftist Patriotic Union Party in
Colombia.
   Protests were expected because Barco's 5-month-old confrontation
with the Colombian cocaine barons, seen as courageous in other
countries, has received relatively little support at home.
   Confusion over Colombia's position on the U.S. action resulted
from a statement Sunday by Foreign Minister Julio Londono Paredes
that the government rejects any attempt to search Colombian ships.
   Some international news reports, based on Londono's comments,
interpreted that to mean Barco was angry with the United States.
   La Prensa, a Bogota daily with access to presidential advisers,
said Monday the problem appears to be within the Colombian
government and stems from a dispute between Barco and his foreign
minister.
   Barco has said nothing so far and his office has issued no
statements.
   A diplomat with the U.S. Embassy told The Associated Press on
Monday that Barco had not sent a protest note or objected in any
other way, officially or unofficially, to the increase of Caribbean
patrols. The official asked to remain anonymous so he would not
become a target of the cocaine gangs.
   According to La Prensa, the president accepts the U.S. action
and Londono never has been pro-American on an international issue.
   The falling out began with the U.S. invasion of Panama, La
Prensa said. It suggested Barco supported the invasion and his
foreign minister was opposed.
   Juan Carlos Pastrana, son of former President Misael Pastrana,
owns La Prensa. The paper has been aggressive in reporting attempts
by lawyers for the drug lords to negotiate a truce in the war on
traffickers that began in August.
   Londono arrived home from a vacation Sunday, and said in
response to reporters' questions at the airport: ``The Colombian
government does not accept, nor will it ever accept, any type of
interference with ships carrying the Colombian flag on the high
seas.
   ``Any type of interference on the high seas would need the
authorization of the Colombian government, especially of the
Ministry of Defense.''
   When Barco's office was asked if that was the official Colombian
position and whether Barco was upset about not being told in
advance that a U.S. task force would sail into the Caribbean,
spokesman Julio Carlos Gonzalez said Barco had no official comment.
   Londono said: ``It just isn't possible to suppose that a country
like the United States, which has the most sophisticated methods
available for intercepting and controlling ships and planes
entering its own territory, should have to go into international
waters to carry out what it should be doing in its own territory.''
   U.S. efforts to intercept drugs in its own territory obviously
have failed, he said.
   Adding to the confusion about Colombia's official positiion was
a report Sunday by the Bogota daily El Tiempo that Barco's office
issued a statement saying Colombia would not contribute warships to
the U.S. effort in the Caribbean.
   Gonzalez, the Barco spokesman, said the El Tiempo story was not
based on any Barco statement because none had been issued.
   A U.S. Embassy statement last week said the Navy patrols were
merely an exercise in increased vigilance, not a new policy, and
would take place in international waters.
   If Colombia does not join the patrols, one reason might be lack
of equipment and manpower. Its navy has three corvettes, which are
smaller than destroyers; a submarine that is under repair, and a
variety of patrol boats.
   The Colombian navy's main tasks are fighting drug traffickers
and five leftist guerrilla groups, which means patrolling thousands
of miles of Pacific and Caribbean coastline. It has intercepted
several boats that were smuggling guns to guerrillas.

<HEAD>Justices Will Consider Governors' Powers over National Guard Units</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court, reviving a controversy from
the 1988 presidential campaign, said Monday it will referee a
dispute over a governor's power to withhold National Guard troops
from peacetime training in Central America.
   The justices agreed to hear an appeal by Minnesota officials
contesting the federal government's authority to override a
governor's objection and send members of a state's National Guard
on foreign training missions.
   The court, which last April rejected a similar appeal by
Massachusetts officials, is expected to announce a ruling in the
Minnesota case by July.
   The matter became an issue in the 1988 presidential campaign
when Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts
governor, denounced the Reagan administration for what he called a
``failed and illegal'' policy of supporting the Nicaraguan Contra
rebels. He said sending National Guard troops to the region was an
attempt to intimidate Nicaragua.
   The Justice Department described Dukakis' position as ``a dagger
aimed at the heart of national defense.''
   By contrast, Gov. Rudy Perpich of Minnesota has said he
considers the issue one of states' rights and has not been critical
of Reagan or Bush administration foreign policy. Perpich joined
other Minnesota officials in appealing to the Supreme Court in
Monday's case.
   Twelve members of a Minnesota National Guard public relations
unit were in Panama on a training mission last month when U.S.
forces invaded there. The Minnesota residents returned to the
United States a day after the invasion began Dec. 20.
   Perpich did not try to prevent the troops from training in
Panama.
   ``Now that the Supreme Court has decided to hear it, ... we've
got a good legal footing for that appeal,'' he said Monday.
   The focus of the controversy is a 1986 federal law known as the
Montgomery Amendment, which limits the power of governors to
withhold their consent to federal deployment of National Guard
units.
   The amendment was enacted after several governors said they
opposed the Reagan administration's Central American policy and did
not want National Guard troops from their states assigned to
training missions in that region.
   The amendment prohibits any governor from withholding consent to
a National Guard unit's active duty outside the country because of
an objection to the location, purpose or schedule of the duty.
   There has been dual control over the National Guard since
Congress made it a component of the Army in 1933.
   Anyone joining the National Guard enrolls simultaneously in a
state militia organization and a reserve component of the national
armed forces.
   The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in June that the
Montgomery Amendment is constitutional and rejected arguments by
Minnesota officials.
   The appeals court said the federal government's authority to
provide for national defense is primary, and the states' power to
organize militias ``cannot constrain Congress' authority to train
the guard as it sees fit.''
   The Bush administration said Minnesota's position is
contradictory. Justice Department lawyers said that under the
state's view Congress could require National Guard troops ``to
fight a war abroad ... but would lack the authority to prepare and
train them abroad for such an eventuality.''
   According to figures quoted by the 8th Circuit court, the Army
National Guard provides 46 percent of the Army's combat units and
28 percent of its support forces.
   The Air National Guard provides a substantial portion of the
nation's air defenses, including 73 percent of interceptor forces,
25 percent of tactical fighters and 24 percent of tactical air
support.

   Hundreds of radical students burned
effigies of the U.S. ambassador and President Roh Tae-woo on Monday
in the southern city of Kwangju to protest the envoy's visit,
reports said.
   A separate group of 100 protesters threw human excrement and
tear gas powder near a police station several hundred yards from
the U.S. Cultural Center residence that U.S. Ambassador Donald
Gregg visited, the news reports said.
   Gregg, who apparently did not see the protests, was the first
U.S. ambassador to visit the city since a 1980 civil uprising in
which 200 civilians died and 1,500 were wounded.
   Many Kwangju citizens believe Washington condoned the
mobilization of the Korean military to put down unrest and silence
government dissent. Washington has denied the allegations.
   About 500 radical students yelling anti-American slogans battled
900 riot police with firebombs and rocks at Kwangju's Chosun
University, said Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Fierce fighting continued for an hour inside the campus after
riot troopers moved in to break up a rally, Yonhap and newspapers
reported. The troopers were supported by two armored fans firing
tear gas, the reports said. No injuries or arrests were reported.
   ``Gregg came here under a scheme with Roh Tae-woo trying to
unilaterally shelve the Kwangju issue,'' Yonhap quoted a student
leader at the rally as saying.
   Police have been on alert since the ambassador arrived Sunday
for a three-day visit. Korean news reports said he was protected by
plainclothes officers.
   The Hankook Ilbo, a Seoul daily, said police advised against
Gregg's visit, but U.S. officials said an explanation of
Washington's role in Kwangju should be resolved through dialogue.
   ``I came here not to make an apology but to express regret and
condolences to Kwangju citizens,'' Gregg said Monday, according to
news reports. He also denied any U.S. involvment in putting down
the uprising.
   Gregg said the United States urged the South Korean government
in 1980 to settle the protests in Kwangju peacefully, ``but our
influence was not enough over the South Korean government,'' Yonhap
said.
   Anti-American sentiment is strong, and the U.S. Cultural Center
in Kwangju was attacked 28 times before it was closed last year to
protect the staff. Gregg has said he hopes it will reopen soon.
   Three dissident groups issued statements opposing his visit. The
ambassador invited dissidents and leading citizens to a dinner to
explain the U.S. position on Kwangju, but Yonhap said many stayed
away in protest.
   ``We rejected his invitation because the truth about Kwangju and
the possible U.S. role have not been clarified,'' said Chun
Kye-ryang, a leading dissident and relative of a victim of the
uprising.
   Last week, the U.S. Embassy issued a statement rejecting former
President Chun Doo-hwan's reference to an alleged U.S. role in the
Kwangju incident.
   Chun said in parliamentary testimony Dec. 31 that he, then an
army general, decided on the military suppression of the uprising
after receiving information from the United States that the
military threat from Communist North Korea was increasing.
   The U.S. Embassy said the United States did not see any evidence
of heightened threats from North Korea at the time.
   Gregg, a former CIA station chief in Seoul, has been the target
of protests since he was appointed ambassador last year. On Oct.
13, six radical students broke into his residence and hurled
homemade bombs at police before being overpowered. Gregg and his
wife, Meg, were unhurt.

   A contingent of 82nd Airborne Division
troops arrived home today to shouts of joy and hugs of relatives,
but the bulk of paratroopers from here remained in Panama.
   Four transport planes that carried the 700 men home began
arriving before noon at Pope Air Force Base, which is adjacent to
the sprawling Fort Bragg post. After the last one landed, troops
formed as a battalion on the tarmac before being dismissed to greet
the approximately 1,000 relatives and friends on hand.
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of Panamanians that will be
forever grateful to you for bringing them freedom _ for the rest of
their lives _ for bringing them peace and bringing them
prosperity,'' Gen. Edwin H. Burba Jr. of Command Forces in Atlanta
told the soldiers.
   One soldier was coming home to the son he's never seen. Kristi
Harris waited for her husband, Spec. 4 Carlie Harris, carrying
4-day-old Carlie Jr. Their 7-year-old son, Patrick, also was there.
   She said no special celebration was planned for the missed
Christmas holiday because her husband's homecoming ``is probably
Christmas enough.''
   The 3rd Battalion soldiers were among about 4,000 from Fort
Bragg sent to Panama as part of the Dec. 20 invasion that toppled
ruling Gen. Manuel Noriega. About 26,000 U.S. soldiers
participated, and some already returned to other U.S. bases.
   ``I'm glad they finally took care of the situation'' in Panama,
said another woman awaiting her soldier husband, Marie Ballou.
``It's been a long time coming.''
   The unit that returned today was the 3rd Battalion of the 504th
Parachute Infantry Regiment.
   Post officials said they did not know when other Fort Bragg
troops would return.
   The 3rd battalion was involved in seizing Madden Dam, a major
source of electrical power for U.S. installations in the area, and
Cerro Tigre, which was believed to be the main supply depot for
Noriega's troops, Army officials said.
   No soldiers from the battalion were killed, but 23 were wounded,
officials said.
   On Sunday, about more than 600 Army Rangers of the 3rd
Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment returned from Panama to Fort
Benning in Columbus, Ga.
   ``It's great to be home,'' Pfc. Daniel Becker said, after being
reunited with his girlfriend.

   Drug problems worsened last year in more than
half the nation's cities, making the issue the top worry of urban
leaders, a survey of elected officials said Monday.
   Fewer than one city in 10 reported making any headway locally in
the war on drugs, according to the survey by the National League of
Cities.
   ``There's been a lot of talk about drugs coming out of
Washington, and our city leaders are now sending back a message _ a
message that it's time for Washington to get a front-line report on
what's happening and what's needed,'' said Alan Beals, executive
director of the league.
   ``The drug issue must be a national priority, local officials
are saying, because they cannot beat it on their own,'' he said.
   The league surveyed elected municipal officials _ mayors and
council members _ from 314 cities selected randomly from the 2,461
cities with a population of 10,000 or more.
   Officials in 58 percent of cities surveyed said drug problems
had worsened in their communities over the past year. Another 31
percent said the magnitude of the drug problem remained the same,
and 9 percent reported progress.
   Drugs led the list of top concerns of city officials. One in
five said that if they could meet with President Bush on any topic,
they would focus on drugs.
   ``Clearly our local leaders believe there is a need for national
leadership and a stronger commitment of national resources to help
eradicate the poisonous and violent drug culture that has invaded
our cities,'' Beals said.
   On other topics, 39 percent said their cities would have to
raise local taxes this year. Nearly half said they would increase
various user fees, and almost two-thirds said their city's spending
will increase.
   Beals, at a news conference releasing the study, said cities
leaders are ``making the tough choices on their own,'' by raising
taxes _ without waiting for the federal government to provide more
help. He decried a ``fend for yourself national approach'' of the
last decade, with the federal government withdrawing aid to cities.
   The league survey was conducted by telephone in November and
early December by the Center for Urban Studies at Wayne State
University in Detroit. Beals said it was a scientific sample, and
it carried a stated margin of error of plus or minus 5.5 percentage
points.
   Beals said there was discontent among urban leaders with the
federal government's allocation of money to fight drugs. The $2.2
billion in federal drug assistance goes to the states, he said,
``but it's needed in our cities where the war against drugs is
being fought.''
   He said the survey found nearly half, 47 percent, described
relations with their state government as ``fair'' at best, 22
percent said they were ``poor,'' and 28 percent said ``good.''
   Other top concerns cited by the city officials as needing
presidential attention were financial constraints and the lack of
federal aid to go with federally required local programs, solid
waste and other environmental problems, education and affordable
housing.
   Besides drugs, city leaders reported worsening conditions
involving the cost of living, affordability of housing, energy
costs, crime and solid waste.

   An American is choreographing a Chinese ballet in
one of the first such cultural exchanges since China's military
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement last June.
   Norman Walker, who teaches dance at Adelphi University in New
York and has choreographed more than 150 dances, said the romantic
score he had composed for the Central Ballet of China depicts a
``natural growth in human affairs.''
   Walker said the ballet, based on Chinese composer Liu Dunnan's
piano concerto ``The Mountain Forest,'' attempts movements
different from the rest of the Central Ballet's repertoire ``so as
to expand their potential.''
   The dance, he said, ``is classically based but uses the attack
and thrust as well as the movement ideas of contemporary dance.''
   Mary Yung Kantor, a sponsor of the project, said the ballet
would be ``the first cultural exchange like this'' since China's
suppression of the democracy movement soured relations with the
United States.
   ``Art is art. I'm not here for propaganda,'' said Mrs. Kantor,
president of the Simarka Trading Co., which has offices in New
York, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Chinese, she said, ``know I have no
ulterior motives.''
   Academic and sports exchanges have been revived slowly in recent
months, and at least one American opera troupe performed in China
last summer.
   The ballet, based on an exchange planned before June, will open
Jan. 18 in Beijing and will feature 11 couples from the national
troupe.
   The Central Ballet was founded in 1959, but during the
ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution of 1966-76 it was allowed to
perform only revolutionary works.
   It recent years it has gained an international reputation for
staging Western ballet classics and has toured the United States,
Britain and the Soviet Union.
   Walker, who has choreographed dances for the Joffrey Ballet,
Boston Ballet, Washington Ballet and Ballet Philippines, joins
well-known ballet figures such as Beryl Grey, Maria Fay and Rudolf
Nureyev who have worked with the company.

<HEAD>Lithuanians Plan Giant Independence Rally For Gorbachev Visit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanian activists say they are planning a big
welcome for Mikhail S. Gorbachev when he arrives in their restive
republic this week: a pro-independence rally they expect will draw
hundreds of thousands.
   Sajudis, the Lithuanian grassroots political movement, is
putting out the call on radio and TV for a giant demonstration upon
the Soviet president's arrival Wednesday in the republic's capital
of Vilnius, according to Longinas Vasiliauskas, a Sajudis spokesman.
   ``This demonstration is needed to show Gorbachev and the world
that the Lithuanian people has already made its choice for a free
and independent state,'' he said Sunday by telephone from Vilnius.
   Gorbachev reportedly is scheduled to spend three days in
Lithuania this week trying to heal the rift between the republic's
breakaway Communist Party and Moscow. On Dec. 20, a majority of
Lithuanian Communists voted to break ties with the national party,
a possible precursor to secession by the Baltic republic of 3.7
million people.
   Gorbachev criticized the move, saying the Communists were giving
in to ``separatists,'' but leaders of the breakaway party who met
with Gorbachev in Moscow last week said he also promised not to
interfere if they stuck with their decision.
   Vasiliauskas said Gorbachev's remarks about separatists prompted
Sajudis call for the rally.
   ``Sajudis intends for Gorbachev to see for himself that there is
no alternative for Lithuania besides independence,'' he said.
   Nationalist rallies in the more politically active of the Soviet
Union's 15 republics repeatedly have drawn hundreds of thousands.
An estimated 1 million residents of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
joined hands last summer to protest the 1939 Soviet-Nazi pact that
allotted the Baltic states to the Soviet sphere.
   The Sajudis announcement calls for Wednesday's demonstration to
be ``peaceful, dignified and disciplined,'' Vasiliauskas said.
``There will be a few hundred thousand there, that's for sure.''
   Gorbachev met Saturday in Moscow with loyal Communists from
Lithuania who oppose their party's bold break with the national
party, and an estimated 3,000 people back home rallied to support
them. The protesters at the central sports palace in Vilnius
adopted an appeal to Gorbachev asking him to condemn
``nationalistic and chauvinistic overtones'' in their republic and
to restore the unity of the Communist Party.
   There has been little word of what Gorbachev discussed with the
loyalists. The official news agency Tass said only that Gorbachev's
talks with them and earlier meeting with the pro-independence
faction featured ``an exchange of opinions on a way out of the
situation.''
   Lithuanian Communist Party leader Algirdas Brazauskas said the
meetings have ``helped the two sides understand each other
better,'' Radio Moscow reported Sunday.

   A homemade projectile fired from a car hit near the
home of Emperor Akihito's younger brother Monday and another
missile was found near the imperial garden in Kyoto, police said.
No injuries or damage were reported.
   Police suspected leftist radicals opposed to the monarchy for
the attacks, which took place at about the same time in Tokyo and
Kyoto.
   The attacks came the same day a commission was formed to plan
Akihito's formal coronation, and a day after the end of a one-year
mourning period for his father, Emperor Hirohito.
   Police officials in Tokyo said missiles were fired from a car
parked 650 feet from the western Tokyo residence of Prince Hitachi,
Akihito's younger brother.
   One projectile was found in a road and a fragment, possibly from
a second missile, was discovered in the yard of a private home near
Hitachi's home, said the officials on condition of anonymity. The
projectile contained no explosives, they said.
   Police said there were five launchers in the parked car's trunk.
Kyodo News Service said one exploded in the car, which went up in
flames. Police said they did not know if Hitachi, 54, third in line
to the throne after Akihito's two sons, was home at the time.
   Police said they were investigating who owned the car and
whether it had been stolen. Kyodo said the car had been stolen last
month.
   Kyodo quoted an unidentified woman living nearby as saying she
heard ``five or six booming sounds like fireworks going off. I felt
as though fragments of something were going to come flying toward
our house and was really scared.''
   In the western city of Kyoto, one homemade projectile was found
near the gate of the imperial garden, police said. Witnesses
reported hearing three explosions.
   On Sunday, vandals burned the door of a building at the tomb of
the legendary Emperor Kaika in the western town of Nara, police
said. A note nearby said, ``Nara Red Army. Anti-imperial and
anti-emperor,'' according to police.
   The radical groups oppose Japan's monarchy, despite public
opinion polls showing strong support for it.
   On Monday, the government inaugurated the Imperial Enthronement
Committee, led by Prime Minister Toshiku Kaifu, to plan the
November coronation.
   Although Akihito, 56, became emperor immediately after his
father died on Jan. 7, 1989, coronation plans were delayed by the
one-year mourning period.
   Hirohito died at age 87 after a 62-year reign, longest in
Japanese history.
   Some Japanese are opposed to government plans to spend $58
million on his son's coronation.
   In 1986, Japanese radicals fired homemade missiles at the state
guest house, the U.S. Embassy, the Imperial Palace, Akihito's home
and a police headquarters in Osaka before a summit meeting in Tokyo
of seven major industrialized democracies. One person was injured.
   A car was set afire by a time bomb, reportedly by leftist
radicals, in a parking lot of an Imperial Household Agency
dormitory on April 29, Hirohito's birthday.

   China has bought an additional 300,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat under a price subsidy program, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said five private exporting companies
made the deals under the department's Export Enhancement Program,
or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is schedfuled for May, he said.
   The sales were part of 1 million tons authorized for China under
EEP on Dec. 5. A previous allocation of 2 million tons made last
Feb. 27 had been exhausted, except for 10,000 tons.
   With the latest EEP approvals, China has 300,000 tons remaining
to be used under the current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 11 million bushels. At
current prices, estimated by USDA at $3.83 per bushel, the wheat
would have a farm value of around $42 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $15.45 per ton, or
about 42 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Bunge Corp., 85,000 tons;
Peavey Co., 80,000; Cargill Inc., 50,000; J. Aron &amp; Co., 45,000,
and Tradigrain Inc., 40,000.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 5.4 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year, which
began June 1, most of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, China
bought more than 8 million tons of U.S. wheat, all of it under the
EEP program.

<HEAD>Bush Declares `Time Is Past' for Congress to Cut Capital Gains Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush struck a combative stance
for the 1990 congressional session Monday, complaining ``it is past
time'' for lawmakers to approve a capital gains tax cut and other
White House proposals left hanging last year.
   Saying a capital gains bill would be a top priority, Bush
declared, ``I am sick and tired of the demagogues who call this a
tax cut for the rich. It means jobs, it means savings and it is
good for all Americans.''
   Many Democrats in Congress have opposed a reduction on grounds
the chief beneficiaries would be the wealthy.
   Bush spelled out his legislative hopes in a speech to 8,000
delegates to the annual convention of the American Farm Bureau, the
nation's largest farm organization with 3.8 million member families.
   He also called for action on anti-crime and clean-air
legislation, but the tax cut talk won the loudest applause from
farmers. Bush reminded his audience that lower tax rates would
apply to the sale of farmland.
   On a separate issue, Bush also won cheers by saying, ``I am
mighty proud'' of the American forces who were sent to Panama to
depose Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Noriega is being held in Miami on drug-trafficking charges, and
Bush said, ``The joy shown by the people of Panama says it all.''
   The capital gains legislation concerns taxes on profits derived
from the sale of stocks, real estate and other assets. Bush has
proposed lowering the top tax rate to 15 percent from the current
tops of 28 percent and 33 percent.
   A Bush-backed plan was defeated last year when Senate
Republicans could not muster the 60 votes necessary to break a
Democratic filibuster against it. But lawmakers on both sides of
the issue have expressed doubt that procedural devices could kill
the proposal this year.
   An aide to Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, who led the
opposition last year, said Monday the Maine Democrat ``supported a
capital gains (tax) reduction in 1986, and has said he will
continue to support one if it meets three criteria _ if it doesn't
adversely effect the budget deficit, if it is targeted, and if it
is part of a fair and progressive tax structure.''
   One of every four Democrats sided with Republicans when the
House voted for a capital gains cut last September. But even some
Democrats who are longtime supporters of lower capital-gains taxes
were unhappy with the bill because it would have provided a lower
tax rate for only 2\ years and then would have substituted a system
under which gains caused by inflation would be excluded from
taxation.
   Bush has not disclosed details of the cut he will propose in his
Jan. 29 budget message. However, congressional Republicans say they
expect him to call for a plan that would provide a greater tax
incentive the longer an asset is held. Thus, profits from the sale
of property owned for five years would be taxed less than would
gains from something owned two years.
   Present law taxes capital gains at the same rates as other
income.
   ``The fight isn't over yet,'' Bush said, contending that a
capital gains tax cut would ``help keep American agriculture
dynamic and prosperous.''
   More generally, Bush recalled that ``I put out my hand to the
Congress, to the Democratic majority'' in his inaugural address a
year ago and offered lawmakers proposals on crime, clean air and
the capital gains tax cut.
   ``Now a year has past. The new year is upon us and it's time, it
is past time for Congress to tend to some of the unfinished
business,'' Bush said.
   With Congress due back in session Jan. 23, Bush said, ``The hand
of cooperation is once again extended. And I would only add:
America wants it done right; America wants it done responsibly, and
America wants it done now.''
   After his speech, Bush toured futuristic exhibits of
high-technology agriculture at Walt Disney's EPCOT Center. He also
visited the ``living seas'' building and came face to face with
porpoises and scuba divers in a tank.
   The trip came at the start of a year in which Congress must
update the 1985 farm legislation that reduced basic crop price
supports, saving billions of dollars for taxpayers.
   Crop subsidies this year are expected to total about $11
billion, far below the record $26 billion in 1986.
   Providing only a hint about the farm bill he will propose, Bush
said, ``We must have market-oriented farm policies that allow
producers more flexibility to decide what crops to grow. ...
   ``At the same time, we've got to maintain a safety net to
protect farmers from conditions beyond their control,'' the
president said.
   Moreover, Bush said, ``We've got to expand markets and enhance
productivity. We've got to assure the public that America's food is
the safest in the world, and we've got to protect our precious
environment.''
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter has said he does not
expect massive changes in the 1985 law, but has acknowledged that
the 1990 rewrite must tackle the issues of environmental and food
safety.
   Bush said international markets for farmers are improving, with
U.S. agricultural exports increasing last year for the third year
in a row.
   ``We also support expanding our ties with Eastern Europe and the
Soviet Union to open even more markets,'' Bush said, noting that
Yeutter led a delegation to Poland to suggest ways it could shift
to a market economy.
   ``We're forging new partnerships between our agriculture
industries and Eastern Europe's emerging economies.''

   A cult leader wanted in the
slayings of an Ohio family of five was arrested near the Mexican
border by authorities who say weapons and survivalist gear were
found in his motel room and a storage locker.
   Jeffrey Lundgren, 39, a former Sunday-school teacher and tour
guide in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day
Saints in Ohio, was arrested outside the motel Sunday by federal
agents and county sheriffs.
   Lundgren's 38-year-old wife, Alice, and the couple's 19-year-old
son, Damon, also were arrested there. Three other Lundgren children
_ Kristen, 10, Caleb, 9, and Jason, 15 _ were taken into protective
custody, said Andrew Vita, the special agent in charge of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms office in Los Angeles.
   ``This will relieve a lot of apprehension,'' Kirtland, Ohio,
police officer Ronald K. Andolsek said late Sunday on the
Lundgrens' arrests. In recent days, Kirtland police had been
keeping close watch of the homes of residents who were once
threatened by Lundgren.
   John Hewicker, a San Diego County deputy district attorney who
handles extraditions, said today that the Lundgrens told
investigators they would refuse to waive extradition to Ohio, where
they face charges that include aggravated murder and kidnapping.
   The Lundgrens will be in state court on Tuesday for arraignment
on fugitive charges, Hewicker said. The extradition hearing would
come later, he said.
   Lundgren broke away from the Reorganized Church and persuaded
other members to follow him, officials said. The group once lived
on a 15-acre farm near the Cleveland-area town, where investigators
last week unearthed five bodies. Authorities believe the five are
Dennis Avery, his wife, Cheryl, and their three young daughters.
   Investigators believe the Averys were killed in mid-April and
buried in a common grave under the barn.
   Searches of the Southern California motel room and a nearby
storage area rented by Jeffrey Lundgren uncovered numerous weapons,
including an AR-15 assault rifle, as well as ammunition, knives and
gas masks, Vita said.
   ``They had camping gear, web gear that the military would wear _
things that can sustain you up in the mountains,'' he said.
   ``We're not sure where they were going,'' ATF agent James
Stathes said.
   Authorities had been watching the motel since Saturday night,
said George Rodriguez, a special agent for the ATF in Kansas City,
Mo.
   Lundgren and 12 of his followers were indicted by a Lake County,
Ohio, grand jury in the killings. Two followers _ Kathryn Renee
Johnson, 36, of Holden, Mo., and Daniel David Craft, 25, of Nauvoo,
Ill. _ remain at large.
   Authorities were led to the motel in National City, about five
miles south of San Diego, by telephone calls made from a pay phone
to another location under surveillance, said Steven C. LaTourette,
a Lake County prosecutor who held a news conference in Painesville,
Ohio.
   ``This case continues to develop. As a prosecutor, I've got to
tell you, it's a great case,'' LaTourette said.
   The prosecutor has said the Averys apparently were killed in a
cult sacrifice necessary under a prophecy of Lundgren's before the
cult could relocate.
   However, the president of the northeast Ohio chapter of the
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, Dale
Luffman, said he thought the slayings resulted from a dispute over
money, sex or fear the family would leave the cult.
   The church stripped Lundgren of his lay minister credentials in
1987 after he began preaching radical doctrines.
   Though the church has roots and some beliefs in common with the
Mormon Church, the two churches are separate.

<HEAD>Puerto Rico Native Will Run For Seat Of Convicted Congressman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state legislator who is a native of Puerto
Rico said Monday that he will run for the congressional seat
vacated last week by the resignation of convicted Rep. Robert
Garcia.
   Garcia was convicted on extortion and conspiracy charges in the
Wedtech military contracting scandal.
   State Assemblyman Jose Serrano said he'll officially declare his
candidacy ``as soon as the governor calls the (special) election.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo's press secretary, Gary Fryer, said the
governor would soon announce a special election, probably to be
held in late February, for the Garcia seat in the New York City
borough of the Bronx, one of the nation's poorest congressional
districts.
   Under the special election process, county leaders determine the
party candidates without primaries. Serrano is expected to have the
backing of George Friedman, the Bronx County Democratic chairman
and an Assembly colleague of Serrano's, and thus should get the
Democratic ballot spot.
   In that congressional district, as in many areas of heavily
Democratic New York City, gaining the party nomination is
tantamount to election.
   If elected, Serrano, 46, would be the only voting member of
Congress to be a native of Puerto Rico. He moved with his family to
the Bronx when he was 7.

<HEAD>Trial Opens in $8.7 Million Suit over Navy Jet Training Flights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former cattle rancher testified Monday that
Navy jets screaming as low as 100 feet above his central Nevada
land terrified his livestock, interfered in their breeding and
eventually put him out of business.
   Don Nonella testified at the opening of a federal court trial in
his $8.7 million lawsuit against the Navy, which operates the
Fallon Naval Air Station 60 miles west of the Nonellas' former
ranch.
   The government claims poor business practices and not noisy
fighters ruined Nonella's chances of success.
   Nonella testified that in May 1985 only 466 cows were
successfully bred instead of the 800 he had anticipated. He said
the animals' health and their feed were all acceptable.
   He said he was baffled until one day when he was moving some
cattle and a Navy jet roared over.
   ``I could see the pilot had glasses on, I was that close to
him,'' Nonella said. ``It occurred to me at that time it might be
the jet overflights.''
   Nonella, 58, and his wife, Barbara, 52, filed suit last year
over the daily training flights out of the naval air station, about
60 miles east of Reno.
   ``We put our life savings into the place and they put us out of
business,'' said Nonella, who nows lives in Elko and drives trucks.
``We couldn't operate out there because of the noise.''
   They are among dozens of residents who lived in the valleys
under the Navy's designated air space for flight training and who
have long complained that low-level jet flights shattered their
nerves and sometimes property.
   Congress appropriated $10.9 million to buy about 100 parcels in
Dixie Valley, 70 miles east of Fallon, where some 35 families lived.
   The Nonellas owned their 1,000-head ranch from 1979 through
1988, then abandoned it after they were unable to sell it.
   ``No one would buy the place and we couldn't make our payments
so we just deeded it back to the federal land bank,'' Don Nonella
said. ``We just left.''
   The non-jury trial is expected to last more than one week.

<HEAD>Redoubt Volcano Erupts Again; Sends Out Ash Cloud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Redoubt Volcano rumbled alive today,
spitting ash and steam at least five miles into the air, scientists
said.
   Redoubt produced a ``vigorous'' eruption at 10:20 a.m., said
Steve Brantley of the Alaska Volcano Observatory.
   Pilots reported ash up to at least 26,000 feet, he said. Winds
from the southwest were expected to carry the ash north and
northeast.
   The volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage rumbled awake Dec.
13 after a 25-year rest.
   Periodic eruptions since then have disrupted air traffic off and
on, including Saturday. But today's eruption did not immediately
result in new flight restrictions, the Federal Aviation
Administration said.
   Saturday's activity was ``clearly a minor event'' compared to
eruptions last month and even earlier last week, the observatory
said. Scientists said that during the day the volcano continued to
generate ``a vigorous plume'' of steam and volcanic gas to
altitudes of 12,000 to 15,000 feet.
   Volcanic ash is of concern to pilots because it can shut down
jet engines. A Boeing 747 operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines lost
power to all four engines after flying through Redoubt ash last
month. The engines were restarted and the plane made a safe
emergency landing in Anchorage.

<HEAD>Families of Kidnapped Swiss Workers Appeal for Their Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Family members of two young Swiss relief
workers visited Beirut on Monday and urged the kidnappers to set
their loved ones free.
   Elio Erriquez and Emmanuel Christen were orthopedic technicians
at an International Red Cross clinic in Sidon, 25 miles south of
Beirut, when they were kidnapped Oct. 6.
   ``I appeal to you to unlock the door and allow them to come
freely from Sidon to Beirut,'' Marianne Christen said. ``I would
like to tell my son how much we miss him and are looking forward to
seeing him back among us.''
   Erriquez's mother, Graziella, said: ``I appeal to their captors
to release them immediately because their seizure is harming
thousands of people in need of their assistance.''
   The Sidon orthopedic center was closed after the abductions.
   Mrs. Christen said the families visited Beirut ``to see the
place Elio and Emmanuel loved and lived in for the last two years
and to meet the people who are doing their best to ensure their
safe release.''
   Marie Erriquez, Elio's twin, said: ``If Elio and Emmanuel can
hear us, I want them to be courageous because they have lots of
friends here and in Switzerland who have shown their support
against this injustice.''
   Accompanying the families were Christophe Marnish and Angelo
Gnaedeinger of the International Red Cross in Geneva.
   During a news conference at the seaside Summerland Hotel in
Moslem west Beirut, the group displayed a petition for the men's
release that bore 70,000 signatures collected by Swiss newspapers
and a support committee for the hostages.
   Michel Dufour, head of the all-Swiss International Red Cross
office in Lebanon, said it had received more than 50,000 letters of
sympathy.
   Dufour said the families would take the letters home to ``show
Lebanese concern and consciousness toward our colleagues.''
   No group has claimed responsibility for kidnapping Christen, 32,
and Erriquez, 23.
   Sidon police and the Palestine Liberation Organization say they
are held by the Fatah Revolutionary Council terrorist group led by
Abu Nidal, but it denies responsibility.
   Christen and Erriquez are among 18 Westerners held hostage in
Lebanon, who include eight Americans. Held longest is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
abducted March 16, 1985.
   Most Western hostages are believed held by Shiite Moslem
kidnappers loyal to Iran.
   In an interview published Sunday in Tehran, Ali Akbar
Mohtashemi, the former Iranian foreign minister, said Iran does not
want relations with the United States, and the Lebanese have a
right to hold foreign hostages.
   The English-language Tehran Times quoted him as saying Iran
seeks diplomatic relations with all countries except the United
States, Israel and South Africa.
   ``Lebanese Sunnis, Shiites, Druse and Christians are the
hostages of the U.S., Israel and other Western powers, so it's
their natural right to take hostages to inflict heavy blows on
their enemies,'' Mohtashemi said.
   ``No negotiations, but force, is the answer to what the enemies
of the Lebanese have done against that deprived nation.''

   To get Dylan to appear at the club, which can hold only 700

sales, said Mike Spoerndle, president of Toad's. Tickets are to
cost $18.50.
   ``We were not looking to make money. We were interested in
having another legend,'' Spoerndle said.
   After Toad's landed the Stones to close out the 1980s, Dylan's
appearance ``is a great way to start the 1990s,'' said Katherine
Cormack, Toad's director of booking and promotion.

   Jerry Van Dyke, who turned down a role in
``Gilligan's Island'' in favor of ``My Mother, the Car,'' refuses
to be optimistic about the chances of his latest effort, ABC's
``Coach.''
   ``I've had terrible luck, just awful luck,'' said Van Dyke, who
got his start in television on his older brother's long-running
``The Dick Van Dyke Show.''
   ``I was offered `Gilligan's Island.' I said `This is the worst
thing I ever saw and I won't do it.' Look at it ... becomes a hit
... lasted three seasons,'' Van Dyke said in the Jan. 13 edition of
TV Guide Magazine.
   ``My Mother, the Car'' quickly stalled. The magazine didn't say
what role Van Dyke was offered in ``Gilligan's Island.''
   The younger Van Dyke's pessimism toward his new role as
assistant football Coach Luther Van Dam in the TV series, which
features Craig T. Nelson in the title role, is founded on more than
just one failure.
   After ``Car'' failed, ``Sheldon Leonard, who was the top
producer in TV (in the late 1960s) had one bomb in his life and it
was my show, `Accidental Family,''' Van Dyke said. Next came
``Headmaster,'' starring Andy Griffith in the title role, which
also bombed.

   A con man who says he's borrowing jewelry for
Joan Rivers has made off with thousands of dollars worth of
merchandise from at least two Manhattan stores, the syndicated
talk-show host said Monday.
   ``This is terribly sad,'' Rivers said in a news release. ``The
store owners are nice, honest people and this shouldn't have
happened to them.''
   The well-dressed man in his 30's said he was borrowing the
jewelry for Rivers to wear during a televised interview with arms
dealer Adnan Khashoggi, according to Jennifer Geertz, a spokeswoman
for Rivers.
   The con man left two phone numbers with the stores, one at CBS
and another that reaches a recorded message at offices of ``The

   ``He was a real pro,'' Irene Kojen of the Peipers &amp; Kojen store
told New York magazine. ``He was so smooth that when he asked for
one ring, I lent him two, so Joan would have a choice.''

<TEXT>
   Ben, one of the Kodiak bears who starred in
the ``Grizzly Adams'' television series in the late 1970s, has died
during hibernation of chronic heart disease, zoo officials said
Monday.
   The best-known resident of the Folsom Children's Zoo apparently
died last week in his hibernation den. Zoo Director John Chapo said
Monday that Ben apparently had been dead for several days when he
was found by a zookeeper.
   Ben, believed to be about 15 years old, lived at the zoo for 10
years. The Kodiak bear, a subspecies of the brown bear, has a life
span of about 35 years.
   The bear's grumpy personality eventually made him unsuitable for
movies and television work and his owners found a home for him in
Lincoln.
   Kodiak bears are among the largest carnivores in North America.
Ben was about 8 feet tall and weighed 800 to 1,000 pounds at death.
He was somewhat smaller than the largest kodiaks, which can stand
11 to 12 feet tall and weigh 1,600 pounds.
   Ben usually would arouse from his hibernation on pleasant days
and eat, Chapo said, but Saturday the zookeeper could not rouse him.
   Tests showed he died of chronic heart disease, Chapo said. The
condition could have been present from birth or might have
developed later. It had gone undetected because physical exams of
such large animals are difficult and infrequent.
   ``He'd always been healthy, acted fine,'' Chapo said. ``There
was no reason'' to put him under anesthesia to examine him, which
could be dangerous to such a big animal.

   An upbeat Winnie Mandela met her
jailed husband, Nelson Mandela, on Monday for talks about his
widely expected release, which she believes will be within weeks.
   Mrs. Mandela, who visited her husband for three hours, has never
emerged from a visit so optimistic about prospects of freedom for
Mandela, who has been jailed almost 28 years.
   ``This is the first time I have accepted as a reality that he
will be released this year,'' Mrs. Mandela said. ``This is the real
thing.''
   As recently as two weeks ago, Mrs. Mandela was playing down
speculation that her husband would be freed early in 1990.
   She said Monday that no release date had been given to her or
her husband. Asked whether it would be weeks or months from now,
however, she replied: ``I don't think we are talking about months.''
   Since taking office in August, President F.W. de Klerk has freed
several of Mandela's colleagues from the outlawed African National
Congress guerrilla movement and has indicated Mandela's release
will follow.
   A broad range of black leaders have said they cannot accept de
Klerk's invitation to negotiate a new constitution until Mandela is
freed.
   There is strong speculation de Klerk will make a statement about
Mandela's status when he opens Parliament on Feb. 1.
   The ANC, in a statement from its exile headquarters in Lusaka,
Zambia, acknowledged the de Klerk government was moving to
dismantle apartheid but said it was premature to begin negotiations.
   ``We are committed to seize any real opportunity that might
emerge genuinely to seek a political agreement for the speedy end
of the apartheid system,'' Alfred Nzo, the ANC's secretary-general
said in a statement marking the group's 78th anniversary.
   However, he added: ``The armed struggle continues to be a
critical and decisive component part of our strategy.''
   Mrs. Mandela met with her husband in a former staff residence at
Victor Verster Prison Farm in the wine-growing town of Paarl, near
Cape Town.
   She emerged in the company of lawyer Omar Dullah, who said:
``Mrs. Mandela was requested by Mr. Mandela to make the visit
because he wanted to discuss with her some preliminary arrangements
relating to his release, in view of the general expectation that
his release will be sooner rather than later.''
   Mrs. Mandela declined to elaborate on the meeting.
   ``Suffice it to say it is the first time we have discussed the
preliminary arrangements of what will happen after release,'' she
said.
   Asked how she felt, she replied with a broad smile: ``I think it
is clear from my expression.''
   Mandela, 71, is South Africa's best-known black leader. There is
widespread belief he could be elected president if the black
majority had full voting rights.
   He has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for
plotting a sabotage campaign to undermine the white-run government.
   Mandela has received a steady stream of visitors in recent
weeks, ranging from Cabinet ministers to prominent anti-apartheid
leaders. He met Dec. 13 with de Klerk at the presidential office.
   The country remains under a 43-month-old state of emergency and
the ANC is officially banned. De Klerk has hinted, however, that he
may lift some emergency restrictions, and the recently released ANC
leaders leaders have campaigned openly on behalf of their
organization.
   They also have been granted passports and are expected to travel
next week to ANC headquarters in Zambia.
   In London, Anglican Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, a veteran
anti-apartheid campaigner, on Monday launched the ``Nelson Mandela
International Reception Committee'' aimed at organizing
celebrations when the black leader is released.
   A statement by the committee urged towns and universities around
the world that have honored Mandela to arrange events.

   Relatives of Charles Stuart who might have
suspected he was involved in his wife's killing had no legal
obligation under state law to report that to police, legal experts
say.
   In Massachusetts, ``persons are criminally culpable for what
they do, for their acts, not for what they know,'' said Frank
Chubert, a professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University
in Boston.
   The issue was raised last week when Stuart's youngest brother,
Matthew, implicated him in his pregnant wife's shooting death Oct.
23. Matthew Stuart told police he disposed of a gun and her purse
at his brother's request.
   Charles Stuart, apparently aware he had become a suspect,
committed suicide Thursday as police sought to arrest him. He had
told police that a mugger shot him and his wife during a robbery
after they left a hospital childbirth class.
   Matthew Stuart reportedly told others of his suspicions.
   Legal experts say that although some people might have known the
truth all along, they cannot be held criminally liable under
Massachusetts law for withholding information.
   ``There is no obligation,'' said John Dawley, who was Charles
Stuart's attorney. ``But morally and ethically, there are different
standards.''
   About a dozen states, but not Massachusetts, have ``good
Samaritan'' laws that require people to tell authorities if they
know a crime has been committed, said Charles Ogletree, a professor
at Harvard Law School. But he said the law is rarely enforced.
   ``It's hard to persuade a jury to convict someone who said, `I
saw a crime and I was scared to report it,''' Ogletree said in an
interview Friday.
   Also, if such laws were strictly enforced, they could have
painful implications, Chubert said.
   ``Just think of where that goes,'' he said. ``Does that mean mom
and dad get prosecuted for failure to report? You could use the
power to lock up a person's family.''
   Massachusetts also grants immunity for close relatives who
become an accessory to a crime after the criminal act has been
committed, Ogletree said. Typically, he said, immunity would be
granted to a relative who hides a fugitive.
   But in the case of Matthew Stuart, the issue of legal protection
might be more complicated, experts said.
   His attorney said Matthew Stuart, at his brother's instruction,
met him the night of the shooting and took a bag containing a gun
and Mrs. Stuart's purse.
   An important part of his story is that he wasn't aware Mrs.
Stuart was shot when he retrieved the items. If in fact he knew
that the crime was being committed, then he might be crossing the
line into aiding the crime, in which he would not have the
immunity, Ogletree said.
   ``He's on thin ice,'' said Joseph Balliro, a criminal lawyer in
Boston. ``That's going to be up to a grand jury to decide if they
believe him or not believe him.''
   Furthermore, experts said, the disposal of a gun can be
considered a separate crime, such as obstruction of justice.
   ``If he goes out and hides the evidence of a crime, then that's
a no-no,'' Balliro said Friday.
   John Julian, a spokesman for the Suffolk County district
attorney's office, said Friday he could not comment on whether
Stuart might be charged or receive immunity. ``There is an ongoing
grand jury investigation,'' he said.

   Higher prices are cropping up in
Florida restaurants, especially those offering vegetarian fare, in
the wake of the Christmas freeze that wiped out much of the state's
winter farms.
   A few restaurant owners say they've had to raise prices just to
break even.
   ``I'm a vegetarian restaurant, so I'm feeling more than a
pinch,'' said James McKenna, owner of the Ciao Sidewalk Cafe in
Delray Beach, 20 miles north.
   McKenna said a few weeks ago he was buying tomatoes for $8.50 a
case, but now he is paying $23. As a result, he raised the price of
the meal-sized salads at his cafe by 25 cents Thursday.
   The Taurus Steak House in Miami's Coconut Grove section has been
adding a $1.75 surcharge for their salad bar since the day after
Christmas because fo the higher vegetable prices, said Dave Hill
Jr., the restaurant's manager.
   At Ruby Tuesday chain restaurants, the prices have not changed,
but some days they've left cherry tomatoes and green peppers off
salads.
   ``We have not increased our prices, but we've had to delete a
few items,'' said Craig Marcy, a senior assistant at Ruby Tuesday
in Fort Lauderdale's Broward Mall.
   Most big restaurant chains are bearing the cost without changes.
   ``We're just absorbing the extra cost,'' said Cheri Grey of the
Steak &amp; Ale regional headquarters in Tampa. ``This is just short
term.''
   Prices fluctuate in any market and effect the restaurant
industry, said Frank Pike, chairman of the board of the Palm Beach
County Chapter of the Florida Restaurant Association.
   ``This happens in a multitude of categories _ beef, stone
crabs,'' Pike said. ``They can't change their prices every time the
market fluctuates.''
   Pike said it is too early to assess the impact of increased
vegetable costs on the restaurant industry as a whole.

<HEAD>British Moslems Begin Vigil at Rushdie's Publishers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moslems picketed Monday outside the publishers of
the novel ``The Satanic Verses,'' but organizers of the protest
tried to distance themselves from the death threat against author
Salman Rushdie.
   At a news conference to announce the five-day vigil, Mugharam
Al-Ghamdi, chairman of the U.K. Action Committee on Islamic
Affairs, said the demonstration is a reminder that the Moslem
outrage over the novel, which started with its publication in
September 1988, would not subside.
   Picketers outside Viking Penguin Books handed out leaflets and
carried signs proclaiming ``No Rushdie Porn,'' ``Hypocrisy in High
Places,'' and ``Put Honor Back on the Agenda.''
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
associating the prophet Mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting
the Koran, Islam's holy book, was not the work of God. On Feb. 14,
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued a religious edict
calling on Moslems to kill Rushdie.
   Khomeini's action drove Rushdie into hiding, and two Iranian
clerics offered a bounty of $5.2 million for Indian-born writer's
death. Iranian leaders have not rescinded the threat after
Khomeini's death June 3.
   ``Since the sensationalism has receded, what remains is a
genuine and permanent bitterness in the hearts and minds of
ordinary Moslems,'' Al-Ghamdi said.
   Although he warned that the bitterness would increase if the
book were not withdrawn, he and the U.K. Action Committee did not
support the death threat.
   ``We appeal all the time to Moslems in Britain to keep within
the limits of the law,'' said Iqbal Saraceni, a committee leader.
``We will not condone any overstepping of the law.''
   The committee, however, refused to condemn the death threat.
   Threats also have been made to Penguin. A police officer is on
24-hour duty outside and three security guards now watch over the
entrance hall, which is equipped with a metal detector.
   Viking Penguin spokesman Bob Gregory said there was no
connection between the vigil and publication of a paperback edition
of ``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``There is no date set for publication of the paperback,''
Gregory said. ``From that you cannot assume that a paperback
version will be published or will not be published.''
   Al-Ghamdi said Britain's 1.5 million Moslems want ``The Satanic
Verses'' withdrawn from publication and Britain's blasphemy laws
changed to incorporate other religions besides Christianity.
   Moslem communities from across Britain are taking turns
picketing the west London offices during the protest.
   On Monday, Moslems from Bradford, 180 miles northwest of London,
were on duty.
   ``We've seen a mixture of some people who are sympathetic and
some people who disagree,'' said Liaqat Hussain, the general
secretary of the Bradford Council for Moslems.
   The protesters handed out leaflets demanding withdrawal of the
book, a change in the blasphemy laws and for ``the moral support
and goodwill of all our fellow citizens to further our just
demands.''

   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has
approved the drug clomipramine for the treatment of patients with
obsessive-compulsive disorder.
   The FDA determined that clomipramine is a new kind of drug that
represents an advance in the treatment of the condition. Although
the drug is only now being approved for routine use, it has been
available for use in severe cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder,
or OCD. It is made by Ciba-Geigy Corp., and will be marketed under
the trade name Anafranil.
   ``Anafranil has proved to be effective in controlling OCD
symptoms in many patients,'' said Dr. Michael Jenike of
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
   The symptoms of the disorder include obsessive preoccupation
with dirt or contamination, and the fear among its sufferers that
they will act on violent thoughts. They develop such compulsions as
excessive cleaning, handwashing, counting, and checking.
   Another approved drug called fluoxetine, or Prozac, also appears
to be effective against obsessive-compulsive disorder, researchers
said.

   A gun was stolen from the fur store where Charles
Stuart once worked, adding another twist to the grisly murder hoax
that police now say was not so cunning after all.
   The latest clue came Monday with confirmation that a .38-caliber
revolver was stolen from the Edward F. Kakas &amp; Sons fur store where
Stuart worked as a manager, and the gun might have been the weapon
used to kill his pregnant wife and wound him.
   ``I believe what happened with Chuckie, this was the doing of a
sick mind,'' Pat Reardon, a cousin, said Monday.
   Stuart, 29, committed suicide last week after his brother
Matthew implicated him in the crime. Charles Stuart originally told
police that he and his wife were the victims of a mugger who forced
his way into their car Oct. 23 as they left a birthing class.
   Stuart's wife, Carol, died hours after the shooting, and their
premature baby, Christopher, died 17 days later.
   Matthew Stuart, 23, told authorities last week that he took Mrs.
Stuart's handbag, which contained the gun, from the scene and threw
the items separately into the Pines River in Revere. Divers have
recovered the handbag but not the gun.
   Jay Kakas, co-owner of the fur store, told police that a
revolver was stolen from the safe at the store, a representative of
the store, who asked not to be identified, confirmed Monday.
   Stuart also had access to the safe, the representative said, and
the Kakases thought to check the safe last week after police named
Stuart as the prime suspect.
   Investigators have refused to comment on the disappearance of
the gun.
   Other flaws also have emerged in what some officials said at
first looked like a near-perfect crime. Most notably, Matthew
Stuart was apparently not the only person to know of his brother's
involvement. He told his attorney that he told family members and
friends about the scheme.
   Matthew Stuart declined to comment on the case as he left the
family home Monday, telling reporters, ``I can't talk to you.''
   Another brother, Michael Stuart, was questioned Monday at the
Suffolk County district attorney's office. His lawyer, Richard
Clayman, said his client ``broke no laws.''
   Legal experts say the family members had no legal duty to
contact police about their suspicions.
   ``There is no obligation,'' John Dawley, who was Charles
Stuart's attorney, said last week. ``But morally and ethically,
there are different standards.''
   Police are investigating whether insurance was a motive behind
the crime. Stuart collected $82,000 on an insurance policy due his
wife for her work as an attorney, and a search of the couple's
Reading home has turned up another $100,000 policy on her,
according to various sources.
   Police reportedly also are investigating whether a romantic
relationship between Stuart and another woman might have been a
factor.
   News reports indicate a 22-year-old woman who worked for two
summers at the fur store repeatedly used Stuart's telephone calling
card number to call him while he was hospitalized after the October
shooting.
   Prosecutors have declined to say whether more charges might be
coming, saying a grand jury investigation is continuing, and that
they are still assembling information obtained from scores of
interviews since Stuart's death.
   The younger Stuart told authorities that he was not aware Mrs.
Stuart had been shot when he met his brother at the crime scene.
   Members of the black community, who have denounced what they say
was a racist investigation into the Stuart case, met informally
Monday to discuss a proposed civilian panel to evaluate police
misconduct.
   In his story to police, Stuart said the mugger was black, and
during the investigation scores of black residents were searched
and at least two black suspects were named.
   ``We have to ease the tensions and avert similar problems in the
future by establishing a civilian review board so black residents
feel they can take their complaints to a fair and impartial body of
citizens,'' said City Councilor Charles Yancey.
   Members of the Statehouse's black caucus have also said they
plan to send a letter to U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd requesting a
review of how the Stuart investigation was handled.

   Hundreds of paratroopers who took part
in the invasion of Panama returned home Monday to accolades from a
general who described their work as ``absolutely brilliant.''
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of Panamanians that will be
forever grateful to you for bringing them freedom _ for the rest of
their lives _ for bringing them peace and bringing them
prosperity,'' said Gen. Edwin H. Burba Jr., of the Army's Forces
Command in Atlanta.
   When the general welcomed the troops of the 82nd Airborne
Division home with the greeting ``airborne all the way,'' a woman
apparently eager to greet one of the soldiers shouted, ``Over here,
all the way.''
   Some 700 to 750 soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, 504th Parachute
Infantry Regiment, arrived on four C-141 transport planes. They had
been sent to Panama Dec. 10 for jungle warfare training.
   They were among about 4,000 soldiers from Fort Bragg that took
part in the Dec. 20 invasion that toppled the ruling Gen. Manuel
Noriega.
   The battalion was involved in seizing Madden Dam, a major source
of electrical power for U.S. installations in the area, and Cerro
Tigre, which was believed to be the main supply depot for Noriega's
troops, Army officials said.
   The battalion also seized the village of Gamboa, home to more
than 50 American families, and El Renacer Prison, where political
prisoners from the failed October coup attempt against Noriega were
held, officials said.
   No soldiers from the battalion were killed, but 23 suffered
wounds or injuries, officials said.
   Of the 23 U.S. soliders killed in Panama, four were based at
Fort Bragg, near Fayetteville, 60 miles southwest of Raleigh.
Uninjured troops began returning to U.S. bases last week.
   ``The strategy and the tactics were good,'' Burba told soldiers
standing in formation in a misty rain. ``You were well trained ...
you had great leadership. We're really proud of you.''
   The general praised the soldiers' work as ``absolutely
brilliant. ... You ushered in a new era of combat.''
   Spec. Jerry Wollam, a radio operator, said soldiers were told
when they went to Panama that ``we were going down for jungle
training but we might be some extra help.'' He was reunited with
his wife, Kara, and twin boys Jeremy and Justin, born July 24.
   Kristi Harris, waited for husband Spec. 4 Carlie Harris with her
7-year-old son, Patrick, and son Carlie Jr., who was born four days
ago.
   She said her husband had called her Christmas Eve, the first
word she'd had from him since his unit left, to say he was all
right. Mrs. Harris said no special celebration was planned for the
missed Christmas holiday because her husband's homecoming ``is
probably Christmas enough.''
   Family members, some waving small United States flags and others
holding umbrellas to ward off the light mist, waited under a banner
that said, ``Team Bragg is proud of `Just Cause' Soldiers.'' The
military operation was code named ``Just Cause.''
   In the crowd was Marie Ballou, who was six months pregnant when
her husband, Staff Sgt. Todd Ballou, was sent to Panama.
   Mrs. Ballou had false labor on Christmas Day, which her doctors
told her was caused by the stress of worrying about her husband.
   ``I'm glad they finally took care of the situation'' in Panama,
she said. ``It's been a long time coming.''

<HEAD>Ex-Guerrilla Leader Proposes Angolan Peace Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of a long-dormant Angolan resistance
group proposed a peace plan Monday involving a ``round-table'' of
Angola's leaders, a U.N. peacekeeping force and free elections
after an 18-month transition period.
   Holden Roberto, head of the National Front for the Liberation of
Angola, which was a powerful force with U.S. backing in the
mid-70s, told a news conference in Paris that Angola should take
inspiration from the ``wind of change'' sweeping eastern Europe.
   Eduardo Dos Santos, president of Angola's Marxist government,
would remain in charge for the 18-month transition period, Roberto
said, and the U.N. force would be modeled after the one assuring
transition to independence in neighboring Namibia.
   He said U.N. troops would be responsible for making sure no
foreign military aid reached either Dos Santos' Popular Movement
for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) or its chief rival, the
National Union for the Total Liberation of Angola of Jonas Savimbi.
   All political or military prisoners held by both sides should be
released under the plan, Roberto said.
   Roberto's and Savimbi's groups, along with MPLA, were
signatories of the 1975 agreement that was supposed to lead to
peaceful independence of Angola, then a Portuguese colony.
   But the pact fell apart, and the National Front for the
Liberation of Angola was nearly annihilated in the late 1970s,
while Savimbi's UNITA has continued to battle the MPLA government.
   After the Reagan aministration began aiding Savimbi in 1986,
Roberto also sought American help to re-establish his guerrillas,
apparently without success.

<HEAD>Hungarians Shocked at Drastic Price Increases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shoppers were shocked and angered
Monday by steep price increases for food and other consumer goods
despite a government campaign to prepare them for the
belt-tightening measures.
   The increases were part of an austerity package approved by
parliament that will qualify Hungary for new credits from the
International Monetary Fund.
   The trade unions maintain the increases will push as many as 3
million of the country's 10.6 million inhabitants below the
official poverty line, which was set on Dec. 31 at just over $80 a
month.
   ``I simply do not know how I am going to make ends meet,'' said
Eva Kekes, a single publishing house editor, expressing the
sentiment of many Hungarians.
   The price increases will boost the consumer price level by 19.5
percent, almost equaling the government's forecast of 20 percent
inflation for all of 1990, the MTI news agency reported.
   Except for one specific brand of milk and bread, producers will
be free to set all food prices, a fact that already has led to
retail prices of meat and meat products going up an average 32
percent, dairy products by almost 43 percent and bread by 20
percent.
   Cigarettes, beer and spirits were 20 percent to 22 percent
higher.
   As word spread about the extent of the price increases, store
shelves began to empty and lines grew longer at stores and gas
stations as people were hoarding on a large scale.
   Rice, flour, sugar, vegetable oil, canned meats, frozen
vegtables were sold out.
   Some customers were overheard saying ``Just like Poland,'' where
austerity measures took effect Jan. 1.
   Last week, butchers were under siege and shelves soon emptied
even of lard. On Saturday, milk was impossible to find. People were
also buying detergents and similar products, although these prices
were not going up.
   On Friday and Saturday, the waiting time at gas stations was
about three hours, with people filling cans in anticipation of a 15
percent to 17 percent increase.
   On Monday, many food stores were closed because the staff was
pricing items and restocking shelves.
   Ms. Kekes, 36, said singles especially were hard hit ``because
we have only one income, yet pay high rents, high utilities and
high retail prices.''
   ``At the same time, singles are discriminated against when
seeking credit and when applying for housing,'' she said.
   Peter Huzella, a folk singer in an above-average income bracket,
said that ``past price hikes did not make that much of a
difference, but this one hit us hard.''
   ``Our regular skiing trips are off and we have to rethink the
special classes _ languages and sports _ the kids are taking,''
said Huzella, who has has a wife who is working, and three children
aged 6, 10, and 14.
   ``I am sure we'll have enough to eat, but I am really worried
about the people I see around me, especially those of my parents'
generation,'' said Huzella, 40.
   His wife, Hajnal, said that with their jobs and the children,
``there is simply no time to go bargain-hunting. We'll just have to
save where we can.''
   Cars imported from Warsaw Pact countries became 25 percent more
expensive, and sewage and water rates had already been raised by
336 percent, MTI said.
   Apartment rents are to increase by an average 35 percent from
Feb. 1, while postal charges went up by an average 22 percent
Monday.
   Also from next month, local transport fares will go up by 55
percent in Budapest and by 45 percent in other cities, while rail
and inter-city bus fares will increase by an average 20 percent.

   Gotti, 48, alleged to be the head of the Gambino crime family,
and Anthony Guerrieri, 60, are charged in the May 1986 shooting of
John F. O'Connor of Brewster, vice president and business manager
of the Carpenters Union Local 608. A third defendant died in
December.
   State Supreme Court Justice Edward McLaughlin said the trial
will last about three weeks, with the jurors locked away in hotels
when trial is not in session.
   About three-fourths of the initial pool of 300 prospective
jurors said they were unable to sit on a sequestered jury for three
weeks and were excused. The remaining 77 were given 11-page
questionnaires about their personal histories and opinions.
   Earlier, McLaughlin rejected a prosecution request for an
anonymous jury, saying the defense would be given the jurors' names
but not their home addresses or places of business.
   ``The defendants in this case will stop at nothing to prevent
their conviction on the charges currently pending against them,''
Assistant District Attorney Jeffrey Schlanger said in court papers.
   Schlanger said that it took three trials to reach a verdict in
1988 in a federal racketeering and narcotics case involving Gotti's
brother, Gene, and several associates, because jurors were accosted
and intimidated.
   Prosecutors say Gotti commissioned members of a gang called the
Westies to shoot O'Connor after O'Connor had a restaurant
vandalized for using non-union carpenters.
   O'Connor, shot in the buttocks, apparently did not know the
restaurant was managed by reputed Gambino family associate Phillip
Modica, prosecutors say.

<HEAD>Priest Says Cristiani Statements on Massacre Didn't Go Far Enoough</HEAD>

   President Alfredo Cristiani's
acknowledgment that the military was responsible for killing six
priests at the Central American University did not go far enough,
its new rector said Monday.
   ``He only confirmed what we have said from the beginning. We
need something more complete,'' said the Rev. Francisco Estrada of
Cristiani's announcement Sunday night.
   Military and government officials declined to return telephone
calls seeking elaboration of the president's admission that
soldiers were responsible for the Nov. 16 slayings of six priests
and educators and two women who lived on the Jesuit-run campus.
   Cristiani, in a five-minute nationwide address, did not say who
has been implicated in the crime, or give any idea of their number
or rank.
   The chief of the joint chiefs of staff said Sunday night that 47
members of an elite battalion, including two officers, were being
questioned in connection with the slayings. But it was still
unclear Monday if those soldiers and officers were the ones
referred to by Cristiani.
   The United States on Monday praised Cristiani's announcement,
but to Estrada, the speech ``was not relevant.''
   ``It is not enough that they (the armed forces) put forward a
sergeant. The question is, who ordered that sergeant to do it,''
said Estrada, who replaced the Rev. Ignacio Ellacuria, one of those
murdered, as rector.
   Cristiani said a commission has been created ``to determine the
exact circumstances (of the slayings) and clarify the truth in its
complete magnitude.''
   He said investigators would ``deduce responsibilities and make
sure justice is done.'' Punishment will be meted out ``down to the
last person implicated,'' he said.
   The slayings of the six priests and educators was one of the
most heinous political slayings in the decade-long war against the
leftist rebels.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater praised the Salvadoran
investigation and hailed the ``great courage'' of Cristiani.
   ``We asked the investigation be thorough and the prosecution
move ahead and it looks like that's the course he is on,'' said
Fitzwater, who was traveling with President Bush aboard Air Force
One to Florida.
   At the U.S. State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
the Salvadorans have made ``this important breakthrough'' in
identifying alleged perpetrators, but she said prosecution must
follow.
   U.S. authorities have indicated continued support for the
government against the rebels depended to a great extent on
punishing those responsible.
   No military officer has been convicted of a politically
motivated slaying since civil war broke out in late 1979, although
the army was implicated in rightist death squads blamed for the
murders of thousands of suspected leftists in the early 1980s.
   Agents from the United States and Spain have aided in the
investigation. Scotland Yard detectives arrived this weekend and
began work Monday.
   Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, head of the joint chiefs of staff, said
earlier by telephone that 47 soldiers from the elite Atlacatl
battalion have been restricted to base but are not under arrest.
   Ponce said the 47 men being interrogated are members of the unit
that conducted a search of the Jesuits' campus residence two days
before the priests were slain.
   Asked if the men restricted to bases were implicated by evidence
other than the fact that they conducted the search, Ponce declined
to comment.
   A university employee has said she saw men in military uniforms
outside the residence shortly before the shots that killed the
priests were heard. The woman, Lucia Barrera, has been taken for
her own safety to the United States, where she is under the
protection of the Jesuits.
   The priests and educators _ Ellacuria, Ignacio Martin-Baro,
Segundo Montes, Amado Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno and Joaquin Lopez
Lopez _ were taken from their beds in their on campus residence
before dawn and killed. Their housekeeper, Julia Ramos, and her
15-year-old daughter Celina, also were slain.
   The slayings took place five days after leftist rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, launched their biggest
offensive of their 10-year-old revolution. The guerrillas have
battled a succession of U.S.-backed governments they say serve as
civilian facades for repressive military rule.
   The far right, which is blamed for the death-squad murders of
several thousand suspected leftists in the early 1980s, had
consistently denounced the Jesuits as subversive ideologues.

   Captured members of Nicolae
Ceausescu's feared security force went on trial before military
courts Monday, charged with trying to crush the uprising that ended
his 24-year reign last month.
   The first such ``terrorist'' convicted was found guilty of
attempted murder and sentenced to nine years in prison, state radio
reported. It said the defendant tried to kill an army officer, but
gave no names or details.
   Restrictions on travel abroad were lifted Monday, and the Roman
Catholic Church said Romanian bishops had met for the first time in
41 years to discuss how the church could be rebuilt after decades
of Communist suppression.
   Sibiu, a city in southern Transylvania that was ruled by
Ceausescu's son, Nicu, was the site of the first trials of members
of the Securitate.
   Members of the Securitate were fiercely loyal to Ceausescu. They
continued to terrorize citizens and battle the army after his fall
Dec. 22 and execution three days later.
   ``A group of terrorists who fought against the people in the
army'' faced a military court, said a spokesman for the National
Salvation Front, the provisional government ruling since
Ceausescu's ouster.
   Aurel Dragos Munteanu, the spokesman and director of television,
told a news conference he was unsure how many security men would
face trial, and gave no details of the exact charges in Sibiu or
other centers of heavy fighting such as Bucharest and Timisoara.
   The accused have no right of appeal, but media _ foreign and
domestic _ will have access to the tribunals, he said.
   The National Salvation Front organized the secret military
tribunal that ordered the president and his wife, Elena, executed
on Dec. 25.
   Since then, it has abolished the death penalty, meaning that the
captured men of crack security units who battled the army after
Ceausescu was ousted face a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   Munteanu said those still under investigation include Nicu
Ceausescu and Gen. Iulian Vlad, the former head of the Securitate,
which has been ordered disbanded by the new leadership.
   Interim President Ion Iliescu signed a decree Monday providing
for the ``right to free travel'' abroad, the state Rompress news
agency reported.
   The decree also abolished the exit-entry visas and stipulated
that passport seekers are entitled to a passport within 20 days
after applying, and in ``justified emergency cases within three
days at the most.''
   ``In view of securing the fundamental rights and freedoms of the
Romanian citizens ... all Romanian citizens older than 14,
irrespective or race, nationality, sex, mother tongue, religion,
political beliefs and occupation have the right to travel freely
abroad,'' Rompress said.
   Under Ceausescu, Romanians had to wait at least three months to
get a passport, which in many cases was not approved. Elderly
people were as a rule allowed to travel to the West, but younger
people or couples were denied.
   The decree, however, stipulated that passports can be refused if
applicants are under prosecution or sentenced to prison, or if they
``are known through confirmed facts of being engaged in activities
that upset public order or commit immoral offense.''
   Romania became the latest former hard-line Soviet bloc country
to lift restrictions on its citizens' travel to the West. East
Germany and Czechoslovakia earlier allowed freer travel.
   Also on Monday, an Italian Roman Catholic church official said
that Romania's Catholic bishops met last week for the first time
since 1948 to discuss ways of rebuilding their church.
   Eleven bishops met Jan. 3-4 in Alba Iulia, central Romania, to
review new prospects for the church, following the fall of
Ceausescu's regime, according to the director of the Italian
Catholic relief agency Caritas.
   Monsignor Giuseppe Pasini, who just returned from Romania, told
a news conference in Rome that the meeting was attended by
Archbishop Francesco Colasuonno, Pope John Paul II's special envoy
for Eastern Europe.
   Pasini said there are ``well-founded hopes'' that the Vatican
and Romania can re-establish diplomatic relations, which were
broken in 1950 when the papal nuncio was expelled from Bucharest.
   The Romanian bishops agreed on the need to re-establish
religious congregations, form a national bishops' conference and
obtain full freedom to exercise their pastoral duties, he said.
   There are about 2.3 million Catholics in Romania, Pasini said,
or about 10 percent of the population. They include 1.45 million
Latin rite Catholics, of whom 1 million belong to the Hungarian
minority and 150,000 are German-speaking.

   A top official and 8 others from the
U.S.-backed Contra guerrillas on Monday ended their armed fight
against the leftist Sandinista government to return home and take
part in the electoral process.
   It was the first Contra group to return to Nicaragua under the
auspices of a United Nations-Organization of American States
committee charged with supervising demobilization of the rebel
force.
   Luis Fley, a long-time official at the rebels' Honduras office,
said the group decided to return as an expression of support for
the Central American peace process and to ``contribute to the
process of national reconciliation.''
   The UN-OAS committee was established under the terms of accords
reached by Central American presidents calling for demobilization
of the Contras in exchange for fair elections in Nicaragua. Contras
who want to take part in elections scheduled for Feb. 25 must
return to Nicaragua by Feb. 5.
   Other Nicaraguans, mostly civilians, have returned under a
different amnesty program.
   Fley, 39, was an attorney for the Contras and a top official at
the Contra office in Tegucigalpa, Honduras. He was better known by
his nom de guerre ``Commander Johnson,'' and for a time controlled
journalists' access to the border camps in Honduras where the
Contra army is based.
   The Central American accords guarantee returnees civil and
political rights. Asked if he felt safe in returning, Fley told
reporters, ``I think so.''
   In a scene showing how war can split relatives, Fley was met by
his family, including two brothers who are officers in the
Sandinista army: Capt. Francisco Fley, 32, and Lt. Jorge Fley, 29.
   A third brother, Enrique Fley, was killed two years ago at age
28 in a Contra ambush.
   The Contras have been fighting to topple the Sandinista
government with U.S. support, and Fley said the conditions that
caused the war have not been solved despite the accords.
   ``The causes of the war have not disappeared because conditions
of liberty, justice and democracy do not yet exist,'' said Fley,
reading a statement during his arrival at Managua's airport.
   The nine arrived on a commercial flight and were met by UN and
OAS representatives; the Nicaraguan ambassador in Honduras,
Francisco Lacayo; and by Commander Luis Guzman of the Interior
Ministry.
   Fley and the others negotiated for their return with Guzman, the
international representatives and Lacayo. Guzman was sent to
Honduras specifically for the negotiations.
   ``Most of the group did not have major information'' about the
Tela accords and the guarantees included in them, Guzman said.
``Undoubtedly, on the part of the Contra leaders there has been no
intention of letting their members know about the extent of the
accords.''
   Guzman said there were talks now taking place for more Contras
to return to civilian life in Nicaragua.
   A document given Fley and the others spells out a series of
guarantees: their constitutional rights are restored; they can
resettle anywhere and can move throughout the country without any
hindrance; they have a right to a passport and to travel outside
the country without restrictions; they can join the political party
of their choice and will not be prosecuted for any past political
or military activity.
   UN representative Werner Blatter of Switzerland said the UN-OAS
committee is charged with keeping track of those who return ``for
any problem that could arise.''

   A series of storms packing heavy rain and high wind rolled
across the Northwest over the weekend, cutting electricity to
thousands of customers, ripping down trees and derailing a freight
train.
   Two deaths in Oregon were blamed on the storms.
   Wind reached 92 mph at Rattlesnake Ridge on the Hanford nuclear
reservation in south-central Washington, said National Weather
Service meteorologist Darrol Lewis. A gust to 94 mph was reported
at a Pacific Power &amp; Light Co. gauge in Astoria, Ore., late Sunday
and 72 mph gusts were reported early Monday in the area of
Pendleton, Ore. Lewiston, Idaho, had a gust to 69 mph.
   Many schools were closed Monday in Idaho, Oregon and Washington
and others opened later than usual because they were without
electricity or had transportation problems caused by limbs and
trees across roads.
   But the storms supplied much-needed snow for Wyoming ski resorts.
   One vigorous storm front moved through the region Saturday
night, a slightly weaker front arrived late Sunday, and another one
was possible Tuesday.
   In Wyoming, high wind knocked 35 railroad flatcars off the
tracks between Cheyenne and Laramie on Sunday, Union Pacific
spokesman John Bromley said moday. Only one of the cars carried
any cargo, he said.
   ``We estimated winds were gusting in the area in excess of 70
miles per hour from the north,'' Bromley said from his Omaha, Neb.,
office. ``Nobody was hurt.''
   Work continued Monday to right the cars, he said. Two other sets
of tracks enabled the railroad to keep traffic moving, said Bromley.
   The Interstate 82 bridge across the Columbia River at Umatilla,
Ore., about 30 miles south of Kennewick, Wash., was closed after a
semi-trailer truck was blown over by the wind, the Washington State
Patrol said.
   Utility crews scrambled Monday to restore power to large areas
of eastern Washington, where trees and flying limbs snapped lines.
Parked cars and buildings were hit by falling trees, and roofs were
blown away.
   Electricity was cut to communities along the Washington-Idaho
border and to the city of Spokane, Wash., said Pat Lynch of
Washington Water Power Co. at Spokane.
   In Moscow, Idaho, ``only one of our schools had power this
morning,'' said School Superintendent C.L. Sutton. ``Those big pine
trees in the older section of town that have been there forever
were pulled up by their roots.''
   Radio stations throughout the Lewiston-Moscow area of Idaho were
knocked off the air.
   Sections of downtown Walla Walla, Wash., were without power and
scattered power outages were reported in the lower Yakima Valley.
   The wind also caused isolated power outages in southeastern
Idaho, around the Pocatello area, and in the Idaho Panhandle.
   In Oregon, at the height of the storm Sunday, 10,000 customers
were without power in the Albany-Corvallis area and 5,000 still
didn't have electricity this morning. In the Dallas area, 6,500
customers had power knocked out and 3,000 didn't have electricity
Monday, Donnelly said.
   The wind was accompanied by heavy rain. Bremerton, Wash.,
received 2.29 inches of rain in the 24 hours ending Sunday
afternoon. Eugene, Ore., reported nearly 4.5 inches of rain in the
48 hours beginning at midnight Saturday.
   In addition to the rain, unseasonably high temperatures
averaging 20 degrees above normal were recorded around Washington,
raising the possibility that melting mountain snow could add to the
rain swelling rivers.
   Wind and rain Saturday night caused mudslides and fallen trees
that briefly blocked highways in parts of Washington.
   A mudslide closed Oregon 38 about 14 miles eas\ qf Reedsport
late Sunday, the Douglas County sheriff's department reported.
   The storms dumped more than 1 foot of snow on the mountains of
northwestern Wyoming, great news at the Jackson Hole Ski Corp.,
which in recent weeks has fought rumors that it was closing because
of a snow shortage.
   ``The skiing has dramatically improved,'' said Bill Lewkowitz,
the resort's national sales manager.
   After receiving 8 inches Friday, the resort collected an
additional 11 to 15 inches from the storm that arrived Sunday
night, said Lewkowitz.
   The snow prompted the Wyoming Highway Department to close Teton
Pass west of Jackson, and high wind and heavy snow forced the
closure of Wyoming 28 over South Pass.

   A band that wants the accordion designated
the city's official instrument says the humble, pleated bellows is
as much a part of the city history as earthquakes, clipper ships
and cable cars.
   Players with Those Darn Accordions! revival band planned to
serenade the mayor outside City Hall on Monday as the city
considers a proposal to proclaim the music box the official
instrument of San Francisco.
   ``There should be an official city instrument because we have
official city songs and we need an instrument to play them on. It
should be the accordion because of its rich history here and
because it was invented here,'' said Tom Torriglia, a band member
leading the effort for official recognition.
   The 13-member band, whose repertoire includes ``Volare,''
``Hernando's Hideaway'' and ``The Godfather'' theme, planned to
pla{@a`Our Lady of Spain'' beneath Mayor Art Agnos' window while
San Francisco Supervisor Willie Kennedy introduced a proposal
giving official status to the instrument.
   ``Mayor Agnos may be Greek but he is first and foremost a San
Franciscan,'' said Torriglia, a free-lance publicist andotertainment
reviewer.
   Despite the lyrical claim of the Starship band that ``it built
this city on rock 'n' roll,'' Torriglia said the accordion more
than the guitar, the piano or even the beatnik bongos of the 1950s
deserves the official nod.
   Classical musicians still harkened back to European traditions
in 1907 when Italian immigrants by the name of Pietro Deiro and
Colombo Piatenesi fitted an old button accordion with a vertical
piano keyboard and created the piano accordion that became as
common at Italian family picnics as the vino, said accordion
historian Ron Flynn of San FrancisCoV
   The Chinese, inventors of the musical reed, originated the
principles of the accordion, whichpw&rsqb;s recreated by Germans and
Italians, said Flynn. In the 1800s, piano keys were added on the
right, with cords and tones played on buttons on the left. Deiro's
improvement on that design spawned an accordion industry in San
Francisco that in its 1920s heyday included eight accordion
manufacturing firms and teachers famed nationwide and in Europe.
   Few remnants of that era remain, said Torriglia, who blames the
British rock 'n' roll invasion and ``schmaltzy'' Lawrence Welk with
the waning popularity of the accordion.
   The instrument remains a favorite in Chicago's immigrant
communities, with Cajun and Brazilian bands and in other regions,
Flynn said. But in the San Francisco Bay area, the Colombo &amp; Sons
repair shop in Marin County is one of the few remaining descendants
of the days when the renowned Guerrini Accordion Co. flourished in
the heart of San Francisco's North Beach neighborhood.
   Torriglia says the ``um-pah um-pah'' sound of the accordion
pushing wind through its vibrating reeds is an expressive sound
that enables him to convey his most passionate emotions.
   Besides, he said, the accordion is part of a tradition even
older than Italian picnics or Chinese ingenuity, ``It's a good way
to meet girls.''

   The Kremlin's ideology chief told Lithuanian
Communists on Monday their break with Moscow is a blow to President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reform program at its most critical moment.
   Vadim A. Medvedev, a member of the ruling Politburo, made the
comment as he laid the groundwork for a trip to Lithuania this week
by Gorbachev, a visit that will test Gorbachev's ability to end one
of the worst political crises of his nearly five-year tenure.
   Violence along the Soviet-Iranian border meanwhile was reported
to have reignited and spread to an area that also is close to
Turkey. Soviet Azerbaijani protesters reportedly destroyed more
border posts.
   Medvedev told Communists and workers at a factory in Vilnius,
the capital of Lithuania, that their party's decision Dec. 20 to
declare independence from the national party has ``effects on the
problems of interethnic relations and national-state structure and
economic reforms,'' Tass said.
   In a dispatch paraphrasing him, the official news agency did not
say how economic reforms would be damaged.
   ``The decisions made by the 20th Congress of the Lithuanian
Communist Party are a blow to the Soviet Communist Party's unity,
to the construction of a revitalized federation and to all of
perestroika,'' Tass said, paraphrasing Medvedev.
   The decision is seen as a possible precursor to secession by the
Baltic republic of 3.7 million people.
   The Kremlin is clearly extremely concerned over the prospect
that the entire Soviet federation could break apart if other
republics follow Lithuania's move.
   Politburo member Alexander N. Yakovlev said in an interview
Monday with Interfax, a news service of Radio Moscow, the
Lithuanian move might cause a ``domino effect'' _ implying that
Communists in the 14 other republics might also break from Moscow.
   Medvedev said the split cuts off Lithuanians from democratic
processes throughout the country and ``cannot be assessed otherwise
but as an expression of no-confidence in the Soviet Communist Party
and its course for perestroika, as a blow to perestroika at the
most critical time of its development.''
   In remarks carried by Soviet TV, he asked Lithuanian Communists
to compromise, saying, ``Nobody is against independence. But let
this be together with the Soviet Communist Party.
   ``We have to unite, then we will have nothing to fear.''
   Gorbachev is expected to arrive in Vilnius on Wednesday and
spend three days trying to persuade the Lithuanians to return to
the fold. The Lithuanian grassroots movement Sajudis is calling for
a giant demonstration during the visit show the people's
determination to pursue independence.
   Gorbachev has blasted the split, saying the Communists were
giving in to ``separatists.'' Leaders of the breakaway party who
met with him in Moscow last week said, however, he promised not to
interfere if they stuck with their decision.
   The government daily Izvestia said Monday that Azerbaijani
protesters destroyed border posts at Ilichevsk, continuing a wave
of unrest that began Dec. 31. Protesters demanding to cross the
Aras River, which borders Iran, confronted guards who set up
armored personnel carriers and trucks to blockade a bridge. But the
guards retreated to ``avoid bloodletting,'' Izvestia said.
   After the protesters passed through, they destroyed the border
posts so that the frontier of Azerbaijan's Nakhichevan region with
Iran is without defenses, according to the newspaper.
   Thousands of protesters demanding open borders and unification
with their ethnic brethren in Iran have destroyed guard observation
towers, electronic alarms and communications lines along the border.
   Elsewhere in Azerbaijan, Tass said sabotage, hostage-taking and
sniper fire continued in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh district. A
highway bridge between Agdam and Askeran was blown up Thursday and
four days later, an explosion damaged a railway bridge near Agdam,
forcing suspension of traffic.
   Strikes and violence have torn the mountainous Nagorno-Karabakh
territory for two years as majority Armenians fight Azerbaijanis
for control.

   Pro-democracy groups forced early adjournment
Monday of weekly talks with the Communist Party on East Germany's
future, demanding proof that the hated secret police were being
disbanded as promised.
   About 100,000 reformers rallied at Leipzig, in the first of its
regular Monday evening demonstrations after a three-week break.
   As at previous Leipzig demonstrations, the crowd was divided
between those favoring reunification with West Germany and those
opposed. Rally sponsors canceled the usual speeches to prevent a
confrontation on the issue.
   In the crowd were banners with such slogans as ``Down with the
SED'' _ the Socialist Unity Party, the Communists' formal name _
and ``Gysi out,'' a reference to party chairman Gregor Gysi.
   About 50,000 people rallied at Karl-Marx-Stadt and thousands
demonstrated in Schwerin, Halle, Neubrandenburg and Cottbus, said
ADN, the official news agency.
   ADN said the first indictments against 30 former top Communists
were expected next month and more investigations would be completed
in March and April.
   A near-frenzy against corruption and abuse of power has
developed since Erich Honecker, the 77-year-old Stalinist party
chief, was deposed in October after 18 years in power.
   The agency said it could not predict when charges could be
expected against Honecker, who also is the object of a criminal
investigation, but it denied there was any intentional delay in
pursuing his case.
   Honecker is hospitalized, the agency reported, but it did not
say where. Last week, ADN said he had a malignant kidney tumor.
   Monday's confrontation illustrated the wariness with which
reformers regard the transitional government of Hans Modrow, the
Communist premier.
   Two major opposition groups _ including the largest, New Forum _
have threatened to leave the talks because of what they call
government efforts to preserve the secret police. Failure of the
talks could set the stage for new political turmoil.
   A majority of delegates supported a motion by New Forum to end
the Monday session an hour early and block consideration of other
topics until officials provide details on the dissolution of the
once-feared secret police.
   Delegates demanded unanimously that the government submit a
report about internal security at the meeting Jan. 15.
   Democratic Awakening, an opposition group, initially demanded
that Modrow and other top officials appear at the meeting within
two hours to clear up the matter. That was abandoned because Modrow
was traveling to Bulgaria.
   Rolf Henrich of New Forum revealed what he said was a draft
message prepared by secret police agents in Gera on Dec. 9, urging
authorities in East Berlin to ``paralyze'' the opposition. Henrich
said he did not know whether the message had been sent.
   Opposition delegates demanded the government disarm agents of
the former State Security Office by Jan. 19 and cancel plans to
establish a successor agency before free elections in May.
   Modrow has said a new security agency was needed to counter what
his government claims is an increase of neo-Nazism in East Germany.
   ADN reported several weekend incidents of neo-Nazi graffiti and
vandalism.
   It said Franz Schoenhuber, leader of the extreme-right
Republican Party in West Germany, was turned back by border police
Monday when he tried to enter East Berlin. ADN did not say why
Schoenhuber wanted to visit East Germany.
   Markus Meckel of the opposition Social Democrats accused the
government of sowing ``hysteria'' with warnings of neo-Nazism, to
try to preserve the secret police.
   Konrad Weiss of Democracy Now was quoted by the West German
newspaper Bild as estimating the number of neo-Nazis in East
Germany at 1,500 or more and describing them as ``a serious
threat.''
   At Monday's negotiations, Peter Koch, named by the government to
oversee the dissolution of the secret police, said authorities
would confiscate all the former agency's arms by the end of January.
   Skeptical delegates bombarded Koch with questions and he agreed
to let opposition observers visit his commission.
   He said citizen committees and opposition representatives
throughout the country were ensuring against a return of the
domestic spying, including telephone bugging, used by the
Communists for 40 years to control the population.
   The talks, involving about 40 delegates, were begun Dec. 7 as a
way for the opposition to express grievances and have a say in
running the country until the elections May 6.

   Art Buchwald won his lawsuit against
Paramount Pictures on Monday when a judge ruled the humorist's
original script idea was the basis for Eddie Murphy's box office
bonanza ``Coming to America.''
   Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider's decision means Paramount
will have to pay Buchwald a share of profits from the film, which
has grossed more than $300 million since its 1988 release.
Buchwald, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, filed a $5 million
suit against Paramount a year ago, claim9n&lsqb; the studio breached a
1983 contract to purchase his script idea.
   A second accounting  ...   of the trial will examine profits on
``Coming to America'' and determine the plaintiffs' share.
   ``The courT oncludes that `Coming to America' is a movie that
was based upon Buchwald's treatment `King for a Day,''' Schneider
said in a 34-page written ruling.
   Buchwald called the decision a victory for writers everywhere.
   ``I am very, very happy. This thing is not only an important
thing for me. I think it's really important for writers,'' he said
in a telephone interview from Washington.
   ``I didnwtknow what I was getting into when I started because
those guys play rough, and we beat them. And that makes me very
happy,'' Buchwald said. ``I doubt if I"`nt to get involved with
Hollywood for some time.''
   Paramount issued a statement saying it would appeal Monday's
ruling.
  *`gWe don't think there's any similarity between these two works
_ it's like `Godzilla' and `Cinderella,''' said Paramount attorney
Robert Draper. ``The only similarity is that both (of the
characters in the Buchwald and Murphy scripts) are black. We think
that the law is clear on it, and we think that the evidence that
came in on it was clear and we intend to present that to the
appellate court.''
   Buchwald attorney Pierce O`Donnell suggested the accounting
phase of the trial would ``take the lid off Hollywood creative
financing.'' Paramount claims ``Coming to America,'' with its gross
profits over $300 million, has shown no net profits.
   ``If you believe that,'' quipped Buchwald, ``then there's a
wonderful S&amp;L I'd like to sell you.''
   O'Donnell said Buchwald and Buchwald's partner, producer Alain
Bernheim, could collect between $5 million to $10 million as their
share of the film's net profits and called the decision a victory
for Hollywood's creative community.
   ``I've never seen such a decisive victory for a writer,'' he
said. ``It's a landmark decision.''
   ``I am delighted that the little man kicked the big guy,'' added
Billy Wilder, a Buchwald ally, the director and co-writer of
Paramount's 1950 classic ``Sunset Boulevard'' and a frequent
visitor to the courtroom during the trial.
   Schneider emphasized that his decision was not intended to
disparage the creative talent of Eddie Murphy, who said he wrote
the script.
   ``The court desires to indicate what this Ca^Ke is and is not
about,'' the judge said. ``It is not about whether Art Buchwald or
Eddie Murphy is more creative. It is clear to the court that each
of these men is a creative genius in his own field and each is a
uniquely American institution.''
   Schneider stressed that Buchwald's contract dispute was with
Paramount, not Murphy.
   Murphy co-star Arsenio Hall testified at the trial that he and
Murphy independently conceived the idea for ``Coming to America.''
   Schneider found that Buchwald's idea and Murphy movie were
substantially similar.
   Buchwald's 1982 script synopsis optioned by Paramount involved a
young member of royalty from``Pmythical African kingdom who comes
to the United States and is deposed in his absence. He winds up in
a Washington ghetto working in a fast food restaurant where he
meets and marries a young black woman.
   In Murphy's movie, a prince from a mythical African kingdom
comes to New York in search of a bride, winds up in a ghetto
working in a fast food restaurant, meets a young black woman and
marries her.

<TEXT>
   Terry-Thomas, the consummate upper-class rotter in
dozens of film comedies, including ``It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad
World,'' died Monday at age 78, after a long battle with
Parkinson's Disease.
   The actor, whose trademarks were a gap between his upper front
teeth, a well-brushed mustache and a long cigarette holder, died at
a nursing home in Godalming, Surrey, according to the Parkinson's
Disease Society.
   On screen ``he was a terrific cad. He was the ultimate cad,''
said actor Nigel Havers.
   ``He was the last of the great gentlemen on the cinema along
with, in my experience, people like Fred Astaire and David Niven,''
said Lionel Jeffries, who appeared with Terry-Thomas in ``Rocket to
the Moon'' in 1967.
   Terry-Thomas had been diagnosed as having the degenerative
muscle disease in 1971 and had not appeared in films since ``The
Hound of the Baskervilles'' in 1978.
   The cost of his care eventually forced him to sell his luxurious
home on the Mediterranean island of Ibiza. In London, he lived in
an apartment provided by a charity.
   The star of films including ``I'm All Right, Jack'' and ``It's a
Mad Mad Mad Mad World,'' had been too ill to attend a benefit in
his honor in London last April, which raised $51,000 for his care.
   In films, Terry-Thomas was often the upper-class cad or silly
ass murmuring ``jolly good show,'' as in his role as Sir Percy in
``Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines.''
   He once denied that he was ``typically English.''
   ``That makes me a bit of a sham I suppose. Because as you know I
have made all my money, or most of it anyway, by sending up pompous
Englishmen,'' he said.
   He was born Thomas Terry Hoar Stevens on July 14, 1911 and took
his first two names for stage use until too many people thought he
was related to actress Ellen Terry.
   He got his start in the theater in an amateur dramatic society
associated with the Union Cold Storage Co., where he was a meat
salesman. Even then, his appearance was splendid: a cigarette
holder, a silver-topped Malacca cane, suede shoes and yellow
leather gloves were part of the ensemble.
   ``I felt that my impeccable appearance more than compensated for
my habitual late arrival at the office,'' he wrote in his book,
``Filling the Gap.''
   His first film appearance was in ``Helter Skelter'' in 1949.
   Terry-Thomas' career took off in 1956 with the role of a
commanding officer in the farce ``Privates Progress,'' which
required him to handle such lines as ``You're an absolute shower.''
   He appeared in ``The Green Man'' the same year and then in 1957
teamed with Ian Carmichael in ``Brothers in Law'' and ``Lucky Jim.''
   In 1958, he appeared with Peter Sellers in ``Tom Thumb'' for MGM
and in the British spoof ``Carlton Brown at the F.O.''
   Terry-Thomas played the fatuous factory personnel manager to
Sellers' communist shop steward in ``I'm All Right, Jack'' in 1959.
   Terry-Thomas' first marriage, to ballet dancer Ida Patlanski,
ended in divorce in 1962.
   A year later he married Belinda Cunningham, who was 27 years
younger, and they had two sons, Tiger and Cushan.
   In an interview in 1984, Terry-Thomas was resigned about his
illness.
   ``It's no good asking why this had to happen to me,'' he said.
``There aren't any answers. The only thing we know definitely is
that things get worse. There is no way of improving. You ask me how
it feels ... there is a whole plethora of symptoms. Now I have said
that ... other times I cannot say the simplest possible word, like
lavatory paper.''
   He is survived his wife and his two sons.

<HEAD>FAA May Require That Infants, Toddlers Have Tickets</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said
Monday it intends to revise safety requirements for infants and
toddlers traveling on airliners, but is not sure what form the rule
will take.
   FAA Administator James Busey said the agency's eventual action,
which could be two years away, may mean that adults traveling with
children under age 2 will have to buy tickets for the youngsters
and, perhaps, have them secured in FAA-approved child seats.
   Current FAA quidelines allow a child under age 2 to ride for
free on an adult's lap.
   Busey, asked if the revised requirements would disallow that
practice, replied, ``We want to know what the public wants. ...
That's part of the problem .''
   He also told reporters at a transportation convention, ``I can't
make a rule that requires the airlines to provide free seats.''
   If Transportation Secretary Elizabeth Dole approves the FAA
proposal to write rules for the airlines' youngest passengers, a
formal notice will be printed in the Federal Register.
   The public will then have 90 days to comment. An FAA spokesman
said hearings may be held.
   A representative of the Association of Flight Attendants, which
strongly supports putting children under age 2 in some sort of
restraints, commented after Busey's announcement that ``it's
ludicrous that there are FAA regulations in place to restrain
carry-on baggage while babies are allowed to fly around the cabin
during a crash.''
   Nancy Gilmer, air safety coordinator for the association,
praised the FAA for moving quickly on efforts to improve safety for
small children and said many parents don't understand the problem
of unrestrained youngsters.
   ``It's not unusual to be getting ready to take off and some
little kid is running down the aisle,'' she said. ``As a flight
attendant, it's something you learn to deal with.''
   A spokeswoman for USAir said the airline is neutral on the
subject of toughened safety requirements for small children.
   Spokeswoman Susan Young said a majority of parents traveling
with children under age 2 carry them on the adults' laps, although
some parents bring their own carriers and buy tickets for their
children.
   Interest in airliner child restraints rose after the July 19
crash of United Airlines Flight 232 at Sioux City, Iowa.
   Five children under age 2 were traveling on adults' laps; one
was a 23-month-old boy who died after his mother lost her grip as
the plane cartwheeled across a runway, split apart and burst into
flames. The child died of smoke inhalation.
   Busey also said told reporters that within 18 months the public
can expect to see airport security devices that will detect plastic
explosives.
   The technology to detect such explosives exists and is in use
for baggage checked into airliner cargo space at John F. Kennedy
International Airport in New York and will soon be installed in
Miami.
   He said that the equipment is still too cumbersome to be used
for carry-on luggage but that the devices are becoming smaller and
soon will be standard equipment in all airports.

<TEXT>
   Representatives of the U.N. Security Council's five
permanent members will meet in Paris next week to consider ways of
bringing peace to Cambodia, diplomatic sources said Monday.
   They said the two-day talks would focus on an Australian
proposal to replace Cambodia's Communist government with a U.N.
administration until formation of a new government after free
elections.
   Deputy foreign ministers of the United States, Soviet Union,
China, Britain and France are to participate in the Paris meeting
Jan. 15-16, the diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Michael Costello, Australia's deputy foreign minister, met with
Premier Hun Sen of Cambodia on Monday about the proposal. The
official Cambodian news agency SPK said they met in an ``eastern
province of Cambodia'' and agreed to the idea of involving the
United Nations in an interim administration.
   Guerrilla attacks in western Cambodia have increased
international pressure to find ways of preventing a return to power
by the Khmer Rouge, who conducted a reign of terror from the end of
the Indochina war in 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia
in December 1978.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said talks among the five countries would take place ``in the near
future,'' but would not confirm the date or place.
   ``Reports of stepped-up military activity by the Khmer Rouge
underscore the need to move quickly toward a diplomatic solution,''
she said. ``We believe that a comprehensive settlement is thae best
way to ensure that the Khmer Rouge do not enhance their influence
in Cambodia by means of force.''
   The Khmer Rouge is allied with two non-Communist resistance
groups backed by the United States in a coalition led by Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, Cambodia's former ruler. They are fighting the
Hun Sen government, which Vietnam sponsors.
   Vietnam says it completed withdrawing its occupation army from
Cambodia at the end of September.
   In an intrerview broadcast by Cambodian state radio Sunday, the
defense minister acknowledged guerrilla advances in western areas
near the Thai border, and said his forces had left some positions
to concentrate defenses on major towns and roads.
   ``The enemies have been gradually advancing in their attacks
against a number of our positions along the border,'' Gen. Tea Banh
said. ``We have lost some positions. We cannot stay in every
village. We have to abandon some and keep some strategic ones.''
   Peace efforts, notably an international conference last summer
in Paris, have failed in large part because the Hun Sen government
refuses to include the Khmer Rouge in an all-party interim
administration.
   Sihanouk argues that excluding the Khmer Rouge, the strongest
guerrilla group, would only ensure continued fighting.
   Australia suggests about 200 administrators be sent to govern
Cambodia, supported by a 7,000-member peacekeeping force. The Khmer
Rouge has ignored the Australian proposal.
   On Jan. 3, Sihanouk said he would agree to an interim U.N.
administration and vacate the Cambodian seat at the United Nations,
which the guerrilla alliance holds, if the existing government was
dismantled at the same time.
   The Australian plan cannot be put into effect without the
approval of all five permanent members of the Security Council.

   A researcher who met with Manuel Antonio
Noriega last year says Noriega told him ``the United States began
its campaign to remove me'' after he refused to allow Panama to be
used as a base for the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Saul Landau, a senior fellow at the Institute for Policy
Studies, a Washington think tank, said Noriega told him last fall
that John Poindexter, President Reagan's national security adviser,
visited Panama in 1985 seeking Noriega's support for the Contras.
   ``Poindexter came to see me about what he said was a very urgent
matter,'' Landau, in a report in the February-March issue of Mother
Jones magazine, quoted Noriega as saying.
   According to Landau's account in Mother Jones, which provided an
advance copy of the article to The Associated Press, Noriega
continued:
   ``The admiral wanted to use Panamanian territory to train and
launch Contra against Nicaragua. I explained to him why we could
not become a launching pad for the Contra without causing
turbulence in the region. I explained to him that if Panama assumed
such a role in the area it would not help, but rather hurt, U.S.
interests.''
   Noriega, according to Landau, said Poindexter was visibly
angered by Noriega's refusal.
   ``Poindexter grew quite indignant, right in my office,'' Landau
quoted Noriega as saying. ``He took out his pipe and banged it on
the table. I'm not sure if he broke it. After that incident, the
United States began its campaign to remove me.''
   Landau said he spoke to Noriega at a reception during a seminar
Noriega had organized on U.S. intervention in Third World countries.
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. authorities last week after
evading caputure during the U.S. invasion of Panama, is being held
in Florida on drug-related charges.
   Poindexter is scheduled to stand trial later this month on
charges stemming from his role in the Iran-Contra scandal. His
attorney did not immediately return a telephone message left Monday
by The AP.
   The statements attributed to Noriega by Landau are similar to an
account Noriega gave in February 1988 on the CBS-TV program ``60
Minutes.''
   In that interview, Noriega said he met with Poindexter on Dec.
17, 1985, and refused a Reagan administration request that Panama
be used as a training ground for the Contra rebels trying to
overthrow Nicaragua's Sandinista government.
   Noriega told ``60 Minutes'' that Poindexter told him the United
States would harm Panama politically and economically if the
request was turned down.
   In a speech days before that interview, Noriega said that
Poindexter had asked him for unspecified cooperation in Central
America and that when he refused Poindexter told him to ``expect
the consequences.'' In the speech, Noriega said he considered his
indictment on the drug charges the consequence.

   Jesse Jackson said Monday he would travel to
South Africa soon, following announcement that the government there
would grant him a long-denied visa.
   Jackson said the visa decision and the recent release of several
leaders of the banned African National Congress demonstrated that
``some walls have come down.''
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said Monday the
government had told Jackson that he ``will be welcome to come to
South Africa and the necessary visa will be issued to him to travel
to South Africa at a mutually convenient time.''
   ``I've been trying to return for ten years ... and since
President (F. W.) de Klerk met with Nelson Mandela obviously some
walls have come down,'' said Jackson.
   Since taking office in August, de Klerk has freed several of
Mandela's colleagues from the African National Congress guerrilla
movement and has indicated Mandela's release will follow.
   ``The walls must come down in South Africa just as they have
come down in Europe so people can get beyond the violence of
separation to the constructing of a society where black and white
people can live together without fear and mistrust,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
   The civil rights leader and former presidential candidate has
visited several countries in the region but always was turned down
when he requested a visa for South Africa.
   Asked when he would visit the country which he has criticized
for its apartheid policies of racial segregation, Jackson said:
``It will be soon but the date and time has not been established.''
   Jackson said he would visit as the guest of the South African
Council of Churches which recently reissued a longstanding
invitation. Jackson also noted that the Dutch Reformed Church,
which he said had until recently provided ``the theological
underpinnings'' of apartheid, had also invited him to visit the
country.
   ``I hope that the American policy and the decisions from within
South Africa can hasten the day that the system will end without
bloodshed.'' said Jackson.

   The computer tampering trial of an Ivy
League student accused of crippling thousands of computers
nationwide opened Monday with jury selection and federal
prosecutors seeking to limit defense evidence.
   Opening arguments were to begin Tuesday morning in the U.S.
District Court trial of Robert T. Morris Jr., a 24-year-old
suspended Cornell University graduate student.
   The Arnold, Md., man is the first person to come to trial under
the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. If convicted, he faces up to
five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Morris is accused of designing and setting loose a so-called
``worm'' program that replicated wildly, immobilizing an estimated
6,000 computers linked to the Internet research computer network,
including those at Air Force and National Aeronautics and Space
Administration facilities.
   In a motion filed Monday, Justice Department lawyers sought to
hinder Morris' expected defense that he did not intend to paralyze
the computer network by allegedly introducing a rogue program into
it on Nov. 2, 1988.
   The prosecutors asked Judge Howard Munson to limit examination
of witnesses on Morris' state of mind, specifically whether it was
his intent to prevent authorized use of Internet and to cause any
loss or damage to the system.
   ``The evidence of lack of intent to cause loss, or lack of
intent to prevent the authorized use of the victim computers,
however, is simply not relevant to any issue in this case,'' the
motion said.
   Munson did not immediately rule on the motion. But when defense
attorney Thomas Guidoboni raised the question of intent in a
pretrial motion to have Morris' indictment dismissed, Munson
rejected the argument that the defendant's intentions were
pertinent to the indictment's legality.
   Guidoboni contends the law is unclear as to whether criminal
intent means intent to cause damage or simply intent to gain access
to computer systems.
   Justice Department attorneys Ellen R. Meltzer and Mark D. Rasch
declined to comment on their own motion outside the courtroom.
   The first 10 potential jurors questioned from a pool of 93 were
dismissed due to objections by Munson or lawyers, but all parties
were able to agree on the next 12 candidates, finishing jury
selection in less than three hours.
   Morris, who was a first-year doctoral student in computer
studies before his suspension, sat attentively as lawyers
questioned potential jurors. His father, Robert T. Morris Sr.,
chief scientist at the National Computer Security Center in
Bethesda, Md., and mother also attended.
   Prosecutors also asked the court to allow witnesses to explain
what the worm program was designed to do.
   ``Evidence that Morris designed earlier versions of the computer
virus are relevant to the charges,'' the government said in its
motion. The earlier versions were not launched.
   The trial is expected to last about two weeks. The government
presented the court with a potential list of about 20 witnesses,
and Guidoboni named at least four witnesses in court.
   A Cornell University commission concluded that Morris was guilty
of ``reckless disregard'' for creating the program. Although the
university commission found him responsible, Morris has never
publicly admitted creating the worm program or introducing it into
Internet.

   Leaders of the Communist Party,
opposition and ethnic groups united in appealing Monday for an end
to protests and strikes over the decision to restore rights to
Bulgaria's ethnic Turks.
   Consultations about settling the ethnic dispute began Monday and
will continue all week, the official news agency BTA reported.
   Politburo member Mincho Yovchev said ``unrest over the ...
decision'' Dec. 29 to restore religious rights to 1.2 million
ethnic Turks and withdraw the requirement that they take Bulgarian
names had created the ``first serious crisis'' since reforms began
two months ago.
   Petar Mladenov, who replaced Todor Zhivkov as party chief Nov.
10 and ended 35 years of Stalinist rule, defended the policy
reversal in a meeting with Slav nationalists.
   He told leaders of the Council for the Defense of National
Interests that the 1984 decisions restricting the rights of ethnic
Turks, most of whom are Moslems, ``were very grave errors,'' BTA
reported.
   ``One result of these errors has been Bulgaria's complete
international isolation,'' Mladenov said, and the only way out of
that situation was ``to restore the constitutional rights of all
citizens,'' the agency reported.
   Yovchev, a deputy premier, said the ``wounds inflicted on
Bulgarian society as a whole'' by Zhivkov's persecution of ethnic
Turks ``turned out to be much more serious than we assumed.''
   After Zhivkov granted passports last May, 325,000 ethnic Turks
fled Bulgaria for Turkey. About 96,000 have returned, complaining
of poor housing and lack of jobs.
   ``Pressed for time, we were unable to accompany our decision in
principle (Dec. 29) with a comprehensive program on the ethnic
issue,'' he said in a television interview.
   His comments reflected the predicament of a leadership caught
between demands by the ethnic Turkish minority for rights and
protests by tens of thousands of Slav nationalists against
concessions.
   ``Different forces take advantage of this to discredit the new
leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the state'' and the
Politburo is seeking a ``practical solution'' to the ethnic
problem, Yovchev said. He and others have hinted that Zhivkov
loyalists incited ethnic unrest.
   Foreign Minister Boiko Dimitrov of Bulgaria and the Turkish
foreign minister, Mesut Yilmaz, are to discuss the problem at a
meeting Tuesday in Kuwait.
   At Monday's meeting of delegates from all groups concerned with
the ethnic conflict, trade union official Krasniu Petkov urged that
demonstrations and strikes cease ``during this week of dialogue,''
BTA reported.
   Petkov said all participants in the talks at the National
Assembly supported Petkov.
   About 200 people demonstrated in front of the parliament
building, demanding the restrictions on ethnic Turks continue. They
displayed placards with such nationalist slogans as ``One People,
One Language, One Flag.''
   Nationalists have expressed fear their own culture would at one
time be overshadowed by that of the Turks, whose birth rate is
increasing as that of Slavs declines.
   Mistrust of Turks has lingered in Bulgaria since 500 years of
occupation by the Ottoman Empire ended a century ago.
   Nationalist demonstrators deny pro-Zhivkov elements are behind
the protests.
   ``I am sure local party officials have had nothing to do with
this movement,'' Nelli Dimitrova, a 22-year-old university student,
told an Associated Press reporter outside Parliament.
   Viktor Orlinov said, in contrast, that demonstrators from
southern provinces told him Communist Party officials paid their
fares to the capital. Orlinov is an ethnic Turk who works for state
television in Sofia.
   ``The old apparatus of Zhivkov is still dangerous for Turks''
and party officials in the south, where many of the ethnic Turks
live, are ``much more conservative and chauvinistic'' than those in
the capital, he in a cafe.
   Demonstrations against Turkish rights have been held in Sofia
and at least seven other cities.

   The Bush administration said publicly Monday
it was not planning a naval blockade off Colombia as part of its
fight against drug trafficking, and the Colombian government said
it had received private assurances as well.
   A statement issued by the Colombian Embassy said the United
States had said it would not interfere with Colombian flag ships,
even on the high seas, without the permission of Colombian Defense
Ministry.
   Other Colombian officials had accused the United States of
moving toward a naval and air blockade, generating some confusion
over the weekend as to the respective positions of the two
governments.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
administration is considering use of the Navy but she said a
blockade is not among the options.
   ``A blockade would mean shutting down everything, and that,
obviously, is not our intention,'' she said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, traveling with President
Bush on a trip to Orlando, Fla., said that two U.S. ships had left
port and were on maneuvers in the Atlantic but that future
deployment near Colombia would depend on talks with the Barco
government. He said no agreement had been reached in preliminary
discussions and praised the Colombian government for prior
cooperation.
   Dismissing the significance of suggestions that Colombia would
reject a U.S. naval role off its coast, Fitzwater said, ``I think
the problem is we haven't had a chance here to really explore it
with them.'' He said the United States was not taking blocking
action now.
   Meanwhile, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney plans to unveil the administration's plans
for military involvement in the anti-drug battle next week.
   Bush has looked at sending U.S. warships off the Colombian coast
to help monitor and interdict narcotics traffickers, Pentagon
sources have said.
   The aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy has been chosen to lead
such an effort if the White House gives the signal to move forward,
the sources have said. However, it has been unclear whether
Colombia will agree to the plan.
   The State Department spokeswoman said there have been no more
than low level consultations on the subject of increased U.S.
efforts in the area thus far with Colombian officials.
   Ms. Tutwiler said that no interdiction effort will be carried
out without full consultations with other governments which may be
affected by such activity.
   Williams, asked about reports that two U.S. warships were on
their way to Colombia to lead an anti-drug interdiction effort,
said the USS John F. Kennedy and guided missile cruiser USS
Virginia were on ``routine training exercises.''
   He said he could not discuss any future operations the vessels
may be called upon to undertake.

   Prices on the Buenos Aires Stock
Exchange plunged an average of 53 percent in value Monday when the
market in economically wracked Argentina reopened for the first
time in more than a week.
   Meanwhile, the government said inflation in December soared 40
percent, bringing the official 1989 rise in the cost of living to a
record 4,923 percent.
   The two figures bode poorly for the government of President
Carlos Menem, which is implementing its fourth austerity plan since
Menem came to office in July and promised to sell off inefficient
state-owned industries, cut the burdensome budget deficit and
steady the national currency.
   But the austral, the national currency, slipped Monday against
the U.S. dollar to 1,650-1, down from 1,400-1 last Friday. The
austral, which replaced the inflated peso, traded at parity with
the U.S. dollar when the government of President Raul Alfonsin
introduced it in 1986.
   The sudden devaluation of the austral two weeks ago ignited the
latest price hikes of 100 percent and more in most supermarket and
department stores. Last February the austral traded at 17-1.
   January inflation is expected to be at least 40 percent also,
said Moises Iconikoff, planning secretary at the Economy Ministry.
   Analysts said the fall in stock prices, the steepest in
percentage since 1949 for the exchange's 16 major companies, was in
part because of the shortage of australs in circulation.
   Last week, the government's latest economic team decreed a
cutback in the amount of australs it would allow to be printed to
reduce supplies of the national currency and force up the value of
the austral.
   Economic indicators however continue to deteriorate. Real wages
are about half their level of a year ago, and investors continue to
put their earnings in dollars, a traditional haven for Argentines
in time of economic uncertainty. Total volume Monday on the stock
exchange, as usual, was low: about 6.3 billion australs, or $3.9
million.
   In an economy where inflation has been triple-digit in 14 of the
last 15 years, few people invest in stocks to protect their money,
and few companies count on the market to raise funds.
   The market, last open on Dec. 28, was closed two days for
national holidays, two days by bank holidays and two days by its
board of directors, which feared a sell-off due to the austral
shortage.
   The independent news agency Diarios y Noticias said the stock
market plunge of 53 percent was a ``historic session that had no
precedent.''
   The Board of Business Wholesalers in a statement said the
economic situation was ``a crisis that is almost terminal,'' and
urged the government to cut the national budget deficit.
   Inflation in 1989 was the worst Argentina has experienced since
688 percent in 1984.
   The economic convulsions are taking on political and social
dimensions.
   On Friday, telephone workers staged a demonstration in front of
the state company Entel's headquarters to oppose the government's
plan to sell the company.
   The hoped-for sale of Entel, the state carrier Aerolineas
Argentinas, the state railroad and other money-losing public
companies is the heart of Menem's plans to steady Argentina's
economic situation.
   Meanwhile, critics said the latest stabilization plan will
exacerbate an existing recession, and the low level of wages might
touch off food riots and social unrest. Such unrest convulsed this
country in May and June.
   ``The intention to combat hyperinflation with hypermonetarism
will only end in hyperrecession,'' predicted national deputy Jesus
Rodriguez, who served briefly as economy minister during the
1983-89 Radical Civic Union government of Alfonsin.
   Alfonsin's election ended the military's nearly seven-year reign.
   The military has intervened six times since 1930 to cut short
Argentine governments.

<HEAD>Winds Whip West, Snow Covers West Virginia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   High winds whipped the Northwest on Monday, blowing trucks off
highways and snapping tree limbs and power lines, and thick snow
blanketed West Virginia and northern Virginia.
   Unusually large snowflakes fell in West Virginia, the National
Weather Service reported.
   ``It's just unbelievable,'' said meterologist Dan Houser said.
``I've never seen flakes this big. I've seen some today maybe 3
inches long and an inch and a half wide.
   ``The conditions for these humongous snowflakes to develop has
to be exactly right: temperatures, moisture, wind,'' Houser said.
   Strong winds that buffeted the Northwest over the weekend
continued Monday with winds gusting to 90 mph near Pinehurst in
northern Idaho; 76 at Pendleton in northeast Oregon; 72 at Casper
in central Wyoming; 70 at Reno, Nev.; 68 at Scottsbluff in western
Nebraska; and 58 at Broomfield, Colo., north of Denver.
   The Umatilla Bridge crossing the Columbia River in northeast
Oregon was closed Monday when a truck was overturned by wind gusts.
There were numerous reports of wind damage to building, power lines
and trees in the area.
   Three cars and a truck were blown off a highway near McCammon in
southeastern Idaho. Winds blew a 4-by-4 foot hole in the roof of a
school gymnasium at Cheyenne, Wyo., Central High School. No one was
hurt.
   The National Weather Service posted warnings for gale force
winds along the northern Pacific Coast. Wind warnings were also
issued for southeast Washington state, Idaho, parts of Montana,
southeast Wyoming, northeast Colorado and the Nebraska panhandle.
   Rain was forecast for West Virginia but snow fell instead, up to
9 inches in Charleston.
   Snow advisories were posted for parts of West Virginia,
Maryland, and Virginia, Pennsylvania and central New Jersey.
   Rain stretched from much of Maryland and Delaware across the
remainder of Virginia and over northern North Carolina.
   Rain mixed with snow was scattered over north-central Minnesota.
Rain fell MOnday across northwest Utah.
   High temperature records were set Monday in Duluth, Minn. (44
degrees), Eau Claire, Wis. (46), Miami (86), Reno, Nev. (62), and
Sacramento, Calif. (66). St. Cloud, Minn., with a 46-degree
reading, broke the record of 45 set in 1900.
   The nation's low in the Lower 48 states was minus 3 in Gunnison,
Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 25
degrees at Limestone, Maine, to 86 degrees at West Palm Beach, Fla.

<HEAD>COMECON Faces Radical Overhaul or Disintegration</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   COMECON, seemingly left behind by the
reforms in Eastern Europe, will face radical changes when its
leaders meet here Tuesday in a bid to save the Soviet-dominated
trading bloc from disintegration.
   The two-day conference of the 10-nation organization, which
includes the seven Soviet bloc countries, Cuba, Mongolia and
Vietnam, is the first after last month's ouster of Romanian
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and the decline of Communist power
elsewhere in Europe.
   Founded in 1949, COMECON _ the Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance _ aimed to ensure the Marxist members' economic growth
so they could match or even outshine the West.
   But 41 years later, COMECON, largely because of the unwieldiness
of central planning and the absence of profit-based
enterpreneurship and vision, needs a radical overhaul or it will
crumble.
   Critics say COMECON is nowadays nothing more than a means for
its member states to survive the free-market evils of an
increasin7lE competitive world economic system.
   The bloc isn't held together by Socialist solidarity, they say,
but by Eastern Europoai countries' inability to earn enough hard
currency to buy energy and raw materials from anywhere but the
Soviet Union.
   Czechoslovakia and Romania have now closed ranks with Hungary's
reformers and Poland's Solidarity-led government, which have called
for an end to trade based on fixed quotas and prices, barter and a
non'chnvertible currency _ the Soviet ruble.
   ``COMECON is an obsolete organization. It has never worked and
doesn't work now,'' Romania's interim Premier Petre Roman said
Monday. ``COMECON must adjust and change if it is to continue.''
Roman is to lead the Romanian delegation in Sofia.
   Czechoslovakia's new Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus warned last
Thursday that his country would unilaterally cancel its COMECON
commitments if radical changes weren't made to the non-convertible
payments system.
   According to Hungary's Deputy Premier Peter Medgyessy, COMECON,
``organized under the myth of friendship and brotherhood, is no
longer capable of serving either the developoment of its members or
the integration of the Central and Eastern european region.''
   In an interview published Monday with the Hungarian government
daily Magyar Hirlap, Medgyessy said COMECON was born and has been a
preserved as a result of a divided Europe.
   Its archaic system ``has removed its members from the tide of
the world economy,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Hungary, in an attempt to slash its trade surplus with the
Soviet Union, announced last week it would cut its exports to the
Soviet Union by 20 percent.
   Medgyessy said barter of Soviet energy for Eastern European
goods and farm produce at pre-negotiated prices paralyzed
competition, slowed technological advances and caused consumer
goods shortages in some member states.
   Hungary has already proposed to trade with the Soviets on a
dollar basis, rather than on a ruble-only basis.
   Czechoslovakia and Poland last week already decided to establish
bilateral trade agreements and link their currencies, the koruna
and zloty, bypassing the ruble.
   Hungary envisages an initial integration of Polish, Czechoslovak
and Hungarian economies within the bloc because they are similar in
size and economic development.
   Medgyessy said free trade agreements should lead to joint trade
policies, free flow of labor and capital, the harmonization of
financial systems and the creation of a fully convertible currency
unit.
   Similar steps are being taken by the European Economic
Community, which plans to unite 12 Western economies in a single
European market after 1992.
   Although COMECON and the EC established official relations in
1988, Brussels still doesn't recognize the Moscow-based
organization as its equal because COMECON has no lawmaking body
like the Community's European Parliament, empowered to adopt policy
for member states.
   Meanwhile, COMECON secretary Vyacheslav Sychov said the trading
bloc should push for more freedom for individual members to trade
outside COMECON and for it to seek closer relations with the EC.

   Despite the Bush administration's declared war
on drugs, fewer than 10 percent of the nation's cities report
making headway in their local battles, according to a survey
released today.
   ``There's been a lot of talk about drugs coming out of
Washington, and our city leaders are now sending back a message _ a
message that it's time for Washington to get a front-line report on
what's happening and what's needed,'' Alan Beals, executive
director of the National League of Cities, said in releasing the
study.
   ``The drug issue must be a national priority, local officials
are saying, because they cannot beat it on their own,'' he said.
   Officials in 58 percent of cities surveyed said drug problems
had worsened in their communities over the past year. Another 31
percent said the magnitude of the drug problem remained the same,
while only 9 percent reported progress.

   Angered by the restoration of ethnic and
religious rights to the country's large Turkish minority, thousands
of ethnic Slavs rallied in the capital and shouted down the premier
and interior minister.
   In apparent response, Parliament President Stanko Todorov called
for a weeklong ``social forum'' to open today on ``several aspects
of the national question.''
   In an evening radio broadcast after Sunday's protests, Todorov
invited members of the public, Parliament, opposition groups and
the ruling Communist Party as well as orthodox Christian and Moslem
religious leaders.
   Some Bulgarians' anti-Turkish sentiments are fueled by their
Orthodox religion and anger over centuries of Turkish rule.

   The Veterans Affairs Department is hinting it
will try to pull out of the mobile home loan business this year,
saying a high default rate among active-duty members of the armed
services has compounded its losses.
   The program, begun in 1971 to help Vietnam veterans returning to
civilian life, is popular among junior members of the armed forces
who want to buy homes near bases for themselves and their fledgling
families.
   Personnel on active duty are considered veterans for purposes of
the program.
   More than half the 31,000 mobile home loans made since 1984 have
gone to such active-duty personnel, the VA says. During the same
period, the agency has had to pay some $147 million to lenders as a
result of 17,000 claims on mobile homes.

   Texans won't elect a new governor until
November. But they're already being treated to a two-party shootout
in the primary contests.
   State GOP leaders boast they will put the 20th century's second
Republican in the Governor's Mansion. Democrats say Republican Gov.
Bill Clements' lease on the residence is a temporary one for the
party.
   The 72-year-old Clements' decision not to seek re-election
cleared the way for well-funded, wide-open races in both parties.
Pundits predict the election could cost $50 million.
   The candidates in the March 13 primaries include a millionaire
cowboy nicknamed ``Claytie''; the 1988 Democratic National
Convention keynote speaker, State Treasurer Ann Richards; the man
who helped organize a rescue raid into Iran; and former Gov. Mark
White, hoping for a comeback.

<HEAD>Politics of Foreign Aid Changing with Events in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign aid often has been a political
headache rather than a plus because the recipients aren't American
voters. But the politics of the issue may be changing with the tide
of democracy in Eastern Europe.
   Democrats are likely to push for an expanded program of U.S. aid
to the fledgling governments and free market economies behind the
fallen Iron Curtain. They've been complaining that the Bush
administration is too timid and too stingy on that front.
   Aid to promote democratic reform is a bargain, they argue,
compared with the $160 billion a year the United States has been
spending on the defense of Western Europe.
   There are calls now for a new sort of Marshall Plan, to be
organized in cooperation with U.S. allies to assist the nations
that used to be Soviet satellites.
   There are no numbers and no details to go with the idea of a
Western combine to provide economic aid to the East, perhaps
including the Soviet Union itself. But the proposal could become a
focus of the 1990 debate on the American response to the peaceful
changes that swept the old Soviet bloc, toward political
competition and free market systems in place of communist control.
   The complaints about administration timidity will be heard again
unless President Bush forecloses them with a more dramatic aid and
economic development plan of his own.
   This year's aid program provides $533 million for Poland and
Hungary, in cash to stabilize currencies and support moves toward
private enterprise, and in insurance to promote trade and
investments. That is the first installment in a $938 million,
three-year aid package, most of it for Poland. Hungary is to
receive aid valued at $91.5 million.
   When he signed the package late last year, Bush said ``dollars
alone won't make the difference ...''
   At the same time, the president has promised that Eastern
European countries moving to overhaul their political and economic
systems can anticipate American help.
   Direct U.S. aid adds to the budget pressure that confronts both
the White House and Congress: there's no new money around. Defense
outlays may ease, but any peace dividend will come gradually, not
immediately. Shifting the old aid money in new directions would
involve reductions in aid to Israel, and that could mean trouble
with some influential interest groups and contributors, especially
for Democrats with big Jewish constituencies.
   Democrats aren't alone in arguing that the United States should
be doing more.
   ``To prescribe an economic policy toward the Soviet bloc in
present circumstances is admittedly difficult, but we are clearly
going in the wrong direction,'' says economist Herbert Stein, a
veteran of Republican administrations and a senior fellow at the
American Enterprise Institute.
   ``On the one hand, we are becoming increasingly willing to sell
high-tech equipment to a Soviet Union that is continuing to produce
armaments while the Soviet people are without soap,'' he writes in
the institute's new magazine, ``The American Enterprise.''
   ``On the other hand, we are niggardly in thinking of the
possibilities of assisting the countries, notably Poland and
Hungary, that show signs of moving in directions we could live with
more securely,'' Stein says.
   He proposes that the United States, Western European nations and
Japan cooperate to set a common economic policy toward the old
Soviet bloc.
   ``The policy should minimize our contribution to their military
power, while assisting actual movement within bloc countries toward
more consumer-oriented economies, more democracy, and a
less-aggressive foreign policy,'' Stein says.
   The Ripon Society, an organization of moderate and liberal
Republicans, recommends the creation of something called a Free
World Fund, collected from free world nations in proportion to the
size of their economies, to promote and finance Western goals. That
would include some military expenditures along with joint foreign
aid to emerging Eastern European democracies and to developing
nations elsewhere.

<TEXT>
   Questions sometimes may be more pertinent than
replies in the world of business, finance and economics, partly
because some of the so-called answers are so flawed they invite
even more questions.
   _Why has housing remained so strong?
   Sales of new homes rose 9.6 percent in November, the biggest
gain in four months. The gains came right at a time when economists
were talking about a sluggish economy, the possibility of recession
and buyer uncertainty.
   Moreover, in spite of a lot of talk about lower prices the
median price has risen and interest rates, although recently lower,
remain higher than they were several years ago. In addition, there
is supposed to be an affordability gap.
   _Why hasn't the jobless rate risen?
   At 5.3 percent, it remains relatively low compared with rates of
the past decade or more, but shouldn't it be rising? Economists say
the nation's output is slowing. And layoffs have become a regular
thing in the automotive industry.
   One possible explanation is demographic _ that the country is
running low on young replacement workers. Another is that a lot of
people who could work aren't actively looking for work, and so
aren't officially in the labor force.
   And, of course, the possibility exists that the numbers for
December will show an increase. Some economists contend that
jobless statistics seldom foretell recession _ that in that sense,
they're a lagging indicator.
   _Why haven't those continued budget deficits caused a borrowing
crisis?
   It was a very popular argument just a decade ago that continued
budget deficits were draining the pool of available funds and that
there wouldn't be enough left for business and consumers, forcing
interest rates higher.
   The deficits have continued, of course, but so has the
borrowing. A report from The Conference Board, a private-sector
researcher, states that the U.S. private sector is accumulating
debt faster than it is acquiring assets.
   Among nonfinancial corporations, the Board said, liabilities
totaled $2.7 trillion at the end of 1988, up 111 percent since the
decade of the 1980s began. But interest rates came down from
stratospheric heights in that time.
   The most likely explanation for the decline is the inflow of
foreign money, a factor that wasn't fully foreseen. But why wasn't
it?
   Meanwhile, that old argument about a shrinking pool of money,
commonplace a decade ago, hasn't been raised in years.
   _Why did it take Wall Street so long to spot the profits decline?
   The rate of gain for corporate profits has been shrinking for a
year. Based on at least one measurement, profits rose about 35
percent in 1988, about 20 percent in the 1989 first quarter and
under 10 percent in the second quarter.
   That's plenty of time to get adjusted to the direction of
profits, which worsened in the final quarter of the year.
Repeatedly, however, Wall Street analysts have referred to the
``sudden'' profits decline. Odd.
   _What ever happened to service in this, ``the service society?''
   _What ever happened to communications in this, ``the age of
communications?''
   ...Between parent and child, teacher and student, Internal
Revenue Service and taxpayer, accountant and business owner,
patient and medical billing department, technologist and user of
technology?
   This latter list is absolutely endless and the explanation for
it will still leave you asking questions or possibly sorry you
bothered to ask.

   Western nations, alarmed at a buildup of
long-range missiles in the Middle East, imposed restrictions on the
sale of sensitive equipment to Third World countries. But Iraq is
exploiting loopholes in those controls to develop a formidable
missile arsenal.

<TEXT>
   Despite efforts of industrialized nations
to curtail a missile buildup in the Middle East, Iraq is building
an advanced arms industry with help from a network of high-tech
companies in the West.
   Iraq announced in December that it had launched a 48-ton,
three-stage rocket capable of putting a satellite in space and
test-fired two surface-to-surface missiles with a range of 1,240
miles.
   U.S. officials confirmed the Dec. 5 launch, but did not say what
type of missile was used.
   Industrialized nations, alarmed at the arms buildup in the
Middle East, have curbed the sale of sensitive equipment such as
state-of-the-art computers, guidance systems, heat-resistant
materials and computer-controlled machinery to Third World
countries.
   But Iraq has exploited loopholes in the controls imposed by the
United States, Britain, West Germany, France, Italy, Canada and
Japan in the Missile Technology Control Regime of 1987.
   Iraq, Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Libya are all missile powers
now. All except Libya have weapons capable of hitting cities in
Israel.
   With superpower detente diminishing the threat of a U.S.-Soviet
conflict, analysts fear the most dangerous threat is now posed by
the spread of long-range missiles in the Third World.
   One of the key weapons in President Saddam Hussein's effort to
make Iraq the major regional power is a two-stage ballistic
missile, the Condor 2, capable of delivering nuclear or chemical
warheads.
   Iraq has been developing the Condor 2 with Argentina and Egypt
since 1984.
   ``Iraq's arms industry is quite advanced now, and Saddam is
certainly determined to build his missiles,'' said Hans-Heino
Kopietz, a Middle East analyst with London's International
Institute for Strategic Studies.
   ``From what we've been able to determine, the Iraqis are capable
of producing Condor 2, but they still lack a reliable guidance
system,'' Kopietz said in a telephone interview. ``They've been
trying to get one from the Germans.''
   Some analysts believe Iraq may be able to test-fire a Condor 2
prototype in the next year or two.
   Israel claims Iraq already has an accurate guidance system. Even
so, one Israeli source said Condor 2 was ``a long way from being
deployed.''
   The Iraqis are negotiating with Brazil's space agency for
satellite technology under a $50 million deal, analysts say.
   Ozilio Silva, director of the Brazilian agency and a former
president of Brazil's Embraer aircraft manufacturer, visited
Baghdad earlier this year and a team of Iraqi scientists was in Rio
de Janeiro last May.
   France, Iraq's second biggest arms supplier after the Soviet
Union, sent an aerospace industry team to Baghdad in November to
discuss cooperation.
   Iraq's drive to build up its own defense industry, like Iran's,
was spurred by the 8-year Persian Gulf war. It was the first
conflict in which the belligerents hammered each others' cities
with missiles.
   Until recently, many military analysts scoffed at Iraq's claims
it could produce advanced weapons systems.
   But the Iraqis unveiled a wide range of technology at the
Baghdad arms fair in April. It included the Lion of Babylon tank, a
locally assembled Soviet T-72 that included systems developed by
Iraqi engineers, and several missiles apparently modeled on Soviet
systems.
   Iraqi officials defend efforts to develop an arms industry by
citing the threat from Iran despite last year's cease-fire in the
war.
   London's Financial Times quoted Salah al-Moukhtar,
director-general of Iraq's Information Ministry, as saying: ``The
only solution to the threat to our very existence is to establish
our own military industry and provide our armed forces with Iraqi
arms.''
   Like other Iraqi officials, he declined to discuss Iraq's
purchasing network, beyond saying Baghdad will get the technology
it needs anywhere it can.
   The Iraqi network came to light in August when the U.S. Federal
Reserve found that the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale de
Lavoro had extended unauthorized credit of nearly $3 billion to
Iraq since February 1988.

   Baghdad received as much as $1.7 billion worth of credit from
the bank before the arrangement was discovered.
   The Iraqis are now demanding that the bank produce the other
$900 million promised by the Atlanta branch.
   Much of the money the Iraqis did get is believed to have been
spent on purchasing components and technology for the Condor and
other military projects.
   Much of the equipment is believed to have ended up at the
top-security Saad 16 research complex south of Baghdad where work
on Condor 2 has been carried out. The complex is also believed to
be used for chemical weapons development.
   Other research and development facilities are at Al-Anbar, west
of Baghdad, where the satellite rocket was reported launched on
Dec. 5 and at Mosul in the mountainous north. A major military
industries complex is located at Taji north of Baghdad.
   Western officials say much of the equipment was purchased
through a European-based consortium of 16 companies known as
Consen, based in Zug, Switzerland, and Monte Carlo. The group
procured missile technology and components for Iraq's Technical
Corps for Special Projects, known as Techcorp.
   Techcorp was established two years ago within the Ministry of
Industry and Military Industrialization headed by Gen. Hussein
Kamel, Saddam's son-in-law. He has overall charge of developing
Iraq's arms industry.
   Corporate records show the Iraqis also bought into European
companies. One is Britain's Matrix-Churchill, which sold the Iraqis
computer-controlled machinery worth $40 million in deals financed
by credit extended by Banca Nazionale de Lavoro.
   Another Iraqi conduit is the London-based Technology and
Development Group, which financed a buyout of Matrix-Churchill in
1987 by Al-Arabi Trading Co. of Baghdad and made an unsuccessful
bid to buy an aerospace company in Northern Ireland earlier this
year.
   A British directory of Iraqi commerce shows that all of
Al-Arabi's directors are Iraqi and include several who hold senior
posts in state companies in Iraq.
   Two, Safa Habobi and Hanan Jon, are listed as senior officials
in the state-owned Taji-based Nasr Enterprise for Mechanical
Industries, one of Matrix-Churchill's main customers.
   A British Foreign Office spokesman, who declined to be
identified, said in a telephone interview, ``We're aware that some
British companies have connections with Iraq, a country about which
we are concerned.''
   The Financial Times said other companies linked to the high-tech
flow to Iraq include Tektronix of Oregon and Hewlett-Packard of
California, as well as Italy's Snia-BPD, a Fiat subsidiary,
Sweden's Bofors, France's Sagem and West Germany's
Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm aerospace giant.
   Hewlett-Packard exported computers and other electronic
equipment to West German companies, which transferred them to Iraq
in 1985-86, the Financial Times said.
   Western intelligence agencies believe that Messerschmitt was to
supply guidance systems, Snia-BPD the rocket motors and fuel and
Sagem the inertial navigation systems. Messerschmitt and Snia deny
involvement in Condor.
   However, West German authorities began investigating a
Messerschmitt subsidiary, MBB-Transtechnica, and other German
companies several months ago amid suspicions they had violated
export regulations by shipping missile components to Iraq through
Consen.
   British Broadcasting Corp. reported in April that Messerschmitt
was ``supplying parts for a missile research laboratory in Iraq.''
   BBC television's ``Panorama'' also quoted a Messerschmitt
metalworkers union chief, Klaus Mehrens, as saying the company was
violating ``the spirit of German restrictions on arms exports even
if they got legal licenses.''
   Messerschmitt executives were quoted as saying the company had
conducted a feasibility study on the Condor project but did not
pursue it because of suspicions over how Argentina planned to use
the missile.
   Bofors has been investigated by Swedish authorities for
illegally selling weapons to Iran, Saudi Arabia, India and other
countries.
   Western military sources and diplomats in Baghdad said Iraq has
used French, Yugoslav, Italian, West German and Italian technicians
on the Condor project.
   In July, Italian police arrested eight former Snia technicians
who were indicted on charges of shipping military-related equipment
to Iraq. Last November, Italy tightened controls on arms exports to
non-NATO countries.

   Israel is attempting to sabotage Iraq's
development of the Condor 2 ballistic weapon, which threatens the
Jewish state's superiority in the Mideast arms race, according to
some military analysts in the West.
   Israeli leaders have made clear that Iraq's missile program,
combined with its arsenal of chemical weapons and its reported
effort to develop nuclear weapons, poses a serious threat.
   ``It's clearly in the Israelis' interest to try to sabotage the
Condor project and at least put it back a few years while they
develop their own new missile systems to hold their technological
edge,'' a Western military source in London said in a telephone
interview.
   Iraq has warned the Israelis not to attempt a pre-emptive strike
to knock out the Condor project.
   In 1981, the Israelis, fearing that Iraq was developing a
military nuclear weapon at a French-built reactor near Baghdad,
knocked it out in a spectacular long-range fighter-bomber raid.
   Some analysts suspect the Israelis have already taken military
action against the Condor project.
   Diplomats in Baghdad have confirmed reports of a huge explosion
in August at an Iraqi military complex at al-Iskandariyah, killing
hundreds of workers.
   Iraq claimed 19 people were killed in a fuel depot explosion in
south Baghdad about that time.
   Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born British journalist investigating
the al-Iskandariyah blast, was arrested in September on charges of
spying for Israel.
   ``It's generally considered that the Israelis were behind the
explosion,'' the military source in London said.
   The Iraqis claim Israel's Mossad secret service has assassinated
several key experts associated with Condor.
   Israeli alarm heightened last year when Saudi Arabia disclosed
it had obtained Chinese-built CSS-2 ballistic missiles with a range
of 1,600 miles.
   Western intelligence sources said there are at least 10 CSS-2s
in silos built in the as-Sulayyil region southwest of Riyadh, the
capital. Other reports say the Saudis have 28 CSS-2s.
   Israel is developing its own ballistic missile, the Jericho II,
with a range of 800 miles and capable of carrying a nuclear warhead.
   U.S. officials said in October that Israel is cooperating with
South Africa on the Jericho II and last year test-fired one of the
medium-range weapons at the Armaston testing range on the Indian
Ocean near Cape Town.
   The Israelis are also reported to be working on an anti-missile
missile, the Arrow, with technology adapted from the U.S. ``Star
Wars'' program. Iraq claims it is also working on an anti-missile
missile.
   So far, no state in the region has the ability to shoot down
missiles.
   The Israelis last year launched a satellite, Ofek-1, for what
was officially described as ``scientific studies.'' But military
experts believe the Israelis want to develop a military spy
satellite that could be linked to the anti-missile program.

   Dogs have long been used for tracking fugitives
or sniffing out marijuana and other drugs. Now arson investigators
have found they have an uncanny ability for finding traces of
gasoline or some other inflammable material at the scene of a
suspicious fire.

   Only one out of 100 dogs makes the grade in this
elite K-9 corps. Pedigrees count for naught. Most of them have been
rescued from the pound.
   These dogs easily work for up to six hours in frigid
temperatures, sniffing charred debris, even through ice and water.
Park Avenue dogs, with their little cold-weather outfits for
15-minute walks, need not apply.
   The top requirement for these dogs is to have the will and
stamina to play all day long, because for them, it is a game.
   For arson investigators, it is serious business.
   The investigators credit these dogs with helping bring in
first-degree murder indictments, saving hundreds of man-hours and
thousands of tax dollars, and they say their true potential is
still unknown.
   They are officially called Accelerant Detection Dogs and the
program is one of the newest ways to use man's best friend.
Trainers estimate there are only about two dozen trained dogs in
about a dozen states thus far.
   The dogs are trained to take the investigator to the spot where
an arsonist poured gasoline, alcohol, fingernail polish remover or
some other inflammable liquid.
   The dogs must find all of the spots where the accelerants were
poured, which is why trainers stress the importance of the dog's
innate play drive. After he is rewarded for the first find, he's
called upon to keep looking until he exhausts all possible sites.
   One of the reasons investigators collect multiple samples is
that the dogs are better than the sophisticated equipment back at
the laboratory. The dogs, they think, can sniff out parts per
trillion. The best science can do is parts per million. Handlers
are often sure their dogs are correct, but the equipment cannot
corroborate it.
   The dogs can also differentiate between accelerants and similar
chemical gases normally found at a fire scene when items such as
plastic have burned. The field equipment often gives false positive
readings. The dogs don't.
   ``He doesn't make mistakes,'' says Michael E. Knowlton, a New
York state arson investigator who has a 90-pound yellow Labrador
retriever named Buddy. New York state has two dogs, available to
every city and county.
   In Maryland, the second state in the country to have an
arson-sniffing dog, Barney was instrumental in the first-degree
murder indictments of an arsonist in the deaths of three children.
   Barney, a 123-pound black Labrador, picked the suspect out of a
lineup. Four men plus the suspect were standing in a room when John
Farrell, Barney's handler, opened the door and sent the big dog in.
Barney roamed around, then sat down directly in front of the
suspect. All of the dogs sit when they make a positive
identification. Some, like Barney, will go a step further.
   ``Show me,'' commanded Farrell. Barney put his nose on the man's
shoes.
   The FBI lab confirmed the dog's findings: kerosene on the shoes.
Barney had earlier identified the spots where kerosene had been
poured at the fire site.
   The man goes to trial in late March.
   Barney and John Farrell, chief of operations in the Arson K-9
Unit in Baltimore, have traveled up and down the East Coast helping
states without arson-sniffing dogs of their own.
   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in Connecticut,
along with the Connecticut State Police, trained the first arson
sniffing dog.
   Farrell, who had trained hunting dogs for more than 40 years,
heard about the program and went up to Connecticut to investigate.
He could not get government funds when he got back to Maryland.
   ``In frustration, I trained my own dog to see if I could do what
I saw. I wanted to prove that it worked,'' says Farrell, who has
almost 25 years of service in the Maryland state fire marshal's
office.
   Thanks to the success of Barney, the nation's second arson dog,
Maryland now has six arson dogs.
   New Jersey Police Sgt. Dennis McSweeny, a K-9 instructor for
many years, has trained many of the dogs for other states. The two
dogs working for New York state, Buddy and Hershey, were trained by
McSweeny in a 10-week course in Atlantic City, N.J.
   McSweeny and Farrell know of arson dogs in North and South
Carolina, Maine, Florida, Washington, Iowa and Kansas, as well as
New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland.

   Although Labradors have predominated, any breed will do. But the
individual dog has to be special.
   ``Only five out of 500 dogs will make it through the course,''
says McSweeny. ``They must have a very sociable temperament and an
extremely strong play drive. The ones that wash out usually get
bored and won't keep going. The dog has to want to play this game
over and over.''
   Like all good animal acts, this one is based on the dog's
natural instinct to fetch and retrieve, one of the reasons that
Labs and other hunting dogs have predominated. The dog is imprinted
with the scent of various accelerants from the four basic groups,
and when he is brought to the fire scene, he essentially is
retrieving that scent.
   The dogs first receive basic obedience training as well as
physical conditioning. They climb stairs, fire escapes, hurdle over
barriers, learn to hop from one boat to another at sea, ride in a
helicopter, and get hoisted up 75 feet in an aerial bucket. All
with aplomb or it doesn't count.
   ``The dog must be ready to go right to work when he gets to the
scene and we may have to helicopter him in, or have him on a fire
escape,'' Knowlton says. ``He must be able to do these things
without getting flustered.''
   The even-tempered Lab is perfect and his endurance and ability
to withstand cold are also assets. However, there is an English
springer spaniel named Ty in Iowa City, a few German shepherds, one
mutt, a golden retriever, and a German short-haired pointer among
this emerging band of firefighters.
   There are no bloodhounds.
   ``Bloodhounds are the dumbest animals in the world,'' offers
McSweeny. ``We've trained bloodhounds who couldn't find their food
dish.''
   When Knowlton took the course from McSweeny, he went through
four other dogs that washed out before he was paired with Buddy.
   ``It took four weeks for Buddy to learn and it took me six weeks
to learn to read him,'' Knowlton says.
   Knowlton says that when he is working Buddy in extremely cold
weather, he puts him back in the car to warm up after six hours of
sniffing through the ice that forms as firefighters put out the
blaze.
   Knowlton, 38, who is divorced, says his three daughters love
Buddy and always want to play ``Find the Cause.''
   Buddy, however, is never allowed to chase rabbits, squirrels,
cats or other dogs.
   After a demonstration of Buddy's prowess at the New York State
Fire Academy on Randall's Island, Buddy found a plank of wood under
the light snow and brought it back for Knowlton to toss. Buddy
didn't tire of the game, but when it was time to go, Knowlton
sharply said no and Buddy dropped the plank and readily reported
for duty, the duty being a six-hour drive to Watertown, N.Y., to
help investigate a major fire in which three people died in a
senior citizens' center.
   Knowlton says he has to watch out for Buddy. He won't let the
dog get hurt. At one fire scene, red and blue chemicals were still
oozing on the surface when Knowlton and Buddy arrived.
   ``I didn't know what that stuff was,'' says Knowlton. ``I
wouldn't let Buddy go in until after it dried.''
   The dog in Iowa City is decked out with rubber boots, which he
hates, when he is called upon to work in such a situation.
   The dogs have shown time and time again they are better than the
laboratories, but so far there has been no court case in which it
was the dog's word against the suspect's.
   McSweeny doesn't think that will ever happen.
   ``The attorneys will never allow one of these dogs in a
courtroom,'' he says. ``They would demonstrate to a jury what they
can do and that would be that. What's the attorney going to say to
discredit the dog?''
   Knowlton has testified twice before a grand jury, describing
Buddy's work. Buddy's feats are also videotaped should they be
needed in a courtroom.
   In tests, trainers have taken pieces of wood, set two on fire
with accelerants and let the others burn naturally. Time after time
the dogs picked out the pieces of charred wood that held traces of
the accelerant. At first, the laboratories could confirm it.
Eventually, the trace got too light for science, but not for the
dogs. They still knew which pieces of wood were set on fire by the
accelerants, leading investigators to believe they are scenting in
the parts per trillion range.
   The trainers say the dog's sense of smell is roughly 100 times
better than man's. With good reason. Humans have 5 million cells
devoted to the sense of smell. Dogs have 220 million.

   The legend of the Greek shipping tycoons began
earlier this century with the ``sea wolves,'' sea captains who
acquired vast fleets, dynamic magnates with business savvy and a
gambler's touch. Their lives and loves were chronicled on the front
pages of the world press. Now a new breed is at the helm,
introducing modern business practices, and much of the adventure
has been lost.

<DATELINE>PIRAEUS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They were the Golden Greeks, fiercely
independent men who controlled the world's shipping, built lush
island paradises and married society's most glamorous women.
   Aristotle Onassis, Stavros Niarchos and their contemporaries are
still revered in Piraeus, base of the powerful Greek shipping
industry. But today a new tycoon is succeeding them: the young
businessman who shuns publicity and knows computers as well as
compasses.
   ``Twenty years ago, a shipowner was treated like a god,'' said
Diamantis Diamantides, who controls 25 ships. ``Now he's a simple
person.''
   The Greek shipping tradition is thousands of years old, a
product of the country's entrepreneurial talent and its kinship
with the sea, which is within 50 miles of almost any part of Greece.
   The legend of the Greek tycoon began earlier this century with
the ``sea wolves,'' sea captains who acquired fleets. It reached
its personification in Niarchos and Onassis, volatile, dynamic
magnates with business savvy and a gambler's touch, whose lives and
loves were chronicled on the front pages of the world press.
   Many of the newer managers have maintained their predecessors'
passion for the sea and their strong preference for family-run
firms. But they are increasingly making longer-term investments,
imposing modern business practices and buying newer, high-tech
ships.
   ``We're tending toward structured companies in corporate form as
opposed to personality-driven, Onassis-type companies,'' said
Emmanuel A. Vordonis, director of Thenamaris Ships Management Inc.
   Until recently, Greeks owned the world's largest merchant fleet.
The Japanese are now No. 1 but Greece is close behind, with 82
million tons of cargo-carrying capacity, according to the
authoritative shipping magazine Naftiliaki.
   Some of the change of style in Greek shipowning is due to the
crisis that hit the industry from 1975 to 1987, stemming from
overbuilding of ships and competitive freight-rate cutting at a
time of stagnating world trade. This bustling port near Athens is
still haunted by memories of proud shipowners losing their vessels
to creditors.
   Diamantides, 42, who began buying ships in 1975 after working in
shipping offices, says old-time magnates could get bank loans on
the strength of their names.
   ``Now you have to convince them with your figures,'' he said.
   Business practices also have changed with the infusion of a
different kind of shipowner _ either entrepreneurs from industry or
construction attracted by a potential fortune, or the children of
traditional shipowners, who have received advanced degrees in
business or engineering at British or American universities.
   ``The new generation of managers has a different investment
approach,'' said Dimitri Krondiras, the local director of Citibank,
the major lender for Greek ship purchases. ``This new generation
perceives that investment in shipping is high-risk.''
   Because of that gamble, some shipowners have diversified into
oil, banking or hotel chains. Others are trying to cater more to
the changing market, purchasing newer, more customized ships.
   A few shipowners are even beginning to raise money by opening
their companies to outside investment and floating shares on the
stock market _previously ``a kind of heresy in Greek shipowning,''
says George Anastassopoulos, the former head of the Transport
Commission in the European Parliament.
   One example of the new Greek tycoon is Thanasis Martinos, whose
family founded Thenamaris. Hailed as the ``Mozart of shipping'' for
his precociousness, Martinos entered the business as a teen-ager
when his mother and her brothers _ a shipping lawyer and a sea
captain _ bought their first ship.
   Martinos worked with the firm while studying economics in
London. Now 40, he and his two brothers head Thenamaris, which runs
55 ships itself and manages about 20 for other people.
   Vordonis, the director of the firm, says the older generation
``had the risk approach, the hard-work approach, the
entrepreneurial approach to bringing resources together that were
difficult to bring together.''
   Now, he says, shipowners rely on high-speed information relayed
by computers, tight cost control and a team approach.
   Where old-style magnates used to make most decisions, sometimes
screaming down cowering subordinates, the modern entrepreneurs are
trying to attract and rely on technical experts to keep up with a
fast-moving, efficient, more high-tech field.
   ``In order to achieve, you need technology, modern management
techniques,'' Vordonis says. ``You go into how to manage people.''
   A glance at the Thenamaris offices illustrates the change.
Unlike the traditional rough-and-tumble offices tucked along the
Piraeus waterfront, Thenamaris is a gleaming, glass-and-concrete
ring in a lush coastal suburb. Sunlight pours into an airy core;
water trickles through leafy plants in a central atrium.
   ``We have round tables, where everyone feels equal. We tried to
make it as friendly as possible,'' Vordonis says. ``In addition to
achieving efficiency, you must have people working in a high tone.''
   In addition to keeping a lower profile at the office, the new
tycoons avoid publicity in their private lives. Gone are the days
when Niarchos and Onassis competed in the public eye, building
ever-bigger yachts and purchasing islands they turned into
paradises with imported trees and exotic birds.
   Onassis dominated gossip columns through his affair with opera
singer Maria Callas and later marriage to Jacqueline Kennedy, while
Niarchos married, among others, Charlotte Ford, daughter of
carmaker Henry Ford.
   Today's shipowners keep elegant villas with swimming pools in
Athens' northern suburbs and vacation getaways on the Greek
islands, as well as homes in London, Switzerland or Monte Carlo.
   But they are content to stay out of the spotlight. Some say a
high profile would hurt their efforts to emphasize a team approach
in their businesses.
   Whether the new tycoons will achieve the success of their
predecessors is still an open question.
   Many firms are still run by the older generation, with their
sons or daughters waiting in the wings to test newer business
strategies.
   And while the younger managers may have more sophisticated
economic approaches, shipowning is still highly risky and dependent
on many outside factors, such as wars and the price of oil.
   Anastassopoulos says the new shipping executives go to the best
schools and are better prepared than their predecessors. But, he
adds, ``Whether they will be as intelligent and adventurous as
their fathers remains to be seen.''

   It's an obscure magazine offering reviews of
thousands of other obscure magazines. Factsheet Five is the
handiwork of Michael Gunderloy, who set aside his chemical
engineering degree to devote full time to publishing his directory
of offbeat publications.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of magazines are piled
throughout Michael Gunderloy's home, but don't ask him to pull out
a copy of Time or Newsweek or Reader's Digest. They're too
conventional.
   However, he'll gladly produce American Window Cleaner, a trade
journal for those who squeegee for a living.
   Or, Gunderloy can find his copy of Civilian Defense: News &amp;
Opinion, a newsletter put out by those who believe in creating a
national defense by training Americans in non-violent
non-cooperation with any invader.
   There's always Chokehold, a wrestling magazine. Daily Cow is a
humor magazine written from the animal's point of view. And
Frostbite Falls Far-Flung Flier features the cartoon characters
Rocky and Bullwinkle.
   ``It has happened that the Rensselaer post office has sent me
stuff just because it looks flaky and they don't know who else to
send it to,'' says Gunderloy, a 30-year-old with black hair tied in
a ponytail.
   Gunderloy collects the magazines for his own journal, Factsheet
Five, the bible of the underground, or alternative press. Five
times a year, Factsheet Five contains reviews of as many of this
country's estimated 6,000 self-published magazines as Gunderloy can
get his hands on.
   Anyone with access to a copier can theoretically become a
publisher, and many people do. Once thought the province of 1960s
radicals plotting campus takeovers, the alternative press is
flourishing in the 1980s, Gunderloy says.
   He calls them ``zines.'' That's short for fanzines. But although
many publications show slavish devotion to certain rock bands,
others cover far different territories in politics and the arts.
   Gunderloy has set aside his chemical engineering degree to give
his full energies to his marginally profitable newsletter. His
wife, a physics professor, helps pay the bills.
   He chronicles publications with names like Filth, The Lame
Monkey Manifesto, Nuclear Mutinous Dogs and The Occasional Journal
of Nothing in Particular with obsessive detail, in print so small
it's almost painful to read.
   Zines range in size from slick music publications like Maximum
Rock 'n' Roll and Flip Side, with 15,000 circulations, to The
Colleen Scene, a newsletter put out by a California woman with a
circulation of one.
   ``She types it on demand _ everyone gets an original copy,''
Gunderloy says. ``It's mostly rambling about what she did that day
and what she heard on the radio.''
   Some zine culture eventually goes mainstream. Backstreets is a
widely quoted magazine devoted to Bruce Springsteen and its
publisher has written a book on the Boss. Science fiction zines are
a fertile ground for talent, producing such mainstream talent as
writer Robert Silverberg.
   Music zines routinely trumpet bands, such as the heavy metal
favorites Metallica, long before they become popular.
   ``There is a lot of talent out there _ in some cases waiting to
be discovered and in some cases being discovered,'' Gunderloy says.
   Other zine culture will probably remain underground.
   The magazine Ripping Headaches, with interviews with obscure
heavy metal rockers Fatal Blessing, Devastation and Vomit, is not
likely to make too many newsstands.
   Cartoonists use the zines as a proving ground. Many, Gunderloy
says, are mainly interested in proving how shocking they can be.
Gunderloy suspects the controversy over Robert Mapplethorpe's
government-sponsored homosexual art caused many publications to
push the boundaries of obscenity as far as possible.
   Mapplethorpe's work, he says, ``would be far too tame for a lot
of people to put into their magazines. This sort of shock therapy
has gotten to the point of absurdity.''
   In a strange way, Gunderloy says, the magazines he gets tell him
a lot about what's going on in the country.
   Dozens of new publications provide evidence of an upsurge in
environmentalism, he says. The country's conservative drift through
the '80s was obvious in several alternative college newspapers.
   ``I get the latest news from people that might not have made it
into The New York Times _ which I don't have time to read,'' he
says.
   Gunderloy's own press run is nearly 7,000 per issue. He'll list
the magazine of anyone who sends him a copy and is available by
phone.
   While many zines try to entertain, others try to inform, albeit
in very specialized fields. The Mandocrucian's Digest is about
people who play the mandolin. Suds 'n' Stuff is the newsletter of
Beer Drinkers International, while Jewish Vegetarians of North
America is self-explanatory.
   Gunderloy says he's impressed with the quality of much of what
he gets, although ``I've also gotten things from people who are
probably certifiably nuts.''
   He says he once gave a bad review to a newsletter put out by a
man who claimed to be psychically responsible for the auto accident
that killed singer Harry Chapin.
   ``He wrote back a letter suggesting I could be made to slip in
the shower and break an ankle,'' he says.
   Factsheet Five also publishes poetry reviews and keeps track of
``cassette culture,'' people who record and distribute their own
music.
   Gunderloy wants eventually to publish Factsheet Five, which
began as a two-page mimeographed sheet and now stretches beyond 100
pages, every two months. He does it largely himself, sitting behind
a personal computer and sifting through his mail.
   ``These people are out there because they're really interested
in it, they don't care about making a buck,'' he says. ``That's
what excites me. It's seeing something that's well done.''

   She is a thanatologist, in plain talk a death
counselor. She works in prison, dealing with people who have been
sentenced to die, by nature, not the courts. AIDS is a tortured way
to die, and hers is a tortured job, guiding the doomed through
their last days behind prison walls.

   AIDS may be the loneliest disease in the
world and Donalyn Gross says there is probably no lonelier place
than prison to die of it, away from family and friends and shunned
by other inmates.
   Since Gross began work at Somers State Prison two years ago as a
thanatologist counseling inmates with AIDS, she has watched 18 of
her patients succumb to the disease.
   ``Dying of AIDS on the outside is one thing, but dying in
prison, it's tough. It's really tough,'' Gross says.
   Gross, who believes she is the only death counselor in a U.S.
correctional facility, spends her days in the prison's chronic
ward, otherwise known as the AIDS ward, with rapists, murderers and
drug dealers. She laughs, cries and shares secrets with them,
trying to make death a little less frightening.
   State prison officials estimate about 15 percent of the state's
inmates carry the AIDS virus, according to Correction Department
spokesman Bill Flower.
   Gross, a resident of Springfield, Mass., got her first exposure
working with the dying when she volunteered at a nursing home at
age 15.
   ``I remember a lot of people dying alone with no families,'' she
says, recalling one woman who would sit alone in her wheelchair day
after day with no visitors.
   When the woman died, Gross went to her funeral and was stunned
to find a church full of mourners. The woman did, in fact, have
family and friends _ they just weren't with her at the end.
   Gross has discovered it's even more true of inmates at Somers,
Connecticut's only maximum-security prison. Many of them were
abandoned by their families before they became sick, but when the
symptoms of AIDS become pronounced, even fewer people want to visit
them.
   While the fear of contracting AIDS has made others shy away from
AIDS patients, Gross says it was acquired immune deficiency
syndrome that drew her to Somers in the first place.
   ``I'd worked with cancer patients for 12 years, and when AIDS
came along I knew I wanted to get involved,'' she says. ``I looked
all over the place, and then someone suggested the prisons.''
   Massachusetts prison officials weren't responsive to the idea,
but Connecticut officials were willing to give her a try at Somers,
just over the state line where she lives.
   She started as a volunteer at Somers, then was given a contract.
She now spends five days a week at the prison and is on call at all
times.
   As devastating as cancer is, Gross says AIDS is worse: ``Cancer
seems so much gentler than AIDS.''
   Gross says an inmate enters the chronic ward on the brink of
death. When he gets really bad, he's taken to Saint Francis
Hospital and Medical Center in Hartford. After intense treatment he
returns, thinner and weaker but still alive, waiting for the next
onslaught.
   ``The hard thing with something like AIDS is that it can go on
for so long,'' Gross says.
   Some inmates are so afraid of the AIDS stigma that they deny
they're sick, even at the risk of not getting the new medical
treatments known to help AIDS patients.
   On her way to and through the ward, guards and inmates alike
smile and wave.
   Upstairs, five inmates were living in the nine-bed ward. Three
were watching a sitcom on television. Two lay in bed on the other
end of the room, uninterested.
   One, not unlike others Gross has worked with, collects news
articles on AIDS and devours all the literature he can find on the
disease. Gross helps, bringing in articles and videotapes.
   Recently she brought in a tape about the giant AIDS quilt, for
which people from all over the country have sewn panels in memory
of someone they loved and lost to the disease. The video depressed
some of the inmates, but they discussed it and felt better in the
end.
   Gross tries to help the inmates come to terms with impending
death without overwhelming them with gloom. ``We'll discuss
funerals, but I won't push it.''
   Prison policy prevents inmates from being interviewed, but a
note Gross received from an inmate after he had been rushed to
Saint Francis Hospital provided a glimpse into what her friendship
means to them.
   ``Stay here with me,'' he wrote. ``I'm scared and lonely.''
   The petite, 39-year-old redhead says she is not frightened by
working with criminals.
   ``People always say, `Aren't you afraid?''' she says. ``Some of
the guys, I don't even know what they're in here for. I'm not here
to judge. I'm here to give them some compassion.''
   Nor is she worried about getting AIDS herself.
   ``I sit on the bed and I give them back rubs,'' Gross says. ``I
never wear a mask. I don't like to do that. It's like having the
plague.
   ``If I have a cut on my hand and I'm going to give someone a
back rub, I'll put a Band-Aid on it. If I'm going to get it, I'm
going to get it.''
   Gross credits Somers for being progressive enough to allow her
to work with its dying inmates, and Somers credits Gross for taking
on the task.
   ``It is an extremely good program and one that is beneficial to
the clients that she serves in ways that I can't even begin to
imagine,'' says the Correction Department's Flower. ``It's a
humanitarian program, a compassionate program and worthwhile.''
   Although new inmates at Somers get a lecture about AIDS and how
it is spread, Gross says many are too macho to listen. She thinks
the number of dying inmates will only increase, particularly as
prisons become more overcrowded.
   Gross thinks more death counselors could make the situation
easier. With that in mind, she has written prison officials across
the country to urge them to come up with money for such positions.
   In the meantime, she'll continue offering solace to the dying.
   ``When somebody's dying, I spend as much time with them as I
can,'' she says. ``When someone dies, I feel sad because I got
close to that person, but I feel good because I know I did what I
could. And then I've got to get up and go on to the next person.
   ``I love my guys.''

   He's a lifelong Mormon who writes about the
people he knows best, fellow members of the Church of Jesus Christ
of Latter-day Saints. Neal Chandler concedes he has a limited
audience, Mormon attitudes toward fiction being what they are, and
non-Mormons can't relate to what he's writing about. But profit is
not his motive.

   Neal Chandler knows he won't get rich or
famous writing stories about Mormons. For one thing, he says, most
Mormons don't read fiction.
   But Chandler gets his reward in the winces or belly laughs of
recognition he elicits from the few who do.
   ``I've been told by many people that I'm wasting time and talent
on Mormon culture,'' says Chandler, coordinator of the creative
writing program at Cleveland State University in Ohio.
   Chandler, a lifelong Mormon, doesn't agree.
   ``It's my resource, and it's a rich one,'' he says. ``And to
turn away from it for marketing reasons seems just strange to me. I
cannot even conceive of doing it. I know a great deal about
Mormonism and I care a great deal about these things, these
people.''
   Chandler's first book, a collection of 15 stories titled
``Benediction,'' was published recently by the University of Utah
Press as part of its Mormon studies series.
   Some of the story titles betray Chandler's aim to illuminate _
often with humor _ what he describes as ``that middle place between
us and the larger American culture.'' They include ``The
Righteousness Hall of Fame,'' ``Mormon Tabernacle Blues'' and ``The
Only Divinely Authorized Plan for Financial Success in This Life or
the Next.''
   In the latter, a Mormon woman justifies involvement in a pyramid
scheme by pointing out the pyramid on the back of a dollar bill as
signifying ``Christian capitalism'' mandated by the Founding
Fathers.
   After Chandler's story ``Benediction'' was published in a Mormon
journal in 1985, he received a call late at night from a man he
barely knew who said he'd just read the story. His wife was now
reading it, the man said, and she ``was laughing so hard she wet
her pants.''
   ``It doesn't strike non-Mormons the same way, because they have
no way of relating to it,'' Chandler says.
   Chandler realizes his audience will be narrow because only a
small percentage of the world's 6.7 million Mormons are
intellectuals, and only a fraction of those read fiction.
   ``Mormons, even intellectual Mormons, are so concerned about
being taken seriously that they take themselves terribly
seriously,'' Chandler says. ``And fiction seems to most of them to
violate that tendency. Even among people who read and are educated,
it doesn't seem somehow to be respectable.''
   For example, Chandler says, people come up to him and say,
``Hey, I read your article.'' That used to strike him as odd. No
more.
   ``I've just come to the conclusion that `story' _ while I'm sure
it is a word that is included in their vocabulary _ is not somehow
emotionally includable,'' he says. ``The term that seems
respectable is `article'.''
   Chandler, 47, does not have to rely on flights of fancy for his
glimpses of Mormon life in the late 20th century. He was born and
raised a Mormon in Salt Lake City. He served a 2{-year church
mission in northern Germany and has lived mostly outside Utah since.
   ``I think the truth is that when the stories seem the most
outrageous, they are most likely to be grounded in real
experience,'' says Chandler, the Sunday School superintendent in
his Shaker Heights, Ohio, congregation.
   He believes that since the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints shed its polygamist roots and began, after World War II, to
gain respectability, its members have become increasingly confused
about who they are as they embrace non-Mormon ideals in business
and other fields.
   Mormons, he says, ``like to think of themselves as the
quintessential Americans. But I think in the long term we can't be
that and preserve ourselves as the religiously motivated, energized
and guided culture that we need to be.''
   Chandler is careful to draw a distinction between Utah Mormons
with pioneer ancestry and Mormons elsewhere. The former, he says,
``sort of sense themselves as a kind of Mormon nobility and
aristocracy. When they go out to the rest of the church they go out
as ambassadors in a sense.
   ``And so there is in the mission field a sense of inferiority
against that kind of background.''
   Chandler plans other writing projects, not all of them
Mormon-related, including a political novel and another book of
stories. But his most ambitious work will be a novel set in central
Utah for which he will draw on historical, mythical and folklore
sources.

   After a year of making movies on the road,
actress Pamela Reed was eager to star in her first television
series.
   In NBC's ``Grand,'' she plays Janice Pasetti, a mother with a
young daughter who is deserted by her husband.
   ``I hadn't been able to spend much time with my husband,'' says
Reed, who married director Sandy Smolan three years ago after
working with him on ``Rachel River.''
   ``I started looking into television. I was interested in the
half-hour comedy format. Then `Grand' came along and I was
intrigued by the character. I liked the idea that she was funny but
also serious. I like it that she has contact with everyone in the
cast and is not confined to just one area.''
   In the series, Pasetti is forced to find work as a housekeeper
because she has no skills. She works for Harris Weldon (John
Randolph), the 70-year-old patriarch of Grand, Pa. He owns the
piano factory, which is losing out to foreign keyboard imports.
   The show, from the Carsey-Werner Co.'s hit factory, has taken up
residence behind ``Cheers'' on Thursday night displacing ``Dear
John.'' Two other Carsey-Werner shows, ``The Cosby Show'' and ``A
Different World,'' precede it. The production company also makes
ABC's ``Roseanne.''
   Reed has been busy in movies roles, including such films as
``The Right Stuff,'' ``Young Doctors in Love,'' ``Eyewitness'' and
``Melvin and Howard.'' Upcoming feature films are ``Cadillac Man''
with Robin Williams and ``Chattahoochie'' with Gary Oldman and
Dennis Hopper.
   She has starred in several TV movies and was Ernest Hemingway's
last wife, Mary, in the miniseries ``Hemingway.'' She has appeared
extensively on Broadway and off-Broadway.
   Last year she won an ACE Award for cable-TV productions as a
result of her role as the campaign manager in ``Tanner 88'' for
Home Box Office. She also appears in the Hallmark Hall of Fame
presentation ``Caroline'' coming up on CBS.
   ``When I talked to the `Grand' producers I found out TV shows
have a hiatus of four months,'' she says. ``That's important to me
because I can do a film. Deciding to do it took me a long, long
time. You have to be prepared to commit for five years, whether the
show goes for five minutes or five years.
   ``Then I got together with Michael McKean and the creator
Michael Leeson, who also wrote the movie `The War of the Roses.' We
worked on scenes and it reminded me of working in the theater. It
made me want to do it. You don't come in at 6 a.m. and work on one
scene all morning like you do on a film. You come in in old clothes
and work on the text. It's really about text, and for an actor
that's heaven.''
   Reed was also pleased that Peter Hunt, who runs the Williamstown
Theater in Massachusetts, is the director.
   Janice Pasetti is a woman who got married right out of high
school and thought it would last forever. She'd been married seven
or eight years when her husband went out for cigarettes and never
came back. She's unskilled and her resourcefulness is challenged to
make a living.
   ``Her relationship with her teen-age daughter is telling because
children ask questions adults have to answer,'' Reed says.
``Questions you may not ask yourself. She's a person who cleans
other people's houses. People my own age. She has to keep it a
business relationship.''
   Reed was born in Tacoma, Wash., but at the age of 11 her family
moved to Maryland when her father became an executive of the
International Laborers Union. At 18, she returned to attend
Washington State University.
   She's lived in New York the past 14 years.
   ``Caroline,'' due on CBS later this season, stars Stephanie
Zimbalist in the title role. Reed and George Grizzard play the
parents of two children who are surprised when Caroline, a daughter
from his first marriage thought to be dead, turns up. The 1952
period piece, filmed in Georgia, also stars Patricia Neal and
Dorothy McGuire.
   In several films Reed has played real people. She was Trudy
Cooper, the wife of astronaut Gordon Cooper, in ``The Right
Stuff.'' In ``Melvin and Howard'' she was Bonnie Dummar, whose
husband Melvin Dummar contended Howard Hughes left part of his
fortune to Dummar.
   ``We were shooting `Melvin and Howard' in Utah when Jonathan
Demme, the director, said Bonnie Dummar was outside,'' Reed says.
``I said, `I'm Bonnie Dummar. After I finish this picture, then she
can be Bonnie Dummar again.'''

   If it's ``Love Letters,'' it must be Lynn
Redgrave. Or was it Colleen Dewhurst, Elaine Stritch, Swoosie Kurtz
or Stockard Channing? And was she joined by Richard Thomas, Jason
Robards, Christopher Reeve or Cliff Robertson?
   A different cast starred each week in the A.R. Gurney play on
and off-Broadway, an idea its producers hope to continue as the
two-character comedy-drama multiplies in other productions across
the country and perhaps heads for London later this year.
   More than 60 performers appeared in the play during its New York
run that began last Valentine's Day at a special benefit
performance starring Kathleen Turner and John Rubinstein and ends
today after a 3-month engagement at Broadway's Edison Theater. In
between there were twice-weekly performances at the Promenade
Theater off-Broadway that later became eight shows a week before
the move to the Edison.
   But it's not the end for the play, which looks at a man and
woman _ two upper-class WASPs _ through their letters to each other
from the ages of 7 until they are about 60.
   _A company is now playing in San Francisco, where the actors
rotate every two weeks. Among the performers playing there have
been Polly Bergen, Robert Vaughn, Alexis Smith and Fritz Weaver.
   _Another troupe opens in Boston on Feb. 20 for seven weeks with
seven different casts.
   _Also in February, ``Love Letters'' will be performed Sundays
and Mondays at the Pasadena Playhouse in California with a regular
run scheduled to start in a Los Angeles theater in mid-March.
   _A Chicago company is also under discussion, as is a national
tour in the fall. Richard Frankel, who produced the play with Roger
L. Stevens, Thomas Viertel and Steven Baruch, describes that as
unique.
   ``We're going to be booking the show into normal Broadway road
houses,'' he says. ``For example, we might do two weeks at the
Kennedy Center or two weeks in Philadelphia or a week in Lexington,
Ky., but they won't necessarily be continuous, and they might be
overlapping, and they almost certainly will be with different
actors.''
   It would be an unconventional tour for an unconventional play
that playwright Gurney insists must be read, not acted, by its
stars.
   ``These are two lovers who communicate through their letters,''
Gurney says. ``They are both liberated and trapped in their own
mail. When they get together physically, with one exception, it's
normally bad. The letters are the windows through which they wave
at each other.''
   The play can be performed almost anywhere. It requires no
scenery and only a few props _ a table, two chairs, two small
lecterns, a water pitcher and two glasses. The actors even wear
their own clothes.
   ``Love Letters'' was first done at the New York Public Library
in March 1988 with Holland Taylor and Gurney himself reading the
play.
   ``I was supposed to make a speech at the library but told them I
wanted to do the play instead,'' he recalls. ``Since it runs longer
than a speech, I broke it into two parts and told everybody they
could leave if they wanted to. Nobody seemed to want to, so I knew
the play interested people.''
   If the show has a minimum of props, it has required a maximum of
effort behind the scenes to cast each week.
   ``The hardest part of the New York production was that it was
like an opening every week,'' says Frankel. Linda Wright works for
Frankel as an assistant but she took over casting chores for the
New York run as well as the out-of-town assignments.
   ``The most difficult thing is getting the right people
together,'' she says. ``You can't do it with a much older man and a
much younger woman. These people supposedly went to school
together.''
   Originally, most of the New York casts were in their early 40s
and stretched into their 50s. But it has been done successfully by
younger actors such as Timothy Hutton and Elizabeth McGovern.
   The actors all got the same amount of rehearsal time, one
three-hour afternoon session in Frankel's office with director John
Tillinger going over the play. Tillinger read through the play with
the newcomers each week.
   ``The two stars don't have approval of their other halves,''
Frankel says. ``Sometimes we start with a pair. We approach them
both at the same time. Sometimes we'll talk to one person, and they
will suggest partners. It's a friendly negotiation process.''
   John Rubinstein had never met Stockard Channing before they did
``Love Letters.'' He had done the show before with Joanna Gleason;
Channing had performed it with Bruce Davison. They both had other
commitments and arrived at the theater 40 minutes before the
curtain went up.
   ``They barely had time to say hello before going to work,''
Frankel says.
   A few husbands and wives also have done the play _ among them
Nancy Marchand and Paul Sparer, as well as Lynn Redgrave and John
Clark.
   Word is now out among the acting community about what an
excellent showcase ``Love Letters'' can be for a performer.
``Actors like to do it because it's a good way for producers and
agents to get a look at what they can do,'' Frankel says.
   The commitment for only a week appeals to many performers who
have family or long-range show business commitments.
   Some of the actors have appeared in different cities and may
work again on the various tours. Robert Vaughn and Polly Bergen did
it in San Francisco and then did it in New York. Lynn Redgrave and
John Clark, having performed the play in New York, also will work
in San Francisco.
   ``The thought of doing material this good and not having to
learn it was fabulous,'' Redgrave says. ``Plus the play was
something that my husband and I could do together after all these
years. We haven't acted together since we met 23 years ago.''
   Frankel insists the play stays remarkably the same even with its
different performers.
   ``Because it is a new cast every week who are directed by the
same director, I think it has strayed less than a normal show does
during a long run,'' he says. ``There is someone going back to the
book every week, instructing the actors how it is to be done.
   ``Having said that, the show is totally different with different
people doing it. Liz McGovern and Timothy Hutton will be different
from Jason Robards and Colleen Dewhurst. Everybody brings their own
experience to it.''
   By the time ``Love Letters'' finishes its journey around the
country, there will be a lot of alumni. The New York alumni already
have a souvenir. Each received a very preppy crew neck sweater for
their week's work.

   Richard Chamberlain's Hawaii-based medical
series is undergoing cosmetic surgery to make it more attractive to
the audience.
   In the near future, his character of Dr. Daniel Kulani in
``Island Son'' will spend more time away from the hospital and
become more involved with people. The CBS show also has new opening
credits and new music. That went into effect when ``Island Son''
moved from Tuesday to Thursday in mid-December.
   ``When we go back into production after the first of the year
we'll open up the show and spend more time out of the hospital,''
says Chamberlain. ``You'll see those changes around February.''
   Chamberlain says this will take ``Island Son'' closer to its
original concept of a man who was educated in modern medicine yet
still honors the Hawaii traditions and folk medicine of his
upbringing.
   ``These are things we've been asking for for a long time,'' he
says. ``The drop in the ratings seems to support me. Now everyone
has the same idea. The interesting thing to me as an actor is the
human side, not the medical drama. I think people have seen enough
faulty gall bladders and hematomas.
   ``Even doctors have a life outside the hospital, which may come
as a surprise to some people. I'll be involved in closer
relationships with the residents, and some surprising things will
happen in my life. My ex-wife is going to come back and cause me
some severe emotional difficulties.''
   Besides family and human relations, the show will have fast cars
and martial arts.
   Chamberlain is no stranger to hospitals, of course. His first
and only other series, ``Dr. Kildare,'' was one of television's
earliest and most successful medical dramas.
   Since that series in 1961-66, Chamberlain made a name for
himself as a classical actor in England, starred on Broadway, made
a number of feature films and became the king of television
miniseries.
   He was interviewed during a visit to the mainland while ``Island
Son'' was temporarily out of production. Even before starting the
series he had moved to Hawaii.
   ``I've always wanted a house by the sea. Everything I looked at
in Malibu was impossible; you can't get into Malibu for less than
$3 million. I found this place in Hawaii. It's beautiful and off
the beaten track. After doing a miniseries it was a place for me to
go and recuperate. It's very healing and soothing.''
   The actor says he's been traveling consistently for 25 years and
``wouldn't have missed a second of it.'' But he adds:
   ``I wanted to put down some roots. I wanted to stop living out
of a suitcase. Besides staying put, another reason I wanted to do a
series was that I wanted to be involved on the production side. I'm
co-executive producer of `Island Son.' That makes the job even more
interesting for me.''
   The miniseries Chamberlain has done have taken him all over the
world. ``Centennial'' landed him in Colorado, ``Shogun'' in Japan,
``Wallenberg: A Hero's Story'' and ``The Bourne Identity'' in
Europe and ``Dream West'' in the American West. ``The Thorn
Birds,'' an Australian story, was the only one Chamberlain made in
California.
   Two films, ``King Solomon's Mines'' and ``Allan Quartermain and
the Lost City of Gold,'' took him to Africa for many months.
Recently he went back to Spain, where he had done ``The Three
Musketeers'' and ``The Four Musketeers,'' for ``Return of the
Musketeers.'' He plays Aramis.
   Chamberlain's Hawaii-based show had been in development for a
long time. There were extensive delays in finding a suitable
writer. Nigel and Carol Evan McKeand, who had done ``Family,'' were
signed as executive producers only five weeks before production
began. Chamberlain would like it much better if the writing and
production staff would move to Hawaii but he knows that will never
happen.
   ``It's difficult to grasp the feeling of the islands if you've
never lived there,'' he says. ``Our original idea was somewhat
different from what's been seen so far. We were going to have more
of Hawaii itself in it and more of its healing arts. Kulani is a
man who was adopted by a traditional Hawaiian family and raised in
this culture.
   ``I think the first script stressed that too much and Lorimar
Television and CBS got anxious. So we're bringing that back. We
didn't intend to be so confined to the hospital. We're opening that
up.''

   Years of national economic decline
have plunged Brazil's educational system into a crisis that
officials fear will deprive the country of the brainpower needed to
ensure social stability in the future.
   Illiteracy is creeping back up, the student dropout rate is
rising and schools are forced to close for lack of money. Schools
that survive are turning out ill-informed, unskilled graduates, the
officials say.
   A small elite of college graduates, frustrated by shrinking job
markets, is fleeing the country to pursue post-graduate degrees and
jobs in the United States and Europe, a brain drain expected to
hinder Brazil's development for decades.
   Dr. Paulo Alvim, secretary general of the Education Ministry,
estimates that the deteriorating system will ``adversely affect the
quality of the labor pool and slow the nation's progress in
scientific fields.''
   ``The educational deterioration has a devastating social
impact,'' Alvim added. ``Young people are losing touch with society
and their leaders, leading them into the black holes of drugs,
alcohol and crime. By allowing our school system to deteriorate, we
are in effect creating a marginal population that will eventually
strain the government's social programs.''
   The rising cost of education, even though teachers' salaries
remain low, is another area of difficulty.
   Last year, students protesting tuition increases clashed with
police in major cities.
   ``The system simply can't get any worse than it is now. We've
hit absolute rock bottom,'' said Fatima Cunha, secretary general of
education in Rio de Janeiro state.
   According to a United Nations survey, Brazil, which has the
Western world's eighth-largest economy, has one of the highest
illiteracy rates in South America _ 27 percent in 1988, up from 25
percent in 1986. It is believed to have risen even further in 1989.
   Brazil, a nation of 150 million people, had been making headway
against illiteracy.
   According to Alvim, illiteracy in Brazil had been declining
progressively since 1872, when the rate was 83 percent. Fifty
percent of the population was illiterate in 1950. In 1960, 40
percent of Brazilians were illiterate.
   A UNICEF study released in December said Brazil had the seventh
highest grade school dropout rate in the world, behind only Haiti,
Yemen, Chad, the Central African Republic, Bangladesh and Burma. It
said only 23 percent of pupils completed grade school in 1985-87,
although the law requires children to remain in school until they
are 18.
   About 27 million elementary school students are attending
private and public schools. Nationwide, only 3.4 million students
attend public and private high schools and 1.5 million are enrolled
in private and public universities.
   A recent survey by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and
Statistics found other dark spots in the educational system:
   _Eleven percent of high school teachers have not finished grade
school. In several states in the poor Northeast, the rate is 40
percent.
   _Nearly three-quarters of the country's school buildings are
unfit for use.
   Blame for the crisis is placed essentially on Brazil's plunge
since the mid-1970s into the worst economic crisis in its history.
It now has a $110 billion foreign debt, a 1,765 percent annual
inflation rate and an economy in stagnation.
   The government spends just 2.8 percent of revenue on education _
roughly the equivalent of $9.8 billion _ compared with an average
of 4 percent in the rest of Latin America.
   The U.S. federal outlay for education _ not counting state and
municipal expenditures _ was about $22 billion for 1988.
   Even though Brazilian government outlays for education already
were low, officials recently cut by 40 percent the money allocated
for public universities and special education programs. And federal
funds often get lost in huge state bureaucracies and never reach
the classroom, Secretary General Cunha of the Rio ministry said.
   President-elect Fernando Collor de Mello, a conservative who
takes office March 15, has pledged to build schools and spend more
on education. But with 90 percent of federal revenues now earmarked
for government employees' salaries, there isn't much likely to be
available anytime soon for schools.
   Grammar and high school teachers in major cities earn the
equivalent of $100 a month. In outlying areas of the poor
Northeast, such as in the village of Jerumenha in Maranhao state,
grade school teachers make just $6 a month.
   Many teachers give extra night classes to make extra money.
Others sell perfume, jewelry and jeans in school hallways during
class breaks.
   ``It's hard to look your students in the eye afterwards,'' said
Maria Luiza de Vitergo, 29, a high school history teacher. ``You're
supposed to be their role model _ not a peddler.''

   Private schools, often packed with 50 students to a classroom,
lack desks, chairs, blackboards and chalk. Rarely do all students
get the same editions of textbooks, if they are available.
   Still, private school tuition shot up 524 percent from January
to June last year, three times faster than the inflation rate.
Students across the country held protest marches, and TV news
reports almost nightly showed riot troops clashing with teen-agers.
   Spiraling tuition costs have led to an exodus of students from
private to public schools, further straining the system.
   In Rio de Janeiro's upper middle-class Flamengo district, half
of the once-reputable Amaro Cavalcanti high school building was
condemned because of cracked walls and ceilings, electrical
failure, rats in classrooms and broken stairways, said Angela
Blemiro, the public school's principal. However, classes are still
held there.
   Last year, strikes by teachers and school employees brought
classes to a halt for up to six months in some states.
   In the southeastern state of Sao Paulo, strikes forced the
state's Education Council to give 1,800 students high school
degrees without their having completed the term.
   ``There were no teachers to give classes,'' explained Wagner
Rossi, the Sao Paulo state Secretary General of Education. ``The
students cannot be penalized for that.''
   The miserable wages and long work hours discourage teachers from
giving their best, said Francilio Pinto Paes Leme, general
secretary of the 25,000-member Teachers' Union in Rio de Janeiro.
   ``A mediocrity pact exists between professors who fake teaching,
students who fake learning and school employees who fake working,''
said Solange Ikeda, president of the Federal University of Mato
Grosso state.
   Most dropouts leave school to help support their families, in a
country where 73 percent of the work force makes less than $180 a
month. The squeeze also makes college education impossible for all
but the elite.
   As a result, some 4 million students nationwide are resorting to
home radio and TV courses and earning grade school and high school
equivalency diplomas through the mail.
   One program on Globo TV, the nation's largest network, offers
courses at 6:30 a.m. and 8:30 p.m. to allow high school students
who work to study at home. At semester's end, final exams are
mailed to the Education Ministry for grading.
   The program has one of the network's highest ratings, said Jose
Renato Monteiro, president of the Roberto Marinho Foundation,
created by media tycoon of that name.
   ``TV is helping to bypass the crisis by filling a gap in the
educational system,'' Monteiro said in an interview. ``It's a poor
country's solution to an old problem.''
   Proponents of education reform are pushing state governors to
decentralize city schools from the national network, raise
teachers' salaries, impose stricter standards for teachers, and
rebuild schools, especially in the impoverished countryside.
   ``Education can be improved here,'' said Paes Leme of the
teachers' union. ``It's a question of learning to set priorities
straight.''

   Saints, martyrs and spirits have been brought to
life as China's leaders try to teach their people to be good
Communists in these times of sinking fortunes for communism around
the world.
   The role model _ selfless, hard-working, plain-living and loyal
unto death _ is a time-honored educational tool in Communist China.
Now, as China's hardline leaders seek absolute allegiance to a
system where absolutes no longer exist, the party has again called
on its paragons to lead the way.
   They are a counterweight both to the anti-party, pro-West
sentiments of the crushed pro-democracy movement of Tiananmen
Square last spring and the political changes that have swept
Eastern Europe.
   Some, like perfect soldier Lei Feng, perennially return at times
of ideological strife. Others, such as the young martyr Lai Ning,
are newcomers to the party pantheon.
   There are also ideals, such as the ``spirit of Yanan,'' that
hark back to a simpler day when party leaders sought to serve
rather than corrupt and young people dedicated lives to socialist
idealism rather than Western materialism.
   These are a few of the legends now in vogue:
   LEI FENG
   Nearly two decades after his death, Chinese today offer blood,
sweep streets and give free haircuts in the name of peasant soldier
Lei Feng.
   Lei, who according to a children's song ``walks 1,000 miles and
does 1,000 good deeds,'' was killed in 1962 at age 22 when he
backed his truck into a utility pole. But a year later Chairman Mao
Tse-tung proclaimed him a Communist saint in the first of many
campaigns titled ``Learn from Lei Feng.''
   According to legend, the fervent patriot secretly washed the
clothes of his comrades, donated his savings to help peasants hit
by floods and once gave his coat to a woman and her child during a
freezing rainstorm.
   For his latest reincarnation, the People's Liberation Army has
distributed 300,000 copies of his diary ``with a view to launching
a new upsurge in the army on learning from Lei Feng.''
   The PLA Daily, newspaper of the People's Liberation Army, said
some supporters of ``degenerate Western bourgeois concepts'' have
tried to denigrate Lei by saying he's outdated. But it added: ``If
all soldiers can be like Lei Feng, have unparalleled loyalty to the
party and the people, and give matchless love to socialism ... then
our army will become an indestructible steel Great Wall.''

   LAI NING
   He died at age 14 in 1988 while trying to put out a forest fire
near his home in northern China. This past October he headed a list
of the nation's 10 best Young Pioneers, a party-led youth
organization, and was described by the party's official newspaper,
People's Daily, as ``a flaming torch'' of revolutionary spirit.
   Among the attributes praised about Lai is one that he hoped to
be a geologist so he could excavate precious metals from mountains
around his home and ``contribute to our motherland.''
   ``Study the hero Lai Ning'' meetings are being held across the
country. The city of Beijing has issued a book, ``The Heroic Youth
Lai Ning,'' and has organized ``Study Lai Ning Detachments'' in
schools.

   MODEL WORKERS
   Last fall 2,000 model workers were assembled at the Great Hall
of the People for the first national ceremony in three decades to
honor such exemplars of labor.
   The official press, meanwhile, is filled with tales such as the
one of ``Sweeper Uncle'' Jiang Daoping, a retired colonel and war
hero who shot down seven enemy planes in the Korean War but took a
job as a janitor at Shanghai's Tongji University after retiring.
   His daughter, worried she couldn't get a boyfriend with her
father in such a lowly position, tried to dissuade him, but Jiang
reportedly replied: ``It is no shame to do whatever I can for the
society. It will benefit both my body and soul.''
   Then there is ``Flying Li'' Songzhi, a policewoman who at 52
still leads a task force against pickpockets.
   ``Riding the bicycle at full speed, I can keep up with a bus
when a thief is riding on it,'' she is quoted as saying. ``In so
doing, I feel that I have regained my youth.''
   Another is Qiu Tiandao, a young army medic who reputedly is so
skilled at acupuncture that he uses both hands to stick needles in
two patients at the same time.
   ``It's my happiest thing to see the sufferings of the patients
eased under my hands.''

   LEARN FROM DAQING
   This common call during the ultra-leftist 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution refers to the perseverance of those who built the
nation's largest oilfield in the wastelands of northeastern China.
   Wang Tao, head of China National Petroleum Corp., pledged at
ceremonies this past fall to mark the 30th anniversary of the
Daqing fields that he would initiate a campaign to revive the
Daqing spirit.
   He said: ``This is necessary to clear away the influence of
serious mistakes made by Comrade Zhao Ziyang.'' Zhao was purged as
the Communist Party last June for supporting Western liberal ideas.
   State-run television is now showing a nightly drama depicting
the feats of ``Ironman'' Wang Jinxi, another revolutionary hero who
refused to give up his quest even after experts said there was no
oil under the frozen plains of what was to become Daqing.

   THE SPIRIT OF YANAN
   Yanan, in the dusty hills of northwestern China, was Mao
Tse-tung's revolutionary base for 13 years in the 1930s and 1940s
when the Red Army was fighting the Japanese as well as Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists.
   Young Chinese are now told to emulate the spirit of those days,
when Mao and the other Communist leaders lived in caves and worked
among the Yanan peasants.
   ``The Yanan spirit is the national treasure of the Chinese
people,'' the People's Daily said. ``During the Yanan period, the
whole party established the good tradition of hard work, and the
style of plain living was in particular advocated.''
   A recent exhibition on the ``Spirit of Yanan'' in the provincial
capital of Xian was said to have been seen by 100,000 students. One
student wrote in the visitors' book: ``University students in the
1980s should study the Yanan spirit and let the spirit blossom in
radiant splendor in them.''

<HEAD>Food Emergencies Again Threaten Ethiopia And Sudan</HEAD>

   War and nature's caprice are conspiring to
create food shortages that again threaten millions of people with
starvation in Ethiopia and Sudan.
   Drought and the depredations wrought by two long civil wars have
imperiled as many as 4 million people in northern Ethiopia,
according to relief officials there.
   Similarly, in neighboring Sudan where as many as 250,000 died of
hunger in 1987-88, a resumption of fighting in a 6-year-old civil
war has raised fresh fears of another famine despite an extensive
and, by all accounts, successful United Nations-led relief
operation last year.
   Men at war, not nature, have become the biggest threat to those
in need, with governments and guerrillas preventing a helpful
international community from getting food to hungry peasants.
   Holding back the relief effort in Ethiopia is the government's
resistance to delivering food to people behind rebel lines in the
rebellious province of Eritrea and most particularly in the
province of Tigre, leaving an untold number of people beyond the
reach of aid agencies.
   Diplomats and relief workers fear that if a way is not found to
feed these people, Ethiopia could suffer a repeat of the great
famine of 1984-85 when as many as 1 million people died.
   ``It has the potential if nothing is done about it,'' said David
Morton, the U.N. World Food Program's representative in Ethopia.
   ``If food is not gotten in there in some way, everyone is
concerned we'll have a famine situation resulting from a drought
situation,'' said Morton. ``We can't say how many would die because
we still don't know how many are affected, but clearly very large
numbers.''
   The United Nations has appealed for an initial 700,000 tons of
emergency food aid, about a third of which has been pledged by
foreign donors. More food may be needed if later assessments show
the situation worsening.
   Morton says his agency recently began moving 60,000 tons to
distribution points in the northernmost province of Eritrea, much
of which still remains in government hands.
   Tigre, Eritrea's southern neighbor, is the main problem, Morton
says.
   The province, home to an estimated 2.6 million people, is
entirely in rebel hands and consequently inaccessible to relief
agencies.
   The rebel Tigre People's Liberation Front, which has been
fighting since 1975 to oust President Mengistu Haile Mariam, gained
control of its home province early last year. Since August, the
rebels have made their greatest gains, pushing southward and
westward into neighboring provinces and moving ever closer to
Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa.
   Ethiopia has conscripted hundreds of thousands of men to fight
the Tigrean rebels, who pose the greatest military threat to
Mengistu's government.
   Relief officials nonetheless say they are encouraged by the
government's recent request that several indigenous relief and
church agencies study ways to get food to those behind rebel lines
in Tigre and report on their findings.
   However, there is the lurking fear that the government is not
sincere about wanting to feed those it considers the rebels'
support base.
   Limited amounts of food can be moved to Tigre through
neighboring Sudan.
   But aid officials express a concern that if food shipments are
not begun soon, peasants will begin long and treacherous walks
across embattled barren territory in search of food at
government-sanctioned distribution centers outside Tigre.
   Weakened by their migration and lack of food and unable to
return home, the peasants could create vast overcrowded and
unhygenic famine camps similar to those of 1984-85 in which more
people died of disease than of starvation.
   Similar fears surrounded the 1987-88 relief operation when crop
failures also threatened millions with starvation. But during that
emergency, the government still had control of some of Tigre and
much of Eritrea and food got through to those in need before mass
migrations began.
   ``We can't avoid drought, but we can avoid famine,'' Morton said.
   Long-term prospects, however, are not encouraging.
   ``We've got a situation of increasing population year after year
and stagnant production of food,'' said one aid official who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``The long-term outlook on present
trends isn't good.''
   In southern Sudan, the resumption of fighting between the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army and the government has derailed
relief efforts credited with averting a repeat of the 1988 tragedy.
   Observers say the nearly 100,000 tons of food ferried into the
embattled region between April and November through ``corridors of
tranquility'' staved off widespread death.
   Both warring parties declared a series of cease-fires to permit
the shipments. However, that informal truce broke down in late
October when fighting flared. And in early November the government
declared a ban on all relief flights, saying it wanted to
investigate the aerial bombing of a rebel-held town. The Sudan
rebels have no planes.
   Bombings have continued in many southern towns being helped by
the United Nations and the government, never happy about food being
given to areas under the rebels' control, has accused relief
workers of delivering arms, ammunition and spare parts under the
cover of humanitarian aid.
   Although Sudan's military leadership has promised a conference
to consider allowing the resumption of relief flights, aid workers
fear the worst.
   ``Unless we continue our efforts through the next season,
southern Sudan could fall back to a life-threatening situation,''
said Vincent O'Reilly, spokesman for the U.N.-led Operation
Lifeline Sudan.
   Ironically, nature has provided the region with plenty of rain.
   Given tools and seeds, the peasants could grow nearly twice as
much food this year as was delivered by the emergency operation,
O'Reilly said.
   In its second phase, he added, Operation Lifeline Sudan planned
to deliver $2 million worth of seeds and hand tools. But the
fighting has made this impossible, leaving the region in a perilous
state, he said.
   The food deliveries ``have maintained people in place,''
O'Reilly said. ``We have not addressed the underlying agricultural
problem and the impact of the war.''
   ``Unless we do, we could face a return to a famine situation.''

   One thing about your federal income tax return
never changes: You can bet it will never be the same from one year
to the next.
   This year is no exception. There are changes affecting children
as young as 2 and others that will alter the returns of millions of
retirees. There are new forms as well as changes in some familiar
ones.
   All taxpayers will find the bottom line _ their actual tax
liability _ is slightly below what it would have been without some
of the changes enacted in 1986, including inflation adjustments,
that are still taking effect.
   Here is a look at some of the changes:
   EXEMPTIONS: This is $2,000 for 1989 returns, up $50 from 1988. A
taxpayer is allowed one for himself or herself, another for a
spouse and one for each dependent who was alive for at least one
day last year and meets certain tests. A parent may no longer claim
a full-time student 24 or older whose income is $2,000 or more.
   STANDARD DEDUCTIONS: A single person who does not itemize
deductions may claim a standard deduction of $3,100, up $100 from
last year because of inflation. For a couple filing a joint return,
the deduction is $5,200; for a married person filing separately,
$2,600; a qualified head of household, $4,550. A single taxpayer or
head of household is allowed another $750 if at least 65 years old
or blind, or $1,500 if both; a couple gets another $600 for each
spouse who is blind or at least 65, or $2,400 if both are blind and
at least 65.
   TAX BRACKETS: To offset inflation-caused ``bracket creep,'' the
brackets have been widened by about 4 percent so that more income
is taxed at lower rates.
   SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER: You must list on your return the Social
Security number of any dependent child who was 2 or older in 1989.
This requirement, which previously applied only to children 5 or
over, is aimed at preventing both separated parents from claiming
an exemption for the same child.
   CATASTROPHIC COVERAGE: This medical program and the special
surtax that helped finance it have been repealed. Ignore the lines
on your return that refer to the surtax.
   MILEAGE: The deductible mileage allowance for unreimbursed use
of a personal car for business is up to 24{ cents a mile for the
first 15,000 miles driven in 1989 and 11 cents for subsequent
travel. Rates for mileage driven for charitable and medical
purposes remain at 12 and 9 cents, respectively.
   TELEPHONE: You may no longer deduct as a job-related expense any
part of the basic monthly charge for your home telephone; a second
phone line may still be deductible.
   INTEREST DEDUCTION: Only 20 percent of consumer interest _
credit cards, automobile loans, education loans and the like _ paid
in 1989 may be deducted. There is a separate limit on interest paid
to buy taxable investments; you may deduct investment interest
totaling up to the amount of net investment income plus $1,000 for
a married person filing a separate return and $2,000 for all other
filers.
   EARNED-INCOME CREDIT: This benefit for low-income working
families with children has been raised to a maximum tax saving of
$910, with some credit allowed until income reaches $19,340.
   CHILD-CARE CREDIT: Two new restrictions on this credit, which
helps pay expenses of caring for children so parents may hold a
job: The credit now is available only if the child is under age 13;
any employer-paid reimbursement for child care must be subtracted
from the expenses on which the credit is calculated.
   CHILD TAXPAYERS: A parent may file on his or her return the
income of a child _ and thus free the child from filing _ under
these conditions: The child had not yet turned 14 on Jan. 1, 1990,
had income of more than $500 and less than $5,000 and all of it was
from interest and dividends, had no tax withheld and made no
estimated tax payments in 1989.

   Inflation adjustments to the tax system have
freed many lower-income workers from having to file a 1989 tax
return.
   Whether you must file a return depends on your family status and
your income. A $50 boost in the personal exemption and automatic
increases in the standard deductions to offset inflation have
raised the maximum amount of gross income that a person may earn
without filing a return.
   The general filing thresholds are determined by adding the
number of $2,000 personal exemptions and the standard deduction to
which an individual or couple is entitled. The additional deduction
permitted a blind person is not considered in the calculation.
   Here are the basic filing thresholds for each type of return:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   SINGLE: You must file a return if your 1989 gross income subject
to tax was $5,100 or more. If you were 65 or older last year, the
threshold is $5,850.
   MARRIED, FILING JOINTLY: If both spouses are under 65, the
threshold is $9,200; if one is 65 or older, $9,800; if both are at
least 65, $10,400. The couple must have been living together at
yearend and neither may be claimed as a dependent on another
person's return.
   MARRIED, FILING SEPARATELY: You must file if income was $2,000
or more.
   HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD: If you are under 65, file if income was at
least $6,550; if older, the threshold is $7,300.
   The lower tax rates of this filing status are open to any person
who was unmarried on the last day of 1989 and who paid more than
half the cost of maintaining for the full year the principal home
of at least one qualified relative. That includes a child,
grandchild, parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle, niece, nephew or
in-law. Cousins don't count.
   QUALIFYING WIDOW: You must file if you are under 65 and income
was at least $7,200; $7,800, if you are 65 or older. If your spouse
died in 1987 or 1988 and you did not remarry by the end of 1989,
you may use the tax-saving joint-return rates if:
   _You paid more than half the cost of maintaining for the full
year the principal home for a child you were entitled to claim as a
dependent, and
   _You were entitled to file a joint return the year your spouse
died.
   If your spouse died in 1989 and you did not remarry during the
year, you are entitled to file a regular joint return. The same is
true if your spouse died in 1990 before filing a return.
   A separate set of rules applies to a taxpayer who can be claimed
as a dependent by another. In that case, you must file a return if:
   _You had no unearned income (such as interest and dividends) and
your earnings were $3,100 or more.
   _You are married and 65 or older and had unearned income of at
least $1,100. If you are unmarried and 65 or older with some
unearned income, you must file once total income tops $1,250. Any
person under age 65 with any unearned income must file if total
income is $500 or more.
   There are still more ifs, ands and buts. Regardless of all those
thresholds, you still must file a return if:
   _You had net self-employment earnings of at least $400.
   _You received any advance earned-income credit in your paychecks.
   _You owe any special taxes, such as the alternative minimum tax;
a tax on premature withdrawals from an Individual Retirement
Account, or Social Security tax you did not report to your employer.
   Even if your income is low enough that you do not have to file,
you still must file if taxes were withheld and you want a refund.
You also must file to receive the earned-income credit.

   You don't necessarily give up your children as
dependents for tax purposes just because they have jobs of their
own.
   It depends on their income and living expenses.
   Each dependent claimed can reduce taxes by $560 for someone in
the 28 percent bracket. But the rules for qualifying can be so
complicated that many taxpayers miss the chance to make claims to
which they are entitled.
   There are five basic tests for determining whether someone is
your dependent; all five must be met.
   RELATIONSHIP: A dependent must have lived with you throughout
1989 (except for being temporarily absent for school, military
service, vacation or illness), OR must be a relative. Relative
includes child, grandchild, stepchild, parent, grandparent,
brother, sister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece or in-law. Live-in
lover? Yes, so long as the relationship does not violate local law.
   INCOME: Generally, a dependent must have gross income under
$2,000, not counting such tax-exempt income as welfare benefits or
the non-taxable portion of Social Security. Note that is gross
income; for example, an elderly parent who made $2,500 in a
part-time job would not qualify, even if expenses of earning that
money reduced net income below $2,000.
   The rules are more liberal where your children are concerned.
There is no limit to the income your child may earn and still
qualify as your dependent if:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _He or she was under 19 at the end of 1989, or
   _He or she was a full-time student and under 24 last year.
Full-time means enrolled with a full class load during any five
months of the year; a government on-farm training course also
qualifies.
   CITIZENSHIP: The dependent must be a U.S. citizen or resident
alien or a resident of Canada or Mexico. Your adopted child need
not be a U.S. citizen but could have lived with you in 1989 in a
foreign country.
   NO JOINT RETURN: A married person you claim as a dependent may
not file a joint return. Again, there is an exception: If neither
spouse is required to file but a joint return is filed to get a
refund of withheld taxes, you may claim the dependent.
   SUPPORT: You must have provided more than half the dependent's
financial support last year.
   First, the exceptions: If you and someone else together pay more
than half the support of a dependent but no one exceeds 50 percent,
you may claim the dependent by contributing more than 10 percent
and having the others sign Form 2120, Multiple Support Declaration.
   In case of divorce or separation, if you are the parent without
custody of a child, you may list the child as a dependent if the
other parent agrees in writing to give up the claim, or if a
pre-1985 agreement or decree gave you the right to claim the child.
   To figure whether the support test was met, you will have to
determine what the dependent received from other sources, including
his or her own income. And note that although non-taxable income
does not figure into the calculation of the dependent's income
mantioned above, it does count here; that is, tax-exempt interest,
for example, must be included when the dependent calculates total
resources used for his or her own support.
   Some items of support are obvious: shelter, food, clothing,
transportation (including purchase of a car), medical expenses
including insurance, education, and child-care services.
   Other items that might be overlooked include charitable
contributions on behalf of the dependent, cosmetics, pets, toys,
tobacco, beer, gifts, spending money, and even the cost of a
wedding.
   You may not count as support such items as life insurance
premiums, scholarships, and income and Social Security taxes.
   Remember that any dependent 2 or older must have a Social
Security number, which must be entered on your tax return. Obtain a
number by filing Form SS-5 with the Social Security Administration.
If you have mailed that form but haven't received a number by the
time you are ready to file your tax return, write ``applied for''
on Line 6c, column 3.

   Despite the best efforts of Congress to move
more taxpayers to the standard deduction, itemizing is still a
better deal for millions of couples and individuals.
   Unless other considerations _ such as time, recordkeeping and
general frustration _ are more important than money, you should
itemize if your deductions exceed the standard deduction. That is
$5,200 for a couple filing a joint return; $3,100 for a single
person; $4,550 for a qualified head of household, and $2,600 for a
married person filing separately.
   Congress reduced or eliminated some widely used deductions as
the price for cutting tax rates across the board in the 1986 tax
overhaul. Because of those changes, the share of tax returns
itemizing deductions dropped from 39.5 percent in 1987 to 33.3
percent in 1988.
   That percentage probably fell again on returns filed last year
because of a continuing phase-out of the deduction for consumer
interest. That deduction, which includes automobile and education
loans and credit-card interest, dropped to 20 percent in 1989, will
be 10 percent for interest paid this year and will reach zero in
1991.
   For most people, the biggest deduction is for home mortgage
interest and remains unchanged from last year. Your mortgage
interest is fully deductible if:
   _The mortgages on your principal home were taken out on or
before Oct. 13, 1987, or
   _Any mortgages taken out after that date were used only to buy,
build or improve your principal home and they totaled $1 million or
less in all of 1989, or if
   _Any mortgages taken out after that date were used for purposes
other than home purchase, building or improvement and totaled
$100,000 or less last year.
   Publication 936, free from the IRS, will be helpful if part of
your mortgage is not deductible or if you own two or more homes.
   Points paid to obtain a mortgage may be deducted fully in one
year only if the loan was used to buy or improve your main home and
the home was used as security; you paid the points from funds other
than the loan; if points are customarily charged in your area and
if what you paid is not out of line with the usual fee.
   Otherwise, the points must be deducted gradually over the life
of the loan.
   Other deductions:
   MEDICAL: Unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7{ percent of
adjusted gross income. These can range from the usual fees paid to
physicians, dentists and Christian Science practitioners (but not
Scientology counselors) to prescribed exercise equipment, limited
lodging expenses for out-of-town care, and sometimes even the cost
of a wig.
   CONTRIBUTIONS: Donations to IRS-recognized charities generally
are fully deductible if total contributions are no more than 50
percent of adjusted gross income. You may deduct up to 30 percent
of AGI for contributions of money or ordinary-income property (as
opposed to property that could produce a capital gain). Use Form
8283 to report gifts other than money when the value exceeds $500.
No breakdown is required on your return if such gifts are worth
$500 or less.
   TAXES: There is no longer a deduction for sales taxes, but you
still may write off state and local income and real estate taxes.
Personal-property taxes for cars, boats and the like are deductible
if based on value and not on weight. Excises, tolls, fines, license
fees and estate taxes are not deductible.
   MOVING: You may be able to deduct certain expenses of a
job-related move if the new job is at least 35 miles farther from
your old home than was the old job. (For example, if your old job
was three miles from home, your new job must be at least 38 miles
from the old home). If you had no previous job, the new job must be
35 miles or more from your old home. Publication 521, free from the
IRS, gives details.
   LOSSES: Non-business losses due to fire, theft, storm and
similar events may be deductible, but misplacing or breaking a
valuable item is not a deductible loss. After absorbing the first
$100 of each loss, you may deduct only the total amount of all
uninsured losses in a year that exceeds 10 percent of adjusted
gross income. See Form 4684.
   MISCELLANEOUS: Most expenses relating to your employment (union
dues, tools and work clothes not suitable for street wear),
investments (advice, safe-deposit box, subscriptions), or tax
preparation are deductible only to the extent they exceed 2 percent
of adjusted gross income. Although you still may be able to write
off a second phone in your home or long-distance charges, a
deduction is no longer allowed for the basic monthly charge for the
first phone in your home.

   Congress has tightened the rules on tax
benefits for work-related expenses of caring for a child.
   _There is no longer a credit for expenses of caring for a child
who was 13 or older last year, unless the child was disabled. The
old limit was 15.
   _Any tax-free payments your employer provided for care of your
dependents must be subtracted from the expenses on which the
child-care credit is calculated.
   _You may not claim the credit or exclude from income any
employer-paid child-care benefit unless you fully identify on your
return (including Social Security or employer number) the person or
group that took care of your child.
   If you file the long Form 1040, calculate your child-care
benefits on Form 2441. If you file the shorter Form 1040A, use Part
1 to accompany that form.
   The child-care credit can reduce your tax bill by as much as
$1,440 if your qualify.
   WHO QUALIFIES? In general, a taxpayer who, in order to work or
seek work, must hire someone to care for a dependent child who is
disabled or under age 13, or for any other dependent or spouse who
is physically or mentally incapable of self-care.
   WHAT KIND OF WORK? Full-time or part-time, for someone else or
in your own business. You or your spouse must have had earnings
during 1989. A spouse can meet the work requirement if he or she
was a full-time student during a part of each of five months last
year.
   WHAT EXPENSES? Services necessary to run your home, even if only
part of the expense was for the benefit of your dependent, and
services needed to care for the dependent. This includes services
of a cook, maid or housekeeper, the IRS says, but not a gardener or
chauffeur. Don't include clothing or entertainment expenses.
   You may include expenses of nursery school or day care outside
your home if your child is under 13. However, if the child is in
first grade or higher, you must claim only the portion of the
expense that covers child care, not the cost of education.
   If you are paying for the care of one child or other dependent,
your credit is calculated on qualified expenses of up to $2,400;
for two or more dependents, the maximum is $4,800. You may not
count expenses that exceed your earned income; if you are married
and filing jointly, the total of qualified expenses is limited to
your or your spouse's earnings _ whichever is smaller.
   However, if you used tax-excluded employer-provided dependent
care last year, you must subtract its value from the qualified
expenses used to figure the credit. Thus, for example, if you had
$4,500 of expenses for the care of two children and your employer
provided $2,500 worth of care, you may not use more than $2,000 of
expenses for calculating the credit.
   The maximum credit, for 30 percent of child-care expenses, is
available only to those with adjusted gross income of $10,000 or
less. As outlined on form 2441 and on Part 1 of Form 1040A, the
credit declines as income rises, to a minimum of 20 percent for
those with adjusted gross income over $28,000.
   There's another bit of red tape for many who claim the credit.
Paying someone to care for a dependent in your home could make you
liable for Social Security and unemployment taxes on that person's
wages.
   You must withhold Social Security tax if you pay a household
employee wages of $50 or more in a quarter. You should have
withheld 7.51 percent and matched it from your own pocket in 1989,
and turned the money over to the government with Form 942.
   Paying $1,000 or more during a quarter for household help means
you must pay an unemployment tax of up to 6.2 percent of the
workers' wages.
   See IRS Publication 503 for more information on the child-care
credit and Publication 926 for details of your liabilities as an
employer.

   The new ``inflation-proofing'' of the tax
system means a slightly lower burden for most taxpayers.
   A single person with taxable income (after deductions and
exemptions) of $29,000, for example, would have owed $5,807 in tax
without the annual inflation adjustment to the tax brackets.
Instead, the bill will be $5,716, a saving of 2 percent.
   A couple filing a joint return with $35,000 taxable income will
owe $5,784 for 1989, 3 percent less than the $5,940 liability they
would have faced without the inflation adjustment.
   The adjustment was made by taxing an additional 4 percent of
income at a lower rate.
   For example, the top of the lowest bracket _ 15 percent, which
is the only rate paid by about 8 of every 10 taxpayers _ was raised
for joint returns from $29,750 for 1988 to $30,950 for 1989. For
single people, the 15 percent rate applies to $18,550 of 1989
taxable income, up from $17,850 in 1988.
   In addition to the savings associated with widening the tax
brackets, taxpayers also are paying less because the personal
exemptions have been increased and the standard deductions have
been ``indexed'' to offset inflation.
   The changes were voted as part of the tax overhaul enacted in
1986.

   Forget all that talk you heard last year about
expanding Individual Retirement Accounts. The IRA rules for your
1989 tax return are basically the same as a year ago.
   That means fully deductible IRAs are available only for
lower-income workers and for those with higher incomes who are not
covered by a company pension. Other workers will have to do some
paperwork to see if they are eligible for a partial deduction.
   Non-deductible IRA contributions are still allowed but require
filing a Form 8606.
   A worker who qualifies for a full deduction may set aside in an
IRA up to 100 percent of 1989 wages or $2,000, whichever is
smaller. A limited separate deduction may be claimed for a spouse
who earned $250 or less. In either case, no tax is paid on the
contribution or interest it earns until withdrawn at age 59{ or
later.
   Your eligibility for any deductible IRA contribution depends on
your income and marital status and whether you are covered by a
company pension. You are not allowed to contribute to an IRA for
1989 if you were 70{ or older at yearend.
   To determine your eligibility for a deductible contribution, two
figures are important.
   The first is your ``modified adjusted gross income.'' If you are
filing Form 1040A, that means wages, salaries and tips (line 7).
For 1040, it means total income minus the adjustments on lines 26
through 29.
   The second figure is the phase-out level. For a single person or
unmarried head of household, this is $35,000; for a couple filing
jointly, it is $50,000; for a married person filing a separate
return, it is $10,000.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>NO DEDUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   You get no deduction if you (or your spouse if you file jointly)
are covered by a company pension and income exceeds the phase-out
level.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FULL DEDUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   You are eligible for a fully deductible IRA if:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   _Neither you nor your spouse _ if you are filing jointly _ is
covered by a company pension. Your income doesn't matter.
   _Or, if you or your spouse are covered by a company plan and
adjusted gross income (before calculating the IRA) falls at least
$10,000 below the phase-out.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PARTIAL DEDUCTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   You are allowed a partial deduction if income is less than
$10,000 above the phase-out. The deduction is 20 percent of the
difference between the two figures.
   A single person with income of $30,000 would subtract that from
$35,000 (the phase-out), multiply the $5,000 difference by .20 and
claim a $1,000 deduction.
   Note that if both spouses had earnings and contributed to an IRA
in 1989, they must use separate worksheets to figure their
deductions. However, the calculations _ and the phase-out _ are
based on the couple's combined incomes.
   For example, Mary earned $21,000 and John earned $20,000, a
combined income of $41,000. Each calculates the allowable IRA
deduction by subtracting $41,000 from $50,000 and multiplying the
remaining $9,000 by .20. That results in a $1,800 maximum deduction
for each spouse.
   If one spouse earned $250 or less, a different calculation is
required. Assuming Mary had zero income and John earned $41,000,
the couple would subtract $41,000 from $50,000 and multiply the
remaining $9,000 by .225.
   That would yield a total deduction of $2,025, which could be
divided any way between the spouses so long as neither took more
than $1,800, the maximum allowed for a $41,000-a-year couple.
   The IRS allows you, when calculating a partial deduction, to
round up to the next $10. Thus, $301 becomes $310. If the figure is
between zero and $200, round it up to $200.
   If you don't qualify for a full deduction, you still may make a
non-deductible contribution to your IRA. Although there is no
immediate tax benefit, interest earned on the contribution will
remain tax-free until withdrawn.
   Limits for a non-deductible contribution are the same as for
deductible deposits.
   You report a non-deductible contribution by filing the one-page
Form 8606 with your return. Keep a copy of that form for the
future; when you begin withdrawing from your IRA, the IRS will
consider all the money taxable unless you can prove some of it _
the non-deductible deposits _ already has been taxed.
   An IRA contribution for 1989 may be made any time before the
April 16, 1990, deadline for filing a return.

   910 a
year to lower-income working families with children.
   It's called the earned-income credit and a qualifying worker can
even receive the benefit in advance as part of his or her weekly
paycheck. The maximum credit of $910 is available only to families
with income between $6,500 and $10,250, but some benefit can be
claimed until income reaches $19,340.
   You may qualify if you meet all these tests:
   _You have at least one child who lived with you more than half
of 1989, or for the entire year if you file as a qualifying widow
or widower.
   _You had earned income _ wages, tips or self-employment earnings
_ of less than $19,340 last year.
   _Your adjusted gross income _ total income subject to tax minus
alimony, employee business expenses and similar adjustments _ was
under $19,340.
   _You file a joint return, as head of household or qualifying
widow or widower with dependent child.
   There are different rules applying to each of the three filing
statuses. Check free IRS Publication 596 for details.
   You may calculate the credit yourself by using the special
worksheet and the earned-income-credit table in your tax
instructions. Or, the IRS will figure the credit for you. See
instructions on Page 31 of the 1040A instructions or Page 16 of the
1040 booklet.

   Nearly 3{ million retired couples and
individuals will have to pay federal income tax on as much as half
their 1989 Social Security benefits.
   Whether any part of your Social Security is taxable depends on
your total income and your filing status. You are affected if your
total income, including half your benefits and all tax-exempt
interest, exceeds:
   _$32,000, if you are married and filing a joint return.
   _$25,000, if you are single or married and did not live with
your spouse at any time last year.
   _Zero, if you claim any other filing status.
   Here is an example of how to make the calculation. The example
assumes a couple filing a joint return, with $7,500 in Social
Security benefits, other income totaling $32,000, and income
adjustments of $2,400.
   _Add half your Social Security ($3,250) to your other income,
including tax-exempt interest ($32,000): $35,250.
   _Subtract adjustments listed on lines 24 through 30 on Form
1040, such as alimony paid: $2,400. That leaves $32,850.
   _Subtract the threshold for a couple filing jointly: $32,000.
That leaves $850. (If you get zero or less here, none of your
Social Security is taxable).
   _Take half of $850: $425.
   _Compare that $425 with the $3,250 representing half your Social
Security benefits. You pay tax on the smaller: $425. Write that
figure on line 21b of Form 1040. Your total benefits must be listed
on line 21a.
   The government should send you by Jan. 31 a Form SSA-1099,
showing Social Security benefits you were paid last year. The
important figure is in Box 5.
   Use the same rules and computations if you received railroad
retirement benefits. In that case, you should receive Form RRB-1099
in the mail.
   Special rules apply if you repaid any Social Security benefits
last year. Publication 915, free from the IRS, explains this and
other details of determining if any portion of your benefits is
taxable.

   The Internal Revenue Service is a silent
partner when you sell your principal home.
   The IRS must be notified of the sale through the filing of a
Form 1099-S, which is usually done by the settlement agent. But
you, the seller, must file Form 2119 with your tax return, even if
you lost money on the sale.
   In general, capital gains from the sale of real estate, stock or
other investments are subject to tax at the same rates applying to
wages and other income. But there are two ways to avoid the bite
when the gain is from the sale of your principal home:
   _If certain conditions are met, any tax on the gain is deferred
into the future so long as you buy a replacement home that costs at
least as much as your old home sold for. The replacement must be
bought within 24 months before or 24 months after the old one is
sold.
   If your new one costs less than the adjusted selling price of
your old home, you pay tax on the profit from the sale or on the
portion of the sales price that exceeds the cost of the new home _
whichever is less. You reduce the tax bite by adjusting the sales
price of the old home to reflect points, fix-up expenses, real
estate commissions and legal fees you paid.
   Deferral of gain on your home sale is not optional _ you must do
it anytime you buy a principal home whose price equals or exceeds
the adjusted sales price of your old one.
   The tax is only deferred, not forgiven. Any untaxed profit
serves to reduce the cost (for tax purposes) of your new home.
Thus, when your new home is sold in the future, any profit from
that sale is calculated from a lower ``basis.'' But taxation will
continue to be postponed as many times as you replace an old home
with one costing at least as much.
   _If you (or your spouse, if you are married) are 55 or older,
you may avoid tax entirely on the first $125,000 of profits. But
remember that you may exercise this option only once in your
lifetime. To qualify, the property must have been your principal
home for at least three of the last five years before the sale.
   Special consideration is given a person 55 or older who becomes
mentally or physically incapable of self-care during the five-year
period before the home sale. In such a case, the residency
requirement is considered met if up to four of the five years are
spent in a nursing home.
   If you sold your principal home in 1989, IRS Publication 523
offers detailed advice on how to report the sale on Form 2119 and
how to calculate and report any gain on 1040 Schedule D. If you
lost money on the sale, the loss is not deductible.

   Medicare beneficiaries should ignore the lines
on their 1989 tax returns that refer to the surtax for catastrophic
health insurance.
   The program and the surtax that eventually would have financed
most of it were repealed by Congress in November, several weeks
after the tax forms had gone to the printer. The surtax was
repealed retroactively to Jan. 1, 1989, when it first took effect.
   The Internal Revenue Service says taxpayers should skip line 54
on Form 1040 and Line 23 on 1040A. Also, they should ignore
references to Form 8808 and Schedule 2, on which the surtax was to
have been calculated, because those forms do not exist.
   Only about 40 percent of retirees _ those whose incomes were
high enough that they had total federal income tax liability of at
least $150 _ were liable for the surtax in 1989. No one knows how
many of those who were liable actually paid any of the tax, either
by having it withheld from wages or by making quarterly estimated
payments.
   Those who paid the surtax can get it back when they file their
returns by subtracting it from taxes owed.
   This would mean an added burden for retirees whose incomes are
low enough that they are not required to file a return. However,
they will have to file to get a refund of the surtax.
   The $4-a-month catastrophic premium paid by almost all Medicare
beneficiaries also was repealed, but not retroactively.
   The government has a plan for refunding any of these premiums
that continue to be collected in the first few months of 1990, but
those refunds will not be made through the tax system. Thus, the
premiums should not be listed on the tax return.

   The alternative minimum tax is no longer a
concern for just the rich.
   Middle-income taxpayers who have investments in oil, gas,
minerals or real estate; who last year sold property on an
installment plan, or who made a sizable donation of appreciated
property to charity may find themselves liable for the 21 percent
tax.
   The levy was created to ensure that people with a sizable amount
of income pay some tax even though they have significant deductions
and credits. In essence, the minimum tax reduces the value of some
specific deductions.
   Under the latest rules, a couple filing a joint return may be
liable for the tax if adjusted gross income and those targeted
deductions exceed $40,000. For a single person, the threshold is
$30,000.
   The only way to determine for sure whether you must pay the tax
instead of your regular income tax is to read and complete Form
6251.

   It's OK to squirrel away your tax refund _ but
be sure you cash the check first.
   Under a new government policy, a federal check expires if not
cashed within a year.
   Some tips that could increase or expedite your refund or help
you avoid a misstep on filling out your return:
   _When adding up your medical expenses, don't forget automobile
expenses at the rate of 9 cents a mile or actual outlays for gas
and oil. In either case, you may add parking fees and tolls.
   _You get no deduction for time donated to a charity, but again
don't forget auto expenses. This time it's 12 cents a mile or
actual outlays, plus fees and tolls.
   _Costs of education related to your job may be deductible _ but
not if courses prepare you for a new job or enable you to meet the
minimum requirements of your field. Claim the deduction if the
schooling is required by law or by your employer or if it improves
your skills in your present job. See Form 2106.
   _Did you receive pay as a juror in 1989? Whether or not you
itemize, you may deduct jury pay that you turned over to your
employer in exchange for having your full wages continue while you
served.
   _Use Line 28 on Form 1040 to avoid tax on penalties you paid for
early withdrawals from a savings account.
   _Interest earned on Series E or EE savings bonds is taxable but
you don't have to report it as income until a bond matures or you
redeem it, whichever is earlier.
   _If you suffered a casualty loss in 1989 in a disaster that
prompted designation of a federal disaster area, you may claim the
loss on the return you are filing now or the one you filed a year
ago. The latter option, which could result in a greater tax saving,
would require filing of an amended 1988 return on Form 1040X.
   _The most common mistake is one of the easiest to avoid: If you
are not an itemizer, be sure to claim the right standard deduction
for your filing status, and copy the correct figure when you read
across the tax tables to find your tax liability.
   _The IRS allows you to simplify your return by rounding; for
example, $201.49 becomes $201 and $203.78 becomes $204. But you may
round off only the totals _ not the individual items you add to
reach a total.
   _The law says you have not filed a return unless it is signed.
You could face a $500 penalty for filing a return that does not
include basic information necessary to determine your tax
liability. And even if you feel the need to protest, don't cross
out or alter the ``under penalties of perjury'' declaration just
above the signature line; that would void the return.
   _Keep all records pertaining to your taxes for at least three
years. Records on the sale, purchase or improvement of property,
including your home, should be kept permanently, as should
paperwork on your Individual Retirement Account.
   _File Schedule B (for Form 1040) or Schedule 1 (for 1040A) if
you received taxable interest or dividends exceeding $400.
   _The IRS needs to know how much tax-exempt interest you received
last year; it should be listed on line 8b. Don't include interest
earned on your Individual Retirement Account.
   _Not having a W-2 earnings statement is no excuse for not filing
a return. Ask your employer for it.
   _The sequence numbers listed under ``1989'' in the upper right
corner of your tax forms tell you in what order the supplemental
forms and schedules should be attached to your 1040.
   _No matter what you have heard, the experts say, using the
stick-on label on your return does not make it easier for the IRS
to nail you for an audit. It just makes it easier to process the
return through a computer.
   _If you are self-employed and showed a net profit last year, you
may deduct on line 26 of Form 1040 up to 25 percent of what you
paid for health insurance for yourself and your family.
   _Investors in enterprises that generate losses may be subject to
a whole new set of tax rules. In general, a loss from a passive
activity (something in which you do not materially participate) may
not be used to avoid taxes on non-passive income, such as wages.
Check IRS Publication 925.
   _If you deduct alimony payments, your return must show the
Social Security number of the recipient; the recipient's return
must show your number.

   No matter how hard you try, there's still a
chance you will make a mistake on your tax return _ and don't
realize it until you have filed. What then?
   Whether you failed to report interest on a savings account or
neglected to take advantage of a deduction, you need to file an
amended return, Form 1040X. In general, you have three years from
the date your return was mailed to file an amended return or you
forfeit any credit or refund.
   Some other common problems:
   _You can't get your records together in time to meet the April
16 filing deadine? File Form 4868, which gives you an automatic
four-month extension of filing time. But you still must estimate
your taxes and submit with Form 4868 a check for the total.
   _You have no trouble filing, but you don't have the money to pay
your balance? Again, don't put off filing. Pay as much of the
balance as you can, and note on your return or a separate sheet of
paper that you are unable to complete paymwent at the moment. This
does not guarantee the Internal Revenue Service will grant an
extension, but you may be able to work out an installment plan.
Either way, you will have avoided being penalized for not filing a
return.
   _You made no mistake _ in fact, you are getting a big refund?
That's not necessarily good. Remember the refund represents money
you have been lending the government interest-free. If you want to
reduce the refund, file an amended W-4 form with your employer?
   _There's no refund? In fact, you owe the treasury a big chunk?
Again, you may need to amend your W-4. Or, if a good part of your
income is from investments, which are not subject to withholding,
you may need to make quarterly payments of your estimated taxes. As
a rule, you must make quarterly payments if you expect to owe the
IRS $500 or more a year from now.
   _You sent in an application to get a Social Security number for
your 2-year-old but still haven't received it? Write ``applied
for'' beside that child's name where his or her number is called
for on the front of you return.

   If government calculations are correct and you
are an ``average'' taxpayer, it will take you 13 hours and 58
minutes to complete a basic Form 1040 and a Schedule A for itemized
deductions.
   Chances are that if you make $30,000 a year and your most exotic
investment is a certificate of deposit at your neighborhood bank,
you will find those estimates unrealistic. The same might be said
for a millionaire with a lot of investment interest and a number of
stock trades.
   Useless as the exercise may be, the IRS is required by the White
House Office of Management and Budget to estimate the time needed
to fill out each tax form.
   The shortest time is required for the single-page Form 1040EZ,
which is available only to single people with taxable income under
$50,000. IRS estimates such a taxpayer will spend 5 minutes keeping
records, 18 minutes learning about the form, 30 minutes preparing
it and 27 minutes copying the form and mailing it to the IRS.
   A filer of Form 1040A and Schedule 1 (for child-care benefits)
will spend 9 hours 10 minutes on average.
   The most arduous task faces the farmer, who must file Schedule F
with 1040. Assuming that farmer also files Schedule A to itemize
deductions, the investment in time will total 30 hours and 5
minutes.

   If you expect a tax refund and want it as soon
as possible, electronic filing may be for you.
   The Internal Revenue Service promises a refund in about two
weeks if you let the IRS deposit the check directly into your bank
account. You can get the check in the mail in about three weeks.
   It can take as long as eight weeks for the IRS to process an
old-fashioned paper return, authorize a refund, and mail the check.
   Electronic filing is available this year to taxpayers in all 50
states. Over 1.2 million taxpayers used the service last year, when
it was offered in 36 states.
   Electronic filing may be used only by taxpayers who are due a
refund. In general, it is available to those who file 1040EZ, 1040A
or 1040 with most of the common schedules and attachments.
   You may complete your return and hire an IRS-authorized
transmission center to send it to the IRS. Or you may pay a
professional to prepare and file your return.
   The IRS will mail your check or deposit it electronically into
your bank account. Or you may elect to let the IRS keep all or part
of the refund to apply against your 1990 liability.
   The IRS likes electronic processing because it saves time and
money and minimizes errors. Paper returns require IRS clerks to
type large amounts of data into computers; just one typo every 100
returns would mean a million errors to find and correct. The manual
paperwork and data processing can take several weeks.
   With electronic filing, data on a return are transmitted over
telephone lines into an IRS computer. The IRS may view the return
on a computer screen or print it on paper. Within two days, the IRS
sends notice that it has received the return and that it is
suitable for processing.

   The search for simplicity is leading more and
more taxpayers to file the single-page Form 1040EZ.
   That is not a wise choice for many taxpayers. You could save
money by filing Form 1040A or the long Form 1040.
   Here are the basic rules:
   1040EZ: Only for single taxpayers who are neither blind nor past
their 65th birthday and had taxable income (after subtracting the
standard deduction and the $2,000 exemption) of less than $50,000.
All the income except up to $400 of interest must have been from
wages, tips or taxable scholarships.
   1040A: For any filing status; same income ceiling as 1040EZ
except you may include interest and dividends up to the $50,000
limit and and unemployment compensation. You may use 1040A and
still claim an Individual Retirement Account deduction, the
child-care credit or the earned-income credit.
   1040: Any taxpayer may use it.
   There are no supplemental forms and schedules for 1040EZ. The
1040A uses only Schedule 1, for interest, dividends and the
child-care credit. Here are some of the most widely used forms and
schedules to accompany 1040; if not included in your tax
instructions, they are available by calling IRS:
   _Schedule C, to report profit or loss from your business.
   _Schedule D, for capital gains and losses.
   _Schedule E, for rent, royalties and partnership income and
expenses.
   _Schedule F, for farm income and expenses.
   _Schedule R, for claiming the credit for elderly or disabled.
   _Schedule SE, to calculate Social Security self-employment tax.
   _Form 2106, for employee business expenses.
   _Form 2119, to report the sale of your home.
   _Form 3903, for job-related moving expenses.
   _Form 4868, to get an automatic four-month extension for time to
file your return, but not to pay any tax owed.
   _Form 8283, to list non-cash charitable contributions that total
more than $500.
   _Form 8606, to report non-deductible contributions to an IRA and
to calculate what portion of any IRA withdrawal is taxable.
   _Form 8615, for calculating the ``kiddie tax'' on children under
age 14 with investment income over $1,000.

   The Internal Revenue Service has a library of
free publications to help you when your questions are not answered
in the basic instructions that accompany your tax forms.
   For example: How do you determine whether you are qualified to
claim the special credit for the elderly or disabled? Ask for
Publication 524.
   Can the losses you encounter in renting out a house shield some
of your wage income from tax, or are they ``passive losses'' that
can shield only passive income. Publication 925 has the answers.
   Publication 17, ``Your Federal Income Tax,'' is the most
comprehensive offered by the IRS; it is a guide to all but the most
complex tax problems.
   A list of the most-used publications is included near the back
of your tax package, along with an address and order form. Among
the publications not listed but also available free:
   _225, a comprehensive guide for farmers.
   _334, a similar guide for small business.
   _526, charitable contributions.
   _527, renting residential property.
   _550, investment income and expenses.
   _552, recordkeeping.
   _584, casualty and theft losses, which includes a handy workbook
for listing all your household goods and other belongings.
   _596, the earned-income credit.
   _909, the alternative minimum tax.
   _910, a guide to free tax services offered by IRS, including all
available publications.
   _919, for determining whether you are having the proper amount
withheld from your wages.
   Perhaps the quickest way to obtain publications is to call the
toll-free telephone number, 1-800-424-3676. Or, write to the
address listed in your instructions.
   The IRS ``Tele-Tax'' system offers tape-recorded general advice
on any of 140 specific topics.
   For example, tape 358 discusses the tax on children's investment
income. No. 219 tells you how to handle gambling income and
expenses. No. 157 details the filing of an amended return.
   The telephone number for your area and a list of the Tele-Tax
tapes are near the back of your tax package.

   Nothing, it's been said, is truer than taxes.
   And, for millions of Americans, the countdown to truth
approaches rapidly. Foreseeing the annual mad scramble to fill out
those pesky forms and get them into the mail just before deadline,
the publishing industry has turned out some books that might make
the complicated less complicated for the taxpayer.
   Here are a few to choose from:
   _ ``J.K. Lasser's Your Income Tax 1990,'' (Simon and Schuster,
$11.95) prepared by the J.K. Lasser Institute. Now in its 54th
year, this tax guide says it ``provides the most complete
information available on new tax laws, IRS rulings and court
decisions affecting 1989 tax returns.'' A companion Lasser volume
is ``Your 60-Minute Tax Return 1990.'' ($8.95.)
   _ Consumer Reports Books annual ``Guide to Income Tax
Preparation.'' ($12.95.) The publisher says the guide is ``designed
for ease of use and to assist readers through every phrase of the
tax preparation.''
   _ ``How To Pay Zero Taxes,'' (Addison-Wesley, $9.95) by Jeff A.
Schnepper. The publisher says the book ``offers every reader,
regardless of tax bracket, hundreds of ways to save on federal
income taxes.''
   _ ``H&amp;R Block 1990 Income Tax Guide'' (Collier Books, $9.95).
The volume is offered as ``a combined reference tool and
line-by-line guide through the 1040 family of forms. This dual
approach allows taxpayers to accomplish two crucial goals:
tax-planning for the year ahead and tax-savings for the year at
hand.''
   _ ``Cut Your Own Taxes and Save 1990,'' (World Almanac, $3.95)
by George W. Smith. Smith is the managing partner of a certified
public accounting firm in Michigan. He ``advises both individual
and corporate taxpayers on the merits of good tax planning (and)
also writes a syndicated tax column.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   No matter what you make, if you're able to put aside anything
for savings, you're proabably in a tax bracket that will make
tax-free municipal bonds attractive, says a specialist in these
issues.
   Michael S. Appelbaum, first vice president at Shearson Lehman
Hutton in New York City, advises wage earners to balance these safe
investments with higher yielding taxable money-market instruments.
   Municipals, he points out, are backed by the taxing power of
cities and states and are among the safest investments around,
second only the U.S. government bonds.
   Appelbaum notes that it doesn't take a huge income to end up in
the top tax brackets. For example, a working couple filing a joint
return of $29,751 net taxable income in New York State (but not
living in New York City, which has its own tax) are in the combined
federal and New York State tax bracket of 33.7 percent. Another
couple in the same locale filing a joint return on $71,901 will be
in the top combined 38.6 percent bracket.
   If you're in that top combined bracket and find an investment
paying 9{ percent, you'll end up with only 5.8 percent after paying
out federal and state taxes on the investment. In contrast, a
municipal bond might pay you 7 or 8 percent, free of both federal
and state taxes.
   ``Throughout the country, even in states without income taxes,
the general rule is that 7 percent to 8 percent tax free in the top
33 percent federal income tax bracket is like 10.4 percent to 11.9
percent from a bank or other taxable investment,'' says Appelbaum.
   He says the ratio between municipal bonds at 8 percent and
taxable Ginnie Maes (from the Government National Mortgage
Association) at 10 percent works out to about 80 percent. ``Even
though the municipal bond ostensibly pays 20 percent less than the
Ginnie Mae, in every tax bracket above 20 percent, the take-home
pay from the municipal bond beats the Ginnie.''
   When choosing a bond, Appelbaum recommends looking at other
factors besides the yield percentage. If you need a bond you can
cash in within a few years instead of letting it mature for 10 or
20 years, you'll have to give up some yield. If you want current
income to live on and the best payout now, then get the bonds with
the highest interest rates, he says. You'll get maximum return on
your savings each time you clip a coupon or receive semiannual
interest, though you may have to pay a premium.
   Appelbaum suggests you consult with your accountant, financial
advisor or broker when picking bonds, so they can recommend buys
based on your needs. Some of the questions you'll be considering:
When do you plan to retire? Do you have heirs? How much are secure
triple-A ratings worth to you in cold cash? Are the bonds to be a
gift? Are they for your children's education? Are they being used
to build up your estate? Are you living on the interest, and will
you leave the principal to your survivors? Should you reduce your
estate and your estate taxes through an orderly invasion of your
capital? When do you need or want your principal back? Do you need
income to live on, spend, or enjoy, or are you in a position to
defer current income and take a big lump sum when bonds mature?
   Appelbaum says resale of bonds before maturity will be affected
by market conditions but points out that municipal bonds assure you
of getting interest all along and your principal at the end.

   In the wake of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, insurance investments
may be among the few which offer safe and substantial tax
advantages.
   Annuities and whole life insurance earn interest for investors
and provide tax-free dividends or tax-deferred growth, says Peter
Goodstein, senior vice president of Kornreich Insurance Services.
He advises investors to include both as long-term investments in
their overall financial plans.
   ``The tax benefits of both whole life insurance and annuities
are hard to duplicate in other long-term investments,'' says
Goodstein. ``Unlike tax-free bonds and mutual funds, the underlying
guaranteed value of insurance products doesn't fluctuate with the
market. So in many ways, it's a safer investment.''
   He points out that whole life insurance lets the investor
accumulate cash which can remain liquid without penalty. And in
addition, his death benefit can be structured so that his
beneficiaries can receive policy proceeds tax free. The cost of
whole life insurance, however, must cover administration costs.
   In contrast, annuities are no-load investments that sometimes
have greater yields than treasuries or bank certificates of
deposit. However, annuities are usually not structured as liquid
assets and carry withdrawal penalties for investors under the age
of 59{. These might include a 10 percent penalty imposed by the
IRS, the proceeds taxed as ordinary income, and a further penalty
by the insurance company.
   Goodstein says that as whole life insurance policies mature,
their cash value and death benefits increase dramatically. He gives
as an example a healthy, non-smoking, 38-year-old male who buys
$250,000 worth of whole life insurance for a premium of $3,253 a
year. Assuming the dividends continue to be paid as projected, in
10 years the policy will have a cash value slightly over the total
premium paid, plus a death benefit over the original $250,000.
After 20 years, the cash value and death benefit will be what
Goodstein terms ``significantly in excess'' of the premium
investment.
   ``To help realize this growth, consumers should never buy a
polity from a life insurance company that is rated less than A&plus; by
A.M. Best &amp; Co.'' he says.
   If the investor chooses a deferred annuity _ one that reinvests
monthly dividends _ $100,000 invested at the age of 45 can come to
$6,000 a month 20 years later, also assuming interest rates stay at
or near current levels. ``In comparing annuity interest rates,
consumers should consider both the historical performance as well
as projected levels.'' Goodstein says.

   If you own your own business, it's critical to map out a
shareholders' agreement to avoid confusion and potentially higher
estate taxes when you die, according to Nahum Gordon, an attorney
and estate planning specialist.
   Gordon, a partner of Moroze Sherman Gordon &amp; Gordon, a New
York-based law firm, says that without such an agreement in place,
surviving family members won't have a clear idea of how long they
can draw your salary or how to cash in on the value of your shares.
   Other shareholders _ who may not be ready to buy out the shares
but want to minimize the payout _ may not want your surviving
spouse or children as partners in the business.
   Then there's uncertainty among employees, creditors and banks,
who don't know what will happen next.
   And in the absence of an agreement, the Internal Revenue Service
can claim a high value _ and subsequent higher estate taxes _ on
the shares. Some of the factors IRS is likely to look at include
the type and history of the business; the economic outlook and the
role of the specific industry involved; the earning and
dividend-paying capacities of your company; an assessment of good
will or other intangibles; stock sales and the size of the block of
stock to be valued; and typical market prices of stocks of similar
businesses whose shares are publicly traded.
   Gordon says there is no standard form of shareholders'
agreements, but six major issues need to be considered when drawing
one up:
   _ Whether your spouse or children will remain as shareholders,
or if shares owned by the estate can be purchased. You need to
judge if surviving family members can function effectively in the
business and if other partners are amenable to your family's
participation.
   _ An established price _ or the method of arriving at one _ for
your shares should you decide that your spouse and children will
not remain as shareholders, so that these shares can be bought in
``arm's length'' transactions.
   _ Potential technical difficulties in tax, estate and corporate
laws. Resolve these in advance instead of leaving them to be dealt
with under settlement pressure after your death.
   _ Additional benefits for your family if the proceeds of share
sales won't meet their needs. These can be in form of insurance,
deferred compensation plans, or limited salary continuation plans.
   _ Adequate insurance to enable stock purchasers _ either family
or the company _ to complete a buyout of the shares as spelled out
in the agreement.
   _ Advance approval by banks or other third-party institutions
whose consent will be needed to purchase or sell your shares after
your death.
   Gordon says that the agreed purchase price usually will be
conclusive except in some circumstances among closely-related
parties.

   Lillian Goldberg spent 15 years as a teacher
and administrator in New York City schools, but developed her
deepest relationships with students after she retired.
   ``For the first time in my life, I've been able to work with
them on a one-on-one basis and to help them follow their
interests,'' Mrs. Goldberg, 70, said of her work with youngsters in
Florida. ``It opens up vistas of knowledge for me and I see the
blossoming of the children.''
   In Saugus, Mass., 70-year-old James Brennan's work helping young
toughs get jobs and stay out of trouble keeps him going in his own
battle against cancer.
   ``Undoubtedly this program has something to do with my mental
and physical health,'' Brennan said. ``I would hate to think that
when one becomes a certain age they're disposable. That thought
always plagued me.''
   In Ann Arbor, Mich., 61-year-old Nancy Perkins works with junior
high schoolers who need a listening ear or a push with their
homework.
   ``You feel like you're doing something rather than sitting home
wringing your hands about the dropout rate,'' Mrs. Perkins said.
   ``The whole idea of linking youth and elders is really gaining a
lot of momentum,'' said Nancy Henkin, director of the Center for
Intergenerational Learning at Temple University's Institute on
Aging. ``People are finally realizing that these are two groups
that should get together.''
   With the elderly making up the fastest-growing segment of
society and the number of at-risk youth at 12 million and growing,
intergenerational match-ups are ``something whose time has come,''
Henkin said.
   One of the latest such ideas is mentoring, in which older
Americans are paired with youngsters in one-on-one relationships.
Mentoring is distinguished from other intergenerational programs by
development of deeper relationships between the adults and
youngsters who need unconditional love, encouragement and strong
role models. Children who succeed against long odds often are those
who have developed meaningful relationships with adults, Henkin
said.
   Temple this month launched a $3 million Linking Lifetimes
program, financed by five foundations, that will help nine
communities set up mentoring projects pairing older people with
young offenders and troubled youth. The mentors, paid a small
stipend, will spend at least two hours a week helping their
partners with school, job and life decisions.
   In Springfield, Mass., for example, retirees will help offenders
aged 14-17 finish school and steer clear of drugs and crime. The
mentors are in a unique position to help because they're neither
parents nor professionals, said John Tansey, director of the
project there. ``These elders don't have to prove anything to the
kids. They're there just for these kids and to listen.''
   In Memphis, Tenn., Linking Lifetimes will pair low-income older
women with pregnant seventh- and eighth-graders. Director Jane
Watkins sees it as a boon for the girls and mentors and a way to
prevent abuse and neglect of the babies.
   Other Linking Lifetimes programs are being launched in Los
Angeles; Miami; St. Petersburg, Fla.; Birmingham and Montgomery,
Ala.; Hartford, Conn.; and Syracuse, N.Y. The results will be
evaluated by the California Research Center and Public-Private
Ventures, a non-profit corporation based in Philadelphia that
designs and evaluates social policy programs.
   Existing mentoring programs show promising results, but there
has been little research on their effectiveness, Henkin said.
   While intergenerational mentoring programs are on the increase,
projects matching seniors with troubled youths are rarer, said
Sandra Sweeney, of the American Association of Retired Persons.
``For the right kind of person it's a terrific experience, but
there are more barriers to working with at-risk youth.
   ``They may not share some of the same backgrounds or know how to
approach kids who may have been in trouble.''
   One success story is the Work Connection, based in Saugus,
Mass., in which retirees, paid a weekly salary based on caseload,
help young offenders find and hold jobs as an alternative to jail.
Over the past four years, more than 350 people have ``graduated''
from the program.
   ``It's amazing how the relationship evolves and develops,'' said
director Kelly Quinlan. ``It never really stops because our
participants still keep in touch with their mentors. They've made a
permanent friend.''
   Jack Petrolopoulos, former coordinator of the program, said one
match paired a tough Greek immigrant with a 19-year-old offender,
Steve, who had been arrested for a variety of crimes. The mentor,
Nick, never gave up _ even though Steve went through a string of
jobs and even stole a watch from another mentor, Joe, and denied
it. Nick would see Steve several times a week, work with his
employers, and sometimes even roust him from bed and drive him to
work.
   Steve eventually became a reliable employee and avoided further
arrests, prompting a judge to give him a suspended two-year
sentence for his earlier offenses. Perhaps as significantly, Steve
presented a new watch to Joe and told Nick: ``I know I've never
said this, but I don't know where I'd be if it wasn't for you guys.
I can't tell you how much I appreciate what you've done for me.''
   Brennan, a former fire chief, has worked with about 65 young
adults through the Work Connection in the past five years, more
than half successfully. Along with the successes, however, come the
frustrations when someone lets him down.
   ``You'll have a couple clients that are doing real well and then
you'll pick up the daily paper and find out that one of them has
committed an armed robbery,'' he said. ``I get terribly
disappointed and frustrated. It's almost as though they're one of
your own family.''
   In Michigan, Ann Arbor's TLC program _ Teaching-Learning
Communities _ arranges for senior mentors to meet at school each
week with junior high school students who are in danger of dropping
out or having other problems.
   Youngsters tell their mentors, ``just the fact that you're here
in this room gives me courage,'' said Carol Tice, who directs the
program. Elders, meanwhile, ``know that their life has made a
difference.''
   One mentor helped an angry and withdrawn 12-year-old girl relate
well to her peers and jump three years in reading skills. Another
was able to steer a bright 15-year-old girl into counseling after
suicide themes started cropping in creative writing projects she
did for him.
   Sixty-five-year-old Elly Strauch, a TLC mentor for nearly three
years, said she gets more from the program than she gives. ``I've
always loved teaching. To be able to get back to it after
retirement was really luckier than I ever thought I'd be. They're
never going to dislodge me from TLC.''
   In Florida, the Senior Mentors for Creative Students program
started in Broward County in 1982 and has spread to 22 districts.
Senior volunteers are paired with students with common interests
who need additional challenges.
   Mrs. Goldberg, the retired New York educator, helped a Broward
County grade schooler research space law by visiting courthouses
and judges, and the girl later expressed interest in becoming a
lawyer.
   ``To help a youngster realize their own potential for creativity
and their own ability to do something,'' Mrs. Goldberg said,
``That's the wonder of it.''

<HEAD>`Oldest Living Person' Record Tantalizes, Fascinates</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Of all the feats in the Guinness Book of World Records, being
the ``Oldest Living Person'' is perhaps the most tantalizing and
the most open to dispute.
   Everyone, after all, is a potential contestant.
   And nearly everyone, at some point, has yearned for the honor.
   ``No single subject is more obscured by vanity, deceit,
falsehood and deliberate fraud than the extremes of human
longevity,'' the Guinness editors assert, noting hundreds of claims
of people over 100 and some, ``insulting to the intelligence,'' of
people living into their third centuries.
   Yet few claims are harder to prove than extreme longevity _
after all, no one else who's alive today was alive when the oldest
old were born.
   That is true of Carrie White of Palatka, Fla., and Jackson
Pollock of Milledgeville, Ga. The 1990 Guinness Book recognizes
Miss White as the oldest, at 115. But since that book went to
press, Pollock has emerged with the claim that he is 123. Guinness
is still awaiting proof.
   The ages of these living ancients raise interesting questions.
   How do we know they're the oldest? Do they give us the hope of
immortality? A window into our past? Or are they like circus
freaks, fascinating only because they are so different, so extreme?
   Aside from the question of proof, longevity experts say the
answers are all ``Yes.'' Mainly, people like the idea of someone
cheating death.
   ``Nobody wants to stare at death. It's one way to confront death
_ to consider not confronting it,'' said Dr. Richard Sprott,
associate director for biomedical research and clinical medicine at
the National Institute on Aging.
   In Carrie White's case, there is fairly persuasive evidence she
is 115; the search for Pollock's past is fascinating but as yet
inconclusive.
   Miss White lives at the Putnam Memorial Nursing Home, where she
likes to attend church and song sessions. She is in good health,
though she doesn't seem to understand the fuss over her age and
refuses to talk about her past.
   Hers is not a happy story, from what little is known. She is
said to have been born Nov. 18, 1874, in Gadsden County, Fla. As a
young woman, she married John White, who was either a blacksmith or
a farmer, and on the day after her 35th birthday, in 1909, he
committed her to the Florida State Hospital for the mentally ill at
Chattahoochee. Her diagnosis was ``post-typhoid psychosis,'' and
she remained there until she was, according to her records, 110.
   Miss White's claim to longevity rests mainly on her medical
records, which are unusual since they span so much of her life. The
only possibility for fraud would be if she or her husband had lied
about her age when she was committed _ a possibility, certainly,
but one Guinness considers unlikely.
   There is no similar documentation for Jackson Pollock's life.
Pollock, a tall, gangly man with a taste for Prince Albert tobacco
and soul food, says he was born Christmas Day 1866, served in the
Spanish-American War and World War I and loaded mail and checked
railroad baggage in Cleveland and New York.
   He has lived in the Central State Hospital in Milledgeville
since 1972.
   Alyce Friend, of the Georgia Office of Aging, has been preparing
a report for Guinness. She has found tantalizing tidbits, but no
proof.
   The strongest documentation is Pollock's 1966 Social Security
application, which lists his birthdate Dec. 25, 1869 _ which would
make him three years younger than his hospital records but still
the world's oldest person.
   But Social Security records can be based largely on the
applicant's word, and are considered unreliable by longevity
experts. So for now, Pollock's claim is based almost solely on his
own account.
   Ms. Friend, for one, believes him, and calls him ``an
inspiration.'' She attributes his longevity to strong genes and
self-satisfaction.
   Guinness, for now, remains doubtful, said Editor Donald McFarlan.
   The book lists Shigechiyo Izumi of Japan as the person who lived
to the oldest age ever documented _ 120 years, 237 days, based on
census records.
   But even that documentation isn't good enough for some
scientists, who say it's just too unlikely that a human being could
live that long.
   ``I don't know a single serious gerontologist in the world who
believes these claims of people who are over 115,'' said Dr.
Leonard Hayflick, professor of anatomy at the University of
California at San Francisco.
   From time to time, claims have surfaced of extraordinary groups
of people who have lived well into their 130s, 140s, 150s and
higher. One such group was said to live in the Caucasus Mountains
of the Soviet Union; another in a remote area of Ecuador. In each
case, experts say, the claims proved to be lies. The motives vary,
but include draft dodging, national pride, tourism and simple
boastfulness.
   Scientists say it again and again: Humans just aren't built to
last that long. And they dismiss the notion that the human lifespan
is getting longer.
   Life expectancy is another matter _ it has risen dramatically
since the turn of the century as nutrition and medical care have
improved. But while more people are getting closer to the maximum
possible lifespan, the span itself is unchanged, Hayflick said.
``As far as we know, the human lifespan ... has not changed in the
past 100,000 years.''
   So we're left with the claims of Carrie White and Jackson
Pollock, and the thought that more people in the future will live
long beyond the biblical span of threescore years and 10 _ which
after all is only 70.
   ``I think there will be a time when 100 years old will be very
common,'' said Dr. Edward Schneider, dean of the Andrus Gerontology
Research Center at the University of Southern California. ``I don't
know about 110, but 100 will be common.''
   Beyond that, gerontologists say, what's the point? We all want
eternal youth, but do we really want eternal age? The very old, the
experts say, are rarely as interested in immortality as are younger
people.
   Florence Knapp of Philadelphia lived to 114 and was, for a time,
considered the world's oldest person.
   ``I think she could never understand why she was allowed to live
so long,'' her niece, Ruth Oberholtzer, said after her death. ``One
time she said that she feels like she might have been bad and this
was God's way of punishing her.''

   It's hard to know what to expect when
you're being ushered into a hospital ward to meet The Oldest Man In
The World.
   You fear he'll be in worse shape than the other patients, that
you'll be intruding.
   Nope.
   Jackson Pollock, who claims to be 123, is 6-foot-9 with cottony
white hair. He's a healthy man, especially for someone who's 123.
He likes starched shirts, hearty breakfasts and smoking a pipe,
detests the hospital where he lives and chats happily with people
who stop by to see him.
   He even has his jokes down pat.
   How old are you, Mr. Pollock?
   ``I'm 510 now,'' he says.
   The Guinness Book of World Records lists Carrie White of
Palatka, Fla., as the ``Oldest Living Person,'' at 115. Pollock
insists he's eight years older.
   Alyce Friend, of the state Office on Aging, has tried to
document his history, with limited success. The search wasn't
helped by some confusion over his name; at some point after his
arrival at Central State, his records somehow were changed to
``Jackson Pollard,'' a mistake only recently realized.
   Pollock has no birth certificate; not many blacks born in rural
Georgia two years after the Civil War got one. The Social Security
Administration lists his birthday as Dec. 25, 1869, but Pollock
insists it's really 1866. Either would make him the oldest human,
but longevity experts say Social Security records can be based
largely on a person's word and are considered unreliable.
   Pollock says he was one of the oldest of 13 siblings, born on a
farm near Hawkinsville in central Georgia. At that time, census
records listed only a few black citizens there, those working the
farms of white landowners.
   Department of Human Resource staffers found several people who
recalled a large black family named Pollock near Finlayson, near
where he says they lived. And records show a James Pollock _
presumably the father _ bought land in 1857.
   Ms. Friend believes Pollock, and has submitted everything she
could find to Guinness officials. Guinness, for now, remains
doubtful.
   Pollock doesn't much care.
   Asked if he thinks his age is any big deal, he just shakes his
head. After all, he says, his mother lived 107 years, his father 99.
   He's more opinionated about other things.
   Pollock likes the people who care for him, but Central State
Hospital ``is the worst place in the United States.'' Many other
men in its Long Term Care unit can't get around or are unstable,
and he keeps mostly to himself.
   Pollock was brought to Central State against his will 17 years
ago. He was living near Dublin in central Georgia when some
neighbors told the sheriff they didn't think he should live alone
anymore. It's said he chased some people away with a shotgun,
fearing they were after his Social Security check.
   ``He's only here because there's nowhere else for him to go,''
said Smithie Thomas Abrams, a hospital spokesman. Pollock has no
living relatives.
   He never had children, never had a wife. ``I had a good time
without being married. I just stayed home with my people.''
   With his birthday just last month, Pollock has been visited by
several news reporters. ``It's nice when people come down and meet
you,'' he said. ``It's good enjoyment.''
   Pollock spent most of his working years on the railroads. He was
in the Army during the Spanish-American War and again during World
War I, when he went to England and Germany. He was already retired
when Social Security began, but was ``grandfathered'' in. It's
about the only support he has.
   Ms. Friend says she has found no records of his military
service, but many Army records from the time were lost to fire. It
also isn't known if the black soldiers, who were relegated to
menial chores, were listed with white soldiers.
   In his younger days, Pollock enjoyed going to church about as
much as anything. ``I'd sit down and enjoy myself; it's the best
fun you can have.''
   He loathes hospital food, but every day enjoys a special
breakfast of two eggs, two pieces of sausage, two helpings of grits
and two cups of scalding hot coffee. ``I drink it barefooted. No
cream, no sugar.''
   He never drank, but says he's smoked for 117 years _ Prince
Albert tobacco only, please. He wears crisply starched khakis and
silk socks and spends most of his days _ and nights _ reclining in
his big leather easy chair.
   And no, he doesn't have any arcane tips on how to live to be 123.
   ``Trust in God, and he'll pull you through. Just trust in God.''

<HEAD>Automakers Cater to Today's and Tomorrow's Elderly Drivers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Large digital instruments are in and tiny buttons
are out as aging drivers command more attention from automakers as
they design and market cars for a swelling segment of the driving
population.
   The number of licensed drivers over 65 grew by 45 percent, from
14.3 million in September 1978 to 20.8 million in September 1988,
according to the most recent figures from the Federal Highway
Administration. Older drivers account for 12.7 percent of the total
licensed drivers on the road.
   That's a market segment automakers can't ignore.
   ``I think it will be one of the greatest opportunities that
they've got,'' said Jim Wangers, president of Automotive Marketing
Consultants Inc. of Vista, Calif.
   Reflecting the importance of the market, Chrysler Corp. decided
to switch the bulk of its undisclosed advertising budget for
Chrysler cars to print from broadcast media, in part to attract
older buyers, said Jim Jandasek, manager of Chrysler-Plymouth
national advertising. ``Print, with the media consumption patterns
of the mature market, is going to deliver more of those people.''
   About 70 percent of Chrysler brand advertising is dedicated to
print media, dramatically more than other automakers. A key reason
for buying more print ads this year was because advertising the
engineering features of 1990 model Chryslers is more suited to
print than broadcast, Jandasek said.
   Advertising for General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are
along more traditional, broadcast-oriented lines. Print ads for
full-size cars, the most popular among senior citizens, are
targeted at media reaching those consumers.
   Advertising, however, is irrelevant if the product doesn't suit
the buyer. And that goes for any age.
   Automakers are carefully watching trends as the ``baby
boomers,'' born in the late 1940s and early '50s, mature. The look
of American cars popular with older drivers is changing with them.
   When Ford introduced a redesigned Lincoln Town Car in August,
traditional hard edges on the fenders, the bumpers and the roof
were gone.
   Chrysler will be smoothing out its cars targeted for senior
citizens in a few years. For now, it is sticking with a proven
winner with older drivers.
   During the introduction of the 1990 Imperial, a squared-off
full-size car, Chrysler executives said they were aiming the car at
a loyal segment of the market that shuns rounder, less
traditional-looking cars.
   That will change in the mid-1990s when the company introduces
cars made with smoother lines offered on some Ford and GM cars of
today.
   The changes are inside, too.
   Dave Rees, interior design director for Ford, said research is
telling him what older people want. ``If we think about the mature
driver, the primary area would be ergonomics _ the layout of
controls, the location of controls and the ease of operation,'' he
said.
   ``They have very set tastes,'' Wangers said, ``and I think they
are going to be very difficult to get off of their traditional
thinking.''
   Many of those senior-oriented features are obvious _
wide-swinging doors; a minimum number of buttons, switches and
knobs; and familiar location of some controls, especially headlight
switches.
   One recent development has caught on with senior citizens:
``Mature drivers tend to prefer the large, easy-to-read electronic
clusters,'' Rees said.
   Don Massey, owner of Don Massey Cadillac Inc., in Plymouth,
Mich., says he likes the big displays on the Cadillac Brougham.
   ``I'm 61 years of age and for the first time in my life, I've
wondered why numbers on telephones aren't larger,'' Massey said.
``I think the psychological impact of the larger readout on the
Brougham is welcome to the older driver.''
   The Brougham, the longest of all Cadillacs, has a larger digital
speedometer display than other models.

<HEAD>New Service Opens World of Television to Blind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED BRIDIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TULSA, Okla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For millions of visually impaired Americans,
televisions are little more than over-sized radios _ worse, really,
because of Hollywood's heavy reliance on visual images to propel
plots.
   ``I'm about as totally blind as you can get,'' says Dale Lamar,
vice president of a support group for the blind in Oklahoma. ``Most
shows I can keep up with fairly well. But when you get into an
action show with lots of car chases and shootings, you end up
missing half the show.''
   But imagine a TV show where narrative is sprinkled between the
dialogue, describing the stealthy movements of a murderer, the
outcome of a chase. That's the vision of Jim Stovall, president of
Narrative Television Network.
   ``I started losing my sight when I was 17,'' Stovall said. ``I'm
31 now and totally blind. About a year and a half ago, I was
watching an old Bogart film and somebody shot somebody else and I
was lost. ... I thought with a little bit of narration, this could
work. It just kind of exploded on us.''
   The network's programs have been shown at 11 a.m. and 11 p.m.
EST every Sunday since Aug. 20. They can be seen on the Nostalgia
Channel, available in about 7 million homes, and on independent
stations in 500 cable markets. The narrated network uses
Nostalgia's production facilities in Dallas.
   Nostalgia Network Inc., which sees its prime market as older
viewers, is a natural partner for NTN. Demographers say 60 percent
of the 11.4 million visually impaired Americans are older than 45.
   ``We feel that narrative television has enhanced our value as a
cable channel,'' said Joe Schramm, Nostalgia marketing director.
``The cable operator has a commitment to the community to provide a
service, and this certainly is a service.''
   There are few advertisers, in part because Nostalgia broadcasts
movies uninterrupted. ``We are just now approaching some national
advertisers,'' said Stovall. ``Adapting commercials isn't as big a
problem as people would think. A lot of radio commericals are just
television commercials without the picture.''
   He has won support from such Hollywood legends as Kirk Douglas,
Katharine Hepburn and Charlton Heston, and has been praised by
cable magnate Ted Turner, important since Turner acquired the
rights to the MGM Library. Currently, the network narrates public
domain films or those to which Nostalgia has acquired rights. Last
month, it broadcast Frank Capra's ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
   ``The way we narrate these programs,'' Stovall said, ``is to try
and determine what is important and present that to you as
unobtrusively as possible without interjecting our opinion.''
   In the premier narrated episode of ``Matlock,'' featuring Andy
Griffith as an Atlanta lawyer, a man stalks a young woman and stabs
her to death. The first dialogue, though, comes minutes into the
plot _ after the stabbing and just before the woman's boyfriend is
arrested in her death.
   The narration fills the void:
   ``The silver-haired man pulls a long knife from its holder,''
the narrator says. ``His face is drenched with sweat. ... As the
young man showers, the silver-haired man enters the bedroom holding
the knife.
   ``The young woman stirs awake, sees him and begins to scream. He
puts his hand over her mouth. He stabs her.''
   Lamar, who rented the episode on videotape, said that until the
narrated version, the show was difficult to follow. ``There's
nothing but music for the first three minutes or so. If it wouldn't
have had the narration, I would've missed the fact that Dick Van
Dyke was the killer.''
   While the network is a boon to the blind, supporters point to
another group sure to benefit, Schramm said. ``It's also for the
visually impaired who have a spouse or family members or loved ones
whose lives have been taxed or tied to the visually impaired
because they had to interpret these shows.''
   The Narrative Television Network is a spin-off of Narrative
Video Network, a 1988 innovation that coupled narration with
popular TV series on videotape.
   ``We did `Matlock,' `Big Valley,' `Andy Griffith,' `Gomer Pyle,'
'' Stovall said. ``The response was so huge, we couldn't get enough
tapes out or do enough to keep everybody happy.''
   Response to NTN is difficult to express, he said. ``The reaction
has been very emotional. If you've never seen television _ it's
very difficult for someone like yourself to understand _ to be able
to sit and watch television is a very emotional experience for most
people.''

   Here is a sample of the narrative from the
Narrative Television Network's premiere of ``Matlock,'' starring
Andy Griffith:
   ``Our story opens in a high-rise building. A young man and woman
stand in a darkened bedroom kissing passionately.
   ``A silver-haired man in a business suit stands across the
street viewing the couple through binoculars. He puts the
binoculars down and walks across an empty living room.
   ``Episode Entitled `The Judge.'
   ``He puts on a raincoat, a tweed hat and sunglasses. The
silver-haired man walks out of the building. He uses a key to enter
the back door of the other building.''
   Sound of a door closing.
   ``The young couple in bed: The silver-haired man, no longer
wearing the sunglasses, pulls on black gloves and walks along a
hallway.
   ``He uses a key to enter the apartment, steps inside, closes the
door and pauses to take a breath.''
   Suspenseful music.
   ``In the kitchen, the silver-haired man pulls a long knife from
its holder. His face is drenched with sweat. The young couple lie
in bed kissing.
   ``The silver-haired man holding the knife waits.
   ``The young man kisses the young woman. He leaves the bed and
enters the bathroom.
   ``As the young man showers, the silver-haired man enters the
bedroom holding the knife. The young woman stirs awake, sees him
and begins to scream. He puts his hand over her mouth.
   ``He stabs her. She falls limp.
   ``The young man continues to shower.
   ``In the hall outside the apartment, the silver-haired man, no
longer wearing the tweed hat and overcoat, sets down a brown
garbage bag. He uses his handkerchief to pick up a phone.''
   ``Lobby, Hobson speaking.''
   ``Get up to 1102 right away. There's a woman screaming for help.
Something terrible has happened. Hurry.''
   ``He hangs up the phone.
   ``The young man walks out of the shower, sees a bloody knife on
the floor in the bedroom. He bends down and picks it up. He sees
the young woman covered with blood.''
   Sound of a doorbell.
   ``A security guard uses his key to enter the apartment. He sees
the young man holding the bloody knife and the young woman's
lifeless body.
   ``The young man drops the knife.''

lifestyle cookbook ``Eating Well When You Just Can't Eat the Way
You Used To,'' Workman Publishing.

   As a child, believing in magic, I thought if I
wrote down New Year's resolutions it was the same as doing them.
``Don't talk back to your grandmother, brush your teeth, practice
the piano every day after school...''
   As adults, the same belief in magic may hold true, especially
when it comes to resolutions involving health and fitness. Go on a
strict diet! Get to a gym! Such promises often are made as we reach
for a third chocolate mocha truffle or savor a second piece of Aunt
Sara's Oyster Loaf while watching the bowl games.
   There's no doubt few of us get through the holidays without
overdoing. But there are other occasions for splurging: birthdays,
bar mitzvahs, anniversaries, travel, a favorite restaurant...
   Do we go on the teeter-totter route of dieting, then putting the
weight back on? Or do we develop a new style of eating that
maintains a healthy weight over a lifetime, even when metabolism
slows and it is easier to gain weight and harder to lose it _ a way
of eating that allows for special times to splurge and makes every
day the occasion for feasting lightly.
   My solution is not to deprive ourselves of good food. That never
works. It is simply to change portions and proportions.
   Choose two-thirds of your food from the Vegetable Kingdom _
grains, beans, vegetables and fruits, abounding in color, variety,
vitamins and minerals _ and one-third from the Animal Kingdom:
meat, fish, fowl and dairy products, with more calories from fat
and cholesterol.
   By becoming aware of this simple formula when we plan meals and
shop, the healthful balance is achieved without having to count
calories, a resolution that soon goes by the board.
   Following are three recipes that use this formula, one you can
easily adapt in your own cooking.

<HEAD>Catalog Time's Here _ Sit Back, Enjoy the Wonders</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: George Bria retired from the AP in 1981 after 40
years that included coverage of World War II from Italy.

<DATELINE>POUND RIDGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's catalog time for gardeners, the
season to sit back and enjoy this year's parade of matchless
wonders and breeding triumphs.
   I once needed only one catalog to fuel my dreams. Now I've
gotten choosy, leafing through a half-dozen before I decide which
tomatoes, beans and lettuce will grace my garden come summer.
   There's a catalog for everyone, some quite artistically
illustrated, and you learn where to look for special things. The
Tomato Growers Supply Co., of Fort Myers, Fla., for example, offers
170 tomato varieties plus 41 peppers.
   For a foreign touch, numerous catalogs will bring Europe or the
Orient to your backyard _ among them, Thompson &amp; Morgan, of
Jackson, N.J.; The Cook's Garden, of Londonderry, Vt.; and
Shepherd's Garden Seeds, of Felton, Calif.
   Not to be outdone, such a venerable seed house as W. Atlee
Burpee &amp; Co., of Warminster, Pa., now has an international
vegetable section in its catalog.
   A catalog buff can unlock the gate to just about anything in a
wide-ranging volume by Barbara J. Barton of San Francisco,
``Gardening by Mail.'' Published by Tusker Press, it lists more
than 1,200 nurseries and seed companies and more than 300 garden
supply and service companies in the United States and Canada,
indexed by plant, product and location.
   For some of us, nothing equals nurturing our own tomato plants
from tiny seeds to fruit-laden glory. But we're becoming a
diminished breed. More and more are foregoing the seed catalogs and
opting for ready-to-go plants.
   Much gets sacrificed in this choice. Variety, of course,
suffers. But the joy of gardening itself seems diminished. To a
purist, growing from purchased plants is like painting from
numbers, putting a roll in the pianola or wearing snap-on bow ties.
   Pure snobbery, you might say, with more than a little
justification. The nursery-acquired plant still needs tender loving
care _ fertilizing, weeding, watering.
   Experts familiar with gardening trends see many causes behind
the phenomenon. Nona Koivula, executive director of the National
Garden Bureau in Willowbrook, Ill., which promotes gardening from
seed, says time-saving is a prime reason for picking up a
flourishing flat at the nursery instead of a seed packet. In
tomatoes, you save three months of work by buying plants ready to
set in the ground.
   Also, home vegetable gardens have shrunk dramatically in size. A
Gallup poll for the National Gardening Association, of Burlington,
Vt., showed the typical plot nowadays reduced to 200 square feet
from 595 square feet 10 years ago. Trimmed-down gardens just don't
have room for multiple varieties.
   And the number of vegetable gardens also declined, from 33
million to 31 million. In the 1980s, ``people found there were more
bullish investments than a vegetable plot in the backyard,'' the
association's magazine said.
   Whether the garden is small or large, tomatoes remain the
overwhelmingly favorite crop, followed by peppers, onions,
cucumbers, beans, lettuce, carrots, corn, radishes and cabbages,
the poll showed. Curiously, broccoli, a powerhouse nutritionally
and easy to grow, doesn't rank at all in backyard popularity.
   Every year, catalogs abound in new and improved varieties, each
introduced with a drumroll of amiable hype. Breeders appear to be
concentrating on disease resistance, with more and more maladies
conquered by stalwart new entries.
   People who think flavor is bred out this way can find seedhouses
that specialize in heirloom varieties. Or scan seed-swapping
sections of gardening magazines on the chance of discovering an
old-time favorite offered for trade.
   Now and then, studying the catalogs produces a winner. A couple
years ago, I found a broccoli called ``Romanesco,'' which takes a
long time to mature but climaxes in a glorious chartreuse head,
cauliflower texture and great taste.
   You won't see it in the supermarket and it's not likely to show
up at the nursery. You've got to raise it from seed. But it's not
really ``new.'' A bit of research showed it's an heirloom Italian
variety just now appearing in U.S. catalogs.

<HEAD>Divorce Could Leave Many Older Women Poorer Than Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A greater share of elderly women will be
divorcees in future years and they generally will have fewer
financial resources than older women who are married or widowed,
researchers say.
   ``Older women living outside marriage, especially those who are
divorced, experience much lower standards of living than married
women,'' Teresa Cooney, Peter Uhlenberg, and Robert Boyd, of the
University of North Carolina, reported in the January issue of the
Journal of Gerontology: Social Sciences. Divorcees are less likely
to have owned their own homes, have fewer assets to fall back on
and may lose assets accumulated during years of marriage, they said.
   A historical study of divorce rates indicates that a much larger
proportion of those reaching old age in the future will have been
divorced, they said.
   One woman in eight will have her first marriage end in divorce
after she reaches 40, with the probability of remarriage after
divorce declining sharply with age, the study said. In 1985, for
example, fewer than 3 out of 100 divorced women aged 45 to 64
remarried during the year.
   ``If current rates persist, only a minority of women who enter
midlife divorced, or who divorce after midlife, will ever
remarry,'' Uhlenberg, Cooney and BoydWhile espousing free trade and open
markets, the president also
promised ``to maintain a safety net to protect farmers from
conditions beyond their control.''
   The president promised Florida farmers they can count on the
federal government's help in recovering from the ``terrible loss''
of their citrus and winter vegetable crop from last month's freeze.
``You won't be doing it alone,'' he said.
   Bush said farmers have bounced back from trying times in the
1980s, with help from the 1985 farm legislation that led to lower
federal crop subsidies and more land in production.
   ``Surpluses have declined dramatically, and most of of good land
has been brought back into production,'' he said. ``Net farm income
reached a record level last year. ... The farm credit situation has
greatly improved, bringing more financial stability to rural
America.''
   But Bush added that market-oriented farm policies ``are only a
part of the agricultural picture. We've got to expand markets and
enhance productivity. We've got to assure the public that America's
food is the safest in the world, and we've got to protect our
precious environment.''
   ``We must recognize that productive agriculture and a sound
environment can be compatible, especially in terms of water
quality,'' the president said.
   The administration has already initiated a five-year effort to
protect groundwater from contamination by fertilizers and
pesticides running off farms, he said.
   ``We must keep your good land in business _ without unreasonable
burdens _ but we must also keep it good land,'' he said. ``I am
counting on your leadership as we work to expand farm productivity
while safeguarding the environment.''
   Without giving details, Bush said the administration also is
drafting legislation ``to protect the food supply without
overwhelming the agriculture industry.''
   He noted that farmers have a major stake in U.S. efforts to
foster free trade, including its recent ``bold proposal in the
Uruguay Round'' of international trade talks that would phase out
export-subsidies in five years and other trade-distorting practices
in 10 years.
   ``Any agreement we sign will be an agreement that's also good
for American agriculture,'' he promised.
   Bush toured high-tech agriculture and ocean exhibits at Walt
Disney's Epcot Center nearby before his return to Washington.
   The trip was Bush's first public appearance since ex-Panamanian
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega surrendered last Wednesday to face
trial in the United States on drug-trafficking charges.
   It comes as U.S. officials acknowledged they are having ``some
difficulties' arranging an increased role for the U.S. military in
the Caribbean off the coast of Colombia to help intercept drug
smugglers' sea and air routes.
   Bush, asked Sunday as he went jogging about reports that the
aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy and other ships were steaming
toward Colombia, said, ``I will address myself ... to that question
at a future date.''
   When a reporter suggested that Colombian officials were upset,
Bush said, ``We don't know all that.''
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft said discussions with
Colombian authorities have not begun, and White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said today: ``I think the problem is we haven't
had a chance here to really explore it with them.''
   However, Bogota's El Tiempo published a communique Sunday by the
government of President Virgilio Barco that said the Colombian
``government has not participated, nor will it participate, in any
joint operation with United States military forces, air or naval,
in the Caribbean Sea.''
   ``In international waters it has not participated, nor will it,
and in territorial waters it has not authorized (the operations),
nor is it considering authorizing them,'' the statement added.

denied ``with all my heart and soul'' that he used a tax-sharing
arrangement at his Lincoln Savings and Loan Association to siphon

   The arrangement between the now-collapsed thrift and its holding

   The court ruled Friday against the State Government Insurance
Commission, which had asked the court to appoint a provisional
liquidator for Bond Corp. on the grounds that the company
controlled by financier Alan Bond was insolvent.
   A judge ruled that the insurance commission had failed to prove
its claim.

   Socialism is not to blame for China's poverty,
and the nation will eventually triumph over its capitalist rivals,
the Communist Party daily newspaper said.
   The lengthy commentary Friday in the People's Daily came less
than a month after a small group of university students, in a bold
gesture of dissent, unfurled a banner in front of the state
television station reading ``Motherland, why are you so poor?''
   It is also part of a government propaganda campaign to convince
the populace that China must stick to the socialist road, suppress
political dissent and reject the reforms now sweeping Eastern
Europe.

<HEAD>Poling: Ford Opting for Air Bags Rather Than Automatic Belts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. will give up on automatic seat
belts by the mid-1990s, opting instead for air bags in all of its
cars for drivers and front-seat passengers, Vice Chairman Harold
Poling says.
   ``All of our tests have shown that when the passenger is
properly positioned with the active belt plus the use of the air
bag, it provides the greatest protection in the event of an
accident,'' Poling said Sunday night at a news conference.
   His comments came before he spoke to the opening session of an
annual industry meeting sponsored by the trade weekly Automotive
News.
   Currently, Ford offers air bags on about half of its 2 million
or so car fleet. Chrysler Corp. makes driver-side air bags standard
on all of its North American-made cars, and General Motors Corp.
has the devices as standard equipment on about 15 percent of its
fleet.
   By the 1993 model year, federal regulations require automakers
to have so-called passive restraint systems in place for drivers
and front-seat passengers, whether they are air bags with manual
seat belts or automatic seat belts and no air bags.
   The government required that cars made after Sept. 1, 1989, be
equipped with either a driver-side air bag used in conjunction with
manually operated seat belts for front-seat riders, or automatic
seat belts.
   As the automakers were introducing their 1990 model cars, they
announced price increases of up to 5 percent over 1989 prices,
blaming most of the boosts on the safety devices.
   Direct comparisons of the cost of an air bag and an automatic
seat belt system are difficult because of the wide variety of
vehicle designs. However, air bags cost more to install and replace
than do automatic seat belts.
   Poling said he didn't know how much it would cost to equip
Ford's entire automobile fleet with driver- and passenger-side air
bags by the mid-1990s.
   He estimated, however, it would add $400 to $600 to the cost of
making each car, about half of the cost of air bags now.
   Poling, who on March 1 succeeds Donald Petersen as Ford's
chairman, also said that the company doesn't plan any major
acquisitions in the near future. During the second half of 1989,
Ford spent nearly $6 billion to acquire the British luxury carmaker
Jaguar PLC and the Associates Corp., a financing company.
   However, Poling said Ford's 25 percent stake in Mazda, the
Japanese automaker which which it jointly makes cars, may grow.
   ``If the opportunity occurred over time to increase our equity
position with Mazda,'' Poling said, ``we would look at it
favorably.''
   In his speech, Poling said the European auto market shows more
potential for growth during the 1990s than does the North American
market, with projected increases of 1.5 percent and 1 percent,
respectively.
   That, combined with increased production capacity, adds up to a
rough decade for automakers.
   ``The combination of excess capacity and slow growth in the
automotive market will present a severe competitive challenge for
car and truck manufacturers around the world,'' he said.
   However, Poling said, automakers should have the chance to crack
newly emerging markets, including Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union.

<HEAD>Bond Corp. Willing To Listen to American Businessman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. is willing to
hear from an American businessman who announced over the weekend
that he wanted to take control of the Australian company, a
spokesman for the troubled holding company said.
   Bond Corp. executive Peter Lucas said Sunday the company
``looked forward to the next communication'' from Jeff Reynolds but
added that so far the proposal was lacking in detail.
   On Saturday, Reynolds, 28, announced in Los Angeles that he was
prepared to invest $250 million in Bond Corp. and in return take
control of the company, whose Australian brewing interests are now
in the hands of receivers. Bond Corp. also owns G. Heileman Brewing
Co. of La Crosse, Wis.
   He said he was confident he could refinance the company's $6
billion debt and would talk again with millionaire businessman Alan
Bond, who has controlling interest in Bond Corp., once the
Victorian Supreme Court hearing into the receivership is over.
   In a telephone interview Sunday in Houston, Reynolds said he
planned to travel to Perth in coming weeks to discuss details of
the bid with Bond.
   ``I'm scheduled to go back over to Perth shortly to work out
definitive agreements,'' Reynolds said. ``This is something we've
been working on since September.''
   Reynolds, chairman of Los Angeles-based Weatherby Investments,
said he has been in Houston for several months visiting relatives.
He said California Pacific International Holdings Co. Pte Ltd., the
Singapore-based parent firm of Weatherby, had been interested in
buying Bond Corp. for some time.
   ``We had been looking for a lot of opportunities,'' Reynolds
said. ``We had a manager in Singapore who had some relationship
with Bond and we opted to pursue that.''
   A report in Saturday's London Times said Reynolds got the idea
for a Bond Corp. takeover from California Pacific's managing
director, Chew Chin Han, a friend of Australian businessman Kerry
Packer.
   Reynolds said in the interview with The Associated Press that he
believed Bond's brewery interests remain healthy.
   ``We're willing to inject some capital into it and we're also
willing to restructure some of their debt,'' Reynolds said. ``This
is part of our long-term goals. We hope to develop some financial
services there in Australia and in Asia.''
   But he declined to disclose any other investors involved in the
project ``until we've got things sewn up.''
   Reynolds said Weatherby's main interests included oil, gas and
financing.
   A London broker who was not identified in the Times report said
his company's Far East office was baffled by Reynolds' interest.
   ``We have had people studying Singapore for eight years,'' the
broker was quoted as saying. ``They know all the companies, listed
and unlisted. But they haven't heard of California Pacific,
Weatherby or Jeff Reynolds.''
   In other developments Sunday, Lucas said an urgent weekend
meeting with U.S. creditors to its brewing empire had been
inconclusive.
   The lenders of the $650 million credit facility met in New York
on Saturday with Bond Corp. executive Peter Mitchell who urged them
not to put Bond Brewing Holdings into liquidation.
   Speaking on an Australian business television program Sunday,
Lucas said the talks were attended by 70 percent to 80 percent of
the creditors, which include major investment bank Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. and Bank of Boston.
   ``There was not much progress out of the meeting, (but) lots of
questions were asked, lots of questions given,'' Lucas said.
   He said the creditors had been asked to wait until the end of
January for a deferred interest payment of $41 million, which has
been frozen by the Victorian Supreme Court, a state court in
Australia.
   The creditors demanded immediate repayment of their loan Friday
and indicated they would support the decision by National Australia
Bank on Dec. 29 to put the brewing arm into receivership.
   Bond Corp. has challenged the receivership, with the Victorian
Supreme Court scheduled to begin the second week of hearings Monday.

<HEAD>Report: Bank Of New England Negotiating Sale Of Operations To
Fleet-Norstar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp. reportedly is
close to selling some of its operations in several states to
Fleet-Norstar Financial Group Inc., The Wall Street Journal
reported today.
   Bruce P. Crooks, a spokesman for Fleet-Norstar, which reportedly
has been negotiating with Bank of New England, declined to comment
on the report when reached at home early today. J. Terrence Murray,
the bank's chairman and chief executive, could not be reached by
telephone at home or at the office.
   A Bank of New England spokeswoman also declined to comment,
according to the Journal, which cited an individual familiar with
the talks for its information.
   Fleet-Norstar is seeking to buy Boston-based Bank of New
England's operations in Maine and southern Massachusetts, and
possibly Connecticut, the newspaper said. Negotiations continued
last week with the final scope and terms uncertain, it said.
   Although Fleet has consumer loan offices in Massachusetts and a
branch in downtown Boston that serves primarily as a commecial loan
production office, ``we've had interest for a number of years in
Massachusetts,'' Crooks said.
   Fleet-Norstar has been stymied by the failure of the
Massachusetts Legislature to pass a bill that would allow banks
from outside of New England to expand in that state. Fleet, because
of a 1988 merger, has extensive banking operations in New York
state that technically make it a non-New England bank under current
Massachusetts law.
   Fleet ran into a similar problem in Connecticut, but an order
that it divest United Bank has been put on hold while a legislative
committee studies the entire issue of interstate banking, said
Robert W. Lougee Jr., Fleet's director of corporate communications.
   He also refused to comment on any possible deal with Bank of New
England or to discuss any timetable for conclusion of the talks.
   Bank of New England last month said it expected to post a large
loss for the year, with $1.6 billion in non-performing assets,
mainly bad real estate loans. Both it and Fleet-Norstar have assets
of about $31 billion, but Fleet-Norstar has managed to avoid the
region's severe real estate lending problems and its nationwide
financial services operations have provided a more stable earnings
base.
   The Journal said its source indicated several possible
structures for the deal are being considered, including one in
which Fleet-Norstar would receive a stake in Bank of New England in
return for a capital infusion and another using securities whose
value would depend on the future financial performance of the
purchased operations.

   London share prices were lower at midday Monday,
pushed down by a lack of buying interest and concern over the
short-term direction of British stocks.
   With no clear lead emerging from the stock index futures market,
attention focused on the volume of buy orders, which were
significantly below recent levels.
   Cautious British weekend press comment on the market's
prospects, combined with a number of downgradings on specific
stocks, persuaded the market to retreat.
   By about noon London tine, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index stood 13.5 points, or 0.6 percent, lower at 2,431.0
points, well down from an earlier high of 2,445.6 points. At its
lowest during the morning, the index dipped to 2,429.2 points.
   ``The market is in a rather delicate position,'' said one
dealer. ``It can't decide if it is headed higher or at the

   Volume amounted to 209.0 million shares by midday, compared with
277 million shares at the same time Friday.

<HEAD>Campbell Soup Heir Restates Desire for Continued Independence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The daughter of former Campbell Soup Co.
Chairman John T. Dorrance Jr. has reaffirmed her vow to fight any
attempt by rival family shareholder groups to sell the food
industry giant.
   In a statement released Sunday by their New York law firm, Mary
Alice Malone and her husband, Stuart, owners of about 10 percent of
the company's outstanding stock, confirmed their ``commitment to
the continued independence of Campbell Soup Company.''
   ``We have always considered our investment in Campbell to be
long-term,'' said the statement attributed to Ms. Malone.
   Signs of a possible rift in the Dorrance family, which has
controlled the Camden, N.J.-based company for nearly a century, has
fueled speculation that major stockholders are split on the issue
of whether to sell the company.
   Ms. Malone, a company director, and her two brothers, John T.
Dorrance III and Bennett Dorrance, together hold about 31 percent
of the company's outstanding shares.
   In recent weeks, a group comprised of Dorrance cousins has
announced its intention in filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to press for a sale of the company.
   Last week, Campbell filled its long-vacant top spot by hiring
David W. Johnson, former head of Gerber Products Co., as its new
chief executive officer.
   ``We are extremely excited about David W. Johnson's immense
managerial talents and his contagious enthusiasm,'' Ms. Malone's
statement continued. ``In particular, we are inspired by his proven
track record of dealing successfully with the myriad of complex
intangibles that arise in very large family-held companies.''

   Stock prices were broadly lower today, but blue
chips steadied as some major banks lowered their prime lending
rates.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 293 up, 726 down and
462 unchanged.
   By contrast, the Dow Jones average of 30 big-name industrials
edged up .64 to 2,773.89 in the first half hour of trading.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.59 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The First National Bank of Chicago and New York's Citibank
reduced their prime rates this morning from 10.5 percent to 10
percent.
   They were the first major banks to take that step, which had
been predicted intermittently since late last fall as the Federal
Reserve moved gradually to relax its credit policy.
   The prime is used as a reference point from which interest rates
on numerous types of loans are calculated.
   But while the news came as a psychological lift to the market,
analysts said it didn't allay all the Street's new worries about
where interest rates are headed in the future.
   Open-market money rates, which reflect the most current
sentiment among investors and would-be lenders, were little changed
to moderately higher in today's activity.
   Pacific Telesis rose { to 48\ in active trading. The company
announced a new program to buy back as many as 25 million of its

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .38 to 194.26. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .51 at 381.94.
   On Friday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.83 to
2,773.25, reducing its gain for the week to 20.05 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the

<NOTE>Eds: Updates throughout to include denial of story by Campeau
spokeswoman, add details.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Campeau Corp. spokeswoman today denied a report
that the company has abandoned its three-month effort to sell its
Bloomingdale's department store chain.
   ``As far as we know, this report is wholly unfounded,'' Campeau
spokeswoman Carol Sanger said.
   The Canadian retail and real estate company, which has said it
might seek bankruptcy court protection for its U.S. retailers, has
changed its mind about selling the chain because it has attracted
only inadequate offers, the Financial Times said in today's
edition, quoting unidentified financiers closely involved in
Campeau's restructuring.
   Campeau was believed to be seeking around $1.5 billion for
Bloomingdale's, a well-known 17-store chain. Toronto-based Campeau
revealed in September that it was having financial problems and
decided to put Bloomingdale's up for sale to raise cash.
   But offers have come in too low, partly because of the sluggish
U.S. retailing sector and a glut of department stores on the
auction block, the newspaper said.
   A committee overseeing a restructuring of Campeau apparently
persuaded creditors that selling Bloomingdale's at a cheap price
would only weaken Campeau's balance sheet and reduce its cash flow,
the newspaper said.
   Campeau, headed by flamboyant financier Robert Campeau, burst
onto the U.S. retailing scene by buying Federated Department Stores
Inc. in 1988 for $6.6 billion, Bloomingdale's parent company, and
Allied Stores Corp. two years earlier for $3.4 billion.
   Ms. Sanger, the Campeau spokeswoman, said the second stage of
the auction process is under way.
   Campeau has previously said that no more than five or six
finalists would advance to the second round bidding for
Bloomingdale's. By the Dec. 8 deadline for initial offers, Campeau
said it had received a number of expressions of interest. A
definitive announcement on the sale was expected sometime in
February.
   Separately, Ms. Sanger confirmed that the Campeau board of
directors is meeting in Toronto today. She declined to comment on
what might be discussed at the meeting and said she doesn't know of
any announcements planned.
   The Wall Street Journal reported today that the board would be
urged not to pay apparel manufacturers whose bills are due Jan. 10.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources, said Campeau's
banks and financial advisers oppose making the payments now because
they believe it's just a matter of time before Campeau seeks
protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   ``What they're (the Campeau board members) urged is not the
issue. What they do is the issue,'' Ms. Sanger said.

   Those holding ALC common stock and series B and C preferred
stock would receive Telecom-USA units worth $3 a share. Holders of
ALC series A preferred stock would get units valued at $20 a share
plus accrued unpaid dividends.
   ALC currently has 13.7 million shares of outstanding common

shares each of series B and C preferred stock.
   The proposal is subject to a definitive agreement, regulatory
and shareholder approvals and other conditions.
   Telecom-USA is the nation's fourth largest long distance company
with 500,000 customers.
   ALC Communications, based in Birmingham, Mich., is the parent
company of Allnet Communications, a nationwide company serving
mainly the Northeast, upper Midwest and West. It serves 400,000

   Parts of Comecon are obsolete and need radical
changes but the Soviet Union opposes disbanding the East bloc trade
alliance as some nations have suggested, a Soviet spokesman said
today.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov indicated what
the Soviet response would be to appeals by Hungary, Czechoslovakia
and Poland for a major overhaul of Comecon when it meets Tuesday in
Sofia, Bulgaria.
   Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov will lead the Soviet
delegation despite his mother's recent death, Gerasimov told
reporters.
   Gerasimov blamed poor implementation of good past decisions for
many of Comecon's woes.
   ``There is no dynamism, there is no sign of improvement in the
trade structure, there is no technological progress,'' he said.
``And so we believe there must be radical measures to restructure
the mechanism of cooperation.''
   But, he added, ``As far as the direct answer to whether we need
Comecon or not, yes, we need it,'' Gerasimov said.
   Czechoslovak Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus said Thursday there
was no reason for Comecon to exist. Polish Foreign Trade Minister
Marcin Swiecicki echoed Klaus' views Friday, saying the
organization was outdated and should be replaced by something less
rigid.
   Comecon, which stands for the Council of Mutual Ecoomic
Assistance, was formed under the guidance of the Soviet Union in
1949 and has since controlled trade among Soviet-allied countries.
Its member nations are the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Cuba,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania
and Vietnam.

<HEAD>Three Silicon Valley Companies Introduce Machines that Use Unix</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tandem Computers on Monday announced a
new computer that uses Unix, a standard operating system for
controlling internal housekeeping functions of computers.
   Tandem's action, along with similar announcements expected
Monday from two other influential Silicon Valley companies, signals
a key trend in the computer industry toward the use of Unix,
analysts said.
   Unix allows customers to avoid being locked into buying
proprietary hardware and software available from just one vendor.
   Tandem, the Cupertino-based company known for reliable
``nonstop'' computers, introduced its new Integrity S2 system,
which will cost from $172,000 to $248,000. Capable of performing 12
million instructions per second, it is based on the R2000 chip from
Mips Computer Systems and has three separate processors, allowing
it to keep running if one fails.
   ``Buyers have tended to balk at using Unix-based systems for
mainstream business purposes because they couldn't count on the
systems being up and running,'' said Jeffrey Beeler, an analyst at
Dataquest. ``It appears that Tandem has done the best job of
addressing reliability problems.''
   The other two companies are Hewlett-Packard Co. and Intel Corp.
In addition, Sunnyvale-based MasPar Computer Corp. planned to debut
a new class of machine Tuesday that approximates the power of a
multimillion-dollar supercomputer at a fraction of the price.
   Palo Alto-based Hewlett-Packard was expected to unveil two
computer workstations that use a new version of a Motorola
microprocessor chip to perform 12 million instructions per second
for a 50 percent increase for the HP product line. The desktop
model will start at $8,995.
   Intel, the Santa Clara-based company widely known for
microprocessor chips, is introducing new machines that can have
from eight to 128 processors. But they can get hefty speed boosts
from the powerful i860 microprocessor from Intel's 80386 used in
personal computers.
   The systems range from $265,000 to more than $1 million. The
largest configuration can perform 7.6 billion operations per second.
   MasPar, one of the best-funded computer startups in recent
Silicon Valley history, was scheduled to unveil its MP-1 System _ a
box 55 inches high and 23 inches wide, attached to a Digital
MicroVax computer, that can perform up to 1.5 billion calculations
per second _ all for $170,000 to $810,000.
   The Intel and MasPar machines link independent processing units
together to address problems, resulting in tremendous speed.
   Similar machines have been used to help design nuclear weapons
and break codes, and others are already used for financial analysis
on Wall Street. Some observers expect them to become an important
force in commercial computing.
   ``The MasPar and Intel machines represent the new wave in
computing,'' said Gary Smaby, an independent computer analyst in

<HEAD>Court Rejects Appeal by Movie Company in Antitrust-Related Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today rejected an appeal by
a movie company that faces a $100,000 fine in an antitrust-related
case.
   The court, without comment, refused to free Twentieth Century
Fox Film Corp. from the penalty for a contempt finding against one
of the corporation's regional managers.
   The case has its origins in 1938, when the Justice Department
accused Twentieth Century and seven other major movie companies of
violating federal antitrust law.
   The companies allegedly engaged in practices aimed at preventing
small competitors from obtaining choice first-run films.
   One common practice, the government said, was ``block booking,''
in which theater owners were forced to accept less popular movies
if they wanted to receive more popular ones.
   The government and the motion picture companies settled the suit
in 1951 under a court-approved consent agreement barring the
companies from engaging in illegal practices.
   But in 1988, Leila Goldstein, Twentieth Century's manager for
Indianapolis, Milwaukee and Minneapolis, was accused of violating
the agreement.
   She was charged, for example, with insisting that theater owners
show the movie ``Black Widow'' if they wanted to run the more
popular ``Mannequin.''
   Ms. Goldstein was fined $5,000 for contempt, and Twentieth
Century was fined $500,000 plus legal costs.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in August ruled that the
movie company could be held in contempt for Ms. Goldstein's
behavior even though Twentieth Century had taken steps to make sure
its employees complied with the 1951 court order.
   ``It is this rule of vicarious liability that encourages
companies to establish compliance programs,'' the appeals court
said.
   But it ruled that the maximum fine that could be imposed against
Twentieth Century without a jury trial is $100,000.
   The case is Twentieth Century Fox vs. U.S., 89-661.

<TEXT>
   L.L. Bean is delaying plans to build a
large distribution center because 1989 sales fell below
expectations, a company spokesman said.
   The Freeport, Maine-sporting goods outfitter bought a 200-acre
site in Hampden and announced in June 1988 that it would build
there.
   Initial plans called for the center to be operational by 1992,
and to employ 2,500 full-time workers and 200 to 300 seasonal
workers during the Christmas shopping period.
   But plans have been put on hold, said spokesman D. Kilton Andrew
Jr.
   ``Now we'll sit tight and see the lay of the land as far as our
business growth goes,'' said Andrew. The distribution center in
Hampden definitely will be needed at some point, he said.
   ``When we're ready, Hampden will be sitting there waiting,''
Andrew added.
   Andrew told the Bangor Daily News that Bean would do nothing at
the site during 1990 and that he could not specify when development
might occur.
   The Hampden site occupies the southern half of the 500-acre Ammo
Industrial Park. Access to the site would be from a proposed road
off U.S. Route 202 in Hampden.
   A 500,000-square-foot building planned for the site, which would
cover about 11 acres, would be used to help handle Bean's
mail-order business.
   Bean President Leon A. Gorman said previously that several
factors led to selection of the Bangor-area site.
   ``The Hampden site has been developed for regional industrial
use and is one of only a few in the state large enough for our
facility,'' Gorman said. ``The site also has access to I-95 and to
Bangor International Airport for expeditious receipt of merchandise
and for rapid shipment of customer orders by truck or air.''

   Stock prices declined slightly today in a muted
response to cuts in the prime lending rate by several large banks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 1.07 to 2,772.18
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 528 up, 691 down and
525 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 47.23 million shares at
midmorning.
   The First National Bank of Chicago and three New York banks
reduced their prime rates this morning from 10.5 percent to 10
percent.
   They were the first major banks to take that step, which had
been predicted intermittently since late last fall as the Federal
Reserve moved gradually to relax its credit policy.
   The prime is used as a reference point from which interest rates
on numerous types of loans are calculated.
   But while the news came as a psychological lift to the market,
analysts said it didn't allay all the Street's new worries about
where interest rates are headed in the future.
   Open-market money rates, which reflect the most current
sentiment among investors and would-be lenders, were little changed
to moderately higher in today's activity.
   Pacific Telesis rose \ to 48. The company announced a new
program to buy back as many as 25 million of its shares.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .49 to 194.15. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .94 at 381.51.

<HEAD>Futures Prices Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices for grain and soybeans were mostly
higher early in the session today at the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Analysts attributed the rise in wheat prices to news that China
and the Soviet Union were buying more of the U.S. commodity.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department this morning confirmed rumors
that China had bid for 300,000 tons of wheat and market rumors
persisted that the Chinese would bid for an additional 300,000 tons.
   The Soviet Union was also said to be in the market for 500,000
tons of export bonus wheat.
   Also firming wheat prices were weather reports calling for mild
conditions that would make the winter crop vulnerable to a cold
snap, analysts said.
   Soybeans' advance was led by a soyoil rally as India returned to
the Malaysian palm oil market, analysts said.
   Corn, which was steady to slightly higher, was supported by
wheat trading, dealers said.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent to 2 cents higher, with the
contract for March at $4.11 a bushel; corn was { cent lower to {
cent higher, with March at $2.38 a bushel; oats were { cent to 1
cent higher, with March at $1.52, and soybeans were 1{ cents to 3
cents higher, with January at $5.66} a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle prices were mostly
lower while pork complex futures continued their rally.
   In early trading, cattle were .35 cent lower to .35 cent higher,
with the contract for February at 76.52 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .03 cent higher to .20 cent lower, with January at
84.55 cents a pound; live hogs were . .05 cent to .68 cent higher,
with February at 51.50 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were
1.10 cents to 2.00 cents higher, with February at 55.47.
   On Friday, cattle prices were mixed, while pork complex futures
soared higher.

<HEAD>Court To Decide Television, Radio Licensing Issue</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Inserts grafs 4-14, The court also, with other cases.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Supreme Court today agreed to decide
whether the federal government may give special licensing
preferences to television and radio stations owned by women and
minority members.
   The justices said they will use a Florida case to review the
Federal Communications Commission's policy of treating such
ownership as a favorable factor in its licensing decisions.
   In a separate case from Connecticut, the court said it also will
review the commission's policy of letting broadcast stations facing
a license revocation sell the license, at a reduced price, to
minority-owned firms.
   The court also agreed today to decide whether governors may
withhold state National Guard units from peacetime training ordered
by the federal government.
   The court said it will hear an appeal by Minnesota officials who
opposed Central American training missions for the state's National
Guard troops. The justices last April rejected a similar appeal by
Massachusetts officials.
   In other action, the court:
   _ Refused to force a revival of the ``fairness doctrine'' and
require radio and television stations to present all sides of
controversial issues.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the Federal
Communications Commission acted within its authority when
discarding in 1987 the obligations it had imposed on broadcasters
since 1949.
   _ Let stand a ruling that people have no constitutionally
protected right to privacy when at home speaking on a cordless
telephone.
   The court, without comment, turned away arguments that law
enforcement agents acted unlawfully when, without obtaining a court
warrant, they monitored an Iowa family's cordless-telephone
conversations.
   _ Rejected the appeal of a Tennessee high school student pulled
from a race for student council president after giving a speech
officials deemed disrespectful.
   The court, without comment, let stand rulings that officials at
Unicoi County High School in Erwin, Tenn., did not violate Dean
Poling's free-speech rights.
   _ Agreed to review a dispute over how much welfare aid some
needy families are entitled to receive.
   The court said it will hear a Bush administration appeal aimed
at limiting the payments in a Virginia case. At issue are features
of the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program.
   In conflicting rulings earlier this year, different three-judge
panels of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the FCC's
licensing preferences policy but struck down the so-called distress
sale program.
   The FCC in 1986 began reviewing its policy of giving
preferential consideration to firms owned by women and racial or
ethnic minorities when awarding broadcast licenses.
   But in late 1987 then-President Ronald Reagan signed an
appropriations bill in which Congress barred the commission from
spending any money to continue its review of _ or make any change
in _ its ``affirmative action'' policies.
   The congressional action also insulated from commission review
its policy, adopted in 1978, of allowing bankrupt or otherwise
troubled TV and radio stations to sell their licenses to firms
owned by women or minorities.
   Such transfers, if approved by the commission, can be made
without consideration of competing applications for the same
license.
   The policy of giving firms owned by women and minorities
preference over competing applicants for broadcast licenses was
challenged by Metro Broadcasting Inc. after its 1983 application
for a license to operate a new Orlando UHF television station was
rejected.
   The license instead was awarded to Rainbow Broadcasting Co.,
owned by two women and a man, all Hispanic.
   An FCC review board said the minority and ``slight female
ownership advantage'' enjoyed by Rainbow outweighed factors in
Metro's favor.
   The commission's licensing decision was upheld by a 2-1 vote of
a federal appeals court panel last April 21.
   On March 31, a different three-judge panel of the same court
voted 2-1 to strike down the distress sale program.
   The appeals court ruled that Alan Shurberg and Shurberg
Broadcasting were treated unfairly when the commission in 1984
rejected his attempt to get a license for WHCT-TV in Hartford,
Conn., and instead allowed WHCT's owner, Faith Center Inc., to make
a distress sale to Astroline Communications Company Limited
Partnership.
   The appeals court ruled that the commission's action violated
Shurberg's equal-protection rights, citing recent Supreme Court
rulings that trimmed the scope of affirmative action programs.
   ``The distress sale policy is not narrowly tailored to remedy
past discrimination because its effect is unrelated to the need for
such a remedy,'' the appeals court said. ``It provides no
procedures for ensuring that ... beneficiaries have actually
suffered from the effects of past discrimination.''
   The appeals acted on today were filed by Metro Broadcasting in
the Florida case and Astroline Communications in the Connecticut
case.
   Bush administration lawyers acknowledged that the rulings in the
two cases are based on ``conflicting rationales'' but urged the
justices to leave both rulings intact.
   They said the entire U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia should settle the ``intra-circuit conflict''
after President Bush fills three vacancies.
   About the Florida case, the government lawyers told the justices
that Astroline Communications is in bankruptcy proceedings and
``might well not be able to hold the license for Channel 18
regardless of whether the distress sale at issue were ultimately
upheld.''
   They added that Congress recently held hearings on the soundness
of the FCC's minority ownership policies and is set to review the
FCC's minorities policies by next October.
   ``Where Congress is revisiting this complex and sensitive area
of law, intervention by this court at this time is not necessary,''
the government lawyers said.
   The cases are Metro Broadcasting vs. FCC, 89-453, and Astroline
Communications vs. Shurberg Broadcasting, 89-700.

<HEAD>Waterford Wedgwood Confirms Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled china and crystal maker
Waterford Wedgwood Group PLC Monday confirmed it is holding talks
that might lead to a cash offer for a major but not controlling
interest in the company.
   Waterford Wedgwood shares gained 5 pence, or 8 cents, to 58
pence on London's Stock Exchange on the news.
   There has been widespread speculation for some time that
Waterford has been searching for a minority shareholder to give it
a much-needed cash infusion to help reduce some of the company's
substantial debt.
   The likely suitor is Fitzwilton Holdings PLC, a medium-sized
cash-rich Irish industrial conglomerate, said to be willing to take
up to a 30-percent holding in Waterford Wedgwood, weekend press
reports said.
   A spokesman at Fitzwilton who wasn't identified in accordance
with British practice, declined to comment.
   However, Dublin-based sources, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that only Fitzwilton's chairman, Tony O'Reilly, and
a group of high-powered investors have made an informal approach to
the company. O'Reilly also serves as chairman and chief executive
of Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz Co.
   Regardless of who takes up the stake, the sources said that
about 120 million Waterford Wedgwood shares would be offered, or
30-percent of the company, at about 40 Irish pence, or 63 cents, a
share, a deep discount from its current trading price of 62 Irish
pence in Dublin.
   Waterford Wedgwood has been suffering from serious financial
problems in recent years. An audit performed in late 1988 showed
that accounting errors were made that significantly overvalued the
company's inventories by up to $33 million. Waterford Wedgwood
Chairman Paddy Hayes resigned after these revelations.
   The company also has suffered from a decline in retail demand
for its products in the United States and Britain. The appreciation
of the Irish pound against the dollar has hurt the company's
fortunes.
   Last December, the company warned that its would suffer a
significant pre-tax loss in the second half.

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to force
reinstatement of the ``fairness doctrine'' that required radio and
television stations to present all sides of controversial issues.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the Federal
Communications Commission acted within its authority in 1987 when
it discarded the doctrine it had imposed on broadcasters since 1949.
   The fairness doctrine was based on the assumption that broadcast
frequencies were less available than print media outlets such as
newspapers, which never have been subjected to such requirements.
   For years, radio and TV could be punished _ even denied license
renewals _ for violating the doctrine, which required that
broadcast stations selling air time for the expression of one point
of view on a controversial issue had to present contrasting views
on that issue, either by selling ads or making free time available
to groups with opposing views.
   The appeal acted on today stemmed from a fairness-doctrine
complaint filed by an anti-nuclear group against Syracuse, N.Y.,
television station WTVH in 1984.
   The FCC said the station aired a series of editorial
advertisements that described construction of a nuclear generating
plant as a ``sound investment'' for New York without adequately
presenting contrasting viewpoints.
   But the commission at that time had begun to question the
permissibility of the fairness doctrine, and in 1987 concluded that
forcing broadcasters to be fair violates constitutionally protected
free-press rights and ``contravenes the public interest.''
   The commission dismissed the complaint against the Meredith
Corp., owner of WTVH.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here upheld the commission's
action last Feb. 10 without reaching the issue of the fairness
doctrine's constitutionality.
   Congress is considering legislation that would force the
commission to revive the fairness doctrine by explicitly writing it
into federal law.
   Similar legislation was vetoed in 1987 by then-President Reagan.
President Bush has said he, too, would veto such a measure.
   The appeals court, agreeing with the commission in this case,
ruled that nothing in the Communications Act of 1934 or its later
amendments requires retention of the doctrine.
   Lawyers for the anti-nuclear group, the Syracuse Peace Council,
said the appeals court ruling, if not reversed, would subvert ``the
long-established public trustee concept for broadcasting.''
   They argued that a 1959 amendment to the Communications Act gave
the FCC no choice but to enforce the fairness doctrine.
   ``In that amendment, Congress specifically recognized that the
public interest standard of the 1934 act embodies the bedrock
fairness obligation,'' the appeal contended.
   Bush administration lawyers urged the high court to reject the
appeal. They said the doctrine should not be enforced ``at a point
when the commission determines that it has become
counterproductive.''
   The case is Syracuse Peace Council vs. FCC, 89-312.

   Several big banks lowered their prime lending
rate a half percentage point today to 10 percent, the first
reduction in nearly half a year, signaling cheaper loans for a
broad range of consumers and businesses.
   The move reflected the declining cost of money that banks have
enjoyed in recent weeks, the result of a more liberal credit policy
by the Federal Reserve, the nation's central bank.
   Citibank and First National Bank of Chicago were the first to
cut the key rate. They were later followed by Morgan Guaranty Trust
Co., Bankers Trust Co., Continental Bank Corp., Mellon Bank and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   The Fed has been moving to ease interest rates recently in order
to forestall a dramatic economic downturn. Lower rates encourage
businesses and consumers to borrow money.
   The prime rate is a benchmark that many banks use to calculate a
range of other popularly known loan rates, including variable rate
home equity loans.
   ``To Joe and Joan Average Consumer who have some of their loans
tied to short-term rates this is good news,'' said F. Ward
McCarthy, an economist at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc.
``Many people have home equity loans or car loans tied to the prime
... and monthly payments should go down by next month.''
   The move today, effective immediately, marks the first time the
rate has been changed since July 31, when banks lowered the prime
to 10.5 percent from 11 percent.
   Most economists predicted other banks would follow suit by at
least by Tuesday, saying today's move was long overdue. There was
little reaction in the stock or bond markets, indicating that such
a drop had been anticipated.
   ``It comes as no surprise. I think it was in keeping with
current money market rates,'' said William V. Sullivan, an
economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Sullivan said banks had the incentive to trim their prime just
after Christmas when the Fed moved to lower the federal funds rate,
the interest on overnight loans between banks, to the 8.25 percent
level. He said banks put off any cut in the prime because seasonal
demands for higher cash reserves had pushed the fed fund rate above
9 percent.
   David H. Resler, chief economist for Nomura Securities Inc.,
predicted that most banks will have lowered their prime by Tuesday,
after executives have had a chance to meet on the subject.
   However, McCarthy, said he wouldn't be surprised if some banks
continued to put off any action or lowered their prime only a
quarter of a percentage point.
   McCarthy said the so-called yield spread, which is the
difference between banks' borrowing costs and the rate at which
they lend their money, ``is not outlandish'' based on current
economic conditions.
   After today's prime cut it fell to 1.75 percentage points from
2.25 percentage points based on current fed fund rates. McCarthy
said that when the economy is sluggish it's not unusual to see the
yield spread at around 2 percentage points.
   When the economy is expanding, banks can afford to keep their
rates lower since loan volume is usually brisk, McCarthy explained.
But as economic conditions weaken so do the need for loans, and
that means banks make up for a lower volume by keeping rates higher.

<HEAD>Twelve Indicted in Scheme To Avoid State Fuel Taxes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former vice president of a top Wall Street
brokerage and 11 others were charged Monday with using money from
an earlier fraud to organize a $1.1 million tax evasion scheme in
upstate New York.
   Mark Stahl, who was sentenced to five years in prison in 1987
for mail fraud at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., and the others
were charged with setting up companies that conspired to evade $1.1
million in state fuel taxes, said Nancy Connell, spokeswoman for
Attorney General Robert Abrams.
   They were charged with enterprise corruption under an organized
crime statute that carries a maximum sentence of 25 years in jail
and fines.
   The alleged scheme involved several companies set up to deliver
fuel to the Big Apple and Big M truck stops in the Albany suburb of
Glenmont, Connell said.
   The defendants allegedly bought home heating oil and had it sold
as diesel fuel at the truck stops, Connell said. Through this
process, they avoided paying diesel fuel taxes, which are much
higher than home heating oil taxes, she said.
   They also were accused of hiding from authorities the amount of
diesel fuel they brought into the truck stops, evading still more
taxes, she said.
   Stahl was convicted of transferring more than $1 million in
Shearson funds to various bank accounts he controlled in 1986 and
1987. He admitted in court, however, to a much larger scheme
involving more than $18 million.
   Money from that fraud allegedly was used in the heating oil
scam, according to the indictment.

   Share prices fell Monday on London's Stock
Exchange on disappointment that a January rally had failed to
materialize.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 13.2
points, or 0.5 percent, lower at 2,431.3 points. The high for the
day was 2,445.6 points, the low 2,423.8.
   Volume was 396.4 million shares, compared with 471.5 million
shares Friday.
   Many market watchers had expected stocks to jump higher in
repetition of a 1989 New Year rally. Its inability to do so in 1990
has knocked some confidence out of the market, they said.
   In addition, dealers said pessimistic weekend press comment on
the future prospects for stock prices depressed the market.

<HEAD>Jaguar Appoints Two Ford Directors to Board</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jaguar PLC said Monday that two directors of Ford
Motor Co., which acquired the British luxury car maker in Nohouse, then
an art teacher, said she had begun to detect
a great deal of sexual and moral confusion in the minds of her
students over what they had seen on TV.
   Her main target was the publicly financed BBC. Nearly a
half-million people signed a petition in 1964 calling for closure
of the BBC, accusing it of broadcasting ``propaganda of disbelief,
doubt and dirt.''
   The BBC stayed on the air, and barred Mrs. Whitehouse from its
programs for 15 years. Its director-general at the time, Sir Hugh
Greene, said years later that her only contribution had been to
raise the national level of intolerance.
   Critics still accuse her of trying to be the nation's censor.
   ``Young people are not driven to excesses by explicit scenes of
sex on the screen. She's a very sincere lady, but one of the most
misguided,'' said Harry Turner, managing director of Television
South West, an independent company.
   Mrs. Whitehouse insists her only demand is that broadcasters
fulfill their responsibility not to offend against good taste and
decency or incite crime.
   ``It isn't that one's against sex, or showing on TV that men and
women love each other, but it's the kind of close-up voyeurism that
people are sick and tired of,'' she said.
   Her speeches draw capacity audiences. And with influential
figures such as Mrs. Thatcher speaking out against overly explicit
TV, Mrs. Whitehouse has come closer to representing mainstream
British values.
   In 1988, in what was widely seen as a backlash against
permissiveness, the government created the Broadcasting Standards
Council, an agency to monitor ``sex and violence, taste and
decency.''
   Mrs. Whitehouse claims to have secured legislation to ban child
pornography, control pornography in shop windows and on magazine
covers, and classify videotape rentals. In December, her
association succeeded in getting the government to introduce
legislation to bring broadcasting under the obscenity laws.
   Mrs. Whitehouse's latest goal is to ensure that satellite TV,
recently launched in Britain, does not beam in sexually explict
programs from abroad.

   Stock prices hovered around last week's closing
levels today in a muted response to cuts in the prime lending rate
by several large banks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.91 to 2,778.16 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 597 up, 729 down and
503 unchanged.
   Numerous banks across the country today reduced their prime
rates from 10.5 percent to 10 percent.
   They included the first money-center banks to take that step,
which had been predicted intermittently since late last fall as the
Federal Reserve moved gradually to relax its credit policy.
   The prime is used as a reference point from which interest rates
on numerous types of loans are calculated.
   But while the news came as a psychological lift to the market,
analysts said it didn't allay all the Street's new worries about
where interest rates are headed in the future.
   Open-market money rates, which reflect the most current
sentiment among investors and would-be lenders, were little changed
to moderately higher in today's activity.
   Philip Morris led the active list, down 1\ at 40~ following a
federal appeals court ruling that was interpreted as raising the
possibility of new legal battles for cigarette manufacturers.
   Among other actively traded blue chips, Exxon rose \ to 49;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph gained | to 45\; General Electric

   The U.S. dollar fell against major currencies
except for the Canadian dollar Monday in European trading as the
West German mark continued its recent rise.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar weakened during the
day's trading amid expectations for lower U.S. interest rates,
which reduce the returns on dollar-denominated investments.

   Grand Metropolitan PLC, seeking to turn
Burger King into a major international brand, said Monday it plans
to buy 20 Wimpy franchised restaurants in the United Kingdom and
convert them to Burger King outlets.
   The British food and liquor conglomerate, which owns the
Minneapolis-based Pillsbury Co., also said Monday that it has met
with a number of parties over the possible sale of its brewing
interests, although it also is considering other options to meet
government anti-trust recommendations.
   In announcing the Wimpy restaurants' purchase from Allied
Leisure PLC, London, Grand Met said the sale was scheduled for
completion Jan. 29. It did not disclose terms of the deal.
   ``These 20 prime locations in London and the south coast of
England will significantly strengthen our planned expansion of the
Burger King brand in the United Kingdom,'' said Ian A. Martin,
chief executive of Grand Metropolitan's U.S. operations and
chairman of the Burger King subsidiary.
   ``Following our acquisition of U.B. restaurants in October 1989,
which included more than 800 restaurants in the United Kingdom and
Europe, this is the latest step in our strategy to build Burger
King as a major international brand,'' Martin said.
   In the past three months, Burger King has doubled the number of
its outlets in the United Kingdom and now operates 60 restaurants
there. These include 23 former Wimpy counter service outlets which
were purchased as part of the U.B. Restaurants acquisition. Burger
King anticipates having over 200 owned or franchised outlets in the
United Kingdom by the end of 1990.
   Burger King operates approximately 6,000 restaurants worldwide,
including more than 5,400 in the United States.
   Regarding its brewing interests, Grand Met, which has 5,000
public houses, said it was trying to determine how to meet
recommendations of last year's Monopolies and Mergers Commission
report, which said brewers should be allowed to operate only 2,000
public houses, or pubs.
   ``But selling our brewing interests is only one option, and no
decisions have yet been made,'' the company said.
   Grand Met said it has held discussions with a number of
company's which might lead to asset sales, including Courage Ltd.,
the British brewer owned by Elders IXL of Australia.
   It is rumored that a potential deal with Courage may involve the
company swapping some of its public houses for Grand Met's brewing
interests.
   Grand Met brews a number of brands under license for a range of
international companies, including Elders' Fosters lager.
   Grand Met last year bought Pillsbury, which owned Burger King,
in a deal valued at $5.75 billion.
   In addition to Burger King and Pillsbury, Grand Met's U.S.-based
subsidiaries include Haagen-Dazs, Alpo, Carillon, Heublein,
Paddington and Pearle.

   Futures prices for grains and soybeans were
mostly higher at the close Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``There was a pretty good rally in soy oil that gave soybeans a
good boost,'' said Joel Karlin, analyst with Research Department
Inc. ``India bought into the palm oil market. African countries
have shown some interest in vegetable oils, too.''
   Corn was supported by a rumor that the Soviet Union might be
interested in as much as 1 million tons, he said.
   Export news sent wheat prices higher, said Susan Leighty, grains
analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department confirmed rumors that China had
bid for 300,000 tons of the U.S. commodity, and rumors persisted
that the Chinese would bid for 300,000 tons more. The Soviet Union
was also said to be in the market for 500,000 tons of export bonus
wheat, she said.
   Also firming wheat prices were weather reports calling for mild
conditions in the next few days that might make the winter crop
more vulnerable to a cold snap later, Mrs. Leighty said.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent to 1{ cents higher, with the
contract for March at $4.10} a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to {

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today refused to revive a
lawsuit by Chattanooga, Tenn., public utility officials against
companies that made electrical equipment containing hazardous
chemical PCBs.
   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that the Electric
Power Board of Chattanooga waited too long to sue.
   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the suit last
July. The appeals court said most of the equipment was purchased 10
or more years before the suit was filed.
   Tennessee law requires such suits be filed within four years of
the discovery of the alleged injury, the appeals court said.
   The power board sued for more than $10 million, the estimated
cost of replacing transformers and other equipment containing PCBs.
Utility officials said the equipment manufacturers lied about or
concealed the toxic effects of the chemical compounds.
   But the 6th Circuit court said power board officials were aware
of the dangers of PCBs at least as early as 1976. They did not sue,
however, until after federal environmental officials adopted new
PCB regulations in 1985.
   The utility officials had opposed the regulations because of the
likely cost of complying, the appeals court said.
   ``When the regulation they had feared was passed in 1985, only
then did they become outwardly concerned about the hazards of their
uses of PCB equipment,'' the appeals court said.
   The appeals court also rejected arguments intended to let the
power board use a federal environmental law as the basis for the
suit. The appeals court said deadlines for suing under the federal
law were almost identical to Tennessee law.
   The companies sued by the power board were Monsanto, General
Electric, McGraw-Edison, Central Moloney Inc., Wagner Electric,
Westinghouse Electric and Sangamo Electric.
   The case is Electric Power Board vs. Monsanto, 89-694.

   Paramount Pictures Corp. must pay Art
Buchwald for the script idea the humor columnist claimed was the
basis for the hit Eddie Murphy movie ``Coming to America,'' a judge
tentatively ruled today.
   ``The court concludes that `Coming to America' was based upon a
material element of or was inspired by Buchwald's treatment,''
Judge Harvey A. Schneider wrote in a 34-page statement released
this morning.
   The decision becomes official in 10 days unless attorneys on
either side raise issues not covered by it. After that, the ruling
could be appealed.
   In his ruling, Schneider did not specify how much Buchwald
should be paid but did say that the amount will not include
punitive damages. The Los Angeles County Superior Court judge also
took pains to specify that Murphy contributed considerably to the
finished film.
   The judge ordered a new phase of the breach-of-contract trial to
determine how much money Paramount owes Buchwald.
   ``We don't agree with the judge's decision,'' Paramount said in
a statement. The company said there would be an appeal. Murphy was
at work on a movie on location in Modesto and could not be reached
for comment.
   Buchwald expressed joy at the ruling, but quipped that he
wouldn't write any more movie ideas for the next 10 years.
   ``I am very, very happy. This thing is not only an important
thing for me. I think it's really important for writers,'' he told
the Associated Press in a telephone interview from Washington.
   ``I didn't know what I was getting into when I started because
those guys play rough, and we beat them. And that makes me very
happy,'' Buchwald said.
   Pierce O'Donnell, Buchwald's attorney, said Buchwald and his
partner, producer Alain Bernheim, could stand to collect $5 million
to $10 million in their share of the film's profits.
   Paramount maintains the film, which has grossed in excess of
$300 million since its 1988 release, has yet to show a profit.
   In his opinion, Schneider ruled that the humorist did not base
his idea, entitled ``King for a Day,'' on a 1957 Charlie Chaplin
movie entitled ``A King in New York.''
   The Chaplin film, which defense lawyers compared to Buchwald's
story, is about an aging European king's adventures in the city
after he flees his country, while ``Coming to America'' and
Buchwald's story concern the Stateside adventures of a African
prince or king.
   ``The court concludes that `Coming to America' is a movie that
was based upon Buchwald's treatment `King for a Day,''' Schneider
said.
   However, he carefully specified in the ruling that he was not
denigrating Eddie Murphy's creative talent and stressed the term
``based upon,'' since Buchwald did not write a complete script.
   He also said Murphy was not to blame for the dispute with
Buchwald.
   ``It is Paramount and not Murphy that obligated itself to
compensate Buchwald if any material elements of Buchwald's
treatment was utilized in or inspired a film produced by
Paramount,'' the decision stated.
   ```Coming to America' is no less the product of Eddie Murphy's
creativity because of the court's decision than it was before this
decision was rendered,'' he said.
   In his decision, Schneider rejected the argument that Paramount
was guilty of bad faith and fraud and turned down a request by
Buchwald's attorney for separate punitive damages based on such
action.
   ``The court is unable to conclude that Paramount's conduct was
in bad faith, let alone fraudulent, oppressive or malicious,''
Schneider wrote.
   In addition, he rejected the suggestion that Murphy ``stole''
Buchwald's idea, saying that the case did not revolve on such a
claim.
   ``The court desires to indicate what this case is and is not
about,'' the judge said. ``It is not about whether Art Buchwald or
Eddie Murphy is more creative. It is clear to the court that each
of these men is a creative genius in his own field and each is a
uniquely American institution.
   ``This case is also not about whether Eddie Murphy made
substantial contributions to the film `Coming to America,''' he
added. ``The court is convinced he did.''
   The judge said he also concluded that the case was not about
whether Murphy stole Buchwald's concept ``King for a Day.''
   ``Rather, this case is primarily a breach-of-contract case
between Buchwald and Paramount (not Murphy), which must be decided
by reference to the agreement between the parties and the rules of
contract construction.''
   Schneider noted that there was no question in his mind that
Murphy knew about Buchwald's idea and that he discussed it on at
least three occasions with at least one Paramount executive.
   He found that the Buchwald idea and the Murphy box office
blockbuster ``Coming to America'' were substantially similar and
Paramount remains liable for provisions of the contract, which
promised Buchwald compensation if his idea became a movie.

be in effect for coach and supercoach fares with tickets purchased
on or after Jan. 11. Excursion fares will go up on Feb. 1, the
Arlington, Va.-based carrier said.
   The company said jet fuel prices, which have increased 40
percent in the last six weeks, were responsible for its decision.
Each one penny per gallon fuel price hike translates into an
additional $13 million in operating costs for the airline, the
announcement said.
   Other airlines announced higher fares last week.

<HEAD>New Company to Process and Sell Recycled Paper Fiber for New
Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jefferson Smurfit Corp., the leading recycler
of waste paper, and Waste Management of North America Inc. on
Monday announced a joint venture to process and market recycled
paper fiber.
   ``A major obstacle to the successful recovery of paper fiber
from the nation's waste stream has been our inability to find
stable markets and consistent demand for this valuable material,''
said William P. Hulligan, president of Waste Management of North
America, the largest provider of recycling collection services in
the United States and Canada.
   Hulligan said that Waste Management's collection systems,
facilities and technologies should result in greater efficiency and
a constant source of raw material for customers.
   The companies have signed a letter of intent to form Smurfit-WMI
Recycling Co., based in St. Louis.
   Under the agreement, Jefferson Smurfit's Reclamation Division
would become an independent business owned equally by Jefferson
Smurfit and Waste Management of North America, a subsidiary of
Waste Management Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill.
   The company will sell reclaimed paper fiber to Jefferson Smurfit
and its affiliates, as well as other paper and paperboard mills for
use in new paper products.
   St. Louis-based Jefferson Smurfit is one of the largest paper
and paperboard packaging companies in the United States. Its
Reclamation Division has 32 processing plants and markets more than
3.7 million tons a year of corrugated containers, old newsprint and
other products.
   Waste Management of North America provides residential
collection of recyclables from more than 1.2 million homes through
contracts with 142 municipalities.
   The company's Recycle America and Recycle Canada residential and
commercial programs collect more than 750,000 tons of recyclable
materials a year through more than 315 divisions in North American.
It operates 35 processing plants across the country. In addition to
paper, the company recovers aluminum, glass and plastics.
   The new company will continue to operate Jefferson Smurfit
recycling centers and market other recycled commodities. Waste
Management will provide corrugated, newsprint and other papers
recovered through its collection programs.

<HEAD>Czechs To Get Visa Cards</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Visa International said Monday it will
begin offering Visa cards in Czechoslovakia next year, making it
the first Eastern European country to let its citizens use an
international payment card.
   The Visa cards will be offered by Zivnostenska Banka, the
country's oldest retail bank. The bank initially intends to offer
cards to customers with foreign currency incomes. Czechoslovakia's
currency isn't convertible into western currencies.
   ``This not only marks a significant breakthrough to a new
Eastern European market, it is a graphic illustration of the
payment card as an international currency,'' Jean-Jacques Desbons,
executive vice president of Visa International, said in a statement.
   Czechoslovakia would follow the Soviet Union and China in
accepting an international payment card.
   The cards in Czechoslovakia will be debit cards, with purchase
amounts billed immediately against the customer's own accounts,
Visa International spokesman David Brancoli said. Czech customers
will be able to use the card at any of the 7.5 million Visa
merchant locations worldwide, he said.
   Since 1988, Visa has issued a few thousand debit cards in the
Soviet Union to foreign residents and Soviets who travel abroad.
Those cards can be used worldwide. Sberbank, the largest Soviet
bank, also offers a Visa debit card for domestic use.
   Last month, Visa announced an agreement with authorities of the
Soviet republic of Estonia to introduce a card there.
   Visa, MasterCard and American Express also have been allowed to
offer cards in China since 1987.

<HEAD>Lawyers in Landmark Cigarette Case Sort Out Appeals Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mixed ruling from a federal appeals court
over a landmark smoker-death case drew a two-part chorus of victory
Monday from tobacco companies and a man who claims cigarettes
killed his wife.
   The 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday overturned the
nation's first money damages judgment against the tobacco industry,
removing the only blemish from their nearly 40 years of victory in
such cases.
   But the panel also sent back for trial a reshaped case that will
likely put smoking itself in the dock; reinstated claims against
two other tobacco companies; and perhaps deepened the well for
potential damages.
   Despite the outcome, the decision adds perhaps years more of
legal wrangling in a 7-year-old case.
   ``For this case, it's the lawyers' unemployment act,'' said
Donald J. Cohn, an attorney for cigarette-maker Liggett Group Inc.
   As lawyers on both sides study the opinion, they are preparing
for discussions with federal trial judge H. Lee Sarokin on the next
step.
   ``Quite frankly, I think the opinion is terrific for the
litigation generally,'' said Marc Z. Edell, the lead lawyer suing
Philip Morris Inc., Lorillard Inc. and Liggett.
   The companies made cigarettes smoked by lung-cancer victim Rose
Cipollone, whose husband, Antonio, carried on the case that blames
the companies for his wife's death at 58 in 1984.
   ``It's unfortunate that we had to sacrifice the verdict to get
that kind of opinion. But for the big picture, it's extremely
helpful,'' said Edell.
   After a four-month trial, the jury in June 1988 awarded
Cipollone $400,000. Philip Morris and Lorillard, owned by Loews
Corp., were absolved, but Liggett was found liable for violating
advertising promises to Mrs. Cipollone.
   A number of issues did not reach the jury because of rulings by
Sarokin. Several of those rulings damaging to the cigarette
companies were reversed by the appeals court.
   The panel found that Edell should have been allowed to argue the
``risk-utility'' theory _ which holds that if a product's danger
outweighs its usefulness, the manufacturer can be held liable.
   When that argument is introduced at retrial, ``This will be the
first time that a jury will actually make a determination as to
whether or not cigarette smoking is something our society thinks
should be around,'' said Edell. Philip Morris and Lorillard will
also have to face this claim, broadening the potential for damages.
   Edell said he would introduce evidence about the generally
harmful effects on society, such as statistics on mortality,
disease and the financial cost to businesses.
   Two factors, though, may prevent the Cipollone case from
breaking ground in risk-utility.
   On Dec. 28, a Mississippi judge ruled in favor of such an
argument. The case is expected to go to trial in April. And the New
Jersey Supreme Court is also considering the issue on an appeal in
a state case brought by Edell. If he loses, risk-utility would be
out of the case, but the federal ruling would still help plaintiffs
in other states.
   Cohn said the risk-utility decision is not a boon to plaintiffs
because the circuit court said a jury must also be convinced that
the ``ordinary consumer'' wasn't aware of the dangers of smoking.
   Cohn said the opinion puts cigarette plaintiffs back at square
one, and that it will only help evaporate similar lawsuits, which
have dropped to below 60 from 150 in 1987.
   Litigation analyst Calvert Crary, of Labe, Simpson &amp; Co.,
downplayed actual numbers of cases.
   Anti-tobacco lawyers have adopted the strategy of, ``You take
200 cases, throw' em up against the wall and see which ones
stick,'' he said.

   Iran is ready to accommodate 300,000
tourists and earn more than $210 million a year under the first
stage of a tourism plan, a government official said Monday.
   Mahdi Hashemi, director of the tourism department of the
Mostazafan Foundation, said in Tehran the number of tourists could
be doubled later, the official Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
   IRNA, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Hashemi as saying the first
batch of foreign tourists will arrive from Italy early in the
spring. Negotiations are under way for other arrivals from Moslem
and third world countries, he said.
   A separate report by Tehran Radio, also monitored in Nicosia,
said plans have been completed for the exchange of tourists between
Iran and the Soviet Union.
   The Mostazafan, or deprived, Foundation is a government welfare
agency that operates its own tourist agency and other businesses to
generate income for the poor.
   Hashemi said the foundation's tourism subsidiary operates 32
hotels in Tehran and other cities that meet international standards.
   After a decade of self-imposed isolation, Iran recently launched
a drive to revive its once flourishing tourist industry to promote
a better image to the world and to earn badly needed foreign
currency.
   Iran catered for about 1 million tourists a year before the
Islamic revolution of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini overthrew the
pro-Western government of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1979.

   The nation's leading commercial banks on Monday dropped their
prime lending rates a half percentage point to 10 percent, marking
the first reduction in nearly half a year and paving the way for
many cheaper business and consumer loans.
   The move reflects the overall falling cost of money that banks
have enjoyed in recent weeks due to more liberal credit policies by
the Federal Reserve.
   The central bank moved to ease interest rates late in 1989 to
help forestall a dramatic economic downturn. Lower rates spur
growth by encouraging businesses and consumers to borrow money.
   The prime used as a benchmark for bank interest rates on a wide
range of borrowing by consumers and small- and medium-size
companies. The groups likely to benefit most from a reduction are
individuals who borrow against the equity in their homes and, to a
lesser extent, those with car loans linked to the prime.
   ``To Joe and Joan Average Consumer who have some of their loans
tied to short-term rates this is good news,'' said F. Ward
McCarthy, an economist at Stone &amp; McCarthy Research Associates Inc.
``... Monthly payments should go down by next month.''
   Fixed-rate mortgages aren't expected to be affected by Monday's
prime cut, because those rates are pegged to activities in the bond
markets. But rates have been declining for the past several months,
with average rates on a 30-year conventional mortgage remaining
below 10 percent since late October.
   First National Bank of Chicago and Citibank were the first major
banks to cut the prime on Monday. The move was followed throughout
the day by other large banks and many smaller institutions.
   It was the first time the rate has been changed since July 31,
when banks lowered the prime to 10.5 percent from 11 percent. The
last time the prime stood at 10 percent was in November 1988,
before it was raised to 10.5 percent at the start of a year-long,
upward trend.
   Many economists said Monday's reduction was long overdue, given
how the Fed had begun moving in early November to push interest
rates lower.
   Stock prices closed higher, while bonds and the dollar declined
following Monday's announcement.
   William V. Sullivan, an economist with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said banks had the incentive to trim their prime just after
Christmas when the Fed moved to lower the federal funds rate, the
interest on overnight loans between banks, to 8.25 percent.
   However, Sullivan said, banks put off any cut in the prime
because seasonal demands for higher cash reserves temporarily had
pushed the fed funds rate above 9 percent.
   The central bank can exert strong influences over fed funds by
adding or draining reserves from the banking system through the
sale and purchase of government securities.
   Many economists said the Fed would have to be more persuasive in
its push for easier credit before any future prime-rate cuts occur.
Banks have been under pressure recently to maintain higher cash
reserves in the face of problem real estate loans and loans to
Third World countries _ which also may have helped delay the latest
rate reduction.
   The so-called yield spread, which is the difference between
banks' own borrowing costs and the price they charge for lending
money, ``is not outlandish'' based on current economic conditions,
said McCarthy.
   After Monday's prime cut the spread fell to between 1.75 and
1.80 percentage points from 2.25 to 2.30 percentage points, based
on current fed fund rates and rates on three-month certificates of
deposit _ two key examples of banks' borrowing costs.
   McCarthy said that when the economy is sluggish it's not unusual
to see the yield spread at around 2 percentage points.
   When the economy is expanding, banks can afford to keep their
rates lower because loan volume usually is brisk, McCarthy said.
But as economic conditions weaken so does loan demand, and banks
make up for lower volume by keeping rates higher.

   The dollar fell sharply against key foreign
currencies in active trading Monday, skidding to a 20-month low
against the strong West German mark amid continued concerns about
declining U.S. interest rates.
   Gold prices also slipped after a mixed performance overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $403 a troy ounce, down $3.30 from Friday.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$401.80 an ounce, off $4.45.
   Currency dealers said a cut in U.S. commercial banks' prime
lending rate Monday, to 10 percent from 10.5 percent, helped
depress the dollar in foreign exchange. The prime-rate cut reflects
more liberal credit policies by the Federal Reserve since late 1989
and lowers borrowing costs for a number of businesses and consumers.
   Lower interest rates are seen as bearish for the dollar since
they make dollar-denominated investments less attractive to
foreigners.
   At the same time, interest rates have been holding steady
overseas, particularly in West Germany, where the crumbling of the
Berlin Wall promises to spur economic growth, dealers noted.
   Stong interest in the mark pushed the dollar to its lowest level
against that currency since late April 1988, according to Ronald H.
Holzer, a vice president at Harris Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago.
   The dollar fell to 1.6685 marks from 1.6895 marks late Friday.
   ``Continued purchases of marks favors a lower dollar scenario,''
Holzer said. ``German rates remain firm ... (while) the Fed policy
is stable to easy credit.''
   Enthusiasm for the mark also was renewed by Friday's 3.68
percent devaluation of the Italian lire against the other
currencies in the nine-member European Monetary System, dealers
said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 144.52 Japanese yen, up from 144.15.
It traded at 144.10 yen in London, and at 144.15 yen in New York,
down from 144.50.
   The dollar also was weaker against the British pound. Sterling
rose to $1.6530 in London from late Friday's $1.6375, and to
$1.6535 in New York, up from $1.6350.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's
quotes, included: 1.5245 Swiss francs, down from 1.5445; 5.6965
French francs, down from 5.7777; 1,250.00 Italian lire, down from
1,276.25; and 1.16035 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16075.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Friday's rates: 1.6685
West German marks, down from 1.6810; 1.5235 Swiss francs, down from
1.5365; 5.6920 French francs, down from 5.7405; 1.8880 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9030; 1,249.00 Italian lire, down from
1,263.00; and 1.1599 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1595.
   Gold rose in London but fell in Zurich on profit-taking.
   The late gold bid in London was $404.75 an ounce, up from
$404.50 Friday. The late Zurich bid was $404.05 an ounce, down from
$405.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $403.05 an ounce, up from
$401.85 Friday.
   Silver prices also were mixed.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery closed
at $5.244 a troy ounce, down from $5.318 Friday. Silver rose in
London to $5.28 an ounce from $5.27.

<HEAD>Icahn Considering Proxy Fight at USX</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Carl Icahn, who waged a proxy fight two years
ago seeking control of Texaco Corp., is considering a similar
battle for USX Corp., a Wall Street source said Monday.
   Icahn, USX's largest shareholder, was expected to decide within
a few weeks whether to pursue a proxy fight in hopes of replacing
the directors of the steel, oil and gas giant, said the source, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   A USX spokesman, William Keslar, said the company had no comment
on any potential moves by Icahn.
   Icahn, who also is chairman of Trans World Airlines, long has
been dissatisfied with USX management and believes the company's
stock price is too low.
   The source said Icahn believes USX's position is similar to that
of Texaco in 1988, when the takeover strategist failed to unseat
that company's board in an attempt to force a restructuring that
would boost Texaco's stock price.
   Icahn, who has argued in favor of USX selling its Marathon Oil &amp;
Gas subsidiary, wants shareholders _ not management _ to decide
whether the division should be kept or sold, the source said.
   If he won a proxy fight _ essentially enlisting the support of
enough shares to win an election over his proposals _ Icahn could
replace the USX board with directors more sympathetic to his stand
on Marathon.
   The proceeds from a Marathon sale conceivably would be
distributed among shareholders or used to pay down USX's debt.
Either move would enhance the price of the company's stock.
   USX stock rose 62{ cents to $36.75 a share Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   USX already has decided to sell its Texas Oil &amp; Gas Co.
subsidiary. USX Chairman Charles Corry said recently the company
would pare down its debt by about $1 billion debt with the proceeds.
   However, the company so far has been unwilling to sell Marathon.
   Icahn won federal permission last month to acquire at least 25
percent of USX's stock. He currently owns nearly 34 million, or
13.26 percent, of USX's outstanding common shares.
   Icahn also reportedly has been considering a bid for the
company. He offered to buy USX for $7.2 billion in early 1987, but
abandoned the proposal after it was rejected by the USX board.
   A proxy fight at USX would mirror to some extent Icahn's fight
with Texaco.
   When Icahn became Texaco's biggest shareholder in late 1987, he
immediately began fighting with management, charging it was not
doing enough to raise the company's stock price.
   He proposed a takeover of Texaco valued at $14.5 billion and
then tried and failed to unseat the company's board in a proxy
fight. Icahn said that if he won control of Texaco, the company's
assets would be sold and the proceeds distributed to Texaco
shareholders.
   In early 1989, after Texaco undertook a major restructuring that
included the sale of billions of dollars in assets and payment of a
special dividend to stockholders, Icahn reached a standstill
agreement with the company. Several months later, he sold his stake
for $2.07 billion, and has since returned his attention to USX.
   Gregory Drahuschak, a steel industry analyst with Butcher &amp;
Singer in Pittsburgh, predicted that USX ultimately would sell
Marathon, but ``management wants to determine when it's going to be
done.''
   Icahn would find some support among USX shareholders who have
waited for the company's stock price to go up, ``but it will not go
down without a heck of a battle,'' said Drahuschak.
   George Zimmermann, director of research at Gruntal &amp; Co., said
of Icahn, ``he has about a 50-50 chance'' of winning a proxy fight
because of a growing trend toward shareholder rights among U.S.
corporations.
   Zimmerman said a sale of Marathon might help boost the price of
USX's stock, but he doubted it could go much higher than its
current level. He said USX's profits _ which were up more than 20
percent through the first three quarters of 1989 _ were not
expected to coninue at that level in 1990.

   News of a long-awaited cut in the bank prime
lending rate helped inspire a moderate rally in the stock market
Monday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 21.12 to 2,794.37,
recouping nearly all of Friday's 22.83-point loss.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
805 up, 717 down and 470 unchanged.
   Numerous banks across the country lowered their prime rates from

   Open-market money rates, which reflect the most current

   Philip Morris led the active list, down 1&lsqb; at 41 following a

   Jeff H. Reynolds, who is seeking control of
financially struggling Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. in return for a
$197 million investment, has a business address that is a mail-drop.
   His U.S. company, Weatherby Investments Inc., does not appear to
be traded publicly as he contends, officials said Monday.
   The 28-year-old Texan, little known on the investment scene,
said in a news release last week that he was negotiating with Bond
Holdings, the Australian holding company. The release listed an
answering service as a contact number.
   The answering service forwarded calls about the offer to
Reynolds mother's house in Houston, where he discussed his business
and personal history in a telephone call Monday morning. Messages
left in later follow-up calls to a brother and an answering machine
at the house were not returned.
   Among the unanswered questions are:
   _Why his news release said his Weatherby Investments Inc. is an
over-the-counter stock and why he said it was traded
over-the-counter on the ``pink sheet'' distributed by the National
Quotation Bureau.
   The National Quotation Bureau and the National Association of
Securities Dealers have no record of Weatherby, and it is not
listed in guides to over-the-counter stocks.
   Reynolds said Monday Weatherby had earlier been known as
California Pacific Industries, and he intended to change the name
back. But there was no listing under that name either.
   _Why the address and suite to which investors are invited to
send questions is a private mail-drop box in Beverly Hills, a
year-and-a-half after Reynolds says he moved his operations from
Texas to California.
   In the conversation early Monday, Reynolds said his work was
done from several offices, including an unspecified location in
Century City, but he gave no address and said he is still looking
for a central location.
   Reynolds describes himself as an intensely private businessman,
who used to walk in his bankers' side doors because he favored
jeans and cutoffs. He says he still feels more comfortable in a
sweatsuit, crunching numbers at a computer terminal, than in a suit
and tie.
   ``I've always had a real hardcore attitude about other
businesses and banks _ if they're going to deal with me they're
going to have to know me and put up with me,'' he said. ``I'm not
going to fit into their world.''
   Bond, the holding company whose Australian brewing interests are
in the hand of receivers, says it will listen to offers from
Reynolds, who says Weatherby is a division of Singapore-based
California Pacific International Pte Ltd.
   Reynolds says he is descended from a long line of oilmen in
Throckmorton, Texas, and locals there say books have been written
about the Reynolds clan and its intermarriages with the even more
famous Matthews cattle and oil family.
   Reynolds said he took freshman English and biology classes at
the University of Texas and a few business classes at various
colleges before succumbing to entrepreneurial urges.
   He got started in business by importing ``gray market'' cars,
upgrading them to meet American standards and selling them at a
profit, he said.
   ``Actually I was living in Austin and a few of my frat brothers
got in with me,'' Reynolds said. ``We had some cash flow and it
looked pretty good and I said, `The hell with this' (college
career).''
   As it stands now, he says he's confident he can find refinancing
for Bond's $6 billion debt. Bond says it wants to see more details,
and skeptics in the international investment community say they
have never heard of Reynolds or his operations.
   Reynolds says he got a real-estate broker's license in Texas in
1983 and got involved in development companies. He also says he has
dabbled in a clay-tile factory in France.

<HEAD>Limit Up for Frozen Pork Bellies, OJ</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIO FOX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Futures prices for both frozen pork bellies and orange juice
were up the limit on Monday _ a rerun of last week's trading on
both markets.
   In other futures trading, grains were mostly higher, but
precious metals and energy products were lower.
   Prices for frozen pork bellies for four contracts to be
delivered by midsummer were all up the 2-cent limit on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange for the third straight day.
   ``It's a 600 point rally. The market reaction is following
through from the USDA's hog and pig inventory report of last week
and from better demand for the product,'' said Paul Hare of Linnco
Futures Inc.
   Another livestock analyst in Chicago, Dale Benson of Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc, said the rally also has been buoyed by higher prices
on the cash market.
   ``We're talking 55 to 57 cents on the cash market. That's up
about 12 cents in five days,'' he said.
   Futures prices for live hogs followed pork bellies higher,
analysts agreed.
   Cattle prices were mostly lower as traders said they were
worried about expectations for reduced demands for beef.
   Cattle settled .20 cent lower to .25 cent higher, with the
contract for February at 76.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were
.03 cent lower to .10 cent higher, with January at 84.67 cents a
pound; live hogs were .25 cent to .65 cent higher, with February at
51.62 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were 1.45 cents to
2.00 cents higher, with February at 55.47.
   Heightened concerns over Florida's frost in December sent frozen
orange juice futures up the limit again this morning as the New
York Cotton Exchange imposed a brief trading suspension to sort
orders and adjust daily trading limits.
   ``We feel the situation is much more critical than anybody has
seen before. We think there might be damage beyond the damage to
the foilage _ that there may be some limb or wood damage that could
affect next year's crop,'' said Celeste Georgakis, a New York
analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc.
   ``There's a lot of anxiety on the part of traders because of the
possibility of the damage to next year's crop,'' she said. ``We
should know more when the USDA report comes out Thursday.''
   Frozen orange juice settled 5 cents to 13.25 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in January at $1.93 a pound.
   Export news helped grain and soybean prices to rise on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``There was a pretty good rally in soyoil that gave soybeans a
good boost,'' said Joel Karlin, analyst with Research Department
Inc. ``India bought into the palm oil market. African countries
have shown some interest in vegetable oils, too.''
   Corn was supported by a rumor that the Soviet Union might be
interested in as much as 1 million metric tons of the commodity, he
said.
   The U.S. Agriculture Department confirmed rumors that China had
bid for 300,000 metric tons of U.S. wheat, and rumors persisted
that the Chinese would bid for 300,000 metric tons more, said Susan
Leighty, grains analyst in New York with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
   Wheat settled unchanged to 1\ cents higher to with the contract
for March at $4.10 a bushel; corn was \ cent to 1{ cent higher,
with March at $2.39 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1} cents lower,
with March at $1.50}, and soybeans were 1{ cents to 6{ cents
higher, with January at $5.70} a bushel.
   Oil prices plummeted on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Easing
of cold weather concerns weighed on heating oil prices while
reports of higher OPEC output sent crude futures downward,
according to analysts.
   Crude oil settled 35 cents to $1.46 lower, with the contract for
delivery in February at $21.62 a barrel; heating oil was 1.18 cents
to 3.50 cents lower, with February at 64.33 cents a gallon; and
unleaded gasoline was 2.9 cents to 3.74 cents lower, with February
at 58.48 cents a gallon.
   Lower interest rates and easing of concerns over world trouble
spots sent precious metals prices tumbling on the Commodity
Exchange in New York, traders said.
   Several major banks on Monday lowered their prime lending rate
from 10.5 percent to 10 percent.
   Gold settled $3.30 to $3.70 lower, with the contract for
delivery in January at $403 a troy ounce; and silver was 7.4 to 7.5
cents lower, with January at $5.24 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Energy Prices in Steep Slide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures tumbled Monday, led by a steep
slide in prices of wholesale home heating oil and unleaded gasoline.
   The sell-off on the New York Mercantile Exchange reflected
profit-taking, anticipation of lower demand due to milder weather,
expectations of a buildup in crude oil stocks and internal market
forces, energy market analysts said.
   Refined petroleum prices experienced the biggest price drops.
   Heating oil for February delivery plummeted 3.50 cents to 64.33
cents a gallon, adding to the accumulated loss of 10.37 cents
suffered in the two previous trading sessions. March heating oil
fell 2.83 cents to 59.40 cents a gallon and later delivery months
posted more moderate declines.
   The contract for February delivery of unleaded gasoline plunged
3.74 cents to 58.48 cents a gallon after falling 3.07 cents on
Friday. Since last Thursday the contract has lost 8.75 cents.
Contracts for delivery during March through May each closed down 3
cents a gallon.
   The February contract of West Texas Intermediate, the leading
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell $1.46 to $21.62 per 42-gallon barrel
after losing 33 cents on Friday. Other delivery months also went
down.
   Jim Fiedler, a vice president at E.D.&amp;F. Man International
Futures Inc., said part of the selling was a sort of reflex action
after the sharp runup in prices over recent weeks.
   ``It probably was overbought and now it probably will be
oversold,'' he said.
   Traders sold to collect profits amassed during the prolonged
rally in the energy futures pits, he said. With higher temperatures
forecast there also is speculation that demand might not be as
great as previously believed.
   Another incentive to sell came from estimates that industry
figures due Tuesday will show a large rise in crude oil
inventories. Fiedler said problems that forced refineries to
temporarily halt operations in the past week or so caused crude
stocks to rise.
   The American Petroleum Institute will issue its weekly report on
production and stocks after the market closes on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Coniston Deadline Arrives On UAL Corp. Buyout Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp. shares fell Monday after a deadline set
by a major shareholder for the company to come up with a new
employee buyout plan arrived without any apparent progress.
   The stock fell $2.87{ a share to $156.62{ on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The investor group Coniston Partners said last month that it
would press for a recapitalization of UAL unless the United
Airlines parent presented a buyout plan, preferably one involving
employee stock ownership, by Monday.
   No proposals were disclosed by late in the day. Coniston leaders
and spokesmen for the UAL pilots and machinists unions did not
return telephone calls. UAL spokesman Rob Doughty said he couldn't
comment on the buyout issue.
   A spokeswomen for United's flight attendants union said she had
no information indicating that any efforts were underway to come up
with a plan.
   ``We know of nothing going on right now with any buyout plan _
we know of no meetings and no dates for meetings,'' said Bobbie
Pilkington, spokeswoman for United's chapter of the Association of
Flight Attendants. She added that she believed the situation was
quiet because ``no one is taking it (the deadline) very seriously.''
   UAL last week said it was accelerating its schedule for talks
with non-union employees over a possible buyout plan, although the
company's schedule indicated it was likely to miss Coniston's
deadline. Those talks are to begin Wednesday.
   UAL management already has met with leaders of United's pilot
and flight attendant unions over possible employee buyout of the
company.
   Coniston, which owns 11.8 percent of UAL's stock, said Dec. 20
that it was dissatisfied with progress being made toward sale or
restructuring of the company that would boost its stock price.
   It said that if Coniston and the UAL board couldn't agree on a
recapitalization plan, Coniston might proceed with a plan to
solicit shareholder consent to oust 13 of UAL's 15 directors and
take majority control of the board.
   A pilot-management plan to buy the company for $6.75 billion, or
$300 a share, failed last fall when banks refused to finance it.
   After that, the board reportedly was seeking employee support
for a proposal that would value the company at $240 a share, or
$5.443 billion.
   Samuel Buttrick, who follows UAL for Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. in
Washington, D.C., said he viewed Coniston's buyout plan deadline
mainly as an attempt to get UAL to move more quickly.
   ``I've regarded it all along as a soft deadline,'' said
Buttrick. ``Clearly if any progress is being made, it is at a very
slow pace. ...It's a very difficult deal to bring together.''

   Ivan F. Boesky's main arbitrage fund has been
liquidated and $248 million distributed to its limited partners to
settle one of many claims against the former Wall Street
speculator, attorneys said Monday.
   In addition, some lawsuits against the partnership, CX Partners
LP, have been settled and others placed on hold in Manhattan
federal court, where more than two dozen class-action lawsuits
against Boesky and affiliated entities await resolution.
   The agreement between CX Partners and its 46 investors was
reached after more than three years of discussions and litigation
dating to Boesky's November 1986 settlement of insider trading
charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
   David R. Herwitz, liquidating trustee for CX Partners, said the
agreement was ``a major step in the resolution of disputes stemming
from Mr. Boesky's conduct.''
   Still pending in the case that rocked Wall Street are completion
of an SEC plan to use $50 million paid by Boesky to reimburse
individual investors who can prove they were defrauded by his
trading.
   Under the agreement liquidating CX Partners, formerly known as
Ivan F. Boesky &amp; Co., most of the limited partners received 100
percent of their investment, Herwitz said.
   The total equity investment in the fund, which Boesky formed in
March 1986 to invest in stocks of potential takeover targets, was
$338 million. But Boesky and his wife surrendered all their
interests in the enterprise and some partners did not receive full
compensation.
   The limited partnerships included insurance companies, financial
institutions and individual investors. Some future disbursements to
the partnerships are possible, Herwitz said.
   Other details of the agreement were not made public, but sources
familiar with the case said the Boeskys' interest in the fund
totaled around $10 million.
   Guinness PLC, the largest holder in the fund with a $100 million
stake, received just $37 million of its claim, said George
Reycraft, a lawyer for the limited partners.
   Other large stakes in the fund reportedly included $28 million
by Jeffrey M. Picower of New York, its largest investor; $10
million by Lincoln National Life Insurance Co.; $10 million by
Britain's Water Authorities Superannuation Fund; and $6 million by
New York investor Milton Dresner.
   Monday's settlement included an agreement with Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. resolving a series of issues surrounding the limited
partners' investments. Drexel had an $8 million equity stake in the
Boesky fund and owned $20 million of its debt.
   Reycraft said Drexel received the full $20 million for the debt
but no interest or any of its equity investment. Under the
agreement, Drexel will be dropped as a defendant in the
Boesky-related lawsuits, he said.
   But Reycraft said the limited partners planned to proceed with
litigation against Boesky and others, including former Drexel
financier Michael Milken and admitted securities felons Dennis
Levine and Martin Siegel.
   A Delaware court last year ruled that Drexel was entitled to get
its money back before or at the same time as the partners. Drexel
spokesman Steven Andreder declined to comment on the agreement,
saying it was confidential.
   Boesky, 52, is due to be released in April from a Brooklyn
halfway house where he is completing a three-year prison term.
Boesky pleaded guilty to one count of violating federal securities
laws and paid $100 million to settle charges he led a network of
illegal trading using inside information.
   The government is using $50 million of the money to compensate
investors who can prove they were victimized by Boesky's trading.
SEC officials had set Jan. 15 target date to establish a plan to
distibute the money.
   ``We are working toward achieving a plan for distribution of the
money but that may or may not have anything to do with an
investors' settlement,'' said John H. Sturc, an SEC associate
enforcement director.
   Monday's settlements could help speed resolution of a mountain
of lawsuits, including class-action shareholder cases and other
litigation, attorneys said. Some of the charges involving CX
Partners either have been settled or placed on hold, according to
lawyers involved in the case.
   The lawsuits are consolidated before U.S. District Judge Milton
Pollack.
   ``Some of these lawsuits will be reduced, abated or limited,''
Herwitz said. ``Part of what is happening is people are going to
try to save a dollar or two on litgation costs.''
   Boesky and the entities he once controlled were inundated with
lawsuits after federal authorities disclosed his alleged insider
trading activities. Most of the lawsuits are by shareholders who
were selling stock at the time Boesky and his associates were
buying.

   A Connecticut man who allegedly traded on
inside information obtained when one of his tenants opened someone
else's mail agreed to pay almost $20,000 in fines and penalties,
federal officials said Monday.
   The misappropriated information concerned a 1988 tender offer
for Stanadyne Inc. by Emhart Corp., the Securities and Exchange
Commission said.
   The SEC accused Thaddeus Pencikowski, 37, of Farmington, Conn.,
of making $9,093 in alleged illegal profits after buying 750 shares
of Stanadyne common stock Jan. 8, 1988 with confidential
information allegedly supplied to him by Bruce J. Warren, also 37,
of Plainville, Conn.
   Both men settled the civil charges without admitting or denying
wrongdoing.
   Harry J. Weiss, an attorney with the SEC's Enforcement Division,
said no financial penalty was sought against Warren because he did
not trade for himself.
   According to the SEC, Warren agreed to receive a Stanadyne
director's mail while the director was away. Warren's computer
graphics company and the director's office were in the same
building, which was owned and managed by Pencikowski.
   The SEC accused Warren of violating a ``duty of trust and
confidence'' to the Stanadyne director when he revealed the
contents of a letter to Pencikowski concerning the Emhart offer.
   ``The complaint alleged Mr. Warren misappropriated information
from the director and then tipped Mr. Pencikowski,'' Weiss said.
   Pencikowski allegedly bought 750 Stanadyne shares at $26.50 per
share on Jan. 8 and sold them for $39 a share on Jan. 11, 1988 _
the day the Emhart offer was made public.
   According to the SEC, Pencikowski agreed to disgorge $10,847 in
alleged illegal profits plus interest as well as a penalty equal to
his alleged profits of $9,093.
   Pencikowski's lawyer, Vincent Dowling, was not in his office
when called for comment. Warren's lwyer, Steven Sach, declined
comment until he spoke with his client.

<TEXT>
   Digital audio tape decks, which offer the sound
fidelity of compact discs along with the capability to record,
could be sold in the United States by the summer, two leading
Japanese manufacturers say.
   Both Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., which produces the
Panasonic and Technics brands, and Sony Corp. say they hope to
introduce the DAT recorders in the U.S. market sometime this year.
   Sony was vague on its plans, but Matsushita said at this week's
Consumer Electronics Show that it will market a home recorder this
summer at a price of about $1,300.
   The recorders, long-awaited by audio buffs, have been on sale
for several years overseas, but their introduction to the U.S.
market had been held up by record companies, who feared DAT's
ability to make high-quality tape recordings will encourage
pirating and cut into their compact disc sales.
   That issue was for the most part resolved last summer, however,
when an agreement was reached on new technology that would allow
direct copying onto a digital audio tape, but would not allow
unlimited copies to be made of those tapes.
   Manufacturers say they hope to capture a large segment of the
high-end audio market with the recorders despite their steep price
tag. In addition, blank DAT cassettes will cost $12 to $18, or more
than twice the price of conventional blank cassettes. The recording
time of the DAT tapes is similar to that of conventional cassettes.
   ``I think it has the capability of being a very large market,''
said John Bermingham, president of Sony's U.S. tape division.
``Compact discs and digital audio tape will exist together like LP
albums and cassettes did before.''
   Bermingham said Sony envisions DAT tapes, which are about half
the size of normal cassette tapes, being used in its popular
Walkman stereos and in car stereos. A consumer could record onto
the tapes in his home tape deck and use them in the other
applications, he said.
   ``You have some problems now with (portable and car) CD's with
taking them jogging or on a rough road,'' Bermingham said. ``With
DAT, you wouldn't have that problem.''
   Both DATs and CDs use digital technology to reproduce music,
offering little distortion and high dynamic range. In addition, DAT
tapes lack the ``hiss'' that plagues conventional tape, and many
audiophiles believe it produces a deeper and more rich sound than
compact discs.
   But sales have been disappointing during the three years DAT
equipment has beem on the market in Japan because of high prices
and initial opposition from record industry groups.
   Under the July agreement, which still must be codified by
federal legislation, new DAT equipment will be able to make
near-perfect direct digital recordings from digital sources such as
CDs, but will add a ``flag'' signal to the tape to prevent any
second-generation copies from being made from the tape.
   While Sony and Matsushita were both displaying DAT recorders at
the electronics show, General Electric Audio Products announced at
the show that it has developed what it calls the first compact disc
player that allows recording and re-recording.
   A spokesman for the company, which is owned by Thomson SA of
France, called the system the ``first major advancement in the
format since CD technology was introduced,'' but said it will not
be available to consumers for at least a year.
   The new system uses magneto optical discs for recording, but is
playback compatible with CDs now on the market.
   Though GE claimed its recorder was the first, Sony said in
October that it also had developed a magneto optical CD recorder,
thought it also was not yet ready for market.

   The U.S. dollar%&amp;fll slightly in early trading
against the Japanese yen Tuesday, while share prices on the To;yS
Stock Exchange lost marginally.
   The dollar started trading at 144.25 yen, down 0$20 yen from
Monday's close here of 144.52 yen. It finished at 144.14 yen in New
York overnight.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's slip followed its simil!s}
downswing in the New York market Monday after a cut in U.S.
commercial banks' prime lendin7 Nate.
   A dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said the demand for the dollar
remained strong, despite a half percentage point cut in the U.S.
prime rate to 10 percent.
   The prime-rate cut reflects more liberal credit polic)d
by the  ...
  ...  Federal Reserve, the U.S. central bank, a.ePwill lower borrowing
costs for businesses and consumers.
   The prime is a rate on short-term loans granted by commercial
banks to their most credit-worthy customers.
   Lower interest rates in the United States tend to make
dolxa}-denominated investments less attractive.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 2.J0 points Monday, shed 32.65 points, or
0.08 percent, shortly after the market opened to move to 38,262.31.
