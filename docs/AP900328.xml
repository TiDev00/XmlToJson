   Gov. Cecil Andrus said Wednesday his
decision about signing the most restrictive state abortion law
won't be swayed by a threatened boycott of Idaho potatoes and other
products by some abortion-rights activists.
   ``I'm going to do what I think is right,'' said Andrus, who
promised to act on the bill by Saturday. ``The economic things,
those I'm going to have to handle no matter how it plays out.''
   Andrus said the boycott threat from National Organization for
Women President Molly Yard has prompted calls from leaders of
Idaho's food processing industry and its printing, travel and
resort businesses.
   ``All are highly concerned about this,'' Andrus said. ``Each of
them has experienced cancellations.''
   While continuing his silence on his intentions for the bill, the
governor said: ``There's concern on my part. ... But economics is
not going to be the deciding issue on this.''
   The bill would ban abortion except in cases of non-statutory
rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim is under age
18, severe fetal deformity or pregnancies that threaten the health
of the mother. It would take effect July 1 if signed.
   It would ban more than 90 percent of the 1,500 abortions
performed in Idaho each year.
   The governor is a longtime opponent of abortion except in cases
of rape, incest and to save the life of the woman. He said he has
consulted legal scholars, church officials and others but wouldn't
discuss their advice.
   State officials said the monetary effect of the cancellations
was still being assessed. Andrus would not identify any of the
businesses, describing one as a very large printing company doing
business all over the nation.
   ``There's too much outside influence,'' Andrus said. ``There are
too many out-of-state experts involved in this. If they just give
us time, we Idahoans can resolve this.''
   Commerce Director James Hawkins said several businesses have
reported cancellations. Others have received cancellation threats
if the bill becomes law, he said.
   More than 600 anti-abortion activists rallied Wednesday on the
steps of the Capitol to press their case.
   In the evening, nearly 1,000 pro-choice activists gathered at
the Capitol for their eighth straight candlelight vigil.
   Some legal experts maintain the bill is so restrictive it will
not stand the scrutiny of the U.S. Supreme Court _ a test
abortion-rights advocates have promised if the bill becomes law.
   Anti-abortion activists designed the bill to test the court's
commitment to legalized abortion.
   Hawkins said anti-abortion forces have contacted the state with
promises to buy more Idaho products, although those offers have
been few compared to the boycott threats.
   In Charleston, W.Va., activists were adding bags of Idaho
potatoes to their grocery lists.
   ``We're issuing a challenge to the God-fearing people of West
Virginia,'' said Avis Hill, spokesman for the 200-member West
Virginia Parents for Life and pastor of Touching Jesus Fellowship
in Alum Creek. ``We're saying to them, if they choose not to buy
Idaho potatoes, we'll buy an extra bag and give it to a food
pantry.''
   Idaho State Sen. Marti Calabretta, the leading opponent of the
bill, said she had contacted pro-choice activists across the
country, including Yard, in an unsuccessful attempt to head off
boycott talk.
   ``I tried to make the persuasive case that it was not in the
best interests of those of us who have been fighting this bill,''
she said. ``Evidently the people I talked to had no influence on
what's happening.''
   She said any successful boycott would jeopardize state support
for education and social services and hit hardest at the employees
in food processing plants and other industries _ many of whom also
oppose the bill.
   ``It's sad that Idaho is the battleground for national interests
to wage their pitched battles,'' Calabretta said.

   A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a
lawsuit filed by striking bus drivers claiming that Greyhound bus
operations in Cleveland are unsafe, saying he doesn't have
jurisdiction in the case.
   ``I'd like to have jurisdiction, because I'd like to help ...
settle the strike,'' U.S. District Judge Alvin I. Krenzler said in
turning down a request by the bus drivers union for an injunction
against Greyhound.
   Krenzler agreed with attorneys for the country's only nationwide
bus line who said the complaint should be handled through the
proper administrative agency such as the U.S. Department of
Transportation or the U.S. attorney general.
   The Cleveland complaint appeared to be the first such
strike-related lawsuit filed against the company, Greyhound
spokeswoman Melanie Scofield said from the bus line's Dallas
headquarters.
   Cleveland Greyhound workers filed the civil lawsuit March 12,
alleging that operations in Cleveland are unsafe because
replacement drivers weren't qualified and weren't trained according
to federal guidelines.
   The lawsuit also charged that the company failed to maintain
buses during the nationwide walkout that began March 2.
   Alan Belkin, attorney for the union, said he will file the
complaint with the Transportation Department.
   ``Hopefully, the DOT will subpoena the records we asked for with
this suit,'' Belkin said. ``The people monitoring the (Greyhound
bus) garage here haven't seen any maintenance going on.''
   The complaint against Greyhound Lines Inc. in Cleveland was
filed by Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1043, its president,
Charles F. Flanagan; and Guy Selinka, a striker injured in the
picket line in Cleveland on March 2.
   The union had sought a preliminary and permanent injunction
against operating buses that haven't been properly maintained and
that are driven by replacement employees not adequately trained.
   The union local represents about 130 workers.
   The company has said the lawsuit was a ploy to stop the bus
line's operations.
   More than 9,000 Greyhound drivers, maintenance workers and
office employees walked off the job nationwide March 2 over wages,
job security and grievance procedures.
   Since then, there have been reports of at least 21 shootings and
other incidents.

   Hundreds of mourners, many weeping, others
calling for revenge, offered their prayers at a funeral home
Wednesday for 17 victims of the city's deadliest fire in 79 years.
   Officials, meanwhile, began preparations for a grim airlift of
the dead to their Honduran homeland. The Red Cross has asked the
New York National Guard to help transport the bodies, an aide to
Gov. Mario Cuomo said.
   A funeral Mass Wednesday evening at St. Joseph's Catholic Church
drew 1,500 people, while 1,000 others who could not get in stood
outside the church during the service.
   Earlier, outside the Bronx funeral home across the street from
St. Joseph's, the street was crowded with people waiting to pay
their respects to the victims. The dead were among 87 people killed
early Sunday inside the Happy Land social club in the Bronx, just
10 blocks away.
   Three women fainted outside the funeral home, collapsing in
front of the crowd waiting to enter. At least 15 others needed
medical assistance.
   Jose Alvarez, mourning his brother Denny, 22, left the Rivera
Funeral Home sobbing and clinging to his cousin and a friend.
   Across the street on the steps of the church, Denny's father
tearfully vented his rage at Julio Gonzalez, 36, the man accused of
setting the fatal fire in a quarrel with an ex-girlfriend.
   ``They ought to take him and give him a public hanging,'' Pedro
Alvarez said. ``People like that don't deserve to live.''
   Two women emerged from the home screaming the names of dead
relatives. Others expressed disbelief their friends were gone.
   ``He doesn't look like him. He looks too old,'' said Katy
Carval, 17, after seeing former classmate Israel Bulnes, 18, who
died with his girlfriend.
   Earlier in the day, family members of the victims met with
American Red Cross officials at a public school near the burned-out
red brick building to receive the belongings each victim carried or
wore when the fire struck.
   Outside the school, Carlos Pena clutched a manila envelope that
held a watch, a set of keys, and some cash _ things his brother
Eli, 26, had with him early Sunday at the doomed Happy Land club.
   The watch came with Eli from Honduras, and Carlos said the
timepiece would now be his. ``It means a lot, a reminder,'' he said.
   Also Wednesday, a civil court hearing did not determine whether
the club operator's widow should replace her husband, Elias Colon,
in an eviction lawsuit brought by the landlord, One Peach
Associates.
   Jay Weiss, husband of actress Kathleen Turner, is part owner of
One Peach, which held a 49-year lease on the building from one of
New York's biggest landlords, Alex DiLorenzo III.
   The court hearing did not address responsibility for the fire or
whether the landlords were aware of a city effort to close the club
because it was illegal and unsafe.
   While wakes were held Wednesday, funeral arrangements still were
being made.
   The Honduran government said it expected the bodies of 75 fire
victims to begin arriving late this week at San Pedro Sula in
northwestern Honduras.
   More than one-third of the Hondurans were from Puerto Cortes, a
Caribbean port 135 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa, said Information
Minister Nahum Valladares.
   The Honduran government declared three days of national mourning
Wednesday, and said 78 victims had been identified as Honduran.
   The government was negotiating with Eastern Airlines to take the
bodies from New York to Miami, where they would be transferred to
the Honduran airline Tan-Sahsa, said the minister.
   The airline was working with the Red Cross to provide special
fares for relatives wishing to attend the funerals in Honduras,
said spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak. Tan-Sahsa and the Costa Rican
carrier Lacsa also offered to help, said Red Cross spokesman Larry
Mackler.
   In Washington, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., called on the
Air Force to donate use of a transport plane to return fire victims
for burial in their homelands of Honduras and the Dominican
Republic.
   ``Providing an Air Force plane would be a humanitarian gesture
to the families of the victims,'' she said in a letter to Air Force
Secretary Donald Rice. ``Moreover, it would help express America's
sorrow for the tragedy and our affection for our neighbors in the
hemisphere.''
   An Air Force spokesman, Lt. Col. Darrell Hayes, said Rice has
the matter ``under consideration.''

   Scientists have found evidence that
people with breast or pancreatic cancer naturally mount an attack
on their tumors, raising hopes for a treatment that might make the
reaction more powerful.
   Patients with those diseases produce tumor-killing white blood
cells that healthy people lack, said researcher Olivera Finn.
   She and colleagues have identified a substance on cancer cells
that appears to be the target of the attack, and they hope that a
vaccine-like treatment might boost the anti-cancer response, she
said Tuesday.
   Finn, an assistant professor in the department of microbiology
and immunology at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham,
N.C., spoke at a science writers seminar sponsored by the American
Cancer Society.
   More than 150,000 cases of breast cancer and 28,000 cases of
pancreatic cancer are expected to be diagnosed this year.
   Finn, with graduate students Donna Barnd and Keith Jerome, found
that patients with either cancer produced immune system cells that
could kill cancer cells while ignoring normal ones. That occurred
in all 14 pancreatic cancer patients and all six breast cancer
patients studied, Finn said.
   Since no such cells could be found in healthy patients, they
seem to come from a natural response to the tumors, she said.
   The target of the killer cells was found to be epithelial cell
mucin, which is found on the tumor cells, Finn said.
   Tumors probably survive the attack by growing faster than killer
cells can destroy them, she said. Or perhaps killer cells go after
mucin that tumor cells secrete in large amounts into the
bloodstream, instead of concentrating their attack on the tumor
cells themselves.
   A vaccine based on mucin might boost the immune system response
and make it more effective against the cancer, she said.
   The next step is to do large studies of patients with breast or
pancreatic cancer to see how strong the natural immune system
reponse is, she said. A vaccine may be ready for testing within a
few years, she said.
   Dr. Drew Pardoll of the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine
cautioned in a telephone interview that mucin is also produced by
some normal cells in the body. That could present a problem if one
wants to encourage an immune system attack on the substance, he
said.
   But Finn said the killer cells do not destroy normal cells in
the test tube. In the body, she said, the anatomy of organs that
contain mucin-bearing normal cells appears to shield those cells
from contact with the immune system.
   In another presentation, Patricia Steeg of the National Cancer
Institute reported the discovery of a gene that appears to suppress
a cancer cell's ability to spread within the body.
   In several kinds of cancer, the more active the gene was, the
less ability the cancer had to spread, she said.
   Upcoming studies will see if the level of activity of the gene,
called nm23, can predict the spreading behavior of breast, lung,
bladder and prostate cancer cells, she said.
   If the gene does suppress spreading, called metastasis, it may
be useful as a tool to find drugs that can hinder that process, she
said.
   Also at the meeting, Dr. Dennis Slamon of the University of
California, Los Angeles, School of Medicine presented an update on
studies of another gene, called HER-2@neu.
   Patients whose breast or ovarian cancers show abnormally high
numbers of copies of this gene per cancer cell had faster relapses
and shorter survival times, he said.
   The extra gene copies lead to extra copies of a protein called a
receptor on the cell surface, which may give the cell a growth
advantage, he said. The receptor probably snares some kind of
growth-promoting substance for the cell's use, he said.
   In one experiment, the growth of human breast cancers implanted
in mice declined 80 percent when the receptor's functioning was
blocked by proteins called monoclonal antibodies, Slamon said. When
the antibodies were removed, the suppression disappeared, he said.
   Such antibodies may prove useful someday in therapy, he said.

<HEAD>Committee Approves Nicaragua-Panama Aid Bill _ With Major
Additions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's request for $800 million to
help new democracies in Panama and Nicaragua is over its first
congressional hurdle, but inflated to $2.4 billion by the addition
of an array of domestic spending.
   The House Appropriations Committee gave voice vote approval to
the money bill late Tuesday after cutting $80 million from the
White House's $500 million request for Panama and leaving the $300
million Nicaragua package intact.
   Battles still lie ahead for the bill, however, and prospects
dimmed that it could win final passage by Bush's April 5 deadline.
The measure is expected to go to the full House next week, then
must win Senate approval.
   One of the most potentially divisive issues _ whether to add
restrictions on U.S. aid to El Salvador _ was not addressed by the
appropriations panel.
   That disagreement was being fought in the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, which was working on a separate bill needed to implement
the Panama and Nicaragua aid.
   Bush is seeking $800 million for the new governments of
President Guillermo Endara in Panama and President-elect Violeta
Chamorro in Nicaragua to help both countries' damaged economies and
to offer a visible demonstration of the benefits of democracy.
   The administration argues that the need is particularly acute in
Nicaragua, where the economy is in ruins after a decade of civil
war and where supplies are needed for the planting season that
begins in a few weeks.
   While the panel approved Bush's full $300 million Nicaragua
request, it cut the Panama package to $420 million, freeing $80
million for other areas where the president had not sought money.
   Those included $25 million to help feed refugees, primarily in
Africa; $5 million to help settle Soviet Jews emigrating to Israel;
$15 million in economic aid to eastern Caribbean countries; $5
million to repair damage in the same region from Hurricane Hugo;
$10 million for the newly independent African country of Namibia;
$10 million to promote democracy in South Africa; $2.5 million for
Zambia; $2.5 million for Mozambique, and $5 million in African
development aid not earmarked for a specific country.
   The bill also contains $70 million Bush asked to bolster the
fund for U.S. resettlement of refugees to handle an increase of
27,000 in the number coming to the United States this year. Most of
those are Jews emigrating from the Soviet Union.
   And the measure would offer $400 million in housing loan
guarantees to Israel to help settle Soviet Jews there. In separate
action on Tuesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved
provisions giving Israel a cut rate on loan origination fees for
the package, saving that country $3 million along with the lower
interest rate it would enjoy on the 30-year loan.
   But as it approved those elements of Bush's request, the
committee added $1.6 billion for a host of politically favored
domestic programs.
   These included $111 million for storm and flood disaster relief
in the Southeast, $50 million for additional low-income energy
assistance for the Northeast, $190 million for veterans' pensions
and $50 million for veterans' medical care.
   Also included in the bill were $29 million for judicial
salaries, $510 million to make up an expected shortfall in the food
stamp program and $96 million to be shifted to states from the
unemployment trust fund to cover unexpected administrative costs
due to higher jobless rates.
   The committee also adopted an amendment offered by Rep. Sidney
Yates, D-Ill., to add $442 million for U.S. Forest Service
firefighting costs.
   The package is to be financed through cuts totaling $1.8 billion
in the Pentagon budget for this year, taken largely from operation
and maintenance accounts, weapons procurement and research and
development.
   That left the overall package still nearly $600 million in the
red, which would require a waiver of Gramm-Rudman budget reduction
strictures when the measure is brought before the full House. The
Gramm-Rudman law requires that any new spending be fully offset by
reductions in other areas of the budget, resulting in no net
increase in the deficit.

<HEAD>Human Rights Abuses Alleged in Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International today urged Argentina to
investigate allegations of torture, disappearances and killings of
members of an opposition group that attacked an army barracks last
year.
   The group's report made some of the broadest charges of human
rights abuses since a civilian government replaced a military
dictatorship that was responsible for the kidnappings and deaths of
thousands of people.
   Amnesty detailed violations against members of the small leftist
Movement for the Fatherland, which tried to take over an army base
on the outskirts of Buenos Aires.
   Twenty-eight attackers and 11 soldiers and police officers died
in the Jan. 23, 1989 attack on the La Tablada base. Sixty law
officers were wounded and 13 attackers arrested.
   The human rights group urged Argentina's president, Carlos
Menem, to order an inquiry. In its 21-page report, the group says
there ``appears to be strong evidence'' that two attackers listed
as being killed in combat were summarily executed after
surrendering.
   The report also says hree others disappeared after being
captured and that there was medical evidence to support prisoners'
allegations they were tortured while in custody.
   Amnesty said Argentina's attorney general promised prompt
inquiries into these complaints in April. By the end of the year,
the investigating magistrate had reached a decision in only one
case.
   The report also says some investigations were flawed. It cited
autopsy procedures, which it said were not of a high enough
standard to determine whether deaths had occurred in combat or were
the result of executions.
   The report alleges that security forces raided private homes,
often without warrants, following the attack on the base. It says
they threatened and in some cases tortured suspected sympathizers.
   Armed plainclothes officers reportedly stormed one home without
formally identifying themselves or producing a warrant, tortured
the couple, raped the wife and threatened to kill their
11-month-old child, the document alleges.
   Four women and 16 men, including a Roman Catholic priest, were
convicted in October of planning or carrying out the attack on the
military base and given sentences ranging from 10 years to life in
prison.
   The attackers said they believed a military coup was imminent
and that it was being coordinated at the barracks by rebel officers.
   Argentina was frequently criticized for widespread human rights
abuses during the 1976-83 military dictatorship, but the subsequent
civilian government promised to return to the ``rule of law'' and
prosecuted the military leaders for killings, torture and
abductions under their ``dirty war'' against suspected leftists.
   A government commission found 10,000 people were ``disappeared''
by security and paramilitary forces in the ``dirty war,'' but human
rights organizations contend up to 30,000 were killed.

<HEAD>Yeutter Says Farmers are Losers in Trade Pacts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says
decades of trade negotiations have left farmers out in the cold.
   It's time to change that, he says, but it will take ``a hefty
dose of political courage'' on the part of the United States and
its trading partners.
   ``There's no question in my mind that agriculture is the most
distortive sector of the world economy, when one evaluates existing
trade patterns,'' Yeutter said Tuesday.
   In the case of industrial goods, there has been substantial
progress in trade liberalization under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade. And there has been a move now under GATT to deal
with the international aspects of the financial and service sectors.
   ``Agriculture has been on the agenda for the past 40 years, and
probably nothing has happened,'' Yeutter said. ``We've gone through
40 years of GATT history, through a whole series of multilateral
trade rounds, and for all practical purposes we, the members of
GATT, have accomplished nothing in the way of agricultural trade
liberalization.''
   The current Uruguay Round of GATT talks is scheduled to conclude
at the end of this year.
   Yeutter told a meeting of the Food Executives International
Congress that the Uruguay Round offers ``great potential for
liberalization'' and that the United States has put its own quotas
and trade-distorting policies on the negotiating table.
   But Yeutter, as he has many times, stressed that the United
States will not ``disarm unilaterally'' and that ``if our trading
partners won't march, we're not going to march, either.''
   Yeutter said all sorts of ``schemes'' are used to avoid trade
liberalization and that agricultural commodities are favorite
targets.
   ``If it exists, it's applied to agriculture,'' he said. ``If
there's anything that is distortive, you can bet your bottom dollar
it's used by some country somewhere to impede agricultural trade.''
   These devices, he said, include export subsidies, high internal
price supports, quotas and licensing.
   Yeutter pointedly used Japan's restrictive import policy on rice
as an example. Recently, he said, a U.S. rice industry group
participated in a food show in Japan and included samples of
American rice. But the Japanese government asked that the samples
be withdrawn.
   ``I wonder about anyone's commitment to trade liberalization
when we can't even show a sample of an American food product in
Japan,'' Yeutter said.
   The European Economic Community, for years a favorite target of
U.S. trade officials, also was cited by Yeutter for boosting
internal soybean price supports to more than $18 a bushel. The U.S.
price support was $4.53 for 1989 soybeans.
   ``I told some of them here recently that if you paid me $18 a
bushel for soybeans, I'd grow them on the Alps, and I think maybe
somebody's going to grow them on the Alps if that continues very
much longer,'' he said. ``If you pay farmers enough money, they'll
grow anything anywhere.''

   Colder weather has slowed winter wheat
development in the Great Plains and may have caused some damage in
a few southern areas where top growth was heavier, according to a
government report.
   The Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said Tuesday that a
winter storm brought ``some beneficial moisture'' to the northern
plains during the week of March 19-25.
   Wheat growth in Kansas was reported excellent early in the week
before the cold front moved through.
   ``Oklahoma's winter wheat was good to fair, but freezing
temperatures damaged some fields with moderate top growth,'' the
report said. ``Cold weather slowed growth in most areas of Texas at
the end of the week.''
   The weather facility is operated by the Agriculture and Commerce
departments. Weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not
include production forecasts.
   Looking at other crops, the report said fieldwork progressed
well in the Mississippi Delta as fields dried. Corn planting was
more than one-third complete in Alabama, but earlier flooding may
force some replanting.
   Rice planting continued in Louisiana, and cotton farmers
continued planting in Arizona and Southern California. Tobacco was
reported in good-to-fair condition in Georgia and North Carolina,
and in fair-to-good shape in South Carolina.
   The storm in the northern plains was a hardship for livestock
and newborn calves, despite its moisture benefits for pastures and
crops, the report said. Pastures were said to be in mostly
good-to-fair condition in the Delta and the East.

   Texas has the most stock sheep, but when it
comes to lamb chops, count on Colorado as No. 1.
   Agriculture Department statisticians say the Texas inventory was
about 1.9 million head as of Jan. 1, up 11 percent from a year
earlier.
   But Colorado remained the largest lamb-feeding state with
385,000 head reported, up 1 percent from Jan. 1, 1989. Texas was
second with 200,000 head, an 18 percent increase.
   Overall, the U.S. inventory of sheep and lambs was about 11.4
million head on Jan. 1, up 5 percent from a year earlier.
   ``This increase in sheep and lamb inventory implies a
substantial corresponding rise in lamb and mutton production in
1990,'' the department's Economic Research Service said.
``Production for the year is expected to increase about 4 percent
to 355 million pounds.''
   Meanwhile, the American Sheep Industry Association, based in
Denver, says National Lamb Month will be in September for the
second consecutive year instead of April, as had been traditional.
   ``It is the time of year when lamb is available to consumers at
the best value per pound,'' said the association's Robin Ganse.
``Promotional efforts can give consumers that extra push in
deciding to serve lamb for holiday meals.''

<HEAD>Former Navy Secretary Suggests Shifting Much of Navy to Reserve
Status</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy should respond to the diminishing
Soviet threat by shifting much of its fleet to reserve status,
according to a former Navy secretary.
   John Lehman, a proponent of the 600-ship Navy during his tenure
in the Reagan administration, said the Pentagon no longer needs to
operate as if the nation is in a wartime mode.
   ``Regardless of the size of the Soviet fleet they're not about
to attack tomorrow, or the next day, or the next year,'' Lehman
told the House Armed Services Committee's defense policy panel
Tuesday.
   However, Lehman said the size of the Navy is not affected by the
rapid push toward democracy in Eastern Europe.
   Determining the number of ships in the fleet are the five
oceanic regions where the United States has vital concerns and the
continued modernization of the Soviet fleet, including production
of submarines.
   The former secretary said the Navy should alter its approach,
shifting ships and aircraft to the reserves, with half active
forces and half reserves manning the ships and squadrons.
   He suggested shifting half the 20,000 sailors associated with
ships near Europe to reserve status, but did not provide additional
specifics.
   Pressed by lawmakers about the future U.S. naval fleet if it
shrinks to 400 ships, Lehman said the Pentagon should keep at least
14 carriers and four battleships.
   In the fiscal 1991 defense budget, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
has proposed mothballing two of the four U.S. battleships _ the USS
Iowa and the USS New Jersey.
   Retired Air Force Gen. Russell E. Dougherty, former commander of
the Strategic Air Command, agreed with Lehman that the likelihood
of confrontation was slim.
   ``The tinderbox character ... in Europe is changed, maybe even
gone and the changed political situation in the Warsaw Pact and
Eastern European has dramatically changed the confrontation,''
Dougherty told the committee.
   But both Lehman and Dougherty stressed the need for development
of the B-2 stealth bomber. Its cost of more than $70 billion for
132 planes has drew criticism in Congress.
   ``Keeping the long-range bomber leg makes eminent sense,''
Lehman said.
   But he questioned continued spending on land-based nuclear
missiles to make them survivable in the event of a Soviet attack.
Bush administration plans calls for moving the multiple-warhead, MX
missile from hardened silos to railroad cars and developing the
smaller Midgetman missile.
   ``Throwing more money after the land-based leg of the ICBM is
really on the wrong end of the ledger of business,'' said Lehman,
managing director of Paine Webber Inc. ``The amount of money that
you have to spend to make ICBM survivable in this kind of
environment just doesn't make any sense to me.''
   Questioned further about his position on land-based missiles,
Lehman said he favored keeping the MX missile but that officials
should ``accept the fact it's vulnerable to a first strike.''

<HEAD>Pilot in USAir 5050 Loses License; Transcript Released in Avianca
Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is revoking the flying license
of the pilot who skidded his USAir jetliner into New York's East
River last year.
   Saying Capt. Michael Martin lacked the ``care, skill, judgment
and responsibility'' to fly a commercial airliner, the Federal
Aviation Administration announced the revocation Tuesday and gave
Martin 20 days to appeal to the National Transportation Safety
Board.
   In another New York crash, the NTSB on Tuesday released a
cockpit voice recorder transcript that showed the copilot of
Avianca Flight 52 told the pilot he had radioed a fuel emergency,
but he used less precise language with ground controllers.
   The Avianca jet, which apparently ran out of fuel, crashed Jan.
25 at Cove Neck, Long Island, killing 73 of the 159 people aboard,
including all three cockpit crew members.
   In the USAir case, Air Line Pilots Association spokesman John
Mazor said his group considers the action against Martin ``totally
unwarranted and it will be appealed.''
   Two people died in the Sept. 20 aborted takeoff, and 61 others
were rescued from the airliner, which broke into pieces at the end
of a LaGuardia airport runway.
   The FAA cited Martin's failure to fully complete a pre-takeoff
checklist and perform other required actions on the taxiway.
   The agency earlier ordered alteration of cockpit controls in all
Boeing 737 airliners as a result of the crash. The pilots' union
said the faulty design of controls led to the aborted takeoff, and
the NTSB has been looking into that as one of several possible
causes for the crash.
   The revocation order, dated March 19 but announced Tuesday,
faulted the pilot for failing to check a rudder control or monitor
engine thrust, which it said caused the airliner to drift to the
left.
   An FAA news release did not mention either Martin or copilot
Constantine Kleissas by name and said nothing about the copilot's
status.
   The FAA earlier suspended the licenses of both Martin and
Kleissas, who was at the controls of a commercial Boeing 737
takeoff for the first time.
   The Avianca cockpit transcript said the Colombian pilot said,
``Tell them we are in emergency'' in Spanish just after the plane
failed its first landing attempt and 10 minutes before it crashed.
   ``We're running out of fuel,'' the copilot told controllers in
English at 9:24 p.m., after the crew of the Boeing 707 was
instructed to abort the attempted landing at John F. Kennedy
airport and loop around for another try.
   A few seconds later, the pilot again asked the copilot to tell
the controller there was an emergency. ``Digale que estamos en
emergencia,'' the pilot said, also asking whether his order had
been carried out.
   ``Si, Senor, ya le dije,'' said the copilot _ ``Yes, sir, I
already advised him,'' according to the transcript and translation
released by the NTSB.
   None of the cockpit crew members was identified by name in the
transcript. The flight had come from Bogota and Medellin.
   A source close to the investigation told The Associated Press in
New York on Monday that the transcript appeared to show a pilot who
did not seem to be in full charge of the flight and who did not
give specific direction to the copilot to declare an emergency.
   The 68-page transcript of the flight's final 40 minutes,
however, contained two instances in which the pilot used the
critical word ``emergency'' _ ``emergencia'' in Spanish _ in
communicating with his copilot.
   After the crash, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered all
airlines flying to U.S. airports to ensure that their crews use
specifically worded language in communicating emergencies to
controllers. If a ``fuel emergency'' had been declared, the plane
would have been given a higher priority in landing, officials said.

   Top Pentagon officials are trying to persuade
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney that the military still needs some of
its most expensive aircraft programs, including the B-2 stealth
bomber, despite revolutionary changes in the Soviet bloc.
   Defense sources said Cheney planned today to begin viewing a
slide presentation of the results of a program review that the
secretary had requested in December to help him formulate long-term
budget plans.
   The review looked into the expensive B-2 program, the C-17 cargo
plane and two fighter aircraft still under development, the Air
Force's Advanced Tactical Fighter and the Navy's A-12. Overall, the
programs account for some $200 billion in projected Pentagon
spending.
   Cheney is preparing the Pentagon's five-year defense plan in the
face of severe pressure on Capitol Hill for military spending cuts
to cut the budget deficit and respond to the political change that
has swept Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   But so far, Cheney has advised against severe cutbacks in the
U.S. arsenal. He contends that despite some reforms, the Soviet
Union retains enormous military might that could pose a threat to
this country.
   While the review had initially been touted as one could entail
calls for canceling some of the programs, no such stark
recommendation is made, Pentagon sources said Tuesday.
   Although the review reaffirms the military requirements for the
new aircraft, it also lays out various options for trimming the
numbers of planes or drawing production schedules out in light of
tight budgets, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   A particular target for cuts is the radar-evading B-2 bomber,
said one Pentagon source familiar with the outlines of the review.
   ``The B-2 numbers are in trouble,'' the source said. The Air
Force has requested some 132 Stealth bombers, costing more than
$500 million each.
   The bomber program has been the focus of fierce opposition on
Capitol Hill, where some lawmakers are pressing for the program's
termination.
   The three other programs receive more favorable treatment in the
review, the source said, and ``the A-12 and the C-17 are considered
to be in pretty good shape.''
   The review provides Cheney with ranges of options to choose
from, the source said. ``It's more of a philosophical
presentation,'' he said.
   Pentagon spokesman Bob Hall said Cheney is ``going to advise
Congress of any decisions that stem from this review. ... Any
important recommendations he will want to make, any conclusions he
will draw from it, I'm sure he'll discuss with the president.''
   Congress will get the results ``in the near future ... weeks, I
think,'' Hall added.
   Last week, John Betti, the undersecretary of defense for
acquisition, said the studies had involved dozens of Pentagon
officials, and that they planned to present Cheney with ``a menu of
options.''
   Betti, who helped organize the review, said it had involved
``going back to ground zero'' on the need for the aircraft during a
period of ``strained resources.''
   Cheney ``will have to decide what will be done. He'll have to
establish priorities and the way he intends to sell them to the
president and the Congress,'' Betti said.

<HEAD>Activists Try To Change Minds About Capital Punishment</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN QUENTIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opponents of capital punishment are
trying to overcome the large majority opinion in favor of it as the
state's first execution in 23 years approaches.
   At 3 a.m. on April 3, unless last-ditch appeals succeed,
37-year-old Robert Alton Harris will be strapped into San Quentin's
49-square-foot apple-green gas chamber, and an invisible cloud of
cyanide gas will end his life.
   ``Should we as a society use the same language as the murderer _
the language of death _ and create new victims? Society must rise
above the level of the murderer,'' said Jim Young, who has been on
a protest vigil outside the prison for three weeks.
   Young, a member of Death Penalty Focus, sat on Monday by a black
cardboard coffin and signs reading ``Don't Kill For Me'' and ``The
Death Penalty Is Dead Wrong.'' Two other people, one the wife of
another death row inmate, stood nearby.
   Also on hand were a man and a woman carrying signs applauding
the scheduled execution and urging people to remember his victims.
   Harris was found guilty and sentenced to die for the July 5,
1978, murders of San Diego 16-year-olds John Mayeski and Michael
Baker after abducting them to use their car in a bank robbery.
   ``We know we're up against a hard rock of public opinion,''
Young said, referring to some statewide public opinion surveys
showing 80 percent of Californians in favor of capital punishment.
   ``But (people) say they're for the death penalty because it's
been sold to them,'' said Young. ``That's why we're out here at the
gate _ to give out information.''
   Members of other groups opposed to capital punishment and
fearful that Harris' death will lead to further executions also
have been fasting, speaking out, or writing to Gov. George
Deukmejian to ask for clemency.
   Although opponents argue capital punishment is immoral and fails
to deter crime, the head of a Sacramento-based national victims'
rights group sees things differently.
   ``We believe that ultimately the death penalty simply
incapacitates murderers more effectively than any other form of
punishment contemplated or legal in the United States,'' said
Michael Rushford, president of the Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation. ``Harris will never kill again.''
   Death penalty foes argue California has no need for the death
penalty to prevent murderers from being released to kill again.
   ``We can effectively deal with the problem with the current law
_ life without possibility of parole,'' said Stephen Souza, the
regional membership coordinator of Amnesty International.
   Still, proponents are skeptical that such a punishment can be
counted on with any certainty.
   ``They don't have any idea what that is about,'' said Steve
Baker, the father of one of Harris' young victims and a San Diego
police detective. Baker will witness Harris' execution.
   The American Civil Liberties Union argues that the death penalty
is inherently a form of cruel and unusual punishment, and therefore
unconstitutional.
   ``Errors cannot be corrected after someone is dead. Once they're
dead, there's no appeal,'' said Martha Kegel, the ACLU's associate
director in northern California.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill to Ban Food-Garbage Hauls by Truckers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Truckers would be banned from hauling loads of
food and garbage back to back, under legislation the House passed
overwhelmingly over Bush administration opposition.
   The bill, approved 410-15 on Tuesday, directs the Department of
Transportation to issue regulations banning refrigerated trucks,
tank trucks and rail cars from alternating loads of food with
shipments of ``unacceptable non-food products'' such as solid waste
or chemicals.
   ``Backhauling is dangerous, disgusting and legal,'' Rep. William
Clinger, R-Pa., one of the measure's prime sponsors, said before
the vote. ``We have not eliminated this practice by publicity,
which makes it terribly important that we pass this bill.''
   The administration opposed the ban largely because of a
provision that the Transportation Department assume enforcement
responsibility.
   Alan I. Roberts, a hazardous materials specialist with the
department, told a Senate panel three weeks ago that existing law
``is adequate to regulate the handling and transportation of food.''
   If a bill were approved, he said, lead responsibility would more
properly rest with the agencies with food safety expertise _ the
Agriculture Department and the Food and Drug Administration.
   ``The administration has yet to see fit to correct these
practices,'' Rep. Tom Luken, D-Ohio, said during debate on the
bill. ``Evidently the Department of Transportation thinks it is the
problem of the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA thinks its a
transportation problem. And the EPA, which has jurisdiction over
solid waste, doesn't know what to think.
   ``The bottom line is that Congress is going to have to direct
these agencies to work together to stop these life-threatening
practices,'' Luken said.
   The legislation would also require that asbestos, infectious
waste and other health-threatening items be shipped only in
vehicles designated for that purpose.
   The bill now moves to the Senate, where several similar bills
are pending.
   The practice is known as backhauling because it often occurs
after trucks haul food loads to the East. Rather than return to the
Midwest empty, they carry garbage. A trucker testified last August
that he liked hauling garbage because it could not be harmed en
route.
   Concern about food-garbage hauls arose after the Centre Daily
Times of State College, Pa., reported a year ago that refrigerated
food-hauling trucks were being loaded with municipal solid waste.
   The report led Congress to investigate a related practice last
year: alternating hauls of chemicals with shipments of juice or
edible oils. An Oregon trucker's shipment log released by a House
panel included loads of cooking oil, wine, apple juice, fire
retardant, marine lubricant and lime sulphur.
   Several trucking groups have said that concern by food companies
has pressured truckers into avoiding the practice. The government
says it has yet to uncover any instances of contamination due to
backhauling.
   But Clinger and Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., said that checks by
their staffs have confirmed that backhauling is continuing.
   Voting against the bill were Reps. Bill Archer, R-Texas; Dick
Armey, R-Texas; Dan Burton, R-Ind.; Larry Combest, R-Texas; Philip
Crane, R-Ill.; William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif.; Tom DeLay, R-Texas;
Robert Dornan, R-Calif.; Jack Fields, R-Texas; Bill Frenzel,
R-Minn.; James Hansen, R-Utah; Edward Madigan, R-Ill.; Ron
Marlenee, R-Mont.; Howard Nielson, R-Utah, and Norman Shumway,
R-Calif.
   Not voting were Reps. Doug Barnard, D-Ga.; Jim Bates, D-Calif.;
Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla.; Harold E. Ford, D-Tenn.; Jim Leach,
R-Iowa; Denny Smith, R-Ore., and Bob Stump, R-Ariz.

<HEAD>Watkins Gives up Responsibility for Nuclear Worker Health Studies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department is giving up
responsibility for studying long-term health risks for workers at
nuclear weapons plants, but Secretary James D. Watkins says he'll
increase daily monitoring of the employees.
   Watkins announced Tuesday he has begun negotiations for the
Department of Health and Human Services to take over the long-term
health studies, which seek to answer such questions as whether
exposure to low-level radiation causes increased cancer risks.
   The move reflected growing complaints from Congress, labor
unions and communities near weapons plants that the Energy
Department, which owns the facilities, cannot be trusted to perform
objective studies of possible health hazards.
   Last month, the author of a federal study that found a unusually
high rate of cancers among workers at the Rocky Flats nuclear
weapons plant in Colorado charged that Energy Department officials
had pressured him to water down his findings in 1986 and 1987.
   The allegation by Gregg Wilkinson, a former epidemiologist at
the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, which designs
nuclear weapons, is under investigation by the Energy Department's
inspector general.
   Watkins' decision was prompted by a panel of health physics
experts, which said in a report released Tuesday that the
department should monitor workers' health but should cede
responsibility to another federal agency for studying long-term
health issues.
   The panel, headed by Kristine Gebbie, the secretary of health
for the state of Washington, said the public does not trust the
Energy Department to do its own studies.
   ``Because the department's role is to promote energy production,
there is an inherent potential conflict between immediate
production goals and health and safety goals,'' the report said.
   ``To restore public trust, to assure the highest scientific
quality, and to assure the independence of investigators, the
department needs an independent system,'' it added.
   The panel also recommended that the Energy Department spend more
time studying health risks from worker exposure to non-nuclear
hazards at the weapons plants, such as toxic chemicals and
beryllium, which are used in weapons manufacturing.
   A recent study said 12 people who were exposed to beryllium
while working at Rocky Flats have contracted an incurable lung
disease. They were among 750 employees at the plant who have
handled beryllium, a metal used in making plutonium triggers.
   Ms. Gebbie said her panel saw indications that beryllium
exposure could be a problem at other weapons plants. It recommended
immediate action to study the problem.
   Watkins said he talked Tuesday with HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan
about switching the long-range epidemiological work to his
department.
   ``He's ready to go,'' Watkins said, adding that he hoped the
Energy Department could conclude a ``memorandum of understanding''
with Sullivan's department within one month on terms of the
transfer.
   Watkins initially resisted efforts in Congress to take away his
control over the health studies. But in his public meeting with Ms.
Gebbie's panel, he said, ``Research of this nature is better suited
for an agency that regularly addresses such issues.''
   Watkins stressed that his department would retain responsibility
for protecting plant workers' health and for minimizing exposure to
hazardous materials. He said he already had taken steps to improve
day-to-day health monitoring.
   The secretary also announced that President Bush was nominating
a health physics expert to fill the vacant position of assistant
energy secretary for environment, safety and health, which holds
responsibility for nuclear worker health issues.
   The nominee, Harry Pettengill, said in a brief interview Tuesday
that he has worked in the department's office of environment,
safety and health for 1{ years.

<HEAD>2 Groups Favoring Abortion Split Over Proposed Idaho Boycott</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB FICK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of the leading abortion rights groups
are split over whether an economic boycott against Idaho will
effectively persuade the governor to veto the country's most
restrictive state abortion law.
   Kate Michelman, president of the National Abortion Rights Action
League, said Tuesday the threat of a boycott on Idaho potatoes and
other products could be counterproductive in the campaign to block
Gov. Cecil Andrus' signature on the bill.
   ``I understand the frustration that has led to the idea,''
Michelman said. ``But I think that threats like that aren't always
the best method. ... It's just something that complicates things.''
   Andrus, a Democrat who opposes abortion under most
circumstances, was deliberating on the bill, which prohibits
abortion as a means of birth control. The bill won final
legislative approval last Thursday.
   Hundreds of telephone calls, letters and messages from both
camps flooded the Democratic chief executive's office Tuesday.
Andrus wants to consult outside experts before making his final
decision.
   On Tuesday, Molly Yard, president of the National Organization
for Women, said if the bill becomes law she would recommend a
nationwide boycott of all Idaho goods at the organization's
national conference in June.
   It would be similar to the boycott NOW conducted against states
refusing to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment in the 1970s.
   Groups and individuals in states throughout the nation have made
similar threats, prompting state Commerce Director James Hawkins to
say: ``We're becoming concerned.''
   But anti-abortion activists, led by the National Right to Life
Committee, have countered with pledges to increase their purchases
of Idaho products.
   The legislation bans abortion except in cases of non-statutory
rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim is younger
than 18, severe fetal deformity and a threat to the life or
physical health of the mother.
   The governor has until next Monday morning to act unless the
Legislature adjourns before then. If that happens, as is expected,
Andrus has 10 days from the time lawmakers leave.
   If signed, the bill would take effect July 1, but abortion
rights advocates have promised a court test that anti-abortion
forces hope will convince the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn its
1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   Michelman said she's ``not interested in hurting the people of
Idaho. I think most of the people of the state disagree with what
the House and Senate did.''
   The most powerful influence on the governor, Michelman
maintained, will come from his constituents.
   ``I'm not sure an Idaho potato boycott is as effective as real
well-organized political grassroots activity,'' she said. ``I think
the governor will be held accountable by the people of Idaho for
whatever he does and so will the legislators.''

   Rep. Susan Molinari, the newest, youngest
member of Congress, says she'll follow much of the course her
father set in the House before her, but she'll continue to differ
with him on the abortion question: she's pro-choice.
   ``In the interest of family unity we don't discuss it anymore,''
Ms. Molinari, R-N.Y., told reporters after being sworn in Tuesday.
   Her tenure as the least senior member of the House was to end
today with the swearing-in of Jose Serrano, a Bronx Democrat.
   Both Ms. Molinari and Serrano won special elections March 20.
   Ms. Molinari, a two-term New York City councilwoman, defeated
Democrat Robert Gigante, a local attorney and political newcomer.
   Serrano, a state assemblyman, was elected to fill the House seat
vacated when Robert Garcia resigned after being convicted in the
Wedtech influence-peddling scandal. Serrano defeated Simeon Golar,
a Queens Democrat who ran as a Republican.
   Ms. Molinari celebrated her 32nd birthday Tuesday by taking the

Island borough president.

<HEAD>NTSB Calls For More Natural Gas Explosion Protections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Transportation Department says it will
consider a recommendation by federal investigators for utilities to
install a device to help prevent explosions from leaking
residential natural gas pipes.
   The National Transportation Safety Board called Tuesday for
``urgent action'' by DOT to require the devices, known as excess
flow valves.
   The board said recent fatal accidents in Kansas and Missouri
demonstrated the need for the equipment, which automatically
restricts the flow of gas when certain increases occur, possibly
from a leak or rupture in a line.
   Four people were killed and a dozen injured in a series of five
explosions between September 1988 and March 1989 on KPL Gas Service
lines in the two states.
   In a report on the explosions, the board concluded that the
excess flow valves could have prevented or at least reduced the
seriousness of three of the accidents.
   NTSB issued a similar recommendation for the devices in 1981,
but board members said the KPL accidents caused them to renew their
suggestion and assign it the highest priority for regulatory
consideration.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government says it will provide
$90 million for construction of a new airport in Denver.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Tuesday that the
Federal Aviation Administration grant signals the Bush
administration's commitment to expanding aviation capacity
throughout the country.
   In addition, the department has told Congress it will seek $351
million for the new Colorado airport between fiscal 1991 and fiscal
1999. He said this is the largest federal airport commitment of its
kind.
   ``Today we are making good on our promise,'' Skinner said in a
meeting with Denver Mayor Federico Pena and members of Colorado's
congressional delegation. He said the airport project represents a
``giant step'' towards expanded airport capacity in the country.
   FAA Administrator James B. Busey said the government is
convinced ``we will be getting a big return on our investment'' in
the Denver airport.
   He said construction of the airport is expected to reduce flight
delays by 4 percent to 5 percent across the country by 1995.

<HEAD>Transition Agreement Reached, Sandinistas Say They'll Cede Control
of Army</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Sandinistas have agreed to cede
control of the army and police in a preliminary agreement with
advisers to President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro on
transferring power.
   The agreement, reached late Tuesday, stresses that the
demobilization of the Contra rebels is crucial if a civilian
government led by Mrs. Chamorro is to take over from the
Sandinistas on April 25 as scheduled.
   Dismantling of the rebel force that once had strong U.S. backing
``constitutes an essential element for creating the climate of
peace, stability and tranquility in which the transfer of
government should take place,'' the agreement says.
   The heads of the transition teams signed the preliminary
agreement after a month of negotiations. Mrs. Chamorro defeated
President Daniel Ortega in free elections on Feb. 25.
   Control of the security forces is a key issue in the transition
from a decade-old leftist revolutionary government to the
conservative United National Opposition, or UNO.
   Under the agreement, the Sandinista army and police will become
non-partisan organizations under the control of Mrs. Chamorro and
only these institutions should have combat weapons.
   The accord also says that the size of Nicaragua's armed forces,
which Soviet aid built into the largest in Central America, will be
determined by the ``economic capacity and social necessity of the
nation.''
   Mrs. Chamorro campaigned on a promise to end the draft and
drastically cut the size of the military, which consumes half the
national budget in this impoverished country.
   The Sandinistas, openly reluctant to relinquish their armed
forces and police while the Contras remain intact, have been
handing out thousands of weapons since their stunning election loss
and urging people to defend the ``conquests of the revolution.''
   Those ``conquests'' include thousands of houses and farms
confiscated by the Sandinistas. The accord says the new government
will respect the rights of people who were given confiscated
property before election day.
   The transition document was signed by Defense Minister Humberto
Ortega, head of the Sandinista transition team and the president's
brother, and Antonio Lacayo, head of the UNO team and a son-in-law
of Mrs. Chamorro.
   Lacayo said the agreement forsees the demobilization of the
Contras by April 25.
   Gen. Ortega said it was necessary to ``isolate, neutralize and
put in their right place those who aren't on the path of peace and
democracy that is opening in Nicaragua.''
   He said he was confident that the Contras would be dismantled
``once and for all'' whether they want to be or not.
   The Contras and UNO signed an agreement Friday calling for the
rebels in Honduran base camps to disband by April 20. The accord
says fighters in Nicaragua are to move into security zones under
the supervision of the U.N. force and Cardinal Miguel Obando y
Bravo.
   Most of the 12,000-man rebel army is believed to have returned
to Nicaragua in recent months and Contra leaders have been vague on
when the fighters on Nicaraguan soil would disarm.
   Oscar Sovalbarro, the Contra negotiator in the accord with UNO,
said Monday that 2,000 rebel fighters had returned to Nicaragua
since Friday alone. International observers say the Contra camps in
Yamales, Honduras, are like ``ghost towns.''
   The Contras now confront a unified effort to get them
dismantled. Even the United States, their longtime sponsor, says
they must disband.
   A U.N. observer force began patroling Nicaraguan war zones by
helicopter Tuesday and the U.N. Security Council authorized adding
800 troops to the 200-member demobilization force.
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, James Wilkinson, told
the Security Council in New York that it is time for the rebels
``to demobilize freely and return to their land to contribute to
its development.''
   Twelve white helicopters emblazoned with the U.N. symbol landed
at Sandinista army installations Tuesday morning and two hours
later took off to the east.
   Military sources said the aircraft were carrying members of the
observer force to eastern jungle zones, where they would try to
contact Contra chiefs.
   The U.N. forces plan to collect weapons, ammunition, military
equipment and uniforms from the rebels.
   The U.N. plan calls for Contras in Honduran camps to hand over
their weapons and await repatriation or resettlement. U.N.
observers also plan to establish temporary assembly points inside
Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Stocks Tumble, Dollar Still Rising</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index fell sharply
Wednesday, while the dollar rose against the Japanese yen for the
ninth consecutive day despite government efforts to support the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 562.39 points, or 1.77
percent, closing at 31,263.57. The Nikkei fell 14.53 points on
Tuesday.
   The dollar closed at 158.63 yen, up 1.67 yen from Tuesday's
close of 156.96 yen. It opened at 158.30 yen and ranged between
158.15 yen and 158.85 yen. The dollar now has gained 6.43 yen in
nine trading days.
   The dollar last traded at the 158-yen level in January 1987.
   ``The dollar has been so strong, and its rising pace is very
fast,'' said Shinichi Kato, a trader with Mitsui Bank.
   The dollar's advance followed its overnight rise in New York.
   Kato said a large demand for the dollar prior to year-end
account settlements is pushing the U.S. currency higher. Japan's
fiscal year ends on Saturday.
   Importers, many of whom are afraid that the dollar will rise
further, jump at the dollar whenever it moves downward, he said.
   Kato blamed the lack of coordinated market intervention among
central banks for the dollar's swift ascent.
   ``The Bank of Japan alone can no longer control the situation,''
he said. ``The dollar's upward momentum has become too strong now.''
   Japan's central bank was seen intervening in the market by
selling some $300 million. The bank does not officially comment on
its market intervention.
   Because the U.S. Federal Reserve did not sell dollars during the
previous day, Japanese market players began to speculate that the
United States approves of the current dollar-yen rate, he added.
   ``The dollar will soon hit the 160-yen level. It's just a matter
of time,'' Kato said.
   The yen's decline knocked the Nikkei index more than 650 points
lower in early trading, but the Nikkei made up some of its losses
as market players picked up shipbuilding issues whose prices had
fallen earlier, dealers said.
   Japanese Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said after a Cabinet
meeting Wednesday that he is watching current exchange rate levels
with great concern, Kyodo News Service reported.
   It quoted Hashimoto as saying he had received an invitation to
attend the meeting of the Group of Seven finance ministers in Paris
in April, but that he would decide whether to attend the meeting on
the basis of the conditions at the time in the Japanese Parliament.

   The nation's second-largest check printing
company is offering checks with personalized, political messages
for consumers who care about abortion, AIDS and other issues.
   Any of 21 messages offered by the John H. Harland Co. can be
printed on a banner in the middle of the check.
   On abortion, people may opt for ``Pro Choice'' or ``Pro Life.''
Those interested in the environment may proclaim ``Stop Nuclear
Power'' or ``Alternative Energy.'' Other messages include ``Stop
Child Abuse,'' ``Attack AIDS'' and ``Seniors Have Style.''
   ``It's been proven that they will pay for rainbows and puppies
(on checks). It's not that farfetched,'' said Harland spokesman
Bruce Danielson.
   The checks first were offered March 1 and sales have not been
reported, he said.
   Stu Alexander, spokesman for Deluxe Check Printers Inc., the
nation's largest check printing company in St. Paul, Minn., said he
believed consumers will not go for the concept.
   ``Affinity'' checks, which allow people to state their loyalty
to a school or organization, have not been big sellers, he said.
   ``While they seem like a good idea at the time, people tend to
support their organizations (in other ways),'' he said. ``Someone
who is gung ho on that will open their checkbook and write a check
for that organization.''
   Harland also has a new line that supports the Windstar
Foundation, an educational organization for environmental concerns
founded by singer John Denver.
   A marketing analyst said that could be an asset because the
environment is a popular cause.
   ``People are putting their views on bumpers stickers. Why not on
their checks?'' said Charlie Elberson, vice president of
Prce-McNabb, an Asheville, N.C. marketing and communications firm.
   But Elberson advised caution in selecting messages. ``They would
be wise to stay away from some issues, but most of these issues are
pretty safe.''
   The other messages offered by Harland are ``Save Our Earth,''
``World Freedom,'' ``Protect Wildlife,'' ``Adopt A Pet,'' ``Shelter
The Homeless,'' ``Share A Hug,'' ``Farmers Feed America,'' ``Just
Say No,'' ``A Proud Vet,'' ``Stop Crime,'' ``Black Pride,''
``Shalom,'' ``Orgulloso de ser Latino (Proud to be Hispanic),'' and
``Scientia est potestas (Knowledge is Power).''

<HEAD>Texas Grower Defends Use of Banned Pesticide</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the state's largest vegetable
growers told a regulatory board he was opposed to banning the
pesticide chlordane, saying: ``sure it's going to kill a lot of
people, but they may be dying of something else anyway.''
   McAllen Mayor Othal Brand made the statement Tuesday during at
his first appearance at the Agriculture Resources Protection
Authority meeting, to which he was appointed by Gov. Bill Clements.
   Brand, who is also a grower, later denied making the statement,
which was tape-recorded by a Fort Worth Star-Telegram reporter and
a state employee.
   The board was discussing whether to close a loophole in state
regulations that allows the use of chlordane by homeowners who own
some of the banned pesticide.
   The pesticide is effective in fighting termites.
   In the tape, Brand said: ``I'm 70 years old and in great shape,
and I mean, sure it's going to kill a lot of people but they may be
dying of something else anyway.''
   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower called Brand's
statement outrageous.
   Elvin Caraway III, a Fort Worth attorney also appointed to the
board, said Brand's comment was just an ``old country expression.''
   ``The gist of his comment is there are many things that cause
illness and that ... some of the concern about pesticide generally
is a little over-exaggerated,'' Caraway said.
   ``I'm not saying I agree with that or disagree with it.''

<HEAD>Tranquilizer Snaps Man Out of Vegetative State After 8 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL C. BUELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MADISON, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight years after an auto accident left him
in a vegetative state, a man given a tranquilizer in a dentist's
office fell asleep, woke up and started to speak. Soon he could say
his name, walk and feed himself, a doctor says.
   Dr. Andres Kanner, a neurologist with the University of
Wisconsin Hospital, said Tuesday it's a mystery why tranquilizers
awakened the man.
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Kanner said. ``It was just luck he
had to have some dental work and it was just luck they administered
the drugs.''
   The patient, identified only as a Wisconsin man in his mid-40s,
had been in a vegetative state, not a coma: His eyes were open and
he occasionally uttered words, but he could do nothing else, the
doctor said in an interview Tuesday.
   ``His interaction with the environment was very limited. He
rarely spoke one or two words,'' Kanner said.
   The patient had been given Valium March 12 as a painkiller for
routine dental work, Kanner said. After the tranquilizer was
administered, the man fell asleep about five minutes, said Kanner,
who was not present at the time.
   ``Then he woke up and started talking. He was able to answer
questions, say his name, to feed himself and walk,'' Kanner said he
was told.
   Hours later, the man lapsed back into the vegetative state. He
was given a second dose that brought him out of it for about 90
minutes. At that point he was able to recall parts of his life.
   ``I have to tell you he was a different man. He knew his name,
the name of his family, where he used to work. He could add,
subtract and perform complicated calculations,'' said Kanner, who
witnessed the second reaction.
   Since then, the man, who remains hospitalized, has received
different, longer-lasting forms of benzodiazepines, a family of
drugs that includes Valium, and barbiturates that allowed him to
remain lucid 10 to 12 hours at a time, Kanner said. The drugs are
administered intravenously.
   Doctors can't tell why the drugs helped the man or what
combination of drugs they can give him to take orally outside the
hospital, he said.
   One theory is that benzodiazepines, which inhibit certain
functions of the nervous system, are blocking the effects of the
vegetative state, Kanner said. But doctors for now are viewing the
man's case as an isolated one, he said.
   Kanner said the man suffers no medical problems other than his
mysterious vegetative state. It developed about two years after he
came out of a four-month coma brought on by a car accident 10 years
ago.
   The neurologist said that, as with most such patients, little
was known about how to treat the man's condition and there was
little hope for recovery before March 12.

   Gov. George Sinner is auctioning off the
state automobile, a snazzy dark blue 1988 Lincoln Town Car loaded
with accesories, to do his part in cutting $550,000 from state
travel expenses.
   The car, purchased last July for $19,800, is conspicuous on the
streets of Bismarck because of its size, long rear telephone
antenna and license plates bearing the number ``1.''
   ``You stuck out like a sore thumb, and I'm no better driver than
anybody else ... I sometimes make little errors. You feel unduly
conspicuous,'' the Democratic governor said. ``I frankly didn't
like driving it.''
   In car salesman's parlance, the four-door sedan is loaded.
   The dash has a computer that figures the car's fuel mileage,
average speed, and can estimate the time a trip will be finished.
Windows and seats are electrically adjustable.
   ``It's got all this stuff on it,'' Sinner said. ``I never did
figure out how to use it.''
   The car is one of 75 state cars being auctioned today.

   The only clue for workers answering
hundreds of calls in Spanish at Columbia Auto Parts was the word
``census.'' The callers were trying to reach a special toll-free
number for questions about the 1990 Census. ``Friday, it was
amusing,'' said Bill Carter, who runs the business. ``Saturday, it
was funny. It's not even humorous today.''
   On Monday, the Census Bureau sent a Spanish-speaking employee to
the shop to take down telephone numbers and tell callers that
someone would get back to them. The employee took more than 100
calls dialed to 800-283-6826, Carter said.
   Joe McNamara of MCI Telecommunications Corp., the long-distance
carrier for the Census, theorized that callers held one button down
too long, repeating the 8 in 283. Columbia Auto Parts' toll-free
number is 800-288-3862.
   McNamara said MCI checked the lines and found no problems, but
Carter decided to change his number.
   ``I wanted to be able to talk to my receptionist,'' Carter said.
``I hope the number is ringing somewhere in never-never land. The
new number is as far away from the old one as I could get it.''
   In Tennessee, a medical supply company was experiencing the same
problem with its number, 800-228-3862.
   By late Tuesday, TriCity Medical Equipment in Johnson City,
Tenn. had recorded 245 calls in Spanish that day alone, said
manager Kathy Meade.
   Meade said she doesn't want someone from the Census Bureau in
her office. She said the bureau told her to expect the deluge of
calls to continue for another three weeks.

   Maoist guerrillas trying to thwart national
elections with a bombing and assassination campaign called a strike
for today after briefly taking over three radio stations in Lima to
spread their message.
   Over the past week, the Shining Path rebels have assassinated
four congressional candidates and exploded a car bomb in front of
the Finance Ministry, killing two people and badly wounding 12.
   On Tuesday, at least four people were injured in a car bomb
attack at the site of a planned campaign rally in the Andean city
of Huancayo, police said.
   Earlier in the day, they seized the three radio stations,
forcing workers to broadcast taped messages urging people not to
vote in the April 8 elections and to observe an ``armed strike''
today, police said.
   An ``armed strike'' means a general strike in rebel terminology
and carries the threat of violence against people who don't obey.
   Police said rebels distributed strike leaflets and stopped buses
on Lima's outskirts Tuesday and daubed them with strike slogans.
Angry drivers drove their buses to City Hall to protest lack of
protection.
   In Huancayo, about 120 miles east of the capital, when Shining
Path guerrillas detonated a car bomb on the main square, where
leftist presidential candidate Alfonso Barrantes was scheduled to
hold a rally, police reported.
   Barrantes had switched the rally time to later in the afternoon
after police warned that the rebels may have learned his itinerary.
Police said four people were injured.
   The Shining Path also set off a car bomb in front of a hotel
Monday night in downtown Huancayo, injuring one man and damaging
the building.
   On Monday night, rebels bombed a bank and a telephone company
office in Lima, and police deactivated two bombs at movie houses in
suburbs, police said.
   Police detained more than 3,000 people in a roundup in Lima
Monday night and Tuesday morning. Most were stopped for not
carrying documents and were released after a few hours, police said.
   The government declared Lima under a 30-day state of emergency
Friday, suspending some civil rights and giving police extra powers
to curb rebel activities. A third of Peru is under emergency
status, affecting half of the country's population of 22 million.
   Police said rebels tossed bombs Monday night at four Lima
campaign offices of the Democratic Front, the center-right
coalition of presidential candidate Mario Vargas Llosa.
   Vargas Llosa said Tuesday he had information that members of
President Alan Garcia's governing center-left Aprista party were
involved, but gave no details. He said neither terrorists nor
``irresponsible and violent elements of the Aprista party'' would
intimidate his followers.
   Peruvians on April 8 will vote for president and both houses of
congress. Vargas Llosa leads in the polls, but must get 50 percent
of the vote to avoid a runoff.
   The Shining Path has been fighting to overthrow Peru's elected
governments since 1980. A senate commission reported recently that
642 people died this year in political violence, and that more than
18,000 have died in the last 10 years.

   A low-calorie diet can delay cancer
development and cut cancer risk in mice, a researcher reports.
   Scientists found that the more calories were restricted, while
avoiding malnutrition, the more lifespan was extended and the
longer cancer was delayed, said Richard Weindruch.
   ``I expect the same might apply to the human situation,'' he
said Tuesday at a science writers seminar sponsored by the American
Cancer Society.
   Scientists have long known that mice and rats live longer under
a long-term low-calorie diet. Previous work has also shown
reductions in cancer rates and delays in the appearance of the
disease.
   Caloric restriction has also been shown effective in spiders,
silkworms, guppies, trout and other animals, so ``this is not
simply a rodent phenomenon,'' said Weindruch of the National
Institute on Aging.
   In one experiment he described, 57 female mice ate a diet of 85
calories a week from age three weeks, while 60 others were put on a
40-calorie diet.
   Mice eating the low-calorie diet showed a 35 percent longer
average lifetime and less than half the risk of tumors. The cancers
they did get appeared at later ages.
   A separate experiment found that mice who began a low-calorie
diet in mid-adulthood, an age of about a year, showed a 10 percent
to 20 percent gain in maximum and average lifespan, Weindruch said.
   Gerald Murphy, chief medical officer of the cancer society, said
he believed that humans can help lower their cancer risk by
reducing calories along with moderate reductions in fat.
   But too little is known to say whether they will live longer, he
said.

   Three radical students convicted of
attacking the residence of U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg with
homemade bombs were sentenced today to two years in prison.
   Another three student defendants were given suspended sentences
by the Seoul Criminal Court.
   The six students, armed with homemade bombs, tear gas grenades
and clubs attacked Gregg's residence on Oct. 13 to demand an end to
alleged U.S. influence on the South Korean government and the
withdrawal of U.S. troops.
   The attackers bolted past security guards and entered the
residence, breaking lamps and artwork before they surrendered.
Gregg and his wife, Meg, were unharmed in the attack.
   South Korea's radical students have staged violent anti-U.S.
protests in recent years, attacking U.S. government and military
facilities. American flags have been burned frequently during
campus protests.
   Gregg, a former CIA station chief in Seoul, has been the target
of several protests since he was appointed ambassador last year.

   A hospital today discharged actor and
comedian Richard Pryor, who it had treated for a mild heart heart
attack, doctors said.
   They said he would be returning to his home in Los Angeles.
   Pryor, 49, was readmitted to the Wesley Hospital on Monday after
being discharged a day earlier. He suffered a heart attack while on
a fishing vacation in northeastern Australia last week.
   American heart specialist John Perry flew from Los Angeles
earlier this week to treat him. Dr. Perry said he recommended a
discharge after Pryor passed cardiac tests.
   Pryor was first admitted a week ago for tests after experiencing
chest pains while staying at the Sanctuary Cove resort on
Australia's Gold Coast.
   Pryor is best-known for several movies based on his stand-up
comedy performances and the comedies ``Silver Streak,'' ``See No
Evil, Hear No Evil,'' ``Critical Condition'' and ``Harlem Nights.''
   In 1980, he was burned severely and nearly died while
free-basing cocaine, which involves heating the drug over an open
flame.
   He recounted that experience and other hardships in his life in
the films ``Richard Pryor Live on the Sunset Strip'' and ``Jo Jo
Dancer, Your Life is Calling.''
   Pryor is due to start filming ``My Silent Partner'' with Gene
Wilder in May.

   Poor people migrating in search of food or

   ``The process of development in itself can provoke outbreaks of
tropical disease,'' says a new World Health Organization report on
diseases in tropical regions.
   ``When people move to seek work, land and food or to flee wars
or natural disasters, they can become exposed to tropical diseases
to which they have no resistance, and epidemics break out,''
declared the report issued this week.
   A major example is Brazil, where ``the attempt to develop the
Amazon is creating new breeding sites for malaria-carrying
mosquitos,'' it said. ``As a result, poor workers, farmers,
gold-seekers and miners in Brazil are suffering a devastating
increase in malaria as they migrate to the jungle in search of land
and work.''
   Dr. Jose Najera, Spanish-born director of WHO's tropical disease
control program, told a reporter Tuesday more than half of the
malaria cases in the Americas are now in Brazil's Amazon region.
   He said major increases also have also been recorded in
Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Indochina, the scene of civil
wars, ethnic conflicts and refugee concentrations, as well as parts
of Africa.
   In contrast, India and China have achieved some successes
against malaria, he said. Thailand, which has developed an
anti-mosquito net costing about $2 and improved diagnostic and
treatment facilities, reduced annual malaria deaths from 4,000 to
1,000 in the past decade.
   ``Tropical diseases were once considered diseases of the rural
poor,'' Najera said. ``They still are, but now they are also
closely associated with people's need to earn income, for example,
with the recent massive migration from rural to urban areas, and
with new irrigation and mining projects.''
   This has prompted WHO workers to describe sicknesses such as
malaria ``diseases of the new frontier of development ... which rob
people of their hope of overcoming poverty,'' Najera said.
   Although malaria has been eradicated from areas inhabited by 1.5
billion people since the 1950s, it remains the most serious
tropical disease because of its widespread distribution, and the
emergence of mosquitoes resistant to insecticides and of malaria
parasites to antimalarial drugs, the WHO said.
   At a given time an estimated 270 million people are carrying the
malaria parasite, and about 110 million active cases appear a year,
with symptoms of fever, shaking, chills and drenching sweat, Najera
said. The annual death toll is 1-2 million, mainly young children
in tropical Africa.
   For the first time in history the number of leprosy cases is
declining, the report said, with 2.6 million patients undergoing or
having completed treatment. In contrast to older treatments lasting
a lifetime, the disease can be cured in six months to two years
through use of three drugs, said Norwegian Tore Godal, director of
the joint Tropical Diseases Research and Training Program of WHO,
the World Bank and the U.N. Development Program.
   Other developments:
   River blindness, or onchocerciasis, has declined in West Africa
through control of the blackflies that carry the parasite, and
effectiveness of a new drug.
   In Uganda, simple fly traps, costing about $6 each, are curbing
the population of tsetse flies, carrier of sleeping sickness, or
African Trypanosomiasis. Control of the insect carrier is also
reducing Chagas disease in Brazil.
   A drug called praziquantel has helped reduce some of the most
serious effects of schistosomiasis disease, found in much of the
southern hemisphere, such as massive swelling of liver and spleen
and kidney damage.

   White racists who use heavy metal music to
lure youths into the foul fold. Gangs for every ethnic group _
including Samoans. These were among the perils being discussed at a
conference on juvenile delinquency.
   Some of the issues raised at the 17th National Conference on
Juvenile Justice, which closes today, give the impression that
America is not a great place to raise your kids.
   ``Gangs are coming to a community near you,'' Ronald Stephens,
director of the National School Safety Center in Encino, Calif.,
told the conference on Tuesday. His center is a project of the U.S.
Justice Department and Pepperdine University.
   The number of gangs are growing, Stephens said, with total
membership exceeding 100,000 in the nation's three largest cities:
Los Angeles has 800 gangs, Chicago 120 and New York 50. The average
age of a gang member is 23.
   There's a gang for everyone: both sexes, many ages and every
ethnic group, including Samoans, Stephens said. The members are
violent, enterprising and often free of remorse, he said.
   ``Kids are coming into gangs at an earlier age and staying in a
longer time,'' he said. ``Female activities are growing. Many are
mules, carrying drugs or weapons.''
   At the ``Gangs in School: Breaking Up is Hard to Do'' seminar, a
Los Angeles Police Department videotape showed five teen-age girls
as they fussed with their hair, put on eye makeup and giggled in
front of a bedroom mirror.
   Then they traveled to a grassy field _ where the girls began
pummeling one of their gangster sisters in an initiation ceremony.
   A New Jersey prosecutor said that skinheads, white supremacists
and neo-Nazis are recruiting young members at rock concerts by
groups like The Klansmen, Skrewdriver, The New Storm Troopers and
Indecent Exposure.
   The Klansmen have an album entitled ``Fetch the Rope.''
   ``There is a huge group of children out there learning their
messages from heavy metal musicians, not from teachers, not from
parents,'' said prosecutor Alan A. Rockoff of Middlesex County, N.J.
   Bias crimes in New Jersey have been affected by such communal
hate groups, he said.
   ``The perpetrators of hate crimes do not just attack a human
being. They attack the fabric of society,'' he said.
   ``Unfortunately these kids are looking for a sense of belonging
... and the only place they may find it is in gangs or hate
groups,'' said Ernestine Gray, a juvenile court judge in Orleans
Parish, La. She said the U.S. Justice Department has documented
5,000 hate crimes directed at minorities in the past decade.
   Rockoff said as New Jersey investigators explore the range of
hate crimes, the common denominator is music that riles the worst
instincts.
   ``In incident after incident, we find the evolution of the
pollution. It is the lyrics that are designed to shock and create a
triviality out of death, destruction,'' he said.
   Alienated teen-agers attracted to the dark symbolism of heavy
metal music are sucked into a culture of intolerance, satanic
images and anger, he said. Some become ripe for indoctrination by
groups preaching Aryan supremacy that produce a raunchy form of
music called boot boy, Rockoff said.
   Rockoff does not advocate censorship.
   ``We advocate protest, boycotting by aware parents and
professionals. Why allow these people to make a buck polluting the
minds of our children?'' Rockoff said. ``And secondly, exposure.
Through exposure you create stigmatization.''

<HEAD>Palestinian Camp Officer Axed to Death</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Masked Palestinians armed with axes and knives
killed a 32-year-old Arab U.N. worker and wounded six of his
relatives in a West Bank refugee camp, the army and Arab reports
said today.
   Arab reports said the slain man, identified as Yasser Kazmous,
had been accused of collaboration with Israel in slogans painted on
walls in the Nur Shams refugee camp, where he lived.
   They said more than 50 masked men participated in the raid and
that they used a blowtorch to break into the family home Tuesday
night.
   It was one of the bloodiest attacks involving a suspected
collaborator in the 27-month-old Palestinian uprising against
Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The army confirmed the death and said police were investigating.
   The victim's 70-year-old father and a brother were reported in
critical condition and four other family members were also
hospitalized with stabbing and beating wounds, Arab hospital
officials said.
   Kazmous was the 200th Palestinian killed by fellow Arabs since
the uprising against Israeli occupation began in December 1987.
Most were suspected of collaboration with Israel or of dealing in
drugs or prostitution.
   A total of 669 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis in the
27-month-old conflict, and 43 Israelis have died.
   Officials at the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, which oversees
refugee aid programs, said Kazmous was the agency's service officer
in the Nur Shams camp and was responsible for supervising camp
activities and processing applications for U.N. aid.
   The army spokesman's office said a curfew had been clamped on
the camp this morning. Nur Shams, near the West Bank town of
Tulkarem, is home to about 5,000 Palestinians.
   The U.N. officials, who asked not to be identified by name, said
the attack on the Kazmous family was the second incident involving
a U.N. worker.
   Last fall, a U.N. teacher accused of collaborating escaped from
an armed Palestinian gang in a refugee camp near Jericho by
throwing a grenade at his attackers.
   Also today, Israeli security agents used explosives to blow down
the doors of two houses in the Jerusalem village of Jebel Mukabar
and make arrests.
   Relatives said that Ibrahim Shkirat, 28, and his brother
Mahmoud, 30, were detained. They said a cousin was taken into
custody in a similar raid in a nearby village.
   The Shkirats are brothers of the late Ahmad Mishal Shkirat. He
died of burns last May 4, four days after the car he was driving
exploded near Jerusalem's central police compound. The vehicle was
loaded with kerosene cans, but it was unclear at the time if the
car was rigged to explode or the fire was accidental.

   Oscar who?
   Hollywood's annual award gala drew its glitzy band of movie
stars, directors and producers, but failed to lure a boffo TV
audience, registering its weakest ratings in three years.
   Preliminary ratings figures released Tuesday by ABC showed the
62nd Academy Awards scored a 27.9 rating, meaning it was viewed in
less than 26 million U.S. homes.
   The figures indicate that 48 percent of all television sets in
use were tuned to the show, according the A.C. Nielsen Co.
estimates.
   Last year's Oscars show, which featured a chancy duet between
Rob Lowe and Snow White, was seen in nearly 27 million homes. The
1988 telecast also was more popular than Monday's edition.
   The broadcast was marred by an annoying sound glitch during a
satellite feed from Moscow and was characterized by several
on-screen comments critical of nomination omissions.
   Television critics were mostly kind in their reviews of the
show, although some said it was too long and too conventional.
   The broadcast ran 3 hours, 34 minutes.
   Overseas segments also were shown from England, Japan, Australia
and Argentina, designed to show the film industry's global
influence.
   It was the longest show since the 1984 program, which ran 3
hours, 42 minutes.

   A federal judge has ruled that
confidentiality agreements between reporters and sources must be
explicit for courts to side with sources when they allege such
pacts are broken.
   U.S. District Judge Harry MacLaughlin on Tuesday dismissed a
lawsuit by a Minneapolis woman who complained that Glamour magazine
went too far in identifying her in a story about sexual
exploitation by therapists.
   MacLaughlin said the woman's agreement with writer Claudia
Dreifus was ``too ambiguous to be enforced.''
   The woman agreed to provide the magazine details of the sexual
abuse she suffered during psychiatric therapy in 1979 and 1980, but
she had asked not to be identified _ or identifiable _ in the story.
   Even though the September 1988 article gave the woman a
fictitious last name, it went on to describe her as a Minneapolis
lawyer and gave specifics about her activism on issues involving
sexual abuse of patients by therapists.
   The woman sued Dreifus and Conde Nast Publishing Inc. for breach
of contract.
   ``The court has no doubt that in balancing the rights of the
free press with common contractual rights, the free press rights
under the First Amendment must be given preference,'' MacLaughlin
said.
   Dreifus had testified that the woman ``wanted some kind of
masking,'' but ``was very casual about it.''
   The judge said Dreifus honored the woman's only specific
``masking'' request by not describing problems she had at one of
her previous jobs.
   The woman knows only two people who identified her from the
article and they had been therapists for her, the judge said.
   The article portrayed the woman as ``someone who successfully
recovered from an exploitative situation,'' MacLaughlin wrote.
   ``The `chilling effect' resulting from the possibility of
protracted litigation and large damage awards, recognized by the
Supreme Court in defamation actions, is also present in an action
for breach of a reporter-source agreement,'' MacLaughlin wrote.
   To enforce reporter-source agreements in litigation, plaintiffs
``at a minimum'' must prove ``specific, unambiguous terms and to
provide clear and convincing proof that the agreement was
breached,'' MacLaughlin wrote.
   Elliot Rothenberg, the woman's attorney, said he is discussing
with his client the possibility of an appeal.
   ``Newspapers and media must abide by the agreements they
willingly enter into and the First Amendment does not absolve those
obligations,'' he said.
   Rothenberg said that if he filed an appeal he would invoke the
case of Dan Cohen, a Twin Cities public relations agent who won a
breach of contract lawsuit against the Star Tribune and the St.
Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch, which has since changed its name to
Saint Paul Pioneer Press.
   The newspapers named Cohen as the person who leaked court
documents in 1982 showing that a candidate for lieutenant governor
had been convicted of shoplifting. Reporters promised Cohen
confidentiality, but newspaper editors decided to name him because
they believed the public had a right to know he worked for a rival
gubernatorial candidate.

<HEAD>City Council Approves Ordinances To Limit Cruising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COLLEEN BARRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MODESTO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city that inspired the film
``American Grafitti'' moved to shed its reputation as the Cruising
Capital with a pair of ordinances trying to put the brakes on the
pastime.
   The City Council unanimously approved the two rules Tuesday
night after listening to testimony that ran nearly 3-1 against the
proposals.
   Teen-agers, most of whom were born after the release of the 1973
film directed by George Lucas, a Modesto native, said they cruise
popular McHenry Avenue in this central California city for the same
reasons as their parents: to show off their cars and meet dates.
   ``I'm 17 years old and I've waited all my life to cruise,'' said
Billy Moorehead. ``You can't get rid of us. We're going to stay.''
   Under the ordinances, motorists passing specific checkpoints
more than once in a four-hour period would face fines ranging from
$75 to $250.
   Pedestrians, who routinely gather on sidewalks and in parking
lots along the strip, would risk equal fines for loitering between
6 p.m. and 6 a.m.
   The ordinances, which require a second reading before becoming
law, would be enforced only when traffic moved at less than 5 mph.
   ``My personal opinion is that moderate cruising will still exist
along McHenry,'' said Police Chief Gerald McKinsey.
   The police department, which drafted the proposals, claims
patrol officers can't reach trouble spots when cars clog the avenue
many weekend nights.
   More than half of all assaults along McHenry Avenue and 78
percent of all drug arrests are made during the peak cruising
hours, McKinsey said.
   Supporters of the rules contend that the pastime popularized in
the 1950s is no longer good-natured when influenced by 1990s'
problems: such as vandalism and drugs. They would rather it join
sock hops as an object of nostalgia.
   ``The vandalism, drinking, drugs and prostitutes filter into our
street and yards every weekend night,'' said Terry McCloskey.
``Many of us feel like prisoners in our own homes on weekend nights
because we're afraid of what will happen to our property.''
   Business owners taking up the anti-cruising side say they lose
customers when the daily commuter corridor transforms into a
cruising strip.
   ``Cruising has affected the quality of life on McHenry and for
residents in a negative way,'' said Kyle Barker, a music store
owner who organized the McHenry Avenue Merchants Association.
``Modesto, I don't think, wants to be known as the cruising mecca
of the world.''

<TEXT>
   The union for Daily News reporters voted to
authorize a strike after being offered a proposal that would cut
benefits and extend the work week, while increasing wages.
   The members of Local 3 of the Newspaper Guild voted 267 to 19
Tuesday to authorize their leaders to call a strike.
   ``Hopefully, this will let them know that the people who work at
the News weren't thrilled'' with the contract proposal, said Larry
Sutton, a reporter and member of the Guild negotiating committee.
   The News has said it will advertise for replacement workers for
any union that authorizes a strike and said Tuesday it would do so
for the Guild workers. On Monday, 2,000 people responded to ads for
mailers jobs.
   ``The union leaders' knee-jerk rejection of a 30 percent wage
increase is a grave disservice to their members,'' said John T.
Sloan, the News' vice president for human resources.
   The Guild and nine other unions at the News are negotiating for
new contracts. The old ones expire at midnight Friday, but all
sides expect to continue talking beyond then.
   Management and the unions consider these talks the most
important in the history of the tabloid, which has antiquated
printing equipment and which management says is losing money.
   The News offered the reporters raises of 10 percent for each of
three years. At the proposed contract's end, journalists with six
years' experience would be earning $1,343 a week, higher than those
earned now by any unionized reporters in the country.
   But union leaders complain that other provisions in the proposed
contract will eliminate severance pay and cut back the health and
pension plan.
   Union leaders said the proposed contract extends the work week
by three hours to 37.5 hours, an increase in hours of 8.7 percent.
   They also said the proposed contract fails to guarantee a daily
or weekly wage.
   Barry Lipton, president of Local 3, attacked the company's
proposal to eliminate what he said would be $22 million in
severance pay and have unlimited use of part-time employees.

<HEAD>Doctors Issue Caution on Lasers to Unclog Arteries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``Star Wars'' medical mentality has
bolstered the use of lasers to unclog blocked arteries, but other
methods appear to be more effective and less costly, radiologists
said.
   Doctors meeting here Tuesday for the Society of Cardiovascular
and Intervention Radiology conference also said studies show the
laser method increases the chances of patient complications.
   The radiologists issued the caution after surveying the 1,300
members attending.
   Several papers were submitted comparing lasers to the more
common balloon angioplasty, in which plastic balloons are pushed
through an artery to clear obstruction.
   The papers showed ``lasers actually have results that are
somewhat poorer'' than the balloons when used in partially clogged
arteries, said Dr. Arina van Breda, an associate professor of
radiology at George Washington University in Washington.
   ``Lasers should not be considered to have any proven efficacy,''
said van Breda, program director for the society. ``They should be
considered experimental and patients should be forewarned.''
   The doctors said there are some situations in which lasers
should be used _ chiefly when the blood vessel is completely
blocked, preventing the insertion of a balloon. But they said
lasers should be used only for backup, not as a primary treatment.
   Van Breda said patients are attracted by the idea of lasers,
which sound more advanced than balloon angioplasty.
   ``People think that since they are high-tech, very expensive and
very sexy, they must work _ it's kind of a Star Wars medical
mentality,'' she said.
   Dr. Daniel Choy, who heads the St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital
Center laser laboratory at Columbia University in New York, said he
did not totally disagree with the findings.
   ``Certainly, laser angioplasty is still experimental,'' Choy
said. ``But I don't think lasers by any means are dead _ they are
being constantly improved.''
   He said lasers must improve their reclosure rate if they are to
ever supplant or even complement balloon angioplasty, and said new
techniques _ including the use of ``smart lasers'' which can make
application more specific _ aimed to do just that.
   Dr. Robert Hewes of the Kettering Medical Center in Ohio said
his studies showed laser-opened blood vessels could have been
wiened by simpler, less costly balloon angioplasty _ and at only
about a third of the cost.
   In addition, lasers require an operating room and general
anesthesia, raising costs and the odds of complications, he said.
   Also, the hot-tipped laser itself can actually damage the vessel
lining, which can cause it to close again, he said.
   Hewes and his associate, Dr. Ted Miller, compared 42 laser
angioplasties by vascular surgeons with 32 balloon angioplasties by
interventional radiologists during the same period.
   The laser cases had a 19 percent complication rate, compared to
3 percent for radiologists. And they showed a 50 percent success
rate vs. 94 percent for the balloon procedure.

humor in comic Billy Crystal's Italian joke during the Academy
Awards ceremony, and complained to ABC about it.
   Crystal, host for the 62nd annual awards ceremony broadcast on
ABC, quipped that the proposed purchase of MGM by an Italian
businessman meant the famous lion would no longer roar at the start
of the movie but instead plead the Fifth Amendment.
   ``It was a cheap-shot joke against Italian-Americans,'' said a
release from the Coaltion of Italo-American Organizations. ``There
is a fine line between ethnic humor and negative stereotyping. We
feel (you) crossed that line.''
   The National Italian American Organization joined in the
complaint, according to the Daily News.
   Coalition chairman William Fugazy said he been ``inundated''
with calls from his membership outraged at the joke.
   In a cable to Capital Cities@ABC chairman Thomas Murphy, Fugazy
called Crystal's comments ``insensitive and inane,'' and said the
crowd at the ceremony ``clearly rebelled at Crystal's prejudicial
remarks.''
   Crystal could not be reached immedately for comment.
   He also joked that the Japanese owners of another film studio
wanted to make a romantic script of his into a Godzilla movie.

   A jury that includes three postal workers will
consider charges that former Philippine first lady Imelda Marcos
helped in the alleged plunder of her country's treasury.
   The 12-person panel was sworn in late Tuesday for Mrs. Marcos'
trial in Manhattan's federal court, and Judge John F. Keenan
recessed the trial until April 3 when lawyers will present opening
arguments. Her co-defendant is Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi.
   The jury also includes two transit workers, two utility
employees, a retired secretary, a teacher's aide, an engineer, a
computer operator and an estate manager with a law firm.
   In a written decision released Tuesday, the judge ruled that
bank records from Hong Kong, Singapore and the Philippines could be
used as evidence against Mrs. Marcos.
   Her lawyers had sought to block the foreign bank documents, but
Keenan decided they were admissible because prosecutors had filed
the proper certification. Keenan said he would rule on the
admissibility of documents from Italy, Switzerland and West Germany
before the trial's opening arguments.
   Among the documents allowed as evidence were 2,000 pages of
records from two trust accounts at the Standard Chartered Bank of
Hong Kong, which prosecutors alleged were controlled by Mrs. Marcos
and her late husband, Ferdinand.
   Keenan said the government will use the trust account records to
try to establish that the Marcoses owned three Panamanian companies
that, in turn, owned a building at 40 Wall St.
   The building is among four Manhattan properties which
prosecutors claim the Marcoses bought with more than $160 million
allegedly stolen from the Manila government.
   The Singapore bank records relate to the alleged transfer of
millions of dollars for the purchase of 40 Wall St., the judge's
decision said. The other records found admissible were from the
Traders Royal Bank in Manila.
   Mrs. Marcos, 60, is charged with racketeering, racketeering
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice. If convicted,
she faces up to 50 years in prison and $1 million in fines.
   Khashoggi is accused of helping the Marcoses conceal the New
York real estate deals. He faces up to 10 years in prison and
$500,000 in fines if convicted of mail fraud and obstruction of
justice.
   The trial is expected to last three to four months.

   Pope John Paul II today named the papal
envoy to Colombia as the Holy See's first ambassador to Hungary in
45 years.
   Relations between Hungary and the Vatican, broken when the
government expelled the papal envoy in 1945, were re-established in
February.
   John Paul appointed Archbishop Angelo Acerbi, 64, an Italian
serving in Colombia, to the post.
   Hungary was the second Soviet bloc country to re-establish ties
with the Holy See after the pope's native Poland did so in July.
   This month, the Vatican and the Soviet Union established
official ties, but they fall short of formal diplomatic relations.

   Singer Gloria Estefan was up and walking without

spinal injuries suffered when her band bus collided with a truck on
a snowy road.
   ``She's doing really well,'' said Evelyn Torres, spokeswoman for

   Miss Estefan, star of the Miami Sound Machine, handed out

   Authorities had warned the owners of the
building that housed the Happy Land Social Club that it was riddled
with violations, including no sprinkler system on the first floor,
where the fire started.
   Notice of the fire code violations, which also included an
illegally added-on second floor, no second exit and no fire alarms,
were sent to Alex DiLorenzo III, the owner, building Commissioner
Charles Smith Jr. told The New York Times in today's editions.
   DiLorenzo leased the building to Jay Weiss, husband of actress
Kathleen Turner, who in turn leased the building to club manager
Elias Colon. Colon was among the 87 people who died in the fire
Sunday.
   Normally, the violations report would have been forwarded by the
owner to the leaseholder, but Weiss' attorneys said they never
received a formal notice of the violations. They would not comment
on whether they knew of them.
   Prosecutors are looking into whether the building's landlords or
owners might bear responsibility for the fire. Police alleged it
was set by Julio Gonzalez, in a jealous rage against his
ex-girlfriend, who worked at the club.
   The club was incorporated in 1988 as a not-for-profit
corporation for ``the purpose of providing for members
entertainment, sport, recreation and amusement of all kinds,'' the
Times reported.
   The incorporation papers appeared to enable Colon to avoid
filing state and city income tax forms, the Times said.
   Weiss had been trying to evict the Happy Land Social Club for
non-payment of rent since September, according to Weiss' lawyer,
Roger Boyle.
   A lease signed by Happy Land on Oct. 7, 1987, called for monthly
rents of $1,500 for the first year, $1,650 for the second and
$1,950 for the third.
   Court papers concerning the rent squabble show that on Feb. 15,
1989, a process server stuck a notice on the door of Happy Land
demanding $3,074 within three days for rent payments allegedly due
since Dec. 1, 1987.
   Weiss' company, One Peach Associates, asked a marshal to obtain
an eviction notice on Sept. 6, 1989, according to the papers. A
judge validated the eviction warrant the next week and then Colon
filed to stop the proceedings, saying he had not seen the court
papers.
   Colon maintained in an affidavit that all his rent had been
paid. A judge granted a stay of the eviction warrant.
   Papers filed on March 12 assert that Colon ``made substantial
improvements to the premises with the approval and consent of the
petitioner.''
   The case was to have been tried today.
   One Peach also leased space to La Salsa, another after-hours
club around the corner from Happy Land, for $2,500 a month, the
Daily News said in today's editions.
   Neighborhood residents said La Salsa has one door and no
windows. Because of fire code violations, it had been ordered
closed on Aug. 28, 1988, the News reported.
   La Salsa was packed with revelers on the night of the fire at
Happy Land.

<TEXT>
   A museum planning to exhibit sexually explicit
photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe has taken the unusual
step of asking a court to decide whether they violate local
obscenity laws.
   The private Contemporary Arts Center hopes to forestall the
sheriff's threat to file obscenity charges against the museum when
it opens the six-week exhibit April 6.
   Sheriff Simon Leis, a veteran anti-smut campaigner, has called
some of the pictures ``criminally obscene'' and said he will take
action against the exhibit if police do not.
   Nine of the 175 photographs in the show depict homosexual
activity and sadomasochistic sex acts. The pictures led Congress
last year to limit federal support for the arts after Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., labeled them obscene.
   The museum Tuesday filed a petition for a jury trial in
Municipal Court. A trial date was not immediately set. Museum
officials said they expected a ruling before the exhibit opens.
   ``It may be unorthodox for the person displaying the material to
initiate this action, but in this case it is the common-sense thing
to do,'' said Marc Mezibov, a lawyer for the museum.
   The show is an attempt to broaden artistic horizons in a city
that has closed every adult bookstore and prosecuted publisher
Larry Flynt for distributing Hustler magazine, museum officials
said.
   ``I think there are people in the community who are a little
embarrassed about the community's tendency to cave in to
censorship,'' said Jack Sawyer, curator at the center.
   Chad Wick resigned last week as the chairman of the board of the
Contemporary Arts Center, saying opponents of the exhibit were
exerting heavy pressure on his employer, the Central Trust Co.
   Last summer, the private Corcoran Gallery in Washington canceled
an exhibit of the Mapplethorpe photos, but they were later shown at
the Washington Project for the Arts and appeared without incident
in Philadelphia; Chicago; Boston; Hartford, Conn., and Berkeley,
Calif.
   ``The city of Cincinnati police department has jurisdiction if
the pictures are exhibited downtown, but if they fail to do what
should be done, I will do it myself,'' said Leis.
   Leis, then county prosecutor, prosecuted Flynt in 1977 on
charges of pandering obscenity. Flynt was convicted, but an appeals
court in 1979 ordered a new trial. A new prosecutor dropped the
charges in 1985.
   The museum director, Dennis Barrie, arranged for the exhibit
after seeing Mapplethorpe's photographs in New York City in 1988,
before they sparked controversy in Congress.
   ``I thought it was absolutely the most stunning photographic
show I'd seen in years,'' Barrie said. ``There was no doubt in my
mind that for this community and even for any community some of the
work would be controversial, especially the work that dealt with
his homosexual lifestyle. But, on the whole, the show was so
overwhelmingly beautiful.''
   The exhibit of Mapplethorpe's works also include pictures of
marble sculpture, dramatically lighted flowers and portraits of
bodybuilder Lisa Lyons and artists Andy Warhol and Laurie Anderson.
   Mapplethorpe died of AIDS in March 1989.
   Because of the uproar over the Corcoran Gallery exhibit,
Congress approved a 1990 appropriation to the National Endowment
for the Arts that forbids support of homoerotic or sadomasochistic
art or depictions of sex acts.
   The Contemporary Arts Center is using no government money on the
$50,000 exhibition. It will rely on ticket sales and a $10,000
grant from a local video production company, Barrie said.
   Barrie said the museum will put sexually explicit photographs in
a separate gallery with a prominently displayed warning. People
under age 18 will not be admitted without an adult.

   Rival Zulu factions armed with
guns and knives waged bloody battles and set homes ablaze in Natal
province today, while hundreds of soldiers and police moved in to
halt their ``full-scale war.''
   Terrified residents in black townships near the southeastern
city of Pietermaritzburg abandoned their homes and fled into the
countryside, residents said.
   ``It almost looks as though the whole area is burning,'' police
Maj. Piet Kitching said.
   Army units were deployed around Edendale near Pietermaritzburg
after 2,000 Zulus supporting the Inkatha party attacked supporters
of the rival United Democratic Front. Police said patrols used
shotguns and tear gas to disperse mobs attacking and burning houses.
   Police reported widespread clashes in the area since Tuesday,
with at least two people dead and about 25 wounded in the fighting.
But local reporters, who did not want to be named, said up to 14
people had been killed and scores of houses set on fire in
townships around Edendale, in Natal province.
   Tens of thousands of people were unable to go to work, when the
bus service shut down because of attacks, and the milling crowds
added to the tension.
   ``Things are completely out of control. It looks terrible. There
were 2,000 people fighting it out with guns and other weapons,''
said a journalist reached by phone.
   ``It's a bloody war out there,'' a medical worker said.
   Peter Kerchhoff, of a Pietermaritzburg peace group, said dirt
roads leading to townships were blockaded with tree tunks,
boulders, and burning tires; people were fleeing with pieces of
furniture, and houses were burning in several townships. As his
group drove through the crowds taking four injured to the hospital
Kerchhoff said: ``People were saying, `Please, we need guns.'''
   ``There are reports of a full-scale war. Thousands of people are
moving up to defend an area and thousands are moving down to
attack,'' said Radley Keys, a community worker.
   Zulus went on the rampage in the area after opponents stoned
buses and other vehicles returning Sunday from a Zulu rally, police
said. Police said Zulus hijacked buses to truck in hundreds of
armed youths for the fighting.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in black factional fighting
in recent weeks in Natal. The Zulu tribe's Inkatha movement is
fighting the UDF for control of the region.
   Both groups are anti-apartheid, but Inkatha supports separate
states for different tribes or ethnic groups. The UDF wants a black
majority government ruling all of South Africa.
   Several local leaders charged police were aiding Inkatha
fighters, giving them ammunition and helping them attack rival UDF
fighters. The leaders were appealing to government officials to
force police to act impartially.
   Pierre Cronje, a white member of Parliament of the opposition
Democratic Party, said he was furious because police were merely
``scolding'' armed Inkatha men instead of trying to confiscate
their weapons and disperse them.
   Police commanders had no immediate response to the charges.
   Residents said hundreds of troops were seen near Edendale.
   An army spokesman, Col. John Rolt, said troops had been sent to
the area to aid police but gave no further details.
   Efforts by Nelson Mandela and other black leaders to end the
fighting have failed despite extensive appeals for peace.
   In other developments, President F.W. de Klerk said in
Parliament in Cape Town on Tuesday night that a date could not be
set for ending apartheid laws. He said the government wanted to
move as quickly as possible, but the issue was linked to pending
talks on ending white-minority rule.
   The government is to meet with the African National Congress
April 11 to try to clear the way for talks on sharing political
power with blacks.

   A prestigious Soviet newspaper today criticized
Hungary's state airline for suspending flights of Soviet Jews to
Israel last week, calling the decision capitulation to
international terrorism.
   ``I see it as my duty to decisively condemn such an action,''
political commentator Igor Belyayev said in the weekly
Literaturnaya Gazeta.
   It was the first known Soviet condemnation of the decision by
the carrier, Malev, to suspend service to Tel Aviv after a threat
from Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, an Arab
extremist group.
   The article did not, however, mention the position taken by the
Soviet national airline Aeroflot, which has stopped selling tickets
for Soviet Jewish emigres traveling to Hungary.
   Belyayev said there appeared to be a genuine threat to Malev
passengers' security but added ``reconciliation with the Islamic
Jihad's provocation amounts to indecisiveness in the fight against
international terrorism.''
   Up to 750,000 Jews are expected to emigrate to Israel in the
next few years as the result of relaxed rules in the Soviet Union
and tighter entry quotas in the United States.
   The expected influx has angered Arab leaders, who fear
Palestinians will be displaced by the new arrivals.
   A Kuwaiti newspaper today quoted a senior adviser to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev as saying that Arabs are
exaggerating the issue of Soviet Jewish emigration to Israel.
   Georgy Arbatov, a member of the Central Committee and director
of the United States and Canada Institute, also predicted in an
interview with Al-Watan that the number of Soviet Jews going to
Israel ``will be on the retreat.''
   In Leningrad, 13 Jews held a demonstration and a hunger strike
at the Hungarian Consulate, demanding immediate transportation or
compensation for those who had Malev tickets, as well as a public
apology, said Abraham Demin, an activist who participated in the
protest Tuesday.
   Hungarian officials later pledged rapid transportation of the
emigres who have bought Malev tickets and said they would be taken
by trains, buses or Aeroflot planes, he said.
   Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay has said Malev is
independent of the ``party-state'' and that the government hoped it
would reconsider its decision and resume flights to Israel.
   On Tuesday, the Bush administration expressed disappointment at
the Malev move and urged Hungary to reconsider and a group of U.S.
Jewish leaders met with a senior Foreign Ministry official to
express concern about the steps taken by Aeroflot and Malev, the
mission's leader said.
   Marvin Lander, national chairman-elect of the United Jewish
Appeal, said representatives of some 140 U.S. Jewish leaders
visiting Moscow met with Yuri Reshetov, head of the Foreign
Ministry's department of international humanitarian cooperation and
human rights.
   ``We expressed to him our great concern over response of the
Soviet Union and Eastern European countries to terrorist threats.
We hope these governments would not cave in,'' Lander said.
   He said Reshetov ``could not answer'' questions about Aeroflot,
and that Soviet officials ``continue to point the finger at the
Hungarians.''
   ``Obviously what took place last week is of great concern to
us,'' Lander said. ``This is certainly a roadbock to the emigration
of thousands and thousands of Soviet Jews to Israel. We hope it's
only temporary.''
   Jewish leaders worldwide, concerned about rising Russian
nationalism and anti-Semitism, fear a pogrom of Soviet Jews and are
urging all measures to expedite their emigration.
   Polish leaders have said their country is ready to provide
assistance for the emigrants. Some Jews are flying to Israel via
the Romanian capital of Bucharest and many others are traveling to
Budapest by train to get on Israeli El Al planes.
   In Jerusalem, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today lashed out at
Arab threats against Soviet Jews headed for Israel and derided
Western leaders as ``gullible'' for accepting Arab claims of
moderation toward the Jewish state.
   ``Let the world open its ears and its eyes to the Arab threats
to blow up planes that carry Jewish immigrants,'' Shamir said.

<TEXT>
   The foreign minister said today that Chinese-U.S.
relations will suffer if President Bush imposes trade sanctions on
China to protest Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators
last year.
   The minister, Qian Qichen, also demanded that Fang Lizhi, a
dissident living in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, ``plead guilty''
to charges of counterrevolutionary activities.
   Fang, a leading astrophysicist and intellectual, was granted
sanctuary at the embassy in June after the military crushed
pro-democracy student demonstrations, killing at least 500 people.
   Members of Congress have called for economic sanctions against
China because of the continued suppression of political dissent
following the June crackdown.
   Qian said that an end to most-favored-nation status for China,
``will undoubtedly greatly impair the trade relations between our
two countries, thus causing a major retrogression in our
relations.''
   He called on the United States to ``make a wise decision'' and
avoid harming relations.
   President Bush must inform Congress by June 3 whether to renew
the 1980 agreement granting most-favored-nation status to China.
Congress has three months to override his decision.
   The United States is China's third biggest trading partner after
Hong Kong and Japan. The loss of most-favored-nation status would
result in substantially higher tariffs on Chinese imports to the
United States.
   Qian said his government will not allow the pro-democracy
movement sweeping through the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to
spread to China.
   He said China has ``every reason to guard'' against reformers
who are trying to alter its socialist system.

   Prosecutors intend to use a pair of
gasoline-soaked sneakers and a hunk of dance floor to help make
their case against a man charged with setting the fire that killed
87 people in a social club.
   A grand jury Tuesday began hearing evidence against 36-year-old
Julio Gonzalez, charged with 87 murders in the blaze at the Happy
Land Social Club in the Bronx. Police said he set the fire early
Sunday after being snubbed by an ex-girlfriend who worked there.
   ``We'll have a made case even if he backs out of the
confession,'' said Edward McCarthy, spokesman for the Bronx
prosecutor's office.
   Gonzalez was transferred Tuesday to a prison unit within the
psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital, where a fellow inmate said
he raged for hours against his ex-girlfriend.
   ``He is so emotionally distraught that tears keep coming down,''
the inmate, Louis Cuascut, said in today's New York Post. ``He
seems very, very depressed.''
   The Happy Land club had been ordered closed for fire and safety
code violations and the landlord was trying to evict the owner for
non-payment of rent.
   The building that housed the illegal club was subleased to the
club's operator by a company co-owned by actress Kathleen Turner's
husband, Jay Weiss. He leased it from one of New York's biggest
landlords, Alex DiLorenzo III.
   Turner said she was shocked by the fire but that her husband
wasn't to blame.
   ``It's unfortunate that it was that building but the fact is
that you can even throw a firebomb into McDonald's and it would
have had the same result,'' Turner said outside her Manhattan
apartment, the Post reported today.
   The actress, starring in a Broadway revival of ``Cat on a Hot
Tin Roof,'' said she was afraid that people would come to her home
seeking vengeance.
   Turner also said Tuesday through her publicist, ``This is an act
of a violent madman. It's a tragedy. It doesn't reflect on me or my
husband.''
   Among those scheduled to testify against Gonzalez are his
ex-girlfriend, Lydia Feliciano, a worker at the club; and the man
who sold Gonzalez the $1 worth of gasoline he allegedly used to
start the blaze.
   ``And then we have the container that held the gasoline, his
sneakers, which were soaked with gasoline,'' McCarthy said. ``We
even cut up a hunk of the floor and brought it in to prove the burn
pattern was caused by gasoline.''
   District Attorney Robert Johnson said Gonzalez gave police a
videotaped statement in which he admitted that he torched the Happy
Land in a pique against Ms. Feliciano.
   Besides Ms. Feliciano, four other people escaped the inferno.
   Authorities had warned DiLorenzo that Happy Land was riddled
with violations, including an illegally added second floor, no
sprinklers on the first floor, no second exit and no fire alarms,
Building Commissioner Charles Smith Jr. said in today's New York
Times.
   Normally the violations report would have been forwarded by the
owner to the leaseholder, but Weiss' attorneys said they never
received a formal notice of the violations. They would not comment
on whether they knew of them.
   Weiss, through his lawyer Roger Boyle, said Tuesday that One
Peach Associates, a company he owns with Morris Jaffe, leased the
building in 1985 from DiLorenzo's Clarendon Place Corp.
   One Peach two years later leased the club to its operator, Elias
Colon, for up to $1,950 a month. Boyle said that since last spring
the company had been trying to evict Colon for not paying rent. The
case was to have been heard in court today. Colon died in the fire.
   One Peach also leased space to a second after-hours club, called
La Salsa, around the corner from Happy Land, for $2,500 a month,
the Daily News reported today.
   Neighborhood residents said La Salsa, too, was packed with
revelers Saturday night. The club has one door and no windows.
Because of fire code violations, it had been ordered to close in
August 1988.
   Because many of the fire victims were poor Honduran immigrants,
10 airlines have offered to ship the remains free from Miami to
Honduras, said Larry Mackler, a spokesman for the American Red
Cross. The Red Cross plans to fly next-of-kin back as well to make
funeral arrangements.

   In 1980, the Census Bureau's computers
apparently balked at the name Secretary, and the town got no survey
forms. This year, the town's population of about 550 is again
waiting.
   ``It's a very unfortunate coincidence,'' said Marilyn Stant,
manager of the census district office in Salisbury.
   Stant said Secretary eventually was counted after the last
census and will be counted this year too. As for why the town's 295
post office boxes have yet to get the forms sent nationwide last
week, the cause is not clear.
   ``There were one or two ZIP codes where the post office had its
own little mix-up. No system is absolutely perfect,'' Stant said.
   Ron Kern, the Postal Service's Eastern Shore census coordinator
in Wilmington, Del., said Secretary ``was one of the small towns we
didn't receive any mailings for. If they don't provide us the
forms, we can't deliver them.''
   ``We still look for them in the mail every day,'' said Walter
Collins, mayor of the Warwick River town. ``We've had quite a bit
of population growth in the last two years. I'd like to get them
all filled out and see what the town's doing.''

   Defense consultant William M. Galvin
pleaded guilty today to charges he bribed an assistant Navy
secretary and another senior Pentagon official to influence the
award of defense contracts.
   Galvin, a major figure in the Justice Department's investigation
of Pentagon procurement fraud dubbed ``Operation Ill Wind,''
pleaded guilty to conspiracy, bribery and tax evasion.
   Galvin, 59, admitted that he, Assistant Navy Secretary Melvyn R.
Paisley and two Israeli businessmen conspired to influence the
award of a Navy contract to guide remote-controlled drone aircraft.
Paisley resigned from the Pentagon in 1987 to become a defense
consultant.
   As part of the deal, Galvin, Paisley and the two Israeli
businessmen were to split $2 million that an Israeli company,
Mazlat, would place in a Swiss bank account, according to court
papers.
   Paisley ordered the Navy to purchase a ground station for the
aircraft drones that was produced by Mazlat, according to the court
documents. Paisley issued the order when the Navy was about to
purchase electronic equipment for the pilotless remote-controlled
aircraft from another company.
   Six days after Paisley signed the directive, the company placed
$50,000 in the Swiss account, according to the court papers.
   In all, the company put $268,000 into the Swiss account to be
split by Paisley, Galvin and the businessmen, Mazlat President Zvi
Schiller and consultant Uri Simhoni, according to the documents.
   Galvin additionally admitted that he conspired to bribe Victor
D. Cohen, a senior civilian Air Force procurement officer, to
influence the award of radar electronics contracts to Loral Corp.
   Neither Paisley nor Cohen has been charged in the continuing
investigation. Galvin agreed to cooperate with the probe, which has
produced 35 convictions in the last two years.
   As part of the plea agreement, Galvin agreed to pay back taxes
and interest that he failed to report on his income tax forms
totaling $647,548.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton scheduled sentencing for
Aug. 3. Galvin could be sentenced to up to four years in prison and
fined as much as $1 million on his guilty pleas to two counts of
bribery, conspiracy and tax evasion.

   Barbara Bush says an insensitive remark by
Clayton Williams won't deter her and President Bush from
campaigning on behalf of the Republican gubernatorial nominee.
   Mrs. Bush, who was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame
on Tuesday, said she is proud Williams apologized for a remark he
made over the weekend about rape.
   At a rain-delayed cattle roundup Saturday in west Texas,
Williams compared the weather to rape, saying, ``If it's
inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.''
   Williams has apologized, saying the remark was ``insensitive and
had no place at the campfire or in any setting.''
   Mrs. Bush said Williams is ``quite a person to speak up
immediately and apologize and say he made a mistake. I'm proud of
him and that's the last I'm going to say about it.''
   Mrs. Bush was inducted into the Texas Women's Hall of Fame at
its sixth annual awards ceremony with seven others.
   The first lady also received a special achievement award for
community service in Texas and throughout the nation. Henceforth,
the annual award will be known as the ``Barbara Bush Award,'' it
was announced.

<HEAD>Soviet Ministers Face Grilling by Legislature</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government ministers today for the first time
faced a public parliamentary grilling on topics ranging from
chronic food shortages to a foiled scheme to sell tanks abroad.
   The appearance of the ministers before the Supreme Soviet marked
another step toward making appointed officials subordinate to the
elected legislature, as envisaged in the perestroika program of
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Previously, ministers had faced organized questioning only once,
at their confirmation hearings last summer.
   Most of the heat fell on economic ministers who were asked to
explain why an economic revival plan adopted three months ago had
failed to produce tangible results.
   Vladilen Nikitin, first deputy chairman of the Council of
Ministers, said the growth in the rate of food production shrank by
more than 50 percent between 1988 and 1989, and that the growth of
processing capacities was running far behind demand.
   ``Moving up the introduction of regulated market relations is
the only way out of a very difficult situation,'' Tass quoted him
as saying.
   Deputy Premier Alexandra Biryukova, who is also a candidate
member of the Politburo, was quizzed for 90 minutes about shortages
of consumer goods.
   She said production of consumer goods had increased 6 percent in
January and February compared with the same period last year. But,
she said, targets for some types of goods were not reached.
   Mrs. Biryukova blamed the shortfalls on instability in the
country, including strikes and work stoppages because of political
demonstrations.
   Igor Byelousov, chief of the Soviet military-industrial complex,
was then grilled about a foiled scheme to sell a dozen Soviet tanks
to the West.
   The plan surfaced in January and involved the ANT cooperative,
which acquired the tanks from a factory and was trying to transport
the sophisticated T-72 tanks to an unidentified buyer in Europe.
The scheme was uncovered and foiled by the military.
   ``Byelousov was asked many loaded questions about the recent
deal of the ANT state-cooperative enterprise, which tried to export
tanks illegally,'' Tass said. ``The case is being investigated, but
the deputy prime minister's answers did not dispel the deputies'
concern.''
   The news agency said the deputies wanted to know the
responsbility not only of low-level officials involved, ``but also
of those in high places who authorized it.''
   Among some 60 observers at the Supreme Soviet session was Sen.
Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who was on a visit to the Soviet Union.
   ``I thought the questions were informed, intelligent, good
responses, a lively exchange, and I think the whole political
institution is being re-examined,'' Kennedy said after the session.
   But Tass said the first quizzing of ministers fell short of
expectations. ``Some questions were too general, while some answers
were too vague,'' the news agency quoted critics in the legislature
as saying. It said Cabinet officers had received about 140 written
questions from deputies.

   The military today ordered two
generals and 19 other officers to stand trial for participating in
December's coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino.
   Gen. Renato de Villa, the military chief of staff, issued the
order after military investigators ruled there was sufficient
evidence to court-martial the 21 officers for mutiny, murder and
conduct unbecoming of an officer, said army spokesman Col. Juanito
Rimando.
   No date was set for the trials, but de Villa ordered a judge
advocate, Gen. Manuel Casaclang, to expedite the proceedings,
Rimando said.
   The December coup attempt was the bloodiest of the six armed
attempts to topple Mrs. Aquino since she took office in the 1986
``people power'' uprising against the late Ferdinand Marcos. At
least 113 people were killed and more than 600 were wounded before
the fighting ended.
   Those charged included Brig. Gen. Marcelo Blando and Brig. Gen.
Jose Commendador.
   Commendador took over an air base near the central city of Cebu,
350 miles southeast of Manila. It was the last position surrendered
by the mutineers.
   Blando led mutinous Scout Rangers from the central province of
Nueva Ecija but surrendered to government forces one day after the
coup attempt was launched on Dec. 1.
   The other officers ordered to stand trial include three
colonels, seven lieutenant colonels, three majors, five captains
and a first lieutenant.

   Cuba is expected to take additional measures
against the United States in retaliation for U.S.-sponsored
television programming to the island, producing further setbacks to
the already strained relationship.
   After Cuban authorities jammed the initial broadcasts of TV
Marti on Tuesday, the State Department expressed regret but said
transmissions will continue.
   Broadcasting resumed this morning at 3:45 a.m. EST, but Cuban
authorities jammed the signal within three minutes, a Voice of
America official said. The programming went off the air at 6:45 a.m.
   The emphasis was on entertainment as testing began Tuesday, but
a primary goal of the station is to provide objective news to a
country that the administration says has received none in 31 years.
   The station is a pet project of conservative elements of the
Cuban exile community in Florida, and Cuban officials have told
U.S. diplomats that exiles may be a target of Cuban retaliation.
   Possible measures include a suspension of air and telephone
links between the United States and Cuba _ services that exiles
heavily depend on.
   TV Marti is modeled after Radio Marti, which some employees fear
will be the next target of Cuban jamming. The station has been
broadcasting relatively free of interference since going on the air
in 1985.
   There also is the possibility that Cuba may try to interfere
with domestic U.S. stations. Last Friday, Cuba broadcast a radio
speech by President Fidel Castro that disrupted stations along the
Florida coast and as far away as Nashville, Tenn.
   Ariel Ricardo, spokesman at the Cuban diplomatic mission in
Washington, left little doubt that additional measures are planned
beyond jamming.
   ``You never use up all your bullets in the first assault,'' he
said, charging that the station violates international law.
   Gillian Gunn, a Cuba specialist at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said, ``The administration should not be
lulled into believing that Cuba won't retaliate more vigorously.''
   U.S.-Cuban relations have generally deteriorated in recent
months and the introduction of TV Marti leaves prospects for
improvement even bleaker.
   Castro has been warning his countrymen that, with the U.S.
military ouster of Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega, Cuba may be next
on President Bush's agenda. He has said that any invading force
will spill ``rivers of blood.''
   In Panama, the commander of U.S. military forces in Latin
America, Gen. Marc Cisneros, said, ``We don't have the slightest
intention of invading Castro right now. There is no need to. His
own people are going to do to him what ... (Panamanians) did to
Noriega.''
   Defending the selection of programs for the testing debut, U.S.
Information Agency and Voice of America officials said the goal was
to determine technical feasibility and not to influence Cuban
public opinion.
   After a test pattern, there was a tape from the 1971
Baltimore-Pittsburgh World Series, an old ``Kate and Allie''
sitcom, MTV videos and a travelogue about New Mexico.
   ``The programs stink,'' said Frank Calzon, a Cuban exile who is
a TV Marti supporter and Washington director of a pro-democracy
group called Freedom House. He said the premiere should have
featured tape on the opening of the Berlin Wall and on the Chilean
and Nicaraguan elections.
   Jorge Mas Canosa, the chairman of a Miami-based organization
that oversees TV Marti, had a different reaction. He said several
viewers in Cuba had phoned relatives in Miami to say they were
``very, very enthused, extremely satisfied and really excited.''
   The Cuban government issued a statement through the official
news agency Prensa Latina saying that TV Marti constitutes an
aggressive action and violates Cuban sovereignty.
   The TV Marti signal was sent from an antenna aboard a balloon
dangling 10,000 feet above Cudjoe Key off the South Florida coast.
Technical problems have delayed testing for months.
   Now that testing has begun, the Bush administration has three
months to make a legal and technical evaluation of the operation,
according to the legislation that authorized the station.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
international agreements do not prevent a country from engaging in
television broadcasting to another country. She also noted that the
U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights entitles all people to
the freedom to ``seek, receive and impart information and ideas
through the media.''

   A thimbleful of bugs temporarily
delayed preparation of the mammoth, $1.5 billion telescope that
will allow scientists to look deeper into the infinities of space
than ever before, NASA says.
   The gnat-like insects, called midges, were found in a room where
the Hubble Space Telescope was being readied for installation in
space shuttle Discovery. They forced NASA to delay loading the
telescope until at least Thursday.
   Engineers feared the insects could damage the fragile
25,000-pound instrument, the most expensive unmanned spacecraft
ever built.
   ``It's kind of ironic, something so tiny affecting something so
big,'' said Lisa Malone, a spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   As of Tuesday evening, 37 midges had been sucked into seven
traps set up in the preparation room.
   ``They're calling it the body count,'' Malone said.
   Three or so more midges were captured overnight in the 4-foot
cylinders, which contain fans and lights that apparently lured the
insects. Technicians removed the traps today and began taking a
special protective bag off the telescope in preparation for
Thursday's installation.
   Installation originally was planned for Tuesday.
   ``It is a super clean payload,'' explained NASA spokesman George
Diller. ``Any little particle at all can significantly degrade the
effectiveness of looking at a very faint object.''
   The delay in loading the Hubble will not affect Discovery's
scheduled April 12 liftoff, Diller said.
   Once it begins orbiting 370 miles above Earth, the Hubble will
be capable of looking seven times more deeply into space and
detecting objects 50 times fainter than the best ground-based
observatory.
   Astronomers will be able to look back almost to the beginning of
time by studying stars and galaxies so distant that their light has
been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.
   The shuttle launch may be moved up a day or two since
technicians have needed little of the contingency time built into
Discovery's prelaunch program, even after being bugged by bugs.
   Mother Nature has troubled Hubble since the telescope arrived at
Kennedy Space Center in October. Crews cannot spray insect
repellent because of the telescope's extreme sensitivity, Diller
said.
   In October, moths invaded an anteroom used to prepare the
43-foot telescope for transfer into a special clean room. Then, in
December, wasps snuck into the room through a cable conduit.
   Each time, crews kept the telescope from being contaminated,
Diller said. The telescope is kept inside a special protective bag,
or cocoon, that is opened only in order for work to be performed.
   The midges were found on the orbiter's payload bay doors Sunday
when a servicing machine was retracted to receive the telescope.
The door was vacuumed, but some of the insects got inside a payload
preparation room on the launch tower.
   Until lately, NASA feared a baby great-horned owl in a nest atop
Discovery's launch pad structure might interfere with liftoff.
However, the bird has not been spotted in nearly a week.
   ``We're on a wildlife refuge and critters are something we have
to deal with around here,'' Diller said. ``Like the owls and
gators, sometimes they (insects) will affect launch operations.
That's part of the business at the cape.''

<TEXT>
   Two Lebanese extremist groups
today claimed responsibility for the assassination of an American
missionary who was gunned down by masked men in his home while
singing prayers with his children.
   Villagers had accused William Robinson, 59, of trying to
establish an Israeli settlement in Rashaya Foukhar in southern
Lebanon.
   Acquaintances had said Robinson, who was born and raised in
Athol, Mass., only wanted to expand his 7-year-old orphanage for
handicapped children, located in Israel's self-declared security
zone.
   Israel denied that any such settlement was planned, and sent
troops to scour the area in search of the killers.
   U.S. officials said Robinson had been repeatedly warned of
danger.
   Three masked assailants broke into Robinson's house Tuesday
night while he was singing bedtime prayers with his American wife,
four sons and 26 other children from his orphanage, Lebanese
security sources told U.N. investigators.
   The assailants then tied up Robinson's wife, Barbara, and sent
the children into another room before shooting Robinson three times
in the neck and chest, the sources said. The masked men also took
$4,000 and some jewelry before fleeing. They also killed his guard
dogs.
   In Beirut, the Communist Party and the pro-Syrian Lebanese
National Resistance Front claimed responsibility for the killing.
   ``One of our units Tuesday night carried out the death sentence
against William Robinson, who was seeking to establish an Israeli
settlement on Lebanese territory,'' a statement from the front
said. The front has carried out several guerrilla raids on Israeli
targets in the area.
   The Communist Party said in its statement that the slaying
``brought an end to schemes to plant Jewish settlers in south
Lebanon.'' The party and its militia have carried out numerous
raids on Israeli targets, including an abortive suicide truck
bombing in southern Lebanon on April 21, 1985.
   U.S. Embassy officials in Tel Aviv, Israel, said Robinson had
been repeatedly advised of U.S. government policy barring Americans
from visiting Lebanon. They gave no hometown, citing restrictions
on privacy.
   Rashaya Foukhar is inside Israel's ``security zone'' in southern
Lebanon, about eight miles northeast of Israel's border. The
six-to-10-mile-deep zone was set up to serve as a buffer against
raids by guerrillas and is policed by the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army.
   William F. Wolford, administrator of the International Christian
Embassy in Jerusalem, said Robinson was a former U.S. Marine from
just outside Chicago who ``had a love for the children of Lebanon
and went there to help.''
   He said Robinson was a missionary who ``stayed in Lebanon
because there was no other place to take care of these 20 children.
He was trying to get permission to adopt so he could bring them
out. He was trying to expand the facilities there.''
   Robinson's sister said her brother didn't have any political
motive for settling in Israel's security zone.
   ``A lot of the children's parents had been killed,'' she said in
a telephone interview from her home in Athol. ``He taught them
right in the home so that there wouldn't be so many children
killed. That was his purpose in going over there.''
   She said Robinson had studied electronics in the Marines and
worked on television cable systems in Athol and Pittsfield, Mass.,
before moving to California and Illinois.
   Earlier this month, 5,000 residents of Rashaya Foukhar
petitioned the government of President Elias Hrawi to prevent
Robinson from establishing what they called the first ``Israeli''
settlement on Lebanese soil.
   The petition said Robinson moved to settle in the town's school
right after Israel's 1982 invasion and gradually brought in
relatives and Israeli acquaintances.
   Beirut newspapers have said Robinson used trained dogs to keep
villagers off his fenced compound, arousing their suspicion about
his activities.
   But sources in Lebanon, who asked not to be identified further,
said Robinson was engaged in a dispute with Shiite Moslems over
land on which he wanted to expand his orphanage.
   Robinson first entered Lebanon from Israel in 1978 and worked as
a technician at a Christian TV station in the southern Lebanese
town of Marjayoun. In 1983, he founded his ``Christian Children's
Home'' project in Rashaya Foukhar and was caring for 29 handicapped
children when he was shot, security sources said.
   The compound includes a young adults' home, a children's home, a
swimming pool, a vocational training school, a medical center, a
physical therapy center, a school, a retirement home and an animal
shelter, as well as administration offices and stables.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   March 24
   Statesman Journal, Salem, Ore., on the Soviet Union:
   Democracy is breaking out in the heartland of the Soviet Union
in a way that contradicts the view that voters stick with the
safety of what they know _ or that Soviet voters are less ready
than others to run their own lives.
   Soviet voters know the Communist Party, but large numbers are
turning to the uncertainties of democratic reform instead.
   The speed with which this is progressing is no less a miracle
than the transformations that have broken upon the nations of
Eastern Europe that were once under Soviet domination.
   The most dramatic change is taking place in the Slavic republics
of Russia, Byelorussia and the Ukraine, which represent two-thirds
of the nation's population.
   Supporters of democratic reform movements in this key region
began turning out Communist Party candidates in runoff elections
days after the Soviet Congress legalized a multiple-party system.
...
   Although it is too early to determine the total implications of
this voting, it would appear that the Soviet Union itself is firmly
in the grip of a revolution. The peaceful revolution of the ballot
box appears to be sweeping aside the heirs of the bloody 1917
Bolshevik Revolution.
   The implications of a pluralistic Soviet Union that runs from
the bottom up, rather than as it has been, from the top down, is
almost too much to grasp for minds honed on this century's decades
of hot and cold wars.

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle on the Soviet Union:
   As the Baltic states of Estonia and Latvia line up beside the
Republic of Lithuania in acting to end their occupation by Soviet
troops, Soviet leaders should consider where their nation's best
interests lie.
   Is it in trying to force the Baltics to be a part of the Soviet
Union that forcibly and illegally ``annexed'' them 50 years ago,
thus leaving a perpetually hostile tier of constituent republics on
its western border?
   Or is it in working with the Baltics to end the Soviet
occupation as efficiently and quickly as possible, and having a
neutral but potentially friendly tier of independent nations along
the western border instead?
   Clearly, the Soviet Union's long-term interests are better
served by the latter alternative. It's just as clear that only
brute force could stop the Baltic independence movement now _ a
move that would destroy utterly any Soviet claims of being a
changed society.

   Riverside (Calif.) Press-Enterprise on Lithuania:
   Mikhail Gorbachev has built up a pretty substantial surplus of
good will with the West over the last few years. Now, finally, in
Lithuania, he's having to spend some of those savings. ...
   Stepping up military exercises on the Lithuanian border will
cost him some. Ordering all Lithuanians to turn in their guns to
Soviet authorities will cost him. Parading armored personnel
carriers through the streets of Vilnius will cost him. ...
   Events are moving right along on this front, and they're
following old ruts. ...
   Back in January, after the Lithuanian Communist Party voted to
break away from the Soviet national party, ... Gorbachev became the
first Soviet leader to visit there since the Soviets took over in
1940. He spent three days, with political leaders, in the streets,
in a factory. Everywhere he raised the most pragmatic reasons
against Lithuania's secession from the U.S.S.R. But there were
nationalist rallies in the squares: The process already was under
way.
   At that point ... Gorbachev, looking reluctant as could be, left
the impression he might ultimately tolerate it. Now no one is quite
so sure that the old rules haven't been reinstated.
   Lithuania may yet rediscover that what it thought to be no leash
was really just a long one.

   The News and Courier, Charleston, S.C., on Lithuania:
   Much as (Mikhail) Gorbachev would hate to admit it, Lithuania's
secession has been a boon to Moscow because it helps deflect
growing unrest elsewhere in the USSR with the abject failure of
perestroika to resuscitate the Soviet economy.
   There is nothing like an affront to national honor to take
people's minds off empty store shelves. It is a tactic that has
been used successfully throughout Soviet history to rally the
disaffected populace round the Kremlin.
   As Moscow and Vilnius jockey for position at the bargaining
table, the silence from Washington is deafening.
   Surely Lithuania's bid for independence did not catch the Bush
administration by surprise. (Lithuania President Vytautas)
Landbergis already has issued a respectful petition to the United
States and the other democracies for recognition, yet President
George Bush so far has failed to respond, at least publicly.
   No doubt the telephone lines between the White House, the
Kremlin and Vilnius have seen some heavy traffic recently. What was
said? Moreover, where does President Bush stand?
   Lithuania wants to know. We want to know.

   Zimbabweans voted today in national
elections that could give President Robert Mugabe's party control
of every seat in Parliament and the opportunity to legislate
one-party rule.
   Mugabe has vowed to change Zimbabwe's Constitution and institute
one-party rule if his Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic
Front) captures all of Parliament's 108 contested seats.
   Before the election, Mugabe's party held 106 seats, but a
unanimous vote is required to change the constitution.
   Half of Zimbabwe's 9 million people are registered to vote in
the two-day presidential and parliamentary elections, the second
since Mugabe led the white-ruled British colony to independence a
decade ago.
   ``I feel quite confident we will win all the seats,'' Mugabe
said in a interview with The Associated Press today.
   Seven parties are contesting the elections, but only the
Zimbabwe Unity Movement is viewed as having a chance to block
Mugabe's often-stated plan of imposing one-party rule.
   The Zimbabwe Unity Movement is led by one of Parliament's two
opposition legislators, Edgar Tekere, and has pledged to block the
constitutional change and fight government corruption if elected.
   Tekere, 52, is also running as the first candidate to challenge
Mugabe for the presidency since independence 10 years ago.
   Tekere was a co-founder of the ruling party in 1963, but he was
dismissed from the party in 1988 after accusing top leaders of
corruption.
   Parliament has 150 seats, but twelve have been granted to the
governing party as there were no challengers, and 30 others are
reserved for tribal chiefs, provincial governors and presidential
nominees, all of whom are considered Mugabe supporters.
   In repeated interviews Tekere has said that his party can win
several seats provided the elections are not rigged.
   Election results are not expected to be announced until Friday
night, polling officials said.

   The News-Leader, Springfield, Mo., on the census:
   The Census Bureau ... is mailing questionnaires to American
households in its decennial head-counting chore.
   But when President Bush issues a proclamation asking us to
TRUTHFULLY answer all census queries, the temptation is to ask:
Where was George...
   When the Reagan-Bush administration coined the euphemism
``disinformation'' to explain lying in connection with foreign
policy? When Bush and Congress conspired in their own version of
Reagan's Voodoo Economics by using Social Security, airport and

   The Hudson Dispatch, Union City, N.J., on Poindexter-Reagan:
   There is something truly painful about watching a former
president act like a petulant teen-ager with a diary.
   And it's even worse when a federal judge condones and
legitimizes such behavior.
   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene has ruled that former
President Reagan does not have to produce diary entries he made
while in office.
   The judge is presiding over the Iran-Contra trial of John M.
Poindexter, Reagan's former national security adviser facing five
felony counts.
   Greene said the three dozen diary entries ... Poindexter wanted
to use in his defense were not ``essential.''
   Regardless of the precedent, Reagan's testimony was long overdue
given the convoluted history of the Iran-Contra inquiry.
   Central to Poindexter's defense are his statements that he did
what he did on Reagan's behalf.
   Reagan and the Bush administration fought ... Poindexter's
subpoena on the grounds of executive privilege and by arguing that
personal presidential papers should remain shielded.
   Rather than fighting to keep his written records of the
Iran-Contra affair secret, Reagan should do everything in his power
to clear up the mystery once and for all.

   Hobbs (N.M.) Daily News-Sun on voter registration:
   The United States has one of the lowest voter turnouts in its
democratic elections of any Western nation; but that dismal
situation may be about to change.
   Despite White House opposition, the House of Representatives has
approved the so called ``motor voter'' bill that reduces barriers
to voter registration. The bill allows voters to register by mail,
at government offices or when they renew their driver's licenses.
   This measure also makes it easier to purge those who have died
or moved and imposes stiffer penalties for threatening voters or
for voter fraud. Similar legislation is pending in the Senate.
   The voter registration bill is in trouble because some
Republicans in Congress see increased participation as a threat.
While they complain publicly about potential fraud and cost, the
real fear seems to be that more Democrats than GOP voters will sign
up under the loosened rules.
   The proposed voter registration bill will do a lot more to
strengthen citizenship and American democracy than it can possibly
do to hurt them.

   San Antonio Express-News on polluting the seas:
   If you missed the reports that the Gulf of Mexico is becoming an
international sewer, or doubt the extent of the pollution of the
world's open seas, two recent studies may persuade you.
   A graphic U.N. report ... says sewage dumped at sea or into the
seas poses a significant health risk to seafood lovers and swimmers
who can pick up bacteria and viruses.
   And the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, issued a report
... that supports a Texas-sought special designation from the
International Maritime Organization to strictly limit dumping from
ships into the Gulf of Mexico. ...
   The reports make common sense. From the first ships that plied
the seas to the supertankers of today, mariners have used the seas
as their private sewers.
   The Gulf and coastal areas are worst-case examples of what might
eventually happen everywhere if international laws aren't toughened
and if polluters aren't clobbered for their idiotic and dangerous
bad habits.

   Three white teen-agers taunted a black youth
with a racial slur in the stairwell of a public high school, then
shot and slightly wounded him, police said.
   The shooting Tuesday took place in the Bensonhurst area of
Brooklyn, where another black teen-ager, 16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins,
was fatally shot during a confrontation with a group of young white
men last summer. Eight white youths are charged with murder in that
case.
   The 14-year-old victim Tuesday was taken to Coney Island
Hospital for treatment of a gunshot wound to the right wrist, said
a police spokesman, Detective Joseph McConville. The boy's name was
not released.
   By this morning, no arrest had been made, said a police
spokeswoman, Sgt. Mary Wrensen.
   The youths involved in the shooting had clashed with another
black teen-ager last month and the 14-year-old had tried to act as
a peacemaker in that dispute, McConville said.
   The violence Tuesday in New Utrecht High School occurred as the
14-year-old passed the three whites in a basement stairwell, and
one of them said, ``What are you looking at, nigger?''
   The black teen-ager told police he replied, ``If I were looking
at you, I'd tell you,'' McConville said.
   One of the white youths then shot the boy. Police found a shell
at the shooting scene, but did not say what kind of gun was used.

   Lithuanian police today defied Kremlin
orders to surrender shotguns and rifles turned in by citizens, but
Soviet authorities warned that they will restore ``law and order''
in the Baltic republic.
   In Moscow, the commander of Soviet paratroopers complained of
increasing attacks on soldiers in Lithuania, which declared its
independence from Moscow on March 11.
   Soviet paratroopers guarded the republic's Communist Party
headquarters for a second day, but removed their riot gear and no
longer carried automatic rifles.
   On Tuesday, Soviet troops seized the headquarters and
apprehended deserters in raids on two hospitals in the first Soviet
use of force of the confrontation that began when Lithuania
declared itself independent.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis condemned the actions
and again urged Western nations to speak out against Moscow. ``Is
the West willing to sell Lithuania to the Soviet Union again?'' he
said Tuesday.
   In Washington, Bush administration officials refused to
criticize the Soviet military's use of force on Tuesday. ``We
simply don't feel inflammatory language is helpful,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev discussed Lithuania in a
telephone conversation today with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
of Britain, the official Soviet news agency Tass said.
   ``Replying to Mrs. Thatcher's question, Gorbachev described
developments in Lithuania, which have emerged as a result of the
violation of the Soviet Constitution,'' the news agency said.
   Vilnius was calm overnight, with no reports of violence or of
Soviet soldiers taking over any more buildings.
   Lithuanians defied Soviet orders to turn over hunting rifles and
shotguns. Lithuanian Interior Ministry spokesman Yaroslav
Prokopovich said only about 1,000 weapons have been given to
police, but the police were not turning them over to the Red Army.
Authorities estimate there are 30,000 weapons in private hands.
   Police Capt. Jonas Dervinis said: ``Lithuania has its own
constitution, and we are working to enforce the law of Lithuania.''
   He said he did not know if Interior Ministry officials from
Moscow would attempt to enforce Gorbachev's order a week ago that
authorities confiscate any weapons not turned in voluntarily in
seven days.
   In Moscow, the Defense Ministry issued a statement saying the
orders issued by Gorbachev and the Soviet Parliament remain in
effect. ``No one should have any doubt have any doubt that law and
order will be restored on Lithuanian territory.''
   The statement accused Lithuania's government of giving
Lithuanian deserters from the Red Army separate passports and
sheltering them from Soviet authorities as part of an anti-army
propaganda campaign.
   The nationalists ``support illegal, anti-constitutional
activities of the Lithuanian government focused on the republic's
secession from the U.S.S.R.,'' said the military statement from
Moscow, reported by newspapers today.
   ``The republic's Interior Ministry organs refuse to take steps
to detain them and bring them back to their army units,'' it said.
   ``The deserters find shelter in Catholic churches, hospitals and
within the grounds of state institutions,'' the statement said.
``All attempts by army representatives to resolve the problem
through a dialogue with the Lithuanian government have been
fruitless.''
   Landsbergis on Tuesday condemned the capture of the deserters,
but said the republic will respond with ``moral strength'' rather
than violence.
   ``The government of Lithuania demands the return of its
kidnapped citizens,'' Landsbergis said in a letter sent to
Gorbachev.
   In a letter to Gorbachev, Landsbergis said the army actions
likely presaged further violence.
   ``You can see for yourself there is no violence, except for
incidents created by the army,'' he said. ``We can see how they are
going to great lengths to create the image that in the Baltics, and
in Lithuania in particular, there is instability.''
   At a news conference Tuesday in Warsaw, Poland, senior Soviet
diplomats said Lithuania's independence drive could lead to
destabilization of Europe and the rest of the world, but did not
elaborate.
   A declaration read at the briefing said ``the aspirations of the
Lithuanian leadership to speedily separate from the other nations
appear unjustified and let's say frankly dangerous.''
   In his letter to Gorbachev, Landsbergis said: ``Lithuania is an
unarmed, peaceful state and the only way it can resist the
aggressor is by moral strength and by not using armed resistance to
violence.''
   ``The government of Lithuania demands the return of its
kidnapped citizens,'' he told the Soviet president, and demanded
that ``negotiations with the government of the U.S.S.R. be held in
neutral territory.''
   Washington and other foreign governments urged restraint from
Moscow but avoided attacking Gorbachev, who by fostering greater
democracy has allowed independence movements to take hold in
several republics.
   Gorbachev is also trying to implement market-oriented reforms
that would nurse a badly crippled economy to health.
   Tass said Soviet soldiers seized 23 Lithuanian deserters in the
pre-dawn raids. A Lithuanian diplomat in Rome today said at least
38 deserters were seized. Witnesses said some deserters were beaten
as they were taken from a psychiatric hospital in Vilnius. A trail
of blood led down the steps and out the front door of the hospital.
   Gorbachev has called Lithuania's independence declaration
invalid and last week ordered Lithuanians to turn in their weapons
and stop signing up with a volunteer militia. But the Lithuanians
have not backed down.
   The Soviet leader had promised not to use force unless lives
were endangered in the Baltic republic, which the Soviet Union
forcibly annexed along with Latvia and Estonia in 1940. But
military authorities had warned they would seize deserters who did
not return voluntarily by last Saturday.

   The United States illegally discriminates
against refugees from Guatemala, Haiti and El Salvador who have
``reasonable fears for their lives,'' Amnesty International charged
today.
   The organization, which monitors human rights violations, said
government bias against asylum-seekers from particular countries
``appears to be a worldwide pattern.''
   It said Congress, however, passed a refugee act in 1980
requiring U.S. officials to use a single standard regardless of the
applicant's nationality, ideology or immigration status.
   Despite this, Amnesty International said, only 2.5 percent of
Salvadorans and 2 percent of Guatemalans and Haitians seeking
asylum between 1983 and 1989 were successful.
   The organization said government records show that people of
other nationalities were granted asylum at a rate of more than 36
percent.
   In a 29-page report, Amnesty International said it had
``communicated its concerns for many years'' to the State
Department, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other
officials of the Justice Department.
   ``No substantiative response has been received to date, and
people with reasonable fears for their lives continue to be denied
protection,'' the organization said.
   A Justice Department spokesman, Duke Austin, commented, ``Can it
be established that the United States is in fact returning people
to their native homelands and they are subsequently being
persecuted?. If that is the case, then we are violating the intent
of the law. I don't know of a single case that that has ever been
established in El Salvador or in Haiti. Not one.''
   Randy L. Levine, a New York attorney who was ranking associate
deputy attorney general from 1986 to 1988, said, ``In my
experience, most of the refugees from Guatemala and El Salvador
would not qualify for asylum because they do not have a
well-founded fear of persecution. Most of them are economic
refugees.''
   Nathan Kingsley, public affairs officer for the State
Department's Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, which
advises the Immigration and Natural Service on asylum matters, said
he had not seen the report.
   Amnesty International said U.S. authorities have justified
denial of asylum applications from Guatemala on the basis of
changes in the Guatemalan government.
   But it said rights abuses in the Central American country have
continued despite the government changes and the number of reported
cases has increased since 1988.
   In fiscal year 1989, only 67 of 3,325 Guatemalans whose cases
were decided by district directors of the immigration service were
granted asylum, an approval rate of 1.9 percent. It said the
overall rate of approval was 14 percent.
   The human rights organization said the U.S. policy of using the
Coast Guard to interdict Haitian refugees ``frustrates the intent
of the 1980 Refugee Act by subjecting this group of people to an
asylum process, conducted at sea, which appears to be thoroughly
inadequate.''
   It said fewer than 10 of more than 20,000 Haitians interviewed
at sea since 1981 have been permitted into the United States to
claim asylum.
   Amnesty said the INS denied 13,861 applications for asylum from
Salvadorans in 1989, while granting 337.

   Indian border guards shot and killed two
Pakistani ``intruders'' Wednesday after about 100 people crossed
into India's Jammu-Kashmir state from Pakistan, government
officials said.
   In New Delhi, a government spokesman told Pakistan the crossing
``can have tragic consequences.'' The spokesman, who cannot be
identified under briefing regulations, did not elaborate.
   Officials in Srinagar, Kashmir's main city and the center of a
Moslem separatist campaign, said 100 Pakistani civilians shouting
anti-Indian slogans headed into India from Pakistan.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
people were warned to turn back. When they ignored the warning and
came about 200 yards inside Indian territory, border guards opened
fire and killed two people, the officials said.
   The border incident was the fourth since Moslem militants
intensified their secessionist campaign in Indian-governed Kashmir
in January.
   The most serious incident occurred Feb. 5 when about 4,000
Pakistani civilians attempted to cross the border to support their
Moslem brethren in Kashmir. Indian troops opened fire and killed at
least four people.
   At least 201 people have died in Moslem separatist violence in
Kashmir since the secessionist campaign flared Jan. 20.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only Moslem-dominated state in India, which
is mostly Hindu.
   Pakistan also claims the state because of its predominantly
Moslem population and has twice gone to war with India over the
region. Pakistan now controls the western part of the state, while
the larger portion is governed by India.

   The government declared war on tobacco Wednesday,
approving a draft law banning all cigarette advertising and
announcing a 15 percent increase in the price of tobacco products
beginning next year.
   In addition, advertisements of nearly all alcoholic beverages
will be banned except in the print media.
   The measure will be submitted to Parliament during its spring
session, said government spokesman Louis Le Pensec. If approved,
the bans will be implemented progressively over a three-year period.
   Most cigarettes now cost between 95 cents and $1.75. The
government receives about 75 percent of the revenue from tobacco
sales.
   Le Pensec said tobacco and alcohol are responsible for 20
percent of the deaths in France. ``You can never be too tough in
preventing the self-destruction of our citizens,'' he quoted
President Francois Mitterrand as telling the Cabinet.

   Turkey on Wednesday ordered the

the Greek government said.
   Greece issued the protest Monday, saying the sandbag structure

an extension of the Turkish mainland. The two countries share
sovereignty of the 25-acre island.
   Greek government spokesman Prokopis Pavlopoulos said Turkey's

ambassador the sandbags would be removed immediately.
   Celem said Turkish villagers, and not officials, were
responsible for building the dam, Pavlopoulos added. Turkey also
denied that soldiers had been stationed on the island, he said.
   The two countries agreed Wednesday to hold technical level talks
to prevent any similar border problems in the future.

   A 1971 letter in which John E. List

pastor, the Rev. Eugene A. Rehwinkel.
   List also said that he was concerned about his 16-year-old
daughter Patricia, who he said was ``so determined to get into
acting I was also fearful as to what this might do to her
continuing to be a Christian.''
   Judge William L'E. Wertheimer released the letter, rejecting
defense arguments that it should be considered confidential because
of the ``priest-penitent'' privilege.
   List is accused of killing his wife, Helen, their three children
and his mother on Nov. 9, 1971 in their Westfield home.
   After the slayings, List lived nearly 18 years under an assumed
name in Colorado and Virginia, prosecutors said. He was arrested in
Richmond, Va., in June after a tipster phoned a nationally
broadcast anti-crime TV show.
   The letter gave a methodical explanation of why List felt
compelled to kill his family. Authorities said List shot dead his
wife and mother and then killed Patricia and his sons John Jr. and
Frederick.
   ``It may seem cowardly to have only shot from behind but I
didn't want any of them to know even at the last second that I had
to do this to them,'' he wrote. ``P.S. mother is in the hallway in
the attic _ 3rd floor. She was too heavy to move.
   ``John got hurt more because he seemed to struggle longer. The
rest were immediately out of pain,'' he wrote.
   Wertheimer allowed the letter to be used because of its
contents, the way it was left for the pastor, and because List
never sought confidentiality.
   Police found the letter in an unsealed envelope with the name of
List's pastor, the Rev. Eugene A. Rehwinkel, written on it. The
envelope was in a locked filing cabinet.

   Riot police arrested 27 women
Wednesday who were protesting the jailing of university professors
and fired a stun grenade and tear gas to disperse bystanders who
were supporting the protesters.
   ``Houphouet, thief! Houphouet, resign! Houphouet, go!'' the
nearly 300 bystanders chanted. They were referring to President
Felix Houphouet-Boigny.
   For an hour after the arrests, riot police waving batons charged
the bystanders, who repeatedly regrouped and resumed chanting at
different street corners.
   The women marched down the central Boulevard de la Republique
shouting, ``Free our husbands! Free our parents! Let them go!''
Most of them were wives or daughters of 127 university professors,
who were jailed Monday after defying a ban on protests and meetings.
   Meanwhile, the government threatened to fire hundreds of
striking government medical workers if they did not return to work.
   ``All those who are not at their work posts this Wednesday,
March 28, 1990, will be dismissed and replaced,'' a government
statement said.
   ``We refuse to respond to the government order,'' said an
official of the National Union of Senior Health Officers, who asked
that he not be named.
   The medical workers and the university professors were
protesting austerity measures that include salary cuts of up to 17
percent to save this once-prosperous West African nation from
bankruptcy.
   Houphouet-Boigny blames the crisis on the slumping prices of
cocoa, Ivory Coast's main export.
   But his critics allege government officials have stolen millions
of dollars from state coffers.
   Houphouet-Boigny has ruled Ivory Coast as a one-party state
since its independence from France in 1960.

   The Keene (N.H.) Sentinel on the cost of sugar:
   Why, one might wonder, would anyone spend good money to put an
ad on TV _ week after week, year after year _ telling us how cheap
sugar is?
   The answer ... is that it isn't true.
   Political action committees affiliated with sugar producers hand
out about $1 million each election year to sweet-toothed
congressmen on key committees. No connection, of course, but
Congress has imposed very strict quotas on sugar imports, the kinds
of quotas American trade representatives complain loudly about when
the Japanese put them on beef, citrus fruit and rice. ...
   According to Citizens for a Sound Economy, a free-trade lobby,
Americans pay the highest price for sugar of any western nation _
three times the average of what the rest of the world pays. A
Department of Commerce study shows that sugar quotas cost American
consumers ... $3 billion a year.
   The quotas also keep the prices of artificial sweeteners and
other sweeteners such as corn syrup about $2 billion a year higher
than would otherwise be the case, according to a Congressional
Research Service report. And the quotas hurt Third-World sugar
producing countries, many of which receive U.S. economic aid that
wouldn't be necessary if they could sell us their sugar.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on censorship of art:
   The Bush administration did credit to itself last week by
striking a blow against government censorship.
   Ignoring the demands of Sen. Jesse Helms and other right-wing
activists, the administration told Congress it opposed legislation
to control the content of art supported with federal funds.
   Fine. Whether or not the federal government should be
subsidizing art projects in the first place is open to argument.
But once subsidies are authorized, the government ought not to get
into the business of dictating the specifics of artistic output.
   To place restrictions on the content and form of art to be
supported amounts to government censorship.

   The Providence (R.I.) Sunday Journal on art thievery:
   (The) ... theft from Boston's Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum is
sad indeed. ... We hope the museum will bolster its security to
protect the master pieces that remain. ...
   Art thievery will grow more brazen as long as the market value
of art escalates. But if people could purchase a copy of a painting
as easily as they can buy a book or a musical recording, this crime
might decline. ...
   (W)e recently viewed copies of paintings by Claude Monet. ...
They were ``painted'' by computer. Such copies, reproducing even
the texture of brush strokes, are quite expensive, but prices could
decline if consumer demand creates a lucrative market.
   This could revolutionize the art world: Aside from making
virtual duplicates of art available to hang in the average
aesthete's living room, this process could moderate the value of
original works.

   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on the broccoli brouhaha:
   A reporter in our newsroom the other day asked: Why all this
fuss over something as insignificant as broccoli?
   The reason, we suspect, is this: Broccoli is something every
American can understand. We either like it or we don't like it.
It's, ugh, something we can get our teeth into. Therefore, every
one of us has an opinion about broccoli. We understand it. We can
talk it over and argue about it at the family dinner table.
   But consider really weighty problems of the nation, like the
multi-billion-dollar federal savings and loan bailout. That
financial mess probably is the worst misuse, abuse and waste of
taxpayer money in U.S. history. It will cost $200 billion, maybe
$300 billion to fix it.
   In other countries, governments would fall over such a scandal.
Congressmen and senators should be voted out of office because of
it. Here's a subject taxpayers really ought to be upset about, not
broccoli.
   But the fact is, the savings and loan controversy is so complex,
it came about because of so many complicated reasons _ including
bad judgment by Congress _ the American people don't really
understand the high cost or know where to place the blame.
   It's a lot easier, and more comforting to argue about broccoli.

   A Chicago-based manufacturer voluntarily
recalled 1,500 pull toys Wednesday because they may break apart,
leaving sharp edges or small parts that could injure or choke young
children, the government said.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Sandberg
Manufacturing Co. is recalling 1,500 Caterpillar Pull Toys that
sold nationwide for children ages 1 to 3 from October 1988 to May
1989.
   The toys are made of green, orange, yellow, blue and red plastic
with two small balls on the end of two springs and a red pull
string attached to the head of the caterpillar.
   The toys ``may break apart during use producing small pieces of
plastic, some with sharp points,'' the commission said. ``The balls
on the ends of the antenna may also detach presenting a choking
hazard to young children.''
   Agency officials advise adults to take the toys away from young
children and return them to the store where purchased for a refund.

   After learning that he had AIDS, fashion
designer Halston moved to California, where he spent some of his
final days touring the majestic coast around Big Sur in his new,
jet-black Rolls-Royce.
   The designer, who transformed fashion in the 1970s, died Monday
night. His brother said Tuesday that Halston had asked that the
$300,000 Rolls be auctioned off, with the funds going to AIDS
research.
   Robert Frowick described his brother as intensely private, but
said the family wanted to hold a memorial service that would
accommodate Halston's many fans and friends. It will be held Friday
at San Francisco's Calvary Presbyterian Church.
   The 57-year-old designer died at Pacific Presbyterian Medical
Center, where he had been hospitalized with Kaposi's sarcoma since
December.
   ``We are all deeply saddened by Halston's death,'' said Ronald
Perelman, board chairman of Revlon Group Inc. in New York. ``He was
an American leader of design and style who helped to define his
entire era. He will be sorely missed.''
   Mr. Blackwell, the acerbic fashion designer known for his annual
worst-dressed celebrity list, lamented Halston's loss.
   ``Halston in the last several years has been conspicuously
absent from the scene. His death is a tragedy,'' Blackwell said
from his home in Los Angeles.
   Halston's first client was Fran Allison of ``Kukla, Fran and
Ollie.'' Within months he was creating hats for Kim Novak, Hedda
Hopper, Deborah Kerr and Shirley Booth.
   Known for his signature black and red attire, the Ultrasuede
shirtdress and the pillbox-style hat worn by Jacqueline Kennedy at
the 1961 presidential inauguration, Halston also designed clothes
for Lauren Bacall, Liza Minnelli, Carol Channing and Bianca Jagger.
He opened his own couture house in 1968.
   Through his work he collected a star-studded circle of friends,
including artist Andy Warhol.
   Born Roy Halston Frowick, the son of an accountant and a
housewife, he took to fashion early on. At age 13, he made a red
hat and veil for his mother to wear on Easter. His brother, Robert,
said Halston always had an innate taste for clothes.
   He began working in Chicago, where he sold hats at the
Ambassador Hotel before moving to New York where he joined Bergdorf
Goodman in 1957.
   Halston quickly rose to fashion fame and fortune in the Big
Apple, earning two prestigious Coty awards for fashion.
   ``He was temperamental, spoiled, always threatening to quit,''
Andrew Goodman, Bergdorf's president, said in 1973. ``But we
indulged him because he was so talented.''
   His hallmark cardigan draped over the shoulders, slinky jerseys,
caftans and other designs swept the country, and he opened a
Madison Avenue boutique.
   But Halston's position at the pinnacle of the fashion industry
began to slip in 1973, when he signed a $16 million deal with
Norton Simon Inc. for his ready-to-wear line, his couture operation
and the Halston trademark.
   The agreement let Norton Simon use the Halston name for products
he didn't design.
   J.C. Penney Co. Inc. approached Norton Simon with the idea of a
line of inexpensive Halston clothes to be sold exclusively in the
low-price department stores, and Halston agreed. That deal was
signed in 1982.
   Shortly after that, Bergdorf Goodman announced it would no
longer sell Halston clothes because of the association with Penney.
Adding to the designer's woes, Norton Simon was acquired in a
takeover of the Esmark Inc. conglomerate by Beatrice Cos.
   Beatrice canceled Halston's limousines, dismissed staff and
dismantled his company.
   Revlon bought use of the Halston name in December 1986, although
the designer retained the right to also use it. Revlon used it on a
popular fragrance line.
   Diagnosed about a year ago as infected with HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, Halston moved to northern California to join family
members living in Santa Rosa.
   He is survived by two brothers and a sister.

   Once it was a wall; by Wednesday, it was a
memorial.
   Students at Roosevelt High School, who lost five classmates in
the Happy Land social club fire, covered a second-floor hallway
with flowers and scrawled goodbyes in a tribute to the dead youths.
   ``I wish you are all in HEAVEN. I'll meet you there, my friends!
I miss you,'' wrote one student at the school, which is attended by
about 140 youths of Honduran descent.
   ``Our family, our friends. We will never forget. May your souls
rest in peace,'' said another message.
   The remembrances came in English and Spanish; flowers, now
wilted, were stapled along the length of the 28-foot tribute.
Teachers joined students in sharing their grief over the loss of
people who two weeks earlier had partied with them at a high school
dance.
   ``Norman _ you were a wonderful student, a joy to have in
class,'' wrote one teacher. ``Always smiling, bright-eyed,
sensitive, respectful, kind, humorous, a wonderful son. I will
always keep you in my heart and pray for you.''
   Above the scores of names and messages was a computer-printed
sign flanked by bouquets of paper roses. ``In memory of Wendy,
Alba, Isabel, Norman, Ernesto,'' it simply said. All five died
early Sunday; the messages first appeared Monday morning.
   Norman Clark was the youngest of the five Roosevelt students
killed. He and three others attended the school this year. The
fifth, Ernesto Gamoneda, was in the class of '89.
   Wendy Manaiza, 18, planned to attend college following her
graduation this June. Alba Escuto went to the club with her
boyfriend, Juan Carlos Colon; her cousin, 17-year-old Isabel Lopez,
also was there.
   Funeral services for the five teen-agers were expected to begin
Thursday.
   ``They were beautiful kids,'' recalled the principal, Paul
Shapiro. ``The school is suffering together on this. This is not
business as usual. Business is not as usual.''
   Friends of the dead youths arrived at school Monday morning
badly shaken, some sobbing and screaming uncontrollably as they met
with counselors assigned to the school to help students through the
tragedy.
   More than 400 students came in to talk about the tragedy and its
effects on them. Part of the healing process was creation of the
memorial, counselors said.
   ``It was an ice-breaker in trying to get something positive out
of this,'' said Cecilio Rodriguez, a former Roosevelt teacher and
now a member of the Bronx high school crisis response team.
   ``Some of the Honduran kids, who spoke no English, asked how to
write `God bless you' or `We miss you' in English,'' he said.
``They wanted everybody to understand their message.''
   Students told the counselors their friends went to the Happy
Land after a party attended by many Roosevelt students; several who
stayed at the party felt guilty about surviving.
   ``They had to confront that: `I was with so and so two hours
before at the party.' It's mortality _ here today, gone tomorrow.
Kids that age think they're invincible,'' said Milta Vega, a drug
counselor at the school.
   The deaths were keenly felt at the school of 3,300 students, 60
percent of whom are Hispanic. Counselors said students of varying
ethnic backgrounds were brought together in mourning.
   ``It was almost beautiful to see the way they came together,''
Rodriguez said Tuesday afternoon. ``There was a good spiritual
energy generated by the end of the day.''
   The counselors, while pleased with the progress made so far, say
there's more work to be done at Roosevelt.
   ``These kids live in an area where there are 6,000 Hondurans
within 10 blocks,'' said Ms. Vega. ``They will pass by the club
every day on the way to school. It's really important to have a
crisis team here for them.''

   Customs officials said they foiled an attempt
today to smuggle 40 U.S.-made nuclear trigger components to Iraq
via London.
   They said five people were arrested, including an Iraqi who was
picked up at Heathrow Airport and is being expelled from Britain.
Earlier reports had said two Iraqis and up to five other people had
been taken into custody.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
devices arrived from the United States two days earlier and were
kept under surveillance until the alleged smugglers attempted to
put them on a scheduled Iraqi Airways flight to Baghdad.
   In Washington, a U.S. Customs Service spokesman, Ed Kittredge,
said the arrests resulted from an 18-month investigation by U.S.
and British customs officials. A sealed indictment has been
returned in the case in U.S. District Court in San Diego, he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``This issue raises
once again our concern for the nuclear proliferation in the Middle
East. It continues to pose a serious risk to U.S. interests and it
continues to exacerbate regional problems.'' He called on nuclear
suppliers ``to exercise special restraint in providing materials to
this region of the world, and we continue to urge that all states
adhere to the Non-Proliferation Treaty,'' including Iraq.
   The incident could further strain relations between Britain and
Iraq.
   Earlier this month, Britain recalled its ambassador from Baghdad
after the Iraqis hanged an Iranian-born journalist working for a
British newspaper. Iraq accused the journalist, Farzad Bazoft, of
spying.
   BBC-TV said customs officials, tipped off by their American
counterparts, removed the nuclear devices and substituted harmless
replacements, then waited for the packages to be collected from
their freight shed.
   It showed footage of the operation which it said was shot by an
NBC crew which had been following the investigation.
   The customs officials said the items were capacitors, electrical
devices that form part of the detonation chain of a nuclear bomb.
   They said the detainees included three Britons and a Lebanese.
   The Home Office said the Iraqi was being deported because of
attempted breaches of British laws restricting the export of high
technology.
   A second detainee who was to have been expelled turned out to
have British citizenship, it said.
   Kittredge said Washington was limiting its comment on the
incident out of deference to the British government. ``They're
sensitive about Iraq and the number of British citizens there,'' he
said.
   
   Professor Paul Wilkinson, a Bradford University terrorism
expert, said: ``If they're trying to smuggle in these highly
sophisticated trigger devices, that means they're very serious
about making nuclear weapons and soon.''
   Tony Banks, a Middle East expert at the respected Jane's Defense
Weekly, said nuclear triggers are devices for initiating an
explosion in a nuclear weapon.
   ``This is a very, very high technology. There are only a very
few countries in the world capable of manufacturing this type of
technology and there is no other use for a nuclear triggering
device than to trigger a nuclear weapon,'' he said.
   The Foreign Office would not link the deportation to the
disclosure of the smuggling operation, and no government agency
would officially confirm that such an operation had been attempted.
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Iraqi Ambassador Azmi Shafiq
Al-Salihi was informed of the deportation by senior Foreign Office
official Roger Tomkys, who is responsible for Middle East affairs.
   It was not known whether Iraq has nuclear weapons capability,
but it has been developing a long-range missile judged by some
military analysts to be capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.
   In 1981 the Israeli air force bombed and destroyed a nuclear
reactor in Iraq which was nearing completion. Israel claimed the
reactor would give Iraq nuclear weapons capability.
   Iraq insisted the installation was for peaceful use.

   Rep. George Crockett, D-Mich., has decided to
retire after five terms in Congress, ending a career of public
service spanning more than 40 years, an aide says.
   Crockett, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on
Western Hemisphere Affairs, planned to announce his decision in a
floor speech later today, administrative assistant Joan Willoughby
said.
   ``It's a decision he's come to over the last couple of months,''
Ms. Willoughby said. ``He's 80 years old and he's worked for 68
years.''
   She said Crockett was not concerned about his chances for
winning a sixth term.
   A native of Jacksonville, Fla., Crockett earned his law degree
at the University of Michigan. He gained national attention in 1949
for his defense of 11 avowed New York communists charged with
subversion.
   He was elected to the Detroit Recorder's Court, which handles
the city's criminal cases, in 1966. His 12-year term on the bench
was steeped in controversy, capped by his release of more than 100
people arrested at a meeting of a black militant group in 1969.
   He was elected to Congress in 1980, replacing Rep. Charles
Diggs, who had been convicted in a kickback scandal.

<HEAD>Democrats Charge Pressler Violated Senate Rules, Federal Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., violated Senate
rules and federal law by using his staff to help an elderly woman
write a campaign-related letter to newspaper editors, Democrats
said Wednesday.
   The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee asked the Senate
Rules Committee in a letter Wednesday to tell Pressler ``that this
practice must be discontinued.''
   Pressler violated restrictions against members of Congress using
their official staff and mailing privileges for campaign business,
DSCC attorney Robert Bauer said at a news conference.
   ``He should not be mixing campaign and Senate business'' in his
Senate offices, Bauer said.
   The letter published earlier this month in the Sioux Falls
Argus-Leader and two other South Dakota newspapers complained that
the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare had
endorsed Democratic Senate candidate Ted Muenster without polling
its members.
   The letter writer, Irene McLaughlin, 69, of Sioux Falls, said
she had arthritis and asked Pressler's Sioux Falls office to type
the letter for her.
   ``If it is a mistake to respond to a constituent's request to
assist someone with arthritis in typing a letter, that is exactly
what we did,'' said Kevin Schieffer, the senator's chief of staff.
   ``If it is wrong we will correct it, as we always do.''
   Schieffer wrote the Senate Ethics Committee on Monday seeking
advice on whether it was proper for Pressler's staff to have
prepared the letter.
   However, Schieffer's request does not mention the nature of the
letter -- only that the writer was ``supportive of Senator
Pressler'' and angry about a newspaper article.
   Schieffer said McLaughlin dictated the letter to a Pressler
aide, who typed up the letter on his own time. Schieffer said he
did not know who paid for the stamps that were used to mail the
letter or when and where the aide typed it.
   ``They were all her words. She dictated. It was her idea. It was
her initiative,'' Schieffer said.
   The Democrats' complaint was based on an article in the Sioux
Falls newspaper that disclosed that Pressler's staff helped prepare
the letter. McLaughlin had complained to the Argus-Leader that her
last name was listed incorrectly, the newspaper said.
   Bauer said Wednesday that Pressler had probably used his staff
to prepare similar letters to the editor through other people.
   However, Bauer acknowledged his evidence consisted of copies of
letters about the Senate race, written by the same people, that
appeared in multiple South Dakota newspapers.
   ``In my experience this is not likely to be an undirected
activity,'' Bauer said.
   Spokesmen for both Pressler and Muenster have acknowledged that
they advise supporters on what to write to newspapers. Pressler has
used his campaign staff to solicit supporters to write letters to
the editor, Schieffer said.

   Rival Zulu factions battled
with guns, clubs and knives Wednesday in Natal province, setting
scores of homes on fire and forcing hundreds of villagers to flee
into the countryside.
   Soldiers and police patrolled Natal in an effort to quell the
violence, which broke out Tuesday and has killed at least two
people.
   ``The whole so-called `Valley of Death' is covered with blue
smoke. I saw 120 homes burning at the same time in a radius of (15
miles),'' said journalist Khaba Mkhize after flying over the
Edendale Valley near the provincial capital of Pietermaritzburg.
   From 1,000 feet up, Mkhize saw crowds of more than 1,000
gathering in streets and bodies lying in fields.
   Police reported two deaths and 25 injuries since Tuesday but
expected the figures would rise. Local reporters, who did not want
to be named, said up to 14 people had been killed.
   As night fell, officials and monitors reported 1,500 people
fleeing the townships with their belongings loaded onto trucks.
   Army units and extra police were deployed after some 2,000 Zulus
supporting the Inkatha party went on rampage with guns and knives
against supporters of the rival United Democratic Front. Observers
and police say the violence was sparked by the stoning of Inkatha
buses that drove through UDF areas after a rally Sunday.
   Inkatha is fighting the UDF for control of the region. Both
groups oppose apartheid, South Africa's system of racial
segregation. However, Inkatha supports separate states for
different tribes or ethnic groups, while the UDF wants a black
majority government ruling all of South Africa.
   Police said officers used shotguns and tear gas to disperse mobs
attacking and burning houses. Maj. Piet Kitching said the army
would patrol all night along major routes in the 120-square-mile
area where fighting was reported.
   ``It almost looks as though the whole area is burning,'' said
Kitching.
   ``In a field, on one side of a hill a battle was raging, we
could hear the guns,'' said Peter Kerchhoff, of a Pietermaritzburg
peace group. ``On the other side, we just heard the weapons being
fired amongst the trees. Masses of people were watching the
confrontations and masses of people were ... trying to go to the
rescue of other people in conflict on the hill.''
   Kerchhoff said dirt roads leading to townships were blockaded
with tree trunks, boulders, rubbish and burning tires. He said
people were fleeing Caluza township, where much of the fighting was
centered. Houses were burning in several townships, and many of
those fleeing carried with them pieces of furniture, he said.
   As his group drove through the crowds taking four injured to the
hospital, Kerchhoff said, ``People were saying, `Please, we need
guns.'''
   Several residents and local journalists said they saw some
police giving Inkatha fighters ammunition, supporting them in the
battles, and refusing to confiscate their weapons. Township
residents welcomed the army's arrival, said Mkhize, the journalist.
   A 13-year-old boy in a house in Caluza said over the telephone:
``The police is coming and shoot the people. A helicopter is up
there.''
   The boy, who could not be identified because of safety concerns,
said his father had left the house ``because of the war'' and ``I
am running away now.''
   Kerchhoff said he saw young and old men fighting on a distant
hilltop with sticks, clubs and machete-like knives called pangas.
Among the Inkatha fighters, Kerchhoff said he saw men in blue
uniforms, but he could not be sure they were police.
   One of the injured he transported to a hospital claimed to have
been shot in the shoulder by police officer, Kerchhoff said.
   Police did not respond to the charges, but photographers took
pictures of white security policemen, riot squad officers and local
black police in the company of armed Inkatha men near Caluza.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in black factional fighting
in recent weeks in Natal. Nearly 4,000 have died since 1987 as the
Inkatha movement and UDF fight for control of the region.
   The groups have ignored repeated appeals from Nelson Mandela and
other black leaders to end the fighting.

   The Bush administration, while avoiding
inflammatory public statements, is making its opposition to the use
of force in Lithuania known to Moscow ``in the strongest fashion,''
the White House said today.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said U.S. communications
with Moscow over the tense situation in the rebellious Baltic
republic have included private diplomatic cable messages.
   ``The fact that we have made that position known to them by
almost every recognized channel _ which is to say diplomatic and
direct conversations between (Secretary of State James A.) Baker
and (Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.) Shevardnadze as well as
cable messages to the Soviet Union _ indicates that we have
registered our position in the strongest fashion,'' Fitzwater said.
   Bush found himself confronted in the White House today by
criticism from some Republican lawmakers that his policy on
Lithuania wasn't aggressive enough. But he argued forcefully for
his go-slow approach, participants at a White House GOP leadership
meeting said.
   ``We had a very spirited exchange and he won,'' said Rep. Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., assistant House Republican leader.
   Gingrich said he was one of several GOP leaders who voiced
concern to the president over his cautious policy in reacting to
Soviet moves to block Lithuania's seccession.
   The lawmaker, speaking to reporters on the White House driveway,
said he began the meeting ``more aggressive, more positive than I
came out.''
   But Gingrich said he was persuaded that any overt U.S. action _
such as formal recognition of Lithuania _ would trigger the
immediate use of force against Lithuania by the Soviet army.
   Gingrich said Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was under
enormous pressure, including from the Soviet military, to use force
in Lithuania.
   ``We don't gain anything by forcing a confrontation,'' Gingrich
said.
   The lawmaker said he ``was educated'' by today's White House
session.
   ``I think it is clear there are extraordinary pressures on both
sides, certainly on Lithuanians and on the Soviet Union. And it's
in our interest to promote a peaceful dialogue,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater and other officials are avoiding ``inflammatory
language'' in public comments on the Soviet use of force in
Lithuania but say they are keeping diplomatic channels open with
the Soviets.
   Some officials have said private messages to Moscow are much
stronger than the public statements.
   ``We are letting them know that if they really crack down, we
will react, and not just the administration. Congress could take
steps, and we might not be able to control the reaction,'' said one
administration source who requested anonymity.
   One senior administration official suggested Baker had sent a
cable Tuesday to Shevardnadze that dealt with U.S. concerns over
Lithuania in much sharper language than contained in the White
House statement.
   Later, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler denied
that Baker had sent a message. She called that report erroneous.
   And Fitzwater said he did not think such a cable had been sent
on Tuesday, that there may have been confusion with ``an earlier
cable over the weekend.''
   Still, the spokesman said, ``I think that the Soviet Union is
certainly aware of our position.''
   Soviet officials said they expected the Lithuanian controversy
to be high on the agenda when Shevardnadze visits Washington early
next month.
   The U.S. government has never acknowledged the Soviet annexation
of Lithuania and its sister republics of Latvia and Estonia during
World War II. Latvia and Estonia are moving more slowly toward
independence.
   Lithuania declared independence on March 11, and since then the
Soviet military has increased pressure on the republic.
   Soviet soldiers jeopardized the improvement of U.S.-Soviet
relations by breaking into two hospitals in Lithuania to detain
Lithuanian deserters from the Soviet Army.
   Possible U.S. responses include postponing a summit scheduled
for June or delaying treaties on nuclear, chemical and conventional
arms, said two well-placed sources, who also requested anonymity.
   ``We don't want to do something that would punish us as much as
the Russians,'' said one source. A likely first step would be
suspension of trade talks designed to give the Soviet Union most
favored nation status in commerce with the United States.
   Gorbachev has shunned direct public comment on Lithuania,
letting Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov and other generals issue
warnings, said a senior American intelligence analyst.
   The Soviet constitution gives the 15 republics the right to
secede, but none has tried it before.
   Gorbachev may be avoiding public comment on Lithuania, allowing
his generals to make threats and use limited force, so that he can
later disown the policy, sources suggested.
   Gorbachev met Monday with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and
Kennedy later quoted him as saying the Kremlin would not use force
in Lithuania ``unless lives were threatened.''
   A senior Soviet diplomat in Washington told a news conference
Tuesday that Lithuania likely would be allowed to secede, but not
immediately.
   The central government wants the Lithuanians to hold a
referendum on secession and open negotiations with Moscow on issues
including the rights of non-Lithuanians in the republic, Soviet
military bases there, and compensation for major enterprises built
there by the central government, said Sergei Chetverikov, the No. 3
man at the Soviet embassy.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Art Exhibit Opens at Parliament</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-South Africa, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An international anti-apartheid art exhibition
opened in a Parliament building Wednesday to build awareness among
Japanese lawmakers of South Africa's policy of racial segregation.
   The event, ``Apartheid Non,'' features 154 paintings, sculptures
and posters by 81 artists from 34 countries. Many works have
political and anti-apartheid themes. Some depict scenes of life in
South Africa.
   The three-day display was organized by the Parliamentarians'
Anti-Apartheid League, a 50-member group led by Socialist lawmaker
Kanji Kawasaki.
   The exhibition, which arrived in Japan in June 1988, has visited
more than 180 places throughout the nation, according to Atsuko
Hironaka, a spokeswoman for a group of citizens who organized the
tour.
   The exhibit has also gone to 10 other countries. It originated
in Paris in 1983.
   ``Japan will continue to urge the South African authorities to
make further efforts for a peaceful solution to apartheid,'' Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu said at the opening ceremony for the
exhibit. ``We strongly look forward to the establishment of a
democratic South Africa where there is no racial discrimination.''
   Socialist Party Chairwoman Takako Doi, also speaking at the
ceremony, called for more efforts by Japan to end apartheid, under
which South Africa's black majority has no voice in national
affairs.
   ``Our anti-apartheid measures have never been enough. We have to
work harder so that we won't be ashamed of not observing our
constitution, which urges us to gain an honorable place in the
world by fighting against dictatorship and oppression,'' she said.
   Japan came under international criticism in 1987 when it became
South Africa's largest trading partner. But in 1988 it fell behind
West Germany in total trade with South Africa. Figures for 1989
have not been released.
   Japanese sanctions against South Africa include a ban on direct
investment, limits on cultural, sports and tourism exchanges, and a
ban on sales of computers for police use.

   This was going to be a simple a story about
computer viruses until the hackers intruded, until the hackers
intruded, until the hackers intruded....
   You get the idea. There are a lot of problems facing the
nation's computers _ within and without.
   From big mainframes at universities and government installations
to the personal computer that keeps track of your household
finances, the equipment is vulnerable to a variety of intrusions by
pranksters, vandals and just plain thieves, say computer experts.
   But the industry is split over how to deal with the threat or
even what the threat is.
   Nearly all agree, however, with the assessment of Bill Murray,
an information system security expert with the accounting firm of
Ernst &amp; Young: ``if people become sufficiently fearful, they'll
stop using computers.''
   In 1989, computer software and related services were a $60
billion industry in the United States. Software are the sets of
instructions that tell computers what to do.
   Some experts believe the biggest threat comes from rogue
programs _ viruses, bombs and worms _ called ``malicious
software.'' They can cripple a personal computer or a network by
scrambling or deleting data or simply duplicating itself, like the
first paragraph of this story, eating up valuable storage space.
   News reports about these programs, like the Friday the 13th
virus that failed to materialize in large numbers last October,
have panicked many computer users.
   Other experts focus on the self-styled `catch-me-if-you-can'
hackers who make a game of out of invading the computer systems of
industry and government.
   Less than three months ago, a federal court jury in Syracuse,
N.Y. convicted a former graduate student of unleashing a computer
``worm'' program that disrupted a nationwide computer system,
Internet.
   Earlier this month, reports surfaced of a new intruder in the
same system, indicating that not every worm may have turned.
   ``What we have seen and can confirm is an intruder was making
persistent attempts to get into the Internet systems,'' said Terry
McGillen, a spokesman for the Software Engineering Institute, a
Defense Department-funded operation that oversees the Computer
Emergency Response Team, or CERT.
   ``We know of several systems that have been broken into and
several more attempts'' on March 15 and 16, said McGillen. However,
he declined to say where the intrusions occurred in the massive
Internet system which is linked to 200,000 computer terminals
including ones at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   McGillen said it was CERT policy, not to protect the innocent _
or even the guilty _ but to encourage victims to share their
experiences with intruders.
   Such information is often difficult, if not impossible, to come
by said several computer experts.
   ``As far as computer crime is concerned, I can assure you there
are no valid numbers,'' said Donn B. Parker, a computer security
expert at SRI International, a research center in Menlo Park, Calif.
   The reason, he added ``is because the victims do all they can to
avoid reporting it.''
   Large corporations, universities and government agencies, out of
embarassment or fear of encouraging further tampering, don't like
to admit publicly they've been hit by a virus or hacker, agreed
Stuart Katzke, of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, a federal agency in Gaithersburg, Md.
   ``That's been a problem with the computer security area for a
long time, people choose to cover up incidents and not report
them,'' added Katzke, chief of NIST's division of computer security.
   NIST doesn't compile listings of computer security problems,
neither does CERT.
   Last month Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said ``increasingly,
computers are being found in illegal activities of drug networks.''
But the FBI lacks hard data on software crime because computers are
often perceived as a tool in committing other crimes such as fraud
and theft, said an FBI spokeswoman in Washington.
   ``In relation to other crimes, it's more a medium than the
actual culprit,'' explained Kelley Cibalus, the spokeswoman.
   The lack of centralized information about computer security was
``something we heard at the hearings'' conducted last fall by a
subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, said Eric Hauser, an
aide to Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., the subcommittee's chairman.
   Legislation to restrict computer viruses is pending in various
forms before the criminal justice subcommittee in the House and is
being explored on the Senate side.
   While the debate rages over whether hackers or viruses are the
main threat to computer security, experts agree that attitudes have
to change about interfering with someone else's equipment _ for
whatever reason.
   ``One thing being discussed in the industry,'' said NIST's
Dennis Steinauer, ``is what should we do to instill an updated
sense of ethics. Computer and network technology is of value to us
all, but tampering undermines the technology for all of us because
it usually means restrictions are placed on it.''

   Richard Nixon says that a most unfortunate
disclosure during Watergate was that he used foul language in the
Oval Office. Other presidents also swore, he says, ``but none of
them had the bad judgment to have it on tape.''
   Most people swear at one time or another, he says, ``but since
neither I nor most other presidents had ever used profanity in
public, millions were shocked. I have heard other presidents use
very earthy language in the Oval Office.''
   Nixon says this in ``In the Arena,'' a book summing up his life.
The seventh book he has published since resigning the presidency in
1974 is the most personal statement of how he has come to feel at
peace with himself. ``Only when you have been in the depths can you
truly appreciate the heights,'' he says.
   ``In the end what matters is that you have always lived life to
the hilt,'' he writes. ``I have won some great victories and
suffered some devastating defeats. But win or lose, I feel
fortunate to have come to that time in life when I can finally
enjoy what my Quaker grandmother would have called `peace at the
center.'''
   At the height of the Watergate scandal, in April 1974, Nixon
released a 1,300-page volume of transcripts of secretly taped
conversation. They were heavily edited to put private comments in
the most favorable light and are especially remembered for hundreds
of designations, ``expletive deleted.''
   Later when the blanks were filled in, Nixon's heavy use of
barnyard language was laid bare. For example, instructing aide John
Dean, he said ``I don't give a shit what happens. I want you all to
stonewall it.'' At another meeting he told Dean and former attorney
general John Mitchell, ``The point is, get the goddamn thing over
with.''
   The 369-page book is to be published by Simon &amp; Schuster on May
2. Excerpts appearing in the current issue of Time magazine focus
on his attempts to debunk ``myths'' about his role in Watergate. He
characterizes as ``the most blatantly false myth'' the assertion
that he knew in advance about the 1972 break-in at Democratic
headquarters in the Watergate. However, no one knowledgeable has
made that claim.
   Nixon said ``the most serious myth'' was that ``on my specific
orders, the CIA obstructed the FBI'' investigation of Watergate. In
fact, the disclosure that cost him the presidency was that he tried
to bring that about, even though his instruction was rebuffed by
the CIA.
   The Nixon in the book, at 77, is a mellower Nixon than he
previously showed himself to be. For instance, he says kind things
about journalists: ``I could not possibly have gone as far as I did
in the political arena without having the benefit of some balanced
as well as negative coverage.''
   And, he takes a surprisingly relaxed view of flag burning. ``If
the day comes when they refrain from desecrating it only because of
the law or some dimly remembered custom, it will have truly become
an empty symbol,'' he says.
   Nixon says his wife, Pat, had better political instincts than he
did.
   ``She urged me not to run for governor of California,'' he says.
``She was right.'' Nixon lost that race in 1962, two years after he
lost the presidency to John F. Kennedy, and snarled at reporters
``you won't have Nixon to kick around any more because, gentlemen,
this is my last press conference.''
   Nixon says the question he is asked most frequently is ``How's
Pat?'' His reply:
   ``Considering what she has been through, she is remarkably well.
You would never know that she had suffered a stroke. She no longer
participates in public events, but devotes all of her time and
energy to her children and (four) grandchildren.
   Nixon observes how television has changed politics, saying
there's little correlation between what makes a good leader and
what is a good TV performance.
   ``In the age of soundbites, the three-minute Gettysburg Address
would have been 2 1@2 minutes too long,' he writes. ``One of
today's ambitious young correspondents would probably have summed
it up this way: `The president himself admitted to this subdued
Pennsylvania crowd what his men have been saying privately: that no
one will long remember what he said here.'''

   Richard Nixon thinks some reporters are ``con
artists'' who don't always tell the truth when they're interviewing
public figures. Here, from his book ``In the Arena'' is what he
thinks reporters mean by some of their lines:
   _``I really want to write a positive story.''
   Nixon: ``This is usually a signal that subject should watch his
back, because someone is about to stick a knife into it.''
   _``If you don't talk to me, your side of the story won't be
represented.''
   Nixon: ``... When you get this line from a reporter, trust your
instincts. Does he want your views or just the legitimacy that your
participation in the story will give him? In a way, this con is a
form of blackmail: Talk to me, or else...''
   _``You should hear what this other guy said about you.''
   Nixon: ``This is journalistic entrapment, a favorite tactic of
reporters who want to provoke you into saying something critical
about the other guy. Don't be suprised if your angry jibe appears
in print and his doesn't.''
   _``I'm going to write the story, whether you talk to me or not.''
   Nixon: When you hear this, you should consider whether the
reporter might be worried he doesn't have a story at all unless you
talk to him.''
   _``Oh, and just one more question.''
   Nixon: Forget the other 10 he asked; this is what he really came
for.''

   Procter &amp; Gamble said Wednesday that it will
expand the use of recycled plastic in containers for Tide, Cheer
and other products to create a new demand for the material and keep
it out of landfills.
   The bottles will be specially marked and will start to appear on
supermarket shelves this fall, the company said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble estimates its expanded recycling effort will
keep 80 million milk, water and soft drink plastic bottles out of
U.S. landfills in its first year.
   It said the project will create a new demand for recycled
plastic and legitimate expansion incentives for facilities that
collect and reprocess plastic bottles.
   Frank Bossu, associate director of product development for the
company, said the announcement marked ``another step toward
expanding the use of recycled plastic to all of our brands.''
   In the future, he said, Procter &amp; Gamble wants all of its own
bottles to be collected and reprocessed.
   Under the project announced Wednesday, recycled plastic will be
used for select sizes of Tide, Cheer, Era, Dash, Downy and Spic 'n
Span, the company said.

<HEAD>Major Member PACs Raised $15 million in 1989</HEAD>
<HEAD>EMBARGOED for release at 12:01 a.m. Thursday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Political action committees controlled by
members of Congress raised more than $15 million in the past three
years and donated more than $3 million of that to other candidates
for office, according to an analysis released Thursday.
   Common Cause, which wants Congress to outlaw the so-called
``member PACs,'' said five members of Congress had PACs which
raised more than $1 million in the past two years.
   The analysis, based on year-end financial reports filed with the
Federal Election Committee, covered 32 PACs associated with current
members of Congress that raised at least $25,000 from Jan. 1, 1987
through Dec. 31, 1989.
   Those 32 PACs raised $14.96 million in the three-year period,
Common Cause said. The total raised by the member PACs in that
period surpasses $15 million if 15 additional member PACs which
raised less than $25,000 each in the period are also counted.
   Common Cause, the self-styled public interest group, has been
heavily lobbying Congress to make several major changes to campaign
finance laws. The group has long been critical of allowing members
of Congress to establish PACs, saying such committeess allow
special interests to curry favor with lawmakers by donating to
their campaigns and the member-controlled PACs.
   Members of Congress can put the money to a variety of uses
provided they are related to the member's political activities.
That provision has been loosely interpreted to allow member PACs to
make contributions to other candidates and to pay for political
travels and expenses.
   Common Cause said five members have PACs that raised more than
$1 million each during the three-year period. The lamwakers and
amounts raised by their PACs in the last three years are: Senate
Republican Leader Robert Dole of Kansas, $5 million; Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., $1.5 million; Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., $1.4
million; Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., $1.1 million; and Rep.
Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., $1 million.
   The top three Democratic House leaders also have member PACs.
Speaker Thomas Foley's House Leadership Fund raised $353,509 in the
three-year period, according to its report to the FEC. Majority
Leader Richard Gephardt's PAC raised $495,000 in the period and
Majority Whip William Gray's PAC raised $346,000.
   The PAC controlled by House Republican Leader Robert Michel of
Illinois raised $72,000 in the same period and distributed more
than half of its receipts to GOP candidates.

   Government troops destroyed a heavily
fortified Communist rebel training camp after two days of fierce
fighting that left 59 insurgents and one soldier dead, the military
reported Wednesday.
   Armed forces spokesman Col. Juanito Rimando said 23 troops were
wounded as 1,200 soldiers stormed the camp.
   ``The report we received was sketchy, but judging by the size of
the government casualties, I would say that it must have been a
really big gunbattle,'' Rimando said.
   He said a platoon of Army Scout Rangers discovered the heavily
fortified camp used by the Communist New People's Army on Sunday.
It was in the remote mountain town of Lianga in Surigao del Sur
province, about 540 miles southeast of Manila.
   Rimando said the troops called for reinforcements, and a two-day
firefight ensued after rebel sentries spotted the soldiers around
the camp.
   He said the rebels were armed with U.S.-made M-60 machineguns,
grenade launchers and automatic rifles.
   Rimando said many of the rebels fled during the battle.
   Also Wednesday, Communist rebels ambushed a police patrol in
central Manila almost one mile from the presidential palace. One
police officer was killed, police spokesman Sgt. Florentino
Bagallon said.
   He said police reinforcements killed one rebel and arrested
another as they pursued the gunmen through a residential district.
   On Saturday, 12 Marxist rebels and three soldiers were killed in
a shootout in Davao del Sur province, 620 miles southeast of
Manila, the military said. Three soldiers were wounded and 11
reported missing.
   The clashes occurred on the eve of the New Peoples Army's 21st
anniversary. The paramilitary rebel group is the military wing of
the banned Communist Party of the Philippines.
   The National Democratic Front, an alliance of 12 underground
Marxist groups including the Communist Party, renewed its offer for
a cease-fire if President Corazon Aquino closes the six U.S.
military bases here.
   In a statement marking the anniversary, the alliance urged Mrs.
Aquino to close the U.S. bases so the two sides ``could in earnest
sit down to arrive at a comprehensive political settlement.''
   Mrs. Aquino has repeatedly rejected such offers.
   The commander of the U.S.-run Subic Bay Naval Base, Rear Adm.
Roger Rich, banned non-essential travel to the capital this week by
the more than 6,000 U.S. sailors at the base. He cited ``threats
against U.S. military and military-associated personnel.''
   Navy spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri said the order bans visits
to Manila for all personnel with the exception of servicemen with
immediate family members in the city.
   That order does not apply to the 9,000 U.S. servicemen at Clark
Air Base, 50 miles north of Manila. But Air Force officials said
personnel at the base were told to refrain from traveling to Manila
at night.

<HEAD>Educators Criticize Public Funds for Private School Tuitition</HEAD>

   A plan to give state money to poor parents so
that their children can attend private schools could be a national
model, supporters say. But critics say the idea suggests that
people have ``given up'' on city schools.
   The Legislature last week passed a bill that would give as much
as $2,500 to each of nearly 1,000 low-income Milwaukee students to
help them leave the public schools and enroll in non-sectarian
private schools. The average yearly tuition at the academies is
$3,200.
   The experiment would affect about 1 percent of the city's
estimated 97,000 students. The state funds used would be deducted
from the city's school budget.
   Gov. Tommy G. Thompson said he will sign the bill into law by
April 27 but will wait to see the results of the Milwaukee program
before deciding whether the school choice plan should be expanded
statewide.
   U.S. Education Undersecretary Ted Sanders, who praised the
experiment, said the plan could provide a form for restructuring
U.S. schools and give options to parents whose choices have been
curtailed by their income.
   But a spokesman for the nation's largest teachers' union
denounced the plan. ``It could lead to racial, educational and
economic isolation of students. Those children left behind will
feel the impact,'' said Howard Carroll of the National Education
Association.
   Milwaukee's school superintendent, Robert Peterkin, also opposes
the plan, saying it would drain resources from depleted inner-city
schools and reverse two decades of city and surburban school
desegregation achieved through voluntary busing.
   ``The concept that the competitive market place will magically
make the public school system improve is simplistic,'' said
Peterkin, who gained national attention in integrating Cambridge,
Mass., schools.
   Peterkin nevertheless has said he won't challenge the program in
court.
   Plans that allow parents more choice on where to send their
children to school have gained momentum in the last five years.
   Minnesota and Iowa were among the first to offer tax credits to
parents sending their children to private schools. Wisconsin's
voucher plan would be first in the nation to directly provide
government funds for the purpose.
   Parents not more than 75 percent above the federal poverty level
_ an income of $12,000 for a family of four _ will be eligible.
Those who already send their children to private schools are not.
   The bill would take effect for the next school year. Eight
Milwaukee-area private schools have agreed to accept students.
   State Rep. Annette Williams, a Democrat who represents an
inner-city Milwaukee district, sponsored the plan. At the
invitation of the Bush administration, she has traveled around the
nation in recent months touting the idea as a model for future
school-choice plans.
   ``For the first time, poor people will get respect because they
can take their $2,500 to a school of their choice and say, `I want
my children educated,''' Ms. Williams said.
   A spokesman for the state's largest teachers union disagreed,
saying the program only ships inner-city school problems to the
suburbs.
   ``What it's really saying is Milwaukee has some major problems.
We think the problems should be addressed, not sent to the
suburbs,'' said Michael Brennan, legislative director for the
Wisconsin Education Association Council.
   ``We think they've given up on the public schools in Milwaukee.
We think that's a mistake. We don't think the answer is to shove
those kids out of the system and hope the problem goes away.''
   The Wisconsin chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union said
it will watch the program to assure children are chosen fairly.
   ``Not all children, black children, will be candidates for those
schools,'' said ACLU director Eunice Edgar. ``Those private schools
will choose which students they accept. If it's publically funded,
all children should have the option.''

<TEXT>
   The 9-year-old son of hostage Frank Reed is
lonely and confused not to have his dad, but has spent the last few
days cheered by a letter from President Bush advising him to ``stay
strong.''
   The president said ``he knows I miss my father a lot so he's
doing all he can do to free the hostages,'' said Tarek Reed, whose
third-grade class all wrote letters to the Oval Office asking Bush
for help. The president wrote back to all 18 pupils.
   Reed, the director of the Lebanese International School in
Beirut, was abducted on Sept. 9, 1986.
   Peggy Say, whose brother Terry Anderson is the longest-held
Western hostage, delivered the letters when she and other relatives
of the eight Americans missing in Lebanon met March 16 with Bush
and his wife, Barbara. The meeting was on the fifth anniversary of
Anderson's abduction.
   An Iranian-backed fundamentalist group, Islamic Jihad, claimed
it kidnapped Anderson, the chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press.
   ``I was amazed at the quick time with which (Bush) answered,''
said Reed's Syrian-born wife, Fifi. ``How can you not like a
president like this? So down to earth.''
   The president's secretary called Glenwood School soon after the
hostage families' reunion to get the pupils home addresses, Mrs.
Reed said. His replies started showing up at homes around this
Boston suburb on Monday.
   ``The school has been enraptured,'' said Reed's 91-year-old
mother, Leota Sprague. ``And little Tarek has read it and read it.''
   The boy said Wednesday his schoolmates realize he is lonely
without his father.
   ``They feel bad that my father was kidnapped,'' he said. ``They
really care about my father.''
   The president's letter said, ``We're trying hard to help bring
your dad back home. Everyone tells me he's a wonderful man and I
know you miss him a lot. I hope that all the hard work and all the
prayers will result in the release of the hostages.''
   ``Stay strong, pray for your dad's safe return,'' it said.
   Mrs. Reed said she was ``not that optimistic'' that her husband
will be freed soon. ``But I'm not an optimist by nature,'' she
added.
   Reed's mother said the president's gesture helped keep the
family strong.
   ``This was just a lovely thing for him to do because our little
boy is torn between knowing what we can't do and wishing we
could,'' she said. ``We can't answer his questions because we're
asking the same thing: Why? Why must this go on?''

   Maryland's leadership heads a
magazine's rankings of the states' financial management, while West
Virginia'a ``Ouija board guesswork'' drags that state down to last.
   Financial World magazine, in its April 17 issue, said it
evaluated each state as if it were an independent business, with
emphasis on balancing the budget, accurately predicting revenue and
using generally accepted accounting principles.
   Maryland has an excellent accounting system, conducts regular
performance evaluations and uses a solid development department to
attract big-name companies to the state, the New York-based
magazine said.
   Maryland also keeps spending in line with increases in personal
income, the magazine said.
   Utah was ranked second, followed by Minnesota, Pennsylvania and
South Carolina.
   At the bottom of the list were Massachusetts in 48th, followed
by Louisiana and West Virginia, which raised taxes a record $392
million last year while trying to straighten out its finances.
   ``At least Louisiana has oil,'' the magazine said. ``West
Virginia has had almost nothing except cheap coal, corrupt
government and poverty. Expenditure estimates (are) little better
than Ouiji board guesswork.''
   The magazine said West Virginia's employee pension funds are
grossly underfunded, its infrastructure is ``awful,'' and its
computer system is behind the times.
   Chuck Polan, secretary of the West Virginia Department of
Administration, said the article had raised some valid issues the
state is working on, but, ``I thought the analysis was pretty
shallow on West Virginia and all states.''
   The magazine hailed Utah for keeping its debt low and
short-term, Minnesota for its performance evaluations and huge
``rainy day'' fund, Pennsylvania for its accurate forecasting of
revenues, and South Carolina for its focus on attracting investment
and business.
   The rankings do not reflect the best places to live, the
magazine said. ``It's entirely possible that the average citizen of
West Virginia is far more comfortable in his state than the typical
Marylander,'' the article said.
   The magazine said it interviewed state treasurers, chief budget
officers and legislative leaders in each state.

   Rep. Barney Frank, whose personal and
professional relationship with a male prostitute is being
investigated by the House ethics committee, said Wednesday that he
will decide soon whether to seek a sixth term.
   The Massachusetts Democrat had said he would make no political
announcement until the committee discloses its findings into his
relationship with Stephen Gobie. However, Frank said he would begin
raising campaign funds.
   ``You reach the point where if you don't do anything, you've
decided by default,'' Frank said.
   Congressional candidates must formally submit nomination papers
by May 8.
   A closed-door session of the ethics committee was set for
Wednesday afternoon and there was speculation that an announcement
would be made on the Frank case.
   Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., a member of the panel, planned to
attend the meeting. His attendance has been taken as a sign that
Frank was not on the agenda because Atkins said last fall he would
not attend meetings in which the Frank case was discussed.
   Atkins said his friendship with Frank and his role as the
Democratic State Committee chairman in Massachusetts made him
unable to remain impartial.
   Frank plans weekend fund-raisers in Boston and other towns to
mark his 50th birthday Saturday.
   No Democrats have announced plans to run for Frank's seat. Two
relatively unknown Republicans, lawyer John Soto and physician Jim
Nuzzo, are running.
   The committee is investigating whether Frank violated House
ethics regulations in his relationship with Gobie. Gobie alleges
that Frank was aware he was running a sex-for-hire ring out of the
congressman's Capitol Hill apartment.
   Frank said he fired Gobie from his job of personal assistant in
1986 after he learned of the prostitution ring. Frank has said he
initially paid Gobie for sex, but later befriended him and gave him
the job in an effort to change Gobie's life.
   Frank said he has testified before the ethics committee and has
supplied it with all the documents and other information requested.

<HEAD>Panama Searches Globe To Recover Looted Treasury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three lawyers in a cramped office in Panama City
have been quietly trying to unravel a global web of transactions in
hopes of recovering up to $800 million in assets they say Manuel
Noriega looted from Panama.
   The money has been stored in at least 10 countries during the
last 21 years, masked through shell corporations, bank accounts,
homes, yachts and other property, prosecutors said.
   ``The corrupt arm of Noriega did not respect borders. It
violated sovereignties; it exported its crimes,'' Eusebio
Marchosky, head of the Panamanian task force, said in a speech
Tuesday night before an international conference of government and
corporate auditors.
   U.S. prosecutors of the Miami drug-trafficking charges against
Noriega said in January that they had identified about $20 million
of assets the deposed dictator squirreled away in bank accounts in
the United States, Britain and Belgium.
   After the speech, the Panamanian prosecutors said Noriega still
has property including a castle in France, a ranch in the Dominican
Republic and apartments in Caracas, Venezuela, and Madrid and on
the island of Majorca, Spain.
   The loot also includes sizable bank accounts, possibly including
profits from drug trafficking, managed by associates of Noriega in
West Berlin, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan, said Eduardo Lombana,
who along with Marchosky and Gonzalo Menendez-Franco faces the
daunting task of recovering the assets.
   ``It's our duty to go for all the money you can find from this
man. We don't know exactly how much, and we don't know exactly
where it all is, but we know he has more or less $700-800 million,
and we want that money,'' said Menendez-Franco.
   While Noriega is the primary focus of the search, the
prosecutors say up to 400 people, ranging from Noriega's military
associates and family members to former bank managers and local
officials, have taken assets belonging to Panama.
   ``It's not only Noriega. It's the whole crew,'' said
Menendez-Franco. ``At the vault of the national bank, the military
arrived with guns and took out $140 million. My colleague has a
voucher for a yacht worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that
Noriega sold to one of his officers for $12,000. ... The situation
in Panama is really diabolic.''
   A Miami-based magazine called Money Laundering Alert reported
last month that almost $1 billion was transferred from a Swiss bank
in Panama to a Grand Cayman bank in the four months after Noriega
was indicted in Florida in February 1988. The magazine quoted
classified State Department documents.
   The special prosecutors, who have no computers, only four aides
and not enough money from the bankrupt Panamanian government to pay
the phone bill, say U.S. agents have been helpful in sharing
information. And other clues are rolling in daily.
   ``The office has just received a letter from a Swedish
businessman offering to buy property Noriega had in Sweden,'' said
Menendez-Franco, adding that they were previously unaware of the
property.
   The 2-month-old group is swamped just trying to sort out the
assets inside Panama and has not yet pursued leads in other
countries. Also, many documents that might have helped track the
money were destroyed during the U.S. invasion, prosecutors said.
   Much investigation is needed before Panama can indict Noriega
and his associates, and for now, the small mountain of papers and
computer files seized during the December U.S. invasion should
remain in the United States for safekeeping, Marchosky said.

   Teen-agers who want to keep cruising
alive in the city that inspired the film ``American Graffiti'' may
find themselves in violation of laws designed to limit the weekend
rite of passage.
   The City Council approved the rules Tuesday night despite
testimony from residents who mostly spoke against them. Many said
there are few alternatives for youngsters in the central California
city.
   ``It's a niche. It's a true niche. It's the way they are
accepted,'' said Ron Bower Sr., president of the Cen-Cal Street
Rods, a car club.
   Officials said the ordinances were not designed to outlaw
cruising, concentrated on McHenry Avenue, but to give officers ways
to control vandalism, drugs and gangs.
   ``My personal opinion is that moderate cruising will still exist
along McHenry,'' said Police Chief Gerald McKinsey.
   Under the limits, motorists who pass checkpoints more than once
in four hours would face fines ranging from $75 to $250.
Pedestrians who routinely gather on the sidewalk and in parking
lots along the strip would risk equal fines for loitering between 6
p.m. and 6 a.m.
   The ordinance, which requires a second reading before becoming
law, will not affect the annual Graffiti Night. The June
celebration of cruising, started two years after Modesto native
George Lucas' film was released in 1973, draws up to 100,000 people
in 30,000 cars.
   At other times, officers would enforce the ordinance within a
marked no-cruising zone on McHenry Avenue when traffic moves less
than 5 mph or intersections are blocked.
   The police department drafted the proposals out of concern that
officers could not reach trouble spots when as many as 5,000 cars
clogged the two-mile strip.
   Much of the problem, McKinsey says, is that Modesto attracts
teens from other cities where cruising already has been banned.
Nearly half of all citations issued along McHenry were to
non-Modesto residents, he said.
   Peak cruising hours also account for more than half of all
assaults on McHenry Avenue and 78 percent of all drug arrests,
McKinsey said.
   Backers of restrictions agree that a pastime that grew out of
the good-natured 1950s has grown unmanageable in this city of
130,000.
   ``The vandalism, drinking, drugs and prostitutes filter into our
street and yards every weekend night,'' said Terry McCloskey, a
resident who attended the council meeting. ``Many of us feel like
prisoners in our own homes on weekend nights because we're afraid
of what will happen to our property.''
   But teen-agers say they cruise for the same reason as their
parents: to meet dates and show off their cars.
   Cruising has become a ritual for teen-agers who grew up with the
legacy of the film ``American Graffiti.''
   ``I'm 17 years old, and I've waited all my life to cruise,''
said Billy Moorehead. ``You can't get rid of us. We're going to
stay.''

<HEAD>Growth, Though Better Than First Thought, Still Small</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew a modest 1.1 percent in
the last quarter, better than previously believed, the government
said Wednesday. Analysts predicted the rebound will continue this
year, but at its slowest pace since the last recession.
   ``The economy is still quite sluggish,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala
Cynwyd, Pa. ``We're not in recession and probably won't go into
recession, but economic growth will be very, very slow.'
   The Commerce Department first reported in January that
fourth-quarter growth had edged up a barely perceptible 0.5
percent, then revised the rate upward in February to 0.9 percent
before issuing its final 1.1 percent estimate Wednesday.
   ``The revision showed an economy on sounder footing than earlier
reported,'' observed allen Sinai, chief economist with the Boston
Co.
   But while the final estimate was an improvement and provided
fresh reason to believe the economy will avoid a recession, it also
demonstrated softness in some sectors, particularly construction
and manufacturing.
   In another report Wednesday that pointed to weakness in
construction, the department said that while new home sales in
February bounced back 3.1 percent from steep declines in December
and January, the 607,000 units sold at a seasonally adjusted annual
rate last month were well below the 647,000 units sold in 1989.
   But in a third report, the department said fourth-quarter
after-tax corporate profits rose 2.8 percent. It was the first
advance of the year after declines of 1.1 percent in the first
quarter, 7.2 percent in the second and 5.4 percent in the third.
   Economic growth in the final three months of 1989 followed
increases of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, 2.5 percent in the
second and 3 percent in the third. The 3 percent gain for all of
1989 was the smallest since a 2.7 percent advance in 1986 and
followed increases of 4.4 percent in 1988 and 3.7 percent in 1987.
   ``Nothing in the report hints at a recession,'' Sinai said, ``so
the focus has to be, does slow growth continue or does it
accelerate? The first half (of 1990) probably will be more of the
same, between flat growth and 2 percent.''
   The latest survey of top economists by Blue Chip Economic
Indicators projects growth of 1.7 percent this year. That would be
the poorest performance since economic activity declined 2.5
percent in 1982 during the last recession.
   The Commerce Department attributed its final GNP revision to an
increase in final sales and a decrease in inventories.
   John Silvia, financial economist with Kemper Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago, said sales rose because consumer spending was ``up
just a touch,'' which in turn helped reduce stockpiles and possible
job losses.
   ``High inventories tend to lead to cutbacks in future
production,'' he noted. ``It doesn't seem to be the case that
inventories are going to lead to a slowdown in the economy.''
   Another plus was a 9.6 percent increase in exports compared to a
2.2 percent gain in imports. Services were up 5.9 percent.
   While overall personal consumption expenditures rose 0.5
percent, durable goods were down 14 percent and capital investment
was off 5.4 percent _ both signs of sluggishness in the
manufacturing sector.
   An inflation index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 4.5
percent last year, reinforcing Sinai's belief that the economy will
grow sluggishly, ``occasionally flirting with recession, until
inflation gets down low enough to permit the Fed to lower interest
rates.''
   The Federal Reserve forced up interest rates last year in its
fight against inflation. While inflation has not declined
significantly, however, the Bush administration and many economists
have urged the Fed to ease its credit policies to stimulate the
economy.
   The various changes left the GNP expanding in the fourth quarter
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.17 trillion.

<HEAD>High Court Hears Clash Over Preferential Awards of Broadcast
Licenses</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposing sides in the Supreme Court's latest
affirmative action cases clashed Wednesday over the value and
constitutionality of preferential treatment for women and
minorities seeking broadcast licenses.
   Opponents said the preferences aren't achieving their goals and
violate the rights of white men. But the policy was defended by the
Federal Communications Commission and others as a way to let
``missing voices'' be heard on radio and television.
   The court, which dealt affirmative action a major setback last
year, heard arguments in cases from Florida and Connecticut that
could affect other programs designed to counter the effects of
alleged past discrimination.
   The court is expected to announce decisions in both cases by
July.
   Justice Antonin Scalia took a leading role during the two-hour
session in challenging the FCC's policy, questioning whether it
promotes diverse viewpoints.
   ``It has to do with nothing but blood, not background and
environment,'' he said. At one point, Scalia suggested that a black
person from the wealthy, predominantly white community of
Scarsdale, N.Y., could benefit from such preferential treatment.
   ``Whether you were born in Scarsdale or Harlem contributes to
what you believe,'' replied Margaret Polivy, a lawyer for a
Hispanic-owned company in Florida. ``What we have identified here
are groups that have been excluded from the mass media.''
   She said Congress regards women and racial minorities as
``missing voices'' which should be given special consideration in
the awarding of broadcast station licenses.
   Achieving equality is ``a concept that underlies our
democracy,'' Ms. Polivy added.
   But Scalia said promoting a colorblind society is just as
important.
   The idea that government benefit should be awarded regardless of
``the color our skin ... also underlies our democracy,'' he said.
   Ms. Polivy represents Rainbow Broadcasting Co., which was
awarded a TV license in Orlando, Fla. A rival, Metro Broadcasting
Inc., argued unsuccessfully before a federal appeals court that it
was denied the license unfairly.
   Gregory Guillot, Metro's lawyer, said the FCC's affirmative
action program has increased minority ownership of television and
radio stations by only 1 percent in 18 years.
   ``I'm no mathematician. But that means there will be 600 years
left'' before equal racial representation in broadcast company
ownership is achieved, Guillot said.
   Daniel M. Armstrong, representing the commission, said ``some
race-conscious steps are necessary'' to make sure women and
minorities have access to the media.
   In the Connecticut case, a federal appeals court struck down the
commission's so-called distress-sale policy, which allows a
broadcaster faced with the loss of a license to sell to a
minority-owned buinsess at 75 percent of market value.
   The appeals court overturned the award of a license in Hartford
to Hispanic-led Astroline Communications Co. The appeals court gave
Alan Shurberg, who is white, a chance to compete for it.
   J. Roger Wollenberg, Astroline's lawyer, said the minority
groups Congress has singled out for preferential treatment ``really
and truly have not had a break in our society... While the
Constitution may be colorblind, the truth is race is with us.''
   Shurberg's attorney, Harry Cole, said Astroline won the license
only because its general partner, Richard P. Ramirez, has a
Hispanic surname. ``Why is Alan Shurberg any less capable of
increasing diversity just because he is white?'' he asked.
   The justices last year struck down an affirmative action program
in Richmond, Va., that set aside a percentage of local public works
contracts for minority-owned business. The ruling cast doubt on the
validity of numerous preferential plans of states and cities but
had no direct effect on federal programs.
   A less conservative high court in 1980 upheld a federal public
works program that set aside 10 percent of the funds for minority
contracts. The high court said then that Congress has special
constitutional authority to approve affirmative action.
   One reason the commission's affirmative action policies have
remained in place since the early 1970s is because Congress has
barred it from spending money to restudy or repeal the policies.

<HEAD>Court Settles Adverse Evidence Issue in Mississippi Death Sentence
Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday gave state
appeals courts the power to uphold murderers' death sentences even
if their sentencing juries wrongly considered some adverse evidence.
   By a 5-4 vote, the justices said appeals courts are empowered to
reweigh the sentencing evidence in capital punishment cases without
sending them back for new jury determinations.
   The dissenters said the decision may streamline the carrying out
of capital punishment ``but at a cost that seems ... to be
intolerable.''
   The court stopped short of upholding the death sentence of
Chandler Clemons, who had challenged a state court's reweighing of
the sentencing evidence in his case.
   Clemons was convicted of killing a delivery man after robbing
him of $5 in cash and a few pizzas in Vicksburg, Miss., three years
ago.
   One of the aggravating factors Clemons' sentencing jury
considered was the ``especially heinous, atrocious or cruel''
nature of the crime.
   The Mississippi Supreme Court later acknowledged that, under
past rulings by the nation's highest court, such an aggravating
factor is unconstitutionally too vague.
   But rather than throw out Clemons' sentence, the state Supreme
Court ruled that he would have been sentenced to death even if the
impermissible factor had not been considered.
   Clemons had contended that such a reweighing by an appellate
court violated his rights.
   Rejecting that contention, Justice Byron R. White wrote for the
court, ``The Constitution does not prevent a state appellate court
from upholding a death sentence ... by reweighing of the
aggravating and mitigating evidence.''
   White said state appeals courts also may determine that such an
error amounted to ``harmless error.''
   White was joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   Writing for the four dissenters, Blackmun said, ``If a death
sentence is to be imposed, it should be pronounced by a
decision-maker who will look upon the face of the defendant as he
renders judgment.''
   ``The bloodless alternative approved by the majority
conveniently may streamline the process of capital sentencing,''
Blackmun said, ``but at a cost that seems to me to be intolerable.''
   The decision did not uphold Clemons' death sentence, but instead
sent his case back to the state Supreme Court for further study.
   White said it was unclear whether the state court actually
engaged in a reweighing of the sentencing trial evidence or in a
harmless-error analysis.
   Clemons used a shotgun to kill Arthur Shorter, prosecutors said,
because he thought the delivery man might be able to identify him
as the robber.

   Minorities and the poor should take the lead
in fighting for clean air and water because they suffer most from
pollution, Jesse Jackson said Wednesday.
   ``The common people who marched for the right to vote must now
march for the right to breathe,'' Jackson said as he launched a
six-stop ``Rainbow Environmental Tour.''
   He praised community leaders in the River Terrace neighborhood
of Northeast Washington who have been fighting plans to expand an
electricity generating plant they blame for fouling the air.
   His tour is part of the buildup for Earth Day on April 22, when
worldwide rallies, demonstrations and other events are scheduled to
support the environmental movement.
   ``Throughout this country, poor communities are stained by the
worst pollution,'' Jackson said.
   The veteran civil rights leader and two-time Democratic
presidential contender said his stops in Georgia, New Mexico,
California and Los Angeles would focus attention on efforts by
blacks, Hispanics and Indians to battle environmental hazards where
they live.
   ``These struggles are examples of a growing people's movement
for environmental justice across the land,'' he said at a news
conference. ``They explode the widespread myth that the poor and
minorities do not care about the environment.''
   Protests in River Terrace have stalled plans by the Potomac
Electric Power Co. to build two more combustion turbine generators
at its Benning Road station, burning oil or coal to generate
electricity.
   Denis Hayes, chairman of Earth Day 1990, said at the news
conference that most members and leaders of major national
environmental groups have been white, but that they have worked
with minority groups to fight pollution hazards.
   ``We're calling attention to something that already exists _ a
broad-based coalition,'' said Hayes, who is accompanying Jackson on
the tour.
   Jackson will be in Atlanta on Friday, Albuquerque, N.M., on
Saturday, Richmond, Calif., on Sunday and Los Angeles on Monday.
   The tour ends Tuesday in Baton Rouge, La.

<TEXT>
   The Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich., has been
authorized to field test squash and cantaloupe that have been
genetically altered to resist two major crop diseases, the
Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   James W. Glosser, head of the department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, said the squash and cantaloupe have been
altered to resist cucumber mosaic virus, or CMV, and papaya
ringspot virus, PRV.
   Glosser said the agency has reviewed the field-test procedures
and determined ``Upjohn is following the necessary steps to assure
the safety of the field tests'' in California, Georgia and Michigan.
   The tests will be conducted in May in Kern and San Benito
counties, California; Worth County, Ga.; and Kalamazoo County, Mich.
   Upjohn will infect the genetically altered squash and cantaloupe
with CMV and PRV under controlled conditions and then monitor the
plants for disease symptoms, Glosser said.
   Current practices for controlling the diseases in the crops
include chemical treatments, buring infected plants and spraying
fields with low levels of the viruses to stimulate immunity.
   Glosser said the Upjohn field tests are the first permitted by
the USDA agency for genetically altered squash or cantaloupe.
However, last August, the agency issued a permit to a Cornell
University researcher for a similar study on CMV-tolerant cucumbers.
   Cucumber, cantaloupe and squash belong to the same plant family
and are similarly affected by CMV, which results in yellowing and
in distortion of leaves and fruit.
   Like all plant viruses, CMV and PRV do not harm humans, the
agency said.

<TEXT>
   The economists and tax lawyers took over
Wednesday and turned the battle over President Bush's No. 1
legislative goal _ a cut in the tax on capital gains _ into a
mind-boggling word fight over elasticity, static revenue and
induced realizations.
   Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., had billed it as ``the Finance
Committee equivalent of a one-on-one game between Michael Jordan
and Magic Johnson.'' Nobody won and there was no evidence any
member of the Senate panel had changed his mind.
   The chief combatants: Kenneth W. Gideon, assistant secretary of
the treasury for tax policy, and Ronald A. Pearlman, who used to
hold that job but now is chief of staff for Congress's Joint
Committee on Taxation.
   The issue: How would Bush's proposal to cut the tax on capital
gains, which are profits from the sale of investments, affect
federal tax collections over the next six years?
   The cut would increase revenues by $12.5 billion, Gideon said.
   The cut would reduce tax revenues by $11.4 billion, Pearlman
said.
   That's a difference of $23.9 billion _ sizable even by
Washington standards.
   Pearlman and his staff wrote a 69-page pamphlet to justify their
estimate; Gideon responded with a 14-pager and 29 pages of backup
explanation, charts and tables.
   Pearlman said almost all the difference was caused by Treasury
and congressional experts who could not agree on how many billion
dollars worth of capital gains would be pocketed _ or realized, as
the experts say _ if there were no change in tax law.
   Pearlman relied on a Congressional Budget Office projection of
$254 billion worth of capital gains this year, up 50 percent from
1988. He said gains generally rise with the stock market and that
four times between 1977 and 1988, gains had increased by 50 percent
over a two-year period.
   Gideon cited a White House Office of Management and Budget
forecast of $214 billion of gains and said ``the year-to-year
relation of realizations to stock prices is weak at best.''
   Gideon emphasized differences with Pearlman over ``elasticity''
_ that is, how much would taxpayers increase or reduce their
investments in response to a change in tax law.
   Gideon and the administration are far more optimistic than
Pearlman and Democratic leaders of Congress that, for years to
come, cutting the capital-gains tax will induce people to sell old
investments and put the money into new ones.
   Pearlman acknowledged there would be a considerable amount of
new buying and selling for a year or two as a result of the rate
cut. Nevertheless, he says, the law still would leave many people
with a strong incentive to hold their investments until death and
pay a far lower tax.
   After a quick review of Pearlman's pamphlet, Gideon said, ``our
preliminary conclusion is that we find no basis in the arguments
presented ... for changing the elasticities utilized in our
estimates.''
   ``The Joint Committee staff relies on 30 years of historical
economic data,'' countered Pearlman.
   Michael J. Boskin, Bush's chief economics adviser, weighed in
with word that Gideon's estimates ``are more representative (than
Pearlman's) of the extensive research on the effect of changes in
capital-gains tax rates on realization.''
   Jane Gravelle, a senior specialist with the Library of Congress,
presented a brand new study of her own _ and concluded that a
capital-gains cut might cost the government even more revenue than
the Joint Committee staff predicted.
   In the end, the experts were conciliatory. ``We respect the
right of ... (Pearlman's) staff to hold a different professional
opinion,'' said Gideon.
   And Ms. Gravelle reminded the lawmakers of what they have always
suspected: ``In the final analysis, there is always some
uncertainty associated with statistical studies.''

<TEXT>
   Yugoslavia's first independent
television station was banned Wednesday after being on the air
barely one hour.
   Federal inspectors interrupted the broadcasting, saying the
station, Studio B Television, failed to get permission from the
official state-run Belgrade television.
   ``The real reason is ... political struggle,'' said a source at
Studio B, who refused to be identified. He alleged that the state
was trying to preserve its monopoly on information.
   The spokesman said the station had received permission from the
Federal Board for Communications to start broadcasting 10 years ago.
   ``But the climate at the time was not auspicious. Things have
changed now,'' he said, referring to political and economic reform
sweeping Eastern Europe.
   The independent station plans to provide general information,
music and entertainment.
   The state Tanjug news agency said the independent station was
swarmed with calls from disappointed viewers after it went off the
air, demanding that the program be continued. It was not known when
the station would be back on the air.

   Doctors will examine ousted Communist leader
Erich Honecker to determine if he is physically and mentally able
to face charges of corruption and abuse of power, a prosecutor said
Wednesday.
   A team of medical specialists, including psychiatrists, will
also examine other officials from Honecker's regime to determine
their competency to stand trial, said deputy chief prosecutor
Lothar Reuter.
   The examination further increases the chances that the
77-year-old man who ruled East Germany under strict socialism for
17 years will avoid a criminal trial.
   Much of the fervor to prosecute the former authorities has eased
as some of East Germany's freely elected leaders struggle with
allegations they had ties to the Communist government and its
network of functionaries and informants.
   Reuter's announcement, described by the state news agency ADN as
his ``personal recommendation,'' came two days after the chief
prosecutor's office said there were no grounds to charge Honecker,
former economics minister Guenther Mittag and former state security
chief Erich Mielke with high treason.
   Chief Prosecutor Hans-Juergen Joseph also said that Honecker and
the other two had been cleared of conspiracy charges.
   But Honecker, now in poor health, and other officials are still
under investigation for charges of corruption and abuse of power.
   Reuter said the independent medical team plans to complete its
examinations by the end of April.
   Honecker and the 64-year-old Mittag are accused of embezzling
state funds to build vacation homes and buy luxuries.
   Mielke, 84, is charged with abusing his control of the state
security system.
   The prosecutor's office said indictments against members of
Honecker's regime were not expected before May or June. It said
trials of the three probably would not begin before summer because
of the poor health of all three men.
   Honecker's government was deposed in October by a massive
peaceful revolt. He was arrested in January after undergoing
surgery for kidney cancer and was freed the next day.

   NASA began preparations Wednesday to
load the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope into the shuttle
Discovery after working out a few bugs, namely gnat-like midges.
   Technicians snared about 40 of the insects before removing the
traps and preparing for Thursday's installation.
   ``We're up and running,'' said George Diller, a spokesman for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The agency had planned to install the telescope in the orbiter
Tuesday. But it was forced to delay the procedure after midges were
found in a payload preparation room on the launch tower.
   Engineers feared the insects might damage the fragile
25,000-pound telescope, the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever
built.
   NASA decided to proceed with preparations to install the
telescope after only three or so midges were captured late Tuesday
and early Wednesday. During the previous 24 hours, 37 midges had
been sucked into 4-foot cylinders containing lights and fans that
apparently lured the insects.
   Technicians spent Wednesday removing the special protective bag
from the telescope and opening Discovery's payload bay door.
   The delay in loading the telescope will not affect Discovery's
scheduled April 12 liftoff, Diller said. The launch may be moved up
a day or two, in fact, since technicians needed little of the
contingency time built into Discovery's prelaunch program.
   Discovery's five astronauts are to deploy the Hubble on the
second day of the five-day mission. Once it begins orbiting 370
miles above Earth, the telescope will be capable of looking seven
times more deeply into space and detecting objects 50 times fainter
than the best ground-based observatory.
   Astronomers will be able to look back almost to the beginning of
time by studying stars and galaxies so distant that their light has
been traveling toward Earth for 14 billion years.

   The usual club crawlers, hacks and nighttime
entrepreneurs of the city's urban jungle had some beastly company
in Wednesday's pre-dawn hours when the circus came to town.
   The Ringling Bros. Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus sent 17 elephants, 42
horses, three camels, four llamas and a streetsweeper through an
East River tunnel for their annual trek from a railroad yard in
Queens to Madison Square Garden.
   About 80 people, tossing peanuts and apples, were waiting to
greet them.
   Walter Clark, who had a plastic elephant trunk strapped over his
nose to welcome the circus, said he just came from an annual
elephant party.
   ``We watched Dumbo videos and ate animal crackers,'' he said,
sipping on Elephant malt liquor. ``The focus is pretty much on
elephants, but if a llama showed up we wouldn't kick them out.''
   The real elephants, wearing silvery head masks with small
lights, lumbered trunk-to-tail at the head of the procession down
34th Street, pausing for a 1:45 a.m. buffet of 250 pounds of
carrots, lettuce and apples.
   Yolanda Jardine, 22, petted one of the elephants, a well
mannered male named Beecher. ``When I have a baby, I'll name it
Beecher,'' she said.

<HEAD>Critics Denounce Amnesty Plan for Former Secret Police</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics on both sides of the border Wednesday
denounced a West German government proposal to grant amnesty to
former members of East Germany's hated secret police.
   In Bonn, members of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's junior coalition
partners, the Free Democrats, joined with the left-leaning
opposition Social Democrats in rejecting a government proposal to
grant amnesty to former members of the secret police force known as
the Stasi.
   The 85,000-member Stasi and its 109,000 informers were used by
East Germany's hard-line Stalinist government for decades to
control the country.
   Under pressure from pro-democracy groups, outgoing Premier Hans
Modrow ordered the secret police disbanded after the overthrow of
hard-liner Erich Honecker last fall.
   Since East Germany's first free elections on March 18, which
were won by a coalition headed by Lothar de Maiziere, there have
been allegations some of the new 400-member parliament may have
secret police links.
   The allegations have targeted de Maiziere and the leader of
another party, Ibrahim Boehme of the Social Democrats. Both have
denied any links to the secret police but Boehme has temporarily
resigned his party post until his name is cleared.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Tuesday
``a generous amnesty,'' for the Stasi may be needed to quell
further instability in East Germany.
   ``Not everyone who was forced to report to the Stasi was a
criminal,'' Schaeuble said. Kohl later told reporters he agreed
``in principle'' with the proposal.
   Gerhard Baum, deputy chairman of the Free Democrats, strongly
rejected the amnesty proposal Wednesday.
   ``The new democracy in the GDR (East Germany) must start with a
thorough study of the past, not by drawing a line under it,'' as if
it never existed, Baum said.
   ``The moral side of the changes in the GDR should not be
forgotten,'' Baum said.
   He acknowledged that many Stasi members were innocent of
wrongdoing, but added: ``Purposely committed illegal wrongs cannot
be allowed to be swept under the table.''
   Horst Ehmke of the main opposition Social Democrats also blasted
the suggested amnesty.
   ``The freely elected parliament cannot sweep the `Stasi affairs'
under the rug without seriously damaging the young democracy,''
Ehmke said.
   Former Stasi members should be allowed to begin new careers,
Baum said, but it is ``out of the question'' to allow them to hold
important political posts.
   East German leftist groups have demanded an immediate
investigation into the allegations against newly elected parliament
members. They called for demonstrations Thursday to press their
demands to determine which deputies may be linked to the Stasi.

<TEXT>
   Joy Baker, the wife of former Senate
Republican Leader Howard H. Baker Jr., had a small malignant growth
removed from her right lung Wednesday, a family spokesman said.
   The tumor was removed during a 90-minute operation by Mayo
Clinic doctors at St. Marys Hospital in Rochester, Minn., said
spokesman Tom Griscom.
   The growth, he said, was removed from the right lobe of her
right lung.
   A source familiar with her case, who did not wish to be
identified by name, said the growth was ``a low grade tumor'' not a
recurrence of the cancer that was removed from the same lung in
1982.
   Mrs. Baker was to remain in the intensive care unit for two or
three days, and in the hospital for another 10 days to two weeks.
   She is not expected to require additional treatment, the source
said.
   Mrs. Baker is the daughter of the late Senate Republican leader
Everett Dirksen of Illinois. Howard Baker served in the Senate from
1966 until 1984 and was President Reagan's White House chief of
staff from February 1987 until July 1988.
   The Bakers' primary residence is in Huntsville, Tenn., but they
also maintain a home in Washington, where Baker practices law.

   High interest rates and declining consumer
confidence somewhat depressed new home sales in February although
they bounced back slightly from steep declines the previous two
months, according to Commerce Department figures released Wednesday.
   The department said new single-family homes were sold at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 607,000 units in February after
plummeting 6.8 percent in January and a revised 8.0 percent in
December.
   But the February rate still was below the 649,000 homes sold in
1989 and, except for January, the lowest since 556,000 homes were
sold on an annual basis last March. Sales totaled 589,000 in
January.
   ``The housing industry has been adversely affected by the
increase in mortgage rates in January and February,'' said
economist Richard Peach of the Mortgage Bankers Association. ``I
don't see much of a decline in rates in the months ahead and
there's substantial risk that they will go higher in the second
half of the year.''
   David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of
Home Builders, also pointed to weakness in the economy, including
slower job growth, as contributing to a decline in consumer
confidence and thus softer sales.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said interest on fixed-rate
mortgages rose from 10.17 percent at the beginning of February to
10.31 percent before falling to 10.23 percent at month's end.
   Mark Obrinsky, an economist with the Federal National Mortgage
Association, described the 10 percent level a ``psychological
barrier'' that was keeping the housing market a little weaker than
at the end of 1989 when rates dropped into single digits.
   John A. Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association
of Realtors, also blamed high mortgage rates for a 2.3 percent
decline in existing home sales last month. The Realtors said the
February pace was the slowest in seven months.
   Many analysts had expected sales to surge with the unusually
warm weather in January and February following the fourth coldest
December on record.
   But Obrinsky said the median time to find a house is about seven
weeks ``so that some that sat on the sidelines in December may
still be looking but haven't found their house yet.
   ``It's possible we could see some further increases in March and
April,'' he said.
   Sales were up 21.3 percent to 256,000 units at an annual rate in
the South, more than rebounding from a 16.3 percent decline in
January. But sales fell elsewhere in the nation.
   They were down 18 percent to 82,000 units in the Northeast, 6.4
percent to 88,000 units in the Midwest and 1.6 percent to 181,000
units in the West.

   Sri Lanka's president dissolved the
Cabinet on Wednesday and prepared to appoint a new council of
ministers, a senior government official said.
   Cabinet spokesman and Foreign Minister Ranjan Wijeratne said
Prime Minister Dingiri Wijetunga resigned early Wednesday, clearing
the way for the president's order to dissolve the Cabinet.
   ``The prime minister has ceased to hold office by resignation,
the Cabinet of ministers stands dissolved by operation of law,''
said Wijeratne, reading a statement by President Ranasinghe
Premadasa.
   Wijeratne said a new prime minister and Cabinet would be named
Thursday.
   Wijetunga, who took office in March 1988, gave no explaination
for the resignations, but Wijeratne said it marked the end of the
Cabinet's one-year term.
   ``When he was appointed, the president said the term would be a
one-year period,'' he said.
   The former Cabinet, which was appointed after Premadasa's United
National Party won the parliamentary election, had 21 ministers and
50 deputy ministers.
   The Sri Lankan Constitution provides for a weak prime minister
and gives all executive powers to the president. The president is
also the head of state and the commander in chief of the armed
forces.

   A close adviser to West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl predicted Wednesday that economic union with East
Germany could come as soon as July.
   Bernhard Vogel, chairman of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation,
which is allied with Kohl's Christian Democratic Union, said East
Germany would adopt the West German deutschmark as its currency as
part of the union.
   Vogel called it ``a first courageous step to provide East
Germans with the living conditions of their West German neighbors.''
   East Germans, in an election 10 days ago, endorsed German
unification and a market economy by choosing a coalition of
conservative parties allied with the West German Christian
Democrats.
   Since then, Vogel said, the stream of East Germans emigrating to
West Germany has slowed. He said that showed East Germans expect a
fundamental improvement in their economic, social and political
situation.
   Vogel said the drafting of a Constitution for all of Germany
would be the next step after economic and monetary consolidation.
   He said the fastest approach would be East Germany acceding to
the West German constitution.
   Vogel offered assurances that ``a united Germany will continue
to remain a democratic and stable nation.''
   He said Germans wanted to achieve the kind of friendship with
Poland to the East that has existed for years with France to the
West.
   After Germany's defeat in World War II some of its eastern
territories were turned over to Poland, which had lost land of its
own to the Soviet Union.
   ``We don't want to respond to injustice with injustice,'' Vogel
said. ``For us the Polish border is final and definitive. But it is
not enough for us to say that. A united Germany will have to put
its seal on this guarantee.''

   Swiss authorities said Wednesday they
found no evidence that ousted Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu
stashed vast sums of cash in a Basel bank account.
   A similar investigation in Geneva is pending.
   The suspicion of money being stashed in secret Swiss accounts
was raised by the new Romanian government that came to power after
last December's revolution in which Ceausescu and his wife Elena
were executed by a firing squad.
   Attorney Moritz Leuenberger, a Swiss member of parliament, said
he was tipped by unidentified Romanian exiles that Ceausescu had
transferred about $400 million, mostly in gold bullion, to Zurich
shortly before his downfall.
   Swiss authorities lifted strict banking secrecy rules after the
new Bucharest leadership asked them for help in its search for
assets the Ceausescus allegedly spirited out of the country during
their 24-year reign.
   The Swiss government put a precautionary freeze Dec. 24 on any
assets linked to Ceausescu and his clan that may be in Swiss banks.
   District attorney Walter Rothenfluh said an investigation of
bank files ``made it seem credible'' that the Basel account, opened
in 1980, was used solely for regular transactions by the Romanian
foreign trade ministry.
   Rothenfluh declined to name the bank.

   Corporate after-tax profits rose 2.8 percent
in the final quarter of 1989, their first gain of the year, the
government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said the $156.7 billion increase at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate followed declines of 5.4 percent in
the third quarter, 7.2 percent in the second and 1.1 percent in the
first.
   John Silvia, financial economist with Kemper Financial Services
Inc. in Chicago, described profits as ``a leading indicator''
useful in forecasting future business developments.
   As an example, he said, ``when corporations are faced with
profit cuts, profit squeezes, they tend to cut employment, capital
spending.''
   A broader measure _ before-tax profits adjusted for depreciation
and inventories _ declined 3.2 percent to an annual rate of $285.7
billion.
   This measure fell during each of the quarters of 1989 and ended
the year down 8.3 percent. It was the first annual decrease since a
0.1 percent drop in 1986 and the largest since a 20.2 percent loss
in 1982, during the last recession.
   Corporate cash flows _ a measure intended to show the amount of
funds that corporations have available for investment _ dipped 0.3
percent to $398.2 billion at an annual rate in the fourth quarter.
   They had risen 1.9 percent in the third quarter and 0.8 percent
in the second after falling 5.6 percent in the first.
   Dividend payments to stockholders increased 1.9 percent to an
annual rate of $125.6 billion after gains of 1.9 percent in the
third quarter, 2.0 percent in the second and 2.9 percent in the
first.

<HEAD>Aquaculture a Young but Growing Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. aquaculture industry is young but
growing rapidly into a major provider of food for an expanding
world population, an Agriculture Department report said Wednesday.
   ``The 1990s should be an important decade for growth,'' the
report said. ``World population gains and limits on wild catch from
the oceans should increase the demand for aquaculture products.''
   Acquaculture refers to commercial production of a wide variety
of fish, shellfish and seafood products. It includes baitfish,
hatchery operations and the stocking of fish farms.
   ``If U.S. seafood consumption continues to grow, the rise in
demand will likely be met through increased imports and higher
domestic aquacultural production,'' the report said.
   Fish farmers and other aquacultural producers ``have an
advantage over capture fisheries in that production can rise
without endangering future supplies.
   Catfish are the leading species grown commercially in the United
States. Production in 1989 rose 16 percent in volume to 342 million
pounds delivered by farmers, the report said.
   Overall, including the wild catch, catfish ranked fourth in 1988
behind pollock, salmon and cod, and may have moved into third place
ahead of cod in 1989, the report said.
   Prices paid to catfish farmers last year averaged 72 cents a
pound, down 6 percent from 1988 because of the larger supply and
lower prices paid by processors for large fish.
   But catfish prices have risen since October and by February had
reached 75 cents a pound, the report said. Also, growers have
formed a bargaining association that has negotiated prices with
many processors for the first half of 1990.
   The most recent survey of trout growers showed a decrease in the
number of producers to 478 in 1989 from 518 in 1988. However, sales
of trout and trout eggs rose to $72.6 million from $66.4 million in
1988.
   Domestically grown farm salmon output was estimated at nine
million to 10 million pounds in 1989, a sharp increase from six
million pounds in 1988. The gain was attributed to larger output on
both the East and West coasts.
   Oyster production has increased in the Northwest while disease
problems reduced oyster harvesting in the Chesapeake Bay, formerly
the largest producing area, the report said.
   Pacific Coast oyster production grew from 6.7 million pounds of
meat with a value of $5.6 million in 1980 to eight million pounds
valued at $14.5 million in 1988, the most recent figures available.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the International Monetary Fund are
nearing accord on providing billions of dollars it can lend to
countries in financial trouble, a U.S. official said Wednesday.
   ``We've been talking about an increase of 33 to 50 percent, and
it's narrowing to the upper end of that range,'' said Assistant
Treasury Secretary Charles H. Dallara.
   The fund's managing director, Michel Camdessus, has sought a
doubling of its resources. Those ``quotas'' are equivalent to $117
billion but much of the money is in the currencies of Third World
countries, which borrowers don't want.
   The United States, Britain and Saudi Arabia were the major
holdouts against a 100 percent increase.
   The United States supplies about one dollar of every five
available to the fund. A 50 percent increase would require about
$12 billion from the United States, but the contribution would not
be counted as increasing the federal deficit.
   There is hope for an agreement next week when Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady meets in Paris with financial leaders from the
governments of Japan, West Germany, Britain, France, Canada and
Italy. The ``G-7'' group tries to coordinate the policies of the
world's leading economic powers.
   The fund has 152 member governments. In recent years its main
job has been lending to Third World countries in return for
promises of policy changes designed to bring them additional loans
and put them in better shape to repay.
   Recent moves in eastern Europe away from Communism and toward
market economies have opened new needs for the fund's help. It
recently made new loan agreements with Poland and Hungary.
   Extensive calls on its resources are expected from Argentina,
Brazil and other heavily indebted governments.
   The accord on new money for the fund has been held up by
disagreement over the total, the position of France and Britain as
Japan becomes the second biggest contributor, and increases in
overdue debt to the fund that amount to more than $4 billion.

Inadequate</HEAD>

   Indian teen-agers suffer higher rates of
suicide, substance abuse and other mental health problems than
white youth, but the government provides just a tenth of the
necesssary mental health workers, congressional researchers say.
   Despite acute psychological problems among Plains tribes, the
Indian Health Service has no mental health professionals in
Minnesota and just two to serve tribes in North Dakota, South
Dakota, Nebraska and Iowa, according to the report by the Office of
Technology Assessment.
   The IHS declined to comment on the report or the agency's mental
health services. The congressional researchers refused to give the
agency a copy of the report until it was released to the public
Thursday, said IHS spokeswoman Patricia DeAsis.
   The IHS has 17 mental health professionals nationwide to serve
397,000 Native American children and adolescents. Nine of them are
in Montana and Wyoming.
   ``The resources to cope with these serious problems are clearly
inadequate,'' said the report, which was prepared for the Senate's
Select Committee on Indian Affairs.
   The researchers said scientifically accepted data on the extent
of mental health problems among Indian teen-agers is scarce but
available information suggests Indian youth are more prone than
white teen-agers to a laundry list of ills including suicide and
alcohol and drug abuse.
   Indians in their early teens are four times more likely to kill
themselves than youth of other races, and suicide rates among
northern Plains tribes have climbed rapidly during the 1980s, the
report said.
   In the IHS' Aberdeen, S.D., region _ South Dakota, North Dakota,
Nebraska and Iowa _ 6.5 percent of the Indian youth who were
hospitalized in 1988 were treated for attempted suicides, up from
3.5 percent in 1980.
   In Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, the percentage of
hospitalized Indian youth treated for suicide rose from 3.7 percent
in 1980 to 15.5 percent in 1988.
   The mental health problems among Indian children are brought on
by a wide range of other health and family problems, including
divorce and parental substance abuse, the congressional researchers
said.
   More than 22 percent of Indian adolescents have parents with
drinking problems, compared to 14 percent for other Minnesota
teens, a University of Minnesota study said.
   Indian youth are more than twice as likely as other adolescents
to be living with just one parent and 10 times more likely to be
living without a parent, the study found.
   ``Given the hunger and social deprivation which results from
high unemployment in Indian country, it should come as no surprise
to others that the lives of these children are filled with
stress,'' said Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, chairman of the Indian
affairs committee.
   The report said at least 170 mental-health workers were needed
for Indian adolescents.
   To recruit the additional workers, scholarships could be
provided to students in mental health fields who promise to work
with Indian children, the report recommended.

   Democrat Jose Serrano was sworn in Wednesday

   ``Let the message go from here today to those children who are
still in the projects and who are on the street corner that there
is a better tomorrow,'' Serrano told the House of Representatives
moments after taking the oath of office.
   Serrano's swearing-in came on the 38th anniversary of his
mother's arrival in New York from Puerto Rico to join her husband.
Serrano, 46, is the only member of Congress who was born in Puerto
Rico.
   ``While her youngest son is in the gallery, her oldest son is
sworn in as U.S. congressman,'' Serrano said proudly. His parents
are deceased.
   Serrano was joined on the floor with three of his five children.
His wife, Mary, brother, other children and about 200 campaign
workers stood in the gallery and cheered.
   Serrano, a 16-year veteran of the state Assembly, won 92 percent
of the vote in a special election March 20 to fill the seat vacated
in January when Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., resigned. Garcia was
convicted of accepting bribes in the Wedtech influence-peddling

   Five people who were arrested for protesting
the lack of access for the handicapped to public buildings sued the
District of Columbia Wednesday because their wheelchairs couldn't
get into the probation office.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit asks that ramps or other
modifications be made to the building to allow wheelchair access.
   U.S. Capitol police arrested 104 demonstrators who were
protesting the lack of access to public buildings nationwide during
a March 13 demonstration in the Capitol.
   All the demonstrators were sentenced in D.C. Superior Court to
unsupervised probation or time served with no probation, with the
exception of five defendants who were sentenced to supervised
probation, according to the lawsuit.
   When those defendants arrived at the probation offices, there
was no wheelchair access, the lawsuit said.
   ``It made my angry to come all that way to our nation's capital
to protest the lack of access across the nation, and face the cruel
irony that essential government services are not accessible to
those of us who use wheelchairs for mobility,'' said Stephanie
Thomas of Austin, Texas.
   Ulysses Hammond, administrator of D.C. Superior Court, was not
immediately available for comment.
   Timothy Cook, director of the National Disability Action Center,
said the five wheelchair users never got into the probation offices
and have written the court asking what they should do. No responses
had been received as of Wednesday, Cook said.

   A House committee voted Wednesday to cap
federal spending on the super collider at $5 billion and to hinge
construction decisions on proof a key component will work.
   The House Science, Space and Technology Committee gave the $8
billion superconducting super collider its first congressional
authorization by a 32-9 vote after an emotionally charged debate on
the rising cost and questions about technology.
   The committee defeated attempts by Rep. Sherwood Boehlert,
R-N.Y., to bar all construction on the collider, to be built south
of Dallas, until the energy secretary certifies the superconducting
magnets _ a key component _ could be mass produced by industry.
   Chairman Robert A. Roe, D-N.J., said Boehlert's amendment could
result in an 18-month delay costing $1.5 billion to $2 billion.
   The Energy Department originally estimated the total cost at
$4.4 billion, then increased the price to $5.9 billion last year.
DOE officials are suggesting the cost could be closer to $8 billion.
   The super collider involves a 54-mile underground ring in which
streams of protons, guided by the powerful magnets, would be hurled
at almost the speed of light until they smash together and break
into even smaller particles. Scientists say it would recreate the
physical state of the universe after the ``Big Bang,'' a theory
that the expansion of the universe began with a gigantic explosion.
   The bill now goes to the House floor.

<HEAD>Election Begins That Could Make Zimbabwe One-Party State</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zimbabweans began voting in elections
Wednesday that will decide whether Robert Mugabe's government, the
sure winner, will transform one of Africa's few Western-style
democracies into a one-party state.
   Half of Zimbabwe's 9 million people are registered to ballot in
the two-day presidential and parliamentary polls, the second since
Mugabe led Zimbabwe _ formerly the white-ruled British colony of
Rhodesia _ to independence in 1980.
   Mugabe, 66, cast his vote at Mpofu School in the Highfield West
constituency of Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, just before noon.
   Seven parties are running in the election, but only Edgar
Tekere's year-old Zimbabwe Unity Movement is viewed as a serious
challenger to Mugabe's governing Zimbabwe African National Union
(Patriotic Front).
   Mugabe's party is expected to capture most, if not all, of the
108 seats at stake in the 150-seat Parliament. His dream is to
amend the constitution to establish a one-party state after winning
every seat up for election.
   Tekere insists he can win several seats provided the elections
are not rigged, thus thwarting Mugabe's goal of a single-party
state.
   But Mugabe told The Associated Press on Wednesday, ``I feel
quite confident we will win all the seats.''
   Of the 150 seats in Parliament, 12 have already been granted to
the governing party because there were no challengers, and 30 are
reserved for tribal chiefs, provincial governors and presidential
nominees, all of whom are considered Mugabe supporters.
   Tekere, 52, once a close friend of Mugabe and co-founder of the
governing party in 1963, is the first candidate to challenge the
president.
   He had been No. 3 in the ZANU (PF) hierarchy as
secretary-general, but was dismissed from the governing party after
accusing senior leaders of corruption.
   He wants to block Mugabe's plan to impose one-party rule and
pledges to weed out corruption, improve the lot of Zimbabweans and
liberalize the socialist state.
   In asking for voter support, Mugabe points to the thousands of
landless families granted farms during his administration and to
the inexpensive schooling and health care to which all Zimbabweans
are entitled.
   Mugabe, who led a seven-year guerrilla war to end almost a
century of white minority rule in Rhodesia, is certain to be
returned to power.
   In the old Parliament, Tekere and an independent sat as the only
opponents of the government.
   While Tekere enjoys some support in his tribal stronghold of
Manicaland, he still must counter recollections in Zimbabwe of how
after independence he was tried for the murder of an elderly white
farmer and acquitted on a legal technicality.
   Tekere said he led gunmen on an attack on the man's small tract
on Mugabe's orders after learning about an arms cache there.
   Campaigning has been the most violent since independence.
   Tekere has accused Mugabe of seeking to impose a Marxist
dictatorship on Zimbabwe. Mugabe has claimed Tekere is plotting a
coup if he loses the elections. Bloody clashes have taken place
between rival party supporters.
   One of Tekere's candidates was shot and wounded.
   But police reported no incidents Wednesday.
   Reports from most parts of Zimbabwe said voting got off to a
slow start, reflecting the apathy shown by many of the people.
   ``Why bother going to vote when we know ZANU (PF) will win,''
Robson Charuma, a 33-year-old busdriver, said in Zimbabwe's second
city of Bulawayo.
   Results from the polls are expected to be announced Friday
night, according to polling officials.

   Lucasfilm Inc. is suing rapper Luke
Skyywalker of the group 2 Live Crew, alleging the singer has
tarnished the clean-cut image of the similarly named ``Star Wars''
movie hero.
   2 Live Crew's latest album, ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be,'' has
been banned in two Florida counties because of its sexually
explicit lyrics.
   The $300 million federal lawsuit filed Tuesday charges
Skyywalker, 29, whose real name is Luther Campbell, and Luke
Skyywalker Records Inc. with trademark infringement, dilution,
unfair competition and unjust enrichment.
   The film company owned by director George Lucas believes the
public may associate Lucas, Lucasfilm and the ``Star Wars'' trilogy
hero Luke Skywalker with the rap group's music, said attorney
Bertram Fields.
   Luke Skyywalker Studios referred calls for comment to its
business attorney, Allen Jacobi of Miami. A message left at
Jacobi's office on Wednesday was not immediately returned.
   The space-age character played by actor Mark Hamill is
associated with ``wholesomeness and bravery and honesty and a
clean-cut character that we would want our kids to be like,''
Fields said.
   Fields said Lucasfilm had received complaints from people who
believed the company approved of the band's music. One parent
complained that his young son purchased the album thinking it was
connected to the movies, he said.

   Members of the first group of U.S., Soviet and
Chinese climbers to try to scale Mount Everest have reached Camp IV
at 23,500 feet, less than 6,000 feet from the top, it was reported
Wednesday.
   All 45 people on the climb were in good health, except for a
couple with colds, deputy leader Warren Thompson said in a
statement issued by the Mount Everest International Peace Climb
Team through a public relations company.
   ``The climb is progressing slightly ahead of schedule,''
Thompson said.
   The camp was established earlier this week, the climb's
publicists said.
   The expedition is led by Jim Whittaker of Port Townsend, Wash.,
the first U.S. climber to scale the 29,028-foot peak, and consists
of three 15-member teams, each with five climbers and 10 support
personnel.
   The goal is for one climber from each nation to reach the summit
of the world's highest mountain together and to collect trash and
debris from previous expeditions.
   Plans call for the group to establish seven camps on the way to
the top.
   The statement said Camp IV was reached after a blizzard
destroyed two tents Friday and forced the entire expedition to
retreat to the base camp at the terminus of Main Rongbuk Glacier in
Tibet, about 17,000 feet up the mountain.

<HEAD>Acne Drug Suppresses Pre-Cancerous Mouth Growths, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An acne drug can suppress
pre-cancerous growths in the mouth for up to a year, a researcher
said Wednesday.
   The work is aimed at suppressing white patches in the mouth
called leukoplakia, which can be a precursor of cancers in the
mouth, pharynx, larynx and esophagus. Altogether, those cancers
afflict 50,000 people a year.
   The drug, called isotretinoin or Accutane, shrank growths
significantly for three months and largely prevented progression
during the following nine months, said Dr. Scott Lippman.
   Lippman, of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston,
presented his results at a science writers seminar sponsored by the
American Cancer Society.
   He stressed that his work does not involve women of childbearing
age, because of isotretinoin's risk of causing birth defects.
   The study, still in progress, has included 58 patients.
   About 60 percent of patients showed shrinkage of at least half
their growths after three months of taking isotretinoin orally
every day, Lippman said. After three months, they and the
non-responders were randomly assigned to a follow-up therapy of
either a lower dose of isotretinoin or doses of another substance
called beta carotene.
   The two follow-up groups contained equal shares of
non-responders, Lippman said.
   In the beta carotene group, 56 percent relapsed over the
following nine months. A relapse was defined as growth of the mouth
lesions or appearance of new ones.
   That relapse rate is essentially equal to what another study
found with no follow-up treatment at all, Lippman said.
   In contrast, only one relapse has been seen so far among
participants in the low-dose isotretinoin group, he said. Sixty
percent of these participants improved after going on the low dose,
he said.
   Side effects from the initial high-dose treatment included dry
skin and lips and an eye condition called conjunctivitis, he said.
They were less severe and less frequent on low doses, he said.
   The work was financed by the National Cancer Institute.
   Dr. John Laszlo, the cancer society's senior vice president for
research, said the results look promising.
   Further work might produce drugs that work as well without
isotretinoin's side effects, which can include harm to the liver,
he said.
   Because of side effects, he said he would be worried about
people using isotretinoin on their own for fighting cancer.
   Dr. Arthur Mashburg of the Veterans Administration Medical
Center in East Orange, N.J., said he believed the focus of the
study was incorrect.
   Leukoplakias usually do not progress to cancer, he said, so the
leukoplakias that shrink under therapy may not have actually been
pre-malignant.
   In a second presentation, a researcher said his work suggests a
way to identify breast cancer patients who would not need follow-up
treatment after surgery.
   Perhaps 20 percent of breast cancer patients would fit the
category, and so not require chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or
radiation after surgery, said Dr. Thomas Nealon Jr., of St.
Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in New York.
   Those women have a tumor of 2 centimeters or less, no spread of
cancer to the lymph nodes or elsewhere, a favorable appearance of
cancer cells under a microscope, a well-limited tumor, no cancer in
vessels leading to the lymph nodes, and no tumor cells in the blood
vessels.
   But Marc Lippman, director of the Vincent Lombardi Cancer
Research Center at Georgetown University in Washington, said
Nealon's results included too few women to convince him.
   Furthermore, only about 7 percent of breast cancer cases might
meet the criteria, he said. And most breast cancers occur in
post-menopausal women, for whom treatment with an anti-estrogen
drug called tamoxifen is safe and beneficial, he said.
   He also said the criteria would be difficult to apply uniformly
because of judgment calls on appearance of cancer cells.

<HEAD>Lawmaker: Wrong Men in Jail in `Birmingham Six' Bombings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BARR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An IRA informer identified one of the bombers who
killed 21 people at two Birmingham pubs, but six innocent men had
already been convicted and police failed to follow up the lead, a
British lawmaker said Wednesday.
   The allegation comes as campaigners are pressuring authorities
anew over the cases of the ``Birmingham Six,'' who were convicted
of bombing the pubs in 1974, saying they were victims of a
miscarriage of British justice.
   The bombings in that northern city, which also left 162 injured,
were the deadliest ever by the Irish Republican Army in its
campaign to end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   Chris Mullin, a member of the opposition Labor Party, said he
based his charge on a police document _ a summary of an interview
with an IRA informer _ and said it ``ought to bring the end of this
scandal.''
   Mullin spoke hours before four alleged bombers were identified
in Granada Television's dramatized documentary, ``Who Bombed
Birmingham?''
   The program identified the suspects as a man who served 12 years
for other offenses, a man serving a life sentence in Ireland for
murder and two men now living in Ireland. One of those two men, the
program alleged, was involved in other IRA attacks including the
murder of 11 people in London in 1982 and the bombing in Brighton
in 1984 that nearly killed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Granada said a fifth suspect could not be named for ``security
reasons.''
   None of those identified on the program is among the six
convicted of bombing two pubs in Birmingham on Nov. 21, 1974.
   West Midlands Chief Constable Geoffrey Dear said he would
investigate any new evidence disclosed by the TV broadcast. He also
said police had never claimed the convicted six were the only ones
involved.
   In Dublin, a High Court judge rejected an application by
attorney Frank Clarke for an order blocking the television
broadcast on Ireland's RTE network. Clarke appeared on behalf of a
man who claimed he was identified as one of the bombers. He was not
identified in court.
   Ireland's Supreme Court later declined to hear the case.
   The IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein, denounced the
television program. ``The quality and strength of the evidence
which proves the innocence of the six is not, not should be,
dependent upon pointing the finger of suspicion at others,'' it
said.
   Mullin, who claims to have interviewed four men who carried out
the bombings, would not comment on the identifications made in the
broadcast.
   However, he said, ``I advise you to take very seriously'' the
Granada broadcast.
   Last week, Home Secretary David Waddington ordered a new
investigation of several matters raised by attorneys for the
convicts, known as the ``Birmingham Six.'' Waddington has refused
to say what specific points are under review.
   ``The lie cannot be sustained much longer,'' Mullin said at a
news conference to publicize the third edition of his book on the
case, ``Error of Judgment.''
   Mullin said the most important information in the new edition of
his book concerns a file from the archives of the anti-terrorist
Special Branch, which he received from Granada television.
   That file was described as a summary of an interview with an IRA
informant who talked about his role in other bombings and named at
least 20 other members of the Birmingham IRA or its political wing,
Sinn Fein.
   The informer, Mullin said, talked about meeting six weeks after
the bombings with an IRA man who admitted that he had placed the
bomb in one of the two pubs. Mullin says he has interviewed that
man, identified in the book as ``Z.''
   ``What this document shows,'' Mullin wrote, ``is that as long
ago as November or December 1975, the police had someone purporting
to tell them the identity of one of the men who had planted the pub
bombs. He was in a position to know. His information on many other
matters was accurate. And yet they chose to take no action.''
   The cause of the six has been taken up by Amnesty International,
the Irish government and most recently by Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich,
the Roman Catholic primate of Ireland.
   Pressure for a review intensified in October after a court set
aside the convictions of four young people for IRA bombings in
Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. As in the Birmingham case, there
were allegations that police had ignored credible information that
they had the wrong suspects, had coerced confessions and had
falsified evidence.
   Five of the six convicts were arrested the night of the bombings
as they were about to board a ferry to Belfast for the funeral of
an IRA man. All six _ Johnny Walker, Patrick Hill, Hugh Callaghan,
Richard McIlkenny, Gerry Hunter and Billy Power _ were sentenced to
life in prison in 1975.
   Mullin said he has interviewed 14 people with knowledge of the
bombings, including four men directly involved, and all agree that
none of the six convicts was involved.

   President Bush expressed concern Wednesday
over the spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East after the
arrest of five people in an alleged attempt to supply Iraq with
American-made devices for triggering nuclear weapons.
   ``We again call upon nuclear suppliers to exercise special
restraint in providing materials related to the development of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and intermediate-range
missiles in this volatile area,'' the president said in a statement.
   While avoiding any direct criticism of Iraq, Bush noted that it
was one of many nations that have signed the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty. ``Iraqi officials are well aware of our
views on nuclear proliferation which we have made clear on several
occasions,'' Bush said, calling on all nations to abide by the
treaty.
   His statement was issued after five people were arrested in
Britain after an 18-month investigation by British and U.S.
officials in an alleged scheme to deliver 40 devices for nuclear
weapons to Iraq.
   Bush said the arrest ``raises once again the administration's
deep concern about the issue of nuclear proliferation in the Middle
East.'' He said the proliferation of nuclear weapons, along with
chemical arms and intermediate-range missiles, ``continues to pose
serious threats to U.S. interests as well as the interests of our
friends in the region.
   ``These programs only serve to heighten regional tensions and
exacerbate regional problems,'' Bush said.

   The United States has routinely denied asylum
to refugees from oppression in countries it considers friendly,
while granting asylum to those fleeing Communist governments,
Amnesty International and congressional critics charged Wednesday.
   The international human rights organization said that from June
1983 to September 1989 only 2 percent of Guatemalans seeking asylum
were successful. It said the figure for El Salvador was 2.5 percent
and for Haiti just over 2 percent.
   By contrast nearly 91 percent of persons seeking asylum from
Romania, then under Communist rule, won their cases.
   ``The United States government is slamming the door to its
Salvadoran, Guatemalan and Haitian neighbors,'' John G. Healey,
executive director of Amnesty International USA, said at a news
conference. ``Asylum case after asylum case shows that the State
Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service deny
certain people equal treatment.''
   Randy L. Levine, a New York attorney who was ranking associate
deputy attorney general from 1986 to 1988, took issue with the
Amnesty report.
   ``In my experience, most of the refugees from Guatemala and El
Salvador would not qualify for asylum because they do not have a
well founded fear of persecution,'' Levine said. ``Most of them are
economic refugees.''
   Nathan Kingsley, public affairs officer for the State
Department's Bureau of Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, which
advises the INS on asylum matters, said he had not seen the Amnesty
report.
   ``The position of the government is that the governments in El
Salvador and Guatemala are democratically elected,'' said Carl
Albrecht, a spokesman for the department's refugee bureau. ``There
are problems, but we view those governments in a different light
than we did Romania or other places where we thought the
persecution was greater.''
   A Justice Department spokesman, Duke Austin, said that for five
years the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration, a volunteer
group based in Geneva, has monitored Salvadorans deported to their
homeland from the United States and has found no cases of
persecution. It said the State Department and others have monitored
those returned to Haiti, with similar results.
   ``Can it be established that the United States is in fact
returning people to their native homelands and they are
subsequently being persecuted?'' Austin asked. ``If that is the
case, then we are violating the intent of the law. I don't know of
a single case that has ever been established in El Salvador or in
Haiti. Not one.''
   He said he did not know of any in Guatemala either, although he
was not aware of any similar surveys being made there.
   Austin also said Congress had not complained that the 1980
Refugee Act, designed to assure equal treatment of asylum-seekers,
was not being complied with.
   However, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in a statement read for
her by an aide at the news conference, commended Amnesty
International for its ``campaign to end discrimination in the
application of U.S. immigration laws.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., submitted a statement saying
that the promise of the 1980 law had not been fulfilled ``for many
refugees even in our own hemisphere.''
   Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, R-Ore., said, ``It has long been apparent
to me that U.S. officials have administered the act in a manner
that discriminates against asylum-seekers from `friendly' nations
such as El Salvador and Guatemala. The repression in those
countries is just as real as the repression in Nicaragua or
Vietnam.''
   According to Amnesty's figures, 27 percent of cases from
Nicaragua and nearly a third of those from Vietnam were granted.
   The organization, which monitors human rights violations, said
government bias against asylum-seekers from particular countries
``appears to be a worldwide pattern.''

   Black enrollment at colleges and universities
is up after years of decline, with the lion's share of the increase
at private institutions, according to federal statistics released
Wednesday.
   The National Institute of Independent Colleges and Universities
cited Education Department figures showing a 7.1 percent increase
in black enrollment at their institutions between fall 1986 and
fall 1988. Black students increased 0.2 percent at public
institutions over the same period.
   The rise reverses a trend toward shrinking black enrollments.
Between 1982 and 1986, black enrollment dropped 5.4 percent at
independent colleges or private and 4.6 percent at public
institutions, the institute said. A similar reversal occurred for
Native Americans.
   Overall minority enrollment at private schools increased 5.3
percent from 1986 to 1988, compared to 3.3 percent during the
earlier period. At public colleges there was a 4.5 percent hike, a
slowdown from the 5.4 percent rise charted during the 1982-86
period.
   Richard Rosser, president of the independent colleges group,
said member schools have used aggressive recruiting tactics and
made ``a real commitment to financial aid'' to achieve the jump in
minority enrollment.
   Rosser said that since 1980, independent institutions have
doubled their financial aid commitment in real dollars, while
financial aid rose only about 9 percent from 1970 to 1980.
   Frederick S. Humphries, president of historically black Florida
A&amp;M University, said, ``It's very gratifying to know there's an
increase in minority enrollment in both public and private
institutions. That needs to happen. Hopefully, all of us can grow
because we need to grow. We need to serve better the minority
students of America.''
   Florida A&amp;M is one of 117 historically and predominantly black
colleges that belong to the National Association for Equal
Opportunity in Higher Education.
   In a separate enrollment study released Wednesday at the start
of a four-day conference, the association said fall 1989 enrollment
at the 117 institutions was 294,427 students _ an increase of 9,747
or 3.4 percent over fall 1988 enrollment counts.
   Association President Samuel Myers said he applauded the
increase in minority enrollment but warned that all higher
education institutions must find effective ways to address the
needs of minority students once they get them on their campuses.
   ``It's my hope that these institutions will not only bring those
students in but that they do something to retain those students,
give them the support they need to graduate,'' Myers said.
   Rosser responded that recent studies show independent
institutions ``have a higher retention rate and persistence rate
for minorities in all programs at all our schools. The figures show
how hard we've been working.''
   Native Americans' enrollment increased by 9.2 percent from 1986
to 1988 at private colleges and universities, compared with 3.6
percent at their public counterparts. For the 1982-86 period, the
institute said, Native American enrollment decreased 4.8 percent at
the independent schools and increased only 0.9 percent at public
institutions.
   Enrollment of Hispanic students in independent higher education
decreased by 4.4 percent, due primarily to enrollment declines in
Puerto Rico. Enrollment of Asian students increased by 22.3 percent
in independent colleges and universities and by 10.5 percent in
public higher educaiton.
   Despite the healthier increase in minority enrollment at
independent schools, minorities accounted for a greater proportion
of the student body at public institutions _ 19.9 percent compared
to 18.4 percent.

<HEAD>Bill Would Ban Exports of Pesticides Banned in U.S.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bite into a banana from Ecuador _ or any
developing country _ and you could be swallowing residue from a
pesticide outlawed in the United States for health reasons, an
Ecuadoran official said Wednesday.
   ``Ecuador, like many developing countries, is not in the
condition to guarantee that highly toxic pesticides will be used in
even a relatively safe manner,'' Mercedes Bolanos de Moreno, chief
of Ecuador's plant protection program, told the Senate Agriculture
Committee.
   She said her country has no national pesticide policy.
   ``Instead, policies change frequently, according to changes in
government and the influence of financially interested groups,''
she told the panel, which is considering a bill to stop U.S.
companies from exporting chemicals not registered for use in this
country.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., called the importing of produce
sprayed with these pesticides ``the circle of poison'' and said his
top priority in this session of Congress is stopping the practice.
   ``One-fourth of the produce we eat is imported,'' said Leahy.
``That's 135 pounds of fruits and vegetables for every man, woman
and child'' a year.
   While Agriculture Department inspectors have the power to stop
foods found to contain banned chemicals from entering the United
States, Leahy's bill would prohibit the export of such pesticides.
   In the last two years, inspectors have halted imports of beef
from Honduras, pineapples from the Philippines and carrots from
Latin America after determining that the foods contained pesticides
banned from use in the United States.
   Jay Vroom, president of the National Agricultural Chemicals
Association, said, however that Leahy's bill would hurt countries
the United States is trying to help.
   ``Some pesticides produced in the United States and sold
overseas are unregistered here because the specific pest controlled
is not a U.S. problem, or crops concerned are generally not grown
in America, like coffee, rubber, cocoa, bananas, tea,'' said Vroom.
   He said attempts to control how other countries use
agrichemicals would amount to U.S. imperialism.
   But Ms. Bolanos de Moreno said she would welcome the legislation.
   U.S. shoppers buy large quantities of bananas from Ecuador,
which also ships plantain, coffee, cocoa and sugar to the United
States.
   Ms. Bolanos de Moreno said Ecuador does not have the money or
staff to evaluate all the chemicals being offered for sale for
crops there.
   ``In fact, we only have one person in charge of reviewing all
studies submitted for registration,'' she said.
   ``The U.S. pesticide registration process is far more extensive
and permits regulators to evaluate all the risks associated with a
product's use,'' she said.
   She also said the current methods used by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency to advise other countries on risks associated
with certain chemicals aren't working.
   She said her country has received few notices from the EPA about
changes it has made in regulations on pesticides. She said several
chemicals were removed from the U.S. market, but she was never told
of the actions.
   EPA official Linda Fisher said her agency wants the law on
exporting pesticides to be strengthened but is not in favor or
Leahy's bill.
   She said the EPA is working on strengthening its export policies
in hopes of fixing problems Ms. Bolanos de Moreno described.
   Under questioning from Leahy, Ms. Fisher said the EPA presently
has no authority to stop a U.S. company from exporting a chemical
that is banned here, even if the foreign country has said it
doesn't want it.
   Furthermore, there is no agency within the federal government
that a foreign government can call if it wants to keep a
U.S.-manufactured chemical out of its country, she said.
   Leahy said his bill would not only prevent chemicals banned here
from being exported, but also would stop any food sprayed with
illegal pesticides from being imported. That would protect
Americans from companies that decide to manufacture the illegal
chemicals elsewhere, the senator said.
   Virtually the same legislation also has been introduced in the
House and is awaiting hearings there.

   State television did not say when the flights, suspended March

Lebanon-based group, threatened airlines of all nations that help
fly Soviet Jews to Israel.
   Israeli officials expect up to 750,000 Soviet Jews to emigrate
the next decade as the result of relaxed rules in the Soviet Union
and tighter entry quotas in the United States. The prospect angers
Arab leaders, who fear Palestinians will be displaced by the influx.
   MTI quoted Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens as saying Last
Saturday that Israel hoped Hungary ``which has just become a
democracy, will not give an example of surrendering to terrorism.''
   On Sunday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn criticized
Malev's ``rush decision'' and said it was made without consulting
the government.
   Terrorists should not be encouraged through bowing to their
threats, Horn added .
   In Moscow, the Soviet newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta on
Wednesday had criticized Malev for suspending the flights, accusing
it of ``indecisiveness in the fight against international
terrorism.''
   The article was published a day after the U.S. administration
expressed disappointment at the suspension and urged Hungary to
reconsider.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta made no mention of the position taken by
the Soviet national airline Aeroflot, which stopped selling tickets
for Soviet Jewish emigres traveling to Hungary.
   A group of U.S. Jewish leaders on Tuesday met with a senior
Soviet Foreign Ministry official, Yuri Reshetov, to express concern
about the steps taken by Aeroflot and Malev, the mission's leader,
Marvin Lander, national chairman-elect of the United Jewish Appeal,
said.
   Jewish activists in the Soviet Union also said a family could
take up to 880 pounds of luggage on Malev, and many counted on it
to transport their most precious belongings. They say Aeroflot
would only transport 88 pounds a person.
   From January 1989 through January 1990, 16,700 Soviet Jews have
joined about 180,000 of their brethren who have emigrated to Israel
since 1967.
   The expectations of mass immigration led right-wing Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir to suggest Israel needed to retain the
occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip to house the immigrants.
   Despite Israeli clarifications that it had no such policy,
Shamir's suggestion inflamed the Arab world. Israel responded by
clamping military censorship on immigration figures and routes,
citing Arab threats.
   Several countries joined the Soviet Ukraine at the United
Nations on Wednesday in criticizing the settlement of Jews in the
Israeli-occupied lands and called for an end to Soviet Jewish
emigration there.
   The comments came during the third day of Security Council
discussions on the settlement of Soviet Jews in the occupied lands.
The council planned to continue the discussions on Thursday.
   Yugoslav envoy Dragoslav Pejic, speaking for the non-aligned
countries, said the issue ``constitutes a most serious additional
element of tension and instability, not only in the occupied
Palestinian territories but also in the broader region of the
Middle East.''
   Pakistan, India, Qatar, Libya, Bangladesh and Tanzania also
asked an end to settlement of Soviet Jews in the occupied lands.

   The late Jesse Owens, whose performance at the
1936 Olympics put the lie to Hitler's boasts of racial superiority,
picked up a fifth gold medal Wednesday for ``humanitarian
contributions in the race of life.''
   President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to his
widow, Ruth Owens, in a ceremony at the White House also attended
by three daughters and teammates of the track legend.
   This Saturday marks the 10th anniversary of Owens' death at age
66.
   The president later hailed Owens's multiple gold medals in the
Berlin games ``a victory for humanity'' in prepared remarks to a
banquet sponsored by the U.S. Olympic Committee.
   ``The Olympics, like democracy, are a kind of dialogue _ a way
that nations can converse in the language of friendly competition,
not deadly conflict,'' Bush said.
   Bush called Owens, who was black, an ``Olympic hero and an
American hero every day of his life ... born with the gift of
burning speed.''
   ``He was always the fastest,'' said Bush, recalling the
afternoon in May 1935 when the Ohio State runner broke three world
records and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes.
   ``Talk about a guy in a hurry,'' Bush laughed. ``He was the
epitome of that.''
   At the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin, Owens captured four gold
medals _ in the broad jump, 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and
400-meter relay.
   ``The Berlin Games were to be the showcase of Hitler's theories
on the superiority of the master race until this 23-year-old kid''
showed up, Bush said. ``It was an unrivaled athletic triumph. But
more than that, it really was a triumph for all humanity.''
   Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it was not those
athletic feats but ``his humanitarian contributions in the race of
life'' that earned Owens the Congressional Gold Medal.
   Owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving as ``a
special ambassador for sports,'' said Bush. He said the athlete's
legacy lives on through the Jesse Owens Games, a playground
Olympics; the Jesse Owens International Trophy for amateur athletes
and the Jesse Owens Foundation, which awards scholarships to needy
youth.
   ``Despite the many honors, his greatest satisfaction came from
his work with youth,'' said Mrs. Owens, 74.
   Attending the ceremony along with Owens' family were former
Olympians Mal Whitfield, Harrison Dillard and Herb Douglass; former
teammates John Chavers, Samuel Devine and Chester Thomas, and two
Ohio Democrats, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum and Rep. Louis Stokes, who
spearheaded the drive to strike the medal.
   The silver-haired Mrs. Owens, standing outside the White House
afterwards, called the event ``absolutely beautiful.'' She added:
``I'm sure with the sun shining straight down, Jesse's watching us,
too.''

   A House committee chairman on Wednesday
charged that the Navy is ignoring the possibility that its
sophisticated Aegis air defense system may be vulnerable to
anti-radiation missiles.
   ``The more this issue is reviewed, the more our concern grows
about the Navy's refusal to address this problem,'' Rep. John
Dingell, D-Mich., said in a March 27 letter to a House colleague.
   The staff of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
oversight and investigations, which Dingell chairs, has been
reviewing the Navy's purchase of the new $1.2 billion
guided-missile destroyer.
   The destroyer, called the Arleigh Burke class after the World
War II naval hero and former chief of naval operations, will be
equipped with Aegis computers as well as Tomahawk cruise missiles
and an expensive all-steel superstructure.
   In a letter to Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., chairman of the
House Armed Services subcommittee on seapower and strategic
critical materials, Dingell complained that the Navy has refused to
test the Aegis system against anti-radiation missiles or ARMs,
missiles which home in on an adversary's radar beams.
   Dingell described the missiles as effective weapons that more
nations, including the Soviets and Third World countries, are
consistently developing.
   ``At your Feb. 28, 1990, hearing, you suggested they put the
Aegis radar on a raft and run a test against an ARM _ then the Navy
witnesses claimed it would be too expensive and they would not
learn anything,'' Dingell wrote.
   ``Why this incredible relunctance to test?''
   In an interview, Bennett wondered whether those who prepared the
letter for Dingell had read the Navy's testimony correctly.
   ``I was surprised at some of the words he used,'' Bennett said
Wednesday of the letter. ``He seemed to be saying that the Navy did
not affirm that they had tests that proved to be successful for
this weapon.''
   Although Bennett has complained in the past about Dingell's
inquiry into the guided-missile destroyer, he said Wednesday that
he was not objecting to the oversight subcommittee's review of the
program.
   However, he added that the Burke destroyer is ``the world's best
ship regardless of anything he's (Dingell) said.''
   Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman, said: ``Questions
raised in his letter to Congressman Bennett are not new and have
been addressed thoroughly by the Navy in hearings, reports and
briefings to the Congress. The Navy has full confidence in the
(Ticonderoga cruiser and Burke destroyer classes using the Aegis)
and the Aegis combat system including our abilty to counter the ARM
and other missile threats.''
   Navy Secretary Lawrence Garrett said earlier that anti-radiation
missiles should be ``easier for Aegis to detect, engage and destroy
than other types of anti-ship missiles.''
   Nevertheless, Dingell said the Navy ``appears to be paralyzed by
the ARM threat.''
   The lawmaker suggested that Bennett's subcommittee demand that
the Navy develop plans for a ``realistic test'' of the Aegis combat
system before more funds are spent on the Burke destroyer.

   The bodies of a missionary couple
were found Wednesday in an area where hundreds of civilians have
been killed in battles between government troops and rebels,
diplomatic sources said.
   The bodies of the Rev. Tom Jackson, 72, an American, and his
British wife, June, were found in their home village of Bahn in
eastern Nimba County, the sources said on condition of anonymity.
   They spoke from Monrovia, the Liberian capital, and Abidjan,
capital of neighboring Ivory Coast.
   U.S. and British embassies in Monrovia advised their citizens in
Nimba County to leave the region immediately, except those working
at a well-guarded iron ore mine at Yekepa, near Saniquellie town.
   Fifty Americans and 20 to 30 Britons are affected, the embassies
said. About 6,000 Americans, most of them missionaries, live in
Liberia, which was founded in 1847 by freed U.S. slaves.
   In Washington, the State Department said it could not confirm
the couple was dead, although it had received reports their car was
found abandoned.
   The Jacksons belonged to the U.S.-based United Liberian Inland
Church and had lived in the country for 40 years, translating the
Bible into the local Gio and Mano languages.
   Jackson was from North Carolina, and Mrs. Jackson, in her late
50s, was from Croyden, Surrey.
   Reports from Monrovia said 16 people, including Bahn Mayor John
Kayea, were killed in the town Saturday in a gun battle between
soldiers and rebels. The reports could not be immediately confirmed.
   They did not mention the missionaries, but a source in Abidjan
indicated the couple might have been killed when they tried to stop
troops killing civilians.
   ``It is not yet known who was responsible for the killings,''
one diplomat said. ``Very little information is available because
roads to the village have been cut off by the fighting.''
   Jackson's daughter, Beth Workman of Raleigh, N.C., said she
received reports from missionaries still in the region that
guerrillas had shot the couple accidentally as they were driving to
Monrovia.
   ``They just heard a car coming and opened fire, but it wasn't a
vendetta,'' she said. ``It's sad any way you look at it, but at
least we can feel better about it.''
   ``Even the rebels respected Daddy,'' she said. ``They knew he
wouldn't get involved. I don't think anyone would have had a
vendetta against him.''
   The fighting has spread the past two weeks, and Nimba has been
cut off from neighboring provinces. Refugees who fled to Monrovia
last week said troops had burned down villages and killed an
unknown number of people.
   Western diplomats and international human rights organizations
say soldiers have killed hundreds of civilians since they were
deployed in Nimba to crush about 200 rebels led by former civil
servant Charles Taylor.
   The rebels invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24 in a bid to oust
President Samuel Doe, who has ruled this West African nation since
a violent coup on April 12, 1980.
   Soldiers in Nimba have targeted people of the Gio and Mano
tribes to which the rebels belong, escalating the rebellion into a
tribal conflict. Rebels retaliated by killing civilians of Doe's
Krahn tribe, but not on the same scale as the military.
   Diplomats say the military killings have outraged many people
and won recruits for the rebels, who previously had little support.
   Doe said last month that his troops have had difficulty
differentiating between rebels and civilians.
   In the past, Washington has been a generous and loyal supporter
of Doe.
   But diplomatic sources say the United States is considering
cutting back its large embassy in Monrovia following a decision to
end new aid to the country because of continuing rights violations
and misuse of aid funds.

   The government on Wednesday freed
six black nationalists jailed for crimes ranging from high treason
to arms possession, a move the six said was aimed at reducing
foreign pressure on South Africa.
   ``Our release is just a window-dressing to ease pressure from
the international community,'' said Muzi Nkosi, 34, who read a
statement on behalf of the prisoners after they left Robben Island
prison.
   The African National Congress has demanded freedom for all
political prisoners before it will open talks on constitutional
reforms with the white-minority government.
   Five of the prisoners were ANC members and one belonged to the
Black Consciousness movement. All were due for release in November
or December.
   Thirty-five prisoners have been released since February, when
300 prisoners staged a two-week hunger strike to demand freedom for
those convicted of politically related crimes.
   President F.W. de Klerk has agreed to free prisoners held for
non-violent political crimes, but he has said the release of
violent political criminals will have to be negotiated.
   De Klerk legalized the ANC and other black groups in February
and freed ANC leader Nelson Mandela after 27 years of imprisonment
in a bid to bring blacks to the negotiating table.

   An air force helicopter exploded
while en route to rescue an injured soldier, killing all six crew
members, the military said Wednesday.
   Lt. Marcio Meira said the French-built Super Puma helicopter
exploded Tuesday night over the Restinga da Marambaia military
area, 43 miles west of Rio de Janeiro. The craft had been
dispatched from a nearby airbase to rescue a soldier injured during
training maneuvers, Meira said.
   The air force said the dead included the pilot, two lieutenants,
two sergeants and a medical assistant.
   Cause of the accident in clear weather was not known, but the
Air Force has begun an investigation, Meira said.

   The House overwhelmingly approved legislation
Wednesday that would create a Department of the Environment and
require the federal government to comply with toxic waste
management laws.
   The 371-55 vote on a bill to elevate the Environmental
Protection Agency to Cabinet-level came after a lengthy dispute
over whether the measure was being weighed down with too many
controversial requirements that might threaten a veto.
   An attempt pushed by the Bush administration to substitute a
``clean'' bill that would have dealt only with creating the new
department was turned back by a vote of 266-161.
   Republicans argued that the additional provisions were
``designed to embarrass'' President Bush and force a presidential
veto. Bush has said he wants to sign a bill creating a Department
of the Environment on Earth Day, April 22.
   A similar bill elevating the EPA to Cabinet rank has been
approved by the Senate Government Affairs Committee but has yet to
be taken up by the full Senate, which has been preoccupied by clean
air legislation.
   In addition to creating a 15th Cabinet-level agency, the House
bill also would:
   _Require the federal government be subject to the same federal
environmental laws on disposal of hazardous wastes as industry,
lifting an exemption that over the years has allowed some agencies,
including the Defense Department, to pollute areas near federal
facilities.
   _Require the new department to limit its use of private
consultants and take additional actions to guard against conflicts
of interest involving both consultants and outside advisory panels.
   _Call for creation of an independent Bureau of Environmental
Statistics within the new department with the director named to a
four-year term and not subject to dismissal except for malfeasance.
   _Beef up enforcement activities against polluters with the
hiring of additional investigators and creation of a new training
academy for investigators. The number of criminal and civil
investigators would be increased by 30 percent a year over five
years.
   The legislation would take care to insulate the department's new
statistical bureau to avoid interference in the development of
environmental statistics and reports. It prohibits department
officials, including the secretary, as well as other administration
officials from reviewing the bureau's reports.
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., one of the key sponsors of the
legislation, said the bill signals ``a new era of national resolve
for a clean and safe environment.''
   He said the legislation will ``depoliticize'' the EPA, provide
citizens with improved and reliable environmental statistics and
put ``a halt to conflicts of interests'' at the agency.
   Conyers had cited a case last summer in which government
scientists had been directed to change congressional testimony on
global warming by the Office of Management and Budget.
   The EPA over the years has been criticized for relying too
heavily on outside consultants and for cases in which consultants
or advisory boards include people who have associations with
industry, including polluters.
   Republicans argued during floor debate on the bill that the
additional provisions interfered in what should be the prerogative
of the executive branch.
   ``We're not here to fine tune or micromanage,'' said Minority
Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   Likewise, the Bush administration had warned it might veto the
bill if many of the provisions in the House legislation are
included in final legislation from Congress.
   While Bush has endorsed elevating the EPA to a Cabinet-level
department, he has raised particular concerns over some of the
House provisions.
   Administration officials told congressional leaders last week
that several parts of the House bill, especially the provisions
insulating the new statistical bureau, ``interfere unacceptably''
with the president's management of the executive branch.
   White House and EPA officials noted that the bill would prohibit
other administration officials, including the secretary of the
environment, from reviewing reports and works of new Bureau of
Environmental Statistics and that its director could not be
dismissed for anything other than malfeasance.
   Among other complaints were that the bill would restrict the
hiring of private consultants by the new department and require a
certain percentage of senior officials, including regional
administrators, be hired without consideration of political
affiliation.
   ``These are measures that are not applied to other agencies,''
said EPA Director William Reilly, noting that no such restrictions
are imposed on the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which operates
within the Labor Department.
   Neither version of the bill envisions a significant expansion of
the EPA. An independent regulatory agency, the EPA has about 16,000
employees and a budget of $5.5 billion.

   Platoon leader Ivan and his Contra
loyalists relax on a hillside, but they cradle M-16 rifles in their
laps and wear hand grenades on their camouflage uniforms like
medals, ready for battle should Sandinista guns break the silence
of the countryside.
   A pact between leaders of the Contras and Nicaragua's new United
National Opposition government calls for the rebels to lay down
their weapons.
   But the rank-and-file rebels have no intention of doing that.
   ``If they signed that pact, they made an error,'' said Ivan,
whose real name is Monico Gonzalez Rivas. ``Here in the mountains
you feel things in your own flesh. Here is where we're going to
decide.''
   Ivan and his men see the pact, signed Friday in Honduras, as a
death warrant because it makes no mention of what had been a top
Contra demand: that the Sandinista military also disarm to make way
for the formation of a neutral army.
   ``I see it as something very difficult, this thing of giving up
our weapons, because they would have to order our coffins at the
same time,'' said platoon member Filadelfo Lopez Castro, whose nom
de guerre is Filiberto.
   Ivan and his platoon can afford to rest at least for a while in
the rolling farmland 10 miles north of Jinotega, a provincial
capital and important Sandinista military post.
   Peasants in this region strongly favor the Contras, who they
feed and protect.
   Andres, an area ranch hand who asked he not be further
identified for fear of the Sandinistas, strongly opposes the plan
to disarm the Contras.
   ``If they make the boys disarm, then all of us might as well
take to the hills. The piricuacos (an Indian word meaning dogs)
would wipe us out,'' said Andres, referring to the Sandinistas.
   Ivan, 25, has fought the leftist Sandinistas for eight years,
seen them sign successive regional peace pacts and enjoyed the
unexpected thrashing the Sandinista Front suffered in the Feb. 25
elections.
   ``All these treaties, it's us who have made them sit down to
negotiate,'' said Ivan. ``If we're taken out and the Sandinistas
keep their weapons, they can stage a coup against UNO at any time.''
   Ivan's view that the Contras will help assure the
democratization of Nicaragua is not reflected in the latest
negotiations between UNO and the Sandinista Front.
   After a month of meetings, negotiators on Tuesday announced they
had agreed to a protocol for tranferring power on April 25, when
President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro is to be inaugurated.
   The document calls on the Contras to respect the demobilization
pact and return to civilian life. It also says the Sandinistas will
turn control of the army and police over to UNO and that the forces
will be non-partisan.
   Officers now in the army and the Interior Ministry are
Sandinista Front cadres who have undergone extensive political
indoctrination.
   ``In a democratic country you can't have an army that belongs to
a party,'' Ivan protested in an interview a few hours before the
protocol was announced.
   A few miles away, another Contra combat unit came down from the
bush to a tiny shop by a dusty country road where they mingle with
local people.
   Patrol leader Caminante, a pseudonym of Juan Antonio Garcia that
means ``Walker,'' says a call by the United States for the rebels
to dismantle or face a cutoff in the U.S. aid they have received
since 1981 doesn't matter much.
   ``We've got the people behind us, and as long as we have that we
won't starve,'' he said.
   Invisible, the nom de guerre of Caminante's second-in-command,
Jose Alfredo Altamirano, says the Contras held talks with UNO
representatives in the days after the elections.
   ``We told them what we think. But one thing is what they tell us
here and another what they do over there,'' he said, referring to
Tegucigalpa, Honduras.
   Enforcement of the accord in Tegucigalpa for disbanding the
Contras depends on the will of the rebels to voluntarily give up
their weapons.
   The Contra's top military chief, Israel Galeano Cornejo _ or
Commander Franklyn _ did not sign it. Instead it was signed by his
negotiator, Oscar Sovalbarro, Commander Ruben.
   There has been speculation that this indicated there was a split
within the rebel forces.
   ``You tell me that Ruben signed the agreement. Fine. Did
Franklyn sign it? No? Well, there you go,'' Ivan said.

<HEAD>Surinamese Rebels Released After One-Day Delay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army on Wednesday freed
guerrilla leader Ronny Brunswijk and 10 of his followers, a day
after being ordered to do so by the civilian government.
   Army chief Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse, former ruler of this isolated
South American republic, announced the release of the Jungle
Commando leader Brunswijk and 10 others at a news conference at the
army general staff headquarters.
   The government of President Ramsewak Shankar had ordered the
Bush Negro rebels freed Tuesday, one day after they were arrested
by military police on drug charges. The rebels were in the capital
Paramaribo for talks with government officials on ending their
3{-year insurgency.
   Charges against Brunswijk stemmed from the Jungle Commando's
seizure on March 20 of 2,200 pounds of Colombian cocaine.
   Brunswijk said last Sunday that his men confiscated the cocaine
from a plane that took off from Cali, Colombia, and landed because
of bad weather near a rebel base in the bauxite town of Moengo.
Brunswijk said the rebels also took four Colombians into custody
and confiscated their plane.
   Two of Brunswijk's bodyguards were killed in a shootout with
soldiers during the arrest, according to government and military
authorities.
   The Jungle Commando, with 200 to 400 followers, claims to
represent Bush Negroes, descendants of runaway slaves who make up
about 10 percent of the 400,000 population.
   The group seeks economic development for Bush Negroes and an end
to alleged discriminatory practices. Fighting between the Jungle
Commando and army forces erupted in July 1986. A cease-fire
currently is in effect.
   Bouterse told reporters he had been concerned about the possible
international repercussions of freeing suspects in a drug case.
   The armed forces commander said he asked for a written order
from the public prosecutor's office and when he received that,
there was no reason to hold the rebels.
   Brunswijk, who also spoke at the news conference, said President
Shankar had ordered his arrest, contrary to reports that the
military had acted on its own. There had been speculation that
Bouterse staged the arrest to scuttle the peace negotiations or
divert attention from rumors of drug-trafficking by the military.
   Brunswijk, a former army sergeant who once served as Bouterse's
bodyguard, said he would cooperate with the government's
investigation of drug trafficking, but denied any involvement.
   Bouterse seized power in a 1980 military coup and ruled until
the election of a civilian government in November 1987. He has
continued to wield power behind the scenes, however, and strongly
opposes a tentative peace settlement that he says would allow the
insurgents to remain armed and patrol the bush regions of eastern
Suriname where they have their power base.
   Suriname, situated on the northeastern shoulder of South
America, gained independence from the Netherlands in 1975.

<HEAD>Bonn Takes Major Step to Reduce Influx of East Europeans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   West Germany took further action
Wednesday to reduce the steady influx of ethnic Germans from
Eastern Europe, saying fewer reasons existed for them to leave now
that democracy has taken root there.
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Bonn has decided
newcomers will be eligible for generous social assistance here only
if West German authorities screened them for exile status before
they leave their homeland.
   Screening up to now has been done here.
   Schaeuble said he hopes the bill will clear Parliament and take
effect June 22.
   Earlier this month, West Germany decided to end a special
assistance program for East German resettlers.
   East Europeans of German heritage have been flooding into West
Germany in the past two years, driven in recent months mostly by
hopes of improving their financial status in this well-to-do nation.
   About 380,000 ethnic Germans arrived last year. This year the
figure has already reached 99,200.
   East European exiles who can prove they have German roots are
automatically granted citizenship here.
   When they arrive, ethnic Germans are guaranteed shelter while
they seek to establish new lives and are eligible for generous
social assistance.
   Many West Germans bitterly resent the newcomers because of
increased competition for housing and jobs.
   They question West Germany's expending great sums of money on
East Europeans when political conditions in the East bloc have
dramatically improved.
   Schaeuble said on Wednesday that political conditions in a
would-be exile's homeland will play a major role in qualifying for
exile status as an ethnic German.
   ``The countries of origin (in Eastern Europe) are on the road to
democracy. In addition to improved travel possibilities, people
living there have more personal freedoms,'' he said.
   His proposed law is seen as an attempt not only to encourage
Eastern Europeans to stay home, but to cut down on the number who
come to West Germany claiming German heritage when such ties are
either slim or non-existent.
   He said West German diplomatic personnel will do the screening
in East European countries and the goal will be that ``only people
can emigrate to West Germany ... who in fact fulfill the legal
conditions.''
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's political opponents, the Social
Democrats, also favor finding ways to cut down on the stream of
East Europeans.
   On March 20, Kohl's Cabinet decided to scrap a 40-year-old
resettlement program for new East German arrivals. More than
150,000 East Germans have arrived this year and about 340,000 last
year.

   Degussa A.G., a West German firm, has agreed
to pay a penalty of $800,000 for re-exporting American metals
useful in making nuclear weapons to North Korea and four other
countries, the Commerce Department announced Wednesday.
   The other countries were Czechoslovakia, India, Italy and
Britain. The Commerce Department said this was one of the largest
penalties ever imposed for such violations.
   ``We believe the company knew that re-exporting U.S.-origin
nuclear-related materials required authorization from Commerce,''
said Dennis Kloske, undersecretary for Export Administration, in a
statement.
   ``Authorization of the shipments to India and North Korea would
have been denied.''
   Edward E. Dysan of the law firm Baker and McKenzie, which
represents Degussa in Washington, said in an interview that the
shipments had been approved by the West German government. There
was no attempt to conceal the deals and the firm does not either
acknowledge or deny that they were illegal, Dyson added. Degussa
has its headquarterers in Frankfurt, West Germany.
   The department said that in 1986 amd 1987 Degussa sent three
shipments of zirconium to North Korea, Czechoslovakia and Italy.
Zirconium is used to encase uranium rods so that they can be used
in nuclear reactors.
   It said that in 1984 and 1987 Degussa sent three shipments of
beryllium to India and Britain. Beryllium is used in designing,
fabricating and testing nuclear explosives.
   The Commerce Department statement said that in addition to
paying the penalty, Degussa has promised:
   _To maintain a special unit to see that it complies with U.S.
rules;
   _To report all deals for six months in beryllium, zirconium and
other metals of U.S. origin;
   _To permit the department to make unannounced inspections of its
special metals facilities in West Germany.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Wednesday withdrew
its request to Congress to delay $2.2 billion in Pentagon
expenditures this year, avoiding a potential dispute over the
authority of the executive branch.
   ``We are pleased to inform you officially that we no longer
intend to withhold the funds that have been deferred,'' White House
Budget Chief Richard Darman said in a letter to Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Presidents routinely ask Congres to delay billions of dollars of
planned spending each year. By law, these requests _ commonly known
as deferrals _ are permissible because of unexpected contingencies
or a chance to save money through better management. The delays are
not allowed for policy reasons.
   But the Bush administration, in making the request to lawmakers
on Feb. 6, justified the deferrals, saying, ``This proposal
reflects changes in requirements in view of promising developments
in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.''
   Byrd and Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, ranking Republican on the
appropriations committee, later complained that some of the
requests ``appear to go well beyond the permissible housekeeping
deferrals.''
   The deferrals also drew the ire of several lawmakers who favor
the particular programs that would have been affected.
   Among the deferrals were $200 million for the V-22 Osprey
tilt-rotor, which is manufactured in Texas and Pennsylvania; $593
million for construction and conversion of Navy ships, work that is
a boon to many coastal states; and $325 million for the Coast
Guard's purchase of an icebreaker.
   On Tuesday, the House Appropriations Committee had included
language in its $2.4 billion supplemental money bill disapproving
the administration's request to defer $2.2 billion in Pentagon
spending.
   Instead the panel, in talks with the Pentagon and the Office of
Management and Budget, found $1.8 billion in defense cuts that will
partly offset the cost of the supplemental.

<HEAD>Governing Party Urges Elderly Lawmakers to Retire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Nationalist Party Wednesday
urged elderly lawmakers, many in their 80s and 90s and who have not
faced re-election in four decades, to bow to popular demand and
retire.
   The statement from top party officials added new pressure on the
legislators, frozen in office since 1949 when the Nationalists lost
a civil war on mainland China. Lawmakers' terms were extended
indefinitely to support the Nationalists claim to be China's
legitimate government.
   The old-guard lawmakers, members of the Nationalist Party,
occupy 658 seats in the 752-member National Assembly, or electoral
college, part of Taiwan's tricameral parliament.
   ``This party hopes the senior legislators can understand public
demands and make a wise decision,'' said party spokesman James Chu.
   Elderly lawmakers in the assembly stirred nationwide resentment
this month by proposing large increases to their power and pay.
   They were the target of the largest demonstration in Taiwan
since martial law was lifted three years ago. The protest forced
President Lee Teng-hui to promise further political reforms.
   Chu said party officials would decide how to retire 70 senior
members from the lawmaking Legislative Yuan this year, and other
elderly legislators within two years.
   But, Chu said, the governing party continued to respect the
elderly lawmakers and the contributions they have made to the party.
   Also on Wednesday, younger members of the National Assembly
passed a resolution to expel senior colleagues who are too frail to
attend session.

<TEXT>
   Extremist groups claimed
responsibility Wednesday for the slaying of an American missionary,
who was shot to death in his south Lebanon home by masked intruders
who burst in as he prayed with his family.
   The groups accused the victim, William Robinson, of trying to
establish an Israeli settlement in south Lebanon, a predominatly
Shiite Moslem area. The Israeli government and Robinson's relatives
in his home state of Massachusetts denied it.
   Robinson, 59, had since 1983 run an orphanage for handicapped
children, called the Christian Children's Home.
   Israeli troops scoured their self-proclaimed security zone in
south Lebanon for the killers, who entered Robinson's home in
Rashaya Foukhar on Tuesday night. The village of 4,000 is inside
the security zone, about eight miles northeast of Israel's border.
   Lebanese security sources reported that the Israelis and their
militia allies raided houses and arrested an undisclosed number of
people.
   The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the three
attackers were armed with 9mm pistols equipped with silencers.
First they killed six German shepherds guarding the Robinsons' home.
   The sources quoted Robinson's wife, Barbara, as telling U.N.
investigators the men burst into the house at about 8:30 p.m. while
Robinson, his wife, four sons and 26 children from the orphanage
next door were singing bedtime prayers.
   ``Who is Robinson?'' one gunman shouted in English.
   The missionary said without hesitation: ``I am Robinson.''
   According to Mrs. Robinson, two gunmen ordered her to take the
children into her bedroom, where one assailant tied her to a chair.
   Another searched the room, took $4,000 and jewelry, the sources
said. They then tossed a sleeping gas canister into the bedroom,
knocking everyone out. An hour later, Robinson's 7-year-old son
woke up found his father's body in a pool of blood in the bathtub.
He had been shot in the neck and chest, the sources reported.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the United States ``deplores this act of terrorism against an
American citizen.''
   Ms. Tutwiler reaffirmed the U.S. position that the situation in
Lebanon is ``so dangerous for Americans'' that passports remain
invalid for travel to Lebanon.
   She said Robinson had been warned on several occasions by U.S.
government personnel to leave Lebanon. He had asked twice that his
passport be revalidated but was denied both times, she said.
   The Lebanese Communist Party claimed responsibility for his
slaying. ``His execution brought an end to schemes to plant Jewish
settlers in south Lebanon,'' it said in a statement issued
Wednesday.
   The party and its militia have carried out numerous raids on
Israeli targets, including an abortive suicide truck bombing in
southern Lebanon on April 21, 1985.
   Another claim of responsibility came from the Lebanese National
Resistance Front, an alliance of 12 leftist factions that include
the Communists. It did not specify which faction killed Robinson.
   It accused Robinson of ``seeking to establish an Israeli
settlement on Lebanese territory.'' The National Resistance Front
is made up largely of Shiite Moslems.
   Ms. Tutwiler said she had no information to corroborate the
claims that Robinson was settling Jews in southern Lebanon.
   Israeli Army Spokesman Nachman Shai's office said the
allegations of plans to settle Jews in south Lebanon, a
predominantly Shiite Moslem area, were ``totally baseless ...
without any factual content. Israel has no intention or plans to
establish settlements of these types within sovereign Lebanese
territory.''
   Unlike other Israeli-occupied Arab territories, the Israelis
have not established any settlements in south Lebanon. They have
occupied the security zone, a 6- to 10-mile-wide strip of land,
since withdrawing the bulk of their army from Lebanon in 1985,
three years after invading.
   Lebanese sources, who asked not to be identified, said Robinson
had been involved in a dispute with villagers over land on which he
wanted to expand the orphanage.
   Earlier this month, villagers petitioned the Lebanese government
to prevent Robinson from establishing what they claimed would be an
Israeli settlement on Lebanese soil.
   The petition said Robinson moved into Rashaya Foukhar's school
immediately after the Israeli army invaded Lebanon in 1982, and
that he gradually brought in relatives and Israeli friends.
   He ``seized the pine forests near Rashaya Foukhar and recently
brought in Israeli engineers to build houses for 100 families,''
mostly Jewish immigrants from the United States and Sudan, the
petition alleged.
   Scott McDonald, an announcer with the Christian-run Voice of
Hope radio station, said Robinson wanted to build a home for
elderly people in south Lebanon.
   The victim's sister, Elnora Coppolino, said Robinson had no
political motives for settling in south Lebanon.
   ``When he left here they had been bombing in southern Lebanon,
bombing the schools and the children were getting killed and he was
concerned about the children,'' said Mrs. Coppolino, speaking by
telephone from her home in Athol, Mass.
   Mrs. Coppolino said Robinson was brought up in Athol, a small
town about 50 miles from Springfield. She said her brother was a
Congregationalist and moved to Lebanon in 1978. His work in Lebanon
was not affiliated with any particular group, she said.

<HEAD>Thousands March in San Juan to Protest Telephone Co. Sale</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of union workers staged a
one-day strike and marched to the capital Wednesday to protest the
government's plan to sell Puerto Rico's telephone company for $2
billion.
   More than 60 unions representing private and public workers took
part in the general strike and what was the biggest protest
demonstration in this U.S. commonwealth in recent history.
   San Juan's Channel 24 TV station estimated the crowd at 160,000.
Organizers had said they expected 100,000. Police had no estimate.
   At one point, a line of marchers 10 to 15 abreast stretched for
more than two miles from Dos Hermanos Bridge at the entrance of the
Condado tourist district to the domed capital in colonial Old San
Juan.
   Demonstrators, many wearing bright yellow, blue, red and green
union T-shirts, were bused into San Juan from across the Caribbean
island, which has 3.3 million inhabitants.
   Protesters carried banners and signs, blew whistles and chanted
slogans as they filed by the headquarters of Gov. Rafael Hernandez
Colon's Popular Democratic Party. Plywood protected the building's
glass front, and police guarded the entrance.
   In a televised speech later, the governor called the protest
``damaging'' and ``absurd.'' He said he would not give up his plan
to sell the government-owned Puerto Rico Telephone Co.
   ``The labor and political leaders who carried out this march
want to blackmail the government and the people,'' he said.
   Hernandez Colon, elected to a second four-year term in 1988,
proposed the sale in his state of the commonwealth message Feb. 20.
   Proceeds are to be used to create two perpetual funds of $1
billion each, one for education and the other for public works
projects such as road and bridge repairs and water and sewer
improvements.
   The perpetual funds are expected to generate $85 million to $95
million a year in interest revenues.
   Critics say the governor acted without proper consultation with
opposition parties and with no assurances that jobs and employee
benefits would be protected by a new owner.
   The government acquired the telephone company from ITT Corp. in
1974 for $165 million. It now earns $70 million a year and employs
8,000 people.
   Juan Velez, president of the Communications Authority Employees
Union, one of two unions representing 4,800 telephone workers, told
a rally at the capital that legislators supporting the sale should
be turned out of office.
   ``The workers are not only here in defense of national patrimony
(state-owned assets), but also in defense of true electional
reform,'' said Velez.
   A brief scuffle broke out when protesters surged against police
lines at the foot of the capital steps, but no injuries were
reported. Otherwise, the march and rally were peaceful.
   The effects of the strike on the public were minimal, except for
huge traffic jams in the area of the march and rally. Public buses
were idle, but most schools, banks, government buildings and stores
remained open.
   Several bomb threats including one at Fort Buchanan, a U.S. army
post, were reported by police, but all proved false.
   The National Guard on Tuesday moved large electricity generators
to the governor's mansion, La Fortaleza, and the capitol in the
event of an electricity outage.

<NOTE>Eds: Updates throughout with Ryan replies to charges and
conclusion of hearing; no pickup</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Democrats on the Senate Banking Committee
sharply criticized President Bush's nominee for top savings and
loan regulator Wednesday, charging inexperience and conflicts of
interest.
   ``Every indication I have is he doesn't know anything about the
financial services industry,'' said Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., at the
start of a grueling 4{-hour confirmation hearing.
   But the nominee, T. Timothy Ryan, Jr., a former senior Labor
Department official, vigorously defended himself as an experienced
administrator and tough regulator.
   ``I think I have a reputation for moving things along,'' Ryan
said. ``I make things happen ... and I have a proven track record
in enforcement.''
   President Bush last Thursday nominated Ryan, 44, to a five-year
term as director of the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift
Supervision. The office regulates 2,600 S&amp;Ls and its director sits
on a five-member board conducting the administration's S&amp;L bailout
and insuring S&amp;L deposits.
   The committee could vote on the nomination as soon as its next
meeting April 3.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who is not a member of the
committee but attended the session, charged that conflicts of
interest between the nominee's public and private careers ``raise
basic questions about Mr. Ryan's sense of propriety.''
   Metzenbaum cited several aspects of Ryan's career after he left
the Labor Department in 1983. As the department's solicitor, Ryan
engineered a consent decree which installed an independent counsel
to oversee the Teamsters' $4 billion Central States Pension Fund.
   He helped select former Attorney General William B. Saxbe for
the job. Ryan then left government to practice law and later Saxbe
received court permission to join Ryan's law firm, bringing
thousands of dollars in fees from the pension oversight contract.
   In 1985, the Labor Department asked Ryan to resign as a member
of its Employee Retirement Income Security Act Advisory Council
after it discovered that he was also serving as counsel to a trade
group, the Employee Stock Ownership Association of America.
   Metzenbaum also criticized Ryan for sitting on the council while
a client, the Washington Business Group on Health, had an interest
in issues before it. He said Ryan should not have advised the
National Maritime Union of America on a union election the Labor
Department began investigating shortly before Ryan left government.
   In his defense, Ryan said the federal judge overseeing the
Teamsters' case concluded it was not improper for Saxbe to join his
firm. He said he never participated in employee-owned stock matters
while working for the advisory council, did not represent the
business group on the pension matter that came before the advisory
board and never dealt with the Labor Department directly concerning
the maritime union.
   Ryan also was strongly defended by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who
employed him as an aide in his last three campaigns.
   ``The president, the secretary of the Treasury and to some
extent I have been involved in this nomination and we're going to
stand by this man,'' Warner said. ``The man's tough. The man's
fair. The man's honest.''
   However, even Republicans expressed concern about Ryan's lack of
experience in the banking and savings and loan industries.
   After the Labor Department post, where he was responsible for
managing 600 attorneys in Washington and 16 field offices, Ryan
entered private law practice with the firm of Reed, Smith, Shaw &amp;
McClay. He specialized in pension and employee benefit law.
   ``What concerns me is ... you don't have the background or scope
of knowledge to try to understand what is happening out there in
the trenches,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
   Despite their misgivings, senators are under intense pressure to
confirm Ryan quickly because his appointment could remove a
constitutional challenge to the administraion's savings and loan
bailout.
   A federal judge in Washington last week ruled that the acting
director of the thrift office, Salvatore Martoche, and his
predecessor, M. Danny Wall, lacked the authority to close failed
thrifts. Wall was never confirmed by the Senate for the job.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., the chairman of the panel, said
he went along with the administration's request to schedule an
early confirmation hearing but warned Ryan that there's no
guarantee he will be confirmed.
   Complained Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., ``We're being sort of
whipsawed into rushing your nomination.''
   Some Democrats also are uneasy about Ryan's reputation as a
long-time Republican activist. He served as an aide or attorney in
presidential campaigns for Richard Nixon in 1972, Gerald Ford in
1976 and George Bush in 1988. He was a legal counsel to Ronald
Reagan's 1980 transition team.
   ``This (agency) will not be a political operation,'' Ryan said.
``I would not be part of that. I think this problem is much too big
to be treated in a political fashion.''
   The hearing was attended by S&amp;L financier Charles H. Keating,
Jr., owner of the failed Lincoln Savings and Loan Association,
based in Irvine, Calif. Its bailout is expected to cost $2.5
billion _ perhaps the costliest thrift failure in the nation.
   Keating, who was denied his request to speak to the committee,
said he did not think Ryan's qualifications were adequate.
   ``I have a distinct interest here in seeing the leadership in
this industry the best and most qualified for the job. We have a
financial interest in what happens,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A suburban couple separated two young brothers
they adopted in 1984, putting the older boy in an orphanage on
Christmas and forbidding him from seeing his brother, a public
guardian who sued the couple said Wednesday.
   ``It's every little boy's nightmare,'' said Cook County Public
Guardian Patrick T. Murphy. ``Rick's parents told him they were
going to put him into an orphanage and they did it. It's like
telling a kid you're going to send the bogey man after him and then
doing it.''
   The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Circuit Court seeks visitation
rights for the brothers and seeks $50,000 in damages for alleged
emotional harm to Rick, 11. Any money would be held in escrow for
Rick until he is 18, Murphy said.
   The couple, who live in suburban Bellwood, adopted Rick _ not
his real name _ and his brother, now 8, in August 1984 after the
boys' natural mother abandoned them.
   The parents put Rick in a nearby Oak Park orphanage last
Christmas, and received approval March 9 from Circuit Court Judge
Walter Williams to surrender their parental rights to him. The
brothers never before had been separated.
   The adoptive parents, identified in the lawsuit only as Joseph
and Pamela Doe, said Rick did not ``bond'' to them, Murphy said.
The parents said Rick ``is only out for what he can get,'' and they
prevented his younger brother from seeing him, according to Murphy.
   Murphy, whose job as public guardian is to act on behalf of
children such as Rick, said he sued instead of appealing the
judge's decision because a lawsuit would be faster and might be
more successful.
   The parents' attorney, Mary C. Martin, declined to discuss the
case Tuesday. Calls to her office Wednesday were not returned.
   Murphy said Rick is now in a temporary foster home. Rick blames
himself for the separation, the guardian said.
   He called Rick a ``normal kid'' who has never been in trouble
with the law.
   ``This is not a schizophrenic kid who is climbing the walls and
throwing feces at people,'' he said. ``He's a normal kid.''
   Murphy played a tape he said was Rick speaking of his
experience. Rick says, ``Mom and Dad were talking about something,
and they said they were going to put me up for adoption. I thought
they were kidding. They weren't.''
   Rick then apologizes to his brother for a fight the two had.
   ``This is for you,'' he said. ``Remember that day that I hurt
your nose when I beat you up? I'm sorry for that. I didn't mean it
... . I hope I get to see you again.''
   The lawsuit describes the parents as a middle-class couple who
own two small businesses.
   Murphy said the lawsuit is unusual, but only because parents
usually don't separate adopted children.
   ``Now you've got bureaucrats and judges who say it's OK,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Lujan To Look For Alternatives On North Dakota's Garrison Project</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIP BRASHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan agreed
Wednesday to look for ways to continue construction of North
Dakota's Garrison Diversion water project, which the Bush
administration wants to kill.
   ``We owe it to the ... people of North Dakota to look at the
alternatives,'' Lujan said after a closed-door meeting with the
North Dakota congressional delegation.
   Garrison, possibly the most criticized water project in the
nation, would divert Missouri River water for farm irrigation and
municipal use. Over the years it has been attacked as being too
costly and environmentally unsound.
   The project was scaled back under a 1986 agreement wtih
environmental groups that sifted the focus of the project from
irrigation to municipal water use. However, $800 million of the its
$1 billion price tag is still earmarked for building irrigation
facilities.
   The project is again in serious trouble on Capitol Hill, because
of the administration's proposal to cancel it and a recent report
by the Interior Department's inspector general that the project
probably isn't financially feasible.
   The report said the farmers who would get Garrison water for
irrigation will have to pay a larger share of the construction cost
than they can afford.
   Lujan said he agreed to form a working group representing the
congressional delegation and the administration to discuss the
options for the project.
   ``I can't tell you now how we can resolve these issues,'' he
said.
   Because of the inspector general's report, construction will
probably have to stop at least temporarily on parts of the project
that would supply water for irrigating farms, said Sen. Kent
Conrad, D-N.D.
   The inspector general's report is critical to the project
because the Interior Department must develop an acceptable plan for
allocating the construction costs before the government can sign a
repayment contract with the Garrison Diversion Conservancy District.

   Customs officials said they foiled an attempt on
Wednesday to supply Iraq with 40 U.S.-made devices for triggering
nuclear explosions, and that three people were charged.
   U.S. and British investigators worked on the case for 18 months.
   The Customs and Excise Department in a statement named the three
as Lebanese engineer Toufic Fouad Amyuni, 37; Ali Ashour Daghir,
49, a company director with dual Iraqi and British nationality; and
export executive Jeanine Celestine Speckman, 41, a Frenchwoman
married to a Briton.
   The statement said they were charged under the Export of
Prohibited Goods Control Act and will appear before Uxbridge
Magistrates Court in west London at 10 a.m. Thursday. All three
gave addresses in or near London, it added.
   Iraqi diplomats in London refused to comment on the case.
   An investigation initiated by U.S. customs climaxed in a freight
shed at London's Heathrow Airport as an attempt was made Wednesday
morning to put the devices _ which may have been dummies _ aboard
an Iraqi Airways flight to Baghdad, British customs officials said.
   Authorities said five people were arrested in and around London,
including Iraqi national Omar Latif, who was immediately served
with a deportation order, and a Cypriot with a British passport who
was released after questioning.
   In Washington, the U.S. Customs Service said sealed indictments
had already been returned at a San Diego District Court.
   After the arrests, President Bush expressed concern over the
spread of nuclear weapons in the Middle East and said in a written
statement: ``We again call upon nuclear suppliers to exercise
special restraint in providing materials related to the development
of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and intermediate-range
missiles in this volatile area.''
   While avoiding direct criticism of Iraq, Bush noted it was among
the nations that signed the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
   Customs officials in London, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the devices were capacitors, electrical components of the
detonation chain of a nuclear bomb.
   Defense experts said it demonstrated Iraq's determination to
become a nuclear power, even at the risk of being caught violating
Western bans on the export of strategic high technology.
   Indications emerged, however, that the devices deposited at
Heathrow were dummies, substituted for the real hardware as part of
the U.S. customs operation.
   British Broadcasting Corp. TV said customs officers made the
switch after the packages arrived from the United States at the
beginning of the week. Channel 4 TV News carried an interview with
the manufacturer of the so-called krytrons, who said his company
turned over dummies to U.S. customs late last year.
   ``We provided about 40 devices ... to the Customs Service and
they were deliberately made to be inoperative,'' said Don Kerr,
president of EG &amp; G in Wellesley, Mass.
   He indicated he did not know whether these were the devices that
reached London, saying: ``Basically we supplied these devices to
the Customs Service in the United States and the subsequent
movement of them is unknown to us.''
   The Home Office said Latif was to be deported because of
``attempted breaches of legislation governing the export of
strategic goods from the United Kingdom.''
   BBC-TV showed footage of the operation that it said was shot by
an NBC crew that was in on the investigation.
   NBC reported Scotland Yard detectives raided the headquarters
``of what is being described as a secret Iraqi nuclear procurement
network,'' and removed documents and other evidence.
   It quoted authorities as saying ``the man at the top of the
Iraqi operations is Ali Daghir, who was sent to London from Baghdad
almost two years ago.''
   NBC said Daghir was arrested at his office shortly after the
Iraqi flight took off.
   British officials made few formal statements about the incident.
   U.S. customs spokesman Ed Kittredge commented, ``They're
sensitive about Iraq and the number of British citizens there.''
   Kittredge mentioned Iraq's execution March 15 of Farzad Bazoft,
an Iranian reporter who was working for a British newspaper.
   Iraq accused Bazoft of spying. Britain reacted by withdrawing
its ambassador from Iraq and expelling some Iraqis, but it has been
reluctant to let relations with Baghdad worsen further. More than
10,000 Britons work in Iraq.
   The Foreign Office summoned the Iraqi ambassador to inform him
of the expulsion but refused to link the action to the alleged
smuggling operation.
   Military experts said the devices are available only to a
handful of major powers, and their export is strictly controlled.
They recalled two previous smuggling attempts, one involving Israel
and the other Pakistan, both of which have nuclear weapons
ambitions.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is known to harbor ambitions of
eclipsing Egypt and Syria as the premier military power of the Arab
world. In 1981, Israeli warplanes bombed an Iraqi nuclear reactor,
claiming it was designed to make bombs. Lately, Iraq has developed
long-range missiles thought to be capable of delivering a nuclear
warhead.
   Professor Paul Wilkinson, a Bradford University terrorism
expert, said: ``If they're trying to smuggle in these highly
sophisticated trigger devices, that means they're very serious
about making nuclear weapons, and soon.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher underlined the
need for restraint on all sides in the Lithuania crisis during a
50-minute telephone conversation Wednesday with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev, her office said.
   The phone call, arranged in advance through diplomatic contacts,
was timed to precede Mrs. Thatcher's meetings Thursday and Friday
with West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Britain and with
President Bush in Bermuda on April 13.
   Mrs. Thatcher's office gave no details on Gorbachev's response
on Lithuania but said she emphasized the need for restraint and
negotiations and expressed hope the crisis could be settled in a
way suitable to both sides.
   ``The people of Lithuania have made clear their wish to
determine their own future,'' Mrs. Thatcher said to the House of
Commons Tuesday.
   She said Britain had never recognized the 1940 Soviet annexation
of Lithuania though it was recognized ``in fact'' in the 35-nation
Helsinki accords in 1975.
   ``Undoubtedly, that is a very difficult situation, both for
President Gorbachev and for the people of Lithuania,'' Mrs.
Thatcher said.
   ``I believe that it calls for great restraint on both sides.
Force is not an appropriate way to settle the position. I hope it
will be settled by restraint on both sides and by their discussing
it so that they come to a satisfactory conclusion.
   ``That view was also taken by the 12 foreign secretaries of the
European Community,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher's spokesman, who by custom was not identified,
said the conversation also covered other world events, including
the East German elections, prospects for German unification, and
the prime minister's visit to Kiev in June.

<TEXT>
   Rep. George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich., a fiery
champion of liberal causes for nearly five decades and defense
lawyer for Communist Party members in a celebrated 1949 trial,
Wednesday announced his retirement.
   ``After 68 years of working, I'm hoping to enjoy a little time
off,'' the 80-year-old chairman of the Foreign Affairs subcommittee
on Western Hemisphere affairs said in a brief floor speech
announcing that he will not seek a sixth term.
   Crockett had announced his candidacy for re-election, but faced
at least two challengers for the Democratic nomination in his
heavily Democratic Detroit district.
   He said in an interview the prospect of stiff opposition did not
influence his change of heart. ``I've just gotten older and
wiser,'' he said.
   Crockett recently became the first member of Congress to
advocate decriminalizing drug use, the latest of many stands that
have outraged conservatives and even made some fellow liberals
uneasy.
   Born and reared in Jacksonville, Fla., he earned a law degree at
the University of Michigan and was an attorney with the Justice
Department and the United Auto Workers union.
   Judging by his courtly demeanor and mild manners, it might be
hard to believe Crockett's fiery past.
   In 1949, Crockett gained national attention for his spirited
defense of 11 communists charged with subversion in New York. His
clashes with the presiding federal judge, Harold Medina, earned him
and four other defense lawyers a four-month prison sentence for
contempt of court.
   He was elected judge in the Detroit Recorder's Court, which
handles criminal cases, in 1966 and served 12 years. He was elected
to Congress in 1980.
   As chairman of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee, he opposed
the Reagan administration's Central American policies, especially
its support of the Nicaraguan rebels.
   He was jailed overnight in 1984 after demonstrating outside the
South African embassy.
   ``He's not a person constantly seeking votes or trying to get
before the media or particularly concerned with what the polls tell
him is the popular position,'' said a Democratic colleague from
Michigan, John Conyers said. ``He's always been his own man.''
   ``He has been a gentleman and despite the fullness of his years,
he's been a very active chairman of an important subcommittee,''
said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., a member of the Western Hemisphere
panel.

   The nation's longest serving state
lawmaker, who took office when Franklin Delano Roosevelt was
president and the desk of each North Dakota legislator was close to
a spittoon, called it quits Wednesday.
   It was ``time to step aside,'' from the House seat she held for
52 years, said Brynhild Haugland, 84. Her retirement becomes
effective this December, following an election in November.
   The Minot Republican, first elected in 1938, modestly referred
to herself as ``the least of the least.''
   ``I just tried to do my best,'' Miss Haugland said. ``Serving in
the House has been a joy.''
   But legislative colleagues said Miss Haugland's gentle demeanor
and unflashy style masked political shrewdness and a steely will to
prevail on issues she held dear.
   ``She's a political genius,'' said Republican colleague Rep.
Janet Wentz. ``She was never wasteful with her power. She knew when
to use it.''
   Miss Haugland is the nation's longest-serving state lawmaker,
said Bill Pound, director of the National Conference of State
Legislatures, a Denver-based research group.
   Miss Haugland recalled the old days. ``Those spittoons would
always rattle,'' she said. ``People would inevitably kick them.''
   Rep. Rod Larson, who was vice chairman of Miss Haugland's Human
Services and Veterans Affairs committee in the last two sessions,
said the lawmaker had a knack for doing things in a quiet way.
   Miss Haugland was chairwoman of the committee for 23 of the 26
sessions she served in the Legislature, which meets in odd-numbered
years and is not in session.
   ``She just knew what she wanted to do, and she was very
up-front,'' Larson said. ``She wouldn't worry about the popularity
or unpopularity of things.
   ``If she didn't like somebody, she didn't mince words either,''
he said. ``People knew where they stood with her.''
   Gov. George Sinner declared March 18, 1987, as Brynhild Haugland
Day, and the entire House paid tribute to her service, decorating
her desk with balloons.
   The largest hearing room in the state Capitol is named for Miss
Haugland, and the last two editions of the North Dakota Blue Book,
a standard reference work on state government, have been dedicated
to her.
   ``She is an inspiration to us all,'' Sinner said Wednesday in a
statement. ``Her service to this state is unparalleled.''
   ``She is absolutely a walking history book,'' Larson said.
   For four sessions, Miss Haugland was the only woman in the
entire Legislature and for four others, she was the House's only
woman, said Ann Rathke, a Bismarck historian who is researching
North Dakota's women lawmakers.
   ``It didn't bother me,'' said Miss Haugland, who ran a dairy
farm and now rents her 800 acres of cropland on her farm two miles
northwest of Minot. ``People respect you for who you are.''

<HEAD>Man Convicted Of Planning `Snuff' Movie</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal jury on Wednesday convicted an
Alexandria man on conspiracy charges in a plot to kidnap, torture
and murder a young boy for production of a pornographic ``snuff''
movie.
   Though no youngster was ever actually kidnapped, the U.S.
District Court jury of eight women and four men found that there
was enough evidence to convict Daniel T. DePew on two charges of
conspiracy.
   DePew, 28, faces up to life in prison and will be sentenced May
27 by Judge T.S. Ellis III.
   The conviction ended 2{ days of testimony and evidence in which
violent acts were discussed in lurid detail and the lifestyles of
sadomastochistic homosexuals was revealed in court.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Smythers questioned defense
attorney James Lowe's assertion that the defendant never intended
to carry out the plan.
   ``Which child are we going to turn over to him to test, to see
if he would do it?'' Smythers asked the jury.
   DePew testified at length on Tuesday and Wednesday, claiming
that he was too intimidated to get out of the plot and said it was
``a fantasy.''
   During cross examination by prosecutors, the defendant also
admitted that he had engaged in violent homosexual activities at
the age of 12.
   He also said that the sexual activities described throughout the
trial were ``enjoyable'' to him but that he was not attracted to
young boys,
   What appeared to be a damning piece of evidence presented on
Wednesday was a video tape DePew made with his lover, Dean Lambey,
in which he described a person who wanted to ``kill boys'' while a
video camera panned a playground.
   Another video tape shown to the jury on Tuesday depicted violent
sex between the lovers.
   Smythers said in his closing summation that the video ``would
have been enough to gag a maggot.''
   Prosecutors said DePew and his partner were arrested before they
could carry out the plan, which police officers contend was real.
   DePew tesified that he talked to Lambey about the plan because
he wanted him as a sexual partner.
   During the investigation, police established a long-distance
computer relationship with the men through a computer bulletin
board for pedophiles.
   Lambey pleaded guilty last fall and is serving a 30-year
sentence.

<HEAD>Ethnic Albanians Stage Peaceful Protest in Kosovo</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo peacefully protested Wednesday on the first anniversary of
constitutional changes that curbed the autonomy of their troubled
region.
   Throughout the province, for two hours beginning at noon,
streets in towns and villages were almost empty as ethnic Albanians
stayed indoors to protest.
   The constitutional amendments gave Serbia, the largest Yugoslav
republic, near total control over Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians
comprise 90 percent of the 1.9 million population.
   ``With this silent protest we want to mark a year of repressive
and brutal policy which has to the extreme curtailed our human
rights,'' said a statement by newly formed, independent ethnic
Albanian groups that called the protest.
   March 28 was proclaimed a holiday in Serbia and was celebrated
with public festivities.
   Kosovo's Communist Party president, Rahman Morina, told The
Associated Press the ruling party will allow free elections in
Kosovo and may open a dialogue with some the new groups in the
province.
   Western human rights monitors, speaking to reporters in
Belgrade, stressed, however, that violence has increased in Kosovo
since January and dialogue seems distant.
   Karl Schwarzenberg, chief of the Vienna-based International
Helsinki Federation, said after touring Kosovo that mass arrests
there of ethnic Albanians constitute ``a frightening example of the
power of a one-party dictatorship.''
   About 60 ethnic Albanians demanding the return of autonomy have
died in clashes with security forces in Kosovo since the
constitutional changes were passed a year ago.
   Thousands have been arrested and jailed for ``separatist and
terrorist activities'' that Serbian authorities say are aimed at
taking Kosovo out from Yugoslavia to join neighboring Communist
Albania.
   Serbia says the constitutional changes were needed to protect
minority Serbs in Kosovo from harassment by ethnic Albanians.
   Heavily armed Serbian police, who last week took full control in
Kosovo, patrolled towns in the region frequently checking identity
cards of pedestrians, searching cars and sometimes arresting people.
   Veton Suroi, a leading ethnic Albanian activist and a leader of
a coalition of newly formed independent groups, said, ``We think
street protest cannot solve Kosovo's problems. The street protests
can only provide an excuse for more repression.''

<TEXT>
   TV Marti tried to resume broadcasts to Cuba on
Wednesday for a second day but Cuban authorities jammed the
transmission two minutes after it began, the State Department said.
   The Voice of America project, designed to bring news and
entertainment to Cuban viewers, remained on the air from 3:45 a.m.
to 6:45 a.m. and the signal was blocked for all but the first two
minutes, department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said.
   The Cuban government has called the experiment
``tele-aggression'' and lodged a protest with the Federal
Communications Commission after Tuesday's premiere, which also was
jammed.
   The Cuban news agency, Prensa Latina, likened the broadcasts to
a Laurel and Hardy comedy routine.
   ``After a series of falls from rooftops and broken ladders, they
are back at point zero,'' it said.
   ``What is beginning as a species of comedy of the absurd could
end in tragedy,'' a reference to the Cuban government's
characterization of the broadcasts as a possible prelude to armed
U.S. intervention on the island.
   After the current testing phase of TV Marti is over, the
administration will make a judgment as to whether the project is
technologically and legally feasible.
   The transmissions are being sent during the early morning hours
in order not to interfere with local programming.
   Wednesday's schedule included a baseball feature with former
Cincinnati catcher Johnny Bench, a tennis show with Boris Becker
and features on Albert Einstein and Hispanic contributions to
American life.
   Programming is to continue on Thursday.

   Medical experts said Wednesday they were
puzzled by reports that tranquilizers revived a man who'd spent
eight years in a vegetative state.
   ``This is so bizarre,'' Dr. Catherine Bontke of the Institute
for Rehabilitation and Research in Houston said in a telephone
interview. ``It just doesn't make sense. It doesn't fit anything I
know.''
   But the patient's doctor warned that the case was an isolated
one that should not be automatically applied to similar cases.
   ``It makes me nervous that people are going to see this as a
possibility'' for treating such patients, said Dr. Andres Kanner, a
University of Wisconsin neurologist.
   ``I think we are getting excited prematurely,'' he told a news
conference. ``Every patient is different. Why this happened with
this patient, we don't know.''
   Since the case was reported Tuesday, the university has received
inquiries about it from around the world, said University Hospital
and Clinics spokeswoman Priscilla Arsove.
   Kanner reported Tuesday that a 45-year-old man was awakened
after being injected with Valium during a routine dental procedure
March 12. The man has been awakened several times since, Kanner
said.
   The patient, a former airline pilot, was injured in a car
accident 10 years ago. He was in a coma for about three months,
then improved, but lapsed into a vegetative state about eight years
ago, Kanner said.
   The patient, whose identity was withheld at family request, was
being cared for in a nursing home when the drug was administered,
the doctor said.
   The patient is being observed at the hospital, and doctors are
experimenting to find the dose of tranquilizers that would allow
the man, who is married and has children, to leave the hospital and
return home, Kanner said.
   When medicated, the man can remain fully conscious for up to 12
hours at a time, the neurologist said. On the day he was first
revived, the man was able to walk, talk and perform complicated
math calculations, Kanner said.
   When not treated with the medication, the man returns to the
vegetative-like state, Kanner said Wednesday.
   The patient remained in that state Wednesday at the hospital,
while doctors experimented with oral administration of the drugs,
he said. But that procedure so far has not had the same effect as
when they were injected and the man woke up.
   Doctors plan to continue experimenting for a few weeks and, if
no progress is made, they will re-evaluate the situation.
   Continuous injections of the tranquilizing drugs ``has its
risks,'' including depression of the respiratory system or the
heart, Kanner said.
   A vegetative state is different from a coma because vegetative
state patients have sleeping and waking patterns, often open their
eyes and sometimes utter words, experts said.
   Kanner said Wednesday the man was in a ``vegetative-like state''
rather than a ``true vegetative state.''
   The man had some reactions that would not be characteristic of
someone in a permanent vegetative state, Kanner said. For example,
the man would sometimes pull his arm away when someone tried to
give him an injection, he said.
   Experts said the man's reaction should stimulate research and
cause doctors to re-examine some of their patients, but it probably
wouldn't have a significant immediate effect on medical practices.
   ``It must cause caregivers to be more cautious,'' said Dr.
Richard Foa of Washington, a member of the American Academy of
Neurology's Ethics and Humanity Subcommittee. ``But an anecdote
like this wouldn't alter my practice.''
   Foa said the vegetative state has been studied in recent years
as specialists try to narrow its definition.
   Usually, a persistent vegetative state patient is given that
prognosis after six months to a year. Many doctors believe the
condition justifies the removal of life-support systems, Foa said.
   ``The immediate question that arises is, `Was this individual
properly diagnosed?''' Foa said.
   Still, the Madison case will raise questions when doctors
consider withdrawing life-support systems, Foa said. ``But it
shouldn't lead to fundamental changes in the care given,'' he said.
   The case should be meticulously documented, Foa added.
   Kanner declined to comment Wednesday on his colleague's
opinions, except to say that doctors at his hospital have not
concluded why the drugs help the man.
   Kanner said Tuesday that one theory is that benzodiazepines,
such as Valium and barbituates, inhibit certain nervous system
functions and may have blocked the effects of the vegetative state.
   But Dr. Nathan Zasler, a member of the Medical College of
Virginia in Richmond, said drugs such as Valium typically would
have a worsening effect on vegetative state patients.
   ``There are no reports that I am aware of where Valium was used
to wake people up,'' Zasler said. ``Typically, what we would find
is that it would make them worse rather than better in terms of
arousal.''
   ``Lots of people are misdiagnosed,'' Zasler said. ``To me, this
sounds really bizarre, but I'm not saying it can't happen.''
   There were about 10,000 persistent vegetative state patients in
the United States in 1988, according to the American Academy of
Neurology in Minneapolis.

<HEAD>Bill Providing King Holiday Passes in Idaho</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Idaho House approved legislation
Wednesday to make Idaho the 47th state with a holiday honoring
slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   The House voted 53-27 for the bill previously passed by the
Senate. Later, the Senate accepted a House amendment that made the
holiday's complete name ``Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights
Day.''
   Final approval by the Senate was expected Thursday before the
bill goes to Gov. Cecil Andrus, who proposed the holiday.
   The bill was the subject of tortuous arguments in the
legislature last week. Opponents said their constituents didn't
care about Martin Luther King.
   ``We're told this isn't a black holiday, but yet we're also told
we can't change the name,'' said Rep. Stan Hawkins, a Republican.
``If you really have a guilt trip in mind by passing this, you're
making a mistake.''
   Rep. L. Ed Brown, also a Republican and one of the bill's
sponsors, said the decision on the bill would ``say more about
Idaho than .. about Martin Luther King.''
   ``Idaho is not the state in the Union that's going to determine
Martin Luther King's greatness,'' Brown said. ``Forty-six states
and the federal government have already done that.''
   Brown said adopting a King holiday would ``send a very special
message to future generations about how Idahoans feel about
minorities.''
   Besides Idaho, only Arizona, Montana and New Hampshire have not
adopted state holidays corresponding with the federal holiday
honoring King on the third Monday in January.
   The Idaho Legislature created a state commemorative day in 1987,
and a bill creating a state holiday died in a House committee last
year despite arguments its failure would only reinforce the
perception some have of Idaho as a haven for racists.
   Opponents said they objected to another day off for government
employees. Proponents said Idaho's economy would suffer through
lost tourism and convention business if it failed to establish the
holiday.

   The military government has arrested a
number of civilians and military officers for planning to stage a
coup, the official Sudan News Agency reported Wednesday.
   It quoted an unidentified military official as saying those
arrested ``were planning a limited movement to achieve subversive
objectives.''
   ``The situation is contained and an investigation has begun with
those involved,'' the military official said.
   He said Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan el-Bashir's government had been
monitoring their activities for four months but gave no details on
the number of detainees or when they were arrested.
   He said they included Abdul-Rahman Farrah, a retired navy
officer and a former security adviser to the disbanded Umma Party.
   The military official indicated the others also belonged to the
disbanded Umma and Communist parties.
   He said the two parties had joined 10 others and 31 trade unions
last October in signing a secret document called the National
Democratic Alliance Charter.
   The charter calls for the overthrow of el-Bashir, who seized
power in a military coup on June 30, and outlines steps to convene
a constitutional conference to end the 7-year-old civil war in the
south.
   El-Bashir dissolved all political parties, trade unions and
professional associations after the coup.
   Sudanese sources in the Egyptian capital, Cairo, said that in
the past week members of the disbanded parties had amended some
points of the charter at the request of the rebel Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   They said the changes included a stipulation that the
constitutional conference be held within six months of the
overthrow of el-Bashir, and that Sudanese and rebel troops be
combined into a single force once the war ends.
   A rebel delegation arrived in Cairo last week and met with
President Hosni Mubarak on Tuesday.
   The rebels took up arms against the government in 1983,
demanding greater autonomy and administrative and economic reforms
in the south.

<HEAD>Carter Center Poll Finds Wide Diversity Among Soviets on Key
Issues</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A poll of nearly 2,500 Soviets found them far
from united on how to reshape their society and often divided along
ethnic lines in their views of religion, the Red Army and the
Communist Party.
   The survey, released Wednesday by former President Carter's
public policy center, found a sharp divergence on the role of
government. The traditional Communist notion that the state is
responsible for everyone's well-being was favored by 46 percent,
but 45 percent said individuals should rely on themselves.
   ``Many of those who want rapid change to solve social problems
also hold the state responsible for individual well-being,'' wrote
poll analyst Ada Finifter, a Michigan State University political
science professor.
   ``Thus it is likely that there will be shifting and unstable
majorities for various reform efforts.''
   George Gerbner of the University of Pennsylvania said half of
the respondents believe most people cannot be trusted and the poor
have only themselves to blame for their predicament. Sixty percent
agreed that most people in the Soviet Union are indifferent to the
fate of others.
   ``With millions likely to be out of jobs when the convulsion
runs its full course, this will add to the volatility of the
situation,'' Gerbner said.
   The National Center for Public Opinion Research in Moscow helped
direct the poll with American researchers from the the University
of Pennsylvania, Michigan State and the Carter Center, which is
affiliated with Emory University.
   Pollsters conducted 90-minute interviews with 2,485 Soviet
citizens in their homes last November and December. No margin of
error was given. Carter called it ``the first-ever definitive poll
conducted in the Soviet Union.''
   The opinions of many respondents appeared largely influenced not
by their age, education or Communist Party membership, but by the
minority groups they belong to, the pollsters said. The Soviet
census identifies more than 100 national groups, usually identified
by their language.
   Future Soviet policies will have to take into account ``that on
the most fundamental and deeply felt questions, the peoples of the
Soviet Union inhabit vastly different worlds,'' wrote Ellen
Mickiewicz, a Carter Center fellow and political science professor
at Emory.
   However, 72 percent of those polled opposed allowing a
dissemination of opinion advocating superiority of one nationality
over another.
   Just 1 percent of residents in the Baltic republics and 6
percent of Georgians agreed that the Soviet Army always acted in
the people's interests, compared with 26 percent of Central Asians
and 29 percent of Russians, the poll showed.
   Forty-two percent of Georgians said the Communist Party never
makes decisions serving the public, compared with 6 percent of
Central Asians.
   Sixty-nine percent of respondents from Moslem-dominated Georgia
agreed that religious institutions acted in the people's best
interests, compared with 44 percent of Baltic residents, 39 percent
of Russians and 20 percent of Central Asians, the poll showed.
   ``The church has played a more active role in trying to moderate
during the recent civil strife in Georgia,'' Ms. Mickiewicz said.
   Nationally, just 26 percent of Communist Party members polled
expressed full confidence in the party and 12 percent expressed no
confidence, the poll showed.
   Fifty-four percent of Soviets defended free speech even at the
cost of political disorder while 37 percent said public order
should be more important.
   Only 11 percent of the respondents said they agreed with the
``old order'' precept of strict income equality, and 84 percent
want to permit varying incomes, pollsters said.

   A college student accused of drowning her
newborn in a dormitory toilet murdered the child because he was an
inconvenience, prosecutors said Wednesday in opening arguments.
   Tears rolled down the cheeks of 18-year-old Claire Moritt as
Assistant State Attorney Joan Richardson denied the defense's
contention that Ms. Moritt had gone temporarily insane.
   ``This is a girl who chooses to deny or replace those things she
feels are unpleasant,'' said Ms. Richardson. ``When she could not
wish this baby away, could not deny it _ she killed it.''
   If convicted of first-degree murder, the Hillsborough Community
College student from Hollywood would automatically be sent to
prison for life, with no chance of parole for 25 years.
   The jury also could decide Ms. Moritt is guilty of a lesser
degree of homicide.
   In graphic detail, attorneys recounted how the early morning
darkness of Oct. 23 was punctuated by the cries of a baby in Ms.
Moritt's high-rise dormitory suite.
   When the cries continued, roommates pounded on her bathroom door
and demanded to know what was wrong. Ms. Moritt replied she was not
feeling well.
   Once inside, they found Ms. Moritt naked, on her knees and
surrounded by blood. They took her to the hospital and returned to
find the 6-pound, 9-ounce baby boy, swathed in a sheet, face-down
in the toilet.
   The prosecution called two of Ms. Moritt's dormitory suite
mates, who described helping their bleeding friend down three
flights of stairs to take her to the hospital, and returning to
find the baby.
   Prosecutors characterized the defendant as an upper middle-class
child who was spoiled and preoccupied with what others thought of
her.
   ``Claire is not unlike women you hear about who ... give birth
to healthy babies and throw them in a trash dump to get rid of
them,'' Ms. Richardson told the jury. ``But she didn't make it to
the trash dump.
   ``There were too many people around. In a panic she had to do
something, and she chose to wrap that baby in sheets and stuff it
head-first in a toilet.''
   Defense attorney B. Anderson Mitcham described his client as a
good student who had never been in trouble before, and only
realized she had given birth when told by a social worker at the
hospital.
   Ms. Moritt never realized she was pregnant, maintained her
normal weight and had regular menstrual periods, Mitcham said,
adding that she still has no recollection of going into labor or
giving birth.
   The defense attorney said 10 psychologists and psychiatrists who
examined Ms. Moritt found she was temporarily insane at the time of
the birth, suffering from a dissociative disorder in which she
refused to acknowledge the pregnancy.
   ``In simple terms, she could not adhere to what's right and she
could not refrain from what's wrong,'' Mitcham said.
   Mitcam also implied that the child found in the toilet may not
have been dead when he was found. The newborn was taken to the
hospital in a sealed plastic bag, but doctors spent a half-hour
trying to revive the infant, he said.

   The sister of an American missionary
killed by masked assassins at his home in Lebanon said Wednesday
she is watching the news, waiting by the telephone and trying to
get in touch with his wife.
   ``I would like to know that the children are all right,'' said
Elnora Coppolino, elder sister of slain missionary William
Robinson. ``I would like to know if she wants to go home now. I
would like to see them come home.''
   Two Lebanese extremist groups Wednesday claimed responsibility
for Robinson's assassination, saying they were trying to prevent
him from establishing an Israeli settlement in south Lebanon.
   Mrs. Coppolino said her brother, a Congregationalist, was only
interested in running his 7-year-old orphanage, the Christian
Children's Home for disabled children.
   ``He had a very strong faith in the Lord and he thought it was
God's will that they go over there and do what they could for those
people. Whatever happened would be God's will,'' Mrs. Coppolino
said in a telephone interview from her home in Athol, about 50
miles north of Springfield.
   She said she had no inkling that her brother was not welcomed by
his neighbors.
   ``He said they were very friendly. I have lots of reports that
came back from different people. I have copies of letters that are
written in Arabic and different things about the good work that
he's done over there,'' she said.
   She said Robinson began by opening a home for orphans and later
took in children who were disabled or injured.
   Family members worried about Robinson's safety, but he was
determined to stay, she said.
   ``When he left here they had been bombing in southern Lebanon,
bombing the schools and the children were getting killed and he was
concerned about the children,'' Mrs. Coppolino said.
   The assassins broke into Robinson's house Tuesday night while he
was singing bedtime prayers with his American wife, four sons and
26 other children from his orphanage, Lebanese security sources
told U.N. investigators.
   The Robinsons had last written home in February, with a letter
from Robinson's wife, Barbara.
   ``She said `Bill is good, busy every day.' She said there was a
lot of fighting in the north of them. And sometimes some of the
shells came down that way, but that's not unusual; they were all
OK,'' Mrs. Coppolino said.
   Robinson, 59, was brought up in Athol and served four years in
the Marines, his sister said. He studied electronics in the service
and worked on television cable systems in Athol and Pittsfield
before moving to California and Illinois.
   Because he could not get a visa, Robinson entered Lebanon from
Israel in 1978, Mrs. Coppolino said.
   She said he worked for two years to support the orphanage he
founded in 1983, but for the last five years had relied on
donations from several countries, including Italy and Norway.
   Mrs. Coppolino said Marine Col. Richard Higgins, who later was
captured and believed to be executed, had visited the orphanage and
congratulated Robinson on his work.

<TEXT>
   A 6-year-old boy who underwent a lung transplant
eight days ago died from a bacterial infection Wednesday, a
hospital spokesman said.
   Danny Beard died at 11:18 a.m. after his immune system rejected
the lung he received in an operation March 20 at The Children's
Hospital, said spokesman Phil Lotane.
   The boy's parents, William and Kathryn Beard, were at his
bedside when he died.
   The boy had been in critical condition since the operation, and
had been hooked to a lung machine since Feb. 25, when a mysterious
virus attacked his lungs.
   A bacterial infection started in Danny's bloodstream and spread
through his body, said Dr. James Fackler, director of the
hospital's multi-disciplinary intensive care unit.
   ``With any organ transplant, the body recognizes the new organ
as foreign,'' Fackler said in a statement. ``We had to go to
extraordinary lengths to suppress Danny's reaction to his new
lung.''
   Anti-rejection drugs often leave transplant patients more
susceptible to infection.
   The hospital said last week that the donor was a child from New
England, but gave no other details.

   A handwritten manuscript crisscrossed by
revisions has yielded a previously unpublished short story by
Ernest Hemingway that probably was his last, the professor who
deciphered the work said Wednesday.
   ``It's very exciting,'' said Donald Junkins, who teaches English
at the University of Massachusetts. ``I'm positive that this is the
last short story that Hemingway ever wrote.''
   Junkins titled the story after the first five words of the
manuscript: ``Philip Haines Was a Writer.''
   Solving the riddle was a painstaking process that began two
years ago when Junkins began studying two handwritten manuscripts
that were among Hemingway papers given to the John F. Kennedy
Library in Boston in 1980. He discovered one was the beginnings of
a novel that was scrapped; the second used the same plot for a
short story.
   Decoding the revisions scrawled all over the papers took hours,
Junkins said.
   The professor said he picked up on clues to the story while on
vacation in Bimini, the setting of Hemingway's ``Islands in the
Stream,'' a book about a painter called Thomas Hudson.
   ``As I wrote and as I kept writing I knew that I had a story but
I didn't know if I had an ending. That's the big thing. That was
the exciting part of it,'' Junkins said.
   ``I was swimming on Thomas Hudson's beach. Here I am and I've
got this story,'' he said. ``I just went very slowly.''
   The story is scheduled for publication in the April issue of
``The Hemingway Review,'' published by the English department of
Ohio Northern University.
   ``We're pleased with ourselves, but you can't blame us,'' said
editor Charles Oliver, who enjoyed the new story although, unlike
Junkins, he didn't think it was one of Hemingway's best. ``It's a
lot of fun to be able to publish a new Hemingway short story even
though we know it isn't as good as his best work.''
   ``It really does tell a fascinating story about the writer. We
really see his mind at work,'' Oliver said.
   Also in the new issue is a second unpublished work of
Hemingway's, an incomplete story called ``A Lack of Passion'' that
was researched by Susan Beegel, an independent scholar who lives on
Nantucket island, Oliver said.
   Beegel said she went looking for the 1920s story about a
frightened bullfighter in Pamplona, Spain, after finding a
reference to the story in the non-fiction work ``Death in the
Afternoon.''
   Beegel said the story is remarkable because it deals with a
frightened, impotent character as opposed to the macho heroes who
people Hemingway's best-known works.
   ``It's going to help change the way people think about
Hemingway,'' she said.
   Hemingway, who killed himself with a shotgun in Idaho in 1961,
won a Nobel Prize for literature.
   The Haines story, is set in Paris and explores how the title
character throws away a marriage for a doomed relationship.
   Junkins said Hemingway started to write a novel on that theme,
but then stalled.
   ``It's a man who is in the process of divorcing his wife, and
his girlfriend has gone back to America to wait out the divorce and
he can't write,'' Junkins said.
   The 31-page short story apparently had been mistaken for an
earlier version of the unfinished novel, Junkins said.
   The material appears to date from about 1959, toward the end of
Hemingway's life, said Junkins, who matched cafe descriptions with
those in the vignettes that were posthumously published as ``A
Moveable Feast.''
   Junkins said he believes there are several reasons why Hemingway
did not finish the novel.
   ``For one thing, all the tension in the story comes from the
fact that in the novel the girl in America will not come back to
Paris. The point is if she comes back, what's going to happen. The
novel cannot go anywhere the way he set it up.''

   Assailants in a speeding car hurled a
grenade that wounded three soldiers in a Manila suburb, police said
Thursday.
   Police Cpl. Rogelio Millare said the soldiers were standing near
their patrol car when attacked Wednesday night in Pasig.
   The unidentified attackers escaped. Their motive was unknown,
but the assault occurred on the eve of the 21st anniversary of the
Communist New People's Army.
   Police have been on alert in the capital. At least nine people,
including a lieutenant colonel, died during the past week in
attacks in the Manila area that were blamed on rebels.
   On Wednesday, the military reported that its troops destroyed a
heavily fortified Communist rebel training camp in two days of
fighting that left 59 insurgents and one soldier dead.
   Armed forces spokesman Col. Juanito Rimando said 23 soldiers
were wounded as 1,200 soldiers stormed the camp Sunday in the
remote mountain town of Lianga in Surigao del Sur province, about
540 miles southeast of Manila.

   A Navy pilot died when his Korean
War-era jet fighter went down in the Mojave Desert Wednesday, and
two soldiers were seriously injured in a New Mexico helicopter
crash, authorities said.
   The single-seat QF-86 Sabre went down about 10:30 a.m. PST

National Monument, about 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles, said
base spokeswoman Loretta King. The cause was unknown.
   The Navy keeps the 1950s-vintage QF-86 Sabres at China Lake for
use as pilotless drones for air-to-air target practice. They also
are flown for routine training, King said.
   The pilot's identity was withheld pending notification of

   He had no information on what caused the crash, which occurred
as the helicopter was passing over a bombing range in preparation

   Cold fusion equipment used by a University of Utah
chemist who claimed to harness the power of the sun in a lab jar
didn't produce any nuclear energy, said a physicist at the school
who tested the apparatus.
   ``We did not see a peep,'' said Michael H. Salamon, who measured
the nuclear output of cold fusion gear in the lab of Stanley Pons
for five weeks.
   ``There was not an iota, not a sniff, of conventional fusion
occurring. We saw no neutrons or gamma rays that could be
attributed to a fusion process.''
   His findings appear to be another blow to the already widely
questioned announcement last March of a revolutionary new source of
energy.
   But one backer of cold fusion said the new findings fail to
prove anything because Pons' equipment was not working properly
when Salamon tested it.
   Salamon said his measurements, published in Thursday's issue of
the British journal Nature, were made at Pons' invitation. He
conducted the tests last May and June, about two months after Pons
and Martin Fleischman of the University of Southampton in England
announced they achieved fusion at room temperature in simple
laboratory equipment.
   Pons responded, ``It's pretty distressing, because most of the
allegations in the paper are not true.''
   In a telephone interview Wednesday from Salt Lake City, Pons
said the physicists ignored energy cells that were producing large
amounts of heat and instead set up their monitoring equipment to
check ones that were making only low amounts. He said the sensors
were also placed at an angle that missed evidence of nuclear
activity.
   Pons said Salamon's team was in the laboratory ``for political
reaons.''
   ``They were embarrassed by this,'' he said. ``They were
embarrassed that a chemist had fallen into a nuclear reaction so
simply. Their outside colleagues were putting tremendous pressure
on them.''
   Pons also accused Nature of trying to undermine his work by
publishing negative studies while ignoring supporting evidence.
   Others, however, viewed Salamon's paper as one more reason to be
skeptical.
   ``It's another nail in the coffin,'' commented Ronald Parker,
director of the plasma fusion center at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. ``They did a very careful search for fusion effects,
and they came up empty.''
   Fritz G. Will, director of the state-funded National Cold Fusion
Institute at the University of Utah, said small changes in
experimental conditions, including humidity, can affect whether or
not Pons' fusion cells produce heat.
   At the time Salamon checked the equipment for signs of fusion,
Will said, ``experimental conditions prevailing in those
experiments were not suitable to finding the phenomenon.''
   Pons' equipment consisted of a palladium electrode wrapped in
platinum and immersed in a flask of deuterium oxide, or heavy
water. When electricity is run through the metals, proponents say,
deuterium atoms fuse, giving off more heat than the energy put in.
   Nuclear fusion powers the stars. Traditionally scientists have
believed that fusion could occur only at extremely high
temperatures. Cool, small-scale fusion would provide a convenient,
limitless source of power and be one of the greatest scientific
discoveries of all time.
   Pons' and Fleischman's seeming breakthrough was questioned when
researchers in other labs had trouble duplicating their results.
While many scientists say they doubt cold fusion exists,
experiments continue at labs around the world.
   Cold fusion, if it occurs, is likely to produce heat, extra
tritium and specific patterns of neutron and gamma ray releases
known as nuclear signatures.
   ``Nintey-five percent of those researchers who have tried to
find anomalous effects, whether excess heat or nuclear signatures,
have come up empty-handed,'' Will said.
   ``The mere fact that a large percentage of scientists have
failed to confirm does not mean that the phenomenon that has been
confirmed by 5 percent is incorrect. The burden is on those who
haven't found it to change their experimental conditions so they
find it also,'' he said.
   Will said 20 labs experimenting with cold fusion have produced
excess heat, about a dozen have found large tritium counts and ``at
least a handful'' have seen signs of neutron release.
   Salamon set up sensors for gamma rays that would be discharged
when neutrons produced by the nuclear process hit the water bath
that surrounded the fusion cells.
   Salamon said he had planned to study Pons' records of heat
produced by his fusion cells to see how they matched up with the
detection of gamma rays. However, he said Pons later refused to
turn over the records.
   During the five weeks of study, Salamon's equipment was out of
service for a two-hour period because a lightning strike knocked
out the power.
   Salamon said Pons later told him that the fusion cells produced
excess heat during this time. However, Salamon said he could find
no residual signs of a neutron burst that would have lingered for
several days.

<HEAD>Kentucky Senate Passes Bill to Overhaul School System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES WOLFE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state Senate on Wednesday approved an
overhaul of the school system, funded with a $1.26 billion tax
increase, that is designed to boost Kentucky's ailing schools into
the nation's front ranks.
   The bill is ``a do or die effort for elementary and secondary
education in this state,'' said Majority Floor Leader Joe Wright, a
driving force behind its passage.
   The 946-page bill, which would repeal and rewrite all Kentucky
laws dictating how public schools are run, passed by a 30-8 vote.
It goes back to the House, where it originated, for action on
Senate amendments.
   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson, elected in 1987 on an education
platform, said the 1990 General Assembly would leave a ``legacy of
education reform.''
   ``For once we'll be able to point to something other than a
basketball team and say we're No. 1,'' said Sen. Nelson Allen,
chairman of the Senate Education Committee.
   Most of the programs foreseen in the bill can be found in
various school districts around the country.
   But passage of the bill would provide the only statewide school
system that draws together an array of motivational programs that
provide special help for problem children and reward schools'
performances, said David Hornbeck, a Washington, D.C., consultant
who was one of the bill's main architects.
   Kentucky currently ranks near the bottom in most educational
categories.
   The legislation was produced under pressure of a state Supreme
Court ruling last year that Kentucky's school system was
unconstitutional because children in poor counties were denied a
quality education.
   The bill would pump millions into the state's poorest districts,
increase teacher pay and provide cash rewards for improving schools
while punishing those with declining standards.
   Schools would be judged by the success of their students and
given regulatory freedom to reach their goals. Control of the
system would shift from an elected state superintendent to an
appointed education commissioner.
   The new system would emphasize early childhood education,
eliminate graded classrooms until the fourth grade and target
potential dropouts for extra help.
   If the General Assembly gives the new system time to work,
refraining from changes for six to eight years, ``I earnestly
believe we can make a total reform of the school system,'' said
David Karem, a Democratic sponsor of the bill.
   The bill would be financed out of a penny increase in the sales
tax rate, elimination of several individual income-tax deductions
and a 1 percent hike in corporate income taxes.
   The Senate amended the bill to eliminate the state deduction for
federal tax payments. The House version would have phased it out,
granting a $2,000 deduction for 1990 and $1,000 for 1991.
   No one likes taxes, ``but we all like education,'' said Sen. Pat
McCuiston, a leading Democrat. ``We all realize the necessity of it
and, therefore, we have to pass the financing that goes along with
this school package.''
   Republican Floor Leader John Rogers voted against the bill and
predicted retribution at the polls. ``The taxpaying voter will
never forget what you did to him here,'' said Rogers, a Republican.

<HEAD>Rebel Threats, Bombs Keep Bus Drivers Home in Peru; Traffic

<TEXT>
   The government said Wednesday's ``armed
strike'' called by Maoist rebels was a flop, but transportation
snarls cropped up throughout the capital when bus drivers stayed
home in fear of guerrilla reprisals.
   At least 20 bombings rocked Lima overnight, including three car
bombings, as the Shining Path movement stepped up its violence in
an attempt to frighten Peruvians into boycotting national elections
scheduled for April 8.
   Government, labor and business representatives contacted by The
Associated Press said most workers showed up for work, but no
figures were available.
   ``The armed strike was a complete failure,'' Labor Minister
Wilfredo Chau said.
   Private bus drivers bowed to rebel threats and stayed off the
streets, however, causing serious public transportation backups.
Thousands of workers trying to reach their jobs lined up to catch
the few public buses operating.
   An armed strike is a general strike called by the rebels that
carries the threat of violence against those who ignore it.
   The last armed strike took place Nov. 3, nine days before
nationwide municipal elections. It did not receive much support
although bus drivers stayed off the streets in the early hours of
the strike.
   Bomb explosions hit police stations, banks, campaign offices and
other targets around the capital during Tuesday night. Police
reported one person injured and extensive damage.
   Officers said two other car bombs were deactivated Tuesday
night, including one set to go off at Lima's international airport.
   David Quintana, president of a private bus drivers union, said
Tuesday night that many drivers received written death threats at
their homes from the guerrillas.
   He said drivers were ready to stay off the streets on election
day if the government did not provide protection.
   The government issued a decree Wednesday giving a two-hour grace
period to workers who arrived late due to the bus shortage.
   Last week, the government put Peru's 80,000 police on alert and
declared a state of emergency in the capital due to guerrilla
violence.
   The decree came after rebels killed four congressional
candidates in five days.
   More than half of Peru's 22 million people live in areas
affected by states of emergency, including Lima's 7 million
residents.
   Shining Path began fighting Peru's elected governments in 1980.
The government says more than 18,000 people have died in the
violence.

   A federal judge Wednesday refused to block the
scheduled execution next week of a man who murdered two teen-agers,
bringing him one step closer to becoming the first person executed
in California in 23 years.
   Barring a last-minute stay, Robert Alton Harris, 37, would go to
the gas chamber Tuesday.
   ``Not only do I decline to intervene, but I, myself, have
concluded that this defendant has had his day in court like no
other defendant,'' U.S. District Judge William B. Enright said
after hearing arguments by Harris' attorneys and state prosecutors.
   ``Citizens of this state are entitled to due process, also. They
deserve no more than that, but they deserve not one bit less,''
Enright said. ``Capital punishment is the law of this state. It has
been repeatedly ... validated by the citizens of this state.
   ``If the courts are to have any validity at all, they must be
capable of instituting final judgment,'' he said.
   Defense attorneys Charles Sevilla and Michael McCabe said they
would renew their appeal by filing a petition in the U.S. 9th
Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Thursday morning.
   Should that petition fail, the final avenue remaining would be
the U.S. Supreme Court, which has denied Harris' appeals four times.
   Enright said he had reviewed papers filed in the case, as well
as the transcript of Harris' 1979 trial, penalty phase and appeals.
He said he found nothing to uphold defense attorneys' claims that
Harris received inadequate defense counsel or that psychiatric
experts examining Harris gave incompetent evaluations.
   ``At every critical point, the defendant was given the
benefit,'' Enright said. ``Facts are facts. Facts are the bedrock
of any trial and the facts in this case are egregious.''
   The judge, while praising McCabe and Sevilla for their
determined litigation efforts, said he was disturbed they had
resorted to attacking the professionalism and competency of Harris'
trial attorney, as well as some psychiatric experts.
   Enright said his review of the record showed just the opposite
and cited Harris' own statements agreeing that he had received
excellent representation from his trial attorney, Thomas Ryan.
   In arguments preceding the judge's decision, Sevilla claimed the
defense had been denied state funds to hire psychiatric experts to
pursue their theory that brain damage contributed to the violent
behavior that culminated in the July 1978 shootings of John Mayeski
and Michael Baker, both 16.
   Harris had abducted the boys at gunpoint from a drive-in
restaurant as they sat in their parked cars. He forced them to
drive to a remote area where he shot them so he could use their car
in a bank robbery.
   Sevilla also claimed that Harris' abusive childhood and his
mother's heavy drinking during her pregnancy with him exacerbated
Harris' mental disorders. Sevilla challenged the evaluation of a
state mental health expert who characterized Harris as a sociopath
incapable of remorse or rehabilitation.
   Deputy Attorney General Louis Hanoian said there was nothing new
in the petition and that all the issues raised in it had been fully
litigated.
   ``They've just slapped a new label on it,'' he said.

   The Sandinistas have agreed to cede
control of the army and police in a preliminary agreement with
advisers to President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro on
transferring power.
   The agreement, reached late Tuesday, stresses that the
demobilization of the Contra rebels is crucial if a civilian
government led by Mrs. Chamorro is to take over from the
Sandinistas on April 25 as scheduled.
   Dismantling of the rebel force that once had strong U.S. backing
``constitutes an essential element for creating the climate of
peace, stability and tranquility in which the transfer of
government should take place,'' the agreement says.
   The heads of the transition teams signed the preliminary
agreement after a month of negotiations. Mrs. Chamorro defeated
President Daniel Ortega in free elections on Feb. 25.

   Federal aviation authorities will no longer
fine airlines for safety violations if the carriers find the
problem themselves, quickly correct it and report it to the
government.
   Federal Aviation Administration chief James B. Busey announced
the new policy Tuesday at a luncheon with airline officials. An
industry spokesman applauded the policy change, but a pilots' group
cautioned against a falldown in FAA enforcement.
   Busey acknowledged that his agency, which monitors safety at
airports used by U.S. carriers throughout the world, doesn't have
enough manpower to catch every violation. He said airlines have the
responsibility to audit their own safety.
   ``We cannot police every aspect of the industry, cannot crawl
through the belly of every aircraft, look over the shoulder of
every pilot, or personally screen every passenger and every piece
of luggage that flies in the system,'' the FAA administrator said.

   Cuba is expected to take additional measures
against the United States in retaliation for U.S.-sponsored
television programming to the island, producing further setbacks to
the already strained relationship.
   After Cuban authorities jammed the initial broadcasts of TV
Marti on Tuesday, the State Department expressed regret but said
transmissions will continue.
   The emphasis was on entertainment as testing began, but a
primary goal of the station is to provide objective news to a
country that the administration says has received none in 31 years.
   The station is a pet project of conservative elements of the
Cuban exile community in Florida, and Cuban officials have told
U.S. diplomats that exiles may be a target of Cuban retaliation.

   Prosecutors intend to use a pair of
gasoline-soaked sneakers and a hunk of dance floor to help make
their case against a man charged with setting the fire that killed
87 people in a social club.
   A grand jury Tuesday began hearing evidence against 36-year-old
Julio Gonzalez, charged with 87 murders in the blaze at the Happy
Land Social Club in the Bronx. Police said he set the fire early
Sunday after being snubbed by an ex-girlfriend who worked there.
   ``We'll have a made case even if he backs out of the
confession,'' said Edward McCarthy, spokesman for the Bronx
prosecutor's office.
   The club had been ordered closed for fire and safety code
violations and the landlord was trying to evict the owner for
non-payment of rent.

   Eight years after an auto accident left him
in a vegetative state, a man given a tranquilizer in a dentist's
office fell asleep, woke up and started to speak. Soon he could say
his name, walk and feed himself, a doctor says.
   Dr. Andres Kanner, a neurologist with the University of
Wisconsin Hospital, said Tuesday it's a mystery why tranquilizers
awakened the man.
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Kanner said. ``It was just luck he
had to have some dental work and it was just luck they administered
the drugs.''
   The patient, identified only as a Wisconsin man in his mid-40s,
had been in a vegetative state, not a coma: His eyes were open and
he occasionally uttered words, but he could do nothing else, the
doctor said in an interview Tuesday.

<HEAD>`America's Funniest Home Videos' Looks To The Mailbags</HEAD>

   Mailbags stuffed with fainting brides,
singing dogs, polka-dancing chickens and raids into the privacy of
the shower arrive daily at the busy shop that produces ABC's
surprise hit, ``America's Funniest Home Videos.''
   Programmers _ and analysts of what the television audience wants
to see _ are agog at the reaction to the half-hour Sunday show,
which has host Bob Saget introducing and narrating clips from home
videos sent in by viewers.
   Network television, which has lost viewers steadily over the
past decade due in part to the advent of videocassettes, has found
a way to bite back.
   The midseason replacement series reached No. 1 in the A.C.
Nielsen ratings for the second week of March, and a one-hour rerun
special knocked venerable ``60 Minutes'' out of the Top 10 slot. It
also has mugged ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   In the cramped warren of rooms at ABC where ``American's
Funniest Home Videos'' is made, executive producer Vic Di Bona
oversees a hustling young staff of 70.
   They have learned, this weary-eyed crew, some amazing trivia
about America:
   _ There are still plenty of outhouses in this country, just
waiting for someone with a Camcorder to kick open the door and
astound the occupant. And spouses like to surprise each other in
the shower with a video camera.
   _ There also are more folks than you realize who can make their
bunched-up bellybuttons whistle out a tune.
   _Nearly every kid in the nation sticks their face and hands into
their first birthday cake.
   The mailbags, bringing up to 1,800 tapes a day, are ``America's
Funniest Home Videos''' lifeline.
   ``This is a show that is truly hand to mouth,'' said Di Bona.
``If the country ain't funny, I ain't funny.''
   Di Bona said his weekly show costs around $400,000. His material
is free, but he claims his staff and equipment costs are
considerably higher than other half-hour shows.
   He estimates, for example, that the video machines purchased a
few months ago are about to wear out. And because the tapes are of
private events, clearances have to be obtained from featured
characters before it can run.
   But the cost still is about half the estimated $800,000 a week
needed to produce a Top 10 series like ``The Cosby Show'' or
``Cheers,'' even with the $10,000 awarded to the funniest home
video each week.
   ABC's censors have so far squelched just two of the clips Di
Bona submitted. A youngster applying the nozzle of a running vacuum
cleaner to his face was nixed, as was one of a baby crawling with a
clear plastic mixing bowl over his head _ too close to the eyes and
nose, censors said.
   Efforts to stage events are so poorly done that they have always
been spotted, staff members say.
   A clip gets on the show after being viewed by a screener, who
grades it on a scale from one to 10, with those with a five or
below eliminated. The others are viewed by an assistant producer
and move up the line before being selected. Most segments zoom
along with pratfalls, snaky garden hoses, upchucking babies and
brides tossing wedding bouquets into the twilight zone, but the
producers are trying to pace the show with some longer pieces.
   A 90-second clip, for example, showed a couple married for 43
years arguing over singing a favorite song. The wife comes from
behind the camera and joins her husband to warble the tune as a
duet.
   Di Bona bought the rights to the format from a show in Japan,
but said its appeal is ``a little bit of Warner Bros. cartoons, a
lot of Three Stooges, a little bit of Keystone Kops.''
   The low cost, high ratings and easy-to-copy formula assure
competition. Plans were announced last week for a syndicated show
called ``The $1 Million Video Challenge.''
   Di Bona, a television veteran of 22 years whose previous credits
include ``Entertainment Tonight,'' is building his fortress now.
   ``We're at the vanguard,'' he says. ``We have really set the
stage for all of this, and we realize that there are people who are
trying to copy and will copy us. We are making very sure that they
are going to have a tough time doing it.''
   He said that he has sown up deals for shows with ``America's
Funniest Home Video's'' format in England, Australia, Scandinavia
and Germany and smaller markets like Thailand and Saudi Arabia.
Negotiations are under way for a show in France.
   The deals include exchanges of video clips with the foreign
shows, one method to keep the series fresh. Another, suggested by
ABC entertainment chief Robert Iger, is ``Assignment America,''
with Saget asking the audience to send in such items as magic
tricks and first haircuts.

<HEAD>African-American' Gaining Currency as Replacement for Black</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lenda cq in 1st graf.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MITCHELL LANDSBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   It was last June, when she began work at the Museum of
African-American History in Detroit, that Lenda Jackson
unconsciously began to change the way she defined herself. Instead
of black, she started saying African-American.
   ``I consider myself a black woman, but African-American just
sounds better to me,'' says Ms. Jackson, the museum's public
relations director. ``African-American is just more descriptive of
what we are. No one is really black, like the color black.''
   Many black Americans have come to that conclusion in recent
years, especially since the Rev. Jesse Jackson proposed a change in
terms of reference. African-American appears to be gaining currency
as the term of choice for many blacks and shows signs of seeping
into the culture at large.
   In addition to Jackson, it is used by New York Mayor David
Dinkins, Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson, Rep. William Gray of
Pennsylvania, tennis star and author Arthur Ashe and novelist
Ishmael Reed. Oprah Winfrey has referred to herself as ``a colored
girl who became a Negro, then black, then African-American.''
   President Bush, in mourning the death in December of black
choreographer Alvin Ailey, called him ``a man committed to weaving
his African-American heritage into our nation's cultural tapestry.''
   It has become the preferred term at some radio stations and
black newspapers, including the New York Amsterdam News and The
Atlanta Voice, and on college campuses and in scholarly
publications.
   ``It's fashionable now to be known as African-American,'' Ms.
Jackson said, ``just as in the '70s it was fashionable to be called
Afro-American or black _ which was preferable to Negro, just as
Negro was preferable to colored.''
   In one sentence, that more or less sums up a century of
linguistic history _ one rife with politics, bigotry and deep
emotion. Just as one can date a tree from its rings, one can
roughly judge the age of a black organization from its title: the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (1909),
the United Negro College Fund (1944), the Congressional Black
Caucus (1971).
   Now add to the list the African American Summit (1989). It was
at this conclave of black leaders in New Orleans last April that
Jackson made a speech in which he called for a change from black to
African-American.
   The change was first proposed the previous December at a meeting
in Chicago to lay the groundwork for the summit. Ramona H. Edelin,
president of the National Urban Coalition, suggested that blacks
needed a greater sense of their history. One way to start, she
said, would be to call themselves African-Americans.
   The term was already gaining use, especially in academic
circles. Ms. Edelin's idea was enthusiastically adopted.
   ``To be called African-American has cultural integrity,''
Jackson explained at the Chicago meeting. ``It puts us in our
proper historical context. Every ethnic group in this country has a
reference to some land base, some historical culture base.
African-Americans have hit that level of cultural maturity.''
   Surveys conducted since then have shown that the term has been
accepted by at least a sizeable minority of blacks.
   In polls last March and April by Time magazine and the Chicago
Tribune, 26 percent of the black respondents said they preferred
African-American. Sixty-one percent in the Time poll said they
preferred black; in the Tribune poll, only 40 percent said they
preferred black, and 31 percent said either term was fine.
   In May, the San Diego school district surveyed black pupils,
parents and civic leaders to determine which term they preferred.
Forty-one percent of the students, 49 percent of their parents and
70 percent of local leaders said they preferred African-American.
   As a result of the survey, San Diego schools now use
African-American instead of black in their lessons and official
paperwork.
   ``I frankly am astonished at how quickly it's been received,''
Ms. Edelin said. ``Some people never liked black, because you may
have noticed that African-Americans come in every shade in the
universe. Black was always confusing for some children. ... This
obviates all that confusion, and also hopefully will get us past
some internecine wars over shades of color.''
   In contrast to the change from Negro to black two decades ago,
little rancor surrounds the emergence of African-American. It is
not associated with a radical political movement, as black was, and
has never been used as a putdown, as black once was. A variation,
Afro-American, has a long history as a respectable term for blacks.
   At NAACP headquarters in Baltimore, spokesman James Williams
said many officials use the terms African-American and black
interchangeably. The organization's official position is that usage
is up to the individual.
   African-American, said John Baugh, a professor of linguistics at
the University of Texas at Austin, ``is a term that will gain broad
acceptance, especially in literate circles, and it will be a term
that conveys respect. But it will not become offensive to call an
African-American black.''
   If African-American is to become the standard term, nearly
everyone agrees the next step must be for it to be accepted in
mainstream culture. That may be starting.
   The Merriam-Webster Co. will consider placing the word in the
next Webster's dictionary, editorial director Frederick Mish said.
New words must be used frequently in different settings over a
period of years before they make it into the dictionary.
   ``It's well on its way to meeting the kinds of tests we require
for new entries,'' Mish said.
   The U.S. Census Bureau is using the terms ``black or Negro'' on
its 1990 census forms. It used ``Negro'' in 1960, ``Negro or
black'' in 1970 and ``black or Negro'' in 1980. Census spokesman
Miguel Rivera said African-American would be used in the 2000
census if there is sufficient demand.
   Most general interest newspapers have rules of style that
require their writers to use black unless they are quoting someone.
That, too, could change.
   At the Los Angeles Times, spokeswoman Laura Morgan said some
black journalists have expressed a preference for African-American,
and the newspaper is considering changing its rules.
   At The Boston Globe, ``the term black is preferable, but there
is no proscription against the use of African-American,'' spokesman
Richard Gulla said.
   The Associated Press Stylebook used by many newspapers calls for
the use of black. ``However, if usage dictates, eventually we'll
change,'' Stylebook Editor Norm Goldstein said.
   Not everyone likes the new term. Some people have suggested that
it doesn't apply to all Americans of color: blacks who came from
the West Indies, for instance, or those black Americans whose
ancestors did not come from Africa _ dark-skinned people from
Australia or Asia, for instance.
   Phillip T. Gay, an associate professor of sociology at San Diego
State University, wrote the Los Angeles Times last April to make
the case for black instead of African-American.
   ``The culturally significant links to Africa were broken during
the years of slavery,'' he wrote. ``A name change might obscure
that fact, but it won't change it.''
   But Ms. Edelin and other proponents of African-American say
their whole point is to reclaim that lost heritage, to ``revive the
best that is in our ancient culture.''

<HEAD>Church-Goers Found Better Workers And Charity Volunteers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans who regularly attend their local church or synagogue
are more productive in the workplace, have a more stable family
life and volunteer more time to charitable causes.
   These are among survey findings compiled in a new report,
``Religion and the Public Interest,'' by a national interfaith
organization that encourages religious participation.
   Religion in American Life (RIAL) issued the report shortly
before the mid-April launching of its annual advertising campaign
to stimulate worship attendance, with this slogan, ``Bring A
Friend.''
   The report, incorporating recent findings of five research
organizations, says that a lot more Americans are regular
worshippers than is the common impression.
   More than l00 million people attend church or synagogue
regularly, but a survey in the nation's four largest cities found
that a majority thinks the number is less than half that.
   ``People simply have no idea about how many go to church each
week,'' said Nicholas B. van Dyck, president of of RIAL, with
headquarters in Princeton, N.J. ``The reality is double what people
think it is.''
   While many worship frequently without making it every week, the
latest Gallup poll finds that in an average week, 43 percent of
Americans _ 107 million of them _ attended church or synagogue.
   The report says 96 percent of the population or 242 million
Americans believe in God, and 69 percent of them or 172 million
claim affiliation with a religious denomination.
   The findings were compiled from studies by the Gallup
Organization, the Lilly Endowment, the Independent Sector, ``Giving
USA'' of the American Association of Fund Raising Counsel and
Proprietary Research.
   Other items cited in the report:
   _ Regular worshippers are 50 percent more likely to reject
illicit drugs than non-worshippers.
   _ Churches and synagogues contribute more to America's social
services and in improving the lot of the needy than any other
non-governmental institution, including corporations.
   _ Beyond their own expenses, religious organizations contribute
$19 billion annually to child and elder care, education, health,
food for the hungry, housing for the homeless and other
non-religious work in the public interest.
   _ The dollar value of volunteer time given by church-goers to
community services that are not church-related amounts to more than
$6 billion annually.
   _ Churches and synaoggues lead the list of the top 24
organizations regarded as improving urban life and are found to be
among the most cost-effective charitable institutions in society.
   _ Church and synagogue members are more likely than
non-worshippers to agree that ``duty comes before pleasure'' and
that ``facing daily tasks is a source of pleasure and
satisfaction.''
   ``People from congregations account for most of the volunteer
hours for health care, education and the arts in this country,''
van Dyck said.
   He added that they also ``demonstrate better-than-average
productivity in the work place'' and ``commitment to family life.''
   About 50 religious bodies _ Protestant, Roman Catholic, Mormon,
Jewish and Eastern Orthodox _ are represented in RIAL, which was
founded in 1949, and has greatly increased in scope since.
   Its annual campaigns, developed by the Advertising Council,
include billboards, posters in public transportation, broadcast
spots and public service ads in magazines and newspapers.
   A preparatory brochure, ``Get Ready, Get Set, Invite a Friend,''
has been distributed to congregations of participating
denominations.
   Ads are to include a toll-free telephone number directing
callers to evangelism departments of the church of their choice.
   Concerning the year's slogan, van Dyck, a Presbyterian, said 86
percent of regular church-goers initially were invited by a friend,
which makes application of the slogan promising for boosting church
rolls still more.

<HEAD>Government Seeks `Believable' Count of Homeless Americans</HEAD>

   For most interest groups pushing their wares
in Washington, certified U.S. government numbers are among the
roots of all influence. They use the statistics as evidence of
strength and of the magnitude of problems they insist should get
federal attention.
   That has made the numbers game an integral part of the process
in which rival blocs lobby for influence and, above all, federal
dollars.
   But activists who claim to represent the interests of the
homeless in America are not playing at numbers now. Some of them
tried to sabotage the government's first attempt to count the
homeless, preferring to stick with old estimates on the theory that
census takers couldn't come close to counting all the people
involved.
   They argue that any census count will be so low that it
shouldn't be compiled at all. ``It's going to be used to try and
drive down appropriations,'' said Mitch Snyder, the Washington
activist for the homeless who has made himself the most visible
figure in the movement.
   He has a vested interest in the current, undocumented estimate
that more than 3 million Americans are homeless, because he was
involved in producing the number.
   But others who work to help the homeless disagree with those who
resist the census, contending that an attempt at a real count will
help dramatize the problem and could promote programs to deal with
it.
   That's the way government counts have worked in other campaigns.
Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty gained impetus when the
government, which he was running at the time, put numbers on the
problem by setting a poverty income line and estimating how many
Americans lived on less money.
   The Census Bureau never has claimed that it could produce an
accurate count of all the homeless people in the country, only that
it would send its people out on March 20 to find as many as
possible, and would report those findings in 1991 as part of the
overall census.
   It won't describe the findings as a count of the homeless but,
rather, as a report on how many people its enumerators found in
shelters, on the streets and in hotel rooms that cost $12 a night
or less.
   Barbara Bryant, director of the census, said that should cover
the vast majority of homeless people. ``There are no believable
numbers of homeless in America,'' she said. ``This is going to get
an order of the magnitude of the problem.''
   While there may not be any believable numbers, there are
estimates of the number of homeless that range from 250,000 to more
than 3 million. The latter number is Snyder's; it first appeared in
a paper published by his Community for Creative Non-Violence in
1982.
   In congressional testimony in 1984, Snyder said the number was
meaningless. ``We have tried to satisfy your gnawing curiosity for
a number because we are Americans with Western little minds that
have to quantify everything in sight whether we can or not,'' he
said.
   At about the same time, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development conducted its own survey and came up with an estimate
of 250,000 to 350,000 homeless.
   In 1988, the Urban Institute issued an estimate of about 600,000.
   Snyder countered that ``just about everybody in America who is
involved thinks the figure is 2 to 3 million.''
   Carl F. Horowitz, a Washington urban planner, recounted the
story of the numbers in an analysis written for the conservative
Heritage Foundation last year.
   He said Mary Ellen Hombs was the principal author of the report
that came up with the 3 million figure. She later became
coordinator of the National Coalition for the Homeless. Horowitz
quoted her as saying that numbers don't make any difference, that
the government should spend its money housing the homeless instead
of trying to count them.
   The count is done now, at a cost estimated at more than $2.7
million. The result will be announced late in 1991. And the
argument will start all over again.

   Broke? Need a rich uncle? When it comes to war
reparations, win or lose you can't beat Uncle Sam for generosity,
even though he's never been in the black since the day he was born.
And, with one ironic exception, that ain't whistling Dixie.

   President Bush has asked Congress for $500 million for aid to
Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua, which reminds us once again
that in war or peace, aggressor or aggressee, Uncle Sam picks up
most of the tab.
   The money now sought is intended to help one country recover
from an American invasion and the other from a war the United
States supported for 10 years. Tiny Granada was broke until Uncle
Sam invaded in 1983 and sent $110 million in appreciation.
   The whole business recalls an old Israeli joke. Prime Minister
Ben Gurion was worried about keeping his new nation solvent. A
colleague playfully suggested Israel go to war against the United
States and, after certain defeat, could expect a flood of dollars
from Washington.
   Ben Gurion thought that over carefully. Then, with Talmudic
caution, he asked, ``But suppose we win?''
   After two of its three biggest wars, the United States supplied
its defeated enemy with billions in aid. The exception and ultimate
in ironies followed Appomattox.
   After World War II, we helped Japan and West Germany rebuild
their economies and they rebuilt so well we are now begging for
mercy. But after our own Civil War, the government in Washington
sent no aid to the Americans who lost. Nothing went south except
the carpetbaggers and other vultures of Reconstruction.
   In this century, Uncle Sam became the biggest giver and lender
in history. Until the early 1950s, he was supplying 90 percent of
all foreign aid from all nations (Library of Congress). It was
still 60 percent in 1965, 25 percent in 1977, less than 15 percent
since.
   A mighty oak from one sickly acorn. The United States began in
1789 in debt _ $55 million borrowed at home and abroad to pay for
the Revolution. It became the richest nation on Earth but never got
into the black. The closest was 1834 when the national debt was
only $38,000. Been up since. There was always something.
   We wanted to buy California and New Mexico but Mexico wasn't
selling. So we provoked a war and took them. We called it
``Manifest Destiny'' and paid Mexico $15 million in conscience
money for the land that stretched to the sea and made us a
continental nation.
   Wars grew bigger. Came the end of World War I, the European
Allies owed Uncle Sam $9.2 billion and Germany owed the Allies $33
billion in reparations. There then occurred a wondrous sequence in
which Europe borrowed from Sam to pay Sam.
   Germany borrowed $2.5 billion from American investors, paid the
Allies $4.5 billion in reparations, the Allies paid the U.S. $2.6
billion and then everything else was defaulted by the Depression.
   In World War II, we didn't call it debts; we called it
lend-lease. Under that name, we sent more than $52 billion worth of
military and civilian supplies to Great Britain, the Soviet Union
and 38 other countries.
   In theory the recipients were to return what usable equipment
they had left after the war! In theory, they also were to supply
the United States with reciprocal goods and services as best they
could after the war! Never was theory more sorely tried. Lend-lease
turned out to be almost entirely gift.
   Since World War II, and largely for reasons of the Cold War, the
United States has supplied more than 100 countries with $372
billion worth of economic and military aid.
   Thousands of foreign military officers were brought here for
special training at American expense. Abroad, the United States
maintained a network of bases around the world for which it paid
handsome rent.
   Fair-minded readers will want to remember that in the War of
1812 the British charged us nothing for burning Washington.

<HEAD>Soviet Jewish Autonomous Region is Anything But</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4th graf `Kaufman, a' to INSERT dropped word `ago'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BIROBIDZHAN, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A log cabin is the only place of
Jewish worship in this frozen region once called a promised land
for Soviet Jews. The makeshift rabbi, Boris Kaufman, conducts some
services with the New Testament.
   He says he believes in Jesus Christ. That makes Kaufman a
Christian, not a Jew, but few would notice in the Jewish Autonomous
Region of the Soviet Union.
   Little is Jewish but the name in this remote corner of the
Soviet Far East set aside in 1934.
   Kaufman, a 40-year-old preacher with a red beard who settled on
Judaism after trying the Baptist and Pentecostal faiths, said he
got his job by default after the region's only rabbi died a few
years ago at age 86.
   ``Everything fell apart'' after the rabbi's death, Kaufman
recalled. He acknowledged having little knowledge of Hebrew, the
language of the Old Testament, and said he interprets Jewish
religious doctrine loosely.
   During Hanukkah, the Feast of Lights, when Jews around the world
lit ceremonial candles and recited holiday prayers, there were no
candles in the Jewish Autonomous Region and no worshipers in the
cabin. Snow-covered street banners bore only secular greetings, for
the New Year.
   The region has no real rabbi or other Jewish clergy, no
religious education or kosher food. No one can remember the last
true Jewish wedding or bar mitzvah, the ritual that marks a boy's
13th birthday.
   As a Western writer put it, decades-old hopes for the Jewish
Autonomous Region were ``blown away by the cold Siberian wind.''
   After the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, the new leaders broke with
the czarist policy of confining Jews to a section of the southern
and southwestern Russian Empire known as the Pale.
   They gave Jews their own territory, a sparsely populated tract
between the Bira and Bidzhan rivers, a region the size of Belgium
rich in forests, tin deposits and such wildlife as the Siberian
Ussuri tiger and wild boar.
   Most of the Jewish Autononomous Region is farmland. Wooden huts
dot the landscape outside the regional capital, Birobidzhan, a town
of old brick apartment buildings and newer pre-fabricated concrete
dwellings.
   It was an artificial entity prompted by the new government's
nationalities policy and by military strategy. It forms a buffer on
the border with Manchuria.
   Creating the region also served to counter Zionism, the movement
advocating Jewish settlement in Palestine.
   The government hoped large numbers of Jewish farmers and
tradesmen would make the 5,000-mile trek from Moscow and other
Russian cities. In 1935, President Mikhail Kalinin boldly
predicted: ``In 10 years' time, Birobidzhan will become the most
important guardian of the Jewish national culture.''
   Kalinin's hopes were not realized.
   Comparatively few Jews made the trip, and of those who did come
to escape persecution and famine, many soon left. The climate was
harsh _ temperatures reached -13 Fahrenheit this winter _ the land
was undeveloped and the nation's Jewish centers were a world away.
   Bolshevik leader Leon Trotsky, a Jew who was born Lev Bronstein,
eventually described the experiment as ``a bureaucratic farce.''
The late Soviet leader Nikita S. Khrushchev declared it a failure.
   Jews never became more than a small minority in the region,
despite Lenin's stipulation of uniform nationality in such areas.
The Jewish Autonomous Region has 8,887 Jews, 4 percent of the
region's population and fewer than one-half percent of the Soviet
Union's 1.4 million Jews.
   Official propaganda still portrays the region almost as a Jewish
paradise, a showplace of assimilation and a refutation of claims
that Soviet Jews are persecuted.
   In a dispatch in October 1988 about the Russian-born Jewish
writer Sholon Aleichem, the official news agency Tass said
``Birobidzhan's example clearly shows that the writer's dream of
seeing his people free and happy has come true.''
   Most Jews in the region appear to have assimilated, and to have
succumbed to official atheism.
   Some did not survive Josef Stalin's purge of 1937 and his
campaign against ``Jewish cosmopolitanism'' in 1948. Exhibits in a
section of the Birobidzhan museum say many Jews, including
Americans who came to help work the land, were killed or sent to
labor camps.
   Yiddish schools, a publishing house and a theater were closed.
   Birobidzhan has some appearance of Jewish life, along with
factories that make combines, shoes and electrical transformers.
   Signs on stores and public buildings are in Yiddish as well as
Russian. The main street is not named after Lenin, as in most
Soviet cities, but for Sholom Aleichem.
   In keeping with government policy of treating Jews as a
nationality, not a religious group, there are some signs of Jewish
culture _ a theater, radio programs in Yiddish, a cultural club and
schools where Yiddish is taught after a 42-year ban. A hotel
restaurant serves pseudo-Jewish cuisine.
   There is virtually nothing religious, although President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev has proclaimed official tolerance of religion and
permitted a revival of religious life nationwide.
   Kaufman said few young people are interested in the religion and
he has difficulty assembling the required 10-man quorum for
services.
   He would like to see a religious revival, he said, and hopes a
young man studying in Moscow will become the rabbi in Birobidzhan.
The student has been offered the job, but some Jews in Birobidzhan
said he wasn't interested.
   Local officials, many of them Jews, seem uninterested in
improving religious life.
   Mayor Mark Kaufman, no relation to Boris, acknowledged the
log-cabin synagogue was in bad shape and pledged to improve
conditions for worship. He also called the synagogue a ``part of
Jewish history'' and suggested converting it to a cultural center.
   Arkady Kuperman, ``religion'' correspondent of the
Yiddish-language newspaper, Birobidzhaner Stern, said he saw
nothing wrong with the lack of interest in religion.
   ``We are atheists,'' he said. ``We spent our whole lives without
God, and this doesn't bother me.''
   At Birobidzhan's teacher-training college, opened in October as
part of Gorbachev's liberalization program, there is a Jewish
language and literature department with classes in Yiddish. Hebrew
classes are planned, but not religious instruction.
   ``There are no real believers among us, except for old people,''
said Larisa Tsilman, one of the institute's two young Yiddish
teachers.
   Officials see the region as an alternative destination for
Soviet Jews considering emigration. A few families have applied to
move here because of what they consider an increase of
anti-Semitism elsewhere in the Soviet Union.
   Most Soviet Jews wanting to leave, however, continue to choose
Israel or the United States.
   Talk of emigration also increases among Jewish residents of
Birobidzhan.
   Four families went to live abroad last year. Vladimir Okun, 66,
who runs the Birobidzhan chess club and keeps up with the gossip,
predicts all the Jews in the Jewish Autonomous Region will be gone
in five years.

   Sheriff Bob Braudis, his star on the wall
behind his desk and his skis in the corner, admits to living a
childhood dream as a ``marshal in the Wild West.''
   But the former New York City business analyst, like others who
chased dreams to Aspen in the 1960s and 1970s, now sees the town's
``wild'' side being squeezed out.
   Aspen's population is changing, and its long struggle to figure
out just how much growth it can handle is intensifying.
   ``Back then, coming to Aspen was analagous to dropping out,''
says Braudis. ``I came to Aspen to get away from traffic jams,
negative newspapers, crowding, pollution _ and all those things
have caught up with me.''
   Braudis doesn't get many calls to round up horse thieves or
even, as a sheriff here might have a decade ago, drug dealers. Now,
he's asked if his deputies can provide security at fancy parties.
   ``The core of Aspen has become really manicured and buffed. Old
Victorian buildings have been torn down and rehabbed,'' says the
sheriff and former ski bum.
   ``Ski bums can't afford to live here anymore. The death of the
ski bum is somewhat symbolic of what's happened to Aspen.''
   Discussing what's happened to Aspen has become something of an
obsession here following back-to-back elections.
   On Feb. 13, voters rejected a proposed ban on fur sales and
approved the building of a large hotel downtown, the widening and
straightening of overburdened Highway 82, and measures aimed at
creating affordable housing. The Ritz-Carlton Hotel vote was
particularly divisive, many residents say, and reflected a new,
more welcoming attitude toward growth.
   On March 13, voters recalled anti-growth city councilman Steve
Crockett, who was accused of being rude to constituents, but kept
in office Mayor Bill Stirling, who led the anti-fur campaign, and
two other targeted councilmen. The recall movement began in
response to their reluctance to approve the large-scale hotel.
   The transformation from funky, rustic retreat to glitzy resort
isn't unique to Aspen; it's happened in other upscale tourist
towns. But few places have responded with as much acrimony,
hand-wringing and national attention.
   This was, after all, one of the first communities in the nation
to embrace daylight-savings time, nuclear-free zones and
public-smoking bans, and to close its doors to neon, billboards and
fast-food restaurants.
   Unlike its development-hungry neighbors on Colorado's Western
Slope, Aspen's problem is how to work with the developers knocking
at the door and still keep the qualities that attracted dreamers in
the first place: a clean environment, a social conscience, a sense
of community.
   Aspen's population, estimated at about 5,000 during the summer
and four times that in the winter, is one of the most educated per
capita in the nation. The town has attracted a variety of arts
groups, think tanks and environmental research institutes.
   One local newspaper refers to the area outside the Roaring Fork
Valley as ``The Real World.''
   But Aspen is less and less of an escape for anybody but the
ultra-rich.
   Hemmed in by mountains, it has limited building space. In the
late 1970s, the Pitkin County commissioners set an annual limit on
infrastructure growth of 3.5 percent to control mushrooming
subdivisions.
   Some say those limits only drove up the price of existing
properties, particularly in the late 1980s when the Aspen Skiing
Co. began a marketing push following a mini-recession early in the
decade. By 1989, the average price of an Aspen home reached $1
million.
   Michael Kinsley, a county commissioner from 1975 to 1985 and now
an economic-development expert for the Rocky Mountain Institute,
says real estate prices would have risen without growth
restrictions.
   ``Supply and demand doesn't (explain) circumstances here,'' he
says. ``What it ignores is the nature of the demand. People want
million-dollar houses.''
   Many locals have been pushed out of rental units or sold their
properties for a fortune and moved ``down valley'' to towns like
Basalt, Carbondale and Glenwood Springs.
   Many who remain, from doctors to dishwashers, live in employee
housing or pay rent kept artificially low by city mandate. They
often leave town to go shopping, getting groceries in Glenwood
Springs and clothes as far away as Denver, about 200 miles away.
   Now, an estimated 20,000 cars a day travel Highway 82, nearly
three times the traffic it was made for, says Braudis. It's
estimated half Aspen's workers live down valley and commute.
   That emigration leaves a disquieting feeling among those
remaining that their community may be unraveling.
   Braudis predicts that within a year or two, Pitkin County will
be forced to form a paid or partially paid fire department because
Aspen is losing the people who volunteered for year-round services
like the fire department and the mountain rescue team.
   ``Walking to work sometimes it's kind of like a movie set,''
says Steve Wicks, 36, who moved to Aspen when he was 15 and now
owns Aspen Drug. ``Everything's maintained, but nobody's home.
There's nobody out washing the car or riding their bike.''
   All but one of his 15 employees lives down valley, Wicks says.
   Cliff Camron, manager of the Aspen Athletic Club, has the same
problem.
   ``This was our most difficult year to find staff because of the
difficulty of finding housing,'' says Camron, who lives in
price-controlled housing, paying $750 for a one-bedroom apartment.
   Offsetting the migration down valley is an influx of the
super-wealthy, who often live in Aspen only part of the year, and
the poor, mostly Hispanics who take the service jobs ski bums used
to hold, says Braudis.
   Aspen still has its resident stars from earlier, more off-beat
times, like singer John Denver and writer Hunter S. Thompson, but
they are eclipsed during the resort's busiest weeks by a galaxy of
glamorous part-time residents, from Don Johnson to Donald Trump.
   Despite the recent anti-fur campaign, fur coats are nearly as
numerous as parkas on the downtown mall and in restaurants.
   ``The newer immigrants have distinguished themselves in several
areas with an elitist and socially stratified attitude,'' Braudis
says.
   ``In the old days, the millionaire got off the plane and went to
his home and changed into jeans and a turtleneck. He emulated the
ski bums, and invited them to parties. Now, there's a little Berlin
wall between them and the locals. That's probably typical of most
high-dollar resorts, but it's never been true of Aspen.''
   The newer residents and tourists ``have expectations of a much
higher level of service than a rural Colorado government can
afford,'' which is taxing his department, Braudis says.
   Calls to the sheriff's office have increased 56 percent in the
last three years ``without a commensurate increase in the
population,'' he says.
   ``People are asking government to intervene inappropriately. I
have to contrast that with the rugged individualism of the '60s and
'70s,'' he says.

   Plywood suggestion boxes collecting dust in
the corners of workshops are history.
   Employers want to hear the ideas more than ever before, but
today those boxes are replaced with computer-punched applications.
Worker-involvement programs use surveys, interviews and even health
plans to cut costs and increase production.
   ``Suggestion systems pick the brain of the employee,'' said Jim
Canada, president of the National Association of Suggestion
Systems. ``The culture of today is that managers must realize their
employees have excellent ideas and solutions, and they must look at
these ideas openly.''
   NASS, a Chicago-based group, represents 1,200 of the world's
largest companies. It tracks the successes and failures of
suggestion programs and helps members forge their own plans.
   The results are suggestive.
   American Airlines saved $40.7 million in 1989 by adopting
workers' ideas, said Canada, who manages the carrier's IdeAAs in
Action program in Tulsa. In 1988, NASS member organizations saved
$2.25 billion in labor and material costs.
   The idea is that workers know their jobs better than anyone and
know how to streamline them. Worker incentives to make suggestions
range from cash to merchandise to letters of recommendation.
   At American's maintenance and engineering facility in Tulsa,
employee Carol Hamer suggested using an adhesive rather than hot
glue to assemble airline seats. The change saves time and cut costs
by nearly $230,000. Ms. Hamer was given $36,000 for the idea.
   ``These people are living and breathing their jobs eight hours a
day,'' Canada said. ``They're going to know far more about a
function than management.''
   The NASS program covers more than soliciting ideas for
improvement, Canada said. Teams interview employees about their
positions and hand out surveys. Under a ``Wellness Program,''
companies encourage employees to stay healthy.
   ``You work to improve the health of the worker,'' he said.
``It's my belief that employee will be more productive.''
   The first corporate suggestion program started at Eastman Kodak
Co. in 1898. William M. Connor told his bosses in Rochester, N.Y.,
the windows should be washed regularly in the black-paper slitting
room.
   Decades later, prior to World War II, the programs grew
dramatically. The government asked companies providing war
materials to cut costs, and NASS was formed in 1942.
   About the same time, corporate America was undergoing massive
changes. Fewer executives climbed the ladder to their postings and
lateral career moves were status quo.
   ``The old style of workers moving up the ladder after they've
been machinists would be one where they retain some of the insights
of the work situation,'' said Kenneth Benson, a nationally
recognized industrial sociologist at the University of Missouri.
   ``The problem even with that is that technology changes pretty
rapidly. One's direct knowledge of the work situation may be pretty
quickly outdated.''
   So, turn to the line worker.
   Benson said suggestion programs are vital to overcome resentment
some workers feel toward employers. They become involved in the
company's decisions by sharing their ideas and common ground is
struck.
   ``There is a fundamental conflict of interest between workers
and managers that centers around the struggle over wages and
profits,'' Benson said. ``It's a structural problem.
   ``Once managers enter into managerial positions, they're
structurally removed from workers. They're in different worlds.
They have different goals. Workers very quickly begin to distrust
them and see them as representatives of the other side.''
   Canada said the NASS programs will become vital as competition
increases among companies and employers discover a neglected
resource.
   ``In the '90s, companies will be forced to become more
competitive,'' Canada said. ``Their greatest resources will be
their employees. They'll be seen less for their physical stature
and more for their minds and creativity.
   ``It's extremely important to involve the employees.''

<HEAD>Airline's Emergence From Bankruptcy Now Expected Later</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines says difficulties in rebuilding
its strike-battered business are causing it to lose much more money
than expected and will delay its emergence from bankruptcy
reorganization.
   The beleagured carrier also said Tuesday that its dampened
business prospects have left it unable to pay unsecured creditors
50 cents on the dollar, as it had tentatively agreed to do.
   The airline, which has been trying to reorganize under federal
bankruptcy court supervision, said it now expects to lose $330
million this year, or $185 million more than it estimated in
January.
   Eastern also said it no longer projects a profit for next year
because restoring its revenue structure, battered by a strike by
its machinists, flight attendants and pilots unions, has taken
longer than anticipated.
   The gloomier outlook means the carrier will not emerge from
bankrupcty court proceedings early this summer, as it had hoped.
   Phil Bakes, president and chief executive of the Miami-based
carrier, presented the revised business plan to the creditors group
meeting in New York.
   In an interview after the meeting, Bakes expressed
disappointment about having to revise the projections but he said:
``We have no reason to believe Eastern will not emerge successfully
from Chapter 11.''
   The delay will probably last for 30 to 60 days beyond the
previous goal of late June or by July 1, he said.
   A spokesman for the Machinists' union, Charles Bryan, reacted
bitterly to Eastern's announcements.
   ``They never produce what they say they're going to produce.
We've known for many years from doing business with these people _
everything they do is so elusive, it's like trying to take hold of
smoke,'' Bryan said.
   Calls to some of the unsecured creditors, largely equipment
supplies such as aircraft and engine makers, weren't returned.
   The creditors are owed $980 million by Eastern. They stood to
receive about $490 million in cash and notes from Eastern and
sister carrier Continental Airlines under a tentative agreement
announced in late February.
   But Bakes said the airline has had trouble generating increased
revenue from business travelers. He blamed ``the negative and
disruptive public perception surrounding Eastern's reorganization
process.''
   Bakes estimated that Eastern lost two to three business
passengers per flight in January and February, which would amount
to more than $100 million in lost revenue over a fully year.
   The carrier's results during the first two months of the year
also suffered from high fuel prices and the lack of cost-saving
agreements with its pilots and flight attendants, he said.
   He said the carrier's flight activity as of July 1 will be 12
percent less than estimated in January and Eastern will cut its
fleet to 148 from 160 by selling aircraft.
   Eastern also plans to seek annual savings of $33 million by
cutting the cost of health benefits to early retirees and those
under age 65. The bankruptcy court must approve the move.
   The carrier also may try to save $80 million in annual labor
costs by seeking a bankruptcy court-supervised resolution of its
long-running contract dispute with the Air Line Pilots Association
and Transport Workers Union.
   Eastern and the union have tentatively agreed to an interim
contract that includes a 25 percent wage cut for pilots still being
paid at pre-strike wage rates, but that would expire July 1.
   Eastern said it will file for the resolution this week unless
the National Mediation Board succeeds or appears likely to succeed
in reaching a resolution in contract negotiations. Under section
1113 of the bankruptcy code, Eastern could obtain a contract
resolution within 52 days.
   Eastern, a division of Houston-based Texas Air Corp., began
operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from its
creditors on March 9, 1989, five days after three unions struck the
carrier. Since that time, the pilots and flight attendants unions
have withdrawn from the strike.
   Bakes told the committee that Eastern will boost its marketing
effort, including a substantial expansion in advertising and
promotional spending on its business flyer program, to counter
negative accounts of Eastern's situation.
   Bakes also said Eastern and Texas Air plan to continue to move
ahead on an agreement with court-appointed bankruptcy examiner
David Shapiro under which Texas Air and its Continental Airlines
subsidiary would assist Eastern in completing its reorganization.

<HEAD>American Express Sweetens Stock Buyback; $700 Million Charge
Predicted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. will charge a record
$700 million against quarterly earnings to pay for layoffs, office
closings and reserves against bad real estate loans, according to a
top credit rating agency.
   The pretax charge estimated by Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. would be
the largest in securities industry history, exceeding a $470
million charge by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in the 1989 fourth quarter.
   Meanwhile Tuesday, Shearson parent American Express Co.
sweetened its buyout of all publicly held shares of Shearson it
doesn't already own. In response, attorneys agreed to drop about 20
class-action lawsuits filed by shareholders challenging the merger.
   American Express also said a previously announced $750 million
capital infusion had been made available to Shearson. American
Express will have pumped about $1.35 billion into Shearson in
recent months once the recapitalization plan is completed.
   Detailing the charge, S&amp;P said Shearson will need up to $300
million to cover potential losses from its Balcor Co. real estate
subsidiary, up to $100 million for severance payments to 2,000
employees laid off this month and up to $100 million to pull back
from certain business lines.
   But ``if March performance is awful then all bets are off and
conceivably the number could be higher,'' S&amp;P vice president
Jeffrey Bowman said.
   Shearson has said it expects a ``significant'' first-quarter
charge. A Shearson spokesman declined further comment on the
charge, which Wall Street analysts had estimated at as much as $500
million.
   Separately, The New York Times reported in Wednesday's editions
that Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. was planning to dismiss 300
to 500 employees as part of a reorganization.
   ``We are engaged in the process of shrinking certain businesses
while expanding in others,'' a spokesman for the securities firm
told the newspaper.
   Under the stock buyback, American Express will exchange about
13.4 million shares of its common stock for the 28 million
remaining publicly held Shearson shares.
   The Shearson stock would be converted into 0.48 of a share of
American Express stock. That would be a 12.7 percent increase from
the 0.426 a share announced March 4.
   Based on Tuesday's closing price of $25.62{ a share for American
Express and $12.50 for Shearson, the deal values the minority stake
at about $343 million.
   The deal marks a reversal for American Express, which had
intended to reduce its majority stake in the Wall Street firm that
has been strained by overexpansion in the 1980s and a recession in
the securities industry.
   If completed, American Express would own about 92 percent of
Shearson, with the rest held by Nippon Life Insurance Co. of Japan.
   Bowman said that while the recapitalization is positive for
Shearson, American Express' credit rating could come under pressure
if it is forced to continue injecting large amounts of capital into
the brokerage.
   After an initial recapitalization plan to breathe life into
Shearson fell through early this year, American Express decided to
take control of its securities unit in an attempt to avoid a credit
rating reduction.
   The big credit card and financial services firm installed one of
its executives to run Shearson and announced a major cost-cutting
that included the layoffs and 50 branch office closings. Shearson
hopes the moves will save $400 million a year.
   Shearson, with about 33,500 employees, is the second largest
Wall Street firm behind Merrill Lynch.
   Shearson is hampered by overcapacity from its 1988 acquisition
of E.F. Hutton &amp; Co., diminished stock trading business since the
1987 market crash and problems with its $1.1 billion real estate
loan portfolio.
   The revised stock purchase by American Express was approved late
Monday by Shearson's board following the recommendation of a
special committee of three outside Shearson directors and the
American Express board.
   Shearson and American Express also said shareholders had agreed
to drop class-action lawsuits challenging the merger, pending court
approval.
   The lawsuits claimed American Express was offering too little
for the Shearson stock, which it had sold at $34 a share in an
initial public offering in 1987.
   Spokesmen for Shearson and American Express declined to comment
on whether the buyback was sweetened to resolve the litigation. But
shareholder attorneys said the price was raised in response.
   ``I don't think there's any question that the litigation was a
factor in the increased price,'' said R. Bruce McNew, an attorney
with the Philadelphia law firm of Greenfield &amp; Chimicles, which
filed a class-action lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   The family-owned California company that
publishes Sunset magazine and Sunset Books has agreed to be
acquired for $225 million in cash and stock by Time Warner Inc.
   The deal, which is expected to be completed within a month or
so, would be the first sizeable acquisition for Time Warner since
Time Inc. completed its $14 billion acquisition of Warner
Communications Inc. in January.
   Time Warner executives said the purchase would not add to the
company's $10.7 billion debt. Nearly two-thirds of the price is in
preferred stock and the cash portion will come the company's cash
flow, they said.
   Time Warner said Tuesday it had agreed in principle to pay $80
million in cash and $145 million in preferred stock for Lane
Publishing Co., based in Menlo Park, Calif.
   Lane had revenue of nearly $100 million last year, according to
an executive familiar with the deal who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   ``This transaction underscores our optimism about the prospects
for the magazine and book businesses,'' Time Warner's co-chairman
and co-chief executives, Steven J. Ross and J. Richard Munro, said
in a statement.
   It also gives Time Warner a second regional publishing
operation. The company has owned Southern Progress Corp., which
publishes Southern Living, Cooking Light and other magazines from
Birmingham, Ala., for five years.
   Sunset, The Magazine of Western Living, is a general interest
magazine with a monthly circulation of 1.3 million and readership
of nearly 5 million. It publishes four zone editions each month in
13 Western states.
   The magazine, founded in 1898 by the Southern Pacific Railroad
Co., initially was intended to influence travel to the West.
   But it now focuses on five major editorial areas _ travel and
recreation, home design and use, food and entertaining, gardening
and landscaping, and the environment.
   The magazine was sold to its employees in 1914, and L.W. Lane
bought it and founded Lane Publishing in 1928.
   Lane formed a personal friendship with Time founder Henry Luce
in the 1930s, and their companies established several business
relationships. Sunset and the West Coast edition of Time, for
instance, have shared printing presses since 1944.
   Lane's sons, L.W. ``Bill'' Lane Jr., 70, and Melvin B. Lane, 67,
are the co-chairmen of Lane Publishing.
   They and their families decided late last fall to put the
company up for sale and had discussions with several well-known
national publishers before selecting Time Warner, according to Lane
spokesman Gene Elsbree.
   ``Our highest priorities have always been to maintain Sunset's
editorial excellence, to continue its growth and to ensure that the
future of Sunset is in the right hands,'' the Lane brothers said in
a statement. ``We're confident that these will now be achieved.''
   Sunset Books publishes contemporary lifestyle books on topics
such as gardening, landscaping and entertainment. The books are
distributed through nurseries, home improvement, hardware, building
supplies and stationery stores as well as through book and
department stores worldwide.
   Lane also owns Sunset Films, based in San Francisco. It makes
mainly industrial films and handles the audio-visual presentations
that Sunset magazine uses for its sales presentations.
   The deal also includes the company's headquarters located near
the Stanford University campus about 30 miles south of San
Francisco.

<TEXT>
   No matter how his proxy battle to unseat
Lockheed Corp.'s board turns out, Texas billionaire Harold Simmons
can brag he forced the aerospace company's management to pay more
attention to shareholders.
   Simmons got a boost Tuesday from California's $5.6 billion
Public Employees' Retirement System. Calpers, the nation's largest
private pension fund which owns 500,000 Lockheed shares or less
than 1 percent, said it would vote for Simmon's slate of directors
at Lockheed's annual meeting Thursday.
   The chief reason was Simmons' support for a shareholders'
committee to advise Lockheed management, said Calpers assistant
general counsel Kayla Gillan. Calpers advocates such panels as a
way institutional investors can influence companies.
   Ms. Gillan said other big institutional shareholders share
Calpers' concerns _ good news for Simmons and his chief lieutenant,
J. Landis Martin.
   ``We're feeling very good about our position,'' Martin said.
   Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep quickly responded by promising
institutional shareholders a seat on the board after the annual
meeting. It was an attempt to woo the big institutions who own 60
percent of Lockheed's stock. ``We will work with our institutional
shareholders to develop a list of potential directors from within
or outside their ranks who could provide additional perspective to
our directors,'' Tellep said in a statement.
   ``We believe that selection of at least one director from that
list could provide important input to the future of the company.''
   Simmons so far shows a paper loss of about $100 million on his
$530 million investment in Lockheed.
   In waging his proxy battle, he has said that if he gets control,
he will refocus Lockheed on profits rather than sales. He claims
that will increase the price of Lockheed's stock, which has plunged
nearly $20 in recent months.
   Lockheed closed $1.12{ higher at $37 a share Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Tellep acknowledged the company had concentrated on growth in
new areas but said it already has refocused toward profits under a
restructuring announced last year.
   He said that after a decision to take nearly $500 million in
writeoffs last year, sending profits tumbling to $2 million from
$624 million in 1988, Lockheed is now ready for a big turnaround.
   ``The fact of the matter is that I've been stressing improved
profits and return on assets, and our five-year forecast reflects
that,'' Tellep said in an interview this week. ``It's incorrect to
say that we're more interested in sales.''
   Simmons controls about 19 percent of Lockheed's stock and can
acquire no more than 20 percent before Lockheed's anti-takeover
provisions kick in, making further stock purchases prohibitively
expensive.
   He has indicated he is likely to sell big chunks of Lockheed's
operations outside of its space, missiles and aeronautics divisions.
   But Tellep said such a divestment program is already underway.
Beginning in 1989, Lockheed began selling off seven units with
combined sales of $200 million, he said.
   He also attacked Simmons' claim that companies purchased by
Simmons have shown a consistent pattern of improved earnings and
share values.
   ``Our share price decline is exactly within the pattern of the
whole defense industry,'' Tellep said. ``Simmon's NL Industries'
stock declined 34 percent in the last six months, so he's not
exactly perfect.''
   He reiterated his contention that Simmons knows nothing about
running a defense contractor the size and complexity of Lockheed,
which had revenues of $9.9 billion last year.
   ``He says a lot of things, but the question is, what is his
plan,'' Tellep said. ``His fundamental problem is a lack of
understanding of our basic business makeup.''
   He said he intended to meet with Simmons after the shareholders'
meeting Thursday to give him more insight into the company. And in
a video prepared for Lockheed workers, who also own about 19
percent of the company through an employee stock ownership plan,
Tellep promised better communication with them.
   Tellep also told Calpers that after talking to shareholders
around the country, he realized he should support confidential
voting, Ms. Gillan said.
   That is one of several proposals advocated by Simmons and
Calpers, along with dropping the company's tough anti-takeover
provisions.
   Simmons' promises are wider-ranging than Lockheed's and he
signed his, Ms. Gillan said, explaining the fund's decision to back
Simmons.
   ``We haven't seen anything in writing from Mr. Tellep,'' she
said.

<TEXT>
   The extended warranties and loss-protection
now provided by many credit cards may soon be available for goods
bought with checks issued by many banks.
   Bank of America said Tuesday almost any purchase made by its
customers using a personal check will be protected for free against
loss, theft, damage or fire for 90 days after purchase.
   The protection also automatically doubles the manufacturer's
U.S. warranty, up to one additional year on items such as home
appliances, video equipment, computers, toys and sports equipment.
The coverage will be effective almost immediately for the bank's
more than 3 million checking customers.
   The move is part of a budding trend by banks to woo depositors
by offering the added services on checking accounts.
   Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank in New York plan to start
similar programs next week, following the lead of First Chicago
last week and several smaller banks, Valley National Bank in
Phoenix, Ariz., Napa Valley Bank in California and CrossLand
Savings Bank in New York.
   ``I think as time goes by, more and more banks will offer this
protection to their checking customers to remain competitive,''
said Chase's marketing vice president, Chester Myszkowski.
   Banks aren't the only ones providing this new service. Coast
Savings, a California thrift, last week announced a similar plan.
   American Express Co. and many bank card companies have been
offering purchase insurance to premium card holders for more than
two years.
   In addition to providing the protection for check users, Bank of
America also will extend coverage as of April 1 to purchasers using
its regular credit cards. The bank has been offering the service to
its premium card holders for 2{ years. Bank of America has 5{
million credit card customers.
   ``With this service, our customers can save hundreds of dollars
in costly repair or replacement bills,'' said Thomas E. Peterson,
vice chairman.
   The coverage is being underwritten by National Union Fire
Insurance Co. of Pittsburgh, and Bank of America has no liabilities
for losses, said bank spokeswoman Shirley Rigby Norton.
   She declined to disclose the cost of the insurance to the bank,
citing proprietary reasons, but said it would not have a
significant impact on the bank's expenses.
   ``It's not expensive in what it costs the banks per account,
probably less than $1 a year,'' said Robert V. Conte, a broker with
CBSI, an insurance marketing company in Harrison, N.Y., that set up
the Chase and First Chicago plans. The underwriter for those plans
also is National Union Fire Insurance Co.
   ``There's no comparable policy that consumers can buy
individually,'' he said. ``The extended warranties offered by
dealers on things like stereos are expensive and have huge profit
margins built in. Adding it to checking accounts is all the rage
all of a sudden.''
   The banks' extended warranties may cut into the profits of
retailers who offer their own extended warranties.
   But a spokesman for Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., which
offers a variety of ``maintenance agreements,'' said he ``would not
anticipate'' that the bank programs will affect sales of Sears'
product coverage.
   ``Our coverage does more than extend the manufacturers'
warranties, and it can last up to 10 years,'' said Sears spokesman
Gordon Jones.
   As of April 2, Citibank, a unit of Citicorp, will expand its
purchase protection service now offered only to credit card
customers to the bank's 1 million customers who have a combined
checking and savings account known as Citi-One.
   Chase customers with similar ``Better Banking'' accounts will
get the coverage as of April 1. The Chase Manhattan Corp. unit has
been offering the coverage only to customers using unsecured credit
lines and credit cards.
   The loss protection plan for all the major banks gives buyers as
much as $50,000 coverage, limited to the amount of the purchase
paid by check or credit card. The plans have a $2,500 limit for
claims involving jewelry, watches, furs and fine art.
   Customers do not have to register to join the programs or
register their purchses. Eligible purchases will be covered only in
excess of other collectible insurance, such as homeowner's or
tenant's insurance, and can pick up the deductible from the
customer's other insurance.
   Customers must provide a sales receipt, a copy of their canceled
check or charge card slip, and damaged merchandise as proof of
purchase.

   The Bush administration is counting on its
proposed Family Savings Plan to generate more revenue than it would
cost, but the Senate's chief tax-writer is skeptical.
   ``That carries me back to 1981'' when the Reagan administration
predicted that huge tax cuts would pay for themselves, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said
Tuesday. ``Now we have these enormous deficits that in part were
brought about by that `magic.'''
   The Family Savings Plan is part of a package proposed by
President Bush as incentives to increased saving and investment.
Under the plan, a person with income under $60,000 or a couple
earning less than $120,000 could annually deposit up to $2,500 and
$5,000, respectively, and pay no tax on the interest if the account
was maintained for at least seven years.
   Sidney L. Jones, assistant secretary of the treasury for
economic policy, told the Finance Committee that the proposal would
generate $40 billion in new individual savings over the next five
years.
   He said the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates
that the plan would so boost saving and economic growth that it
would lead ``to an increase in government revenues as well as
personal saving in the longer run.''
   The administration makes the same argument on behalf of the
biggest part of the president's savings and investment package: a
proposal to cut the tax on capital gains, the profits from sales of
investments.
   Some economists quarrel with the administration's basic argument
that a tax incentive will increase savings. They cite Individual
Retirement Accounts as an example, saying that most of the money
going into IRAs is simply a transfer from taxable savings accounts.
   The Finance Committee received conflicting advice on that point
from two analysts associated with the private National Bureau of
Economic Research:
   _Jonathan Skinner of the University of Virginia said an IRA _
which provides a tax incentive at the time a deposit is made _ can
boost savings by locking up an account until retirement. He
predicted that Bush's plan, which could be cashed in after seven
years, would lead to shuffling money from taxable to non-taxable
accounts.
   _Lawrence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University said ``it is clear
that saving policies of the last decade, such as expansion of IRAs,
failed to promote national saving.'' He suggested taxing
consumption _ such as with a national sales tax _ to encourage
saving.
   The one point on which the economists, administration witnesses
and committee members agreed is that Americans save too little of
their income, far less than Japanese and West Germans. The U.S.
saving rate last year was 3.6 percent of net national income,
compared with an average of 8.9 percent during the 1950s, 1960s and
1970s.
   ``Increased savings would lower the cost of capital for our
nation's business, enhance the ability of American companies to
compete in a global market and lower the cost of most goods and
services we consume,'' said Kenneth W. Gideon, assistant secretary
of the treasury for tax policy.
   The National Association of Counties complained that the savings
plan would force up the cost of borrowing for highways, schools and
other state and local building projects. Mary O. Boyle, a Cuyahoga
County, Ohio, commissioner speaking for the association, said the
accounts would compete for the same savings dollars as the
tax-exempt bonds on which states, cities and counties rely.
   ``Local governments would be forced to pay higher borrowing
costs just to compete _ an ultimate cost shift to all taxpayers,''
Ms. Boyle said. That would endanger the nation's system of
highways, bridges and sewers, she said.
   But Gideon said the new accounts ``will have at most a small
impact on the tax-exempt bond market.''

   Federal aviation authorities will no longer
fine airlines for safety violations if the carriers find the
problem themselves, quickly correct it and report it to the
government.
   Federal Aviation Administration chief James B. Busey announced
the new policy Tuesday at a luncheon with airline officials. An
industry spokesman applauded the policy change, but a pilots' group
cautioned against a falldown in FAA enforcement.
   Busey acknowledged that his agency, which monitors safety at
airports used by U.S. carriers throughout the world, doesn't have
enough manpower to catch every violation. He said airlines have the
responsibility to audit their own safety.
   ``We cannot police every aspect of the industry, cannot crawl
through the belly of every aircraft, look over the shoulder of
every pilot, or personally screen every passenger and every piece
of luggage that flies in the system,'' the FAA administrator said.
   The program could require airlines to designate safety auditors
or set up separate safety departments, Busey said.
   ``I'm offering an incentive to encourage executives of airline
companies to monitor personally the safety of their operations as
closely as they monitor the bottom line,'' he said.
   A backlog of several thousand fine cases has plagued the FAA for
several years. Most are for security screening violations at
airports, and Busey said he has not yet decided how to handle them.
   In the past, the FAA has assessed fines of up to $10,000 per
incident for security and maintenance violations even when an
airline reports that it has found the problem itself.
   Busey said the new plan would cover large and small airlines and
apply to any kind of violation.
   ``Make no mistake,'' he warned. ``Our inspectors will continue
to conduct regular inspections and surveillance, and they will
expect and demand 100 percent compliance with rules and
regulations.''
   Robert Aaronson, president of the Air Transport Association,
which represents major carriers, said safety often depends on the
prompt sharing of information about problems among airlines. He
said the new program will encourage that.
   Aaronson said the policy would help ease a longstanding
adversarial relationship in which the FAA acts as ``accuser, jury,
judge and hangman'' in safety violation cases. The agency continues
to have that power, he said, but Busey's approach is an improvement.
   Aaronson said some airlines have been fined after discovering
that an airport screening device was inoperative for an hour,
correcting the problem and then reporting it to the FAA.
   Henry A. Duffy, president of the Air Line Pilots Association,
said penalties should be increased with the voluntary approach.
   ``The voluntary aspect of it is fine,'' he said, ``but there are
always some airlines that require tough enforcement. You've always
got to have that guy with the club.''

   The union representing striking Greyhound bus
drivers is urging the company to couple its offer of rewards for
information about strike-related violence with a return to
negotiations.
   ``Anything that brings criminals to justice is great, but it's
no excuse to stay away from the bargaining table,'' union spokesman
Jeffrey Nelson said Tuesday after Greyhound Lines Inc. said it
would pay $100,000 for information leading to convictions for
shootings at buses or terminals.
   Since the strike started March 2, there have been shooting
attacks on 21 Greyhound buses and two attacks on terminals,
Greyhound vice president P. Anthony Lannie said in announcing the
rewards.
   ``The terrorism must stop,'' Lannie said. ``It's inevitable that
somebody is going to get hurt.''
   No one has been seriously injured in any of the shootings. On
the second day of the walkout, a striking driver in Redding,
Calif., was crushed to death by a bus driven by a replacement
driver. No one was charged.
   ``Certainly, we condemn the violence, but we don't have a hand
in it,'' Nelson said.
   Meanwhile Tuesday in West Hartford, Conn., the case against a
striking driver accused of shooting at a bus two weeks ago was
moved to Hartford Superior Court so officials there can determine
whether more serious charges are warranted.
   Roger Cawthra, 44, is accused of firing the shot that hit the
luggage compartment of a Greyhound bus carrying 19 passengers. No
one was injured.
   Cawthra, the only person who has been arrested in any of the
shootings, was charged with first-degree criminal mischief, a
felony, and three misdemeanors _ first-degree reckless
endangerment, unlawful discharge of a firearm and unlawful
discharge of a firearm on a public highway.
   The union said it is willing to resume negotiations at any time.
Lannie said the company would not resume talks, which broke down 10
days ago in Tucson, Ariz., until management had ``hard assurances''
from the union that the violence would stop.
   Federal mediators are trying to meet separately with both sides,
but no immediate sessions were scheduled, officials said. ``We have
no reason for optimism,'' Greyhound's Lannie said, adding that the
union also would have to soften its wage demands before
negotiations could resume.
   Wages, work rules and job security are the key issues in the
strike, which involves 6,300 drivers and 3,000 other Greyhound
workers.

   The dollar strengthened in calm, early European
trading today, fueled by weakness in the West German mark and
Japanese yen, currency dealers said. Gold prices rebounded.
   Traders said investors were changing their minds about the
dollar as initial euphoria over German unification fades and
uncertainty about the economic costs for the mark emerge.
   Tensions in Lithuania and concern over how Soviet Leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev will handle them were also driving investors away from
the West German currency.
   ``It's more emotional than technical, but people are getting
used to the notion of a stronger dollar again,'' said an analyst in
Milan, Italy.
   Another said: ``People are turning to the dollar from a lack of
choice.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose for the ninth straight day, closing 1.67 yen higher
at 158.63 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 158.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.7162 West German marks, up from 1.7108; 1.5212
Swiss francs, up from 1.5175; 5.7685 French francs, up from 5.7535;
1.9295 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9247; 1,260.00 Italian lire,
up@down from 1,261.75; and 1.1773 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1761.
   The dollar also rose against the British pound, and was quoted
at $1.6221, compared with $1.6255 late Tuesday.
   Gold prices rose in nervous trading.
   The metal opened in London at a bid price of $374.50 a troy
ounce, up from $369.26 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $373.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $373, up from $369.65 late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.15 to close at a bid $374.62.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.01 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $4.98.

<HEAD>Dollar Climbs For Ninth Day Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar climbed today against the yen for a
ninth straight day despite the reported selling of $1 billion by
Japan's central bank and closed at its highest level in more than
three years.
   The rise sent prices plunging on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 158.63 yen in active trading, up 1.67 yen
from Tuesday's close of 156.96 yen. It opened at 158.30 yen and
ranged between 158.15 yen and 158.85 yen.
   The currency now has gained 6.43 yen in Tokyo in nine trading
days.
   The dollar's close was its highest since it finished the day at
158.05 yen on Jan. 12, 1987.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 562.39 points, or 1.77
percent, closing at 31,263.57. The index fell 14.53 points Tuesday,
following a 1,468.33-point surge on Monday.
   An analyst with Nomura Securities Co., who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said stock investors were reluctant to make purchases
because of uncertainies in the market caused by the yen's rapid
decline against the dollar.
   Volume on the first section of the exchange was estimated at 600
million shares, down from 700 million shares on Tuesday.
   A Bank of Tokyo official said the central bank intervened in the
market by selling about $1 billion to prop up the yen. The Bank of
Japan usually does not comment on its market interventions.
   ``Unless the political or economic situation changes, we can
expect this thing to continue,'' Chemical Bank dealer Richard
Cameron said of the dollar's rise.
   ``The dollar has been so strong, and its rising pace is very
fast,'' said Shinichi Kato of Mitsui Bank.
   Kato said large demand for the dollar was pushing the U.S.
currency higher. Importers, many of whom are afraid that the dollar
will rise further, are jumping at the dollar whenever it moves
downward, he said.
   Kato also blamed the lack of coordinated market intervention
among central banks for the dollar's swift ascent.
   ``The Bank of Japan alone can no longer control the situation,''
he said. ``The dollar's upward momentum has become too strong now.''
   At a regular news conference Wednesday, Bank of Japan Governor
Yasushi Mieno said it is hard to understand why the yen continues
to fall when Japan continues to run large trade surpluses.
   High exports would be expected to boost demand for the yen.
   But Mieno suggested that tensions in the Soviet Union and
developments in Europe, together with factors connected with the
end of Japan's fiscal year, were boosting the dollar in foreign
exchange markets.
   The major monetary nations will continue cooperative
intervention aimed at strengthening the yen and chances were good
for stability returning to the market, he said.
   Overall, Mieno said he sees no immediate threats to Japan's
current economic expansion, which has continued for 40 consecutive
months.
   Because the U.S. Federal Reserve Board took no measures in the
market on Tuesday, Japanese market players began to speculate that
the United States approves of the current dollar-yen rate, said
Kato.
   ``The dollar will soon hit the 160-yen level. It's just a matter
of time,'' he added.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds closed
at 86.14 points, up from Tuesday's close of 86.03. Their yield
declined to 7.320 percent from 7.345 percent.

   The U.S. economy posted a 1.1 percent gain
from October through December, the slimmest quarterly advance in
three years, helping slow the increase of goods and services to
just 3 percent in 1989, the government said today.
   The Commerce Department's final revision of its fourth-quarter
gross national product was up slightly from the 0.9 percent gain in
its estimate last month. The department's initial estimate in
January was 0.5 percent.
   While the improvement was modest, it was further evidence the
economy can avoid an immediate recession and continue the longest
peace-time expansion in U.S. history.
   The growth in the final three months of 1989 followed increases
of 3.7 percent in the first quarter, 2.5 percent in the second and
3 percent in the third.
   The 3 percent gain for all of 1989 was the smallest since a 2.7
percent advance in 1986 and followed increases of 4.4 percent in
1988 and 3.7 percent in 1987.
   A consensus of economists had indicated in advance of the latest
report that fourth-quarter growth would remain at 0.9 percent.
   Many analysts, however, believe that while the pace of economic
growth rose further during the current quarter, partly because of
weather-related factors, it will not bounce back in 1990 to the
levels experienced during much of the 1980s.
   In fact, the latest consensus of top economists projects a 1.7
percent growth forecast for this year. That would be the poorest
performance since economic activity declined 2.5 percent in 1982
during the last recession.
   The fourth quarter's 1.1 percent gain was the lowest since a 0.8
percent advance in the third quarter of 1986.
   An inflation index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 4.5
percent last year, the Commerce Department said, the same as its
estimate last month.
   The various changes left the GNP expanding in the fourth quarter
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.17 trillion.
   The department attributed the final revision to an increase in
final sales, which offset a decrease in the amount of inventories.
   The biggest drag on the economy in the fourth quarter was
durable goods, which declined 14 percent.
   Other areas of weakness included capital spending and housing
construction.
   Exports, on the other hand, jumped 9.4 percent in the fourth
quarter, while imports rose just 2.2 percent.
   In a companion report, the department said after-tax profits of
U.S. corporations rose 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter.
   Corporate profits fell during each of the other quarters of 1989
_ 1.1 percent in the first, 7.2 percent in the second and 5.4
percent in the third.
   Profits rose 1.4 percent in the final quarter of 1988.
   The economy grew more than 3 percent during each of the years
since the 1981-1982 recession except when it slowed to a 2.7
percent gain in 1986.
   But even moderate growth relieves recessionary fears that some
felt late in 1989 as the economy slowed as a result of high
interest-rate policies of the Federal Reserve as it sought to stem
inflation.
   David Wyss, chief financial economist for DRI@McGraw-Hill, a
Lexington, Mass., forecasting organization, said he is looking for
1.5 percent growth during the current January-March period, ``which
still is pretty weak by normal standards, but it doesn't look like
we're headed for a recession.''
   A recession usually is defined as two consecutive quarterly
declines in the GNP. The last decline was a one-quarter, 1.8
percent drop in the second quarter of 1986, after which the economy
resumed growth.
   Kathleen Cooper, senior financial economist for Security Pacific
National Bank in Los Angeles, said she expects first-quarter growth
of about 2 percent.
   ``This quarter turned out to be a good deal stronger than we
anticipated,'' she said.
   ``But it may well be that the first quarter will be the
strongest of the year,'' she added, saying 1990 growth would
register between 1.5 percent and 2 percent.
   On the other hand, Michael K. Evans, head of Evans Economics
Inc. here, is forecasting a ``surprisingly robust'' second-quarter
growth of between 3 percent and 4 percent.
   Both Ms. Cooper and Evans said the relatively stronger numbers
means it is unlikely the Federal Reserve will ease its tight-credit
policies. The Bush administration and many economists have urged
the Fed to permit interest rates to fall to stimulate the economy.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's
monetary-policy setting arm, met behind closed doors on Tuesday to
decide on its policies for the next six weeks. As usual, it will
not announce its decision until next month.

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
mixed response to a slightly stronger-than-expected reading on the
state of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.51 to 2,732.43
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers held a narrow edge on gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 433 up, 469 down and
554 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.44 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew at
a 1.1 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the
fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure was revised upward from a previous estimate of 0.9
percent, and came in above most analysts' expectations.
   Many observers viewed it as a modest new indication that the
pace of business activity seemed to be picking up slowly, reducing
the chances of any full-fledged recession.
   At the same time, however, traders also appeared to conclude
that the odds were shifting in favor of higher interest rates in
the months ahead.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
rose &lsqb; to 42&rsqb;; Philip Morris gained | to 40&lsqb;, and McDonald's was up
&lsqb; at 32. But International Business Machines dropped { to 104.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .17 to 187.23. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .42 at 361.46.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 29.28 points
to 2,736.94.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 3 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 889 issues up, 569 down and 505 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 131.61 million shares, up from 116.11

<TEXT>
   Union workers triumphantly marched into a
Colt Manufacturing Co. plant today, ending a strike that lasted
more than four years and that resulted in employees becoming part
owners of the firm.
   About 80 members of United Auto Workers Local 376, carrying
banners proclaiming ``We Beat 'Em And We Bought 'Em,'' proudly
walked into Colt's gritty brick factory building for the start of
the 7 a.m. shift.
   More than 300 co-workers who will return to work over the next
two months lined the streets outside, cheering as the workers took
their first step inside since walking off the job on Jan. 24, 1986.
   ``It's really kinda spooky,'' said Raynold Guerrett, 47, as he
listened to instructions on how to operate some of the new
computerized machinery that has since been installed at the
nation's oldest handgun manufacturer.
   The strike officially ended last Thursday when a buyout
agreement was announced which makes the striking workers co-owners
of the plant along with Colt managers, the state of Connecticut and
private investors.
   About 60 have retired, nearly 40 have died and a few have chosen
to remain at other jobs they found during the strike. But company
officials said 90 percent of the strikers contacted so far said
they planned to return. Some 1,050 UAW Local 376 members walked off
the job after working 10 months without a contract.
   ``It's amazing that so many of them are coming back and left
whatever job they were working at to come back,'' said Ronald E.
Stilwell, executive vice president and chief operating officer of
the new Colt company. ``The enthusiasm is incredible.''
   Thursday's buyout agreement with New York-based Colt Industries,
parent of the gun maker, meant all 600 replacement workers hired to
keep Colt plants in Hartford and West Hartford running during the
strike lost their jobs.
   However, a handful of the replacement workers can expect to be
offered jobs, Stilwell said.
   The new company, formerly known as Colt Industries Firearms
Division, is treating the returning veteran workers as if they were
just hired. Each employee will fill out an application, undergo a
physical, attend an orientation and go through training.
   The new buyout agreement gives the workers a total of $13
million in back pay, settling an unfair labor practices suit
against the company. Workers also got a 13 percent wage increase
and a stock ownership plan which will allow the UAW members to own
11.5 percent of the company.

   Sales of new homes last month rebounded 3.1
percent from steep declines in December and January, the government
reported today, but analysts said sales remained depressed because
of high mortgage interest rates.
   ``It's not a terribly optimistic outlook for the housing
industry,'' said economist Richard Peach of the Mortgage Bankers
Association. ``I don't see much of a decline in rates in the months
ahead and there's substantial risk that they will go higher in the
second half of the year.''
   The Commerce Department said new single-family homes were sold
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 607,000 units in February
after plummeting a 6.8 percent in January and a revised 8.0 percent
in December.
   Sales in both January and February were the lowest since 556,000
homes were sold on an annual basis last March. Sales totaled
589,000 in January.
   Sales in December _ the fourth coldest on record _ had dropped
to 632,000, which was revised down from the 634,000 units
originally reported. But January was the warmest on record and
analysts were surprised at its failure to lure buyers.
   February also was unusually warm but failed to bring sales back
to the level of 649,000 units sold in 1989.
   The National Association of Realtors reported on Monday that
sales of existing homes fell 2.3 percent in February to their
slowest pace in seven months. It blamed the decline on rising
mortgage interest rates.
   Interest on fixed-rate mortgages rose from 10.17 percent at the
beginning of February to 10.31 percent before falling to 10.23
percent at month's end, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.
   Realtors chief economist John A. Tuccillo said Monday that rates
should begin to drop in the months ahead and renew buyer interest.
   The Commerce Department said the median price of a new home
continued to climb in February, rising 4.0 percent to $130,000.
That compared with the Realtors' median price of $95,400 for an
existing home. The median means half of the homes cost more and
half less.
   Sales jumped 21.3 percent to 256,000 units at an annual rate in
the South but fell elsewhere in the nation.
   They were down 18 percent to 82,000 units in the Northeast, 6.4
percent to 88,000 units in the Midwest and 1.6 percent to 181,000
units in the West.

   Peter Lynch, regarded as one of the top stock
managers in the country, announced today he would retire as the
overseer of Fidelity Investments' $13 billion Magellan mutual fund.
   In a statement from the company, Lynch said: ``When I was 10
years old my father died. He was 46. Now I'm 46, and this is very
much on my mind.''
   ``I have been blessed in my 21-year career with Fidelity and I
very much want to give something back to the community,'' he said.
``In addition, I strongly wish to increase my commitment to my
family.''
   Lynch's retirement date will be May 31. The new portfolio
manager of the Magellan fund will be Morris Smith, 33, currently
manager of Fidelity OTC Portfolios.
   Under Lynch, who took over in May 1977, the Magellan fund has
grown sharply. The assets in 1981 were approximately $100 million,
compared with its current $13 billion.
   According to company estimates, $10,000 invested in the fund on
May 31, 1977, would have grown to $270,007 on Dec. 31, 1989.
   During the last five years, when it was the largest common stock
fund in the country, Magellan has outperformed the Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 by an average of 6 percent a year, the company said.
   Despite this success, Lynch indicated recently it was becoming
more difficult to find underperforming stocks that can yield high
returns, since stock prices overall have continued their annual
growth.
   Lynch was elected earlier this month to the Fidelity Group's
board of trustees, and he will join the board in April.
   ``I wouldn't leave Fidelity to manage investments anywhere
else,'' he said. ``I'm not looking for a different situation.''
   Fidelity Chairman and Chief Executive Edward C. Johnson 3rd said
in a statement: ``Even if he never invests another dollar, Peter
Lynch has won a place of honor in the history of money management.''

   House Democratic leaders today predicted early
passage of their version of a major child-care bill, saying a
competing version backed by the White House lacks an important
feature for middle-class familes.
   ``Everybody likes it,'' House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt
said after a closed-door caucus with House Democrats to explain the
leadership's package. ``The Democratic bill is going to win.''
   The Democratic bill is aimed at providing tax credits and other
federal subsidies to help working families find and afford child
care. Also to be voted on is a competing alternative backed by some
conservative Democrats, Republicans and the White House.
   Democrats made their package public Tuesday evening before the
Rules Committee, which sets procedures for handling legislation.
   The leaders planned to send it to the floor Thursday, despite
protests by the Republican minority that it was moving too fast and
they had not been given an advance look at the bill.
   ``We're not trying to redesign at the federal level the
child-care system that's out there,'' said Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., a sponsor of the leadership's bill. ``We're trying to
modestly upgrade it.''
   A major difference between the two versions is that the
Democrats would provide federal funds for school systems to set up
programs of before- and after-school care based in the public
schools.
   Miller, who had been in a series of negotiations with the White
House in a futile effort to reach a bipartisan compromise, attacked
the GOP version today as an ``assault on the public school system''
because it lacks that program.
   Another sponsor, Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., said that program _
providing care for so-called ``latchkey'' children who otherwise
might go unattended _ would assist middle-class families.
   The Senate has approved its version of a child-care bill. The
House approved conflicting versions last year, and its latest
debate is an effort to forge a new position.
   In both bills, the centerpiece is an earned income tax credit
for low-income families with at least one parent working.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, estimated the cost of the leadership's package at
$27 billion over its five-year phase-in.
   But Rep. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., and other Republicans said their
analysis of the Democrats' bill put the cost at $31.3 billion.
   The conservative alternative sponsored by Shaw and Rep. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas, was estimated to cost just under $20 billion.
   ``Thirty-one billion, I think, is pretty hard to justify in
times of scarcity,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn. ``I believe
you're going too far, too fast, too big with this.''
   Reps. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., and Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., both
questioned whether the package of vouchers, tax credits and other
features would actually produce any more child care.
   ``I don't think there's many women's fingerprints on this
bill,'' Slaughter said.
   Both of the competing versions would permit federal subsidies
for care provided by religious-based day care centers _ even those
that provide religious instruction and base hiring decisions on
church membership.
   Other features of the Democratic leadership's bill would expand
the Head Start program, at a cost of $600 million a year, and spend
$2.9 billion on the Social Services Block Grant program to allow
states to subsidize care, including the use of vouchers.
   The Democratic bill also includes $3.3 billion to finance a new
school-based program for before- and after- school care. The
Stenholm-Shaw bill has no such program.
   Both measures would finance the package in part by reducing or
eliminating the existing dependent care tax credit for upper-income
families, beginning with those earning $70,000 a year.
   The Democrats would finance part of the package, $13 billion
over five years, by extending the excise tax on telephone service.
Sponsors acknowledged that the revenue sources they had identified
would not cover the full cost.

   The stock market barely budged today in an
indifferent response to a slightly stronger-than-expected reading
on the state of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up .22 to 2,737.16
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers held a narrow edge on gainers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 572 up, 594 down and
528 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 50.63 million shares at
midmorning.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew at
a 1.1 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the
fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure was revised upward from a previous estimate of 0.9
percent, and came in above most analysts' expectations.
   Many observers viewed it as a modest new indication that the
pace of business activity seemed to be picking up slowly, reducing
the chances of any full-fledged recession.
   At the same time, however, traders also appeared to conclude
that the odds were shifting in favor of higher interest rates in
the months ahead.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph

   Grain and soybean futures prices were lower in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, extending the
modest losses posted in the previous session amid slack export
demand and a sharp drop in soybean oil.
   Analysts said a large brokerage house sold soybean oil contracts
aggressively at the opening, triggering further selling in soybean
oil and the adjacent soybean and soybean meal pits.
   Corn and wheat futures were pressured by slack export demand and
forecasts for rain in the western Corn Belt, promising improved
soil moisture as the spring planting season nears.
   Mark Weidner, a soybean market analyst with Cargill Investor
Services Inc., said trading activity was growing increasingly
cautious ahead of Friday's Agriculture Department reports on
quarterly grain stocks and spring planting intentions.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1{ cents to 2{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in May at $3.52{ a bushel; corn was
} cent to 1} cents lower with May at $2.60{ a bushel; oat futures
were 2{ cents to 2} cents lower with May at $1.45\ a bushel;
soybeans were 3{ cents to 6 cents lower with May at $5.94{ a bushel.

   A government policy giving women and minority
groups preferences in the award of broadcast licenses discriminates
unlawfully against white males and is a failure, the Supreme Court
was told today.
   But lawyers for the Federal Communications Commission and a
Hispanic-owned company defended the congressionally sanctioned
policy as a legitimate means of promoting diversity over the
airwaves.
   The justices heard arguments in cases from Florida and
Connecticut that could have major impact on a broad range of
affirmative action programs. The court is expected to rule by July.
   Gregory H. Guillot, representing a broadcasting company denied a
license that was awarded to a Hispanic-owned rival, said the FCC
``policy is a complete, total failure. It's bad, ineffective and
unconstitutional.''
   He also said the policy has increased minority ownership of
television and radio stations by only one percent in 18 years.
   ``I'm no mathematician. But that means there will be 600 years
left'' for the policy to achieve equal racial representation in the
broadcast industry, he said.
   Margaret Polivy, a lawyer for the Hispanic-owned company, said
Congress has identified women and minorities as ``missing voices''
in the mass media and has taken legitimate steps to remedy the
problem.
   Achieving equality is ``a concept that underlies our
democracy,'' she said.
   Justice Antonin Scalia said promoting a colorblind society is
equally important. He said the idea that government benefits should
not be awarded because of ``the color of our skin ... also
underlies our democracy.''
   Daniel M. Armstrong, representing the FCC, said it is vital for
minorities and women to be given a greater voice in the media.
   ``Broadcasting has the power to shape opinion that few
industries can match,'' he said. ``Some race-conscious steps are
necessary.''
   The FCC's defense of affirmative action has prompted a split
with the Justice Department, which has raised the specter of
unconstitutional reverse discrimination and has said the FCC
programs lack justification.
   The high court dealt a major setback to affirmative action last
year when it struck down a Richmond, Va., program that set aside a
chunk of local public works contracts for minority-owned businesses.
   The 6-3 ruling cast doubt on the constitutionality of numerous
affirmative action plans of states and cities but had no direct
bearing on federal programs.
   A less conservative high court in 1980 upheld a federal public
works program that set aside 10 percent of the funds for minority
contracts. That decision said Congress has special constitutional
authority to approve such preferences.
   The FCC policies have been the focus of a lengthy dispute
between Congress and federal officials.
   The commission adopted the policies when President Carter was in
office but disavowed them during the Reagan administration and
started making plans to dismantle the affirmative action programs.
   Congress in 1987 barred the FCC from spending money to restudy
or repeal the policies, and that prohibition remains in effect.
   At issue in the case from Florida is the FCC policy of giving
minorities and women extra credit when evaluating their
applications for new television and radio station licenses.
   A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Washington upheld preferential treatment in the award of a TV
license in Orlando to the Hispanic-owned Rainbow Broadcasting Co. A
rival, Metro Broadcasting Inc., said it should have received the
license.
   In the Connecticut case, a different panel of the same appeals
court struck down the FCC's so-called distress-sale policy. That
policy allows a broadcaster faced with loss of its license to sell
it to a minority-owned business at 75 percent of market value.
   The appeals court overturned the award of a license in Hartford
to Hispanic-led Astroline Communications Co. and gave it instead to
Alan Shurberg, a non-Hispanic.
   The Justice Department, in a legal brief filed with the high
court, said the FCC's preferential policies lack ``coherence.''
   ``The commission's use of racial preferences remains today as
much as ever a policy in search of a purpose and an adequate
supporting record,'' department lawyers said. ``Racial
classifications, when imposed by the government, must at a minimum
reflect the deliberate judgment of a competent authority that such
measures are necessary for specific purposes.''
   The cases are Metro Broadcasting vs. FCC, 89-453, and Astroline
Communications vs. Shurger Broadcasting, 89-700.

   Four European airlines have joined forces in an
effort to cut costs, planning to buy 239 new planes together and
inviting two aircraft manufacturers to submit bids.
   The four airlines are seeking bids from McDonnell Douglas Corp.
of the United States for its not-yet-completed MD-90 aircraft and
from Airbus Industrie, a European consortium, for its A320 and A321
jets, according to a newspaper report.
   It is believed to be the most ambitious attempt by airlines to
collaborate in an effort to reduce the cost of their jet purchases
by placing a group order.
   Don Hanson, a spokesman for McDonnell Douglas' aircraft
subsidiary, was quoted by the International Herald Tribune as
saying the order would be one of the largest in airline industry
history.
   Industry experts say that on the basis of Airbus' prices, a
group order for 239 planes would be worth around $10 billion.
   Airbus confirmed Wednesday that it received a preliminary
request for bids from the four airlines: Swissair, Scandinavian
Airlines System, Austrian Airlines and Finnair.
   Airbus is a consortium grouping Aerospatiale of France,
Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm GMBH of West Germany, British Aerospace
PLC and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain.
   SAS is estimated to have a long-term requirement for 126 new
aircraft, while Swissair will need 52, Austrian Airlines 26 and
Finnair 35.

   They also were boosted at the outset by a strong showing on Wall

   The Senate battle to enact tougher air
pollution controls moved closer to a conclusion today as senators
debated the effect the bill will have on Midwest utilities and coal
miners.
   Senate leaders reiterated that they planned to bring the clean
air bill to a final vote next week after receiving approval from
fellow senators Tuesday night to limit debate on the complex and
controversial legislation.
   Several hours of debate today focused on the concerns of Midwest
senators over the cost of proposed acid rain pollution controls on
utiltities in that part of the country and the effect on
high-sulfur coal miners.
   But by a vote of 72 to 25, the Senate rejected a proposal that
would have provided those utilities a 20 percent tax credit if they
used ``scrubber'' technology for pollution control, instead of
switching to other fuels.
   The measure was aimed at helping coal miners who stand to lose
up to 5,000 jobs because of the new air pollution controls if
Midwest utilities switch to other fuels.
   Sen. Arlen Spector, R-Pa., sponsor of the bill, said the credit
was needed for Midwest utilities to comply with new pollution
control requirements and avoid severe electric rate increases. But
critics said taxpayers nationwide should not have to help pay for
cleaning up the Midwest's dirty power plants.
   Meanwhile, about 500 coal miners and their families rallied
outside the Capitol in a protest against the acid rain provisions
in the bill, saying the requirements would force them out of jobs.
   The Senate agreed Tuesday night to limit debate on the clean air
bill and bring the measure to a vote next week. The agreement
represented a major step toward passing the first clean air
legislation by the Senate in 13 years.
   ``We're clearly now going to finish this bill by a specific
time,'' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said after
he received his colleagues' approval to schedule a final vote for
April 3.
   ``The pressure now is going to be for the senators to bring
their (remaining) amendments to the floor. The reality now is that
time is going to run out,'' said Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the
minority leader.
   Meanwhile in the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee
continues today to consider what is expected to be a string of
amendments to its clean air legislation. Rep. John Dingell,
R-Mich., the panel's chairman, hopes to send a bill to the floor
before the Easter recess.
   The committee was expected today to consider an amendment that
would require a phase-in of alternative fuel vehicles in urban
areas with the worst smog. A similar requirement failed to win
Senate approval.
   The announcement by Mitchell of a time limit for debating the
clean air bill came late Tuesday after the Senate grappled most of
the day with a proposal to ease permit requirements for businesses.
The Senate rejected the measure by a vote of 50-47, although
industry complained the new requirements would create a
``bureaucratic nightmare.''
   ``We've been here a long time now and the end is in sight,''
declared Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., one of the bill's floor managers.
   The Senate began considering the clean air bill in late January,
worked out a compromise with the White House during three weeks of
closed-door negotiations and has been debating the compromise since
March 5.
   Both the Senate and House bills would require a wide range of
pollution controls on industry, automobiles and electric power
plants in hopes of dramatically reducing acid rain and bringing air
quality within federal standards in most urban areas by the turn of
the century.
   More than a week ago, Mitchell was thwarted from getting
agreement on a time limit for consideration of the bill. But
Tuesday night, Mitchell tried again and this time obtained
unanimous consent to schedule a final vote for 8 p.m. next Tuesday.
   Meanwhile, behind-the-scenes discussions continued in an attempt
to work out an agreement with Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., over his
proposal to provide financial assistance to coal miners who lose
their jobs because of new restrictions under the legislation.
Mitchell said if no compromise was reached he planned a vote on the
Byrd proposal for Thursday.
   Byrd earlier had been widely believed to have enough votes to
pass his amendment, but Mitchell refused to bring it to a vote.
   The White House has called the $500 million measure too
expensive and Mitchell has expressed concern that its passage might
threaten the overall clean air bill.
   Democratic and Republican sources in the Senate suggested
Tuesday that it was unlikely that Bush would want to endanger
enactment of a clean air bill solely because of the coal miner
assistance provision.

   Japan is considering revising a law that limits the
opening of of large foreign stores, a key issue in trade
negotiations with the United States, government officials indicated
Wednesday.
   Kabun Muto, minister of International Trade and Industry, told
business leaders that anything short of a change in the Large-Scale
Retail Store Law is unlikely to satisfy U.S. negotiators in next
week's trade meetings in Washington.
   ``The U.S. is quite adamant on the issue,'' Kyodo News Service
quoted Muto as saying. ``I am quite worried that our proposal for
only improving enforcement of the law may not get us off the hook.''
   At Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu's request, the government has
created a series of proposals aimed at satisfying U.S. requests in
the so-called Structural Impediments Initiative talks. The talks
are aimed at eliminating factors in each country's economy that
hinder reductions in their $49 billion trade imbalance.
   U.S. and Japanese negotiators are to exchange interim reports on
their progress during the fourth round of the talks, set for next
Monday and Tuesday in Washington.
   The United States reportedly has made more than 200 proposals
for eliminating what it contends are barriers to foreign
involvement in Japan's economic and business structure.
   Government officials have declined to disclose the contents of
the proposals, but have acknowledged that scrapping the Large-Scale
Store Law is one of three major U.S. demands.
   The law requires large stores to obtain a consensus from small,
local shop keepers before opening a new outlet in a given area.
Otherwise, the large stores must wait as long as eight or 10 years.
   In contrast, many Japanese retailers such as Mitsukoshi and
Tokyu department stores and Yaohan supermakets already have opened
stores in the United States.
   In a test of the barriers, the government has agreed to consider
a request by U.S. toy retailer Toys R Us Inc. to open a
53,800-square-foot discount store in Niigata, 160 miles northwest
of Tokyo.
   U.S. officials say such large-scale stores are more likely to
carry more foreign products, leading to an increase in Japan's
imports.
   Japanese business leaders have expressed strong opposition to
Muto's idea of relaxing the law because it would hurt small shop
owners.
   ``Before we review the law itself, we should monitor the
enforcement of the law first,'' said Rokuro Ishikawa, president of
the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, one of Japan's most
powerful business organizations.
   Opposition also has been expressed within the governing Liberal
Democartic Party against the administration's plan to revise the
law.
   A senior party official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said legislators opposing the change were concerned about losing
political support from small shop owners, who are among the party's
traditional backers.
   ``I think most of us understand logically that the U.S. demands
make sense and are good for Japan, but many politicians are
reluctant to pay the political cost for the benefit of others,'' he
said.
   ``Also as a party, we have to worry about whether we are able to
win the opposition camp's approval to pass a revision of the law in
Parliament,'' he added.
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party has the power to decide
the content of trade proposals Japanese negotiators will present to
their American counterparts in next week's talks, but any legal
changes must clear the opposition-dominated upper house.
   On Wednesday, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto told that Kaifu
a rapid, sharp increase in Japan's public works spending _ another
U.S. proposal _ was not possible.
   The United States has proposed Japan increase public works
spending to 10 percent of gross national product.
   The finance minister said he rejected the U.S. demand for the
increase when he met with U.S. leaders last week in Washington.

   The stock market eged higher today as traders
studied a slightly stronger-than-expected reading on the state of
the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.38 to 2,740.32 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers held a narrow edge on losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 701 up, 697 down and
548 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew at
a 1.1 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the
fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure was revised upward from a previous estimate of 0.9
percent, and came in above most analysts' expectations.
   Many observers viewed it as a modest new indication that the
pace of business activity seemed to be picking up slowly, reducing
the chances of any full-fledged recession.
   At the same time, however, traders also appeared to conclude
that the odds were shifting in favor of higher interest rates in
the months ahead.
   American General jumped 7} to 39} as the most active NYSE issue
on word that the company had attracted a takeover bid from
Torchmark.
   Oracle Systems, which posted flat quarterly profits that fell
short of advance estimates, tumbled 7} to 17| in the
over-the-counter market.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .30 to 187.70. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .74 at 361.14.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 118.70 million shares with an

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Tumble On Heavy Speculative Selling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Wednesday on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid heavy speculative selling that
partly reflected profit-taking and greater supply prospects. Grain
futures closed moderately lower.
   Analysts said the soybean sell-off began at the opening bell
when at least two large commodity brokerage houses aggressively
sold soybean oil contracts, triggering a plunge to two-week lows in
the oil market.
   The selling quickly spread to the adjacent soybean and soybean
meal pits, spurred on by reports of ideal harvesting weather for
the South American soybean crop and forecasts for beneficial rain
in the Midwest and northern Great Plains, the main regions for U.S.
soybean, corn and spring wheat production.
   ``Oil took a big hit on the opening and we never really
recovered,'' said Victor Lespinasse, a trader in Chicago for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Further selling was tied to positioning ahead of Friday's
Agriculture Department reports on quarterly grain stocks and spring
planting intentions, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2\ cents to 4 cents lower with
the contract for delivery in May at $3.51 a bushel; corn was 2
cents to 3 cents lower with May at $2.59\ a bushel; oats were 2
cents to 2{ cents lower with May at $1.45} a bushel; soybeans were
6 cents to 10\ cents lower with May at $5.90\ a bushel.

   Stock prices closed higher Wednesday in dull
trading after an early rally ran out of steam.
   Prices rose in early trading on strong buying in the stock index
futures market, dealers said.
   They also were boosted at the outset by a strong showing on Wall
Street Tuesday and a steadier performance from the pound, they said.
   But activity turned dull, as the market searched in vain for
direction, they said.
   The lack of substantive corporate or economic news also hemmed
the market in, traders said, with little prospect on the horizon
for an improvement in trading conditions.
   ``I don't know what it's going to take to get the market out of
its slump,'' one dealer said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index was up 8.8
points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,275.0, roughly halfway between the
session minimum of 2,270.8 and the peak of 2,280.4.
   Volume amounted to a modest 359.5 million shares compared with
385.9 million shares Tuesday.

<HEAD>Cocoa-Trading Nations Agree To Finance Cocoa Pact Extension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa-trading nations agreed Wednesday to finance
a two-year extension of the cocoa pact that will delay the sale of
stockpiled beans into the current glutted market.
   ``The finance is guaranteed,'' said West Germany's Peter Baron,
who is chairing talks at the 41-nation International Cocoa
Organization on the future of the current cocoa pact.
   Unless the producer-consumer treaty is extended for two years
from October 1, the organization's 250,000-ton stockpile must be
sold off within five years.
   This would have serious consequences for prices, which are
already close to their lowest for 14 years, following five seasons
of world overproduction.
   The two sides agreed earlier this week to back an extension of
the agreement, but consuming nations said they wanted financing
settled before giving their formal approval.
   Following a full meeting of producers and consumers Wednesday,
Baron said that ``an overwhelming majority'' agreed that financing
should be assured through either payment by producers of some of
their debts, or limited sales from the stockpile during the
two-year extension period.
   Unless producers pay some of their accumulated debts of more
than $140 million, the cocoa organization expects to find itself
$15 million short of the funds needed to finance a two-year
extension.
   The bulk of the cash will be needed to finance the storage of
the stockpile until Sept. 30, 1992.
   It was agreed Wednesday that if the organization came close to
its financial limits it should be ``empowered to sell cocoa to
bridge any gap,'' Baron said.
   There had been doubts about the producers' readiness to accept
this, delegates said.
   The organization also agreed in principle that the levy of $30 a
ton on internationally traded cocoa should cease April 15, Baron
said.
   The failure of producers to pay the cocoa organization this levy
charged on their exports is the cause of their debts.
   Consuming nations, which have been paying the levy on imports
from non-cocoa-organization members, have long pressed for its
cessation.
   Delegates said Wednesday they foresee no problems in a formal
decision to extend the pact on Friday, the last scheduled day of
the talks.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. junk bond
wizard Michael Milken taught math for a day at the 102nd Street
Elementary School, then handed out calculators to grateful pupils.
   Arco Corp. President Robert E. Wycoff sat in the principal's
office at Manual Arts High School to get a crash course on its
students.
   A GTE Telephone Operations president settled in at Bethune
Junior High School while a Toyota Motors USA's senior vice
president went to North High School in Torrance.
   More than 40 executives in all participated Tuesday in a
``principal for a day'' program, designed in part to help corporate
America determine what it can do to improve the nation's schools.
   The Los Angeles Educational Partnership, the program's sponsor,
has raised $10 million since 1984 to fund projects by innovative
teachers, a program to prevent students from dropping out and the
introduction of new curriculums.
   ``There is a growing sense of frustration that the reform
efforts haven't worked and that more radical steps are needed,''
said Virgil Roberts, the partnership's chairman.
   The group hopes to draw attention to the schools through its
``Educational Partnership Week'' activities.
   Nationwide, businesses have established more than 140,000
partnerships with public schools, according to the U.S. Department
of Education.
   Milken, who set up his own investment management firm based in
Los Angeles last year after leaving Drexel, has been involved in
numerous charitable efforts, many involving education.
   Milken left Drexel last year after he was indicted on 98 counts
of securities fraud and racketeering. He has pleaded innocent and
is expected to go to trial in New York on new charges. Drexel is
going out of business after its parent filed for bankruptcy
protection.
   Arco's Wycoff said he was impressed by what he saw Tuesday at
the inner-city Manual Arts High School _ especially by English
teacher Jo Zarro's composition class.
   ``I like her, I like her enthusiasm. Is there any way you can
reward her?'' Wycoff asked principal Marvin Starr. ``Only with
praise,'' Starr said.
   Some educators said there are drawbacks to a corporate presence
in the classroom.
   ``Self-interest is the primary motivation of most of those
involved in school reform, and at times interests of a particular
constituency are at odds with what is good for schoolchildren,''
said Lewis C. Solmon, dean of the Graduate School of Education at
the University of California, Los Angeles.
   He said some firms are more interested in selling computers,
textbooks and other material than in improving school performance.
   But Michael W. Kirst, an education professor at Stanford
University, said businesses are in schools ``because they saw the
work force quality was dropping.''
   ``If they were happy with the quality of the public schools they
would pull back from education and go on to such issues as housing,
transportation or taxes,'' he said.

<HEAD>Import Dealers Say Iacocca Blames Problems on Consumers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Import car dealers counterattacked Wednesday as
Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca continued his road show to tout
his company's cars as being just as good as Japan's.
   As Iacocca visited New York on his six-city tour in search of
image and market share, the Washington-based American International
Automobile Dealers Association accused him of blaming consumers for
poor sales of U.S. cars.
   ``Lee Iacocca became famous for ending his commercials by saying
`If you can find a better-built car, buy it.' Now he is complaining
because the American consumers have taken his advice,'' said the
group's president, Walter E. Huizenga.
   ``I was not aware they were outselling us, so that's a little
off base,'' responded Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski.
   Chrysler's 1989 domestic sales totaled 917,506 cars. Among the
imports, Honda was closest at 389,472.
   Cars with Japanese nameplates made up 25.8 percent of the U.S.
car market, up from 21.1 percent in 1982. The share held by the Big
Three of Chrysler, General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. slipped
from 69.8 percent to 67.5 percent during that period.
   In 1989, for the first time, the best-selling car had an import
nameplate _ Honda Accord _ although 60 percent of Honda Accords are
built in the United States.
   Chrysler has launched national television advertisements
featuring Iacocca contending that Chrysler's quality was as good as
Japan's. ``Nobody knows it, and that's going to change,'' he says
in the commercials.
   Iacocca launched the current six-city tour earlier this month,
traveling with an array of 1990 Chrysler models and executives to
talk about the cars.
   In addition to touting Chrysler, Iacocca has been criticizing
trade barriers that keep U.S. companies from competing in Japanese
markets.
   ``What we sell in one year in Japan they sell in 46 hours here.
This crap has got to stop,'' Iacocca said at Wednesday's New York
news conference.
   The import association represents 9,700 dealers selling Japanese
and other imported cars. Among other things, it lobbies for an end
to the voluntary import restraints on Japanese automakers,
spokesman Paul Donnellan said.
   ``The free market is an excellent barometer of relative
automobile quality and the American consumer is an excellent judge
of that quality. They know the quality of imported cars is better _
and they are better. No amount of complaining is going to change
that,'' Huizenga said.
   The group said Japanese vehicles sold under Chrysler nameplates,
such as the Dodge Colt and Ram 50 pickup truck, accounted for 7
percent of Chrysler's 1989 sales. It also said more than half the
400,000 Plymouth and Dodge minivans sold last year had Mitsubishi
engines.
   Jakobowski said Chrysler wasn't bashing imports or telling
Americans not to buy them.
   ``What we are saying is Chrysler builds as good a product or
better,'' he said. ``What we are doing is speaking out to dispel
the myth that U.S. cars are inferior.''

   Economic activity reached five-year highs during
the fourth quarter in 18 of the nation's 24 biggest cities,
according to a survey released Wednesday by the consulting firm
Grant Thornton.
   The quarterly survey indicated that, based on an index measuring
a number of indicators, San Diego led in economic activity during
the final three months of 1989, followed by Minneapolis-St. Paul,
Cincinnati, Atlanta and Milwaukee.
   Minneapolis-St. Paul, Milwaukee and Cincinnati had the greatest
gains in economic activity over the final quarter of 1988, while
Milwaukee, Los Angeles and Phoenix showed the greatest improvement
from 1989's third quarter.
   Over the past five years, the oil-belt cities of Houston, Denver
and Dallas showed the least improvement based on the index.
However, all three cities were in the top 10 for improvement over
fourth quarter 1988, while Denver and Houston still were at their
peaks from the January 1985 base for the index.
   Boston, Phoenix and Cleveland showed overall declines in the
economic indicators during 1989. On a third- to fourth-quarter
basis, only Seattle showed a decline.
   The index compiled by Grant Thornton, an international
accounting and management consulting firm, evaluates factory hours,
employment, construction permits, retail sales, business starts and
failures and money supply in 24 cities around the country.
   Of the 24 cities tracked by Grant Thornton, the six that did not
reach a five-year peak in economic activity at the end of 1989 were
Seattle, Cleveland, Phoenix, Boston, New York and Dallas.
   The survey found that a common thread among the fastest-growing
metropolitan areas was job growth. Over the five-year period, San
Diego added more than 165,000 jobs, a gain of 20 percent. The
Minneapolis-St. Paul work force increased by more than 155,000, or
13 percent, and job growth in Cincinnati was more than 110,000, or
17 percent.

   Stock prices drifted aimlessly Wednesday,
drawing little inspiration from a stronger-than-expected reading on
the state of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 10 points at
its early low, closed with a 6.75 gain at 2,743.69.
   But declining issues nose out advances in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 724 up, 731 down and
529 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 142.30 million
shares, against 131.61 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 171.38 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that the gross national product
grew at a 1.1 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation,
in the fourth quarter of last year.
   The figure was revised upward from a previous estimate of 0.9
percent, and came in higher than most analysts' expectations.

   At the same time, however, traders also appeared to conclude
that the odds were shifting in favor of higher interest rates in
the months ahead. Rates managed to post small declines in the
government securities market Wednesday.
   With two trading days left in the first quarter of 1990, the Dow
Jones industrial average shows a loss of slightly less than 10
points since New Year's.
   American General jumped 8&lsqb; to 40&lsqb; as Wednesday's most active
NYSE stock on word that the company had attracted a takeover bid
from Torchmark.
   Oil service stocks were another bright spot. Schlumberger, which
said it held a ``positive'' meeting with analysts on Tuesday, rose
2 to 52&rsqb;.
   Elsewhere in the group, Halliburton gained 1 to 45~ and Baker
Hughes added 1 to 27}.
   Apple Bancorp climbed 9&lsqb; to 41&rsqb;. Real estate investor Stanley
Stahl said he launched an unsolicited bid for the company at $38 a

   Gainers among the blue-chip industrials included International
Business Machines, up 1&rsqb; at 105~; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph,

   Oracle Systems, which posted flat quarterly profits that fell
short of advance estimates, tumbled 7~ to 17{ in the
over-the-counter market.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $1.12 billion, or 0.03
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .37 to 187.77.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose .33 to 396.81, and S&amp;P's

   Richard Miller, president of Wang Laboratories
Inc., was named the company's new chairman and chief executive
officer Wednesday, succeeding the computer maker's founder, An
Wang, who died of cancer last weekend.
   The board of directors' action was expected by analysts, who
noted that Miller already assumed much of the leadership last year
when he was named president.
   ``(Miller) basically has the future of the company on his
shoulders,'' said George Elling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. ``Now we have to see whether his strategy ... to re-establish
the company can succeed. I think the jury is still out.''
   Miller already has begun reorganizing the company to reverse
recent losses, though he noted Wednesday that the current quarter's
loss probably will be larger than originally expected.
   Also, while Miller last fall predicted the company could return
to profitability by the end of its fiscal year on June 30, he said
Wednesday that the company expects ``losses for the balance of the
fiscal year.''
   ``Industry conditions remain extremely difficult,'' Miller said
in a statement, ``but we believe we have in place the programs
necessary to complete the turnaround.''
   Wang's class B shares closed at $5.37{ Wednesday on the New York
Stock Exchange, down 50 cents. Miller's appointment and comments
about losses were made shortly before the market closed.
   Miller, a former General Electric Co. executive, became
president last August after Wang's son, Frederick Wang, was forced
from the job.
   Wang posted a $424.3 million loss for the year that ended last
June 30.
   Wang became a leading computer company largely by making word
processors. But analysts say the Lowell-based company stumbled when
it failed to react quickly to the emergence of personal computers
in the 1980s, which replaced much of the need for word processors.
   Wang then shifted its strategy to mid-size minicomputers, but
that market has been slumping as the smaller desktop computers grow
more powerful and are being connected in networks.
   ``The company has been floundering the past few years to find a
strategy,'' Elling said. The projected deepening losses this
quarter are not unexpected, he said, adding, ``The real issue is
whether they can turn it around, if ever.''
   The Wang family expressed support for Miller's strategies.
   ``We have complete confidence in Rick Miller and the long-term
plan now being carried out to return Wang Laboratories to
profitability,'' Frederick Wang said in a statement, speaking on
behalf of his family.
   The family effectively has control over the company, with the
power to elect three-quarters of the board of directors.
   Part of Miller's strategy has been to trim the company's costs
and reduce its debt through layoffs and selling assets. At the same
time, he has declared that the company will be more responsive to
the needs of customers _ one of its shortfalls, according to
analysts.
   ``Although additional restructuring will occur, we have already
made significant progress,'' Miller said.
   Miller said the company is on target to reduce its bank debt to
less than $93 million, down from $575 million. The company also has
reduced operational expenses by over $300 million annually.
   Wang now employs about 22,500 people, compared with 28,000 at
the end of the last fiscal year.
   Miller will continue serving as the company's president. The
board also elected Lorraine C. Wang, wife of the late chairman, to
the newly created position of honorary chairperson. Mrs. Wang was a
founding director of the company.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower Except Against Yen; Gold Up Slightly</HEAD>
<HEAD>Precedes LONDON BC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply Wednesday against the
Japanese yen despite reports of intervention by the Federal
Reserve, but it fell against all other major currencies in light,
trendless trading.
   Gold prices were slightly higher following a mixed performance
overseas.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $369 a troy ounce, up 30 cents from late
Tuesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $369.35 an ounce, up 50 cents. Currency dealers attributed
the dollar's decline against the European currencies, in part, to
traders trying to cash in on the dollar's recent gains. But they
said the market lacked a clear direction.
   ``There has been no fundamental forces to really drive it,''
said James T. McGroarty, a senior vice president at Greenwich
Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn.
   The end of Japan's fiscal year, however, has been raising the
demand for dollars among Japanese corporate dealers to shore up
accounts, he said. Japan's new fiscal year begins April 1.
   The Fed reportedly sold modest amounts of dollars for yen at
around 159.10 yen, which helped dampen the dollar's advance,
dealers said. But they said they expected the dollar to hold above
158 yen in the near term, barring further concerted intervention
from central banks.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose for the ninth straight day, closing 1.67 yen higher
at 158.63 yen. It also traded at 158.63 yen in London, and at
158.595 yen in New York, up from 157.635 yen Tuesday.
   The dollar was weaker against the British pound. Sterling rose
to $1.6285 from $1.6255 in London, and to $1.6270 from $1.6260 in
New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.7105 West German marks, down from 1.7128; 1.5170 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5183; 5.7490 French francs, down from 5.7610;
1,256.50 Italian lire, down from 1,258.50; and 1.17545 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.17655.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday: 1.7078 West
German marks, down from 1.7108; 1.5135 Swiss francs, down from
1.5173; 5.7410 French francs, down from 5.7535; 1.9218 Dutch
guilders, down from 1.9247; 1,255.25 Italian lire, down from
1,261.75; and 1.1758 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1761.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $370.15 an ounce, up
from $369.25 Tuesday. But in Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of
$369 an ounce from $369.65.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.15 to close at $374.62 an
ounce.
   Silver prices lost ground. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $4.917 a troy ounce, down from
$4.954 late Tuesday. Silver fell in London to $4.95 an ounce from
$4.98.

   Daniel Tellep scolds Harold Simmons in
full-page newspaper ads. Simmons chides Tellep in double-page ads.
Their faceoff over who should control Lockheed Corp. will dominate
the company's annual meeting Thursday.
   But there's plenty in common between Tellep, Lockheed's
chairman, and Simmons, who paid $524 million for 19 percent of
Lockheed's stock and who now wants Tellep and other board members
voted out.
   Each has a big stake in the future of the aerospace giant. Each
professes to find promise in that future, although their visions
differ, with Simmons wanting to carve away far more of the
company's non-core businesses.
   And each has been wooing the big pension funds and other
institutions that hold 60 percent of the stock in Lockheed and
could provide the margin of victory.
   Lockheed's stock, which traded as high as $54.75 during the
third quarter of 1989, closed at $36.87{ a share on Wednesday.
Simmons has shown a paper loss of $100 million on his investment.
   ``Obviously, I wouldn't have bought the shares we did at $48 or
$49 if I'd known it was going to fall. I would have waited,'' said
J. Landis Martin, Simmons' chief strategist. ``But we're very
enthusiastic about the prospects for Lockheed and for its share
price, particularly if we win.''
   Martin predicted Lockheed employees, who own about 19 percent of
the company's stock, would back Tellep by as much as 95 percent.
That could effectively cancel Simmons' vote for his 19 percent
stake, leaving the decision to the big investors, several of whom
recently decided to back Simmons.
   The results of the battle to elect Simmons' slate of directors
won't be known until at least next week, after proxy votes are
totaled by a company in Delaware. The same goes for results of
votes on shareholders rights proposals Simmons backs, such as
elimination of Lockheed's takeover defenses.
   Simmons, Lockheed's largest shareholder, began his proxy battle
after his request for six seats on the 15-person board of directors
was rejected.
   Other big shareholders persuaded Simmons about 10 days ago to
accept a compromise to give him three seats, but Tellep rejected
that plan when the other shareholders brought it to him, Martin
said Wednesday.
   In an interview Monday, Tellep described meeting with Simmons on
Jan. 31. He said Simmons first demanded six seats and that Lockheed
do away with its ``poison pill'' anti-takeover provision that makes
it prohibitively expensive for a hostile buyer to acquire more than
20 percent of the company's stock.
   The failure of the compromise set the stage for a showdown at
Thursday's annual meeting. Simmons is expected to attend the
meeting, to be held in a hangar not far from the ``skunk works''
where Lockheed's SR-71 ``Blackbird'' spy plane and stealth fighter
were born.
   The company began a major restructuring last year, promising to
become leaner and more competitive in the face of shrinking defense
budgets. It began selling about $200 million in non-core businesses.
   Lockheed also took nearly $500 million in charges related to
cost overruns on fixed-price development programs, including one
for a submarine-hunting plane. That helped depress earnings to $2
million, or 3 cents a share, from $624 million, or $10.37 a share,
the previous year.
   Now, Tellep says Lockheed's ready for a turnaround.
   ``We did have a tough year last year, but I believe the plan
that we put in place will begin to show results this year,'' he
said.
   Simmons also talks about refocusing Lockheed on its core
businesses of space, missiles and aeronautics. He has strongly
suggested he will sell $1 billion in less lucrative operations from
Lockheed's technology services and electronic systems divisions _
divestitures Tellep says are ill-advised at this time.
   Tellep and Simmons have battled in a series of newspaper ads
aimed at Lockheed investors and workers. Simmons has said he will
spend about $6 million in the proxy fight, Lockheed $8 million.
   Lockheed's ads portrayed Simmons as an opportunistic corporate
raider seeking to control Lockheed primarily for his own gain.
   Simmons has countered by pressing his arguments that he could
run Lockheed better.
   In one particularly caustic ad, Simmons provided his
``translation'' of statements from Lockheed's annual report. A
sample:
   Lockheed: We characterize 1989 as a transitional year which
prepared us for strong financial performance in 1990 and beyond.
   Simmons: 1989 was a bad year.
   L: Lockheed's sales increased slightly when adjusted for the
completion of the C-5B program.
   S: Sales are down $541 million. But they're up if you count
business we don't have anymore.
   L: Early this year, we agreed with the customer that work on
future phases of this (C-17) program will be performed by another
supplier.
   S: We got fired.

   An excess supply of crude oil in the nation's
storage tanks dragged crude futures prices lower Wednesday on the
New York Mercantile Exchange, while a decline in product
inventories strengthened gasoline and heating oil prices.
   Trading in the energy markets was driven mainly by new
statistics from the American Petroleum Institute showing a
higher-than-expected increase in crude stocks and sharply lower
supplies of refined products, including gasoline.
   ``The markets seemed to act just as the APIs would dictate,''
said Stefanie Rzasa, an energy broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The May contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S.
grade of crude oil, tumbled 40 cents to $20.08 a barrel after a
2-cent rise on Tuesday.
   Contracts for delivery through the summer months also fell,
while later contracts posted small advances.
   Regular unleaded gasoline for April delivery rose 0.22 cent to
57.45 cents a gallon and May gained 0.44 cent to 64.56 cents.
Contracts for delivery after June were mixed.
   No. 2 heating oil for delivery in April advanced 0.40 cents to
finish at 55.73 cents a gallon, while later contracts posted losses.
   The latest statistics from API, the trade association
representing major oil companies, showed gasoline stocks fell 5.8
million barrels in the week ended March 23 to 235.4 million
barrels. Distillate fuel supplies dropped 2.2 million barrels to
103.6 million while crude oil inventories rose 7.5 million barrels
to 358.6 million.
   Jim Steel, energy analyst for Refco Inc., said seasonal factors
and the slowdown in refinery operations for annual maintenance in
recent weeks were largely responsible for the buildup in crude
supplies and the drop in refined products.
   During yearly maintenance, demand for crude oil by big oil
companies declines while at the same time refineries make less
gasoline, oil and other products.

<HEAD>Sony Making Laser Discs in U.S., Giving Market a Boost</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sluggish laser video disc market got a shot
in the arm Wednesday with the announcement that a Sony Corp.
division has begun making the movie discs in the United States.
   The new source of discs could ease a bottleneck that has slowed
the growth of the technology, which provides higher-quality
pictures and sound than videotaped movies. The discs are based on
the same distortion-free digital technique as music compact discs.
   Digital Audio Disc Corp., an Indiana-based subsidiary of the
Japanese electronics giant, said it had begun making the discs at a
plant in Terre Haute.
   The major maker in the United States of video discs is Pioneer
Electronic Corp. of Japan. Other makers include 3M Co. and a joint
venture of NV Philips and DuPont Co.
   Laser discs require a separate player that is hooked up to a
television. Several companies sell combination compact disc-laser
disc players.
   But market growth for laser discs and their players has been
constrained by lack of adequate disc supply, said Martin Greenwald,
president of Image Entertainment Inc. of Chatsworth, Calif., a
laser disc distributor.
   Image Entertainment, which licenses the laser disc rights to
movies from major studios, has signed a multiyear contract to have
Digital Audio Disc Corp. make its discs, Greenwald said. Terms were
not disclosed.
   Image Entertainment also buys discs from other manufacturers,
including Pioneer, Greenwald said. But these companies cannot keep
up demand, and Image currently has a backlog of about 1 million
discs on order.
   Greenwald said his company and the Pioneer disc division share
about 90 percent of the market for distributing laser discs in the
United States.
   Greenwald said the move by the Sony division into laser disc
manufacturing ``is major stepping stone in the growth of laser.''
   Most laser discs are bought by individuals for home use. The
disc rental market is small _ about 10 percent of total discs sold
_ and is not expected to grow substantially for several years until
the number of laser disc players in homes increases greatly, said
Greenwald and James M. Frische, president of Digital Audio Disc
Corp.
   Currently, there are about 500,000 laser disc players in U.S.
homes, Greenwald said.
   Industry projections show laser disc players should be in 5
percent to 10 percent of U.S. households by 1995, compared with a
VCR penetration rate of about 85 percent by then, Greenwald said.
But even at this smaller number, the market for the discs
themselves should hit $1 billion a year by then, he said.
   With an increase in disc manufacturing, the cost of the discs
should drop, Greenwald said. Currently, they retail for $25 to $40.
   Digital Audio Disc is the largest maker of compact discs in this
country. Despite the immense growth and popularlity of CDs, Frische
said he doesn't project the same boom for laser discs anytime soon.
That's partly because they lack the ability to record TV programs
and so are not a direct replacement for VCRs.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Soar On Ivory Coast Unrest, Brazilian Logjam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices rocketed to seven-month highs Wednesday
amid fears that political and economic crises could disrupt exports
from the Ivory Coast and Brazil, the world's two largest cocoa
producers.
   Uncertainty about Brazil's changing economic policies also
underpinned gains in futures prices of sugar and coffee.
   On other commodity markets Wednesday, soybean futures tumbled;
copper futures surged; precious metals were mixed; petroleum
futures were mixed; and livestock and meat futures advanced.
   Cocoa futures settled $39 to $47 higher on New York's Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange with the contract for delivery in May at
$1,164 per ton, the highest settlement price of a near-month cocoa
contract since Aug. 18.
   ``It was an explosive move, one of the biggest moves I've seen
in a long, long time,'' said analyst Arthur Stevenson of
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Civil unrest in the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa
producer, has kept the market on edge for the past six weeks
following the implementation of austerity measures aimed at saving
the once-prosperous West African nation from bankruptcy.
   Many of the Ivory Coast's problems stem from last year's
collapse of cocoa and coffee prices to their lowest levels in more
than a decade.
   Fears of supply disruptions flared again Tuesday on reports of
clashes between police and protesters whose illegal demonstrations
paralyzed the capital city of Abidjan.
   The market was further supported by rumors that the Brazilian
government had suspended all commodity exports while it untangles
the snarls of red tape created by economic reforms announced nearly
two weeks ago.
   After the markets closed, the Brazilian government announced
that coffee and sugar exports were in effect suspended temporarily
due to the abolition of two government agencies that had been
responsible for authorizing coffee and sugar shipments.
   The government said cocoa exports were not affected by the
cost-cutting measures but that cocoa shipments had been moving
unusually slowly because of seasonal factors.
   In addition to the Brazilian situation, sugar futures were
supported by expectations that the United States will replace its
sugar import quota system with a tariff system that could result in
higher U.S. imports of the sweetener, analysts said.
   Sugar futures settled .20 cent to .26 cent higher with May at
15.59 cents a pound; coffee futures rose .49 cent to .83 cent with
May settling at 90.80 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures fell sharply on the Chicago Board of Trade amid
heavy selling fueled by reports of ideal harvesting weather for the
South American soybean crop and forecasts for beneficial rain in
the Midwest and northern Great Plains, the main regions for U.S.
soybean, corn and spring wheat production.
   Wheat futures settled 3 cents to 5 cents lower with May at $3.50
a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3{ cents lower with May at $2.59\ a
bushel; oats were 2\ cents to 3 cents lower with May at $1.45\ a
bushel; soybeans were 9 cents to 11} cents lower with May at $5.88}
a bushel.
   Copper futures prices soared on New York's Commodity Exchange,
partly reflecting a resumption of Japanese buying in the physical
market.
   Copper settled 1.9 cents to 4.25 cents higher with April at
$1.205 a pound. The March contract expired quietly at $1.225.
   Gold futures finished nearly unchanged on the Comex amid
continuing nervousness after Monday's price collapse. Prices of
other precious metals continued to slide.
   Gold ended 10 cents lower to 60 cents higher with April at
$369.10 a troy ounce; silver was 3.7 cents to 4.7 cents lower with
March at $4.917 a troy ounce; platinum settled $3 to $3.70 lower on
the New York Mercantile Exchange with April at $474.80 a troy ounce.
   In petroleum trading on the New York Merc, West Texas
Intermediate crude oil settled 40 cents lower to 12 cents higher
with May at $20.08 a barrel; heating oil was .50 cent lower to .40
cent higher with April at 55.73 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .14 cent lower to .44 cent higher with April at 57.45 cents a
gallon.
   Strong cash markets and bullish chart signals helped boost
livestock and meat futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle settled .17 cent to .70 cent higher with April at
77.72 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .35 cent
higher with March at 82.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .07 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with April at 52.95 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .35 cent to 1.40 cent higher with May at 53.95
cents a pound.

   A major figure in the Pentagon
procurement scandal of the 1980s pleaded guilty Wednesday to
bribing a former assistant Navy secretary to help an Israeli
company obtain a contract.
   The guilty plea by defense consultant William M. Galvin, 59, to
charges he bribed then-assistant Navy secretary Melvyn R. Paisley
was a significant development in the ``Operation Ill Wind''
procurement fraud investigation that has netted 35 convictions.
   In addition, Galvin admitted participating in a scheme to bribe
deputy assistant Air Force secretary Victor D. Cohen to help
another defense firm obtain a radar-detection contract.
   Paisley, who left the Pentagon in April 1987 to go into business
with Galvin, has not been charged.
   But Galvin's guilty plea signals that prosecutors are moving
closer to charging Paisley, who has already been implicated in a
separate bribery scheme.
   ``It's a major development in the case and we are rapidly moving
against a number of the people named in the papers,'' said
Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Aronica.
   Galvin, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy, bribery and tax
evasion, could be sentenced up to 40 years in prison and fined up
to $1 million. U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton scheduled
sentencing for Aug. 3.
   Galvin agreed to repay $648,548 in back taxes and interest owed
on money he did not report to the Internal Revenue Service.
   A year before Paisley resigned as assistant Navy secretary for
research, engineering and systems, he agreed to help an Israeli
company get a contract to sell ground equipment to operate
remote-controlled aircraft, court papers said.
   Israel is a major manufacturer of the pilotless intelligence
planes that carry cameras and other equipment to monitor enemy
troop movements.
   The president of Mazlat, Ltd., the Israeli company, deposited
$50,000 in a Swiss bank account set up by Galvin six days after
Paisley signed a 1986 directive ordering the Navy to buy the
ground-control equipment from Mazlat instead of another company.
   Galvin, Paisley, Mazlat president Zvi Schiller and Israeli
defense consultant Uri Simhoni agreed to share equally the $2
million that Mazlat was to place in the Swiss account. The figure
represented 2 percent of the value of the contact, court papers
said.
   Mazlat deposited $268,000, according to the documents.
   Schiller is a retired Israeli army general and once served in
his country's military mission to Washington. Simhoni, a retired
Army major general, was once Israeli military attache in
Washington, said Ruth Yaron, spokeswoman for the Israeli Embassy.
   Former Unisys Corp. executive Charles F. Gardner was sentenced
last year to 32 months in prison for bribery for arranging the
purchase of Paisley's resort condominium in Idaho for an inflated
price.
   Paisley's attorney, E. Lawrence Barcella, said his client
``still maintains his innocence.''
   Galvin also pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme with
Loral Electronics Corp. executive Louis Oberndorf to bribe Cohen to
help the Yonkers, N.Y.-based company obtain a contract to sell the
Pentagon radar-warning devices.
   He admitted paying $123,100 in monthly payments between 1983 and
1987 to a friend of Cohen's, Kyle H. Woodbury, for consulting work.
But Galvin understood some of the money would be used for Cohen's
benefit, the court papers said.
   Galvin helped Cohen open a Swiss bank account in 1986, which
Cohen concealed from the Internal Revenue Service and the Air
Force, the court filings said.
   Neither Cohen, Woodbury nor Oberndorf has been charged.
   Loral pleaded guilty in December to charges that a subsidiary
tried to influence Cohen improperly, paying $5.77 million in fines
and civil penalties.
   Cohen's lawyer, Julian Greenspun, said prosecutors had no
evidence that his client had participated in a bribery scheme with
Galvin.
   ``I don't think the government can show that Kyle Woodbury ever
improperly gave Vic Cohen a dime,'' said Greenspun. Greenspun said
the only money Woodbury paid Cohen was to rent a house from his
friend.

   Consumers feel more optimistic about future
business prospects than they did last month, but less positive
about current business conditions, according to a survey released
Wednesday.
   The Conference Board's monthly survey showed the most
significant improvement in consumer confidence in five months. The
business research group said its consumer confidence index for
March is 110.2, a gain of 3.5 points from February.
   The monthly survey conducted by National Family Opinion Inc.
covers 5,000 households in the United States.
   About 20 percent of respondents feel that current business
conditions are ``bad,'' the survey found. That's an increase of 2
percent from last month.
   However, looking ahead six months, people were significantly
more optimistic about job prospects and business conditions than
they were in the first two months of the year.
   ``The substantial increase in the number of new jobs in recent
months has contributed to the increasing sense of job security,''
said Fabian Linden, executive director of the board's Consumer
Research Center. ``This development has also apparently made
consumers feel more comfortable with the general business outlook.''
   More people said they intend to buy a car, although fewer
reported they planned to buy a home.
   ``This is most likely a reflection of the recent rise in
mortgage rates,'' the survey concluded.
   Interest in buying major appliances also declined.
   The Conference Board is a New York-based business group.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T Details Plans To Streamline Network; 6,000 To Lose Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BASKING RIDGE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.
will eliminate scores of customer-support centers nationwide as
part of a previously announced streamlining that will cut 6,000
jobs, company officials said Wednesday.
   The Communication Workers of America, which had been working
with AT&amp;T to eliminate jobs through early retirement rather than
layoffs, criticized the plan and said employees were being treated
unfairly.
   AT&amp;T officials, however, said they had delayed announcing
details of the streamlining as long as they could while
negotiations continued. When talks with the union broke off
Tuesday, the company decided to announce the changes, said AT&amp;T
spokeswoman Daisy Ottmann.
   ``These are jobs that are being eliminated because the work is
no longer there,'' Ms. Ottmann said from the company's operations
headquarters here.
   Under the plan, the number of centers will be reduced from about
160 in 60 metropolitan areas nationwide to about 100 centers in 30
areas, beginning as early as May, the company said.
   AT&amp;T will reduce the number of centers providing direct support
for business services from 57 to 28. Employees at the new customer
service centers will provide specialized support according to
customer and type of service rather than geographic area.
   In other changes, management of the AT&amp;T long-distance network
now handled regionally by 38 centers will be consolidated into six
centers at two national locations in Denver and Conyers, Ga., a
suburb of Atlanta.
   The changes are part of an $18 billion program begun in 1984 to
modernize AT&amp;T's network. The company said the changes are designed
to improve customer service while reducing network operating costs.
It was announced last fall that the streamlining effort would
reduce about 6,000 jobs, but details of the plan were announced for
the first time Tuesday.
   As AT&amp;T increases the installation of new digital technology,
there is less need for all its employees, said AT&amp;T spokesman Burke
Stinson.
   Until Tuesday, AT&amp;T and the union were negotiating the number of
employees that would have their pensions sweetened to entice them
to retire early.
   CWA spokesman Steve Rosenthal said that the front-line employees
were not being offered as attractive a package as managers were
last year, when a special retirement plan prompted 12,500 to depart.
   Stinson said the company plans to reduce its work force by up to
12,000 employees this year. He said he did not know how many would
be laid off because efforts to entice people to retire early were
continuing, although no new talks with the union were scheduled.

<TEXT>
   Blue Arrow PLC shareholders on Wednesday
overwhelmingly approved changing the company's name to Manpower
PLC, initiating a plan that will reincorporate the temporary
employment giant in the United States.
   Blue Arrow Chief Executive Mitchell Fromstein said in a
statement that 99 percent of the votes cast by shareholders were in
favor of changing the name.
   ``There was a strong demonstration of support for the directions
of the company,'' Fromstein said.
   The name change is part of the final chapter of an unsual
takeover battle that began in 1987 when the British congolmerate
bought the much larger Manpower, based in Milwaukee, in a $1.3
billion hostile takeover.
   Fromstein was president of Manpower and was retained in that
position after the takeover. He sat on Blue Arrow's board of
directors for about a year until he was fired because of what he
termed ``a conflict in management philosophies'' with Antony Berry,
then Blue Arrow's chief executive.
   But Blue Arrow's directors reviewed the dispute between
Fromstein and Berry, fired Berry and named Fromstein as chief
executive a month later.
   During the takeover, most U.S. investors in Manpower sold out to
Blue Arrow. But since Fromstein took over Blue Arrow, U.S.
investments in the British parent have risen to 75 percent of
outstanding shares.
   In the next stage of Fromstein's plan, Blue Arrow is expected to
reincorporate in the United States as Manpower Inc., divest itself
of most of its remaining outside holdings and focus on Manpower's
services, which comprise 80 percent of the British conglomerate's
current operations.
   ``Ultimately it's anticipated that we will sell all of the
non-Manpower operations so that effectively, it winds up being back
what it was, back where it was, run by who it was _ two years
later,'' Fromstein said last week.
   Manpower, which provides trained temporary employees to
companies, employs about 1 million people a year. It operates 1,450
offices and has 300,000 customers worldwide.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's largest
cable television system operator, reported Wednesday it lost $257
million last year, citing expenses linked to the financing of
acquisitions.
   The net loss for the year that ended Dec. 31 was equal to 73
cents per share, compared with net earnings of $56 million, or 15
cents per share, in 1988, the company said in a news release.
   ``The decrease of $313 million was primarily due to decreased
gain on sales of assets, increased interest expense incurred to
finance certain acquisitions, the increase in depreciation and
amortization resulting from those acquisitions, and TCI's increased
pro rata share of losses of affiliates,'' TCI said in a news
release.
   For the year, TCI said its revenue rose to $3 billion from $2.2
billion in 1988. Operating income was $569 million in 1989, up from
$491 million in 1988.
   The increases were the result of a broadening of the subscriber
base and theatre operations as well as the consolidation of United
Cable Television Corp., which began last May, the company said. The
TCI report also incorporated the full 12-month results of WestMarc
Communications Inc., which it acquired a majority interest in last
May.
   TCI and consolidated subsidiaries served about 7.8 million basic
subscribers and 5.8 million pay television subscribers at year-end
1989. It also operated 2,659 theatre screens through United Artists
Entertainment.

<HEAD>Four Indicted in LA Penny Stock Scam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury in Los Angeles has
indicted four men on numerous fraud charges in an alleged penny
stock manipulation scheme involving the securities of Magna
Technologies Inc., officials said Wednesday.
   The 42-count indictment, handed up March 7 and unsealed
Wednesday, charged Jacob Rubenstein, Dr. Robert Gutstein, Robert
Victor and Herbert Stone with numerous counts of securities, wire
and bank fraud as well as a single conspiracy count.
   In addition, Rubenstein, a promoter of Magna stock, was charged
with failure to file a tax return and Victor, a Los Angeles-area
businessman, faces a single tax fraud count.
   The indictment, announced jointly by the Securities and Exchange
Commission in Washington and Robert L. Brosio, U.S. attorney for
the Central District of California, accused the four of a scheme
plotting to manipulate the stock price of Magna, ``which was, in
essence, a shell corporation'' located in Thousand Oaks, Calif.
   Gutstein was described in court papers as Magna's chairman and a
large shareholder. Stone was a securities trader with Norbay
Securities Inc. in New York, the primary market maker in Magna
stock.
   Low-cost, high-risk penny stocks, which trade for less than $5 a
share, are usually not listed on stock exchanges or the National
Association of Securities Dealers' automated stock price-quote
system. Investors often must rely on the few traders who handle the
company's stock to quote the latest buy or sell price _ making the
stocks prone to fraud and manipulation.
   The indictment stems from an earlier civil action brought by the
SEC against Rubenstein, Gutstein, Stone and four others, most of
whom settled with the SEC.
   SEC documents in Washington provided no other details.
   In another matter, the SEC announced Wednesday that a federal
judge in Chicago ordered William A. Rooney Sr. to pay $28 million
in alleged illegal profits from a pyramid, or Ponzi, scheme.
   In a Ponzi scheme, named for a notorious scam artist in the
early part of this century, new investors are constantly recruited
so that their money can be used to pay off earlier clients, in a
pyramiding scheme that usually collapses as the money owed
investors grows beyond the company's abilities to recruit new funds.
   Rooney was accused in an SEC complaint Jan. 2 of diverting the
profits over a 17-year period from the sale of nine-month
promissory notes for three companies he controlled.
   Last Thursday, U.S. District Judge John A. Nordberg granted an
SEC request for default judgement against Rooney, including
disgorgement of $12 million in alleged illegal profits and $16
million in interest.
   SEC documents in Washington provided no other details.

<TEXT>
   Theatre giant Cineplex Odeon Corp. said Wednesday
it posted a $78.6 million loss for 1989 amid a restructuring that
began before the departure of chairman Garth Drabinsky in December.
   The theatre chain also said it has agreed to sell major
interests in two related businesses for a total of $55 million, and
reached agreements in principle with major bank creditors that will
restrict its ability to make new investments.
   The company said it expects 1990 ``will be a difficult year from
the point of view of profitability. This is consistent with the
restructuring necessary to return the corporation to profitability
and positive cash flows.''
   Cineplex Odeon said its loss came on revenue of $644 million. In
1988, the company earned $40.9 million on nearly identical revenues.
   The 1989 loss came despite a sale of assets that resulted in a
one-time gain of about $70 million.
   Last year, Cineplex sold its Live Theatre division to Drabinsky
and his associate, Myron Gottlieb, after a lengthy battle for
control of the parent company. It also sold a 50 percent interest
in Universal Studios Florida.
   Cineplex said it has agreed to sell to British-based Rank
Organization its remaining 51 per cent interest in Film House for
$40 million and its residual interest in Universal Studios Florida
for $15 million.
   Cineplex is one of the largest theatre chains in North America,
with about 1,920 screens in 500 locations.

<TEXT>
   Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan Association, whose
failure is expected to be the costliest in thrift history, said it
lost $127.5 million in the fourth quarter, bringing its loss for
1989 to $1 billion.
   The S&amp;L was seized last April by federal regulators. They have
estimated it will cost taxpayers $2.5 billion to bail out the
institution.
   Lincoln said its assets at year-end were $2.9 billion, down from
$5.3 billion in 1988.
   Before it was seized, Lincoln was owned by American Continental
Corp. of Phoenix, a firm controlled by land developer Charles
Keating Jr.
   Keating has sued the government to get the thrift back, claiming
the takeover was arbitrary and capricious. A hearing on the suit is
continuing in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.
   Regulators have contented that Lincoln used complicated real
estate, stock and junk bond transactions to book phony profits to
bolster Keating's faltering real estate empire, which included
heavy investments in Arizona.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Centaur Partners said Wednesday it won't make
a bid for National Intergroup Inc. and is only trying to protect
its investment in the company by seeking seats on the board.
   ``The real issue here is corporate governance: majority rules,''
said Centaur, the largest shareholder in Pittsburgh-based National
Intergroup with a 16.5 percent stake.
   New York-based Centaur wrote to National Intergroup Chairman
Howard Love to respond to the company's letter to shareholders on
Tuesday, which challenged Centaur to ``stop talking and make a firm
cash offer.''
   Love and NII President James Pasman also told shareholders the
company would sell off its metals investments, including a 50
percent share in National Steel Corp., and concentrate on wholesale
distribution, primarily of pharmaceuticals.
   In its letter, Centaur said National Intergroup's restructuring
program is ``vague'' and does not say how it will deliver value to
shareholders.
   Centaur is seeking to gain seats on National Intergroup's board,
restructure the company and sell off assets. It has claimed it
could receive $29.34 a share by breaking up National Intergroup.
   Love called that figure ``pure fantasy'' in his letter and
advised shareholders to keep the existing board.
   Centaur said its figure of $29.34 a share is based on an
independent analysis conducted by Paine-Webber Inc. and is $3 less
than National Intergroup's book value.
   ``If you believe that our valuation range is overstated, then
you have either overpaid for businesses (as many have asserted), or
have run them down without reflecting this deterioration,''
Centaur's letter said.
   National Intergroup stock closed at $16.87{ Tuesday, down 37{
cents on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Centaur also criticized National Intergroup management and said
the company has lost $450 million in six years.
   ``We believe it would be irresponsibe to continue to trust your
leadership and your promises,'' the partnership said.

   The World Bank which has been lending as much
as $2 billion annually to China plans to restrict the aid to basic
human needs assistance, a high Treasury official told Congress on
Wednesday.
   ``We do not see at this stage a major resumption of non-BHN
(basic human needs) lending in the immediate plans of the bank
management,'' said Charles H. Dallara, assistant secretary of the
Treasury for international affairs.
   Dallara said the Treasury had resisted pressure during the
bank's recent closed-door meetings to increase lending.
   ``We've made very clear that in our sense a lending program
should be one that is modest, moderately paced and limited in the
foreseeable future strictly to basic human needs,'' he added, in
testimony before the House Banking subcommittee on international
development.
   Meanwhile, another U.S. economic expert argued that continued
commercial ties with China can help stimulate reforms.
   ``The administration has searched for a balance between an
adequate expression of moral disapproval and actions that reflect
long-term U.S. interests,'' said John Macomber, chairman of the
U.S. Export-Import Bank.
   Macomber said that his bank had financed three projects in China
this year worth $72.8 million.
   In recent weeks the World Bank's 152 member governments have
approved three loans worth $140 million to China for earthquake
relief, aid to poor farmers and vocational education.
   The World Bank is the biggest source of aid to Third World
countries and the United States makes the largest contribution, but
does not have a veto over loans.
   Barber B. Conable, the bank's president, suspended consideration
of $780 million worth of loans when Chinese tanks went into
Tienanmen Square last June. However, he did not stop disbursement
of loans already granted.
   Conable has said he wants $1 billion worth of new loans to China
to go forward by June.
   But Dallara said that would cause concern among U.S. officials
because the only way so large an amount could be loaned would be by
going beyond basic human needs.
   Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy, D-DC, chairman of the subcommittee,
warned that a proposed U.S. contribution of $3.18 billion might be
in trouble with Congress if the bank resumed large scale lending to
China.
   The contribution would go to the bank's International
Development Association, which makes 40-year loans at a less than 1
percent annual interest rate to countries where the average
citizen's income is no more $580 a year. China is one of them.
   For the three years beginning July 1 IDA is seeking about $15
billion.

<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pathe Communications Corp., which
has agreed to buy MGM-UA Communications Co. for $1.29 billion, said
its profits fell 12 percent in the fourth quarter and reported a
$32 million loss for the full year.
   Pathe, which produces and distributes entertainment worldwide
and operates movie theaters in Europe, also said Wednesday its
$20-a-share tender offer for MGM-UA is expected to be completed in
April.
   The company already has made a $50 million deposit and has
signed a distribution deal worth $75 million to MGM-UA, but has yet
to announce how it intends to finance the buyout.
   ``Combining these two companies into a truly global organization
will produce both substantial entertainment and meaningful
financial results in the future,'' said Giancarlo Parretti, the
Italian financier who is Pathe's president and chief executive.
``The future looks extremely promising.''
   For the October-December quarter, Pathe earned $22 million, or
37 cents a share, compared with $25 million, or $2.12 a share, in
the same period in 1988. Revenue fell 29 percent to $79 million
from $111 million.
   Earnings per share declined more sharply than overall net
because Pathe had an average of about 60 million shares outstanding
in the fourth quarter, compared with 11 million a year earlier.
   For the year, Pathe's $32 million loss, the equivalent of $1.13
a share, compared with a profit of $21 million, or $1.57 a share,
in 1988.
   Revenues fell 6 percent to $350 million from $371 million.
Revenues from cinema operation rose 10 percent to $167 million, but
movie distributing income fell 17 percent to $185 million, Pathe
said.
   Yearly profits were depressed by $47 million in charges taken
because of a lowered estimate of future revenues from the company's
old film library and $14 million for films over 5 years old that
were fully amortized in 1989, it said.

   A House committee moved Wednesday to more than
double President Bush's request for aid to emerging democracies in
Eastern Europe to soften the shocks of changing from communism to a
market economy.
   ``It would be a very serious mistake for us to conclude the
survival of democracy in Eastern Europe is a done deal,'' said Rep.
Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who offered an amendment in the Foreign
Affairs Committee boosting potential aid to the region to $719
million in the year that begins Oct. 1.
   The adopted the aid boost on a voice vote, adding it to an
omnibus foreign affairs bill.
   At the same time, the House speeded progress of legislation Bush
has sought to aid new democracies in Central America. The chamber
was to consider a $2.4 billion money bill, which includes $420
million for Panama and $300 million for Nicaragua, on Thursday.
   The administration has agreed to pay for the Panama and
Nicaragua aid by cutting a list of Pentagon projects and accounts
totaling $1.8 billion.
   The new amount for Eastern Europe compares with $300 million the
White House has sought for next year. The administration argues
that the smaller amount would be as much as countries like Poland
and Hungary, which have progressed far enough in their reforms to
be eligible for U.S. help, can absorb immediately.
   Solarz, however, said his package of environmental cleanup aid,
housing grants and loan guarantees, and private sector development
assistance is needed to soften the ``cold turkey'' switch from
centrally planned economies to market systems.
   East European countries will suffer severe shocks as they close
down inefficient government-owned enterprises, throwing people out
of work, and switch to private employment, he said.
   ``It could create a socially and politically explosive
situation,'' he told the committee. ``We need to do more than we've
done so far.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., agreed. ``We have a unique
opportunity to achieve goals we've sought for 40 or 50 years,'' he
said. ``The stakes are enormous. The risk is that we won't be bold
enough in meeting the challenge.''
   Hamilton acknowledged there is a shortage of money for new
programs, particularly in the area of foreign aid. But he added:
``The American people have been fired by the changes in Eastern
Europe, and want to see freedom triumph ... We've simply got to
find the resources to play the role of a world leader.''
   Solarz's amendment was added to a catch-all foreign aid bill
that includes implementing provisions needed to permit emergency
short-term aid to new democratic governments in Panama and
Nicaragua, as well as authorization for an additional $200 million
to Nicaragua next year.
   The sums mentioned are spending ceilings. Congress must still
appropriate the money, and may appropriate any amount up to the
ceiling.
   It was approved on a voice vote after Republicans sarcastically
feigned an effort to double Solarz's aid figure. ``We must act
boldly and with great fanfare,'' intoned Rep. William Broomfield,
R-Mich., before withdrawing his amendment.
   Republicans believe Democrats are using Eastern Europe as a
political weapon, portraying Bush as weak by continually increasing
aid beyond amounts the White House asks. A similar scenario last
year led to a quadrupling of Bush's request.
   The fate of the bill remained unclear. The House committee
planned to hold it over until next week pending the outcome of
planned talks between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
lawmakers concerned about human rights issues in El Salvador.
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, meanwhile, adopted a
pared-down version Wednesday that largely tracked the
administration's Panama-Nicaragua request and added no provisions
on unrelated matters such as Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply against the yen Thursday
morning, triggering a modest rebound in share prices on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange and a decline in bond yields.
   The dollar closed the morning session at 157.45 yen, down 1.18
yen from Wednesday's close. The dollar opened at 158.30 yen and
ranged widely between 156.95 yen and 158.30 yen during the morning.
   Following the yen's rebound, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
regained 105.53 points, or 0.34 percent, ending the morning session
at 31,369.10. The index shed 562.39 points Wednesday.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bond rose
to 86.48 points late in the morning from Wednesday's close at
86.14. The dropped the yield to 7.25 percent from 7.32 percent.
   The Nikkei index fell in early trading because of large-scale,
index-linked selling, but it soon bounced back in reaction to the
yen's rise against the dollar, said Tomoyuki Morimoto, a dealer
with New Japan Securities Co.
   ``Recovery in bond prices also encouraged market players and
prompted their buying,'' he said. ``But the market's purchasing
power is still limited because of a lingering pessimism among
participants.''
   The dollar's decline was a continuation of a weaker trend that
began in New York overnight. There, the dollar temporarily rose
above 159 yen but turned downward and ended at 158.59 yen following
intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
   Fuji Bank dealer Kenzo Shinomiya said the dollar's weakness
reflected selling by market players who sought to take profits
after buying the dollar during its strong rise in recent weeks.
   ``But the dollar's recent uptrend is not over yet. Today's fall
is only a temporary break in a continuing trend,'' he said.
   Traders said intervention by the Bank of Japan helped push the
dollar down. The central bank was seen selling several million
dollars Thursday in an attempt to support the yen.
   Meanwhile, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said he hopes
exchange rates will come to reflect real economic conditions, Kyodo
News Service reported.
   Kyodo also quoted Hashimoto as saying he intends to urge
cooperation among the Group of Seven nations on currency stability
at their meeting scheduled for April 7 in Paris.
