<HEAD>Nuclear Ship's Reactor Started After 16 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The reactor on Japan's only nuclear ship has been
started for the first time since it was shut down 16 years ago due
to a radiation leak.
   No leakage of radiation was recorded during Thursday's 12-hour
test aboard the 8,242-ton Mutsu, anchored at Sekinehama in northern
Japan, officials of the government's Atomic Energy Reserach
Institute said.
   The freighter developed a leak in its radioactive shield on its
maiden voyage in 1974, and drifted for 50 days before city
residents allowed it to return temporarily. Several other cities
refused to berth the stricken vessel.
   In 1981, government officials agreed to build a new port for the
ship at Sekinehama, an isolated spot on the Pacific Ocean near its
former home port, Mutsu City.
   The ship's reactor was extensively remodeled after the leak.
   The officials said the tests of the reactor would continue, and
if successful, the Mutsu will conduct several test cruises to
collect data for possible future development of nuclear-powered
commercial vessels. It then will be scrapped, they said.

<HEAD>Depiction of Nude Purdue President Removed from Display</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A graduate student whose 8-foot
canvas of the Purdue University president clad only in socks was
removed from an exhibit says he was simply trying to be provocative.
   Artist David Loewenstein, 23, said Thursday that his painting of
President Steven C. Beering was tame and designed to spark
discussion about the right to display controversial art.
   ``There's a lot more art that is done that is more explicit,''
Loewenstein said.
   Beering did not pose for the painting, nor has he made a public
statement about it.
   ``I wanted to do something provocative and see how people would
align themselves, while at the same time doing something risky, fun
and mischievous,'' he said. ``It doesn't happen enough at Purdue.''
   Gary Sudano, director of Purdue's department of creative arts,
removed the painting from a campus art gallery after Loewenstein
refused to withdraw it.
   ``We have exhibition space in our buildings which is reserved
for the display of works of art that arise from the instructional
program,'' Sudano said Thursday. ``We don't provide a forum for
public displays of personal points of view. That's not our
mission.''
   Sudano said Loewenstein has other paintings on display in the
three campus galleries, but all were from classes the student had
taken.

   A self-described beach bum en route
back to Pennsylvania won a one-year free pass on a Florida commuter
rail line because he was its millionth passenger.
   ``This pass will do me a lot of good in Pennsylvania,'' said
Scott Wilson of Reading, Pa., upon receiving the $720 ticket for
the Tri-Rail commuter line.
   He planned on giving the ticket to a friend.
   Wilson, who was riding the line for the first time, was going to
Miami International Airport on Wednesday when passengers on a train
car decked with balloons were told to yell ``Surprise!'' to the
fifth passenger who boarded.
   ``This is too wild. I've never won anything before,'' Wilson
said.
   In Fort Lauderdale since September, the 24-year-old Wilson said
he worked as a shipping manager for a few months, but for the past
few weeks was a ``beach bum at spring break.''
   ``I can't believe I missed it by just one,'' groaned Edward
Barturen, the 999,999th passenger, who commutes daily on a 25-mile
trip from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to Miami.
   The rail service opened in January 1989. A one-way trip costs $2.

   Both Demoratic and Republican Party
veterans think it's crazy, but a couple running for the same House
seat believe it increases their chances of winning.
   ``It's not important to us who wins,'' said Johnnie Luteran, who
filed as a Democrat for the party primary Aug. 7. ``We are giving
the people an opportunity to elect someone with drive and
determination.''
   His wife, Barbara Luteran, is a Republican candidate for the
same 48th Distict seat. The GOP primary also is Aug. 7.
   ``That may take the cake,'' said Mike Wells, Democratic chairman
of Jackson County.
   ``That's crazy,'' said Tony Feather, executive director of the
Missouri Republican Party. ``That's the strangest thing I've ever
heard of.''
   Local politicians and party insiders cannot recall any couple
ever running for the same job.
   Both Luterans face primary opponents. Republican incumbent Rep.
Pat Kelley is seeking re-election, and Dixie L. Courtney is seeking
the Democratic nod.
   ``It seems a little odd to me,'' Kelley said. ``I guess at this
point I do not know what to say.''

<TEXT>
   The powerful, $1.5 billion Hubble
Space Telescope is safe inside the shuttle Discovery, free from
certain bugs but not others.
   Technicians installed the telescope Thursday after ridding a
payload preparation room at the launch pad of 40 small mosquitolike
insects called midges. Engineers feared the midges might damage the
fragile instrument and its 8-foot primary optical mirror.
   About the time the last insect was snared, bugs of a more
technical nature were discovered.
   A spark igniter on one of Discovery's three main engines did not
receive continuous power and was replaced. And an electronics
package on another engine needed to be replaced because of an
internal circuitry problem.
   The problems were considered minor, and NASA today planned to
test the electrical connections between the Hubble and Discovery. A
final check will be made of the telescope's systems and its
scientific instruments on Sunday.
   The 25,000-pound telescope will tested to ensure it is in remote
communications with NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md., and Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. in Sunnyvale,
Calif.
   Discovery's payload bay doors will remain open until two days
before the scheduled April 12 launch so the telescope's batteries
can be charged. NASA has said the mission may be moved up a day or
two because flight preparations are running ahead of schedule.
   The two-day delay in installing the Hubble had no effect on the
launch schedule, said George Diller, a spokesman for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   The telescope was transferred into the orbiter late Thursday
afternoon in an operation that took five hours.
   ``Once the bugs were behind us ... it really went about as
smoothly as it could have gone. That's the only thing that's been a
surprise in any of this so far,'' Diller said.
   Discovery's five astronauts are to deploy the Hubble on the
second day of the five-day mission. Once in orbit 370 miles above
Earth, the telescope will be capable of looking seven times more
deeply into space and detecting objects 50 times fainter than the
best ground-based observatory.
   The telescope is named for the late U.S. astronomer Edwin P.
Hubble, who discovered during the 1920s that the universe
constantly is expanding. His finding led to the big-bang theory
that the universe was created about 15 billion years ago by a
terrific explosion.
   The Hubble will enable astronomers to study stars and galaxies
so distant that their light has been traveling toward Earth for 14
billion years.

<HEAD>Americans Eager to Wave the Flag for Lithuania</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush may be reluctant to recognize
Lithuania's new government, but customers at a colorful stand in
Union Station's Main Hall are eager to wave the flag.
   They're so eager that there's been a run on Lithuanian flags,
patches, key chains and lapel pins at Alamo Flags, where manager
Dante Payne's order book amounts to a weathervane of world events.
   ``People will come by and say, `I heard about it on the news.
Give me one.' They think freedom is great,'' Payne said.
   In the past week, Payne has sold about 100 of his 4-by-6-inch
flags at $3.99 each, and 25 of the demonstration-size 3-by-5-foot
banners for $35.
   ``I have to order at least twice a week,'' Payne said from his
stand in Washington's elegantly renovated main train station. ``You
can see we've almost sold out of patches. There's just one left.''
   Patches sell for $4. For Lithuania supporters who want to show
the yellow, green and red colors more discreetly, key chains and
lapel pins are priced at $3.99 each.
   Payne said many of his customers are Americans with Lithuanian
roots, others buy in bulk for demonstrations and the rest are
mostly curious passers-by.
   Dan Raber, a 17-year-old high school student from Kingsport,
Tenn., falls into another category: the motivated collector.
   ``I collect flags from different countries,'' he said. ``With
all this going on and Lithuania becoming a brand-new nation, I
thought it would be interesting to get a flag of theirs.''
   While he was at it, Raber picked up little flags from Estonia
and Latvia in case Lithuania's Baltic neighbors follow it down the
tricky path toward independence from the Soviet Union.
   Some other Washington-based flag outlets reported no special
increase in Lithuanian flag sales.
   ``I have had some calls, I wouldn't say dozens by any means,''
said Diane Wolter, a saleswoman for Betsy Ross Flag Girls Inc.
   But she said political currents do affect the flag business.
   ``Since the Berlin Wall came down, there's been a lot of
interest in Eastern Europe,'' she said. ``When we had this
flag-burning thing, that increased business tremendously.''
   The extra sales were to flag supporters, she hastened to add,
not to people wanting to set the stars and stripes ablaze.
   At Union Station, Payne said demand for the Lithuanian flag has
not matched the rush for Czechoslovakian flags last November or for
African National Congress banners when Nelson Mandela was freed in
South Africa in February.
   Alamo Flags boasts that it stocks flags from every country and
all 50 states.
   ``Namibia is the only one we don't have because it just became a
country,'' Payne said. ``But we should have it by the end of the
week.''

<HEAD>Ouster of Homosexual Cadets Draws Fire from Capitol Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One semester away from graduation at MIT and a
commission in the Navy's prestigious Nuclear Propulsion Program,
Cadet Robert Bettiker looked across the desk at his superior
officer and said: ``I'm gay.''
   The officer, R.W. Sherer answered without hesitation.
   ``Well then, we will consider the date of disenrollment,'' he
said.
   That quickly, the military career of a cadet with nearly four
years of government-financed education at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology was finished, a casualty of the Pentagon's
policy of excluding homosexuals.
   Now Bettiker's case, and another like his, have drawn
congressional attention. A Pentagon move to require Bettiker and
Harvard cadet David Carney to pay back their tuition drew a letter
of protest from two dozen House members Thursday.
   ``We believe that to compel these men to repay this money would
not only be fundamentally unfair; it would also reflect an
appalling mean-spiritedness which has no place in the Navy,'' the
lawmakers said in a letter drafted by Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass.,
an acknowledged homosexual.
   The Navy is showing no signs of wavering.
   Both Carney and Bettiker have been asked to sign one-page forms
acknowledging their debt but have refused. For Carney, that
translates into a $50,687 tab. For Bettiker, the bill comes to
$38,612.
   Carney, 23, graduated from Harvard last spring after the Navy
covered all his tuition and some fees. He spent the past year
studying at Oxford University in England.
   Bettiker, 22, is to graduate from MIT this spring. The Navy
stopped paying his tuition after the fall semester.
   Both men say they are balking at repaying the Navy because they
are not trying to avoid their five years of obligatory military
service and want to become commissioned officers.
   ``In my view, the U.S. Navy broke its contract with me, not vice
versa,'' Carney said in an interview.
   Although Bettiker and Carney know one another and had the same
commanding officer, the similar timing of their cases was
coincidental, Bettiker said. Both told their ROTC superior that
they had recently discovered their homosexuality. They said they
had not concealed their circumstances from the ROTC and were not
aware they were gay when they entered the service.
   Last month Studds, in a letter also signed by 23 congressmen,
complained about a similar policy move by the Army ROTC against
James Holobaugh, 24, who attended Washington University in St.
Louis. In the Holobaugh case, a preliminary board recommended he
repay his tuition.
   But in the Carney and Bettiker cases, the lower-level board
called for no repayment. That recommendation was overruled by Navy
Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III, who routinely reviews such cases.
   Navy spokesman Jim Turner declined to comment in detail on the
Carney and Bettiker cases but provided a written explanation of the
Pentagon's policy excluding homosexuals.
   It said the Defense Department views homosexuality as
``incompatible with military service,'' for reasons of morale,
chain of command, discipline and security. It indicated a concern
about homosexual encounters among military personnel who must live
and work close together and about the possibility that homosexual
relationships could lead to breaches in security.
   Bettiker said that when he realized he was gay he inquired about
the military's exclusion of homosexuals but decided to report his
situaion anyway.
   ``I looked at the Navy's policy and was really angry that they
could so arbitrarily decide that I was not fit for service,''
Bettiker said. ``I thought about it and decided that I couldn't lie
to them and couldn't live a lie for four to five years.''
   Sherer, in a telephone interview, described his response to
Bettiker last Nov. 7, when Bettiker reported his homosexuality: ``I
said I would have to disenroll him, that that was a disqualifying
factor for commissioning,'' the Navy officer said.
   Although Sherer recommended that Carney and Bettiker not be
forced to repay their tuition, he called the loss of tuition one
option ``that's standard for anybody who is disenrolled'' under
similar circumstances.
   Neither cadet has retained an attorney, but Lambda Legal Defense
and Education Fund in New York has taken an interest in the issue
of gay men and lesbians in the military and is monitoring the Navy
ROTC case.
   ``I'm very optimistic that they won't have to pay back the
money,'' said Sandy Lowe, a Lambda attorney. ``In none of these
instances is there any finding at all that they defrauded the
services.''

<HEAD>Democrats Tempt Veto With Ambitious Child Care Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats are tempting a presidential
veto by rejecting the White House version of a child-care bill in
favor of their own more costly and ambitious plan.
   The House approved the measure, estimated to cost at least $27
billion over its first five years, just hours after a spokesman for
President Bush issued a fresh veto threat Thursday.
   ``Rather than waving his veto pen, our president should match
his warm words with good deeds and agree to sign our child-care
bill,'' House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said after
the vote.
   The bill still must go to a House-Senate conference to resolve
differences with the Senate. But Democrats hoped the ultimate
version would mirror the House bill and that election-year
pressures would make Bush back down from his threat.
   The House plan would expand tax credits for poor families to
offset the cost of child care and would provide federal money for
local governments to set up new day-care programs in public schools.
   It would create a system of state-issued subsidy vouchers for
parents who want to use religious day-care centers, expand the Head
Start program for poor children, and establish minimum standards
for day-care centers.
   Both parties embraced the cause of day-care assistance during
the last presidential campaign, and Democrats were trying to seize
the political advantage on the popular issue. Less than a week ago,
Democrats reported being close to a bipartisan agreement on the
issue in White House negotiations that ultimately collapsed.
   ``I think President Bush, as he examines the bill, will find a
lot more to be comfortable with than not,'' said a sponsor, Rep.
Thomas Downey, D-N.Y.
   ``I think it will go down as a landmark bill, one of the great
achievements of the Congress and this era in American government,''
said House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
   To offset part of the new child-care costs, the House plan would
take away the income tax credit that more affluent families now
receive for child care. That credit would be reduced for families
earning $70,000 a year and eliminated for those earning more than
$90,000.
   It also would make permanent the 3 percent telephone excise tax
due to expire this year. But both revenue sources would not cover
the full cost.
   The House approved the bill 265-145, after voting more narrowly
to reject the less costly alternative that Bush had endorsed. That
version's five-year cost was put at nearly $20 billion.
   The White House's budget office issued a statement calling the
Democratic version ``an exercise in fiscal irresponsibility.''
   Just hours before the vote, presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater warned that Bush would veto the Democratic version if it
reached his desk.
   The White House alternative was sponsored by Reps. Charles
Stenholm, D-Texas, and Clay Shaw, R-Fla. It was defeated on a
225-195 vote that largely followed party lines.
   Fourteen Democratic governors and one Republican, Gov. John R.
McKernan Jr. of Maine, signed a letter to Foley endorsing the
Democratic version of the child-care bill and opposing the
conservative alternative.
   Republicans attacked the Democratic version because it instructs
states to set minimum standards for day-care centers, including a
requirement that day-care workers receive 15 hours of training a
year.
   The Senate's version, passed last year, would cost about the
same as the version backed by Bush, though it would provide smaller
tax credits. Like the House version, the Senate plan would provide
vouchers for church-run centers, but it would place less emphasis
on school-based programs.
   Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn., sponsor of the Senate version, praised
the House action as signaling ``a national child care policy is
within reach.''
   Though popular in the polls, the issue of child care had been
bogged down in the Congress _ largely due to internal disputes
among Democrats. The House last year approved conflicting
child-care bills without resolving the differences.
   ``If the child-care legislation were an actual child, Congress
would be charged with abuse and neglect,'' said Rep. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine.

   The Soviet Union may follow the lead of
neighboring Poland and begin a ``shock therapy'' plan to push the
economy toward a market system, a senior official says.
   But Vyacheslav Senchagov, chief of the State Price Committee,
also told deputies of the Supreme Soviet legislature that angry
consumers could block such radical economic changes.
   The government favors a moderate approach toward a market system
that includes a transition period, he said Thursday in remarks
carried by the official Tass news agency.
   However, Tass said Senchagov acknowledged choosing the most
radical approach is ``inevitable, if during the transitional period
... the population's confidence in the government does not fall so
low as to make no reforms possible.''
   The most radical of three alternatives being considered is
likely to drastically raise prices for raw materials and consumer
goods, reduce the value of the ruble and raise unemployment, he was
quoted as saying.
   Senchagov said the government has not yet decided which approach
it will try to put into effect.
   After being installed in a powerful presidency on March 15,
Mikhail S. Gorbachev said his most important task was to take more
radical steps to cure the economy.
   Last week, a source confirmed previous news reports that
Gorbachev's economists are working on a 17-point program leading to
a market system and convertibility of the Soviet Union's currency
on world markets.
   The source, who is working on the program, said Soviet
economists were encouraged by Poland's tough measures that went
into effect on Jan. 1, but they were worried they might create huge
unemployment and the need for a vast welfare program. The source
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Many reports in Moscow say radical economic changes will be put
into effect this summer.
   Senchagov's bureaucracy sets prices without regard to costs,
creating artificially low prices for oil and gas and many natural
resources, as well as for food and basic consumer goods.
   But the artificially low return for Soviet industry stifles
production and initiative.
   Subsidies to keep prices low now cost the government the
equivalent of one-fifth the total volume of the country's retail
trade, Senchagov reported.
   Consumers have become used to a system that offers a minimum of
choice for low prices, and many react with alarm to reports that
the government is planning to free prices. Public concern has
forced the government to delay key price reforms several times.
   As a result of government management of prices, one
videocassette costs about twice as much as a 1,200-mile airline
trip.
   Also, the country has long told its people they have a right to
a job. But many enterprises lose money because of bloated payrolls.
   Poland's prices have increased 1,366 percent during the 12-month
period ending Feb. 28, the Warsaw government says, and more than
200,000 people are unemployed. But under Poland's drastic economic
plan, inflation has dropped from 79 percent in January to an
estimated 6 percent in March.
   Poland has restocked its store shelves, while Soviets see their
stores becoming emptier and emptier.
   The most conservative of the three approaches in Moscow would
raise some prices for raw materials and some manufactured goods by
fixed amounts.
   Under the most radical approach, however, oil and coal prices
will increase three to five times. The number of collective and
state farms, known for their inefficiency, will drop by 80 percent,
``unprofitable enterprises will be closed and unemployment will
increase fast,'' Tass quoted Senchagov as saying.

   Most of the allies are supportive, but
President Bush is getting it from left and right here at home over
his gentle approach to the Soviet Union on Lithuania.
   While the president has his congressional supporters _ most
notably Democratic House Speaker Thomas Foley _ his critics are
concerned that Bush's refusal to confront Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev could undercut Lithuania's chances of attaining
independence.
   The opportunity is unique. Lithuania and its sister republics of
Latvia and Estonia were incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1940.
This is the first real chance they have had to get away.
   By all indications, Bush and others in the administration are
sympathetic. They do not recognize the incorporation as being legal
and they support independence in principle.
   But they are not being very tough about it.
   ``Bush would sacrifice Lithuania,'' the conservative Washington
Times said in a banner headline Thursday after a congressional
delegation had visited Bush at the White House to complain about
his policy.
   Nor is the consternation on Capitol Hill confined to Republicans.
   ``He's decided to stick with Gorbachev,'' said Rep. Bill
Sarpalius, D-Texas, part of the group that met with Bush.
   ``There's a genuine concern ... that the U.S. faces a choice of
political survival of Gorbachev and survival of Lithuania,'' said
Richard Durbin, D-Ill., the delegation leader.
   The criticism cuts across the political spectrum. Liberal and
conservative columnists are hammering away at Bush. Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., called on the administration to challenge
the Soviet Union's claim on Lithuania in the International Court of
Justice in The Hague, Netherlands.
   Others are reluctant to criticize Bush.
   ``I don't criticize the president at this moment in recognizing
that circumstances are very delicate, very serious,'' Foley said.
``I think he should be given the benefit of the doubt as he deals
with this.''
   Through it all, the president and his spokesmen have not
wavered, though the weariness is beginning to show.
   ``We no longer find it beneficial to comment on every daily
episode and contribute to what was an upward spiraling of the
rhetoric,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday.
``We want to level off, if you will.''
   From the start, Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III
have taken a consistent tack: the Soviets and the Lithuanians
should settle their differences peacefully. If the Kremlin applies
force it could backfire.
   This is the policy Baker is conveying to Moscow through
diplomatic channels. It is the same policy the administration is
voicing in public.
   Critics find it too soft, too solicitous of Gorbachev, too
concerned that U.S.-Soviet relations could suffer if the
administration put more starch into its public and private
statements.
   But Bush and Baker have concluded that a good relationship with
Moscow under Gorbachev has produced dividends for the United
States. Tensions have been reduced. The Soviets have agreed to pull
tens of thousands of troops from Europe, along with tank divisions
and other weapons.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will hold talks
with Baker at the State Department next Wednesday through Friday in
preparation for a Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting in Washington in
June.
   Bush and Baker clearly are banking on the proposition that they
can maintain good relations without sacrificing Lithuanian
independence.
   ``Nobody denies their right of self-determination,'' Sergei
Chetverikov, minister-counselor of the Soviet Embassy, said Tuesday.
   And, he told reporters, ``the basic premise behind the actions
of the Soviet Union is not to use force, but to find peaceful
ways.''
   The Soviet diplomat, an expert on constitutional law,
acknowledged, however, that ``the situation is difficult.''
   It is also difficult for Bush and Baker, who have been accused
in the past of taking too soft an approach _ to China after the
suppression of pro-democracy forces last June, for instance.
   Bush has wavered between a conservative and a moderate stance
throughout his political career. Right-wing Republicans savored his
attack on liberals during the 1988 presidential campaign against
Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, but they still are checking
his credentials.
   Baker, Bush's guru during the campaign, also is suspected of
being too pragmatic, of being inclined to put solutions ahead of
ideology.
   Indeed, there is a strong element of pragmatism in the policy
the administration is pursuing on Lithuania. But it also may
succeed, without hurting either the Lithuanians or U.S.-Soviet
relations

<HEAD>Critics Rip Israeli Military Aid to Ethiopia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Israel's military aid to the Soviet-backed
Ethiopia government could prolong civil strife in that
famine-wracked country, lawmakers and others say.
   ``It really bothers me that Israel would jeopardize its position
in Congress by supporting that butcher Mengistu,'' Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., said Thursday, referring to Ethiopia's leader, Hile
Mengistu Mariam.
   Burton along with other members of Congress and the Bush
administration have long attacked Mengistu for his human rights
record and his policies that have contributed to thousands of
starvation deaths over the last decade.
   Mengistu's government is waging a civil war with rebels in
Eritrea and Tigre, two provinces in northern Ethiopia.
   Israel's aid to Mengistu comes at a crucial time because the
Soviet Union has yanked the many of its advisers from Ethiopia and
cut its military assistance, according to one U.S. official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   State Department officials say they have told Israel that the
United States opposes the aid. Herman J. Cohen, the assistant
secretary of state for Africa, told the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee this week that he took a ``very hard line'' on weapons
shipments to Ethiopia when he met with Reuven Marhav, director
general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry.
   Israel has told the United States it is only providing small
weapons such as rifles and a few advisers to Ethiopia, the State
Department says. After a 20-year lapse, Israel renewed diplomatic
relations last year with Ethiopia, one of the few African countries
with which it has official ties.
   But Burton said he thinks Israeli military aid consists of more
than simply rifles, and is important because Mengistu is in
trouble. ``He is starting to make overtures to the United States _
it's a last-ditch effort,'' he said.
   Burton said he raised the issue of Israel's support for Ethiopia
in a recent meeting with Israeli Ambassador Moshe Arad. He said he
told the diplomat: ``Some members may use this issue as a wedge to
curb support for aid to Israel.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, also expressed ``grave concern''
about the Israeli arms shipments, said an aide who demanded
anonymity. Metzenbaum confirmed the meeting but said his
conversations were confidential.
   Gayle Smith of The Development Group for Alternative Policies, a
non-profit group that specializes in development issues, said
Israeli intervention in the Ethiopian civil war could turn the
conflict into a broader war.
   Israel is supporting Ethiopia and, according to recent reports,
the Saudis, the Iraqis and the Libyans are backing Mengistu's
opposition, she said.
   ``In particular, Israeli involvement is serving to enhance the
effectiveness of the Ethiopian air force, which comprises the
centerpiece of Ethiopian military strategy,'' Smith told the
Foreign Relations Committee.
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on Africa, said the Ethiopian air force's MiG
jets continue to bomb convoys of food as they move into the
famine-stricken areas of Eritrea and Tigre. Wolpe has also
expressed concern about Israeli help for Mengistu.
   Israel is backing the Mengistu government for several reasons.
In part, the Israelis have said they are concerned for the welfare
of about 15,000 black Jews live in Ethiopia.
   But Smith said she believes the Israelis are worried about the
future of the Horn of Africa should the Eritreans secede. Such a
development would bring ``complete Arab dominance of the Red Sea,''
she said.
   Moreover, Ethiopia also allows Israel overfly rights to South
Africa, she said.

   Sen. Robert C. Byrd said he wanted to be
magnanimous in defeat after losing by a single vote a $500 million
aid package for 5,000 coal miners who may lose their jobs if
Congress passes a clean air bill.
   But it remains to be seen just how forgiving the veteran West
Virginia Democrat, a key controller of the government's purse
strings, will be after his measure succumbed to the opposition of
congressional leaders and President Bush on Thursday.
   ``I know how hard it is to say no to the president of the United
States,'' Byrd said with a touch of irritation after the 50-49
defeat. ``I've said no to the expert, Lyndon Johnson.''
   Not since two years ago when Byrd, then his party's leader in
the Senate, had a Republican colleague arrested and physically
carried to the Senate floor to frustrate a filibuster had he put so
much of his clout on the line.
   That time the effort was on behalf of his party, as part of
failed drive to pass a campaign finance reform bill vigorously
opposed by President Reagan and Republican lawmakers.
   On Thursday, fighting back tears, Byrd conceded defeat again.
   ``It's pretty tough to have to be confronted with the
administration and the joint leadership,'' the 32-year Senate
veteran told his colleagues. ``But I knew that when I started out.
I have no regrets, no recriminations.''
   As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee that largely
controls where tax dollars are spent, Byrd arguably is in a better
position to take recriminations against colleagues than he was as
majority leader.
   That kind of power, recognized and addressed by several
lawmakers during two weeks of debate, was not lost on Byrd's chief
foes _ Sen. George Mitchell, the Maine Democrat who last year
succeeded him as majority leader, and GOP leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Mitchell, who has viewed air pollution as a top legislative
priority his his nine years in the Senate, had negotiated a
compromise with Dole and Bush on a comprehensive cleanup package
costing an estimated $21 billion a year.
   Mitchell argued repeatedly that the cost of Byrd's amendment
would raise the price of the bill to a level unacceptable to the
White House.
   ``I don't have the influence the senator from West Virginia has
but I have a little,'' Dole said. ``This could kill the bill.''
   The amendment would have paid special benefits to miners of
high-sulfur coal in the Midwest and Applachia whose jobs will be
lost as utilities swith to less-polluting coal mined in the West in
order to meet the new law's requirements.
   On the vote, only 15 Democrats sided with Mitchell, compared
with the 37 who went with Byrd. Dole kept 34 Republicans in line
with the administration, but Byrd got 11 GOP votes.
   Byrd's influence also was not lost on the interest groups
lobbying behind the scenes. Despite urgings by Mitchell to them to
stay out of the fight, both the AFL-CIO and the National Clean Air
Coalition of environmental groups endorsed and actively lobbied for
Byrd's amendment.
   Byrd actually was holding a 50-47 edge going into the closing
minutes of the vote. Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, a long-time
ally of Byrd, arrived in a wheelchair after being absent for
several weeks because of cancer treatments, to vote for the
amendment.
   Many of the senators who stayed on the fence until the vote
occurred also side with Byrd. Among them were Democrats Claiborne
Pell of Rhode Island and Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and
Republicans Charles Grassley of Iowa and Thad Cochran of
Mississippi.
   ``Three who said they would vote with me changed,'' Byrd
grumbled afterward. ``They took wings ... with the help of people
downtown (at the White House).''
   One of the switchers was Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho, an opponent
of most of the measures in the bill. Symms originally voted for
Byrd's amendment, but he switched after a two-minute face-off with
Dole and GOP Whip Alan Simpson of Wyoming on the Senate floor.
   While the ``ayes'' and ``nos'' were being shouted, Simpson
rushed up to Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., and escorted him to the
cloakroom to take a phone call from White House chief of staff John
Sununu.
   ``He guaranteed me that the president was going to veto the bill
(if the amendment passed),'' Biden said, explaining his vote
against it. ``If this were not a dealbuster, if it would not kill
this bill, I would vote with (Byrd).''

<HEAD>Sandinistas Rushing Aid to Salvadoran Rebels, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Nicaragua's leftist government prepares to
leave office, U.S. officials say there has been a marked increase
in Sandinista military shipments to rebel forces in El Salvador.
   The officials said Thursday there has been a noticeable increase
in the shipments, mostly ammunition and explosives, following the
Sandinsta defeat in the Feb. 25 elections.
   According to the officials, who asked not to be identified, the
Managua government is sending vessels loaded with equipment to an
area off El Salvador's southeast coast.
   The cargo is then loaded onto large canoes with 55-horsepower
engines, which deliver the goods to a swampy area along the
Salvadoran coast, the sources said.
   The area is largely inaccessible to the Salvadoran Army because
the FMLN rebels have planted mines there.
   The operations, carried out under cover of darkness, occur ``not
daily but regularly,'' said one official.
   The Sandinistas have systematically denied any role in
supporting the Salvadoran insurgency since 1981. The State
Department has maintained that the link between the two has been
unbroken almost since the Sandinistas came to power in 1979.
   As U.S. officials see it, the link will become uncertain after
April 25 when President Daniel Ortega is scheduled to turn power
over to President-elect Violeta Chamorro. The FMLN probably will
have to shut down the command and control headquarters it has
maintained in Managua, they said.
   Some rebel supplies have been sent from Cuba via Nicaragua. But
this source is not expected to be available to the rebels once the
Sandinistas are out of power, the officials said.
   U.S. intelligence picked up evidence a few months ago that Cuba
had begun to ship weapons to the insurgents along a land route that
begins in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and runs through Guatemala to
El Salvador. The peninsula is only about 75 miles from Cuba's west
coast.
   Mexico has denied that its territory has been used for
transporting weaponry to the Salvadorans.
   There is some concern within the Bush adminstration that the
Sandinistas, who are well-armed, may try to find ways to continue
supplying equipment to their Salvadoran allies even after they
surrender power.
   Still, officials said that with the Sandinista defeat, the
rebels are facing an unfavorable political and military situation.
They are more isolated politically than at any time since the
insurgency began a decade ago and they used up many supplies in the
offensive they launched in early November.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has said that this
combination of factors has improved prospects for a negotiated
settlement to the Salvadoran war, which is believed to have claimed
more than 70,000 lives. He is hopeful a peace agreement can be
reached this year.

   Heavyweight champion James ``Buster'' Douglas
recalled his family's struggle with poverty as he urged
congressional support for a program to help the poor pay heating
bills.
   The 232-pound boxer was the first witness Thursday before a
Labor and Human Resources subcommittee. Wearing a starched white
shirt and a black suit with a white hankerchief in the lapel, he
read a two-page statement and answered questions from panelists.
   Douglas did not mention the Bush administration's proposed 25
percent cut for the 1991 fiscal year in the Low Income Home Energy
Assistance Program, which served 5.9 million households last year.
   Instead, he gave the Subcommittee on Children, Families, Drugs
and Alcoholism a personal account of poverty in his hometown of
Columbus, Ohio, and ended with a plea to ``do everything you can.''
   ``I was 15 and we had a pretty terrible winter that year and we
were behind on our gas bill,'' he said. A local aid program helped
get the family through.
   ``I think that that had a great deal to do with me becoming
heavyweight champion of the world,'' he said. ``In hard times, we
had support.''

   The Go-Go's reunited in concert
for the first time in five years to promote a state ballot
initiative, but the performance turned out to be a referendum on
the group's future.
   ``After the show we took a vote,'' guitarist Jane Wiedlin said
backstage amid talk of a fall tour. ``Maybe in September. September
isn't for sure, but we're going to do something together.''
   She said the band made no decisions on recording an album.
   Belinda Carlisle, Charlotte Caffey, Gina Schock, Kathy Valentine
and Wiedlin had the Universal Amphitheatre audience on its feet
throughout Wednesday night's show.
   The hometown crowd loved such early '80s hits as ``We Got the
Beat,'' ``Vacation'' and ``Cool Jerk.'' The Go-Go's, who had only
one week of rehearsal, were tougher critics.
   ``It was sloppy,'' Wiedlin admitted.
   The Go-Go's formed in the late 1970s and rose from the Los
Angeles club scene to stardom. The group broke up in 1985 after
three best-selling albums. Band members went on to solo projects or
work with other groups.
   The concert was a benefit for an anti-pollution measure that
needs 650,000 signatures to make the 1990 ballot.

   Ted Turner credits his Cable News
Network with awakening him to world problems.
   ``Until then, I was more interested in myself and my family,''
Turner told students at the McCallie School, which he attended from
1951 to 1956.
   After starting his 24-hour TV news station about 10 years ago,
Turner told the students, he figured he'd better keep up more with
the world's activities.
   ``And I came to the conclusion after studying it on my own that
we had made a terrible mistake getting involved in the arms race.''
   Of even greater concern, Turner said, are world overpopulation
and threats to the environment from business and industry.
   ``I now look on development as bad,'' he said. ``When I see a
new building going up, it makes me feel bad.''

   A jury awarded $56,000 in libel damages to Queen
Elizabeth II's nephew, Viscount Linley, over a newspaper story that
claimed he was banned from a pub for throwing beer.
   The 28-year-old furniture designer, 12th in line to the throne,
won the award Thursday against the Today newspaper. Today also will
have to pay legal costs estimated at $121,500.
   Today admitted that its 1989 story was untrue, but two
free-lance reporters and a Today staffer said their source was the
pub's manager, Carolyn Peacock.
   She testified on Linley's behalf, however, and denied telling
reporters about him. ``I would not have recognized Viscount Linley
if I'd seen him, I'm afraid,'' she said.
   Today Editor David Montgomery called the verdict surprising and
said the newspaper would appeal.

<HEAD>Navy's Newest Missile At Sea</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has its most lethal ballistic missile
at the ready, with the first Trident 2 missile deployed aboard the
submarine USS Tennessee.
   ``This marks the start of an era,'' said Navy spokesman Lt.
Cmdr. Craig Quigley. ``This missile will serve as one-third of the
nation's strategic triad for many years to come.''
   A military source who declined to be identified said the vessel
left its base at King's Bay, Ga., about 7:30 a.m. EST Thursday.
   The Navy said in a statement that the Trident 2 program has
handled all of its tests successfully. The service plans to build
24 Trident subs and purchase Trident 2, or D-5, missiles through
fiscal year 2001.
   Greenpeace, an environmental group that has tried to halt
testing of the weapons system at sea, said protestors aboard a
60-foot sailboat and three motorized inflatable rafts intercepted
the Tennessee and Coast Guard escort boats 13 miles off the
Atlantic coast on Thursday.
   Josh Handler, a Greenpeace spokesman, said a Coast Guard boat
boarded one of the rafts and cut its fuel line. He said Greenpeace
activists aboard another raft rescued two Coast Guard crew members
who were dumped overboard as their boat cut across the raft's bow.
   The program encountered problems last year after two of its
first three submarine-launch tests ended in failure when the
missiles self-destructed. It was declared on track in January after
a $125 million repair of the missile's nozzle system.
   However, the Navy statement said the program, which has cost $35
billion to date, ``was delivered two years early and was 12 percent
below the budget originally provided.''
   The program formally achieved what is called the initial
operational capability, meaning ``it is declared ready for use,''
Quigley said. It marks the end of its land-based and
submarine-based flight tests, as well as all readiness checks for
its missiles, crew and equipment aboard the USS Tennessee, the
statement said.
   The first eight Trident subs produced for the Navy have gone to
sea with the Trident 1 missile, which is less accurate than the new
version. The vessels are scheduled to be re-equipped with Trident 2
missiles during the 1990s as they are brought in for overhauls.
   Quigley said the Trident program could be hampered if the Energy
Department is unable to resume production of warhead triggers by
the end of June. The triggers are made at the Rocky Flats plant
near Denver, which has been closed since last November for safety
improvements.
   Quigley said Energy Secretary James D. Watkins had informed the
Navy that it hoped to get Rocky Flats restarted by the end of June,
but that no firm date had been set.
   ``If he doesn't meet that schedule ... then we'll have to
reassess at that point'' the Trident missile deployment schedule,
Quigley said, adding that Watkins so far had given the Navy no
indication that it would be unable to meet its schedule.

   Jewish organizations are calling Rep. Gus
Savage a bigot for his attacks on a pro-Israel lobbying group, but
the black House member says the only racists are white.
   Savage, D-Ill., held a news conference Thursday, insisting in
advance on ``nonbelligerent'' questions. He denied that his attacks
on the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee for supporting his
opponent in a recent primary election were anti-Semitic. And he
declared: ``Racism is white. There is no black racism.''
   AIPAC spokeswoman Toby Dershowitz said, ``Savage's insertion of
bigotry and anti-Semitism into the political arena is regretful and
abhorrent. The American Jewish community has long prided itself on
a high level of political involvement.''
   Justin J. Finger, associate national director of the
Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, said Savage's statements
``encourage hatred of Jews and Israel'' and are ``a reprehensible
attempt to drive a wedge between blacks and Jews.''
   Savage called the mostly restrained news conference to show
reporters and interested House members a videotape of his attacks
on AIPAC during a March 17 primary campaign rally in Chicago.
Savage won the election.
   At the rally, Savage said supporters of AIPAC _ the main
pro-Israel lobbying group _ provided most of the financing last
January and February for his defeated opponent, Mel Reynolds.
   Savage insisted at the news conference there was ``nothing
anti-Semitic'' in his statements. He said he read a list of Jewish
contributors to Reynolds during the rally simply to show their
connection to AIPAC.
   ``I was unaware I had been targeted by AIPAC. I thought that was
wrong,'' Savage said, adding it was ``a disgrace'' that the lobby
and contributors from outside the district had a major influence on
Reynolds.
   He questioned whether a majority of Jews support the pro-Israel
lobby and declared he was one of the ``very few members'' willing
to publicly oppose AIPAC.
   Also during the news conference, Savage called the Academy
Award-winning film ``Driving Miss Daisy'' _ about an elderly white
woman and her chauffeur _ an insult to blacks, and made his
oft-repeated statement that racist media were out to get him.
   Savage's remarks have been closely followed since the House
ethics committee last month found that he made ``improper
advances'' to a female Peace Corps worker during a trip to Zaire a
year ago.
   The panel said Savage violated a House rule on members' conduct
but took no action to punish him, citing a voluntary letter of
apology to the woman.
   Savage said Thursday that ``a network of so-called journalists''
was out to ``deliberately distort'' news about him and that the
white-dominated media have ``tried to paint me as crazy _ crazy
Gus.''
   Savage on occasion raised his voice to interrupt reporters who
asked critical questions, and gave lengthy speeches about racism in
America.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Savage's remarks
about AIPAC at the rally in Chicago ``created an impression of
bigotry'' and ``can be legitimately construed as offensive.''
   Foley said he has no control over Savage's comments. ``We have
standards for conduct. Unfortunately, they don't require good sense
or judgment always,'' he said.
   Asked whether Savage had exercised good judgment, Foley replied,
``Not on this issue certainly, and I think it went beyond just a
matter of bad judgment ... into language and statements that are,
can be legitimately construed as offensive.''

<HEAD>VA Compensation Decision Doesn't Resolve Agent Orange Controversy</HEAD>

   The decision by the Veterans Affairs
Department to award compensation to Vietnam veterans suffering from
one rare form of cancer doesn't resolve the dispute over exposure
to Agent Orange.
   The decision, announced Thursday, could make it possible for the
VA to close the doors to compensation for a host of ailments linked
to the herbicide used in Vietnam from 1965 to 1970 to deny jungle
cover to the enemy.
   Based on a study released the same day by the federal Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta, VA Secretary Edward J. Derwinski
said he would award 100 percent disability payments to any Vietnam
veteran suffering from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   Payments would be retroactive, and widows and children would
receive survivors' benefits as well. More than 1,800 veterans or
their survivors could receive compensation as a result, according
to VA data, at a cost of $23 million the first year and about $25
million in subsequent years.
   Veterans advocates were pleased with the immediate decision but
remained skeptical about the study's application to the larger
Agent Orange questions. The government has insisted there is no
scientific proof of a link between the herbicide and a host of
ailments, mostly cancers.
   ``When the study was designed, CDC admitted that the study
population was significantly diluted with unexposed veterans, that
it lacked a meaningful measure of exposure and that it lacked the
statistical power to detect anything less than a 100 percent
increase in certain cancers,'' said Sen. Thomas A. Daschle.
   Daschle, D-S.D., is co-chairman of the Vietnam-Era Veterans in
Congress Caucus and wrote legislation to make the disease and
others suspected of having a link with Agent Orange exposure
service-connected.
   The CDC ``Selected Cancers Study'' looked at the occurrence of
cancer in all Vietnam veterans in relation to men who did not serve
in Vietnam. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was the only cancer found in the
study to have had an unusually high incidence.
   Derwinski was initially very careful to say his decision was not
an Agent Orange decision, but he and his aides were fuzzier in
later remarks.
   Derwinski at one point said he made his determination based at
least in part on the work of a VA-commissioned panel of outside
scientists. That group reported last November that it could not
find, but neither could it rule out, a statistically significant
association between Agent Orange exposure and non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.
   As a result of that finding, Derwinski had said he would
postpone a decision on Agent Orange compensation until after the
CDC study. He had planned, however, to wait for the advisory
panel's recommendation in May.
   Derwinski jumped the gun Thursday, but he insisted the panel
would continue its work on the Agent Orange issue. Derwinski is
also consulting with Elmo Zumwalt, the retired admiral who ordered
Agent Orange spraying and whose son died of a cancer linked to
exposure.
   Some 36,000 Agent Orange claims have been made for the lymphoma
and other ailments have been made, and almost all have been
rejected. About 230,000 veterans have asserted they have been
exposed to Agent Orange.
   The CDC study left some questions unresolved. It noted, for
example, that Navy veterans were more inclined to get the disease
even though they were least likely to have been exposed to Agent
Orange. It also said the lowest incidence was among veterans of III
Corps, the area of highest Agent Orange use.
   John Hanson, an American Legion official, said the study
neglected to point out that the III Corps area included Saigon,
which wasn't sprayed.
   Deputy Veterans Secretary Anthony J. Principi said VA was making
the presumption that any veteran who served in Vietnam was exposed
to Agent Orange. But Hanson said such a determination dilutes any
statistical sample to the point where an Agent Orange determination
is impossible.

   AIDS activists welcome President Bush's
attention to the epidemic that has ravaged the gay community and is
spreading among drug users, but they say he must match his
sympathetic words with action.
   ``Compassion is important, but we need money,'' said Tim
McFeeley of the Human Rights Campaign Fund.
   In a speech Thursday to the National Leadership Coalition on
AIDS, Bush called on Congress to pass the Americans with
Disabilities Act to bar discrimination against people with AIDS and
those who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or
HIV, which causes AIDS.
   He also touted his administration's proposed fiscal 1991 budget
proposal for spending $3.5 billion on AIDS treatment, research and
education.
   But Jean McGuire, executive director of the AIDS Action Council,
said ``the sensitivity we're seeing could mask the inaction we've
had for the last decade'' under former President Reagan.
   ``If today is the beginning and not an end to the president's
efforts, we can be hopeful,'' she said. ``But a decade of neglect
requires a more aggressive and substantive and meaningful
leadership than we heard today.''
   Leaders of the National Commission on AIDS were more positive in
their reaction to the president's first major speech on the
disease, which has taken the lives of more than 70,000 Americans,
most of them homosexuals or intravenous drug abusers. They called
Bush's attention an important first step in escalating the public
battle against the epidemic.
   Dr. June Osborn, the commission's chairwoman, said that even
though the president offered no new initiatives, it was important
that he showed concern about the issue and compassion for people
with AIDS.
   ``In terms of changing the public mood, we desperately need that
rhetoric,'' she said.
   ``We're on wartime footing'' at the National Institutes of
Health and the Centers for Disease Control in the battle against
AIDS, Bush told the coalition of business, labor, health and
religious groups.
   But AIDS activists said the president was trying to inflate the
administration's commitment to the AIDS battle by including, among
other things, spending on Medicaid and Medicare patients who have
AIDS. That amounts to more than $1 billion of Bush's total for AIDS
spending.
   AIDS activists attending the conference said that with just one
speech, Bush has done more than Reagan did for their cause.
   But they were disappointed Bush did not address some of the
major issues relating to AIDS, including an immigration policy that
bars people with the fatal disease from entering the country.
   Many activists had hoped the president would address the
immigration policy, which has prompted dozens of organizations and
agencies to boycott an international conference on AIDS planned for
San Francisco in June.
   ``We have become an embarrassment in the global community that
is dealing with this disease,'' said McGuire of the human rights
fund.
   The administration has been granting waivers of the policy to
people who enter the United States for conferences and to seek
medical attention. But pressure is building on the White House and
Congress to remove HIV infection from a list of contagious diseases
that is grounds for barring people entry to the country.
   Robert Haas, chairman and chief executive officer of Levi
Strauss &amp; Co., told the leadership coalition that Bush's decision
to address the group was of ``symbolic and historic importance.''
   But Haas also criticized the president for proposing to
eliminate funding for treatment of AIDS among low-income people not
eligible for Medicaid. He said Bush also cut funding for home and
community-based care demonstration projects for AIDS patients and
said the president's budget for the war on drugs does not
adequately support prevention and treatment of AIDS.

   The U.S. Senate cast a pall over
thousands of coal miners by rejecting a $500 million compensation
plan for those who could lose their jobs under a proposed clean air
bill, union officials say.
   ``It's a real tragedy,'' said Howard Green, international
executive board representative for United Mine Workers District 17
in Charleston.
   Sen. Robert Byrd's amendment to the Clean Air Act would have
compensated the more than 5,000 miners expected to lose their jobs
over the next three years if the bill passes.
   The measure would require coal-fired power plants to severely
cut emissions; that likely would cause some utilities to switch
from high-sulfur coal to other fuels.
   The Senate rejected Byrd's amendment Thursday on a 50-49 vote.
   ``Let each senator ask himself the question, `Is this fair?'''
said the West Virginia Democrat. ``What about what the president
has said about this being a kinder, gentler nation? Does kinder and
gentler stop at the edge of the coal fields?''
   The restrictions on high-sulfur coal use could hit hard,
siphoning off coal-mining jobs to areas with low-sulfur coal.
   UMW President Richard Trumka said the Senate ``failed to
recognize the devastating effect that this clean air legislation
will have on the nation's coal miners, their families and their
communities.''
   ``If the bill passes in its present state, we anticipate losing
2,000 West Virginia mining jobs,'' said Mike Burdiss, head of the
union's Coal Miners Political Action Committee in Charleston.
   UMW officials said they're not exactly sure what will happen now
that Byrd's efforts to aid the miners have been rebuffed.
   Green predicted ``major displacement'' of miners as they go off
in search of jobs.
   ``We're just going to have to wait and see. There's a lot of ifs
out there right now,'' said Eugene Claypool, president of UMW
District 31 in northern West Virginia, which has much of the
state's high-sulfur coal. ``Where it's going to occur and when it's
going to occur, I don't know.''
   Sens. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and Mitch
McConnell, R-Ky., voted for Byrd's amendment. Sens. Charles Robb,
D-Va., and John Warner, R-Va., voted against it.
   Kentucky and West Virginia have more high-sulfur coal reserves
than Virginia.
   ``It was a tough blow to see the two senators from Virginia
voting against it,'' Green said. ``They didn't look beyond their
borders. I just think those senators are insensitive to the coal
industry.''

<HEAD>Death Rates Down, Life Expectancy Up</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life expectancy in the United States has never
been higher, but disparities remain between whites and blacks,
federal researchers say.
   Overall U.S. life expectancy rose to 75 years, according to 1987
data, the Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   That was up 0.2 years _ about 73 days _ from 1986, said Ken
Kochanek, a statistician with the CDC's National Center for Health
Statistics in Hyattsville, Md.
   The life-expectancy concept means that someone born in 1987
would live, on the average, 75 years. Women, on average, outlive
men by 6.9 years.
   Overall, Americans can now expect to live about 12 years longer
than they could expect 50 years ago; the life expectancy rate in
1940 was 62.9.
   But while average life expectancy for whites was 75.6 years _ up
slightly from 1986 _ life expectancy for blacks was 69.4 years,
same as the year before.
   And though the nation's mortality rate was down, annual black
death rates were 50 percent higher than for whites _ 778.6 per
100,000 blacks, compared with 511.1 for whites.
   The greatest single disparity in death rates was for death by
homicide. The black homicide rate in 1987 was six times higher than
that for whites, the CDC reported.
   Meanwhile, the nation's overall mortality rate in 1987 _ the
latest year for which analysis is available _ fell to a record low
of 535.5 deaths for every 100,000 Americans. That's down 1 percent
from a year earlier and down 7 percent from 1979.
   A total of 2,123,323 U.S. deaths were reported in 1987 _ the
highest number ever, as the nation's population has grown.
   The decline in the overall death rate came as fatality rates
dropped for 13 of the previous year's 15 leading causes of death,
including the big four: heart disease, cancer, stroke and
accidental injuries.
   The death rate from heart disease, the nation's leading killer,
dropped 3.1 percent. The rate for cancer declined 0.2 percent, the
rate for stroke and cerebrovascular disease fell 2.3 percent, and
the rate for accidents dropped 1.7 percent.
   Among the 15 leading causes of death, the only increases were
among diabetes, up 2.1 percent, and septicemia, or blood
infections, up 4.7 percent.
   Year-by-year comparisons were unavailable for AIDS deaths
because of 1987 changes in categorization in the mortality study,
the CDC said.
   But CDC data on AIDS found a 32 percent increase in deaths
between 1986 and 1987, and ``mortality from AIDS appears to be
increasing more rapidly than mortality from other conditions,'' the
Atlanta-based agency said.
   Acquired immune deficiency sydrome replaced birth defects as the
15th leading cause of death.

<HEAD>Senator Calls for Recheck of Nuclear Failsafe Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee is calling for U.S.-Soviet reviews of failsafe systems
because of concerns that unrest in the Baltic republics could put
nuclear weapons in the wrong hands.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., suggested Thursday that the Bush
administration urge the Soviet Union to join the United States in
conducting separate, but parallel, studies of nuclear control
programs.
   ``If nationalists or terrorists overran a Soviet nuclear storage
site in one of the republics, would the superpowers coordinate
their actions?'' Nunn said in a Senate floor speech.
   ``Have we thought through the problem of how we would respond to
nuclear blackmail?''
   Nunn suggested using the existing Nuclear Risk Reductions
Centers for talks about how the two superpowers could avoid an
inadvertent nuclear war.
   Ethnic unrest in Azerbaijan and Lithuania's declaration of
independence March 11 have prompted Moscow to resort to military
force.
   Nunn also acknowledged the lessening Soviet conventional threat
and questioned whether the administration is correctly
characterizing the Soviets' modernization of their strategic forces.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said unequivocally that there
has been no reduction in Soviet strategic forces and the only
change has been in improving their forces.
   ``The administration has tended to overstate its case,'' Nunn
said.
   He said U.S. intelligence has found a decrease in the Soviet's
Blackjack bomber production. In addition, the Soviets have ceased
patrolling U.S. coasts with its Yankee-class submarines and
patrolling north of Canada with its nuclear-armed Bear-H bomber.
   Nunn also discussed his complaints in a speech last week that
the administration's fiscal 1991 defense budget has several major
blanks that Congress will fill if the Pentagon doesn't.
   Cheney, in a speech shortly after Nunn's address last week,
disputed some of the chairman's claims and said the Defense
Department is recognizing rapid changes in Eastern Europe in
fashioning a spending plan for fiscal 1992 to 1997.
   ``It is crucial to note, however, that Secretary Cheney made no
claim that the administration's fiscal 1991 budget request reflects
all these assumptions,'' Nunn said Thursday as he urged the
Pentagon chief to fill in the blanks quickly.
   Questioned about Nunn's comments, Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams said: ``It would be very difficult, if not dare one say,
imprudent, to send up a '91 budget on the basis of things that
haven't happened yet. As events change, we will adjust our plans
accordingly.''

<HEAD>Concern About Job Bias Behind Move to Drop Penalties</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics of a 4-year-old immigration law are
pushing to repeal its penalties against employers who hire illegal
aliens, citing a report that blames the law for widespread hiring
discrimination.
   ``Unless Congress finds a way to end this discrimination, the
sanctions must be repealed,'' Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said
Thursday after the General Accounting Office issued its report on
the immigration law.
   However, Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner
Gene McNary said the GAO report was ``soft,'' and Sen. Alan
Simpson, R-Wyo., said the facts did not justify the agency's
findings of widespread discrimination.
   ``Today, I learned a whole new definition of the word
widespread,'' said Simpson, who has played a major role in writing
immigration laws.
   The law, designed to curb the flow of illegals over the southern
border in search of high-paying jobs, calls for civil and criminal
penalties against those who employ ineligible workers.
   Critics predicted when the measure was passed by Congress in
1986 that it would cause employers to discriminate against
``foreign-looking'' applicants.
   The GAO's report said the law ``is not an unnecessary burden on
employers.'' It concluded that the measure has not caused frivolous
complaints against employers and ``has apparently reduced illegal
immigration.''
   INS figures show that 383,375 illegals were apprehended on the
southern border from October 1987 through February 1988, compared
with 267,174 in the same period a year later. In the comparable
period ending last month, apprehensions increased to 366,844.
   The INS' McNary told a news conference the number of
apprehensions would have doubled had it not been for the 1986
immigration law, and the GAO report cited a study by the Urban
Institute that found a slowing of illegal immigration.
   The GAO said ``many employers discriminated because the law's
verification system does not provide a simple or reliable method to
verify job applicants' eligibility to work.''
   It said up to 10 percent of the 4.6 million employers considered
under the GAO survey may be practicing job bias based on national
origins because of confusion over the immigration law.
   Discrimination related to the law is ``serious but not
pervasive,'' the 162-page report said. It said hiring bias might be
reduced by more information for employers and a simpler and more
reliable system for verifying work eligibility.
   Under the law, employers must complete an eligibility form for
each newly hired worker. It allows the employees to establish their
eligibility by presenting any one of 17 documents, such as a U.S.
passport, birth certificate or alien registration card.
   In response to the report, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights
urged Congress to repeal the law's penalty provisions, saying
``evidence has been building rapidly in recent months that employer
sanctions cause serious employment discrimination.''
   ``This discrimination is unacceptable and its root cause _
employer sanctions _ should be eliminated,'' the independent,
fact-finding agency said in a statement.
   The INS' McNary told reporters that some of the GAO's
conclusions were ``soft because there is no base of comparison in
the past.'' He also pointed to a statement in the document that
said some interpreters might not agree with the findings.
   ``They own up to the fact that others may disagree and for good
reason,'' he said.

<HEAD>Scientists See No Trend of Earth Warming In Satellite Data</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists who analyzed 10 years of weather
satellite data found no evidence that the Earth has warmed from the
so-called greenhouse effect.
   In a paper published today in the journal Science, the
scientists reported that the TIROS-N series of weather satellites
accurately measured the Earth's temperature from 1979 through 1988
and found no evidence of climate change.
   ``We found that the Earth's atmosphere goes through fairly large
year-to-year changes in temperature and over that 10-year period we
saw no long-term warming or cooling trend,'' Roy W. Spencer of the
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., said at a news
conference Thursday.
   He said the data did prove, however, that satellites can be used
to measure the Earth's temperature with a more global perspective
than the limited ground-based instruments now in use.
   Spencer's fellow investigator, John R. Christy of the University
of Alabama, said there were temperature swings ``that can be quite
dramatic'' during the decade that was studied, but that on a global
basis, the thermal changes tended to even out.
   ``The northern hemisphere goes up slightly during those 10 years
and the southern hemisphere goes down slightly,'' said Christy.
``The net effect for the globe is basically zero.''
   Detecting a climate trend, the scientists said, will take at
least another decade of satellite measurements.
   ``There is no guarantee that if you take a 10-year segment out
of a long time that you'll get the overall trend,'' said Christy.
``The data cannot be used to say we've got an enhanced greenhouse
effect.''
   Christy said the findings ``are enough to tantalize us ... but
this is just a start'' and satellite measurements are continuing.
   The TIROS satellite data is the first to add global temperature
data to the scientific debate about the greenhouse effect, Spencer
said. Most other studies of temperature trends, some extending over
more than a century, have come from the records of ground-based
thermometers.
   These readings, Christy said, do not reflect the global
temperature because there are very few temperature measurements for
vast areas of the Earth's oceans.
   Some experts believe the Earth is beginning to warm as a result
of carbon dioxide and other gases dumped into the atmosphere over
the last 150 years. This warming, called the enhanced greenhouse
effect, is a matter of controversy in the scientific community
because of the difficulty in measuring small climate trends over a
long period.
   Eric J. Barron, director of the Earth System Science Center at
Pennsylvania State, said the analysis of the TIROS data by Spencer
and Christy could be ``extremely valuable'' in the global warming
debate, but he agreed that 10 years is too short a period to detect
a climate trend.
   What is important about the study, Barron said, is that it
proves satellite studies eventually may be able to settle the
controversy.
   Science, which published the study today, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   Opponents of a planned exhibit of photographs
by the late Robert Mapplethorpe say most of the pictures are
innocuous, even beautiful, but that nine of the sexually explicit
photos are unacceptable for Cincinnati.
   Those photographs from the 175-photo exhibit scheduled to open
next week at the Contemporary Arts Center depict sadomasochistic or
homoerotic sex acts or feature nude children, say members of
Citizens for Community Values.
   ``We're saying: We want you to exercise your responsibility and
delete the roughest images,'' Tom Grossmann, a lawyer for the group
told a news conference Thursday.
   ``There is no doubt that Mapplethorpe has created some
photographs that are art, but his homosexual material speaks so
loudly that I stand here with'' the group, said the Rev. Freddie T.
Piphus.
   In the face of strong public opposition, the center filed a
lawsuit seeking a court ruling on whether the photographs are
obscene. Last June, the exhibit was cancelled at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.
   Police and the Hamilton County sheriff have said they are
considering filing obscenity charges if the museum displays the
photographs.
   Arts Center Director Dennis Barrie was loudly applauded Thursday
at the annual convention of the Ohio Museums Association when he
said opposition and legal challenges to exhibits such as the
Mapplethorpe show was a threat to the future of art museums.
   ``This is a museum that has had to go to court ... I think
that's a very sad state of affairs,'' Barrie said. ``I think it's
time you stood up to that challenge. Your whole world is at stake.''
   In Washington, the head of the National Endowment for the Arts
said Thursday he favored the Arts Center's decision to seek a court
ruling.
   ``In my view this is precisely the forum in which this issue
should be determined because obscenity is a local issue and they
will make their decision based on community standards,'' John E.
Frohnmayer said at a Capitol Hill hearing and later at a National
Press Club luncheon.
   To quell opposition to the exhibit, the museum plans to post a
warning sign and bar unaccompanied minors while the shows runs
April 6 to May 25.
   ``They're trying to deflect the issue (by posting a warning),''
said Monty Lobb Jr., director of Citizens for Community Values, who
denied that opponents are trying to force the museum into
self-censorship.
   ``We're even going beyond the First Amendment or anything of
that nature. We're going to the dignity of human life,'' Lobb said.
He said he wanted the center ``to demonstrate civic
responsibility'' and ``be sensitive to the community.''
   Henry Dorfman, publisher of the weekly Greater Cincinnati
Business Record, said two photographs showing nude or partially
nude children might encourage child pornography.
   ``If in our art museums we freely display and tacitly advocate
this kind of abuse of children, we are in serious trouble,''
Dorfman said.

   President Bush traded quips with amateur and
professional comedians at a broadcasters' banquet, but he said he
didn't show up until the Secret Service swept the ballroom.
   ``The place was clean. No broccoli,'' Bush told the crowd of
more than 2,000 people at the annual Radio and Television
Correspondents Association dinner Thursday night.
   With his sirloin and salmon, Bush also had to digest a ribbing
at the hands of both broadcasters and impressionist Jim Morris.
   CBS reporter Linda Taira, president of the association, got in
several digs in her introduction.
   ``It's exciting for our print colleagues, Mr. President, to
cover you. They bump against their deadlines trying to punctuate
your sentences,'' she said. ``When my desk calls me in the middle
of the night, I never know whether you've invaded another country
or banned another vegetable.''
   She advised Bush to ``never, ever, take a phone call from
Hashemi Rafsanjani unless you get Caller I.D. in the Oval Office.''
   The president said he was glad to be with ``all the big names in
the electronic media,'' despite the hard time they gave him on the
recent hoax phone call from a prankster posing as the Iranian
president.
   ``Today I got him back. Called him up and asked if he had Prince
Abdul in a can,'' Bush quipped. ``But then I forgot how to say,
`Let him out,' in Farsi.''
   Bush mocked his own disjointed speaking style, which Morris and
other comics love to imitate, saying: ``I'll be honest. He's good _
too good. That's as far as I'll go. Not going to comment. Not going
to criticize Jim Morris at this juncture. Wouldn't be prudent.''
   Bush and his wife, Barbara, laughed along with most of the jokes
told by Morris and talk show host Larry King, who served as emcee.
   Morris, fielding questions as if he were president, was asked
why he had named the Panama invasion ``Operation Just Cause.'' The
mock-Bush answered, ``Just cuz.''
   ``Hey, it's Central America. It's America. It's ours,'' said
Morris.
   Morris, who also performed at a gala for Ford's Theatre that the
Bushes attended Sunday, quipped that ``the best thing we can do to
reduce the deficit is see if we can convince the Japanese ... to
produce 30 percent of their goods in a shoddy fashion.''
   Morris scored one joke at the expense of a Bush critic, the
House majority leader, saying, ``Dick Gephardt is a perfect example
of where we have failed in our public schools.''

   The uneducated and poor still face the greatest
threat from heart disease, although people of all social classes
have reduced their risk equally in recent years, a study suggests.
   University of Minnesota epidemiologist Wayne Rosamond, who
co-authored the study, presented the findings Thursday during the
American Heart Association's annual conference on heart disease
epidemiology, the study of disease among population groups.
   The results indicate lower socioeconomic classes ``obviously
have not caught up with the relative advantages of being more
educated and more affluent,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a
University of California, San Diego, researcher and chairwoman of
the association's epidemiology council.
   The Minnesota researchers examined heart disease risk factors
and socioeconomic status _ as reflected by education and family
income levels _ of 3,816 randomly selected adults in the
Minneapolis-St. Paul area in 1980-82, and of another 4,641 in
1985-87.
   Although people got slightly fatter during the study period,
those in each socioeconomic group also made statistically
equivalent reductions in blood cholesterol, blood pressure and
cigarette smoking _ major factors in heart disease.
   ``But the difference between the highly educated and less
educated is not narrowing at all,'' said Dr. Russell Luepker, chief
author of the study and a professor of epidemiology and medicine at
Minnesota.
   Lower socioeconomic groups still have the highest levels of
blood pressure, blood cholesterol, cigarette smoking and obesity,
he said.
   ``If we're going to continue to make progress, we have to target
those groups who have been least affected by improvements in
society,'' he said ``Those with lower income have higher risk and
also are the least educated. They are not making the higher level
of progress you would hope for.''
   The study found, for example, that the proportion of men who
smoked fell from 44 percent to 41 percent among those who didn't
finish high school, dropped from 40 percent to 33 percent among
those with some college, and declined from 25 percent to 21 percent
among men who graduated college.
   Another example: The proportion of women with at least one risk
factor for heart disease fell from 65 percent to 54 percent among
those who didn't finish high school, declined from 57 percent to 46
percent among those with some college, and dropped from 43 percent
to 34 percent among those who got a college degree.
   While the study found an increased risk of heart disease was
related to both low education and low family income, the link with
low education was stronger, Rosamond said.
   ``More educated people are taking better care of themselves and
have less risk because of it,'' Luepker said. ``They're the people
who are exercising, quitting smoking and eating healthier diets.''
   The only exception to the link between disease risk and social
status was that men in higher classes tended to have higher
cholesterol levels that men in lower classes, Rosamond said.

   A leading Republican opponent of the B-2
bomber says a new estimate that the program will cost $76.7 billion
provides additional ammunition for the battle against the stealth
aircraft.
   ``When the program cost $70 billion, members said they couldn't
believe it. Now it's $6.5 billion more. Clearly it bolsters our
case dramatically,'' said Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, a member of the
House Armed Services Committee.
   The Congressional Budget Office, in a letter to Kasich,
increased its cost estimates for the B-2 based on inflation
predictions and the Air Force's planned modifications to the plane.
   ``CBO estimates that the administration's program for the B-2
bomber would cost about $76.7 billion based on the best information
we have,'' the office said in the letter.
   The Pentagon has said purchasing the fleet of 132 bombers will
cost $70.2 billion. Recently, Air Force Secretary Donald Rice said
the program may cost about $75 billion.
   Kasich, who requested the information from the CBO, has
introduced legislation that would limit the B-2 purchase to the 15
planes already in production.
   In the letter, the CBO agreed with a recent report by the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, that
the cost of the program could exceed its estimates.
   ``Costs of new programs at the leading edge of technology are
always hard to estimate,'' the CBO said. ``Furthermore, there are
special estimating problems unique to the B-2 program.''
   The CBO warned that the administration may not realize the
savings it expects to gain from purchasing the radar-evading planes
over a period of years. The office also agreed with officials at
the General Accounting Office who said the bomber's cost will
increase due to the strike at the Boeing Corp., a major
subcontractor, and that future tests may expose costly problems.

<HEAD>FDA Hopes for Consensus on New Label Regulations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is hoping for a
consensus among health experts and food companies on how to make
sure consumers striving for health and fitness aren't fooled by
product labels and advertising.
   Executives from some of the country's largest food corporations
met Thursday with federal officials at a conference prompted by FDA
proposals to tighten regulation of food health claims.
   ``We're trying to define boundaries so consumers can believe
what's on that label,'' said Fred Shank, the agency's director for
food safety and applied nutrition.
   At the heart of the debate: a conflict over what diet and health
messages should be allowed on food packaging and who should set the
standards.
   ``It's clear that the current situation must change. Otherwise,
the bad messages may drive out the good,'' said Frank Young, deputy
secretary for the Department of Health and Human Services.
   The FDA hoped for agreement with the food industry, national
health experts and other policy makers by today's wrap-up of the
Tufts University-sponsored conference. The FDA plans to institute
new regulations by year's end.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan announced the
proposed regulations last month, calling them a ``mid-course
correction'' of rules that have allowed food sellers to make health
claims since 1987, when the Reagan administration abandoned a
long-standing prohibition against such claims.
   The proposal generally would let companies make certain health
claims that are backed up by studies by the Surgeon General and the
National Academy of Sciences. Other claims would be allowed only in
certain circumstances.
   The policy would allow health claims about fiber and colon
cancer, fiber and heart disease, fats and cancer, fats and heart
disease, sodium and high blood pressure, and calcium and
osteoporosis, a softening of the bones found in the elderly.
   Many food company executives at the conference here said they
have no major quarrel with more stringent FDA regulations. But
almost all voiced concern that the FDA has failed to propose
uniform national standards. They said they fear that allowing
states to set some of the standards may lead to trade barriers
between states.
   ``There are shortcomings, but we know there's an immense
interest on the part of the public for information and we're glad
to see some movement on that end,'' said Luther C. McKinney, a
senior vice president of the Quaker Oats Co., which found itself
caught in the debate over the cholesterol-lowering powers of oat
bran.
   ``We simply want to argue strongly for federal uniformity. If
we're going to have a meaningful national market, we can't deal
with 50 different regulations.''

<HEAD>FDA Recalls Drug Because of Mislabeled Bottles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration is recalling
two lots of an antidepressant drug called desipramine because some
bottles may contain a blood-thinner that could cause serious
bleeding, officials say.
   The manufacturer, Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. of Denver, told the
FDA it was calling back the products after distributor H.L. Moore
of New Britain, Conn., found a mislabeled bottle of the drug
earlier this week.
   The bottle was labeled as containing 25 milligrams of
desipramine, but it actually contained 5 milligram tablets of
warfarin, a blood-thinner.
   The FDA said people taking the antidepressant should examine
their tablets to see if any are marked with the name warfarin.
   Warfarin is a non-coated pink tablet with ``5'' on one side and
``832'' and the word ``warfarin'' on the other side.
   Desipramine is a coated, lavender tablet with the numbers
``832'' and G254'' imprinted on it.
   Pharmaceutical Basics is notifying Moore's 350 customers by
phone of the possible label mix-up, the FDA said Thursday.
   The recall applies only to desipramine made by Pharmaceutical
Basics for distribution by Moore. About six other manufacturers
make desipramine.

<HEAD>Bill Would Teach Parents To Care For Their Babies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed bill would teach parents prenatal
care and ways to develop their babies' coordination, memory,
language and social skills.
   ``We know that parental involvement in the education of their
children is the key to long-term gains for youngsters,'' Sen.
Christopher Bond, R-Mo., said Thursday. ``Parents are their child's
first and most influential teachers.''
   Bond was joined in introducing the bill by Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., and Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.
   The bill would create a national ``Parents As Teachers'' program
based on a Missouri model. A five-year, $100 million competitive
grant program would be set up for states to begin or expand Parents
As Teachers.
   The program, which operates in 26 states, employs home visits,
group meetings, videotapes and written material to teach new and
prospective parents the skills of raising an infant. There also are
periodic health screenings of children.
   Bond said the average operating cost for a Parents As Teachers
program in a school district is about $20,000 per year. He
estimated that about 1,000 school districts nationwide could
participate in the program annually with federal assistance.
   The bill would force states to eventually pick up the cost of
the program, as federal funding would decline to 75 percent in the
third year, 50 percent in the fourth year and 25 percent in the
fifth year of the five-year authorization.

<HEAD>Report: No One Overseeing Maintenance of Alaskan Oil Pipeline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government report says no one has been
properly overseeing maintenance of the Alaskan oil pipeline to
prevent a land spill as disastrous as the ocean spill in Prince
William Sound.
   But since the Exxon Valdez ran aground and dumped nearly 11
million gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean off Alaska last
year, the appropriate agencies are taking notice, said the study
released Thursday by the General Accounting Office.
   People should remain skeptical, said Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on offshore
energy resources.
   Miller has been leading a congressional investigation of the
March 24, 1989, spill and the safety of other oil industry
operations in Alaska.
   ``The regulators and the regulated have been too cozy,'' he said
of the relationship between the government and the oil industry.
   He said it's too early to tell if significant improvement has
been made, but various studies under way by the government and the
criminal case against Exxon for the spill should lead to
improvements.
   The GAO said that while several federal and state agencies have
authority over the trans-Alaska pipeline system, ``the pipeline has
not received the systematic, comprehensive oversight needed to
ensure compliance with operational safety, emergency response and
environmental requirements.''
   That's particularly worrisome because of recent news that the
pipeline is corroding, James Duffus, director of the GAO's division
on natural resources management, told Miller's subcommittee.

   Most of the U.S.-backed Contra
rebels in Honduran camps are returning to Nicaragua without waiting
for a U.N. team that is supposed to monitor their disbanding, a
rebel leader says.
   Oscar Sovalbarro, a military chief of the Nicaraguan Resistance,
the rebels' umbrella group, said Thursday that most rebels left the
camps, taking their weapons, and would reach Nicaragua by the end
of this week.
   ``In our camps in Yamales there are few weapons and few
combatants left,'' Sovalbarro said referring to an area 125 miles
southwest of Tegucigalpa that had been used by an estimated 12,000
rebels in their nine-year war against Nicaragua's Sandinista
government.
   He said ``only about 3,000 war-wounded and their families remain
in the camps'' in Yamales, which became home to the bulk of the
rebel force after U.S. military aid to the Contras ended in 1988.
   U.N. forces of about 200 were gathering in Managua and
Tegucigalpa to monitor Nicaragua's transition from a decade-old
leftist revolutionary government to the conservative United
National Opposition.
   In an accord with representatives of Nicaraguan President-elect
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, Sovalbarro agreed the rebels in
Honduran camps would disband and hand over their weapons by April
20, five days before the new administration takes over from the
Sandinista's.
   Rebels in Nicaragua are to gather in U.N.-supervised security
zones under the accord but there is no deadline for their
demobilization.
   But Sovalbarro, 29, said Thursday most rebels returned to
Nicaragua without waiting to hand in their guns to U.N. forces. The
Contra leader, known as Commander Ruben, signed the agreement March
23 with the incoming government.
   ``We want to turn in our rifles in Nicaragua, because if there
is going to be democracy in our country, then we will exchange our
weapons for the plow to cultivate the land,'' Sovalbarro said.
   It was unclear whether the rebels' rank-and-file would honor the
accord.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Ambassador Chris Arcos praised Honduran
President Rafael Leonardo Callejas for his role in persuading the
rebels to leave Honduras.
   ``The Contras have been dissolved ... and Callejas resolved that
problem,'' Arcos said.
   Callejas sponsored the negotiations, in which Nicaraguan
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, archbishop of Managua, also
participated. They followed the Sandinistas' loss in elections Feb.
25 to Mrs. Chamorro's U.S.-backed coalition.
   An estimated 80,000 Hondurans were displaced by the rebels,
including 20,000 coffee producers. They were forced to move to the
interior of the country or traveled illegally to the United States
or Mexico to find work.

   Iraq's drive to eclipse Israel as the
Middle East's paramount military power is gathering momentum, and
its alleged attempt to acquire trigger devices for nuclear weapons
underlines that the regional arms race has reached a new stage.
   Most analysts believe Iraq is still years away from producing a
nuclear weapon. But, coupled with development of long-range
missiles and chemical weapons, Iraqi efforts to acquire the trigger
devices have raised concern that its nuclear program may be more
advanced than anyone thought.
   The sophisticated devices are believed to be available only to a
few major powers.
   The State Department called in Iraq's ambassador in Washington,
Mohamed Al-Mashat, on Thursday and registered ``deep concern'' that
Iraq is trying to circumvent U.S. restrictions on nuclear
technology shipments. The department also reportedly reiterated
U.S. opposition to the spread of missile technology in the Middle
East.
   The arrest of three people in London on Wednesday on accusations
they were trying to smuggle the triggers to Iraq was among the
latest in a chain of indicators that Iraq is capable of developing
high-technology weapons.
   In December, Iraq surprised other nations by launching a rocket
it said could be used to put a satellite into space. It also claims
to have developed missiles with a range of 750 miles.
   Both incidents demonstrated the advances the Iraqis have made.
   The New York Times reported today that Iraq for the first time
is building missile launchers within range of Israel and the Syrian
capital of Damascus. The newspaper, quoting unidenfied U.S.
intelligence officials, said they believed the missiles in western
Iraq are intended to discourage possible Israeli attack on Iraqi
nuclear or chemical weapons facilities.
   Western intelligence sources said the rocket launch was less
successful than at first believed. They said the rocket flew for
just over two minutes, reaching an altitude of 12{ miles before
plunging back to earth.
   Nonetheless, some analysts believed it put Iraq on the threshold
of ballistic missile capability.
   Richard Murphy, former U.S. assistant secretary of state and a
Middle East expert, told a conference on Iraq in London this month
that Iraq's missile program has made ``extraordinary progress.''
   He noted: ``This progress generally carries an ominous overtone
and not just in the United States. Its genuine scientific
achievements are clouded by associated reports of Iraqi progress in
chemical weapons and biological warfare research.''
   Iraq has achieved this despite the efforts of the United States
and the six industrialized nations to halt the flow of sensitive
technology to stem the proliferation of missiles.
   There is some evidence the Missile Technology Control Regime is
having some effect. But Murphy noted: ``The problem is getting out
of the control, if it hasn't already, of the superpowers. It's
difficult to attract Middle Eastern countries into the regime.''
   The superpowers' influence in restricting access to missile
technology has been undercut by the emergence of sophisticated arms
industries in Latin America, Asia and the Middle East.
   China has supplied weapons to Iran and Iraq, but says it has
stopped doing so. Iran, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Libya are also
developing or believed to be developing missiles.
   Israel, faced with the erosion of its technological superiority,
now has the nuclear-capable Jericho-1 weapon, with an estimated
range of up to 370 miles.
   It recently tested an advanced version, Jericho-II, with a
reputed range of more than 1,000 miles, enough to hit targets
anywhere in the region and even reach the Soviet Union.
   Iraqi officials deny Baghdad is seeking to build nuclear
weapons. But the rapid strides it has made in military technology,
along with President Saddam Hussein's regional ambitions and the
lack of a formal peace treaty with Iran, have caused widespread
concern.
   ``Iraq is being unnecessarily grandiose in its military
preparations,'' Simon Henderson, editor of the London-based Mideast
Markets newsletter, told the London conference.
   ``Western officials consider the amount it spends on defense to
be totally out of proportion to that necessary to meet any threat
of renewed hostilities with Iran.
   ``Instead, they foresee that by the end of the decade, Iraq will
have the largest arsenal in the region of unconventional weapons _
principally medium-range missiles with sophisticated warheads,
including chemical and nuclear weapons.''
   In December, Mideast Markets reported that Iraq was trying to
build a nuclear bomb with Chinese help.
   The newsletter said the Chinese had provided Baghdad with
components for high-speed centrifuges that produce the highly
enriched uranium needed for nuclear weapons.
   It said it could be 10 years before Iraq would be capable of
testing such a weapon. But Israeli officials have said Iraq is
probably much closer than that.
   Israeli warplanes bombed a French-built nuclear reactor near
Baghdad in June 1981, alleging the Iraqis were developing nuclear
weapons.
   Some analysts believe Baghdad's effort to get its hands on
nuclear triggers indicates it is well down the road to nuclear
weapon capability.
   But Don Kerr, a military specialist with the London-based
International Institute for Strategic Studies, said in a telephone
interview that he believed Iraq's nuclear program ``is still
essentially in the theoretical stage because of the problems of
getting hold of weapons-grade material.''
   He said Iraq's bid to acquire nuclear triggers was ``an attempt
to take a short cut through the design and development process.''
   At present, Israel is believed to be the only nuclear power in
the Middle East.
   Israel denies that. But nuclear technician Mordechai Vanunu,
imprisoned for revealing Israel's nuclear secrets to a London
newspaper, said Israel has at least 100 nuclear weapons.
   The minister in charge of Iraq's rapidly expanding military
industries, Gen. Hussein Kamel, was quoted by a Persian Gulf
newspaper last year as saying Iraq was negotiating with the French
to rebuild the bombed reactor ``for peaceful purposes.''
   The French, Iraq's second-biggest arms supplier after the Soviet
Union, denied that.
   However, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia said last year his country
was ready to help the Iraqis rebuild the reactor.
   The Soviets, too, have been closely associated with Iraq's
nuclear program and in 1984 agreed to provide $2 billion in credit
to help build two nuclear power stations.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers have approved a new way to
finance and run Kentucky's public schools, abolishing a system the
state Supreme Court said shortchanged poor districts and dragged
down test scores.
   The House voted 58-42 Thursday to approve the overhaul _ which
includes a $1.26 billion tax increase and decentralization of
control over day-to-day operation of the 570,000-student system _
and sent it to Gov. Wallace Wilkinson. The Senate passed the
measure 30-8 on Wednesday.
   The governor has hailed the plan as ``history in the making.''
   ``It's the first time that any state has scrapped its existing
system and started over again,'' said Frank Newman, president of
the Education Commission of the States, a federally supported
research organization.
   Courts in 10 states have overturned education funding systems
since 1970 because of disparities in money available for rich and
poor districts. But education experts said last year's ruling in
Kentucky was perhaps the most sweeping.
   The court declared the entire school system unconstitutional
because its quality varied so greatly between rich and poor
districts. The court also found that Kentucky students were
performing in the lowest quarter nationally on standardized tests.
   Student performance ``is fraught with inequalities and
inequities throughout the 178 local school districts,'' Chief
Justice Robert Stephens wrote.
   The Legislature responded by repealing and replacing all
Kentucky laws on elementary and secondary education. The 900-page
legislation would mean more money for schools in general and
dramatically more money for poor districts. About half the money
from the tax increase would be spent on schools.
   ``We're going to do innovative things in Kentucky for once,''
said Rep. Greg Stumbo, the Democratic majority floor leader.
``We're not going to be a follower anymore. We're going to be a
leader.''
   As in many states, school spending in Kentucky is based
primarily on local property taxes and varies according to property
values. Under the current system, spending ranges from $1,800 to
$4,200 a year per student, depending on the district.
   Under the new plan, the minimum property tax would increase, and
the state would establish a minimum spending level of $2,900 per
student in the 1990-91 school year, making up the difference if a
district could not raise enough money.
   Overall state financing for elementary and secondary education
would increase from $1.5 billion this year to $1.9 billion next
year.
   The state Education Department's role would be overhauled.
Districts would gain control over curriculum and other day-to-day
operations, while the state would manage a system of rewards _
including cash _ for employees of schools that improve each year.
   Under the bill, the state also can quickly take over school
systems that fail to measure up. The bill doesn't spell out how the
state would measure progress.
   The plan also calls for a large-scale investment in technology,
emphasis on early childhood education and extra help for potential
dropouts.
   Control of the system also would be shifted from an elected
state superintendent to an appointed education commissioner.
   Rep. Roger Noe, chairman of the House Education Committee, said
he considered the bill second only to Brown vs. Board of Education
in the making of education law. The 1954 U.S. Supreme Court
decision outlawed school segregation.
   Lawmakers in Texas also are considering education finance reform
after that state's top court rejected the state's funding mechanism.
   Other states where courts overturned school finance systems,
according to a study last year by Robert Berne, associate dean of
New York University's Graduate School of Public Administration, are
New Jersey, Kansas, Wisconsin, California, Connecticut, Washington,
West Virginia, Wyoming, Arkansas and Montana.

<TEXT>
   A tale of intrique _ complete with
double agents, a self-styled American spy and even Imelda Marcos _
has clouded prospects for successful talks on the future of U.S.
military bases here.
   The flap began last week when the Department of Justice released
the text of testimony by Brig. Gen. Alejandro Galido, who the
government claims infiltrated elements of the military who tried to
overthrow President Corazon Aquino in December.
   In his testimony, Galido said he was approached in April by a
man claiming to be a U.S. Air Force colonel, who offered to sell
weapons to the rebels for $20 million.
   According to Galido, the alleged colonel said he was a member of
the Defense Intelligence Agency and supported moves to topple Mrs.
Aquino.
   Galido also claimed Mrs. Marcos, who is on trial in New York on
racketeering charges, was aware of the conspiracy but was unable to
finance the arms because of ``money problems.''
   U.S. officials have repeatedly declared support for Mrs. Aquino.
During the coup attempt, U.S. jets flew air cover in support of
government forces.
   But many Filipinos, always suspicious of the country that ruled
the archipelago from 1898 until 1946, believed Washington supported
the conspirators, then double-crossed them to make Mrs. Aquino
beholden to the United States.
   Galido never indicated whether the deal was consummated, nor
whether he believed the purported American spy, whom he identified
as Harold Maglio, actually worked for the U.S. government.
   On Thursday, the majority leader of the Philippine Senate
demanded that the United States ``clear the air'' about Maglio. The
senator, Teofisto Guingona, said Maglio produced a picture that he
alleged was taken of Maglio upon his arrival at Manila's airport
last year.
   The U.S. Embassy denied that Maglio was on its staff or involved
in Philippine affairs. It is unclear how much the embassy knows
about him because U.S. privacy laws limit disclosures of
information about private citizens without their consent.
   The DIA also said Maglio doesn't work for the U.S. agency.
   An official of the Mandarin Hotel said a guest who registered as
Harold Maglio checked in April 30 and left after two days. The
official said the man gave his address as Wrightwood, Calif.
   The Associated Press in Manila telephoned Maglio in Wrightwood
today, but he hung up after saying: ``I'm not talking to
reporters.''
   The disclosures have produced banner headlines in Manila
newspapers about American duplicity.
   ``It's not difficult to imagine that the military right-wingers
in the U.S. government have been encouraging and supporting
right-wing coup plots while the State Department...has been
assuring Mrs. Aquino that the U.S. government had nothing to do
with rebel forces,'' wrote columnist Alvin Capino in the Philippine
Daily Globe.
   Opponents of the U.S. bases, have seized on Galido's allegations
to urge Mrs. Aquino to forgo talks on extending the lease on the
six installations, which expires in 1991.
   Bases talks are expected to begin next month, and Mrs. Aquino
has given no indication she will cancel them.
   Any agreement must be approved by two-thirds of the 23-member
Senate. Sentiment against the military posts, already sharpened
after cutbacks in promised U.S. aid, has hardened with the Galido
allegations.
   ``How can we have exploratory talks this coming April unless the
U.S. clears the air?'' Sen. Guingona asked. ``How do we continue
the abiding friendship unless suspicions of inordinate intervention
remain?''

<HEAD>Engineer: Cooperating in Nuclear Sting the Right Thing to Do</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of a U.S. defense contractor says
he cooperated with a sting that averted shipment of 40 nuclear
detonators to Iraq because he feared nuclear weapons in the hands
of ``irresponsible'' countries.
   The sting came as part of an 18-month investigation by U.S. and
British customs agents that culminated in a federal indictment
against five people and two British companies.
   Jerold Kowalsky, an engineer and president of CSI Technologies
Inc., said he alerted U.S. agents in 1988 to inquiries from alleged
representatives of Iraq into his company, which makes electronic
triggers to military specifications.
   He said Thursday that the possibility of the devices falling
into the hands of the Iraqi government disturbed him.
   ``I had no qualms in cooperating with the government from the
beginning,'' Kowalsky said. ``I felt like I was doing the right
thing and I would hope anybody in my shoes would have done the same
thing.''
   Iraqi officials deny their government is seeking to develop a
nuclear arsenal.
   Two of the five people named as defendants in the Feb. 23
indictment, unsealed Thursday in San Diego, were arrested Wednesday
in London. The three others, believed to be in Iraq, were
identified as engineers for Al-Qaqaa State Establishment, a weapons
development unit of Iraq's Ministry of Industry and Military
Industrialization, U.S. Customs officials said.
   The indictment alleges that Euromac (London) Ltd, and Atlas
Equipment (U.K.) Ltd. acted on behalf of the Iraqi government to
illegally obtain the devices.
   Customs officials said Euromac was an official purchasing office
of the Iraqi government and had done millions of dollars in
business in procuring materials for the Iraqi government at the
height of its war with Iran.
   CSI Technologies is a U.S. defense contractor. Kowalsky said he
felt obliged to cooperate in the investigation.
   ``We can't afford to have nuclear weapons in the hands of
countries that are irresponsible,'' he said.
   Among those charged in the indictment were Ali Daghir,
identified by British authorities as the leader of the alleged
smuggling operation, and Jeanine Speckman, a French woman released
on bond Thursday.
   Daghir was identified in the indictment as managing director of
the two companies, which allegedly acted as agents for Al-Qaqaa.
   Speckman was named in the indictment as an export executive for
Euromac and secretary of Atlas Equipment. The indictment alleges
that she suggested the triggers be shipped in boxes labeled as
components for air conditioning in computer rooms.
   Customs officials said it was unlikely the three Iraqi engineers
will ever be arrested. The indictment identifies them as Karim
Dhaidas Omran, Dafir Al-Azawi and Wallid Issa Ahmad.
   The indictment charges that a conspiracy began in September
1988, when the two British companies allegedly contacted a London
representative of CSI Technologies about obtaining the detonators.
   Kowalsky said his 21-year-old, 35-employee company makes
electrical components for use in heart defibrillators, lasers and
various transmitters and also has manufactured large quantities of
capacitors for use in scientific research in Iraq.
   He said he received a telex from his London representative in
late 1988 that said the Iraqis inquired about CSI Technologies
manufacturing capacitors to military specifications. They also
asked if the devices could endure severe shock.
   ``Within a couple of minutes of seeing the telex, my blood
turned cold,'' Kowalsky said. ``I told myself, `These guys are
building a nuclear bomb' and I immediately called the CIA and
Customs Service.''
   Customs agent Daniel Supnick, posing as a CSI executive, joined
negotiations last fall with Daghir and Speckman, the indictment
said.
   The indictment charged that the defendants did not seek export
licenses as required by U.S. law after ordering the detonators from
CSI Technologies. The company is based in San Marcos, Calif., about
40 miles north of San Diego.
   The defendants also are charged with money laundering, arising
from the transfer of $10,400 from Britain to CSI's account with the
Bank of America in Escondido, Calif., to pay for the detonators.
   U.S. Attorney William Braniff in San Diego said Speckman and
Daghir would be prosecuted in Britain first before they could be
extradited to the United States to face charges.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange today dropped
more than 1,000 points in a market dominated by profit-taking and
discouragement, while the dollar surged against the yen.
   The market's key index, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, lost 1,045.71 points, or 3.37 percent, in the market's
seventh largest single-day decline. It ended the week at 29,981.45.
   The Nikkei fell 237.41 points Thursday.
   Securities dealers said prices fell on selling across the board
due to a decline in the value of the yen against the dollar and an
overnight fall on Wall Street.
   Brokerages remained on the sidelines because ``they knew that if
they bought, they'd only be battered by heavy selling,'' said
Yoshihiro Ito, general manager of stock trading at Okasan
Securities.
   Wide expectations of a further weakening of the yen also sapped
buying interest, said Shin Tokoi, deputy general manager of stock
trading at County NatWest Securities.
   Volume was a relatively light 500 million shares.
   In currency dealings, the dollar rebounded to close at 157.65
yen, up 1.00 yen from Thursday's close of 156.65 yen. After opening
at 156.80 yen, the currency ranged between 156.75 yen and 157.95
yen.
   It surged sharply higher at midday under what some dealers
described as suspicious circumstances.
   Numerous dealers, Japanese and foreign, said a sudden rise to
almost 158 yen smacked of collusion among the small number of banks
involved in fixing the year-end rate, which was set at 158 yen. The
banks involved appeared to have bid the dollar up to lock in
windfall profits, they said.
   An official at the Bank of Japan said the central bank was
considering investigating inquiries about the dollar's sudden rise.
The year-end rate is used by many firms as a benchmark exchange
rate.
   The dollar has been advancing against the yen for several weeks
as Japanese corporations bought the currency, amid general
pessimism about the yen, to help improve their balance sheets at
the close of their fiscal year.
   On Thursday, the yen made a brief recovery in Tokyo after
rebounding in New York Wednesday following intervention by the U.S.
Federal Reserve.
   But most dealers saw the recovery as temporary. They said strong
demand for dollars due to an outflow of capital from Japan is the
single largest factor pushing the dollar's value higher against the
yen.
   ``The demand for the dollar is very big,'' said a dealer at a
long-term credit bank.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bond fell to
85.95 points as of 3 p.m., down from Thursday's close of 86.72, as
banks sold off bond holdings. The yield rose to 7.36 percent from
the previous day's close of 7.2 percent.

both to cable and syndicated television.
   The drama, about a Shakespeare-quoting subterranean brute and
his love interest with a prosecutor, will make its debut on cable's

   The package will feature three never-seen original episodes.
   The 56-episode package featuring Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton

   The show already has been sold into syndication to stations in
New York, Dallas, Miami, Chicago, Boston, Houston, Philadelphia,

   Teen-agers caught speeding in this western
New Mexico city can put the brakes on paying a ticket if they put a
special bumper sticker on their car.
   Stickers that say, ``If I'm Driving Irresponsibly, Call My
Parents,'' are part of a Municipal Court program started last month.
   ``It could be a deterrent to poor driving,'' Municipal Court
Judge Russell Muffley said. ``Children could say they don't want
one of those bumper stickers, so they'll drive a little more
carefully. We're just trying to get teen-agers to slow down a
little bit.''
   The stickers stay on for 60 days. With the sticker alternative,
citations are deferred.
   ``We're doing this with the blessings of the parents. If the
parents have reservations and don't want this on the car for one
reason or another, we won't do it,'' Muffley said. ``So far the
response has been very good.
   ``I've had one parent who didn't want it on the car. But the
rest have said, `Put it on there.' They are concerned.''
   Muffley said judges Texas and elsewhere in New Mexico have
called him for information about the program.

<HEAD>JAMA Publishing Earlier to Get Jump on New England Journal of
Medicine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even though the nation's most widely circulated
medical journal is leap-frogging its New England-based rival to
publish earlier in the week, the rival's editor pooh-poohed any
threat to his publication.
   ``We're more academic. We publish the great majority of the
scientific advances in medical research,'' said Dr. Arnold Relman,
editor of the New England Journal of Medicine. ``We have always
done that, and I believe we will continue to do so.''
   Relman's Boston-based journal publishes on Thursdays. The
Chicago-based Journal of the American Medical Association, which
published on Fridays, will change its release date to Wednesdays
next week.
   ``Improved production capabilities and the desire to publish
important research findings as quickly as possible'' are the two
top reasons for the change, JAMA says. It also wants to give news
reporters more time at week's end to develop spinoff stories.
   But ``if you read the (AMA) press release carefully, they want
to come out first,'' before the New England Journal of Medicine,
Relman said Wednesday.
   ``I can't understand any other reason, beyond the obvious
competitive one,'' he added in a telephone interview.
   Dr. George Lundberg, JAMA's editor, acknowledged in a news
release announcing the change last month, ``I want JAMA to be
poised to be able to publish new research findings before other
medical and scientific journals.''
   But Lundberg maintained on Thursday that competition is a lesser
motive.
   Articles that appear each week in the New England journal and in
JAMA are independent of each other, though they do cover
overlapping subjects sometimes, Lundberg said.
   In such instances, ``we would prefer our authors to have an
earlier publication date than theirs,'' he said.
   ``We at JAMA value media coverage greatly because one of our
basic missions is to educate the public to lead healthier lives.''
   Mark Bricklin, editor of Prevention magazine, said JAMA ``is
more like the USA Today of medical journals. It's not as arcane. If
there's an article in JAMA, it's apt to have a much greater
application to the practicing physician.''
   Both journals are heavily covered by the media, and their
release dates have more to do with determining when their contents
reach airwaves and newspapers than when they reach physicians.
   JAMA, published by the nation's largest organization of doctors,
has a regular English-language circulation of 293,000, including
the AMA's more than 290,000 members. The journal also has 290,000
copies going overseas each week in 12 languages, Lundberg said.
   The 178-year-old New England journal, the nation's oldest
medical journal, is published by the Massachusetts Medical Society.
It has a circulation of about 230,000, including 10,000 society
members and about 50,000 overseas subscribers, Relman said.
   Statistics support Relman's claim to greater prestige, according
to the Philadelphia-based Institute for Scientific Information,
which tracks how many times articles in 3,200 journals are
subsequently cited in published research.
   ``In 1988, out of these 3,200 journals (the institute tracks
worldwide), the New England journal ranked seventh,'' said editor
David Pendlebury.
   He said the six top finishers were non-medical journals, adding,
``The British (medical) journal Lancet ranked 17th, the Annals of
Internal Medicine ranked 39th and JAMA was 86th.''
   The New England journal also carries the ``hottest'' articles,
Pendlebury said Thursday. A study about a year ago indicated that
the 100 most-cited articles in life sciences in the previous year
included nine from the New England journal and three from JAMA.
   ``We don't feel threatened by a change in their publication
day,'' Relman said. ``It seems to me that the content of what is
published is vastly more important than the day of the week on
which it is published.''
   Dr. Aran Ron, assistant to the medical director at Beth Israel
Medical Center in New York City, and a reader of both journals,
agreed, though for different reasons.
   ``I think that JAMA has more general interest-type articles and
covers ground a little wider, while the the New England journal has
more scientific, specialty and in-depth articles,'' Ron said. ``I
don't perceive a big competition.''

<HEAD>Israel Approves $31.2 Billion Budget Amid Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Parliament approved this year's budget
today and tripled funding for religious parties, which have held
the balance of power since the government fell after a
no-confidence vote earlier this month.
   One legislator called Israel's leaders ``thieves in the night,''
for earmarking $110 million of the $31.2 billion budget for
religious insitutions.
   The funding was put forward by the right-wing Likud bloc headed
by Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir. Shimon Peres' center-left Labor
Party backed the move.
   Both parties need the backing of the small ultra-Orthodox
factions to break the 60-60 parliamentary tie that arose after the
no-confidence motion. Shamir is caretaker prime minister while
Peres tries to form a government.
   Both Likud and Labor have wooed religious parties with offers of
political jobs and funds for religious seminaries.
   The amount allocated to religious institutions in the 1990-91
fiscal year budget almost tripled last year's funding of $37.5
million.
   The budget was approved 40-10, with eight abstentions, after a
heated debate that stretched more than 40 hours. The remaining 62
legislators did not show up to vote.
   The deadline for passage of the budget was Saturday.
   Likud and Labor also joined forces to push through $2.5 million
for party-affiliated institutions and $10 million was added to the
budget for Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
   Before the budget debate, Haim Oron of the socialist Mapam Party
criticized the moves by major parties to woo the religious factions.
   ``The expression `theives in the night' is not slander, it is
not a bad term for the Parliament. It is a minimal description in
polite words of what is going on,'' he said.
   Likud Justice Minister Dan Meridor said the budget suffered
because of the political crisis.
   ``This budget has things that perhaps in an ordinary period
could have been refrained from. We couldn't refrain from them all
today,'' he said on Israel radio.
   But Yair Levy, a legislator of the six-seat ultra-Orthodox Shas
party, was encouraged: ``Today we can say we have started the
process of reducing the gaps between ultra-Orthodox education and
regular schooling,'' he said on Israel radio.
   Israelis protested the higher funding for insitutions belonging
to ultra-Orthodox Jews.
   Labor Party supporters, dressed in ultra-Orthodox fashion, with
black hats and side curls, demonstrated outside Labor headquarters
in Tel Aviv. They called on party leaders to stop bowing to
religious parties, Israel radio reported.
   Peres has five more weeks to put together a colation and he said
he will push for early elections for the 120-member Parliament if
he fails, rather than give Likud an opportunity to establish a
government.
   The coalition negotiations began after Shamir was toppled by a
no- confidence motion in Parliament over his refusal to accept
U.S.-backed Middle East peace proposals, which were supported by
Labor.

   A severed pig's head wrapped

   The Citizen newspaper said the incident took place Thursday
night in the town of Boksburg outside Johannesburg. Independent
councilman Issy Kramer, the target of the attack, expressed shock
over the incident, the report said.
   Boksburg has attracted international attention because it is
controlled by the pro-apartheid opposition Conservative Party. The
Boksburg council has been fighting to keep strict apartheid despite
opposition by the governing National Party.
   Jewish leaders have expressed concern about a recent wave of
anti-Semitic incidents in South Africa that they have blamed on
neo-Nazi groups.

<HEAD>Hillary Warns Against Ecological Destruction of Himalayas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sir Edmund Hillary, who with his Sherpa
guide was the first to reach the top of the world's highest
mountain, today warned the majestic Himalayas were threatened by
deforestation and litterbug trekkers.
   Recalling the remote valleys and foothills he traveled before
his 1953 ascent to the top of Mount Everest, the 70-year-old New
Zealander said: ``In 1951, the people lived a simple, hardy
existence. Few of them had ever seem a railroad train or a bus.
Tourism was unknown.
   ``Nowadays, tens of thousands are walking the hills tracks,
floating down the rivers, landing in tiny airstrips in remote
valleys. ... The living standards (of the Himalayan people) are
increasing, but the beautiful tracks and valleys have been littered
and the forests destroyed.''
   He spoke at the opening session of the First International
Conference on Environmental Protection of the Himalayas.
   The two-day conference is sponsored by the Himalayan Adventure
Trust, which Hillary helped found two years ago, and by the Indian
Mountaineering Foundation.
   Hillary, who reached the top of Mount Everest in Nepal on May
29, 1953, with Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay, said tourism in the
Himalayas must be spread more thinly and visitors must take their
trash with them when they leave.
   ``Tourist agents must be pressured to make sure their customers
leave the hills and valleys beautiful,'' he said.
   He said huge population increases have sent more farmers into
the Himalayas in search of survival. ``The local people are forced
higher and higher to cut trees and make terraces for their crops.
When will it ever stop?'' he asked.
   Maneka Gandhi, India's minister of state for environment and
forests, warned deforestation and pollution would have disastrous
results reaching far beyond the Himalayan highlands.
   ``Today the Himalayas are crumbling,'' said Mrs. Gandhi, the
sister-in-law of ex-Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. ``The
disappearance of the Himalayas will mean the desertification of
India and neighboring areas. We have to preserve the Himalayas or
we perish.''
   She said the new government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh, whose
Janata Dal coalition ousted Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party in last
November's elections, was considering a $175 million plan ``to
re-green the Himalayas.''

   Snow fell in Denver early today, and the mountains of northern
New Mexico, southeastern Utah and northwestern Arizona were

<HEAD>Leader of Art Deco Preservation Movement Dies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Baer Capitman, a leader in the
art deco preservation movement whose stubbornness and media savvy
helped save hundreds of Miami Beach's historic hotels, has died of
heart failure. She was 69.
   Ms. Capitman, who suffered from diabetes and heart tremors, died
Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center, where she had been a
patient for several days, hospital spokesman Arthur Ehrlich said.
   A diminutive woman with a quavery voice, she used her public
relations know-how and her love of architecture to capitalize on
renewed interest nationwide in art deco buildings.
   Ms. Capitman's outspoken nature may have been the key to her
success, but it made her enemies as well. In 1976 she helped found
the Miami Design Preservation League, which won federal historic
designation for the South Beach district in 1979, but later she was
ousted from the group.
   ``I don't know where it says you have to compromise,'' she told
The Miami Herald in an interview Monday. ``It's been a struggle,
but the struggle isn't over.''
   In 1988, police had to carry her off the steps of the Senator
Hotel when it was demolished to make way for a parking lot. She was
hospitalized that day.
   ``She would push and agitate and cause trouble until half the
people wouldn't speak to her. She was interested in results, not
social sensitivities,'' said Michael Kinerk, a close friend and
chairman of the Art Deco Weekend festival.
   The preservation league had to overcome opposition from the city
manager and chamber of commerce to get the South Beach district
listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It's the only
district with 20th century architecture on the register.
   The historic status brought federal tax breaks to the
economically depressed area, now in the midst of an economic and
cultural renaissance that even Ms. Capitman's harshest critics
credit to the movement she began.
   ``It was a tremendous achievement by one person, one little old
lady,'' her son Andrew said Thursday.
   ``Barbara Capitman deserves her reputation as the indomitable
champion of the art deco treasures of Miami Beach,'' said
billionaire investor Robert Bass, chairman of the National Trust
for Historic Preservation.
   She also helped found chapters of the Art Deco Society in New
York, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
   President of the Art Deco Society of American, she was
organizing the first World Congress on Art Deco when she died. It
was to be held next February during the city's Art Deco Weekend, a
festival that drew 420,000 people this year.
   She also was working on a book about the origin and resurgence
of art deco, titled ``Art Deco U.S.A.'' Her book on the history of
Miami Beach's district, titled ``Deco Delights,'' was published in
1989.
   Art deco, a sleek, elegant style associated with wealth and
sophistication, took hold as the nation entered the Depression.
Radio City Music Hall and the Chrysler building in New York are
some of the best examples of art deco's geometric shapes and
streamlined forms.

<HEAD>Sampling in Soviet Union Finds Anti-Semitic Element</HEAD>

   A recent sampling of Moscow residents shows more
than half of them could be mobilized by anti-Semites, the American
Jewish Committee says.
   Committee President Sholom D. Comay told reporters Thursday the
survey indicates a significant part of the Soviet population openly
dislikes Jews, holds negative stereotypes about them or ``is at
best neutral about Jews and thus open to manipulation.''
   The sampling of 509 adults during February and March found 18
percent indicated they disliked Jews, 65 percent indicated they
were neutral and 18 percent indicated they liked Jews.
   The 65 percent who were neutral about Jews are ``open to
manipulation by enemies of Jews'' and likely ``can be mobilized by
anti-Semites,'' committee research director David Singer said.
   ``History teaches that Jews are secure only when people have
genuinely positive feelings toward them,'' he said. ``It is not
enough that people be non-anti-Semitic.''
   The committee called on President Mikhail Gorbachev and the
Soviet leadership to ``condemn manifestations of anti-Semitism.''
   Of those surveyed, 91 percent said, ``Jews should be free to
decide for themselves whether they want to remain in the Soviet
Union or emigrate.''
   And 90 percent agreed that the ``government should make every
effort to see that the rights of Jews to equal educational
opportunities are respected'' and 88 percent favored equal
employment opportunities for Jews.
   The study was conducted under the auspices of the Institute of
Sociology of the Soviet Academy of Sciences and directed by
political scientists James Gibson and Raymond Duch of the
University of Houston.
   The study, funded by the committee, the National Science
Foundation and the University of Houston, involved questions on 350
items. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage
points.
   Other findings included:
   _Thirty-three percent maintained that ``when it comes to
choosing between people and money, Jews will choose money.''
Twenty-nine percent were uncertain and 38 percent disagreed.
   _Twenty-three percent agreed that ``Jews have too much influence
over Russian culture,'' while 21 percent were uncertain and 56
percent disagreed.
   _Ten percent felt that ``Jews deserved to be punished because
they killed Christ,'' while 15 percent were uncertain, and 75
percent disagreed.
   _Eight percent agreed that Jews, more than any other group,
``are responsible for the problems the Soviet Union is experiencing
today.'' Thirteen percent were uncertain and 79 percent disagreed.
   Concerning views about other people's anti-Semitism, 48 percent
said that ``anti-Jewish feeling is on the rise around here today,''
while 44 percent termed it ``about the same.'' Only 5 percent saw
it diminishing.
   Seventeen percent said ``most people in the Soviet Union are
anti-Jewish,'' 60 percent said ``only some people are anti-Jewish''
and 19 percent said ``very few people are anti-Jewish.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Christian militias today renewed
savage combat in east Beirut and in hills northeast of the city,
ending a nearly monthlong cease-fire. Police said two people were
killed.
   Thunderous blasts reverberated across Beirut and black clouds of
smoke hung over the city and nearby hills as fires burned out of
control.
   Thousands of families huddled in basements and underground
shelters and radios blared hospital appeals for blood donations.
   At least two people were killed and one person wounded in the
clashes, police said.
   The patriarch of the Maronite Church today threatened to
excommunicate both Gen. Michel Aoun and rival Christian warlord
Samir Geagea, whose struggle for domination of Lebanon's Christian
enclave has killed at least 778 people and wounded 2,157 since Jan.
30.
   Police said Aoun's army and Geagea's Lebanese Gorces militia
were locked in combat in the central sector of Christian east
Beirut and in the mountains of Kesrouan province, 20 miles
northeast of the capital.
   ``The cease-fire has collapsed. It's past history,'' said a
police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules. ``It's
all-out war again.''
   The police spokesman said no casualty report could be compiled
yet, ``but there are indications there are plenty of killed and
wounded people.''
   The warring factions accused each other of torpedoing a March 3
cease-fire called by neutral Christian mediators to halt the power
struggle, the most savage intra-Christian fighting in the
15-year-old Lebanese civil war.
   Aoun's army command said that Geagea's Lebanese Forces launched
tank-led thrusts on two fronts at first light to break through army
lines in Beirut's Christian sector and the mountains in Kesrouan
province.
   ``Both assaults were repulsed. The attackers suffered heavy
losses in lives and equipment in east Beirut's Badaro district and
Kesrouan's Kleiat-Dareya axis,'' said a communique from Aoun's
command.
   A Lebanese Forces communique said Aoun's tanks and armored
personnel carriers were mounting charges from east Beirut into the
resort town of Kleiat behind massive artillery bombardment in an
attempt to open the way for his troops to capture Kesrouan.
   ``The Lebanese Forces are preventing Aoun's units from
accomplishing their objectives although they are using phosphorous
and cluster bombs,'' the communique said.
   The militia's chief spokesman, George Abdul-Massih, later told
The Associated Press the Lebanese Forces pushed Aoun's army
``almost completely'' out of Kleiat and were advancing towrds the
nearby town of Dareya.
   Before the outbreak of the new fighting, Aoun's army held a
quarter of Kleiat. The rest was under Lebanese Forces control.
   As the fighting escalated, Aoun's and Geagea's radio stations
canceled their regular programs to broadcast only martial music,
patriotic songs and war communiques.
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of the dominant
Maronite Catholic community of which both Aoun and Geagea are
members, made his excommmunication threat at midmorning from his
seat in Bkirki, which overlooks the Mediterranean. It was his
second since the fighting began.
   ``This horrific, destructive shelling which the army and the
Lebanese Forces blame on each other .... has forced people to flee
their homes and take shelter in forests,'' Sfeir said in the appeal
that was broadcast by Christian radio stations.
   ``How dare they claim they are defending Christian land while
they are turning it into scorched earth?'' Sfeir added.
   Aoun's 19,000 troops and Geagea's 6,000-member militia are
fighting for control of the enclave where Lebanon's estimated 1
million Christians live.
   Aoun has refused to recognize the authority of elected President
Elias Hrawi and has ignored his dismissal as army commander.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are all Maronites, the 900,000-strong
Catholic sect that has dominated government since Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943.
   Hrawi was elected president by Parliament to implement political
reforms designed to give Moslems an equal share of power and end
the civil war.
   That was part of an Arab League-brokered peace treaty endorsed
by Lebanon's parliament in October.
   Aoun rejects that accord because it does not guarantee the
withdrawal of the 40,000-member Syrian force, which he considers an
army of occupation.
   Aoun considers them an army of occupation.

<TEXT>
   Communist rebels apologized today for
killing three children and wounding civilians during attacks on two
buses in the central Philippines.
   The attacks took place Saturday in Bongabon on the eastern coast
of Mindoro island, 130 miles southeast of Manila, according to a
handwritten statement from the Lucio de Guzman Command of the
Communist New People's Army.
   ``We are asking for forgiveness for the killing and wounding of
innocent civilians in a fight that we initiated,'' said the
statement delivered to The Associated Press. ``We are promising
these tragic incidents will not happen again.''
   The statement said the deaths could have been prevented had the
bus drivers refused to carry armed soldiers.
   The New People's Army has been waging a 21-year-old insurgency
to establish a Marxist state in the Philippines.
   The guerrilla group said the children died inside one of the
buses after an officer locked the door, forcing civilians to jump
out the windows. Many of the 18 wounded were caught in the
cross-fire, the statement said.
   In the second ambush, a soldier killed a rebel before the
vehicle sped away, according to the statement.
   The military has said the rebel offensive was to mark the
group's 21st anniversary Thursday. At least 85 people have died in
violence nationwide during the week-old offensive.

<HEAD>3 Bills Stemming From Nation's Worst Drunk Driving Accident Fail
in Kentucky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE SCHREINER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State lawmakers failed to pass three bills
stemming from the nation's worst drunken-driving accident.
   ``It's just a sad day for Kentucky that we can't get them
through,'' said Sen. Virgil Pearman, whose nephew was the church
bus driver killed with 26 other people in the fiery crash.
   The bills _ which would have toughened drunken-driving laws,
added a left-side door to school buses and created a felony crime
of vehicular homicide when a drunken driver caused traffic deaths _
effectively were defeated Thursday.
   Pearman said his advocacy of bills on other major state issues _
local control of solid waste and community health systems _ may
have hurt the highway safety measures.
   ``Maybe I was shoving too much too fast on some hot topics,''
said Pearman, a Democrat.
   The bills cleared the Senate with little or no opposition but
stalled in House committees during the final days of the 1990
legislative session.
   As a result, the legislature passed no bills directly related to
the May 1988 crash. A pickup truck slammed into a church bus on
Interstate 71 near Carrollton in northern Kentucky, killing 24
children and three adults returning from a church outing.
   Larry Mahoney was driving drunk when his pickup, on the wrong
side of the highway, crashed head-on into the bus. Mahoney was
convicted of manslaughter, assault, wanton endangerment and drunken
driving, and was sentenced to 16 years in prison. He is appealing
the case.
   Pearman's nephew, John, 37, was the bus driver. He died trying
to save his passengers. His uncle believed the national attention
given the crash and Mahoney's trial would help the legislation he
backed.
   ``I thought it was possible with all the publicity,'' Pearman
said. ``I'm devastated that the things are all dead.
   ``But that's the way the system works. You never know. I've been
here for 15 years and I've had my ups and downs. This is just one
of the down years.''
   The drunken-driving bill would have made it illegal to drive
with a certain blood-alcohol level. Kentucky is one of just a
handful of states not to have such wording in their drunken-driving
law. Instead, drivers in the state are merely presumed to be drunk
when their blood-alcohol reading reaches .10 percent; critics say
such wording makes it easier for people accused of drunken driving
to avoid convictions.
   Another key section would have allowed the revocation of a
driver's license before the trial of some people charged with DUI.
That section had raised concerns from some Democratic House leaders.
   ``If you lose your driver's license ... and you live in a remote
area of my couty, you don't have a mass transit system to get to
work,'' said House Majority Leader Greg Stumbo.

<HEAD>$510 Million Lawsuit Filed In Wake Of Social Club Fire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An illegal social club served alcohol without a
license to an already-drunk man who is accused of killing 87 people
when he torched the place, a $510 million lawsuit says.
   The lawsuit was filed Thursday as relatives and friends of
victims held funerals and wakes, and as the accused, Julio
Gonzalez, appeared in Bronx Criminal Court for a hearing.
   About 1,000 mourners gathered Thursday night outside Ortiz
Funeral Home in the Bronx for the wakes of six victims of the Happy
Land Social Club fire.
   ``We want justice,'' said Edith Melendez, the girlfriend of Luis
Drummond, who died in the fire Sunday. ``Give him (Gonzalez) to us.
We could take him to the park, pour some gasoline on him like he
did to our family and friends.''
   The suit was filed in Bronx state Supreme Court, New York's
trial-level court, by attorney Harry Lipsig on behalf of Jennie Mae
Danzler, mother of another fire victim, 31-year-old Natalie Danzler.
   The suit names as defendants the social club itself; Clarendon
Place Corp., owner of the premises; Little Peach Realty, lessee;
Alex DiLorenzo III, Jay Weiss and Morris Jaffe, officers of Little
Peach; Elena Colon, widow of club owner Elias Colon, who died in
the fire; and Gonzalez. Weiss is the husband of actress Kathleen
Turner.
   The suit seeks $10 million in compensatory damages and $500
million in punitive damages. It claims, among other things, that
Happy Land served alcohol without a license and served it to
Gonzalez when he already was intoxicated.
   Authorities Thursday continued to crack down on illegal social
clubs, with more than 100 police officers transferred from the
Tactical Narcotics Teams to a reactivated Social Club Task Force.
The force has visited hundreds of social clubs citywide since
Sunday's fire, closing about two dozen and issuing citations.
   Meanwhile, Criminal Court Judge Effrain Alvarado ruled Thursday
at hearing over legal representation of Gonzales that the Legal Aid
Society may continue as his counsel through the grand jury process.
But the judge appointed lawyer Richard Berne to take over the case
after that.
   Security was tight during the hearing. At one point, a man
yelled, ``Julio, I'm going to watch you.'' The man was a friend of
one of the fire victims.
   Gonzalez, a 36-year-old Cuban emigre, was arrested Sunday and
charged with 87 counts of murder through depraved indifference, 87
counts of felony murder, and one count of attempted murder and
arson. He allegedly set the fire after a fight with his
ex-girlfriend, who worked at the club.
   Mayor David Dinkins on Thursday contested a published report
that his director of Latino Affairs, William Nieves, had operated
an illegal social club.
   Dinkins said the establishment, called El Caney, was really a
cultural center. He acknowledged the site had been cited for
building and fire code violations and should have been closed.
   Members of the City Council grilled top city officials about the
fire Thursday during a meeting of the council's Public Safety
Committee.
   They demanded to know why Happy Land was not padlocked after the
city discovered it was operating illegally and unsafely. Fire and
buildings department officials said the law was unclear whether a
building could be padlocked without a hearing.

   The Indian army shot and killed 10 Moslem
separatists trying to slip into Pakistan-held territory today,
sources said.
   In Srinagar, the center of the Moslem movement for secession
from India, a leader of the movement was killed in a clash with
police, authorities said.
   The battle along the India-Pakistan border occurred when
militant Moslems fired on Indian soldiers who had spotted them
trying to cross from the Indian-governed side of Kashmir, official
sources said on condition of anonymity.
   The sources, speaking from Jammu, the winter capital of
Jammu-Kashmir state, said the 12 surviving militants were arrested.
   The clash occurred near Dumari Gali, 45 miles north of Srinagar.
   In Srinagar, a leader of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front was
killed by police as he attempted to throw a hand grenade into a
police bunker, police said. A blast of automatic weapons fire from
the bunker killed Ashfaq Majid Wani, the front's area commander,
police said.
   Three other people died in the gunfire, witnesses and police
said.
   Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Wani
was killed as he drove by the bunker on a motor scooter, preparing
to throw a grenade into the bunker in downtown Srinagar.
   Police said security forces in the bunker spotted him and opened
fire.
   Wani, 28, was a senior official in the Moslem movement for
secession of the northern Kashmir valley from mainly Hindu India.
   At least 231 people have been killed in the valley since Jan.
20, when the government launched a crackdown on the Moslem
separatist movement. On Thursday, police killed at least 15 people
in bursts of automatic weapons fire after a security officer was
killed in a grenade attack.
   Earlier this week, Indian border guards shot and killed two
Pakistani civilians when a crowd of about 100 people in Pakistan,
chanting anti-Indian slogans, tried to storm the frontier that
divides Kashmir into its Indian and Pakistani sections.
   India has accused Moslem Pakistan of causing the trouble in
Kashmir, a region disputed between the two countries. Pakistan
rejects the charge but demands that the people of Kashmir be given
the right of self-determination.
   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over the territory. Both
were won by India. A cease-fire line monitored by the United
Nations divides the valley.
   The separatist movement in Kashmir has been a thorn in India's
side since the end of British rule over the South Asian
subcontinent and the division of Britain's colony into
Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan.

   The place was highbrow, a concert hall at
Lincoln Center, but the crowd was more used to seeing violinist
James Graseck underground.
   Graseck has been entertaining commuters in subways for more than
20 years and used some of the coins tossed his way to throw a
concert Thursday night for his straphanger fans.
   ``Elaine, from the World Trade Center stop! Good to see you,''
Graseck said, hugging one commuter after the classical performance
at Alice Tully Hall.
   He waved to another, saying, ``Bob, I'll see you at the Long
Island Railroad, OK?''
   The hall was sold out by 1,096 people who paid $16 each. They
clapped, hummed along and even shouted ``Ole!'' as Graseck played a
program of Bach, Paganini and Schubert.
   ``I don't like classical music. I just like Jimmy,'' said Joe
Abrams, a transit policeman who knows Graseck from Penn Station and
brought his wife to the concert.
   Graseck, 36, saved $5,000 to rent the hall, partly from money he
earned in subways and trains. With few other expenses for the
concert and the sellout crowd Thursday, he stands to make a profit,
he said.
   ``It is a dream come true in a way,'' he said before his
performance.
   Graseck grinned throughout the show and at one juncture pointed
to a group seated near the stage. ``From the Flushing (Queens)
line, right?'' he asked.
   He ended with a dozen encores, classical excerpts running just
three to five minutes each _ about the time one has to wait for a
train.
   ``I learned these playing you-know-where,'' Graseck told the
audience.
   He is a classically trained violinist who studied at Juilliard.
   Graseck's initial mass transit performance came in 1968 on a
Long Island Railroad car headed for Brentwood, Graseck said. He
made $10 in five minutes, and a star was born.
   ``At first I did it just for the money,'' he confessed. ``But
the applause, the smiles, made me feel as though I was reaching the
hearts of people. It's very spontaneous, very communicative.''
   These days, a subway performer can make about $100 a day, said
Graseck, who also does free-lance orchestra work.
   His favorite platform is at 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue,
where concertgoer John Welch met him.
   ``I was amazed at his talent,'' Welch said. ``People miss their
trains sometimes, listening to him.''
   Tim Frost, who also attended the concert, said commuting is more
than just commuting with Graseck around.
   ``Culture isn't just going to Lincoln Center,'' Frost said.
``It's also hearing him at the top of the escalator every Friday
morning when I get off the No. 7 train in Grand Central.''
   Lillian Binder said she's not the only one in her office to
appreciate the violinist.
   ``One time I was late to work and told my boss, I'm sorry, I was
listening to this guy in the subway play `Scheherazade,''' she
said. ``My boss said, `I know that guy. He's great.'''

<HEAD>East German Party Leader Examines His Secret Police Files</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with leader of Social Democrats
examining files kep on him by former secret police. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of one of East Germany's top
political parties got a first-hand look today at files kept on him
by the despised secret police, knowing his career hangs in the
balance by what is revealed.
   Ibrahim Boehme, chairman of the left-leaning Social Democratic
Party and one of the country's most charismatic politicians, has
been wrestling with allegations that he was an informer for the
now-disbanded secret police.
   The Social Democrats, who placed second in East Germany's March
18 elections, are in crucial negotiations with the winning
conservative coalition about forming a ``grand coalition''
government.
   Boehme has denied allegations he had links to the Stasi secret
police.
   He temporarily stepped down from the party chairman post last
week, saying he wanted his name cleared. He demanded access to the
records kept on him.
   Today, accompanied by two lawyers, Boehme entered the sprawling
former secret police building in East Berlin to view the files.
   Wolfgang Schlauer, a member of a citizens committee controlling
disbandment of the secret police, told reporters it could take
several hours before Boehme reads through material compiled on him.
   Meanwhile, committees of the Social Democrats and the winning
Christian Democratic Union met separately to discuss a possible
coalition and organization of East Germany's first freely elected
government.
   The process of forming the government has been overshadowed by
allegations that many members of the new 400-member parliament
worked with the Stasi.
   Among them is Lothar de Maiziere, the Christian Democratic
chairman, who has also denied any links with the secret police.
   Despite the allegations, de Maiziere has said he hopes the new
Parliament can convene next week.
   Outgoing Parliament Speaker Guenther Maleuda on Thursday also
said he wants the Parliament to convene quickly to stabilize the
drifting nation.
   Maleuda met with newly elected members of Parliament and
recommended that the body hold its first session on April 5, the
state news agency ADN said.
   The lawmakers elected in East Germany's first free elections
March 18 have been bogged down in talks on forming a governing
coalition that will determine the pace for unification with West
Germany.
   But ADN said Maleuda, who leads the lame-duck Parliament that
contains vestiges of the old Communist regime, wants new lawmakers
to meet soon to give the nation some stability and leadership.
   After hard-line Communist leader Erich Honecker was toppled Oct.
18 during massive nationwide demonstrations, the country has been
run by a reform-minded interim government dominated by the
Communists, who have little public support.
   Meanwhile, the two leading political factions of the new
leadership said Thursday that they agreed on the basic points of
forming a majority coalition.
   De Maiziere is trying to form a government with the Social
Democrats.
   The groups said in a joint statement that they ``concurred on
most basic points,'' and that their differences ``are negotiable.''
   A coalition with the Social Democrats would give de Maziere the
two-thirds majority he needs to control Parliament and muscle
through his proposal for swift unification with wealthy West
Germany.
   But the Social Democrats have expressed concern about whether
they can work with the more conservative members of de Maiziere's
three-party alliance.
   The Social Democrats also favor a more gradual process for
unification than the conservatives.
   ``We are of the opinion that the situation we must negotiate,
and the responsibility we have, is so serious, that we must each
discuss it with our governing bodies,'' de Maiziere told reporters.

<HEAD>Franciscans Close Probe Into Sex Allegations Against Ritter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Franciscan religious order concluded an
inquiry into allegations of sexual impropriety against the Rev.
Bruce Ritter, and announced no results except a request that the
founder of Covenant House live in a friary.
   ``It was a private investigation,'' the Rev. Juniper Alwell, a
Franciscan provincial council official, said Thursday. ``The
results are private. ... That's as far as we're going to go.''
   Alwell said the Roman Catholic order conducted its investigation
with no help from outside professionals and did not intend to act
like a prosecutor. But the Franciscans will cooperate with civil
authorities looking into other questions raised recently about a
Covenant House charitable trust, the council said in a statement.
   Ritter, 62, resigned Feb. 27 as director of Covenant House, the
shelter for runaway youths he founded and built into an $85
million-a-year international operation. The council said his
resignation came ``with the prior knowledge and urging of his
superiors.''
   Four young men, runaways whom Ritter befriended, have been
quoted as saying they had sex with him.
   The New York Times today quoted an anonymous church official as
saying he expected Ritter to ask to leave the Franciscan order,
although he might remain a priest. The order did not plan to give
Ritter an assignment or ministry, the official said.
   In its statement, the Franciscan council said it decided Ritter
should return to daily living with his Franciscan community.
   Ritter, who has not lived in a religious community for more than
20 years, will meet with church officials before they determine
where he will go, Alwell said.
   Asked where Ritter was now, Alwell said: ``He did exactly what
we asked him to do, which was to rest and recuperate as much as
possible, remove himself from the media.''
   District Attorney Robert Morgenthau has said he had found
insufficient evidence of financial misconduct to charge Ritter with
any crime. But Morgenthau said some ``questionable financial
transactions'' had been made in connection with expenditures for
Kevin Kite, a former male prostitute who alleged that Ritter had
sex with him.
   Morgenthau also said the law may have been violated when
Covenant House supplied Kite with a false identity using papers of
a dead 10-year-old.

   Thousands of Slovaks gathered
today outside the regional Parliament in Bratislava to protest the
new name of the nation, the state news agency CTK reported.
   Some protesters called for a separate Slovak state, CTK said.
   The name ``Czechoslovak Federative Republic'' was adopted
Thursday night after a daylong discussion in the federal Parliament
and weeks of growing tensions between the Czechs and Slovaks.
   Deputies from the Czech lands favored the name Czechoslovak
Federative Republic, while Slovak deputies wanted a hyphen in
``Czecho-Slovak Republic,'' to underline the equal status of the
two constituent republics.
   A compromise was finally reached, allowing the Slovaks to
hyphenate the country's title in writing as ``Czecho-Slovak
Federative Republic.''
   The protesters who gathered outside the Slovak Parliament in the
southern city of Bratislava expressed their discontent with the
compromise solution and called for the declaration of a sovereign
Slovak state, CTK reported.
   It said the Slovak parliamentary chairman, Rudolf Schuster, and
Deputy Jan Zelenay assured the protesters that their
representatives had sought to settle the problem, which has
dominated internal politics in recent weeks.
   Protesters read a petition to the Slovak regional parliament
calling on the legislature to begin negotiations with the national
parliament on the full recognition of Slovak sovereignty and
autonomy, CTK reported.
   The petition claimed that the government does not recognize the
existence of Slovakia, one of the country's two constituent
republics. About one-third of the country's 15.5 million people are
Slovaks.
   The country wanted to change its name, the Socialist Republic of
Czechoslovakia, to eliminate the ``Socialist'' label.
   The term seemed outmoded following the popular uprising last
year that ousted hard-line Communists and installed a non-Communist
government.

   Johnny Neun, a former major-league manager and
one of only nine players to execute an unassisted triple play, died
Wednesday of pancreatic cancer. He was 89.
   Neun spent four years with the Detroit Tigers and ended his
major-league career with the Boston Braves in 1931, compiling a
lifetime .289 batting average.
   He executed his game-ending triple play on May 31, 1927, in
Detroit when he was playing first base for the Tigers in a game
against the Cleveland Indians.
   Detroit held a one-run lead in the top of the ninth when the
first two Cleveland batters _ Glen Myatt and Charley Jamieson _
reached base. Homer Summa was at bat.
   ``Then, he (Summa) hit a line drive straight at me, and I caught
it for the first out,'' Neun said in an interview with The Sun in
1964.
   ``Jamieson had started from first to second and was right in
front of me, so I tagged him. Two out.
   ``I looked over and saw that Myatt was racing for third,
apparently thinking Summa had got a hit. I ran over and touched
second base, and the game was over,'' Neun said.
   Neun later managed in the New York Yankees farm system for 12
years, took over as Yankees manager temporarily in 1946 and managed
the Cincinnati Reds in 1947 and 1948.
   He returned to the Yankees and spent 35 years with the
organization, becoming a scout and player-development specialist.
He also scouted for the Milwaukee Brewers until last year.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany today said
a treaty confirming Poland's current borders should coincide with
acknowledgment by Poland that it mistreated Germans who came under
its rule after World War II.
   Kohl was asked at a news conference to amplify on a speech he
made to an Anglo-German group in Cambridge Thursday night, in which
he urged Poland to follow Czechoslovakia's example and recognize
``the injustice'' of expelling millions of Germans.
   In his reply, Kohl suggested that such a declaration should be
made when a unified Germany signs a treaty enshrining the existing
Oder-Neisse line as the legal and final German-Polish border.
   ``There is the question of recognition of the Oder-Neisse
border, to anchor it in a treaty of a unified Germany with
Poland,'' he said. ``That is a historic moment and I think it is
very good thing if at such a moment one can actually find a word of
reconciliation.''
   He reiterated that he was not demanding an apology. He did not
specify whether such a declaration should be oral or in the form of
a document.
   Kohl's comments were seen in West Germany as a new effort to
keep the German exiles and their offspring on his side in national
elections Dec. 2. About 13 million Germans were expelled from
prewar German territories that now are part of Poland and
Czechoslovakia.
   In Warsaw, government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said
today that Nazi atrocities far outweighed those committed by Poles
after the war, but she wanted to hear exactly what Kohl said before
commenting further.
   She stressed at a news conference that Poles have spoken
repeatedly of reconciliation. She referred to a historic 1965
letter from Polish bishops to West German church leaders which said
the Poles forgave and asked forgiveness.
   ``We think we have made so many statements on this issue that
it's clear,'' she said.
   Kohl recalled that Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel already
has expressed remorse over the postwar expulsion of the Germans
from his country.
   ``If between Germans and Poles we could find similar words, and
we could talk to each other like that, then this is a real peace,
and this is what I hope for,'' he said.
   The German leader was clearly aware of the sensitivity of such
remarks, given Nazi atrocities in Poland during the war. On
Thursday he departed from his prepared text to tone it down so as
not to accuse Poland directly of mistreating the Germans.
   In the speech, he also stressed he was not making any demand for
a Polish apology, just a recognition of ``the injustice that was
also inflicted on innocent Germans.''
   ``We Germans are not entitled to such words, and even less must
we try to balance accounts in one way or another,'' he said.
   Earlier this year, Kohl had angered Poles and worried officials
in other European countries by refusing to guarantee that a unified
Germany would respect Poland's existing borders. Kohl made a
forthright pledge last month that Germany would not seek to change
the borders.
   One-third of Poland was German territory before the war, and
Warsaw has demanded both German states promise to honor Poland's
borders before uniting.
   Kohl and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher spoke at Cambridge
University for the 40th anniversary of the Koenigswinter
Conference, set up to foster Anglo-German relations five years
after the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945.

   As his self-imposed Saturday deadline
approached, Gov. Cecil Andrus expressed reservations about some
provisions of what would become the nation's most restrictive state
abortion law.
   But he said his concern will not necessarily translate into the
veto abortion rights activists have been demanding under threats of
economic retaliation.
   ``My views being pro-life haven't changed,'' he said Thursday.
``But I am concerned about the bill. I am concerned that this bill
may narrow it to the point where a woman who has suffered rape, who
has suffered incest or the mother's life is in danger might not be
able to receive an abortion. ...
   ``I'm agonizing over it.''
   Another 1,000 abortion rights advocates held their ninth
straight candlelight vigil on the steps of the Capitol Thursday
night, continuing to press their case for a veto.
   Earlier in the day a smaller group dumped 10,000 potatoes on the
Statehouse steps to show their support for the boycott if the bill
becomes law.
   State lawmakers were expected to adjourn the 1990 session about
midday today. If Andrus decided to veto the bill and waited until
after the adjournment to do so, the Legislature would not have the
chance to even consider an override.
   Chances for an override, which would take two-thirds majorities
in each house, would be slim in any event. When the bill was
passed, opponents had seven more votes than needed to block an
override in the House and two more than necessary in the Senate.
   Anti-abortion forces tried to counter a potato boycott by
pledging to buy even more Idaho products in what the Concerned
Women for America said was a commitment ``to this cause out of
respect for the courageous men and women in the Idaho Legislature.''
   But with some Idaho businessmen reporting order cancellations
because of the abortion vote, the state Commerce Department was
developing contingency plans to cope with whatever decision Andrus
makes on the bill.
   It makes abortion illegal except in cases of non-statutory rape
reported within seven days, incest if the victim is under 18,
severe fetal deformity and a threat to the life or physical health
of the woman. If signed, it will take effect July 1.
   Some legal scholars have said it is so restrictive it will be
voided by the U.S. Supreme Court. But the National Right to Life
Committee helped draft the bill so that a promised court challenge
will give the high court the opportunity to reverse its 1973
decision legalizing abortion.
   Andrus has been consulting with legal scholars, church officials
and other experts, but he said there was no consensus on the issue.
   Brian Johnston of the National Right to Life Committee said the
governor expressed doubts on Thursday because ``the only people he
had spoken with are those who actually oppose this bill.''
   An aide said that later in the day the governor spoke with David
Smolin of Samford University in Alabama. Smolin is the
constitutional scholar anti-abortion advocates have relied on to
counter the constitutional questions.
   Despite prospects of economic retaliation, Commerce Director
James Hawkins remained confident the state, finally in the midst of
an economic resurgence after suffering through harsh times during
most of the 1980s, would weather any assault.
   ``We do have political issues in this state, but I don't know
about any political streams or political potatoes,'' Hawkins said.
``What I'm worried about is people being divided. We need to bring
them back together.''

   A rapist who won acquittal in a
Florida trial when the jury thought the victim had ``asked for it''
was convicted of attempted rape in Georgia, where he already is
serving a life sentence in another case.
   A Gwinnett County jury deliberated 25 minutes Thursday before
convicting Steven Lamar Lord, 26, of Lawrenceville of attempted
rape, aggravated assault, robbery and false imprisonment.
   He was charged with attacking a 20-year-old woman who had
stopped at a gas station to use a pay telephone.
   Lord was acquitted of rape in Fort Lauderdale last year in a
case that led to pickets and protests over the jury foreman's
published comment that the victim had ``asked for it'' by wearing a
lace miniskirt and no underwear. The juror later said he was quoted
out of context.
   Gwinnett Superior Court Judge James A. Henderson sentenced Lord
to 50 years in prison to be served after his life term. Lord
pleaded guilty to raping a woman in DeKalb County in 1988 when she
stopped to use an automatic teller machine.

   South Africa released seven black
nationalists from prison today, including the nephew of African
National Congress leader Walter Sisulu.
   The releases raised to 42 the number of political prisoners
freed from Robben Island prison since the end of an 11-day hunger
strike there in early March.
   The strike ended after a meeting between lawyers of the 346
hunger strikers and government officials. The details of their
agreement have never been made public, but the pace of releases has
increased since the meeting.
   The ANC, the leading black anti-apartheid group, has demanded
the release of all prisoners convicted of politically motivated
crimes as a condition for its participation in formal negotiations
on a new constitution.
   The prisoners freed today included five members of the ANC and
two members of the Black Consciousness Movement.
   Among the prisoners released was Jomguzi Sisulu, 31, who was
sentenced in May 1986 to five years for treason. The father of two
small children said he was shocked when authorities told him
Thursday he would be freed the next day.
   ``I couldn't believe it, it was so unexpected,'' he said.
   Sisulu's uncle, Walter, was freed from the same prison in
October after serving 25 years of a life term for plotting sabotage
to end white rule.
   President F.W. de Klerk will hold talks April 11 with top ANC
leaders, including Nelson Mandela, to work out a framework for
constitutional talks.

   Spinal injury patients treated with a new
drug recovered significantly more function than untreated patients
in a clinical trial, a federal agency reported today.
   The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke said
that in a clinical trial of 487 patients with acute spinal cord
injury, those treated with the drug methylprednisolone within eight
hours of the injury recovered more motor and sensory function than
those treated with other drugs or with a placebo.
   The study, started in 1977, was conducted at 10 U.S. medical
centers.
   The report said that 162 patients were treated with
methylprednisolone. Another 154 patients received naloxone and 171
patients received placebos.
   Motor and sensory functions were assessed on admission and again
six weeks after treatment and finally six months after injury.
   The report said patients received methylprednisolone ``showed
significant improvement in both muscle function and pin and touch
sensation at six weeks and six months after injury,'' the
announcement said.
   The drug must be given within eight hours of injury to be
effective, the study said.
   The announcement said that the dose of methylprednisolone is
critical and the successful dose was 30 milligrams for each
kilogram of patient weight followed by an infusion of 5.4
milligrams per kilogram of weight per hour for 23 hours.
   Lower doses of the medication were found not to be effective.
   About 10,000 Americans each year suffer spinal cord injury with
paralysis and the direct cost to the federal government for medical
treatment for these injuries exceeds $4 billion annually.

<TEXT>
   ``The Cosby Show'' will return for a
seventh season after NBC executives and producers of the hit series
reached a deal described as the costliest renewal in TV history.
   NBC and producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner signed a one-year
contract calling for 26 new episodes in the 1990-91 season, the
network said Thursday.
   NBC refused to provide financial details of the contract, but
the Los Angeles Times today cited unidentified sources as saying
the deal was worth about $50 million, or roughly $2 million an
episode.
   The producers initially sought a license fee of $3 million per
episode, the Times said.
   The deal was signed amid widespread reports Carsey and Werner
wanted an unprecedented signing bonus of up to $100 million.
   ``There is no bonus,'' said NBC spokesman Curt Block. ``This is
a standard agreement. We're not discussing what went on in the
negotiations.''
   Since contract talks began in December, the producers reportedly
came under pressure from peers to drop the bonus demands because of
fears it would further strain relations with the networks, the
Times said.
   ``Everybody's happy,'' said Cosby's agent, Norman Brokaw, who is
chief executive of the William Morris Agency. ``The deal has been
finalized. Bill Cosby was not prepared to go somewhere else.''
   Carsey-Werner Co., which also produces ABC's popular
``Roseanne,'' packs considerable clout with the networks. In last
week's Nielsen ratings, three of the top five shows were
Carsey-Werner productions.
   It also produces the highly rated ``Cosby'' spinoff ``A
Different World'' on NBC, and the network's new series ``Grand,''
which made its debut to mixed reviews in the winter.
   The single-year contract left in doubt whether the enormously
popular program would extend its run beyond the 90-91 season. The
show was No. 1 in last week's Nielsens.
   ``The Cosby Show,'' starring Bill Cosby as New York obstetrician
Cliff Huxtable, was instrumental in NBC's jump from last to first
place among the three major networks.
   Syndicated episodes have earned more than $500 million for
Carsey-Werner.

<HEAD>Sources Say Rabta Chemical Plant Not As Damaged As Previously
Thought</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Libyan chemical factory at Rabta which
caught fire two weeks ago was not damaged as extensively as first
believed, administration sources say.
   ``There is far less damage there than we first thought,'' an
administration source said Thursday, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   U.S. officials have charged that the plant was producing poison
gas, but the Libyans said it was making medicine.
   After reports of the fire became known, U.S. officials said
damage to the plant appeared to have been extensive, and White
House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the plant was ``out of
business.''
   The administration source declined to specify how the
information had been obtained. U.S. intelligence agencies have
relied on satellite photographs for such information in the past.
   Nor did the source offer an estimate on how long it would take
to repair the plant and get it back into production. Before the
fire, U.S. officials said it appeared that the plant, after a long
period of little production, had begun turning out limited
quantities of mustard and nerve gases.
   The plant, about 60 miles southwest of Tripoli, caught fire on
March 14.
   The Libyan ambassador to Italy said last week that the fire had
caused great damage and that it had been set by a worker at the
plant. The ambassador told reporters several people had been
arrested and that the person responsible would be executed.
   Last week a French company said photographs taken by the
European Spot I satellite showed that the plant was not heavily
damaged by the fire.
   The photograph showed some black traces on buildings apparently
used for storage about 800 yards from the main plant.
   ``The principal structures of the Libyan chemical factory at
Rabta don't seem to have been touched,'' Christian Barnard, a
spokesman for Spot Image, said last week.
   Libya has accused the United States, Israel and West Germany of
being behind the burning of the plant. All three countries have
denied it.

<HEAD>Guatemala to Negotiate Peace with Rebels</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Representatives of Guatemala's guerrilla
alliance met with a government-approved commission today and signed
an agreement to open negotiations toward ending the nation's
28-year-old civil war.
   The accord said the guerrillas and the commission agreed to ask
the United Nations to monitor the peace process and act as a
``guarantor of the fulfillment of the agreements and commitments.''
   The head of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity rebel
alliance, Luis Becker Guzman, said the guerrillas had offered a
cease-fire during the Easter holiday as part of the agreement.
   He said the government-approved National Reconciliation
Commission said it would forward the offer to Guatemala's
government and army.
   The agreement also calls for a second round of talks,
tentatively scheduled for late May, between the rebels and
Guatemala's political parties.
   The delegations also agreed to direct talks among the rebels,
the Guatemalan army and the government but gave no date.
   The accord said negotiations would be held ``with the aim of
achieving a political solution to the internal armed conflict.''
   The three-day talks in Oslo were sponsored by the World Lutheran
Federation. The talks were the third meeting between the leftist
rebels and government representatives since a civilian government
came to power in Guatemala in 1986 and promised to end the civil
fighting.
   Talks broke off almost immediately when guerrillas met
government officials in Madrid in 1986, and peace talks broke down
last year in Costa Rica.
   Government representative Jorge Serrano Elias said today's talks
were successful because of a strong national concensus to end the
civil fighting that has left an estimated 100,000 people dead.
   ``Never before in my country has there been such a consensus of
wills to support a process of negotiation and dialogue,'' he said.
   Norway's Foreign Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, who attended the
signing ceremony called the agreement ``a commendable willingness
to compromise.''
   Guatemalan National Revoluntionary Unity is an umbrella movement
including three guerrilla groups: the Rebel Armed Forces, Guerrilla
Army of the Poor and the Organization of the People in Arms. U.S.
estimates put the movement's fighting force at 1,500.

<TEXT>
   The Duke and Duchess of York have named their
week-old daughter Princess Eugenie Victoria Helena, Buckingham
Palace said today.
   The baby's name was announced shortly after the royal couple
stepped from Portland Hospital with the new princess, wrapped in a
white blanket.
   The baby slept quietly through the cheers of the crowd and the
click of hundreds of cameras.
   Princess Eugenie is the sixth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II
and sixth in the line of succession. She is the second daughter
born to the duchess and her husband, Prince Andrew.
   The 30-year-old Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, gave
birth to Princess Eugenie by Caesarian section on March 23.
   The baby's name surprised Britain. Bookmakers William Hill said
they had thousands of bets but not one for Eugenie.
   It was the name of Queen Victoria's granddaughter, the daughter
of Princess Beatrice who was Victoria's fifth daughter and youngest
child. The baby's second name _ Victoria _ comes from Queen
Victoria herself, and the third name, Helena, comes from the third
daughter of Queen Victoria.
   Eugenie is the French derivative of the ancient Greek word
``Eugenia'' meaning ``nobility'' and ``excellence,'' and was made
fashionable in 19th- century France by the Empress Eugenie, wife of
Emperor Napoleon III, said David Williamson, co-editor of Debrett's
Peerage, a leading reference book on the aristocracy.
   In its classical form of Eugenia, it was first recorded as a
name in England in the 12th century, he said.
   Prince Andrew's elder brother Prince Charles, 41, is first in
line to the throne, followed by Charles' sons, Prince William and
Prince Harry. Then comes Andrew, 30, then Beatrice.
   The queen's unmarried youngest son, Edward, 26, is now seventh
in line of succession. Her 39-year-old daughter Anne, the Princess
Royal, is eighth and has a son and daughter, Peter and Zara, who
are ninth and 10th.

<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development's inspector general is investigating three no-bid
contracts awarded to close friends by the embattled director of a
new agency that controls millions of dollars in housing money.
   Inspector General Paul A. Adams, in a preliminary report to
Secretary Jack Kemp, said the contracts may have been issued in
violation of government regulations, a HUD source, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said Thursday night.
   Adams today declined to discuss any preliminary findings but
said he hoped to make a final report to Kemp next week. Adams said
he began the investigation of the Federal Housing Finance Board
contracting procedures on Monday at Kemp's request and has received
full cooperation from the agency.
   Kemp raised questions about the contracts during a lengthy
meeting Thursday with Mary K. Bush, the housing secretary's
handpicked choice to head the new agency. The meeting was arranged
after behind-the-scenes effort by Kemp aides to exert influence
over the independent agency became public.
   Ms. Bush has asked Peter Wallison, a former Reagan
administration attorney now in private practice, to represent her
during the investigation, according to her spokesman. She is not
related to President Bush. Attempts to reach Ms. Bush and Wallison
today were unsuccessful; both were reported to be out of town.
   Joseph Slye, the spokesman for the housing board, confirmed that
Adams had visited the agency earlier this week and taken several
contract files. He said Ms. Bush had asked the board's own
inspector general to look into the contracts after HUD officials
raised questions about them last week.
   Ms. Bush awarded the three consulting contracts in question to
three close friends with whom she had worked in the Reagan
administration.
   The recipients included Wendell Gunn, Kemp's former chief of
staff at HUD, and Margery Waxman, who in 1988 represented Charles
Keating in his then-successful effort to persuade regulators not to
seize a troubled California savings and loan he owned, Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.
   Both Slye and HUD sources refused to provide details of Kemp's
meeting with Ms. Bush. Also unclear was whether Adams got involved
in the investigation at Kemp's request, as suggested by the HUD
source, or at the request of the finance board's own inspector
general.
   The board oversees the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks,
which must give up $400 million of their profits each year to help
pay for the bailout of the savings and loan industry.
   Congress also directed the regional banks to put a percentage of
their profits each year into affordable housing programs, starting
with $78 million this year and rising to $100 million.
   Control of those subsidies, and the new agency's plum patronage
jobs, was the prize in the effort by Kemp aides to gain
considerable influence over the Housing Finance Board.
   Kemp recruited Ms. Bush last year and promised to name her the
panel's chairwoman. She agreed to take the title of managing
director until her appointment was made and she was confirmed by
the Senate.
   Ms. Bush never received the appointment, however, leaving the
agency under the control of Kemp, who as housing secretary is the
only permanent board member.
   Kemp and aides publicly blamed the delay on the bureaucracy and
on a debate with Congress over whether the board members should be
full time or part time, as HUD aides want.
   As recently as a week ago Kemp restated his support for Ms. Bush.
   But HUD sources and an internal memo obtained by The Associated
Press and department sources provided evidence that an effort to
oust Ms. Bush began some time ago after she reportedly balked at
some of the department's ideas for the agency.
   The memo, written seven weeks ago by HUD Undersecretary Alfred
A. DelliBovi, ended with an account of the plans of a Housing
Finance Board consultant to end his work there.
   ``If he goes let's hope he takes Mary,'' was its final statement.
   Ms. Bush left a vice presidency at the Federal National Mortgage
Association to take the Housing Finance Board job. She worked at
the Treasury Department during the Reagan administration.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. didn't breach its contract
with the United Auto Workers union by closing an automobile plant
in Pontiac, Mich., an arbitrator has ruled.
   Arbitrator Thomas Roberts of Los Angeles accepted GM's argument
that the shutdown of the Fiero plant was permitted by the contract.
   Thursday's ruling is the latest in a series of setbacks for the
UAW and the approximately 1,700 GM employees who were laid off when
the plant closed in August 1988 after a sharp sales decline in the
two-seat sports car.
   ``The corporation is pleased, obviously,'' GM spokesman John
Maciarz said today. ``It was our position that the idling of the
Fiero plant and subsequent layoff of employees of that facility
were caused by volume-related market decreases in demand.''
   The ruling could raise tensions between the union and the
automaker as they prepare for contract negotiations next summer.
   UAW officials have said they would press to close loopholes in
the contract's plant-closing prohibition.
   ``The decision provides a clear imperative to improve the job
security provisions'' in the new contract, said Stephen Yokich, UAW
vice president and head of union's GM department.

<BYLINE>By DON BEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riccardo Muti, who kept the Philadelphia
Orchestra in the international limelight during a decade as music
director, has decided to quit after the 1991-92 season.
   Muti shocked the orchestra Thursday with the announcement that
he will not renew his contract when it expires in 1992. He said his
devotion to music has left him too little time for a personal life.
   Muti, 48, will continue as music director at the opera house La
Scala in Milan, Italy, and have the title of laureate conductor in
Philadelphia. He will maintain a relationship with the Philadelphia
Orchestra through recording contracts and as guest conductor.
   ``It was very hard for me to say what I said,'' Muti said. ``But
I have felt the last year under great pressure and stress.''
   He said a career on two continents has left him little time for
his personal life and he simply wants more time to ``think and to
read _ to have a life.''
   ``It reached a point where I felt it was time for me ... to take
care of myself. I have sometimes felt like a man without air,'' he
said.
   Muti's decision caught the orchestra by surprise, said Theodore
A. Burtis, president of the Philadelphia Orchestra Association.
   ``We are all in shock, but we do understand,'' Burtis said.
   The director said he decided to announce his decision now,
rather than wait two years, to give the orchestra time to search
for a replacement.
   Muti succeeded Eugene Ormandy, who in 44 years took the
orchestra to international prominence. Under Muti, the Philadelphia
Orchestra continued that legacy.
   Since he took over as music director in 1980, the orchestra's
subscription concerts have been sold out every year, and tours have
taken the musicians around the world. The orchestra also
commissioned new works, resumed opera performances and expanded its
recording contracts.
   Muti's first role as as a principal conductor and music director
came in 1969 with the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence,
Italy, where he served for 11 years. In 1972, he succeeded Otto
Klemperer as principal conductor of the Philharmonia Orchestra of
London.

<HEAD>Simpson Urges Republican Colleagues Not to Reject Rostenkowski
Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The deputy Republican leader in the Senate
urged colleagues today not to reject out of hand a
deficit-reduction plan by Rep. Dan Rostenkowski that would raise
taxes and freeze most government spending.
   ``Those who stand ready to rip apart and ridicule this proposal
must be prepared to offer a thoughtful substitute,'' Sen. Alan
Simpson of Wyoming wrote in The Washington Post.
   Simpson wrote that Rostenkowski, D-Ill., who chairs the House
Ways and Means Committee, ``has dared to speak the unspeakable:
that our monstrous deficit can be eliminated only with some real
discomfort _ for every one of us.''
   For that reason, the senator added, ``every element of his plan
_ and core of any serious deficit-reduction plan _ is going to be
political quicksand to various members of Congress.''
   While not endorsing all parts of Rostenkowski's plan, Simpson
said, ``we should all endorse and admire the spirit in which it was
made and contribute some spirit and energy of our own .... It's
flashier to chop a plan to shreds than to create a new one.''
   Rostenkowski's plan would eliminate the federal deficit by 1993
by cutting the defense budget more deeply than the Bush
amdinistration prefers; freezing most federal programs, including
Social Security benefits, for a year; eliminating for one year the
automatic inflation adjustments in the income tax; raising income
taxes on the richest 600,000 Americans, and boosting taxes on
gasoline, cigarettes, beer and wine.
   President Bush has said the proposal deserves consideration. But
he said he has not changed his opposition to increasing taxes.

<TEXT>
   A man who killed a young woman in a drunken
driving accident eight years ago was ordered jailed for failing to
abide by an agreement to pay $1 a week to the victim's parents for
18 years.
   However, Fairfax County Circuit Court Judge Jack B. Stevens
suspended the sentence Thursday to allow Kevin Tunell a chance to
appeal.
   Tunell, then 17, killed Susan Herzog on New Year's morning 1982
while he was driving under the influence.
   A settlement of a civil lawsuit required him to send a $1 check
every Friday because Friday was the night Miss Herzog died. The
agreement required that checks be mailed each week for 18 years, as
many years as she lived.
   Patricia and Louis Herzog went back to Fairfax County Circuit
Court on Thursday, arguing that Tunell, now 26, was in contempt
because he had failed to make the required weekly payments since
March 1989.
   ``We just wanted a remembrance or a reminder,'' said Mrs.
Herzog. ``We felt like if he did this for 18 years, he wouldn't
forget Susan Herzog. To make a long story short, he kept
forgetting.''
   Tunell broke into tears on the stand, telling Stevens he was not
trying to hurt the Herzogs. Tunell said he is constantly haunted by
Susan Herzog's death and tormented by the weekly payments.
   ``I just don't feel good. It hurts,'' he said.
   Tunell was convicted in juvenile court of manslaughter and
drunken driving, and agreed to make the $1 payments to settle a
$1.5 million lawsuit filed by the Herzogs. At $1 a week, the
payments for 18 years amount to $936.
   Tunell's criminal sentence on the manslaughter conviction was to
spend a year speaking to groups about the evils of drunken driving.
He completed that sentence, he said, and then spent the next six
years continuing to speak to groups across the country and made two
videos on the subject.
   Despite those efforts, Tunell testified, he has remained haunted
by a vision of Susan Herzog. ``I used to, like, lie in bed and if I
heard the house settling or noises I used to think Susan was going
to come visit me,'' he said.
   From the stand Thursday, he offered the Herzogs two boxes of
checks that he had pre-written up until 2001 _ a year more than
what was required by the agreement.
   The Herzogs shook their heads. It was the principle, they
argued. Although Tunell as of Thursday was up to date on his bill _
the Herzogs had received an envelope of 47 checks of $1 each _ they
would accept only weekly payments.
   ``What we want is to receive that check every week on time,''
Mrs. Herzog said. ``He must understand we are going to pursue this
until August of the year 2000. We will go back to court every month
if we have to.''

   Heavily reinforced army and police units broke
up several anti-Israeli demonstrations today as Palestinians and
Israeli Arabs staged rallies and protest marches to commemorate a
bloody 1976 demonstration.
   A general strike closed shops and schools throughout the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab east Jerusalem and Arab
villages in Israel.
   The protests and strikes marked the 1976 ``Land Day'' riots
protesting Israel's confiscation of Arab land in the Galilee. Six
Arabs were killed by Israeli police during the disturbances 14
years ago.
   In a rare clash with Arabs inside Israel, one policeman was
stabbed while arresting stone throwers in the town of Taibeh, and
six other police were injured by stones, Israel radio said.
   Police used tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, and at least
five Arabs were taken into custody, reporters said.
   About 10,000 Israeli Arabs attended the main rally in Arraba,
the village where two Land Day protesters were killed in 1976. A
police helicopter hovered briefly over the crowd, but no police
were deployed on the ground.
   Israeli media reported extra precautions by both police and the
army because the protest day fell on the first Friday of the Moslem
holy month of Ramadan, a day when anti-Israeli riots are common.
   Before the four-hour rally, two people were injured when about
100 followers of the nationalist extremist ``Sons of the Village''
waving Palestinian flags battled a group of Communists with sticks.
   Protest marches also were held in several towns in the occupied
West Bank.
   In the Israeli Arab town of Kafr Kanna north of Nazareth,
Parliament member Abdul Wahab Daroushe read a communique from PLO
leader Yasser Arafat to several thousand Arabs attending an annual
memorial service for a local teen-ager killed in the 1976 clashes.
   Arafat's message, sent by facsimile from Europe, praised Israeli
Arabs ``for igniting the first spark in 1976, which led to the
great fire of the uprising.''
   It also praised Israelis who support negotiations with
Palestinians as ``heroic, democratic Jews willing to make the peace
of the courageous, the brave.''
   In the West Bank, Jewish settlers set up blue-and-white Israeli
flags to emphasize their demand that Israel not give up the land
captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The commercial strike in the occupied territories was called by
the underground leadership of the uprising and the Islamic
fundamentalist Hamas, or Zeal, movement. A solidarity strike was
called by Arab leaders in Israel.
   On Thursday night, army troops fatally wounded 17-year-old
Mohammed Rahman Salama during a raid on the village of Kafr Malik,
12 miles north of the West Bank town of Ramallah. Officials at
Mukassed Hospital in Jerusalem said Salama had been shot in the
chest.
   The army confirmed the death and said troops opened fire on
masked men inciting villagers to violence.
   He was the 670th Palestinians killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians in the 27-month-old uprising against Israel's occupation
of the territories.
   At least 201 other Palestinians have been killed by fellow
Arabs, most after being accused of collaborating with Israeli
authorities. Forty-three Israelis also have been slain in the
revolt.
   In a bid to prevent violence on Land Day, the army declared a
curfew on all 700,000 residents of the occupied Gaza Strip and four
West Bank towns or villages. About 1 million Palestinians live in
the West Bank.
   One Palestinian youth was wounded in the Gaza Strip's Nusseirat
refugee camp when he defied the curfew and ignored soldiers' orders
to halt, the army said.
   Security was especially tight in Jerusalem, where thousands of
Moslems often come on Fridays during Ramadan to pray at the Al Aqsa
Mosque, one of the holiest sites of Islam.
   Soldiers set up roadblocks on roads leading into the city and
were blocking Palestinian youths from entering.
   Israeli Arabs comprise the people who stayed within Israel's
boundaries when the state was founded in 1948 and number about
810,000. Palestinians are Arabs who fled Israel or were driven out
in 1948.

<TEXT>
   Legislation declaring the third Monday in
January an official state holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
won final legislative approval today.
   Senate passage of the bill establishing the Martin Luther King
Jr.-Idaho Human Rights Day removed Idaho from the dwindling list of
states still refusing to honor the slain civil rights leader with
an official holiday.
   The bill, clearing the Senate on a 28-11 vote, now goes to Gov.
Cecil Andrus, who called for its passage in his State of the State
address to open the session last January.
   ``We've come a long way down the road,'' said Sen. Mary Lou
Reed, a Democrat, citing the past four years since the state
designated the third Monday in January as a commemorative day for
King.
   Only three other states are now without King holidays _ Montana,
New Hampshire and Arizona.
   The Idaho measure, however, faced a somewhat rocky road in a
Legislature that has passed some of the toughest anti-racism laws
in the nation, including a criminal malicious harassment law and
mandatory hate-crime reporting.
   After winning initial Senate passage, it was sidetracked in the
House until a compromise was agreed to on the formal name. The
agreement added Idaho Human Rights Day to the designation.
   The holiday was pushed by lawmakers and the governor in part to
offset the negative image the state has developed because of the
presence of white supremacists at the Aryan Nations compound of
Richard Butler in northern Idaho.
   But now with the new holiday and the laws enacted in past
sessions, Mrs. Reed said, ``We have the finest package of human
rights legislation in the nation.
   ``Richard Butler and his small band is just a pitiful bunch,''
she said. ``The Aryan Nations people are now moving into the states
of Wyoming and Montana.''
   The major opposition focused on the potential cost of another
day off for government workers, estimated anywhere between $100,000
and $2 million depending on whether payroll is considered, and
King's radical political background.
   Andrus said, however, that ``more than a holiday to honor one
man, it will be a day to honor all like him, who believe that no
person can truly be free when even one other person is denied
liberty.''

   A medical helicopter most likely
collided with a bird, scattering metal and fiberglass fragments on
a street where youths were playing, authorities said today.
   No one was injured in the incident at 5 p.m. Thursday in this
Pittsburgh suburb and the helicopter returned safely to its base at
Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh.
   Fred Peterson, the hospital's head of trauma and emergency
services, said something _ probably a bird _ hit the helicopter,
shattering a 2-by-4-foot section of cowling that covers the engine.
   About a dozen metal and fiberglass fragments of the cowling
showered down on the youths. Michael Rosenberger, 17, said he was
playing street hockey with five others when the fragments came down
``pretty fast.''
   ``It's a miracle none of us were hit,'' he said.
   One fragment, measuring about a foot by 1{ feet, within a foot
of his 9-year-old brother and another playmate, Rosenberger said.
   The 2-year-old helicopter, one of three Allegheny General uses,
was taken out of service for inspection, Peterson said. It was
heading to a hospital in Washington, Pa., to pick up a patient, he
said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and Mount Lebanon police are
investigating the incident.

   Judges today acquitted a mental patient
of murder in the death of a 9-year-old girl he stabbed 34 times at
a street fair after escaping from a hospital.
   The three-member panel of Superior Court judges said David R.
Peterson was innocent by reason of insanity. They returned him to
Whiting Forensic Institute, the state's maximum-security
psychiatric hospital.
   Peterson, 38, used the insanity plea in the stabbing of Jessica
Short of Wallingford. He attacked her at random at a downtown
sidewalk sale after walking away from Connecticut Valley Hospital
last July 28.
   The state sought a murder conviction, arguing that Peterson
planned the attack, showing he knew what he was doing.
   Peterson is a chronic paranoid schizophrenic with a history of
mental illness and violence dating to his youth. He has spent 15 of
his past 20 years in mental institutions. In 1971 and again in
1988, he was found innocent by reason of insanity in stabbing
attacks and ordered committed to state hospitals.
   About two hours before he killed the girl, Peterson had been
screaming over the medication he was receiving for pain in his legs
and arms, according to testimony. He wanted doctors to change the
medication.
   A psychiatrist hired by the defense said Peterson should have
been confined to his ward after the outburst because he had a
history of psychotic delusions accompanied by violence.
   Instead, Peterson was allowed to follow his normal routine,
including going outside on the hospital grounds without
supervision. He took a bus downtown, bought a hunting knife and
attacked the girl. Bystanders and police pulled him away as he was
stabbing her.
   Peterson told police shortly after the slaying that he killed
the girl as revenge on his doctors. He told psychiatrists he had
pictured himself as a soldier marching into battle.
   Assistant State's Attorney Timothy Liston said Peterson used the
battle scenario to resort to defenses that won him acquittal in the
previous stabbings.
   Peterson chose to be tried by the judges instead of a jury.

<HEAD>Elections Set For June in Bulgaria; New Presidency Created</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The ruling Communists and the democratic
opposition today set June dates for the country's first free
elections since World War II and replaced the governing State
Council with a president chosen by Parliament.
   Also today, the government said it suspended payments on
principal for its $10 billion foreign debt but that it will
continue paying the interest.
   The message to creditors on Thursday called the move a temporary
measure to give breathing room while Bulgaria implements broad
economic reform.
   The Communists and democratic opposition decided to hold
parliamentary elections on June 10th and 17th, the first free
elections in Bulgaria in 45 years, said the government news agency
BTA.
   The two sides also agreed to dismantle the State Council, whose
president is the nation's leader, and create a presidency chosen by
Parliament, BTA said.
   Petar Mladenov, 53, Bulgaria's current Communist president, will
be formally elected to the new post by the current
Communist-dominated Parliament and replaced after the June
elections, the news agency said.
   The State Council had been chosen by Parliament. But, as in
neighboring Romania and other East European countries, the council
ruled in between the infrequent sessions of the countries'
parliaments, which rubber-stamped Communist Party policies.
   It was not immediately clear if the two sides managed to resolve
their disagreement over the makeup of a new Parliament and a draft
electoral law.
   Communist Party chief Alexander Lilov said Tuesday the new
parliament chosen at June's elections should sit for four years
``because we need a strong government at a time when the country is
in crisis,'' Bulgarian state radio reported.
   Zhelyu Zhelev, the head of the Union of Democratic Forces, the
umbrella opposition group, and other opposition leaders want the
new Parliament to serve only as a constituent assembly that sits
for 18 months to pass a new constitution and other democratic laws.
   The government sent a letter to its creditors Thursday,
suspending its debt payments, the Bulgarian Embassy in London said
today.
   ``The government is compelled to temporarily freeze... the
payments,'' said the notification to creditors quoted by the
embassy.
   But the letter added that ``our efforts would continue to
regularly pay the interest due on the credits.''
   The letter said Bulgaria found it impossible to ``carry out the
radical economic and currency reforms in the country and at the
same time pay the full amount of the amounts due on the credits.''
   Bulgaria hasn't fixed a specific date for resumption of
principal payments, said a diplomat at the embassy, who demanded
anonymity.
   Bankers said that the telexed notice, signed by the executive
board of the Bulgarian Foreign Trade Bank, offered to meet with the
banks.
   The notice did not, however, outline a timetable and did not
indicate whether Bulgaria wants to meet with banks individually or
create a bank committee for bilateral discussions.

<TEXT>
   Buffalo's transit agency says it is running
out of money and will suspend bus and subway service for its
120,000 daily riders after Saturday night.
   Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority commissioners voted
8-1 for the suspension Thursday, saying the Erie County
Legislature's rejection of a transit tax gave them no choice.
   ``The community has told us they do not want a transit system,''
Chairman Robert D. Gioia said. ``They do not want to be burdened by
$12 a year. The chamber (of commerce) has told us that is too much
to ask.''
   The tax on public utilities that the county legislature rejected
Wednesday would have cost the average family less than $2 a month.
It was bitterly opposed by the National Fuel natural-gas company
and other business groups.
   Three hours before the commissioners voted, transit authority
executive director Alfred H. Savage said the county legislature's
action had persuaded him to resign at the end of April.
   This morning, the Chicago Transit Authority named Savage its
executive director, giving him a three-year contract with a salary
of $149,500 a year. Savage, who turned 60 on Thursday, had said he
was considering either retiring or accepting the CTA post.
   Savage informed commissioners before the vote that the agency
will have just $89,000 in the bank by Saturday night. Officials
said the shutdown will save up to half a million dollars a week,
but will cost $1.3 million the first week, mostly because of the
final payroll.
   The money will be siphoned from the authority's profitable
Greater Buffalo International Airport operation. Authority
officials have said federal law prohibits them from using airport
revenues as a continuing transit subsidy.
   Buffalo, with a population of more than 350,000, is the state's
second-largest city, but is the smallest U.S. metropolitan area
with a subway, a 5-year-old line. If it abandons the bus and subway
system, it will be the biggest U.S. city without any public transit.
   The crisis occurred when costs rose and federal and state
funding did not keep pace. The state insisted the county enact a
special tax, but county legislators shot down proposals for sales,
property, mortgage and gasoline taxes, as well as the utility tax.
   The county legislature's chairman, Roger Blackwell, said he
would try to get his colleagues to come up with some sort of a tax
or combination of taxes that could attract the necessary 12 votes.
But he said it probably would not be possible before Saturday night.

   A mother bear and her cub were returned
to their mountain home seven months after she suffered a 7,200-volt
shock and burns as she fell, drugged by tranquilizer darts, from a
utility pole in the city.
   Scott Brown, spokesman for the state Department of Game and
Fish, said the release went off without a hitch Thursday afternoon
in the Sandia Mountains east of here. The cub was released first,
then his mother.
   Officers from the New Mexico Department of Game and Fish, U.S.
Forest Service and zoo officials assisted in the release.
   When the mother bear saw them all, ``she just took off,'' Brown
said. She stopped after she got about 25 yards away, he said, until
the cub caught up with her.
   ``She looked back at all the people and started wandering up the
hill like she should,'' Brown said.
   ``I guess our last hope is that they are going to mind their
business now, stay up there, stay out of trouble,'' said Dr. Bret
Snyder, veterinarian at the Rio Grande Zoological Park.
   Brown said the mother bear was fitted with a radio collar so
biologists can monitor her for the next couple of weeks.
   The mother bear had wandered into Albuquerque's residential
Northeast Heights last Aug. 14 and climbed a 25-foot utility pole.
When wildlife officials shot her with a tranquilizer gun, she fell,
brushing a transformer and causing the shock and burns. Pictures of
the dramatic fall was broadcast nationally.
   The cub had been captured in town the previous day.
   The bears were taken to the zoo and slowly reintroduced to each
other to protect the injured female. She had suffered extensive
damage to her skin and muscles on her hind legs.
   On her right hind leg, the bone was exposed, but it healed over,
Snyder said. ``She did maintain enough use of that leg that we
really can't tell that she has any disability to speak of,'' he
added.
   The bears were kept in a medical unit at the zoo until
mid-December, when they were moved to a quarter-acre fenced area
with cottonwood trees and a den. The bears also dug an outside den
under some concrete, Snyder said.
   The mother bear weighed 104{ pounds when brought in for
treatment but was up to 188 pounds Thursday, he said. The cub grew
from 15 pounds to 108 pounds. ``He's fat, but he's also matured a
lot,'' Snyder said.
   He said zoo crews tried to keep contact with the animals to a
minimum.
   ``When they sensed humans, they went into the dens, so we didn't
see them at all for several weeks,'' he said. ``They only came out
at night. We thought that was a good sign that they were staying
wild.''
   Albuquerque was invaded by 19 bears last summer. Drought
apparently caused a food shortage in the mountains, sending the
bears into the city.

   Thieves who allegedly stole 57 pairs of
athletic shoes from a delivery truck were slightly ahead of their
time: They chose a type of shoe not yet on sale at area stores.
   The 57 pairs, worth about $1,300, were taken Wednesday from a
truck parked behind the office of the Athlete's Foot store in
Lenexa, a city of 18,000 on the perimeter of Kansas City, said
police Detective Mike Siebers.
   The theft was discovered about 15 minutes after a man went into
the office to ask for a job, Siebers said.
   About two hours later, two men walked into an Athlete's Foot
store in Kansas City, Kan., and asked to exchange a pair of shoes
that didn't fit. Store employees, notified of the Lenexa theft,
recognized the shoes.
   Police found six more pairs of the shoes in a car in the store's
parking lot but 50 pairs still are missing. The two men were
released pending further investigation.

   At least 100 fishermen were missing and
many of them were presumed dead in a storm that tore across
southern Bangladesh earlier in the week, police and news reports
said Friday. At least 15 people were killed.
   Police said 20 fishing boats were caught in the Bay of Bengal in
Wednesday's storm and have not returned home.
   On Thursday, police said 10 people had died in the storm, but
the confirmed death toll rose to 15 when searchers found more
bodies in collapsed houses. Nearly 500 people were injured.
   The storm uprooted trees, toppled electricity poles and
destroyed vast rice paddies in the coastal Noakhali district 75
miles southeast of Bangladesh.
   More than 50 deaths have been reported in storms during the past
two weeks in Bangladesh, which is one of the world's poorest
nations and is perennially buffeted by storms and floods.

   Three workers were injured, two of them seriously, according to
police.
   About 30 workers were at the sprawling Dynamit Nobel complex
when the series of blasts went off in the morning.
   A police spokesman said more deaths were prevented ``only
because of lucky circumstances.'' At the time of the explosions,
most workers were on their morning break in another part of the

   Two Germans and a Turk died in the blasts, which occurred inside
a shop that makes gunpowder and fireworks, said police.
   The explosions leveled a number of workshops at the complex as
well as the factory's social club, said police. Nearby homes were
also damaged.
   Bretzfeld is about 25 miles southeast of Heidelberg.

   A leader of the Moslem separatist
movement in Kashmir tried to hurl a grenade into a police bunker
Friday but was killed in a volley of police gunfire.
   Tens of thousands of Moslems gathered later for the funeral.
Comrades fired into the air and vowed to carry on the fight for
independence from India.
   Ashfaq Majid Wani, 28, was a leader of the Jammu-Kashmir
Liberation Front, a leading separatist group. He was the front's
area commander in Srinagar.
   Police said he tried to throw the grenade at a police bunker in
downtown Srinagar while riding by on a motor scooter. The grenade
went off after officers opened fire with automatic weapons.
   Three other people died in the melee, the police said.
   Hours later, thousands of residents gathered near Wani's house
in an attempt to hold a funeral procession in defiance of a
government curfew.
   But soldiers and police prevented the procession and took Wani's
body to a burial ground in a government ambulance escorted by a
police jeep.
   Women wailed and beat their chest as Wani's body was taken out
of the ambulance and placed near the grave. Men shouted: ``Ashfaq's
blood will usher independence!'' A group militants fired pistols
and automatic rifles in the air.
   Witnesses estimated the crowd at 40,000.
   The firing continued intermittently for more than one hour until
the body wa interred at 5 p.m.
   ``We will carry forward Asfaq's mission, which was to gain
independence,'' said one militant leader holding a Soviet-designed
Kalashnikov rifle. He refused to give his name.
   The secessionist movement has been alternately simmering and
flaring since 1948, when the Hindu ruler of the old princely state
of Kashmir, faced with the option of merging either with India or
Islamic Pakistan, chose India.
   The two countries then were one year old, having been
partitioned from the British colonial India.
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir. They left
the region split into the Pakistan-held territory called Azad
Kashmir, or free Kashmir, and the Indian-controlled Jammu-Kashmir
state.
   Jammu-Kashmir is the only state in India that is dominated by
Moslems. Most of India's 880 million people are Hindu.
   At least 233 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan. 20
when the government launched a crackdown on increasing violence by
Moslem separatists.
   Official sources said Indian soldiers shot and killed 10 Moslem
separatists Friday who were trying to slip into Pakistani-held
territory of Kashmir. They said the men were in a group 22 that
opened fire on the soldiers.
   The 12 surviving militants were arrested, said the sources, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Also Friday, police fatally shot a curfew violated in Srinagar.
   The body of a suspected police informer was found in Srinagar,
and officials said militants claimed responsibility.

   Thousands of Palestinians and Israeli Arabs
held rallies and protest marches Friday to mark the 14th
anniversary of ``Land Day,'' when bloody riots broke out over
Israeli confiscation of Arab land.
   A general strike closed shops and schools throughout the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, in Arab east Jerusalem, and in
Arab villages in Israel.
   In a rare clash inside Israel, police used tear gas to disperse
Arab demonstrators after an hour of stone throwing by youths in the
town of Taibeh, reporters said. Israel radio said two firebombs
were also thrown.
   One policeman was stabbed while arresting stone throwers. He was
hospitalized in stable condition. Six other officers were injured
by stones, the radio said. At least five Arabs were taken into
custody.
   About 10,000 Israeli Arabs attended the main Land Day rally in
Arraba, where two people were killed during the 1976 riots.
   In Jerusalem, Sheik Hamed Bitawi complained that Israeli
soldiers and police prevented thousands of Moslems from attending
Friday prayer services at the Al Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's
holiest sites.
   ``We pray to God to avenge this wrong,'' Bitawi told the prayer
service. ``The Zionists have committed an injustice against us.
Soldiers are here as if it is a battlefield.''
   Extra police and soldiers were deployed to prevent unrest
surrounding the anniversary. During the 1976 riots, police shot to
death six Arabs who were protesting the seizing of Arab land in the
Galilee.
   This year's anniversary also fell on the first Friday _ the
Moslem prayer day _ of the holy month of Ramadan, so officials were
particularly concerned about unrest.
   Fewer than 10,000 Moslems attended the Al Aqsa prayers. Before
the start of the Palestinian uprising in December 1987, Ramadan
services would draw more than 150,000 people.
   Young Palestinians were turned back at Israeli police and army
checkpoints on roads leading to Jerusalem. Troops also turned
people away as they tried to enter Jerusalem's old walled city to
go to Al Aqsa.
   An army statement said the soldiers were blocking ``elements
likely of endangering the security of the state.''
   In protests in the occupied territories and Israel, Arabs stoned
cars, held marches and raised Palestinian flags in defiance of
Israeli authorities.
   In the Arab town of Kafr Kanna, Abdel Wahab Daroushe, an Arab
member of Israel's Parliament, read a message from PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat to several thousand people at an annual memorial
service for a teen-ager killed in 1976.
   Arafat's message praised Israeli Arabs ``for igniting the first
spark in 1976, which led to the great fire of the uprising.'' It
also praised Israelis who support negotiations with Palestinians as
``heroic, democratic Jews.''
   Palestinian protest marches were reported in the West Bank towns
of Jenin, Beit Jala and Yatta.
   Troops broke up the Yatta demonstration by dropping tear gas
from helicopters. Soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets to
disperse stone throwers in Beit Jala, Arab reports said.
   In Jenin, hundreds of women and masked men marched carrying
pictures of Arafat, Arab reporters said.
   On walls in the town, Palestinians painted pictures of donkeys
with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's name written under
them.
   In a counter demonstration, Jewish settlers flew Israeli flags
in the West Bank to emphasize their demand that Israel not give up
the land captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The flags were placed on a road leading from the Jewish suburb
of Gilo on the outskirts of Jerusalem to the Dheishe refugee camp.
The camp was established to house Palestinians who fled their homes
at the founding of Israel in 1948.
   Curfews were imposed on all 700,000 residents of the Gaza Strip
and on four West Bank towns or villages.

   Here are highlights of the child care bill
passed by the House on Thursday:
   _ The package is estimated to cost $27 billion over a five-year
phase in period.
   _ Most of the money, $18.5 billion, would expand the earned
income tax credit, which goes to low-income working families.
   _ It would expand the Head Start program for disadvantaged
children to provide child care throughout the calender year during
each work day.
   _ It would provide money for states to give to local school
districts to expand, establish or operate child-care programs based
in the schools.
   _ It would provide $2.9 billion to increase the Title XX Social
Servies Block Grant program for use by the states in providing
child-care services. States would be required to offer low-income
families vouchers to pay for child care operated by religious
groups.
   _ It would provide additional money for states to improve the
quality of child care and to encourage private businesses to
establish child-care programs.
   _ It would phase out the existing dependent-care tax credit for
families earning $70,000 to $90,000, and eliminate it above that
level. It would make permanent the 3 percent telephone excise tax.

   President Bush said today he sent a personal
message to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to make sure ``the
Soviets understand our position'' on Lithuania.
   ``I do not want to risk misunderstanding by failing to
communicate,'' Bush said.
   The president sent a personal message to the Soviet leader on
Thursday night appealing for a peaceful resolution of the crisis in
the seccesionist Baltic republic, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said.
   Later, speaking with reporters during a picture-taking session,
Bush said: ``I want to be sure the Soviets understand our position
and understand that we're not trying to make things difficult for
Lithuania or the Soviet Uniion or anybody else,'' Bush said.
   He said he had not yet heard back from Gorbachev but indicated
that he expected some form of reply. Bush declined to disclose the
contents of his message, calling it confidential.
   Asked why he decided to contact Gorbachev directly, Bush cited
the importance of ``staying in touch and being sure there is no
disconnect because of misinformation.''
   It was Bush's first effort at direct contact with the Soviet
leader since tensions began escalating with the March 11 Lithuanian
declaration of independence.
   In the letter to Gorbachev, Bush ``clearly stated his support
and the American support for the aspirations of the Lithuanian
people for self-determination,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``We have expressed our belief and our emphatic view that a
resolution of this conflict lies in peaceful dialogue,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``The president's message to President Gorbachev simply
reaffirmed our position as stated many times.'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said Bush's letter was sent ``via diplomatic
channels'' Thursday evening.
   ``He wanted to be certain our position was understood,''
Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater also said that Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., had
met with Bush in the White House on Thursday to report on the
senator's trip to Moscow and meeting with Gorbachev. Kennedy's
half-hour report to Bush on the trip ``was a factor'' in the
president's decision to write a letter to Gorbachev, Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said Bush's letter was delivered to officials at the
Soviet Embassy in Washington, which relayed it to Moscow.
   It came a day after Fitzwater said Bush ``simply feels that this
is not the time'' for direct contact with the Soviet leader.
   Today, the spokesman said, ``I was not aware of any intent to do
it'' on Thursday morning but that Bush ``decided to do it and just
did it.''
   ``The president felt that last night was the right time to send
a personal, written message that clearly laid out our position,''
Fitzwater said.
   The Bush administration had treaded carefully on the Lithuanian
subject, voicing support for the self-determination rights of
citizens of the rebellious Baltic republic while urging restraint
on both sides.
   The United States has never recognized the 1940 forced
incorporation of Lithuania into the Soviet Union. But, neither has
it extended formal diplomatic recognition to the secessionist state.
   Fitzwater said that an ``accumulation of information and
feedback'' had prompted the president ``to feel that this was the
time for a personal message that used his words and that President
Gorbachev knew came directly from him.''
   Fitzwater said this ``feedback'' included Bush's meeting with
Kennedy, his phone call on Wednesday to British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher and contacts between Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and his Soviet counterpart, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Administration officials have repeatedly cautioned that use of
force by Moscow in blocking Lithuanian independence would backfire
and could damage U.S.-Soviet relations.
   But Bush has come under pressure from some members of Congress
for not being more aggressive in complaining about Soviet actions
in the breakaway republic.
   While acknowledging the criticism, Fitzwater today said, ``We
believe our supporters far outnumber our critics on this issue.''
   On recent developments in Lithuania, Fitzwater said: ``We have
not seen too many episodes the last few days that have been very
dramatic. But the problem is not resolved. They're still searching
for solutions. And we hope that can be worked out.''
   Fitzwater said Bush welcomed Kennedy's firsthand report, even
though generally speaking, ``we never feel that great about
senators doing their own foreign policy.''
   The spokesman said that no attempts had been made to contact
directly the rebellious Lithuanian leaders, citing the lack of any
formal ties with the Vilnius government.
   However, he said that contact with Lithuanian leaders by some
U.S. citizens and U.S.-Lithuanian groups here had been generally
helpful in indirectly getting across U.S. policy views to
Lithuanians.
   ``Our interest is not in making threats and not in doing any
damage to the situation, but in being positive and constructive,''
Fitzwater said.
   ``We want to be helpful in resolving this process. We don't want
to do any harm,'' he added.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister of Nepal Quits Amid Democracy Campaign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister of this Himalayan
kingdom quit Friday because of differences with the prime minister
over the government's handling of a spiraling movement for a
multiparty democracy.
   Shailendra Kumar Upadhyaya, contacted by telephone, said he
submitted his resignation Friday morning to Prime Minister Marich
Man Singh Shrestha.
   ``I was not satisfied regarding the prime minister's handling of
the present situation,'' he said. It was the first time Upadhyaya
had indicated he disagreed with the government crackdown on the
fledgling campaign. He has been in office since 1986.
   State-run radio reported that two pro-democracy protesters were
killed by police gunfire Friday in the Katmandu suburb of Patan.
The radio said police opened fire when protesters became violent.
   Three protesters were injured by police gunfire, and 30
policemen were injured in daylong clashes, the report said.
   Witnesses contacted by telephone said 11 demonstrators were
injured. The witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
they were not aware of police casualties.
   The radio said the demonstrators burned a police van, hurled
stones and damaged an ambulance and a bus. They also damaged
property in five government buildings, the radio reported. It said
45 people were arrested.
   At least 14 people have been killed in Nepal since Feb. 18, when
the government launched a crackdown on protesters demanding the
lifting of a 29-year-old ban on political parties.
   The movement is led by the Nepali Congress Party, a coalition of
left-wing groups.
   Kesar Bahadur Bista, a National Assembly deputy representing
Patan constituency, said violence had increased on both sides in
recent weeks.
   ``Violence from any side is not good. There should be a
political dialogue to solve the problem,'' he said.
   In a protest related to the political unrest, hundreds of women
beating spoons on metal dinner plates protested in Katmandu against
high prices Friday. Protest leader Mina Pandey blamed the
government for the situation.
   ``Democracy will usher in a new era under which we will be able
to express our grievances freely,'' she said.
   Police arrested about 25 women after the meeting. It was not
immediately clear if they were charged.
   Power in Nepal is shared by the king and the National Assembly.
The monarch nominates one-fifth of the Assembly's members, and the
rest are elected on a non-party basis.
   Nepal's two-year experiment with a Western-style democracy ended
in 1961, when the present monarch's father, King Mahendra,
dismissed the government of the Nepali Congress, accusing it of
corruption and mismanagement.
   The government says the current political system is a working
democracy.

<TEXT>
   Ten years ago this weekend, graduate
student Aaron Lansky rented a modest loft, took out corporation
papers and launched an ambitious mission: rescuing Yiddish
literature from extinction.
   ``Everybody's best guess was that there were about 75,000
volumes still extant. Here we are a million books later and still
going strong,'' he said. ``There was no way to have imagined how
prolific Jews were as writers and readers.''
   Now, the founder of the National Yiddish Book Center is turning
to the business of trying to disseminate the thousands of books
written in the language spoken by Eastern European Jews for
hundreds of years and nearly erased in the Holocaust.
   ``Our first 10 years was devoted to collecting and distributing
books. Now we'll branch out and begin doing a great more,'' he
said. ``Our premise is now we've collected all these books, we've
got to open them up and let the world know what's inside of them.''
   Lansky, 33, has moved the center to nearby Amherst and
established a warehouse about 10 miles away in Holyoke to hold the
thousands of books sent in, including some that were rescued from
trash bins or plucked from attics.
   In December, he traveled to the Soviet Union's Baltic states,
responding to letters from Jews who hoped President Mikhail
Gorbachev's reforms would mean a return for Yiddish.
   ``It was a pretty grueling experience in many ways,'' he said.
``What we found was that Yiddish was not widely spoken in Russia
proper. There is really what amounts to 70 years of assimilation.''
   Lansky hopes to work out a system of shipping books to Stockholm
and then taking them personally into the Soviet Union.
   The international venture goes far beyond the hopes he had as a
student of Yiddish who wanted to collect fodder for his research.
   ``Collecting the books was a big undertaking for us. We've
collected almost 1 million volumes which no one would have thought
possible. Surprisingly enough they're still coming in,'' Lansky
said.
   The non-profit center has a staff of about two dozen and runs
educational and cultural programs, including the Yiddish Library
Development Program. About 70 libraries are participating,
including Yale University, which has a collection of 70,000 Yiddish
books from the center.
   The center celebrated its 10th anniversary quietly, holding a
four-day film series in Northampton, where the venture began.
   Lansky said the decade has seen a resurgence of interest in
Yiddish.
   ``Really what we're doing is picking up the remnants of a
shattered past,'' he said. ``We're right at the nexus of two worlds
where the last of a Yiddish-speaking generation is passing on. My
generation is the last generation whose grandparents spoke Yiddish.
There's really a great deal of urgency in all this.''

<HEAD>No-Bid Contracts At New Housing Agency Probed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Housing and Urban
Development's inspector general confirmed Friday he is
investigating a new agency whose director gave no-bid contracts to
three friends from the Reagan administration.
   However, Inspector General Paul A. Adams declined comment on an
account from a department source who said the preliminary effort
found ``contract irregularities'' at the new Federal Housing
Finance Board, which controls millions of dollars in federal
housing aid.
   The agency, whose embattled director has been clashing with top
aides to HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, is independent of HUD but has
remained under Kemp's control for seven months because he is its
only named board member.
   The agency was created as part of the savings and loan bailout
plan _ to oversee the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks, which
must give up $400 million of their profits each year to help pay
for the thrift bailout. The regional banks also must put a
percentage of their profits each year into affordable housing
programs, starting with $78 million this year and rising to $100
million.
   Kemp spent several hours meeting Thursday with the women he
recruited to head the agency, Mary K. Bush, who was a Treasury
Department official during the Reagan administration.
   Among the recipients of the no-bid contracts were:
   _ Wendell Gunn, who worked for Reagan and also served for
several months last year as Kemp's chief of staff at HUD.
   _ Margery Waxman, an attorney who after leaving Treasury helped
Charles Keating try to fend off S&amp;L regulators who wanted to seize
his troubled California thrift. Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan
later failed at an estimated eventual cost to taxpayers of $2.5
billion.
   The third went to a consulting firm whose partners include
another former Treasury official.
   Kemp aides said Friday that he had not been aware of any of the
no-bid contracts until last week or of any financial arrangement
between Gunn and the Housing Finance Board.
   Gunn has said he informed Kemp late last year. And HUD
Undersecretary Alfred A. DelliBovi, in a memo to several top Kemp
aides last month, listed ``Wendell'' as being among those being
paid by the agency.
   Adams, the inspector general, said he began the investigation at
Kemp's request and on Monday took possession of Housing Finance
Board records. He said agency officials were cooperating.
   He declined to answer questions about specifics of his review
but said he hoped to issue a final report to Kemp next week.
   A department source, speaking only on the condition of
anonymity, said the preliminary findings showed that all board
contract awards followed accepted procedures except the three to
Ms. Bush's friends.
   Ms. Bush was not available for comment. Her spokesman, Joseph
Slye, said she had taken the day off and was out of town. She has
asked attorney Peter Wallison, a former Reagan administration
attorney with whom she worked at Treasury, to represent her in the
investigation. Wallison's office said he was out of town and not
available for comment. Ms. Bush, through Slye, said last week that
she had the power to issue no-bid contracts and did so because the
agency was short-staffed and needed to get up and running.
   Kemp's decision to call in Adams is the latest development in a
behind-the-scenes struggle between Ms. Bush and top Kemp deputies.
Publicly, Kemp and others at HUD have maintained their support of
Ms. Bush but one of the housing secretary's top deputies said
nearly two months ago in a memo to other Kemp aides that he hoped
she would leave.
   In his Feb. 5, memo, obtained by The Associated Press, DelliBovi
said ``Wendell'' had told a new agency employee he wanted to soon
leave the Housing Finance Board.
   ``If he goes let's hope he takes Mary,'' is how DelliBovi
concluded the memo.
   Among the six Kemp aides to whom it was addressed was Mary
Brunette, Kemp's closest adviser.
   She said Friday she did not recall ever reading the memo.
   ``To my knowledge the secretary was not aware of any contractual
relationship or financial relationship between Wendell Gunn and the
Federal Housing Finance Board,'' Ms. Brunette said. ``If I became
aware of such a relationship I would have told him.''
   But Gunn, in an angry letter to DelliBovi this week said: ``The
secretary did in fact know I was being paid for my work and, if you
ask, he will tell you so. In fact, in late November, I offered to
end the arrangement retroactively, giving up all accrued
compensation, if the secretary thought there was even the
appearance of a problem.''

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration today accused 35
separate nations of erecting trade barriers against U.S. products,
the first stage of a process that could result in retaliation
against countries that refuse to open their doors to American goods.
   The accusations were included in the 1990 edition of the
``National Trade Report on Foreign Trade Barriers.'
   Japan, which accounts for almost of half of America's $109
billion trade deficit, was singled out for having more barriers
than any other country, accounting for 19 pages 216 page report.
South Korea was the second worst offender with 10 pages of alleged
infractions.
   Today's report was the first step in drawing up a list of
priority countries the administration will target for intensive
negotiations aimed at getting the offending trade barriers
eliminated.
   That priority list is due on April 30.
   The requirement for a target list of countries was the most
controversial section of the 1988 trade law.
   In addition to Japan and South Korea, 33 other nations and two
trading blocks were singled out for barriers against U.S. products.
   The other countries were: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada,
Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, West Germany, Finland, France,
Greece, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Medico, New
Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, Portugal,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, the United
Kingdom, Venezuela and Yugoslavia.
   The two trading blocs were the 12 nation European Community and
the Gulf Cooperation Council, which includes Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates.

<HEAD>Orders Bounce Back After Steep January Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Orders to factories for manufactured goods
bounced back 1.8 percent in February from their steepest dive in 16
years a month earlier, the government said Friday.
   Still, orders were running below the levels posted late last
year.
   Analysts said the report was more evidence of sluggishness in
the industrial sector of the economy, but also found signs
indicating improvement ahead.
   ``Manufacturing is aimlessly drifting along on a plateau,''
Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for the Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said of the report. ``The mini-recession in manufacturing
is still there.''
   Evalina Tainer, senior economist for the First National Bank of
Chicago, agreed, but added that the report suggests ``the
manufacturing sector has bottomed out and we could be a little bit
on the mend.''
   The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and
non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $231.6 billion
after plummeting 5.5 percent in January, the steepest drop since a
7 percent decline in December 1974.
   January's plunge was even deeper than the 5.4 percent reported
last month.
   But while the February rebound was not back to pre-January
levels, Dederick and Ms. Tainer saw signs of optimism in a category
often used in measuring future business investment plans.
   ``Capital goods orders less aircraft are looking a little firmer
than they did before,'' Dederick said. ``They're showing some signs
of underlying support to the expansion. I'm not saying strength,
but weakness is not developing.''
   Commerce said non-defense capital goods orders less aircraft
rose 2.2 percent in February. Durable goods orders advanced 2.6
percent.
   Durable goods orders _ expensive items expected to last more
than three years _ have been affected most by the Federal Reserve's
high-interest policies because they often are financed by loans.
   The department said durable goods orders were concentrated in
transportation equipment, up 10.4 percent to $29.9 billion.
Transportation orders had led the overall January decline with a
drop of 29.4 percent.
   Non-durable goods orders rose 0.9 percent to $110.7 billion. The
largest increases were in food and printing and publishing.
   Defense orders, which often are volatile, shot ahead 21.7
percent to $7.9 billion after falling 33.6 percent the previous
month. Excluding defense, orders were up 1.2 percent.

<TEXT>
   Ten-term Rep. Bill Frenzel, the senior
member of Minnesota's congressional delegation, announced today
that he will not seek re-election this fall.
   ``Every member of Congress knows when the time has come not to
run again,'' Frenzel, 61, told a news conference. ``For me, it is
now.''
   Frenzel, is the fourth-ranking Republican on the powerful Ways
and Means Committee and the senior GOP lawmaker on the Budget
committee.
   ``I have no specific plans for the future,'' he said. ``I expect
to be useful in some way, but I am not looking for any more
80-hours-a-week jobs.''
   Frenzel was first elected to the U.S. House in 1970 from the 3rd
District, which includes western and southern Minneapolis suburbs
and some outlying regions.
   The announcement was unexpected, and the race to succeed Frenzel
him could attract a dozen or more candidates. Frenzel himself
predicted ``30 or 40 candidates for my seat.'' Party primaries are
held in September.
   ``What a shocker, a total surprise,'' said state Sen. Jim
Ramstad, who is expected to be among the first of the IR candidates
to enter the congressional race.

   The former manager of a failed Omaha credit
union is mentally incompetent to stand trial on federal charges of
conspiracy, fraud and filing false tax returns, a magistrate said
today.
   U.S. Magistrate Richard Kopf said he would recommend that
Lawrence E. King Jr. be committed to a federal medical center in
Rochester, Minn., for treatment.
   King was manager-treasurer of the Franklin Community Federal
Credit Union, which was created to help north Omaha's poor. Federal
regulators closed it in 1988, and officials said $39 million was
missing.
   King, a wealthy black businessman who sang the national anthem
at the 1984 Republican National Convention, is accused of diverting
the money for his personal use.
   The prosecution agrees that King, 45, is not competent to stand
trial, said assistant U.S. attorney Thomas Thalken. A psychiatrist
diagnosed King as having ``probable delusional paranoid disorder _
grandiose type.''
   Kopf said that while King understood the nature and consequences
of the 40 charges against him, he would be unable to assist in his
defense in the complex case.
   The magistrate said he would recommend to U.S. District Judge
William G. Cambridge that doctors who treat King at the hospital
report to the court within four months on whether King could face
trial in the foreseeable future.

   About 100 Vietnamese boat people battled each

   It was not known what sparked the violence at the Shek Kong

police said.
   They said two Vietnamese were taken to hospitals where they were

   There have been several outbreaks of violence in the squalid and
crowded refugee camps in this British colony, where about 44,000

1989. Five people died last year in riots.
   In December, 51 Vietnamese were repatriated against their will,
leading to a marked increase in tension in the camps.

   Panama's Vice President Guillermo Ford called

   Ford said his government was determined to ``forgive and move

   Ford's comment refers to tensions between the two countries over
Israel's close links to Noriega before he was ousted last December
by a U.S. invasion force and brought to Miami to stand trial on
drug trafficking charges.
   Israel had trained Noriega's personal bodyguards and its defense
industries had several lucrative contracts with Panama. Noriega
owned property in Israel and had sent his daughters there several
times.
   One of Noriega's closest advisers was Mike Harari, a former
operative of the Mossad intelligence agency who turned to private
business in Latin America.
   The idea of the Israeli meeting with Ford was proposed during
talks Turgeman held this week with Undersecretary of State Robert
Kimmitt, Yaron said.
   The Panamanian Embassy confirmed the meeting took place but
could not immediately provide details.
   Panama is anxious to rebuild its economy, shattered by a U.S.
boycott of the country under Noriega and by the invasion itself.
   Ford and the Israeli diplomats agreed that Israel would provide
Panama with expertise on agricultural projects and on rebuilding
the country's medical system, Yaron said.
   Since neither Israel nor Panama have money for such projects,
the United States may fund them, she said.
   Ford also was invited to visit Israel, she said.

<HEAD>Thousands of Slovaks Protest Country's New Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRATISLAVA, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Slovaks rallied
Friday to protest the country's new name, which does not have a
hyphen to distinguish Slovaks from the dominant Czechs.
   The national Parliament voted Thursday night to drop the
``Socialist'' designation from the country's name and call the
nation the Czechoslovak Federative Republic. That set off daylong
protests in Bratislava, the capital of the Slovak republic.
   Parliament agreed to allow the Slovaks to write the new name
with a hyphen. But the Slovaks wanted legislators to approve
``Czecho-Slovak Republic'' as the proper name of the country.
   Tension had been building for weeks between Czechs and Slovaks
over the issue. The spontaneous protest Friday began outside the
Slovak Parliament building and then moved to a central Bratislava
square.
   Chanting ``Long live Slovakia!'' the crowd applauded speakers
who asserted that the Czechs, who make up about two-thirds of
Czechoslovakia's 15.5 million people, had ridden roughshod over the
interests of the Slovaks. Some even carried banners calling for a
sovereign Slovak state.
   Slovakia's Parliament unanimously passed a resolution demanding
talks involving the federal Parliament and the leaderships of the
Czech and Slovak republics on the name issue.
   Civic Forum and Public Against Violence, the movements that led
last winter's peaceful revolution against Communism, appealed for
an end to the strife.
   ``It seems the time when we could be proud of what we have
achieved ... has ended,'' said Jan Urban, leader of Civic Forum.
   The row developed after President Vaclav Havel, a Czech,
suggested in January that Czechoslovakia follow Poland and Hungary
and drop the designation ``Socialist'' from its formal title of
Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.
   The Slovaks suggested a hyphen be inserted in the new name to
set them apart from the Czechs. But the hyphen suggestion was
firmly rejected by the dominant Czech deputies, and by some
Slovaks, when the federal Parliament voted Thursday.
   Slovakia became a republic in 1969. The division into Czech and
Slovak republics meant that Slovakia got one-half of most federal
resources.
   Slovak television and Czech radio both broadcast the rally for
awhile. Slovak television abruptly halted the transmission after a
few minutes. Czech radio broadcast remarks by an unidentified
speaker but then cut off the transmission, saying it could not
support separatist tendencies voiced in the speech.

<HEAD>Report: More Research Needed on Mopping Up Oil Spills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Technology for cleaning up a spill the size of
the one caused by the Exxon Valdez was marginal to begin with and
hasn't improved in the year since the accident, says a government
report released Friday.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the study shows that the
government should create more incentives to study how to clean up
oil.
   ``This report will be used to urge more investment in research
and development,'' said Stevens as he released the study from
Congress' Office of Technology Assessment. He suggested tax law
changes to give industry more incentive to do the research.
   He also said pending legislation authorizes $28 million annually
for national research into spill cleanup and $23 million over a
10-year period for the Prince William Sound oil spill institute.
   The Prince William Sound research would include a decade-long
study of the impact of Exxon's nearly 11 million gallon crude oil
spill last year on Alaska's natural environment.
   However, both industry and government should be focusing first
on prevention, said Stevens.
   ``Short of eliminating oil transportation at sea, no perfect
solution to the problem of offshore oil spills exists,'' said the
OTA. ``Oil spills will occur again and the catastrophic ones will
never be cleaned up satisfactorily. The proverbial ounce of
prevention is worth a pound of cure.''
   Stevens said legislation passed by both the House and Senate and
now in conference has safety provisions designed to reduce the
number of spills.
   The senator said he is certain a bill will be passed this year,
but it's currently stalled in the conference committee because of
differences between the Senate and the House over certain
provisions, including whether tankers should be required to have
double hulls and bottoms.

   Thousands of doctors and nurses went on
strike nationwide Friday to pay homage to a colleague, who was
allegedly slain for helping force terrorists on a hunger strike to
eat.
   An estimated 3,000 doctors and nurses in this northern city took
part in a 24-hour strike and silently marched from a hospital to
the doctor's residence, where they left hundreds of white flowers.
   A two-hour work stoppage at health facilities was observed
across the country.
   A woman shot and killed Dr. Ramon Munoz y Fernandez in his
office Tuesday in this northern city, police said.
   No group has claimed responsibility. Officials blame the leftist
group known as GRAPO, which had threatened doctors who fed jailed
GRAPO hunger strikers.
   Munoz fed two convicted GRAPO terrorists during a recent hunger
strike aimed at pressuring the government to stop dispersing jailed
terrorists to numerous prisons.

   Thousands of government doctors around the
country staged a 24-hour strike for more pay Friday, leaving most
hospital patients in the provinces without medical care.
   The stoppage was the third this month by hospital doctors
demanding better wages and protesting the possible closure of
provincial hospitals.
   The government doctors say low staff levels in the provinces
mean some hospitals would have to close down or cut back on
services unless doctors are willing to work overtime for no extra
pay.
   Doctors' salaries are indexed to rise automatically with
inflation, currently at 15 percent. But Kyriakos Eleftheriadis,
president of the Athens and Piraeus Hospital Doctors Union, said
doctors have had no real pay increase since 1983.
   Georgios Sepirgiotis, vice president of the government doctors'
union, said the average monthly pay for a senior hospital doctor is
$660.

   President Bush, an avid fisherman, received
fishing licenses Friday from the District of Columbia and adjacent
Virginia and Maryland.
   ``There's a good possibility of fishing trips in the local
area,'' said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater after
officials of the three jurisdictions gave Bush the licenses at a
White House presentation.
   Since he's been in the White House, Bush has fished extensively
in Maine _ both from his powerboat in the Atlantic off his vacation
home in Kennebunkport and for freshwater fish in the nearby
Kennebunk River.
   The president fished in Wyoming last year during a visit to
Grand Teton National Park and in the Gulf of Mexico off the Texas
coast near Corpus Christi during a year-end vacation.
   He plans to go fishing in the Florida Keys next month after a
meeting at Key Largo with French President Francois Mitterrand.
   Presenting Bush with the fishing licenses were Elizabeth
Haskell, Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources; Torrey Brown,
Maryland Department of Natural Resources; and Ben Williams, manager
of fishing licenses for the District of Columbia.
   White House aides said Bush hopes to fish in the Potomac River,
the border between Maryland and Virginia, as well in some of the
trout streams near Camp David, the presidential retreat in
Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.

   Prisoners in a southeastern jail held a
``death lottery'' and executed the loser to protest overcrowding
and poor living conditions, police said Friday.
   Police inspector Rosemarie Goncalves de Freitas said prisoners
killed 27-year-old Marcelo de Pietro, who was serving a 31-year
sentence for rape and murder.
   ``His fellow inmates strangled him with a nylon cord used to sew
soccer balls. The execution was a way to protest overcrowded
conditions,'' she said by telephone.
   The killing took place Thursday in the central jail of Santo
Andre, an industrial suburb of Sao Paulo.
   Nearly 400 inmates were locked up in the Santo Andre jail. It
was built to hold 96 prisoners. In de Pietro's cell, 47 inmates
were kept in a space intended for six.
   Ms. Freitas said De Pietro was chosen by lottery but did not
give details. Press reports said only rapists and murderers were
included in the drawing.
   On Friday, 36 inmates were transferred to other prisons to
prevent further executions, Ms. Freitas said.

   Airbus Industrie on Friday rejected
accusations by India's top investigative agency that its directors
bribed former Indian government officials to win a $1.47 billion
airplane contract.
   The European aircraft-manufacturing consortium threatened legal
action against the unidentified sources of the charges made
Thursday by the Central Bureau of Investigation in New Delhi.
   In a press statement, Airbus declared its ``astonishment by
these fantasy-like accusations.''
   The charges are the latest in the dispute between India and
Airbus since the Feb. 14 crash of an Indian Airlines Airbus A320.
The accident killed 92 of the 146 people aboard.
   Indian officials have said the crash was due to a computer
malfunction. Airbus officials have blamed errors by the crew.
   The Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday filed
preliminary charges in the bribery scandal against officials from
Airbus Industrie; International Aero Engines, which manufactured
the aircraft's engines; and four former Indian aviation officials.
   In India, preliminary charges are registered when enough
evidence exits to launch an investigation. Final charges are filed
when an investigation is completed.
   The charges said Indian officials accepted kickbacks to reverse
a decision to purchase U.S.-made Boeing 757 jetliners and instead
buy 38 Airbus A320s in a deal concluded in June. The charges did
not say how much money was allegedly involved.
   The government has grounded all Indian Airlines A320s pending an
investigation of the crash. Further deliveries of the plane have
been halted.
   Airbus Industrie is a consortium composed of British Aerospace,
Aerospaciale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm Gmbh of West
Germany and Aeronauticas Naccionales of Spain.

<HEAD>Parents Say $1 a Week Not Too Much for Daughter's Memory</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the drunken driver and the parents of
the teen-age girl he killed, $1 a week is the price for getting on
with the rest of their lives.
   ``I told the kid face-to-face, if you want to get on with your
life and never see me again, just put a dollar in the mail every
Friday,'' said Louis Herzog.
   Susan Herzog was 18 when she was killed on New Year's Day 1982.
Kevin Tunell was 17, so his case went to Juvenile Court where he
was convicted of manslaughter and drunken driving.
   Louis and Patricia Herzog filed a $1.5 million suit against
Tunell, but settled for $936, to be paid $1 at a time to remind
Tunell what he had done to their daughter.
   Tunell, now 26, keeps missing his payments. The Herzogs keep
taking him to court.
   He was sentenced Thursday in Fairfax County Circuit Court to 30
days in jail for contempt because he has not lived up to his
agreement to make the weekly payments. Circuit Judge Jack B.
Stevens allowed him 30 days to appeal.
   Testifying Thursday, Tunell said he is haunted by Susan Herzog's
death and tormented by the payments.
   ``It's like I'm not purposely not writing them because I want to
defy the court and I'm trying to hurt the Herzogs. I just don't
feel good. It hurts,'' he said, weeping.
   This was the fourth time in eight years that the Herzogs, both
active in Mothers Against Drunk Driving, have been to court trying
to enforce the dollar-a-week agreement.
   As his criminal sentence, Tunell was ordered to spend a year
talking to groups about the evils of drunken driving. He completed
that sentence, he said, and continued to campaign against drunken
driving for the next six years.
   Tunell declined Friday to talk about the case.
   ``I think it's pretty evident what's going on. I think people
will understand why I don't want to talk,'' Tunell said by
telephone from his parents' home in Fairfax. ``I just want to get
on with my life.''
   Tunnel's lawyer, Stan Klein, also declined to answer questions
but read a statement.
   ``Kevin and his family hope that this tragedy of over eight
years ago can be left to the families that have suffered as a
result of it, as they will have to continue to live with it for the
rest of their lives,'' the statement said.
   The $1 payments are due each Friday because Susan died on a
Friday. They began in 1982 and will end in 2000 _ one year for
every year Susan lived.
   The agreement specifies that payments are to be made by check
made out to Susan Herzog. Her parents deposit the money in a
scholarship fund at Virginia Tech, earmarked for students from
Robinson High School, where their daughter was a senior.
   From the witness stand Thursday, Tunell offered the Herzogs two
boxes of checks covering payments until 2001, one year more than
required. They refused.
   ``What we want is to receive that check every week on time,''
Mrs. Herzog said. ``He must understand we are going to pursue this
until August of the year 2000. We will go back to court every month
if we have to.''
   The couple say they have no sympathy for drunken drivers. A
second daughter, Deborah, was hit by a drunken driver in 1987. The
Florida accident crushed Deborah Herzog's legs and she now walks
with a permanent limp.
   Judge Stevens, while ruling Tunell in contempt, questioned the
parents' persistence.
   ``It's been said, `To err is human. But to forgive is divine,'''
Stevens said.
   ``I suppose to forgive is divine, but unfortunately Lou Herzog
is just an average guy,'' Herzog said Friday.
   ``We're always asked why are we doing this, why are we trying to
ruin this boy's life,'' he said. ``We're not vindictive. We're not
trying to destroy this young man. All we want is what we agreed to.
We're getting on with our lives and we want him to get on with
his.''

   The United States is working to repeal the
1975 U.N. resolution equating Zionism with racism but will not call
for a vote in the General Assembly unless success is guaranteed, a
State Department official said Friday.
   ``We are taking action and will intensify our efforts during the
1990 session of the General Assembly,'' John R. Bolton, assistant
secretary of state for international organization affairs, told a
congressional hearing.
   ``We must be most careful, nonetheless, to ensure that our
efforts are not subverted by those hostile to Israel and to the
Middle East peace process.''
   The Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on Near Eastern and
South Asian affairs is considering a joint resolution calling on
all U.N. members to repeal General Assembly Resolution 3379.
   Zionism, the movement to support the Jewish national state of
Israel, is opposed by Israel's Arab neighbors and their allies.
   The United States has been consulting with countries that
originally voted for Resolution 3379 ``but which have subsequently
acquired new governments and new thinking,'' Bolton told the
subcommittee.
   ``Our consultations are far from over but we have seen
substantial evidence of shifts of opinion,'' he said, citing
indications from Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Mexico.
   The United States is also talking with Arab countries and with
nations that abstained or were absent for the 1975 vote or which
joined the United Nations after that, Bolton said.
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., the chairman of the
subcommittee, asked Bolton to produce a list of countries that
voted for Resolution 3379 and that also receive direct U.S. aid.
   ``Have we ever told one country _ just one country _ that you're
getting American money but you're not going to get any more unless
you change your mind?'' Moynihan asked.
   Bolton said he did not know.

<TEXT>
   Josie Cruz Natori, once a Wall Street investment
banker, is heading back to New York as avant-garde designer trying
to bring underwear out of the closet and into the fashion spotlight.
   Her first full-scale show opens in Manhattan on Wednesday, and
she admits to some nervousness. ``You never know how critics will
react,'' said the diminutive Philippine-born American.
   Mrs. Natori, 43, has been building a solid business and
reputation in the lingerie field for 10 years and now feels it's
time to go big-time.
   ``I don't want my fashion to be categorized. I almost hate the
word `lingerie' to describe it,'' she said, escorting a model
wearing a luxurious gold charmeuse satin sheath and embroidered
velvet cape out of her Paris bedroom.
   Her career has gone from boardroom to bedroom and now to
ballroom. She entered the investment banking business in 1968 and
in 1976 became the first woman vice president of Merrill Lynch.
   ``I simply wanted to build my own business and fell into the
design field almost by accident,'' said Mrs. Natori, who grew up in
Manila.
   ``I was researching a business I could start based on Filipino
artisans' skills. So in 1977 a friend sent me some
Filipino-embroidered blouses.''
   A buyer at Bloomingdales saw a blouse and told Mrs. Natori,
``Make it into a nightshirt.''
   ``I ddn't even know what a nightshirt was,'' said Mrs. Natori.
But she was soon enthusiastically turning out nightshirts _ not to
mention sexy merry widows, bedjackets.
   She later expanded into embroidered ``mules,'' ballerina
slippers and appliqued bathroom linens, plus a line of toiletries.
   From an initial outlay of $10,000, her company has grown into a
$25 million business. Her husband of 17 years, Ken Natori, recently
quit his Wall Street job with a six-figure salary to help manage
the operation.
   ``I couldn't have done this without my family's support, though
they thought I was crazy to leave a good financial job,'' said Mrs.
Natori. She credits her father's acumen for her business flair and
her mother's artistic eye for her design talents.
   ``But women in the Philippines are strong managers, too,'' added
Mrs. Natori. ``My grandmother was nicknamed `Supreme Commander' and
my mother was `Commander in Chief.' ''
   Mrs. Natori was educated at a Catholic school in Manila, then
attended Manhattanville College in New York.
   Her first job at Bache and Co. in 1968 took her right back to
the Philippines to open a new office.
   Returning to New York, she was just into a new job with Merrill
Lynch in 1971 when she met her future husband. The Natoris now have
a 14-year-old son and what Mrs. Natori calls ``a rare work-and-home
relationship.''
   ``Paris is the `soul' side of me,'' said Mrs. Natori, who
manufactures both in the United States and the Philippines but
gravitates to the French capital.
   She opened her first free-standing shop at the prestigious Place
Vendome in Paris two years ago. ``And I come back for fashion
stimulation and relaxation whenever I can,'' she said.
   But she takes fashion with a grain of salt. ``There is too much
emphasis on categories, like sportswear, office wear, lingerie,''
she said.
   ``I'm primarily interested in making a good product that people
will buy, something that's different, that you can wear to dress up
at home or go out in,'' she said. ``That's the philosophy of my
clothes that have grown out of underwear.''
   She feels many high-style clothes are overpriced. Her recent
gold-embroidered velvet cape retails for about $1,200.
   She says her first fashion show will be modest, featuring just
60 select models, though she regularly turns out five lines a year
of about 350 pieces each.
   Can she draw? ``Yes, but I have seven assistants as well, and
our total staff is about 700.''
   Mrs. Natori is an accomplished pianist and on request, sat down
to execute a Chopin Nocturne on her Paris concert Steinway. Later
at a party for fashion people, she played musical comedy songs by
ear as her guests sang along.
   Her professional passion is business, not fashion, she said. ``I
can't take it too seriously. I design what I'd like to wear myself,
and hope it flies.''

   Baldheaded men and mothers who bear five or
more children develop blood cholesterol patterns that might raise
their risk of heart disease, according to studies released Friday.
   In a study of 872 electronics factory workers in Italy, Dr.
Maurizio Trevisan found blood cholesterol and blood pressure levels
rose with age among the 278 men with ``male-pattern baldness.''
They defined that as a receding hairline and a bald spot on the
crown of the head.
   The small but significant increases weren't found among the 321
men with full heads of hair or the 273 with receding hairlines but
not a balding crown, said Trevisan, an epidemiologist at the State
University of New York at Buffalo.
   The study, released at an American Heart Association meeting, is
``reason to lose one more hair,'' John Capps, founder of Baldheaded
Men of America, said by phone from Morehead City, N.C. ``Maybe we
need to put our heads together on it and work out a solution.''
   Trevisan and colleagues at the University of Naples plan
research on whether elevated cholesterol and blood pressure levels
actually make bald men more prone to heart attack and stroke.
   ``If these data are confirmed, they could be at higher risk,''
he said. ``Right now, I have no idea. ... These (elevated levels)
are not numbers that place these men in a very high-risk category
for developing coronary heart disease. But this may change as the
men age.''
   If elevated blood pressure and cholesterol also are found in
other populations, Trevisan's study would be considered ``a
breakthrough observation,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor,
chairwoman of community and family medicine at the University of
California, San Diego.
   Barrett-Connor co-authored the study of multiple pregnancies.
   In her study of 1,275 women in Rancho Bernardo, near San Diego,
she found that the women who had at least five pregnancies had a
nearly 8 percent drop in levels of high-density lipoprotein, which
is believed to protect against heart disease. There was no drop in
the so-called ``good'' cholesterol among women with fewer children.
   ``Pregnancy may be another risk for heart disease, but it does
not show up until five or more,'' said Barrett-Connor's colleague
Donna Kritz-Silverstein.
   Like the bald men, the women with five or more kids haven't been
followed long enough to know if they actually will develop higher
heart disease rates. They were studied for 10 years since their
most recent pregnancies.
   ``I'm not going to recommend women do family planning based on
this'' single study, said Barrett-Connor. ``I would tell a woman
who had five or more kids her HDL is the least of her troubles.''
   Kritz-Silverstein said, ``Several, but not all studies have
reported an increased risk of cardiovascular disease among women
who have been pregnant,'' and decreased high-density lipoprotein
levels may be one explanation.
   Also Friday, University of Iowa scientists said they found
sixth- through eighth-grade children had significantly lower
``good'' cholesterol levels if one or both parents smoked at home
daily or if the child chewed tobacco weekly or smoked cigarettes
monthly.
   Aside from lung disease, the possible heart disease link ``is
another reason for parents who smoke to think seriously about the
toxic effect their habit has on their children,'' said Dr. Paul
Pomrehn, the study's author.
   High-density lipoprotein, or HDL, hooks onto cholesterol in
blood, carrying the fatty substance to the liver for disposal so it
won't clog arteries and cause heart attacks and strokes.
   In the baldness study, all the men had similar cholesterol and
blood pressure levels when the research started in 1975, but those
with male-pattern baldness developed high levels as they grew older
and lost hair. By 1987, they averaged blood cholesterol levels of
214 milligrams per deciliter, compared with 208 for non-bald men
and men with only receding hairlines.
   Trevisan and Barrett-Connor speculated hormone changes
accompanying balding and pregnancy might cause the cholesterol
patterns they found. Those patterns existed even after accounting
for individual differences in age, weight and obesity, and
cigarette and alcohol consumption.

   Gunshots fired from the ground struck a
military helicopter on a medical flight today, injuring a doctor
aboard and prompting the craft to make an emergency landing,
authorities said.
   Three shots were fired about 11:30 a.m. at the Vermont Air
National Guard helicopter, which was on an emergency medical
mission to Massena, N.Y., said Lt. Lloyd Goodrow, National Guard
spokesman.
   There were five people on board, three military personnel and
two civilians, Goodrow said. The doctor was accompanying a patient
being taken from Massena Memorial Hospital to Vermont Medical
Center, said National Guard spokesman Jim Banks.
   The injured man, a medical resident from Vermont Medical Center
in Burlington, Vt., was shot in the neck and shoulder but his
injuries were not life-threatening, said Bart Hayes, emergency
department manager at Champlain Valley Physicians Hospital in
Plattsburgh.
   The helicopter landed along state Route 190 in the Clinton
County town of Altona, about 150 miles north of Albany, according
to state police. Massena is about 55 miles west of the crash site.
   The helicopter crew realized something was wrong with the craft
when an oil light went on, Goodrow said. The pilots, not
immediately realizing someone in the back of the copter had been
shot, decided to land as a precaution after seeing the oil pressure
fall.
   ``Obviously, somebody shot at a low-flying helicopter,'' said
Gen. Don Edwards of the Vermont Army National Guard. ``That's a
federal offense and the FBI will be investigating.''

   Soviet troops occupied Lithuania's
Prosecutor's Office today after its staff members refused to take
orders from a new chief prosecutor appointed by Moscow, Lithuanian
officials said.
   If the report is confirmed, it would be the first time Soviet
soldiers have taken control of a Lithuanian government building
since the Baltic republic defied Moscow and declared its
independence on March 11.
   The report came several hours after the White House announced
that President Bush had called for a peaceful resolution of the
Lithuanian crisis.
   The trouble began at the Prosecutor's Office earlier today when
Moscow officials fired Lithuania's chief prosecutor in a bid to
make the republic adhere to Soviet law, then tried to intall new
prosecutor of their choosing.
   The move failed when the office's employees said they would
remain loyal to their former boss. The dispute became a standoff,
with both chief prosecutors trying to run the office at the same
time.
   Several hours later, soldiers of the Soviet Interior Ministry
took over the building with the help of one employee, Egidius
Bickauskas, a Lithuanian legislator, said on the republic's
television. He did not elaborate.
   He accused the Soviet Union of violating the republic's
sovereignty.
   A Lithuanian Interior Ministry spokesman confirmed that Soviet
soldiers were inside the Prosecutor's Office. He also said the
soldiers had moved into the Institute of Party History.
   A foreign journalist who rushed to the scene said he saw a
truckload of Soviet Interior Ministry soldiers enter the building.
   Soldiers previously had occupied a handful of Communist Party
buildings in Lithuania, but today was the first time they
reportedly occupied a Lithuanian government building.
   Also today, the KGB pledged to protect Lithuanian citizens who
cooperate with it in enforcing Soviet law. The statement,
distributed by the Tass news agency, called illegal a resolution
passed Tuesday by Lithuania's legislature saying KGB ``informers''
risk being punished and having their names published.
   Before today's reported occupation, Moscow's tactics had
included shows of military force, the arrest of army deserters and
orders for foreigners to leave and for residents to turn in their
guns.
   In response to a Kremlin demand for a referendum, Lithuania on
Thursday offered to hold a public vote on whether to rejoin the
Soviet Union.
   The White House said today that President Bush sent a letter to
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev calling for a peaceful resolution in
Lithuania.
   The letter, sent via diplomatic channels on Thursday, stated
Bush's ``suppot and the American support for the aspirations of the
Lithuanian people for self-determination,'' presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``We have expressed our belief and our emphatic view that a
resolution of this conflict lies in peaceful dialogue,'' Fitzwater
said of the letter.
   On Thursday, the Lithuanian Prosecutor's Office ordered police
not to carry out Gorbachev's order to confiscate firearms that
citizens had not surrendered. Lithuanian police had already refused.
   The standoff began at the office when Moscow officials tried to
replace Arturis Paulauskas, the prosecutor appointed by the
Lithuanian government on March 22. Soviet Deputy Prosecutor Alexei
Vasiliev told more than 100 members of the Lithuanian prosecutor's
staff to execute Soviet law. He brought with him an ethnic
Lithuanian, Antanas Petrauskas, to replace Paulauskas.
   Tass later carried a statement from Soviet Prosecutor General
Alexander Sukharev firing Paulauskas and officially naming
Petrauskas as his successor.
   Staff members reacted during the meeting with angry questions.
   ``Do you know our government was elected legally?'' one employee
shouted.
   Bickauskas, the Lithuanian legislator, told the staff:
   ``I hope you will consider your place is in your offices under
the leadership of Mr. Paulauskas.'' Nearly everyone applauded as
they rose to leave the room and returned to their their desks.
   ``You must obey the orders of the general prosecutor of the
U.S.S.R.,'' Vasiliev said in a raised voice as people left. But his
appeal had little effect until the building was taken over later.
   Vasiliev told a handful of reporters after he was ignored that
his 11-member team from Moscow is ``not an instrument of force,''
and that his next step in the struggle would be a legal one. He
would not elaborate.
   Paulauskas, back in his office, said: ``I am the prosecutor of
Lithuania, and I will stay here until force is used against me.''
   Foreign reporters attended the meeting, although the press corps
in Vilnius has dwindled since Soviet authorities barred foreigners
from Lithuania and refused to extend permission to stay for
correspondents already there.
   Foreign journalists in the Soviet Union are all based in Moscow
and must get permission to travel outside the capital and state the
length of their stay. As their departure dates arrive, reporters
have been leaving Vilnius.
   Lithuania wants back the independence it enjoyed before being
crushed by the Soviet Union in 1940 along with the two other Baltic
republics of Estonia and Latvia. A Stalin-Hitler pact gave the
Soviets control over the republics.

   A train derailed and rammed the supports of
an aging viaduct today, causing part of the span to collapse and
injuring three people driving on a roadway over it, authorities
said.
   One of the injured, an unidentified 39-year-old woman, was in
fair condition with a chest injury, while the other two were
treated and released, said a St. Joseph's Hospital spokeswoman who
declined to give her name.
   Union Pacific spokesman John Bromley said two switching engines
were pulling nine cars when the third car, a covered grain hopper,
apparently derailed and struck the support of the Locust Street
bridge. At least one adjoining rail car also derailed.
   Locust Street is a two-lane street that goes mainly through an
industrial area. The accident occurred shortly before 11 a.m. about
two miles southwest of Eppley Airfield, the area's principal
commercial airport.
   About 250 feet of the bridge collapsed. Afterward, two railroad
cars were lying at an angle under the metal, concrete and aged
white wood of the bridge.
   Perry Soule, manager of Troll Auto Parts along the tracks, said
he heard a noise and ran outside, adding, ``It sounded like
thunder.''
   He said he helped put out a fire in one of the three cars on the
debris of the bridge. Rescue workers had to pry open the door of
one motorist's car, witnesses said.
   The accident occurred while during switching operations in
northern Omaha, said Alex Tice, a Union Pacific Railroad spokesman.
It was unclear what caused the derailment.
   ``We've got people out there right now,'' Tice said. ``None of
the train people are injured.''
   Lou Lamberty, Omaha public works director, said he thought the
bridge was built in 1916. It was last inspected in February 1989,
and discussions were under way to have it torn down and replaced by
a grade crossing.

   If it weren't for skin color, Little Richard
says, he _ not Elvis Presley _ could have reigned as the king of
rock 'n' roll.
   ``If I was white, do you know how huge I'd be?'' Little Richard
asks in the April 19 issue of Rolling Stone. ``I think Elvis was
more acceptable being white in that period. I believe if Elvis had
been black, he wouldn't have been as big as he was.''
   The rock pioneer, who recorded classics such as ``Tutti Frutti''
and ``Lucille,'' says he can recall being upstaged only once during
his flamboyant 43-year performing career. The man who did it: the
late Jimi Hendrix.
   ``He was my guitar player, and you know, we didn't know he could
play with his mouth. One night I heard this screaming and
hollering, and they were screaming and hollering for him!'' says
Richard. ``I thought they were screaming for me. But he was back
there playing the guitar with his mouth.''

   The newest member of British royalty, week-old
Princess Eugenie Victoria Helena, slept through the crowd's cheers
and clattering cameras Friday as she went home with her parents,
the Duke and Duchess of York.
   Buckingham Palace announced Princess Eugenie's name shortly
after the royal couple stepped from Portland Hospital with their
new princess, wrapped in a white blanket.
   Princess Eugenie is the sixth grandchild of Queen Elizabeth II
and sixth in the line of succession. She is the second daughter
born to the duchess and her husband, Prince Andrew.
   The 30-year-old Duchess of York, the former Sarah Ferguson, gave
birth to Princess Eugenie by Caesarean section on March 23. The
baby's name surprised Britain. Bookmakers said they had thousands
of bets but not one for Eugenie.
   It was the name of Queen Victoria's granddaughter, the daughter
of Princess Beatrice who was Victoria's fifth daughter and youngest
child. The baby's second name _ Victoria _ comes from Queen
Victoria herself, and the third name, Helena, comes from the third
daughter of Queen Victoria.
   Eugenie is the French derivative of the ancient Greek word
``Eugenia'' meaning ``nobility'' and ``excellence,'' and was made
fashionable in 19th- century France by the Empress Eugenie, wife of
Emperor Napoleon III, said David Williamson, co-editor of Debrett's
Peerage, a leading reference book on the aristocracy.

   Rhythm &amp; Blues singer Regina Belle says adopting a
newborn girl four months ago has thrown her headlong into the war
against drugs.
   Ms. Belle said having a child in her life made her realize that
other children needed someone to help them learn to say no to drugs.
   When she is not touring, Ms. Belle, 26, helps with a
fund-raising project in Harlem called the Children's Storefront
Program, which sends underprivileged children to college.
   ``I think the biggest problem in America today is not drugs;
it's misguidance, no guidance and illiteracy,'' said Ms. Belle,
whose current single ``Make It Like It Was'' is getting video play
on cable television.

   Americans could get smarter by watching
nothing but the Public Broadcasting Service on television, but
viewers prefer less intellectual programming, says entertainer
Steve Allen.
   In an interview published Friday to promote a performance in
Nashville, Allen said ``you'd have a more literate, intelligent
populace'' if television viewers tuned in only to PBS.
   But he said that most people ``when given a choice between true
quality and garbage ... are likely to head for the garbage.''
   He discussed television while commenting on his new book,
``Dumbth,'' which concerns what he calls the ineptitude of the
American citizen.
   Allen, 68, is a musician, comedian, songwriter, author and
former host of the ``Tonight'' show on NBC.

   Michael Eisner, the entertainment wizard
who's turned around the Walt Disney Co., should feel like a man on
top of the Matterhorn.
   Eisner didn't sound sky-high during a speech Thursday night at
the St. Mary's College 33rd annual Executives Symposium.
   ``How do I feel about all this good fortune?'' Eisner asked.
``In a word, panic.''
   In an interview published in Friday's Contra Costa Times,
Eisner, 48, said he rarely rests easy.
   ``We always think the sky is falling, that our last movie hit is
really going to be our last hit, period,'' said Eisner. ``I tend to
run scared. I always like to think that there are two outs in the
last of the ninth inning and we're three runs down.''
   Disney has to stay on its toes, Eisner said, because ``ours is
an unpredictable and often irrational business that generally
defies logic.
   ``There is no sure-fire formula for success in the entertainment
industry. But there are any number of interesting ways to fail,''
said Eisner, who became one of the highest-paid U.S. executives
when he became Disney's chairman in 1984.
   In the next decade, Disney intends to build second theme parks
in Southern California and Tokyo, expanding Disneyland in Anaheim
and Disney World in Florida and building a Euro Disneyland near
Paris.
   When the company's first European theme park is complete in
1992, Eisner said, a Disney ride will be operating somewhere in the
world every minute of every day.
   Other projects include a new record company, 15 network TV
pilots and a restaurant chain called Mickey's Kitchen. ``As I think
of all these developments, I get very excited,'' Eisner said.
``Just before the panic sets in.''

   An obsessed fan who once threatened to kill
herself in front of actress Sharon Gless holed up in the ``Cagney
and Lacey'' star's home with a rifle for seven hours today before
surrendering, authorities said.
   Joni Leigh Penn, 30, who had been under court order to stay away
from Miss Gless, was led from the house shortly after 10 a.m. and
placed in a police car. The actress was not at home at the time of
the incident.
   Ms. Penn gave herself up, police Capt. Dan Watson said, adding,
``She was tired. She was just kind of worn down.''
   He said a special weapons team went inside the house and
officers talked to the woman through the door of a bathroom in
which she barricaded herself. She was coherent throughout the
standoff and no shots were fired, Watson said.
   Ms. Penn had threatened to kill herself, but it was unclear
whether she also intended to harm the 46-year-old actress, Watson
said.
   She was being booked for investigation of felony burglary,
Watson said. The woman had been carrying a weapon resembling an
assault rifle, but Watson said the weapon recovered was an AT-22, a
.22-caliber rifle. He said the weapon was loaded.
   In November 1988, a judge ordered Ms. Penn to stay away from
Miss Gless, her homes and relatives. The previous month, Ms. Penn
reportedly went to Miss Gless' home and told the actress' secretary
she had a gun.
   She threatened to shoot herself in front of the actress,
according to a letter submitted to the Superior Court by Ms. Penn's
psychiatrist, Hubert Nestor.
   During 1988, Miss Gless received 20 letters from Ms. Penn.
   Obsessed fans have stalked many celebrities, including Johnny
Carson, David Letterman, Olivia Newton-John, Michael Landon and
Michael J. Fox. In the most serious Hollywood incidents, ``My
Sister Sam'' star Rebecca Schaeffer was shot to death last year and
actress Theresa Saldana was injured in a knifing eight years ago.
   Miss Gless, who won a best actress Emmy in 1987 for her role as
the tough police detective Christine Cagney, has a single-story
stucco house on a tree-lined cul-de-sac in Studio City. Homes in
the area about 15 miles north of downtown Los Angeles are valued at
about $300,000.
   Ten neighboring homes were evacuated as a precaution, but some
residents were allowed to return after police entered the Gless
house, officers said.
   Neighbor Sam Snider said the Gless home is protected by a
sliding gate but it would be easy to get inside anyway.
   ``Sharon's always so friendly. I don't know what difficulties
she would be having with this woman,'' said Snider.
   CBS on Wednesday announced that Miss Gless would reunite with
``Cagney and Lacey'' executive producer Barney Rosenzweig to create
a new dramatic series for the 1990-91 season tentatively titled
``Renewal.''
   The show is to deal with a woman in her early 40s who has been
through a difficult divorce and re-enters the work force.

<TEXT>
   A former Unisys Corp. employee under
investigation in the Pentagon procurement scandal of the 1980s
pleaded guilty Friday to a felony count of filing a false income
tax return.
   Frederick J. Carville of New Hartford, N.Y., entered the plea in
the Operation Ill Wind case before U.S. District Judge Claude M.
Hilton in Alexandria, Va.
   He could be sentenced to up to three years in prison and fined
$100,000.
   The plea resulted from negotiations between the U.S. attorney's
office and Carville's attorney, said Michael Costello, who heads
the Washington field office of the Defense Department's criminal
investigative service.
   Operation Ill Wind concerned allegations that defense
contractors and consultants bribed Pentagon officials to obtain
inside information that would give them a competitive advantage in
obtaining multimillion dollar contracts.
   The investigation began in the summer of 1986 but was not
revealed until June 1988 when federal agents executed dozens of
search warrants nationwide. Numerous companies and individuals have
pleaded guilty or have been convicted in the probe.
   Carville, a Unisys marketing representative, was responsible for
getting business for the company at the Rome Air Development Center
at Rome, N.Y., a government facility that does electronics
research, primarily for the Air Force.
   Costello said Carville and two other Unisys employees _ Charles
F. Gardner and Steven Monas _ ``came up with this sceme to try to
get contracts from the Rome Air Development Center. He (Carville)
was supposed to ingratiate himself with the employees at that
facility, so they gave him money'' to spend on entertainment for
the employees.
   ``He formed this company to funnel the money through so it
wouldn't be traceable to him,'' Costello said.
   The company was called Consul-Tech Inc., and Carville and his
wife were the sole shareholders and officers, according to
Costello. Carville also created BPD Enterprises, a partnership
consisting of his wife and three daughters.
   In a 1983 income tax return for Consul-Tech, Carville claimed
false deductions for consulting services provided by BPD and
falsely deducted expenses realted to a Jaguar automobile bought for
Monas, Costello said.
   Gardner, considered by prosecutors to be a major figure in the
Ill Wind investigation, was a Unisys vice president at its Great
Neck, N.Y., facility.
   He pleaded guilty a year ago to charges of bribing Pentagon
officials for inside information on contract bids and setting up a
slush fund to pay bribes and make illegal campaign contributions.
Gardner was sentenced in September to 32 months in prison and was
fined $40,000.
   Costello would not say whether Monas, the Air Force marketing
director for Unisys' Great Neck facility, was under investigation.

<HEAD>Study Says New Drug Treatment Can Reduce Paralysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Massive doses of a steroid drug given within
hours of a spinal cord injury can significantly reduce paralysis
for patients who previously had seemed beyond help, a government
study reported Friday.
   The study, conducted at 10 centers around the United States,
proved that the drug methylprednisolone was able to restore some
feeling and movement in virtually all spinal cord injury patients,
marking the first time that an effective treatment for such
paralyzing injuries has been found, federal officials said.
   ``We now know that paralysis after spinal cord injury can be
reduced by early treatment,'' said Michael B. Bracken, a professor
at the Yale University School of Medicine who directed the study.
``We were never certain about that before this study.''
   Clinical trials of the drug involved 487 spinal injury patients.
The study compared the results of 162 treated with
methylprednisolone with 154 treated with naloxone and 171 who
received a placebo.
   The results, said, Bracken, show that methylprednisolone is ``an
effective treatment for reducing some of the neurological damage of
a spinal injury.''
   Officials who monitored the study said its results could have an
important effect on the lives of some 10,000 Americans annually who
suffer acute spinal cord injury. Automobile accidents are the most
common source of such injuries.
   Most such injuries occur in men under the age of 30 and most
such patients will spend their lives permanently disabled.
   Methylprednisolone has been used for years to treat shock, to
prevent swelling of the brain from injury or stroke and to
stabilize membranes after injury. For the spinal injury study,
researchers at the clinical centers gave patients 10 to 100 times
the normal dosage within a 23-hour period.
   The result, said Bracken, is that virtually all patients
receiving the drug improved to some degree. The improvement was
significantly greater than for patients with similar injuries who
received other treatment.
   Bracken said the study results have been evaluated by reviewers
and will be published in May in the New England Journal of
Medicine. He said the announcement was made in advance of
publication in hopes that patients can benefit immediately.
   Federal officials said doctors may obtain information about
treatment with the drug by calling 301-496-5751 during working
hours. Weekends, the number to call is 800-633-3425.
   The drug works only if it is given within eight hours after a
spinal cord injury. About 95 percent of all spinal cord patients
are admitted to hospitals within eight hours, which means that most
can benefit from this therapy, Bracken said.
   Some patients in the study reported remarkable and unexpected
recovery from serious spinal injuries.
   In Phoenix, doctors credit the drug with saving Denise Shoblom,
owner of several Arizona broadcast outlets, from possible paralysis.
   Ms. Shoblom was taken to Kingman Regional Medical Center in
August 1989, following an auto accident. Doctors there injected
methylprednisolone on the recommendation of doctors at Barrow
Neurological Institute, one of the centers taking part in the
federal study.
   Just after the accident, Ms. Shoblom had no feeling in her
limbs, but she is now walking on her own and hopes to make a
complete recovery.
   ``Because this medication was given to her within eight hours of
her injury, she was able to recover much of her motor function,''
said Dr. Volker Sonntag of Barrow. ``If it hadn't been for this
medication, she might be completely paralyzed today.''
   Much of the improvement seen among patients receiving the
medication was much more subtle, Bracken said.
   Among quadriplegics, he said, the improvement might mean that a
patient would be able to use a hand that without the drug would
have been paralyzed. For those who might have had paralyzed legs,
said Bracken, the improvement could mean that they would be able to
transfer themselves from wheelchair to car, or that they would be
able to walk with crutches.
   Some, he said, were able to leave wheelchairs permanently.
   Precisely how the drug works is still not clear.
   Dr. William F. Collins, chairman of the surgery department at
Yale, said that medical science has long believed that the
paralyzing effects of spinal injuries actually occur only as an
indirect result of the trauma itself.
   He said it is believed that injured nerve cells release a
substance that damages adjacent cells and nerve fiber, causing
paralysis to set in.
   ``It's sort of a cascade that continues for several hours after
the injury,'' said Collins. Massive doses of methylprednisolone
``alters that cascade ... and then protects those adjacent cells
and fibers.''
   The study was supported by the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke, one of the National Institutes
of Health.
   The clinical centers taking part in the study were Yale
University School of Medicine, New Haven, Conn.; Medical University
of South Carolina, Charleston; New York University Bellevue Medical
Center, New York; University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston;
Baylor University College of Medicine, Houston; Barrow Neurological
Institute, Phoenix; University of California, San Diego; Harborview
Medical Center, Seattle; University of California, Davis, and
Allegheny General Hospital, Pittsburgh.

   It don't make no difference if
prosecutors go after criminals with indictments that use bad
grammar, the state's highest court said in a ruling that may help
perpetuate generations of language abuse by lawyers.
   Convicted arsonist Leon Corson Sr. said he should have been
cleared because the indictment against him was so poorly written
and ambiguous that it made no sense.
   The indictment returned by grand jurors in Piscataquis County
contained a 180-word sentence that takes up 14 lines on the page.
It said in part, that ``with the intent that conduct be performed
which, in fact, would constitute a crime or crimes,'' the fire in
question was set.
   The Maine Supreme Judicial Court's five justices did not buy
Corson's arguments, saying the indictment, ``even though
grammatically incorrect, adequately informs the defendant of the
nature of the charge against him.''
   This week's ruling came as no surprise to scholars of English,
who said Friday that lawyers are among the worst language offenders.
   ``A 180-word sentence should be taken out and be shot,'' said
Richard Lederer, a columnist and language author from Concord, N.H.
``It is disgraceful. They're trying to protect somebody's rights
and it's very tough to do with a 180-word sentence, even if it's
180 simple words.''
   At the University of Southern Maine, assistant professor of
English Willard Rusch said most lawyers should plead guilty to
using ``fossilized phrases in English that people don't use.''
   ``Sentences of that type are written according to outdated rules
of grammar, and they're difficult for people to understand,'' Rusch
said. ``Possibly, the person has a real good complaint.''
   The justices didn't see it that way, although they pointed out
that Maine law insists an indictment ``shall be a plain, concise
and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting
the offense charged.''
   That may well be too much to ask of lawyers.
   They often use complex sentences decorated with such phrases as
``to wit,'' ``whereas,'' and ``aforementioned,'' as well as
numerous bits of Latin, in an attempt to show they are a special,
educated class of people, scholars say.
   ``They won't call a spade a spade,'' Lederer said. ``They call
it an excavation device. It sometimes sounds more important.''
   Anyone who winds up being indicted with such confusing language
can always get it translated into regular English, but the
translation will come from yet another lawyer, he said.

   Bridges died of emphysema at his San Francisco home, said Danny
Beagle, spokesman for the Longshoremen's Union.
   Bridges led the Longshoremen's Union on the West Coast from 1934
through 1977. He first came to prominence in the dock workers'
walkout that led to a bloody general strike in San Francisco in
July 1934.
   He was the subject of numerous deportation attempts by the

   The prosecutor at John Poindexter's
Iran-Contra trial said today in closing arguments that evidence
against the former national security adviser is overwhelming and
that Poindexter directed Oliver North to lie to Congress.
   But Poindexter's defense attorney told the jury that Poindexter
was a victim caught in a ``political battle'' between Congress and
the White House and was not part of a coverup conspiracy.
   Poindexter is accused of concealing from Congress North's secret
military assistance to the Contras and the U.S. role in a November
1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. His case is expected to go
to the jury next week, after four weeks of testimony.
   In his closing arguments today, prosecutor Dan Webb said the
jury must convict Poindexter ``because the boss can't escape legal
responsibility just because he didn't get his hands dirty.''
   Webb said Poindexter ``generally instructed'' North to go to a
meeting with congressmen and lie by denying he was assisting the
Contras militarily.
   North ``was there because the defendant on trial in this case,
his commander, sent him there to do that,'' said Webb.
   But Poindexter's attorney, Richard Beckler, told the jurors that
``the only real victim as a result of this political battle is
Admiral John Poindexter.''
   Poindexter did ``his ever-loving best to give as much
information as he could tell'' to Congress, said the lawyer.
   Poindexter was not part of ``some grimy little conspiracy'' as
the prosecution ``would have you believe,'' said Beckler. ``He was
working for the president of the United States.''
   Webb said that if the jurors sat in 1,000 cases, they would
``never find evidence more powerful and more convincing. ... It is
overwhelming.''
   The defense witnesses included former President Reagan, who Webb
said ``didn't have the slightest clue whether John Poindexter did
or did not participate'' in the crimes he is accused of committing.
   A presidential document which Poindexter tore up ``is the one
document that puts the lie'' to a speech Reagan gave on Nov. 13,
1986, Webb said. In it, Reagan asserted that ``we did not ... trade
weapons ... for hostages.''
   ``You don't lie to the American public,'' Webb said of Reagan.
The prosecutor at one point tore up a copy of the document in front
of the jury to dramatize what Poindexter had done.
   Poindexter destroyed the document hours after telling Congress
on Nov. 21, 1986, that the president hadn't approved a shipment of
Hawk missiles to Iran in November 1986. The document signed by
Reagan, called a finding, depicted a swap of arms for hostages.
   In two days of videotaped testimony, Reagan was questioned by
defense attorney Beckler about his various meetings with foreign
leaders in support of the Nicaraguan Contras.
   ``For the life of me I could not understand what that had to do
with the issues in this case,'' said Webb.
   Webb said he became ``a little bit angry'' when Reagan winked at
Poindexter during his testimony, as if to say ``did that last
answer help you John?''
   ``I would have expected more of a former president,'' said Webb.
   Webb said the defense had engaged in a ``scatter gun, let's
throw mud against the wall, let's see what happens'' approach.
   ``That type of defense insults your intelligence,'' Webb told
the jury.
   When the defense rested Tuesday after calling 15 witnesses, Webb
called no rebuttal witnesses for the government.
   ``There was nothing to rebut,'' said Webb.
   North, whose 3{ days of testimony was the centerpiece of the
case against Poindexter, ``was right in the middle of it,'' said
the prosecutor.
   Granted immunity from prosecution, North ``had to go on the
witness stand whether he wanted to or not,'' said Webb.
   North testified reluctantly against the former national security
adviser. He said he watched his boss tear up the presidential
document that ratified the Hawks shipment to Iran.

<HEAD>Indictments Cloud New England Mob Picture</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The time is ripe for would-be mobsters
to think about succeeding New England's reputed crime boss, the
jailed Raymond J. ``Junior'' Patriarca, law enforcement officials
say.
   A humiliating roundup began Monday with the arrests of Patriarca
and 14 other mob figures in Rhode Island, Connecticut and
Massachusetts. By Thursday, 21 organized crime figures were in
custody in connection with the case.
   Law enforcement officials sayd any and all organized crime is
evil, but most agree that mob activity in New England is penny-ante
compared to families elsewhere on the East Coast.
   ``At the risk of being labeled a New Yorker, New York is the
center of the Cosa Nostra. There are five (families) here,'' said
Ron Goldstock, director of the New York State Organized Crime
Commission.
   ``The Boston family tends to be way behind the New York families
as far as the size, scope of criminal activities and
sophistication,'' he said.
   ``My understanding is that it's a much smaller scale operation
but it's still lucrative,'' said Michael Davitt of the Organized
Crime Strike Force assigned to the U.S. Attorney's office in
Providence.
   FBI agents held the roundup with 113-count indictments, with
charges that included murder, racketeering, kidnapping, gambling,
drug trafficking, obstruction of justice and witness intimidation.
   ``If those convictions (hold up), they will have decimated the
Cosa Nostra family in the New England area,'' said Goldstock, who
also teaches law at Cornell Law School.
   The Providence-based crime family used to wield power under
Raymond L.S. Patriarca, Junior's father, and that power diminished
after the elder Patriarca's death in 1984, authorities said.
   ``I think Ray Senior acted as sort of a mob diplomat and
resolved disputes in Connecticut,'' Davitt said. ``In doing so (New
England organized crime) gained more of a national reputation.''
   Even if someone from New York City moved in _ reputed Gambino
crime family boss John Gotti has been mentioned _ gaining a
foothold in New England still wouldn't carry the same weight as
having a resident family, Goldstock said.
   ``It will certainly reduce ... the capability of the family to
inflict harm on society,'' he said.
   The contenders in Patriarca's family include Edward ``Mulligan''
Romano, William ``Billy Blackjack'' Delsanto, and Luigi ``Baby
Shanks'' Manocchio, authorities said. All have been with the family
since the elder Patriarca's regime:
   _Manocchio, whose 1968 murder convictions in the gangland
slayings of Rudolph Marfeo and Anthony Melei were overturned by the
state Supreme Court, seems to be factored out because of his low
profile, authorities said.
   _Delsanto, a former Providence city worker who was accused of
accepting paychecks as a no-show worker; the charges were dropped
because the state took too long to bring him to trial.
   _Romano, reputedly the only capo, or captain, in the Patriarca
family to escape indictment.
   ``They're the over-the-hill gang,'' said John Partington,
Providence's public safety commissioner, who helped set up the
original federal witness protection program to assist mob
investigations when he worked for the U.S. Marshal's Service in the
mid-1960s.
   South Kingstown Police Chief Vincent Vespia, a principal mob
investigator during 22 years in the state police, said law
enforcement officials will have to watch the streets to determine
what is going on with the Patriarca family.
   ``Traditionally, when mob bosses went to jail ... they get
pretty well reorganized. You can't put a gag on them,'' Vespia
said. ``I question whether Raymond, with the embarrassment here,
can operate very strongly from prison.''
   Partington said if the younger Patriarca's legal problems
persist, bosses in New York would want to install their own man,
but nothing will happen immediately. He said the New York crime
families are tied closely to New England.
   ``Out of due respect for his father, Junior is going to stay
until something happens in court,'' he said. ``I'm sure there are
meetings in New York about what's going to happen in Rhode Island
and New England.''

<TEXT>
   Sister Thea Bowman, a nun who battled
cancer to continue her lifelong devotion to educating and
evangelizing blacks and promoting the cause of women in the Roman
Catholic church, died Friday. She was 52.
   She died at her Canton home after lapsing into a coma Thursday,
a church spokesman said. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in
1985 and had to use a wheelchair after the disease spread to her
bones.
   The granddaughter of a slave, Sister Bowman was a lecturer,
evangelist, poet and singer.
   The only black member of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual
Adoration, Sister Bowman served as director of intercultural
awareness of the Jackson Diocese and was on the faculty of the
Institute of Black Catholic Studies at Xavier University in New
Orleans.
   ``She was an outstanding woman,'' said Bishop Joseph Houck of
the Diocese of Jackson. ``She was proud of her heritage and totally
dedicated to the vision of Jesus Christ for love and growth of all
people.''
   Houck said that despite pain and cancer treatments, Sister
Bowman maintained a taxing schedule of rallies, lectures, workshops
and singing engagements.
   Sister Bowman was to receive the Laetare Medal, the oldest and
most prestigious award given to U.S. Catholics, at Notre Dame's
commencement exercises May 20. She will receive the award
posthumously, the university said Friday.
   She received numerous honors for her pioneering work in
encouraging black Catholics to express their cultural roots inside
the church.
   Her 1988 album ``Sister Thea: Songs of My People'' was 15 black
spirituals that made her popular at conventions across the country.
   Last year, the Sister Thea Bowman Black Catholic Educational
Foundation was established to provide financial support for black
students in Catholic primary and elementary schools and Catholic
colleges and universities.
   A funeral Mass is scheduled for Tuesday at St. Mary Catholic
Church in Jackson with burial at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis, Tenn.

<HEAD>Whistleblower Fired from Army Arsenal Ordered Reinstated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ordered reinstatement of a government
whistleblower who was fired after he revealed unsafe practices at
the Army's Rock Island Arsenal.
   Charles ``Curt'' McRae, a pilot fired two years after he turned
in his supervisors, also will receive back pay under the order
filed Thursday by Administrative Law Judge Phillip N. Miller.
   Miller said McRae's appeal to the Merit System Protection Board
had supported his allegation that his firing was in reprisal for
activity protected under a federal law that protects whistleblowers.
   The decision by Miller will become final on May 3 unless a party
to the matter appeals to the merit board, or the board decides to
reopen the case.
   ``I am very happy, I mean very happy, that the judge looked at
all the facts and ruled in our favor,'' McRae said in a telephone
interview Friday from his home.
   McRae said he had at times doubted he would be vindicated in the
battle with his superiors at the northern Illinois base.
   ``This will kind of reaffirm that if you're willing to wait and
be persistent, the system will work, yes,'' McRae said.
   McRae, who has been looking for other work, said he wants to go
back to his military job, but would report violations again if he
saw them.
   Al Schwartz, an Army spokesman at the arsenal, said there was no
immediate decision on how the agency would proceed.
   ``We have received Judge Miller's decision and at this time we
are reviewing it in detail. Once we have completed our review we
will determine what our action will be,'' Schwartz said.
   McRae's reinstatement is retroactive to Nov. 29, 1989, the date
he appealed his firing.
   At hearings held two weeks ago in Rock Island, McRae said he
complained and went over aviation chief Neil Pobanz's head after
Pobanz repeatedly ignored pilots' complaints about poor aircraft
maintenance and unsafe practices.
   McRae was hired as a pilot for the arsenal in 1982. He was fired
Nov. 17, 1989, more than two years after he reported mishandling of
dangerous chemicals and explosives, among other flight-safety
violations.
   A month after he made his complaints in September 1987, McRae
was grounded by Pobanz.
   Acting on McRae's tip, Army investigators found assorted
violations, including failure to report aircraft mishaps,
transportation of unauthorized personnel, failure to notify the
airport of hazardous cargo and falsification of officials documents.

   A teen-age Phantom of the Opera lived for six
months above the stage of his high school auditorium in a secret
apartment equipped with a television, videocassette recorder and
microwave oven, police said.
   Police discovered Robert Davis' living arrangements on Monday
when they saw someone using a key sneak into the auditorium at John
H. Francis Polytechnic High School in suburban Sun Valley.
   ``Maybe he was like `The Phantom of the Opera' _ hiding here,
hiding there,'' Detective Oscar Carballo said, adding he'd lived
there about six months. ``I just don't understand how he could be
living there without anyone knowing it.''
   Officers found Davis, 18, a student at the school, and three
visiting students inside the living area equipped with a bed,
refrigerator, telephone and heater, police said.
   Davis fled but was arrested the next day. The other three youths
were captured inside the school, officials said.
   All were booked for investigation of burglary, Carballo said.
Many items furnishing the apartment apparently had been taken from
the school, police said.
   Principal Virginia A. Holt said staff members knew someone with
a key was entering rooms and taking things, such as the microwave
oven, but they did not know about the apartment. She refused to
release further information about the boy.
   Sun Valley is a San Fernando Valley community about 20 miles
northwest of downtown.

<HEAD>Simpson Blasts `Shoddy and Confounding' Report on Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate conservative on Friday attacked as
``shoddy'' a report that hiring discrimination has become
``widespread'' as a result of a 4-year-old immigration law while
liberal lawmakers defended that assessment.
   ``You can fancy dan this baby all over the place, you can double
speak like you did in your conclusions, (but) you really can't get
away with that,'' Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., told officials of the
General Accounting Office.
   Simpson's remark that the accounting office did ``a shoddy and
confounding job of analysis here'' came at a Senate Judiciary
Committee hearing at which the accounting office officials reported
on their finding of widespread hiring discrimination caused by the
1986 Immigration Control and Reform Act.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said it appeared that the
report was correct. ``The GAO report confirms exactly what many of
us in Congress feared when employer sanctions were enacted in 1986
_ that sanctions would be discriminatory against Hispanic-American
citizens, Asian-American citizens and other ethnic minorities ...''
   ``The GAO report must be immediately addressed by Congress,''
Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., told the committee. ``... This report
documents some of the most serious levels of discrimination. Some
of our worst fears have been realized.''
   Both sides in the dispute said that any discrimination in hiring
is wrong and added that changes are needed in the nation's
immigration laws, although they were not in agreement on precisely
what should be done.
   Perhaps 10 percent of 4.6 million employers projected
statistically by the report are engaging in discrimination against
``foreign looking'' or ``foreign sounding'' job applicants,
according to the GAO, a congressional investigative arm.
   The report said the bias is being practiced by employers who are
confused about the law, which provides for civil and criminal
penalties for those who knowingly hire foreign workers who are in
this country illegally.
   The law was designed to curb the flow of illegal aliens over the
southern border in search of American jobs. At the time it was
passed, a number of lawmakers expressed fear that the employer
penalties, or ``sanctions,'' would lead to discrimination against
eligible workers.
   Critics inserted in the law a requirement calling on the GAO to
study that question and report back to Congress. The report was
made public on Thursday.
   The 10 percent estimate was used in the report to justify the
use of ``widespread'' to describe the amount of discrimination
caused by the law. That finding in turn could lead to repeal of the
employer sanctions provision.
   Simpson and GAO officials led by Comptroller General Charles
Bowsher became snarled in a battle of statistics, with the senator
saying the report itself showed only 6.6 percent of employers
discriminating. The GAO said the correct number should be 10
percent.

   The years of separation never drove
Larry Hyre's 1967 Corvette Stingray from his heart. Still, he never
expected to see it again after it was stolen in 1971.
   Hyre, an Atlanta attorney who grew up in Parkersburg, was
astounded recently to learn that police had found the car earlier
this month.
   ``It's like an old friend you haven't seen in 19 years,'' he
said.
   Hyre, now 42, bought the car in 1969 with money he earned from
summer jobs. It was stolen two years later, while he was attending
law school at West Virginia University.
   Sheriff's deputies in Henry County, Ohio, found the blue
Stingray while helping with the foreclosure of an investment
company that specialized in old Corvettes, Sheriff John Nye said
Thursday.
   Police tracked down Hyre's parents, Ruth and Kermit, who still
held the car's insurance and registration papers.
   Hyre drives a Mercedes these days, but he wouldn't consider
giving up the Corvette again.
   ``It's got too many memories. It went to all the Pitt and Penn
State away games,'' Hyre said. ``It was quite a car for a college
student to have, especially in those days.''

   It was just going to be a beheading. But looking
at the potbellied, sculpted figure of the previous champion weight
loser, Guinness officials said Friday the whole body would probably
have to go.
   Michael Hebranko, 35, of Brooklyn _ who now holds that title _
heaved a sigh of relief. ``I hate that T-shirt and that
underwear,'' he said.
   Hebranko recently wrested the World's Champion Slimmer title
from William J. ``Happy Humphrey'' Cobb of Georgia by losing 687
pounds in 24 months. Cobb lost 582 pounds in 32 months.
   Guinness Book of World Record officials like to keep things
exact, so they planned on replacing Cobb's sculpted head at their
Empire State Building museum with one of Hebranko. The rest of the
body _ that of a potbellied man wearing a green sleeveless T-shirt
and polka-dot boxer shorts _ was going to stay.
   But that's just not Hebranko.
   What would he like his monument to look like? ``Patrick
Swayze,'' he said. Failing that, Hebranko said, ``I hope they at
least change the underwear.''
   Hebranko lost the weight under the supervision of diet guru
Richard Simmons and medical doctors from St. Luke's-Roosevelt
Hospital.
   His former 115-inch waist is now a svelte 38. His weight has
dropped from 905 and now hovers between 212 and 220.

<HEAD>Baker Says Fine for Jews to Live in East Jerusalem</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James Baker III, addressing
supporters of Israel in Congress, said Jews have the right to live
both in East and West Jerusalem.
   Writing to Rep. Mel Levine, D-Calif., Baker sought to lay to
rest a flap prompted by President Bush's comments earlier this
month.
   At a news conference in Palm Springs, Calif., Bush said the
United States does not believe there should be new Jewish
settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank or in East Jerusalem.
The eastern section of the city was captured by Israel from Jordan
in the 1967 Mideast war and then annexed to the western part of the
holy city.
   The United States and most countries refuse to recognize the
united city as the Israeli capital, saying Jerusalem should remain
undivided but the question of its sovereignty must be determined in
Arab-Israeli negotiations.
   In his letter, parts of which were made available to The
Associated Press, Baker said he was ``very aware of the great
significance which Jerusalem has for the Jewish people as well as
for people of all religions.''
   ``Clearly, Jews and others can live where they want _ East or
West _ and the city must remain undivided,'' Baker said.
   Israel supporters hailed his comments as heralding a softening
of the U.S. position on the touchy issue. ``We are heartened by
this important clarification,'' said the World Jewish Congress.
   State Department officials said there was no change in the U.S.
position. Still, previous statements, the most recent one issued by
the White House on March 9, have spoken about the right of Jews to
live in all parts of Jerusalem ``in the context of a negotiated
settlement.''
   Baker's letter dropped that condition.
   Bush's unprecedented statement, equating Jewish settlement in
the West Bank with that in East Jerusalem, helped set off a
political crisis in Israel that led to the fall of the government
of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.
   It also generated a host of letters to Baker from members of
Congress, including Levine, concerned that U.S. support for Israel
might be eroding.
   In more than two decades of U.S. diplomacy, Jerusalem and the
West Bank have been approached as separate issues. Jerusalem is
touchier, and American presidents and secretaries of state have
tried to keep their distance from the issue.

   President Bush said Friday the United States
will explore the possibility of broad international cooperation in
the exploration of space.
   A White House statement said Bush had decided that Europe,
Canada, Japan and the Soviet Union, as well as other nations, would
be engaged in ``an exploratory dialogue'' about participating in
U.S. space initiatives.
   Bush has set long-range goals for completion of a manned space
station, returning permanently to the Moon and sending a manned
expedition to Mars.
   The statement said the dialogue with other countries will be
based on guidelines to be developed soon by the National Space
Council, led by Vice President Dan Quayle. ``The exploratory
dialogue will focus solely on conceptual possibilities for
cooperation,'' the statement said.

<HEAD>FBI Breaks National Pyramid Scheme</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 28,000 people in 21 states and
Canada were bilked in a pyramid scheme that offered to turn a $105
investment into a $46,700 profit, the FBI said Friday.
   Four people have been arrested on fraud and other charges lodged
in a 13-count indictment issued by a federal grand jury. The
indictment, handed up March 21, was unsealed after all four were
arrested.
   The victims of the 3{-year scheme ``were just ordinary people,''
said FBI agent Ron Halter.
   The investment scheme, run out of Charlotte, N.C., used the
names The Circles of Light Church, the Woman Man God Program,
Winner's Marketing Group, Creative Solutions and the WMG Program,
the indictment said.
   The investigation began after victims notified the Pennsylvania
Attorney General's Office and the Bureau of Consumer Protection,
said FBI spokesman John Kundts.
   Arrested this week were Robert E. Graven, 49, of Knoxville,
Tenn.; James F. Foley Jr., 28, of Warren, Ohio; Gregory A. Long,
32, and Cherie S. Long, 20, both of Raleigh, N.C.
   The four were held without bail in federal prisons on charges of
mail fraud, wire fraud, interstate transportation of stolen
property, conspiracy and money laundering both nationally and
internationally, authorities said.
   The proceeds of the alleged scheme, totaling $1.4 million, could
be forfeited to the federal government if the four are convicted,
the indictment says.
   The defendants are accused of operating a fraudulent scheme
between October 1986 and March 21, mostly in the eastern United
States, requiring participants to pay $105 in hopes of making
$46,720. Each participant was required to recruit two others, and
the expanding base of investors was supposed to provide the payoff
for people who joined earlier.
   They are accused of laundering money through the First American
Bank in Plymouth, Montserrat, in the British West Indies, to the
First Community Bank in Columbus, Ohio, and then to other banks in
the country.
   If convicted, each of the four could receive sentences up to 105
years in prison and fined $3.75 million.
   In April 1989, the state Consumer Protection agency successfully
sued the Circles of Light Church to stop the group from operating
in Pennsylvania. The FBI and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service
began an investigation, which was later joined by Britain's New
Scotland Yard.
   The FBI has identified victims in Alabama, Arizona, California,
Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan,
New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina,
Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and
Wisconsin. Others have been found in the Canadian provinces of
British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.

<TEXT>
   Farmers say they intend to boost corn
plantings to 74.8 million acres this spring, up 4 percent from last
year and the most since 1986, the Agriculture Department said
Friday.
   Soybean plantings are expected to drop 2 percent to 59.4 million
acres, the department's Agricultural Statistics Board said. Except
for last year, 1990 soybean plantings still would be the largest
since 1986.
   Total wheat plantings for the 1990 harvest, including winter
wheat planted last fall and spring-planted varieties, were forecast
at about 77.6 million acres, up 1 percent from last year.
   According to USDA records, the all-wheat acreage would be the
largest since 79.2 million acres were planted for the 1989 harvest.
   The 1990 winter wheat crop was reported planted on 57.2 million
acres, up 4 percent from a year ago. But durum wheat planted this
spring was indicated at 3.35 million acres, down 12 percent. Other
types of spring wheat were estimated at 17 million acres, down 4
percent from last year.
   Farmers have been encouraged by relatively strong corn and wheat
prices, as well as an easing of acreage requirements under federal
commodity programs. In the case of soybeans, however, record world
oilseed production has reduced prices from last season.
   The 1990 planting figures were based on an annual March survey
of approximately 75,000 farmers to help determine how much land may
be used for crops this year.
   No production estimates were provided in the report. The
department's first estimate of winter wheat production will be
issued May 10, and the first all-wheat figures July 12. The first
corn and soybean production estimates will be released Aug. 9.
   The acreage report also indicated that farmers will plant more
cotton, rice, peanuts, tobacco and dry edible beans. Declines were
reported for sorghum, barley, oats and hay.
   Officials cautioned that the actual crop acreages planted by
farmers this year ``may vary from intentions because of the effects
of weather, availability of production inputs, changes in market
conditions prior to planting'' and the impact of the report itself.
   Other crops included in the survey report were:
   _Cotton plantings, 12.4 million acres, up 17 percent from 1989.
   _Sorghum, 11.5 million acres, down 9 percent.
   _Barley, 8.89 million acres, down 3 percent.
   _Oats, 11 million acres, down 9 percent.
   _Hay, 62 million acres for harvest, down 2 percent.
   _Rice, 2.9 million acres, up 6 percent.
   _Peanuts, 1.71 million acres, up 3 percent.
   _Tobacco, 731,000 acres, up 6 percent.
   _Dry edible beans, 2.07 million acres, up 11 percent.

   Gen. Carl Vuono, the Army chief of staff, has
postponed a week-long trip to the Soviet Union that was scheduled
to begin next week, a Pentagon spokeswoman said on Friday.
   ``It just was felt that it isn't a good time to go,'' said
spokeswoman Maj. Kathy Wood, in an apparent reference to the
difficulties that have arisen in recent weeks between the Soviet
Union and Lithuania.
   The Baltic republic declared independence from Moscow on March
11.
   The four-star general had been slated to leave Saturday for
Helsinki, Finland, and travel on Monday to Moscow. Visits to Kiev
and Leningrad were also on the schedule, Wood said.
   The decision to put off the trip was made by Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney, Secretary of State James Baker and Vuono, Wood said.
   ``His trip has been postponed. It hasn't been cancelled. We hope
that he'll eventually go,'' Wood said.
   The visit was part of the ongoing military exchanges that were
started under the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Adm. William Crowe.

<TEXT>
   The State Department has urged Chinese
authorities not to export medium-range missiles, but a spokesman
said Friday he was unable to offer firm assurances that China has
not engaged in such transactions.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher refused to characterize the
Chinese position other than to note that China has pledged to
pursue a ``prudent and responsible attitude.''
   ``You are all well aware of the importance we attach to stopping
missile proliferation. Our dialogue with Beijing on missile
proliferation continues,'' he said.
   The New York Times reported in Friday's editions that Under
Secretary of State Reginald Bartholomew was unable to elicit
assurances from China's ambassador during a meeting last month that
the country will not sell medium-range missiles to the Middle East.
   Boucher said administration officials have placed particular
emphasis on the risks involved in missile sales to the Middle East
and on missiles with a range of at least 300 kilometers and with a
payload of at least 500 kilograms.
   ``Beijing has said that it will follow a prudent and responsible
attitude and we will look for actions consistent with that
statement,'' Boucher said.
   He said the administration had been unable to confirm media
reports suggesting that China has resumed missile sales to the
Middle East.
   The most recent reports said Western diplomats believe China is
selling missiles to a Middle East country but that those missiles
have a shorter range than those about which the administration has
expressed concern.
   China has dismissed the report as a rumor.

   A 250-foot section of a bridge collapsed
Friday after it was struck by a derailed Union Pacific train,
spilling three cars from the viaduct and injuring three people,
authorities said.
   A man and two women were treated for injuries. One of the women,
age 46, was extricated from her car and admitted to St. Joseph
Hospital in fair condition with chest injuries after the 10:55 a.m.
collapse of the Locust Street bridge, authorities said.
   Identities of the three people injured were withheld pending
notification of relatives, said police Investigator Milo Mally.
   Two switching engines were pulling nine cars on the freight
train when the third car, a covered grain hopper, apparently
derailed and struck a pillar that supported the 74-year-old
viaduct, said John Bromley, a Union Pacific spokesman.
   None of the train crew was injured, authorities said .
   The bridge, which crosses about 40 feet above the tracks in an
industrial area, held three cars when it collapsed, authorities
said. Two cars landed upright on debris atop two derailed freight
cars; the third was upright near the end of the collapsed section.
   Bromley said the train was going 8 mph when it struck the
bridge. He said railroad officials were trying to determine what
caused the derailment.
   The railroad had been discussing removing the bridge with the
city, Bromley said. The bridge had been cited for structural
deficiencies in 1974 and was closed for three months for repairs in
1977, the Omaha World-Herald reported.

<TEXT>
   Lithuania's chief prosecutor sat in the
conference hall, his cheeks flush with anger, as the Soviet Union's
deputy prosecutor informed the staff that from now on Moscow's man
was their boss.
   Sandy-haired Arturis Paulauskas, 37, appointed a week earlier by
the Lithuanian government, listened silently to Friday's statement
by Soviet deputy prosecutor Alexei Vasiliev.
   The incident was the first attempt by Soviet officials to take
direct control of a Lithuanian government agency since the Baltic
republic's parliament declared independence on March 11.
   After Vasiliev read his statement, the employees began shouting
and arguing with him.
   One employee stood up and declared that the Soviet Constitution
``says every republic has the right to sovereignty.''
   The rest of the staff broke into loud applause.
   ``Questions of that kind must be solved in a constitutional
way,'' Vasiliev countered.
   But another Lithuanian employee took the argument one step
further with a reference to the Soviet annexation of Lithuania in
1940. ``Do you think 1940 was solved in a constitutional way?'' he
shouted.
   Vasiliev maintained that ``the general prosecutor of the
U.S.S.R. has the right to name any prosecutor he wants.''
   Vasiliev named Antanas Petrauskas, an ethnic Lithuanian, to
replace Paulauskas. He also ordered the legal staff of almost 100
to carry out Soviet law.
   Staff members reacted to the replacement with angry questions.
   ``Do you know our government was elected legally?'' one told
Vasiliev.
   Another staffer stood up and asked: ``What will the prosecutor
of the U.S.S.R. do if 90 percent of the prosecutorial staff leaves
their jobs?''
   ``I would not like to guess,'' Vasiliev said.
   Lithuanian legislator Egidius Bickauskas coldly told Vasiliev he
should remember he was currently on the sovereign territory of
Lithuania, and not in the U.S.S.R.
   ``You can occupy this building with the help of paratroopers,
but that occupation will be different from the occupation of party
buildings,'' he said, referring to the occupation by Soviet
paratroopers of at least five Communist party buildings this week.
   ``I can't ask him (Vasiliev) to leave this room,'' Bickauskas
went on, addressing the workers. ``But I hope you will consider
your place is in your offices, under the leadership of Mr.
Paulauskas.''
   At that, almost everyone in the room applauded, got up and left.
   ``You must obey the orders of the general prosecutor of the
U.S.S.R.,'' Vasiliev said in a raised voice as people left.
   Vasiliev told several reporters afterward that his 11-member
team from Moscow is ``not an instrument of force.'' He said his
next step in the dispute would be a legal one, but he would not
elaborate.
   Paulauskas, back in his office, said: ``I am the prosecutor of
Lithuania, and I will stay here until force is used against me.''
   He said he had looked up the relevant Soviet law and figured his
defiance to Moscow could only be punished by a maximum of three
years in prison.
   He said he considered it likely he would be barred from the
building on Monday and implied he might move the office's
operations to a different site.
   When the prosecutor's secretary, Henrika Pocei, was asked who
she worked she paused and said, ``I think I have to go home.''
   But she added: ``It'll be really interesting on Monday _
payday.''

<HEAD>West Coast Dock Union Leader Dies At Age 88</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto FX2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY MARQUEZ</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legendary labor leader Harry Bridges, whose
battle to found the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's
Union set the stage for unionization of West Coast docks, died
Friday of emphysema. He was 88.
   Bridges died at his San Francisco home, said union spokesman
Danny Beagle.
   The crusty union leader, who first came to prominence when a
dockworkers' walkout led to a bloody general strike in San
Francisco in 1934, was once labeled a communist by the federal
government. Authorities tried repeatedly to throw him out of the
country for alleged communist activities, and he once was jailed
for 20 days as a communist conspirator.
   The son of a prosperous Australian real estate man, Bridges led
the ILWU from 1934 to 1977, pushing it to a position of supremacy
on West Coast docks.
   The union's success in the 1934 strike inspired formation of
dockworkers' unions from San Diego to Seattle, and it now extends
nationwide.
   ``He was really the guy who set in motion the whole
reorganzation of labor in the 1930s in the West Coast,'' said
Beagle. ``He was a very interesting, powerful person.''
   On July 5, 1934, two dock workers were killed and 100 wounded
when 1,000 police officers clashed with 5,000 dock workers and
sympathizers in San Francisco.
   The California National Guard was called out, and the lean,
hawk-faced Bridges plunged San Francisco into a general strike 11
days later. The strike ended after three days with an agreement on
a contract that established a union-operated rather than
employer-run hiring hall on the docks.

<HEAD>Indian Rebel Organization Agrees to Disarm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Indian rebel group Yatama has
agreed to disarm and demobilize before Nicaragua's new government
takes office next month, the office of President-elect Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro said Friday.
   Yatama, an organization of Atlantic coast Indians, claims to
have 2,000 armed combatants in Nicaragua and in camps on the
Honduran coast. Defense Ministry sources put Yatama's strength at
500 in Honduras and 100 in Nicaragua.
   Yatama, by signing the Rio Coco agreement, ``commits itself to
beginning the process of general demobilization of its armed
forces, beginning with disarmament of those still in Honduras,''
Mrs. Chamorro's office said in a brief communique issued late
Thursday.
   The agreement sets a deadline for demobilization of April 20,
five days before Mrs. Chamorro takes office and replaces Sandinista
President Daniel Ortega. The accord also asks for cooperation from
the U.N. observer force and a commission monitoring the Central
American peace process.
   The pact is similar to that signed March 23 by the Nicaraguan
Resistance, umbrella for most of the U.S.-backed Contra rebels
fighting the leftist Sandinista government.
   Rebel leaders, international observers and reporters say most of
the 12,000 Contras in Honduran base camps have returned to
Nicaragua, where under the agreement with the new government they
are to gather in security zones.
   That accord sets an April 20 deadline for disarming and leaving
the Honduran camps, but fixes no date for demobilization from the
security zones.
   The Sandinistas, in power since 1979, agreed this week to cede
control of the army and police but stressed that demobilization of
the rebels is essential to a peaceful transition of power.

<HEAD>Low Turnout in Zimbabwe Elections as Polls Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polls closed Friday in Zimbabwe's
three-day national elections, which could result in the ruling
party being unchallenged in Parliament.
   President Robert Mugabe, 66, has vowed that if his ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union sweeps all of Parliament's
contested seats, he will change the constitution and institute a
Marxist one-party state.
   There are currently two opposition legislators in the 150-member
Parliament and a unanimous vote is required to change the
constitution.
   Observers said only the Zimbabwe Unity Movement, led by
oposition legislator Edgar Tekere, had a chance of capturing a seat
and blocking Mugabe's dream of one-party rule.
   Interest in the elections appeared low. Election officials said
only 45.3 percent of the nation's 4.8 million registered voters had
cast their ballots as of Thursday. They did not expect heavy voting
Friday.
   Balloting had been set to end Thursday, but it was extended
through Friday in hopes more people would turn out. Election
officials said heavy rain Wednesday and problems at some polling
booths kept turnout low the first day.
   The head of the electoral supervisory committee, Walter Kamba,
told reporters some polling stations received no voters at all
Friday.
   Counting was scheduled to begin early Saturday, and first
results were expected a few hours later, he said.
   Some observers said the low turnout was the result of voter
dissatisfaction with Mugabe's policies and uncertainty over whether
Tekere could solve the nation's record unemployment and spiraling
inflation.

   The choice is simple. You can go see ``My Left
Foot.'' Or you can watch a quartet of man-size, goggle-wearing
turtles eat pizza.
   Like it or not, the ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' are now at
a theater near you. And this weekend's opening will test the
unproven theory that a hit toy can forge a profitable trail for a
blockbuster movie.
   The Turtles were born six years ago in a $1,200 comic book
partially funded by a tax refund. The Turtles now star in a smash
animated television series and have become one of the hottest
childrens' products since Cabbage Patch Kids.
   Playmates Toys Inc. sold $115 million in Turtle-related
merchandise last year. Some 175 manufacturers are pushing about 600
Turtle items, including Turtle pizzas, a musical talking Turtle
toothbrush, Turtle underwear, cereal, pork rinds, yogurt, cookies
and sleepwear.
   ``It's definitely our most popular line,'' said Richard Sallis,
Playmates' senior vice president for marketing. ``I've never seen
anything like this before.'' The Turtles are the nation's third
best-selling toy, behind Nintendo and Barbie.
   The question, though, is whether bed sheets can translate to
box-office. Like never before, Hollywood has become obsessed in
adapting trends for the screen _ the lambada prompted two movies
and beach volleyball is the focus of the new film ``Side Out.''
   The makers of ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' are betting that
the live-action $15 million film will be as strong in theaters as
the Turtles are in toy stores. The movie is playing in 1,900 movie
houses, a spectacularly wide release.
   ``This movie had an extraordinary awareness level before we did
anything,'' said Sondra Ruch, marketing president for the movie's
distributor, New Line Cinema. ``Kids find these turtles
irresistible.''
   Alex Lee, 5, is one such fan. ``I like them because they are so
cool basically. They wear masks all the time and, you know, they do
cool stuff,'' Lee said. ``They have Japanese weapons, they are
Ninjas, they don't wear too much clothes and they eat pizza.''
   The challenge for New Line is to distinguish the movie from the
animated series, and thus create a broader audience. Sneak previews
on college campuses played to packed houses, New Line reports, and
the film fared well late Thursday night to mostly adult viewers.
   ``We had to differentiate between the cartoon and the movie,''
Ruch said. ``And the line we've been using in our campaign is, `Hey
dude! This is no cartoon!'''
   It may not be a cartoon, but the PG-rated movie is filled with
comicbook-style violence. ``It's violence, while not graphic, is
much more abundant than the rating might lead parents to believe,''
a review in The New York Times said.
   The movie, developed before the toys became so coveted, focuses
on the adventures of the four turtles _ Leonardo, Michaelangelo,
Raphael and Donatello _ who try to foil teen-age hoods on the loose
in New York City. It is directed by Steve Barron and written by
Bobby Herbeck; Muppet creator Jim Henson designed the Turtle
outfits for the film.
   Other filmmakers have attempted to capitalize on well-liked toys
with mixed results.
   In 1987, Cannon released ``Masters of the Universe,'' a
live-action film based on a then-popular toy and animated
television series. Starring Dolph Lundgren, the movie was a
critical and commercial flop.
   Reviews of the Turtle movie have been mixed, but this might be a
review-proof film.
   USA Today gave it three stars out of a possible four, saying
``If you think the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are awesome in
cartoon and toy form, wait till you see them in live action.''
   The New York Times review called the film ``a mutant of sorts, a
contentious, unsightly hybrid of martial-arts exploitation film and
live-action cartoon.''
   Mark Freedman, who supervises licensing and entertainment
marketing for the Turtles, says the characters do not exploit
audiences the way other animated figures have in the past.
   The hook, he said, is not clever merchandising but
three-dimensional characters and a creative plot. ``You can't fool
kids. They wouldn't want to go see the movie if it was just a long
cartoon. ''
   He said the Turtles are popular because they reject most of the
conventions of animated programming.
   ``All the traditional super heroes are either the mightiest or
the fastest,'' he said. ``The Turtles are neither. They're funny.''

<HEAD>Relatives of Slain Activists Push for Prosecution of Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives of activists killed by the
government demonstrated outside the presidential palace Friday
demanding the prosecution of military officers responsible for the
slayings.
   Hundreds of people held up a huge red and white banner reading
``Truth and Justice in Chile. No to impunity.'' Mimes dressed as
ghosts moved through a mock cemetery.
   The demonstration was the first of its kind since the military
gave way to an elected civilian leadership March 11.
   Organizers vowed to hold similar protests outside the
presidential palace on the last Friday of each month.
   Most of the demonstrators were women, who planted posters of
dead or missing husbands, sons or other relatives in an empty
garden patch outside the palace.
   They placed red carnations around the posters, while mimes in
black writhed between the posters, imitating ghosts.
   A squad of national police stood nearby with a tear-gas truck
and a water cannon. At one point they tried to push the
demonstrators away, but later they backed off and waited for the
protest to break up on its own.
   The government of former military ruler Augusto Pinochet, who
has retained command of the 60,000-man army, was repeatedly accused
of systematic abuses by international human rights organizations.
   After seizing power in 1973, Pinochet launched a massive
crackdown on leftists in which hundreds were killed and thousands
jailed, tortured or deported.
   President Patricio Aylwin has said he will let the courts act
independently in cases of abuses. But he has also said that to
achieve national reconciliation, the country must be prepared to
forgive past offenses.

<HEAD>East German Leaders Examine Files the Secret Police Kept on Them</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German leaders tried to defuse a
political crisis Friday by inspecting dossiers the secret police
kept on them, and the official news service ADN said they were
cleared of links to the notorious ``Stasi.''
   On Thursday, nationwide demonstrations were held demanding an
investigation of allegations that some victors in East Germany's
first free elections were informants for the despised security
apparatus of the former Stalinist regime.
   ADN said officals overseeing the disbanding of the secret police
let the nation's most influential politicians, or their
representatives, study the confidential files on Friday. It said
the leaders of the three major political factions were given access
to the files.
   The politicians were accompanied by citzens' representatives and
officials overseeing dismantling of the secret police, the agency
reported.
   It said Manfred Stolpe, senior administrator of East Berlin's
Lutheran Church, looked at the files of Christian Democratic leader
Lothar de Maiziere and found no evidence connecting him with the
secret police.
   ADN said de Maiziere asked Stolpe and Communist Party chief
Gregor Gysi to look at the files for him.
   The agency said Stolpe also found no evidence that Gysi, head of
the new, reform-oriented Communist Party, had secret police ties.
ADN said Gysi looked at his files with Stolpe.
   Social Democratic Chairman Ibrahim Boehme looked at his records
himself and told reporters he also was cleared.
   De Maiziere's conservative political alliance finished with the
most votes in March 18 elections, the Social Democrats finished a
distant second and the Communists third.
   Boehme said last week he was temporarily stepping down as party
chairman amid allegations he was a secret police informant. On
Friday, he said he was resuming his duties because inspection of
the files proved his innocence.
   The allegations of secret police involvement have clouded talks
on forming East Germany's freely elected government.
   De Maziere has been trying to forge a coalition with the
left-leaning Social Democrats to ensure a majority in the new
Parliament so it will adopt a plan for swift unification with West
Germany.
   After more than five hours of checking ``between 200 and 300
pages,'' of records kept at the now disbanded Stasi headquarters in
East Berlin, a smiling Boehme told reporters waiting outside the
building, ``Everything is fine.''
   Two lawyers went with him to the headquarters.
   The Social Democrats have expressed concern about working with
the ultraconservative element of de Maiziere's alliance, the German
Social Union.
   But the Social Democrats and Christian Democrats said on
Thursday that they had agreed on basic points of forming a majority
coalition.
   The office of the interim East German president, Manfred
Gerlach, meanwhile announced Friday that the new, 400-member
Parliament will convene on April 5, ADN said.
   Since hard-line Communist Erich Honecker was toppled on Oct. 18,
a pro-reform interim government dominated by the Communists has run
the country.
   East Germany, essentially leaderless since the revolt, has been
beset by mass emigration and economic problems as it awaits
eventual reunification with wealthy West Germany.

   Hog farmers are cutting back further on the
number of animals they will send to market and will keep for future
production, a report by the Agriculture Department indicated Friday.
   As of March 1, the U.S. inventory of hogs and pigs totaled an
estimated 51.7 million head, down 2 percent from a year ago, the
report said.
   The breeding herd was put at 6.81 million head, down 4 percent
from a year earlier. Market hogs, at 44.9 million head, were down 2
percent.
   Inventories in the 10 top pork states were reported at 40.5
million head, down 3 percent from a year ago.
   Hog producers nationally expect to have 3.19 million sows farrow
this spring, down 3 percent from farrowing during March, April and
May of last year. Farrowing intentions for June, July and August
were estimated at 2.91 million, also down 3 percent from a
year-earlier.
   The following list shows the March 1 inventory in the 10 major
states, which account for 78 percent of the U.S. total. The first
number, in thousands, is the total number of hogs in the state, the
second is the March 1 figure's percentage of a year earlier.

<HEAD>State Files Contempt Charges in Fernald Cleanup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOE McDONALD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Contempt of court charges were filed Friday
against the U.S. Department of Energy and the operator of the
Fernald uranium processing plant for allegedly violating a cleanup
agreement.
   State Attorney General Anthony J. Celebrezze Jr. accused the
federal government and Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio Inc. of
mishandling hazardous waste containers, failing to properly analyze
some 40,000 drums of radioactive material and failing to develop a
written inspection schedule. Westinghouse operates the Fernald
plant.
   ``The performance since 1988 has not been all bad, ... but it's
my experience that only after we hit them with a club, that they
start compliance,'' Celebrezze said.
   Under a December 1988 consent decree, the plant must comply with
state and federal hazardous waste laws and pollution standards.
Celebrezze said the consent decree gave the state clear authority
to regulate disposal and treatment of hazardous waste.
   The decree did not cover radioactive waste, he said.
   Celebrezze asked U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel to force
the government to make proper environmental reports, use safe
containers for hazardous waste, and guarantee that waste water does
not spill on the ground.
   Celebrezze also is seeking proper sampling of the hazardous
waste.
   The attorney general said the state would leave the amount of
any possible fine up to Spiegel.
   Celebrezze said Westinghouse did not sign the consent decree but
is subject to its terms because the Energy Department signed on
behalf of all contractors, including Westinghouse.
   There was no immediate response from the Energy Department or
Westinghouse.
   The Fernald plant, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, began
processing uranium in 1951 for use in nuclear reactors and weapons.
The contractor operating the 1,050-acre plant, Westinghouse
Materials Corp. of Ohio, suspended production last year to
concentrate on cleanup efforts.
   A lawsuit on behalf of 14,000 people living or working within
five miles of the plant led to an unprecedented $78 million
settlement last summer by the DOE. The government made its first
$16 million payment on the settlement last month.
   The Reagan administration called for closing the plant by the
mid-1990s, but the current administration hasn't endorsed the plan.
The cleanup cost has been estimated at $1 billion to $5 billion.
   The federal government entered into an agreement with Ohio that
gives the state court-enforceable regulatory authority over the
cleanup of hazardous wastes, not including nuclear waste.
   Stored at the plant in waste pits, two concrete silos and
thousands of 55-gallon drums are more than 500,000 metric tons of
radioactive wastes dating from current plant operations to the
World War II-era Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb.
   The Energy Department in 1985 admitted that the plant had
released about 300,000 pounds of uranium oxide dust into the
atmosphere over the years through faulty exhaust-filter systems.

<TEXT>
   Two dozen islanders accused of
torturing to death six people have told a court they were possessed
by the devil or seized by religious fervor during a hunt for evil
spirits in 1987.
   All week the jury has been considering the case, which focuses
on two days of terror on the remote atoll of Faaite after a visit
by three women who claimed to represent a charismatic movement
founded in the United States.
   Psychiatric experts testified that the charismatic movement,
mixed with ancient Polynesian beliefs in the supernatural, produced
a dangerous mix on an isolated island lacking institutional
authority.
   The three women, whom investigators ruled never ordered the
killings, are not on trial.
   But witnesses say the violence had its roots in a visit that
August by the three women from Tahiti, about 310 miles west.
   ``I had a spirit under the spell of the devil,'' one of the
islanders from Faaite told Judge Marcel Bihl of the Papeete
Tribunal on Thursday. ``I lost my head, but I believed I was on the
holy path, shunning the evil fighting within me.''
   Other defendants, clad in bright tropical shirts and white
trousers, said they lost self-control during the search for demons
and sorcerers.
   The 24 defendants are charged with murder, inciting violence and
other offenses.
   The women claimed to represent the Charismatic Renewal, a
movement founded in 1967 and affiliated with the Roman Catholic
Church. However, church authorities said they had no connection
with the women.
   At the time, the movement already had a strong following on
Faaite, an atoll studded with white sand beaches and about 180
residents.
   The women, regarded as priestesses by the islanders, took over
the tiny whitewashed church and, by force of personality, replaced
the lay preacher as the religious authority on the atoll, witnesses
said.
   The trio's leader, Alexandra Silvia, conducted services in a
trance and told frightened islanders of her visions that God would
abandon Faaite, the defendants said.
   She suggested demons were in their midst, and the population
began viewing with suspicion fellow islanders who failed to attend
her daily services.
   In late August that year, the trio left Faaite and gave roses to
seven islanders, designating them as disciples to continue their
work.
   On Sept. 2, Ioane Harris, the assistant mayor, publicly
denounced what was happening.
   One defendant told the court he looked into Harris' eyes and
believed him possessed. Maddened villagers tightened a cord around
Harris' neck, held a crucifix before his face, and beat him
senseless.
   They then drowned Harris during a ritual in the lagoon and threw
his body on a bonfire built under palm trees in front of the church.
   ``It was necessary to purify him,'' one of the defendants calmly
told the court. ``It was necessary to purify the village.''
   Five more people were killed over the next two days. One, a
mentally handicapped young man who claimed to be Jesus Christ, was
burned alive.
   Informed of the killings, the mayor arrived on Sept. 4 with a
Catholic priest and a squadron of police in time to stop further
violence.
   The jury was expected reach a verdict after two weeks' testimony.

<HEAD>Hungarian Conservative Parties to Run in Alliance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Hungarian Democratic Forum,
strongest party in last Sunday's free elections, agreed on Friday
to form an alliance with two smaller conservative parties in the
runoff elections April 8.
   The state news agency MTI said the Forum agreed with the
Independent Smallholders' party and the Christian Democrats to have
voters cast ballots for whichever candidate of the three parties is
strongest in their districts.
   It could be a preliminary step to forming a conservative
coalition to head Hungary's first democratic government in more
than 40 years.
   A split vote and complex electoral system meant that only five
of the 386 contested parliamentary seats were decided in last
Sunday's first round of elections. Eight additional seats will be
distributed to ethnic minorities for a total of 394 seats in
Parliament.
   The Democratic Forum won 24.71 percent of the vote Sunday and
its chief rival, the liberal League of Free Democrats, won 21.38
percent.
   The Independent Smallholders' were third with 11.76 percent and
the Christian Democrats sixth with 6.46 percent.
   In the runoff, the League of Free Democrats is likely to team up
with the leftist Young Democrats, who took 8.94 percent of the
votes Sunday.
   The governing Socialists, formed from the Communist reformers
who led Hungary peacefully toward democracy, came fourth with 10.89
percent.
   The Socialists are still associated in voters' minds with the
excesses of Stalinism, however, and both the Forum and Free
Democrats reject any coalition which includes them.
   Both the Democratic Forum and Free Democrats agree on one issue:
the need for a market economy.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III urged
Americans on Friday to support a U.S. foreign policy based on
``idealism plus realism'' and not to withdraw from the foreign
field now that communism is in retreat.
   ``The time of sweeping away the old dictators is passing fast,''
Baker said. ``The time of building up the new democracies has
arrived.''
   Baker spoke to the World Affairs Council in Dallas. Texts were
distributed at the State Department where U.S. officials said one
of Baker's aims was to combat ``neo-isolationism'' in America.
   ``Now that the adversaries of democracy are weaker, some say we
should retire, mission accomplished, to tend our problems at
home,'' Baker said in his prepared remarks. ``I am not among them.
In the new world struggling to be born, like the old world now
rapidly passing away, there is no substitute for American
leadership.''
   The speech was largely philosophical. There was no mention in it
of Lithuania, where secessionists are seeking stronger support from
the Bush administration.
   Afterward, Baker said the United States was continuing to call
for a resolution of the dispute through dialogue and independence.
   ``We've never recognized the incorporation of Lithuania into the
Soviet Union in 1940,'' Baker said.
   ``We support Lithuanians in their desire to achieve
self-determination. ``The real issue is how do we best get there?''
   Baker also praised the Soviet leadership for a commitment to
reform that, he said, has brought about ``remarkable changes'' in
Eastern Europe and other areas of the world.
   The U.S. officials, who briefed reporters under condition of
anonymity, said Baker preferred focusing on broader foreign policy
issues.
   One of his central themes was the surprisingly rapid trend
toward democracy around the world.
   When President Bush took office in January 1989 there was ``a
new breeze blowing for freedom,'' Baker said. Now, 14 months later,
he said, ``that breeze has become a gale-force wind.''
   Baker cited Nicaragua and developments in Central and Eastern
Europe.
   But, he stressed, ``as we enter a new era of democracy, the old
arguments of idealism versus realism must be replaced by idealism
plus realism.''
   On the one hand, he said, Americans will not support a U.S.
foreign policy that lacks support for humane values.
   And yet, Baker said, ``I am equally convinced that Americans
will reject a policy based primarily on moral exhortation which
ignores our power to act.''

   Zulu fighters supporting rival
black factions clashed with guns and knives Friday in Natal
Province, and the African National Congress persuaded Nelson
Mandela to cancel a peace rally in the region.
   The sudden cancellation angered the leader of Inkatha, whose
followers are pitted in the battles against supporters of the
ANC-supported United Democratic Front.
   The fighting this week has left at least 37 dead, sent thousands
fleeing their villages and prompted the white-minority government
to threaten a crackdown.
   It also has kept Mandela from forging black unity before
preliminary talks with the government on dismantling apartheid.
Those talks are scheduled April 11.
   Mandela had planned to join Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi
in a rally Monday in the war-torn Edendale Valley of Natal.
   Inkatha favors a Zulu-based state in Natal, while the United
Democratic Front favors a united South Africa under democratic
majority rule. Both groups have been fighting for control of black
townships since 1983.
   ``The atmosphere is not yet ideal for a joint rally in Natal,''
the ANC's cancellation announcement said. It did not elaborate.
   The statement said, however, that Mandela will go to Natal on
Monday and Tuesday to visit the affected areas and that
arrangements were being made for a private meeting with Buthelezi.
   It was issued after a five-hour meeting of Mandela and ANC
officials at Mandela's Soweto home. Mandela and other ANC leaders
were unavailable for comment later.
   Buthelezi said Mandela told him in a telephone conversation that
ANC and United Democratic Front leaders thought the situation in
Natal was too tense for the rally.
   But Buthelezi said, ``People are going to die while they delay.
It was his initiative, his suggestion, and he saw it as a matter of
urgency that we address a joint peace meeting either on Monday or
Tuesday.''
   Some ANC and UDF leaders in Natal opposed a Mandela-Buthelezi
meeting on grounds it might give positive publicity to Buthelezi.
   Mandela appeared to put aside such considerations Thursday
night, when he said of the planned rally: ``This is not time for
people with political differences to stand on ceremony. We must
unite now in our commitment to end the violence in Natal and work
out a strategy we are all united behind.''
   A joint rally by the two was seen as an important step in
efforts to stop the revenge slaughter that has escalated beyond the
original political differences. It has now been complicated by
criminal gangs and personal disputes.
   Police said at least 37 people had been killed since Tuesday in
clashes between Zulu bands in the rugged hill country near Edendale.
   ``It's impossible to say how many people have been hurt. It's in
the hundreds,'' police Maj. Piet Kitching said.
   Rival war bands were battling Friday in rural areas, but the
situation was quieter, police said.
   ``It's very tense. It could erupt again at any time. It's a
terrible situation,'' Kitching said.
   Nearly 4,000 have died in the past four years in the feuding.
   President F.W. de Klerk said Friday the unrest was becoming a
threat to stability and the government would use force to restore
order.
   ``Demonstrators openly espousing violence or preaching class and
racial hatred are playing with fire. Fanning these flames may
easily lead to a catastrophic intergroup conflagration,'' he told
the Cape Town Press Club.
   De Klerk gave no details but said he would make a statement to
parliament on Monday on measures to stop the violence. It is the
worst to sweep the country since the national state of emergency
was declared June 12, 1986.
   Also Friday, the government freed seven more black nationalists
from prison, including the nephew of African National Congress
leader Walter Sisulu. The ANC, the leading black anti-apartheid
group, has demanded the release of all political prisoners as a
condition for talking with the government.
   The government lifted bans on Mandela's autobiography ``The
Struggle Is My Life'' and the anti-apartheid movie ``A Dry White
Season.''

<HEAD>Mental Patient Who Killed Young Girl Innocent By Reason Of

<TEXT>
   A mental patient who walked away from a
state hospital and randomly stabbed a 9-year-old girl to death at a
street fair was found innocent by reason of insanity Friday.
   David R. Peterson, 38, lacked the capacity to conform his
conduct to the requirements of the law, a three-judge Superior
Court panel unanimously concluded in acquitting him of murder and
escape charges.
   However, Dr. Donald R. Grayson, a state-commissioned
psychiatrist who examined Peterson, said it would be ``a dreadful
mistake in judgment'' ever to release him from a high-security
psychiatric facility.
   At Peterson's arraignment last summer, an angry crowd yelled
``Kill him, kill him!'' when he was brought to court. But there
were no such demonstrations Friday.
   The girl's parents, Catherine and Robert Short, and a handful of
their closest friends were present for the brief reading of the
verdict. They showed no emotion as the decision was announced, and
declined to comment when they left the courthouse.
   The Shorts are planning to sue the state.
   Peterson walked off the grounds of Connecticut Valley Hospital
last July 28. He took a bus three miles downtown, bought a hunting
knife at a Main Street sporting goods shop and walked only about
100 yards before pouncing on 9-year-old Jessica Short.
   He picked his victim at random from a crowd of hundreds
attending a sidewalk sale and fair. He stabbed her 34 times before
stunned and horrified bystanders and police could pull him away.
   Judges James Higgins, Barry Schaller and Salvatore Arena, who
began deliberations Wednesday afternoon, ordered Peterson committed
to the custody of the state mental health commissioner for
evaluation.
   He will be held at the Whiting Forensic Institute, the state's
only maximum-security institution, at least until another court
hearing to determine whether he should be confined or released.
   His attorney, public defender Christopher James, said Peterson
is happy to be at Whiting because he feels safer there.
   Psychiatrists hired by both the prosecution and the defense
testified during the trial that Peterson represents a chronic
danger to society and is as dangerous as a mentally ill person can
be to others.
   Peterson, a chronic paranoid schizophrenic with a history of
mental illness and violence, has spent 15 of his past 20 years in
mental institutions. In 1971 and again in 1988, he was found
innocent by reason of insanity in stabbing attacks and ordered
committed to state hospitals.
   In 1988, he was moved from Whiting to Connecticut Valley
Hospital after doctors at both places said they believed he could
be adequately supervised in a minimum-security setting, said the
state Psychiatric Security Review Board.
   Peterson's attorney said the case shows that the board, which by
law has the primary duty of protecting society, should seek the
recommendations of outside experts rather than relying solely on
information coming from the hospitals.
   About two hours before he killed the girl, Peterson had been
screaming about pain in his legs and arms that he blamed on the
medication he was taking. The psychiatrist hired by the defense
said the patient should have been confined to his ward after the
outburst because he had a history of psychotic delusions being
accompanied by violence.
   Instead, Peterson was allowed to follow his normal routine and
go out onto the hospital grounds without supervison, according to
court testimony.
   Peterson told police he killed Miss Short to take revenge on his
doctors because they wouldn't change his medication.
   He told psychiatrists he went downtown to take revenge on his
``enemies'' _ whites of European descent _ and had pictured himself
as a soldier marching into battle.

   The government Friday removed
the ban on Nelson Mandela's autobiography, saying it is now ``part
of the accepted political rhetoric'' in South Africa.
   The government censorship board also lifted the ban on ``A Dry
White Season,'' an anti-apartheid movie starring Donald Sutherland
and Marlon Brando, made in the United States and based on a novel
by South African Andre Brink.
   The Publication Appeals Board banned Mandela's autobiography,
``The Struggle Is My Life,'' three years ago.
   Mandela was released Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison for his
role in launching the bombing and sabotage campaign of the African
National Congress. He continues to support the ANC's armed
struggle, although it has been largely dormant the past year.
   ``As far as the principle of armed violence is concerned,
(Mandela's) standpoint is so well known that it is unlikely it will
change the outlook of the reader toward political violence,'' the
Appeals Board said in its judgment.
   Other books about Mandela and the ANC have been available in
South Africa for several years.
   Speaking about ``A Dry White Season,'' the panel said in a
statement: ``The board believes this film is a serious one which
addresses the sensitive relations between white and black in South
Africa.
   ``In the board's opinion, it attempts to improve these
relations: sadly it often loses its effect by falling into
propaganda.''
   The film was screened at a South African film festival last year
but was banned from general circulation.
   It concerns a series of injustices suffered by a black family at
the hands of white authorities. A white teacher, played by
Sutherland, becomes involved and unsuccessfully seeks redress
through the courts.
   Another anti-apartheid film, ``Cry Freedom,'' is scheduled to
reopen in South Africa on April 27.
   The board approved the film in July 1988, but police used their
powers under the national state of emergency to confiscate it from
theaters the day it opened, saying it posed a threat to public
safety.
   The distributors said police returned the copies of the film
recently.
   ``Cry Freedom'' is about black activist Steve Biko, who died in
police custody in 1977, and Donald Woods, a white newspaper editor
who had befriended him.

   A rifle-toting woman who allegedly harassed
actress Sharon Gless for years surrendered peacefully Friday after
a seven-hour standoff with police inside the ``Cagney and Lacey''
star's home.
   Joni Leigh Penn, 30, who in the past had threatened to kill
herself in front of the actress, put down a loaded .22-caliber
semiautomatic rifle and surrendered to officers inside Miss Gless'
Studio City home at 10 a.m., said police Capt. Dan Watson. Miss
Gless was not home at the time.
   ``She surrendered voluntarily. She was tired. She was just kind
of worn down,'' said Watson, who described Ms. Penn as an obsessed
fan of Miss Gless.
   A policewoman was instrumental in convincing the woman to
surrender, but her name was not immediately available, officers
said. ``I don't know what she said to her,'' Watson added.
   Ms. Penn was quickly handcuffed and led outside to a police car
while dozens of reporters and neighbors watched. She walked out
with her head down. She looked somber and did not speak.
   She was taken to the Police Department's North Hollywood
station, where Watson said she would be booked for investigation of
armed burglary, a felony.
   An hour earlier, Watson told reporters gathered outside the
actress' home on a tree-lined cul-de-sac that Ms. Penn had
threatened to kill herself. Another police spokesman, Officer C.K.
Witkamp, said Ms. Penn had pointed the weapon to her head when
officers arrived.
   Miss Gless, who was in touch with police throughout the ordeal,
issued a statement shortly afterward in which she said Ms. Penn had
harassed her for several years.
   ``These are horrendous times that we live in, especially when
disturbed people have such easy access to weapons that can be used
indiscriminately,'' she said. ``This has been going on for several
years now, and I think has to be dealt with by the authorities.''
   Obsessed fans have stalked many Hollywood celebrities in recent
years. Actress Theresa Saldana was stabbed and nearly killed
outside her home by an obsessed fan eight years ago and ``My Sister
Sam'' star Rebecca Schaeffer was shot to death in the doorway of
her apartment building last year.
   Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Olivia Newton-John, Michael
Landon and Michael J. Fox have also been targets of obsessive fans.
   Police said Ms. Penn barricaded herself inside a bathroom at
Miss Gless' home. Officers answering a silent burglar alarm found
her inside shortly after 3 a.m. She remained in the bathroom for
nearly seven hours while a Police Department psychologist and
several officers talked to her from the other side of the door.
   Miss Gless was staying at another home she owns in Los Angeles.
No one was in the Studio City house, about 15 miles north of
downtown, Watson said.
   He said Ms. Penn was also a suspect in an attempted burglary at
the Gless home Monday night.
   Police said Miss Gless obtained a court order in November 1988
requiring Ms. Penn to keep away from her. It appeared that until
this week Ms. Penn had complied with the order, Watson said.
   Miss Gless, 46, played the tough police detective Christine
Cagney on the ``Cagney and Lacey'' TV series. She won a best
actress Emmy in 1987.
   CBS on Wednesday announced that Miss Gless would reunite with
``Cagney and Lacey'' executive producer Barney Rosenzweig to create
a new dramatic series for the 1990-91 season tentatively titled
``Renewal.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After weeks of sporadic clashes, a
cease-fire between rival Christian forces collapsed Friday in
thunderous battles that killed at least 38 people and left Beirut
and the surrounding hills in flames.
   The fighting began at daybreak and continued without letup past
midnight.
   Residents of the Metn region overlooking Beirut reported heavy
shelling. The residents, reached by telephone from Cyprus, said
they had been in bomb shelters since dawn.
   ``It's all-out war again,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot
be named under standing regulations.
   A cease-fire had been in effect since March 3 between Gen.
Michel Aoun's troops and the rival Lebanese Forces militia. It had
been violated repeatedly, raising fears of renewed warfare, but
none of the previous fighting was as serious as that Friday.
   The Christian forces have been battling since Jan. 30 for
control of the Christian enclave. Aoun began the warfare in January
by moving to crush Samir Geagea's militia, the main challenger to
Aoun's authority in the Christian region.
   Police said at least 38 people were killed and 65 wounded in
savage combat Friday in the central sector of Christian east Beirut
and in the mountains of Kesrouan province, 20 miles northeast of
the capital.
   Since Jan. 30, at least 814 people have died in the battles.
Most have been civilians.
   Thunderous blasts reverberated across Beirut.
   Schools, churches, apartments and shops were set ablaze in the
city and across Kesrouan, and flames lit the night sky over Beirut.
Police said scores of houses collapsed on their tenants.
   Patriarch Nasrallah Sfeir, spiritual head of the Maronite
Catholic community of which Aoun and Geagea are members, threatened
both men with excommunication if fighting did not stop.
   ``This horrific, destructive shelling which the army and the
Lebanese Forces blame on each other ... has forced people to flee
their homes and take shelter in forests,'' Sfeir said.
   ``How dare they claim they are defending Christian land while
they are turning it into scorched earth?'' he said. The statement
was broadcast on Beirut radio stations.
   Sfeir also issued an excommunication threat March 2, a day
before the cease-fire.
   Geagea responded to Sfeir's latest appeal by saying he would
stop shooting if Aoun reciprocated. There was no immediate response
from Aoun.
   Aoun's force of 19,000 army troops and Geagea's 6,000-man
militia accused each other of destroying the truce.
   Aoun's command said Geagea forces tried to attack army positions
at Badaro, next to the Geagea stronghold of Ashrafieh in east
Beirut.
   ``The attackers suffered heavy losses in lives and equipment,''
a communique said.
   The Lebanese Forces issued their own communique. It said Aoun's
troops attacked the mountain village of Kleiat in an attempt to
clear a path way for Aoun's troops to capture Kesrouan province.
   ``The Lebanese Forces prevented Aoun's units from accomplishing
their objectives ... and succeeded in pushing them (Aoun's units)
almost completely out of Kleiat in a counterattack,'' the Lebanese
Forces' chief spokesman, George Abdul-Massih, told The Associated
Press.
   Before the new outbreak of fighting, Aoun's army held a quarter
of Kleiat. The rest was under Lebanese Forces control.
   On Thursday, Maronite leaders met in Bkirki, seat of the
Maronite patriarchate, and empowered a mediation committee to
reopen talks with Geagea and Aoun for a political solution.
   Aoun boycotted the meeting. Geagea attended and said he will
press for a resolution urging Aoun and himself to discuss with
President Elias Hrawi an overall settlement of the Lebanese crisis.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are all Maronites, the 900,000-strong
Catholic sect that has dominated government since Lebanon's
independence from France in 1943.
   The Syrian-backed Hrawi was elected president by Parliament in
November and given the task of implementing political reforms
designed to end 15 years of sectarian civil war.
   The reforms and election were part of an Arab League-brokered
peace treaty endorsed the previous month.
   Aoun rejects that accord because it does not guarantee the
withdrawal of 40,000 Syrian troops, deployed in Lebanon since 1976
to quell civil war fighting.
   He refuses to recognize Hrawi, who dismissed Aoun as army
commander and interim prime minister in November. The general has
refused to step down.
   Geagea recognizes the presidency. He has not declared his
support for the accord, which would give the Moslems more of a say
in governing Lebanon.

<HEAD>Mayor Unveils Rescue Plan but Shutdown Still on Track</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buffalo's subway and bus system hurtled
toward a shutdown as a last-minute rescue plan announced Friday by
Mayor James D. Griffin ran into opposition.
   Erie County officials, who earlier rejected a utility tax to
fund mass transit, criticized Griffin's new proposal to use county
sales taxes and an advance on county operating subsidies to keep
the system afloat.
   County leaders said they saw no way to avoid a Saturday night
shutdown of the bus and subway system, which carries 120,000 riders
a day in New York's second-largest city.
   If the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority's buses and
subways stop running, 9,700 students who normally take public buses
to school will be on their own, Buffalo school officials said.
   Hospital administrators said they would handle the shutdown as
if it were a blizzard, encouraging workers to stagger their hours
and form car pools, and would look into renting private buses if
necessary. Griffin said the city might relax parking restrictions.
   Riders lamented the political logjam.
   ``It's terrible,'' said Pat Gustine of suburban Williamsville.
``I'm in favor of them upping the fare or doing whatever they have
to do.''
   In another development, the transit agency's executive director,
Alfred H. Savage, accepted a $149,500-a-year post as head of the
Chicago Transit Authority. Savage resigned from the transportation
authority Thursday, saying he was fed up with the county's
unwillingness to support public transit.
   The system has been squeezed between rising costs and declining
federal subsidies since 1985, when it opened its subway line.
   The bus and subway system cost $52 million to operate in the
year ending March 31, and ran a deficit of $19.5 million. Farebox
revenues pay about 40 percent of the operating cost; most of the
rest comes from shrinking federal, state and county grants.
   The crisis point was reached Wednesday when the county
legislature rejected a proposed tax on public utilities that would
have raised $9 million for transit. A day later, transportation
authority commissioners voted 8-1 to suspend operations, saying the
legislature's action showed community leaders don't want a transit
system.
   Transportation authority Comptroller Michael J. Neumeister said
the agency will have just $89,000 in the bank Saturday night and
will have to borrow from its profitable Greater Buffalo
International Airport operation to meet the shutdown expense of
$1.3 million. Expenses include final payroll and unemployment
insurance payments.
   The plan announced by the mayor on Friday would take $9 million
from an expected increase in local sales tax collections. He said
the city, which faces a $30 million deficit, can't afford to give
up its share of that money but can't afford to give up the transit
system either.
   ``Shutting down affects those people who don't appear to have
any voice,'' Griffin said. ``If we close down this system, shame on
all of us.''
   But such a change would need the approval of the county
legislature, the elected county executive and the mayors of two
other Erie County cities. And officials said Friday that approval
was unlikely to be granted.
   County Executive Dennis Gorski said he opposes the sales tax
transfer _ and the mayor's proposal that the county advance the
system $2.1 million in subsidies that would normally be paid in
August.
   ``He leaves out the part where property and school taxes across
Erie County will have to be raised to make up the difference,''
Gorski said. On Thursday, Gorski said he would refuse an advance
unless his own proposal for sweeping service cuts and
reorganization of the transportation authority is adopted.
   Leonard R. Lenihan, the county legislature's majority leader,
said he didn't think the sales tax proposal would win much support
in that body.

   Bulgaria has 72 short-range missiles,
eight of them Soviet-made SS-23s with a maximum range of 312 miles,
a Foreign Ministry official said Friday.
   The official BTA news agency quoted the unidentified official as
saying, ``The eight missiles were bought and received in 1986, they
are Bulgaria's property and are under exclusive Bulgarian control.''
   He said there ``have never been and there are not at the moment
any missiles in Bulgaria which should be declared and destroyed on
the strength of the INF (intermediate nuclear forces) treaty signed
by the Soviet Union and the United States in 1987.''
   BTA said the SS-23s ``have never had nor has there been any
intention to supply them with nuclear warheads.''

<HEAD>Nearly Everyone's Talking HDTV at Broadcasters' Convention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of screens offering crystal clear,
larger-than-life images of rock concerts, boxing matches and
surreal animation greeted broadcasters as the industry's annual
convention began Friday. One term was on nearly everyone's lips:
HDTV.
   High Definition Television commanded center stage at the
Advanced Technology Exhibit, which launched the National
Association of Broadcasters' five-day convention.
   Dozens of HDTV screens offering sharp images flashed beside
displays of high definition lenses, fiber-optic cameras and special
effects gizmos aimed at changing the way TV is made and watched.
   HDTV would give viewers a picture far sharper than current
broadcast standards by more than doubling the number of lines that
make up a TV image.
   A major issue overhanging the exhibits is how the disparate
technology can be standardized and sold in a way that won't make
obsolete the millions of television sets now in use.
   Convention organizers say HDTV probably won't be available to
U.S. homes until at least the middle of this decade.
   ``The issues are not so much what is technically possible,''
said Michael C. Rau, the association's senior vice president for
science and technology. ``Rather, the issues are what kind of HDTV
actually can be achieved, what technologies and standards can be
agreed upon, what technologies have consensus.''
   Displays at the convention suggest that technologically
speaking, a great deal is possible.
   For example, the towering Pioneer CUBE system that greeted
visitors Friday with an ultra-sharp broadcast of a rock concert
made it clear that TV can look a lot better than what most people
see in their homes.
   CUBE used a bank of 12 40-inch HDTV screens, each one showing a
part of the larger picture and together presenting an image that
was remarkably clear for a large-screen display.
   Drawing a small crowd nearby was an exhibit by the Broadcasting
Technology Association of Tokyo of ``ghost reducer'' equipment
designed to eliminate the multiple images that have bothered
viewers since television's infancy.
   The problem occurs when television signals are reflected off
mountains, tall buildings or other structures, officials said. The
new technology eliminates the problem by adding an extra signal at
the transmitter, which is picked up by a device on the TV set and
used to filter out the distorted signal.
   The system was standardized in Japan in 1989 and is used by more
than 100 TV stations there.
   Several U.S. companies are working on similar technology, but
reducers are not expected to be available here for several years.
   ``It's not yet a consumer product because the demand will not
justify the investment or the cost,'' said Amihai Miron, video
department head for Philips Laboratories in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.,
one of the U.S. companies that have developed ghost reducer
prototypes.
   Miron said it would cost up to $1,200, under current conditions,
to equip a television set to use the system.
   Hundreds of additional exhibitors and dozens of panels and
workshops are scheduled when the general sessions of the
convention, expected to draw more than 50,000 people, begin
Saturday.
   President Bush is scheduled to address the gathering Monday.

<HEAD>Idaho Legislature Approves King Holiday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr.
won final approval in the Legislature on Friday, making Idaho the
47th state agreeing to adopt the federal holiday.
   Senate passage of the measure on a 28-11 vote assured it of
becoming law with Gov. Cecil Andrus' promised approval.
   The vote was one of the Legislature's last acts before
adjourning for the year, and came four years after the state
designated the third Monday in January as a commemorative day but
not an official holiday for King.
   Arizona, New Hampshire and Montana also have refused to
designate a holiday.
   ``We've come a long way down the road,'' Sen. Mary Lou Reed
said. ``We have the finest package of human rights legislation in
the nation.''
   The Legislature has passed some of the toughest laws in the
nation against racial harassment and discrimination. But the King
holiday, after winning initial Senate passage, was sidetracked in
the House.
   Final passage came when the Senate agreed to a House amendment
to call the holiday Martin Luther King Jr.-Idaho Human Rights Day.
   A black community leader, the Rev. Ellis Robinson of St. Paul
Baptist Church in Boise, said the action extended the holiday
beyond King to ``anyone who's ever struggled and worked for the
rights of others.''
   ``We're not looking at this as a victory for black people,''
Robinson said. ``We're looking at it as a victory for all people.''
   The King holiday was pushed by lawmakers and the governor in
part to offset the negative image the state has developed because
of the presence of white supremacists at the Aryan Nations compound
of Richard Butler in the state's panhandle.
   The major opposition focused on the potential cost of another
day off for government workers, estimated anywhere between $100,000
and $2 million, depending on whether payroll is considered.

   Rainshowers dotted much of the eastern half of the nation
Friday, turning to snow in northern and higher locations but
changing back to rain later in the day.
   Colorado Springs, Colo., had a two-inch cover of new snow at
daybreak, and the recent storm left as much as 6 inches of snow in
the mountains near Flagstaff, Ariz.
   Snow advisories were posted for the north central mountains, the
northeast highlands, the northeast Plains, the central highlands
and the Sandia-Manzano mountains of New Mexico, changing to rain
with thundershowers in the lower elevations of New Mexico.
   A flood watch was posted through for southeast Texas, where
thunderstorms have produced locally heavy rain during the past two
days.
   Thunderstorms continued across southeast Texas overnight and
during the morning, with half-inch hail at Cotulla and La Salle.
   Morning snowfall across eastern New York and central New England
generally turned to slush, but accumulations included 3 inches at
Litchfield, Mass., and North Canaan, Conn., and 1 inch in the
Massachusetts Berkshires.
   At noon, snowshowers were scattered over central and southern
New England into northwest New York. Rain extended from the
remainder of the eastern half of New York across Maryland and
Delaware.
   Showers and thunderstorms dotted coastal Georgia, the southern
coast of South Carolina, the Florida Panhandle and northern
Florida, southwest Georgia, southeast Louisiana, and the upper
Texas Gulf Coast.
   Rain extended from the western portion of the Carolinas across
northern Georgia, northern Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky,
southern Indiana, southern Illinois, southeast and southern
Missouri, northern Arkansas, eastern and southern Kansas and
southwest Nebraska.
   Rain over north central Colorado changed to snow, or became
mixed with snow over much of the remainder of the state. Snow was
also falling over southwest New Mexico.
   Heavier rainfall during the 6 hours ending at noon EST included
almost 1{ inches at Panama City, Fla., 1 1-3 inches at Valparaiso,
Fla., and almost an inch at Palacious, Texas.
   The low temperature for the nation Friday morning was 2 degrees
below zero at Houlton, Maine. Temperatures around the nation at 3
p.m. EST ranged from 29 degrees at Worcester, Mass., to 87 degrees
at Fort Myers, Fla.

<HEAD>Company Denies Involvement in Alleged Iraqi Smuggling Ring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A management company denied on Friday, two days
after a search by customs officers, that the company had supplied
sensitive equipment to Iraq without notifying with the government.
   Officers investigating an alleged Iraqi smuggling operation
seized documents in the raid Wednesday at Global Technical and
Management Services International, based in Deeside, Wales. An
unidentified company in Edinburgh, Scotland, also was raided.
   The British news agency Press Association said officials were
looking for information on alleged smuggling to Iraq of acoustic
detonators for sea mines that can distinguish between friendly and
enemy ships.
   Documents seized Wednesday reportedly contained proof that at
least one acoustic detonator already had been smuggled to Iraq.
   Global issued a statement Friday saying it recently completed a
contract with Iraq to clear offshore waterways of mines and debris
to make shipping lanes safe.
   ``The project involved the supply to Iraq of equipment and
personnel to carry out the ... work and also to train Iraqi Navy
personnel,'' it said.
   But the company said it ``would not provide any service to Iraq
or any other foreign country that was not accepted or sanctioned by
the British authorities.''
   British authorities say they want to question some Global
executives when they return from abroad.
   The Anglo-American probe into the alleged illegal export of
naval equipment sprang from an 18-month investigation by U.S. and
British police and customs that culminated Wednesday in the seizure
at London's Heathrow Airport of nuclear components about to be put
on an Iraqi Airways flight to Baghdad.
   Three people were charged Thursday with trying to export 40
capacitors, essential components in detonating nuclear bombs, in
violation of the Export of Prohibited Goods Control Act.
   Iraqi Omar Latif, who said he was an official with state-owned
Iraqi Airways, was arrested Wednesday and will be deported as soon
as possible, Home Office officials said Friday.
   Iraq denied it bought nuclear triggers and threatened
retaliatory action if Latif is expelled.

   President Bush said Friday he had sent a
confidential letter to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the
crisis in Lithuania, assuring him ``we're not trying to make things
difficult'' for either side.
   White House officials indicated Gorbachev was under intense
pressure to take a tough line toward the breakaway republic, and
the administration continued trying to take a low-key approach.
   Yet, in a sign of displeasure, Gen. Carl E. Vuono, the U.S. Army
chief of staff, postponed a courtesy visit he had been scheduled to
make to the Soviet Union.
   Two U.S. officials, demanding anonymity, said Vuono's host would
have been the Soviet military commander in Lithuania, and it would
have been inappropriate for them to meet now.
   Meanwhile, Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., warned
that ``all bets are off'' if Gorbachev resorts to force.
   ``The Soviets will be in real trouble here _ no trade
agreements, no trade preferences and no more of the kind of
relations the Kremlin is desperately seeking from Washington,''
Dole said. ``It would be a severe blow to U.S.-Soviet relations.''
   The White House said Bush's message, sent through diplomatic
channels Thursday night, emphasized U.S. hopes for resolving the
conflict by peaceful dialogue. Bush declined to divulge exactly
what the letter said, calling it confidential.
   ``I do not want to risk misunderstanding by failing to
communicate,'' Bush said.
   It was Bush's first contact with Gorbachev since tensions began
escalating with Lithuania's March 11 declaration to secede from the
Soviet Union.
   ``I want to be sure that the Soviets understand our position and
understand that we're not trying to make things difficult for
Lithuania or the Soviet Union or anybody else,'' the president
said, talking with reporters at a picture-taking ceremony
   He cited the importance of ``staying in touch and being sure
there is no disconnect because of misinformation.''
   Later, while playing golf, Bush was asked if Gorbachev had
replied to his letter. ``What I said doesn't ... require any
answer,'' he replied.
   The United States has repeatedly voiced support for Lithuania's
right to self determination.
   At the same time, the Bush administration does not want the
dispute to lead to the removal of Gorbachev, who has championed
reforms in the Soviet Union and paved the way for the flowering of
democratic governments in Eastern Europe.
   A senior administration official said Gorbachev appears to be
under ``considerable domestic pressure'' because of the Lithuanian
crisis.
   Lithuania's secession, by itself, would not be a critical
episode for Moscow, the official said, ``but if that then becomes
the symbol for a whole bunch of areas around the periphery of the
Soviet Union, that would be very difficult.''
   The official, who commented on condition of anonymity, said,
``It isn't in anybody's interest to have this thing blow up.''
   The White House has alternated between tough rhetoric and near
silence about Moscow's response to Lithuania, first warning that
use of force would backfire and disrupt superpower relations and
then refusing to pass judgment on Soviet actions.
   Maintaining that low-key approach, White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We have not seen any _ too many episodes
in the last few days that have been very dramatic.
   ``But the problem is not resolved,'' he said. ``They're still
searching for solutions and we're hopeful that can be worked out.''
   Bush has been criticized by some members of Congress for not
being more aggressive in complaining about Soviet actions in
Lithuania.
   While acknowledging the criticism, Fitzwater said, ``We believe
our supporters far outnumber our critics on this issue.''
   In a display of solidarity with Lithuania, staged before news
cameras, three conservative senators telephoned President Vytautas
Landsbergis with words of encouragement for his struggle against
Moscow.
   Afterward, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said ``Our role is to
demand (independence) today, even though it may not be possible for
a month. It is to be outspoken. I think we can be a useful tool
(for Bush) and I don't mind lending ourselves for that purpose.''
The other senators were Republicans Frank Murkowski of Alaska and
Connie Mack of Florida.
   On Thursday, Fitzwater ruled out any direct contact by Bush with
Gorbachev, saying the president ``simply feels that this is not the
time to make a direct contact.''
   Asked about the sudden reversal, Fitzwater said Bush was moved
by, among other things, a telephone conversation Wednesday with
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and a meeting Thursday
with Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Kennedy met with Gorbachev in Moscow on Monday. Mrs. Thatcher
spoke with the Soviet leader by telephone this week.
   Kennedy said Gorbachev told him his efforts at reform were being
undermined by Western criticism of his actions in Lithuania.
   Fitzwater said that Bush felt ``this was a time for a personal
message that used his words and that President Gorbachev knew came
directly from him in expressing our position.''
   He said Bush ``clearly stated his support and the American
support for the aspirations of the Lithuanian people for
self-determination.
   ``We have expressed our belief and our emphatic view that a
resolution of this conflict lies in peaceful dialogue,'' Fitzwater
said. ``The president's message to President Gorbachev simply
reaffirmed our position as stated many times.''

<HEAD>Officials Will Seal Mass Grave Near World War II-Era Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORANIENBURG, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of people will remain
buried near a prison camp first used by the Nazis and then by the
Soviets because the dead ``should rest in peace,'' an official said
Friday.
   Local officials in Oranienburg discovered the remains at the
site this week after a resident said he saw Soviet soldiers gun
down hundreds of German prisoners there after World War II.
   The Nazis ran the prison camp near the town during World War II
and the Soviets later used it to intern German prisoners after the
war.
   ``Mass Grave of Unknown Victims _ Entry Forbidden,'' said the
sign posted after authorities unearthed dozens more remains on
Friday. Skeletal parts from 200 to 1,000 people, some of them
children, have been unearthed, officials said.
   They said that after more than four decades, identification of
the victims would be ``extremely difficult'' and that it would be
better not to further disturb the remains.
   Oranienburg authorities have now decided to seal off the mass
grave, said Heinz Erdmann, deputy Oranienburg district leader.
``The dead should rest in peace, they will not be transplanted,''
Erdmann said.
   ``The site will be turned into a memorial,'' Erdmann said.
   The camp, about 30 miles north of Berlin, is one of several Nazi
camps later used by the Soviets to hold German prisoners.
   East German soldiers digging in the wooded area near the site of
a former camp uncovered the skeletal remains of dozens more people
Friday.
   The remains, including skulls and nearly intact skeletons,
turned brown apparently from the soil in the region after more than
40 years under ground.
   Some of the skeletons apparently were stacked upon each other,
while others were found alone over an area of about 300 square
yards in the Schmachtenhagener woods outside the town.
   Few clothes or other belongings were found in the area, but
rusted and illegible military-type ``dog-tag'' identification
chains were found among the skeletons, soldiers working at the site
said.
   Also found were empty shell casings.
   The official news agency ADN reported this week that officials
ordered the excavation after a local resident said that in the
years after 1945, he witnessed naked prisoners being driven to the
site on trucks.
   According to the ADN report, the prisoners were forced to dig
their own graves before they were shot and buried. ``They were
piled on each other like sardines'' in the graves, the report said.
   ADN said the local prosecutor's office in Oranienburg has
recommended that a special government commission be set up to
investigate the mass burial site.
   Last weekend, East German officials reported that a mass grave
had been uncovered at Fuenfeichen near Neubrandenburg, another of a
total of 11 Nazi internment camps taken over by the Soviets in what
is now East Germany.
   The existence of the graves had long been suspected but little
evidence had surfaced until recently, after the old Communist
regime was toppled last fall.
   But it was unclear from whether the remains were from the
post-war Soviet era, the period of Nazi rule, or both.
   A West German official said 65,000 to 70,000 German prisoners
may have died at the post-war Soviet camps.
   During the Nazi era, 6 million Jews and hundreds of thousands of
gypsies, Poles and others were killed.

<TEXT>
   A couple indicted in the suspected cult
slayings of five family members pleaded innocent Friday to new
charges that they also were involved in another murder plot.
   A grand jury returned the new indictment Thursday, charging
Dennis S. Patrick, 35, and his wife, Tonya, 33, both of
Independence, Mo., with one count each of complicity to commit
aggravated murder.
   The indictment says the couple conspired to kill people in
connection with a takeover of the Kirtland Temple of the
Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a splinter
group of the Mormon Church.
   Judge James Jackson kept bond at $50,000 each on the new
charges. The pair were then led in handcuffs back to the Lake
County Jail, pending April trials.
   Lake County Prosecutor Steven LaTourette said additional charges
are expected against two other people.
   The Patricks and 11 others have been charged in the shooting
deaths last April of Dennis Avery, his wife, and their three
daughters. The Averys and the 13 people charged in their deaths
were in a cult group of former members of the Reorganized Church.
   LaTourette alleged that the victims were led one by one into a
barn, bound at the hands and feet with tape and shot to death. The
bodies of Avery, 49, his wife, Cheryl, 42, and their children _
Trina, 15, Rebecca, 13, and Karen, 7 _ were exhumed in early
January.
   Authorities have said the cult was led by Jeffrey Lundgren, a
former lay minister of the Reorganized Church who conducted tours
of the temple until he began preaching a radical theology and was
asked to leave the church.
   Ray Luffman, the pastor at the Kirtland Reorganized Church, has
said Lundgren told his followers Jesus Christ would return to the
temple and anyone not inside the building would perish.
   Former members who left the cult before the Avery killings have
told authorities cult members trained with guns as part of the plot
to take over the Kirtland temple. Luffman said he understood he was
among those targeted for death.
   The temple was built by Mormons in the 19th century on their
trek to Salt Lake City. Members of the Church of Jesus Christ
Latter-day Saints, known as the Mormons, have common roots but
aren't connected to the Reorganized Church.
   The Patricks pleaded innocent Jan. 16 to five counts each of
conspiracy to commit aggravated murder in the deaths of the Averys.
   Dennis Patrick's attorney, James Koerner, said he expects the
charges in the Avery killings to be dropped. He said the Patricks
hope to return to Missouri, where their 10-year-old daughter lives.
   All the suspects in the killings have been arrested. Nine have
been returned here to face charges, but four _ Jeffrey Lundgren,
39; his son, Damon, 19; Daniel Kraft, 25; and Kathryn Johnson, 36 _
have been jailed in San Diego since January.

<HEAD>Cholesterol Poses Risk for the Elderly After All</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Old people suffer more heart disease if their
blood cholesterol is high and they might benefit by eating less
fat, exercising and losing weight, a government study has concluded.
   The findings contradict earlier research which made some doctors
reluctant to advise elderly people to reduce their serum
cholesterol, said Dr. Dwayne Reed of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute.
   The study of 3,440 middle-aged and 1,419 elderly men in Hawaii
showed that a high level of cholesterol in the bloodstream
increased the risk of future heart disease among 65- to
74-year-olds just as it did for those age 50 to 59.
   The 20 percent of men with the highest cholesterol levels were
1.7 times more likely to develop heart disease within 12 years than
the 20 percent of men with the lowest levels, regardless of whether
they were middle-aged or elderly when the study started in 1977.
   That means people with high cholesterol _ levels above 240
milligrams of cholesterol per deciliter of blood _ ``should be
treated the same no matter what age they are,'' he added.
   Reed, an epidemiologist and physician who directs the
government's Honolulu Heart Program, presented the findings
Thursday during an American Heart Association conference.
   He said the results contradict some earlier findings of a famed
study that started in 1948 and linked high blood cholesterol, high
blood pressure and cigarette smoking to increased heart disease
among residents of Framingham, Mass. For years, the study found no
significant link between heart disease and cholesterol among people
65 and older.
   ``Previous to 1985-86, we would say it looks like cholesterol is
weak or non-existent as a risk factor in the elderly,'' said Dr.
Peter Wilson, laboratory director for the Framingham study.
   That's because there were too few elderly people in the study
until recent years, and their health hadn't been followed long
enough to reveal the cholesterol hazard, he added.
   Recent analyses of Framingham data confirm the Hawaii findings
linking high blood cholesterol and heart disease risk among people
65 and older, but ``there's been a lag in terms of communication to
the public,'' Wilson said.
   Wilson said the new study only demonstrates that cholesterol
raises heart disease risk in elderly people. It will be a few years
before studies determine if their risk can be reduced with
cholesterol-lowering drugs or by cutting dietary fat, losing weight
and increasing exercise.
   A majority of cholesterol experts believe all adults should
``know your cholesterol level and bring it down'' if it's above
240, first by dieting for a year, then by trying medications shown
to be safe, Wilson said. People with levels over 300 often need
medication immediately, he said.
   He noted that elderly heart disease patients already under a
doctor's care are the most likely targets for such treatment. Those
who should be checked for high cholesterol include seniors with
other coronary risk factors such as high blood pressure, cigarette
smoking or family history of heart disease.
   Experts are debating whether cholesterol testing would be worth
the cost for all senior citizens.
   Seniors with high cholesterol should see a doctor who doesn't
simply try to reduce total cholesterol, but tries to raise
so-called ``good'' cholesterol, or HDL, while reducing ``bad''
cholesterol, or LDL, Wilson said.
   He urged people to get their cholesterol tested through a doctor
who draws blood from a vein and has the blood tested by
sophisticated equipment. Experts have disputed the accuracy of
portable testing units that use blood from a finger stick. Such
units often are seen in shopping malls.
   Reed said some doctors still don't urge old people to quit
cigarettes because of earlier Framingham data that found no
increase in heart disease risk in elderly smokers. But Wilson said
most doctors and patients ``have gotten the message on smoking.''
   The men in the Hawaii study are of Japanese ancestry and have
lower heart disease death rates than white Americans. Reed said
research has shown that regardless of race, ``the biological causes
of heart disease are the same. ... And there is no reason to
believe their biological effect would change as people get older.''

<TEXT>
   Intruders ransacked the home Jennifer
Casolo returned to after her release from prison in El Salvador,
dumping files and papers onto her bedroom floor, but apparently
took nothing, police said.
   The intruders, who broke a window in the front door to get
inside Casolo's mother's apartment, also rifled a night table in
her mother's room and splashed fruit punch on the wall, police said.
   Casolo was a church worker in El Salvador when she was arrested
in November on charges of storing munitions in her back yard for
leftist Salvadoran rebels. Authorities released her for lack of
evidence and expelled her from the country.
   The break-in, discovered by Casolo's mother, Audrey Casolo, when
she returned home from work March 9, was similar to more than 100
others at homes and offices of people who oppose U.S. policy in
Central America, according to a New York-based civil rights
organization.
   Burglaries at the homes of opponents of U.S. military aid to El
Salvador and the Nicaraguan Contras were the subject of
congressional hearings in 1987, when the break-ins numbered 58.
   In most of the cases, intruders ignored cameras, stereos,
computers and office equipment, and zeroed in on files,
particularly membership, donor and mailing lists.
   The Center for Constitutional Rights, an organization of New
York lawyers, says it has documented 108 intrusions since 1983.
   Since returning home to Thomaston, Casolo has toured the United
States, speaking about her experiences and calling for an end to
military aid to El Salvador.

<HEAD>Beijing Mayor Denies Restrictions on Tiananmen Strolls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor of Beijing on Friday denied authorities
have warned citizens to stay away from Tiananmen Square, site of
last spring's bloody suppression of the pro-democracy movement, to
prevent ``protest strolls.''
   ``This is the first time I have heard such news,'' the mayor,
Chen Xitong, said when asked at a news conference about the
reported warnings. ``Everyone is allowed to take a walk anywhere.''
   Overseas-based Chinese dissident groups have called on students
and others to stroll through Tiananmen on April 1 and April 5 in a
silent protest against the crackdown of the student-led
pro-democracy movement last spring.
   The groups have suggested casual walks through the square, the
focal point of last year's movement, because of the certainty that
police would quickly break up any organized demonstration and
arrest participants.
   Chinese sources have reported work units and schools throughout
the city are telling workers and students to stay away from the
square on the two designated days.
   April 5 is ``Qingming'' or Gravesweeping Day, the annual day
when Chinese honor their dead. It has been suggested students might
use the occasion to honor Hu Yaobang, the reformist former party
chief whose death last April 15 touched off the student campaign
for democratic reform.
   In 1976, thousands of people streamed to Tiananmen on Qingming
to lay wreathes and flowers honoring Chou En-lai, the beloved
premier who had died in January. The violent suppression of that
spontaneous movement set the stage for the arrests of the
ultra-leftist ``Gang of Four'' and the end of the Cultural
Revolution later that year.
   Beijing students have received intensive political
indoctrination and have been under tight surveillance since the
democracy movement was crushed by military force last June 4.
   In private, many continue to condemn the repression and
corruption of the government, but say open opposition is unlikely
under the current harsh political climate.
   Mayor Chen asserted students are ``studying hard and behaving
very well.'' He said people who think students are troublemakers
have the wrong idea. The overwhelming majority, he said, support
the Communist Party and the socialist system.

   Soviet reaction to the unrest in
Lithuania prompted the U.S. State Department to cancel a Soviet
diplomat's speech at a small college here, school officials said
Friday.
   Soviet General Consul Gennady Zolotov was scheduled to speak
Friday evening on changing conditions in his country and improved
relations with the United States, said Roz Parry, a spokeswoman for
Sierra Nevada College.
   Late Thursday, however, Parry said the State Department, which
must approve any trip of more than 25 miles from the diplomat's San
Francisco base, told Zolotov to stay home. The order came after the
Soviets refused to give an American consular official in Leningrad
a travel permit to visit Lithuania.
   Kim Lamberty of the State Department's Soviet section said the
policy between the two countries remains one of strict reciprocity:
If one nation denies the request of another for an official visit,
the rebuff draws an immediate rejection by the other, Parry said.
   Zolotov was next on the list of Soviets scheduled for an
appearance in the U.S., Parry said.
   ``It's so terminally silly it's almost difficult to take it
seriously,'' said Mark Hurtubise, dean of the 165-student liberal
arts college near Lake Tahoe.
   ``I would have liked to think that we (Americans) would be able
to set an example for them in situations like this,'' he said. ``We
should be playing the role model here, not just showing them that
we can be as silly as they are.''
   Evgueni Fokine, Soviet vice consul in San Francisco, was
philosophical about the denial. ``It's a matter of reciprocity,''
he said. ``It happens.
   ``Travel in Lithuania is being restricted because of the turmoil
there,'' he said. ``Foreign diplomats have been ordered out because
of the danger. Is there turmoil and danger in Incline Village?''

   A woman whose young daughter was maimed by a
pipe bomb planted on a store shelf wishes whoever is responsible
for the attack could see the lasting effects of the cruel act.
   Erin Bower, 6, has been fitted with an artificial left hand and
is attending school. Next month she undergoes a cornea transplant
for her left eye, which also was damaged in the April 17, 1989,
blast at a K mart store.
   The person who put the bomb on the K mart shelf remains at large.
   ``We're so lucky that internally she's fine and mentally she's
fine. She's such a happy child. She really is,'' said Erin's
mother, Maureen Bower.
   ``I don't get down as frequently as I used to, but when we had
to make the decision on the cornea transplant, it rehashed all the
garbage again,'' the mother said.
   ``That's when I started frequently wishing that this person
would see what he has done. I got real upset with that person, and
I usually don't think about that person at all. But when you have
to relive all this again, it's tough,'' she said.
   Erin was shopping with her family at the K mart in Castleton
when she picked up a tube of toothpaste. The tube exploded.
   Federal agents remain optimistic they will crack the case
eventually.
   ``We believe we've finally turned the corner, and we're very
hopeful at this point,'' said Charles A. Petersen, agent in charge
of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in
Indianapolis. He declined to elaborate.
   Ed Verkin, an agent in the agency's Louisville, Ky., bureau,
says a laboratory examining fragments of the pipe bomb has found
some new evidence in the case, but he, too, declined to elaborate.
   Rewards totaling about $50,000 remain posted in the case.
   ``She's doing great,'' Mrs. Bower said. ``Emotionally, there is
no problem, which is an absolute miracle.''
   ``She hasn't missed a beat,'' said her father, Kevin. ``She'd
doing real well, getting very good grades. She's becoming more of a
little bit of a leader in her class.
   ``The kids have been great. They'll ask questions (about her
artificial hand) and look, but as soon as that period is over, they
don't even think about it,'' Bower said. ``They think Erin's like
everybody else.''
   As April 17 nears, the Bowers sense it will be a difficult day
but not an impossible one.
   ``It's hard to believe a year is coming up,'' Mrs. Bower said.
``I think that day will be kind of hard. I'm sure I'll think about
it an awful lot. I already think about it. But it's over with.
There's nothing we can do about it now. I think we're beyond it.

<TEXT>
   Soviet troops took over the building
housing the Lithuanian chief prosecutor's office late Friday after
staff members refused to work with a Moscow loyalist named as new
chief prosecutor by the Kremlin.
   The takeover was the first occupation of a government building
in Vilnius since Lithuania declared its independence on March 11,
and came as an abrupt reversal by the Soviets after initial steps
by both sides toward a compromise.
   Soldiers previously had occupied a few Communist Party buildings.
   Uniformed men early Saturday also moved into Lithuania's central
newspaper printing plant. They refused to identify themselves and
said only that they were protecting the building. Witnesses said
they saw at least seven men, armed with nightsticks.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis said on television the
decision to take over the prosecutor's office ``brings shame on the
Soviet Union.''
   ``They are trying to destroy the legal system. We have had these
challenges before. We have stood against them, and we will do it
again,'' he said.
   Premier Kazimiera Prunskiene told reporters after an emergency
session of the Presidium of the Lithuania parliament that the
government told employees of the prosecutor's office to try to work
in the building under the Lithuanian official rather than Moscow's
choice.
   Lithuanian legislator Egidius Bickauskas said earlier on TV that
the Soviet troops occupied the building with the help of an
employee. He did not elaborate.
   A foreign journalist rushed to the scene and said he saw a
truckload of Interior Ministry soldiers enter the building.
   Moscow earlier tried to force Lithuania to adhere to Soviet law
by firing Lithuania's chief prosecutor, Arturis Paulauskas, and
announcing he would be replaced by Antanas Petrauskas. The chief
prosecutor is basically a republic-wide district attorney.
   Soviet deputy prosecutor Alexei Vasiliev made the announcement
in a conference hall of the prosecutor's building in Vilnius. He
ordered the 100 staff members to enforce Soviet law.
   Staffers began arguing and shouting at Vasiliev and then walked
out.
   Hours later, the Soviet soldiers moved in.
   A duty officer at the Lithuanian Interior Ministry said soldiers
also had arrived at a Communist Party building, the Institute of
Party History.
   Other buildings under military control are the Institute of
Marxism-Leninism, the Higher Party School and Communist Party
headquarters. All are Communist Party buildings.
   Deputy Premier Kazimieras Motieka, speaking to reporters,
accused Vasiliev of bargaining in bad faith when he met with
Lithuanian officials earlier. Motieka attended that meeting.
   Vasiliev spoke politely of compromise with the Lithuanians when
``there's no question at that moment they already had this
planned,'' Motieka charged.
   He said soldiers told Lithuanian Interior Minister Marijonas
Misiukonis they were ``taking it (the buiding) over to enforce
security at the request of Vasiliev.''
   In other developments Friday:
   _Byelorussia, the republic just south of Lithuania, demanded the
return of territory given to Lithuania when the republic was
forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   _The republic of Estonia, also annexed by the Kremlin in 1940,
pledged to achieve full independence.
   _The KGB said it would enforce Soviet law in Lithuania and
protect Lithuanian citizens who cooperate with it.
   _The Council of the Federation, a new body of leaders in
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's government, directed Gorbachev to
tell Lithuania that before any talks on secession begin, the
republic must rescind laws contradicting the Soviet Constitution.
   The White House said President Bush sent a letter to Gorbachev
emphasizing U.S. hopes the conflict could be resolved peacefully.
Bush said the letter assured Gorbachev ``we're not trying to make
things difficult'' for either side.
   The United States has repeatedly voiced support for Lithuania's
right to self-determination.
   At the same time, the United States _ like other Western nations
_ does not want the dispute to lead to the removal of Gorbachev,
whose reforms have paved the way for democratic governments across
Eastern Europe.
   Byelorussia, known for its conservative leadership, said
Lithuania was given ``historically Byelorussian territory'' in a
half-dozen border regions when Soviet officials incorporated
Lithuania and set its borders 50 years ago.
   If Lithuania secedes, ``we will be forced to insist on the
return to the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist republic of
Byelorussian land,'' said the statement.
   The Estonian parliament did not set a date for full independence
from Moscow.
   For the past two days, both sides in the Lithuanian dispute had
taken steps toward compromise.
   The Defense Ministry on Thursday said it would not punish the
hundreds of Lithuanian deserters if they voluntarily returned to
their units.
   On Wednesday, the Lithuanian government said it was halting
plans to establish a border guard, and it advised citizens not to
resist if Soviet authorities came to seize their weapons.
   Chief Military Prosecutor Alexander Katusev said in an interview
on Soviet TV Friday that the Defense Ministry had been out of line
in offering amnesty.
   He said criminal cases had begun against all deserters. People
inciting deserters to leave the armed forces also will be
prosecuted, he said.
   The KGB, in a statement distributed by the Tass news agency,
said officers in Lithuania would continue to enforce Soviet law and
guard the border. It said a resolution passed Tuesday by
Lithuania's legislature demanding citizens stop cooperating with it
was illegal.
   In Moscow, the Council of the Federation charged that Lithuania
is ``stubbornly ignoring'' Soviet law.
   It said Gorbachev should demand Lithuanian laws contradicting
Soviet law be withdrawn before any talks can begin.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry officials told most of the few foreign
journalists remaining in Lithuania on Friday they would have to
leave by Sunday.

<TEXT>
   Britain's Prince Philip said Friday
population growth has created an environmental crisis that could be
``more devastating than any nuclear holocaust'' if unchecked.
   In a speech at the United Nations, Prince Philip said the
problem was caused by ``human scientific and technological genius''
that led to rampant population growth.
   ``It seems to me that it is about time that these same people,
the leaders in thought, in politics and in administration, began to
face the facts and started to make serious efforts to find ways of
solving the crisis,'' he said.
   ``The fuse of the population bomb has already been ignited and
the consequences of the explosion for the future of the world will
be a great deal more devastating than any nuclear holocaust,'' he
said in the speech sponsored by the U.N. Population Fund.
   Prince Philip, president of the Worldwide Fund for Nature, said
the ecological problems resulting from population growth are
compounded because the countries facing the most dire circumstances
are generally the poorest.
   The prince recommended more international support for aid
agencies so they can stabilize world population and avert
conditions threatening many plant and animal species.
   The U.N. Population Fund estimates the current world population
is nearly 5.3 billion people. But it projects the figure will be 14
billion by the year 2100.
   Prince Philip said that while increasing numbers of people is
the main problem for many poor countries, the increasing rate of
consumption in richer countries also is causing serious trouble.
   ``This leads to the inescapable conclusion that we are eating
into our capital assets, to the detriment of future generations,''
he said.
   ``As the forests shrink, as the marshes are drained, as the
rivers are polluted, as the dams, highways, railroads, factories
and houses are built, so the wildlife loses its habitat and, unable
to find any food and nowhere to breed, it just dies out.''
   Prince Philip also stressed the need to control hunting and
fishing to prevent the exploitation of animals.
   ``There can be no doubt that such practices should come under
some sort of international control, but the perpetrators claim that
the starving millions need the food and that they need the jobs,''
he said.
   ``It should not be very difficult to imagine the consequences of
the indiscriminate exploitation of a dwindling resource in order to
meet a rising demand.''

<HEAD>Hillary Warns Against Ecological Destruction of Himalayas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mountain climber Sir Edmund Hillary, who
made history in 1953 by conquering Mount Everest, said Friday that
tourist development since then has destroyed much of the beauty of
the Himalayas.
   Hillary and other speakers warned of widespread deforestation of
the mountains in speeches at the opening session of the two-day
First International Conference on Environmental Protection of the
Himalayas.
   The 70-year-old New Zealander recalled the remote valleys and
foothills he traveled before he and Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay
became the first to reach the top of Mount Everest on May 29, 1953.
   ``In 1951, the people lived a simple, hardy existence. Few of
them had ever seen a railroad train or a bus. Tourism was
unknown,'' Hillary said.
   ``Nowadays, tens of thousands are walking the hills tracks,
floating down the rivers, landing in tiny airstrips in remote
valleys. ... The living standards are increasing, but the beautiful
tracks and valleys have been littered and the forests destroyed.''
   The conference is sponsored by the Himalayan Adventure Trust,
which Hillary helped found two years ago, and by the Indian
Mountaineering Foundation.
   Hillary said tourism in the Himalayas must be spread more thinly
and visitors must take their trash with them when they leave.
   ``Tourist agents must be pressured to make sure their customers
leave the hills and valleys beautiful,'' he said.
   He said huge population increases have sent more farmers into
the Himalayas in search of survival. ``The local people are forced
higher and higher to cut trees and make terraces for their crops.
When will it ever stop?'' he asked.
   Maneka Gandhi, India's minister of state for environment and
forests, warned that deforestation and pollution would have
disastrous results reaching far beyond the Himalayan highlands.
   ``Today the Himalayas are crumbling,'' said Mrs. Gandhi,
sister-in-law of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. ``The
disappearance of the Himalayas will mean the desertification of
India and neighboring areas. We have to preserve the Himalayas or
we perish.''
   She said the new government of Prime Minister V.P. Singh was
considering a $175 million plan ``to re-green the Himalayas.''

   Occidental Petroleum Corp. said Friday it
discovered a ``potential malicious act'' that could have imperiled
350 men on a North Sea rig. Police said they were investigating.
   Occidental said a ``foreign object'' was found in non-operating
machinery on the Claymore rig _ sister platform to the Piper Alpha,
which exploded and burned July 6, 1988, killing 167 men 120 miles
off east Scotland. Claymore was shut down after the disaster, but
resumed partial production in August 1989.
   Occidental said the object was found in the gas compression
system, which was due to go back into operation in April. It did
not identify the object.
   Neither Occidental nor police would say if the act was being
viewed as a possible sabotage attempt.
   Claymore's 350 staff live and work on the installation _ 260 on
the platform, the rest on the adjoining support vessel Tharos.
   Occidental said, ``This appears to be a stupid and irresponsible
act which suggests the presence of someone on board the platform
who has no respect for the safety of his fellow workers. We will
not tolerate this behavior.''
   It said it summoned police and also notified the Department of
Energy. The company said it was withholding further information at
police request.
   Grampian Police said: ``We were advised by Occidental of an
incident on the Claymore platform and we are making inquiries into
it.'' A spokesman declined to comment further.

<TEXT>
   The United States has returned to
Panama more than $2 million confiscated by American troops during
the December invasion, Panamanian justice officials said Friday.
   During the invasion that began Dec. 20, U.S. troops raided homes
and offices of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Panama's ousted
strongman. U.S. soldiers also went through homes and offices of
Noriega associates, seizing documents, weapons, money and other
items.
   Marcos Ostrander, chief of U.S. International and Operational
Law, said in a letter accompanying the funds that authorities do
not know who the money belongs to. He said private funds should go
back to their owners but it was up to the Panamanians to decide how
to distribute the money.
   It was returned to Panamanian officials ``due to the form and
circumstances in which it was confiscated,'' said Elquilia Santos,
a Panamanian attorney general's office spokeswoman.
   The check for $2,015,750.21 was sent to the Panamanian
comptroller's office to determine how the funds will be used.

<HEAD>Keillor Says Artists Should Be Provocative</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Garrison Keillor, the soft-spoken humorist
known for his fond pokes at small-town America, told a Senate panel
Thursday that government-funded artists should be more provocative.
   ``I wish there were more of the controversial projects,''
Keillor told the Senate Labor and Human Resources subcommittee on
education, arts and humanities.
   The subcommittee is studying the renewal of the NEA, which has
been at the center of a controversy because of taxpayer-funded
exhibits of works judged by some to be pornographic and insulting
to religion.
   Speaking of his early struggles as a writer, Keillor said, ``I
remember very well when nobody else was but my mother and the
National Endowment was interested.''
   Defenders say only 20 projects out of 85,000 receiving NEA
funding in the last quarter century have been controversial.
   ``I think that that small number out of 85,000 is a remarkable
testament to how timid and self-repressed'' artists have become, he
said.
   He warned lawmakers against tying strings to funding, saying:
``If Congress doesn't do something about obscene art, we'll have to
build galleries twice as big to hold the people who want to go see
it. And if Congress does do something about obscene art, the
galleries will need to be even bigger than that.''

<HEAD>Thatcher: She, Kohl Agree Nuclear Weapons Must Stay in United
Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Friday she
has agreed with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany that nuclear
weapons must remain in Europe after the Germanys are unified.
   But Kohl refused to commit himself to her insistence that West
German-based NATO nuclear missiles, aimed at East Germany, should
remain after unification.
   ``We both agreed that the presence of nuclear weapons on
European soil _ and I think German soil is the preferred soil for
American nuclear weapons _ is vital,'' Mrs. Thatcher said, sitting
next to Kohl at a news conference winding up his two-day visit to
Britain.
   Kohl said: ``I think in the future, too, we need full protection
of NATO for the territory of Germany.''
   But he did not say outright that he wanted NATO nuclear weapons
to stay on German soil after unification, and Mrs. Thatcher
acknowledged her talks with Kohl were held in a ``rapidly changing
situation.''
   ``We have not in fact got down to the details ... that will be
negotiated through NATO,'' she said.
   While insisting that Germany wanted to map out its future in
close cooperation with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
its European Community partners, Kohl gave no clearcut reply when
asked if nuclear weapons should stay in Germany.
   ``I think the world has changed and within NATO we will have to
draw the consequences in reasonable discussions,'' he said.
   Kohl said Germany sought no special status or treatment within
NATO and did not want to be neutral or demilitarized.
   But he said that in negotiations to reduce conventional,
chemical and short-range nuclear weapons, ``I think that we can now
achieve enormous progress, progress that would have been
unthinkable one or two years ago.''
   Kohl reiterated that his goal was political unification of
Europe, something Mrs. Thatcher opposes.
   He said he was not angered by those who say European unity is
vital to ``control'' the might of a united Germany.
   ``We don't mind this argument, even if it is not very
flattering, because it's the goal that counts,'' he said.

<HEAD>GOP Rep. Bill Frenzel Retiring From Congress After 20 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE LAHAMMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Bill Frenzel, a leading
Republican spokesman on budget and tax issues, announced Friday he
would retire from Congress after representing Minnesota for 20
years.
   ``I have done this for a long time and it is now time for
someone else to do it,'' Frenzel, 61, said in announcing he won't
seek re-election this year.
   ``Every member of Congress knows when the time has come not to
run again,'' Frenzel told a news conference. ``For me, it is now.''
   Frenzel, the top Republican on the House Budget Committee and a
senior member of the Ways and Means Committee, is one of the most
respected fiscal conservatives in Washington and one of Minnesota's
most popular politicians.
   Frenzel has mixed economic conservatism with social liberalism
ever since he first won the 3rd District seat in 1970, in a close
race with a TV personality. He has won re-election by wide margins
ever since.
   He has represented the House GOP in virtually every important
budget conclave in recent years, including White
House-congressional summits and the National Economic Commission.
   House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel, R-Ill., said he was
devastated to hear of Frenzel's retirement. ``He's been the GOP's
most eloquent and intelligent spokesman on budget and tax issues
for many years,'' Michel said.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the Budget Committee
and a frequent Frenzel battler, on Friday praised his erstwhle foe
as ``one of the giants of this institution.''
   Even when unpopular to do so, Frenzel has taken the House floor
to point out the costs of legislation before the chamber.
   For example, just this week he pointed out that since the House
had not figured out how to pay for its $27 billion child day-care
legislation, those same children will find a big debt waiting for
them when they grow up.
   ``What a weird, tortured way of taking care of children _ by
giving them an IOU for $30 billion,'' he said.
   Frenzel said he has not decided if he will stay in Washington or
return to Minnesota to live. Although a friend of President Bush,
Frenzel said he has not received an offer for a post in the Bush
administration.
   ``I think there will be something out there,'' he said. ``It is
not that I am forced by some event to do this. It's just that I
think it is time to do it.''
   Frenzel won re-election in 1988 by more than a 2-1 margin. His
district is considered a Republican stronghold and includes
portions of Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Scott and a tiny portion of
Goodhue County.
   Rick Stafford, communications director of the state
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, said Frenzel was more popular than
the Republican Party. ``I think we really feel we have a good shot
at taking that seat with Frenzel not running again,'' he said,
   He described Frenzel as ``pro-choice, very moderate Republican;
moderate to liberal, matter of fact.''
   ``Frenzel was very popular with Democrats and Republicans'' he
said. ``He was liberal on a lot of social issues; the old-time
Republican that you don't see around much any more.''

   The man accused of killing 87 people by torching
an illegal social club in a jealous rage was indicted on 178 counts
of murder, arson and other charges Friday.
   A state grand jury indicted Julio Gonzalez on one count of
second-degree murder and one count of murder in the commission of a
felony for each person killed inside the Happy Land Social Club in
the Bronx.
   He also was indicted on two counts of arson and single counts of
attempted murder and assault. The defendant wasn't present when the
indictment was returned.
   Gonzalez, 36, who is due back in court April 12, could face a
sentence of 25 years to life if convicted on all counts in the
case, said Assistant District Attorney Eric Warner. If a judge made
the sentences run consecutively, he could receive a 2,000-year term.
   ``No case is open and shut,'' Warner said. ``We have a very good
case. The evidence is strong.''
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said it is
``conceivable'' that Gonzalez could be convicted of two murder
counts for each victim, but he said a jury ``probably would have to
choose between the two.''
   Gonzalez, a Cuban immigrant, opted against testifying before the
panel, said his court-appointed attorney, Richard W. Berne.
   While the grand jury considered the charges, authorities
released records indicating that one of the club's landlords was
contacted by a fire lieutenant eight months before the blaze and
told a vacate order was in effect against the building.
   Morris Jaffe, a partner in Little Peach Realty, responded that
the problem ``would be taken care of,'' according to a July 28,
1989, Fire Department document. Jaffe and Jay Weiss, the husband of
actress Kathleen Turner, are partners in Little Peach.
   Jaffe didn't return telephone messages left at his office Friday
seeking comment on the report.
   Weiss, Jaffe and their company were named in two more
multimillion-dollar negligence lawsuits filed Friday on behalf of
the families of fire victims. Also named were the club itself; the
building's owner of record, Alex DiLorenzo; and the City of New
York.
   One lawsuit asks for $100 million in damages; the second asks
for $57 million. Both were filed in Manhattan's federal court. The
day before, a $510 million lawsuit was filed by the mother of
another victim.
   Friday was the deadline for an indictment of Gonzalez, who has
been held on murder and arson charges since Sunday. He had not
entered a plea in the case because he hadn't been indicted.
   Gonzalez, brought to court earlier in the day on another matter,
was returned to Bellevue Hospital, where he was under 24-hour
watch. A shotgun-wielding correction officer accompanied the
suspect back and forth from the court, and no other prisoners are
permitted within 20 feet of him at Bellevue, his lawyer said.
   Berne said he hoped to arrange a psychiatric examination for
Gonzalez soon.
   ``Obviously, one potential avenue of defense is psychiatric,''
said Berne. ``It's always a possible defense. Now I'm looking
through doors, and I will (decide) ... which door I want to walk
through.''
   Berne said Gonzalez was exhausted when they met Thursday night.
   ``Imagine what he's been through. He's very tired,'' Berne told
reporters at state court in the Bronx.
   Gonzalez, enraged by a girlfriend's rejection, spilled gasoline
in the entrance to the Happy Land social club early Sunday and set
it ablaze, authorities said. Eighty-seven patrons died inside the
cramped club, which catered largely to immigrants from Honduras.
   His attorney said he was going into the case without any
preconceptions.
   ``All you hear at this stage is the worst of everything. I
wouldn't be a very good lawyer if I rendered a decision on what
I've read in the newspapers,'' Berne said.
   The Red Cross was preparing a charter flight to carry more than
40 bodies back to Honduras Saturday. In Albany, the New York
National Guard said the Honduran government had withdrawn a request
for its help in transporting victims' bodies.
   Six victims were buried Friday at St. Raymond's Cemetery in the
Bronx, and dozens of mourners attended a wake Friday evening for
three others.
   One of the few patrons to survive the fire, meanwhile, was
interviewed about the scene at Happy Land when the fire broke out.
   Felipe Figueroa said the club's disc jockey, Ruben Valladares,
was playing a Jamaican reggae song when the club doorman rushed up
the deadly narrow staircase yelling, ``Fuego! fuego!'' or fire,
fire.
   ``Right away, people went crazy,'' he said in the interview with
The New York Times. ``Everybody was running around.''
   He said he made his way down a narrow staircase and out the
door, and then saw Valladares, who was a friend of his, come out in
flames. The disc jockey remains hospitalized with burns over 40
percent of his body.
   ``My mind can't stop,'' Figueroa said. ``All the screams, all
the noise, and the moment when my friend came out of there
screaming. I can't forget that.''
   Authorities are unsure how many people survived but most
accounts put the number at five or six.

<BYLINE>Court is Asked to Curb US Trade with Labor Rights Violators

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Organizations led by former Labor Secretary
Ray Marshall asked a court on Thursday to make President Bush deny
trade privileges to countries that violate their citizens' labor
rights.
   The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia. It did not name countries, but a press
statement said the organizations have documents to show violations
in Guatemala, El Salvador, Malaysia, Haiti, the Philippines,
Thailand, Turkey and Indonesia, among others.
   About 140 areas are privileged to ship some of their products to
the United States duty-free, or at reduced duties, under what is
called the Generalized System of Preferences. The reduced duties
allow the products to be sold in this country at lower prices than
similar goods from other countries. The system is designed to help
the Third World countries develop their industries.
   The law setting up the system limits the benefits to countries
that respect internationally recognized worker rights. These
include a ban on child labor, special provisions for women, the
right to form labor unions and others.
   Under this provision, U.S. authorities have banned Nicaragua,
Romania and Burma from the program and suspended Paraguay, Chile
and the Central African Republic. Marshall and the other
complainants consider that inadequate.
   ``The Bush administration's refusal to enforce the law gives
large, multinational firms a windfall at the expense of both
American and foreign workers,'' Marshall said in a statement.
   ``Businesses can earn great profits in developing countries
relatively free from labor regulation, export their products
duty-free to the U.S. market, displace American workers, and take
advantage of unprotected foreign workers.''
   The complaint was filed by the AFL-CIO and 22 other labor unions
and private groups, including Marshall's own International Labor
Rights Education and Research Fund, an advocacy group. It asked the
court to interpret the law and to order Bush and his administration
to review the rights of labor in all the countries that benefit
from it.
   The office of U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the
action had been signalled in advance but it had no comment. Bush
and six members of his Cabinet named as defendants, including Ms.
Hills, have 60 days to reply.

<TEXT>
   Italian parliamentarians have signed a petition
urging the governor of California to stop the scheduled April 3
execution of Robert Alton Harris, convicted of killing two
teen-agers in 1978.
   Late Friday in San Francisco, a federal appeals court blocked
the scheduled execution, saying Harris may not have received
competent psychiatric help at the time of his trial.
   The petition drive was organized by ``Non Uccidere,'' or ``Thou
Shall Not Kill,'' a group that campaigns against the death penalty.
It was addressed to Gov. George Deukmejian and signed by 200
legislators from across the political spectrum.
   ``The death penalty is against the value of human life in every
case. It would be even more hideous if applied to Robert Harris,
whose life has been marked by pain and suffering,'' it said.
   The petition described Harris' personal story as ``terrifying,''
noting that he was born prematurely after his father kicked his
alcoholic mother, and that he was beaten as a young child.
   It urged Deukmejian to ``leave inactive your state's gas chamber
to give the world an example of civility, to affirm the coherence
of the choice of democracy, to respect the international treaties
on human rights.''
   Harris, 37, was convicted of abducting and killing two
16-year-old San Diego boys 12 years ago. He would become the first
person executed in California since 1967.

   The prosecutor at John Poindexter's trial
asked jurors in final arguments Friday to ignore former President
Reagan's ``biased'' testimony and convict his national security
adviser of Iran-Contra coverup charges.
   But Poindexter's attorney said the defendant had merely gotten
caught in a political battle between Congress and the White House
and had done ``his ever-loving best to give as much information as
he could tell'' rather than conspiring to hide the affair.
   Poindexter had done his job for Reagan, ``the driving engine
behind his actions,'' said defense lawyer Richard Beckler.
   Prosecutor Dan K. Webb said in his summation that there was
``overwhelming evidence'' that Poindexter lied to Congress and
destroyed documents to cover up the diversion of Iran arms sale
profits to help the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when aid was banned by
Congress.
   Webb ridiculed the defense's decision to call Reagan as its
``star witness,'' calling it an attempt to persuade jurors to
ignore the facts.
   Reagan ``didn't have the slightest clue'' whether Poindexter
participated in the crimes charged in the indictment, Webb said.
   The defense hoped that ``just because the president testified
you ought to acquit John Poindexter,'' Webb said. ``That defense is
an insult to your intelligence.''
   Poindexter's attorney told jurors that Reagan resisted
testifying and did not come ``as a friendly witness.'' He defended
the former president's value as a witness, saying: ``the fact he
forgot some things does not mean his testimony was not relevant.''
   The eight hours of Reagan's videotaped testimony, taken in
February in Los Angeles, was played for the jury last week by the
defense, which rested its case Wednesday without calling Poindexter
to the stand.
   The case, which began with jury selection March 5, is expected
to go to the jury Monday after the judge gives his final
instructions.
   Beckler told jurors Friday that Poindexter, a retired Navy rear
admiral, should not have to pay for the misdeeds of his former
aide, Oliver L. North, who was convicted of charges last year.
   ``If Oliver North did something wrong, that is Oliver North's
responsibility. That is not Admiral Poindexter's responsibility,''
said Beckler, who tried to paint North as a renegade operator in
the Iran-Contra affair.
   ``There were absolutely many things that Admiral Poindexter
didn't know Oliver North was doing,'' Beckler said.
   Poindexter was not a member of ``some grimy little conspiracy
that the prosecution would have you believe,'' Beckler said.
   ``He is a victim of a concerted action by Congress, working
hand-in-hand with the independent counsel's office to try to do
something with this political battle'' between Congress and the
White House, Beckler said.
   Through much of Beckler's 2{-hour summation, Poindexter's wife
Linda sat in the front row of the spectator's gallery holding
4-year-old grandson Zachary on her lap.
   Prosecutor Webb attacked Reagan's testimony, saying ``Ronald
Reagan didn't seem to remember anything in this case'' and
demonstrated bias at one point by turning and winking at Poindexter.
   ``When people come into court we expect them to give fair and
truthful testimony,'' Webb said. ``But when a person is so biased
he turns to wink at someone as if to say `Did that last answer help
you, John?' _ I would have expected more from a former president
than that,'' Webb said.
   Webb ridiculed Reagan's defense of three letters Poindexter sent
to Congress in July, 1986, which the prosecution charges falsely
deny that the National Security Council staff was secretly
orchestrating arms shipments to the Contras.
   The prosecutor recalled that when Reagan was shown one of the
letters, the former president said he agreed with its contents and
added ```I would have added in a profanity.'''
   ``He gave that testimony because he hoped it would help John
Poindexter,'' Webb said. ``He hadn't the foggiest idea those were
false letters sent to obstruct Congress.''
   Beckler argued the letters were, in fact, truthful. He said
Reagan mentioned including profanity in the response because the
lawmaker's request for information as ``nothing more than an
attempt by Congress to take a shot at the administration's position
on Contra support.''
   Webb reminded jurors that on cross-examination, Reagan said he
never authorized Poindexter to lie or destroy documents.
   Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago appointed by Reagan,
argued that Poindexter tore up a document authorizing U.S.
involvement in Iranian arms sales to protect Reagan from political
embarrassment.
   ``This is the one document in the world that puts the lie to
what Ronald Reagan told the American people'' when he denied in a
Nov. 13, 1986, speech that he had sold arms to Iran to try to free
American hostages, Webb said.
   The document, an intelligence ``finding'' signed by Reagan in
December 1985, authorized the CIA's involvement a month earlier in
the shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. It described the transaction
as an effort to free U.S. hostages.
   Webb said that Poindexter, after lying to two congressional
committees on Nov. 21, 1986, about U.S.-Iran arms sales, returned
to his office and ``he tore up the original finding signed by the
president of the United States.''
   The prosecutor, ripping up a copy of the document to dramatize
his point, said, ``The act of tearing up that finding is strong
evidence'' Poindexter ``intended to obstruct Congress.''
   Webb said it ``was not a coincidence'' that both Poindexter and
then-CIA Director William Casey, who died in 1987, lied to Congress
that day about the 1985 Hawk shipment. ``That was an obstruction of
Congress by two of the highest ranking people in the government of
our nation,'' the prosecutor said.
   Poindexter, who served as Reagan's national security adviser
from late 1985 until his resignation on Nov. 25, 1986, is also
accused of deceiving Congress about White House involvement in
covert assistant to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Webb recounted North's testimony that he was ``generally
instructed'' by Poindexter to lie to lawmakers about the secret aid
network.
   North ``was there because the defendant on trial in this case,
his commander, sent him there to do that,'' Webb said. ``The boss
can't escape legal responsibility just because he didn't get his
hands dirty.''

   A federal appeals judge on Friday blocked
next Tuesday's scheduled execution of convicted double murderer
Robert Alton Harris, who would have become the first inmate
executed in California in 23 years.
   Harris, convicted of shooting two teen-age boys to death in 1978
to use their car in a robbery, may not have had competent
psychiatric help at the time of his trial, said Judge John Noonan
of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   ``It is reasonably arguable, and we cannot determine from this
record, whether Harris received competent psychiatric assistance,''
said Noonan.
   His order, issued after a 50-minute hearing, would spare Harris
the gas chamber to allow arguments before a three-judge panel of
the court on whether the convict should get an evidentiary hearing.
That process normally takes several months.
   In Sacramento, Attorney General John Van de Kamp said he would
ask the U.S. Supreme Court to lift the stay.
   ``It's potentially possible to get it lifted before Tuesday,''
said Chief Assistant Attorney General Richard Iglehart.
   ``We would argue that it's impossible for psychiatrists to go
back and review what other psychiatrists did years ago,'' said Van
de Kamp.
   ``(The decision) creates a brand-new legal right for accused
murderers like Robert Harris _ the right to challenge the
competency of psychiatric experts years after the fact. We believe
this reading of the law is in error.''
   Michael McCabe, one of Harris' lawyers, said, ``We're very happy
that our client's life has been spared. We're pleased that Judge
Noonan ... was not stampeded by the wave of public attention
generated here.''
   Harris, 37, would be the first person executed in California
since 1967. He came within four days of execution once before, in
1982.
   ``This stuns me. How many times does this guy have to be turned
down?'' said William Stalder, uncle of John Mayeski, one of Harris'
victims. ``This just keeps the wound open. It keeps us waiting and
waiting.''
   Noonan, a conservative appointee of former President Ronald
Reagan, said his order was ``a vindication of the state and federal
interest that no one be put to death without due process of law.''
   He said U.S. District Judge William Enright of San Diego, who
turned down Harris' last-ditch appeal Wednesday, should have held a
fact-finding hearing on new psychiatric evidence submitted by the
defense.
   That evidence includes reports by psychologists who concluded
that the psychiatric consultants who assisted Harris' trial lawyer
acted incompetently by failing to test for brain damage or other
serious mental disorders.
   Enright had rejected those conclusions without an evidentiary
hearing. He said the dispute amounted to a mere disagreement among
experts, wasn't the fault of the state and wouldn't have affected
the jury's decision.
   It takes two votes on the three-member appellate panel to return
the case to Enright for an evidentiary hearing. Noonan's order, if
it stands, would block the execution and allow further written
arguments and a hearing before the full panel to decide on an
evidentiary hearing.
   Harris' current appeal, filed after the U.S. Supreme Court
turned him down for the fourth time this January, is based largely
on examinations that concluded he had organic brain damage and
other mental disorders that affected his ability to control his
impulses.
   Harris was convicted in 1979 of killing John Mayeski and Michael
Baker, both 16, in San Diego in July 1978.
   He had abducted the boys at gunpoint from a drive-in restaurant
as they sat in their parked cars. He forced them to drive to a
remote area where he shot them so he could use their car in a bank
robbery.
   In last week's appeal, Harris' lawyers challenged the evaluation
of a state mental health expert who characterized the defendant as
a sociopath incapable of remorse or rehabilitation. They also
claimed that abuse in childhood and his mother's heavy drinking
during her pregnancy with him exacerbated Harris' mental disorders.

   The former manager of a failed credit union
is mentally incompetent to stand trial on federal charges stemming
from allegations he diverted money for his own use, a magistrate
said Friday.
   Lawrence E. King Jr. understands the nature and consequences of
the charges against him, but would be unable to help in his defense
in what is expected to be a long trial, U.S. Magistrate Richard
Kopf said.
   King, 45, a prominent businessman who sang the national anthem
at the 1984 Republican National Convention, is charged with
conspiracy, fraud and filing false tax returns in the failure of
Franklin Community Federal Credit Union.
   Kopf said he would recommend that King be kept in federal
custody and taken to the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners
at Rochester, Minn., for treatment.
   The magistrate based his decision on a report prepared by Dr.
Dorsey Dysart, chief psychiatrist at the U.S. Medical Center in
Springfield, Mo., who has diagnosed King as suffering from
``probable delusional paranoid disorder _ grandiose type.''
   A patient with such a disorder believes he has great powers to
do things other people can't.
   Kopf said the psychiatrist noted that ``the intellectual system
of grandiosity leads to disorganization of thought processes which
gravely impairs the ability of Mr. King to withstand a lengthy
trial.''
   King faces 40 counts in from the failure of the Franklin
Community Federal Union. Officials said $39 million was missing
from the credit union, which had been established to help north
Omaha's poor, when it was closed on Nov. 4, 1988.
   King's wife, Alice, also faces charges stemming from the credit
union's failure.
   Soon after it failed, stories began surfacing of alleged sexual
abuse at parties thrown by credit union officials. Authorities who
first investigated didn't file any such charges, but the
allegations were aired in a legislative investigation and the
matter was taken up by a county grand jury.
   King hasn't been charged with any such offense.
   The magistrate said he would recommend to U.S. District Judge
William G. Cambridge that King be committed to a hospital for
treatment, generally consisting of anti-psychotic medication and
psychotherapy. In addition, Kopf will ask that a report be given to
the court within four months on whether King could face trial in
the foreseeable future.
   Kopf also set a Monday deadline for any objections to the order.
   Alan Stoler, who represented King in the competency proceedings,
said he does not expect to appeal the magistrate's findings.
   Two other court-appointed attorneys defending King against the
criminal charges, Steven Achelpohl and Marilyn Abbott, said they
will not appeal the ruling.
   U.S. Attorney Ron Lahners said the prosecution agrees that King
is not competent to stand trial, and he expects Cambridge to sign
the order soon.
   ``It's in the best interest of the defendant to get back into
treatment,'' Lahners said.
   King, however, believes he is competent to stand trial, Kopf
said.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Cecil Andrus, confronted with thousands
of pleas and a threatened potato boycott by opponents of Idaho's
abortion bill, on Friday vetoed what would have been the most
restrictive state abortion law.
   The veto ended the hopes of anti-abortion groups who wanted to
use an Idaho law to challenge the U.S. Supreme Court's commitment
to legalized abortion, embodied in its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.
   Andrus, an anti-abortion governor who said he agonized over
provisions of the legislation, explained his decision by saying the
bill does not provide a woman and her family any flexibility in
cases of rape and incest.
   ``The bill is drawn so narrowly that it would punitively and
without compassion further harm an Idaho woman who may find herself
in the horrible, unthinkable position of confronting a pregnancy
that resulted from rape or incest,'' he said in a written statement
read at a 5 p.m. news conference.
   The veto effectively killed the bill, since state legislators
had conceded they did not have enough votes to gain the two-thirds
majority needed to override the veto. In addition, the Legislature
adjourned its session at 4:32 p.m. Friday, and can be called back
only by the governor.
   But Republican Rep. Gary Montgomery, one of the bill's main
architects, said anti-abortion lawmakers would refine the
legislation and press it again in the 1991 session.
   The veto ``is the most significant demonstration to date of the
power, depth and intensity of the pro-choice movement,'' said Kate
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League in Washington, D.C.
   But she warned that the abortion-rights movement remains
vulnerable.
   ``Despite our victories, it only takes one anti-choice
legislature to pass one anti-choice, test-case bill that is signed
into law by one anti-choice governor for the right to choose to be
stripped from every American woman,'' Ms. Michelman said. ``It will
only take one case to challenge Roe in the U.S. Supreme Court.''
   John Willke, president of the National Right to Life Committee,
said:
   ``Gov. Andrus today abandoned thousands of unborn children who
will continue to die needlessly in Idaho. He has bowed to the
hollow threats and pressure tactics of pro-abortion extremists who
insist abortion be available as a method of birth control.''
   Willke said the veto ``is not only unprincipled, but politically
unwise. This veto will galvanize the pro-life majority in Idaho and
nationwide.''
   Andrus, who is running for an unprecedented fourth term, said he
had consulted with legal scholars of both political parties who
said there was not the ``remotest chance'' of the Supreme Court
upholding such a law.
   He also said the financial burden for the state to defend the
bill in court would have been excessive, with estimates running as
high as $1.5 million.
   The bill called for outlawing abortion except in cases of
non-statutory rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim
is under 18, severe fetal deformity or a threat to the life or
health of the woman.
   The governor had said Thursday he was concerned that other women
who have been raped, victimized by incest or faced a threat to
their own lives might not be able to obtain a justified abortion.
   On Friday, Andrus said many of his own reservations about the
bill, which would have banned more than 90 percent of the 1,500
abortions performed in Idaho each year, were known to lawmakers as
they considered it.
   ``But all were shunted aside in the frenzy to pass a bill that,
by the sponsors' own admission, was conceived outside of our state
for the sole purpose of getting this issue back before the Supreme
Court,'' he said.
   ``I believe, and I am confident the people of Idaho believe,
that we can make our own judgments on this terribly important issue
without outside pressure and outside influence or threats,'' Andrus
said.
   The governor has repeatedly reaffirmed his opposition to
abortion except in cases of rape, incest and to save the woman's
life.
   Right to Life spokesman Douglas Johnson said his group was not
sure where it would now turn to test Roe v. Wade, with many state
legislatures declining to take on the issue despite a Supreme Court
ruling last year that allowed them to impose some restrictions.
   A new law in the U.S. territory of Guam prohibits abortions
except when a pregnancy endangers a woman's life, and is currently
the target of a class-action lawsuit. In Pennsylvania, sections of
a tough law restricting abortions have been stayed by a judge
because of challenges from abortion-rights groups.
   The debate over the Idaho bill promised to spill over into
coming gubernatorial campaign.
   Johnson said anti-abortion forces would support an anti-abortion
opponent if the three-way Republican primary yields one. Two of the
three challengers oppose abortion.
   Ms. Michelman, of the national abortion-rights group, said the
organization would back Andrus in his campaign, despite his
continued opposition to abortion.
   ``We will be there to support him, and the people of Idaho will
support him because a majority of the people of Idaho disagreed
with what the Legislature did,'' Ms. Michelman said.
   Before the veto was announced, Andrus remained closeted in his
inner office as staff members handled a tide of phone messages,
which were running 2-to-1 for a veto of the bill.
   ``There are only so many lines,'' receptionist Jean Jewell said.
``We couldn't handle any more.''
   Since the bill banning abortion as a method of birth control
cleared its first major legislative hurdle in the House three weeks
ago, more than 21,000 telephone calls, letters and petitions came
into the office.
   Since Wednesday morning, the staff had begun counting
out-of-state calls separately; they were running about three times
greater than those from Idahoans.
   Abortion-rights groups, led by the National Organization for
Women, had called for a boycott of Idaho products if Andrus signed
the measure. The focus of the boycott would have been Idaho's
potato crop, a mainstay of the state's economy.
   In response, anti-abortion activists began mailing potatoes to
NOW.
   In a separate development, a Nebraska legislator who favors
abortion-rights began a filibuster Friday after anti-abortion
forces tried to bring up a bill requiring a minor to notify her
parents before getting an abortion.
   Anti-abortion groups had hoped the Idaho bill could give the
U.S. Supreme Court the opportunity to reverse Roe vs. Wade, its
1973 decision legalizing abortion.
   Since the night before final legislative approval last week,
abortion-rights forces have staged candlelight vigils on the
Capitol steps urging a veto.

<TEXT>
   A state appeals court issued a decision three
days before a Bronx social club fire that probably strengthens the
victims' families' chances of successfully suing the owner or
landlord of the fire site.
   One victim's mother has already sued the owners, lessees and
proprietors of the club for $510 million, her lawyer said Thursday.
Many other relatives of the 87 people who died already have
contacted lawyers.
   But their success seems to depend on their ability to collect
from the only potential defendants with substantial assets or
insurance _ the building's owner, Alex DiLorenzo, and its
landlords, Jay Weiss and Morris Jaffe.
   The families' case appears to have been buttressed by a March 22
ruling by a state appeals court.
   In a 3-2 decision, the panel ruled that an owner of real estate
who allows it to be used for an unlawful purpose can be liable for
damages caused by the illegal activity to innocent people who are
not tenants.
   The case involved 9-year-old Miguel Muniz, who was blinded by
stray gunfire from a Harlem building that had been a center of drug
dealing. The appellate panel reversed a judge who had ruled that
the landlord could not be held liable for damages.
   Aaron Broder, the lawyer who represented the boy and is advising
plaintiffs' lawyers in the social club case, said courts have
tended to rule that unless harm to an innocent third party flowed
from a building defect over which a landlord had direct control,
the landlord could not be held liable.
   The social club was the scene of arrests for illegal alcohol
sales and was repeatedly cited for building and safety code
violations, including the lack of fire alarms, sprinklers and
emergency exits. The city's Buildings Department finally ordered it
closed. A copy of the order was tacked to the club's front door,
and at least one copy was supposed to have been sent to Dilorenzo
or Weiss and Jaffe.
   The chain of control begins with DiLorenzo, who owns the
building and gave a 30-year lease to Weiss and Jaffe. They, in
turn, leased the premises to Elias Colon, who operated the social
club.
   Since Colon died in the fire _ and is not thought to have had
substantial assets or insurance _ plaintiffs' attorneys will focus
on the owner and the landlord, arguing that they were aware, or
should have been aware, of the illegal uses of the premises and
should have done something.
   The Muniz case is particularly relevant because, as in the case
of the social club, the landlord already had gone to court seeking
the tenant's eviction for non-payment of rent, not for breaking any
law or regulation.
   ``The court (in Muniz) held that if a landlord has sought to
evict a tenant for non-payment and does not choose to seek eviction
for other reasons, it's evidence of his potential negligence,''
Broder said.
   ``The landlord demonstrated he was capable of using the courts,
but only when it was profitable to him.''
   But a real estate lawyer, Flora Schnall, said the fact Weiss and
Jaffe were trying to evict Colon was more important than why.
Non-payment of rent, she said, ``is the easiest thing to evict
someone for. It's very difficult to evict someone for illegal
uses.''

   House Democrats are tempting a presidential
veto by rejecting the White House version of a child-care bill in
favor of their own more costly and ambitious plan.
   The House approved the measure, estimated to cost at least $27
billion over its first five years, just hours after a spokesman for
President Bush issued a fresh veto threat Thursday.
   ``Rather than waving his veto pen, our president should match
his warm words with good deeds and agree to sign our child-care
bill,'' House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., said after
the vote.
   The bill still must go to a House-Senate conference to resolve
differences with the Senate. But Democrats hoped the ultimate
version would mirror the House bill and that election-year
pressures would make Bush back down from his threat.

   The Senate appears on track to approving a
sweeping air pollution control bill next week after narrowly
rejecting $500 million in aid to coal miners who could lose their
jobs because of tougher environmental standards.
   By a 50-49 vote Thursday, senators defeated a proposal that Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., called only a matter of ``fairness ... and
justice'' because thousands of miners will be thrown out of work.
   The majority heeded warnings from Senate leaders that the
amendment would prompt a presidential veto of the overall bill.
   The three-year, $500 million assistance program was considered
to be the last major obstacle to Senate passage of the clean air
bill. A vote on the legislation is scheduled for next Tuesday. A
House version is in committee.

   Life expectancy in the United States has never
been higher, but disparities remain between whites and blacks,
federal researchers say.
   Overall U.S. life expectancy rose to 75 years, according to 1987
data, the Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   That was up 0.2 years _ about 73 days _ from 1986, said Ken
Kochanek, a statistician with the CDC's National Center for Health
Statistics in Hyattsville, Md.
   The life-expectancy concept means that someone born in 1987
would live, on the average, 75 years. Women, on average, outlive
men by 6.9 years.

   The Food and Drug Administration is hoping for a
consensus among health experts and food companies on how to make
sure consumers striving for health and fitness aren't fooled by
product labels and advertising.
   Executives from some of the country's largest food corporations
met Thursday with federal officials at a conference prompted by FDA
proposals to tighten regulation of food health claims.
   ``We're trying to define boundaries so consumers can believe
what's on that label,'' said Fred Shank, the agency's director for
food safety and applied nutrition.
   At the heart of the debate: a conflict over what diet and health

   The president of a U.S. defense contractor says
he cooperated with a sting that averted shipment of 40 nuclear
detonators to Iraq because he feared nuclear weapons in the hands
of ``irresponsible'' countries.
   The sting came as part of an 18-month investigation by U.S. and
British customs agents that culminated in a federal indictment
against five people and two British companies.
   Jerold Kowalsky, an engineer and president of CSI Technologies
Inc., said he alerted U.S. agents in 1988 to inquiries from alleged
representatives of Iraq into his company, which makes electronic
triggers to military specifications.
   He said Thursday that the possibility of the devices falling
into the hands of the Iraqi government disturbed him.

   Lawmakers have approved a new way to
finance and run Kentucky's public schools, abolishing a system the
state Supreme Court said shortchanged poor districts and dragged
down test scores.
   The House voted 58-42 Thursday to approve the overhaul _ which
includes a $1.26 billion tax increase and decentralization of
control over day-to-day operation of the 570,000-student system _
and sent it to Gov. Wallace Wilkinson. The Senate passed the
measure 30-8 on Wednesday.
   The governor has hailed the plan as ``history in the making.''
   ``It's the first time that any state has scrapped its existing
system and started over again,'' said Frank Newman, president of
the Education Commission of the States, a federally supported
research organization.

<HEAD>Scientists Trying to Make Japan a Space Leader</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>UCHINOURA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At a small center with a single launch
pad in the hills of Uchinoura, scientists are trying to make Japan
a leader in space.
   Private Japanese companies count on them to succeed, and have
elaborate plans ranging from mines on the moon to a doughnut-shaped
orbiting hotel that would make its own gravity.
   The government is known for targeting new technologies with
well-financed research programs, but Uchinoura's budget is small.
Scientists stretch it by doing the work of technicians, even
checking the rockets.
   Staff members shiver during winter liftoffs because building
heaters are shut down so the limited electrical supply can power
the launch equipment.
   Despite years of trailing the United States and Soviet Union in
both glamor and spending, the Japanese space industry has built a
respected technical foundation and is aiming toward its own manned
space program.
   Scientists at Uchinoura's Institute of Space and Astronautical
Science put a satellite into lunar orbit March 19, using a small
M3S-2 rocket. That made Japan only the third nation to probe the
moon.
   Japan's other government-financed space organization, the
National Space Development Agency, test-fired a sophisticated
engine March 7 for the H-2 rocket, which will compete with U.S.,
Soviet and European rockets in payload capacity.
   So far, Japanese aerospace companies usually have been
subcontractors for overseas firms or have manufactured products
under foreign licenses.
   ``In the past, other nations took the initiative in space and
Japan participated passively, but in the future Japan will take the
lead more often,'' said Tomifumi Godai, director of the Space
Development Agency.
   As with many earlier industrial successes, Japan has avoided
expensive space failures by licensing proven technology and
gradually improving on it.
   ``It's the same old story,'' says Keisuke Kasagi, a senior
analyst in Tokyo for W.I. Carr securities. ``Japan developed
everything from foreign technology, and then went on to develop its
own domestic technology.''
   The workhorse H-1 rocket uses 25-year-old U.S. Delta technology
developed by McDonnell Douglas, with Japanese improvements that
include a new second-stage engine.
   McDonnell Douglas recently asked Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
chief contractor on the H-1, to supply it with the new engines for
U.S. rockets, according to Japanese space officials.
   ``When I attend international meetings these days, I'm often
asked by other countries whether we will sell them technology,''
Godai told reporters.
   An important gauge of that technology will be whether Japan can
complete development of the H-2 rocket independently. The engine
caught fire in two tests last year, delaying the first flight until
at least March 1993.
   Having its own rockets would free Japan from a 1969 agreement
under which the United States can veto launching of satellites for
third countries.
   Support for more independence may grow following discord over
joint development plans with the United States for the FSX fighter
plane, discovery of design problems in a U.S.-led international
space station project, and the explosion Feb. 22 of a European
Ariane rocket carrying two Japanese communications satellites worth
about $600 million.
   Both satellites on the Ariane were made in the United States.
American trade officials have threatened penalty tariffs on
Japanese products unless Japan agrees to buy more U.S. satellites
instead of supporting development of the domestic satellite
industry.
   ``It's hard to believe this great nation, which produces so many
goods so well, has to protect an infant industry'' like satellites,
Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said on a recent visit to Japan.
   Some analysts question whether Japan will become competitive in
commercial launches.
   Its two small space centers, at Uchinoura and nearby
Tanegashima, are far from the equator. That increases launching
costs for geostationary satellites, which must be placed in orbits
over the equator.
   ``Already there are well-established commercially viable launch
programs in the United States, Europe, the Soviet Union and
China,'' said Stephen Marvin, an analyst for Jardine Fleming
Securities. ``Japan won't have the economies of scale to make it
cost-effective.''
   Whatever the analysts say, Japanese space space plans are
ambitious.
   Over the next 10 years, the government program calls for
creating a small space shuttle, probes of the moon and Venus to
prepare for manned missions and building a $2 billion module for
the space station.
   Most experiments in the module will involve processing materials
in space, as will many of the 34 experiments to be conducted by a
Japanese astronaut next year on the U.S. space shuttle Atlantis.
   A group of 20 companies led by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries plans
to build a moon base by 2010 where humans can live for a few weeks.
   By 2030, the group hopes to station more than 100 people there
on a long-term basis to begin extracting helium-3 as a source of
power for nuclear fusion reactors, which it said would mean ``no
energy shortage on Earth ever.''
   Shimizu Corp. plans a doughnut-shaped space hotel with 64 rooms
that would orbit Earth at an altitude of about 280 miles. It would
rotate three times a minute to create artificial gravity in the
guest rooms, and weightless ``space games'' could be played in the
center of the ring.
   Japan is alloting $1.02 billion for space this year, less than
one-tenth the $12.3 billion budgeted for the U.S. National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   Analysts in the Tokyo office of Baring Securities said spending
probably would grow by 17 percent to 20 percent a year to an annual
$6.9 billion by the end of the decade.

   You can feel it in Lee Iacocca's vow to peel off
their Teflon kimonos.
   It's there in the hearty applause for Johnny Carson's monologues
about their voracious appetite for American real estate and Jay
Leno'scracks about their proposed takeover of 7-Eleven. Those are
only among the most visible signs.
   There's nothing new about Japan-bashing, which has been around
since well before Pearl Harbor. But racially charged hostility
toward the once-subdued Japanese and their postwar economic might
seems less subtle and more fear-laden now. Some would argue it's
becoming bold and belligerent.
   Ironically, the anti-Japanese jibes have been accompanied and
even overshadowed by a growing sophistication and respect for Japan
in many parts of the country.
   American companies often strive to copy Japanese models for
success. Japanese companies are building factories and opening
offices in the United States, contributing to charities and
striving to be responsible corporate citizens. Japanese language
study has grown enormously popular.
   From cinema to sports to sushi bars, Japanese culture is
integrating into the American mainstream and embellishing its
diversity. One of Japan's star athletes, ice skater Midori Ito, is
a darling of the American sports press. On Monday night, an
honorary Oscar was awarded to Japan's Akira Kurosawa, considered
one of the greatest living film directors.
   At the same time, however, the tone and nature of Japan-bashing
has changed, tapping into some deeply ingrained prejudices held by
an older generation of Americans who never really thought of the
Japanese as friends.
   This change is not an isolated event. It comes against a
background of seemingly intractable disputes between the United
States and Japan over a number of crucial economic issues that have
redefined our postwar relationship.
   The United States long has wanted Japan to open its market to
foreign goods and help alleviate a growing trade deficit Washington
claims is undermining the productivity and competitiveness of
domestic industries.
   But Japan is becoming less patient with this argument. It wants
Americans to stop spending beyond their means and clean up social
malignancies that range from illiteracy to drug abuse. This
response seems only to have further inflamed the ire of the
Japan-bashers.
   True, you don't often hear the wartime epithet ``Jap,'' at least
in public. But you do read and hear cultural slights against the
Japanese, which if applied to some other ethnic group would be
construed as racial slurs.
   Perhaps the most obvious example is an advertising campaign by
Iacocca, the Chrysler Corp. boss who is seeking to stimulate the
car company's sales with a tribal us-vs.-them pitch that paints the
Japanese as devious, crafty copycats.
   ``A lot of Americans think if it's made in Japan, it's terrific,
if it's made in America, it's lousy,'' he rails on television and
print ads. ``It's time to peel off the Teflon kimono.''
   Iacocca _ whose company, by the way, imports and sells many
Japanese cars under its own nameplates _ has denied that his
remarks are anti-Japanese, much less racially inspired. On the
contrary, Iacocca claims he's one of Japan's greatest fans.
   But the timing of his publicity drive and the almost bellicose
nature of his language suggests he's pandering to prejudices about
Japan as though they were a threat to apple pie America.
   Other prominent Americans, from congressmen to governors to
talk-show hosts, have engaged in the same sort of rhetoric, spicing
it up with gratuitous and uncomplimentary references to the
Japanese way of life. Even the press has chimed in.
   When a Japanese company agreed earlier this month to acquire
debt-laden Southland Corp.'s 7-Eleven stores, for example, some
news reports focused more on who the buyer was than why the seller
was desperate for a financial rescue and sought a Japanese savior.
One newspaper account began with the line, ``Sushi Slurpees,
anyone?''

   Last winter, Ryuichi Sakamoto turned on the TV
in his Los Angeles hotel room and heard some familiar music.
   Fascinating, he thought _ the orchestration, the
instrumentation, how the French horns used high octave violin
phrases.
   It was the theme from ``Bonanza.''
   ``I'm always looking for something which can inspire me,'' said
Sakamoto, who composed the Academy Award-winning soundtrack to the
``The Last Emperor'' and has released a new album, ``Beauty.''
   ``When I listen to any music, I automatically see musical notes
and instruments. In films, just one tone, a sound could mean a
lot,'' he said.
   ``Bonanza'' inspired Sakamoto to purchase a compilation of
themes from westerns, which played softly in the background during
a recent interview at a Manhattan hotel. He came to New York well
prepared for any unexpected musical adventure. On the dresser by
his bed sat a compact disc player, a digital audio tape machine and
tapes of everything from reggae to jazz.
   Nicknamed ``Professor'' in college, Sakamoto is like a sonic
Henry Higgins, able to tell the difference between Hong Kong and
Moscow by the pitch of car horns. Born in Tokyo in 1952, he was
just 10 when he began studying music composition at the University
of Art of Tokyo.
   But Sakamoto is a proudly self-trained listener, recalling his
daily commutes to high school.
   ``I paid attention to every noise on the train and counted every
different noise. Spins, boxes crashing, people talking, cable
wires,'' said Sakamto, who identified each sound with an uncanny
imitation.
   ``Echoes of cities are different. The first time I went to
London, I was kind of surprised. I flew from Tokyo to London and
the echoes the cities had were very different,'' said the composer,
whose debut album, ``Thousand Knives,'' was released in 1978.
   ``In London, the buildings were made out of stones. The steps
sounded very different to me, very hypnotic.''
   Sakamoto admits, however, that keeping his ears pinned to
grindstone left him tone-deaf to people. Soft-spoken and shy, he
simply preferred listening to talking, sounds over words. The
turning point, he said, came in 1987 when he worked with director
Bernardo Bertolucci on ``The Last Emperor.''
   ``It was quite tricky, because my music's kind of depressed and
flat on the surface. Bertolucci forced me to write more and more
emotional music. He kept saying, `More emotional.' It was very
difficult,'' Sakamoto said.
   ``Before `The Last Emperor,' I was kind of afraid to let people
into my music. I could hardly communicate with people. But after
the experience of `The Last Emperor,' I easily could communicate
with people. I was surprised.
   So Sakamoto calls ``Beauty'' his most idealistic record, a
former loner's attempt to embrace the world to the beat of world
music, the composer's own mixture of dance rhythms and Japanese
folk.
   ``Each day, I would say, `I need an African percussion player. I
need an African guitarist. I need a Korean guitar player. I need a
Chinese musician.' I had so many different nusicians from all over
the world, and communication was so important for recording with
them. Maybe three years ago I couldn't do that.''
   Sakamoto has also worked with rock 'n' rollers. He appeared in
the 1983 film, ``Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence,'' which starred
David Bowie, and two years later collaborated with Thomas Dolby on
the album ``Field Work.''
   On ``Beauty,'' he applies his personal touch to the Rolling
Stones' ``We Love You.'' The original was released in 1967, right
after Mick Jagger and Keith Richards had been jailed briefly on
drug charges. With John Lennon and Paul McCartney singing backup,
the song was a cynical take on the Summer of Love, complete with
the sound of cell doors slamming.
   But ``We Love You'' was no joke to Sakamoto, who in 1967 was
politically active and listening to the experimental music of John
Cage. The composer got rid of the studio effects and turned the
song into a friendly handshake _ offered, of course, via
state-of-the-art technology.
   ``I wanted to have a song which was for people who I have never
met,'' he said. ``I wanted to introduce myself to people who were
not just music fans, but all young people. Like ordinary people in
the United States, people in Romania. I want them to listen to my
music.''

   A lyric sheet is not included with Galaxie 500's
album, ``On Fire.'' Bandleader Dean Wareham wants it that way.
   ``I don't like writing down lyrics that much,'' said the
guitarist-singer-songwriter, a native of New Zealand. ``On paper, I
think, lyrics are something completely different. All they are are
words that go along with the music.''
   So listen carefully if you want to sing along, though Wareham
doesn't think it's worth the trouble. He's not telling stories or
sending messages. Words about weather, cars and the environment are
only words, he says, nothing, literally, worth writing about.
   ``It's not like folk music, it just helps us set the mood. `Blue
Thunder' is about my car, not about the weather. `Snowstorm' is
about the weather but just as much about TV. People say I'm into
nature because of `Decomposing Trees' and `Leave the Planet,' and
that's not true: too many bugs.''
   The real story can be heard from Wareham's own brand of white
noise: a guitar that churns out chords as easy as A-B-C and a
wobbly tenor that breaks occasionally into an even wobblier
falsetto. ``Start simple and build'' is the motto. These songs,
quiet but never peaceful, usually open with Wareham strumming
guitar and gradually intensify, threatening to explode at any time.
   ``I think we do have a distinctive sound. That's a criticism:
Everything sounds the same. It just means you have a sound you can
call your own. You can hear the influences.
   ``We had some German kids coming to us in Frankfurt and they
said, `How did you get this sound?' And then after we played they
said, `We couldn't believe how easy it was.' It was distortion and
sustained compression.''
   The members of Galaxie 500 met in high school in New York, but
only started playing together 2{ years ago. Bassist Naomi Yang and
drummer Damon Krukowski were in Boston and Wareham was still in New
York when he quit his old band.
   ``I quit after the first time on stage when I saw what they were
like. He was a cross between Freddie Mercury and David Lee Roth. He
was dancing all over the stage and the stuff he was doing was
really corny and annoying. I had loaned somebody in the band $300
and when he paid me back, I quit.''
   He needed that money. Few people, including Galaxie 500, own a
copy of the group's first album. Aurora Records released it, but
Aurora Records consisted of one man operating from his home in
Boston.
   ``He did our single and he did our LP and he did another single,
Wareham said. ``What's frustrating for us at this point is when the
first album gets reviewed in the Village Voice and you couldn't get
it in New York.''
   Though their first record was called ``Today,'' the band proudly
takes its name and music from the past. Galaxie 500 is a 1960s car
that a friend of Wareham's owned, and the sound is vintage 1967:
part psychedelic Beatles, part Velvet Underground.
   ``On Fire'' was distributed by Rough Trade records and features
nine originals plus a cover of ``Isn't It a Pity'' off George
Harrison's ``All Things Must Pass'' album. Harrison and Bob Dylan
wrote it, and Eric Clapton played lead guitar, but Wareham was
unimpressed, applying the faithful ``start simple and build''
treatment.
   ``My roommate had the record,'' Wareham said. ``I'm not really a
fan of Eric Clapton, who's all over that record. It was a longshot
in the studio. We said, `Let's just give this a try.'''
   Galaxie 500 is still a cult band, even for Galaxie 500. Wareham
puts in time as a temp around Manhattan, Yang has been studying
architecture and Krukowski teaches. For now, Wareham says, their
only goal is to sell enough records to make music a full-time job.
   ``Yeah, we'd like to do that, but I don't think any of us see
doing it in 10 years. We just sort of stumbled into it. We just
played for fun and all of a sudden sounded a little better than it
did before.
   ``I think our audience really has just got a sense of us. Things
have changed a lot. It used to that 50 people came to see us in
Boston and now we're selling out shows. It's no longer just critics
and hipsters.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not hearing enough about the federal
government? Roger Kranz hopes so and he's prepared to fill the gap
with gossip, news and opinion pieces about the capital's major
industry.
   Kranz is launching the Washington Reporter, a new daily
newspaper, to remedy what he sees as a dearth of details about
government and politics. It will be distributed free to 30,000
lawyers, lobbyists, journalists, consultants, members of Congress
and senior government officials.
   ``They must read many, many publications to really find out
what's going on in Washington,'' said Kranz, who quit his job as
group vice president of the National Journal to publish the new
paper.
   He plans to deliver the inside skinny, starting Oct. 1, in one
16-page package easily digested after his readers finish with The
Washington Post, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal or
whatever else they read.
   Kranz said the Washington Reporter will have more details than
those papers on what happens day-to-day inside the Beltway, and
will be more timely than weekly magazines that might carry similar
stories or think pieces.
   ``I won't have to wait a week to tell you what you already
know,'' he said. ``It's a cliche to say information is power, but
in Washington, D.C., having information before anybody else makes
you powerful.''
   Are the town's movers and shakers ready to add yet another
publication to their daily diet?
   ``It's too much,'' says Jim Glassman, editor of Roll Call, a
twice-weekly newspaper about Congress. ``People are overwhelmed
with paper. And this, if it ever gets published, is going to
overwhelm them even more. ... We brought up the idea (of going
daily) with our readers, and were told, `God, no, I've got enough
stuff on my desk.'''
   On the other hand, there can never be enough news for some
people.
   ``I feel like I'm getting too much, but at the same time I don't
mind getting more,'' says Michael Kinsley, a syndicated columnist
and senior editor of The New Republic.
   There is some skepticism not only about the need for the paper
but also about whether Kranz can raise the $12.45 million he says
he needs for the paper's first year. ``I am continuing to negotiate
for full financing. I am on schedule to be publishing in October,''
Kranz said. He refused to name investors or say how much money is
committed so far.
   A prototype of the new paper shows a good grasp of what appeals
to status-conscious Washingtonians, including a politics page,
several gossip columns and a Page 2 ``People'' index of everyone
mentioned in the entire paper.
   ``I guarantee you it will be the best-read section of the
newspaper. ... It's a very egotistical town,'' Kranz said of the
index. In the prototype it includes such inside-the-Beltway
luminaries as GOP consultant Roger Ailes and hairdresser Robin Weir
as well as the usual lawmakers, media types and public officials.
   The front page of the prototype features articles about the
Federal Election Commission, the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, a sensitive high-tech telephone deal with the Soviet
Union, the House since Jim Wright's departure, a sex survey and
President Bush's capital gains tax cut proposal.
   The back pages contain people, media and gossip columns, stories
about the television networks, a profile of a Senate staff aide, an
excerpt from former CBS reporter Fred Graham's book and an article
on where the powerful like to lunch. Five writers offer their views
on the peace dividend in a two-page commentary section.
   Don Graham, publisher of the Post, said the success of
newsletters covering narrow slices of federal activity bodes
reasonably well for the Washington Reporter.
   ``There are many, many daily newspapers covering aspects of the
work of the federal government, but if you look at evidence of the
last few years, there seems to be room for more,'' Graham said.
``There are continually many new publications starting up, some of
which are quite successful.''
   One example of that trend is Roll Call. According to Glassman,
the chatty, tabloid-size paper was an eight-page weekly with a
circulation of 4,000 when he and a partner bought it four years
ago. Now, he said, it comes out twice a week with 30 pages in each
issue and has a circulation of more than 17,000.
   ``We certainly have shown that advertisers are interested in
reaching the public policy market and there certainly are readers
there,'' he said. But he added a word of advice to Kranz: ``It's
got to be real, real good.''

<TEXT>
   We tend to think of the lowly home video camera
as a goof-dispenser for ``America's Funniest Home Videos.'' But it
increasingly is used to record serious things, too, such as history.
   That's graphically illustrated tonight in Ted Koppel's ABC News
special, ``Death of a Dictator,'' about the bloody December revolt
in Romania that led to the Christmas Day executions of dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena.
   While ambiguous in spots, it's first-rate in the way it
chronicles the revolution by weaving together often-chilling
footage shot by Western TV crews and by unidentified Romanians
armed only with home video cameras.
   The latter footage is grainy, often shot at odd angles. But it's
riveting stuff, even an early, almost farcical headquarters scene
in which the Romanian army's chief of staff is frustrated by
language problems when the battle still is in doubt.
   The same footage shows the head of the hated Securitate secret
police, who, incredibly, is allowed to join the new
regime-in-progress (its officials belatedly suspect him of helping
their foes and arrest him).
   The headquarters farce constrasts sharply with shots of deadly
combat at the Bucharest airport between army troops and the secret
police, where there are visible sparks as bullets strike concrete
and metal.
   Some interviews are remarkable, particuarly one with an army
major, Mihai Lupoi, an eyewitness to the execution of the
Ceausescus shortly after a quick military trial that was only a
formality.
   The couple, captured on Dec. 22 while trying to flee their
country, were found guilty of genocide and other grave crimes.
   ``We took them out, took them to the wall, and asked to the
people, `Who wants to shoot?''' says Lupoi, who occasionally gives
a short, eerie chuckle as he speaks in English. ``Everybody wanted
(to shoot).
   ``So they selected three people. And they didn't wait for the
command to shoot ... three guns, 90 bullets. I don't know if all of
them were in the body. ... Nobody counted.''
   Koppel reports that while still alive, Ceausescu wore a tiny
radio transmitter he hoped would aid his escape after capture. But
the show leaves unanswered some questions about his attempted
getaway.
   One is why the helicopter pilot who flew the Ceausescus from
Bucharest helped in their capture by setting down in a field not
far from the city. Details of the capture also were missing from a
review copy of the program, although an ABC spokeswoman said that
will be added tonight.
   Despite its title, ``Death of a Dictator'' actually is a
two-part report. The first is a step-by-step account of the
Romanian revolt that was sparked by reports of a December massacre
in the border town of Timisoara.
   The second examines those reports and how many people actually
died in Romania duuring the revolt, the dictator's long stay in
power and Washington's apparent willingness to ignore his tyranny,
and whether the revolution really has changed anything in Romania,
whether one dictatorship eventually will be replaced with another.
   The show's broad scope seems too much for an hour, despite the
skill of Koppel and his staff. It would have been better to make
the report a 90-minute special or even two separate programs.
   But it's worth watching, if only for its examples of television
as a force in modern history _ including the dramatic moment
Ceausescu starts to speak to what he thinks is the usual tame
crowd. You won't forget the startled look on his stern face when
he's greeted with unexpected jeers and whistling.
   Although perhaps forgetting TV's coverage of last year's bloody,
unsuccessful uprising in Beijing, Romanian TV anchorman Nicolae
Melinescu is right in speaking of television's impact on his
country last December.
   Interviewed in English for ABC's special, his grammar is tangled
but his meaning is clear when he says: ``I think it was the first
time when one can watch on TV a revolution _ live.''

<DATELINE>TAPPI STATION, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tappi station's waiting room is
huge, but no one starts a trip there. It provides a way out if
something goes wrong under the Tsugaru Straits, in the world's
longest tunnel.
   Five trains stop at Tappi each day and let hundreds of people
off for a look, by guided tour, at conditions 450 feet beneath the
surface. The passengers then board the next train to finish the
journey between Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main island, and the
central island of Honshu.
   The purpose of Tappi and Yoshioka, a similar station near the
other end of the Seikan Tunnel, is to provide shelter or an exit in
case of earthquakes or other trouble.
   At 50 mph, a train takes 40 minutes to complete the trip through
the tunnel, an $8.5 billion tube 34 miles long that runs under the
Tsugaru Straits for nearly 15 miles.
   ``Down that way, you can walk to the other side,'' a guide said,
pointing down a side tunnel. ``It would take about six hours.''
   Before the Seikan opened in March 1988, rail passengers
tranferred to a ferry for a four-hour voyage across the straits
between Aomori, on Honshu, and Hakodate, on Hokkaido.
   Sometimes the service was halted by storms. A typhoon sank a
ferry in 1954, killing more than 1,100 people, and support for a
tunnel grew.
   Guides from Japan Railways show visitors to Tappi and Yoshioka
some of the ways of coping with emergencies.
   Each station is under land. The tunnel does not emerge from the
ground for 8{ miles beyond Tappi, and 10{ past Yoshioka, but
stranded passengers can take a cable car or stairway to the
surface. It is 1,316 steps to the top from Tappi, about a 20-minute
climb.
   Both stations are in the service tunnels, which are big enough
for a truck to drive through and run along both sides of the
36-foot-wide main railway tube.
   Air pressure in the service tunnels is higher than in the main
tunnel so smoke from a fire cannot enter them. The main tunnel has
sprinkler and drainage systems.
   Tappi and Yoshioka have rest rooms, first aid stations and
benches for hundreds of people.
   Sensors and television cameras monitor conditions inside the
tunnel. A television monitor in Tappi, using remote-controlled
cameras, gives a sweeping view of conditions on the surface similar
to that of a submarine periscope.
   When there is no emergency, passengers can stop at Tappi to walk
in the service tunnels, buy soft drinks from a machine or purchase
a small souvenir tunnel ``passport'' whose price of 1,000 yen
($6.70) includes a card good for that value in travel on Japan
Railways.
   At its center, the tunnel is 785 feet below the water's surface
and 330 feet under the seabed. To keep water from seeping in under
high pressure, the earth around the tunnel has been reinforced for
a distance of up to 65 feet.
   Excavation began in 1971, with the cost estimated at about
one-third the final total.
   The tunnel required 13.8 million man-days of work and took the
lives of 34 workers. Four serious cases of flooding delayed
construction.
   Techniques developed in the project are expected to help in
construction of the 31-mile tunnel under the English Channel that
will link England and France.
   Seikan completes the ground linkage of Japan's four main
islands. The 2.3-mile Kanmon Tunnel betwen Honshu and the southern
island of Kyushu was completed in 1942, and in April 1988 the
7.7-mile Seto Ohashi Bridge opened between Honshu and Shikoku, east
of Kyushu.

<DATELINE>WROCLAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eight entreprenuers with a handmade
transmitter, satellite dish and broom-closet studio have broken the
government monopoly on television broadcasts in what used to be the
Soviet bloc.
   Marek Mlynarczyk smiled and said: ``You might say we've made a
little mess.'' He is general manager of ECHO-TV, the first private
commercial television station in Eastern Europe.
   ECHO has broadcast six hours a night since Feb. 6, mostly music
videos and movies pirated, more or less, from satellite
transmissions.
   ``Nobody believed we would do it,'' said Mlynarczyk, who thinks
that's the only reason he and his seven co-owners got permission
from the authorities.
   ``They decided, `Oh, if you want permission, just take it. We
don't believe you will do something with it','' he said. ``The
result is that, now, no other permissions are being given.''
   In decades of Communist control, Poland's two government-run
television channels offered a dull diet of propaganda presented as
news, cheap-to-make interview programs, and cheap-to-buy American
reruns and Brazilian soap operas. Occasionally, a Polish film
spiced up the schedule.
   Poles are hooked on the tube nonetheless, and Mlynarczyk said
the response to ECHO-TV was ``something of a shock at first.''
   There is no ratings system in Poland, but estimates put the
number of viewers at 200,000 for the station, which can be picked
up within about 18 miles of Wroclaw, an industrial city 200 miles
southwest of Warsaw.
   Some viewers need a special antenna. Demand was so great that
stores sold out and the ECHO-TV office was mobbed when an
advertising misprint implied the antennas were being sold there.
   Most people can receive ECHO without special equipment or set
adjustments.
   The station goes on the air at 6 p.m. from two tiny rooms atop a
student dormitory where, says one of the 16 staff technicians, ``we
could use a window.''
   Virtually all the equipment fits on a table in one corner: three
televisions, two video cassette recorders, a personal computer and
a special effects mixer.
   Another corner three steps away serves as the set for the
five-minute news program. The foot-square logo backdrop is cut from
paper.
   Andrzej Zygmunt, the technical manager, cobbled together a
transmitter slightly bigger than a bread box. A cable strung
through an air vent takes the signal to the roof.
   The eight shareholders invested the equivalent of about $50,000
in what they call ``semi-professional'' equipment to start the
station and an affiliated video company.
   So far, they have more orders for one-minute, computer-generated
advertising messages than they can accommodate. The rate is $5 per
commercial.
   ``We're not dreaming of big money,'' Mlynarczyk said. ``We just
want to show we can maintain this.
   ``This is the beginning. We are making something new.''
   There are many plans afoot for original programming, but for now
most of the programs come from MTV, the U.S. music video channel,
and other stations carried by satellite.
   Mlynarczyk said he had a ``verbal agreement'' with the satellite
distributor, but was uncomfortable with the informal arrangement.
   ``We're the first,'' he said. ``We have to be careful or someone
could come here and close us down.''
   He said ECHO's owners want to offer television that is ``more
fun.'' Mlynarczyk described Polish television as ``too serious .. .
a lot of guys sitting in arm chairs telling something, blah, blah,
blah.''
   Marek Hamera, the program coordinator, said: ``It should be
closer to life ... everything state-owned TV doesn't do.''
   After the Solidarity-led government assumed power last fall,
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki was under intense public pressure
to reform state television, which one member of Parliament called
``the medium that lied the most.''
   The evening news program was changed and some announcers most
closely identified with the former Communist regime were replaced.
There was criticism when the new director of the state broadcasting
committee heeded Mazowiecki's recommendation against a wholesale
purge.
   One-third of the directors have been replaced and a law on
control of the airwaves is being drafted.
   ECHO-TV's owners said they applied for the station two weeks
after the new head of the state committee was appointed.
   ``When we got the permission, we worked nonstop to put the
station on the air because we were afraid someone would take it
away,'' Zygmunt said. A permit for a second station in Lublin,
southeast of Warsaw, is on hold.
   Efforts to break the government monopoly on non-satellite
television also are under way elsewhere in Eastern Europe,
especially in Hungary.
   MTI, the Hungarian news agency, reported that 80 applications
for private broadcast stations had been filed, but the Hungarian
government has said there should be only three televison channels.
The state already controls two.

   Here are some statistics on the Adirondack Park:
   _At about 6 million acres, the Adirondack Park is the largest
public park in the lower 48 states. It is 2{ times the size of
Yellowstone National Park. About 2.3 million acres are a forest
preserve protected under the state constitution as ``forever
wild.'' About 2 million acres are logged. New York state owns about
37 percent of the park.
   _Lake Placid, in the heart of the park, was the site of the
Winter Olympics in 1932 and 1980.
   _The park is home to 130,000 year-round residents. There are
110,000 seasonal residents.
   _Nine million people visit the park each year.
   _The park has 2,000 miles of hiking trails and more than 100
peaks at least 3,000 feet high. It encompasses more than 6,000
miles of streams and 2,853 lakes and ponds; more than 260 of its
lakes are considered ``dead'' because of acid rain.
   _Two-hundred-eighteen species of birds have been observed in the
park, along with 55 kinds of mammals, 35 kinds of reptiles and 86
varieties of fish.
   _The lynx, peregrine falcon and bald eagle have been
reintroduced to the Adirondack Park, and officials may attempt to
bring back the moose. The park is the only area in the eastern
United States being considered for reintroduction of the wolf and
cougar.

<HEAD>Judge Approves Eastern's Sale of Latin American Routes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unsecured creditors of Eastern Airlines,
exasperated at the carrier's mounting losses and its new plan to
reduce debt payments, are considering seeking the liquidation of
the airline, sources said.
   A source close to the creditors' committee said Thursday there
is a ``50-50 chance'' the group will request the bankruptcy court
to appoint a special trustee to oversee a liquidation of Eastern.
   Such a move would be a radical shift by the creditors. They have
been supportive of Eastern since it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization on March 9, 1989, five days after it was struck by
Machinists, pilots and flight attendants.
   The naming of a trustee, who would take control of the airline
from Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
has long been advocated by the airline's unions but rejected by
both the company and its creditors.
   A move for liquidation also could imperil Eastern's agreement to
sell its prized Latin American routes to American Airlines for $349
million. Proceeds from that sale are central to Eastern's plan to
rebuild.
   On Tuesday, Miami-based Eastern sharply scaled back its business
prospects, forecasting a bigger loss for this year and a delay in
this summer's planned emergence from bankruptcy reorganization.
   Eastern said difficulties in rebuilding its strike-battered
business also meant it would be unable to fulfill a tentative
agreement to pay unsecured creditors 50 cents on the dollar. Under
that accord the unsecured creditors, who are owed $980 million,
would receive about $490 million in cash and notes.
   The creditors' committee privately passed a resolution late
Tuesday authorizing its attorneys to seek the appointment of a
trustee and to propose a plan of liquidation, said sources close to
the committee, who requested anonymity.
   The creditors' attorneys would take such action if Texas Air
refused to cover Eastern's future operating losses, according to
the resolution.
   Currently, the losses are funded out of escrow accounts held for
the creditors, which contain the proceeds of sales of Eastern
assets.
   ``In the event (Texas Air) refuses to fund such losses ... the
committee hereby authorizes counsel to prepare and file either a
motion seeking the appointment of a trustee to consummate the sale
to American Airlines and then to effectuate an orderly liquidation
of Eastern Airlines, or a liquidating plan and a contemporaneous
motion for the appointment of a trustee,'' the resolution read.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland on Thursday approved
Eastern's proposed sale of the Latin American routes and related
assets.
   That sale forms the core of a $471 million deal that also
includes a $102.5 million settlement of litigation between American
and Continental Airlines, Eastern's sister Texas Air subsidiary.
   The proposed transaction still must be approved by the
Transportation Department. A department attorney said at the
hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court that a decision on the sale
probably would be made by April 6.
   If approved, the transfer would cap a string of more than $800
million in assets sold by Eastern.
   The sale also would greatly extend the international reach of
American, the nation's largest airline.
   Completion of the sale is a necessary condition for final
approval of a reorganization agreement between Eastern and the
unsecured creditors, which include aircraft and engine
manufacturers such as Boeing Co., Airbus Industrie and General
Electric Co.
   One source close to the situation said Robert Ferguson, a vice
president of Texas Air, suggested to creditors during a conference
call Thursday that they ``pretend'' to negotiate a reorganization
of Eastern until the Transportation Department approves the sale.
   Houston-based Texas Air was concerned that if the department
thought Eastern was being liquidated, it would bar the sale, this
source said.
   The airline's suggestion ``is designed to pull the wool over the
eyes of the Department of Transportation,'' the source said.
``That's at the very least unethical, if not unlawful.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami declined any comment on
the issue.
   ``Eastern and Texas Air will discuss with the responsible
parties the manner in which to structure a final agreement,'' he
said.
   Lawyers for the Air Line Pilots Association and the Machinists
union opposed the Latin American sale at the hearing, as they have
done with Eastern's previous asset transfers.
   Adam Harris, an attorney representing Eastern's unsecured
creditors, said they didn't object to the transaction. The
committee did not express in court its displeasure with Eastern's
latest reorganization proposals.
   Early this month, the Justice Department said it did not object
to the sale of the Latin American routes.
   Eastern bought the Latin American routes from Braniff Inc. in
1982 for around $30 million.

stock to the company that publishes its tabloid rival.
   The news came as a surprise to Star staffers.
   ``We're in shock,'' said Barry Levine, the Star's Hollywood
bureau chief. ``Up until this moment, we and the Enquirer have been
bitter enemies.''
   But the would-be buyer, G.P. Group Inc. of Lantana, Fla., said
it plans to ``maintain the Star's editorial independence'' and
would continue to publish it from the magazine's current location
in Tarrytown, N.Y.
   ``They will still compete with each other,'' said Iain Calder,
editor and president of the Enquirer, from his office in Florida.
   The agreement comes nearly a year after G.P. Group itself was
acquired by a partnership led by principals of the romance magazine
publisher Macfadden Holdings Inc. and the media investment firm
Boston Ventures for $412.5 million. Macfadden's titles include True
Story, True Confessions and Modern Romance,
   The purchase would solidify G.P. Group's franchise in the
grocery checkout lines. It also publishes the sensationalist Weekly
World News.
   The Star has an average weekly circulation of 3.6 million,
according to News Corp. The National Enquirer's average weekly
circulation is 4.1 million and Weekly World News is at 950,000,
according to G.P. Group.
   Under terms of the proposed sale, News Corp. would receive about
$200 million in cash and the balance in preferred stock in G.P.
Group.
   The sale is expected to be completed before June 30, the
companies said in a news release. It is subject to government
waivers or approvals and other conditions.
   News Corp. was expected to use proceeds from the sale to reduce
debt incurred in several recent acquisitions, including the $3
billion purchase of the publisher of TV Guide in 1988 and the $407
million purchase of book publisher Scott Foresman and Co. last fall.
   Star was among the first major successes for Murdoch in the
United States.
   ``We created Star magazine 16 years ago and developed it into
one of America's most popular periodicals,'' said Martin Singerman,
president of News America Publishing Inc., the News Corp.
subsidiary that publishes the magazine.
   Michael Boylan, vice chairman and chief operating officer, said
G.P. Group was interested because the Star ``is a great
publication'' and newsstand distribution is ``a business we
understand.''
   Since taking over the Enquirer and the Weekly World News, G.P.
Group's new owners reportedly have more than tripled the company's
annual cash flow to about $60 million, partly by trimming a
400-person staff by about 10 percent and partly by making paper and
printing operations more efficient.
   Some of the biggest names in the publishing business were
believed to have been bidders for G.P. Group when it was up for
sale last year, including Britain's Maxwell Communications Corp.,
France's Hachette SA and the West German publisher Heinrich Bauer.
   It could not be determined if there were any other bidders for
the Star. News Corp. officials were said to be unavailable for
comment.
   Australian-based News Corp. is a diversified international media
company with interests in newspapers, magazines, book publishing,
motion picture and television production and commercial printing.
   In addition to its debt from acquisitions, the company has been
preparing to expand its weekly lineup of shows for its Fox
Television Network, which is mounting a challenge to the ABC, NBC
and CBS networks.

<HEAD>Publisher, Restaurant Group Launches Magazine with a Menu</HEAD>

   Theater goers get the cast names in a playbook.
Sports fans can look up the players' numbers in a program. And now
diners at more than 60 New York restaurants are getting their menu
in a magazine.
   The magazine is called Knife &amp; Fork, and it is being produced by
a joint venture involving a specialty publishing concern and a
company that owns restaurants.
   Instead of the usual menus, customers at selected restaurants
are getting the general interest magazine with its menu stapled
inside. They can read while they eat or take it home.
   It is being billed as just the ticket for advertisers trying to
reach young go-getters who often don't spend much time watching TV.
If it is successful in New York, its owners say they may expand it
nationally.
   But critics said the magazine could be an unwelcome conversation
stopper. And some advertising executives said they failed to detect
a clear sense of editorial mission, something they say is critical
to a magazine's success.
   Knife &amp; Fork is the latest in a growing trend which has seen the
creation of media vehicles aimed at helping advertisers reach
specific audiences more efficiently than through mass magazines or
broadcast outlets.
   Some recent examples include advertiser-supported magazines for
women at the beauty parlor or the doctor's office.
   Critics say people may grow weary of finding themselves targeted
for advertising in unexpected locations. They question whether
these media vehicles are reaching as many people as projected.
   Knife &amp; Fork is a creation of a 50-50 joint venture between the
publishing company Performance Network Inc. of Lindenhurst, N.Y.,
and The Riese Organization, a privately-held company that owns more
than 300 restaurants in the New York area and owns stakes in more
than 100 others nationwide.
   Performance Network previously has published boxing programs for
Madison Square Garden events and sells advertising in the sports
programs distributed at New York Mets baseball games, according to
Chairman Richard Neste.
   Neste and Murray Riese, a partner in The Riese Organization,
each declined to say how much they were investing in the new
magazine project.
   The March-April issue is being distributed at about 65 to 70
Riese-owned restaurants in Manhattan. The restaurants are known by
22 different brand names, including Houlihan's, Charlie O's, TGI
Friday's and Lindy's.
   Not counting the menu, the magazine was 32 pages and included a
feature on personal ads, a story on what your underwear says about
you and tips on how to buy a man's suit. Some articles were
reprints from other magazines.
   Advertisers were told more than 1 million copies of the magazine
will be distributed every two months based on customer counts at
the restaurants.
   Among the brands advertised in the first issue were Parliament
Lights cigarettes, Miller beer, V8 vegetable juice and Sony
televisions.
   Advertising executives compared the magazine to theater
playbills, which have a few pages devoted to the specific
production surrounded by stories on theater in general.
   Neste, who is publisher and editor in chief, said Knife &amp; Fork
is different because customers have to look at it to order.
   But will people go back to the magazine later?
   ``The key issue is how many of them will look at it,'' said
Joseph Ostrow, worldwide media director for Foote Cone &amp; Belding
Communications. He said he expects the magazine will provide
research to address that.

<HEAD>Lockheed Says It Won Proxy War; Simmons Takes Credit for Big
Concessions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dallas billionaire Harold Simmons may
have lost his proxy war for control of Lockheed Corp.'s board, but
he claimed all the credit for the company's sudden fondness for its
major shareholders.
   At Lockheed's annual meeting Thursday, Chairman Daniel Tellep
made major concessions to the pension funds and other large
investors who hold 60 percent of its stock. The biggest was an
offer to give shareholders up to three new seats on the board.
   Simmons, who controls 19 percent of the military contractor's
common stock, originally asked for six board seats. When denied,
the investor nominated his own full slate of candidates and urged
shareholders to vote for them.
   Official results of the vote for the board and for several
shareholder rights planks won't be know until next week at the
earliest, but Tellep claimed victory.
   ``I'm expecting a clear majority in every category of
shareholder, except of course, Mr. Simmons,'' Tellep said at a news
conference after the meeting.
   At a separate news conference, Simmons and Martin at first said
the contest was too close to call. But later they seemed to
acknowledge defeat.
   ``It's like a political campaign,'' Martin said. ``Sometimes you
just have to come back again the next time.''
   Tellep, who took the helm of Lockheed last year, said he courted
70 institutional investors during the past few weeks of the proxy
battle. He said he considered the wooing of shareholders a valuable
education and his ``baptism by fire'' in their desire to have a say
in the company's affairs.
   Replied Simmons: ``There's no question but it was our campaign
that caused him to get religion.''
   Added Simmons' chief lieutenant, J. Landis Martin: ``Mr. Simmons
was baptized a long time ago.''
   The battle, waged in newspaper advertisements as well as formal
mailings to shareholders, was expensive. Lockheed spent about $8
million and Simmons spent about $6 million.
   Asked about his efforts to portray himself as a builder of
companies rather than a corporate raider, Simmons said, ``We
weren't entirely successful, no.'' He complained that he had not
had enough time to wage his campaign because Tellep had moved up
the date of the meeting.
   Tellep acknowledged Thursday that he turned down a last-minute
compromise proposal in which Simmons promised to drop his campaign
to replace the board in return for three board seats.
   Simmons began his campaign as a battle for the entire board and
that is the way Lockheed fought it, Tellep said.
   He also said Simmons never personally presented a formal
settlement offer. Instead, the offer was forwarded Tuesday by
Thomas Flanigan, the chief investment officer of the California
teachers pension fund, which wound up supporting Simmons.
   The annual meeting was held in a vast hangar beside the Burbank
Airport, not far from where Lockheed built the stealth fighter in
the super-secret ``skunk works.''
   In addition to up to three new board seats, Tellep promised to
heed the results of a ``shareholder rights'' proposal urging the
company to opt out of strict anti-takeover provisions of the law in
Delaware, where Lockheed is incorporated.
   Tellep said even if the proposal got only a ``significant''
minority vote he would recommend that the board support an
amendment at the next meeting to have Lockheed opt out.
   He also offered to meet regularly with representatives of
Simmons' NL Industries Inc. to discuss the future of Lockheed.
   And he reiterated a promise made earlier, to recommend to the
board that shareholders be allowed to vote confidentially from now
on.
   Martin and Simmons objected to the way in which a small portion
of the shares belonging to an employees stock ownership plan had
been voted. They said the trustee of the plan, which holds 19
percent of Lockheed stock, had wrongly voted all the shares even
though some employees abstained from voting.
   Those shares were voted proportionally with the rest of the
plan's votes, which went by more than 90 percent to Lockheed's
board. Martin suggested that if his side lost by a narrow margin,
it might challenge the result on those grounds.
   Tellep said he would look into whether the employees could get
one of the new board seats, but stopped short of promising they
would.
   Simmons had urged Lockheed, with a recent history of sagging
earnings and cost overruns, to improve profits at its non-core
technology services and electronics businesses or sell them off.
   The company said Simmons had no experience in military
contracting and no business running Lockheed, which had 1989 sales
of $9.9 billion. Tellep also claimed the company was poised for a
rebound after a major restructuring last year and a decision to
take $500 million in writeoffs.
   Simmons has lost $100 million on his $530 million investment in
Lockheed because of a slumping share price. Lockheed stock fell 25
cents Thursday to $36.62{ on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEAD>Fed Doesn't Think Split Markets Regulation Causes Volatility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Reserve Board believes regulation
of stocks and stock index futures by two separate government
agencies has not worsened price swings in the stock markets,
Chairman Alan Greenspan says.
   Greenspan told a Senate panel Thursday that while some fine
tuning is in order, the Fed doesn't think creating one super
regulator is the answer to jurisdictional disputes.
   ``The board does not believe that the existing division of
regulatory authority has increased volatility in the securities
markets,'' he said.
   The head of the nation's top economic policy-making body was
among several key government officials to testify on the turf
battle between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   Greenspan told the securities subcommittee of the Senate
Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that he ``marginally''
favored giving jurisdiction over stock index futures to the SEC.
   But he quickly said he was speaking only for himself on that
point, and that several Fed governors disagreed with that position.
   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission oversees stock index
futures, which let investors bet on the rise and fall of a basket
of stocks without having to buy the underlying securities.
   But critics claim the wide disparity between margins _ the
downpayment investors must make to buy securities on credit _
required in futures markets and the securities markets leads to
sharp rises and drops in prices. And that volatility, they say, has
spooked small investors out of the stock market.
   The Federal Reserve sets margin requirements for stocks and
other securities but margins for futures contracts are set by the
exchange's themselves, usually at a fraction of the amount the Fed
requires.
   Greenspan said the Fed ``does not see a clear basis for choosing
between CFTC and SEC oversight of stock index futures margins.''
   He added, however, that the board ``feels strongly'' about
giving up the margin authority it has already and putting the SEC
and the exchanges in charge of setting margins for stocks and stock
options.
   Other witnesses included SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden, CFTC
Chairman Wendy L. Gramm and Treasury Undersecretary Robert R.
Glauber.
   While those three agencies have delivered opinions on who should
regulate so-called ``hybrid'' financial products that contain
aspects of both a security and a futures contract, Greenspan
previously had kept mum.
   Last year, a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled that
financial products with any properties of a futures contract belong
under CFTC oversight.
   The Fed, Treasury, SEC and CFTC make up the President's Working
Group on Financial Markets, a panel set up in the wake of the 1987
stock market crash. They have yet to reach an agreement on the
thorny matter of jurisdiction for hybrid instruments like stock
index futures.
   Breeden said he favored either merging control of securities and
futures under one agency or _ at the least _ giving the SEC control
over stock index futures as well as stocks. Glauber said Treasury
favors giving the SEC authority over stocks, stock options and
stock index futures.
   Gramm, however, opposes ``any shift in CFTC jurisdiction,''
claiming it hasn't been proven that such a change would benefit the
markets.
   The subcommittee, chaired by Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., is
looking specifically at the question of margins.
   ``This hearing is not to debate the issue of `turf,''' Dodd said
at the hearing's start. But the topic quickly strayed to the
long-simmering dispute between the SEC and the CFTC.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, said the jurisdictional debate was holding up
much-needed reform in the commodities futures markets.
   In testimony before Dodd's subcommittee he accused the SEC of
launching ``a hostile takeover'' of the CFTC's responsibilities.
   ``I am convinced that simply shifting jurisdiction for stock
index futures from the CFTC to the SEC will not strengthen
regulation, end volatility in the stock market or restore investor
confidence in Wall Street.''
   He called for passage of legislation to make the CFTC a tougher
regulator and then someday combine the CFTC and SEC.
   ``But realistically, the merger solution is far off,'' said
Leahy.

<HEAD>Bank Offers Socially Conscious Savings Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SARAH OKESON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chicago bank renowned for revitalizing its
impoverished neighborhood is hoping to find a market for a novel
instrument: certificates of deposit for socially conscious
investors.
   For investors willing to forsake big yields, the new CDs from
the South Shore Bank of Chicago promise to give a boost to the
city's South Shore neighborhood and provide aid for groups such as
Vietnamese refugees, bank officials said Thursday.
   ``I think it's going to appeal to that universe of social
investors who want to do something good with their money,'' said
Katherine Gross, director of the revolving loan fund of the
Industrial Cooperative Association of Somerville, Mass., the bank's
partner in the effort.
   A normal certificate of deposit might pay a 7 percent return.
But investors who buy a South Shore CD can choose to keep 1 percent
to 4 percent of the interest and give the rest to the ICA.
   A $100,000 CD yielding 7 percent annually would return $7,000 to
an investor. But if the South Shore investor chose to earn only 1
percent interest, or $1,000, the other $6,000 in interest would be
donated to the ICA.
   The non-profit group invests such funds in locally-owned
companies and community organizations around the country, Gross
said. Prospective clients include an Indian tribe in North Dakota
that wants to start a gas station and a group of Vietnamese
refugees who want to start a fishing cooperative, she said.
   The new CD serves a two-fold purpose. The interest goes to the
non-profit group while the principal is reinvested in the South
Shore neighborhood.
   ``For someone who would like to promote social objectives, this
is a terrific investment,'' said Jan Piercy, vice president of
Shore Bank Corp., the group's holding company. ``But anyone who is
interested in profit maximization is not going to be interested in
this.''
   The bank has earned a national reputation for its efforts to
revitalize the neighborhood.
   Like many other urban areas, South Shore suffered from the white
flight to the suburbs. The neighborhood went from nearly all-white
in the 1950s to 98 percent black by the early 1970s. Many banks and
businesses fled during that time.
   South Shore's previous owner even asked the Federal Reserve
Board for permission to move the bank to the Loop, Chicago's
downtown business district. But the community revolted, and the Fed
denied permission, Piercy said.
   The owner decided to sell, and a group of investors, including
several philanthropic foundations, formed the holding company to
buy the bank for $3.2 million in 1973.
   The new owners decided to use the bank's money to help the
community and targeted socially conscious investors nationwide to
increase its deposits.
   During the last 15 years, the bank has provided loans to
renovate more than 22 percent of the neighborhood's rental units.
   ``All of the funds which South Shore gets from its depositors
are targeted back into the community, not into investments in junk
bonds or oil,'' said Alan Walker, the bank's administrator for
development deposits.
   That approach has won praise from some, and the bank is the
subject of a book called ``Community Capitalism'' by a University
of Chicago professor.
   ``Because of the bank's efforts, property values have steadily
improved, and the neighborhood is a better place to live than it
was 10 or 15 years ago,'' said Dr. Richard Taub, a social science
professor and author of the book.

<HEAD>Kidder Selling Bridge Loans, Junk Bonds to Parent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kidder, Peabody Group Inc. is selling its
portfolio of risky junk bonds and bridge loans to its parent's
credit arm for about $750 million, making it the latest Wall Street
house to turn to its parent for capital.
   Analysts said the sale of the apparently illiquid investments to
GE Capital Corp. would increase Kidder's capital base and reduce
its exposure to the dormant high-yield bond market.
   ``It's going to make our balance sheet very much stronger and
very much more liquid that it was prior to the deal,'' Kidder chief
operating officer Dick O'Donnell said.
   The deal follows closely on the heels of efforts by American
Express Co. to bolster its ailing brokerage division. In recent
months, American Express has announced plans to take over Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. and inject about $1.35 billion in new capital.
   Kidder is a wholly owned subsidiary of General Electric Co.
   ``It looks like we're starting to see the beginning of a trend
here,'' said Lawrence Eckenfelder, an industry analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``It strengthens the balance sheet
of these companies.''
   Like other Wall Street firms, Kidder has been hurt by a downturn
in the individual investing, merger activity and securities
underwriting. The firm is shifting its retail operation to focus on
wealthy clients and small companies rather than all investors.
   Kidder also has cut its work force to 5,600 employees from a
peak of 7,500.
   Kidder's $750 million portfolio is being sold at current market
value, but officials refused to reveal the face value of the
investments.
   The New York Times reported that Kidder would post an operating
loss of less than $25 million for the first quarter to reflect the
reduced value of the portfolio under the transaction.
   About half the package is junk bonds and a third outstanding
bridge loans _ credits made by Kidder that were intended to be
temporary but for which the firm failed to raise permanent
financing. The remaining one-sixth is in equity investments in
companies made by Kidder's merchant banking department.
   Kidder refused to say when the junk bonds were issued and bridge
loans were made, or to what companies.
   It said three bridge loans had a total value of under $250
million. The bonds came from the firm's merchant banking division
and were not part of its daily trading portfolio.
   O'Donnell said the firm was not getting out of the high-yield
bond business and would continue to maintain a trading inventory.
   He also said Kidder still would provide merchant banking
services, in which an investment firm takes an equity stake in its
clients.
   Kidder officials sought to play down the comparison with
Shearson. Chairman and chief executive Michael A. Carpenter said in
a statement that GE Capital is ``better positioned to realize the
future value'' of the portfolio because it manages longer-term
loans.
   ``This is not a bailout whatsoever,'' O'Donnell said. ``They are
buying $750 million worth of investments for cash. This is an
inventory which will be part of a much larger portfolio they
manage.''
   He said the move will increase the net capital of Kidder's
broker-dealer unit by about $100 million _ the value of its
illiquid junk bond holdings. That will push the regulated entity's
capital to about $250 million above New York Stock Exchange
requirements, he said.
   Kidder lost $23 million last year, compared with a $46 million
profit in 1988.
   GE, the electrical products, broadcasting and financial services
company based in Fairchild, Conn., paid $600 million to acquire an
80 percent stake in Kidder in 1986.

<HEAD>Stocks Plunge More Than 3 Percent as Dollar Rebounds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renewed weakness in the yen sent stock prices
diving again Friday, with the Nikkei index suffering its
seventh-worst daily loss and plunging below the 30,000-point mark.
   A decline in stock index futures and heavy index-linked
programmed selling accelerated the market's fall, dealers said.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which shed
237.41 points Thursday, lost 1,045.71 points, or 3.37 percent, to
end the week at 29,981.45. It was the seventh-worst daily loss both
in point and percentage terms.
   The dollar, which fell sharply on world markets Thursday,
rebounded to close at 157.65 yen, up 1.00 yen from Thursday's Tokyo
close. After opening at 156.80 yen, the currency ranged between
156.75 yen and 157.95 yen.
   The yen's renewed slide and an overnight decline on Wall Street
triggered broad selling of stocks, dealers said.
   ``Declining futures, coupled with index-linked selling,
contributed to an overall decline,'' said Miyako Sekine, a dealer
with Nikko Securities.
   Nomura Securities analyst Yoshiro Inoue said many market players
``still suffer from pessimism and uncertainties.''
   The yen's decline also hammered bond prices, driving interest
rates up sharply. The yield on the benchmark No. 119 Japanese
government bond surged to 7.36 percent from 7.20 percent Thursday.
   Friday's decline capped another volatile week for the stock
market.
   After a steep plunge last week, the Nikkei rebounded more than
500 points last Friday and then started this week with its
second-biggest single-day gain ever, a surge of 1,468.33 points on
Monday.
   Pessimism about the yen and its impact on interest rates has
continued to haunt the market, though. The index fell 562 points on
Wednesday and a further 237 points on Thursday.
   The dollar traded in an unusually broad range of more than 1 yen
on Friday.
   ``The dollar fluctuated sharply in the face of dollar-buying by
corporations at the end of the financial year and dollar-selling by
others for profit-taking,'' said Kozo Yoshida, a dealer with Mitsui
Bank.
   Many Japanese companies settle their annual accounts at the end
of March.
   Yoshida said there were no specific political or economic
factors affecting the exchange market Friday.
   The dollar has been advancing against the yen for several weeks
as Japanese corporations bought the currency amid general pessimism
about the yen and to help bolster their balance sheets at the close
of their fiscal year.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower Against Most Currencies, Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against most currencies in quiet
European trading this morning. Gold prices were mixed in light
trading.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they did not expect the dollar to
pick up any significant new trend until after the April 7 meeting
in Paris of finance ministers from the seven major industrialized
nations.
   They saw no major new initiatives emerging from the meeting but
anticipated a statement aimed at helping Japan support the yen,
which has dropped against the dollar in recent weeks.
   ``I already think the yen is a bit undervalued at its current
level,'' a trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said on condition of
anonymity.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 1 yen to a closing 157.65 yen. Later, in London, it
was quoted at a lower rate of 157.40 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday's
prices, included: 1.6941 West German marks, down from 1.6960;
1.4979 Swiss francs, down from 1.5005; 5.6988 French francs, down
from 5.7070; 1.9085 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9083; 1,249.00
Italian lire, up from 1,248.75; and 1.1712 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1742.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6423, compared with $1.635 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $371.30 a troy ounce,
down from $372.25 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $372.20.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $371.75, up from $371.70 late
Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.18 to close at a bid $373.11.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $4.96 a troy ounce, from
Thursday's $4.97.

<TEXT>
   Japan's consumer price index climbed a steep 3.6
percent in February from a year ago as a snap of cold weather
pushed up food prices, while a weak yen caused a rise in wholesale
prices, the government said Friday.
   The Management and Coordination Agency said February's
year-to-year gain was the largest since November 1981, when
consumer prices rose 3.8 percent.
   Compared with the previous month, consumer prices were up 0.3
percent.
   Higher vegetable prices resulting from heavy snow and cold
weather were largely responsible for last month's increase, said an
agency official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Vegetable prices jumped 17.3 percent in February, while prices
for fresh vegetable prices surged 24.9 percent, the agency said.
Fruit prices increased by 14.7 percent, and dairy products rose
10.8 percent.
   Recreation expenses registered a 5.1 percent increase, the
agency said.
   In the Tokyo area, consumer prices were up 0.4 percent in March
from the previous month and were 3.5 percent higher than a year
earlier, the government said. Tokyo-area prices are seen as an
early indicator of price movements for the rest of Japan.
   For the fiscal year ending Saturday, consumer prices in the
Tokyo-area were up 3.2 percent from the previous fiscal year.
   Separately, the Bank of Japan reported wholesale prices edged up
0.2 percent in the second 10 days of March from the previous 10-day
period and were up 3.8 percent from a year earlier.
   The central bank attributed the increase partly to the weak
Japanese yen. Wholesale prices have been rising gradually in recent
months as the yen's steady decline made imports more expensive.
   Meanwhile, Japan posted a $4.907 billion current account surplus
in February, down 32.4 percent from a year ago, the Finance
Ministry reported.
   This marked the 12th consecutive decline in the current account
surplus from year-earlier levels, the ministry said.
   Japan's trade surplus registered $5.491 billion in February,
down 35.6 percent drop a year ago. Exports totaled $21.5 billion,
down $500 million, or 2.2 percent from a year ago, while imports
climbed $2.6 billion, or 18.9 percent, to $16.1 billion.
   Separately, the government said the seasonally adjusted
unemployment rate fell to 2.1 percent in February as the job market
continued to tighten.
   February's jobless rate, down 0.1 percentage point from
January's 2.2 percent, matched the lowest level Japan has
maintained since last June.
   Japan's jobless rate would be higher if calculated by U.S. or
European methods. In Japan, members of the armed forces and people
working more than one hour in the last week of the month are
considered employed.

<HEAD>Hooker Chairman to Stand Trial on Bribe Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISBANE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of Australia's Hooker
Corp., which had U.S. retail and development interests before going
into provisional liquidation last year, was ordered Friday to stand
trial on corruption charges.
   A magistrate in the northern state of Queensland ruled that
George Herscu, chairman and former chief executive of Hooker
explain payments allegedly made to Russell Hinze, a former state
minister, in 1983.
   It was alleged that Herscu paid the money so that Hinze would
intervene in a dispute between the Brisbane City Council and a
shopping center development company associated with Herscu.
   During the preliminary hearing Herscu claimed the money was a
loan, to be used by Hinze to buy racehorses in New Zealand on
Herscu's behalf.
   But the hearing was told that no horses were ever purchased with
the money, which was repaid to Herscu after allegations about the
payments were made public in 1988.
   Herscu has not made any plea to the charges. The trial is
expected to start in June.
   Hooker Corp., a property development and retail company, entered
provisional liquidation in July 1989 with bank debts of about $1
billion.
   Its U.S. subsidiary, L.J. Hooker Corp., filed for Chapter 11
protection from creditors under U.S. bankruptcy law around the same
time.
   Since entering bankruptcy proceedings, L.J. Hooker has sold
assets including its Parisian Inc. department store chain based in
Birmingham, Ala., and its Merksamer Jewelers chain based in
Sacramento, Calif. It also has liquidated the New York-based B.
Altman &amp; Co. department store chain.
   An agreement recently was announced to sell portions of L.J.
Hooker's Bonwit Teller specialty department store company based in
New York.

<HEAD>Government Postpones Decision on NTT Breakup</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said Friday it would wait five years
before deciding whether to break up Japan's major
telecommunications company, whose recent stock slump has been
linked in part to investor worries about a breakup.
   The government still is the major shareholder in Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp., which was converted into a private
company in 1985.
   ``For the time being, we are going to promote rationalization of
the company without breaking it up,'' said Minister of Posts and
Telecommunications Takashi Fukaya. ``And if it is deemed necessary
(to break up the company), we will take up the matter again in 1995
and make the final conclusion.''
   A government advisory council suggested earlier this month that
NTT should be broken into three separate companies offering local,
long-distance and mobile telephone services.
   After two years of study, the council concluded that NTT's
virtual monopoly on telephone service has hindered free competition
in Japan's telecommunications market and led to inefficient
management of NTT.
   A final government decision had been expected at the end of
March, when the government was required to review the state of the
telecommunications market under the law that made NTT a private
company five years ago.
   But the Finance Ministry, in charge of offering NTT stock to the
public, has strongly opposed a breakup, claiming it will hurt NTT
shareholders.
   Hundreds of shareholders have complained to the ministry that
the price of NTT stock has slumped to about 1.1 million yen, or
$7,050, a share from 3.18 million yen, or $20,385, in April 1987,
shortly after its listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   Company officials have attributed recent declines to a general
stock market slump as well as worries about a breakup, which NTT
opposes on grounds it would lead to duplication of effort by the
long-distance and local service companies.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said the government's
decision to postpone a conclusion on breaking up NTT ``reflects the
government's understanding about the concern of shareholders.''
   Hashimoto also hinted that the ban on foreign investors holding
NTT shares is likely to be removed soon.

   The stock market gave ground today in a
carryover of selling from Thursday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.43 to 2,720.27
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 361 up, 481 down and

<TEXT>
   A suburban Kansas City publisher says
he's confident of success for the new afternoon tabloid newspaper
he will launch May 14.
   Stephen F. Rose, president and co-publisher of Sun Publications
Inc., announced plans Thursday for a five-day paper called The
Evening News. He said the paper will fill a void created when The
Kansas City Star Co. closed its afternoon paper on March 1 and
merged it with the morning Times.
   ``We certainly felt it left a vacuum,'' Rose said.
   According to Rose, the Monday-through-Friday publication will
start with a daily press run of 25,000. It will be sold on the
street for 50 cents but won't be distributed to homes.
   ``We expect it to appeal to busy people who want more
information, people who don't want to wait 24 hours to find out
what happened today,'' Rose said.
   Rose, 42, is the sole investor in the new paper. The
family-owned company currently publishes 18 twice-weekly papers in
the affluent Johnson County suburbs, plus two weeklies, the College
Boulevard News and The Kansas City Jewish Chronicle.
   Jack Lovelace, editor of the Sun Newspapers, will assume
additional duties as managing editor of the new paper.
   Rose declined to say how much it would cost to run the paper,
but said he's saving money by using Sun Publications' printing
press, other equipment and some employees. The paper will buy
additional composing equipment and writing terminals.
   Between 30 and 35 additional full- and part-time employees will
be hired. The paper's editorial staff will consist of 12 to 17
full- and part-time employees.
   The Evening News will have 24 to 28 pages each day and will be
sold at newsstands, convenience stores and newspaper racks.

<HEAD>Arbitrator Says GM Didn't Breach Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. did not violate its contract
with the United Auto Workers union by idling the Fiero assembly
plant in Pontiac, Mich., an arbitrator ruled.
   The ruling by arbitrator Thomas Roberts of Los Angeles upheld
GM's contention that the plant, which shut down in August 1988
after a sharp decline in sales of the two-seat sports car, is
indefinitely idled rather than closed. About 1,700 workers were
laid off.
   ``We're obviously pleased with the arbitrator's ruling that GM
did not violate the terms of the national agreement,'' the company
said in a statement Thursday.
   ``From the outset of this disagreement, it was our position that
... these actions were caused by volume-related market decreases
and demand for the product and therefore justifiable,'' a GM
spokesman said.
   The ruling could raise tensions between the union and the
automaker as they prepare for contract negotiations next summer.
   ``The decision provides a clear imperative to improve the job
security provisions of our contract in the new agreement,'' said
Stephen Yokich, the UAW's vice president in charge of the union's
GM department.
   UAW officials have vowed they would press to close loopholes in
the existing three-year contract's plant closing prohibition.
   Despite the prohibition, the automaker has laid off 10 percent
of its UAW work force since 1987. GM plants in Leeds, Mo. and
Framingham, Mass. have been idled, and a third facility in
Lakewood, Ga. is to halt production this summer.
   GM began building Fiero cars at the Pontiac plant in 1984 and
showcased the facility as a model of labor-management cooperation.
The UAW agreed to set aside a number of longstanding work rules
that limited management flexibility in running the plant.
   But Fiero sales plunged in 1987 partly because of defect
problems, and GM ordered a massive recall late in the year to
correct problems causing engine fires in 1984 models.
   When GM announced in 1988 that the plant would close, Yokich's
predecessor, Donald Ephlin, came under fire from UAW dissidents for
championing cooperative labor-management relations. Yokich replaced
Ephlin as head of the union's 300,000-member GM department nine
months ago.

   Despite a top executive's contention that a
4-week-old strike is losing its impact, Greyhound Lines Inc. and
its bus drivers' union say they will return to the negotiating
table next week.
   Greyhound broke off talks with the Amalgamated Council of
Greyhound Local Unions on March 18, citing continued violence since
the drivers walked out March 2.
   Although the company says the violence is continuing daily, with
more than 200 incidents overall, it has agreed to resume
negotiations Monday in Tucson, Ariz.
   Greyhound spokesman Steve Scarpino said a shot was fired at a
Greyhound bus about two miles east of Tulsa, Okla., early today. No
one was hurt, he said. in Oklahoma, Rogers County Sheriff's Office
dispatcher Lance Beard said officers were investigating the
shooting on Interstate 44.
   Scarpino said the bus was en route to New York from Tulsa with
26 passengers aboard when what appeared to be pellets struck the
windshield of the bus. The windshield was damaged, he said.
   The union has condemned the violence and says its officials are
not involved.
   Bernard DeLury, head of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation
Service, said Thursday that two mediators will participate in the
negotiations.
   Union spokesman Jeff Nelson said, ``We assume that if they have
agreed to go back to the table, we hope that they would be
interested in negotiating.''
   Previous negotiations have ended with the two sides at odds on
wage and job security issues. The company says it can afford no
more than the $63 million, three-year pact it is offering.
   However, the union and Greyhound differ over the value of the
union's proposal, with Greyhound saying the last offer would cost
$180 million and the union putting the value at about $40 million.
   Greyhound, operating with crossovers and permanent replacements,
said Thursday it will expand service Sunday putting it at 54.1
percent of its total pre-strike miles. The company is adding 112
round trips that will increase service to some cities and add 50
destinations.
   President Frank Schmieder said Greyhound would like to end the
``open warfare'' with the union, but contended ``we're beginning to
have plenty of drivers. ... In certain areas, yes, it's over.''
   ``Essentially through the Southeast and Southwest, I think it's
over,'' Schmieder said in an interview Wednesday. ``Chicago,
Minneapolis, it's over,'' although ``it's still tight'' in the
Northeast and West, he said.
   ``If the company were being as successful as it's claimed to be,
I think you would have seen some kind of rush back to work,'' the
union's Nelson said. ``That has not happened, and that has not
happened, number one, because the company is not up and running.''
   Nelson claimed the company is operating only 20 percent of
pre-strike routes.
   While Greyhound says it has been increasing the number of routes
it is serving during the strike, Schmieder said Greyhound has no
near-term plans to restore service to about 32 percent of the total
Greyhound system that is unprofitable.
   The decision could leave numerous areas without any intercity
bus transportation, but Greyhound spokeswoman Elizabeth Hale said
Thursday the company would attempt to subcontract some of the
routes.
   ``In no way are we abandoning that 32 percent forever,'' she
said.
   Greyhound is the only nationwide bus company, serving about
9,500 pre-strike destinations. In about 9,000 of those areas, the
company provides the only intercity transportation.

<HEAD>NASD Proposes Ending Trading in Penny Stocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers
has proposed eliminating penny stocks from its over-the-counter
trading system, partly in response to a crackdown on fraud in the
low-cost securities.
   The self-regulatory agency said Thursday it would seek
government approval to effectively double the standards companies
must meet to be listed on the NASDAQ stock system.
   NASDAQ stands for the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotations system, a computerized stock price quotation
system owned and operated by the NASD.
   The move is expected to eliminate about 500 low-cost, high-risk
securities _ known as penny stocks because they usually trade for
less than a dollar _ from the NASDAQ system. About 5,000 stocks
currently trade on NASDAQ.
   The new standards will not affect about 2,700 stocks traded on
the NASDAQ National Market, which already has a higher standard.
   The new standards, adopted by the NASD's board of governors
earlier this month, would require companies issuing stock for the
first time to have a minimum of $4 million in total assets and $2
million in capital and surplus, compared to the present
requirements of $2 million and $1 million.
   In addition to the currently required 100,000 shares of public
float for an issue, the float would have to have a market value of
$1 million. Float is the term used to describe the number of public
shares circulating in the market.
   Stocks would have to have a minimum bid price of $3 per share.
There is no minimum required now.
   Maintaining a stock listing on NASDAQ under the new rule would
require a company to have $2 million in assets, instead of the
$750,000 in effect now. Also, $1 million in capital surplus, up
from $375,000 would be required. The float would have to have a
market value of $200,000 and the stock would be required to have a
$1 minimum bid price.
   The changes, if approved by the Securities and Exchange
Commission, would not go into effect until next January, to give
already listed companies time to meet the new rule.
   NASD Executive Vice President John T. Wall said the changes
reflected the effects of inflation since the requirements were last
amended in 1981.
   Also prompting the changes was a Jan. 10 letter from the SEC
expressing concern that unscrupulous promoters might seek to
circumvent tougher rules for selling penny stocks by acquiring a
listing on NASDAQ Stock Market.
   Such a listing would exempt them from the SEC rule requiring a
client's written consent to buy stocks not listed by NASDAQ or a
stock exchange.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade as players staked
out their positions ahead of two Agriculture Department reports.
   The USDA's quarterly grain stocks report and annual spring
planting intentions report were scheduled for release after the
close of trading this afternoon.
   Of the two reports, the prospective plantings were of greater
interest to traders.
   That report is expected to show that U.S. farmers intend to
increase corn acreage this year by 4 percent to 75.2 million acres,
partly as a result of changes in government programs designed to
encourage corn planting.
   Analysts expect soybean acreage to drop by 3.6 percent to 58.5
million acres, while spring wheat plantings were estimated by
private analysts at 17.5 million acres, a very slight decline from
1989.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.53 a bushel;
corn was { cent to 1 cent higher with May at $2.60{; oats were 1
cent to 1\ cents higher with May at $1.47} a bushel; soybeans were
unchanged to 2 cents higher with May at $5.91{.
   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, where traders were taking positions
ahead of this afternoon's quarterly USDA hogs and pigs inventory,
which was expected to show a 2.6 percent decline in the nation's
hog herd from a year ago.
   Live cattle futures were .12 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
April at 77.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .20
cent higher with April at 82.12 cents a pound; live hogs were .37
cent lower to .10 cent higher with April at 52.57 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .47 cent lower with May at
52.65 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly lower on Thursday.

   Gillette Co. said Friday it had agreed to sell its
European skin and hair care operations to Nobel Consumer Goods AB
of Sweden for about $107 million.
   Gillette also will collect an additional $30 million from
accounts in those businesses, the company said.
   The brands to be sold include Silkience hair care products,
Aapri skin care items, Antica Erobristeria herbal toiletries in
Italy and La Toja toiletry products in Spain.
   Gillette said last year it planned to sell the businesses as
part of a realignment to make the company more efficient. Officials
said the European operations being sold were not as successful as
the company had hoped.
   Gillette spokesman David Fausch said the businesses being bought
by Nobel had about $132 million in sales last year. That compares
with Gillette's worldwide toiletry sales of about $1 billion.
   The proceeds from the sale will offset the costs of the
realignment, Fausch said.
   Gillette's European deodorants, antiperspirants and shaving
creams are not part of the transaction.
   Nobel is a division of Nobel Industries.

   The stock market showed a broad loss today in a
carryover of selling from Thursday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 15.99 points
Thursday, dropped 18.02 to 2,709.68 by noontime today on Wall
Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 5 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 364 up, 877
down and 529 unchanged.
   Analysts said enthusiasm for stocks was restrained by continuing
doubts about the outlook for interest rates. Rates rose slightly in
the government bond market today.
   Traders also reacted warily to renewed selling in the Tokyo
stock market, where prices fell 3.37 percent in the last session of
Japan's fiscal year.
   In recent weeks U.S. stock prices have been holding steady while
the Japanese market has suffered a sharp setback.
   But some observers still worry that ripple effects from the drop
in Tokyo could soon start to spread more generally to other
financial centers around the world.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express dropped \ to
25~; International Business Machines \ to 105}; General Electric \
to 64\, and Philip Morris \ to 39}.
   Amax, which rose sharply over the past few sessions on takeover
speculation, dropped back 1 to 27~ as the volume leader among NYSE
issues.
   The New York exchange's composite index of all its listed common
stocks dropped .91 to 186.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index was down 1.25 at 358.98.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 68.06 million shares at
noontime, against 63.15 million at the same point Thursday.

   The Senate appears on track to approving a
sweeping air pollution control bill next week after narrowly
rejecting $500 million in aid to coal miners who could lose their
jobs because of tougher environmental standards.
   By a 50-49 vote Thursday, senators defeated a proposal that Sen.
Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., called only a matter of ``fairness ... and
justice'' because thousands of miners will be thrown out of work.
   The majority heeded warnings from Senate leaders that the
amendment would prompt a presidential veto of the overall bill.
   The three-year, $500 million assistance program was considered
to be the last major obstacle to Senate passage of the clean air
bill. A vote on the legislation is scheduled for next Tuesday. A
House version is in committee.
   Working into the evening Thursday, the Senate agreed to a
provision that would require the increased sale of a cleaner blend
of gasoline by 1993 in cities facing the worst smog problems. The
measure was approved by voice vote after attempts to reject it
failed, 69-30.
   The nine cities that would fall under the new clean fuels
requirement are Los Angeles, Houston, New York City, Milwaukee,
Baltimore, Philadelphia, Hartford, Conn., San Diego and Chicago.
   Meanwhile, the House Energy and Commerce Committee late Thursday
adopted a proposal in its clean air bill that also would require
the use of a cleaner blend of gasoline by 1995 in the same cities,
although rejecting a plan to broaden the requirement from nine to
as many as 40 cities.
   Thursday's vote on the Byrd amendment was as dramatic as the
final tally would indicate.
   Senators were subject to intense pressure from both sides.
   Byrd, who wields considerable power and respect as a former
Democratic leader and now chairman of the Appropriations Committee,
had visited dozens of senators to plead for support.
   He thought he had enough votes to win as the count began,
although a number of senators had not yet made firm commitments to
either side. Sen. Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, a staunch Byrd ally
who suffers from cancer, arrived for the vote in a wheelchair.
   But the pressure was just as intense from the other side. The
White House unleashed a final round of telephone calls to key
senators, including some calls as the vote already was under way.
   The Senate leaders of both parties _ George Mitchell, D-Maine,
and Bob Dole, R-Kan. _ used every means of persuasion to line their
senators up against the amendment. And the White House passed the
word that President Bush would veto the bill if it contained the
miner aid provision.
   ``I know how hard it is to say no to the president of the United
States,'' Byrd said later. ``Three of my votes took wings,'' he
lamented, alluding to three senators who changed votes in the final
minutes.
   The administration had strongly opposed the coal miner aid
package, arguing that it was too expensive and singled out one
industry while workers in other fields also might lose their jobs
but not have special benefits.
   Senate leaders also had feared that if the measure were approved
other senators would seek similar financial aid for workers in
other industries. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, promised to do just
that.
   Mitchell said thousands of workers in other industries,
including steel and petrochemicals, also could suffer job losses
and would not have such benefits.
   But Byrd urged colleagues to ``hear the cries of people'' and
maintained that helping the miners was no different that the
federal assistance given to victims of a hurricane or earthquake,
who suffer because of no fault of their own.
   ``We're not asking for welfare,'' he declared.
   The government estimates as many as 5,000 miners of high-sulfur
coal, primarily in Appalachia and parts of the Midwest, will lose
their jobs because of new controls on sulfur dioxide emissions
required by Midwest electric power plants.
   The utilities are likely to shift from using high-sulfur coal to
a cleaner fuel such as low-sulfur Western coal or natural gas,
causing some Eastern mines to close.
   Under Byrd's proposal, miners of high-sulfur coal, who lose
their jobs because utilities switched fuels, would have received up
to 70 percent of their salaries for three years and additional
funds if they participated in a retraining program.
   The benefits would have been available as long as the miner was
unemployed during the three years.

   The Senate Banking Committee today narrowly
endorsed President Bush's nominee for top savings and loan
regulator.
   The panel voted 11-10 to recommend T. Timothy Ryan Jr. to be
director of the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
The matter now goes to the full Senate.
   Two Democrats joined all nine Republicans on the panel in
backing Ryan. The vote came after Democrats spent 90 minutes
complaining that Ryan, a former senior Labor Department official,
lacked experience for the job.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, Jr., D-Mich., said Ryan's qualifications
were ``woefully short of the quality necessary to do this job.''
Riegle had said earlier that the panel probably would vote against
Ryan's nomination.
   Republicans argued that someone with more experience in the
savings and loan industry probably would be disqualified by virtue
of conflicts of interest. They argued that rejecting Ryan would
only serve to derail Bush's savings and loan bailout and increase
costs to the taxpayer.
   Democrats voting for Ryan were Sens. Richard C. Shelby of
Alabama and Terry Sanford of North Carolina. Sanford told reporters
he was a personal friend of Ryan while Shelby said he believed it
was important to fill the position quickly and that the full Senate
should vote on the nomination.
   The administration has had difficulty finding a nominee since M.
Danny Wall announced in early December that he would resign. It has
been under pressure to find a replacement because at least five
thrifts are challenging the thrift office's constitutional
authority to seize troubled S&amp;Ls.
   Last summer's S&amp;L legislation automatically gave the director's
job to Wall, chairman of the thrift office's predecessor agency,
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. He was not nominated and
confirmed for the director's job.
   In the latest challenge, U.S. District Court Judge Charles A.
Legge in San Francisco on Thursday denied a temporary restraining
order that would have removed government agents from the helm of
Pacific Coast Savings and Loan Assocation, a a San Francisco-based
institution with $1.04 billion in assets.
   Ryan, a former senior Labor Department official nominated last
week, met skepticism from committee Democrats during a hearing on
his nomination Wednesday.
   Lawmakers questioned his lack of direct experience in banking
and raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest in his
work as a private attorney after leaving government in 1983.
   As solicitor of the Labor Department, he helped hire former
Attorney General William B. Saxbe as independent counsel overseeing
the Teamsters Union Central States Pension Fund. After Ryan left
the government, Saxbe joined Ryan's firm, bringing with him
hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees from the fund.
   The administration has portrayed Ryan as an experienced manager
who supervised 600 attorneys at the Labor Department and a tough
enforcer who helped clean up corruption in the Teamsters pension
fund.

   Prices fell on London's Stock Exchange Friday
after investors found little inspiration to trade.
   Shares languished within a very narrow band throughout the day
with investors waiting for the new quarter to begin on Monday,
dealers said.
   A weak start on Wall Street depressed London prices a bit,
dealers said.
   By the end of the European day, the Dow Jones industrial average
was off 19.15 points at 2,708.55.
   ``We're not inclined to do anything just at the moment,'' said
one dealer. At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-stock index was off 15.1 points, or 0.7 percent, at 2,247.9. It
was just above its session minimum of 2,245.5 and below its
midmorning peak of 2,271.0.
   Volume came to a modest 453.7 million shares, little changed
from 435.2 million shares Thursday.

<TEXT>
   First Chicago Corp., the Midwest's largest
banking company, said it expects to show a 50 percent decline in
first-quarter profits largely due to bad commercial real estate
loans.
   That would put earnings for the year's first quarter at about
$60 million, or 86 cents a share, compared with a profit of $120
million, or $1.72 a share in the 1989 first quarter.
   That is considerably below the $1.30- to $1.50-a-share earnings
estimates that many industry analysts were predicting earlier this
month.
   First Chicago said its non-performing assets will increase by
about $150 million, up 15 percent from the year-end total of $1.1
billion.
   The announcement was made after Thursday's stock market close.
First Chicago's stock had ended the day down $1 at $31.37 a share,
near its 52-week low of $30.75.
   First Chicago placed most of the blame on its commercial real
estate loan portfolio, but the bank said profits from its venture
capital and trading activities also declined.
   Shortly after the announcement, Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. lowered
its ratings on First Chicago's senior debt to A from A-plus.
Ratings on preferred stock were lowered to BBB-plus from A-minus.

<HEAD>Airbus Rejects India's Accusations of Corrurning and winking at Poindexter.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   ``When people come into court we expect them to give fair and
truthful testimony,'' Webb said. ``But when a person is so biased
he turns to wink at someone as if to say `Did that last answer help
you, John?' _ I would have expected more from a former president
than that,'' Webb said.
   Webb ridiculed Reagan's defense of three letters Poindexter sent
to Congress in July, 1986, which falsely denied that the National
Security Council staff was secretly orchestrating arms shipments to
the Contras.
   The prosecutor recalled that when Reagan was shown one of the
letters, the former president said he agreed with its contents and
added ```I would have added in a profanity.'''
   ``He gave that testimony because he hoped it would help John
Poindexter,'' Webb said. ``He hadn't the foggiest idea those were
false letters sent to obstruct Congress.''
   Webb, a former U.S. attorney in Chicago appointed by Reagan,
argued that Poindexter tore up a document authorizing U.S.
involvement in Iranian arms sales to protect Reagan from political
embarrassment.
   ``This is the one document in the world it puts the lie to what
Ronald Reagan told the American people'' when he denied in a Nov.
13, 1986, speech that he had sold arms to Iran to try to free
American hostages, Webb said.
   The document, an intelligence ``finding'' signed by Reagan in
December 1985, authorized the CIA's involvement a month earlier in
the shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran. It described the transaction
as an effort to free U.S. hostages.
   Reagan's speech marked ``a rather sad day in America,'' Webb
said, because even though the decision to trade arms for hostages
might be defensible ``you don't lie to the American public.''
   Webb said that Poindexter, after lying to two congressional
committees on Nov. 21, 1986, about U.S.-Iran arms sales, returned
to his office and ``he tore up the original finding signed by the
president of the United States.''
   The prosecutor, ripping up a copy of the document to dramatize
his point, said, ``The act of tearing up that finding is strong
evidence'' Poindexter ``intended to obstruct Congress.''
   Poindexter, who served as Reagan's national security adviser
from late 1985 until his resignation on Nov. 25, 1986, is also
accused of deceiving Congress about White House involvement in
covert assistant to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   Webb recounted testimony by former National Security Council
aide Oliver L. North that he was ``generally instructed'' by
Poindexter to lie to lawmakers about the secret aid network.
   North ``was there because the defendant on trial in this case,
his commander, sent him there to do that,'' Webb said. ``The boss
can't escape legal responsibility just because he didn't get his
hands dirty.''

   Political and economic trends have overtaken
Japan's financial markets, painfully ending an era during which
investing in the Tokyo Stock Exchange seemed to be a sure thing,
analysts say.
   From the beginning of 1990 through Friday's close of trading,
the market that once was the world's richest had lost 23 percent of
its value.
   The Japanese yen also has weakened, dropping more than 9 percent
to about 158 yen to the U.S. dollar after ending last year at
143.45 yen. And the dollar's rise to a three-year high against the
yen has occurred despite heavy dollar-selling by Japan's central
bank.
   Market analysts say these trends could continue during the next
few months as the yen and inflated stock prices readjust to
political developments and economic realities that have overtaken
Japan's monetary authorities and major brokerages.
   Japan's ``Big Four'' securities firms _ Nomura Securities, Daiwa
Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi _ account for about half
of the Tokyo market's total turnover.
   Their market activity and advice often are credited with pulling
the market out of slumps, such as the Oct. 20, 1987, crash that
followed the ``Black Monday'' plunge on Wall Street, and with
instilling the confidence that pushed the key Nikkei average up
almost 20,000 points between early 1987 and the end of last year,
when it peaked at 38,915.87.
   ``There's little doubt the major brokers accounted for lots of
the market activity in the latter half of last year,'' when the
market surged by about 4,000 points, says economist David Pike at
UBS Phillips and Drew International Ltd.
   But the late 1989 surge contradicted economic fundamentals by
reacting to speculation that interest rates were peaking, he said.
   Rather than peaking, domestic interest rates have continued
rising as monetary authorities fight inflationary pressures
stemming from wage hikes, a 3 percent sales tax and the weaker yen,
which raises the cost of fuel and other imports.
   Japan's central bank has raised its discount rate, the interest
it charges on loans to commercial banks, four times since last May
to fight inflation, which economists expect to be in the 2
percent-2.5 percent range this year.
   The discount rate, which has a strong impact on other interest
rates, was raised to 5.25 percent on March 20. It was at a historic
low of 2.5 percent before the series of increases.
   Higher interest rates tend to discourage investment in the stock
market because higher yields can be found in other investments.
Analysts see higher rates as the single biggest factor behind the
stock market's prolonged decline.
   The yen's decline also has pushed stock prices lower.
   Higher interest rates generally make a country's currency more
attractive to investors. By reducing the outflow of capital from
Japan in the long run, the discount rate hike could reduce demand
for dollars and relieve downward selling pressure on the yen.
   But the Bank of Japan was ``backed into a corner,'' because
boosting rates was certain to further hurt the stock market, says
Peter Morgan, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities
Japan Ltd.
   Moreover, currency dealers had anticipated the latest rate
increase, which so far has failed to help _ in fact the dollar by
late Friday had risen to 157.65 yen from 152.70 yen on March 20.
   The yen also has suffered due to political developments in the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, which have strengthened the U.S.
dollar, seen as safest in times of uncertainty.
   Furthermore, Western Europe has become ``sexy'' due to
expectations of German reunification and the formation of the
European Common Market in 1992, luring Japanese investors away from
home markets, Morgan said.
   Many analysts say they expect the market to continue declining
in the short term as it adjusts to factors beyond the control of
brokerages or monetary authorities.
   ``Market sentiment is still deteriorating, so we certainly can't
expect a sharp recovery,'' says Susumu Kato, senior economist at
Goldman Sachs Japan.
   This year, higher borrowing costs will depress capital
investment and the weaker yen will increase the cost of imports,
cutting into corporate earnings, says Lawrence S. Prager, chief
analyst and strategist at Nikko Securities Co.
   But in the long run, Japan's powerhouse economy will take the
adjustments in stride, analysts say.
   ``These are not caused by major economic problems, but are a
matter of sentiment,'' says Kermit L. Schoenholtz, senior economist
at Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. ``The economy is extraordinarily
competitive and the weaker yen will further boost its export
competitiveness.

<HEAD>Campeau Not Paying Interest Due</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: The $260 million bond issue is in U.S. dollars.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Campeau Corp. on Friday said it will not pay interest due
Saturday on two debts and wants to defer the payments while the
retailing and real estate company develops a long-term business
plan.
   The Canadian company said it owes the semi-annual payments on
two of its outstanding bond issues.
   One of the issues, worth 184 million Canadian dollars, is
publicly traded and the other, worth $260 million, is owned by
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd., a big Toronto-based property
company.
   Richard W. Wertheim, a Campeau spokesman, said the interest due
on the publicly owned bonds is 6.9 million Canadian dollars and the
amount due on the Olympia &amp; York bonds is slightly less than $13
million.
   Campeau said in a news release that it could be in default on
the two issues if it doesn't pay the interest by April 30. However,
it said it intends to pursue discussions on deferring the payments.
   Wertheim said Campeau is fairly confident that the creditors
will agree to temporarily waive the interest payments.
   He also said the company is encouraged by the progress it has
made in discussions with its various creditors on a long-term
business plan.
   He declined to specify what the plan might entail but said it
will address running the business in the future and will deal with
Campeau's debt situtation in some way.
   ``We're rather optimistic that we can work our way through
this,'' he said.
   Analysts have speculated that Campeau's business plan could
include a restructuring of debt and major asset sales. Some outside
observers have questioned whether Campeau will be able to survive
in its existing form or stay in business at all.
   Campeau, based in Toronto, owns commercial real estate,
including office buildings and shopping centers. Its properties
mainly are in the Canadian cities of Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa.
   The current debt woes facing Campeau are related to, but
separate from, the problems of its two U.S. retailing units, Allied
Stores Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc., which are in
bankruptcy proceedings.
   Campeau's acquisition of Allied and Federated in 1986 and 1988
saddled the two department store operators with heavy debts. Allied
and Federated listed debts totaling $7.7 billion when they filed
for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Act in January.

   The stock market declined slightly today in a
carryover of selling from Thursday's session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 15.99 points
Thursday, dropped 5.40 to 2,722.30 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 604 up, 753 down and
546 unchanged.
   Analysts said enthusiasm for stocks was restrained by continuing
doubts about the outlook for interest rates. Rates rose slightly in
the government bond market today.
   Traders also reacted warily to renewed selling in the Tokyo
stock market, where prices fell 3.37 percent in the last session of
Japan's fiscal year.
   In recent weeks U.S. stock prices have been holding steady while
the Japanese market has suffered a sharp setback.
   But some observers still worry that ripple effects from the drop
in Tokyo could soon start to spread more generally to other
financial centers around the world.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express dropped &rsqb; to
25}; International Business Machines rose { to 106{; General
Electric gained &rsqb; to 64~, and Philip Morris was unchanged at 40.
   Amax, which rose sharply over the past few sessions on takeover
speculation, dropped back 1&rsqb; to 27{ as the volume leader among NYSE
issues.
   The New York exchange's composite index of all its listed common
stocks slipped .10 to 187.07. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index was up .09 at 360.32.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 107.50 million shares with an

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices surged in late trading
Friday to close strongly higher on the Chicago Board of Trade,
while grain futures finished mixed ahead of two eagerly awaited
government reports.
   Trading had been quiet for much of the session as players staked
out positions ahead of the Agriculture Department's quarterly grain
stocks report and annual report on spring planting intentions.
   Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago, attributed the late buying of soybean futures to talk that
the prospective corn plantings number would be higher and the
soybean number lower than the markets had earlier anticipated.
   Analysts had expected the report to show that U.S. farmers
intend to increase corn acreage this year by 4 percent to 75.2
million acres from 72.3 million acres, decrease soybean acreage by
3.6 percent to 58.5 million acres from 60.7 million, and decrease
spring wheat acreage by about 1 percent to 17.5 million acres from
17.7 million.
   The report, which was released after the close, showed plans for
a 3.5 percent increase in corn to 74.8 million acres, a 2.1 percent
decline in soybeans to 59.4 million acres, and a 4 percent decline
in spring wheat acreage to 17 million acres.
   Wheat futures settled 1\ cents lower to \ cent higher with the

<HEAD>Hallmark Sweetens Offer for Univision Debt Buyback</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hallmark Cards Inc. on Friday sweetened the
terms of its proposed buyback of $270 million in junk bonds issued
by its Univision Holdings Inc. subsidiary after its first offer
received a very chilly response.
   Under the revised offer, Hallmark would pay about 49 cents on
the dollar for the two series of securities, up from about 39 cents
on the dollar under the initial offer that was to have expired
early Friday.
   But the greeting card company warned that if the tender offers
are unsuccessful, Univision will file for protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. The
Hallmark board approved that course of action at a meeting earlier
this week, the Kansas City, Mo.-based company said.
   A financial advisor to the bondholders called the revised offers
``constructive'' and indicated the bondholders intended to review
them over the weekend and discuss them among themselves on Monday.
   Univision owns eight television stations and operates the
nation's biggest Spanish-language television network which reaches
92 percent of the Hispanic households in the country.
   In announcing the revised offer for the bond debt, Hallmark and
Univision also said they had reached an agreement in principle with
Univision's bank lending group on a plan that reschedules payments
on $315 million owed to banks and increases the availability of
funds to Univision.
   Hallmark also said it had agreed with the banks that if the
restructuring of Univision's debt is completed, Hallmark will defer
interest payments on the securities tendered for seven years rather
than the five years earlier proposed.
   Company executives say that while Univision's business is
growing, the company has run into stiffer than expected competition
and has been unable to meet the terms of its current financial
structure.
   Univision missed $10 million in interest payments that were due
Feb. 1 to its bank lenders and bondholders, citing insufficient
cash flow.
   Several days later, Hallmark launched a plan to rescue Univision
that included paying $105.75 million for its $270 million in bond
debt.
   But Hallmark said that with one day left under its once-extended
tender offers that were to have expired at 12:01 a.m. Friday, only
8 percent of one issue and 4 percent of the other had been
tendered. Hallmark wanted at least 95 percent of the bonds tendered
under the initial offers.
   The revised tender offers are scheduled to expire at 12:01 a.m.
Friday, April 13, and Hallmark lowered the minimum acceptable
amount to 90 percent.
   Hallmark paid about $600 million to acquire the Univision
network and TV stations over three years ended in 1988. It owns a
63.5 percent stake in Univision, while First Chicago Investment
Corp. holds 21.5 percent and a private trust owns the remainder.
   Wilbur Ross, senior managing director at Rothschild Inc. which
is serving as financial advisor to holders of a majority of the
Univision bonds, said the first Hallmark offer had been ``pretty
much rejected out of hand.''
   But he said the new offers, which Hallmark valued at $131
million, were about 25 percent higher than the first ones valued at
$106 million.
   ``We regard this as a very constructive development. It is a
good faith offer. No decision has yet been made but people are
taking this offer quite seriously,'' Ross said.
   Among the issues which will be studied, he said, are the
sufficiency of the offers and how they allocate values between the
two debt issues.
   Hallmark said that under the revised offer it would pay:
   _$553 per $1,000 principal amount for the $165 million in senior
subordinated discount notes, up from $450 per $1,000 principal
amount.
   _$379 per $1,000 in principal amount for the $105 million in 13&rsqb;
percent subordinated debentures, up from $300 per $1,000 principal
amount.

   For a company that claims to run the
tightest ship in the shipping business, the place looks pretty
loose. There's a duck pond, women pushing strollers and executives
in shirt sleeves taking afternoon walks.
   But rivals aren't fooled by the serene headquarters of United
Parcel Service, the package-delivery giant known for its
distinctive brown vans. UPS is pushing hard to make itself the
carrier of choice around the world.
   In the last decade, UPS has substantially increased its fleet of
vans and planes, expanded delivery to 180 countries and
territories, and is working on advancements like computerized
mapping to help drivers figure out the fastest way to travel a
route.
   Such improvements are considered vital in a business that's
become fiercely competitive in recent years. UPS, Federal Express
Corp. and overseas firms like TNT Ltd. and DHL Worldwide Express
have all been expanding and improving operations to capture a
bigger share of the worldwide air delivery industry.
   UPS still leads the pack, with 230,000 employees and 2.8 billion
deliveries last year for a record $12.4 billion in revenues _ about
$7 billion more than its nearest rival, Federal Express.
   The company that proclaims in advertisements ``We run the
tightest ship in the shipping business'' started as a messenger
service in Seattle in 1907, then quickly got into the package
business by delivering packages for department stores to their
customers.
   The next 70 years were spent expanding ground service to all
corners of the country, a task it essentially accomplished in 1978.
Air delivery was started on a limited basis in 1929 but was
terminated a few years later in the midst of the Depression. UPS
restarted it in 1953 and expanded it nationwide in 1980.
   Going head to head with the Postal Service, UPS also strove to
be the fastest and least expensive carrier, hiring engineers to
poke around and find places to save a dime here or a moment there.
   The seats on the trucks were designed so drivers can slip off
easily. Plexiglas skylights were installed in vans to eliminate
overhead lights.
   Drivers are taught to toot their horns before deliveries so the
customer comes to the door. Even the pockets of their pants are
designed to make it easy to make change for customers.
   But while UPS was becoming more efficient on the ground, other
players snuck into the game and soared above them in the air
freight business. Federal Express, which began in 1973, reported $1
billion in annual revenues by 1983. DHL, based in Brussels, became
the first worldwide shipper to serve the Soviet Union, in 1985, and
China, in 1988.
   Suddenly UPS had to play catchup.
   ``Our customers began telling us they needed a next-day air
service,'' says John Alden, group manager of business development,
forcing UPS into overnight air delivery.
   UPS responded quickly. It bought 20 planes in 1981-82, began
overnight delivery and expanded to 88 percent of the country in a
single year. It bought 52 more planes through 1985 and by the end
of the year had overnight service in every state but Alaska.
   It also launched international service in 1985, starting with
six European countries, expanding to 16 countries in 1986, 163
countries by April 1989 and 175 countries by August. UPS entered
Eastern Europe last December, expanding its scope to more than 180
countries.
   This year UPS began flying its own planes to Hong Kong and South
Korea, which meant the company was able to end a contract with
Flying Tiger International Inc. Federal Express bought Flying Tiger
last year, which had put UPS in the uncomfortable position of
having the competition carry its packages.
   Analysts believe more than one carrier can flourish in the
delivery business, partly because of an enormous growth in the
number of international businesses and the need for speedily moving
goods between countries.
   ``The shippers I come in contact with always find ways to keep
two guys in business,'' said Tony Robertson, a securities analyst
at the Alex Brown &amp; Sons Inc. brokerage of Baltimore. That way,
they ward off heavy price increases.
   UPS, for its part, plans to add more planes and expand service
overseas. It's also adopting new high-technology efficiencies for
home and abroad, like a computer system that will provide drivers
with the fastest way to work their routes, or determine the closest
driver when someone calls for a pickup.
   Another innovation is an automated sorting system that will
route a package by reading a code the size of a postage stamp.
   UPS also is developing a system to alert Customs officials about
package contents, costs and addresses before parcels arrive on a
foreign front, cutting down the time it takes to inspect and bill
each package.
   ``You reach a point where you can't save any more'' on standard
efficiencies, Alden said. ``Now you ask, what else can you do? And
that's where we hope technology can truly help us.''
   UPS officials have predicted the company won't make a profit
until 1993 from international operations. They also have
acknowledged that the competition is working just as hard on the
kinds of expansions and improvements UPS is banking on.
   ``The next 10 years are going to be tremendous challenges, but
tremendous opportunities,'' Alden said. ``International is just
beginning, and there's going to be tremendous expansion in our
service around the world.''

<HEAD>Carrier Blasts Liquidation `Rumors'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN SEWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines on Friday blasted rumors that the
carrier faces liquidation as it tries to overcome growing
skepticism about its ability to survive.
   Eastern, which last year promised to repay creditors 100 percent
then slashed that by half, this week said it wanted to cut the 50
cents-per-dollar payback plan even further. Immediately afterward,
unsecured creditors discussed a potential call for Eastern's
liquidation.
   Eastern took the unusual step of releasing a statement in which
President Phil Bakes denounced ``the latest wild rumors.''
   ``Liquidation is not in the best interests of any group involved
in the bankruptcy,'' spokesman Robin Matell said. ``The unsecured
creditors would wind up with little at best and maybe nothing in
liquidation.
   ``We think the creditors' stance is a negotiating position ...
If it ws in their best interests, they would have advocated it long
ago. Eventually, reason is going to take hold and prevail,'' Matell
said, adding that negotiations were continuing with the creditors.
   Frank Ortis, local president of the striking Machinists union,
said the union was delighted with the unsecured creditors'
discussion, which he said ``moves us closer to what we've wanted
all along _ to buy the airline.''
   Eastern charged in its statement that the liquidation
speculation is being orchestrated by ``bitter unions who nearly
destroyed Eastern a year ago and are trying to do it through
vicious rumors and leaks at the early stages of confidential
committee deliberations.''
   Some reports this week indicated the parent Texas Air Corp. was
encouraging creditors to hold off on liquidation talk until final
approval of the sale of Eastern's Latin American routes to American
Airlines.
   Approved Thursday by Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland, the sale
needs approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation and
foreign governments involved.
   Matell said the sale could be approved as early as April 6,
clearing the way for bringing $349 million directly to Eastern in a
three-way deal that also will give Texas Air some of the proceeds.
   Eastern is in a strong cash position with some $800 million
already, Matell said, and the carrier reported good response to a
new ``Y-Not'' promotion that courts business travellers with
first-class fares 15 percent below standard coach fares.
   However, Eastern has consistently fallen short of revenues
projections, mainly because frequent business fliers, the strongest
revenue base for most airlines, are leery of Eastern. The carrier
was hit March 4, 1989, by a paralyzing strike, filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy reorganization five days later, and has slowly rebuilt
while repeatedly missing bankruptcy deadlines and revenue
projections.
   Bakes' statement said Eastern is going ahead with plans to add
seven daily roundtrip flights this Sunday, between Atlanta and the
cities of New Orleans, Norfolk, Va., Richmond, Va.,
Greenville-Spartanburg, S.C., and the Florida cities of Fort Myers,
Pensacola, and Sarasota.
   Eastern has about 800 daily flights, compared to 1,080 before
the strike. It had just 100 a day in the first weeks of the strike.
   ``Eastern is running better than ever,'' Bakes said. ``Our
domestic load factor this month is 68 percent and we're operating
99 percent of our scheduled flights.''

<HEAD>Judge Drops Lincoln Thrift Owner's Case Against Regulators</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MEL REISNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday dismissed the suit American
Continental Corp. filed against federal regulators, which accused
them of hurting the survival chances of its Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association subsidiary by leaking confidential information.
   U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby agreed to dismiss the case
without prejudice, meaning it may be refiled or reopened. But Bilby
added that unless American Continental took action by July 1, the
claim would be dismissed with prejudice.
   Bilby precipitated a March 7 motion by American Continental to
dismiss the suit when he barred the company from continuing to pay
lawyers to pursue the case. He cited the fear that attorneys' fees
would use up the equity in American Continental.
   The company's legal bill had been reaching $1 million a month.
   In other action during the session, Bilby approved American
Continental's plan to raise $700,000 through the sale of stock and
agreed to give Los Angeles County District Attorney Ira Reiner
access to the voluminous documents in the case.
   Reiner said two weeks ago that his office planned to prosecute
the ``decision-makers'' responsible for selling junk bonds through
Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln. More than 23,000 investors claim they
were not warned of the risks in buying the uninsured bonds and lost
more than $200 million when the thrift failed.
   American Continental filed for reorganization under Chapter 11
last April 13, and the government seized Lincoln the next day.
   American Continental filed suit against the regulators last
spring.Bilby combined the bankruptcy case and the suit early this
year.
   The suit claimed regulators caused it more than $100 million in
losses through ``repeated, unlawful disclosures'' to the press.
   The defendants named in the suit included M. Danny Wall,
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision; Darrel W. Dochow, the
acting principal supervisory agent for Lincoln; and William K.
Black, general counsel of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board in San
Francisco.
   American Continental added Edwin J. Gray, former chairman of the
FHLBB, to the suit in January, but Bilby later severed Gray from
trial with the others. He was included in Bilby's blanket dismissal.
   The suit alleged that Rosemary Stewart, the top enforcement
attorney for the Office of Thrift Supervision, acknowledged in
congressional testimony that Gray and Black were engaged in a
vendetta against Lincoln.
   Ann Timmer, who represented Black, argued for dismissal with
prejudice.
   ``My client doesn't want to have a cloud hanging over his head
that says the only reason this case is dismissed is a lack of
money'' for lawyer's fees, she said.
   David G. Fiske, representing Dochow, said his client should not
be included among the defendants because the alleged vendetta dated
back to 1984, and Dochow, the former director of the home loan bank
board's Office of Regulatory Affairs, didn't enter the scene until
1987.
   Attorney Robert Milligan countered for American Continental that
Dochow was at least as culpable as the others for ``getting on the
horn with the Orange County (Calif.) Register'' and telling a
reporter that Lincoln had to be sold immediately, or the government
would seize it.
   ``That article had an adverse effect on Lincoln. There were huge
runs (by investors),'' Milligan said.
   ``It had the effect of causing people who might be interested in
financing the purchase of Lincoln from ACC to say, `I'm not going
to get involved,''' he added.
   The government has estimated the Lincoln failure may cost
taxpayers $2 billion, the most expensive S&amp;L bailout yet.
   Milligan argued that press coverage was slanted against the
corporation and Charles H Keating Jr., founder and chairman of the
Phoenix-based development company. Keating, members of his family
and other insiders are accused in a $1.1 billion Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. civil suit of plundering Lincoln to support
Keating's $3.7 million-a-year salary and lavish development schemes.
   The case acquired more notoriety with reports that Keating
contributed more than $1.3 million to the campaign treasuries five
U.S. senators who met with federal regulators on his behalf in 1987.

   The American Association of Retired Persons
said Friday it plans to close its 2-year-old credit union because
of a lack of interest from its members.
   AARP, the nation's largest organization for older Americans,
said all savings would be protected in the phase-out, which still
must be approved by the credit union's 90,000 members. The credit
union's board of directors voted Thursday to recommend that it be
closed by June 30.
   AARP spokesman Bob DeFillippo said the credit union offered its
members three services _ credit cards, certificates of deposits and
savings accounts _ of which only the credit card attracted much
interest.
   ``The other two just weren't that popular,'' DeFillippo said.
``There was a lack of participation.''
   Overall, the credit union had $150 million in assets, he said.
   Under the AARP's plan, Bank One in Columbus, Ohio, will issue an
AARP-sponsored VISA credit card that will be available to all AARP
members. People who now have credit cards from the credit union
will automatically become card holders through Bank One and be able
to continue to use their existing cards, AARP said.
   In addition, members will get a check for the amount in their
savings accounts, and certificates of deposit will be transferred
to Bank One.
   DeFillippo said the credit union's credit card, which was
tailored toward older Americans, was more popular than expected.
Applicants could use total assets, in addition to income, as a
qualification for acceptance.
   The new AARP credit card issued by Bank One also will take
assets into account when determining applicants' eligiblity for
credit, AARP said.

   Stock prices fell for the second straight
session today, finishing the first quarter of 1990 on a downbeat
note.
   Analysts said enthusiasm for stocks was restrained by continuing
doubts about the outlook for interest rates.
   Rates rose in the government bond market today. Prices of
long-term Treasury bonds dropped nearly $5 for each $1,000 in face
value, putting their yields in the 8.62 percent-8.67 percent range.
   Traders also reacted warily to renewed selling in the Tokyo
stock market, where prices fell 3.37 percent in the last activity
of Japan's fiscal year.
   In recent weeks U.S. stock prices have been holding steady while
the Japanese market has suffered a sharp setback.
   But some observers still worry that ripple effects from the drop
in Tokyo could soon start to spread more generally to other
financial centers around the world.

<HEAD>Judge Grants Stay in High-Tech Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge on Friday granted Motorola Inc.'s
request for a stay following his ruling that the company violated a
key computer chip patent and order to stop selling one of its
microprocessors.
   The stay was granted pending an appeal to the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in New Orleans, according to the U.S. District
Court clerk's office in Austin.
   Motorola spokesman Dan Rogers said the company sought the stay
of the court's injunction against domestic marketing and sale of
its 68030 microprocessor and ``is studying other legal remedies.''
   James A. Norling, president and general manager of Motorola's
semi-conductor products sector, said: ``We're disappointed by the
judge's decision. We are taking steps to ensure an uninterrupted
product supply to our 68030 customers.''
   The 68030 microprocessor is the centerpiece of a family of
Motorola products that are the electronic heart of millions of
personal computers and other electronic devices.
   A lawsuit between Motorola and Tokyo-based Hitachi Ltd. resulted
in each giant computer company receiving an award and a lecture on
Thursday from U.S. District Judge Lucius Bunton not to waste the
court's time.
   In a said 45-page opinion, Bunoted said the parties ``would have
saved time, money, feelings, and relations had they curbed their
emotions and sat down to settle their difference out of court.''
   Under Bunton's order, Hitachi will pay $1.9 million to Motorola
for patent infringements, and Motorola will pay $500,000 to Hitachi
for a patent infringement.
   The order prohibits the companies, allies since 1975 in sharing
technological and manufacturing advances, from marketing or selling
various lines of microprocessors.
   Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., sued Hitachi, claiming the
company was using Motorola secrets to develop a series of micro
controllers _ thumb-sized devices central to information-processing
devices used in computers. The micro controllers were designed and
manufactured in Austin.
   Hitachi filed a countersuit, claiming Motorola infringed on some
of its patents.
   The complex case was packed into a three-day trial in January.

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against the Japanese yen
to recoup its losses from the previous session but finished mixed
against other major currencies in hectic domestic trading Friday.
   Gold prices were mostly lower. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $370.20 a troy
ounce, off 60 cents from late Thursday. Republic National Bank in
New York quoted a late bid for gold at $370.25 an ounce, down $1.15.
   Although Japanese dealers and investors were largely absent due
to the close of the Japanese fiscal year, trading in the yen was
extremely active, dealers said.
   The dollar lost nearly two yen on Thursday in what some
observers called a ``mini-correction.'' But the U.S. currency began
advancing in Tokyo and ended the day a full two yen higher in New
York.
   Bolstering the dollar were ``expectations that Japan may not get
such a warm reception'' at the Group of Seven meeting, set to begin
April 7 in Paris, said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.
   Finance ministers from the world's leading industrialized
nations _ the United States, Canada, Britain, France, West Germany,
Italy and Japan _ will meet to discuss world markets and currency
levels.
   ``Japan is coming to the meeting with a very weak hand, with its
stock market weakness and with all the trade negotiations going
on,'' Flanagan said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 157.65 Japanese yen, from 156.65
yen on Thursday. Later in London, it slipped to 157.30 yen. But in
New York, the dollar closed at 158.35 yen, up sharply from 156.35
yen on Thursday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6465 from $1.6350 late
Thursday. In New York one pound cost $1.6455, more expensive than
Thursday's $1.6395.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates included: 1.6940 West German marks, unchanged;
1.4982 Swiss francs, up from 1.4935; 5.7020 French francs, down
from 5.7025; 1,248.75 Italian lire, up from 1,248.50, and 1.1695
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1720.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday's
rates included: 1.6875 West German marks, down from 1.6960; 1.4935
Swiss francs, down from 1.5005; 5.6765 French francs, down from
5.7070; 1.9008 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9083; 1,243.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,248.75, and 1.1700 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1742.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $369.25 a troy ounce,
from $372.25 bid late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $368.75 an ounce from $371.70 bid late Thursday.
Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.18 to close at a bid $373.11.
   Silver prices were virtually unchanged. On New York's Comex,
silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.945 a troy ounce,
fractionally lower than Thursday's $4.946. In London, the metal was
unchanged at $4.97 an ounce.

   The perjury conviction of former Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. trading assistant Lisa Jones was upheld Friday by a
federal appeals court. But her 18-month jail sentence was thrown
out.
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the trial judge
wrongly gave her a sentence greater than the 10- to 16-month term
recommended by new sentencing guidelines. The case was sent back to
U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand for resentencing.
   The three-judge panel said Sand's reason for lengthening the
sentence _ that Jones' perjury severely impeded the government's
Drexel investigation _ was not justified.
   A federal jury in March 1989 found Jones guilty on five counts
of perjury and two counts of obstruction of justice for lying to a
federal grand jury in January 1988 in an investigation of trading
involving Drexel.
   ``These instances of perjury, standing alone, do not constitute
the type of egregious conduct envisioned by the guidelines as
substantial interference with the administration of justice,'' the
24-page appeals court opinion said.
   Jones, who left home at age 14, climbed to a $100,000-a-year job
as an assistant bond trader in Drexel's high-yield junk bond
department in Beverly Hills, Calif., formerly run by now-indicted
executive Michael Milken.
   In three appearances before the federal grand jury, Jones said
she did not recall any discussions about stock ``parking'' in
contacts with Princeton-Newport Partners LP, a defunct investment
firm whose principals were convicted of securities fraud in July.
   Parking refers to placing stock temporarily with another party
to hide its true ownership. The practice is illegal when it is used
to circumvent regulations that require stockholders to disclose
shares they own in companies.
   The appeals court upheld her conviction by ruling against three
issues raised by her lawyer in the appeal: that Jones was denied
effective counsel by her trial attorney; that the prosecutor
conducted an improper cross-examination when she testified at
trial; and that the judge made an incomplete examination of a juror
whose son was a federal prosecutor in New Jersey.
   Jones' attorney, Daniel Bookin, said he had not decided whether
to appeal her conviction further. He would not comment on the
appeals court decision.
   Her resentencing was not yet scheduled.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc. plans to eliminate dozens of jobs in an
effort to cut costs, published reports said Friday.
   A CBS spokesman who was asked about the reports said only that
the company was ``looking more closely at every opening'' before
filling vacant spots.
   The New York Times reported in Friday's editions that
unidentified network executives said CBS plans to ``cut dozens of
employees from its staff ... either through a strict review of all
job openings or dismissals spaced out slowly.''
   The report said the reduction will be across the board with no
specific target date or number set.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that unnamed company
officials said CBS News plans to eliminate about 50 positions,
mainly through attrition.
   The Journal reported that the officials said CBS does not plan
another round of sweeping layoffs, however. In February 1987, for
instance, 215 people lost their jobs in CBS News as the division's
budget was cut by $33 million, the report said.
   Asked about the reports, CBS vice president George Schweitzer
said, ``There is no mandated staff reduction.''
   ``When a job comes open, we look at it more closely,'' he said.
   He described the exercise as ``prudent management'' and said
jobs still are being filled in some cases.
   The CBS television network is trying to climb out of third place
in the prime time ratings race against NBC and ABC. The company has
committed itself in recent months to pay more than $3.5 billion for
major sports events including major league baseball, pro football
and the Winter Olympics.

   Chemical Banking Corp. said Friday it will take
about a $52 million pretax charge in the first quarter to cover the
costs of previously announced steps to cut operating expenses.
   The charge will provide for severance and other one-time costs
of implementing the restructuring program, which is expected to
yield annual savings of $60 million in the future.
   The banking company did not estimate how much its first-quarter
net income would be reduced by the pretax charge.
   During the quarter, Chemical Bank in New York almost completed
the reduction of about 1,100 positions through attrition, voluntary
separations and job eliminations, it said. Certain operations in
the New York area are being consolidated.
   Also, Chemical has been carrying out money-saving measures at
its other subsidiaries. Staff reductions and consolidations are
under way at Chemical Mortgage Co. and Chemical Financial Services

<HEAD>FOMC Decided To Keep Interest Rates Steady In February</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Reserve policy makers decided at their
February meeting to continue their high interest rate policies to
keep inflationary pressures under control, according to minutes
released Friday.
   The federal funds rate has remained steady at 8.25 percent since
the Fed permitted it to drop from 8.5 percent on Dec. 21 ,following
the previous Fed policy meeting on Dec. 18-19.
   The federal funds rate is the interest banks charge each other
for overnight loans and is the primary lever the Fed uses to
control short-term interest rates.
   The policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, met
again Tuesday and analysts believe it voted to continue current
policies. Minutes of that meeting will not be released until May.
   The committee holds closed meetings eight times a year to
formulate monetary policy and confers by telephone as needed. It
consists of the seven Federal Reserve Board members and five of the
12 presidents of the Fed district banks.
   At the FOMC meeting Feb. 6-7, ``The information (on economic
conditions) ... suggested continued but sluggish expansion in
overall economic activity, with conditions uneven across sectors,''
the minutes read.
   ``Industrial activity remained weak, partly because of the
depressing effects of an inventory correction on manufacturing
output, while the service-producing sector of the economy continued
to grow moderately,'' they continued.
   The minutes stated that prices increased more slowly over most
of the second half of 1989, ``but unusually cold wather in December
put temporary upward pressure on food and energy prices.''
   And, they added, ``The staff projection prepared for this
meeting suggested that the economy was likely to expand relatively
slowly over the next several quarters.''
   But while the policy-makers ``generally agreed that continuing
growth in economic activity remained a reasonable expectation for
the year ahead,'' the minutes said ``members acknowledged that
there were considerable risks ... and some did not rule out the
possibility of a downturn.''
   At the conclusion of the meeting, the FOMC voted 8-3 not to
change policies, although they agreed some firming or easing of
credit would be acceptable depending on economic developments.

<HEAD>NASD Listing Changes Could Eliminate Trading in Many Penny Stocks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Companies with new stock offerings would have
to show they have twice as much capital and assets than they do now
to be listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers'
stock quote system under a proposed rule change.
   Trading in as many as 500 ``penny'' stocks could be eliminated
from the NASDAQ stock market, under the proposed rule which comes
partly in response to a federal crackdown on fraud in the low-cost
securities.
   The NASD, the self-regulatory agency that oversees the
over-the-counter stock market, said Thursday it would seek
Securities and Exchange Commission approval to raise the standards
companies must meet to be listed on the NASDAQ stock system.
   NASDAQ stands for the National Association of Securities Dealers
Automated Quotations system, a computerized stock price quotation
system owned and operated by the NASD.
   Penny stocks, low-cost, high-risk securities that usually trade
for less than a dollar, are often prone to fraud because most are
not listed on any stock exchange or the NASDAQ system. About 5,000
stocks currently trade on NASDAQ.
   The new standards will not affect about 2,700 stocks traded on
the NASDAQ National Market, which already has a higher standard.
   The changes, if approved by the SEC, would not go into effect
until next January, to give already listed companies time to meet
the new rule.
   Also, the NASD plans to provide an alternative system, the OTC
Bulletin Board, for companies with securities that are not eligible
for listing on the NASDAQ.
   The service, available through computer terminal screens, would
allow members, for the first time, to enter, update and view price
quotes on over-the-counter stocks not listed on NASDAQ. Brokers
would not be able to execute trades through the Bulletin Board
system, however.
   The new standards, adopted by the NASD's board of governors
earlier this month, would require companies issuing stock for the
first time to have a minimum of $4 million in total assets and $2
million in capital and surplus, compared to the present
requirements of $2 million and $1 million.
   In addition to the currently required 100,000 shares of public
float for an issue, the float would have to have a market value of
$1 million. Float is the term used to describe the number of public
shares circulating in the market.
   Stocks would have to have a minimum bid price of $3 per share.
There is no minimum required now.
   Maintaining a stock listing on NASDAQ under the new rule would
require a company to have $2 million in assets, instead of the
$750,000 in effect now. Also, $1 million in capital surplus, up
from $375,000 would be required. The float would have to have a
market value of $200,000 and the stock would be required to have a
$1 minimum bid price.
   NASD Executive Vice President John T. Wall said the changes
reflected the effects of inflation since the requirements were last
amended in 1981.
   Also prompting the changes was a Jan. 10 letter from the SEC
expressing concern that unscrupulous promoters might seek to
circumvent tougher rules for selling penny stocks by acquiring a
listing on NASDAQ Stock Market.
   Such a listing would exempt them from the SEC rule requiring a
client's written consent to buy stocks not listed by NASDAQ or a

   A top GAF Corp. executive was sentenced Friday
to six months in prison and the company was fined $2 million for
stock manipulation convictions stemming from the government's
crackdown on Wall Street crime.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe said she ordered a prison
term for GAF vice chairman James T. Sherwin because his conviction
``should be used as a lesson to others who may be tempted to engage
in conduct such as this.''
   Sherwin, 56, and GAF were convicted in December on eight counts
of stock manipulation, securities fraud, conspiracy and
record-keeping violations in a scheme to boost the stock price of
Union Carbide Corp. after a failed takeover.
   GAF, a Wayne, N.J., speciality chemicals concern, was the first
company outside of Wall Street to be convicted in the government's
insider trading investigation that began in 1986. The GAF case was
based on information indirectly supplied by convicted arbitrager
Ivan Boesky.
   ``I do not believe that a sentence should be imposed upon you to
punish you as a person,'' Lowe told Sherwin. ``... I do this with
heavy heart because I believe you are a good man.''
   But the judge said she felt compelled to issue prison time to
send a message to Wall Street that if financial market participants
break the law ``there will be a prison sentence at the end of the
road.''
   GAF attorney Arthur Liman said an appeal was planned. Sherwin
remains free pending appeal. Under the sentence, Liman said,
Sherwin would have to serve five months in prison, with one month
off for good behavior.
   Sherwin, who once was the nation's third-ranked chess player,
slumped in his chair as the verdict was read. He declined to
comment afterward, and was embraced by his tearful wife, two of his
three daughters and three stepdaughters.
   The case attracted wide attention on Wall Street when GAF, two
subsidiaries and Sherwin were indicted in July 1988 for allegedly
trying to inflate the price of Union Carbide stock in 1986. The
illegal action allegedly occurred shortly before GAF sold a large
block of Union Carbide shares it acquired in an unsuccessful
takeover attempt.
   The case endured two mistrials, the first in early 1989 after
the government inadvertently withheld a key piece of evidence and
the second after a jury was unable to reach a verdict after 12 days
of deliberations.
   GAF, a chemicals and building parts manufacturer, faced a
maximum fine of $4 million. Sherwin faced a maximum five years in
prison and $250,000 fine on each count.
   The parties recently paid $1.25 million to settle a civil
lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission on similar
allegations as in the criminal case.
   Judge Lowe sentenced Sherwin to six months in prison on one
count each of stock manipulation and record-keeping violations. She
suspended sentence on the other six counts and placed Sherwin on
one year probation.
   The government did not recommend a prison term for Sherwin,
saying only that a ``substantial sentence'' was warranted.
   ``The manipulation was done purely out of greed and not out of
financial necessity,'' the government said in its sentencing
memorandum. ``...In short, the scheme was calculated and
well-planned.''
   Sherwin, his voice cracking, told Lowe: ``Any sentence the judge
deems appropriate I am prepared to accept.''
   Stephen Kaufman, Sherwin's attorney, asked Lowe to order only
community service. He said Sherwin has a stellar reputation in
business, is active in human rights causes, and was not a
``systemic violator.''
   ``This was an aberrational act, an isolated act, an act totally
out of character with anything he's done in his life,'' Kaufman
said.
   Lowe said she could not recall a case in her 18 years as a judge
``that had caused me more anguish in attempting to fashion an
appropriate sentence.''
   Prosecutors based their case on testimony of former Los Angeles
stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies. He testified that Sherwin directed
him to buy large blocks of Union Carbide in late 1986 in an attempt
to raise its price to $22 a share and agreed to pay $40,000 to
cover his losses.
   A higher stock price would have meant more money for GAF, which
had accumulated 10 million shares of Union Carbide during the
failed takeover bid that year. GAF later sold 5 million shares to
Salomon Brothers Inc. for $23 a share.
   Jefferies also played a key role in two other securities fraud
convictions last year, of Florida investor Paul A. Bilzerian and
arbitrager Salim B. Lewis. Bilzerian was sentenced to prison, while
Jefferies and Lewis were fined and ordered to perform community
service.

   Stock prices closed out a sluggish first quarter
of 1990 with a mixed showing Friday in a session marked by late
weakness in blue chips.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 20.49 to
2,707.21, reducing its gain for the week to 2.93 points.
   Advancing issues and declines were evenly balanced in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 730 up, 724
down and 499 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 139.34 million
shares, against 132.19 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 165.95 million shares.
   Analysts said enthusiasm for stocks was restrained by continuing
doubts about the outlook for interest rates.
   Rates rose in the government bond market Friday. Prices of
long-term Treasury bonds dropped nearly $5 for each $1,000 in face
value, putting their yields in the 8.62 percent-8.67 percent range.
   Traders also reacted warily to renewed selling in the Tokyo
stock market, where prices fell 3.37 percent in the last activity
of Japan's fiscal year.
   In recent weeks U.S. stock prices have been holding steady while
the Japanese market has suffered a sharp setback.
   But some observers still worry that ripple effects from the drop
in Tokyo could soon start to spread more generally to other
financial centers around the world.
   The Dow Jones industrial average finished the first quarter with
a net decline of 45.99 points, or 1.67 percent.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Express dropped &rsqb; to
25}; Union Carbide &lsqb; to 21}; General Electric \ to 64\, and Philip
Morris &rsqb; to 39|. International Business Machines was up &lsqb; at 106&lsqb;.
   Amax, which rose sharply over the past few sessions on takeover
speculation, dropped back 1&lsqb; to 27} as the volume leader among NYSE
issues.
   Japanese issues traded in this country were broadly lower.
Matsushita Electrical fell 6} to 135; TDK Corp. 2 to 37}; Kyocera
2&lsqb; to 95, and Honda Motor } to 22&lsqb;.
   Motorola dropped 2{ to 65. As part of a court ruling in a patent
case, Motorola was order to stop selling a microprocessor widely
used in desktop computers.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $4.35 billion, or 0.13
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
slipped .32 to 186.85.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.24 to 394.18, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 0.85 at 339.94.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.12 to 435.54. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 361.75, up 1.52.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Bond prices lost ground Friday in light to
moderate activity, reflecting concerns that next week's economic
reports may indicate some lingering strength that could keep the
pressure on interest rates.
   The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond fell &rsqb; point, or $3.75 for
every $1,000 in face value.
   Its yield, which rises when the price falls, climbed to 8.62
percent from 8.58 percent late Thursday. Its yield had been 8.47
percent only a week ago.
   Prices were weighed down by a report from a Midwestern
purchasing managers group that suggested the economy is fairly
strong, according to Kevin Flanagan, money market economist for
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   He said the market is also concerned that Japanese investors,
under pressure from their government to support the yen, may not
buy as many Treasury bonds as they would otherwise over the next
few months.
   Some traders stayed out of the market while they await a pair of
important economic reports next week: the latest monthly survey by
the National Association of Purchasing Management and the March
unemployment figures.
   The Purchasing Management Association of Chicago reported Friday
that its index of area business activity rose to 55.1 percent in
March from 51 percent in February. It was the highest reading since
April.
   A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the manufacturing
sector and a reading below 50 indicates contraction.
   The Chicago index is based on a survey of company purchasing
managers in northern Illinois and northwestern Indiana, one of the
largest industrial areas in the country. It was viewed as an
indication that nationwide business conditions may show improvement
as well.
   Evidence of a revival in the economy would be hurt the bond
market because it would reinforce the belief that the Federal
Reserve might be leaning toward tightening its credit policy by
nudging up interest rates. Bond prices recede when interest rates
rise.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues fell 1-32 point, intermediate
maturities lost &lsqb; point and long-term issues fell as much as 15-32
point, according to figures provided by Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point equals a change of $10 in the price of a
bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.31 to 1,148.50.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell &lsqb; point to 91 7-32. The average yield
to maturity edged up to 7.52 percent from 7.51 percent late
Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills dipped to 8.05 percent as
the discount declined 4 basis points to 7.79 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 8.22 percent as the discount dropped 3
basis points to 7.80 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 8.32
percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to 7.75 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 percent, down from 8 7-16
percent late Thursday.

   When there were only four television channels in
Britain, watching ``telly'' was the country's favorite pasttime and
viewers boasted British programs were the best in the world.
   Now that government deregulation is bringing a smorgasbord of
conventional and satellite TV channels to British homes, studies
show audiences have dropped by 10 percent. Half of those still
watching grumble about the programming.
   It's a paradox that is troubling an industry in upheaval as the

   Britons still watch an average of about 25{ hours of television
every week. But that's a 10 percent drop from five years ago,
despite the arrival of overnight television in 1987 and then Sky.
   ``Some of this (drop) is attributable to video, but the same
psiderable increase in alternative leisure activr more holidays,

   Bernard Bennett, LWT's controller of research, thinks ``the

<TEXT>
   American General Corp. has filed suit to block an
attempt by smaller insurance rival Torchmark Corp. to elect
directors to the board following Torchmark's unsolicited $6.34
billion takeover bid.
   Six of American General's 15 directors are up for election at
the company's annual meeting on May 2, and Torchmark is putting its
own slate of nominees forward against the company's.
   American General said Torchmark did not comply with bylaws
requiring advance notification for the nomination of persons for
election to the board. The suit, filed Wednesday afternoon and
assigned to U.S. District Judge David Hittner, seeks an order
prohibiting Torchmark from soliciting proxies in its effort to
elect its slate of nominees.
   Harold S. Hook, chairman and chief executive officer of
Houston-based American General, said the company will discuss the
Torchmark bid at the May 2 meeting.
   Torchmark, which is based in Birmingham, Ala., offered to buy
about half of American General's 126.7 million outstanding shares
of common stock for $50 a share and exchange $50 worth of Torchmark
common stock for each of the remaining shares.
   Torchmark said all aspects of the offer are negotiable,
including the possibility of an all-cash deal.
   At the end of 1989, American General's total assets were $32.1
billion and common shareholders' equity was $4.1 billion.
   Torchmark reported total assets at Dec. 31 of $4.9 billion and
common shareholders' equity of $795 million.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Jump on Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Copper futures prices jumped to new life-of-contract highs
Friday on New York's Commodity Exchange amid fears of a miners
strike in Papua New Guinea and perceptions of a sharp drop in
deliverable supplies of copper in London.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals retreated, grains
and soybeans were mixed, livestock and meat futurs were mixed and
petroleum futures advanced.
   Copper futures settled 1.7 cents to 4.5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in April up 3.4 cents at $1.269 a pound,
eclipsing the high of $1.25 set by the April contract on March 22.
   Prices were supported in part by sketchy rumors of labor tension
at the O.K. Tedi copper mining complex in Papua New Guinea, a small
nation in the South Pacific whose Bougainville copper complex was
shut down nearly 11 months ago after attacks by irate landowners.
   Bill Steele, an analyst with the brokers advisory service
Research Department Inc. in Chicago, was skeptical of the rumors.
   ``The fact that there are no details leads me to believe it's
yet another bullish argument in a market that thrives on any
bullish news,'' he said.
   The market ignored potentially bearish news that 1,250 workers
at Highland Valley Copper Co.'s mine near Logan Lake, British
Columbia, may be ordered back to work by the government, ending a
three-day wildcat strike.
   Meanwhile, a strike against the Southern Peru Copper Corp.
stretched into its nineteenth day Friday, and the company was said
to be seeking a state-of-emergency declaration from the government
to force miners back to work.
   Buying also was linked to expectations that Monday's weekly
stocks report from the London Metal Exchange will show a decline of
5,000 to 10,000 metric tons of copper certified as deliverable
against futures contracts there.
   Precious metal futures edged lower on the Commodity Exchange in
another day of cautious trading following Monday's collapse of gold
prices to five-month lows.
   Gold futures settled 60 cents to $2.20 lower with April at
$370.20 a troy ounce; silver was 0.1 cent to 0.5 cent lower with
April at $4.945 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures surged in late trading and settled strongly
higher on the Cdicago Board of Trade while grain futures finished
mixed ahead of two eagerly awaited government reports that were
released after the close.
   The Agriculture Department's annual prospective plantings report
indicated U.S. farmers intend to increase corn acreage 3.5 percent
this year to 74.8 million acres, decrease soybean acreage 2.1
percent to 59.4 million acres and decrease spring wheat plantings 4
percent to 17 million acres.
   Analysts had expected a larger gain in projected corn acreage, a
bigger drop in soybean acreage and a smaller decrease in spring
wheat.
   The other USDA report, a quarterly estimate of grain stocks,
showed supplies of soybeans, corn and wheat to be slightly lower
than expected.
   Analysts pronounced the reports slightly bearish for soybean
futures and slightly bullish for the corn and wheat markets.
   Wheat futures settled 1\ cents lower to \ cent higher with May
at $3.51} a bushel; corn futures were } cent to 1\ cents higher
with May at $2.61\ a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 3\ cents higher
with May at $1.50 a bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 7\ cents
higher with May at $5.95 a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures finished
mixed while most pork futures advanced ahead of the USDA's
quarterly hogs-and-pigs inventory report.
   The report showed the nation's hog herd as of March 1 to be 4
percent smaller than a year earlier. The market had anticipated a
larger herd, so the report was expected to prompt some buying of
hog futures on Monday.
   Live cattle futures settled .30 cent lower to .12 cent higher
with April at 77.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with April at 82.15 cents a pound; live
hogs were .02 cent lower to .50 cent higher with April at 53.40
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .33 cent lower to .93 cent
higher with May at 53.57 cents a pound.
   Petroleum futures rose moderately on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, boosted by news of a threatened Soviet oil workers strike
in western Siberia and by buying linked to the expiration of the
April heating oil and unleaded gasoline contracts. The contracts
went off the board at 57.02 cents and 59.93 cents a gallon
respectively.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents to 25 cents
higher with May at $20.28 a barrel; heating oil was .18 cent to .56
cent higher with May at 54.34 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was
.45 cent to .55 cent higher with May at 65.36 cents a gallon.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merck &amp; Co. has appointed its first woman
chief financial officer, placing her in charge of about $2 billion
in investments and pension funds at the pharmaceutical giant.
   The appointment puts Judy C. Lewent, 41, who was also named vice
president for finance, among a small group of women to be appointed
CFO of a major U.S. corporation.
   ``I do believe I was given this job on the merits and against
stiff competition,'' Ms. Lewent said in a telephone interview
Friday from the company's headquarters in Rahway.
   ``I think there are still some more firsts for women to achieve,
but I think (the appointment) is a function of having the time and
the experience to achieve it,'' said Ms. Lewent, who was also
appointed vice president for finance.
   ``The phenomenon I've seen in my own career is tat there were
not a lot of women coming out of business schools with MBAs in the
early 1970s,'' Ms. Lewent said.
   Merck's board of directors Thursday elected Ms. Lewent, a
graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Sloan
School of Management, to oversee all financial matters for Merck,
which had $6.6 billion in sales last year.
   The appointment makes Ms. Lewent the highest ranking woman at
the company and one of a handful of women who have served as CFOs
at major U.S. corporations, said Merck spokesman John Doorley.
   ``We've done pretty thorough research and we don't know of any
other major corporation (currently) with a woman as a chief
financial officer,'' Doorley said.
   Ms. Lewent, who lives with her husband in New York City,
succeeds Alfred Smith, who retired at the end of 1989.
   Ms. Lewent's responsibilities include supervision of the
company's $1 billion in cash and short-term investments and $1
billion in pension funds.
   Her goals include developing a strategy to protect the company's
overseas sales from losses incurred by wide swings in foreign
currencies.
   On the domestic side, Ms. Lewent said the industry needs an
articulate spokesperson to rebut congressional critics who have
sought to bring pharmaceutical pricing under federal control.
   ``We are spending huge amounts on research and development to
bring breakthrough drugs to the market,'' she said.
   ``There's got to be a marketplace that understands we need an
adequate return,'' Ms. Lewent said.
   Ms. Lewent joined Merck in 1980 as director of acquisitions and
capital analysis.
   She was promoted to assistant controller of the Merck Sharp &amp;
Dohme Research Laboratories in 1983 and to executive director of
financial evaluation and analysis in 1985.
   She was promoted to vice president and treasurer in 1987,
reporting to Francis H. Spiegel Jr., senior vice president. She
will continue to report to Spiegel.

<HEAD>Judge Lifts Restraining Order On Mr. Donut Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EASTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has lifted a restraining
order that temporarily blocked the sale of the Mr. Donut chain to
its biggest competitor, Dunkin' Donuts.
   U.S. District Judge Franklin VanAntwerpen ruled Wednesday that
Mr. Donut franchise owners could pursue their lawsuit to block the
sale on antitrust allegations.
   But in dissolving the restraining order that been in effect
since Feb. 13, VanAntwerpen said the franchise owners failed to
prove they would suffer irreparable harm while they pursued their
lawsuit.
   The owners claim the sale would drive them out of business or
force them to make expensive conversions.
   Dunkin' Donuts is No. 1 in the nation with some 1,600 stores,
while Mr. Donut has about 550 outlets.

   The Bush administration accused 35 nations of
erecting unfair trade barriers against U.S. products, the first
step in a process that could lead to economic retaliation.
   The action on Friday was the latest salvo in a more aggressive
campaign on the part of the administration, prodded by Congress, to
find ways to reduce America's huge $109 billion annual trade
deficit.
   Japan led the list of offenders, with 19 pages of the 216-page
report devoted to its barriers against the sale of U.S. products.

<HEAD>TCI Plans to Offer Shareholders Stake in Program Unit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's biggest
cable television system operator, says it will divest about $1.7
billion in assets that will include all of its cable programming
interests except its 22 percent stake in Turner Broadcasting
Systems Inc.
   John Malone, chairman of the company, said the new company has
not been named. He said it will also include selected cable systems.
   Malone said TCI will conduct the spin-off through a stock rights
offering to existing shareholders who will be allowed to acquire
stock in the new company by paying for it with some of their
interest in TCI.
   TCI intends to keep a minority interest in the new company.
   The proposal replaces a plan that TCI announced in January under
which it envisioned spinning off to shareholders substantially all
of its cable interests into a new company.
   Robert Thomson, a TCI executive, said the company devised the
new plan because of uncertainties about how Congress may handle
calls to impose new regulations on cable operations.
   He said the new plan would enable TCI to retain an interest in
the programming company while those decisions are being made. He
said the company could later divest its stake if Congress requires
it, but would still have an interest in programming if Congress
does not.
   TCI has been criticized for becoming too powerful in the three
years since the industry was deregulated, and feels the spin-off
will relieve some of the pressure by breaking off some of those
assets.
   Malone, at the company's annual investors' conference on
Thursday, said TCI will offer shareholders a first opportunity at
ownership.
   ``We have it on the advice of counsel we could do something like
that in four months. We are proceeding forthwith,'' he said.
   Malone said Peter Barton, now senior vice president for
programming for TCI, will head the new company.
   According to company officials, the new company would consist of
one management team presiding over several cable programming
companies. The new company would develop programming and promote
the programs on other channels it has a stake in.
   The new company's assets will include a 50 percent stake in
Viacom Inc.'s Showtime Networks Inc., TCI's sports programming
interests and a 50 percent interest in Discovery Channel Inc.
   Malone said the company will retain its 22 percent stake in
Turner Broadcasting, which includes common and preferred stock
valued at $950 million.
   The Turner company operates the Cable News Network, CNN Headline
News and Turner Network Television as well as WTBS in Atlanta.

   BTR PLC of Britain sought a federal injunction
Friday to keep Norton Co. from delaying a shareholder proxy fight
after Norton rejected a $1.6 billion buyout bid.
   The request was contained in a lawsuit that also challenges
Massachusetts' anti-takeover law and Norton's ``poison pill''
defense against hostile bidders. Norton countersued Friday, seeking
to halt BTR's tender offer and proxy solicitation.
   BTR, a London-based industrial conglomerate, announced its
$75-per-share bid earlier this month for Norton, a leading
manufacturer of abrasives.
   On Thursday, Worcester-based Norton turned down the offer,
calling it ``inadequate.'' Its board of directors said it was
canceling the company's annual meeting, scheduled for April 26, and
set a special shareholders meeting for June 26.
   The board said it needed more time to explore its options,
including the possibility of attracting a minority investor to help
thwart the bid.
   But BTR's complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Boston,
said Norton's bylaws prohibit the annual meeting from being
rescheduled within 60 days of the date set for the meeting.
   The British firm said it was prepared to enter a proxy fight at
the annual meeting to elect its own slate of directors to the
company.
   The change in the meeting date will ``destroy the opportunity
for the Norton shareholders to hear the platform of the BTR
nominees,'' the complaint said.
   Norton in its lawsuit accused BTR of making ``false and
misleading'' public statements about its plans for the company.
   BTR intentionally has tried to ``obfuscate the critical facts''
concerning its past acquisitions and employment practices, in which
the company has ``repeatedly closed or relocated plants, fired
large numbers of employees and retaliated against organized labor
and attempts by workers to organize.''
   BTR's lawsuit claimed Massachusetts' anti-takeover law is
unconstitutional. Judith Fabricant, an assistant attorney general,
said the complaint essentially is moot because the state has not
enforced the statute since a federal court raised questions about
its validity in 1988.
   ``We do not intend to enforce it,'' she said. ``But we are not
taking a position to whether it is valid or not valid.''
   The lawsuit seeks an injunction against Norton's poison pill
plan, which would boost the cost of a takeover unless the board of
directors consents to the offer. BTR claims the plan breaches the
company's duty to stockholders.
   The state, however, has challenged BTR's claims, saying Norton's
responsibility is not limited to its shareholders.
   Under Massachusetts law, a company targeted for a takeover also
may consider the impact on employees, customers, suppliers, the
community and the state economy, Fabricant said.

   Porsche Cars North America Inc. said Friday it
is recalling more than 53,000 cars to correct a defect in a fuel

   The voluntary recall affects 1987-88 Porsche 924S cars, Porsche

Turbos made from the 1986 through 1988 model years.
   The fuel lines in those vehicles could harden, causing the
devices to leak and perhaps prompt an engine fire, Porsche said in
a statement.
   Porsche said it was aware of 16 car fires related to the hose
defect, adding that it had no reports of injuries or accidents from
the problem.
   Owners of the affected vehicles are to be notified of the recall
by mail. Repairs are to be done at no charge to owners.

   Federated Stores Inc., the parent company of
Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., on Friday
asked that it be placed under Chapter 11 protection of the U.S.
Bankrupty Court.
   The two subsidiaries filed for similar protection in January.
   G. William Miller, chairman and chief executive officer of the
parent company, said the petition was a procedural step ``to allow
us to expedite the reorganization planning process.''
   ``As the parent company of Federated and Allied, FSI is of
necessity concerned with the total debt structure of these
companies, as well as in helping to effect a solution to the
financial difficulties imposed by this structure,'' Miller said.
   ``By bringing FSI more directly into the Chapter 11 process, we
will be able to approach a reorganizatin solution for Federated and
Allied in a consistent and logical manner, and in a way that makes
the most sense for the companies and their creditors.''
   The parent company, whose officers and headquarters are in
Cincinnati, said the filing was made in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
San Francisco. Although the Federated and Allied divisions filed
their Chapter 11 proceedings in U.S. Bankrutpcy Court in
Cincinnati, the parent said it filed in San Francisco because that
court has jurisdiction over other Chapter 11 proceedings by some of
its intermediate holding companies.
   Allen I. Questrom, chairman and chief executive officer of the
Federated and Allied divisions, issued a statement aimed at
separating the action of the parent company from the day-to-day
retail operations.
   ``Because today's action by FSI has absolutely no effect
whatsoever on the ongoing businesses of Federated and Allied, we
want to avoid any risk of confusion or misunderstanding by assuring
that the record is set straight from the onset,'' Questrom said.
   ``The department store operations of Federated and Allied remain
sound and profitable. Sales are steadily improving and are now
runing ahead of plan. The companies' cash position is excellent.
   ``We have stabilized our work force and our organizations. Our
employees are receiving all of the pay and benefits to which they
are entitled, and we have returned to normal operations in
virtually all areas of our business and at all levels of our
companies across the country.''
   Federated Stores, formerly known as Campeau Corp. (U.S.), was
formed as the U.S. retailing subsidiary of Toronto-based Campeau
Corp., which is owned primarily by Canadian real estate developer
Robert Campeau.
   Campeau said in a statement Friday that it had amended
agreements with Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. and with two subsidiaries
of Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. due to the bankruptcy filing
Friday.
   The agreements require DeBartolo, a major shopping mall
developer, and Olympia &amp; York, a real estate concern, to refrain
from taking any collateral they hold in Campeau without giving nine
days' notice first. The amendment ensures the agreements remain in
effect despite the Chapter 11 filing, Campeau said.
   Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York helped ease Campeau's financial
difficulties last year through a loan to the company. On Friday,
Campeau said it will not pay interest due Saturday on two bond
issues and wants to defer the payments. One of the issues, worth
$260 million, is owned by Olympia &amp; York. The second, worth 184
million Canadian dollars, is publicly traded.
   Federated and Allied, which operate 260 deparment stores in 28
states, filed for bankruptcy protection Jan. 15, listing $7.7
billion in debt.
   The Federated group includes Bloomingdale's and Abraham and
Straus, both based in New York; Burdine's of Miami; Lazarus of
Cincinnati; and Rich's of Atlanta.
   The Allied group includes The Bon Marche of Seattle; Jordan
Marsh of Boston; Maas Brothers of Tampa; and Stern's of Paramus,
N.J.
   Campeau acquired Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988, largely
on the basis of borrowed money. But Federated and Allied were
unable to meet the interest payments on that debt, forcing the
bankruptcy filing.

<HEAD>Government, Savings Association Reach Agreement on Receiver</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS penultimate graf pvs to CLARIFY the thrift office's
position on Franklin's assets.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BARBARA JOSEPH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Franklin Savings Association and the Office
of Thrift Supervision reached agreement Friday on the issue of
receivership after an almost two-hour negotiating session among
lawyers in federal court.
   The agreement essentially gives Franklin a chance to argue its
case in court if the OS decides to put the state's largest thrift
into receivership. A receiver could liquidate all of Franklin's
assets.
   Franklin and its holding company, Franklin Savings Corp.,
withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction against OTS and
the Kansas Savings and Loan Department in U.S. District Court. The
injunction was designed to prevent appointment of a receiver until
Franklin has its day in court to contest the Resolution Trust
Corp.'s conservatorship of the thrift.
   The agreement, outlined to Judge Dale Saffels, provides that no
receiver will be appointed or substituted for the present
conservator without giving notice to the court and to Franklin 24
hours in advance. The agreement also requires the thrift office to
justify to the court its reason for appointing a receiver if it
attempts to do so.
   Earlier, the OTS only agreed to give Franklin the advance notice.
   Franklin, which was seized by the RTC on Feb. 16, believed the
RTC's conservatorship was merely a prelude to a receivership. Once
a receiver is appointed, the court can't intervene.
   The thrift said it will contest the validity of the
conservatorship in a trial set to begin June 25 in Saffels' court
here.
   Attorneys for Franklin came prepared with exhibits to argue
their case. Attorneys for OTS said they also were prepared.
Saffels, however, asked both parties to try to come to an agreement.
   The negotiating session involved a call to Washington, D.C., to
secure approval of the compromise by OTS officials.
   OTS attorney Paul W. Grace of Washington said normally no notice
is required for appointment of a receiver. He would not say whether
he was pleased or displeased with the agreement.
   ``Let's just say it's a compromise both sides are willing to
accept,'' Grace said.
   Ernest Fleischer, chairman of Franklin's holding company and on
leave as chairman of the thrift, said he was pleased with the
agreement. An attorney for Franklin, Charles German, said of the
agreement, ``It's what we came for.''
   The Justice Department was present at the hearing to argue the
constitutionality of the appointment of former OTS director M.
Danny Wall, who authorized Franklin's conservatorship. However,
Saffels said he was not willing to take up that issue, which arose
when a federal district judge in Washington ruled last week that
Wall's appointment was unconstitutional. An appeals court later
stayed that ruling pending its review of it.
   Franklin contends the thrift was not insolvent at the time it
was taken over by federal regulators. The thrift and the OTS differ
over the accounting principles used by Franklin.
   Franklin, through the president of its holding company, John
Scowcroft, claims it has a net worth of $387 million, using
generally accepted accounting principles.
   The OTS agrees with that figure, but only as of Dec. 31, 1989,
said spokeswoman Cindy Williams. She said that figure likely would
be down by next quarter's report but could not release a monthly
figure. The thrift experienced a major writedown in its capital in
March.
   The thrift was hedging itself against swings in interest rates
by using the futures market.

   U.S. District Judge Helen Frye on Friday
denied an attempt to block the federal government from proceeding
with its takeover of the Benj. Franklin Savings and Loan
Association.
   The lawsuit was one of several filed around the country against
the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision in the wake
of a decision last week by a federal judge in Washington that the
appointment of former OTS director M. Danny Wall was
unconstitutional. An appeals court later stayed that ruling pending
its review of it.
   The former directors of the thrift were refused a temporary
restraining order that would have prevented federal regulators from
taking further management actions involving the institution.
   Benj. Franklin, the largest thrift in Oregon and the 41st
largest in the nation, was seized Feb. 21 by federal regulators who
cited its failure to meet the stringent financial requirements of
the new savings and loan law.
   The former directors filed a lawsuit March 23 challenging the
takeover, calling it a ``capricious action'' that may have been
unconstitutional. The lawsuit seeks to have the thrift returned to
its stockholders.

<TEXT>
   Facing a major shareholder's call for leaner
operations and new directors, General Development Corp. Friday
announced a two-month delay in its annual meeting.
   The Miami-based home builder and real estate firm, which pleaded
guilty last week to federal fraud charges, said the annual meeting
has been rescheduled from May 4 to June 1 to give additional time
to prepare audited financial statements.
   Meanwhile, the company on Friday increased its board of
directors to nine members with the appointment of Newark, N.J.,
attorney James Wyer, a former vice president of American Cyanamid
Co.
   On Wednesday, a major General Development shareholder, United
Capital Corp., filed a restructuring plan with the Securities and
Exchange Commission proposing General Development sell its
time-sharing and utility businesses and undeveloped commercial
property.
   The plan also offered short-term operating funds and pledged to
complete infrastructure improvements at General Development's nine
Florida communities.
   New York-based United Capital, which holds about 12.6 percent of
General Development common stock, is also seeking the ouster of six
directors and has offered a proxy slate, including United Capital
President Attilio Petrocelli.
   United Capital paid an average of nearly $13 a share for General
Development stock in 1988. The stock closed Friday at $5.87{, up
$1.12{ a share, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   General Development pleaded guilty March 22 to a mail-fraud
conspiracy stemming from allegations it overpriced nearly 10,000
homes and mislead customers, many from the Northeast and Midwest.
   A U.S. District judge still must finalize a plea agreement that
could lead to $500,000 in fines for the company and a maximum of
five years in jail for two former executives.

<HEAD>Government Sets Light Truck CAFE for 1992</HEAD>

   Fuel economy standards for 1992 light trucks will
stay the same as for 1991 models, the government said Friday.
   Auto companies opposed tougher standards for 1992, saying people
are buying larger trucks that bring average fuel economy down.
Environmental groups had argued that the standard should be tougher.
   ``The biggest thing we can do to curb global warming is to
improve the fuel efficiency of our cars and light trucks,'' said
Sierra Club spokesman Dan Becker in Washington, D.C.
   The corporate average fuel economy standard for 1992 light
trucks will be 20.2 miles per gallon, the same as the 1991 CAFE
requirement and up from 20 mpg this year, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said.
   In addition to setting a CAFE requirement for cars, currently
27.5 miles per gallon, NHTSA annually sets a light truck standard
applying to pickup trucks, vans and utility vehicles that weigh up
to 8,500 pounds.
   NHTSA decided manufacturers couldn't achieve significant
improvements for 1992 through technological or marketing changes,
spokesman Jim Herd said.
   Ford Motor Co. backed the lower requirement because larger
trucks are selling faster than smaller, more fuel-efficient ones,
said David L. Kulp, Ford's manager of fuel economy, planning and
compliance.
   ``We felt that the market was going to hold us at this kind of
level. There are improvements being made in the trucks, they've
just been offset by some of the shifts to the larger products,''
Kulp said.
   General Motors Corp. spokesman John Anderson said the decision
recognized that tighter standards could reduce trucks' usefulness.
``Trucks have an enormous range of applications, from towing to
agricultural and construction uses,'' he said.
   The Environmental Action Foundation argued on behalf of groups
including the Sierra Club that standards should be raised, to 35
miles per gallon by 2000, said Dru Schmidt-Perkins, environmental
analyst for the group.
   ``They are already 25 percent less efficient than cars,''
Schmidt-Perkins said. ``And for the most part these are not farm
vehicles and not commercial vans, they are minivans and light
pickup trucks which do nothing more than haul briefcases and
groceries.''

   Colorado-Ute Electric Association,
losing a year-long battle against financial disaster, filed in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court in Denver on Friday for protection from creditors
while it attempts to salvage itself.
   The case is one of the largest utility bankruptcy filings in the
country, according to federal officials, and threatens the
long-term cost of power for consumers in much of Colorado.
   With $1.2 billion in debt, Colorado-Ute filed for Chapter 11
reorganization to stave off its many creditors while it tries to
solve its problems.
   Colorado-Ute, based in Montrose in western Colorado, is owned by
14 member rural electric co-ops and serves an estimated 600,000
customers.
   The filing will have no effect on day-to-day operations of the
utility, President Ray Keith said in a news release.
   On March 31, 1989, Colorado-Ute defaulted on its loans, blaming
the oil shale bust for leaving the company with excess capacity.
However, the bust was triggered by Exxon Corp.s pullout from the
industry in 1982, and Colorado-Ute not only pushed ahead with plant
construction but also launched an expensive experimental power
plant at Nucla that still loses money.
   Colorado-Ute lost an estimated $15 million in 1989.
   In its filing, Colorado-Ute listed liabilities of $920.2 million
and assets of $888.3 million. The documents do not reflect the
company's $300 million lease obligation on its Craig 3 power plant.
The company says the lease obligation is not a debt.
   Most of the liabilities are held by two federal lenders: the
U.S. Rural Electrification Administration and the National
Consolidated Finance Corp., for a combined debt of more than $700
million to the federal government.
   Other major creditors listed on the court filing were:
   _Public Service Co. of Colorado, $31.4 million of debt.
   _ColoWyo Coal Co., $23.6 million for disputed coal royalties.
   _Craig 3 Lease Trustee, $11.8 million in current lease payments.
   _Norwest Bank of Minneapolis, United Bank of Denver and
Manufacturers Hanover Trust, $10 million each.
   In the year since Colorado-Ute defaulted, the company tried to
merger with both Public Service Co. of Colorado and Tri-State
Generation &amp; Transmission Co. It also attempted to raise rates by
23.7 percent.
   Public Service Co. withdrew its offer last summer. On March 8,
state regulators denied the big rate increase, allowing only an 8
percent hike. Tri-State, like Colorado-Ute a generating company
owned by its rural co-ops, halted merger talks after the rate hike
denial and then cut off Colorado-Ute's access to a $40 million
revolving loan.
   With no access to cash, and facing a Monday deadline for a $15
million interest payment to the REA, the utility filed in
bankruptcy court late Friday afternoon.
